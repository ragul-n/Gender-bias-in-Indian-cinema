1
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,000
Move fast!

2
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:13,917
The two of you, go up there.

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,833
-Search every corner. Don't miss a thing!
-Yes, sir!

4
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,292
-You go that way.
-Yes, sir!

5
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,875
Search every room.

6
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,292
Police!

7
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:33,667
<i>Salute thee, O my Motherland!</i>

8
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,625
<i>Salute thee!</i>

9
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,042
-This way!
-Yes, sir.

10
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,125
<i>O my Motherland!</i>

11
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,667
<i>Salute thee!</i>

12
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:50,375
<i>Salute thee!</i>

13
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,208
<i>Salute thee!</i>

14
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,250
Get the rascal!

15
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,333
<i>Salute thee, O my Motherland!</i>

16
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,458
Hey, stop!

17
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:05,958
<i>Salute thee!</i>

18
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>O my Motherland!</i>

19
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:39,833
THE SLAYING OF MEGHNAD

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,500
<i>Appear, O generous Mother,
Appear in your all enchanting form</i>

21
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:50,542
<i>I shall sing the great epic
Immersed in the heroic avatar</i>

22
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,917
<i>Appear! Your devotee will find
A shade at your feet</i>

23
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,292
<i>You also come, you Godly Bee
My Imagination</i>

24
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:06,417
<i>Extract the honey from the poet's soul
Make a beehive</i>

25
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,958
<i>And now, it's time for the game to begin</i>

26
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,167
<i>Thus spoke the lion-hearted warrior</i>

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,792
<i>The drums reverberated along
The corridors of power</i>

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,542
<i>The clarion call got the warrior
To dress in his fineries</i>

29
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,792
Soumitri spoke like the roaring cloud!

30
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:44,667
"If a hunter happens to catch a tiger
in the trap he set up,

31
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,500
does he let it live?

32
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:52,875
With you born into the demon family,
why should I follow the rules of war?

33
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,875
For killing the enemy
any means is justified."

34
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,208
Said Basabjeta

35
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:00,208
in a voice akin to that of Abhimanyu,
while facing the seven warriors alone.

36
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,333
"You are a shame to the warrior tribe!"

37
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,917
At last,

38
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,250
Arindam spoke in despair!

39
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,875
"Who knows how Lakshman
has found his way to the Demon land.

40
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,125
Oh, Uncle!

41
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,042
Was this the right action?"

42
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:34,542
The mighty Lakshman dropped his bow,
took out his sword.

43
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:40,792
The light of the sword blade
blinded Arindam.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,958
What misfortune! He was knocked down!

45
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,042
<i>Now I would ask Mr. Prabuddho
to take up the responsibility of hosting.</i>

46
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:15,375
Who are these people?

47
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,917
Today is a day to be proud.

48
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,750
On this day, a son of Bengal

49
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,417
is releasing a Bengali translation
of his English novel.

50
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,792
Astonishing!

51
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:30,792
This reminds us of one of the pioneers
of modern Bengali literature,

52
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,417
Babu Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay.

53
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,625
This was before <i>Durgesh Nandini</i>
was published.

54
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:40,542
Bankim had started translating
<i>Rajmohan's Wife</i> into Bengali.

55
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,875
But he could not get very far.

56
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,042
Fortunately, another son of Bengal,

57
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,708
our very own Asimava Bose,
has not shared the same fate.

58
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,208
-Comparing me to Bankim?
-Why not, my friend?

59
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,958
It's unimaginable that Asimava's
<i>The Big Bong Theory</i>

60
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:03,083
has won the highest honor
in the genre of science fiction!

61
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:06,292
The Arthur C Clarke Award.

62
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,042
Thank you.

63
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,875
The Bengali translation,

64
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,875
<i>Brihat Bongiya Tatwa</i>

65
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,458
is the fruit of the tireless efforts
of Elena Roy Mazumdar.

66
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>The dark night shall end
was a promise unkept</i>

67
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,458
<i>The blues are spreading secretly!</i>

68
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:31,917
<i>Asimava Bose...</i>

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
Hey! Wrik isn't picking up.

70
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,833
-Don't worry. He'll be here.
-What is he doing?

71
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:40,958
Each year, during winter,
Asimava comes back to his hometown.

72
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,583
Who knows why?

73
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,792
God knows why he'd come to Kolkata
from Oxford.

74
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:49,208
-Is it the calling of the motherland?
-Or could it be someone special?

75
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,667
Neither. It's my bones.

76
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,792
Arthritis. Also called joint pain
or stiffness.

77
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,958
In Oxford, it is now 19 degrees.

78
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,792
-You feel the chill in your bones!
-Anyway...

79
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,375
Asimava's present wife,
the renowned actress...

80
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,583
Old man's young wife!

81
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,958
Sorry... Actor, Indrani Mitra.

82
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:14,792
She's not as young as she looks.
She has a grownup daughter.

83
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,083
The wait is over.

84
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,542
The one you've been waiting for,
Asimava Bose, shall now speak.

85
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:27,208
The problem of speaking after Prabuddho
is there's hardly anything left to say.

86
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,250
What I can say about Elena's work
is that nothing is lost in translation.

87
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,000
And since this story is set
in the Kolkata of the future,

88
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,833
I expect that the Bengali language
will add a different flavor.

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,042
Without further delay, I would
request Elena to say a few words.

90
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,208
And also, read a passage from the novel.

91
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,833
Thank you, Mr. Asim.

92
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,250
I was hesitant, before I proposed
to translate the book.

93
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,833
Then I took the plunge!

94
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:01,167
And when Mr. Asim suddenly agreed,
I was taken aback.

95
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,292
But I had a hidden agenda.

96
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,167
I wanted to get to know
Mr. Asimava Bose more closely.

97
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,833
It's best not to know too much.

98
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,375
Why don't we move to the narration?

99
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,083
You may ask questions after the narration.

100
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:20,417
"Every Bong continues in
its state of rest or uniform motion.

101
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,250
Unless compelled by some external
force to act otherwise."

102
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,958
-We'll figure something out. Don't worry.
-How?

103
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,625
No one else is coming for rehearsal.

104
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,000
-Yes?
-Hello Wrik, where are you?

105
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,250
I'm coming in a bit.

106
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,208
The main event is about to end.

107
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,875
I told you I had an important rehearsal.

108
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,167
But this is important too.

109
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,292
It's your father's book release.

110
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,875
It doesn't look good that you aren't here.

111
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,917
And your father will feel bad.

112
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,083
Really?

113
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,292
Of course. Please come.

114
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,625
Coming in a bit.

115
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:10,917
Okay.

116
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,542
-Please have a seat.
-Thanks.

117
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,000
I live in New York.

118
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,333
In the literary circle there, we jokingly
refer to you as Asimov Bose.

119
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,167
Or did Isaac Asimov inspire you?

120
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,625
Definitely. Why only Asimov?

121
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,958
Many writers have inspired me.
Such as Zamyatin...

122
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:49,167
Douglas Adams, Phillip Dick.
Even Satyajit Ray.

123
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,708
In college, I had a nickname, Asimov.

124
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,167
At that time I was only a sci-fi addict.

125
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,875
Any more questions?

126
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,792
Yes.

127
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,958
-Hold on. Here's the microphone.
-Well! Who is this?

128
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,667
-I don't need it. My voice is enough!
-The zeal of old age!

129
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,042
Asim, it's been a while since
I've seen you in the flesh.

130
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,958
-Oh, my. He's here too.
-Imagine!

131
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,500
Mr. Sirajul, how are you?

132
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,042
The same as I ever was.

133
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,417
Forget about me.

134
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,417
I am here to bask
in the reflected glory of my disciple.

135
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,875
But I have a question for you.

136
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:26,083
You have used Kolkata as
the setting in two of your novels.

137
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:31,208
In <i>Calcutta Chemicals</i>
you have depicted 1950's Kolkata,

138
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,042
and in this novel
it's the Kolkata of 2050.

139
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,333
But the time you spent in Kolkata...

140
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,375
I mean, your childhood, adolescence
and student life,

141
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,583
the simmering Kolkata of the 70's,

142
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,042
which you have observed closely...

143
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:53,167
Recently someone wrote on the subject
and nearly bagged the Booker.

144
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:59,417
But we see no reference
of that time in your writing.

145
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,583
Why is that?

146
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,917
Is this a coincidence? Or something else?

147
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,167
I am a sci-fi writer.

148
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,583
So I have to use my imagination.

149
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,583
It is more enjoyable to construct
a time that I have not witnessed

150
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,292
as opposed
to the time I've lived in, isn't it?

151
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,667
Was my answer satisfactory?

152
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,917
Yes...

153
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,708
It sounded like an excuse.

154
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,583
-Come.
-Sorry, I am late.

155
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,833
Asim is there. Go.

156
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,625
Excuse me. Hi.

157
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,250
-You couldn't come earlier?
-No, Elena.

158
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,125
-Mr. Gangapada Basu's <i>Parashpathar</i>.
-Correct.

159
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,375
Since when did you write
with your right hand?

160
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,583
I remember you writing with your left.

161
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,667
I didn't know you were ambidextrous.

162
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,500
The nerves in my left hand
were injured in an accident.

163
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,125
Then I became a rightist.

164
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,875
-I didn't know
-Please.

165
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Mr. Asim has agreed to give me
a long and exclusive interview.

166
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:21,208
And I'm hoping that the piece will
reveal an unknown side of him.

167
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,125
Sorry, one more please.

168
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,875
This one is for your cousin?

169
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,542
Kind of Mr. Uttam Kumar's <i>Nayak</i> movie.

170
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,208
Have the two of you met?

171
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,792
You've been so busy lately so I didn't
get a chance to introduce you two.

172
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,708
She's Janaki.

173
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,625
Yes... I showed you a picture of her.

174
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,583
She has transferred
all her responsibilities to you.

175
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,833
My savior.

176
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,125
She takes care of the house,
while you roam free.

177
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:52,792
No.

178
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,083
In fact, I am grateful to Indrani
for giving me this opportunity.

179
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,417
If you don't like the cover page,
I would say...

180
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:07,000
And if you do like the cover...

181
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,167
Then I would say that...

182
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,167
Let's go.

183
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,792
So, Bulu? What's new?

184
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,167
-Riku?
-How are you?

185
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,125
I'm fine. What about you?

186
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,042
Carrying on...

187
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,625
Since grandma passed away,
there was no trace of you.

188
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,250
Basically busy doing nothing.

189
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,000
And what will I do in that house?

190
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:32,958
That is your house too.

191
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,708
Let it be.

192
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,167
You know how it is.

193
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,458
And my mother's health condition
is such...

194
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,458
How is Aunt Ranga?

195
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,208
The same as she was.

196
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,875
Sometimes she's okay
but then her health deteriorates.

197
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:45,917
I'll come over some time.

198
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,750
So, what are you up to?

199
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,417
Pulling along a caretaker's wretched life!

200
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,542
Why are you sitting alone here?
Come with me.

201
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,167
No, you go.

202
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,167
Go inside and interact with everyone. Go.

203
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,500
No, Bulu.

204
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,542
Basically, we are in the same situation.

205
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,875
We're fringe characters.

206
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,583
Which is my next movie?

207
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,333
Instead of asking me about my next movie,

208
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,583
I think you should be asking
Asimava about his next book.

209
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,583
That was a good one!

210
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,208
Dr. Asimava Bose.

211
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:40,458
Remember the exhibition?

212
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,083
Oh, yes!

213
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,708
If I do forget,
Indrani will definitely remind me.

214
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,750
-Okay.
-Come over.

215
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,333
Let's make good use of C2H5OH derivatives.

216
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,167
Shaken not stirred.

217
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,542
There was quite a crowd.

218
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,292
Most of them were there to see you.

219
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,917
Don't talk rubbish, Asim.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,958
Seventy copies were sold today!

221
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,750
They had to buy it out of courtesy!

222
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,625
Have you noticed something?

223
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,583
What?

224
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,875
Most of them present were over 40.

225
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,542
Today's generation is not interested.

226
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
You are bothered
because your son came late. Isn't it?

227
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,208
Who? Wrik?

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,917
Forget about him.

229
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,708
He is fickle-minded.

230
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,500
First journalism, then advertising,
and then rehab.

231
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,875
And now he wants to be a rockstar!

232
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,958
Now there's a new addition.

233
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,417
Trekking in the mountains.

234
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,292
His mother has spoilt him.

235
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,375
Why are you bringing her into this?

236
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,917
She's sick.

237
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,958
I have done a lot for her.

238
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,417
I send her money regularly.

239
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,083
But I have serious doubts
about where that money is going.

240
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,167
What?

241
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,708
What?

242
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,750
Marijuana and a wild lifestyle!

243
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,542
Don't say any of this to Wrik.

244
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,292
The distance between
the two of you will grow.

245
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,958
I am trying to bring this
dysfunctional family together and...

246
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,333
Whatever!

247
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,625
Guli is coming.

248
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,708
When is your daughter coming?

249
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,625
My daughter? Okay.

250
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,750
-Want another?
-Yes.

251
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,708
Day after.

252
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,167
Janaki booked her a flight
at a very good price online.

253
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,708
Where did you find this assistant?

254
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,583
She is a Bengali from Nagpur.

255
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
She contacted me via email.

256
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,750
She studied Comparative Literature
at Jadavpur. Then did her masters at JNU.

257
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,292
She has knowledge
about folk performers as well.

258
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,792
She is a freelance theatre critic.

259
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,625
Used to work in Delhi.

260
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,667
Wow. She is multi-talented.

261
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,500
When I had malignant malaria,
she took care of everything.

262
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:09,667
She is very passionate
about ethnic culture.

263
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,542
We have to send this clip
to the lady in Amsterdam.

264
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,958
Even if there is
no direct link to my life,

265
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,958
the events and people I have come across

266
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:41,125
may knowingly or unknowingly
become a part of my writing.

267
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,292
But all our experiences cannot be
brought to the written word.

268
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,333
What do you mean by all experiences?
Something personal?

269
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,500
Hey! Stop that.

270
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:54,917
-This?
-Yes.

271
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:59,167
You dig really deep to find secrets.

272
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,917
My childhood, student life,

273
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,125
politics, love, relationships,
marital, extra-marital.

274
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,708
You will get me in trouble.

275
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,583
I think, we should limit our discussion

276
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,792
to my writing only.

277
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,667
Alright. Okay. Should I switch it on?

278
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,250
I heard that you were
a very charismatic student leader?

279
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,667
Am I right?

280
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,708
-Nothing like that.
-Then?

281
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,792
-It's nothing much.
-Okay.

282
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,333
At that time everyone
got a little involved.

283
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:34,333
Yes.

284
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,625
Francois Guizot explains it well.

285
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,583
Which one?

286
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,083
Like...

287
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,375
I'm sorry, but didn't
Winston Churchill say this?

288
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,125
No. Common misconception.

289
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,042
Oh, I see.

290
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:02,667
I love taking events
from real life and fictionalize them

291
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,958
in a different time and space.

292
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:11,375
And what are your thoughts
on the current political scenario?

293
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,083
I am not a part of this. Let me be.

294
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,583
So you have come to terms with yourself?

295
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,417
I am a migratory bird.

296
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,750
I get some advantages from the government.

297
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,458
Are you out to stop that as well?

298
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,208
That will be all for today.
But I still have a lot of questions.

299
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,667
-I'll be back later.
-What?

300
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,083
What happened?

301
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,292
Listen...

302
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,792
Do you know anyone who does catering
for small parties?

303
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,167
Yes.

304
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:52,958
Let me know.

305
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,458
Okay? Talk to you later.

306
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,875
-Indrani?
-Yes.

307
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,292
He makes special Awadhi biryani.

308
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:11,417
Actually, I made a huge blunder
by giving him money.

309
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,708
Before he used to just ask for it.

310
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,167
But now he demands it.

311
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,875
The other day he got violent.

312
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,167
See, if you would like I could
speak to the police and--

313
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,708
Anyway, in the midst of all this,
I forgot an important thing.

314
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,167
Remember I had asked
you about the Lit-fest?

315
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,375
Yes.

316
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,125
That's on the 7th.

317
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,167
-At Victoria, right?
-Correct.

318
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,417
We'll go to eat <i>phuchka</i> after.

319
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:50,792
Asim?

320
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,458
Come.

321
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,000
There was a lot of noise outside, so...

322
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,792
Nikhilesh is calling you.

323
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,667
About the exhibition at 6:00 p.m.

324
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,958
I think your phone is switched off.

325
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,708
No. It was on silent...

326
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,708
You could have slept for a while.

327
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,958
No, I need to continue writing.

328
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,250
Wow! What's happened to you?

329
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,333
Back to your mother tongue.
That too in Bankimesque style?

330
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,792
Trying to write a story in Bengali.

331
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:31,167
Firstly, I type with one hand,
plus these tricky spellings in Bengali...

332
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,833
I feel like Mr. Lal Mohan.

333
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,958
Failing to understand
the use of Bengali vowels.

334
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,292
Where's the problem?
You have your own Topshe.

335
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,417
But nowadays you don't share
anything with me.

336
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,750
No point in telling you now.
Let me finish it.

337
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,542
Listen, we'll be leaving at 5:30 p.m.
It's close by at Aakar Prakar.

338
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,417
Asim is an old friend.

339
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,250
That's why he couldn't say no to me.

340
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,833
He has put on a smile and is here now.

341
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:17,750
But Asim has great respect
for Ganeshda's work.

342
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,125
I am undaunted.

343
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:23,917
I can't even draw a straight line,
yet I am inaugurating an art exhibition.

344
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,292
But I am going to stare seriously
at the paintings

345
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,292
even if I don't understand art.

346
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,375
-Will you treat us?
-Yes, Vermouth and Chateau Briand.

347
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,708
-Let me look after that side.
-Yes.

348
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,000
Your sidekick is here too?

349
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:46,833
Why? Any problem?

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,917
No.

351
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,167
And where is your shadow?

352
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,500
-Who? Elena?
-Elena?

353
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,750
She had some...

354
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,083
Ma'am, could we get a semi-profile please?

355
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,542
Hey?

356
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,292
Kunal? What's up?

357
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,583
It has been years.

358
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,833
Not years but ages. How are you?

359
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,208
Still breathing.

360
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:07,500
I see you still roam
about with your camera.

361
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,958
Bad habits die hard.
And Ganeshda insisted.

362
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,792
Asim.

363
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,292
Kunal.

364
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:18,708
Wow! I have heard--

365
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,083
A lot of terrible things about me?

366
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,333
What are you saying?

367
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,875
The picture of Rani collecting
an award from the President,

368
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,833
which adorns our wall,
was possible because of you.

369
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:29,875
No, not at all. It was my first film.
There were many mistakes.

370
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:33,458
Despite being a renowned actress,
she agreed to act in my film.

371
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,042
And for that, I shall remain grateful.

372
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,417
Don't talk rubbish.

373
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,333
He hasn't cast me ever since.

374
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,500
No. But you have to admit...

375
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,625
Satyajit Ray.

376
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,833
Please don't be so formal.

377
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,833
I have never met you before,
but have always wanted

378
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:53,917
to make a film based on your
<i>Calcutta Chemical</i>.

379
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,167
A film on<i> Calcutta Chemical</i>?

380
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,875
-I actually--
-Let me interrupt.

381
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,250
Let's save some conversation for later.

382
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,833
To be continued
over a dinner at our place.

383
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:04,750
Definitely.

384
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,708
Come over if you're not busy.

385
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:09,167
Filmmakers like me are mostly free.

386
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,333
Good thing I came here,
I got to see you again after so long.

387
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,292
See you in a bit.
Let me say bye to Nikhilesh.

388
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,458
-See you Mr. Sen. For sure.
-We will meet soon.

389
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,875
What are you thinking about?

390
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,250
-Something just struck me.
-What?

391
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:34,667
It's not something I should say here.
I will call you later. One minute.

392
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,917
All good?

393
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,833
Join me once you are done.

394
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,875
-Hi, sir. I'm Badal Biswas.
-Hi.

395
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,792
We run a small magazine.

396
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,208
<i>Jukti, Tokko, Goppo.</i>

397
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,333
I have read everything you have written.

398
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,833
Could you please sign this?

399
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:54,875
Of course.

400
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:02,500
We are trying to bring out
a special edition on science fantasy.

401
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,708
That's great.

402
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,875
We found a great piece of old fiction.

403
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,000
Most probably the first
ever Bengali science-fiction.

404
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,667
Jagadanda Roy's <i>Shukro Bhromon</i>.

405
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,875
Yes, sir. You will know, of course.

406
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,500
-Are you going?
-Yes, let's go.

407
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:19,917
Could we get a small piece
from you for this edition?

408
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,042
It's not possible for me
to commit so suddenly.

409
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,583
No, I mean...

410
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,792
It could just be a few
words wishing us well.

411
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,208
But right now...

412
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,292
Okay, sorry.

413
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,542
I will not embarrass you by asking
for your mobile number.

414
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,583
Could I get your landline?

415
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,250
Oh. What was it?

416
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,458
-Okay, thanks.
-Have I seen you before?

417
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,375
I have seen you in a lot of films.

418
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:50,250
But I don't think I have had
the luck of being seen by you.

419
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,417
-Yes. We will too.
-Let's go.

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,833
See you.

421
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,333
Sir, I will come over one day.

422
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,542
-Please call before coming.
-Yes, of course.

423
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,583
Hello?

424
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:13,542
Bulu!

425
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,583
-Were you calling me?
-Yes, I was.

426
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,958
Have you not paid the phone bill?

427
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,958
They're sending us recorded messages.

428
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,833
Yes, I completely forgot.
I'll pay it tomorrow.

429
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,958
Since you all have arrived,
I've had no time--

430
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,167
Okay, Guli is coming tomorrow.

431
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,958
How do you tolerate this?

432
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,333
If you allow me,
I could speak to Sushovon.

433
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,917
Yes, our commissioner.

434
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,292
-Is it clear?
-Yes.

435
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,417
Aunt.

436
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,500
What is it? Tell me.

437
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,375
Don't take it the wrong way.

438
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,708
There's a promoter called Mr. Deba,

439
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,250
who has a lot of influence
in the locality.

440
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:01,667
Very dangerous.

441
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:05,542
He often asks me whether
uncle will sell this house.

442
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,583
He will offer a good price. I mean...

443
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:12,125
I can't say this
to uncle directly, but you--

444
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,958
No. I have said this
to him many times before.

445
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,708
Such a big house is tough to maintain.

446
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,125
It's too expensive!

447
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,417
No. Don't worry.

448
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,458
Where did I keep it?

449
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,583
You can stay in our guest room
for a few days.

450
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,000
It's empty.

451
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,125
Yes. We'll meet soon.

452
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,833
What were we supposed to talk about?

453
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,458
You ask such difficult questions
out of the blue.

454
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,458
Okay, fine...

455
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,667
Good night.

456
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,417
Guli is coming tomorrow.

457
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,167
And you have invited Elena?

458
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,792
No.

459
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,958
Elena won't come.
I was just being courteous.

460
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,042
He constantly abuses her.

461
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,375
Let me tell you something, Asim.

462
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,875
You should stay away
from her personal life.

463
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,750
And whether you accept it or not...

464
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,375
You are a public figure.

465
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,458
If people start talking...

466
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,458
You know the media...

467
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,583
I am hardly a public figure!

468
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,125
I just had a couple of pictures
in the papers recently.

469
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:37,167
You are the real celebrity.

470
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,500
Wherever you go, the cameras follow.

471
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:43,333
Couldn't you find anyone else
to translate your work?

472
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,958
Getting a tabloid editor to...

473
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,375
I didn't get her.

474
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,917
Wrik referred her.

475
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,125
She was his colleague.

476
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,125
Guli is coming tomorrow.

477
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,167
And I invited Wrik for dinner.

478
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,875
Open the boot, Subal.

479
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,208
-How are you?
-Good.

480
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,667
Since when did you become so formal?

481
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:11,208
-Please give me the bag.
-No, it's okay.

482
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,917
-Where's Sambhu? Sambhu!
-I'm used to all this.

483
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,083
Sambhu!

484
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:15,625
-Sambhu!
-I am coming.

485
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,583
Where were you?

486
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,250
-On that side.
-Get on up.

487
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,833
Hello, Uncle. How are you?

488
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:20,792
I'm good. And you?

489
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,708
I made your favorite,
poppy seed and potato curry!

490
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,042
<i>There is no coast, no verge</i>

491
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,667
This is not originally a Bengali dish.

492
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,750
The British forced us

493
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,167
to cultivate poppy
during the Chinese opium war.

494
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,500
You are going to lecture her
on poppy seeds too?

495
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,750
She just arrived. Let her freshen up.

496
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,958
Come upstairs with me.

497
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,542
<i>Calling me every time</i>

498
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:52,958
So...

499
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,125
Why are you sulking
in the corner of the room?

500
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,833
Come out and socialize.

501
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,958
Why? I spoke to Uncle.

502
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,875
I've told you so many times, Guli.

503
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,708
Why do you insist on calling him uncle?

504
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,875
Because he isn't my father.

505
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:16,292
But he is concerned about you.
He cares about you.

506
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,625
Maybe he doesn't make it apparent.

507
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,042
Anyway...

508
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,958
He cannot recommend anyone in your family.

509
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,167
He can get someone else to write it.

510
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,583
He has an image to maintain.

511
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,042
Besides,

512
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,417
funding your education abroad without
a scholarship is not possible for me.

513
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,958
Then what's the point of having
a rich and famous father?

514
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,125
I think we should be more careful.

515
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,083
I mean so that no one suspects.

516
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,542
He can slap an adultery charge
at any time.

517
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,875
Aren't you feeling cold?

518
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,875
The weather or my shorts?

519
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,458
There's a difference between
your hostel and this house.

520
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,708
Don't give me lecture, okay?

521
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,625
<i>Staircase</i> or some such shit?

522
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:42,500
Your hot, steamy scenes,
can still be found online

523
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:45,500
if you search for "Indrani Mitra hot!"

524
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,750
All my friends have watched it.

525
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:10,917
So how is your band?

526
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,458
The one before was Cat's Whiskers.

527
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,792
Yes, this one is called "Maati."

528
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,708
Great heavens!

529
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,958
-The band is pretty famous.
-Here.

530
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,167
So, is it folk fusion or something?

531
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,375
Fusion or confusion?

532
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,125
With an English band you
can't make a living here.

533
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,458
Asim!

534
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:46,208
Add two alliterative words
on either side of Maati.

535
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,167
Governmental support will be assured!

536
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,875
Understand what an alliteration is?

537
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,750
Enough about Maati. How's your mother?

538
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,000
Same, no improvement.

539
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,083
There we go again.

540
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,958
She will suffer for as long
as she lives like this!

541
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,458
Why are you saying it like that?

542
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,375
I will speak to Asim.

543
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,750
I'm sure something can be done.

544
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,083
Well, you guys chat,
I'll check on the food.

545
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,583
Are your songs on YouTube?

546
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:44,375
Yes, but if you want to listen to us live,
we have a gig day after tomorrow.

547
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,625
You have no plans of going abroad?

548
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,500
Given mom's health condition...

549
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,292
Yes.

550
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,042
Hey! The dinner is served!

551
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:15,750
Coming!

552
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,458
Where are the geniuses?

553
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,125
Probably smoking a cigarette.

554
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,000
Those aren't cigarettes.

555
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,000
Give me that. Get the rotis.

556
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,250
Come, Wrik.

557
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,125
Come. Sit.

558
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,542
Bulu?

559
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,750
-Yes.
-Won't you eat?

560
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:45,167
Yes. I mean, I don't eat this early.
You all carry on.

561
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,708
I forgot to switch on the pump.

562
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,833
Wrik.

563
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:52,542
Aren't you supposed to go
to Santiniketan the day after?

564
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,333
Yes. To lecture at Viswa Bharati.

565
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,125
Nikhileshda is very insistent.

566
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,333
No.

567
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,458
Palashpur!

568
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,167
Come along, sir.

569
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,125
The same old cold soup...

570
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:37,167
-Give me the medicines. Come on.
-Guli?

571
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,958
See. Come on.

572
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,500
You still haven't learned anything.

573
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:42,958
Let it be.

574
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:43,875
Here you go.

575
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,208
You're really tall!

576
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,917
Have you had lunch?

577
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,833
No, I had a heavy brunch. How are you?

578
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,625
Whether I live or not, how does it matter?

579
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:04,958
Don't say that.

580
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,125
I've always lived in a hostel.

581
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,500
So I haven't really lived
with my mom much.

582
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,500
So it matters to me.

583
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,708
-Guli, come. Mom, we'll be back.
-Okay.

584
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:26,792
Caught you!

585
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,125
Hey! Ms. Dolu!

586
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,125
You've come to Kolkata,
yet you haven't informed me.

587
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:35,208
Sorry, something or the other has
made it difficult to catch up with anyone.

588
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,333
And now both of you are celebrities!

589
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:40,667
Page three reveals everything!

590
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,333
They have to fill up their pages!

591
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,417
Do you have some time

592
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,833
-for a cup of coffee?
-Why not?

593
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,000
-How far?
-Not far, just a bit more.

594
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,292
Come this way.

595
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,750
Careful!

596
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:14,875
Okay.

597
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,375
Make sure you don't touch it.
I'm used to it.

598
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,625
Everyone says my mom looks like my sister.

599
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:30,167
Actually, your mother doesn't look
as if she has a daughter like you.

600
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,208
When she used to visit me at the hostel...

601
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:12,875
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

602
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,500
You still have so many fans.

603
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,125
Won't you act in any more films?

604
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,167
I have never acted in too many films.

605
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,167
Thank you.

606
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:23,250
And now, no one offers me
really interesting roles either.

607
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,625
That's why you have slowly moved away.

608
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,083
Not really.

609
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,458
I feel like acting again!

610
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:31,625
Why don't you do it?

611
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,125
I want to establish the NGO.

612
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,458
I have applied for grants
in several places.

613
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,125
Besides, I don't stay here regularly.

614
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:44,667
There's a boy who stays in your house.
What's his name?

615
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,667
You mean Dhiman?

616
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,583
-Is he Asim's nephew?
-Yes, nephew.

617
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:50,583
Sort of. Distantly related,
but more of a beneficiary!

618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,917
Why do you ask?

619
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:54,667
You mentioned that when you are not here,

620
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,125
your house is rented out to foreigners.

621
00:38:57,708 --> 00:39:00,458
No, sometimes foreign students
stay here temporarily.

622
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,625
B and B. Helps in the maintenance cost.

623
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:06,625
Why do you ask?

624
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:08,167
No, believe me.

625
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,000
I haven't allowed any questionable
characters into the house, by God!

626
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,958
Don't bring God into this!

627
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,917
And what do you mean
by questionable characters?

628
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,833
We don't live here permanently,
so we depend on you.

629
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,542
You looked after Mother
while she was alive.

630
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,542
So, we've allowed you to stay here.

631
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,250
You don't have to act
as a broker for the house!

632
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,417
We know enough people
who can do that competently.

633
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,458
Asim.

634
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:35,208
You may go now.

635
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,000
Let it go, don't say anything else.

636
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,375
I'm going out for a while.

637
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,125
Okay.

638
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:50,083
Kunal called. He is planning a new film.

639
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,500
He wants to narrate the story.

640
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,167
At his place?

641
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,542
Yes.

642
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:58,875
Yes. I told him to come over,
he said his laptop was giving him trouble.

643
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:01,375
The script is in his office computer.

644
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,583
He'll catch up with you another day.

645
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:06,875
What genre?

646
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,042
Thriller!

647
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:13,000
So, Kunal Sen is now making thrillers
instead of complex esoteric stuff.

648
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,792
Will the audience be thrilled?

649
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,500
Does he think that if he narrates the plot
in front of others, it will be exposed?

650
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,792
Directors prefer to narrate
their stories in their own den.

651
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,583
See how secretive your friend is.

652
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:28,375
And you were after me
to tell you my story.

653
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,042
Why, is yours a thriller too?

654
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,750
Mom, I'm off.

655
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,625
<i>Flying with the winds of change</i>

656
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,583
<i>Have looked for the lost face
In hundred ways</i>

657
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,583
<i>The dark night shall end</i>

658
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,958
<i>Was a promise unkept</i>

659
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:10,125
<i>The blues are spreading secretly</i>

660
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,500
<i>I'm flying with the winds of change</i>

661
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:19,375
<i>Have looked for the lost face
In hundred ways</i>

662
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,458
<i>The dark night shall end</i>

663
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>Was a promise unkept</i>

664
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:28,250
<i>The blues are spreading secretly</i>

665
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:33,625
<i>Where the stories make friends
Out of the worms</i>

666
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:37,958
<i>Where the dead river changes
Its hidden bends</i>

667
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,042
<i>Where the stories make friends
Out of the worms</i>

668
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:49,583
<i>Where the dead river changes
Its hidden bends</i>

669
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,708
<i>And then you drown into the darkness</i>

670
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:55,042
<i>As the feeling
Of loss keeps roaming around</i>

671
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,417
<i>A secret</i>

672
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:15,750
It's been going on for many days.

673
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,125
Now, something definite should be done.

674
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,292
I've done everything you have said
and exactly the way you have said.

675
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,333
I've adjusted to all situations.

676
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,583
But how long can it go on like this?

677
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:30,583
For years, you've been making promises
but you've done nothing about it.

678
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:32,875
Now, something concrete needs to be done.

679
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,750
<i>Undercover</i>

680
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:40,708
<i>Hides the mysterious shadow</i>

681
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:45,083
<i>While I look</i>

682
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:49,417
<i>For the misty past</i>

683
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:52,958
<i>In the hidden port of sound </i>

684
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,125
<i>The old ship anchors around</i>

685
00:42:56,042 --> 00:43:00,375
<i>As the winds break the mast! </i>

686
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:03,958
<i>While we look for the nameless address</i>

687
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:06,750
<i>Time takes its toll</i>

688
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:10,500
<i>And time takes its toll</i>

689
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,042
<i>In the hidden port of sound </i>

690
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,917
<i>The old ship anchors around</i>

691
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,417
<i>As the winds break the mast</i>

692
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,750
<i>While we look for the nameless address</i>

693
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,750
<i>Time takes its toll</i>

694
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:31,542
<i>And time takes its toll</i>

695
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:37,667
No one will know exactly what's happened.

696
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:41,542
<i>Where death explodes like a bomb</i>

697
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:45,708
<i>And brings in a feverish sleep</i>

698
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:53,542
<i>Where death explodes like a bomb</i>

699
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:57,583
<i>And brings in a feverish sleep</i>

700
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,125
<i>The lost road finds its path
As it looks around</i>

701
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,917
<i>And tries to touch</i>

702
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,458
<i>The guerrilla mind</i>

703
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,000
Come on, let's go home,
your mom will be livid!

704
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:36,792
-What are you doing here?
-Why can't I come here?

705
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,208
Am I banned from watching
your band perform?

706
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,625
Not that. But we've got to leave,
you enjoy.

707
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,750
Let's go.

708
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:46,375
Come on.

709
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:50,958
My ex-colleague, she's helped Dad
translate <i>The Big Bong Theory</i>.

710
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:52,375
She did an interview with Dad.

711
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:04,458
<i>That the hope kindled by the
Gandhi-Irwin pact was false,</i>

712
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:07,583
<i>Arindam and his companions
were quick to realize.</i>

713
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>Lessons from Jalalabad,
Sholapur and Punjab</i>

714
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,000
<i>showed the path
of true revolution to them.</i>

715
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,167
<i>Binoy would say,</i>

716
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,958
<i>"The path of annihilation
was distracting them</i>

717
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,375
<i>from self-liberation."</i>

718
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,250
<i>Mr. Shankar would ask, "Was Binoy
unaware of the Russian revolution?</i>

719
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:23,583
<i>Or the French revolution?"</i>

720
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,042
<i>Arindam made fun</i>

721
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:28,917
<i>of Binoy because he learned</i>

722
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,958
<i>about Jacobins from Dicken's novel.</i>

723
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:32,958
<i>But aren't novels also history?</i>

724
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,917
Yes, what is it?

725
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,917
What's his name?

726
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,000
You know the person?

727
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,750
When is the meeting?

728
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:57,708
Fine, fourth is Asim's birthday, I'll take
the flight on the evening of the fifth.

729
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:07,792
Come.

730
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:09,833
Look who's here.

731
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,708
There you are Mr. Sen, how did it go?

732
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:13,833
-Good.
-Sit.

733
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,875
No, I won't stay today.

734
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,125
I just came to say hello to you.

735
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,208
You leave early tomorrow.

736
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,792
We'll sit together another day.

737
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,208
Rubbish! Come and sit.

738
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,417
I'll leave you to chat for a while.

739
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:27,042
You can't leave without a drink!

740
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,625
So, you are nothing but a lot of hot air.

741
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,250
You couldn't pull the deal off.

742
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:40,833
The deal would bring good money
for you too.

743
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:43,083
By God, I've spoken to my aunt.

744
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:44,917
She's positive.

745
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:49,083
It's uncle who's acting difficult.

746
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,458
I got caught up in some trouble.

747
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,792
So can't talk to my uncle directly.

748
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:57,458
If I was to depend on you,
I would be finished.

749
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,292
The switch from analog to digital
has surely made things easier?

750
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,333
Our hands are tied, sir.

751
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:05,792
Celluloid has almost disappeared.

752
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,583
I have a philosophical problem,
regarding the digital format.

753
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:14,042
I don't believe in anything that
is solely positive and has no negatives.

754
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:25,083
After all the discussions,
now talking of a syndicate.

755
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,875
-Stop it.
-Sorry!

756
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:32,292
Why don't you talk to him directly?

757
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,333
What were you doing all these days?

758
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,375
Why did you take money from me then?

759
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,500
It's a total loss!

760
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:40,958
Don't I know it.

761
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:44,667
This time uncle is a little too busy.

762
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,708
His book launch, lectures, this and that.

763
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:51,667
And I hear he's leaving
for Bolpur tomorrow.

764
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,125
-He's going to Bolpur?
-Yes.

765
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:57,250
I'll ask someone to bump him off.

766
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,208
What?

767
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,417
Yes, and then there will be peace.

768
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,625
You're joking!

769
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:04,875
We will leave in peace.

770
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,000
<i>Profits were falling for Lancashire,</i>

771
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:15,833
<i>while Indian entrepreneurs
were making money.</i>

772
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,667
<i>But Arindam was not sure
if this was beneficial for the nation.</i>

773
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,250
<i>One should ask which part
of the nation is gaining from it.</i>

774
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:26,958
<i>In our struggle with the foreign rulers
we had to consider the nation undivided.</i>

775
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:31,583
<i>But despair is rising among the poor.</i>

776
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:36,458
<i>It is reaching a point of explosion.</i>

777
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:37,583
<i>Arindam said,</i>

778
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,208
<i>"Many such people were accused of being</i>

779
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,333
<i>Bolshevik spies
in the Meerut Conspiracy case.</i>

780
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,500
<i>They are reading new books.</i>

781
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:50,542
<i>No longer are they interested in
Domenian Status or complete independence.</i>

782
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:54,208
<i>They want to transform the whole system.</i>

783
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:57,167
<i>They have taken a new oath of Socialism."</i>

784
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:00,542
There you are.

785
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,875
Imitating Amartya Sen?

786
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:07,875
You'll fall down and break your bones.

787
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,792
In my college days,
I cycled to Ilambazar once.

788
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,792
To watch Mrinal Sen's shooting.

789
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,958
-So, I'm off.
-Okay.

790
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,333
See you!

791
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,958
Everything is ready I hope?
All arrangements?

792
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,375
Sir, going back to Kolkata?

793
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:37,125
Yes, but via Ilambazar.

794
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,042
Okay.

795
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,750
Are you looking for someone, sir?

796
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:21,292
Whenever we came to Santiniketan
in the past, we came here for picnics.

797
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:22,375
Okay.

798
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,583
We used to play hide and seek
between the pillars.

799
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,750
Someone called Mr. Rakhal
was the caretaker.

800
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:27,667
He was my father!

801
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,500
So you are Rakhalda's son?

802
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,417
Do they still shoot films here?

803
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,167
-Yes.
-No, Kunal.

804
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,708
I don't agree with you at all.

805
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,292
Such a drastic step isn't necessary.

806
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,792
<i>We have to work
for the village's progress.</i>

807
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:06,542
<i>We have to involve the villagers</i>

808
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:09,417
<i>and spread the message everywhere...</i>

809
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:15,042
Hell! What's wrong?

810
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:16,167
Stop!

811
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
You bastard!

812
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,125
Here Indrani, your ticket.

813
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:49,167
All your documents
and photographs are in this folder.

814
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,375
Okay.

815
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,292
Oh, yes. I've spoken to him.

816
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,042
-Okay.
-What are you doing tomorrow?

817
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:00,208
-Why don't you come over as well?
-No.

818
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,583
No.

819
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:06,958
Some friends are also coming.

820
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:11,542
Actually, a friend of mine is in town
and she will leave the day after.

821
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,458
Up to you.

822
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:15,833
But drop in if you can.

823
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:17,667
Anyway...

824
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:25,833
I have to buy a few things
for the evening.

825
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,167
Why do you ask?

826
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,708
There are a few documents
to be signed at ICCR.

827
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:32,958
Of course.

828
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,792
In between my shopping
I'll go over and do it.

829
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:37,125
Alright.

830
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:41,375
At first I had named it,
<i>Last Letter of Ashesh!</i>

831
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:46,125
Now I have changed it to <i>Confession!</i>

832
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:49,958
<i>Confession!</i>
Isn't the name a little old fashioned?

833
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,583
Yes, it's deliberate!

834
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:53,750
I am using archaic language as well.

835
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,542
To get the feel of a certain era...

836
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:03,500
If you use the literary language
of that time, it's better.

837
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:07,083
Indrani, I have a network problem
on my mobile.

838
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,083
I didn't know that.

839
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,708
How strange! Just the other day
I told him to pay the bill. Bulu!

840
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,625
The phone is really dead!

841
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,500
Every single person here is worthless.
No maintenance.

842
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32,875
Why are you getting into this?
I'm looking into it.

843
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,417
What will you do?
Are you a telephone mechanic?

844
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:37,875
The cable line was disconnected.

845
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:39,250
See!

846
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,542
Our maid must have done it while dusting.

847
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:43,667
The other day she had
disconnected my Wi-fi.

848
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,667
<i>I am not scared of death.</i>

849
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,542
<i>But a nightmare swallows me up</i>

850
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,375
<i>when I think of being tortured</i>

851
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,875
<i>in the dark cells of the prison.</i>

852
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,333
<i>I want to die in a moment.</i>

853
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:01,958
<i>A bullet, a sharp stab,
or a stifling of the windpipe.</i>

854
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:07,083
<i>I'm not prepared for the loneliness
of a long period of torture.</i>

855
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,875
Do you want to invest in a Bengali film?

856
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,250
Why? Kunal Sen has lost his producer?

857
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:25,083
Not that, there were two producers,
one of them has some financial problems.

858
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,250
He wants to delay the film.

859
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:29,833
But Kunal doesn't want that.

860
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,708
Not even Kunal Sen's greatest enemy

861
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,667
can ever say
his films have recovered money.

862
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,792
I had thought he was initiating your
comeback because he was a fan of yours.

863
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,958
Now it seems you've been cast
because you are a prospective producer.

864
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,292
You are making a mistake.

865
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,125
He never asked me for funding.
I am asking you on my own.

866
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,208
Here. It's a bit excessive this time.
Hold it!

867
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,792
Always acting cheap!

868
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,542
-Oh, irritating.
-Hello.

869
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,083
Yes, Doludi?

870
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:22,375
-Hello Kushal, all good?
-When are you coming?

871
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,958
No, I'm no longer a spring chicken!

872
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,417
I'll give the phone to him. Hey.

873
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,083
Anyway, thanks.

874
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,542
Hey, Doludi is on the line.

875
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,958
She's in Bombay and can't come,
she called for you.

876
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:35,000
There's another call waiting
Kushal, so I'm hanging up.

877
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,083
Just a second,
I'm giving the phone to him.

878
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:40,458
Hello.

879
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:41,750
Yes, tell me.

880
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:48,667
But too many returns might not be
too good for the health.

881
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,500
Oh, yes.

882
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:56,458
Please speak to Rani,
I've got another call coming.

883
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,458
Thank you, take it.

884
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,000
-Yes Doludi, come another day please.
-Such drama.

885
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:13,750
The maid had done a good thing
by disconnecting the landline.

886
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:17,375
I'm going out, I'll get some
cold cuts for the evening.

887
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:19,542
What grand feast are you planning?

888
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:20,583
Nothing much.

889
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,083
You didn't allow me
to invite all the people.

890
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:27,125
On my way back
I have some work with Janaki.

891
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,375
So, don't wait for me.

892
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,292
-Okay, here it goes.
-One second.

893
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:33,750
This is a great idea.

894
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,500
-Whose idea was it?
-Make a wish.

895
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,292
-Let me know when all of you are ready.
-Be careful.

896
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:41,542
-Come on.
-Ready? Come on.

897
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,875
-Should I cut the cake?
-Yes.

898
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,833
-Blow the candle out first.
-Blow the candle.

899
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:53,292
Oh, not again!

900
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,500
This phone is the bane of my life!

901
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:58,458
Cut the line and cut the cake.

902
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:01,333
If I hang up I'll be hanged.
It's from the headquarters.

903
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:02,708
Sambhu!

904
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:03,958
Who's this great person?

905
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:05,792
-Yes, it's my pleasure
-The CM!

906
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:06,750
Thanks a lot.

907
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,500
Even the Naxalite leader Charu Mazumdar
used to be addressed as CM.

908
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,375
Mr. Asim is going to get at least
a Bangobivishon award.

909
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,750
Bivishon reminds me... Here.
Quite some time back,

910
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,208
-from Asim's Facebook account... Here.
-Thank you.

911
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:21,750
Someone called Meghnad messaged.

912
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,000
Beware! Bivishon is out
on a furious plunder!

913
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,500
The same word used twice in a sentence,
once as a noun and then as an adjective.

914
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,458
-Brilliant!
<i>-The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

915
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:30,542
Right, sir.

916
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,792
So mythological characters are intruding
into social sites these days.

917
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:39,292
I reported it to the cyber cell,
but by then Mr. Meghnad went missing.

918
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,125
Obviously, a fake account!

919
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,125
Then when we were in Oxford...

920
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,458
Things are usually crazy online.

921
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:49,250
A gentleman had once ordered
a penis enlarger online.

922
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:02,833
Okay, come on. Stop the music.

923
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,000
Come, Wrik!

924
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,583
-Let me stab the cake.
-Come on.

925
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,375
Yes, ready.

926
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,458
-Cut!
-Ready.

927
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,958
Not a drop more!

928
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:24,500
You're drunk already!

929
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,417
Are you asking me to bring more liquor?

930
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:45,375
Why do you light the candles
and then blow them off?

931
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,083
In fact, the "Happy Birthday to You"
song is even more irritating!

932
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,375
-Sambhu.
-Look at them.

933
00:59:49,792 --> 00:59:51,500
There the son and father
are drinking together.

934
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,000
And here the nephew has been left out!

935
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,333
Bloody bastards.

936
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,250
Bastards.

937
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,500
Asim Bose's dad

938
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:06,875
had taken land from my grandpa.

939
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,708
And now they are enjoying that money.

940
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,500
Bloody bastards!

941
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:13,333
They have turned me
into a domestic helper!

942
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:16,458
I won't let them off, I won't!

943
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:17,458
You shouldn't.

944
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:20,500
No music or songs on your birthday?

945
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,917
Your mom was from the Tagore family.

946
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,000
Tagore has written
so many songs just for you!

947
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:27,917
What do you mean?

948
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,167
<i>Since endless age
The waves bring in the tide</i>

949
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:36,667
Come on. Asimava Bose,
take your seat at the piano.

950
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:38,708
-Me?
-Yes.

951
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,458
Playing the piano with
one hand is no easy task.

952
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,458
<i>Since endless time</i>

953
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,500
<i>The waves bring</i>

954
01:00:57,917 --> 01:01:00,958
<i>In the tide and ebb</i>

955
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,417
<i>Which swings the world around</i>

956
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,250
<i>Since endless time</i>

957
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:11,333
<i>The waves bring</i>

958
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:14,833
<i>In the tide and ebb</i>

959
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,208
<i>Which swings the world around</i>

960
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:24,125
<i>In my guts lies the blood stream of life</i>

961
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:28,958
<i>Running through my veins</i>

962
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:33,042
<i>This awakens</i>

963
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:37,375
<i>In awe the song within me!</i>

964
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,417
<i>The sky is full</i>

965
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,958
<i>Of the sun and stars</i>

966
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,500
<i>And the universe is brimming with life</i>

967
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:51,958
<i>In the midst </i>

968
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,708
<i>Of it all I've found</i>

969
01:01:54,917 --> 01:02:00,250
<i>I've found my rightful place</i>

970
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:03,875
<i>This awakens</i>

971
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:09,708
<i>In awe the song within me!</i>

972
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:15,750
<i>And the sky is full</i>

973
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:24,250
Oh, my! You sang wonderfully.

974
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:26,875
-I've performed on stage!
-Really?

975
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,333
Yes, the prettiest girl in our locality
joined the youth choir.

976
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:34,958
I followed her and joined the choir
as well. I was not much of a singer.

977
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,083
I was taken for the backup vocals.

978
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:41,583
One day the beauty's handsome
boyfriend came to watch the show.

979
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:44,292
-That broke my heart.
-Such a pity!

980
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,250
But I still remember the tune!

981
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,250
Then let's hear it!

982
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:01,875
What next?

983
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,833
I never met that friend ever again.

984
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,583
I've tried to use this tune
in one of my latest compositions.

985
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,583
These kinds of songs
are a far cry for her.

986
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,542
She sings <i>Hijibiji</i> songs.

987
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:08,417
-I am not hungry.
<i>-The stomach exclaims, we shall eat!</i>

988
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,083
It's authentic <i>Awadhi Biryani.</i>
Come, take a seat please.

989
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,208
Oh, yes!
The smell is half the satisfaction!

990
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:22,375
-For this we must thank the British!
-Why?

991
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,167
What have they got to do with this?

992
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,833
Fortunately, Wajed Ali Shah was exiled
to Calcutta by the British.

993
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,417
And he brought along his army
of cooks too.

994
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,583
That's why we get such wonderful
Awadhi Biryani in Kolkata!

995
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:35,375
Absolutely! And along with
it the local touch, potatoes.

996
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:39,792
Potatoes are an irresistible
shortcoming of Bengalis...

997
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:43,167
I'll go, check it out.

998
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,167
Oh, God!

999
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,542
-Careful. Leave, I'll clear it.
-Let me check.

1000
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:49,500
You don't have to come.

1001
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,000
As if you're concerned about me.

1002
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:51,958
What broke?

1003
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,833
Why can't you be careful?
You've broken the glass.

1004
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:58,250
-Asim will start shouting at you.
-It was not intentional, an accident!

1005
01:04:58,375 --> 01:04:59,458
-Wasn't an accident,
-Shut up.

1006
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,667
-I can still hear you slurring.
-Asim, please.

1007
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,625
My Crate and Barrel wine glasses...

1008
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:06,208
-I'll see to it, please go from here.
-It just slipped from my hands.

1009
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,583
-I'll handle it.
-Listen,

1010
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:11,542
I've often noticed
my whiskey bottles disappearing!

1011
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,125
You think I don't realize
who's been enjoying them?

1012
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,458
-How dare you do this?
-Take him upstairs.

1013
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,167
-Asim, please listen to me.
-Didn't you all drink?

1014
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:24,083
-It's okay. Leave him.
-What are you doing?

1015
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,167
-I'll expose everything. Everything!
-Shut up, please.

1016
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:32,583
-Asim. Please don't create a scene today.
-Asim. Calm down!

1017
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,500
You made the tea?

1018
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,833
Remember, you threw Sambhu out yesterday.

1019
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,792
I don't know where I'll get another help.

1020
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:45,750
Let me ask the maid if she can
manage for a few days.

1021
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,458
Ma'am?

1022
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:51,458
See here's one more birthday gift.

1023
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:54,292
It was lying in the room
downstairs, under the bouquets.

1024
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,208
Let me see.

1025
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:57,792
Who gave it?

1026
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:00,958
I don't know, I found it
while cleaning the room.

1027
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,375
Okay.

1028
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:07,000
Check out who gave me this Nobel prize.

1029
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:13,917
-Strange!
-What happened?

1030
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,375
Another copy of <i>The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

1031
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,208
Really strange.

1032
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:21,583
BEST WISHES FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY
THE SLAYING OF MEGHNAD

1033
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:24,625
Best wishes for your birthday.

1034
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:26,542
-Who sent it?
-There's no name.

1035
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:30,750
What's this?

1036
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,792
"For killing the enemy,
any means is justified."

1037
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:42,458
You are worried about the book?

1038
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,500
This was the second time. So...

1039
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:55,042
That day all the guests
had brought a gift at least.

1040
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:56,792
Except Wrik.

1041
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,667
In that case, who gave you this book?

1042
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,000
Forget it,
and don't ponder over it anymore.

1043
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:07,125
The question that's haunting me
is not who gave it, but why it was given.

1044
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,458
There was no name written on it.

1045
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:13,875
It's one of the four guests
who came that day.

1046
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,875
But who? And what's the motive?

1047
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,125
This seems like a Hercule Poirot case.

1048
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:29,750
Now you are getting me tense.

1049
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,500
I'm on my way to Delhi,
and this will keep haunting me.

1050
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:34,958
When are you coming back?

1051
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,000
The day after, afternoon flight.

1052
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:40,333
Let me get back,
if we feel there is something strange

1053
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,958
and I will inform the police.

1054
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:44,042
What will you tell the police?

1055
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:46,667
That I got a gift.
But who gave it is a mystery?

1056
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,083
Wrik?

1057
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,708
Yes. Tomorrow, at 11:30 sharp.

1058
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,625
Yes, and we have to finalize tomorrow.

1059
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:59,625
Yes, Indrani? Was the flight on time?

1060
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,875
Have you checked the folder properly?

1061
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,375
Then it must've been left
behind in the drawer.

1062
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:26,167
Listen, I think I have a solution.

1063
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,792
I'll go to your house tomorrow,
then scan and e-mail it to you.

1064
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:48,792
Who will come tomorrow?

1065
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:58,292
Three, two, one. Come on. Let's go.

1066
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:03,250
Great!

1067
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:13,000
Yes, Indrani.

1068
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,167
I just scanned and emailed it to you.

1069
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,125
Yes, check it out.

1070
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,583
<i>Staircase?</i>

1071
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,750
Movies, Marx and <i>Maach</i>!

1072
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:42,083
<i>Maach</i>!

1073
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:47,000
Can't help it if one's wife is a Bengali.

1074
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:50,250
She reprimands me in Bengali.

1075
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:11,958
-Okay.
-Staircase.

1076
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:19,875
Sorry, Mr. Asim, I'm a little late.

1077
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:22,667
Tell me.

1078
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:26,958
We were supposed to resume today.

1079
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,167
I forgot.

1080
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,958
I'm not feeling well.

1081
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,417
I'm sorry, it's okay.
I'll come tomorrow or the day after.

1082
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:43,333
No, not for a few days now.

1083
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:53,667
I mean I've told you most
of what I had to say to you.

1084
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,667
If even after that

1085
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:01,417
you feel I need to say more,
then you'll have to wait a while.

1086
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:11,292
No. This is personal.

1087
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,750
The Lit-Fest is scheduled for tomorrow.
Should I ask for the car at 5:00 p.m.?

1088
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,875
No. Cancel that too.

1089
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,833
Cancel that!

1090
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:32,042
Mr. Asim, in the last moment...

1091
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:36,083
The invitations have been sent,
the newspaper advertisements are out.

1092
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,042
And now if you back out,
there'll be a face loss!

1093
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:53,708
A person can fall sick, can't he?

1094
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,583
Explain it to the organizers, please.

1095
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:09,875
<i>The trees here are not akin to ours.</i>

1096
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,042
<i>They are of a different hue.</i>

1097
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,958
<i>Here, the seasons change in another cycle.</i>

1098
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:23,625
<i>I am not sure
what an independent India looks like.</i>

1099
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:26,167
<i>I have not seen its independence!</i>

1100
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:29,958
<i>The independence for which I was ready
to lay down my life</i>

1101
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:32,792
<i>seems to be a distant story.</i>

1102
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:36,750
<i>As if it has happened
in someone else's life.</i>

1103
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:42,417
<i>I no longer know what independence
we were dreaming of.</i>

1104
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,583
<i>I know I am enslaved,</i>

1105
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,667
<i>but those living in "Independent India"</i>

1106
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,125
<i>aren't free either.</i>

1107
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:52,958
<i>We...</i>

1108
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:57,417
<i>Who had united to break the shackles,</i>

1109
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,042
<i>are now living in our own solitude!</i>

1110
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,583
Excuse me?

1111
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,667
You look familiar,
I've seen you somewhere.

1112
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,792
Were you on TV?

1113
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,625
-No I'm at home generally.
-Nonsense!

1114
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,125
POLICE KILLED IN MAOIST BLAST

1115
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:49,875
The flight was delayed by two hours
because of the fog of Delhi.

1116
01:13:58,583 --> 01:13:59,792
What's wrong?

1117
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:01,917
Nothing much.

1118
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,542
Just a writer's block.

1119
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,042
Is that all?

1120
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:10,583
Is that all? You are looking like
this just because you're stuck?

1121
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,500
What?

1122
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,792
Just for a piece of writing, you--

1123
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,417
Asim?

1124
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:33,625
Hey, Asim?

1125
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,833
Asim, what's wrong with you?

1126
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,042
Hey?

1127
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,500
Look at me? Are you okay?

1128
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,500
Yes, I'm okay.

1129
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,667
I just suddenly had a kind of blackout!

1130
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,250
Let me call the doctor.

1131
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:51,542
You need to get some tests done.

1132
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,792
Where's the water?

1133
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:56,500
Bulu? You'll never find them
when you need them. Bulu?

1134
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,583
Asim!

1135
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,583
-What happened?
-I could do nothing.

1136
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,833
Are you unwell? Are you in pain?

1137
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:13,083
Come on, drink some water.

1138
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:14,500
What happened?

1139
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,458
No, nothing.

1140
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:19,583
Just a nightmare.

1141
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,708
What control were you talking about?

1142
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,042
I don't know.

1143
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:32,583
Maybe about a character in my book.

1144
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:35,000
Oh, no.

1145
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:38,917
Today, Madhu has an event
where I have to show my face.

1146
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,417
Please go ahead.

1147
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:43,250
Are you okay?

1148
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,042
Yes, I'm okay.

1149
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,542
Actually,

1150
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:50,458
the deadline for my book is approaching.

1151
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:52,125
Deadline?

1152
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,583
I don't want to hear any excuses.

1153
01:15:58,583 --> 01:15:59,875
It must be done tomorrow.

1154
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:02,875
What do you mean I am in a hurry?

1155
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,708
The date was fixed much earlier.

1156
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,417
Sorry, I'm late. Have you had dinner?

1157
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:22,667
Asim!

1158
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:29,875
Asim!

1159
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:38,958
I had dozed off.

1160
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:51,750
Who's there?

1161
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:54,042
Get in.

1162
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,500
I don't understand why you had
to take a trip on the highway.

1163
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,250
I was done with my work at Viswa Bharati,

1164
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,292
so, I decided to take a ride.

1165
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,125
You didn't you mention this before?

1166
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:14,125
What's the use?

1167
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:16,292
You would have been unnecessarily worried.

1168
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:18,958
And nothing happened to me.

1169
01:17:21,292 --> 01:17:22,208
But...

1170
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,583
Did someone want to kill me?

1171
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,500
CONFESSION

1172
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:42,792
CONFESSION BY ASIMAVA BOSE

1173
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:04,958
Up so early?

1174
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,917
I've been awake all night.

1175
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,250
-The novel...
-Is it over?

1176
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:13,750
Is it ever over?

1177
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:18,042
Why have you started talking in riddles?

1178
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:22,167
The lives of all are tainted
with unsolved riddles.

1179
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,583
Again you've started speaking ambiguously.

1180
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,792
Go for a walk. You'll feel fresh.

1181
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:32,958
I'll make some coffee.

1182
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,083
Are you in the bathroom?

1183
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,167
Where are you?

1184
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,042
Asim?

1185
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:05,958
Are you downstairs?

1186
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:09,208
You've gone out?

1187
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:10,792
Okay.

1188
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:12,458
Do let me know what happens.

1189
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,208
Guli?

1190
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:51,625
Hey, Guli?

1191
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,125
Guli? Wake up!

1192
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:54,542
-Wake up!
-What?

1193
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,083
No.

1194
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,542
I haven't seen uncle go out today.

1195
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:00,375
He went out, the day

1196
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:02,083
-that you had gone to Delhi.
-Hello. Kunal!

1197
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:03,875
Listen, hold on for a second.

1198
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:04,958
Yes? What were you saying?

1199
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:07,792
He went to the lakes,
I think, the day you were in Delhi.

1200
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,708
Go search near the lake area.

1201
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:11,167
Yes, Kunal. Go!

1202
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:14,458
Kunal, could you come over?

1203
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:15,833
It's not clear.

1204
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:18,750
-Did you call Wrik?
-Yes. He said he is coming.

1205
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:20,667
It's been a while.

1206
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,625
I think we should inform the police.

1207
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:23,750
Hello, sir.

1208
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,458
Right, sir.

1209
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,208
I have got the news.

1210
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,333
I've made a preliminary inquiry.

1211
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,458
Yes, sir. He is a VIP.

1212
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:36,542
So I think the Lal Bazaar Missing
Person Squad will take it up.

1213
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,792
-Good morning, sir.
-Mr. Pulak, this way please.

1214
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,042
-You've heard the news too?
-Yes.

1215
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:45,667
Sir, could I please get some information?

1216
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,750
-Information?
-Yes.

1217
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:50,625
I've heard the poet Shakti Chattopadhyay
used to leave for the market

1218
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:53,042
and disappear indefinitely!

1219
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:54,417
He might also...

1220
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:57,958
I mean, talented people
are often eccentric.

1221
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,792
That's why we have called you.

1222
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:03,667
It's a very high profile case.
So, be careful.

1223
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,667
Okay, sir.

1224
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,167
I have been getting calls
from those in high places.

1225
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:08,583
The media is ready to pounce on it.

1226
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:11,875
He had a blood sugar problem.

1227
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,000
The doctor said that he should go
for walks. But he never went.

1228
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:17,417
I would force him.

1229
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:23,333
Has he recently had an altercation
with you or anyone else?

1230
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,375
Not an altercation.

1231
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:26,958
But...

1232
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:29,000
Yes, sir? It's me.

1233
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,958
Two unclaimed bodies came in yesterday.

1234
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,375
One unidentifiable!

1235
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:34,417
One from Bangur and another from Topsia.

1236
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:36,625
I haven't admitted any corpse today.

1237
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,542
I'll check the register immediately.

1238
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:40,042
Ma'am?

1239
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:43,833
Had you noticed anything unusual
in Mr. Asimava's behavior recently?

1240
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,167
Any incidence...

1241
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:47,500
Incident...

1242
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,417
Asimava's birthday
was a couple of days ago.

1243
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:53,917
Our maid found a packet the next day.

1244
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:57,292
Inside it was an edition of
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

1245
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:00,208
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad</i>
by Michael Madhusudan Dutta?

1246
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:01,208
Yes.

1247
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,958
He had received a similar parcel
while at Oxford.

1248
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:10,292
But no one knows who sent it
or gave this gift.

1249
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:15,208
Since then Asimava
had become quiet and disturbed.

1250
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:16,875
A birthday gift?

1251
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,958
Who were the guests at his birthday?

1252
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,333
<i>Breaking news.</i>

1253
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:25,417
<i>Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning
writer Asimava Bose</i>

1254
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,958
<i>has been missing since this morning.</i>

1255
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:31,542
<i>His family has said that he had gone
for a morning walk and didn't return.</i>

1256
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:35,667
<i>Is this an unfortunate accident
or is there something more to it?</i>

1257
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,958
Does he have a history of mental illness?

1258
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:43,125
In that country everyone
visits a psychiatrist.

1259
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,500
But...

1260
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,375
Depression...

1261
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:50,708
He had some bipolar symptoms.

1262
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,292
Quite a few days back, in England,

1263
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:56,333
he woke up screaming in the middle of the
night after he had received this book.

1264
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:57,542
Screamed?

1265
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,250
After receiving the book?

1266
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:02,500
Yes. Yesterday, or the day before,

1267
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,458
he was saying random things in his sleep.

1268
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:08,875
About some pain...

1269
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:12,750
About not being able to do anything
and losing control.

1270
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:13,958
Really?

1271
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,417
He had gone to Santiniketan
a few days back.

1272
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:21,417
Where he narrowly escaped
an accident on the highway.

1273
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:25,583
It was strange, but he later told me

1274
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,542
that someone was trying to kill him.

1275
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:31,458
Did he have enemies?

1276
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:33,833
See...

1277
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,958
I wouldn't know
about any professional rivalry.

1278
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,167
But personally...

1279
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,458
Well, at least I don't know of any.

1280
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,917
Any property or inheritance issues?

1281
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,708
But he has a distant nephew.

1282
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:52,458
He takes care of the house.

1283
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:57,042
He tried contacting promoters
to try and sell this house.

1284
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:00,208
Asim got very angry with Dhiman over this.

1285
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,583
Could we speak to his nephew?

1286
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,667
Yes, sure.

1287
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:05,542
Guli!

1288
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,083
Guli?

1289
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,042
Guli?

1290
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,125
My daughter, Damini.

1291
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,083
She's come for a holiday--

1292
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,292
-Yes. Tell me.
-Listen.

1293
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,417
-Could you get Dhiman?
-Yes.

1294
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,375
-Could I speak to him alone?
-Sure.

1295
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,417
-Thanks.
-Take them to Dhiman's room.

1296
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:20,833
Come along.

1297
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,667
The media is thronging
the front of your house.

1298
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:26,833
I have posted my men.

1299
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:30,042
No one can enter the house
without your permission.

1300
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,625
-Thank you so much.
-And our CP will personally contact you.

1301
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:33,958
My friend, Kunal.

1302
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,375
-Oh. Aren't you a film director?
-Yes.

1303
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,625
Are you here for a bit?
We would like to talk to you too.

1304
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,583
Let's go.

1305
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:43,750
Let's go.

1306
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:48,667
-Our special sources have informed us...
-Don't climb the gate!

1307
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,167
Get lost!

1308
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,958
-You tell me. Tell him!
-Out!

1309
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:58,292
-Why won't you let me in?
-Out!

1310
01:24:58,875 --> 01:24:59,708
Bulu?

1311
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:03,625
There he is.

1312
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,875
What can I do?

1313
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:12,000
My uncle hardly lives here.
And the promoters are after my life.

1314
01:25:12,083 --> 01:25:14,083
That means with your uncle gone...

1315
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,875
No! What are you saying?

1316
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:18,625
I swear by God! I know nothing about this.

1317
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:20,333
What were you doing yesterday morning?

1318
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,917
I had gone to get milk.

1319
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,375
Then I returned and slept for a bit.

1320
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:27,625
Then Guli called me.

1321
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,208
Do you get milk every morning?

1322
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,958
No. Sambhu does.

1323
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:32,292
Who is Sambhu?

1324
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,667
Sambhu used to work here.

1325
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,542
Uncle fired him a few days back.

1326
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:37,542
Why?

1327
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:42,208
He had been drinking.
And then he said some things.

1328
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:44,000
-Do you know where he is?
-No, I don't.

1329
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:46,083
-Really?
-How will I know?

1330
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:50,625
<i>Still no news of Asimava Bose.</i>

1331
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:54,333
<i>The police are searching morgues
and hospitals around the city.</i>

1332
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,750
<i>Combing operations are taking place
all through the city.</i>

1333
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,125
<i>The Chief Minister
has been voicing concern.</i>

1334
01:25:59,542 --> 01:26:02,917
<i>Stay tuned. Updates will be frequent.</i>

1335
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,583
What were you doing this morning?

1336
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:05,958
I had gone for a recce.

1337
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,917
Reiki? You mean meditation?

1338
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:09,583
It's short for reconnaissance.

1339
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,250
I had gone location hunting
for my next film.

1340
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:12,417
That early in the morning?

1341
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,042
Yes, for a scene to be shot
in the morning.

1342
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:15,542
So, when does the shoot begin?

1343
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,417
Shortly. The schedule
has not been finalized.

1344
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:19,750
Dates haven't been finalized yet--

1345
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:24,333
If I see the locations, it makes it
easier for me to write the script.

1346
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,542
Where were you searching for locations?

1347
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:28,958
-Near the banks of the Ganga.
-You had taken a cab?

1348
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,042
-No, my car.
-Do you have a driver?

1349
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,167
A driver that early in the morning?

1350
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,875
Actually, I drive my own car.

1351
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:40,208
It is a cadaverous case.

1352
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:43,500
But we have to keep an eye
on that film director.

1353
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,333
He has no work for quite some time.

1354
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,333
My film distributor friend

1355
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:50,250
informed me the producer
for his new film has backed out.

1356
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:53,917
Did Indrani and Kunal ever have an affair?

1357
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,500
Look for it on Google.

1358
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,333
The things you say, sir.

1359
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,875
A few years ago,
there was a rumor about them.

1360
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:02,417
This created a misunderstanding
between the two.

1361
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,375
They lost all contact for a while.

1362
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,875
According to Kunal's interview,
they met again by coincidence.

1363
01:27:09,042 --> 01:27:13,625
But their attitude towards each other
made me think otherwise.

1364
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,542
Maybe they were secretly
in touch all along.

1365
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:16,500
Yes.

1366
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:19,708
No news from any morgues,
hospitals or police stations yet?

1367
01:27:19,792 --> 01:27:20,667
No.

1368
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,792
But I'm circulating
pictures all around the state.

1369
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,375
We'll be informed if anything comes up.

1370
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,833
How are you sure he's still in Bengal?

1371
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:31,417
No ransom notes or threatening calls.

1372
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:35,208
You had said that he used
to talk about a deadline.

1373
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,417
What was it for?

1374
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,375
He was writing a book in Bengali.

1375
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,625
But I have very little idea about it.

1376
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,083
He said that he would read it to me,
once it was complete.

1377
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,250
Can we read it?

1378
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:48,458
Yes. It's on the laptop.

1379
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,375
We have to take his laptop.

1380
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,750
Should we add the cell phone
to the seizure list?

1381
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:54,917
Seizure?

1382
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:58,000
You can take it.
But it's password protected.

1383
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:00,875
He never shared that with anyone.

1384
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,042
You should speak to Elena.

1385
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:07,667
Elena? Who is Elena?

1386
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,583
Who is Elena?

1387
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,500
Among the guests at the birthday party,

1388
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,958
one may have given two gifts.

1389
01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:17,333
A present up front
and then the book in secret.

1390
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:18,958
Why just the guests?

1391
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,208
Indrani could have planted the book too.

1392
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:22,333
Secretly!

1393
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:25,542
And then there were helpers in the house.

1394
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,292
Would they give something like this book?

1395
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,292
What are you saying?

1396
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:30,875
We had to study this poem for
our Higher Secondary Examinations.

1397
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,125
Very tough!

1398
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,542
Such bombastic words!

1399
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:36,125
Words that meant nothing to me.

1400
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:38,917
And then there was that blanket verse
or something.

1401
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,542
-Blank verse!
-Yes.

1402
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:45,958
The servants might have done it
for someone.

1403
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,958
It's not easy to understand this
as an outsider.

1404
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:53,042
Ms. Indrani had once played
the role of a maid.

1405
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,375
She fit the bill perfectly.

1406
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,958
Are you saying that someone in disguise...

1407
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,458
No.

1408
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:00,625
Not exactly a disguise.

1409
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,417
Someone suddenly appears
in a different identity

1410
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:06,875
and is unrecognizable.

1411
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:07,875
Recognize the bloke?

1412
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:11,792
Looks familiar but I can't recognize him.

1413
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:14,125
Study it carefully.

1414
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,500
That's you!

1415
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,042
I can't recognize you at all.

1416
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,500
You looked like quite the hero.

1417
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:23,083
Yes. I wanted to be an actor
but I became an inspector.

1418
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:24,208
Then I bloated up.

1419
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:27,583
But only the body has bloated,

1420
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,292
not this.

1421
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:30,708
Was that directed at me, sir?

1422
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:33,125
Did he ever seem unduly tense?

1423
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:35,083
Not in the past.

1424
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:38,125
But the last time I met him,
he was behaving strangely.

1425
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:42,333
I don't know if it was tension,
but he canceled a very important event.

1426
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,500
Why? What happened?

1427
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:46,667
I don't know exactly.
Said he was feeling unwell.

1428
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,708
But after speaking to you,

1429
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,667
it seems that this may be
connected to his disappearance.

1430
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,042
So you are certain that
he has disappeared?

1431
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,208
No, I mean until he is found...

1432
01:29:57,833 --> 01:29:59,750
In the course of your interviews
did you come across

1433
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:02,292
anything that could help us
in this investigation?

1434
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:03,583
No.

1435
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:09,208
Whenever I asked him something personal,
he never really opened up.

1436
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:12,042
He didn't even tell you?
But you were so close to Mr. Bose.

1437
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:13,458
What?

1438
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:15,833
It wasn't just
a professional relationship.

1439
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:19,125
Inspector Shome, are you trying
to insinuate something?

1440
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,042
No, not at all.

1441
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,167
What were you doing on
the morning of the incident?

1442
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:24,292
I was at home.

1443
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:26,500
-Are there any witnesses?
-No, I live alone.

1444
01:30:29,917 --> 01:30:32,708
She does stay with me.
But she had taken a day off on that day.

1445
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:35,250
-Okay. May we speak to her?
-Sure.

1446
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:39,458
-Mridul, speak to her later.
-Okay, sir.

1447
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:42,042
Did you give him a book on his birthday?

1448
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:42,958
Yes.

1449
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:44,917
<i>-The Slaying of Meghnad?</i>
-No.

1450
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:48,625
I had given him a book on
the women of the Tagore family.

1451
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:50,542
Why?

1452
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,292
I had forced him to get some
tests done, a few days back.

1453
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,333
The reports have come in today.

1454
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,750
His sugar levels are high.

1455
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:01,958
He must have been under
some severe stress.

1456
01:31:03,042 --> 01:31:05,625
Do you understand where
the police are going with this?

1457
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,208
I mean, have they made any progress?

1458
01:31:07,583 --> 01:31:08,500
I don't think so.

1459
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,917
They were asking me very sharp questions.

1460
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:12,667
Some of them were quite offensive.

1461
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:14,833
They were trying to check my alibi.

1462
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:19,833
But they've been quite
polite with me, thus far.

1463
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:22,500
Who knows whether they suspect me.

1464
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,083
They will come to interrogate Guli today.

1465
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,583
We didn't share that kind of association.

1466
01:31:30,042 --> 01:31:31,292
You mean relationship?

1467
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,750
I am hoping it wasn't a bad relationship?

1468
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,958
Were you at home in the morning?

1469
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,458
I was sleeping.

1470
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,083
Mom came and told me that he's missing.

1471
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:42,167
At what time?

1472
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,667
Did you notice anything with his behavior

1473
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:50,625
that would indicate that he was
about to take a drastic step?

1474
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:54,792
Are you studying now?

1475
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:56,917
-I was.
-And now?

1476
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:58,958
Now...

1477
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:02,833
School?

1478
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,625
In America, they refer
to college as grad school.

1479
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:08,375
It takes a lot of money
to study abroad, doesn't it?

1480
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:14,667
Did you give him a Bengali book
on his birthday?

1481
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:16,125
-Bengali book?
-Yes.

1482
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:17,708
I just got a bottle of wine.

1483
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,833
-Is there any news?
-No.

1484
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:25,292
The police are searching.

1485
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,167
In morgues and hospitals.

1486
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:30,208
Mom, please.

1487
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:32,333
You just say whatever you feel like.

1488
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:35,083
You seem to be defending her
quite vehemently.

1489
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,667
What dad did cannot be justified,
but then...

1490
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:41,792
You were not an easy person to be with.

1491
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,750
-Why are you here? Go live there!
-Would be better for me!

1492
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,625
And I wouldn't have to listen
to you nagging every day.

1493
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:49,625
I'll be late.

1494
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:51,875
What do you do?

1495
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:55,375
I have a band. And sometimes
I organize group trekking.

1496
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:57,583
So, you have no steady income?

1497
01:32:58,042 --> 01:33:00,083
No, I don't have a proper job.

1498
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:01,250
How do you survive?

1499
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,917
Just spare me your fake tears.

1500
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:19,375
You have a lot to gain from his absence.

1501
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,125
I don't imagine that he would
leave me anything in his will.

1502
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:26,500
You are his only child.

1503
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,958
You should be inheriting at least some
of what he owns.

1504
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:33,208
What were you doing on the morning
of the incident?

1505
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,958
I had a show the previous night,
so I reached home late.

1506
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:37,958
It was nearly morning.

1507
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:40,083
A show till the break of dawn?

1508
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,458
Who opened the door for you?

1509
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:43,875
My mother is sick.

1510
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,333
If I rang the bell,
her sleep would have been disturbed.

1511
01:33:47,667 --> 01:33:50,667
So I used my extra key,
entered home and fell asleep.

1512
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:51,958
When did you find out?

1513
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,292
In the morning, at around 10:30 a.m.

1514
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:56,417
Guli had called.

1515
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,083
-Had you given him a gift on his birthday?
-No.

1516
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:01,500
I was there. That's all.

1517
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:05,708
What are you doing on the computer?
Searching on Google?

1518
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:07,458
I'm preparing a chart.

1519
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:11,500
I have downloaded pictures
of all those present on that day.

1520
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:14,250
Only Sambhu and Dhiman are missing.

1521
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:16,083
Let's see what Mr. Google has done.

1522
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:20,292
Now, I will check their motivation
and alibis and then keep eliminating.

1523
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:24,958
Everyone has motives and none
of their alibis are convincing.

1524
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,875
I am pretty smart despite my thick skull.

1525
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:28,792
Indeed.

1526
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,417
Many years ago Byomkesh,
played by Mr. Uttam Kumar

1527
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,958
solved cases with charts like this.

1528
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,417
What to do, sir?

1529
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,042
I've been doing the same thing for years.

1530
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:39,833
No excitement in life.

1531
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:41,167
So...

1532
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:43,292
No. Too much excitement is not good.

1533
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,958
It may lead you to do something
which will get you transferred.

1534
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:47,750
Right you are, sir.

1535
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,333
Oh, one important thing.

1536
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:52,292
We need to keep an eye
on that lady, Elena.

1537
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:55,083
She said that she had given her servant
an off day but...

1538
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:57,292
I had asked ma'am for
a day's off, a month back.

1539
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:59,750
My sister was having a child.

1540
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:03,917
But then she said that
she can't let me leave all of a sudden.

1541
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,583
Because she has a lot of work to do.

1542
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,500
And then, on that day,
she suddenly told me

1543
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:10,750
to go and see the child.

1544
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:14,792
I said the Winter Festival
is next month, I'll go then.

1545
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:19,458
She said I go there.
But she also said to take a day off.

1546
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,917
She gave me some money and told me
to get something for my niece.

1547
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:28,375
Lately, Mr. Asimava has been
speaking to this lady a lot.

1548
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,583
She knows a lot.

1549
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:32,042
Besides,

1550
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:35,625
Asimava may have had
a special relationship with her.

1551
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,167
He has some caliber.

1552
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:40,625
His first wife was five years older.
His second wife is 20 years younger.

1553
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,833
And now a fling with someone
less than half his age!

1554
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:47,208
But we cannot underestimate someone else.

1555
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,833
-The wildcard.
-Who?

1556
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,875
-The film director?
-Good.

1557
01:35:51,292 --> 01:35:54,458
I am changing your name
from Mridul Poyra, to Mridul Poirot.

1558
01:35:54,792 --> 01:35:55,958
You could have been Home

1559
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,625
-instead of Shome, sir.
-Holmes!

1560
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:02,542
Why just the surname,
let's change everything!

1561
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:05,333
Sharalakhya Home, Sherlock Holmes.

1562
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:06,833
Have you read <i>Parashuram</i>

1563
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,542
-by Raj Shekhar Basu?
-Yes.

1564
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:10,750
Our trekking plan has gone for a toss.

1565
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:22,750
When you were doing the recce,
were people around?

1566
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:25,708
Yes, there were a few.

1567
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:29,958
But I don't think anyone noticed me.

1568
01:36:30,042 --> 01:36:31,417
But you are a celebrity.

1569
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:34,042
Someone should have recognized you.

1570
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:38,208
Right, but those who were there
probably don't watch my films.

1571
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:39,625
You can check the mobile location.

1572
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:43,625
Did you call anyone from there,
or receive a call?

1573
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,583
Yes, Indrani knew I was going
for a recce, she had called.

1574
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:48,875
-That early! To wish you good morning?
-No.

1575
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:52,750
To ask whether the light condition
was suitable or not for shooting.

1576
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:56,292
Indrani is very involved
with the film, so...

1577
01:36:57,125 --> 01:36:58,458
You can check my call record.

1578
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:00,208
Was your all call recorder on?

1579
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:04,042
My phone may be smart, but I'm not.
I am confused with technology.

1580
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:08,333
Then we can't find out
what you two spoke about.

1581
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:11,208
Did you give him <i>The Slaying of Meghnad</i>
on his birthday?

1582
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:14,458
No, I gave a <i>Kheror Khata</i> CD
by Satyajit Ray's.

1583
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:17,542
Of all things why should I give him
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad?</i>

1584
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,208
In fact, why should anyone?

1585
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,208
-That is the "question."
-It's pronounced question.

1586
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:25,167
Yes, the big "S" debacle.

1587
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,167
I'll make a move now, take care.

1588
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,250
-Yes, let's go.
-Yes.

1589
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:33,125
-Guli?
-Yes.

1590
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:37,083
Take care of your mom
and yourself as well.

1591
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:45,583
-Janaki, listen.
-Yes.

1592
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:51,208
Janaki, just inform all concerned
that I can't think of anything else now.

1593
01:37:51,292 --> 01:37:53,250
-Okay, I'll send e-mails to all.
-Thank you.

1594
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,042
-See you.
-Okay.

1595
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:56,750
-Bye.
-Sure.

1596
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,917
-We'll be in touch.
-See you again.

1597
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,875
-Let us know if there's any information.
-Yes.

1598
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,333
Mom?

1599
01:38:10,875 --> 01:38:12,792
The day before he left,
he was saying something.

1600
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:18,500
A lot of his life is unknown to me.

1601
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:20,875
-Shall I say something?
-Yes, go on.

1602
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:28,083
Will it be appropriate to talk to her now?

1603
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,583
Why weren't you answering the phone?

1604
01:38:30,667 --> 01:38:33,625
I kept the phone on silent mode
to avoid the media!

1605
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:35,750
They are continuously calling.

1606
01:38:36,042 --> 01:38:38,500
They are seeking permission
to go to my home. Disgusting.

1607
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,125
I could hardly get in,
the way they were crowding around.

1608
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:46,292
-Has the police said anything to you?
-No.

1609
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:49,500
I heard on television
massive search operations are on.

1610
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,250
Inspector Shome and his assistant
are coming.

1611
01:38:52,542 --> 01:38:53,750
Thomson and Thompson!

1612
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:56,125
You weren't present at the birthday party.

1613
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,833
And so not really within the scope
of our investigations.

1614
01:38:58,917 --> 01:39:01,667
Nevertheless, I heard you come
to this house regularly.

1615
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:03,417
Twice a week, for two hours.

1616
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:08,208
We thought you could give us
some information.

1617
01:39:08,292 --> 01:39:09,458
-From me?
-Yes.

1618
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:17,625
See, I've been working with Indrani
for the last one and half years.

1619
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:20,625
And this was the first time
I met Mr. Asimava.

1620
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:25,375
Did you notice anything about him,
that might help us in the case?

1621
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:27,083
No...

1622
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:29,667
I haven't seen anything unusual about him.

1623
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:35,083
Have you ever seen Indrani
and Asimava fighting?

1624
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:43,292
Was Asimava's relation with Elena,
more than professional?

1625
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:46,333
These are personal matters,
so I have no clue.

1626
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,875
Do you know Kunal Sen, the film director?

1627
01:39:51,167 --> 01:39:53,958
Not personally, but I had met him
at an art exhibition.

1628
01:39:54,042 --> 01:39:55,083
He's Indrani's friend.

1629
01:39:55,917 --> 01:39:59,208
Just a friend or her boyfriend?

1630
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:04,625
<i>-Confession?</i>
-Yes.

1631
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,833
It was in the top drawer.

1632
01:40:07,417 --> 01:40:09,250
This is the first time
I opened it after he left.

1633
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,875
Was he writing this?

1634
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:12,917
So it seems.

1635
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:16,083
I had a feeling, you know.

1636
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,833
We can learn a lot from his last writing.

1637
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:22,625
That is why I was trying
to unlock the laptop.

1638
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,000
Now, it seems
that he wanted you to read it.

1639
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:30,792
When the laptop is password protected,
why would he leave the printout openly?

1640
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:33,708
Inspector Shome wants the writing.
I have to give it to him.

1641
01:40:35,208 --> 01:40:37,167
-May I say something?
-Yes.

1642
01:40:37,542 --> 01:40:39,167
Will you let me read this first?

1643
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,708
Don't give it to the police right now.

1644
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:45,333
If we can decode something
from the manuscript...

1645
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:49,458
It's for our own good.

1646
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:52,292
We are at the top of their suspect list.

1647
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:56,500
-Take it, but get it photocopied.
-Thanks.

1648
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:00,458
By the way, any clue about
who gave that book?

1649
01:41:00,542 --> 01:41:01,375
No.

1650
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:08,750
Do you know what
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad</i> is all about?

1651
01:41:11,042 --> 01:41:13,458
-You are involved in the art business?
-I am a curator.

1652
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:15,833
I paint too.

1653
01:41:17,417 --> 01:41:18,875
I dabble in calligraphy also.

1654
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,667
He has a lot of caliber, it seems.

1655
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:24,708
You've known Asimava for quite some time?

1656
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:27,417
I used to be a Math teacher in England.

1657
01:41:27,833 --> 01:41:30,458
And that's where I met him
and then we got closer.

1658
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:33,167
So there is no clash between
art and arithmetic?

1659
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,958
Were you in regular touch with him?

1660
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,958
He inaugurated our art exhibition.

1661
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:45,583
The last I saw him
was at his birthday party.

1662
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:48,375
Last? So, you are sure
you're not going to see him again?

1663
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:49,542
No, I mean--

1664
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:53,083
Do you know of anyone
who would want to harm him?

1665
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:55,083
How should I know?

1666
01:41:55,167 --> 01:41:58,333
-Did you give him a gift on his birthday?
-Yes, a painting.

1667
01:41:58,958 --> 01:42:02,250
Along with it a copy of
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

1668
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,958
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad?</i> No, not at all.

1669
01:42:06,542 --> 01:42:08,583
Why this strange question?

1670
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,375
Because someone had
given that book to him.

1671
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,500
But we don't yet know who.

1672
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:16,958
By the way, where were you
in the morning of December 9?

1673
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:20,375
December 9?

1674
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:27,750
There was an art workshop
at Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan.

1675
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,375
I was most probably there.

1676
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,083
Probably?

1677
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:37,458
Yes.

1678
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:39,125
That means,

1679
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,375
if Bivishan hadn't betrayed Ravana

1680
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:44,250
and joined Ram's team,

1681
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:46,750
Laxman would never have been able
to kill Meghnad!

1682
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:51,958
Yes.

1683
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,292
Guli!

1684
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:58,250
Madhusudan has no connection
with Ram, Ravana or Meghnad.

1685
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:01,583
Don't you remember when you were a kid,

1686
01:43:01,667 --> 01:43:03,875
your grandmother told the stories
of <i>Ramayana</i> and <i>Mahabharata</i>?

1687
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:05,833
I was a kid then, Mom.

1688
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:08,750
I remember the basic storyline
from the comic books.

1689
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:11,583
Meghnad was praying

1690
01:43:12,208 --> 01:43:13,667
in a secret cave.

1691
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:18,083
Laxman entered the cave with Bivishan
and killed Meghnad!

1692
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:27,583
And <i>The Slaying of Meghnad</i>
is a modern epic!

1693
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:31,417
The difference is,

1694
01:43:31,875 --> 01:43:36,208
here Meghnad is the hero
and Ram has been de-glorified!

1695
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:40,083
At one point, Meghnad's wife Promila says,

1696
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:42,458
"Am I scared of the beggar Raghav?"

1697
01:43:42,542 --> 01:43:47,375
Under the present circumstances,
they might ban this book someday!

1698
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,083
Well,

1699
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:52,292
Michael Madhusudan Dutta,
was inspired by John Milton's

1700
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:54,375
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, written in blank verse.

1701
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:57,667
Explain.

1702
01:43:58,042 --> 01:44:00,292
Blank verse is... What to say?

1703
01:44:00,375 --> 01:44:02,125
There's no rhyme at the end of each line.

1704
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:06,292
I mean, the lines don't rhyme.

1705
01:44:07,042 --> 01:44:08,375
You remember, don't you?

1706
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:15,708
"After a long wait, Arindam speaks

1707
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:17,250
out in sadness,

1708
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:19,250
now I know

1709
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,667
-how--"
-Hold on!

1710
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,542
Arindam...

1711
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:24,625
What happened?

1712
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:31,750
While reading Asim's manuscript,

1713
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:34,458
one name kept cropping up,

1714
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:36,458
Arindam!

1715
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:43,208
Is this just a coincidence?

1716
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:47,333
Hello, Jharkhand police?

1717
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:58,333
-Got disconnected?
-Okay, let me check.

1718
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:02,250
Remove "the"
and pronounce "police" better.

1719
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,542
There's a lot of pressure
from the authorities.

1720
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:05,833
We must get to the bottom of this.

1721
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:07,708
I can't figure out what's happened.

1722
01:45:08,042 --> 01:45:10,625
If it was a case of kidnapping,
then there should've been a ransom call.

1723
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:12,667
Indrani is perhaps
not revealing everything

1724
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:15,083
or maybe she is concerned
about Asim's security.

1725
01:45:16,042 --> 01:45:19,417
Oh, I checked the train passenger list
and found out

1726
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:23,167
that Nikhilesh had returned a day earlier.

1727
01:45:23,667 --> 01:45:26,667
That means he was in Kolkata
on the day of the incident!

1728
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:30,083
A couple of days before his disappearance,
he was saying strange things

1729
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:31,667
about death.

1730
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,708
Has he ever before...

1731
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:35,542
No.

1732
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:37,292
Nothing of that kind.

1733
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:40,875
But the doctor had said
he suffers from manic depression.

1734
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:42,833
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1735
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:44,583
He is on regular medication.

1736
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:50,292
But all creative people suffer
from depression.

1737
01:45:51,417 --> 01:45:53,958
He used to keep everything within him.
Didn't want to share his thoughts.

1738
01:45:56,667 --> 01:46:00,917
CONFESSION BY ASIMAVA BOSE

1739
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:34,292
Yes, I remember,
he used to wake up shouting!

1740
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,042
While in college,

1741
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:40,250
he got involved
with the political movement.

1742
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,875
-Okay.
-Yes.

1743
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:44,208
He told me...

1744
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:48,292
He got disillusioned later.

1745
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:49,333
-Please...
-Thank you!

1746
01:46:49,958 --> 01:46:51,625
He was once jailed also.

1747
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:54,792
I think that trauma used to haunt him.

1748
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,500
But he didn't want to discuss all that.

1749
01:47:01,458 --> 01:47:05,625
A few days before he left,
Asim kept saying some weird things.

1750
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:11,500
I now feel that some
things from his past were haunting him.

1751
01:47:12,542 --> 01:47:14,542
Actually, that's why I'm here.

1752
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:26,292
THE SLAYING OF MEGHNAD

1753
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:31,042
CONFESSION

1754
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,542
ARINDAM

1755
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:43,500
I'm in a tough spot.

1756
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,958
The person I voted for
has now taken all my notes.

1757
01:47:47,208 --> 01:47:49,375
I would've settled things
with you earlier.

1758
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:53,292
But the demonetization hit me hard.

1759
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:56,292
I'm also stuck in a weird situation.

1760
01:47:56,625 --> 01:47:57,583
What's wrong?

1761
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:01,625
You must have heard,
my writer friend Asimava Bose

1762
01:48:02,583 --> 01:48:04,208
has been missing for quite a few days.

1763
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:06,667
Yes, it's all over the news.

1764
01:48:07,125 --> 01:48:13,542
I had told the police that on December 9
the day Asimava disappeared,

1765
01:48:14,292 --> 01:48:15,792
I was in Santiniketan.

1766
01:48:15,875 --> 01:48:16,750
Okay.

1767
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:20,417
But the police checked
the passenger list of the train

1768
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,750
and found out that I had come
to Kolkata before that.

1769
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:27,542
Coincidentally, our handover
was also on the 9th.

1770
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:29,875
That's really bad...

1771
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:33,167
After all it is public property,
and in the eyes of the law, illegal.

1772
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:36,125
I hope we are not exposed.

1773
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:37,750
I read Asim's writing.

1774
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:43,042
It's the confession of a freedom fighter
called Ashesh, from the 1930's.

1775
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:46,042
There's an uncanny resemblance
with <i>The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

1776
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:50,083
In both, the protagonist is called
Arindam, and in both, he is killed.

1777
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:52,708
But what's most interesting is...

1778
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:54,542
What?

1779
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:57,083
Both were betrayed!

1780
01:48:59,292 --> 01:49:00,917
What the hell are you doing?

1781
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,958
Going through the book launch photos.

1782
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:04,375
Why now?

1783
01:49:04,708 --> 01:49:07,708
Sarama said if we can get
in touch with one Sirajul

1784
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:09,500
we might get to know a lot.

1785
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:13,167
You mean Sirajul Islam,
the erstwhile firebrand Naxalite?

1786
01:49:15,167 --> 01:49:16,875
I have a feeling he was there.

1787
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:20,667
Do you have any idea where he lives?

1788
01:49:20,917 --> 01:49:22,958
-In Bulgaria.
-What?

1789
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:25,417
I mean, Belghoria! It's an old joke!

1790
01:49:25,667 --> 01:49:28,708
Get hold of the address please.
And check out the photos as well.

1791
01:49:28,792 --> 01:49:29,625
Let me see.

1792
01:49:31,417 --> 01:49:32,667
Is that him?

1793
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:34,708
Yes. There he is.

1794
01:49:36,042 --> 01:49:37,458
He looks really old.

1795
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,542
-What is this guy doing here?
-Who?

1796
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:43,000
That's why he looked so
familiar the other day.

1797
01:49:43,792 --> 01:49:47,667
-What are you talking about?
-Just a second, Kunal.

1798
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:53,000
<i>When God is with us</i>

1799
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:57,792
<i>Every problem will be solved</i>

1800
01:49:57,875 --> 01:50:02,625
<i>Let us all go to His temple</i>

1801
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:09,125
<i>Let us all go to His temple</i>

1802
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:24,125
LITTLE MAGAZINE LIBRARY AND LABORATORY
FOUNDED: 23RD JUNE 1978

1803
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:27,625
-Is there anyone there?
-Yes, what do you want?

1804
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:28,708
Here you go.

1805
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:32,083
There are hundreds of little magazines.

1806
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:35,500
And every day some of them are visiting.

1807
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:37,958
It is difficult to tell.

1808
01:50:38,167 --> 01:50:39,833
Someone by this name...

1809
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:42,292
Do one thing.

1810
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:46,000
Send the photograph on WhatsApp,
I'll try to locate the person.

1811
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:46,917
Okay.

1812
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:51,333
Does Sirajul Islam live here?

1813
01:50:52,083 --> 01:50:52,917
Come!

1814
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:55,958
This is his new address.

1815
01:50:56,083 --> 01:51:00,542
A leftist friend of mine gave me
his whereabouts.

1816
01:51:00,792 --> 01:51:02,208
-He told me...
-Looking for someone?

1817
01:51:02,292 --> 01:51:04,125
-Sirajul Islam.
-Room number 32.

1818
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,333
Thank you! Come.

1819
01:51:06,167 --> 01:51:09,750
A highly disillusioned guy
who is still stuck to his old baggage.

1820
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:14,333
A hardcore atheist.

1821
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:16,375
Careful.

1822
01:51:16,875 --> 01:51:19,708
However, we need these vocal rationalists.

1823
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,750
Just the other day
I heard on television...

1824
01:51:24,292 --> 01:51:26,250
-Which way is Room 32?
-This way.

1825
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:27,917
Thank you, be careful.

1826
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:30,875
There are many ready
to be a human bomb in search of heaven.

1827
01:51:30,958 --> 01:51:32,958
-Yet hell is more interesting!
-She is Indraini, right?

1828
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,667
I've given my friend the
photograph of that guy as well.

1829
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,583
Who?

1830
01:51:36,667 --> 01:51:38,250
The one you said who came
to the book launch!

1831
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:40,250
-Oh, yes!
-Just taking a chance!

1832
01:51:42,625 --> 01:51:46,250
Sarama said Asim and you
had an argument once?

1833
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:51,083
Oh yes, we were young, and not so cynical.

1834
01:51:51,417 --> 01:51:55,167
I could see why comrades
like Asim were disillusioned!

1835
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:58,958
But leaving everything and going abroad...

1836
01:51:59,542 --> 01:52:02,750
I couldn't accept the justification
of these revisionists.

1837
01:52:03,083 --> 01:52:05,792
Dialectical materialism
became worldly materialism.

1838
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:10,250
"The Bengali was arguing then feeding
on gourd cooked in poppy seeds!

1839
01:52:10,417 --> 01:52:15,417
While in faraway Cuba, Fidel Castro
was being hailed for his deeds!"

1840
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:22,125
These words may not be palatable
under the circumstances.

1841
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:24,833
Sarama also mentioned another person.

1842
01:52:25,167 --> 01:52:30,083
But I couldn't remember his name exactly,
Arijit or Abhijit...

1843
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:32,458
Indrajit. Indrajit Choudhury.

1844
01:52:32,542 --> 01:52:35,750
He was killed in a police encounter
in Kalikapur, Birbhum!

1845
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:39,708
At one time,
he was Asim's comrade in arms.

1846
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:41,958
He was also close to me.

1847
01:52:42,042 --> 01:52:43,083
What exactly happened?

1848
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:46,875
Encounter! One of the many victims
of Shunu Guha Thakurata.

1849
01:52:47,292 --> 01:52:48,958
That Shunu has written a book!

1850
01:52:49,375 --> 01:52:51,500
<i>The Right Me or The Wrong Me!</i>

1851
01:52:52,917 --> 01:52:54,083
Is this Mr. Shunu still alive?

1852
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,250
I presume so.

1853
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,917
If he had died, I would've heard of it.

1854
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,667
<i>Excuse me, just ask once please.</i>

1855
01:52:59,917 --> 01:53:02,792
No, I can't. Please don't disturb.

1856
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:04,667
Who's that?

1857
01:53:04,917 --> 01:53:08,500
A salesman with some water purifier.

1858
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:12,292
I told him not to disturb.

1859
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:14,417
What is the policeman at the gate doing?

1860
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,458
He must have gone off to have tea,
as usual.

1861
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,958
I don't know what to do with Dhiman!

1862
01:53:20,917 --> 01:53:22,250
He got rid of the gatekeeper.

1863
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:24,083
Strange people are barging into the house.

1864
01:53:24,208 --> 01:53:28,208
Another man had also come once,
he had a limp.

1865
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:31,250
It was on sir's birthday.

1866
01:53:33,167 --> 01:53:34,292
Who's that again?

1867
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:37,083
I had to answer the bell
so many times since morning.

1868
01:53:39,958 --> 01:53:42,708
Who are you? Where are you from?

1869
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:45,208
Badal Biswas from Srirampur.

1870
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:48,083
I've come to meet Professor Bose.

1871
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:49,458
Do you have an appointment?

1872
01:53:49,708 --> 01:53:52,000
Yes, I've spoken to him.
Would you please call him?

1873
01:53:52,083 --> 01:53:53,083
Okay, come in.

1874
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:54,458
It's you?

1875
01:53:54,917 --> 01:53:56,792
I'm sorry, Professor Bose.

1876
01:53:56,958 --> 01:53:59,250
I told you to call.

1877
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:03,958
I called yesterday,
but your landline was dead.

1878
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:06,042
I live far away.

1879
01:54:06,458 --> 01:54:08,583
I came to Kolkata today,
so I took a chance.

1880
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:11,208
Just coming here
without notice creates a problem.

1881
01:54:11,292 --> 01:54:12,500
Besides, there's an occasion...

1882
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:13,667
I am sorry, sir.

1883
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:17,583
Okay then, I'll call and come another day.

1884
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:19,583
He had a limp?

1885
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,167
Yes, he had a limp.

1886
01:54:23,667 --> 01:54:25,500
See if it's this person.

1887
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:28,917
-Which one?
-This guy to the left.

1888
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:31,167
Yes, that's him.

1889
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:33,292
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sure.

1890
01:54:34,042 --> 01:54:35,167
What's the news on your uncle?

1891
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:39,167
I don't think the police can find him.

1892
01:54:39,708 --> 01:54:44,583
He was a dirty bugger,
someone must have bumped him off!

1893
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:49,375
Oh, long discussions with that young girl
behind the closed door.

1894
01:54:49,708 --> 01:54:50,875
There was something going on.

1895
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,917
That girl was quite hot.

1896
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:56,917
What's the use?
He can't get sexually aroused.

1897
01:54:58,125 --> 01:54:59,125
How did you know?

1898
01:54:59,542 --> 01:55:00,458
Listen.

1899
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:03,000
I haven't been to your room in so long!

1900
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,417
No.

1901
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,917
Don't come now.
The police are looking for you.

1902
01:55:07,458 --> 01:55:09,375
I've told them I'm not in touch with you.

1903
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:12,792
They know of your fight with Uncle.

1904
01:55:12,875 --> 01:55:14,917
If they catch you, they'll lock you up.

1905
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:19,042
Scotch has spoilt my habit,
local liquor is no longer good to me.

1906
01:55:19,667 --> 01:55:20,625
Local liquor.

1907
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:22,625
Why don't you get me some scotch?

1908
01:55:50,292 --> 01:55:52,125
There's one thing
that's been constantly running

1909
01:55:52,208 --> 01:55:53,667
in my head since we met Sirajul.

1910
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:55,958
What is it?

1911
01:55:57,958 --> 01:56:02,292
Probably nothing much,
or it could be the clue to everything.

1912
01:56:03,542 --> 01:56:04,875
A strange convergence...

1913
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:07,583
Meghnad in <i>The Slaying of Meghnad,</i>

1914
01:56:07,875 --> 01:56:09,250
Arindam in Asim's writing

1915
01:56:09,917 --> 01:56:11,167
and his old comrade Indrajit.

1916
01:56:13,458 --> 01:56:14,500
I don't quite follow, Kunal.

1917
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:18,417
Meghnad, Arindam and Indrajit,

1918
01:56:18,917 --> 01:56:21,375
these are different names
of the same person.

1919
01:56:22,333 --> 01:56:25,333
Now the question is,
is it a mere coincidence

1920
01:56:26,125 --> 01:56:27,917
or is this a clue to the mystery?

1921
01:56:29,042 --> 01:56:30,583
Mystery of Meghnad's Death.

1922
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:34,792
Listen, just return my house keys.

1923
01:56:37,542 --> 01:56:38,542
I was really scared!

1924
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,083
Putting a Psycho poster
on your bathroom door

1925
01:56:42,167 --> 01:56:44,333
and taking a shower, that's not really on.

1926
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:49,583
You sacked the maid.

1927
01:56:49,875 --> 01:56:51,375
So thought I would give you a surprise.

1928
01:56:52,375 --> 01:56:53,542
You sacked her for nothing.

1929
01:56:54,125 --> 01:56:56,667
Who told her to babble it
all out to the police?

1930
01:56:57,208 --> 01:56:58,042
And by the way,

1931
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,667
you insisted on staying the night.

1932
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,083
So I was forced to give her a day off.

1933
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:03,208
Just a second,

1934
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:05,250
so now it's all my fault, isn't it?

1935
01:57:07,292 --> 01:57:08,125
Wrik?

1936
01:57:08,417 --> 01:57:10,667
If Akash finds out about this,
he'll create chaos.

1937
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,792
And on top of that, he suspects
I'm having an affair with Mr. Asim.

1938
01:57:17,417 --> 01:57:19,458
Akash is only suspecting, but I'm sure.

1939
01:57:20,042 --> 01:57:20,875
What?

1940
01:57:21,292 --> 01:57:22,917
You must have done some
sting operation on dad,

1941
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,500
and blackmailing him, that's fine.

1942
01:57:24,833 --> 01:57:26,417
But, just give me my share.

1943
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:29,625
Where have you hidden him?

1944
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:34,833
Your father writes sci-fi
and you could try detective stories!

1945
01:57:38,375 --> 01:57:40,875
Yes, I understand,
but it's been quite some time.

1946
01:57:41,292 --> 01:57:43,417
-Yet there's no definite progress.
-Sir.

1947
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:45,792
I'm regularly getting calls from Nabanna!

1948
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,250
Either dead or alive,
there's no trace of him!

1949
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:52,792
Even if he is alive, we aren't sure
whether he is still in this country.

1950
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,792
He cannot be in hiding so easily.

1951
01:57:59,042 --> 01:58:00,375
He's a high profile person.

1952
01:58:00,458 --> 01:58:02,667
His disappearance has created
a buzz in the national media too.

1953
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,417
And we're bearing all the flak!

1954
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:08,583
A case like this
cannot be opened and shut.

1955
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:09,958
What do you suggest, ma'am?

1956
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:12,458
So, I think
we should hand over the case to CBI.

1957
01:58:13,042 --> 01:58:14,708
Let them do what they can from Delhi.

1958
01:58:21,167 --> 01:58:24,500
You want to make a bioscope,
featuring the Naxalites.

1959
01:58:24,958 --> 01:58:26,000
And you will insult me?

1960
01:58:26,083 --> 01:58:27,125
-Am I right?
-No.

1961
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:28,583
This is not that kind of film.

1962
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:31,750
It'll not be judgmental.

1963
01:58:31,833 --> 01:58:33,958
An entire generation has gone wasted.

1964
01:58:34,667 --> 01:58:37,458
Why couldn't they study, get a job

1965
01:58:37,542 --> 01:58:39,792
and establish themselves?

1966
01:58:39,917 --> 01:58:42,833
But no, they had to revolt!

1967
01:58:43,917 --> 01:58:44,792
Progressive!

1968
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,917
I've seen enough.

1969
01:58:48,167 --> 01:58:49,375
They killed so many cops.

1970
01:58:49,458 --> 01:58:50,625
Innocent people.

1971
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,958
That is true--

1972
01:58:53,042 --> 01:58:54,125
Will you show that?

1973
01:58:55,958 --> 01:58:58,917
Are we expected to sit
by while they kill us?

1974
01:58:59,292 --> 01:59:01,375
-So...
-And nowadays there's that rubbish.

1975
01:59:01,458 --> 01:59:04,167
Protest of University's students!
Over smart buggers.

1976
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:05,708
Sir?

1977
01:59:06,333 --> 01:59:08,667
Do you remember someone called Indrajit?

1978
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,667
Indrajit? Had I killed him?

1979
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,667
Yes.

1980
01:59:12,958 --> 01:59:13,958
Look...

1981
01:59:14,333 --> 01:59:16,583
I don't remember the case.

1982
01:59:16,667 --> 01:59:18,625
He was the prime suspect
in the Baranagar case.

1983
01:59:20,167 --> 01:59:22,875
-Indrajit Choudhury.
-Yes, right.

1984
01:59:23,292 --> 01:59:27,583
He would use an alias for all his crimes.
That's why I couldn't recollect.

1985
01:59:27,875 --> 01:59:30,625
He was hiding in the broken palace
near Kalikapur.

1986
01:59:31,208 --> 01:59:33,917
-Kalikapur?
-Yes. Kalikapur. Near Santiniketan.

1987
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,625
I got the local force to kill him.

1988
01:59:35,875 --> 01:59:38,333
He was a tough guy.

1989
01:59:38,625 --> 01:59:42,750
Thank God he's dead.

1990
01:59:43,292 --> 01:59:45,375
He had got us chasing tails.

1991
01:59:45,708 --> 01:59:50,083
Have you seen the news
about Asimava Bose--

1992
01:59:50,167 --> 01:59:51,750
-Yes. The writer?
-Yes.

1993
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:54,667
Was he ever involved
in the politics of the time?

1994
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:56,583
Asimava...

1995
01:59:58,167 --> 02:00:00,375
-Was his father a bureaucrat?
-Yes.

1996
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:03,958
Yes, correct.

1997
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:07,417
He wasn't involved in direct action.

1998
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:08,750
He was in planning.

1999
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:13,208
All the bright young men of the time
had been brainwashed.

2000
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,750
But he was a clever one.

2001
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:19,875
He fled the country at the right time.

2002
02:00:20,125 --> 02:00:22,292
If his father hadn't been a bureaucrat,

2003
02:00:22,917 --> 02:00:25,667
he would have faced trouble
and lost his life.

2004
02:00:25,833 --> 02:00:26,667
Okay, bye.

2005
02:00:26,833 --> 02:00:28,292
My guests are here.

2006
02:00:28,583 --> 02:00:29,833
Come here.

2007
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:33,875
-One minute sir. One last--
-What now?

2008
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:37,292
Where can I get more information
about them?

2009
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:39,292
I didn't know about the internal affairs.

2010
02:00:39,583 --> 02:00:42,500
I was given information
and I would act upon it.

2011
02:00:42,792 --> 02:00:45,000
But we had some informers.

2012
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:47,625
-Informers?
-Yes, Naxal sympathizers.

2013
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:50,417
-Like?
-Bodhisattya Sanyal, IPS.

2014
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,000
He had saved a lot of them.

2015
02:00:52,542 --> 02:00:55,167
He would've been caught,
got lucky that the Left Front came in.

2016
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:57,000
He has a lot of information.

2017
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:59,500
You'll get whatever you need from him.

2018
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:01,292
-Get here two bottles.
-Bye.

2019
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:07,375
<i>"It's been going on for many days,</i>

2020
02:02:07,792 --> 02:02:09,458
now, something definite should be done.

2021
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:12,375
I have done everything you have said
and the way you wanted it.

2022
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:15,042
I've adjusted to all situations.

2023
02:02:15,958 --> 02:02:17,750
But how long can it go on like this?

2024
02:02:18,542 --> 02:02:21,250
For years you've been promising
but you've done nothing.

2025
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:23,208
Now, something concrete needs to be done."

2026
02:02:24,833 --> 02:02:28,042
Hey? Wasn't this scene too over the top?

2027
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:32,458
A thriller has to be dramatic.

2028
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,333
In fact, I had added
another dramatic turn right after this.

2029
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,750
Indrani said it's too drastic.

2030
02:02:38,708 --> 02:02:42,542
The graph has to go up and down or else
I'll never get over my arty reputation!

2031
02:02:42,958 --> 02:02:44,583
-Gone?
-What?

2032
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:47,042
The olive wreaths on the posters!

2033
02:02:49,333 --> 02:02:51,042
Should I cook something for you?

2034
02:02:51,333 --> 02:02:52,583
You aren't eating at all.

2035
02:02:53,458 --> 02:02:54,500
I don't feel like it.

2036
02:02:55,667 --> 02:02:57,292
Make something for Guli.

2037
02:02:57,375 --> 02:02:59,250
Oh. Should I make some "packety?"

2038
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:00,958
You mean spaghetti?

2039
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:03,458
-Okay.
-Okay.

2040
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:04,833
Listen.

2041
02:03:06,667 --> 02:03:10,417
The day I was in Delhi, did Janaki visit?

2042
02:03:10,958 --> 02:03:11,792
Yes.

2043
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:14,292
Were you there then?

2044
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:16,750
I saw her exiting Sir's room.

2045
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:19,917
What? His room? What do you mean?

2046
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:21,167
Tell me clearly.

2047
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:24,542
You told me to serve
Sir's lunch in the afternoon.

2048
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:27,208
So, I finished my work
at the neighbor's house in the morning.

2049
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:29,083
What time?

2050
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:32,208
Around 10:30 a.m.

2051
02:03:34,083 --> 02:03:35,500
Was Janaki here then?

2052
02:03:35,833 --> 02:03:36,667
No.

2053
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:39,250
I came back at around 2:00 p.m.

2054
02:03:39,833 --> 02:03:42,000
-Listen!
-No! It's non-negotiable.

2055
02:03:42,708 --> 02:03:45,625
I am giving you three days.
Think about whatever you need to.

2056
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:05,125
It's 2:00 p.m. already.
Should I get you something to eat?

2057
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:07,667
No. I don't want to eat.

2058
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:09,583
Next scene...

2059
02:04:10,292 --> 02:04:11,250
Just a minute.

2060
02:04:13,792 --> 02:04:14,625
Yes?

2061
02:04:15,708 --> 02:04:16,792
I'm at the office. Why?

2062
02:04:17,958 --> 02:04:19,458
In the middle of a script reading. Why?

2063
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,167
Is it urgent?

2064
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:27,583
Why such urgency?

2065
02:04:28,458 --> 02:04:29,917
I'm scared, Kunal.

2066
02:04:31,917 --> 02:04:32,792
Why? What happened?

2067
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:36,833
Look at this picture.

2068
02:04:39,708 --> 02:04:44,042
At the art exhibition, these two
were pretending not to know each other.

2069
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,333
I researched after seeing this picture.

2070
02:04:49,417 --> 02:04:52,458
Janaki had written a review
on <i>The Slaying of Meghnad.</i>

2071
02:04:52,833 --> 02:04:53,667
Really?

2072
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:57,750
But Janaki didn't come
to the birthday party.

2073
02:04:59,042 --> 02:05:02,167
-So, how could she give the gift?
-Kunal, listen to me.

2074
02:05:02,708 --> 02:05:03,958
On the day I had gone to Delhi

2075
02:05:04,042 --> 02:05:07,292
Janaki had come to the house
to send a mail to me.

2076
02:05:07,833 --> 02:05:09,083
At around 11:30.

2077
02:05:09,167 --> 02:05:10,083
What was the mail about?

2078
02:05:10,792 --> 02:05:11,958
That's not important.

2079
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:14,167
She had sent a few scanned pictures.

2080
02:05:15,125 --> 02:05:21,458
Important thing is why was she with Asim
for two hours after that?

2081
02:05:22,042 --> 02:05:23,708
The doors of the room
were closed at that time.

2082
02:05:24,125 --> 02:05:25,167
How did you know?

2083
02:05:26,208 --> 02:05:27,167
Our maid told me.

2084
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,292
What was she doing?

2085
02:05:32,333 --> 02:05:37,417
And after that day, Asim's behavior
had completely changed.

2086
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,208
What did she say?

2087
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:43,125
-What could it be?
-No!

2088
02:05:44,292 --> 02:05:45,500
Don't do anything in a hurry.

2089
02:05:46,208 --> 02:05:48,458
Political thriller? Costa Gavras?

2090
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:50,583
First get yourself checked
by an orthopedic.

2091
02:05:50,667 --> 02:05:51,542
Why?

2092
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:53,375
Because your spinelessness is--

2093
02:05:53,458 --> 02:05:55,458
Are you referring to our fraternity?

2094
02:05:57,042 --> 02:05:58,458
But there are still those--

2095
02:06:00,667 --> 02:06:01,500
Listen.

2096
02:06:01,667 --> 02:06:04,333
It takes guts to make a political film.

2097
02:06:05,042 --> 02:06:07,125
-Do you have it?
-I do have some.

2098
02:06:08,042 --> 02:06:10,792
Have you ever seen me
on any political platform?

2099
02:06:11,583 --> 02:06:14,000
But this film is not based
on the current situation.

2100
02:06:14,125 --> 02:06:15,208
It's set in the 70's.

2101
02:06:15,458 --> 02:06:16,500
Oh, my!

2102
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:19,542
Based on the same old Naxalite!

2103
02:06:19,625 --> 02:06:24,792
When will the Bengalis get over
their nostalgia about Naxalite?

2104
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:27,208
Tell me something.

2105
02:06:27,458 --> 02:06:29,583
There's been so much written,
so many films.

2106
02:06:29,667 --> 02:06:32,958
But has there been an objective,
impartial evaluation?

2107
02:06:33,542 --> 02:06:36,958
I am not qualified enough
to evaluate the Naxalbari Movement.

2108
02:06:37,792 --> 02:06:40,750
I would like to use that era
as a backdrop for a thriller.

2109
02:06:42,333 --> 02:06:45,667
In the 70's a matinee idol

2110
02:06:45,833 --> 02:06:48,667
accidentally witnessed the murder
of a Naxalite leader.

2111
02:06:48,917 --> 02:06:52,125
That could make for a thrilling story.

2112
02:06:52,458 --> 02:06:53,292
True.

2113
02:06:53,875 --> 02:06:56,542
But I have recently come across
some other real life characters.

2114
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:58,667
An interesting script could
be written on them.

2115
02:06:59,417 --> 02:07:01,792
One of them is presently making headlines.

2116
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,792
I know that you--

2117
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:05,292
Who are you talking about?

2118
02:07:06,042 --> 02:07:07,083
Mr. Asimava Bose?

2119
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,417
Brilliant student, from a rich family,
a political hobbyist!

2120
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:20,167
A beating by the cops led
to the end of the romanticism.

2121
02:07:20,375 --> 02:07:21,583
And what about Indrajit Choudury?

2122
02:07:31,583 --> 02:07:32,792
Hi! This is Mou.

2123
02:07:33,125 --> 02:07:36,000
<i>I'm really sorry, Mou,
for bothering you like this.</i>

2124
02:07:37,708 --> 02:07:39,125
No, it's okay. Please tell me.

2125
02:07:39,667 --> 02:07:40,833
And one more thing.

2126
02:07:44,958 --> 02:07:47,042
Indrajit died in a police encounter.

2127
02:07:48,042 --> 02:07:49,083
Shunu had got him killed.

2128
02:07:50,167 --> 02:07:54,542
He had a relationship
with a tribal girl called Sandhyamani.

2129
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:55,958
Sandhyamani Baske.

2130
02:07:56,833 --> 02:07:57,833
She got caught later.

2131
02:07:58,625 --> 02:07:59,833
She was pregnant.

2132
02:07:59,958 --> 02:08:04,000
Later, while giving birth
in a prison hospital, she died.

2133
02:08:04,333 --> 02:08:06,333
She used to do street theatre
very seriously.

2134
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:13,250
Then I went abroad for my PhD
and we lost contact.

2135
02:08:15,958 --> 02:08:16,917
One last question.

2136
02:08:17,667 --> 02:08:19,667
What happened to the child
of Indrajit and Sandhyamani?

2137
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:22,750
Once when she was drunk,

2138
02:08:22,833 --> 02:08:26,292
she had said that she was
much darker than her parents.

2139
02:08:26,417 --> 02:08:28,167
So everyone would tease her.

2140
02:08:28,458 --> 02:08:29,667
Then she found out that...

2141
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:34,833
An immigrant Bengali childless couple
I knew, adopted the girl.

2142
02:08:35,917 --> 02:08:37,667
Do you know her name?

2143
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:39,500
Is this a question or a statement?

2144
02:08:51,833 --> 02:08:53,417
Why have we come all the way for this?

2145
02:08:53,792 --> 02:08:55,583
I was feeling suffocated in Kolkata.

2146
02:08:56,542 --> 02:08:58,500
People may think it's insensitive of me

2147
02:08:58,583 --> 02:09:00,417
to enjoy seeing people dance
in this circumstance.

2148
02:09:03,625 --> 02:09:07,542
When Sanatan told me about these dancers
and Kunal was coming here for a recce.

2149
02:09:08,292 --> 02:09:09,208
I decided to come.

2150
02:09:10,458 --> 02:09:13,958
On the way back
we must visit the location.

2151
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:16,625
Okay.

2152
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:32,667
Where are we going exactly?

2153
02:09:48,167 --> 02:09:49,708
I'm not sure
whether I'll shoot here or not.

2154
02:09:50,125 --> 02:09:52,542
But I've heard there
was a shootout here many years back.

2155
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,000
Have you ever been here before?

2156
02:09:55,458 --> 02:09:56,292
Who are you?

2157
02:09:56,792 --> 02:09:58,708
Can we look around the place?

2158
02:09:58,792 --> 02:10:00,167
-Yes, why not?
-Great.

2159
02:10:00,792 --> 02:10:01,667
Excuse me?

2160
02:10:02,208 --> 02:10:05,083
Didn't you come here once,
quite some time back?

2161
02:10:05,792 --> 02:10:07,417
I think you are right.

2162
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,333
Okay.

2163
02:10:12,167 --> 02:10:14,542
Anyway, let me tell you a story.

2164
02:10:15,083 --> 02:10:17,458
But neither of us know how the story ends.

2165
02:10:18,167 --> 02:10:19,500
Perhaps you can complete it.

2166
02:10:22,083 --> 02:10:23,458
The year was 1971.

2167
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:25,125
The hardline Naxalite leader,

2168
02:10:25,208 --> 02:10:28,125
Indrajit Choudhury was killed
by notorious cop,

2169
02:10:28,292 --> 02:10:29,958
Mr. Soumitra Guha Thakurata alias Shunu.

2170
02:10:30,333 --> 02:10:33,333
And if I'm not wrong,
the murder took place in this house!

2171
02:10:34,958 --> 02:10:37,750
Along with Indrajit,
Sandhyamani Baske was also arrested.

2172
02:10:38,583 --> 02:10:40,000
Sandhyamani was then pregnant.

2173
02:10:40,792 --> 02:10:45,167
But while giving birth to a girl
she died in a jail hospital.

2174
02:10:45,917 --> 02:10:49,083
Later, a childless couple from Nagpur
adopted that orphan child.

2175
02:10:49,375 --> 02:10:52,917
The adoption process was facilitated
by IPS officer, Bodhisattya Sanyal.

2176
02:10:53,167 --> 02:10:57,250
I found out from your JNU friend
that you had a major crisis,

2177
02:10:58,042 --> 02:10:59,333
about your adoption.

2178
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:08,458
Where is Asim, Janaki?

2179
02:11:09,083 --> 02:11:10,917
What happened to him?
What have you done with him?

2180
02:11:11,458 --> 02:11:12,417
Mr. Kirtish Bhadra,

2181
02:11:12,792 --> 02:11:15,542
who introduced himself
as Badal Biswas to Asim,

2182
02:11:15,958 --> 02:11:17,375
was someone you know, am I right?

2183
02:11:17,875 --> 02:11:18,917
A member of OPDR.

2184
02:11:19,375 --> 02:11:21,375
And if my information is correct
then at this moment

2185
02:11:21,458 --> 02:11:23,875
he has gone underground
after the Jhargram bomb blast.

2186
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:27,167
You were an active member

2187
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,208
of the Preetilata Squad,
while in Jadavpur University.

2188
02:11:29,542 --> 02:11:33,333
That tattoo on your forearm
is the star above the hammer and sickle.

2189
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:37,292
Mr. Kirtish is not just
your political comrade,

2190
02:11:38,167 --> 02:11:40,417
but a friend and accomplice too.

2191
02:11:41,042 --> 02:11:42,958
What were you doing in our house

2192
02:11:43,042 --> 02:11:45,042
till 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon,

2193
02:11:45,125 --> 02:11:47,292
when you had sent the mail by 11:30 a.m.?

2194
02:11:48,125 --> 02:11:50,000
What did you have to discuss with Asim?

2195
02:11:50,333 --> 02:11:51,167
Do you want to hear it?

2196
02:11:57,292 --> 02:11:59,208
Do you know what I'm going through?

2197
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:02,250
-Nothing can be worse.
-Okay, fine.

2198
02:12:03,417 --> 02:12:06,500
When I got to know
I was adopted, I accepted it.

2199
02:12:13,417 --> 02:12:17,875
Didn't you ever want to know the identity
of your biological parents?

2200
02:12:18,708 --> 02:12:20,042
Yes, several times.

2201
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:22,042
But my father said he didn't know.

2202
02:12:25,125 --> 02:12:27,792
Then one day,
when my father was hospitalized.

2203
02:12:28,125 --> 02:12:34,208
You have always wanted
to know a lot of things.

2204
02:12:35,958 --> 02:12:36,792
I...

2205
02:12:37,375 --> 02:12:39,292
I couldn't give you all of the answers.

2206
02:12:40,375 --> 02:12:41,375
Today,

2207
02:12:42,333 --> 02:12:44,708
I'm going to give you
the name of a person,

2208
02:12:45,833 --> 02:12:47,750
Mr. Bodhisattya Sanyal.

2209
02:12:48,083 --> 02:12:50,083
He was an IPS officer.

2210
02:12:52,083 --> 02:12:53,042
I am not sure.

2211
02:12:54,417 --> 02:12:56,500
Maybe he's still alive.

2212
02:12:56,958 --> 02:12:59,833
I hope you can meet him.

2213
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:01,833
Okay.

2214
02:13:06,583 --> 02:13:08,792
My dad died in the hospital.

2215
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,875
I started looking
for Mr. Bodhisattya Sanyal.

2216
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:28,583
Asimov was, of course, a code name.

2217
02:13:38,583 --> 02:13:39,500
In Birbhum.

2218
02:13:40,208 --> 02:13:42,417
A dilapidated palace
in the middle of the forest.

2219
02:13:43,375 --> 02:13:44,333
Birbhum?

2220
02:13:44,542 --> 02:13:47,792
In a place called Kalikapur
near Santiniketan!

2221
02:13:47,875 --> 02:13:48,750
There.

2222
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:51,292
Since then you started looking
for Comrade Asimov!

2223
02:13:52,958 --> 02:13:56,833
And you got to know
writer Asimava Bose is comrade Asimov.

2224
02:13:57,542 --> 02:14:03,500
I got to know of a famous Bengali writer
who was called Asimov Bose abroad.

2225
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:06,292
Once I checked his background,
everything was clear.

2226
02:14:06,417 --> 02:14:08,083
Two meritorious students
of Presidency College.

2227
02:14:08,167 --> 02:14:11,333
Asimava and Indrajit both got involved
with the Naxalite movement!

2228
02:14:12,083 --> 02:14:15,458
At the end of 1971,
when the movement was in doldrums,

2229
02:14:15,708 --> 02:14:17,542
Indrajit gets killed by the police

2230
02:14:17,958 --> 02:14:20,375
and Asimava leaves the country
after he is released from prison.

2231
02:14:20,958 --> 02:14:23,250
After this, I had no problem
putting the story together.

2232
02:14:23,917 --> 02:14:27,375
That Asim was the one who traded
information of Indrajit's hiding place.

2233
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:29,542
In lieu of his safe passage abroad.

2234
02:14:33,292 --> 02:14:34,125
Then?

2235
02:14:34,417 --> 02:14:36,208
It was difficult for me
to reach him directly,

2236
02:14:36,417 --> 02:14:37,708
so, I took another route.

2237
02:14:37,792 --> 02:14:39,042
You used me.

2238
02:14:40,458 --> 02:14:41,833
While doing theatre workshops

2239
02:14:42,042 --> 02:14:44,583
I had some exposure
to Chchau, Gambhira dance forms.

2240
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:49,208
Then I did a thorough research
on Bengal's folk performers

2241
02:14:49,792 --> 02:14:51,583
just to reach you.

2242
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,958
You offered me a job,

2243
02:14:56,667 --> 02:14:59,292
and I quit my job in Delhi
and came to Kolkata!

2244
02:15:01,125 --> 02:15:03,667
I got in touch with Kirtish again
in Kolkata.

2245
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:07,833
And then the plan starts rolling.

2246
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,583
At first you sent him
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad!</i>

2247
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,958
The idea probably occurred to you
while reviewing the play.

2248
02:15:14,042 --> 02:15:15,792
<i>The honeybees thronged to the flowers</i>

2249
02:15:16,125 --> 02:15:18,500
<i>And the cuckoo sang from the branches</i>

2250
02:15:18,583 --> 02:15:20,125
<i>The monster's drums sounded</i>

2251
02:15:23,708 --> 02:15:25,292
<i>The monster's drums sounded</i>

2252
02:15:25,375 --> 02:15:26,917
<i>The monster's drums sounded</i>

2253
02:15:30,708 --> 02:15:32,792
<i>A sound of alert</i>

2254
02:15:36,125 --> 02:15:37,792
<i>As Golden Lanka burned</i>

2255
02:15:38,167 --> 02:15:40,083
<i>And people cried saying Victory</i>

2256
02:15:40,542 --> 02:15:42,250
<i>And people cried saying Victory</i>

2257
02:15:42,417 --> 02:15:44,583
<i>And people cried saying Victory</i>

2258
02:15:44,667 --> 02:15:46,958
<i>And people cried saying Victory</i>

2259
02:15:50,833 --> 02:15:53,083
Indrani, your research is even better.

2260
02:15:54,542 --> 02:15:56,792
The first time you sent the book
to Oxford by post

2261
02:15:56,875 --> 02:15:59,958
and the second time
on his birthday via Badal.

2262
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:01,833
If I'm not mistaken,

2263
02:16:02,333 --> 02:16:05,417
you deliberately took me out of the house
to sign the documents on the fourth.

2264
02:16:09,125 --> 02:16:12,458
On the day of the exhibition,
Badal took your landline number.

2265
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:15,958
And I disconnected your phone.

2266
02:16:17,083 --> 02:16:18,542
So that Badal...

2267
02:16:19,208 --> 02:16:22,667
Alias Kirtish could tell Asim
that he couldn't get him on the phone.

2268
02:16:23,625 --> 02:16:24,708
As per your plan,

2269
02:16:25,042 --> 02:16:26,792
you arranged a meeting in Delhi.

2270
02:16:26,875 --> 02:16:30,833
And before I left,
you took the photographs out.

2271
02:16:40,875 --> 02:16:42,042
-Here you go, Indrani.
-Yes.

2272
02:16:42,458 --> 02:16:44,375
-Your tickets.
-Thank you.

2273
02:16:45,875 --> 02:16:50,125
And all your documents and photographs
are in this folder.

2274
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,333
A masterstroke!

2275
02:16:52,042 --> 02:16:55,000
An excuse to go to Indrani's house
in her absence.

2276
02:16:55,250 --> 02:16:56,500
Not an excuse, a license.

2277
02:16:57,667 --> 02:17:00,458
Kunal, in our field of work,
planning is the key.

2278
02:17:02,583 --> 02:17:04,708
We have to get everything foolproof.

2279
02:17:05,583 --> 02:17:07,958
But there was a loophole, Janaki.

2280
02:17:08,958 --> 02:17:10,875
-I just can't figure out where--
-See this.

2281
02:17:12,042 --> 02:17:12,875
The photograph!

2282
02:17:23,542 --> 02:17:24,625
And exactly at that time?

2283
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:29,042
Like the movie <i>Blow-Up!</i> by Antonioni.

2284
02:17:30,583 --> 02:17:31,958
But where is Asim, Janaki?

2285
02:17:33,958 --> 02:17:35,042
What have you done to him?

2286
02:17:39,583 --> 02:17:40,875
But I really know nothing.

2287
02:17:45,167 --> 02:17:47,375
And I wanted to mentally torment him,

2288
02:17:47,708 --> 02:17:49,708
the way I have been suffering
for all these years.

2289
02:17:50,292 --> 02:17:52,958
Indrani, I just scanned
and e-mailed it to you.

2290
02:17:53,292 --> 02:17:55,167
Yes. Okay, check it.

2291
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:09,792
-May I come in please?
-Who's that?

2292
02:18:16,375 --> 02:18:18,667
I couldn't attend your birthday party.

2293
02:18:23,458 --> 02:18:24,500
Did you like the gift?

2294
02:18:25,625 --> 02:18:26,458
Which gift?

2295
02:18:27,125 --> 02:18:27,958
Yes!

2296
02:18:28,833 --> 02:18:29,958
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad!</i>

2297
02:18:34,167 --> 02:18:35,958
What did he say after he heard you?

2298
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:41,792
Some of you may have read or heard
how excruciating third degree is.

2299
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:45,208
But people like me have experienced it.

2300
02:18:46,875 --> 02:18:51,042
People know that I lost the use
of my left hand due to an accident.

2301
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:53,792
That is not true.

2302
02:18:55,167 --> 02:18:56,792
<i>I was a natural southpaw.</i>

2303
02:18:58,042 --> 02:19:01,875
<i>I used to bat left-handed,
and wrote using my left hand.</i>

2304
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:05,542
Everyone in this world
has a pain threshold.

2305
02:19:06,375 --> 02:19:08,458
However strong a revolutionary he may be.

2306
02:19:12,333 --> 02:19:13,500
Believe me, Janaki.

2307
02:19:13,958 --> 02:19:16,250
I didn't trade information
about your father for my release.

2308
02:19:21,542 --> 02:19:23,167
At that time,
our movement was falling apart.

2309
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:26,667
A number of our comrades
were becoming revisionists.

2310
02:19:27,917 --> 02:19:29,542
But Indra was a hardliner.

2311
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:35,583
So, I made arrangements for him to hide.

2312
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:41,208
But believe me,
I never imagined they would kill Indra.

2313
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:52,583
Even if Indrajit Choudhury
hadn't been killed

2314
02:19:52,958 --> 02:19:54,708
and remained in prison
for the rest of his life...

2315
02:19:59,292 --> 02:20:00,167
I know.

2316
02:20:01,458 --> 02:20:06,208
All these years, my conscience
has been eating me up.

2317
02:20:09,083 --> 02:20:09,917
I...

2318
02:20:10,792 --> 02:20:12,583
I haven't found peace.

2319
02:20:18,083 --> 02:20:23,917
I haven't been able to share this secret
with my psychiatrist, my wife, or friends!

2320
02:20:26,167 --> 02:20:28,958
But six months back when I received
<i>The Slaying of Meghnad</i> in Oxford,

2321
02:20:30,125 --> 02:20:32,333
I got the hint.

2322
02:20:32,542 --> 02:20:34,167
After that, I started writing this story.

2323
02:20:34,875 --> 02:20:40,292
Yes, you are intelligent enough
to decode this.

2324
02:20:40,375 --> 02:20:41,833
I knew you would understand the hints.

2325
02:20:43,167 --> 02:20:44,875
And this writing will be my confession.

2326
02:20:46,458 --> 02:20:48,833
Whatever I have to say,
I've written it all in this story.

2327
02:20:52,333 --> 02:20:53,958
And this will be my redemption.

2328
02:21:08,958 --> 02:21:12,417
I don't know what you've written
or intend to write in your book.

2329
02:21:23,792 --> 02:21:25,042
Whatever I ask you to do...

2330
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:30,333
Yes.

2331
02:21:30,917 --> 02:21:33,458
But, that can at least help you
cleanse your soul!

2332
02:21:38,583 --> 02:21:43,667
You have to tell everyone
about the betrayal you did, in reality.

2333
02:21:44,208 --> 02:21:46,167
Not through any fictional story.

2334
02:21:47,375 --> 02:21:48,458
What are you saying?

2335
02:21:48,833 --> 02:21:49,750
How is that possible?

2336
02:22:01,708 --> 02:22:04,958
If that is possible,
then this can also be possible.

2337
02:22:15,125 --> 02:22:16,417
Isn't that enough punishment?

2338
02:22:17,167 --> 02:22:18,208
No, it isn't.

2339
02:22:18,375 --> 02:22:20,958
At that time many had left the city
to escape death.

2340
02:22:21,708 --> 02:22:22,917
I was just one of them.

2341
02:22:24,083 --> 02:22:24,917
And besides,

2342
02:22:25,292 --> 02:22:27,708
the fact that I had informed the police
about Indra's whereabouts

2343
02:22:27,833 --> 02:22:28,667
was never proven.

2344
02:22:33,125 --> 02:22:34,667
No, there's no need for any proof.

2345
02:22:36,708 --> 02:22:41,958
Our whole conversation has been recorded.

2346
02:22:43,083 --> 02:22:44,167
<i>Believe me, Janaki...</i>

2347
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:46,625
If I hand this over to the media
that should be enough.

2348
02:22:51,083 --> 02:22:51,917
Now, tell me.

2349
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,375
<i>At that time...</i>

2350
02:22:53,542 --> 02:22:55,458
Will you tell everyone or should I?

2351
02:22:55,542 --> 02:22:57,417
<i>A number of our comrades
were becoming revisionists.</i>

2352
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,042
<i>So, I arranged a hideout for him.</i>

2353
02:23:06,125 --> 02:23:07,458
I don't want anything else.

2354
02:23:08,167 --> 02:23:09,292
<i>But believe me...</i>

2355
02:23:09,375 --> 02:23:10,208
I...

2356
02:23:10,917 --> 02:23:13,375
I will leave everything
and go away, forever.

2357
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:16,042
-In return--
-In return?

2358
02:23:18,042 --> 02:23:21,875
You mean each time there's a trade-off,
you'll gain something again?

2359
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:26,000
That's not possible, Professor Bose.

2360
02:23:28,958 --> 02:23:30,500
Trust me, that's all I know.

2361
02:23:31,125 --> 02:23:31,958
Janaki,

2362
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:34,042
what you have done is called blackmail.

2363
02:23:36,833 --> 02:23:38,250
That doesn't always involve money.

2364
02:23:40,958 --> 02:23:43,333
Either he would tell everyone
or you would reveal the truth.

2365
02:23:43,792 --> 02:23:46,375
But Asim took a totally different path.

2366
02:23:47,958 --> 02:23:50,208
For a second time in life
he took an escape route.

2367
02:23:50,958 --> 02:23:53,583
We should immediately hand you over
to the police. Should we?

2368
02:23:54,583 --> 02:23:56,458
Whatever you decide, I'm ready to comply.

2369
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:01,833
This place is...

2370
02:24:02,958 --> 02:24:04,167
I want to be alone for a while.

2371
02:24:16,667 --> 02:24:20,333
<i>Do you still lie awake in sleep</i>

2372
02:24:20,417 --> 02:24:24,000
<i>And watch the stars marching past</i>

2373
02:24:25,875 --> 02:24:29,500
<i>Do you walk down the distant path
Along with the song</i>

2374
02:24:29,583 --> 02:24:33,417
<i>Leaving the storm of time behind
In a tired stride</i>

2375
02:24:35,125 --> 02:24:38,542
<i>The pain in the broken roof
The parapets and the stained walls</i>

2376
02:24:38,625 --> 02:24:42,458
<i>Can it ever be wiped out by time</i>

2377
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:47,500
<i>The song that you had heard
Of following a path</i>

2378
02:24:47,583 --> 02:24:51,500
<i>Do you wake up the sleeping poet
To ask for the way?</i>

2379
02:24:51,708 --> 02:24:58,292
<i>Do you still lie awake in sleep</i>

2380
02:24:58,708 --> 02:25:04,833
"Just as the pure water streams
out of Gomukh, says Janaki."

2381
02:25:05,208 --> 02:25:06,417
Another coincidence.

2382
02:25:07,292 --> 02:25:10,167
Indrajit was killed
by Shunu Guha Thakurata alias Soumitra,

2383
02:25:10,583 --> 02:25:12,125
and Soumitri is another name for Laxman.

2384
02:25:12,417 --> 02:25:13,875
Because he was Sumitra's son.

2385
02:25:14,667 --> 02:25:18,042
But it's not a coincidence
that the meaning of both the name,

2386
02:25:18,125 --> 02:25:19,625
Asim and Ashesh is same

2387
02:25:20,917 --> 02:25:22,000
Now I'm sure.

2388
02:25:24,542 --> 02:25:26,750
Janaki opened a fake account named Meghnad

2389
02:25:27,042 --> 02:25:29,625
and wrote on Asim's Facebook wall
about Bivishan, the betrayer.

2390
02:25:30,708 --> 02:25:32,375
Just a selfish thought.

2391
02:25:33,042 --> 02:25:33,875
Shall I?

2392
02:25:34,625 --> 02:25:35,458
What?

2393
02:25:36,125 --> 02:25:38,375
A really good film could be made
out of Asim's story.

2394
02:25:39,583 --> 02:25:40,792
But if I make the film,

2395
02:25:41,708 --> 02:25:43,375
then the time frame
will not be the 1930's.

2396
02:25:44,792 --> 02:25:45,833
It will be the 1970's.

2397
02:25:47,583 --> 02:25:48,667
Police!

2398
02:25:48,750 --> 02:25:52,083
<i>The smell of gunpowder in the narrow lane</i>

2399
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:55,708
<i>Where the friend has left his hand</i>

2400
02:25:55,958 --> 02:25:59,583
<i>Where the dry blood stains
Can still be seen</i>

2401
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:04,417
<i>In the eternal darkness of the night</i>

2402
02:26:05,250 --> 02:26:10,500
<i>The gunpowder burnt in the narrow lane</i>

2403
02:26:12,542 --> 02:26:17,708
<i>Where the cowardly hand had left you
In the lurch</i>

2404
02:26:19,958 --> 02:26:23,750
<i>Do you remember it through the day? </i>

2405
02:26:23,833 --> 02:26:27,875
<i>Perhaps in the emptiness that lies awake</i>

2406
02:26:29,292 --> 02:26:31,542
<i>Now, it's the doomed time</i>

2407
02:26:31,625 --> 02:26:32,875
<i>The doomed time</i>

2408
02:26:32,958 --> 02:26:35,875
<i>The rivers are burning even today</i>

2409
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:39,750
<i>But the fire is still not warm enough</i>

2410
02:26:40,333 --> 02:26:42,208
<i>No one kept their words</i>

2411
02:26:42,292 --> 02:26:43,875
<i>What was to be kept remains unsaid</i>

2412
02:26:43,958 --> 02:26:47,292
<i>The words ring out in a gibberish
All over the city</i>

2413
02:26:47,708 --> 02:26:52,750
<i>Do you still stop to think of change</i>

2414
02:26:52,833 --> 02:26:57,958
<i>When the red flowers bloom</i>

2415
02:27:00,583 --> 02:27:04,083
<i>In the faded letters of the diary</i>

2416
02:27:04,292 --> 02:27:08,708
<i>You look for the touch of love</i>

2417
02:27:11,583 --> 02:27:16,375
<i>Are you still on the road?</i>

2418
02:27:17,625 --> 02:27:21,458
<i>Do you still sing? </i>

2419
02:27:23,542 --> 02:27:27,125
<i>Do you still think?</i>

2420
02:27:29,833 --> 02:27:34,375
<i>Are you still awake?</i>

2421
02:27:36,125 --> 02:27:40,250
<i>Do you still have desires? </i>

2422
02:27:41,917 --> 02:27:47,083
<i>Do you still?</i>
