1
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,180
The convict, despite being a
man of law, has broken the law.

2
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,459
He has broken the trust of
the citizens of this country.

3
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:17,980
He has made many go bankrupt
and driven them to suicide.

4
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,980
The convict is accused of
embezzling Rs.2500 crores.

5
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,780
l request the court to remand
the accused to police custody...

6
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,620
for at least a month
so that this scandal is exposed.

7
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,099
And justice given to
the innocent citizens.

8
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,980
Considering the case as sensitive...

9
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,500
the court accepts the
request of the public prosecutor.

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,979
And orders the accused to be under
the purview of the chief minister.

11
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,300
Sorry sir, you cannot go beyond this.

12
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,539
Come, sir.

13
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:38,500
Thank you for accepting my
call and coming to meet me.

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,620
l had to come,
since you are our special guest.

15
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,380
Why did you call me?
- We need to talk. lt's important.

16
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,979
ln private.

17
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:59,780
You are aware that l am accused
of embezzling Rs.2500 crores.

18
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,940
lt will be very difficult to prove
whether this charge is true or not.

19
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,979
And even if it is true,
where is all that money?

20
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,979
lt will take very long to find it.

21
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,819
We have lots of time, Mr.Shah,
don't worry about that.

22
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,900
Look Chief Minister, this is an
issue that involves Rs.2500 crores.

23
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,380
Half of it is Rs.1250 crores.

24
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,500
ln lndia's population
of 80 crores...

25
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,699
there must not be anyone
who has that kind of money.

26
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,500
You can have it... if you
get me out of the country.

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,940
What do you say?

28
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,980
Why think so much? Opportunity
knocks on the door only once.

29
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
How did you like my reply?

30
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,860
Natwar Shah,
you are a very weak person.

31
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,060
When a woman becomes weak,
she begins to sell herself.

32
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,980
And when a man becomes weak, he
becomes a cheat and criminal like you.

33
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,380
You want me to break the trust of
80 crore people for Rs.1250 crores?

34
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,180
Make the poor and hungry population
of the country more poor & more hungry?

35
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,420
The money you have embezzled
is not your money...

36
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,779
but is the savings
of those millions of people.

37
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,980
l have promised myself that until...

38
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,699
l take an account of every
penny of Rs.2500 crore from you...

39
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,660
l will not let you rest in peace.

40
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,060
Have you managed to do anything?
- lt is very difficult.

41
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,860
The truth is that it is impossible
to get Natwar out of jail.

42
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,899
Why?

43
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,779
The chief minister has made the
security around him so strict...

44
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,380
that it is
impossible to reach him.

45
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,779
Are you trying to say
that there is no way out?

46
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,980
There is one way. Only two
people can make this possible.

47
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,740
Who?
- One is the chief minister himself.

48
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,180
And the other?
- Tejeshwar.

49
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,899
Move!

50
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:28,180
No one will move.
Get on the floor.

51
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,880
Down on the floor!

52
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's go.

53
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,480
What happened?
This is unbelievable!

54
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
Did those thieves have
to loot only this shop?

55
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,120
Are you a partner in this shop?
- No...

56
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,920
but this shop belongs to my
dear childhood friend, Hasmukh.

57
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
He's here, Hasmukh has come.

58
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,040
Here he is.
Have courage, Hasmukh.

59
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,519
Who can avert what is destined?
But don't let this loss worry you.

60
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,800
My salary is very small,
but l won't let you go hungry.

61
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,480
l will give you half my salary.
A friend promises you.

62
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
You will give me half your salary?

63
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,360
He's gone mad.
Oh God! my friend has gone mad.

64
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,519
ln fact, God has saved me
from turning mad.

65
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,480
How?
- l had sold my shop two days ago.

66
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,880
What...? To whom?
- To Sukhiram.

67
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,480
l didn't want to, but he
insisted and even paid me for it.

68
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,039
Andu Pandu, take Rs.10 and get some
sweets. This calls for a celebration.

69
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,799
lnspector, l'm ruined
and you are calling for sweets?

70
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,440
Respect your uniform.
At least show me false sympathy.

71
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,960
l'm sorry, but l have called for
sweets because my friend was saved.

72
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,480
And where your ruin is concerned,
the police will help you.

73
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,480
And the police has inspector
Pyare Mohan in its force...

74
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
who will not let
the villain live in peace.

75
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
He won't even let him drink in peace.

76
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
lt's our man from the police.

77
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,880
Tejeshwar, this is Pravinbhai.
- l know, l know everything about him

78
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
His job will be done.

79
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,519
How much money will you pay us?

80
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,039
lf you succeed in getting my
brother out of the country...

81
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,519
your next 70 generations
will not have to work ever again.

82
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,080
Here's the advance money.

83
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,159
Can you expect
yourself to do this job?

84
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,159
Not just expect, we are
confident we can do it.

85
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,320
Maybe you are not aware
of the plan we have made.

86
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,759
What do you want?

87
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Have your fun, but remember...

88
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,480
that the crime
you are committing...

89
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,559
will one day boomerang on you.

90
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,880
You ass, we need
your help for this crime.

91
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,639
We've kidnapped you and will commit
this crime in the presence of law.

92
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,880
The law cannot harm us.

93
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,559
But that will be possible
only if we help you.

94
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,279
Kill us if you like...

95
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,880
but we will not
betray our country.

96
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,759
Enough of this!

97
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:07,960
Hey you distinguished doctors!
He is the respected Chief Minister.

98
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:14,480
He is obsessed about doing good
and we are obsessed about doing bad.

99
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,559
Your life and death
is not in my hands now.

100
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,880
lt is in your own hands.

101
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,320
The sooner you do our job,the sooner
you will go back to your family.

102
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,880
So do what we are saying.

103
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,480
This will be fun. We will rule
with the approval of the government.

104
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,279
We will put a stop
to everything else...

105
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,440
and do only one thing now.
- What?

106
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,480
We will keep a constant
watch on the chief minister.

107
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,919
You stupid ass!
l'll wring your neck and kill you.

108
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,480
You either dip my finger in hot
tea or pour cold water on me.

109
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
What are you punishing
me for, you dog!

110
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,759
Oh, so you get annoyed
if l call you a dog.

111
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,919
That moment was inauspicious when
my sons brought you home...

112
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,320
and seeing your innocent
face, l accepted you in.

113
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,279
But l didn't expect you to terrorise
your own master. l'm telling you!

114
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,480
Don't come near me,
l'm not talking to you.

115
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
You came and sat in
my lap to appease me.

116
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,840
Listen to me.

117
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,480
Reform yourself. As it is, l am
harassed by my good-for-nothing sons.

118
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,480
lf you reform yourself,
half my problems will be solved.

119
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
You will reform, won't you?

120
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,759
He wet my clothes!

121
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,480
Forget it, mother!

122
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,000
lt's 10:30 already, but your useless
grandsons must still be in bed.

123
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,480
Have a heart!
You are always after them.

124
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,480
They have already left for college.
- They have?!

125
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,799
They will get their results today.

126
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,880
Your grandsons are amazing.

127
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,200
They are good at being naughty
and good at studies too.

128
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,480
Sir, there is a call for
you from the boys college.

129
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Hello... Yes, speaking.

130
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,480
But... All right.

131
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
The principal had come home
for breakfast two days ago.

132
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
He has called me to the college,
that too the first time.

133
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,880
This time, our grandsons must
have secured even better marks.

134
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,680
More than 95% ...?

135
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Excuse me. The principal's office...?
- First floor.

136
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,480
But what is the matter?
l'm the principal.

137
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,440
You...? How can you be the principal?

138
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Some other principal has been coming
to my house for the last few years.

139
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Who are you?
- l'm Hasmukh Rai...

140
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,400
father of Bunnu and Munnu.
- You are Bunnu and Munnu's father?

141
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes. Any doubts?

142
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,680
The man who they have been
bringing to college as their dad...

143
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
since the last three
years, is someone else.

144
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,920
Fraud...?
- And l have called you here...

145
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,200
to inform you that l have
rusticated them from college.

146
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
Because they have been failing
their exams since the last 3 years.

147
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,359
But they have been getting
90- 95 % marks and you say...

148
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,759
Actually, your sons have never
scored more than 9 % marks.

149
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,480
What?!

150
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,279
Look at them, they are our
college's best students.

151
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,319
They scored 98 % marks this year.

152
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,039
Your sons beat them up and
snatched their marksheets.

153
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,640
They even stole the best
student shield from my office.

154
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Now l know where they get the
marksheets and the shield from.

155
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,480
Grandma!
- Son!

156
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,759
Look, we have got the
best student shield.

157
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,480
We will even get scholarship now.

158
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,400
Hug us, daddy! You know what
wonderful marks we've got this time?

159
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,880
98 %! And here's the marksheet.
- Bless you, son!

160
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,200
Only one answer went wrong,
or if we had scored 100 %...

161
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,480
we would've broken the world record.
- A lot is going to break today.

162
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Really?
- Look, the principal is here, too.

163
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,799
l think he wants to congratulate us.
- Congratulations, Mr.Rai!

164
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,000
What wonderful sons you have!
They are invaluable.

165
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They are the honour of your
house and the glory of our college.

166
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,720
You are overdoing it.
- Let him, l'm enjoying it.

167
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,480
When l tell people l am the
principal of Xavier's college,...

168
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
do you know what they say?
- What?

169
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
The same college
in which Bunnu and Munnu are?

170
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,400
Did you see their mark sheet? 98 %!
We must celebrate with sweets.

171
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,519
l'm desperate to celebrate since
morning. Come upstairs.

172
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,160
Will you only give him sweets?
- Won't you give us?

173
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,480
He is elder to you, let me give him
sweets first, then l'll give you.

174
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
Congratulations!
- Come upstairs with me.

175
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,799
l know you were a boxer, but why
are you wearing those gloves now?

176
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,480
Because l know you were a thief.

177
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,279
You've been going to my sons college
as their father since three years.

178
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,920
And you come here
as their principal.

179
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,880
After today's beatings
you'll never play a father.

180
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,480
You'll be even ashamed
to have fathered sons!

181
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Help!

182
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,279
You beat the principal?!
- lt's now the turn of his students.

183
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,599
No!

184
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,279
What are you doing?
- Beating them black and blue!

185
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,880
They snatched my laughter
the day they were born.

186
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,279
Do you know that these two have been
failing exams since the last 3 years?

187
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,480
What?!

188
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,279
That shield is not theirs,
they have stolen it.

189
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,200
Even the marksheet is not theirs, they
have snatched it from a bright student

190
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
They stole?
- Yes.

191
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,480
Let me show you their real marksheet.

192
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,359
He has scored 9, and he's scored 10.
- l have scored one more than you!

193
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,720
Don't beat him. He is right.

194
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,480
Munnu, he's got the gun. Run!

195
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,319
Are you hit?

196
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:51,680
Hey, wait! let us get
in the car at least.

197
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,960
Stop!

198
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,480
Are you headed straight?

199
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,920
Since we got into a soup going
wayward, we've decided to go straight

200
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,400
Straight!
- Can you give me a lift?

201
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,960
My car broke down.

202
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,480
Does your driver drive well?

203
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,920
He even pilots a plane.
But why are you so afraid?

204
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,279
My life is very precious. l have
not done anything in my life yet.

205
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,880
l'm going to see a girl for myself.

206
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,480
Which girl are you
going to be cruel to?

207
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,400
What?
- He means...

208
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,480
where are you going to see this girl?
- There is a small hill station...

209
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,920
nearby, Sangampur. l'm going there.
- How does the girl look?

210
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,480
l haven't seen her yet.
- You haven't seen the girl yet?

211
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Even she hasn't seen me.

212
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,480
And the girl's family?
- Even they haven't.

213
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Our elders had finalised this
proposal. Arranged marriage, you see.

214
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,480
What's your name?
- Gullu.

215
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Give your school name, stupid.
- He means, give your full name.

216
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,880
Gulshan Kapoor!
- Gulshan Kapoor! Note it.

217
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,680
What is your father's name?
- Heerachand Kapoor.

218
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,359
Note it.
- He's from Delhi, note that too.

219
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,480
Where do you live?
- ln Bombay.

220
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,359
Note it.

221
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,160
ls this girl from Sangampur?
- No, she is from Bombay...

222
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,880
but she has come to her farm
house here.They are very rich people.

223
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,960
Noted it down!
- Why are you noting down all this?

224
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,279
Why are you laughing?
- Wonder why when we see you...

225
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,480
we get the feeling that
you are buried neck deep.

226
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,000
You rogues!

227
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,039
l've made the biggest mistake of
my life by taking a lift from you.

228
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
Exactly.
- You dogs!

229
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
Right!
- Rogues!

230
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
Right!
- At least tell me what you want.

231
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,480
Just some rest of 10-15 days.

232
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,640
Father has chucked us out.
- So we will go to see the girl.

233
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,480
He will be Gulshan,
and l will be his friend Ranjit.

234
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,880
l cannot remove my hands out,
but believe me...

235
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,920
l am begging you
to have mercy on me.

236
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,079
l was going to find my
life's first happiness.

237
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,680
That has nothing to do
with our sorrow.

238
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,480
Besides, we are not that bad. We
have arranged for your food and drink.

239
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,599
Here's yourjuice and milk.
- Do your otherjobs underground only

240
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,599
Give me my clothes!
How will l come out in the nude?

241
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,920
Bajrangi, you drive
very roughly nowadays.

242
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,200
This house is good.
- l hope the food is good too.

243
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,480
lf you think you can
fool me, you are mistaken.

244
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,880
Because l have recognised you.

245
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,480
What?!
- Yes.

246
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Now... yes, you are Gulshan!

247
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,720
And he must be your friend.
- You are amazing!

248
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,480
l am his friend Ranjit.
And he is our friend Shakti.

249
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,480
This woman looks elderly.
- Very elderly.

250
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
As if you have to marry her.
- Did you say something?

251
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,599
Why haven't you married yet?

252
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,799
Actually, l never met a man
like you until now, son.

253
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,480
Son...?
- Laxmi, is baby ready?

254
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,480
She is the relative of the girl,
the girl is getting dressed upstairs.

255
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,599
You look so beautiful that the boy
will swoon the moment he sees you...

256
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,000
and immediately
accept your proposal.

257
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,039
Who is the girl among them?
- Both are girls, stupid!

258
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,200
Which one is mine?
- The girl besides my girl is yours.

259
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,599
But who is baby?
- Whoever!

260
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,359
But the one in green is my girl.

261
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,480
Thank God! lt is the first time
our tastes haven't matched.

262
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,359
l don't know who has come to see
you, but both the guys are good.

263
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,920
They are okay.
- Who is more okay?

264
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,559
The one standing besides aunt.

265
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,839
Good. l hope he is the one
who has come to see you.

266
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,920
Because l find his
friend more than okay.

267
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,480
Baby, why are you
standing there, come here.

268
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Baby, this is Gulshan.

269
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Aunty, he is Gulshan,
l am his friend Ranjit.

270
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,279
But you just said outside that he...
- Sorry aunt...

271
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,519
but you said with so much confidence
that you recognise us.

272
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,440
Besides, we don't argue with elders.

273
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,559
Madam, it is their dad's call.
- Daddy!

274
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,480
He must be wanting to know
if l have reached safely.

275
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,680
Excuse me please.
l'll talk to him.

276
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,279
Gulshan my son, my darling,
did you reach safely?

277
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,279
Yes.
- What's wrong with your voice?

278
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,480
l had split milk tea on my way here.
l'll gargle with salt water.

279
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,960
All right, come back tomorrow.
- Yes.

280
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,000
What? You are going
to Kanpur tomorrow?

281
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,599
Then l'll stay back
here for 2-3 days.

282
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,519
Aunty is very nice,
even the girl is very nice.

283
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:32,000
l find these guys to be over smart.
- Even l think so.

284
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,720
Even we'll get up early from
tomorrow. Exercise is a good thing.

285
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,680
Our exercise will be
watching them exercising.

286
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,880
What are you'll doing here?

287
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,960
We're watching
how well you exercise.

288
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,400
We know what you are watching.

289
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,079
Ritu, these guys
are cunning and over smart.

290
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,480
Don't say that sister-in-law,
l'm her to-be husband.

291
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,279
You are nobody,
l don't want to marry you.

292
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,480
Neither me.
- Hey, listen!

293
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,960
What is my girl's name?
- l don't even know my girl's name.

294
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,799
How stupid we are!

295
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,400
We are here since yesterday and we
haven't yet asked them their name.

296
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
Let's go and ask them.

297
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,880
Where to...? Stand in queue.
- l'm not here to buy cinema tickets.

298
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,000
l have come to collect
money l gave Bunnu and Munnu.

299
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
Sonofagun! You ruin my sons' lives
by giving them loans...

300
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,199
and then dare to
talk loudly with me?

301
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,880
And what are you all standing
in queue for like beggars?

302
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,960
l won't give any of you
a single penny. Get out!

303
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,699
This man is worst than his sons.
- Want a kick?

304
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,300
Bloody beggar! You call us beggars?
- Your father's a beggar, too!

305
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,940
This man is shameless.

306
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,340
We'll recover our money from
Bunnu and Munnu. Let's go.

307
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,820
Hasmukhlal be damned!

308
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,099
Did you hear that? My sons
disgrace me like this everyday.

309
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,300
These petty people come to
my house, curse me and leave.

310
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,219
There is not a single shop left from
where they haven't taken credit.

311
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:51,179
They blow Rs.800 on cigarettes alone.
- Pity you, but have courage.

312
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:56,780
You reap as you sow.
- What have l sowed to reap this?

313
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,500
You have only one daughter. You are
lucky. Even if l had two daughters...

314
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,780
l would've been a happier man.
- Sure you would have.

315
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,380
You should have had daughters
just like your sons are.

316
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,780
They would disgrace you and
you'd have to commit suicide.

317
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,260
They would paint the town red...
- Do you have any shame?

318
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,340
You just talk anything! Sonofagun!
- Sorry.

319
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,579
Tell me, what brought you here?
- l had come for some work.

320
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,579
l forgot. Why am l here?
- Get yourself treated.

321
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,780
Why are you giving
the police a bad name?

322
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,820
How is your daughter?
- Oh yes! l had come for her only.

323
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,900
He's laughing!

324
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,780
Priya has gone to Sangampur
with her friend.

325
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,219
She had said she will return in two
days, but hasn't, so l'm going there.

326
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,099
l want your big car.

327
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,780
One minute! The big car?
- Yes.

328
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,699
Are you going to bring back
your daughter or meet your lover?

329
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,780
Don't you feel ashamed to
keep a lover at your age?

330
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,460
You haven't seen her.
- l'm don't even want to.

331
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,860
When you see her, you'll know
what a simmering beauty she is.

332
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,460
Like a ruined star?
- She's devastating!

333
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,699
Shall l tell you something? Even
you will go wild when you see her.

334
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,500
Me? l am not like you,
l'm a principled man.

335
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,179
l have never looked at a woman.
- How can you?

336
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:21,420
You will look at women
only if your sons let you.

337
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,780
Shall l tell you something?
However naughty my sons may be...

338
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,579
but without them,
this house seems lonely.

339
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,860
lt is seven days since they
have gone. l feel depressed.

340
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,179
Wonder where they will be.
- Come on!

341
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,260
You horrible monkey! Did you have
to put out your cigarette on my butt?

342
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,780
lt is said that dogs are most loyal,
but you are more loyal than anybody.

343
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,860
You're standing guard since six
days and won't let me enter.

344
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,780
l'm going to marry that girl.

345
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,579
l wonder what your master
must be doing with her.

346
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,340
Priya, you haven't
slept in your room today?

347
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,420
Anyway, it's good,
we can have a chat.

348
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,780
Say something, Ritu. Why are
you turned the other way?

349
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,820
Turn on my side.

350
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,619
l'm thinking of telling aunt that...

351
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,460
l am ready to marry Gulshan.
What d'you say?

352
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,219
They are nice men. And l think
they even love us. What say you?

353
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:58,780
That is why, though they're here
since a week,they don't want to leave.

354
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,500
l think, until we stay annoyed
with them, they will not leave.

355
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,179
No way.

356
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,579
Priya, shall l tell you the truth?
- Yes.

357
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,059
For the first time l've felt something
stir in my heart on seeing someone.

358
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,179
Same here.

359
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:19,780
l don't know why l feel that
he should always be around me and...

360
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,619
What happened to your hands?

361
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,820
What happened?

362
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,260
Nothing, aunt. A fat rat had sneaked
into my room. l drove it out.

363
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,460
Okay. lt's very late. Switch off
the lights and go to sleep.

364
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,380
What are you doing here?
- l've come to find out how you feel.

365
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,780
Go from here, please!

366
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,300
l'll go, but at least give me a kiss.

367
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,340
All right... only one.

368
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,139
Priya, where are you?

369
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:23,739
''l wanna date you''

370
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,460
What are you staring at?

371
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,179
What makes you stare at me?

372
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,179
l have come to take Priya.
- The kids have gone out.

373
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:39,860
They'll be back soon.
- You mean there is no one home?

374
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,780
Why...? Well, l'm home.

375
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:48,780
This is your chance. Miss it,
and you'll miss it forever.

376
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,059
Anu, did Ritu like the boy
who had come to see her?

377
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:59,780
Yes. l think we'll
have the marriage soon.

378
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,940
That's nice, but you will become
very lonely after she gets married.

379
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,980
lt can't be helped.

380
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,500
Even l will become lonely after
my daughter Priya gets married.

381
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,780
A desolate house will depress me.

382
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,860
That is why...
- You are planning to marry again?

383
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,260
l'm busy all day. l must have
a reason to return home at nights.

384
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,420
Shall l tell you something?
''No life without wife.''

385
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,219
Have you seen a girl for yourself?
- Yes, since two years.

386
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:39,500
50% of the relationship is finalised.
- 50 % ...?

387
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,780
Yes, from my side. The other
50 % approval has to come from her.

388
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:49,300
Then why don't you ask her?
- l'm afraid she may get angry.

389
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,900
That is the drawback men have.
They unnecessarily get worried.

390
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,860
That is what l was going to...

391
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,780
The kids.

392
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,739
Bad timing!

393
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:07,219
You're back!
Priya, your daddy is here.

394
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:09,739
What?
- Yes.

395
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,420
When did you come?
- Just now.

396
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,860
Wastrels! What are you
two doing here?

397
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,780
Do you know them?
- Only too well. The scoundrels!

398
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,699
They were missing since a week.

399
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:32,780
Do you know how worried
your father is about you?

400
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,139
Why is he worried?
We had informed him.

401
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:38,179
The world is so small.
Take them for example.

402
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:45,179
You know Gulshan and Ranjit
and their father Heerachand too.

403
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,460
Heerachand? Who is Heerachand?
- How forgetful you are!

404
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,699
You met daddy yesterday?
- Yes.

405
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,219
And you still ask who Heerachand is?

406
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:00,980
But how is Heerachand
connected with your daddy, Bunnu?

407
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,179
Bunnu...? Who is Bunnu?
- He.

408
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,460
What's all this about, Munnu?
- Munnu?

409
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,820
Look aunty, he is calling
me too by a wrong name.

410
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,579
My name is not Munnu, l'm Ranjit.

411
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:18,820
ls that Bajrangi or someone else?

412
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,579
He is Bajrangi and he has
kept the ignition on.

413
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,780
Why?
- Because it's now time to escape.

414
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,500
Where are you'll going?

415
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,179
Anu, you have been cheated.
- Cheated?

416
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,260
Yes. They are the sons
of my old friend Hasmukh.

417
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,780
Gulshan and...
l mean, Bunnu and Munnu.

418
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,179
Daddy!
- You're back again?

419
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,260
Beat me if you like, but save Bunnu
first. He has met with an accident.

420
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
What?!
- And he has lost his memory.

421
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,340
Look.

422
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,780
Bunnu, what happened to you?

423
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Wait a minute, mother. What kind
of an accident was that?

424
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,780
l don't see any injury.
- This is an internal injury.

425
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,980
The car ran over his brain.
And he went mad.

426
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,579
l'm not mad.
- See!

427
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,260
The world goes on the moon,
l will go on the sun.

428
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,579
But the sun is very hot,
there is only fire there.

429
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:41,820
That's exactly why l have preferred
to enter it in the night.

430
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,179
Happy now?
Beat him more!

431
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:50,380
l'm not their enemy, l beat them
so that they don't go wayward.

432
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,780
Now go and call the doctor.
- l'll call him right away.

433
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,860
Bunnu, what happened to you?

434
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,900
Where's your master?

435
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,659
Are you Mr.Hasmukh?

436
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:20,300
''For the first time l see love
in the eyes of my beloved''

437
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,980
Are you Mr.Hasmukh?

438
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,380
Yes... tell... me.

439
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,780
l've come to you with a complaint.
- But l don't even know you.

440
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Have l done something wrong?
- lt is your sons who have wronged.

441
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,179
Do you know what they have done?

442
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:43,900
They had been fooling me
and my nieces since a week.

443
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,780
All that's fine, but what if
acting mad, l actually go mad?

444
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,860
Whether you go mad or not,
dad will surely go mad.

445
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,179
Do you remember anything?
This is daddy.

446
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,780
Daddy? What is daddy?
- He is like me.

447
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,579
He is one foolish fellow who
takes the burden of his kids.

448
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,780
That reminds him of something?
- No, daddy. l'm trying since long...

449
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,500
but he cannot remember anything.
- You must be tired.

450
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,780
Come downstairs son,
you'll remember everything.

451
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,780
Son brings me up. Father takes
me down. All right let's go.

452
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,179
l'm not afraid of anybody.

453
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,780
Do you see them?

454
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Easy, easy.

455
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,579
Remember anything?
- No.

456
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:42,300
Then why the shocked expression?
- Just like that, daddy.

457
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,780
You have regained half your memory.
l'll help you regain the other half.

458
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,099
Don't! Don't beat a patient.
- Patient?

459
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:53,780
l'll make you both patients.

460
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,780
Aunty, please forgive
us for our mistake.

461
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,179
Daddy is very hot,
please cool him.

462
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:06,579
What?!
- lt was tough getting into the house

463
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:08,780
Please do something or he'll
throw us out of the house again.

464
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,860
That is your punishment, that you
are thrown out of your house forever.

465
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,260
You deserve to go
hungry on the streets.

466
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,619
We are not so useless.
We can work hard and earn a living.

467
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,179
Henceforth, you will have
to work and earn a living.

468
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:24,179
You are saying that?
- Just earn two bucks and show me.

469
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,860
You are challenging us?
- Yes! l know how useless you are.

470
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,460
Didn't you feel ashamed to do such
a lowly act with this decent family?

471
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,300
Ashamed? What for? We love them.
What's your problem, dad?

472
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,300
lf you cannot find
the words, forget it.

473
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,699
What did you say?
Get out!

474
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,500
We are not garbage that you throw
us out of the house again and again.

475
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,820
Those who don't follow my orders
are thrown out. This is my house.

476
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,179
Your house?
- Yes!

477
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,260
We assumed this to be
our house until now.

478
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,179
But you have opened our eyes today.

479
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:08,179
We will become
something and show you.

480
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:12,780
Then even if you beg us,
we will not come back.

481
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Stick to your words!
- l was only joking.

482
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,059
Get out!

483
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,300
Aunty, thanks for creating a rift
between a father and his sons.

484
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,860
Let's go, Bajrangi.

485
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,900
See, even a monkey understands,
but you don't.

486
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,340
Friends, well wishers...

487
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,380
those who cheat and loot...

488
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,579
and those who kill for money...

489
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:53,739
better than those is my monkey
who earns money for his masters...

490
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:59,400
and leads a quiet life.
So please applaud my monkey!

491
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,920
What is he doing here?

492
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,079
lt is not their fault.

493
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,079
Kids tend to go wayward if they lose
their mother so early in life.

494
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,079
l tried my best to give them
both, a father and mother's love.

495
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,280
But today l realise that no
one can take a mother's place.

496
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,119
You realise that now? Were your
senses asleep since so many years?

497
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,079
Pardon me, but you should
have got married long ago...

498
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,159
if not for yourself,
then at least for your sons.

499
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:53,079
Why didn't you?
- l used to love my wife very much.

500
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,079
l haven't found anyone
like her until today.

501
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,480
Until today?
- No, until a few days back.

502
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,159
But now l think my sons
will very soon get a mother.

503
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:09,599
lndeed!

504
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,079
By the way, what is
your programme for today?

505
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,079
Nothing important.
- Then shall we go out for a coffee?

506
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:19,079
lt will be an outing and...
- Not a bad idea. Let's go.

507
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,559
Great!
Just a minute.

508
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:26,079
This flower was waiting to
adorn your hair. lf...

509
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:28,079
Please.
- My pleasure.

510
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,280
''My friend is no more a friend''

511
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,199
''My lover remains
no more my lover''

512
00:56:46,199 --> 00:57:01,710
''O Life, l don't
trust you anymore''

513
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,110
Come off it. You are my
childhood friend, aren't you?

514
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,550
Childhood friend? lf you knew
the real meaning of friendship...

515
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,429
you wouldn't
back stab your friend.

516
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,429
When did l back stab you?
What nonsense are you talking?

517
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:18,269
Am l? Hadn't you gone to
Anuradha's house yesterday?

518
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,030
Anuradha...? Yes, but what has that
got to do with back stabbing?

519
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,829
The way you talk like
as if you know nothing.

520
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:29,070
She is the lover of
your childhood friend.

521
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:35,829
Who?... Anu...
What are you saying!

522
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,989
Honestly, l didn't know you love her.
l'm sorry, l didn't know.

523
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,630
You liar, you know
that woman is my life.

524
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,349
l used to take your car and
go to Sangampur. For what?

525
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:52,349
You had told me but
l didn't remember. l forgot.

526
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:58,550
lt is l who tends to forget,
how did you forget?

527
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:03,030
Shall l tell you the truth? You
didn't forget, your intention was bad.

528
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,869
Before looking at her, you
should have given a thought...

529
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:10,550
to the fact that you are
eying your sister-in-law.

530
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,030
lt was she who looked at me first.
- Really?

531
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,429
And she fell in love
with me at first sight.

532
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:22,030
She loves me. We are having an
affair since the last two years.

533
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,269
You are mistaken, she loves me.

534
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:28,030
We'll confirm that in the evening.
- On her birthday party?

535
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,429
You know even that?
Doesn't matter.

536
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:36,550
You can check in the evening who
she is paying more attention to.

537
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,150
Whether you or me.
- Fine.

538
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,510
The evening will decide whose wife
she will be and whose sister-in-law.

539
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,030
Thank you! Excuse me,
l'll be right back.

540
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,030
Yellow and red.
They look beautiful!

541
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,110
Woman is such a wonderful
creation of God.

542
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,550
You like her even when she's angry.
- Yes.

543
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,829
ls everything all right?
- By your grace, it is.

544
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:09,429
Excuse me.

545
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:26,030
Hasmukh, she is paying equal
attention to both of us.

546
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,670
l think she loves both of us.

547
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,829
So one of us will have
to sacrifice our love.

548
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:41,150
But who will make that sacrifice?

549
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,030
We have been to school
and college together.

550
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,110
We have shared ourjoys and sorrows.

551
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:57,030
You want our friendship of
years to break for one woman?

552
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,510
No.

553
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:05,429
That's why l'm saying that
one of us will have to sacrifice.

554
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,630
That is what l'm asking you,
who will make that sacrifice?

555
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,030
Who will make the sacrifice?
You will!

556
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,429
l will not make any sacrifice.

557
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:20,030
You will have to sacrifice!

558
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,030
Are you asking for a sacrifice
or a refund of credit?

559
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,550
Get lost!
Stupid fellow!

560
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,389
You pushed me? Me?
- Yes!

561
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:33,429
For a love two days old, you
beat an old friend of yours?

562
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:36,230
l will not spare you!
- Then get into the ring!

563
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,750
Sure! lf you are a boxer,
then l am a champion in karate.

564
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,030
Hold me, or l will break his head.

565
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,070
Please uncle! Control yourself!
Why are you two fighting?

566
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,510
On the issue of marriage.

567
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,590
But whose marriage?
l forgot.

568
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,429
Hasmukh, what were we fighting over?

569
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,949
Why this fight for the first
time among old friends?

570
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:08,030
Whose marriage were you talking about?
- Munnu's marriage!

571
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:11,829
l told him that since Munnu
loves his daughter...

572
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:14,989
we will now become relatives.
But he got angry on me.

573
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,030
l'm bound to get angry.
l have only one daughter.

574
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,789
Getting her married to your
son would be sending her to hell.

575
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:24,030
You're insulting my brother
in public! Enough of your nonsense!

576
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:32,630
Bunnu, wait. Uncle, before giving your
decision, ask how your daughter feels.

577
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,429
She loves me very much.

578
01:02:35,429 --> 01:02:37,550
No, daddy.
Love? With you?

579
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,030
Ritu and l hate you both.

580
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,590
Hey, listen!

581
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:07,029
That's your car, isn't it?
Who are they?

582
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:11,029
Acquaintances. Stay here,
we'll be right back.

583
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:15,430
Hello! What brings you'll here?

584
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:21,829
We are taking your car.
Repay our loans within two days...

585
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:25,029
or we will sell this
car and recover our money.

586
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:28,829
Don't threaten us. We will throw
your money on your face tomorrow.

587
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:30,069
He means to say that we will
return your money.

588
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:34,229
But today, don't take...
- Look, if we speak loudly...

589
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:39,550
you'll lose face. So quietly
allow us to take the car. Get that?

590
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,430
These girls are here or...

591
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:46,829
Drive carefully! Munnu, it's
good you gave them the car.

592
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,029
One mustn't break a poor man's heart.
- But who were these poor men?

593
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:51,430
They live in the shanties
behind our bungalow.

594
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,430
There's a wedding
in their family tomorrow.

595
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:58,029
They thought of taking
the wedding procession in a car.

596
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,949
So l gave them my car.
- l wasn't ready to give them the car

597
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:09,430
But it was only after meeting you
that l realised what marriage is.

598
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,430
So l agreed to give them the car.

599
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:12,149
Now what do we do?
- Steal.

600
01:11:09,149 --> 01:11:12,510
Thief!
- What are you doing!

601
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,470
Mr.Rai, l have come to steal
here at their insistence.

602
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,029
You dare to lie!
You dare to fool daddy!

603
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:22,149
The lowliest of man will not steal
in his own house. lsn't it, dad?

604
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:25,949
Mr.Rai, l swear...
Mr.Rai!

605
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,029
Before wearing your gloves,
listen to this.

606
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:32,069
What! ln your own house?

607
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,630
Yes. Our old man will
not simply give us money.

608
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,430
lf father's wealth is not used by
his sons, it will rot in the vaults.

609
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,149
lf we steal in someone else's
house, we will go to jail.

610
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:47,550
But if we get caught in our own
house, we'll say we were joking.

611
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:55,909
l knew l could not trust you.

612
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:58,390
That is why l taped this to
protect myself. Look.

613
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,750
Look at it.

614
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:06,310
Mr.Rai, it is not my fault.
lt was on their insistence...

615
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,670
lf they ask you to jump
in a well, will you?

616
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,510
Locked...?
- Try fleeing.

617
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,029
A lock here too?

618
01:12:20,029 --> 01:12:22,029
Bunnu, all routes to
our escape are locked.

619
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:24,029
Who locked all doors?
- l have.

620
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:29,029
So that before throwing you out of
the house, l give you a good thrashing

621
01:12:31,029 --> 01:12:34,630
You have been very evil today.
- How true!

622
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:36,869
You robbed your own house?

623
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:38,829
You'll go for a bigger heist next.
- Oh come on, dad.

624
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:41,430
Then you'll have me murdered.
- No, you're our father after all.

625
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,029
Only until now. From now on, neither
am l your father, nor are you my sons.

626
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:47,789
You'll have to keep one relationship,
either of the father, or the sons.

627
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:49,029
What did you say?
- Or you will regret it.

628
01:12:50,029 --> 01:12:52,989
Or we will do what you
have never even dreamt of.

629
01:12:54,989 --> 01:12:57,750
Hasmukh! Why are you beating
my grandsons?

630
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,029
Grandma, save us!

631
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:04,829
You think yourself
to be a great boxer!

632
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:07,909
Give one glove each to my
grandsons, then you'll know.

633
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:12,829
Take the gloves and fulfill
the desire of your grandma.

634
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:15,029
No daddy, how can we fight with you?

635
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:37,109
Let's take the back-door out!

636
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:53,430
Where were you taking the car?

637
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,229
This is not your uncle's car,
neither is it of those two monkeys.

638
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:01,789
They must have jumped
the back wall and escaped.

639
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,029
Now your punishment is that
you will stay here with me.

640
01:14:04,029 --> 01:14:09,229
Give me the key... and come
inside or l'll thrash you.

641
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:23,189
Can't you see!

642
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:26,149
What are you doing?
You should take care of the child.

643
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:30,869
Do you know whose child this is?
- Whosoever's! A child is a child.

644
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:33,550
He is the chief minister's son.
- So what?... What!!

645
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,029
l don't know how to thank you.

646
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:48,029
You put your lives at stake
and saved my son.

647
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,350
l can never repay this favour.

648
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:56,869
lf l can ever be of any help to
you, l'll be very happy to oblige.

649
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:04,430
lt is we who are pleased that
we could meet you on this pretext.

650
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:09,029
We never imagined even in our dreams
that we would have tea with you.

651
01:15:11,029 --> 01:15:14,029
Notjust tea, you must even
have dinner with us today.

652
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:17,029
Of course.
- That wasn't necessary.

653
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:22,829
lt is notjust me, but
even Chirag who wants that.

654
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:25,829
You must join us
for the party tonight.

655
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:32,430
You have given great
joy to a mother today.

656
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,029
Today is Chirag's birthday.
- What?!

657
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:41,630
Happy birthday, kid.
- May you live long.

658
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:47,109
lf you don't come for the party,
l will not cut the cake.

659
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:50,029
We will surely come.

660
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:56,989
He has already
become friends with you.

661
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:59,029
Excuse me sir, the party workers
are waiting for you.

662
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:04,029
Even the press is going to arrive.
- Did they have to come now?

663
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:10,029
What is the matter, sir?
- You must be reading in the papers...

664
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,829
that bank robberies and
kidnapping cases are on the rise.

665
01:16:13,829 --> 01:16:16,029
The government is answerable. lt is
important, else l'd have sat with you

666
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:30,510
What happened?
- l think we have a flat tyre.

667
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,430
We're from the press. We got an
appointment with the chief minister.

668
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,149
Just a minute.

669
01:17:15,149 --> 01:17:17,029
Hello...
Some press persons are here.

670
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:20,109
They say they have an
appointment with the CM.

671
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:22,989
Let them in.
- Okay.

672
01:18:57,989 --> 01:18:59,430
Are you all right sir?

673
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:17,270
Bunnu, what's going on here?
- Hush.

674
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,029
The chief minister...?
But he is...

675
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:46,470
Who says there are no
good doctors in lndia?

676
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:58,430
Something terrible is going on here.
- That's true.

677
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,510
Exactly like the chief minister.

678
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,109
Greatjob done, doctors!
Notjust the world,...

679
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:08,029
even if the CM himself sees this,
he will be shocked.

680
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:13,829
Well done, doctors!
You have made our dreams come true.

681
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:16,550
You must be rewarded
for the greatjob done.

682
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,029
The CM must have got admitted
to the hospital by now.

683
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:27,909
That is the only place from
where he can be kidnapped and...

684
01:22:28,909 --> 01:22:31,310
Sarang put in his place.

685
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:25,430
Munnu, run away!

686
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:31,029
l said go!
- l will not leave you.

687
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:34,069
Don't be stupid. lt is
very necessary to expose them.

688
01:23:35,069 --> 01:23:37,949
Or the secret we know
will remain a secret.

689
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:42,630
Come what may, l will not
leave you alone to face death.

690
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,029
We will live together
and die together.

691
01:23:45,029 --> 01:23:47,430
Try to understand.
lf you escape...

692
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,750
until l don't tell them about you,
they cannot kill me.

693
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,909
No, Bunnu.
- lf they catch both of us...

694
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:54,390
they will kill us.

695
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:59,430
Munnu go, for my sake, go!

696
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,430
No, Bunnu.
- l said go!

697
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,109
Go and inform the police and daddy.

698
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:06,430
And don't worry about me,
l'll come to no harm.

699
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,069
l don't think he is from the police.

700
01:24:58,069 --> 01:25:01,149
Whether he is from the police or
not, but he has become a risk for us.

701
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:09,069
What you and your friend know was
the result of our month long effort.

702
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:14,510
After knowing this secret,
you cannot get out of here alive.

703
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:17,029
That is for sure.

704
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:23,069
But your death can become easier
if you tell us your friend's name.

705
01:25:24,069 --> 01:25:26,590
And where he has gone from here.

706
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:33,310
Tell us, or you will
die an agonising death.

707
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:40,149
Do what you like, but l will not
let a rogue like you become the CM.

708
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:46,829
l will die, but not reveal my
friend's whereabouts to you.

709
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:20,510
Tell us, darling.
Tell us, please!

710
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,430
l cannot bear to see you in pain.

711
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,829
Tell us.

712
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:44,069
You're back? Where is Bunnu?
- He is in trouble.

713
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:48,029
The whole world is in trouble because
of you, how can you be in trouble?

714
01:26:49,029 --> 01:26:50,229
Last time you said he lost his memory.
What are you going to say now?

715
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:54,510
Believe me, daddy. Some dangerous
gangsters have held Bunnu captive.

716
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:58,109
They plan to kidnap
the chief minister.

717
01:26:59,109 --> 01:27:00,029
The chief minister?
- Yes.

718
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:02,949
Couldn't you tell a bigger lie?

719
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:07,430
Plan to kidnap the prime minister,
the president! You liar!

720
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:10,029
l'm telling the truth.
- Shut-up, you swine!

721
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:12,470
Grandma, please tell him.

722
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,229
Until when will you trouble
your father with your pranks?

723
01:27:17,229 --> 01:27:19,029
You are saying this, grandma?
- Yes!

724
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:22,430
lt is not right to
always lie like that.

725
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:26,670
Then even when you are telling the
truth, people will not believe you.

726
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,829
Why don't you understand this?

727
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:35,750
True, grandma. My truth is being
treated as a lie today.

728
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:40,390
But Bunnu's life
is really in danger.

729
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,390
We beat him mercilessly, but
he refuses to reveal anything.

730
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:50,029
Then kill him.
Take this.

731
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:39,029
What is the matter?

732
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:43,029
Daddy, leave immediately with
Munnu, he needs your help.

733
01:29:44,029 --> 01:29:48,989
Why do you'll look so perturbed?
- Only you can help me now.

734
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:53,909
No one is believing me. Daddy and
Grandma think l am joking like always

735
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:57,350
But this time, l'm
neither joking, nor lying.

736
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,590
Tell me in short what has happened.

737
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:04,430
l am an eye witness
to the attack on the CM.

738
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:07,229
What?
- Yes, and l know those criminals.

739
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:11,989
l have seen all of them.
l even know where they are.

740
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:13,029
They have made a dangerous plan.
- Plan...?

741
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:16,350
They want to kidnap the CM and
put his lookalike in his place.

742
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:19,029
Look a like?
- He isn't really his look a like but...

743
01:30:20,029 --> 01:30:23,750
Stop your nonsense, Bunnu.
This is not your house...

744
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:27,510
but the police station. Do you know
what it means to play pranks here?

745
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:31,270
What is the matter?
Why aren't you believing this man?

746
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:34,550
Because l know him
since he was small.

747
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:39,029
Since their childhood, they
have never said anything but lies.

748
01:30:41,029 --> 01:30:44,029
They have always troubled their
father, but now this is too much!

749
01:30:45,029 --> 01:30:49,029
Maybe he is lying, but what if
he says is even one percent true...

750
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:51,909
then who will be responsible?

751
01:30:51,909 --> 01:30:54,029
Sir, believe me, l'm telling
the truth. Please help me.

752
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:59,750
My brother is in their custody. Sir,
do something or he may lose his life.

753
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,029
Don't worry, the law is
meant to protect people.

754
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:06,789
Besides, this involves
the chief minister.

755
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:09,550
Truth or lies, we'll
have to go with you.

756
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,510
Come, sir.

757
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:31,029
How is this possible?
Priya, everything has changed here.

758
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:34,750
Everything has changed here.
Neither those gangsters...

759
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,229
nor my brother is here.
This place has totally changed.

760
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:39,949
Sometimes you say
the CM will change,...

761
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:43,829
sometimes you say the place has
changed. You are fooling the law.

762
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:47,029
Sir, l'd warned you that coming
with him would be waste of time.

763
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:50,829
He's a liar!
- l'm not lying.

764
01:31:50,829 --> 01:31:53,550
l'm myself surprised
about the change in this place.

765
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,310
How can so much change
occur in one night?

766
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:09,109
You! You brought the
police here yourself?

767
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:16,670
Sir, arrest him.
He killed his brother yesterday.

768
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,430
He was putting the body
in the car and escaping...

769
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:23,069
when l tried to catch him.

770
01:32:24,069 --> 01:32:27,189
He managed to escape,
but l got hold of his coat.

771
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:30,430
She is lying! She is an
accomplice of those goons.

772
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:34,829
Believe me, this is
a conspiracy against me.

773
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:39,470
Hold on! Old woman, how did you know
that the deceased was his brother?

774
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:43,029
Because before dying,
he was saying,...

775
01:32:44,029 --> 01:32:50,789
''Why are you killing me,
l am your brother after all.''

776
01:32:50,789 --> 01:32:53,550
You witch, l will not spare you!

777
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,989
Where is my brother, tell me!

778
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:59,109
Tell me, or l will kill you!

779
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:04,350
You are making a grave mistake, sir.
Believe me, my brother is alive.

780
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,869
He is in their custody.

781
01:33:07,869 --> 01:33:11,069
What are you doing, sir? He is
Munnu, my friend's son, l know him.

782
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:14,029
He can tell 1a thousand lies
but he cannot kill his brother.

783
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:17,470
Only this old woman has said this,
we have no other proof.

784
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:21,550
lnspector Pyare, l have no personal
enmity with your friend's son.

785
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:26,829
But this woman says that she
has seen him kill his brother.

786
01:33:27,829 --> 01:33:31,029
And until his brother is found,
Munnu will remain in police custody.

787
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:57,029
The body is totally decomposed, sir.
lt is very difficult to identify.

788
01:33:58,029 --> 01:34:02,470
Don't worry, we will know from the
chain and watch found on his body.

789
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:06,430
lt was difficult for the police
to identify the body found...

790
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:10,829
but we have found Bunnu's
watch and chain on the body.

791
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:15,829
lnspector, this is a
elaborate prank they are playing.

792
01:34:15,829 --> 01:34:17,590
Prank?
- Yes.

793
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,470
When they left home,
they had threatened me...

794
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:24,029
that they will do something which
l must never have even dreamt of.

795
01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:26,029
And this is what they have done.

796
01:34:27,029 --> 01:34:28,229
One put his chain and
watch on some dead body...

797
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:32,550
and the other went in jail so
that their father becomes frantic.

798
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:35,550
But this time l
won't be fooled by them.

799
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,630
l hope what he is saying is true.

800
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:50,029
But to say it in short,
the police has found a body.

801
01:34:52,029 --> 01:34:54,029
lf Bunnu does not present
himself in 2-3 days...

802
01:34:55,029 --> 01:34:57,029
then he hasn't realised what
big trouble Munnu will fall into.

803
01:35:05,029 --> 01:35:09,670
Oh God, please let Bunnu
be safe wherever he is.

804
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,869
God, save me!

805
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:27,550
Damn you, Gauri Shanker!

806
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:32,229
This is my twelfth pot you have
broken this month. Scoundrel!

807
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:44,510
Run Yadav,
my honour is at stake!

808
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:52,350
First l broke the pot, then l hung
in the air, and now l'm thrown here.

809
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,829
Save me, God.

810
01:36:16,829 --> 01:36:19,029
Gauri Shanker.
- What happened?

811
01:36:20,029 --> 01:36:22,029
Come out, Moti has gone.

812
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:28,109
He has? The naughty dog!
He acts too smart.

813
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:35,029
Wasn't as nice thing to do.

814
01:36:55,029 --> 01:36:56,029
O my God!

815
01:36:58,029 --> 01:37:00,270
Gauri Shanker!
You!

816
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:04,229
O God, pardon me, l
have made a grave mistake.

817
01:37:05,229 --> 01:37:06,229
You are great!

818
01:37:07,229 --> 01:37:12,829
l suffered a loss, my roof broke,
you saw me in this state...

819
01:37:12,829 --> 01:37:14,390
and you seek pardon from God?

820
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:19,829
l'm sorry Chandramukhi, but
this happened because of your dog.

821
01:37:19,829 --> 01:37:21,029
That is why l fell here by mistake.

822
01:37:22,029 --> 01:37:25,470
Why didn't you commit
this mistake before, Gauri?

823
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:31,029
l'm so helpless.
Look Chanda...

824
01:37:32,029 --> 01:37:35,909
don't try to get
close to me, stay away!

825
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:40,270
Don't act smart with me. l'll shout
and collect the whole village here.

826
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:45,029
Shameless man, you enter a single
woman's house through the roof.

827
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:47,029
Moreover, you threaten her.

828
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:54,789
You will have to pay
for this mistake of yours.

829
01:37:54,789 --> 01:37:56,869
Take what you want
and just leave me alone.

830
01:37:57,869 --> 01:38:00,390
Give me a kiss.

831
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:03,430
O my God, such helplessness!

832
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:04,470
Kiss...

833
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:19,029
l didn't know you were so ardent.

834
01:38:20,029 --> 01:38:24,590
l hadn't expected you to be so
happy at the mention of a kiss.

835
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:32,949
ls my touch so electrifying?

836
01:38:34,949 --> 01:38:35,710
O my God!

837
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:45,069
Uncle, Gauri Shanker
broke my pot again today.

838
01:38:46,069 --> 01:38:47,550
Good God!

839
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:55,029
l am fed up of
putting sense into him.

840
01:38:56,029 --> 01:38:58,829
lt is not difficult
to put sense into him.

841
01:38:58,829 --> 01:39:01,510
lf you allow me, l
can do it in a minute.

842
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:03,430
Do what?

843
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:08,829
Will you knock sense into me?
- He misbehaved, and now he threatens

844
01:39:08,829 --> 01:39:11,029
Why are you talking
to father, talk to me.

845
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,470
l know everything. You instigate
these people and bring them here.

846
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:20,029
Stop this act of yours or if
l get angry, you'll regret it.

847
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:24,069
What can you do to
us if you get angry?

848
01:39:26,069 --> 01:39:29,029
What can you do?
- Nothing, l'll just break yourjaw!

849
01:39:31,029 --> 01:39:34,550
Leave him, or l'll kill myself.

850
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,029
What are you doing, father?
- Don't touch me!

851
01:39:38,029 --> 01:39:42,109
You will ruin me one day.
l am sick of your antics!

852
01:39:44,109 --> 01:39:47,149
Therefore, l close my doors on you.

853
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:53,029
No room for you in my house. Get out!
- Going.

854
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:55,430
Then go.
- l'm going!

855
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:59,949
What do you think, that if you
throw me out, l'll go hungry?

856
01:39:59,949 --> 01:40:02,029
There are many who will feed me.
- Get lost!

857
01:40:03,029 --> 01:40:06,029
You don't need to lecture
me before the villagers.

858
01:40:07,029 --> 01:40:10,430
What Gauri Shanker? He throws me
out of the house on every pretext.

859
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:15,069
Always telling me to get out,
get lost! As if l had no respect.

860
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:20,109
l knew beforehand that l'm going
to be thrown out. l'm going.

861
01:40:25,109 --> 01:40:27,430
Did you find Gauri?

862
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:32,029
No uncle, we looked around the
whole village, but couldn't find him.

863
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:36,470
You eat your dinner, uncle.
You have gone hungry all day.

864
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:41,029
My hunger has left with Gauri.

865
01:40:42,029 --> 01:40:44,029
Then why did you have to
throw me out of the house?

866
01:40:46,029 --> 01:40:50,989
First you throw me out of the
house, then you cry over me.

867
01:40:51,989 --> 01:40:55,430
Why simply create a scene?
- All right, now that you are back...

868
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:58,829
have mercy on us.
Come inside and eat.

869
01:40:58,829 --> 01:41:01,029
l don't want to eat! My stomach
is full after hearing his abuses.

870
01:41:03,029 --> 01:41:06,029
All right, pardon him,
he will never scold you again.

871
01:41:07,029 --> 01:41:09,029
Look, uncle is full of remorse.

872
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:14,029
Uncle...
- That is what l don't like about you

873
01:41:15,029 --> 01:41:17,829
l haven't eaten, but you haven't
even ensured that my father has eaten.

874
01:41:17,829 --> 01:41:19,430
l am a young man,
l can bear hunger.

875
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:24,829
You should at least have served my
father. See how sullen he looks.

876
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:29,350
Let us go and eat, father.

877
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:35,430
l haven't seen this
kind of love anywhere.

878
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:40,470
l have no one but Gauri.

879
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:45,949
l was small when l got separated
from my mother and twin brother.

880
01:41:46,949 --> 01:41:51,390
And then one day,
even Gauri's mother died.

881
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,029
Now there is just me and Gauri.

882
01:41:58,029 --> 01:42:02,109
And so that our love isn'tjinxed,
l put a black spot on Gauri's cheek.

883
01:42:06,109 --> 01:42:08,430
Uncle, don't worry.

884
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:14,109
l have managed to woo him a little.
l'll take care of the rest.

885
01:51:02,109 --> 01:51:04,949
Bravo! l love you, Bajrangi.

886
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:09,949
l think the job has been done.

887
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:17,710
Sir, Munnu has escaped
from the lock up.

888
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:21,750
What! That means you helped the man
who is accused of murder escape?

889
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,229
lnspector Pyare Mohan,
you have been bribed.

890
01:51:32,229 --> 01:51:35,550
Have l...?
- But remember, if he's not caught...

891
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:40,510
you will spend
all your life in jail.

892
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:42,109
Jail!

893
01:51:43,109 --> 01:51:46,430
Stay there, l'm coming.
- l understand, sir.

894
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:48,310
You are coming here
and l'm running away.

895
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,750
Hello...
The swine!

896
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:56,909
You have become useless, DCP!

897
01:51:56,909 --> 01:51:59,989
You could not kill an ordinary guy?

898
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:01,430
He has managed to
escape from your custody!

899
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:05,430
You have corrupt men
like you in the police.

900
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:07,510
He is not corrupt, only foolish.

901
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:12,829
l kept him on duty so
that our work becomes easier.

902
01:52:12,829 --> 01:52:16,430
You should have killed him
then itself, but you...

903
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:19,310
You planned to get him
killed in the lock up...

904
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:22,430
so that no one suspects you.

905
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:28,909
The scoundrel has escaped. Find
him! He is too dangerous for us.

906
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:32,430
Our planning of several
years can come to naught.

907
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:42,510
Who is it?

908
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:48,750
Pyare! Where did you come from?

909
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:51,510
Through the window?

910
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:54,550
You sneak into my house in the middle
of the night like thieves? What for?

911
01:52:54,550 --> 01:53:00,430
Your son has shut all doors for me,
so l had to come through the window.

912
01:53:00,430 --> 01:53:02,430
l cannot even go home, the
police is standing guard even there.

913
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:07,149
Your son has ruined me completely.

914
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:10,430
But what has my grandson done?

915
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:15,430
l forgot again.
- You were talking about my son.

916
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,470
Oh yes! He escaped from the lock up.

917
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:23,909
What!
- Yes. l informed the DCP.

918
01:53:23,909 --> 01:53:27,229
Now the DCP is accusing
me of accepting a bribe.

919
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:32,829
Sir, the Deputy Commissioner is here.
- The DCP! l've had it.

920
01:53:32,829 --> 01:53:36,550
Hush! Control yourself.
l'll take care of him.

921
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:42,829
What's going on? Why is the
police parading in my house?

922
01:53:42,829 --> 01:53:45,430
Because your son has
escaped from the lock up.

923
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:46,829
But how?

924
01:53:46,829 --> 01:53:50,430
Because of the foolish inspector
Pyare, who is also your friend.

925
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:55,430
Now even he is an offender, and we're
looking for him along with your son.

926
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:05,229
What happened?
- l'm drowsy, my eyes ache.

927
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:08,430
Have coffee, sir.
- This ass will be caught!

928
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,390
Who is an ass?
- Who did you call an ass?

929
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:13,550
My friend. He acts so foolish,
he will be caught one day.

930
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:17,829
What are you doing here?
We don't want coffee, leave!

931
01:54:18,829 --> 01:54:21,430
l'm telling you, l'm alone at home.
- Sir, there is no one here.

932
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:25,470
l told you.
Sir, can you come aside please?

933
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:31,029
My son has not done anything,
he plays such pranks to trouble me.

934
01:54:32,029 --> 01:54:34,430
Do something to stop the police
from chasing him.

935
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:37,989
l'll pay you the price you name.
- What nonsense?

936
01:54:37,989 --> 01:54:40,510
l don't take bribes.
- You don't?

937
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:44,109
Surprising. Your face
makes one assume you do.

938
01:54:45,109 --> 01:54:46,829
What?
- Forget that.

939
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:50,430
Sir, my son is innocent...
- Your son is not innocent.

940
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,829
He is a very big offender of law.

941
01:54:53,829 --> 01:54:57,430
lt is better that he surrenders
himself to the police soonest...

942
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:00,430
or he will regret it.

943
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:04,109
Listen! You two will keep a round
the clock watch on this house.

944
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:07,430
He will surely come to
meet his father one day.

945
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:09,430
And as soon as he comes, inform me.

946
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:24,869
Have patience, Munnu. God willing,
everything will be all right.

947
01:55:24,869 --> 01:55:28,829
Nothing will be all right. The goons
who can trap me in a murder case...

948
01:55:28,829 --> 01:55:31,470
those who can barge into the
police station and try to kill me...

949
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:34,510
wonder what those cruel men
must have done to my brother.

950
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:38,430
l don't even know if
Bunnu is alive or...

951
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:44,430
l don't know what to do. Where
do l look for those criminals?

952
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:48,829
How do l find out how Bunnu is?

953
01:55:48,829 --> 01:55:52,829
There is one place
where we can catch them.

954
01:55:52,829 --> 01:55:56,390
You said they are going to put an
impostor in CM's place in hospital.

955
01:55:57,390 --> 01:56:01,390
lf we go there, we can catch them.
We can even save the CM.

956
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:14,430
He has come to examine the
CM on our personal request.

957
01:56:14,430 --> 01:56:17,430
l see. Pradhan, take him along.
- Come, sir.

958
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:16,869
Pradhan, there is a call for you.

959
01:58:35,869 --> 01:58:39,430
What are you saying, Munnu?
- Believe me, Mr.Vinod.

960
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:42,630
They are going to plant an impostor
in place of the CM in the hospital.

961
01:58:42,630 --> 01:58:44,229
Some of the hospital
staff is also involved.

962
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:23,710
Hurry!

963
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:25,829
Let him in

964
01:59:44,829 --> 01:59:47,550
Something terrible has
been planned in this hospital.

965
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:53,189
You all please go out.

966
02:00:04,189 --> 02:00:06,510
You tell him, l'll close the door.

967
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:11,069
Do you recognise me, sir?
l'm Munnu.

968
02:00:12,069 --> 02:00:14,229
l know who killed your wife and son.

969
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:18,229
They are very dangerous. Even my
brother Bunnu is in their custody.

970
02:00:19,229 --> 02:00:21,430
And the most important
thing is that...

971
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:25,510
using plastic surgery they've made one
of their men to look just like you

972
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:28,569
They want to substitute you.

973
02:00:37,569 --> 02:00:40,329
Munnu, you were a
bit late in coming here.

974
02:00:41,329 --> 02:00:43,010
The CM has already been changed.

975
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:22,449
Sir, you can arrest me
if you like...

976
02:01:23,449 --> 02:01:26,409
but please believe me,
that rogue is the fake CM.

977
02:01:27,409 --> 02:01:30,449
l know that the CM is fake.

978
02:01:46,449 --> 02:01:51,729
You scoundrels!
Why have you'll brought me here?

979
02:01:53,729 --> 02:01:55,930
What do you want?

980
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:02,329
You'll be told everything when
the time comes. Take him away!

981
02:02:10,329 --> 02:02:13,930
Make the security more tight,
no one should manage to come here.

982
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:22,329
You? l'd told you
not to try to meet me.

983
02:02:24,329 --> 02:02:27,890
That l will contact you myself when
the time comes. Didn't l tell you?

984
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:33,970
When will the time come? After
my brother dies behind the bars?

985
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:37,930
He is being tortured
more and more every day.

986
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:39,130
He is not being
allowed to sleep all night.

987
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:42,210
His condition is terrible.

988
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:46,649
l don't understand what you
all are doing since so many days.

989
02:02:46,649 --> 02:02:50,409
lt is not child's play to get your
brother out of jail. lt'll take time.

990
02:02:51,409 --> 02:02:54,250
Half ourjob has been done.
The CM is in our custody...

991
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:57,890
and our man Sarang
put in his place.

992
02:02:57,890 --> 02:02:59,369
Very soon, Sarang will get
discharged from hospital...

993
02:03:00,369 --> 02:03:02,930
and take the CM's charge.

994
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:05,010
Your brother will then be a free man.
We'll have no problem.

995
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:09,449
There is one problem.
That boy.

996
02:03:10,449 --> 02:03:12,409
He has escaped your hands twice.

997
02:03:13,409 --> 02:03:15,930
He may become the reason
for your death the third time.

998
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:17,930
No one can cause my death!

999
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:22,010
Until now, he was after us,
but now, we will go after him.

1000
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:27,369
The moment we have him, we will
send him where we sent his brother.

1001
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:37,930
Mother, don't worry. l am sure
Bunnu will come to no harm.

1002
02:03:37,930 --> 02:03:42,050
Even l think so.
- Nothing untoward will happen.

1003
02:03:43,050 --> 02:03:47,930
l have an idea which will bring
Bunnu back from wherever he is.

1004
02:03:48,930 --> 02:03:51,689
Have a look, uncle. We will
publish this matter in the newspaper.

1005
02:03:52,689 --> 02:03:56,529
''Dear Bunnu, your grandma
is very worried about you.''

1006
02:03:57,529 --> 02:04:00,930
''Your father has also taken ill.''
- God forbid!

1007
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:02,250
That's written only for effect.

1008
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:07,930
''Wherever you are, please come back.
No questions will be asked.''

1009
02:04:07,930 --> 02:04:09,930
l will even thrash him!

1010
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:15,930
''One who brings this man on
the address given below,...''

1011
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:18,930
''will be given a
reward of 50,000.''

1012
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:22,289
He will come back
only if he is alive!

1013
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:25,930
Munnu! My brother!

1014
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:29,649
Laxmi, he has regained consciousness.
- Really?

1015
02:04:30,649 --> 02:04:33,890
Are you all right now?
- How did l come here?

1016
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:35,970
l brought you here. You were
floating unconscious in the sea.

1017
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:40,329
The bullet just grazed your arm.
l have bandaged it.

1018
02:04:41,329 --> 02:04:45,689
Why did you get shot?
- Why did you get shot?

1019
02:04:49,689 --> 02:04:50,449
Shot...?

1020
02:05:09,449 --> 02:05:12,250
What will you do with an expensive
chain and watch after death?

1021
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:26,329
You want to wear my watch
and chain? Wear my shirt too.

1022
02:05:27,329 --> 02:05:30,329
Wear it.
l said wear it!

1023
02:05:32,329 --> 02:05:36,770
Wear it or l'll pump all
the six bullets into you.

1024
02:05:38,770 --> 02:05:40,329
Now run!

1025
02:05:41,329 --> 02:05:42,770
Run!

1026
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:09,329
You are very lucky.
You have got a new lease of life.

1027
02:06:10,329 --> 02:06:13,729
And this happened
only because of you.

1028
02:06:13,729 --> 02:06:16,930
l will never forget this favour.

1029
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:20,930
l'll be going now.
- Eat something and go.

1030
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:27,930
No thanks. l wonder what state my
family is in with no news on me.

1031
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:29,569
l have to reach Bombay
as soon as possible.

1032
02:06:36,569 --> 02:06:40,930
You look so pleased...

1033
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:45,810
like as if we were going to Bombay
not for Birju's marriage, but ours.

1034
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:48,930
Then...
You sleep, brother.

1035
02:06:49,930 --> 02:06:54,930
Birju is my only childhood friend.
Won't l be pleased?

1036
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:57,810
Besides, l'm going to Bombay
for the first time.

1037
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:02,890
That's all right, but the station
is nearing and we are hungry.

1038
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:22,010
Look!

1039
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:24,729
How much for a samosa?
- One buck.

1040
02:07:24,729 --> 02:07:26,250
Pack ten of them.

1041
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:29,850
Look.
- The face is exactly the same.

1042
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:33,729
But he's not the man.
- This man looks like a village guy.

1043
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:35,329
He is a village guy.

1044
02:07:36,329 --> 02:07:41,970
We'll only cut his pigtail and
collect the reward of Rs.50,000.

1045
02:07:41,970 --> 02:07:44,050
What do you think?
- lt's a great idea.

1046
02:07:45,050 --> 02:07:47,329
Hello! Which village are you from?

1047
02:07:48,329 --> 02:07:51,409
Me? l'm from Handiya.
- That is why you look so handsome.

1048
02:07:52,409 --> 02:07:55,930
You are carrying ten samosas,
that too, each costing five!

1049
02:07:56,930 --> 02:07:58,329
Each cost only one buck.

1050
02:07:59,329 --> 02:08:03,970
You must be joking.
He gives us one for five bucks.

1051
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:10,210
Oh really?... You do look foolish,
that is why he cheated you.

1052
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:14,930
Why don't you give
us one for 2:50?

1053
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:21,930
Sure! That means l'll make
a profit of 1 :50 on each samosa.

1054
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:25,329
Give me all of them and calculate
how much l should pay you.

1055
02:08:26,329 --> 02:08:29,930
2:50 for one,
that makes 5 for two.

1056
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:32,409
7:50 for three,
and for four, it's...

1057
02:08:36,409 --> 02:08:39,770
What happened?
- My train has left!

1058
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:45,930
Someone stop the train!
- Gauri is left behind at the station.

1059
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:47,850
Do something!

1060
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:59,090
Why are you crying?
We will take you to Bombay.

1061
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:03,930
What will l do in Bombay?
l don't even have Birju's address.

1062
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:08,369
There is an ascetic
here who can help you.

1063
02:09:10,369 --> 02:09:13,329
Don't worry, l will give
you your friend's address.

1064
02:09:14,329 --> 02:09:19,729
Close your eyes for ten minutes
and you'll see your friend's face.

1065
02:09:24,729 --> 02:09:27,329
Why are you touching my hair?
- Don't talk.

1066
02:09:28,329 --> 02:09:31,810
lf you break your concentration,
you won't find your friend.

1067
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:33,890
What say?
- All right.

1068
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:43,729
Now open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

1069
02:09:46,729 --> 02:09:50,930
Who is this?
- The younger brother! What say?

1070
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:55,050
You did this to me?

1071
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:58,329
How about this?

1072
02:10:00,329 --> 02:10:01,930
And this?

1073
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:04,850
Where are you going?
How did you like it?

1074
02:10:08,850 --> 02:10:10,930
l lost everything in this city.

1075
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:14,970
My father, my moustache,
my pigtail, everything.

1076
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:18,369
And my... Chandramukhi!

1077
02:10:26,369 --> 02:10:30,329
Now where do l go, what do l do?
Where do l get Birju's address from?

1078
02:10:36,329 --> 02:10:38,529
Who are you?
- Where had you gone, Bunnu?

1079
02:10:38,529 --> 02:10:40,329
l'm not Bunnu. Why are you
forcing yourself on me?

1080
02:10:41,329 --> 02:10:44,729
Stop your pranks! Do you know how
worried your family is about you?

1081
02:10:44,729 --> 02:10:48,930
l am worried. Why should they be?
But how do you know my family?

1082
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:50,529
He's acting again.

1083
02:10:50,529 --> 02:10:54,199
Look Bunnu...
- Who Bunnu? My name is Gauri Shanker

1084
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:58,409
l'm looking for my
friend Birju's house.

1085
02:10:59,409 --> 02:11:02,729
Birju's house?
We'll take you there.

1086
02:11:02,729 --> 02:11:05,810
You should've told us that before.
- You know where he lives?

1087
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:07,729
Yes.
- Really?

1088
02:11:07,729 --> 02:11:11,380
Yes. Get in the car.
- Birju, l'm coming!

1089
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:14,979
Who is this Birju?
Why are you'll bothering me?

1090
02:11:14,979 --> 02:11:17,979
l'm telling you since so long,
but you refuse to listen.

1091
02:11:17,979 --> 02:11:22,899
Please make him understand, he is my
fiance but he refuses to come with us.

1092
02:11:22,899 --> 02:11:27,899
She is your fiancee,
go with her!

1093
02:11:27,899 --> 02:11:29,420
But...
- Go on.

1094
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:33,539
Go in!
- Be a little soft, lady.

1095
02:11:34,539 --> 02:11:36,859
Have you brought me to my
friend's house or to some jail?

1096
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:44,939
O my my! Such a big house.
Whose house is this?

1097
02:11:44,939 --> 02:11:47,420
lt is your father's house.
- Oh come on.

1098
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:51,979
My hut in Handiya is no
comparison to this palace.

1099
02:11:52,979 --> 02:11:57,619
l think Birju has become a
thief after coming to the city.

1100
02:11:58,619 --> 02:12:00,020
Because such a big house can only
be made with that kind of money.

1101
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:04,460
Birju! Where are you?
Come here.

1102
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:12,619
You're back, son!

1103
02:12:12,619 --> 02:12:14,220
Father!

1104
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,500
What are you doing!

1105
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:22,020
Do you know how much l've suffered
after being separated from you?

1106
02:12:23,020 --> 02:12:25,939
Sons like you who want to punish
their father should suffer such fate.

1107
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:29,380
l sometimes feel like
breaking your head. But then...

1108
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:32,979
Now why are you going around me?

1109
02:12:32,979 --> 02:12:36,979
Father, what happened to you
after coming to this city?

1110
02:12:36,979 --> 02:12:39,859
Your style of talking, your clothes,
everything about you has changed.

1111
02:12:43,859 --> 02:12:46,220
Did someone chop your pigtail off?
Look, even mine was chopped off.

1112
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:48,859
Who cut it?
- Pigtail...?

1113
02:12:48,859 --> 02:12:50,779
Yes, who cut it?
- What is he talking?

1114
02:12:50,779 --> 02:12:52,420
He has been troubling us
like that all the way here.

1115
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:56,579
At least he recognised you,
but he refused even to recognise us.

1116
02:12:57,579 --> 02:13:00,979
What nonsense are you talking?
How will l not recognise my father?

1117
02:13:00,979 --> 02:13:05,500
Bunnu...
- Bunnu? Who is this Bunnu, father?

1118
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:08,979
l'm Bunnu.
- Then why are they troubling me?

1119
02:13:08,979 --> 02:13:11,779
Tell them l'm Gauri Shanker.
- Gauri Shanker?

1120
02:13:11,779 --> 02:13:13,060
Yes.
- Look, Gauri Shanker...

1121
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:18,060
stop your act or l'll beat you
to pulp. ls that clear?

1122
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:25,020
Yes it is.
l know now.

1123
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:30,979
You are not my father.
You are someone else.

1124
02:13:31,979 --> 02:13:33,779
l'm not your father?
- No!

1125
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:36,460
l am someone else who looks like him?
- Yes!

1126
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:43,979
Did you hear that, mother?
- My dear grandson! My Bunnu!

1127
02:13:43,979 --> 02:13:46,979
l'm not Bunnu,
my name is Gauri Shanker.

1128
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:48,380
Everyone in this house
calls me Bunnu and hugs me.

1129
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:53,060
Oh yes! l have heard that people in
the city hug you and pick your pocket

1130
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:57,659
Old woman, did you pick
my pocket? Show me your hand.

1131
02:13:57,659 --> 02:13:59,060
How dare you call
your grandma a thief!

1132
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:03,060
You know it is his
habit to pull pranks.

1133
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:05,340
Tell us, where were you until now?

1134
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:08,260
ln Handiya.
- What were you doing there, you ass?

1135
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:11,979
Shut up!
- You keep abusing and beating me.

1136
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:15,979
You better behave nicely with me.

1137
02:14:15,979 --> 02:14:21,619
l see. Just get my boxing gloves.
l want to behave nicely with him.

1138
02:14:21,619 --> 02:14:24,020
Don't you dare beat him near me.

1139
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:28,659
Until l don't beat him,
he doesn't behave himself.

1140
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:33,420
Old man, l thought you were my
father and took your beatings.

1141
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:41,699
But now if you annoy me,
l will beat you to pulp.

1142
02:14:41,699 --> 02:14:43,779
Really?
- Yes.

1143
02:14:44,779 --> 02:14:46,460
You'll beat me?
- Yes.

1144
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:56,979
You have angered me!

1145
02:14:56,979 --> 02:15:00,979
No, Bunnu.
- Will you stab your father?

1146
02:15:00,979 --> 02:15:03,500
Leave my hand,
let me eat the apple.

1147
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:10,420
l'm hungry since morning. Moreover,
these women brought me here.

1148
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:13,380
No one even offered
me a glass of water.

1149
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:17,380
Then he started beating me,
so l got angry.

1150
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:24,060
Or can l ever beat a man
who looks like my father?

1151
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:26,939
Bunnu, you have gone mad.

1152
02:15:29,939 --> 02:15:33,979
Hasmukh, l think someone has
cast an evil spell on our child.

1153
02:15:33,979 --> 02:15:38,979
He has gone mad,
or maybe he has lost his memory.

1154
02:15:47,979 --> 02:15:51,500
Sir, this is Jaichand.
We have a problem.

1155
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:57,300
The boy we had killed is alive.
- What! He's alive?

1156
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:03,979
Yes, sir. But he has lost his memory.
lf you say, we will kill him.

1157
02:16:03,979 --> 02:16:09,979
No, until he recovers his memory,
he will not pose a danger to us.

1158
02:16:09,979 --> 02:16:13,180
But keep a constant watch on him.
On hearing that Bunnu is alive...

1159
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:18,020
his brother will surely come to
meet him. Thereafter, kill them both.

1160
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:22,500
Why are you doing this? Murderers!

1161
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:29,020
What will you get by killing people?
What are you trying to achieve?

1162
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:35,979
Since we have brought you here,
you are asking us this question.

1163
02:16:36,979 --> 02:16:42,620
l'll tell you today what we want,
because we will achieve it tomorrow.

1164
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:48,979
The Natwar Shah you have
kept under tight security...

1165
02:16:48,979 --> 02:16:52,979
will be rescued at sharp 11 .

1166
02:16:52,979 --> 02:16:58,420
Then, at 11:45, he will
leave the country forever.

1167
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:02,219
Shocked, aren't you?

1168
02:17:03,219 --> 02:17:07,299
The man who is sitting in
your chair as the CM...

1169
02:17:08,299 --> 02:17:10,979
will do this very easily.

1170
02:17:10,979 --> 02:17:16,979
And then, you will have to answer
to the citizens of the country...

1171
02:17:16,979 --> 02:17:19,860
about what you did with Natwar.
- You rogue!

1172
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,379
Hello!

1173
02:17:34,379 --> 02:17:36,579
Sir, you have been fatally
attacked twice.

1174
02:17:36,579 --> 02:17:38,180
Can you tell us who is
responsible for these attacks?

1175
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,620
Terrorism is on the
rise in the country.

1176
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:46,379
And then you are aware that
l am infamous for my integrity.

1177
02:17:47,379 --> 02:17:50,379
l think a terrorist group is
responsible for these attacks.

1178
02:17:53,379 --> 02:17:57,180
lt is also possible that
Natwar Shah is behind this.

1179
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:04,540
lt is possible. But l'm not the one
to compromise out of fear for my life

1180
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:10,860
The Natwar Shah issue
will be tackled soon.

1181
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:16,379
Sir, you lost your wife
and son in that attack.

1182
02:18:17,379 --> 02:18:19,379
Can you tell us...
- Please no further question.

1183
02:18:23,379 --> 02:18:26,379
We need some loan from the
government for an orphanage.

1184
02:18:27,379 --> 02:18:31,379
lf you sign this form,
our task will become easier.

1185
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:35,819
l had no choice but to come, Sarang.

1186
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:38,180
l didn't phone because it is
possible that your phone is tapped.

1187
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,260
We have made all the arrangements.

1188
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:44,379
Tejeshwar has said that you
free Natwar at sharp 11 ...

1189
02:18:44,379 --> 02:18:45,340
and reach the same place.

1190
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:48,260
lf you are also ready
with the arrangements,...

1191
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:51,780
put your fake
signature on this.

1192
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:11,860
Tell me where my brother is!

1193
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,180
Where's my brother?

1194
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,700
Stop!

1195
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:21,379
No!... Leave me!

1196
02:19:25,379 --> 02:19:28,979
Uncle, let me go. That woman...
- l will not hear anything you say.

1197
02:19:28,979 --> 02:19:31,379
Or you will take advantage of my
forgetfulness and escape again.

1198
02:19:32,379 --> 02:19:35,819
Take me where you like,
but read this first.

1199
02:19:35,819 --> 02:19:38,420
l will not read anything.
First come to the police station.

1200
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:40,379
Please read it uncle, please!

1201
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:52,219
You made all my efforts go waste
or l would know today where Bunnu is.

1202
02:19:53,219 --> 02:19:54,579
Really?
- Yes.

1203
02:19:54,579 --> 02:19:58,459
Don't worry, inspector
Pyare Mohan is with you.

1204
02:20:00,459 --> 02:20:05,379
How many times do l say that
l'm not Bunnu, l'm not your son.

1205
02:20:06,379 --> 02:20:09,819
l beg of you, just once
say that you are my son...

1206
02:20:09,819 --> 02:20:13,739
so that the warrant
against Munnu gets cancelled.

1207
02:20:13,739 --> 02:20:16,780
No.
- Stop being angry.

1208
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:19,059
lt was a heated moment when your
father said that you are not his son.

1209
02:20:20,059 --> 02:20:22,100
l promise you he will never
throw you out of the house again.

1210
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:26,459
That is what l want.
Throw me out of the house.

1211
02:20:27,459 --> 02:20:30,739
And ask him to be angry, because
he speaks the truth when he's angry.

1212
02:20:30,739 --> 02:20:33,180
l am not his son!
- l will not take his nonsense!

1213
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,379
l will thrash him!
- You go from here.

1214
02:20:37,379 --> 02:20:40,020
Why will you beat me?
l haven't robbed anything.

1215
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:44,379
Calm down, don't get annoyed.
- All right, l'm calm now.

1216
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:50,379
Why are you behaving like this? Why
are you punishing us for your father?

1217
02:20:51,379 --> 02:20:53,420
What have we done?
Why are you punishing us?

1218
02:20:55,420 --> 02:21:01,379
Do you know how we feel? How we
spent each day since you left?

1219
02:21:02,379 --> 02:21:04,299
Do you realise that?

1220
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:07,299
You don't care about
anyone's sorrow, anyone's pain.

1221
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:10,379
You only care about yourself.

1222
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:13,780
You don't care about
anyone else, do you?

1223
02:21:14,780 --> 02:21:18,459
l care about anyone
who is in trouble...

1224
02:21:19,459 --> 02:21:23,059
but since l am myself in
trouble, how can l help you?

1225
02:21:25,059 --> 02:21:30,379
Please don't cry. lf you cry,
even l will start crying.

1226
02:21:31,379 --> 02:21:34,780
Seeing you cry,
l am reminded of Chandramukhi.

1227
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:41,500
She must be so worried about me.
Chandramukhi!

1228
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:53,459
Eat something.
- l don't want it!

1229
02:21:54,459 --> 02:21:56,059
l won't die if l
remain hungry for two days.

1230
02:21:57,059 --> 02:22:01,420
But if you keep me tied here,
a lot of people will get killed.

1231
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:07,940
Whether anyone dies or not, but if
you continue to behave like this...

1232
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:10,899
l will surely die.

1233
02:22:11,899 --> 02:22:13,180
Why are you so angry?

1234
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:19,379
When l put my dog after you, you
used to run around the whole village.

1235
02:22:22,379 --> 02:22:25,379
Dog...?
- Yes. Try and recollect.

1236
02:22:26,379 --> 02:22:32,540
Once you had fallen through my roof.
A snake had got into your dhoti.

1237
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:35,860
Remember how you had laughed then?
- A snake had got into my dhoti?

1238
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:38,219
And l was laughing?

1239
02:22:39,219 --> 02:22:45,379
Look, l beg of you, if l have
done something wrong, forgive me...

1240
02:22:46,379 --> 02:22:49,379
but don't hurt me like that.

1241
02:22:50,379 --> 02:22:54,940
l cannot bear it anymore, Gauri.
How much more do l tolerate?

1242
02:22:54,940 --> 02:22:58,340
lt is me who is tied,
who is suffering,...

1243
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,379
and you say how much
should you tolerate?

1244
02:23:03,379 --> 02:23:04,379
Chandramukhi...

1245
02:23:05,379 --> 02:23:08,780
untie my hands
so that l can eat.

1246
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:11,780
You will eat?
- Yes.

1247
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,299
You won't run away?
- No.

1248
02:23:15,299 --> 02:23:17,180
But first untie my hands.

1249
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:26,940
Don't bother, l will eat myself.

1250
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:35,059
Will you stand and stare at me?
Go and get me some water.

1251
02:23:40,059 --> 02:23:42,579
No Gauri, l will not let you go.
- Out of my way!

1252
02:28:55,579 --> 02:28:58,860
Uncle, grandma!
Bunnu has recovered his memory!

1253
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:05,379
Bunnu, my son!
- Daddy!

1254
02:29:07,379 --> 02:29:09,780
Are you all right?
- Just recovered.

1255
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:12,780
You have recovered?
- Yes.

1256
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:15,899
How much you troubled your grandma!

1257
02:29:15,899 --> 02:29:18,180
Now please remove this dhoti.
- What are you doing?

1258
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:21,940
Did Bunnu roam about nude?
- Stop joking.

1259
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:23,260
Wear your own clothes so that
we can meet the Commissioner...

1260
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:27,860
and get Munnu out of trouble.
- All right.

1261
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:31,579
Once l get out of this house,
all problems will be over.

1262
02:29:31,579 --> 02:29:35,500
Those who have put me in
trouble will now be in trouble.

1263
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,780
What kind of a man is he?

1264
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:47,180
The skin of my hands has peeled off,
but he refuses to say anything.

1265
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:52,899
He will talk!
He'll tell us everything.

1266
02:29:53,899 --> 02:30:00,219
You were asking him until now. Now
l will ask him in my police style.

1267
02:30:07,219 --> 02:30:09,780
Tell me quickly. l have forgotten
what l have to ask you.

1268
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:12,379
We have to ask him
where the CM is.

1269
02:30:29,379 --> 02:30:31,940
Uncle, my brother is alive.
Look!

1270
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:35,100
Get in!

1271
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:38,780
Just drive the car!

1272
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:40,860
Hurry, let's go!

1273
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:49,780
Come on uncle, hurry!

1274
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:54,379
Follow that car.
Come on, fast!

1275
02:30:58,379 --> 02:31:00,379
Faster, uncle.
- Don't worry!

1276
02:31:01,379 --> 02:31:06,459
No one can beat me at driving.
- Hold the steering wheel!

1277
02:31:09,459 --> 02:31:11,940
Turn left.
- l cannot see anything.

1278
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:23,180
Are you blind?

1279
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:34,379
Munnu, my brother!
How are you?

1280
02:31:35,379 --> 02:31:39,780
Do you know how desperate
l have been to meet you?

1281
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:44,860
Why are you so perturbed?
- lf you are here, who was he?

1282
02:31:44,860 --> 02:31:48,420
Whom are you talking about?
- He was with Hasmukh...

1283
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:51,459
he looked just like you. l still
cannot believe he was someone else.

1284
02:31:52,459 --> 02:31:57,700
That means he was Gauri Shanker.
- Who is he?

1285
02:31:57,700 --> 02:32:00,379
The one because of whom
l am confined here. Where is he?

1286
02:32:01,379 --> 02:32:03,379
They have kidnapped him
assuming him to be you.

1287
02:32:04,379 --> 02:32:06,659
The same people
who attacked the CM.

1288
02:32:06,659 --> 02:32:09,780
The whole family is in their custody.
- What!

1289
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:12,500
We have found out where
they have hid the CM.

1290
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,340
l think they must have
taken your family there only.

1291
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:18,899
So what're we waiting for? Let's go!
- Come on.

1292
02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:22,780
Gauri! Where are you
taking my Gauri? Someone stop them!

1293
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:25,899
Gauri, wait!

1294
02:32:25,899 --> 02:32:29,780
Uncle, Gauri...
- What happened?

1295
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:31,379
Stop them.
- Who?

1296
02:32:31,379 --> 02:32:33,780
They kidnapped Gauri.

1297
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:34,780
Why did l kill him?

1298
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:47,940
The memory lapse again!

1299
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:49,059
Listen, where am l?

1300
02:33:52,059 --> 02:33:54,500
What happened?
- What are you doing?

1301
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:57,420
We have come to release everybody,
and you are roaming around freely?

1302
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:00,299
Damn! l'd forgotten again.
- You almost killed us!

1303
02:34:25,299 --> 02:34:28,379
Sir, please leave this
place immediately.

1304
02:35:22,379 --> 02:35:26,500
Hello! l'm inspector Pyare Mohan.
l brought them here to release you.

1305
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:29,459
The scoundrels have
kidnapped our family, sir.

1306
02:35:30,459 --> 02:35:33,020
Don't worry. God willing,
they will come to no harm.

1307
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:35,379
How fast can you drive a car?

1308
02:35:44,379 --> 02:35:47,379
Faster, Munnu. lf my look a like
reaches there...

1309
02:35:47,379 --> 02:35:49,100
he will escape with Natwar Shah.

1310
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:07,780
Come, sir.

1311
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:13,379
Officer, Natwar Shah has to
be shifted to Delhi immediately.

1312
02:36:14,379 --> 02:36:16,379
Why, sir?
- Because CBl has information...

1313
02:36:17,379 --> 02:36:20,379
that his life is in danger. That some
of the security here has been bribed.

1314
02:36:22,379 --> 02:36:24,260
Where did Natwar Shah go?

1315
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:27,860
Where can you take him Mr.Sarang?

1316
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:30,540
You haven't come to release him,
but to get caught yourself.

1317
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,379
Look there.

1318
02:36:46,379 --> 02:36:50,059
Sarang, the law will
punish you for your crimes.

1319
02:36:51,059 --> 02:36:53,059
But for the suffering you
have caused Bunnu and Munnu...

1320
02:36:54,059 --> 02:36:55,379
they will punish you themselves.

1321
02:37:15,379 --> 02:37:18,780
Stop them, their family
is in our custody.

1322
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:21,379
They will be killed,
so better stop them.

1323
02:37:47,379 --> 02:37:49,180
These two have done me great favours.

1324
02:37:51,180 --> 02:37:53,020
l will save their family even if l
have to put my life at stake for it.

1325
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:57,500
Now l will take Natwar Shah
to your accomplices.

1326
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:01,379
But they will think l am Sarang.

1327
02:38:34,379 --> 02:38:37,379
Hey, listen!
What's going on here?

1328
02:38:42,379 --> 02:38:44,780
Two boys got the CM
released and took him away.

1329
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:57,780
Let them come.

1330
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:03,379
Diana, we have a problem.

1331
02:39:05,379 --> 02:39:07,379
lt is possible that the
one who is coming is Sarang.

1332
02:39:09,379 --> 02:39:13,819
And it is also possible
that he is the real CM.

1333
02:39:52,819 --> 02:39:54,459
What are you doing, Tejeshwar?

1334
02:39:55,459 --> 02:39:58,459
Don't worry Natwar,
this is an old game of ours.

1335
02:39:59,459 --> 02:40:04,579
lsn't it, Sarang?
- Yes... yes.

1336
02:40:06,579 --> 02:40:10,379
You have done a great job,
no one even suspected anything.

1337
02:40:12,379 --> 02:40:15,379
Why would anyone suspect?
Don't l look like the real CM?

1338
02:40:16,379 --> 02:40:20,379
Since your plastic surgery,
forget the others...

1339
02:40:20,379 --> 02:40:23,219
even we cannot recognise
whether you are Sarang or the CM.

1340
02:40:28,219 --> 02:40:32,899
Since you have become the CM,
you haven't murdered anybody.

1341
02:40:32,899 --> 02:40:35,260
Your hands must be craving for it.
Kill them all.

1342
02:40:48,260 --> 02:40:50,700
You will not be able
to shoot, chief minister!

1343
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:31,780
l've got stuck between these goons.

1344
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:22,379
l knew the Lord will help us.

1345
02:42:56,379 --> 02:42:58,299
Sir, lnspector Pyare Mohan
reporting Sir.

1346
02:43:02,299 --> 02:43:04,340
You forgot again.
- What?

1347
02:43:04,340 --> 02:43:07,299
That the DCP is their man.
- When will l get over this habit?

1348
02:43:22,299 --> 02:43:23,379
Stop!

1349
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:41,620
Brother, hurry!
- Coming.

1350
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:54,860
Brother, hurry!

1351
02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:58,139
How long you took.
- Come on captain. Hurry up.

1352
02:44:21,139 --> 02:44:26,620
Don't spare him! Even l have
come here to beat him to pulp.

1353
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:46,299
Father!
- Gauri!

1354
02:45:44,299 --> 02:45:48,780
Maybe you've forgotten. l told you
that until you give an account...

1355
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:52,899
of every penny of the people's money,
l won't even let you die.

1356
02:46:16,899 --> 02:46:20,180
Yes, Gauri Shanker.

1357
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:25,780
You beat me so much.

1358
02:46:42,780 --> 02:46:46,700
Sorry sir, but however
foolish honesty may be...

1359
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:48,299
it does earn recognition one day.

1360
02:46:49,299 --> 02:46:53,780
And however smart immorality is,
it has to go behind bars one day.

1361
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:55,180
Come, sir. Move it!

1362
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:14,780
Mother, my fake coins
have worked wonders.

1363
02:47:15,780 --> 02:47:19,579
They used to buy fake medals.
But today they've earned their medals

1364
02:47:19,579 --> 02:47:22,659
Now you realise? Whose grandsons
are they, after all?

1365
02:47:22,659 --> 02:47:23,379
Yours, Mother.

1366
02:47:24,379 --> 02:47:25,340
Rascals!
- Yes?

1367
02:47:26,340 --> 02:47:29,420
Put in a word for me too,
even l worked hard with you.

1368
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:32,379
lnspector Pyare Mohan,
l heard that.

1369
02:47:34,379 --> 02:47:39,659
You have been promoted
as Commissioner of police.

1370
02:47:43,659 --> 02:47:45,139
Congratulations!

1371
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:49,659
Anuradha, l've been dying
to tell you something.

1372
02:47:49,659 --> 02:47:51,819
What do you want to tell?

1373
02:47:51,819 --> 02:47:54,000
Who will be the one
to sacrifice among us?
