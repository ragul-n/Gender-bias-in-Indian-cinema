1
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,800
This hungry people take 2
months money in advance.

2
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,519
Even then they are not satisfied.

3
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,479
Speak up.. come on. Where is he?

4
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,759
I caught you. Don't run.
- Leave me.

5
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,159
You are the famous Anarkali
of this place.

6
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,719
Let me go. Leave me.

7
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Come with me to the prison.
Do some social work there.

8
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,400
Sir, why there?

9
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,759
We will do it here.
- Really?

10
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
Sir.

11
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,879
Really.

12
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,720
Inamdar.
- Yes sir.

13
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,399
Did you find Anarkali or not?

14
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
I am searching for her.

15
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
Go and find her.

16
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
Don't look here and there.
Find her.

17
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,360
Stupid. Hello.

18
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,279
Yes sir.

19
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,199
Alright sir.
It will be done. It will be done.

20
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,879
How many raids should
be done in one night?

21
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,639
One more raid.

22
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,919
Why did you become a police man?

23
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,000
Come here.

24
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,879
Inamadar.
- Yes sir. - What are you doing?

25
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,759
I am searching for Anarkali.

26
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,479
You liar. You donkey. You monkey.

27
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,840
Couldn't you wait for
her in the lock-up?

28
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,839
Go. Shoot the man.

29
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,359
Go you fool.

30
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,079
Inamdhar.

31
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,480
Why are you laughing?

32
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,680
Stop it. It's over. Let's go.

33
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,079
Kasturi fooled the inspector.

34
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,320
Go to Satara. Being my sister
you are doing prostitution.

35
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,719
I will keep you.
Kasturi, did you forget?

36
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,480
How is it? This cap is a problem.

37
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,399
Come here. Catch me.

38
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,519
Call Shanti.

39
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,280
Shanti, Anand's sister. Who is a
prostitute. Call her quickly.

40
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,560
Nandu.
- Everyone's friend.

41
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,120
Nandu.
- Everyone's friend.

42
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,599
Nandu
- Everyone's friend.

43
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,480
They took her too. Where?
- Everyone's friend.

44
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,399
What? A raid took place?

45
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,439
What are you doing?

46
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Police?

47
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Get lost.

48
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,519
A raid took place at her place too.

49
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,599
Because of this election.

50
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,000
These leaders will clean the
whole city in one day.

51
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
Do it. Die.

52
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
What should I do?

53
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,559
Kastur. - What is it?
- Do you have some money?

54
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,199
I am hungry.

55
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,000
I have. I have a million with me.

56
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,840
I have hidden it here.

57
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Even I am hungry.

58
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,400
Crowd of people are coming.

59
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,879
Don't worry. Everyone is eating.

60
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,399
Bye.

61
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,160
Is he staring?

62
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,079
Who?
- That.

63
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,479
Fair one.

64
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,920
Go. Go and speak to him.

65
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
You sit here.

66
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,759
What is it?
- She is good. Just for Rs.200.

67
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,040
What?
- No. No.

68
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,399
Sir, look. Once.

69
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,440
No.

70
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,559
Sir.

71
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,399
No. No. No.

72
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,959
Hey, 150. 100.

73
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
Am I bad in 100. Get lost.

74
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,640
It's my bad luck.

75
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,480
Let's go.

76
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,199
Let's eat something in the canteen.
- How?

77
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,919
Don't worry.

78
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,639
I will handle the canteen fellow.
Come with me.

79
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,639
Hey. Hey.

80
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,199
Hey.
- Hey.

81
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,759
Bring 2 burgers with green chilli.

82
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,919
Bring it.
- Shut up!

83
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
It seems he is a new waiter.

84
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,839
This is not our order.

85
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,759
We know your status.
- Hey! - Hey!

86
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,080
That man told me to give it to you.

87
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,720
Sir. Sir. Please say 2
plates extra. Please!

88
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Please!

89
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,520
He is a great man.

90
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Are you mad?

91
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,039
Not now.

92
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
Where are you?

93
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,919
Come here quickly.
- Speak to him.

94
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
Come here.

95
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,279
What is it?

96
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,040
How is she?

97
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,680
What do you mean?
- Did you like her?

98
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,120
What? - Take her for Rs.200.
She is very beautiful.

99
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,919
What a nice car?

100
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,879
You are very rich. Very rich.

101
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,279
This raid is lucky for us. Right?

102
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,159
Is it?
- Yes. You are great.

103
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120
What are you doing?

104
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,519
Oh!

105
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,600
Hey, really. It was our raid.

106
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,399
Even then we are lucky.

107
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,720
Shut up. What are you talking?

108
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,759
I will make him so happy..
so happy.

109
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,000
Like Anarkali.

110
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,559
I will have only one customer.

111
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,519
He will take a house for me.

112
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,480
Right sir. Am I right?

113
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,440
Tell me sir.
- House?

114
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,159
Anarkali, what is a house..

115
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,200
..I will keep you in a bungalow.
Bungalow.

116
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,279
Is it?

117
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,679
Bungalow.

118
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
Really?

119
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,199
Sir, can I on the music?

120
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,959
Yes. Play it.

121
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,519
It is your car.

122
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Really?

123
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,759
Oh no.

124
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,679
This one is a police man too.

125
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,879
My luck always goes in circle
and gets stuck up.

126
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
Come on.

127
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
Get down Anarkali.

128
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,480
Listen.
Until the election is over don't..

129
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,199
..do prostitution here. Got it?

130
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:07,319
Okay.
Who will feed me? Your father.

131
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,759
Hey, what did you say?

132
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,919
Should I put you in the lock up?

133
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,039
Why are you staring?

134
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,799
You are very proud of your beauty.

135
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,599
Within a year it will fade.

136
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,279
If you haven't got AIDS
yet you will have it.

137
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,280
This was written in your fate.
Go away!

138
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,160
Stupid.

139
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,639
What is it?

140
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,639
Sir.

141
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,279
I haven't got AIDS yet.

142
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,039
But you will surely get it.

143
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
That too from your wife.

144
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,559
Rasik, run.

145
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
Shut up.
- Run. Run.

146
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,159
She robbed my product.

147
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,560
Throw it down. Throw it down.
- Stop!

148
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,240
Come, you are using bad words
for my boss. Come on.

149
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,240
Hey, let your boss go to hell.

150
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,039
I will make you dance in such
a manner that you will fall.

151
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,399
What will you make us dance?
He is making us dance.

152
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,879
The biggest rich man
of this city. Hey!

153
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,879
Did you hear the name of Vaman?

154
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
O God! Is it some minister?

155
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,039
Vaman means a big politician.

156
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,360
The biggest politician
of Maharashtra.

157
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,439
Our Chief minister
works as he says.

158
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,919
But Vaman has no children.

159
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,120
He has a niece. He loves her a lot.

160
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Rajan is having an affair
with his niece.

161
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
Next month both of them will
be getting married.

162
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,960
Now tell me will Rajan
fall for you. No.

163
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
With whom did you pick up a fight?

164
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,639
I didn't know about it.

165
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,040
He has trapped such
a big personality.

166
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,400
Collector, please come in.

167
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,879
Sit down. Pandurang.

168
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,079
Yes. Order a cold drink for
Mr. Kelkar. - Yes sir.

169
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,959
Rajan, for you.
- Give it.

170
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,200
Wow!
- Rasik. Look.

171
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,359
It's 1000 rupees notes.

172
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,399
Your tender will be passed.

173
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,399
Wow, make me a police man
in my next life. Please!

174
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,920
He will surely make you one.
He surely listens to us.

175
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,240
He made you a dealer now.

176
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,160
And me, Anarkali. Nonsense.

177
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,960
Hello. Rajan.

178
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,519
Watch it.
Your wedding will be so grand.

179
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,839
Not only the female
politicians but..

180
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
..all male politicians
will watch it.

181
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,839
Let this bi-election get over.

182
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,639
This election is stuck like
a bone in my throat.

183
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,120
We were winning easily.

184
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,840
But Jadeja is from the opposition.

185
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,319
He went and joined Pandu.
- Forget about him.

186
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,560
We will have to stop Jadeja
somehow. - Yes.

187
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes. But.

188
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,599
Who will stop him?

189
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,480
There is one person who
will do this magic.

190
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,720
Mr. Vaman.
- Yes Mr. Rajan.

191
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,599
If you say it will make
our point strong.

192
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,559
Alright.

193
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,599
I will speak.

194
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,799
Yes Somdutt. Hello.

195
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,800
What? Tomorrow?

196
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,200
Vaman himself.

197
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,879
Okay. Alright. Alright.

198
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,559
Mr. Vaman has done his magic.

199
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,200
What? - Mr. Vaman is coming as
a chief guest in tomorrow's..

200
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,680
..general wedding held
by the women cell.

201
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,440
Great. That's great.

202
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,799
The president is Jadeja.

203
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,079
Jadeja and Mr. Vaman will speak.

204
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes. Mr. Vaman will make him agree.

205
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,240
That's great. It's a great news.

206
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,360
The stage must be surrounded.
- Sir.

207
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,519
Mr. Vaman is here.
He called you urgently.

208
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,600
Is it?
- There is no one inside.

209
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,439
What?
- There is no one.

210
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,519
But I.

211
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,839
You.

212
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,799
Alright.

213
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,759
It's you.

214
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,519
It's for that.

215
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Why didn't you come last night?

216
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
I am not your servant.

217
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,839
That your press the
remote and I come.

218
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,960
You are a servant.

219
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,720
My uncle's..

220
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,479
..biggest servant.

221
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,759
Don't you know..

222
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,960
..why you are getting
married to me?

223
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,160
Okay. Alright.

224
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,559
We won't get married.

225
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
But I want to marry.

226
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,799
I can't wait any longer.

227
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,839
If only we could marry today.

228
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,679
Let's marry.

229
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,839
Where 100 weddings
are taking place..

230
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,960
..one more can be added to it.

231
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Are you mad?

232
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,720
The wedding of Mr. Vaman's niece..

233
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,240
..with this poor people.

234
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,039
So disgusting.

235
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,960
My wedding will be very grand.

236
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,559
Jadeja is stupid.

237
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,359
He changed at the last moment.

238
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,839
He sms that I am not well,
I can't come. Look.

239
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,839
What does he think?
He will win by doing this.

240
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,160
I say Mr. Vaman suspend the
rogue from the party.

241
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,599
Don't dismiss Shyamrao.

242
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,359
I knew he wouldn't come.

243
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,799
What? You knew.

244
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,640
Then you will have a
solution for this.

245
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,039
Not one but 1000 solutions.

246
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,519
I have got many Jadeja's to book.
It is not the first time.

247
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,840
I have the solution to
any other problem too.

248
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,839
I will show you tonight.

249
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,119
Thank you.

250
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,240
I can find my own solution.

251
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,679
Giri. Stop touching my ass.

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
What?

253
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,199
How can I touch it?

254
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,039
My hands are here.
- What do you want to say?

255
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,759
That Mr. Vaman was touching it.

256
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,480
Who me?

257
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,880
How dare you are kidding?

258
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,599
You do bad actions and I am blamed.

259
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
My hands were here.

260
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,639
Even my hands are here.

261
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,200
You can see it. Shyamrao,
his hands are also in the front.

262
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,400
It's a shame.

263
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,759
We are in a big crisis and you
are thinking of these things.

264
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Say sorry.

265
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,719
But Mr. Vaman.

266
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:29,079
You both are standing beside her.

267
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,000
I am so far.

268
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,799
Shut up. - You always say my hands
are longer than the law.

269
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,280
Yes. If is longer than the
law then touch the law.

270
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,399
Say sorry.

271
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,399
I am sorry, Anuradha.

272
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,879
It's alright.

273
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,440
Don't worry about Jadeja,
I will take care of him.

274
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,200
Come on to attend the wedding.
Come on.

275
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,839
Absolutely.

276
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,960
Mr. Vaman,
you put us in a fix sometimes.

277
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,519
Okay.

278
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,440
I can't control myself
when I see a woman.

279
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
What is this?

280
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
Lok Bandhu has kept two trucks
and opened an exhibition.

281
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,759
He will talk against you and
influence the people.

282
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,440
If you say should I arrest him.
- No. I will handle it.

283
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,600
Shake your hand today.
Tomorrow we will shake you.

284
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Where is my garland?

285
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,160
Forget the garland. Wearing a
garland doesn't make you win.

286
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,519
Hello brothers and sisters.

287
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,119
Take this. Adjust with this today.

288
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,919
It is a great privileged for us.

289
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,759
On the occasion of this general
wedding ceremony.

290
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,720
Mr. Vaman himself..

291
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,799
..is here to bless us.

292
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,240
It is a lie.

293
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,480
A grave lie.

294
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,360
Brothers and sisters.

295
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,639
Mr. Vaman is here..

296
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,559
..not to bless you.

297
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,519
But has come here to
appease Jadeja.

298
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Who has left his party
with 40 MLA's.

299
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,720
Your..
- Giri.

300
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,720
Brothers, this argument must end.

301
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,879
He is trying to influence you.

302
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,000
I will tell you the truth.

303
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,079
The truth is.

304
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,960
The truth is what Mr. Lok
Bandhu said.

305
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,119
I have come here to appease Jadeja.

306
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,919
I want to ask the people of Satara.

307
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
Don't two brother have difference?

308
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,120
Doesn't have fights.

309
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,400
But as an elder brother
isn't it my..

310
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,319
..duty to forgive my
younger brother.

311
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,240
So love remains between
two brothers.

312
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,639
There are no problems.
Let the nation grow.

313
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
Tell me am I wrong?

314
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,359
No. No.

315
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,120
Brothers, the point Mr. Vaman
is speaking about..

316
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,319
..he is selling that same nation
and eating up the money.

317
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,679
Mr. Vaman is getting
his niece married..

318
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
..next month in this city..

319
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,160
..grandly.

320
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,200
So? - The government's money
in billions and millions..

321
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,799
..will be flown like water.
The money that is yours and mine.

322
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,239
Look.
- The list of VIP.

323
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
VVIP list.

324
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,039
It is more than 10,000.

325
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,120
Will you vote for Mr. Vaman's
party?

326
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,559
No. No.

327
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,560
Down with Mr. Vaman.
Down with Mr. Vaman.

328
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
Down with Mr. Vaman.

329
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,599
Down with Mr. Vaman.
- Calm down.

330
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,680
Calm down.

331
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,319
It is very shameful.

332
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,240
It is very shameful.

333
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,240
You know me since so many years.

334
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
That stupid.

335
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,920
Idiot.

336
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,600
He is giving bad words.
- You are listening to him.

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
Am I so lowly?

338
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,240
So lowly that..

339
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,480
..I will waste your money
just like that.

340
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,000
This man was right
only in one point.

341
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,799
He is giving me bad words.
- Doesn't matter. - 10,000 guest.

342
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
They are none other.

343
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,720
It is you.
- Great. Great.

344
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,759
The wedding here is
not of 100 pairs.

345
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,480
It is the wedding of 101 pairs.

346
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,599
And that 101th pair is..

347
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,119
..my niece Rashmi and
Inspector Rajan.

348
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,279
Wow! Wow! Wow!

349
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,680
Mr. Vaman.

350
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,319
Hail to Mr. Vaman!

351
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,959
Hail to Mr. Vaman.

352
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,960
Hail to Mr. Vaman.

353
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
Rashmi.

354
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,119
Listen to me Rashmi.

355
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Rashmi.

356
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,680
Try to understand me, Rashmi.

357
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,840
Oh god, what am I listening to.

358
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Rashmi ran away.

359
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,039
Yes.
Now even god can't bring her back.

360
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,680
What to do now?

361
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,799
Mr. Vaman told it in
front of the people.

362
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,360
What if the wedding
doesn't take place?

363
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,240
Wait. Wait.

364
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,720
There are many girls in the ashram.

365
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,440
We will give money to someone and.
- ..ask her to sit for the wedding.

366
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,839
We will hide her face with flowers.
No one will find out.

367
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,279
No. What are you saying?

368
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,200
Giri, the girls here are
very sentimental.

369
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,480
So what? - We will take vows
at the wedding. - True.

370
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,559
What if she doesn't leave
me after marriage?

371
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Corrrect. Correct.

372
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,759
And if the opposition
comes to know then..

373
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,759
..another problem will be created.

374
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,960
What to do? How do we get a girl
who will do what we want?

375
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,879
She shouldn't be from here.

376
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,880
Should be on her own.
She should look like Rashmi.

377
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,160
Who will get ready to
marry in 5 minutes.

378
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,319
Where will we get such a girl?

379
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,360
From the lock up.

380
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,640
Enough. You had 3 plates already.

381
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,279
Do you know how much they
are shouting? Come soon.

382
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,159
Give the money quickly.

383
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,960
You will get it. Mr. Rajan will
give the money. - Mr. Rajan.

384
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,400
If Mr. Rajan shows
his true colours..

385
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,680
..then I will show my colours too.

386
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,559
He will stand lonely as a groom.

387
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,520
Come on, get ready. Mr. Vaman's
niece is getting married.

388
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,399
The media is there.

389
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,160
We have come here.
We are watching the wedding.

390
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,200
Cover your face.

391
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,200
What?
- Hey.

392
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,119
Cover your face.

393
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,359
Stop there.

394
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,600
Now garland each other and
taking fire as witness.

395
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,799
Go behind.

396
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Just a moment.

397
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,600
The deal was for 2000.

398
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,720
Are you mad?

399
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,639
2000 for a wedding.

400
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,240
Are you giving 2000.

401
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,440
Or should I go?
- NO.

402
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,119
I am giving.

403
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Hey.

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,559
Sir. Sir.

405
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,119
Let the wedding get over once.
Then watch it.

406
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,720
I will keep you in the
prison all your life.

407
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,880
Is it? Then take this.

408
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,440
Look, don't act with me.

409
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,160
Now garland each other.

410
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
What are you looking at?

411
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
It's you, Kasturi.

412
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,839
Enjoy this moment.
Look at yourself.

413
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,920
We won't get this opportunity
again in life.

414
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,120
Rajan.
- Rajan.

415
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,479
She's good.

416
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Sir.

417
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Enough.

418
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,640
Look. Even you.

419
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,799
Look at him.

420
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,720
Pray to him.

421
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,120
You had to put Vaman to shame.
You glorified him.

422
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,879
You should have glorified
me with 40..

423
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,319
..MLA's there you put me to shame.

424
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,480
The list was over.
There was no issue. - Issue.

425
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,960
But you cleared my issue.

426
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,199
I will take care. I will take care.

427
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,039
What did you take care of? Music.

428
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,719
Jadeja, Shyamrao will get
the licence of the stage.

429
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,080
Guarantee.
- Licence.

430
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,679
But this will be a big lie.
- So?

431
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,519
What happened?
This is real politics.

432
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,960
Say lie. Openly. Tell it
in front of everyone.

433
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,880
Say with pride but say
it in such a manner..

434
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,599
..that people go crazy for you.

435
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,639
What did you say? Mr.

436
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,959
Jadeja, I will make you the C.M.
- Nonsense.

437
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,039
Will I become a C.M now?
- Forget about being the C.M.

438
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,680
Think of the stage.

439
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,079
You promised me..

440
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,239
..that I will get this licence.

441
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,840
If that doesn't happens then
our relationship is over.

442
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,519
Mukund.

443
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Don't worry.

444
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,559
I am there.

445
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,560
I will use all my resources
for this stage.

446
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,719
Hello India.
I am Vicky Nair from Zee News.

447
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,080
The whole of Maharashtra
waited for this day.

448
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,599
Today Mr. Vaman and Jadeja..

449
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,519
..have united. Now they are
going to meet each other.

450
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,719
I am very happy that..

451
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,919
..Jadea is once again in our party.

452
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,519
One more thing.

453
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,920
The tenders of special
economic cell is open.

454
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,719
The tender will be
given to the one..

455
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,840
..who tender will be the lowest
and that is Shyamrao.

456
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,879
I fully trust you.

457
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,559
I told you fulfil my demand.
Didn't you understand?

458
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,599
Jadeja, have patience.

459
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,480
Where?

460
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,440
I am sorry for the
misunderstanding.

461
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,719
The tender is given to Shyamrao.

462
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,400
You showed your colours.
- Let's go. - No. Wait. Wait.

463
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,519
Since when I am telling you.

464
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,519
You are making me say
the name purposely.

465
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,880
Now tell me say it.

466
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,759
You are not getting the licence.
He is getting it.

467
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,599
Hail to Vamanrao. Hail to Vamanrao.

468
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,319
This is cheating.

469
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,719
This licence has already
been given to me.

470
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,480
When?
- Yesterday. - It's a lie.

471
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,759
Stop this dirty politics.

472
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:41,960
Vaman.
- Shyamrao. - For Jadeja..

473
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,800
..you didn't value our
friendship of years.

474
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,199
Watch how I deal with you.

475
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,560
Shyamrao.
- I will spend money like water.

476
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,000
But I won't let you
win the election.

477
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,280
Shyamrao.
- I know all your vice.

478
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,160
This deal will prove
disaster to you.

479
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,199
You are greedy man.
- Shyamrao. - What are you saying?

480
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,960
Hail to Vamanrao! Hail to Vamanrao!

481
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
Wait there.

482
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,120
Why are you disturbing us?
- Sorry sir.

483
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,320
But where should I take them?

484
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,039
All the rooms are full.
- Let them use my bedroom.

485
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,599
How many more are coming?
- At least a 100.

486
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,360
In my daughter's room. Bathroom.

487
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,079
And if needed send them
to the toilet.

488
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,879
But don't disturb me.

489
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,599
Got it? Go.
- Yes sir.

490
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,639
Let's go. Let's go.

491
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,440
Editor,
the whole reel will be over.

492
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,079
But the stories of Vaman's
scams will not end.

493
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,720
Write it in your newspaper.
- Write it.

494
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,199
And look at this. That Rajan..

495
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,039
..the girl that he married..

496
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,960
..she is not Rashmi.

497
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,599
But a prostitute.

498
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,439
Oh my god!

499
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,800
Oh my god!
- Do you know?

500
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,199
A big scam for you.

501
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,480
Big scandal.
- What? What?

502
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,480
Vaman wants a woman every night.

503
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,880
This can be a big scandal.

504
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,519
MY bedroom. Bedroom.

505
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,359
Okay. Okay. Sir.
- Come. Come.

506
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,240
Shyamrao, tell me one thing.

507
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,159
What are all these prostitutes
doing here?

508
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,200
So that not one is left
for that Mukund Desai?

509
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,480
Now it is his duty to arrange
for the night.

510
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:54,880
Which was earlier mine.

511
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,120
Not only Satara but I
collected all the..

512
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,279
..prostitutes of the
whole district.

513
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,079
So that he doesn't get even one.
- Wow. What a revenge.

514
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,039
Yes. Come soon. Where is she?
Get her out.

515
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,640
Shayamrao's men went there
before us at every place.

516
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,119
I knew. I knew this would happen.

517
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,599
I will go mad. I will go mad.

518
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,880
There is not even one in
the whole district.

519
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,600
Oh no. There is one. There is one.

520
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,360
And not even Shyamrao's
men can touch her.

521
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,119
Who is it? Tell me quickly.

522
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,279
I am ready to pay any amount
for her. Where is she?

523
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,280
Really. She is great.

524
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:51,320
Did you come here for some
special customer?

525
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,559
Is he very sexy?

526
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,480
Pass. Pass. Top class.

527
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,079
Be quick.

528
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,960
Do you know how much is
the deal for tonight?

529
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,279
How much?
- Try to guess.

530
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,840
I haven't seen more than 1000.

531
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,759
Ten times more.

532
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,320
So much?

533
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
It may be the first night.

534
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Look.

535
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,240
I can give it right now if..
- What?

536
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
Tell me. Tell me.

537
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,320
I didn't mean that.

538
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Why not?

539
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,960
After all I am your wife.

540
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,079
Right?

541
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,440
I am your wife, right?

542
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,879
I am your wife.

543
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,880
That was an act.

544
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,200
You were the solution.

545
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,240
Do you like me?

546
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,840
You like me, right?

547
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
I.

548
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,319
Won't you touch me?

549
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
Look.
Liking is something else and..

550
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,559
..a person like you..

551
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,919
..even if I die.

552
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,759
Leave me. What are you doing?

553
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,039
I told you many times that
I am not your husband.

554
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,800
Rashmi, you?

555
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,039
Wow.

556
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,679
That's great.

557
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Really?

558
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,560
You are a good actor.

559
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,519
You acted so well before her.

560
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,440
Rashmi, don't trust her at all.

561
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,599
I had told you on the phone about
her. She is not leaving me.

562
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,480
That is you who took my place
at the general wedding.

563
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,159
You haven't removed
this clothes yet.

564
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,040
She considered this false
game as reality.

565
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,639
Oh no.

566
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,039
You were saying that she is.

567
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,599
See. She is a prostitute.

568
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,639
Even you are a prostitute.

569
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,000
Only difference is the rate.

570
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,960
How dare you?
You are comparing yourself to me.

571
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,960
You don't know who I am.
Fool! I am my uncle's niece.

572
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,679
I can deal with your uncle.

573
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,640
Rajan.
- If I give up the secret.

574
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,599
He will come here and
make a deal with me.

575
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,039
Leave her.

576
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,759
You have to go somewhere.
Come along.

577
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,159
Come, come on.

578
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,639
I am going away with this problem.

579
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,920
Give me the money or
I won't go anywhere.

580
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,719
I won't give you any money
until you leave.

581
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,800
Once the work is over imprison
her again. - Stupid.

582
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,559
I earn the money and he keeps it.

583
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,320
He is making me work for free.

584
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,759
He married me yesterday and
now he is selling me.

585
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:22,599
Do you think I am your property?

586
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,119
Stupid. Policeman.

587
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,000
Hey, where are you taking me?

588
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,719
Tell me.
- Sit down quietly.

589
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Stupid.

590
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,079
Your customer has changed.

591
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,320
You have no other option
then to agree.

592
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:53,199
You will get good money.

593
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,840
What do you mean by good money?

594
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,519
I mean you will get as much
as Rajan was saying.

595
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,079
Leave it.
I always repented in the dark.

596
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,559
Get lost!

597
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,239
Get more.

598
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,520
Thank you friend.
Thank you very much.

599
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,079
Go away. Go.

600
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,199
Rajan was giving a 10
thousand for a night.

601
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,039
Exactly. I vow.

602
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,119
When your rate is 200.

603
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,679
Really. That is true.

604
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,559
Now you want 20 thousand
for one night.

605
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,920
Exactly.
- Meaning.

606
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,119
You didn't understand. Look.

607
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,519
You said to go to circuit house.

608
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,960
I will get 10 thousand
for work there.

609
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,039
He said to stay here the whole
night and not to do any work.

610
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,559
Another 10 thousand
for another work.

611
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,800
Did you understand?
How it's 20 thousand.

612
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,360
She is smart.
- A player.

613
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,440
Sir.

614
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,519
My business is such.

615
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,960
The game is for fun.

616
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,680
And excitement.

617
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,039
Sir, am I right?

618
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,000
Got it.

619
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,480
Look at her attitude.
She will wound anyone.

620
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,519
Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!

621
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,640
What? You gave a brilliant idea.

622
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:36,279
Sorry.

623
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,960
The work that we are going
to tell you for that.

624
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,719
The food is over.

625
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,079
Leave the food. Tell me. - Do you
know how much I will pay you?

626
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,880
How much?

627
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,120
A billion.

628
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,920
A billion?

629
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,880
No need of going anywhere.

630
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,440
I got it. Not to go to Mr. Vaman.

631
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,440
I won't go ever.
I won't ever go. Okay.

632
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,400
Hey, you must go. You must go.

633
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,839
And do something that
his senses wake up.

634
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,639
The animal inside him..

635
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,559
..should come out.
- All your charms.

636
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,200
Show everything. Just dazzle him.

637
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,079
And we will do video
shooting of this.

638
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,480
This will be shown in all
the channels of India.

639
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:00,639
Done.
- Done. - Done.

640
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:09,480
To trap someone..

641
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,320
..is very easy for me, shyam.

642
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,640
But I have terms and condition.
- Term and condition.

643
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,840
I will trap someone else too.

644
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,440
And you must shoot his video too.

645
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,079
Whose?

646
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,119
Inspector Rajan.

647
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:16,519
"Oh god. My heat!"

648
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:22,480
"Is given to you."

649
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,840
"My beloved."

650
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:40,159
"My beloved. It's my fate."

651
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:09,440
"Touch me with love."

652
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:17,320
"I will swing in your arms."

653
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,960
"The heart is restless."

654
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,199
"I am anxious."

655
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,519
"I beckon you."

656
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,519
"I am in love."

657
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:39,440
"You too give me your heart."

658
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:46,880
"You can't escape."

659
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,960
"You too give me your heart."

660
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:56,559
"You can't escape."

661
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,240
"We will be oblivious."

662
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:24,559
"Let the passion be kindled."

663
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:44,199
"Satiate the desire."

664
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,760
"Let the passion be kindled."

665
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:59,440
"Satiate the desire."

666
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,519
"Let the age doesn't pass.."

667
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,639
"..in solitude."

668
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,200
"Listen to me."

669
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:24,840
"Caress me."

670
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,519
"Don't stop yourself."

671
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:38,800
"Let's get oblivious."

672
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:57,519
Oh yeah.

673
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,559
"Hey my heart!"

674
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:20,839
Quick. Quick.

675
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,480
Hey, he is not moving.

676
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,360
Something is wrong.

677
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,920
Kasturi, go and check. Go.

678
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,440
Our shooting is over,
let him stand.

679
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,599
Once he gets tired
he will sit down.

680
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:43,239
Is he tired?

681
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,680
Not breathing.
- Not moving. - Not breathing.

682
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,920
My god. He is dead.

683
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,960
Oh my god! Such a big scandal.
Shoot. Shoot.

684
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,480
Run. Run.

685
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:26,639
Just a moment!

686
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,800
Where is Kasturi?
- Hey.

687
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,239
Vaman. Vaman.

688
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,079
Oh my god!

689
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,880
Rajan. My love.

690
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:53,279
I won't spare you.

691
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,640
Vaman is dead.
But he put you in a fix.

692
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:04,279
I have a video of you and
him enjoying with me.

693
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:06,599
Wait. Wait.

694
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:11,119
Do you know how much money
I got for this?

695
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,519
A billion. Look. Look.

696
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,679
I will get all the money
out of you. Wait.

697
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:19,960
Great. Best night.

698
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,320
This is the best night of my life.

699
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,600
Best night.
I will get best night out of you.

700
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,800
Wait. Wait.

701
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:11,599
Hello. Yes sir.

702
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:13,319
Yes Mr. Purushottam.

703
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,880
Sir.

704
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,719
Sir. Mr. Vaman.

705
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,479
The doctor's are saying
there is no chance.

706
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:25,440
After death..

707
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,159
..destruction.
Everything is on video. Yes.

708
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,960
That girl is in their custody.

709
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,200
She is an prostitute.

710
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,280
Yes sir. Both the work should
be done. Both. Yes sir.

711
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,280
We're lucky that he's coming here.

712
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,039
Look.
We have to do 2 things quickly.

713
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,520
Number one. We will say..

714
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,360
..that Mr. Vaman is alive.

715
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,240
Though the opposition will
say that he is dead. Dead.

716
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Secondly, this video is fake. Fake.

717
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,960
Even the dance of that girl.

718
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Listen.

719
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,079
This girl is our main agenda.

720
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,960
Try and find out that girl.

721
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,279
Put it on red alert.

722
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:13,960
Use as much police as
you want but that..

723
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:16,159
..girl should be here
until morning.

724
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,639
You too have it, Rasik.

725
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,039
Enjoy it.

726
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,320
We are so lucky.

727
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,919
Am I right?

728
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,199
Police.
The police is searching for us.

729
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,640
Rasik, run.
It's the question of a billion.

730
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,879
Can't you see while walking?
- Sorry sir.

731
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,840
He is the same one.

732
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,039
Wait.

733
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,200
Look here.
- Yes sir.

734
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,319
I have seen you somewhere.

735
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,559
Come on, sir. You married me
in the morning. - With you?

736
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:29,879
Yes. In the general wedding.

737
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,280
Among those 100 couples
one pair was ours.

738
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,319
She is my wife. Say hello to sir.

739
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,359
Bless me.
- Alright.

740
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Wait.

741
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:42,519
I have seen you somewhere too.

742
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,239
Lock up.
- Forget the lock up, sir.

743
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,840
Who?
- President. - So what.

744
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:50,039
In the bus.

745
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,720
What happened about the bus?
- On the seat. - What on the seat?

746
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,199
A woman was disguised as a man.
- What?

747
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,000
But how do you know?

748
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,360
She was talking in her sleep.

749
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,679
Did you get it?

750
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,559
Sir, she was taking her name too.

751
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:12,079
Kishori. Something as Kishori.

752
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:14,799
Not Kishori but Kasturi.
- Yes sir. Right.

753
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:17,839
Now she won't be spared.

754
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,480
Catch her. Catch her.

755
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,239
Good job. Thank you.

756
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,200
Say hello to Rasik. And don't
forget your Anarkali. - Alright.

757
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:29,719
It will be in vain.

758
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,280
Will you come quietly or should
I shoot once more.

759
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,280
My fate..

760
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,760
..goes in circle and stop's
at the red light.

761
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,720
We have got a surprising
news on email.

762
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,800
That Indian Congress
People Socialist..

763
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,280
..Democratic Sector Party,
the member..

764
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,680
..Mr. Vamanrao Ganpatrao Nimbakar
has passed away suddenly.

765
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,040
We have got the pictures
of his death. - Hey!

766
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,720
The head quarters of
the ruling party..

767
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,440
..has completely denied this news.

768
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:14,079
We have found a video tape which..

769
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,559
..has Mr.Vaman's dirty pictures.

770
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,839
That we will show that tape after..

771
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,960
..investigating its authenticity.

772
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,519
We've done it.

773
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,120
Giri.
- Yes.

774
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,079
No one know that I have come here.

775
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,920
No. No. - They will understand
that surely there is a crisis.

776
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:52,399
We just kept staring.

777
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,519
But I won't.

778
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,920
Hmm?
- Right.

779
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,400
We need that.
- Wow!

780
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:03,400
What a brilliant idea, sir?

781
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,119
Who is he?

782
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,320
He..
he is the businessman Mukund Desai.

783
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,519
You are doomed.

784
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:19,320
What?
- He is Jadeja's man.

785
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:21,519
Jadeja is with us.

786
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,599
Jadea can never be with me.
- He is with us.

787
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,759
He is waiting to see
when I am thrown..

788
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,519
..out and he becomes the C.M.

789
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,960
Remove him out.

790
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:34,799
It is not needed.

791
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,079
I will go on my own.

792
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:43,679
But before leaving I will surely
tell you one thing.

793
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,760
You are surely a frighten, weak.

794
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,039
Listen.

795
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,719
You are just any C.M.

796
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,719
What is he saying?

797
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:55,279
Wait. Wait.

798
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,440
Do you have the guts of
scolding me again?

799
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:04,959
Not once. But 1000 times.
- What?

800
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,800
Shake hands.

801
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,519
I liked it when you scolded me.

802
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:17,639
Don't worry sir.
I will scold you everyday.

803
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:21,360
Let this channel be doomed.

804
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,000
Look at this dance.

805
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,440
Vaman is on video.

806
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,400
Oh no. Oh no.

807
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:29,440
What to do, sir?

808
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,280
Children. Old people. Family.
All are watching it.

809
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,719
The media has crossed its limit.

810
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:39,879
What is left?

811
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,440
Look,
how he is interested in the girl?

812
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,720
Vaman has done this all his life.

813
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:48,840
What is this?

814
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:51,319
The same girl.

815
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,880
Did you marry her?

816
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,519
Whom did you marry?

817
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,519
A prostitute.

818
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,200
Sir, this is a long and
complicated story.

819
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,639
How can we get it now?

820
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,159
Complicate. This.

821
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,240
Who will solve this
complication now?

822
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,119
Rajan.

823
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:18,879
Tell me so much..

824
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:20,960
..in your wedding snap..

825
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,640
..what is this girl doing?

826
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,960
This wedding is true.
But this bride is fake.

827
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,159
Rashmi ran away at the last moment.

828
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,240
So we had to make this
girl sit in her place.

829
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,039
I got it. I got it.

830
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:36,879
I have a great idea.

831
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,960
This wedding picture will help us.

832
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:43,319
Sir. Sir. What do you mean?
- I mean..

833
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,920
..the girl in the picture.

834
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,280
That is Vaman's niece Rashmi.

835
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,840
No. No. - I know she is a
prostitute who takes Rs.200.

836
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,240
But today onwards she is Rashmi.

837
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:56,599
She married Rajan in front of
so many thousand people.

838
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,320
She garland him and
also took the vows.

839
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,000
Right. Now tell me.

840
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,799
If this girl is Vaman's
niece Rashmi.

841
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:07,519
Then can he do such dirty things..

842
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,200
..with a daughter like niece?

843
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:11,920
Which was shown in the video?

844
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,519
That's why.. and this video.

845
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,120
This is false. This is false.

846
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,239
Sir, I can't do it.

847
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:22,559
Think about it once.
- Think of it.

848
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,080
Speak one by one.

849
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:28,880
Sir, we have only one question.

850
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,879
This girl who takes Rs.200..
suddenly..

851
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,160
..how can she become Vaman's niece?

852
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,280
Why not?
- What?

853
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:41,399
No. I agree.

854
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,519
Rashmi was in America for
the last 2 or 3 years.

855
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,240
But she was staying here since
20 years. Everyone knows her.

856
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:51,920
Who is included in everyone?

857
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,799
Everyone means her parents,
her friends, her college friends.

858
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,119
Everyone. Everyone will say
in the press conference.

859
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:01,639
Kasturi is Rashmi.

860
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,639
All her certificates,
birth certificates..

861
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,240
..driving licence..

862
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,760
..passport,
Aadhar card will be made overnight.

863
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,320
Check and mate.
- What?

864
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,960
You have thought it well.

865
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,040
You are a master. Master.

866
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,120
Rajan.

867
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,320
Now your role is important.

868
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,560
If Kasturi is Rashmi then she is
your wife from here on. Okay.

869
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,360
What?
What are you saying? A prostitute.

870
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,679
Whether she takes 200 or 2 million.

871
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,800
Now on she is your wife until
the elections are over.

872
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,440
Okay. Now don't argue with the
chief minister. Please!

873
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,639
Quick. Quick.

874
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,119
What are you doing here?

875
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,839
Yes.

876
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,480
You didn't feel anything
while taking the money.

877
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:51,399
To take a billion..

878
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,720
..it takes time, my dear.

879
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,640
My dear.

880
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,600
You changed very quickly.

881
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,079
Who will give the rest of the
money? Your dad. - Shut up.

882
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,079
The remaining money isn't here
but at the police station.

883
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,119
I want it right now. Bring it.

884
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:17,000
Sweet.
Sweet. Ma'am, this is your sweet.

885
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,640
We will get your money.

886
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,759
First give me the money.

887
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,120
Then I will do the work.
- Take your Rs.12,000.

888
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,039
Hey, I am not anyone's daughter.
Got it?

889
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,519
I am a prostitute. I know it.

890
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,079
The real thing is..

891
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,760
..I am ready to take Rashmi's
place or not.

892
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Another 12000 for that.

893
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:53,039
Accepted.

894
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:57,759
Let me finish what I am saying.

895
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:00,000
12000.

896
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,880
One day.

897
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,519
Accepted. - Why are you saying
accepted like a new bride?

898
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,200
You will forget it later.

899
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:14,559
When will I get the money?

900
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,880
Everyday before the work begins.

901
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,800
The whole sum together.

902
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,920
Now tell me. Accepted.

903
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:28,199
You accepted it.

904
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,039
So even I am ready to
become his bride.

905
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:34,640
Accept it.

906
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,399
Surprise.
Surprise. Surprise. Breaking news.

907
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,800
The ruling party has changed
today's press conference..

908
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,920
..into a debate under pressure
from the opposition.

909
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:45,920
Live. Now the question
is what is the truth.

910
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:47,519
Brothers and sisters.

911
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,960
Mr. Vaman..

912
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,200
..is like a godfather
to this state.

913
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,319
And the most favourite minister
of the people.

914
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,559
He is blamed so badly..

915
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,680
..that he is flirting
with his niece.

916
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,520
Oh no. Oh no.

917
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,560
I can't even say it.

918
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,880
He dirtied our 5000
year old culture.

919
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,239
This is a lie.

920
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:24,439
Where is Rashmi?

921
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,680
Why haven't you got her out?

922
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,439
Why are you hiding her?

923
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,680
Calm down. Calm down.

924
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,399
Brothers.

925
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,520
If you want..

926
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,199
..that the girl comes here.

927
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,439
Then she will surely come.

928
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,319
But brothers..

929
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,440
..it is not our insult.

930
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:52,800
It will be his. His.

931
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,319
Friends,
such a dirty girl can't be Rashmi.

932
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:26,719
I.. am with Lokmand. Lokmand!

933
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,360
Jadeja, you are welcome.

934
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,680
Hello!

935
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:40,239
Hello!

936
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,880
Her style and attitude proves..

937
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,800
..that she is a prostitute.

938
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,840
She is a prostitute.
- No. No.

939
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,480
I am stylish.

940
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:55,680
As I have lived in America.

941
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:01,319
I was a model.
I used to do cat walk.

942
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,520
LIke this. Like this.

943
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,679
Satara, how is it?

944
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,279
This is the voice of the people.

945
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,760
Our country is because
of those people.

946
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,400
Can't be anyone beside him.
- Great!

947
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,119
Giri, I am with you.
- Jadeja?

948
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,760
What are you doing?

949
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,520
Why are you clapping?

950
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,800
She is a prostitute.

951
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,199
Her reality is.. watch it.

952
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,359
What will you show, Lothu?
- Lothu.

953
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,560
Even my wife didn't call
me that until now.

954
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,319
Is it?

955
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,520
She is not your wife.
She is a prostitute.

956
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,960
Since the last 4 years the
prostitute den that she works in..

957
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,599
..I will call the aunt from there.

958
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,200
Anandi,
please come on the stage quickly.

959
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,279
Hello people.

960
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,439
Listen from her.

961
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,039
What is the truth?

962
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,119
I am Anandi,
house number 13, Goodworks, Pune.

963
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,680
He is our regular client.

964
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:40,760
I know everything about
this Kasturi.

965
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,359
She is a prostitute
since she was 15.

966
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,479
I bailed her out from a lock
up in Pune 4 years ago.

967
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,840
Yes. Since then she is with me.

968
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:56,720
Rustom, Isn't it true?

969
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,840
You are right, Anandi.

970
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,880
Since the time I became an agent.

971
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:06,919
I have seen her at Anandi's place.

972
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,440
Uncle, where are you going?

973
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,480
I don't want to hear
such dirty talks.

974
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,000
You must listen. It increases
your general knowledge.

975
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,600
Sit down.
- No.

976
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,920
Stop this acting.

977
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:30,839
Now I believe that such
a lowly woman..

978
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,680
..can't be Rashmi.

979
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,159
I agree with Lok Bandu completely.

980
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,520
Jadeja, you are welcome again.

981
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,079
I don't understand anything. Hubby.

982
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,800
Hubby.
- What is this? She is your wife.

983
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,119
Go. People are watching.

984
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,440
I.. I am watching.

985
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,720
I am watching how people
are blaming my wife.

986
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:07,880
She.. is being called a prostitute.

987
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:13,239
In reality she doesn't even
know what is this business.

988
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,479
Absolutely.

989
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:21,599
I agree that I was working.

990
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:25,319
I used to do night shifts too.

991
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:30,119
I used to work hard.

992
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,039
But I ask..

993
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:35,880
..to earn a living with your body..

994
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,800
..is it a sin?

995
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:40,559
No. No.

996
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:46,920
Lokhu?
- No.

997
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:50,639
What do you say husband?

998
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,800
No. Absolutely not.

999
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,720
I am proud of you. Proud of you.

1000
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,720
My love for you has grown.

1001
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,960
Yes.
- Really?

1002
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,560
How much has it grown?
I want to see.

1003
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:08,079
Kiss me and show.

1004
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
Why not?

1005
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,079
Even I love my husband.

1006
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,840
Even I will kiss him.

1007
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,880
Watch our love.

1008
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,400
It is fixed for her.
- I told you.

1009
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:21,239
Watch how pure their love is.

1010
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,680
Did you see now you may believe it.

1011
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,199
That she is our Rashmi.

1012
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:28,559
Yes. We believe.

1013
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,280
This is Rashmi. Rashmi. A goddess.

1014
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,320
What are you saying?
What is wrong with you?

1015
01:16:35,399 --> 01:16:39,519
Stupid. Take your money.
You will go to hell.

1016
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,119
You will rot.
You want me to tell lies.

1017
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:50,079
Rashmi, I will pray to god that
you have a good married life.

1018
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,599
Go away.
- I am leaving. Calm down.

1019
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,119
Rashmi. Rashmi.
- Rashmi.

1020
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,239
Rashmi!
- Hey.

1021
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:04,719
This is the voice of the people.

1022
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:10,760
I.. am with the people. These
people make you say lies.

1023
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,920
Forgive me.
- No. No.

1024
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,640
Rashmi. Rashmi. Rashmi.

1025
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,520
Now the people want to listen
to your decision.

1026
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:28,479
No. No. No.

1027
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,520
The audience is right.

1028
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,680
Vaman's niece can be Rashmi.

1029
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:39,439
Brother, today Rashmi..

1030
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,279
..has united all our
political parties.

1031
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,279
Really she is a wonderful woman.

1032
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,599
If Mr. Vaman was here.

1033
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,880
He would be so proud of his niece.

1034
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,600
You mean to say if he was here.

1035
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,039
Here. - Here or there. What
difference does it make?

1036
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,840
May god rest his soul..
- In peace.

1037
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:11,039
It means Mr. Vaman is no more.
Brothers and sisters.

1038
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,080
You just heard that
Mr. Vaman is dead.

1039
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,800
No. No. He isn't dead.

1040
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,360
Mr. Vaman isn't dead.

1041
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:24,920
He can never die.

1042
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,640
Why?
- As he is immortal. - Alright.

1043
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,960
If he is immortal then call
him here. - Call him.

1044
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,439
The people want to see him.
Call him.

1045
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,079
He can't come here today.

1046
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:40,159
Mukund Desai is here.

1047
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:44,839
Mr. Vaman will inaugurate it.
Will he come there or not?

1048
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,840
Answer. - Speak up. - The
people want proof.

1049
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,079
Speak up. Speak up.

1050
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,519
You want proof.
- Yes.

1051
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,159
Alright.
- Perfect.

1052
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,079
Your..
- What? What?

1053
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,359
What are you doing?

1054
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,440
Mr. Vaman will come there.
Walk around.

1055
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,840
Shake hands, cut the ribbon
and also give a speech.

1056
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,560
Listen to it then.

1057
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:17,119
Brothers, tomorrow will
be an interesting day.

1058
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,640
Let's see how a corpse will
inaugurate a function.

1059
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:25,679
Mr. Vaman will inaugurate
the function.

1060
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,720
Cut the ribbon.

1061
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,880
He'll also give a speech.
Okay, sir.

1062
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,400
I was listening.
I was listening to everything.

1063
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,319
What should I do with you'll?

1064
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,840
When one problem ends
other faces you.

1065
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,600
How?
How will a dead man inaugurate?

1066
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,440
Tell me. Impossible.

1067
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,920
Girl, why did you need to
talk nonsense there?

1068
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:55,159
We were not talking about the past.

1069
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,840
When a prostitute..

1070
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,720
..is considered Rashmi
by the whole of India.

1071
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,760
I thought,
clear accounts in 500 rupees.

1072
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:06,640
I can't agree. I can't agree.
- Rajan.

1073
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:09,680
Pay her and send her away. Get out.

1074
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,439
Okay sir. Come on.

1075
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,279
Come on.

1076
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yes.

1077
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:20,359
Yes.

1078
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:22,079
Come on.

1079
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:25,079
How do we come out of this trouble?

1080
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:26,960
How? How?

1081
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:35,199
You had told me that
you will scold me.

1082
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,440
Yes. Absolutely.

1083
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,039
I can do it.

1084
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,440
Then scold me?

1085
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,680
Hey, you stupid man.

1086
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,839
You have so much money even
then you are not satisfied.

1087
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,840
A C.M. Like you..

1088
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,960
..should be beaten up.

1089
01:20:54,039 --> 01:20:55,319
Yes. Yes.

1090
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,159
Beat me. Beat me.

1091
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,599
Should I beat you?
- Yes. Beat me.

1092
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,880
The harder you hit me,
the better idea will I get.

1093
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,920
Beat me. Even you.

1094
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:09,800
Me? You are the C.M.

1095
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:13,599
Beat me. Please beat me. Hit me.

1096
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,720
You start.

1097
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,760
I got a brilliant idea.

1098
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,079
Go and announce in tomorrow's
function..

1099
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,799
..Chief Minister Purushotam
Joshi is arriving.

1100
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:35,920
What is the idea?

1101
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,840
Call up BB Atomic research centre.

1102
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:44,239
And call the chief scientist
Krishna Murthy.

1103
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,960
Sir.

1104
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:58,359
Sir, listen to me.

1105
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:11,359
Sir. Sir, I am an scientist of
atomic research. I am not god.

1106
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,360
I can make atomic bomb for you.
Plutonium bomb.

1107
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,239
I can send you to the moon.
I can send you to Mars. But.

1108
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,520
To bring life to a dead man.
It's impossible.

1109
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:27,679
You are misunderstanding me.

1110
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:31,519
Oh! I misunderstood.
Thank god, I misunderstood.

1111
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,280
Sir, please explain again.

1112
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:38,239
You don't have to bring
the dead man to life.

1113
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,239
In fact you have to
make him walk, sit.

1114
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,000
Make him shake hands with people.

1115
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:46,159
Inauguration.
And make him speak for 5 minutes.

1116
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,920
That's all you have to do.

1117
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:50,399
Just so much.

1118
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,359
Alright sir.

1119
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:54,279
You forgot the most
important thing.

1120
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:58,680
What?
- He is a dead man. Dead man.

1121
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,520
No scientist in the world.

1122
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,119
Can't do this work.

1123
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:07,399
But you will do it. - How?
- Krishnamurthy, you will do it.

1124
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,119
You have taken grant from the
government since years.

1125
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:12,960
Is it?

1126
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:15,039
Everything comes from abroad.

1127
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,960
You have to bring a dead man
to life for half an hour.

1128
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:19,039
Can't you do it?

1129
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,880
I will shut down your
research centre.

1130
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,520
Remember it.
You have only today to decide.

1131
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:26,759
Sir. Sir.

1132
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,279
Sir, is it possible. Only 24 hours.

1133
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,560
Deducting 6 hours from it.

1134
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:38,960
How can she be Rashmi?
While I am Rashmi.

1135
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:41,439
Answer me.

1136
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,560
Tell me if she is Rashmi.
Then hell, who am I?

1137
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,319
Rashmi, this is just an act.

1138
01:23:49,239 --> 01:23:52,239
We've to do it.

1139
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:09,880
Here she comes. To show her rights.

1140
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,320
He's upset.

1141
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,480
Rashmi.
- Let's go, darling.

1142
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,079
I don't enjoy sleeping alone.

1143
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:21,600
It's a habit since years.

1144
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:24,119
Come on.
- Shut up.

1145
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:28,239
You are my wife.
But only name sake.

1146
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,760
If I was name sake..

1147
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,840
..then why were you sticking
to me on the stage.

1148
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:35,279
That was just an pretence.

1149
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,640
Stop talking nonsense
and go to sleep. Go.

1150
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:42,599
She is right.
Since the time this drama began.

1151
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,319
You have changed.

1152
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,000
Not only you everyone has changed.

1153
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,880
Today.

1154
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:55,479
Today that..

1155
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:57,920
..Such a act of his.

1156
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,680
Who? Who did what to you?

1157
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:03,719
That Jadeja.

1158
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:09,039
On the pretext of meeting me,
he was hugging me.

1159
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:10,399
Looking at me.

1160
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:13,039
I won't spare that Jadeja.

1161
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:16,880
But you don't worry. I am with you.

1162
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:22,359
Yes darling,
this happens with me daily.

1163
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:24,959
You don't say anything then.

1164
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,039
After all I am your wife.

1165
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,080
Will you go or not?

1166
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,560
I know. I know. You are happy.

1167
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:44,239
You can touch me. You can love
too. But with me.. - Shut up.

1168
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:03,079
Don't talk nonsense, Kasturi.

1169
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,360
Do you think everyone is like you?

1170
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:13,599
Rashmi, let's go from here.

1171
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,800
Just a moment.

1172
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,119
Tell me one thing truthfully.

1173
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,400
Listen..
- No. No.

1174
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,320
Why are you listening to her talks?

1175
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:31,319
She wants our relationship
to break.

1176
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:34,000
In reality she is in love with me.

1177
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:36,840
She thinks that even I love her.

1178
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,599
You are right.

1179
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,320
I trusted you.

1180
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,199
I got emotional.

1181
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,679
Everybody at stand by.
Check motion control.

1182
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:04,319
Check okay.
- What did you do for okay?

1183
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,079
The test is negative.

1184
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,279
Fix the wire of battery number 79A.

1185
01:27:10,119 --> 01:27:11,119
It's done.

1186
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:24,079
Not that one. But that one.

1187
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,199
Below the hand.

1188
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,000
Left. Battery number 79A.

1189
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,960
Yes.

1190
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,600
Section A, ready.

1191
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,079
Ready. Stand by.

1192
01:28:16,199 --> 01:28:20,800
Position.
Will you check the height?

1193
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,880
Body, move forward.

1194
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:28,679
Mr. Vaman has started walking.

1195
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,480
Mr. Vaman is coming to shake hands.

1196
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,159
Shake hands.

1197
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,160
Oh! He is not holding my
hands but my weapon.

1198
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:46,480
He's pressing it hard.
- Listen.

1199
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,800
I am in trouble. Do something.

1200
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,440
About turn. Keep it up. Go.

1201
01:28:56,439 --> 01:29:00,199
What are you doing Krishnamurthy?
I will be useless forever.

1202
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,159
Move forward. Hands up.

1203
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:08,360
Body, wait.. just a minute.

1204
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,039
Mr. C.M, is everything alright?

1205
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:21,840
Krishnamurthy, do something.
Krishnamurthy, do something.

1206
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,359
Mr. Vaman.

1207
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:27,800
Stop it.

1208
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:38,800
Krishnamurthy, do something.

1209
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:44,319
I am sorry.
Not Krishnamurthy. Halt. Halt.

1210
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:50,839
Krishnamurthy, it's very late.
- Don't worry.

1211
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,600
Sir, Sir.

1212
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,000
Not me.

1213
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,400
Body, back to position.

1214
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:16,159
Oh, I am sorry. Sorry.

1215
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,480
It's bad..
- Sir.

1216
01:30:19,079 --> 01:30:20,600
Now ready for the pieces.

1217
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,399
How will the dead body speak?

1218
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,720
Just a moment. Just a moment.

1219
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:27,919
Do you have Mr. Vaman's voice?
- Mr. Vaman's voice?

1220
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,079
Mr. Vaman is dead, right?
- Thank you for the information.

1221
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,520
He will move around dead.

1222
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,760
He will cut the ribbon.

1223
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,440
He will give a speech though dead.

1224
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:43,840
But who will speak in his voice.

1225
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,359
We didn't think about it.

1226
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:51,639
Purshottam.

1227
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,760
Mr. Vaman.

1228
01:30:58,199 --> 01:30:59,399
What are you doing there?

1229
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,800
Go.
Go and get some butter milk for me.

1230
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:07,839
Oh, Yes sir.
- We were talking about your voice.

1231
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,880
Where did the voice come from?

1232
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:17,079
You join the duty at
2 in the night.

1233
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,200
You have 12000 in your pocket.

1234
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:27,000
Kasturi. Kasturi. You spoke
exactly in the same voice.

1235
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:30,800
Great. You solved our problem.

1236
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:35,159
Thank you. Mention not.
Thank you. Mention not.

1237
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,680
But I am going to sleep.

1238
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,880
As I have to leave tomorrow.

1239
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,880
Your trip is canceled.

1240
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,039
You will get what you want.
- Okay.

1241
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:49,840
I want a house in Satara.

1242
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,359
I will live there my whole life.

1243
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,600
It's fate.

1244
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:08,359
Accepted. A good house and monthly
Rs.5000. Is it okay?

1245
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:17,480
You accepted it then even I agree.
Tell me what should I do?

1246
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:22,519
Okay. Ready. - Yes. - This
is the remote for speech.

1247
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,920
Whatever the body has to speak
is fed in its chip.

1248
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:29,599
Understood?
- I am understanding.

1249
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,199
Everything will be fine
if the remote is fine.

1250
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:34,759
The remote is working.
You should be in your senses.

1251
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:36,399
Okay.

1252
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:56,519
Killer. Killer.

1253
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,000
You have to kill someone.

1254
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:02,399
At least you have to shoot
him with 6 bullets.

1255
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,480
Who is it?
- Mr. Vamanrao. - Mr. Vamanrao?

1256
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:09,279
When he will be giving the speech.

1257
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,839
When I clean my face with
a white kerchief.

1258
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,400
Shoot him.
- Okay boss.

1259
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,400
Okay.
But keep the white kerchief ready.

1260
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,239
Okay.
- Okay.

1261
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,039
Listen.

1262
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,279
What is the use of shooting
a dead body?

1263
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:35,680
Mr. Vaman's will be killed
before the people.

1264
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,079
So his death will be hidden.
- Because of Mr. Vamanrao..

1265
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,960
..I could never become a C.M..

1266
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,720
..nor I will be ever
be able to be one.

1267
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,760
Even if he is alive,
he is equal to dead.

1268
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,880
I will blame Jadeja
for Vaman's death.

1269
01:33:58,119 --> 01:34:02,119
Vaman will die. Jadeja will
be a criminal all his life.

1270
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,760
Now we've to do it.

1271
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:05,880
Wait.

1272
01:34:06,039 --> 01:34:11,640
I will smash this stupid C.M.

1273
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,239
Why did you call me again?
- Excuse me.

1274
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:24,239
What happened?
Why did you come back?

1275
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,880
You have to kill one more person.
- Who?

1276
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,120
Kasturi. After shooting Mr. Vaman.

1277
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:35,239
Don't forget to keep
the white kerchief.

1278
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,600
No white kerchief.
No killing. Okay.

1279
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:44,720
Okay. - Why Kasturi?
- Why are you asking?

1280
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,000
You are right.

1281
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:49,479
When the real Rashmi is dead.

1282
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,680
Then what has that
fake Rashmi to do?

1283
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:24,119
Hail to Mr. Vaman!

1284
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,640
Here he comes.

1285
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,159
Hail to Mr. Vaman!
- Hail to Mr. Vaman!

1286
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,280
We request Mr. Vaman..

1287
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:27,719
..that he accepts salutation
from the minister here.

1288
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:31,839
Don't spare Jadeja.

1289
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:33,279
Okay.

1290
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:37,799
Mr. Vaman.

1291
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,640
Traitor, you spread the news
of my death, right?

1292
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,159
More, more.
- Slap.

1293
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,079
You want to become the C.M.?

1294
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:55,399
The people won't let you
become the C.M. At all.

1295
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,800
Am I telling the truth?

1296
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:03,880
Jadeja. Jadeja, Jadeja.

1297
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,159
Now Mr. Vaman..

1298
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:09,039
..will inaugurate the function.

1299
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,359
Killer. He is.

1300
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:49,599
What is happening to Mr. Vaman?
Which button did you press?

1301
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,800
I didn't do anything.
Some wire has gone loose.

1302
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,360
The bullet hit the target.

1303
01:37:56,439 --> 01:37:58,319
Why is he running?

1304
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,680
Will he keep runing?

1305
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,480
Control him.

1306
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,640
How? What should I do?
- Do anything.

1307
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,360
Or the people will throw stones.
Sing patriotic songs. Quick.

1308
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:21,039
Why hasn't he died yet?

1309
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:31,920
Attention. Attention.

1310
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:41,880
"Hey nation. Hey nation."

1311
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:45,680
Let's move ahead.
- Let me see now.

1312
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,279
What is wrong?

1313
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:58,960
Why isn't he dead? - That's great.
Front. Back. Left. Right.

1314
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:03,920
Patriotism is on all sides.
- Let me see now.

1315
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,920
He started dancing again.
- Kasturi, song number 2. Number 2.

1316
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:42,720
"Hey! Hey! Nation. Nation."

1317
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:49,079
"Come on, giddy-up!"

1318
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:59,560
You're mine. Funk it.

1319
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,280
He is still alive.

1320
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:19,240
What is your killer doing?
- God knows what is waiting for.

1321
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,760
Show him the white kerchief.

1322
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:25,279
Kerchief?
- Yes.

1323
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:30,840
I lost my kerchief.
- Lost it. - Yes.

1324
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,560
Hello.
- Hey.

1325
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:38,159
Brother, bullet. Bullet.

1326
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,840
When will you shoot?
- He is not dying.

1327
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:44,359
Do one thing.
Show me the white kerchief.

1328
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,079
White kerchief is lost.

1329
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:48,920
I told you if there is
no white kerchief..

1330
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,359
..then there is no killing.

1331
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,920
Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

1332
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:58,199
Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey. - Hey. Hey.

1333
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:06,119
Hey. Hey.
- O God.

1334
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:13,079
Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey. - He is dancing again.

1335
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:19,119
"Rock and roll."

1336
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,279
Oh.. He's dancing.

1337
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:23,359
What should I do?

1338
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:29,039
"O beloved.."

1339
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:34,479
"Let's rock and roll."

1340
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:37,840
You can see all the white
kerchief's. Now shoot.

1341
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:40,960
But we had spoken about
one white kerchief.

1342
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:42,880
Not so many kerchief's.

1343
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,760
Okay. Will red do?

1344
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,840
But the charge will be double.
Is it okay?

1345
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:50,199
Alright. Agreed. Now shoot.

1346
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:55,200
Double charge.
- Wow! Wow!

1347
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,319
He stopped dancing.
But why isn't he dying.

1348
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:14,759
Why don't you shoot?

1349
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:20,679
No. No. Not at all. Now I
won't shoot even once.

1350
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:23,720
Let me know where is the problem.

1351
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Why aren't the bullet's working?

1352
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:33,399
Let me do one thing.
Let me shoot myself.

1353
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:36,599
One. Two. Three.

1354
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,119
Hello. Ready.

1355
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,239
Shoot when Mr. Vaman
starts speaking.

1356
01:42:43,479 --> 01:42:44,959
Okay.
- Okay boss.

1357
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:48,239
Now I'll do the destruction.

1358
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,560
Sing. Sing again.

1359
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:00,160
Sing anything.
- How much will I sing? - Wait.

1360
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,239
Anything.

1361
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:03,439
Dog and the cat.
- Dog and the cat?

1362
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,800
It will do.

1363
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:34,759
"Whoever it is please come.
Please come."

1364
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,640
"We will befriend you."

1365
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:43,840
"Come. Come."

1366
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:47,839
Brother, you and here?

1367
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,279
Did you take a contract?
- Yes.

1368
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:54,599
Whose? Blood?

1369
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:59,480
Brother, who shot you?
Tell me the name.

1370
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:02,319
I shot myself.
- You shot yourself?

1371
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,079
Brother, you commited suicide.

1372
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:08,559
Brother, why? Why?

1373
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:10,600
Why? Why did you do it?

1374
01:44:11,319 --> 01:44:13,960
Jade.

1375
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:16,519
Jadeja.

1376
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,600
You took Jadeja's contract.

1377
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,720
Brother, I will kill Jadeja.

1378
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,960
Brother, I will kill him.

1379
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:27,600
Jadeja.-Jadeja is a big fool.

1380
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,440
You are a donkey..
- Tell it once more.

1381
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:35,760
Brother, tell me once more.
- Donkey.

1382
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,200
Brother.

1383
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:48,039
"Keep moving ahead."

1384
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:56,479
"Let's keep going."

1385
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,640
Leave it. I will kill Mr.Vaman
will the machine gun.

1386
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:23,319
Look at this Jadeja.

1387
01:45:24,119 --> 01:45:25,760
I will rectify my mistake.

1388
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:29,880
Someone killed Mr. Vaman.
Killed Mr. Vaman.

1389
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,319
Who is that?

1390
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:38,160
Why doesn't he come out?
I'll teach him a lesson.

1391
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,319
Kill us also.

1392
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,240
Kasturi, no one can save you.
- Shoot.

1393
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:54,000
I killed the one who gave
me the contract.

1394
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:58,000
I didn't tell him to kill him.

1395
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,760
Kasturi, you won't be spared.

1396
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,760
Oh my god! Mukund Desai is dead.

1397
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,079
I knew. I knew it.

1398
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,480
This was going to happen.

1399
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,439
Did you have a wholesale
deal with the killer?

1400
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,680
Giri, get aside.
- You are shooting a woman.

1401
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:33,119
If you have the guts then shoot me.
- Old man, take it.

1402
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:41,960
What difference does it make?

1403
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:44,680
Actually our success.

1404
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,720
Good one.

1405
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,159
How many will he kill?

1406
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,800
What are you doing?
- Who is speaking?

1407
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:01,079
Your father. Jadeja.

1408
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,600
Jadeja, your are next.
Good that you called. Wait there.

1409
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:19,479
Run. Run.

1410
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,800
The killer is there.

1411
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:26,039
Kill him.

1412
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,960
Oh my God!
This is truly catastrophic.

1413
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:43,239
This has never happened in
the history of India.

1414
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:45,920
The whole stage is full
of dead bodies.

1415
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,000
Brother, this is a big..

1416
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,440
..international conspiracy.

1417
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,159
But friends.

1418
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,159
Mr. Vaman isn't dead.

1419
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,720
But has given his life
for the country.

1420
01:48:02,279 --> 01:48:04,319
That's why I..

1421
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,680
..propose the name..

1422
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:10,920
..of Rashmi,
the niece of Mr. Vaman..

1423
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:12,880
..who is like a daughter to him..

1424
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,560
..for the post of chief minister.

1425
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:21,239
I'm doing this as there
is no one left.

1426
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:28,479
Friends, Rashmi will be our chief
minister from tomorrow.

1427
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,560
Hail to Rashmi!

1428
01:48:32,119 --> 01:48:35,760
Hail to Rashmi!

1429
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,119
Hail to Rashmi!

1430
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:42,439
Kasturi as a chief minister.

1431
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,400
But I am Rashmi.

1432
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,439
I must be the chief minister.

1433
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:00,159
Rashmi. Rashmi.

1434
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,039
What is wrong with you, Rashmi?

1435
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:07,760
We have just got the
news that Rashmi..

1436
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,000
..is the proposed chief minister.

1437
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,159
Congratulations.
- I am her husband.

1438
01:49:47,399 --> 01:49:51,279
Wow! She loves her husband.

1439
01:49:57,439 --> 01:49:59,039
Hail to Rashmi.

1440
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:00,559
Hail to Rashmi!

1441
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,480
Hail to Rashmi!

1442
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,199
After the murders at inauguration
function..

1443
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:08,399
..was the most shameful act..

1444
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,200
..of the political history.

1445
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:14,759
Jadeja wanted Rashmi to be
his remote control but..

1446
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:19,680
..he had a face off. All his
MLA's are supporting Rashmi.

1447
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,720
The C.M. Has promised everyone
to give everyone top post.

1448
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,320
That too with a unusual condition.

1449
01:50:27,399 --> 01:50:30,279
The condition is that
all the MLA's..

1450
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,960
..will have to marry prostitutes.

1451
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:35,720
This is that place where you
will see prostitutes..

1452
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:38,360
..getting married in a general
wedding ceremony.

1453
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:44,440
We have to see how Mr. Jadeja
wins this situation.

1454
01:50:49,479 --> 01:50:55,119
No. No. There is no other
way other than resigning.

1455
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,560
The people who made you Rashmi..

1456
01:50:57,640 --> 01:51:00,280
..her parents,
relatives, college friends.

1457
01:51:00,359 --> 01:51:02,719
All are ready to give
witness against you.

1458
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,560
Even Rashmi is supporting me.

1459
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,560
I don't believe it. She hates you.

1460
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,960
That was the past.

1461
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,680
And for you kind information
we have got married.

1462
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,400
Don't you believe it?

1463
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:29,559
Look. See it with your own eyes.

1464
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:44,519
Rashmi, you.

1465
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,559
He is your father's age.

1466
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,960
How can you marry a
man half your age?

1467
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,079
That too to this womaniser.

1468
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,600
You couldn't bear him touching you.

1469
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,960
Mr. Rajan,
even you couldn't bear her.

1470
01:51:58,199 --> 01:51:59,760
But she became a chief minister.

1471
01:52:02,199 --> 01:52:05,159
You left me unconscious.

1472
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:11,039
The way you sold yourself,
even I did the same thing.

1473
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,199
He has promised me.

1474
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,600
That he said the real Rashmi.

1475
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:21,599
That is me.

1476
01:52:22,279 --> 01:52:24,319
He will make me the chief minister.
- Absolutely.

1477
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:27,159
I will surely make you one.
- And this time..

1478
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:29,079
..the C.M will do what I wish.

1479
01:52:29,319 --> 01:52:32,960
That's why I have taken
the remote in my hand.

1480
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,720
By marrying.

1481
01:52:35,399 --> 01:52:36,679
Rashmi, are you listening?

1482
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:38,920
If he is speaking like
this now then..

1483
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,159
..how will he handle you later.
- Shut up agent - Shut up.

1484
01:52:43,399 --> 01:52:46,679
What is your position?
What do you think?

1485
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,920
She will listen to you.

1486
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,119
You are an inspector who worked
for others all your life.

1487
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:59,760
Let it be. I want to speak to her.

1488
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,200
Who is sitting quiet.

1489
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:05,079
I am waiting for her last decision.

1490
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,800
Look.

1491
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,360
The real thing is that
the real Rashmi..

1492
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:11,039
..should have been the
chief minister.

1493
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:13,400
I didn't want to be one.

1494
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,279
But..
- What?

1495
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,320
Money. Tell me how much do you
want? A million or more.

1496
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,280
I will give you 5 millions.
Is it okay?

1497
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,719
What? Are you speaking about the
post of a chief minister or..

1498
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,680
..some transfer of an inspector.

1499
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,440
Then tell me how much do you want.
Try asking.

1500
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,840
I will do a deal with 25.

1501
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:36,760
Done.
- Done. Okay.

1502
01:53:38,439 --> 01:53:41,960
Done.
- I didn't say done.

1503
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:45,079
Then say it.
- Give me 100 millions.

1504
01:53:45,159 --> 01:53:48,559
Even then no.
- You are doing a mistake.

1505
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:53,400
50 million is the last offer.
Then sorry. - 50 millions.

1506
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,920
Done. Done.
- Shut up agent.

1507
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,239
Please.

1508
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,520
I am still that prostitute
who takes Rs.200.

1509
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,159
After becoming the C.M.

1510
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,560
The whole world..

1511
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,680
..is divided between agents
and prostitutes.

1512
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:48,359
I have seen so many things
in this world.

1513
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,480
So many businessman.

1514
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,840
Big lawyers, IAS officers,
Policemen, Judge, Criminals.

1515
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,319
Everyone has a deal.

1516
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,320
Only one person doesn't
make a deal.

1517
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,520
You've to pay for the deal.

1518
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,039
You..

1519
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,319
..are not the one to get scared.

1520
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,960
If you were god.

1521
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,840
I swear.

1522
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:31,120
I agree that a prostitute is
not capable of being a C.M.

1523
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,480
But is she capable?

1524
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:40,359
Are you capable? Is any elected
MLA is capable of it?

1525
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:45,039
Is there is anyone in the whole
state better than me?The..

1526
01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:49,159
..society doesn't give the chance
to the one who is capable.

1527
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:54,239
Tell me why should I vacate
the C.M's seat.

1528
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,600
I won't ever leave this seat.

1529
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:04,079
I wanted to get promotion on
the murder of 175 MLA's.

1530
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:07,599
But you haven't left
any way out for me.

1531
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,720
What do you mean?

1532
01:56:11,199 --> 01:56:13,319
If one dead body can come to life..

1533
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:15,319
..then why not 175 dead bodies.

1534
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,280
I too was thinking.

1535
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:23,480
I have spoken to scientist
Krishnamurthy.

1536
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,720
In one night.

1537
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:32,719
I feeel everyone is against me.

1538
01:56:36,039 --> 01:56:39,159
And will make the real
Rashmi the C.M.

1539
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:56,880
Is this Tarachand chawl?

1540
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:02,439
Yes. It is. - Does Kasturi
Dhagadu Satpal lives here?

1541
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:06,880
So?

1542
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:10,639
Rajan Kunkude. Her husband.

1543
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,880
Don't worry.

1544
01:57:15,479 --> 01:57:17,719
We are from Siddhantwadi party.

1545
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,319
And also the member
of the Lok Sabha.

1546
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:23,559
We want Kasturi to stand
for Lok Sabha election.

1547
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:25,119
Really?

1548
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:27,800
Yes.

1549
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,560
Please come.
Kasu. Come in. Look who's here.

1550
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:36,319
Please sit down.

1551
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:41,280
Don't worry.
They are not customers.

1552
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:43,480
Tell us your joke.

1553
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,079
We want you to fight..

1554
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:49,079
..the Lok Sabha election
through our party.

1555
01:57:49,359 --> 01:57:50,359
What?

1556
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,960
That was a big joke.

1557
01:57:54,039 --> 01:57:56,479
Who will vote me?
- No.

1558
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,480
You aren't aware.

1559
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,199
You are the favourite
in the whole country.

1560
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:07,000
She cleaned 175 MLA's altogether.

1561
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:09,679
She will surely win for this reason
- Yes.

1562
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:12,039
In your leadership at the centre.

1563
01:58:12,359 --> 01:58:14,599
We will be successful to
form the government.

1564
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,279
We want you to become
the Prime Minister.

1565
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:20,679
Yes.
- What?

1566
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,119
Did you hear?
- Yes.

1567
01:58:24,439 --> 01:58:25,519
Listen to this.

1568
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,960
They want to make me
the Prime Minister.

1569
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:30,079
Why not? We will surely make
you the Prime Minister.

1570
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:33,279
Are you mad?
- No.

1571
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:35,039
She won't listen.

1572
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:37,880
But you said on television.

1573
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:41,760
The one who can run the country
aren't given the opportunity.

1574
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,960
This is a big truth.
- Right.

1575
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:49,399
The least we can do is
to try for this truth.

1576
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,119
What else is left for
our discipline?

1577
01:58:54,119 --> 01:58:57,599
Yes Kasu.
There is no harm in trying.

1578
01:58:58,199 --> 01:59:01,439
At the most we will lose time.

1579
01:59:07,079 --> 01:59:09,600
From P to PM.

1580
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,119
Hey! Hey!

1581
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:14,639
Always be with me.

1582
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:48,519
Will you vote me?

1583
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:25,039
"We are truth. Please come."

1584
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:28,680
"Eat money."

1585
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:33,520
"We will not reform."

1586
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,360
"No matter how hard you try."

1587
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:40,200
"People are like bones."

1588
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:43,800
"The heart is crazy."

1589
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:48,119
"Our field is like lemon."

1590
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,439
"Keep breaking it."

1591
