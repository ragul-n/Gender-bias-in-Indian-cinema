1
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:05,390
ln the 1947-48 Jammu and
Kashmir war against Pakistan..

2
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,433
..Captain Jadoonath Singh
of the First Battalion..

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,468
..was awarded a posthumous Param
Vir Chakra (gallantry medal)..

4
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:14,272
..when he attacked the Pakistanis
with grenades held in his bare..

5
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,274
..hands not once, not
twice, but three times.

6
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:21,370
He took a bullet in his head
and went down fighting for lndia.

7
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,438
1965.

8
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,442
The Rajputs won another Maha
Vir Chakra (gallantry medal).

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,288
Major Baljit Singh
Randhawa gave up his life..

10
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,348
..on 1 7th May in the act of driving
the Pakistanis from Black Rock.

11
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,294
Captain Ranveer Singh and..

12
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,386
..Sepoy Buddh Singh were awarded
the Vir Chakra (gallantry medal)..

13
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,322
..for losing their lives
in winning an outpost..

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,301
..which the lndian
Government promptly returned..

15
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,303
..to Pakistan in an act of goodwill.

16
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,307
ln Kashmir, to this day, every man..

17
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,399
..in the Rajputana Rifles
puts duty before self.

18
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,480
Hawaldar Ranveer Singh didn"t
budge an inch from his post..

19
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,349
..despite an entire section
of men being wiped out.

20
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,316
Even today, nothing means more to them..

21
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,353
..than the honour of their regiment..

22
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,412
The fifth generation
of Rajput soldiers..

23
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,458
..keep the flame alight to this day..

24
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,328
..asking their Rajput brothers
""Who will you die for?""

25
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,466
He says, ""For my battalion"".

26
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,490
And who does the battalion belong to?

27
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,403
The Rajputana..

28
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,494
And who does Rajputana belong to?

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,562
lndia..

30
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,478
And what does lndia do for you?

31
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,440
Ever since the dawn
of democracy, Rajputs..

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,510
..have been repeatedly betrayed.

33
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,413
Sadar Vallabh Bhai Patel
had appealed to us..

34
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,546
Come here.
- ""One lndia..""

35
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,356
Give up your states and become one..

36
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,361
..nation. - Wear this. - He
urged us, we gave them up.

37
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,498
He asked us for our wealth..

38
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,364
We emptied our treasuries..

39
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,400
For one lndia..

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,437
But where, may l ask, is that one lndia?

41
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,540
Our democracy has reached a stage..

42
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,432
..where no one wants to vote anymore.

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,503
Everyone"s nation is the
four walls of their homes.

44
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,550
No government can
accumulate a majority vote..

45
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,478
We had a heritage a thousand years old..

46
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,522
..and at the time they
snatched it from us..

47
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,578
..it was better than what they have now.

48
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,583
ln the name of democracy, all
they do is take power away from us.

49
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,488
And do those very things they
have always accused us of..

50
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,434
The Patiala report only
mentioned the mistakes and..

51
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,400
..indiscretions we
committed. Nothing else.

52
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,440
There isn"t a single act they have
committed that can be called clean.

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,535
To this day people call
us royalty. Royalty!

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,480
They respect us. Why?

55
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,412
Because they know we have
sacrificed for our people.

56
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,419
The King of Jodhpur
once cocked his gun..

57
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,579
..at Vallabh Bhai Patel"s
secretary and said..

58
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,415
""Don"t betray the people of Jodhpur.""

59
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,430
But they betrayed everybody.

60
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,600
ln the 1967 Parliament elections..

61
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,532
..when our crown prince
stood as a candidate..

62
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,658
..then what happened?

63
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,505
The Congress was wiped
out in Rajasthan..

64
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,546
The people voted 24 princes
into power across the nation..

65
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:09,672
What did the government do then?

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,484
They called an All lndia
Congress Committee Conference.

67
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,516
Clamped down on all royal centres..

68
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,615
..and took away all our privileges.

69
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,592
They bought us to our knees.

70
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,651
We had to accept defeat.

71
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,463
We lost because even
after a thousand years..

72
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,523
..we were still wrangling
amongst ourselves.

73
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,605
Enough!

74
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,702
lf we have to rebuild our
Rajputana, we will have to unite.

75
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,570
lf we seek to save our Rajputana
from them, we will have to unite..

76
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,583
A patriot must always
be ready to defend..

77
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,516
..his country against its government.

78
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,611
lt"s time to wage a war!

79
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,589
For our independence, for our land.

80
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,661
And for that, we need
resources and army.

81
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,556
And most importantly, you
will have to shed your blood.

82
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,539
lf you are not ready to
shed blood, stop dreaming!

83
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,696
You will gain nothing.

84
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,508
We will not be able to regain our land..

85
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,512
..respect, the glory we once had..

86
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,649
So, if you are ready to become one..

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,517
lf you are ready to shed your blood..

88
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,678
Let"s say it together..

89
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,613
Hail the land of the brave!

90
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,662
Hail the land of the brave!
- Hail the land of the brave.

91
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,599
Hail Rajputana!
- Hail Rajputana!

92
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,534
Hail Rajputana!
- Hail Rajputana!

93
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,628
Hail the land of the brave!
- Hail the land of the brave.

94
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,738
My grandfather, Noor Mohammed..

95
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,706
..worked for the king here..

96
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,708
He fell in love with the princess..

97
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,576
..the idiot had him buried
alive in these salt pans.

98
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,710
Even had his bones melted.

99
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,713
We need to go right..

100
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,685
..there. That used to
be a British booze joint.

101
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,596
The British called it a "Bar".

102
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,564
They fled but they
left behind their "Bar".

103
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,790
Come.

104
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,732
Where the hell are you?

105
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,638
The customers have come.

106
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,576
Listen.

107
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,717
The train drops you at your doorstep..

108
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,617
This is our local flute
player. He lives here.

109
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,713
Why? No one knows.

110
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,757
You can live here too.

111
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,826
l"ve just seen him play these..

112
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,589
..never sells anything.

113
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:40,598
What is his work, why, when, how,
who.. every question, one reply.

114
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,722
Just like that.

115
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,599
This is 69. 70 minus 1 .

116
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,706
Don"t go right, because
there"s no right.

117
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,814
Does anyone stay here?
- Yes, a student of Desharaj college..

118
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,672
Great chap!

119
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,840
A Rajput?

120
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,688
The real thing..

121
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,845
What"s his name?

122
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,858
Rananjay Singh.
- Do you drink?

123
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,723
Yes.
- Smoke?

124
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,661
Yes, and l wander around aimlessly.

125
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,660
l get intimate with every woman l see.

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,767
lf any idiot get tough
with me, l give it to him.

127
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,830
l have a gun. The pellets
are quite dangerous.

128
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,672
He is not a good fellow,
stay away from him.

129
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,674
l"ve spoken to the warden.

130
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,712
Just keep checking the hostel list.

131
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,870
l"ve paid six month"s rent.

132
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,712
The rest of the money is with Bhanwar.

133
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,842
Take only as much as you need.

134
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,820
Okay? And buy a bicycle..

135
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,847
""Chanting Lord Hanuman"s name..""

136
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:17,752
""..helps one overcome all obstacles.""

137
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,858
""Hail Lord Hanuman.""

138
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:28,703
""Bestow me with your grace.""

139
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,542
You look old. What"s your age?

140
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,578
28.

141
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,634
How many times have you failed?

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,638
Not once. l"m a post graduate.

143
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,580
So, Uncle, have you come to teach here..

144
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,750
l"ve come to study law.

145
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,546
Law..

146
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,614
All those who can"t do anything
else come here to study law.

147
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,816
Want some?

148
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,696
No!

149
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:51,763
Want this?

150
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,665
Stop soiling your pants.

151
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,659
You!

152
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,700
Are you his brother"s rat?

153
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,712
So, why do you look so worried?

154
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,650
You know what l"ll do if you call him?

155
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,639
What?

156
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,720
Light this, l"ll tell you.

157
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,616
You see that fan here..

158
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,632
Yes.

159
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,801
How many blades does it have?

160
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,659
Three.

161
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,634
lf l hang you there instead
how many would there be?

162
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,603
Two arms, two legs.. how many?

163
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,800
Four.

164
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,804
And what about your head, you fool?

165
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,817
Go sleep.

166
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,815
You come with me.

167
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,882
Where?

168
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,319
Laaka..

169
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,810
A bite.

170
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:53,853
The taste of forbidden fruit
seems delicious on my tongue.

171
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,822
My heart goes berserk..

172
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,863
The taste of forbidden fruit
seems delicious my tongue.

173
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,832
My heart goes berserk..

174
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:16,698
One bite, l tremble and
shiver, as if l were stung.

175
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,711
My heart goes berserk..

176
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,716
One bite, l tremble and
shiver, as if l were stung.

177
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,721
My heart goes berserk..

178
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,987
The taste of forbidden fruit
seems delicious on my tongue.

179
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,754
My heart goes berserk..

180
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,804
Bana, Ransa is here.

181
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:01,742
l fear being shamed in this world..

182
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:06,758
""l fear being shamed in this world..""

183
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,763
l fear the society in this world.

184
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:17,792
Will someone blow cold
on this body in heat?

185
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:26,869
Will someone throw some
water on the fire in my heart?

186
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:33,918
He left me in sweet pain,
left me begging for more..

187
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,988
My heart goes berserk..

188
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,919
The taste of forbidden fruit
seems delicious on my tongue..

189
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,998
My heart goes berserk..

190
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,942
Blame it on the delight for
that hard and juicy bite..

191
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:04,049
lt seems like a trifle
but it"s full of danger..

192
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:11,820
Can"t blame you for your plight..

193
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,896
ln all of Rajasthan there
isn"t one as bold as you..

194
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,901
There"s trouble in these steamy folds..

195
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:26,906
There"s trouble in these steamy folds..

196
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,944
You can warm your hands
on the heat of my desire..

197
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,969
""You can warm your hands.""

198
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,084
l sigh like the sound
of an uncorked bottle..

199
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:44,089
l sigh like the sound
of an uncorked bottle..

200
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:51,052
My heart beats like a
wild horse galloping..

201
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:59,104
My limbs are weighed down by
the desires of a hundred hearts..

202
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,073
My heart goes berserk..

203
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,114
The taste of forbidden fruit
is delicious my tongue..

204
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,880
My heart goes berserk..

205
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:19,083
One bite, l tremble and
shiver, as if l were stung..

206
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,092
My heart goes berserk..

207
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:29,134
Move off!

208
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:29,463
Stop the music. Game over, get lost.

209
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,904
Game over, get lost. Everyone!

210
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,579
Hey! Where are you going? Wait.

211
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,452

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,654
What"s the power of your glasses?

240
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,735
Pardon.
- Are you deaf too, idiot?

241
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,704
You fool, what"s the power in your glasses?
- Minus two.

00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,821
Raghvinder Singh.

252
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,565
Where are you from?
- Bikaner.

253
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,762
How many buffaloes do you have at home?
- Seven.

254
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,706
Not in the stable, at home.

255
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,642
Who stretched you
this long, like a pole?

256
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,670
l know why. Someone
pulled his leg too hard.

257
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,716
Please, l"ve just come
to meet the warden.

258
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,754
Where do you think you"re going?

259
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,584
Get hold of him. Make him lie down.

Get off me. Please let me go.
- Remove all his clothes.

263
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,667
Do we look gay to you?

264
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,692
Get his wallet.

265
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,736
There"s just a hundred and fifty here.

266
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,601
You..
- Anwar, listen.

267
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,661
Please don"t do this..
- Listen. Hey, Murari.

268
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,765
Listen. Put him there,
with that lousy woman.

269
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:02,770
Naked? - What else? Pick
him up? - Take him away.

270
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,647
Listen. Open the door. Please.

271
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,661
Please..

272
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,758
Don"t look here. Please.

273
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,666
Lodge a complaint with the police.

274
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,802
Keep looking and keep me informed.

275
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,738
Wait another day.

276
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:41,741
No. No..

277
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,788
His brother already had a
heart attack when he heard.

278
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,655
l left the chick midway to come here.

279
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,817
Haven"t even slipped my protection off.

280
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,768
Open the door. Let me go, please.

281
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,701
Too much drama.
- Anybody there?

282
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,702
Lets take care of him.

283
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,699
Please..

284
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:16,720
Shout. Yell, you idiot.

285
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,861
Let go of my hand. l"ll thrash you.
- Please, let me go.

286
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,850
Shut up..

287
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,737
lf you yell again,
l"ve just stripped you..

288
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,704
l"ll sell you to these gays.

289
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,974
The lights remain on or l"ll
mess up the daylights out of you.

290
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,869
Come on.

291
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,750
lmran, listen..

292
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,850
Who could have done this?

293
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,831
We don"t know.
- What is your name?

294
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,888
Whose?
- Yours?

295
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,867
Bhanwar.

296
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,864
l got a call that a boy was found lying.

297
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,932
Then l passed the information to them
- Bittu!

298
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,909
Can you identify the
person who did this?

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,785
That girl..

300
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,611
Anu, your hair?

301
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,615
Anu, you"re smoking a cigarette?

302
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,524
What if the warden comes to know?

303
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,632
So?

304
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,605
Hello?

305
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,639
How are you my child?

306
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,600
All okay? l had called three days back..

307
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,508
We were at the initiation
of the new teachers.

308
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,706
Oh, okay. How"s Rajpur?

309
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,653
Anu, what happened?
- lt"s very cold here.

310
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,785
Anu, my child, what"s wrong?

311
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,653
Papa..
- Speak up.

312
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,625
Should l come there? Speak up.

313
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,728
l"ll call you in a bit, Papa.

314
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,534
What are you laughing at?

315
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,544
l"ll smash your teeth with this
phone if you laugh at me again.

316
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,638
Yours too!

317
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,572
This was nothing really.

318
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,687
When l was in university,
the ragging was far worse.

319
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,590
They used to hang us up side
down in the commode and flush it.

320
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,588
They called it "brain wash."

321
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,595
Anyway, forget about
it now. lt"s all right.

322
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,602
ls your brother an idiot by birth
or did he study to become one?

323
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,593
Forget it?

324
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,764
How can you let it pass just like that!

325
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,765
Jadwal..

326
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,668
Jadwal?

327
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,601
Jadwal.

328
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,773
That rogue..

329
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:42,583
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?

330
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,592
You"ll hit him with a hockey stick?

331
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,792
lt"s for you. My hand"s
more than enough. Let"s go.

332
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,702
l don"t want to go.

333
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,728
Why? Are you planning a peace march?

334
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,636
l don"t want to hit anyone.

335
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,639
"l don"t want to hit anyone."

336
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,732
Of course, you want to walk
around the campus naked.

337
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,608
Shake the hands that strip you..

338
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,807
..thank them with all your heart.

339
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,618
Your brother is an idiot like you.

340
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,877
You"re coming with me.

341
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,822
Come on, pick it up!

342
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,724
l don"t know how to hit someone.

343
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,694
Why are you hitting me?

344
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,718
lf you don"t know how
to hit, learn to get hit.

345
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,863
l"ll hit you.

346
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,831
Come on, you coward, hit back!

347
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,832
Don"t hit him. Get off him.

348
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,770
You stay put.

349
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,762
Come on, go peel the potatoes.

350
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,842
Go peel the potatoes.

351
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,769
Pen the door.

352
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,771
l"ll deal with you.

353
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,671
Open the door.

354
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,719
Open it. Open it.

355
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,653
That was solid! Come on,
pick up that hockey stick..

356
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,779
..and strap your glasses on tight.

357
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,659
Murari runs towards their room.

358
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,755
Open the door.

359
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,203
Jadwal! Jadwal!

360
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,184
Either breathe or talk,
don"t try both. What"s wrong?

361
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,320
Ransa is here.

362
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,323
So? He has a hockey stick.

363
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,221
What else does he have?

364
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,282
A motorcycle.

365
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,319
A motorcycle? And what else?

366
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:28,355
A house, a car, money and what else?

367
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,270
l have a mama.

368
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,247
Jadwal.

369
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,319
You won"t get away with this Jadwal.

370
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,353
Gag him.

371
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,363
Shove him inside!

372
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,417
Next..

373
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,452
Take this and listen, l don"t
want to see you here again.

374
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,453
Get the air filled somewhere else.

375
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:41,261
The desire for sacrifice
is in our hearts..

376
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:47,278
..let"s see what strength there is
in the arms of our executioners..

377
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,609
When the time is right,
we"ll tell the heavens..

378
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:58,353
How can we tell you now
what is in our hearts?

379
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,458
Let"s see what strength there is
in the arms of our executioners..

380
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,516
Wash up now..

381
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,363
Why? Are you taking us to a temple?

382
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,456
He"s like a God for you now.

383
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:12,360
How can we tell you now
what is in our hearts?

384
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,427
ls the water clean?

385
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,474
We"ve dug a well of
mineral water for you..

386
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,513
Oh, if you were to
come this day to lndia..

387
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:26,382
You"d see a land in
the throes of thrills.

388
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:31,387
The youth here care not
for any larger cause.

389
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:36,358
He hoists his flag only for his woman.

390
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:41,363
ln every march will be
a dumb man who sings..

391
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,527
And deaf men who march to
the sound of silent drills.

392
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,500
The age of lndian hand
spun cloth is gone..

393
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:55,376
Even our underwear is
now spun in foreign mills.

394
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,508
Let"s see what strength there
is the arms of our executioners.

395
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:04,351
When the time is right,
we"ll tell the heavens..

396
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,449
The desire for sacrifice
is in our hearts.

397
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,521
The desire for sacrifice
is in our hearts.

398
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,371
This is Prithivi Singh,
Duki Bana"s brother. Sit.

399
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,396
Hello.

400
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,498
That"s enough.

401
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,570
ls this you?

402
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,514
No, no. He is His
Highness lmagine Singh..

403
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,546
But he was a foolish
man. He spoke of love.

404
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,556
lmagine, we are all living as one.

405
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,524
No countries, boundaries, nothing.

406
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,595
He used to wear round glasses..

407
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,563
He spoke of non-violence.

408
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,564
All those who wear round
glasses are similar.

409
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,470
They all wore round glasses..

410
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,596
..that"s why their understanding
of things was also circular..

411
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,606
Your glasses are round too.

412
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,471
That"s why no one listens to me too.

413
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,635
Get inside and rehearse, no need
to start a shindig out here..

414
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,605
Hey, Duki, can you take a look at this?

415
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,640
Go inside.

416
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,475
Come on.

417
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,454
You were the one that
started a fight at Laaka.

418
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,556
Yes.

419
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:19,486
This is the boy we heard of, the
one who was found naked in a room.

420
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,502
You"re a Rajput?

421
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,558
Yes.

422
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,464
A fine Rajput you are, you
should have taught him a lesson.

423
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,535
We did go to teach him a lesson,
got messed up again instead.

424
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,637
He had a gun.

425
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,472
Scared of guns?

426
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,449
He doesn"t have the
courage to fire a gun..

427
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,579
..he just struts around holding it.

428
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,460
Grab him outside Mangli after dinner..

429
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,653
..and lay his brains out on a plate.

430
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,471
Why the hell are you here?

431
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,601
To meet my daughter.

432
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,474
She is not your daughter.

433
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,513
Karan!

434
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,649
Take this money and get out.
We don"t need your charity.

435
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,480
Come to this house when
you have the guts to..

436
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,644
..say "She is my daughter."

437
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,709
Brother!

438
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,650
Go inside. Go inside!

439
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,566
Please leave.

440
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,572
One moment.

441
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:54,717
""l am a big girl, in a big world.""

442
00:29:54,793 --> 00:30:00,663
""lt"s not big thing if you believe me..""

443
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:07,604
""What l do..""

444
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,574
""Miss you much..""

445
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:20,775
This man should never be
seen here again. Never!

446
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,651
Give me a cigarette.

447
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,562
One.

448
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,696
What"s up!? How is Duki Bana?

449
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,764
ls he holding on well?

450
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,709
Light. Care for a drag?

451
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,644
Would you like to smoke?

452
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,658
Come on, have it.

453
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,667
Let"s go.

454
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,635
Are you sure? Okay, see you.

455
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,735
They are coming..

456
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:35,816
Raise an alarm. Jadwal. Jadwal..

457
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,754
You catch a bus and reach Polo Victory.

458
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,798
l"ll see you there. Run.

459
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:44,801
Slow down. That idiot must
be hiding here somewhere.

460
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,741
There"s his bike. He"s
around somewhere. Stop.. stop!

461
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,778
Go get the rest of the guys.

462
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,889
Need to stay here all night.

463
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,663
Those rogues are looking
for us everywhere.

464
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,860
Told you not to get into this.

465
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,662
Shut up. Watch. The
heroine is going to strip.

466
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:25,698
l love you.

467
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,680
l really mean it.
- You always stay at a distance from me.

468
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,850
How did you get close to me?
- You own the mills now.

469
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,750
l"ll always be with you.
- How?

470
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,820
Are you coming out
or should we drag you?

471
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,859
Duki Bana is calling you.

472
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,828
Come on.

473
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:57,830
Wait here.

474
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,750
You wait here. l"ll just talk to Bana.

475
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:09,842
Bana.

476
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,247
What the hell is happening?

477
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,360
Bana, he broke Jadwal"s head..

478
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,486
Why?

479
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,252
Bana..

480
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,432
What?

481
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,356
Jadwal had them..

482
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,370
Hung them upside down in the bathroom.

483
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,472
Yes.

484
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,496
Brainwashed them.

485
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,262
Yes, sir.

486
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,276
End all this.

487
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:38,246
if l get into this, l"ll thrash
Jadwal and hang him right there.

488
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,507
Did you get it?

489
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,446
Like Najibullah was hung in
Kabul. You weren"t even born then.

490
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,391
Yes, sir.

491
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,292
What? Do you even remember
where you came from?

492
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,353
Leave all this.

493
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,261
Okay.
- Come on.

494
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,459
Bhati, get them to my place.

495
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:05,510
l want you to stand in the election
for the post of General Secretary.

496
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,311
Me? No, no. Elections
aren"t my cup of tea.

497
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,384
You"ll represent the Rajputana party.

498
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,418
How will that help?

499
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,410
We"ll form a union..

500
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,357
And then?

501
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,382
And then we can do as we feel like.

502
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,493
What do we feel like doing?

503
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,286
You ask too many
questions, just do as l say.

504
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,392
You don"t drink. And don"t trust us..

505
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,416
Bittu. Bittu, someone"s here.

506
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,574
Let me sleep.

507
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,511
Someone"s come right into the house.

508
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,351
So, go tell Ransa.

509
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:00,565
Who are you? How did you come here?

510
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,589
l stay here.

511
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,526
This is the King"s property.

512
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,436
l pay the rent. Me and Ransa.

513
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,596
Ransa.. Rananjay?

514
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,437
You"re His Highness" son?

515
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,378
His Highness of nonsense..

516
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,442
The world has gone places..

517
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,351
There"s no democracy
left to speak of here..

518
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,548
..and he"s seeing
visions of aristocracy.

519
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,456
There"s no difference
between him and Duki Bana.

520
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,485
Not an ounce. He"s turned
his palace into a resort.

521
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,489
Serves tea to fair women and
expects me to do the same.

522
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,459
Listen.

523
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,498
So, you came to see my face..

524
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,469
lf you"re done, can l leave?
l"m fed up of sitting here.

525
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,478
l might die any day now.

526
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,450
So, you want me to stop living?

527
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,508
Ransa! You shut up.

528
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,521
This property, what will become of it..

529
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,489
Give it to the government,
they"ll turn it into a museum.

530
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:05,426
l"m notjoking. l"m here in
Rajpur only because of you.

531
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,489
The day all this becomes
mine, l"ll sell it and move on.

532
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,593
l don"t want to live in a history book.

533
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,594
Don"t worry about me.

534
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,535
When you die, l"ll be
there to light your pyre.

535
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,509
l"m going. Let"s go Dileep. Let"s go.

536
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,514
Come on.

537
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,551
Why don"t you kiss his feet too?

538
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,581
You aren"t allowed to smoke here..

539
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,576
..but you smoke. Nobody will object.

540
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,523
After what happened to you..

541
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,625
lt happened to me. Why are you worried?

542
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,559
l can understand.

543
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,663
Anuja.

544
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,668
What does Duki Bana want to
do with this party of his?

545
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,579
No idea.

546
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,714
lf he wants to contest the election..

547
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,681
..why doesn"t he do
it on a larger scale?

548
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,617
What will he get by winning
the college elections?

549
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,609
Youth! Youth changes society.

550
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,585
But what fancy change does
he want to bring about?

551
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,624
What problems are we facing that
other nations aren"t facing too?

552
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,492
Look, if you want to stand
for the elections, do it.

553
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,598
lf you don"t, don"t. But
don"t ask any questions.

554
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,692
Why do questions make you weak?

555
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,499
Because you have no answer, that"s why.

556
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,596
Don"t worry, my friend.
l"ll fight those elections..

557
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,640
..not for myself, not for any of you..

558
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,506
..but for the welfare
of our society. Got it?

559
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,646
l"ll bless this college
with electricity and water.

560
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,509
l"ll work exactly how
all our politicians work.

561
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,710
With perfect honesty..

562
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,645
..and l promise to never ever
stare at my neighbour"s wife.

563
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,780
Oh, wow!

564
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,617
Hi, Dileep.

565
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,672
Sanjeev.

566
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,678
Jadwal did some good after all.

567
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,646
For a second, l didn"t recognise you..

568
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,639
You shouldn"t have come here.

569
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,683
Why?

570
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,585
What if the hostel boys see you?

571
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,745
What"s left of me to see?

572
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,784
You stay here?

573
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,703
What is this?

574
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:41,608
A bad habit. Opium,
weed, grass, a bad habit..

575
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:48,608
..can you pass me the ashtray?

576
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,761
Some music?

577
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,701
lts begun, it"s a flood a
thousand heads smell blood.

578
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,670
lt"s time for the battle cry.

579
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:53,672
For the glory and the pride,
give limb or life or step aside.

580
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,810
lt"s time to let arrows fly.

581
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,780
He that would die if
needed, and kill unheeded..

582
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,725
..is the most powerful..

583
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,865
lt"s begun, it"s a flood a
thousand heads smell blood.

584
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,800
lt"s time for the battle cry..

585
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,704
""For the glory and the pride
give limb or life or step aside.

586
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,900
lt"s time to let arrows fly.""

587
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,903
""Well begun is half the battle won.""

588
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,731
""The one who kills or gets killed..""

589
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,858
""..is the most powerful.""

590
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,737
""The one who kills or gets killed..""

591
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,741
""..is the most powerful.""

592
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,880
ln the word of the Lord, in
the holy scripture of God..

593
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,849
War separates the strong from the weak.

594
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,987
Whether it"s the Kaurava
masses, or the five Pandavas..

595
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,956
He who can fight is truly great.

596
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,951
There"s a good chance
this girl will win.

597
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:11,852
She"s student of law.

598
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,998
The results of the law
exams aren"t out yet, right?

599
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,022
No.

600
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,028
So, what are you thinking? Cut her off.

601
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:20,963
lt won"t end in just a win..

602
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,007
..there"s no restraint without within..

603
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,976
lt matters not if this
battle ends in death.

604
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,903
lf death is not the real end,
to fear death we don"t pretend.

605
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,950
And this, we roar at the sky.
Kiran"s answer-sheet has disappeared.

606
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,974
Without a minimum score of 60%..

607
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,876
..she won"t be eligible
to stand for the election.

608
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,786
""lts begun, it"s a flood a
thousand heads smell blood.

609
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,925
lt"s time for the battle cry.""

610
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:45,794
""For the glory and the pride,

611
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,990
""lt"s time to let arrows fly.""

612
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,993
""Well begun is half the battle won.""

613
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,020
Hello.. Dad?

614
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,081
Yes, l am fighting the elections.

615
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,827
Why don"t you tell Ransa
to withdraw? Why always us?

616
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:25,858
Hello, tell me, talk to me.

617
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,873
Will you declare us as
your legitimate heirs?

618
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,110
What did he say?

619
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,979
Your father had no answer.

620
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,048
Your answer-sheet has vanished.

621
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,852
Vanished?

622
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,961
Brought a new one. Fill it up.

623
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:00,867
You broke your guitar string, right?

624
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,066
Replace it..

625
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,005
Where"s Duki Bana?

626
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,118
Why?

627
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,142
Give the answer.

628
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,121
Sit here.

629
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,088
Let go.

630
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,924
What"s the problem, tell
me, but stop shouting first.

631
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,015
Who does he think he is?

632
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,031
How dare he take money from
His Highness in my name?

633
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,896
The thing is, the thing is..

634
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,070
..whatever expectations this
country had from anyone..

635
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,138
l"ve already heard that one.

636
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,107
Whatever expectations this
country had from anyone..

637
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,143
l told you l"ve heard
it fifty times already.

638
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,010
You"ve heard it but haven"t
understood it. So, understand it.

639
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:46,050
Whatever expectations this
country had from anyone..

640
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,153
He flushed those
expectations down the toilet.

641
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,120
Please go inside.

642
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,120
l am going. l am going.

643
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,924
l have never taken
five cents my father..

644
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:55,959
How dare you"ll..

645
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,061
We don"t know who your father is.

646
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,996
You know everything.

647
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,999
He was the great pretender.

648
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,058
Thought he was the king of the city.

649
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,193
Shut up. - You act
too smart! - Move off.

650
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,609
Hello.
- Hello.

651
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,645
Come on in. ls Bana inside?

652
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,530
Hey.

653
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:36,621
Very smart.

654
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:40,492
Bana.

655
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,508
What do you think of yourself?

656
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,605
Who the hell do you think you are?

657
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,607
You went to His Highness.

658
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,607
Where is the money?

659
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,675
With me. Why?

660
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,485
How dare you take it?
You knew who l was?

661
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,546
l didn"t know a thing. This is crazy.

662
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,685
We didn"t take your money.

663
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:08,622
His Highness came to meet me.

664
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,600
He heard you were
contesting the elections.

665
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,659
He"s a true blooded Rajput.

666
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,701
He said, ""See to it that
my son does not lose.""

667
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,617
l said, ""okay."" He dumped
the money in my hand and left.

668
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,709
l want all the money back.

669
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,710
Bhati.

670
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,633
Think it over.

671
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,594
Why the hell are you touching it?

672
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,561
Do you want to eat me?

673
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,599
Keep your fangs and claws to yourself.

674
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,676
Don"t yell..

675
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,712
One slap and l"ll break all your teeth.

676
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,579
Get out, get out, this is
my parlour, get out. Shut up.

677
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,617
l"ll throw you out, you
understand. Don"t shout at me.

678
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,586
You.. you"d gone to
get water. Where is it?

679
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,713
Don"t talk to me like that.

680
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,594
My love, please get me water.

681
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:22,739
What happened? Where"s the water?

682
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,629
Go get the water yourself.

683
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:26,743
What"s wrong now?

684
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,680
My show is playing on the video..

685
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,648
Outside. l"ll go once it"s over.

686
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,716
l"ll throw your cassette in the gutter.

687
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,650
The heroine leaves only
once the show is over.

688
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,757
Have you told him l"ve
acted in a TV show?

689
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,632
l was the heroine. My show never aired.

690
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,769
The channel shut shop,
l had to come back here.

691
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,742
Did you know that he hits me?

692
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,835
He does the right thing.

693
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:06,715
Get five lakh from the
lot and give it to him.

694
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,809
Tell him that"s all the king gave us.

695
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,689
And get me to speak to His Highness.

696
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,783
What"s your phone number?
Give me your number?

697
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,682
Take my address instead.

698
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,626
Not now, later. Go back there now.

699
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:22,665
Move your hand. Go.

700
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,693
Go home now. Bhati"s on his
way there with the money.

701
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,773
And don"t drive me nuts like this again.

702
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,706
Why did you have to go
screaming to my house?

703
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,738
You"re a royal too. l have
an image to live up to.

704
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:43,752
""l pine for you, l wait for you.""

705
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,653
Forget it. You weren"t
thinking of withdrawing from..

706
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:47,824
..the elections in anger l hope.

707
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:48,813
No.

708
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,659
Sure?
- ""Your anger mesmerizes me.""

709
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,754
""l"m bowled over by you.""

710
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:59,870
""l am in love with you.""

711
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,770
He"s a good lad..
- Shut up!

712
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:04,696
You cuddle him again..

713
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:07,674
..l"ll get the whole of Rajpur to
watch you dance naked in the streets.

714
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:14,740
Don"t ever come back again.
lf you do, then l"ll go away.

715
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:30,722
What"s for dinner?

716
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:31,823
Bittu, you are not
doing the right thing.

717
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,802
That girl comes here and dopes..

718
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:34,859
What if your father finds out?

719
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,773
Don"t stir things up.

720
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:45,746
Hello? You were supposed
to come by my place.

721
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:48,851
Okay. l see. Now, l"m coming.

722
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:52,879
You want to come with
me to Duki Bana"s place?

723
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,719
l need to pick up the money.

724
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,910
Get in. Come on.
- Who are you?

725
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,845
Get in.
- Lock the door.

726
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:25,981
What were you doing just
standing there, you idiot?!

727
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:27,915
Bana, l couldn"t figure
out what was happening.

728
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,788
The bike was stuck between my legs..

729
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,829
l couldn"t see anything
when Ransa went there.

730
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:33,985
Should l call the police?

731
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,859
Give me some water.
- Here.

732
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:51,903
Where"s Ransa?

733
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,814
l don"t know Bana.

734
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,007
Where"s Jadwal?

735
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,911
l haven"t seen him for four days now..

736
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:04,885
Murari, who"s kidnapped Ransa?

737
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,928
l don"t know Bana..

738
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,494
lt"s not your fault.

739
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,431
Why do l feel so scared?

740
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,303
l can"t do anything
when Ransa"s not with me.

741
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,419
Bana, l have no idea
who kidnapped Ransa.

742
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,532
l haven"t, neither have my boys.

743
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,335
lf something"s troubling
you then please tell me.

744
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,339
Murari"s lost two fingers.
l"ve suffered a lot.

745
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,600
We can never get upset with you.

746
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,536
But l must say that it"s not
right that any of your men can..

747
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:58,546
..just walk up to one of ours
and beat him up. lt"s not right.

748
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:03,442
l had gone to the village
when this happened.

749
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,554
With the elections around the corner?

750
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:06,446
My grandfather passed away.

751
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,456
There is no point in kidnapping Ransa.

752
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,361
The real high would be in beating
him in the elections by 5000 votes..

753
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,454
..and then l"ll shave his head
and parade him on a donkey.

754
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,363
You idiot.
- Shut up, you fool.

755
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,504
Let him go.

756
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,512
Rananjay..

757
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:45,588
Another five years and it"ll
be His Highness Rananjay.

758
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,402
Don"t you want to take
your father"s place?

759
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,499
ls your father alive or dead?

760
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:09,418
ldiot, if only you"d use
your hands on the form..

761
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:12,614
..instead of your mouth,
you"d be better off.

762
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,549
Withdraw from the elections.

763
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,460
ls your father alive or dead?

764
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,567
Otherwise, you"ll
never leave this place.

765
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,628
ls it true that he never
married your mother?

766
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,539
You and your sister are
both illegitimate, right?

767
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:33,700
l"m asking you one last time.

768
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,637
Are you going to withdraw or not?

769
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,539
lf your father had withdrawn in time..

770
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,711
..you wouldn"t have been illegitimate.

771
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,681
Let me tell you the story of a time..

772
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,586
When the city was
sleeping one deadly night..

773
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:31,691
Let me tell you the story of a time..

774
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:36,505
When the city was
sleeping one deadly night..

775
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:41,508
Shadows creep in over this
land from all four sides..

776
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,682
Creatures of night wed in
blood, dance with their brides..

777
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:49,709
""Shadows creep in over this
land from all four sides..""

778
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:54,552
Creatures of night wed in
blood, dance with their brides..

779
00:54:54,658 --> 00:55:00,722
Crimson smeared on every face.

780
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:07,604
A great danger at every place..

781
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:13,736
That night the skies let
loose a shower of blood..

782
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,717
That night the city was
lashed by a crimson flood..

783
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:24,744
That night the skies let
loose a shower of blood..

784
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:30,759
That night the city was
lashed by a crimson flood..

785
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:36,562
The city and the earth were
soaked as if they"d been cursed..

786
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:40,660
A horde of men just lay
there till they burst..

787
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,808
The world inquires why
when this curse came by..

788
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:49,575
..was our city lying in bed,
eyes closed and sleeping.

789
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:55,752
My sleep was deep, the
city said, it knew not why..

790
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,779
The night a rain of blood
fell thundering from the sky..

791
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,690
That night the city was
lashed by a crimson flood..

792
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:10,791
That night the city was
lashed by a crimson flood..

793
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:25,738
Deathly quiet..

794
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:36,749
Silent, alien..

795
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:46,761
Life..

796
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:57,670
Squirms in a violent bed..

797
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,743
Shadows collect, thick and tight..

798
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:08,654
..like ruffled black tangled hair..

799
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:12,752
Darkness creep up like unsure ghosts..

800
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:17,663
Wrapping shakily around bedposts..

801
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:21,761
There"s soft crunching
of a footstep prying..

802
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,803
There"s the faint crackle
of a bonfire dying..

803
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:34,873
There"s the soft howls
of the beasts of night..

804
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:42,884
There"s the faint drip of a tap..

805
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:49,892
There"s a window black and stark..

806
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,958
There"s a chimney dead and dark..

807
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,832
There"s a tree that"s
bent like a frown..

808
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,946
Something weighs its branches down.

809
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:06,814
You are not allowed to go
there.. - What? - You can"t.

810
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:15,858
He was my father too..

811
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:24,833
At the mouth of the desolate
street, a lone dog howls and weeps.

812
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:33,774
ln the pale dirty yellow light
of the lamppost something creeps..

813
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:42,012
Tip toeing through the dark, into
other shadows, a shadow seeps.

814
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:50,885
When a car"s hot light brush the
legs of a bridge with two sweeps.

815
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:55,899
lt"s then that this city sleeps.

816
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,960
lt"s then that this city sleeps.

817
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:08,807
lt"s then that this city sleeps.

818
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:18,878
When this city goes to sleep,
do you know what it takes?

819
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:27,795
The living turns to ash and
dust, the dead slowly awake..

820
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:36,839
A mother lets out her last
anguished scream on a hospital bed..

821
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:44,847
The next instant she"s holding a
small new mass of flesh instead..

822
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:53,852
Here"s a wrangling over the
price of flesh for the night..

823
00:59:53,957 --> 01:00:01,921
Here"s two tearless eyes watching
a wound disappear from sight..

824
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:09,097
ln the garish hotel down the
road there"s a silent compromise..

825
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:18,982
From a dead-drunken
stupor a joke rises.

826
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:26,980
Half naked bodies are caked
in colour, put on display.

827
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:35,054
Red-smeared faces like
devils, come out to play.

828
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:39,123
And all of this, they ask
surprised, happens when?

829
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:47,001
lt all happens, we"ll tell
them, right then. Then..

830
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:52,005
..when the city sleeps.

831
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:56,142
When the city sleeps..

832
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:03,347
When the city sleeps..

833
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,930
Sign this.

834
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,093
What is this?
- Sign.

835
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,572
Where?

836
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:17,561
Here. Here.

837
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,441
The man because of whom you are here..

838
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:25,572
..dreamt of a Rajput Rajasthan.

839
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:33,444
lf that girl becomes the General
Secretary, it won"t be good.

840
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:43,462
They have killed Ransa but
they cannot kill his soul.

841
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,557
His friend, the person closest to him..

842
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,438
Dileep Singh will continue
from where Ransa left us..

843
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,598
..and fulfil promises he had made..

844
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:55,568
Dileep Singh. - Live long.
- Dileep Singh. - Live long!

845
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:56,669
Are you alone at that time?

846
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:58,502
Everybody is there.

847
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,515
Every candidate has his
own person present there..

848
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,446
We have to show them
that we are putting..

849
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,576
..the right vote in the right basket.

850
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,612
When the baskets are full, we take
them inside to count the votes.

851
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,550
Packs of 50 votes each
are then made and counted.

852
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,550
Ransa was my friend.

853
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,464
l"ll do everything he promised to do.

854
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,603
l don"t understand all this too well.

855
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:26,697
l..

856
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:29,704
Dileep Singh!
- Live long!

857
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,639
Dileep Singh!
- Live long!

858
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,545
Dileep Singh!
- Live long!

859
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,550
Dileep Singh!
- Live long!

860
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,675
Dileep Singh!
- Live long!

861
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,721
Make packs of 40 for Dileep Singh.

862
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,616
But count them as 50. Make
packs of 60 for the girl..

863
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:44,652
..and continue making
these packs of 60 and 40.

864
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,530
So, when you touch 500..
how many will the girl have?

865
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,632
600 and Dileep will have 400.

866
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,565
All packs are counted.

867
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,670
lf there is a discrepancy
in the final counting..

868
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,659
..we"ll all get into trouble.

869
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,597
Only the packs are counted
in the final counting.

870
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,506
And if the girl appeals for a recount..

871
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,512
..then according to
election rules only..

872
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,639
..the number of packs will be counted..

873
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,608
..the packs cannot be opened.

874
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,677
We"ll give them as
much money as they want.

875
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:13,747
But Dileep Singh has to win.

876
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,687
The poet who imagines that
life is love and peace..

877
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,698
Deny that poet"s song..

878
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:28,638
These muscles stirred,
these veins swollen..

879
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:32,540
Stoke them in fire. lt"s begun, it"s a flood..
- Dileep Singh!

880
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:38,638
A thousand heads smelling blood,
it"s time for the battle cry..

881
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,709
For the glory and the pride,
give limb, life, step aside..

882
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:45,754
lts time to let arrows fly..

883
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,626
""Well begun is half the battle won.""

884
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,720
""Well begun is half the battle won.""

885
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,698
""Well begun is half the battle won.""

886
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,583
Looks like all the flies of..

887
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:22,590
..Rajasthan have come
to Duki Bana"s party.

888
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:34,633
You stay here.

889
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,806
Greetings.

890
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,846
l"ve come to congratulate you.

891
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,758
Your win is a victory for all Rajputs.

892
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:01,824
lt maybe small but it"s still a win.

893
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:03,823
Will you drink something?

894
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:10,669
l"ll help myself. l"m
sorry l popped up uninvited.

895
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,333
That seems like a birth defect.

896
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,236
Give him a drink.

897
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,342
One ""Republic"" Please..
- Yes.

898
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,347
Water.
- Yes, sir.

899
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,258
You understand politics?
- Yes.

900
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,359
Do you even know what
it means? Politics?

901
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:41,260
Politics..

902
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:04,220
Dileep! l"m Kiran.

903
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,384
l know.

904
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,386
l couldn"t defeat you.

905
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,196
You know there"s so much l want..

906
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,391
..to do for this boring
university of ours.

907
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,298
l"m bursting with ideas.

908
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,337
Yes.

909
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:22,471
l can leave my party and join
you. Take me in your cabinet.

910
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,474
l"m calling it the cabinet
as if we"re in the Parliament.

911
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,411
l could be the cultural secretary.

912
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,314
l"ll check.

913
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,431
The warden wants to see you.

914
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,347
Listen, Please open this.

915
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,341
lt"s already open.

916
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:24,462
Hey, get lost. Out!

917
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,404
Where did it go? l left it right here..

918
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,510
Once second. What are you looking for?

919
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,410
What one second? l don"t know. l"d left it right here..
- What?

920
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,275
l"d left it here, l can"t find it.

921
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,373
One second. Quiet, calm down.

922
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,541
What are you looking for?

923
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:38,521
What are you looking for?
- What is it?

924
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:43,288
Father had given it
to you. l"d stolen it.

925
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,430
Long time back. You
always tried to steal it.

926
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,532
l don"t understand. lt"s
like this. You cut it first.

927
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,295
..and then take it. lt"s
part of something big.

928
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,495
You cut it first and then take
it. You put it on the face.

929
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,340
Okay, you look there, l"ll search here.

930
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,542
lf we don"t find it,
then you leave, okay?

931
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,339
l"ll have to leave?
- Yes, come on.

932
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,412
l"ll leave only once l find
it. Look carefully. You too.

933
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,449
Okay, search there.
- You too join me.

934
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,452
l am telling you. lt can only be here.

935
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,387
ln your room and nowhere else.

936
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,455
lt can only be here.

937
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:13,489
What does he want?

938
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,515
l don"t know.
- lt has to be somewhere around.

939
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,462
Have you found it?
- No, don"t ask me repeatedly.

940
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,398
l wouldn"t have been searching had l found it.
- Yes.

941
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:23,466
Come in. Listen to me.

942
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,331
Get lost. Out.
- l"ll kill you!

943
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,404
You"ve kicked him out. At
least he would"ve helped.

944
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,462
Here it is. Here it is.

945
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:30,596
This is the garbage bin.

946
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,576
Don"t go there. - l
know it"s a dust-bin.

947
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,600
That"s garbage. -
lt"s here. - Please..

948
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,412
lt"s right in front of your eyes..

949
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,480
You"ve found it, right?
Take it and leave.

950
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,469
Yes, l found it. Take a look.

951
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,358
Don"t ever repeat this again.

952
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,624
Bana, please come.

953
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:04,473
Kings have been relegated to stories.

954
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,569
A revolution in this life..

955
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,572
lndependence in the next..

956
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,512
lt"s said to be the prime reason.

957
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:20,377
The part responsible to beat Congress..
- Grandpa..

958
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,481
Bana.
- They were responsible for it.

959
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:26,392
And a lot of them will
contest the elections.

960
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:27,587
This has been finalised.

961
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,518
You are not important to Duki.

962
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,615
He just wanted to win
the elections and he did.

963
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,619
l know. He also used Ransa"s name.

964
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,524
Two flatbreads and a plate of pilaf.

965
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:02,598
That day, at the party
it seemed like he..

966
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,463
..and not me, won the elections.

967
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,484
Bittu.
- Yes.

968
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,453
Anuja ma"am is here..

969
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,491
So, let her sit.

970
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:30,581
She brought her luggage with her.

971
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:36,599
l didn"t go back to
the hostel all night.

972
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:37,588
They"ve asked me to leave.

973
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,592
You didn"t go back to the hostel.

974
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:42,728
Why?

975
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:45,574
Can l stay here?

976
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,709
Of course, you can.

977
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,677
ln this room?
- Yes, but Anu..

978
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,478
l"ll carry it.

979
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:53,604
How do you know her?

980
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,513
l don"t understand her.

981
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,509
She loves you.

982
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,612
No.

983
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:03,726
Sure?

984
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:04,693
Yes, the other day, l..

985
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:06,752
What l..

986
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:13,624
l don"t want to know about it.

987
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:14,968
Okay, ask her to meet me.

988
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,630
Okay.

989
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,512
But Bana that girl is with Jadwal.

990
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,613
She is ready to leave
Jadwal"s group for us.

991
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:31,541
What"s the problem?

992
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,518
A lot of guys can"t come within
sniffing distance of the..

993
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,648
..kind of money a girl
can attract for a festival.

994
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,561
l"ll keep it there.

995
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,527
Get more people to join us.

996
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:42,698
There won"t be any problem.

997
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,666
What do l do with this, Bana?
- Keep it inside..

998
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,735
l"ll handle it.

999
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,771
You can come and start working
as the cultural secretary.

1000
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,568
Okay? All the best.

1001
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,573
Thank you.
- Mention not.

1002
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:54,800
Thanks!

1003
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,740
ls this your shirt?
- No, it"s Ransa"s.

1004
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:06,812
What if l get pregnant?

1005
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:08,590
We"ll get married.

1006
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:09,691
Be serious, Dileep.

1007
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:10,759
Seriously, we"ll marry.

1008
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:16,698
What"s wrong?

1009
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,689
l don"t want to get married, Dileep.

1010
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,768
We are not going to get married now.

1011
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:21,591
l don"t want to marry, ever.

1012
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,662
..and l don"t want to get pregnant.

1013
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,666
What"s this?

1014
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:29,611
What?

1015
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:30,838
This.

1016
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,608
Nothing..

1017
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:42,622
""Hail Lord Shiva.""

1018
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:45,728
""Hail Lord Shiva.""

1019
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:47,628
""Hail Lord Shiva.""

1020
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,599
lt"s been two days
since we left this room.

1021
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:52,735
So?

1022
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,724
Adarsh must be looking for me.

1023
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,701
Sometimes, you say you
don"t want to go to office.

1024
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,705
They are using Ransa"s
name and now this..

1025
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,798
The work"s got to get done, right?

1026
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:01,744
Even my brother was the
General Secretary of the union.

1027
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,712
No one works there, they
just make some quick bucks.

1028
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:04,870
Money?

1029
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:10,641
ln the festival, that"s where
they play the real politics.

1030
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:13,712
l won"t get pregnant, right?

1031
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,391
You"re nuts.

1032
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,380
As if you know all about it.

1033
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,425
Shut up, Kiran.

1034
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,427
What Shut up? You realise
we didn"t use anything.

1035
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:20,462
Okay.

1036
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,553
Sir.
- Yes?

1037
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,422
Some Bhati sir at the door.

1038
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:25,355
Ask him to sit, l"m coming out.

1039
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,538
Yes, Bhati, tell me.

1040
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:44,709
Need to talk to you.

1041
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,522
Say.

1042
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,623
Bana had said something to you.

1043
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:48,690
l remember.

1044
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,590
He wants to meet you.
- He didn"t come with you.

1045
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:54,653
He"s called you to the den.

1046
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,560
l"ll be there this evening.
- Now.

1047
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:57,656
l told you l"ll be there this evening.

1048
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,668
Bring her along.

1049
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,528
Why? ls he my
father-in-law?

1050
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:08,667
What do you know about her?

1051
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,570
Bana, she is sincere.

1052
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:13,740
ls she the only sincere
one in this world?

1053
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,651
He recommended Kiran, so, l..

1054
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:19,553
Shut up. He popped the
name, you seconded it.

1055
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,623
Did she come to see you too?

1056
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:25,515
Did she lie beside you?

1057
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,520
He"s a fool, and you"re a bigger one.

1058
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,494
Why do you abuse in front of the kid?

1059
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:35,697
You go inside. lf it"s troubling
you why don"t you go inside?

1060
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:44,603
Remember this.

1061
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,513
What happens at the
university, what doesn"t..

1062
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:49,708
l decide..

1063
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,713
Who will decide? Who will decide?

1064
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:56,558
Bana, you.

1065
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,616
Who will decide?

1066
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,527
Why don"t you become the
General Secretary then?

1067
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,667
Bana..

1068
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,806
Bana, leave Dileep to me, you
have too much on your hands.

1069
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:18,668
And that girl?

1070
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:20,582
You have to meet her once.

1071
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:21,749
You don"t have to appoint her.

1072
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,588
Do you even know what
kind of a man Duki Bana is?

1073
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,725
He"s the kind who"ll have an..

1074
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,556
..illicit relationship
even with his own wife.

1075
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:32,682
Meaning?

1076
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,761
Whatever. l don"t want
to meet him and that"s it.

1077
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,654
Kiran, he"ll be upset.

1078
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,756
So? You"re scared of him?

1079
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,760
He said he wants to meet you.

1080
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,665
lf he says it himself, go
slit your throat, would you?

1081
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,163
Please, Kiran, for my sake.

1082
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:48,209
What do you mean your sake?

1083
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,311
l took a stand for you, Kiran.

1084
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,142
l proposed your name.

1085
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,247
You said there was so
much you wanted to do.

1086
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:56,183
l still do. But meeting "your
man" was not on my agenda..

1087
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,274
..not even for your sake.

1088
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,213
And l"m so sorry you had
to take a stand for me.

1089
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,284
l"ll resign tomorrow. And thank
you so much for everything.

1090
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,125
Kiran. Kiran.

1091
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,189
Am l a coward?

1092
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,237
Yes.

1093
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,234
lt"s not a bad thing to be a coward.

1094
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,203
He looks pretty ripe.

1095
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,378
When l saw him, l felt
like kissing him too.

1096
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,153
Shut up.

1097
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:37,387
l"m not lying. l"ve seen
what she has been touching..

1098
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,253
Ok, enough now. She is my sister.

1099
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,126
When did l say she"s a call-girl?

1100
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,424
Where is Bhati?
- lnside.

1101
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,296
Bhati.

1102
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,267
Bana.

1103
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,279
Welcome, Dileep.

1104
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,323
What"s the matter,
your glasses are gone.

1105
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,349
l"m using contact lenses.

1106
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,320
Looking handsome.

1107
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,330
Did you make the switch yourself
or did ma"am have a hand in it?

1108
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,335
You called?

1109
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:59,272
l called in the morning.
l called the girl too.

1110
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:04,211
l"m not that hard core
either. l"m not Hitler.

1111
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,281
You could have told me. Since
when have you been in it..

1112
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,383
ln what?

1113
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,474
ln love.

1114
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,252
Three days.

1115
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,253
Three days.72 hours.

1116
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,414
Oh, my God. When"s the wedding?

1117
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,254
l haven"t thought about that.

1118
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,286
When will the honeymoon get over?

1119
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,298
What?

1120
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,392
lf your honeymoon"s over,
can we get some work done?

1121
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,233
The general secretary"s office doors..

1122
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,362
..have been shut for three days now.

1123
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:32,262
There"s no work happening.

1124
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:33,498
The festival"s around the corner.

1125
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,272
We"ll need sponsorships.

1126
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,405
Who"ll get the sponsorships, your dad?

1127
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,249
Rattle your bed as much as you want..

1128
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,344
..but once the festival"s
over, understood?

1129
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,518
Stop this childishness now or
l"ll bury you in this very cave.

1130
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,351
Even your dad won"t be
able to dig out of this one.

1131
01:18:56,331 --> 01:19:00,290
What are you staring
at? You think l"m joking?

1132
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,293
You think they are fools?

1133
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,270
These guys have been
looking for you all day.

1134
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,298
You think they have no other work?

1135
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:13,278
You can make your
wife your cultural or..

1136
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:17,444
..personal secretary for
all l care. l want work.

1137
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,480
You"re not going to get
convinced this way. See this.

1138
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,336
Come back from your honeymoon.

1139
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,450
Why do you instigate him?

1140
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:03,353
He doesn"tjoke around.

1141
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,364
He doesn"t care whether
it"s you or Jadwal.

1142
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:12,340
Look, buried him along with his gun.

1143
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:20,413
Don"t tell anyone. Not even
to your girl, understood?

1144
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,348
Nothing will happen to him.

1145
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,443
He"s the leader of the Rajputs.

1146
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:31,390
But yes, someone might build
a Taj Mahal over your grave.

1147
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,546
Don"t worry. You have
no reason to fear him.

1148
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,448
l"m not afraid. l"m just
wondering what to do next.

1149
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,506
Nothing, just your work.

1150
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,419
The next time anyone says
anything, give it back to him.

1151
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:00,555
You"re the general
secretary of this university.

1152
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,422
Notjust anyone. The entire
university is with you.

1153
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,390
lf anyone so much as touches
you, l"ll let the truth out.

1154
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,523
The annual festival"s
at the end of the year.

1155
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:14,526
l"ll get the sponsorships.
You give the money to Adarsh.

1156
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:17,400
General Secretary means that you have..

1157
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,598
..the entire university in
your control for three years.

1158
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,465
That"s what they want from you.

1159
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,567
Who were the other guys who
locked you naked in that room?

1160
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:26,436
Wasn"t Jadwal one of them?

1161
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:36,454
There were seven. Kishen
Murari Sanjeev Kumar, Altaaf..

1162
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:42,429
Ashraf, Vijay Gupta, Ashish..

1163
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:44,599
And Jadwal.

1164
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,537
Have some paan (betel leaf).
- Sir, what happened?

1165
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,607
Nothing. Get up. Get
up and eat some paan.

1166
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:53,631
Sir, l don"t have paan..

1167
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,467
You don"t? Don"t worry you
don"t have to pay for it.

1168
01:21:56,611 --> 01:22:00,570
Come on. Come on, have paan.

1169
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:05,642
Have it.
- Can l have some catechu (choona), sir?

1170
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,046
You don"t look like you"re
from Rajpur. Where are you from?

1171
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,148
Madhya Pradesh.

1172
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,959
The whole lot of you
is from Madhya Pradesh.

1173
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:13,995
Where are you from?

1174
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,963
Gwalior.
- Where"s Jadwal?

1175
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,099
l don"t know where.

1176
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,163
No one"s seen him for a week.

1177
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:31,001
No one knows where Jadwal
is. - Do you know? - Hit him!

1178
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,172
Ask the person who mentioned him.

1179
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,984
Hello, lnspector, what can l do for you?

1180
01:22:41,222 --> 01:22:43,053
Just came to see you. l"ve
brought some offerings..

1181
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,184
..from Baba"s temple. Take this please.
- Okay.

1182
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:47,989
Please sit.

1183
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,134
This.. Just some routine inspection.

1184
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:59,200
Do you remember that boy called Jadwal?

1185
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,030
Yes.

1186
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,078
Where is he?

1187
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:04,067
l don"t know.

1188
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,149
You own some property in Chandpur.

1189
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:14,212
Actually the thing is that..
you know you"re a Bana..

1190
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:22,053
..but we have to follow
orders, have to investigate.

1191
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,120
Who told you this?

1192
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,101
No one.
- Dileep Singh.

1193
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,296
No, no. He"s just a kid.

1194
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,039
He"s a kid, right?

1195
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,075
Which idiot decided to
nominate him for the elections?

1196
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,099
Whose idea was it

1197
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,178
Bana, mine.

1198
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,173
Then take him to Jadwal.
- He"s alive.

1199
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,307
Come.

1200
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,142
Where are you taking me?

1201
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,123
Relax. We are not going
to do anything to you.

1202
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,179
No.
- Come. Come.

1203
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,319
l"ve brought the entire force.

1204
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,271
They"ve left.

1205
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:06,330
What?

1206
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,277
Come on, go downstairs. Go.

1207
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,073
There"s been some confusion.

1208
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,172
There"s no confusion.
- Can"t the police just come to meet Duki Bana?

1209
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:17,185
Come on, go downstairs!

1210
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,278
Thank you. l"ll take your leave now.

1211
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:27,124
Come on.
- l"ll become corrupt.

1212
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:28,162
Shoot! What are you doing?

1213
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:29,264
So corrupt that Bana
will make me his watchman.

1214
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,095
Bhati pointing the gun.
- You do it!

1215
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,292
Shoot.
- Shut up, you guys.

1216
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,358
Stop rambling.

1217
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:42,139
Okay, but one last request.

1218
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,144
Can l remove my uniform?

1219
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,185
l love it to death.
if it gets stained, l..

1220
01:24:58,359 --> 01:24:59,326
Take off his uniform and bury him.

1221
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:19,175
They have flown away. Should we also..

1222
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:28,355
Bana.

1223
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:36,286
Please let us go. The world
outside must be very interesting.

1224
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:39,298
Bana, you know you aren"t
allowed to go outside.

1225
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,269
Yes, l know. l forget
sometimes. l"ll go this way.

1226
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,374
You room"s that way.

1227
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:52,441
l am not alone in that house. l"ve
forgotten the path. Come along.

1228
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,315
How many here..
- Eight million.

1229
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,262
That"s it?
- That"s all we have so far.

1230
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,287
The King of Soorajgarh
has sent fifteen million.

1231
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,228
He"s made a final offer on the
cement factory sale. 40 million.

1232
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,196
Just 40?
- But Bana..

1233
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,436
Refuse.
- But Bana..

1234
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,199
l said no. Forget him.

1235
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,236
Dileep. Dileep.

1236
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,406
Coming.
- Come out quickly.

1237
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,244
lf it"s so urgent why
don"t you come inside?

1238
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:30,409
This is not a joke. Come out quickly.

1239
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:32,453
l"d given you five
cheques of Rs.200,000 each.

1240
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,322
Yes.
- And Rs.70,000 in cash.

1241
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,390
l had given all of it to Adarsh.

1242
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,223
He says there"s just 270,000
in the festival account.

1243
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,261
How can that be?
- That is the way it is.

1244
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:46,300
Hello.
- ls Adarsh there? Dileep here.

1245
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,368
l"ll call him.

1246
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,362
l"ll ask the idiot. He must have
given the money to Duki Bana.

1247
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,502
l"ll tear that Duki
Bana to pieces some day.

1248
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,279
What happened?

1249
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,269
Hello..
- Hello

1250
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,315
Yes, Dileep, tell me

1251
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,317
l had given you a
million. One.. one minute.

1252
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,319
Kiran.

1253
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,455
Hello.

1254
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:11,326
Kiran"s with you.
- Yes. She told me that the money..

1255
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:15,262
Duki Bana has the money.
He"s kept it for the party.

1256
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,264
That money came from the sponsors not..

1257
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:19,357
..for the party, for the festival.

1258
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,469
Whatever you want to
say, speak to Duki Bana.

1259
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,399
What happened?

1260
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:31,478
She is pregnant.

1261
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:35,539
Kiran.

1262
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,383
l had told you to use protection.

1263
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,344
l don"t want to get pregnant.

1264
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,322
l don"t want to bring another
illegitimate child into this world.

1265
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:44,380
Kiran, l..

1266
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,290
What, what are you going to do now?

1267
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,529
Lousy irresponsible
man, what have you done?

1268
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,292
l didn"t do it intentionally.

1269
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,332
Oh, it happened all by itself.

1270
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,492
Everything"s a joke to you.
- Kiran.

1271
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:56,360
What difference does it make
to him? He"s a man after all.

1272
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,428
Kiran. Don"t get hyper. lt"s done now.

1273
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,440
lt happened with me, not you.

1274
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,339
You"re sure you"re pregnant?

1275
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:05,504
Dileep, what are you saying?
She missed her menses.

1276
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:07,382
l hate you, Dileep.

1277
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,406
Dileep take her to a doctor.

1278
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,517
She"s a month pregnant.

1279
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,456
lt needs to be aborted.

1280
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:16,523
When can it be done?

1281
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,459
Can it be done today?

1282
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:24,420
l"ll be back.

1283
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,398
What do you want to
speak to Duki Bana about?

1284
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,464
Yes, Dileep, tell me..

1285
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,344
Where are the other 800,000..

1286
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:44,381
Meaning..
- You"ve kept 800,000 from the festival fund.

1287
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,486
Yes, so..

1288
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:46,553
Who the hell do you think you
are asking these questions from?

1289
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,458
That money had been
collected for the festival..

1290
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,447
..from the sponsors..

1291
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:54,495
That money"s spent.

1292
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,453
Spent? Meaning?

1293
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:01,400
lt"s spent, blown up.
What else does that mean?

1294
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:03,436
That money wasn"t for
you to mess around with.

1295
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:06,564
Dileep.
- Have you gone nuts?

1296
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:12,446
Was the money yours?

1297
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:17,383
Did you bring it?

1298
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,420
Why is it hurting you?

1299
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:23,590
Was it your money?

1300
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:31,420
You want to see how l mess around..

1301
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:34,601
..which places l go to.

1302
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,470
Where l blow up the money..

1303
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,526
What songs l sing..

1304
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:38,605
You want to see all these?

1305
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,645
Bring him along. We"ll show him.

1306
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:45,669
But Bana, we..

1307
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:47,671
Come on, Dileep.

1308
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,609
Come on.

1309
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:56,614
Prithvi Hail Rajputana!

1310
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:14,470
Go, go inside.

1311
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,570
Go on. No one"s going to rape you.

1312
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:32,652
Step in.

1313
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:35,586
Your shirt.. take it off and wear this.

1314
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:48,600
At this point, we have only
920 million in our treasury.

1315
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:53,476
Our army numbers merely
eleven hundred and twenty six.

1316
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:56,505
Forget the storm we spoke of.

1317
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:57,573
We can"t even kick up a breeze.

1318
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:00,487
lf things go on like
this, we"ll take another..

1319
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:01,613
..ten years to come
anywhere close to our goal.

1320
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:05,624
Till then, our revolution will
stay buried under the ground..

1321
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:14,591
And here, the king of Karangarh
has sent his son abroad to study.

1322
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:17,570
Jack and Jill went
up the hill to fetch..

1323
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,537
And also, he"s showering
him with loads of money.

1324
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:27,140
lf you can"t include your own sons
and grandsons in this revolution..

1325
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,209
..then should l hire
revolutionaries from Kashmir.

1326
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:34,016
if we sit doing
nothing, we"ll never be..

1327
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:35,055
..able to bring about a revolution.

1328
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,057
lt"s no use gathering here
and wasting each other"s time.

1329
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:41,025
lf you really want a revolution,
you will have to rub your faces..

1330
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,153
..crimson with blood, not red powder.

1331
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:45,028
You"ll have to empty your coffers.

1332
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,034
lf you want a real revolution
then wipe the colour off your..

1333
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,196
..face and show your true
self. Or quit pretending.

1334
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,207
Hail Rajputana.

1335
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:10,250
Who am l? Prithvi Bana.

1336
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,081
How did you know?

1337
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,127
Then you must have recognised..

1338
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,060
..every coloured face gathered there.

1339
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,164
Yes.

1340
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,064
Then what"s the point
in colouring your faces?

1341
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:21,134
Tell me. Tell me.

1342
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,134
l have a better idea.

1343
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:25,227
What?

1344
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:32,238
This goes on the face and a bit
of red powder on your back side.

1345
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:37,149
You"ll all look the same,
only then can you become one..

1346
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,207
One Rajputana.

1347
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,155
Come on.
- l should make them stand naked in the hot sun.

1348
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,216
l am putting in such a lot of effort..

1349
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:47,227
..and they are doing nothing.

1350
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:50,130
Like statues.

1351
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,268
Old bones cannot help
in our revolution..

1352
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:57,294
Climb up so high that you stand
at the peak of the Himalayas..

1353
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:00,266
..and then God himself
asks, so, tell me, you fool.

1354
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,365
How"re you going to climb down?

1355
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:21,317
You had gone too.

1356
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:24,153
Yes.

1357
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,188
Didn"t enjoy it.

1358
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,168
What"ll they get by doing all this?

1359
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:38,210
Ask him who took you there.

1360
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,247
Do you still want the money?

1361
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:55,192
l wont be able to do all of this, Bana.

1362
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:56,296
What?

1363
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:04,295
l had come here to
study So? l"m leaving.

1364
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:08,205
Are you really a Rajput or a coward..

1365
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:12,174
l"m talking to you, face me.

1366
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,278
l messed up by trusting him.

1367
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:25,291
They told me, you are an idiot.

1368
01:34:26,227 --> 01:34:27,361
What you are doing is not a revolution..

1369
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:31,320
..it"s lunacy. Rajasthan
doesn"t belong to Rajputs alone.

1370
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:35,325
What? Who taught him this..

1371
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,364
Don"t speak like a government
servant. l"ll smash your face.

1372
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,208
What makes you so sure that
you won"t fight amongst..

1373
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:46,303
..yourselves once you
get your Rajputana?

1374
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:48,372
And break up again into a Mevar,
Marwad, Jaipur and Jaisalmer..

1375
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:51,282
There"s no guarantee. Come. Come.

1376
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:53,216
l"ve been looking for the land of
the valiant since god-knows-when.

1377
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:54,345
Prithvi Bana, stop it.
- Come on, from here.

1378
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:57,414
Practice makes a man perfect.
- Leave this place. l"ll kill you!

1379
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:01,325
Duki don"t touch him. l
said, Duki don"t touch him..

1380
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:07,356
Let him go. Leave him or.
Lay your hands off him.

1381
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:11,236
We took Pakistan by right,
we"ll take Hindustan by force.

1382
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:12,406
No one should get in the way now..

1383
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:16,399
l"m taking away Rajputana too,
understood? Come, give me a beat.

1384
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:21,244
lt"s a sale, it"s a sale.

1385
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,384
Every coin knows who"ll use it.

1386
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:25,443
Every grain knows who chews it.

1387
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,283

lt"s a sale.. it"s a sale..

1394
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,469
Religion is the opium
and you"re it"s agent.

1395
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:43,437
Your mother"s husband
asks who"s your father.

1396
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:45,438
How will you prove it?

1397
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:50,376
lt"s a sale.

1398
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:53,413
Enough. - Get out!
- Listen to me.

1399
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:55,304
Enough, Bana!

1400
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:03,356
Use your own guns. Come on!

1401
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:09,325
My ancestors have shed
their blood for this land.

1402
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:12,329
Rajputs have lain
their lives down for it.

1403
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:16,460
Don"t try to explain
my revolution to me.

1404
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:20,464
lf you want to study, study history.

1405
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:24,341
We"ve always been denied justice.

1406
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,336
We have been betrayed.

1407
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:31,450
Get it on with the girl,
that"s all you"re good for.

1408
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:35,377
Bana!

1409
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,423
Give justice but give just half of it..

1410
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:40,460
..and if even that seems too much..

1411
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,330
..give just five grams of it. Save.

1412
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:47,595
Keep your country bountiful.

1413
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:50,333
We"ll be happy with just that much.

1414
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:51,496
And won"t even point fingers
at those who keep the rest.

1415
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:55,508
Even Duryodhan could not give freely.

1416
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:57,510
Never received the
blessings of his people..

1417
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:01,471
..instead he tried to rein Lord Krishna in.
- Bana!

1418
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:04,381
Lord Krishna was furious.

1419
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:09,354
He appeared before him,
quaking with anger and said..

1420
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:10,481
Bring the chains forth, he said.

1421
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:12,458
Duryodhan, bind me, he said..

1422
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:16,361
Look down heavens, l have the touch..

1423
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:17,488
Pause wind, look, l have the touch.

1424
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:19,362
Every note resides within me every..

1425
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,424
..corner"s contained within me.

1426
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,628
Every soul of me is born.

1427
01:37:23,404 --> 01:37:25,372
Each one returns to me when torn.

1428
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:28,374
Here, each day of the
Mahabharat was spent.

1429
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:30,376
Here"s where the world began, will end.

1430
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:32,378
Lined with corpses, yes, it"s true.

1431
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:33,413
Can you see yourself lie here too?

1432
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:43,412
Bana..

1433
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:51,486
Next time, Bana..

1434
01:37:57,638 --> 01:38:03,508
John Lenon everywhere!

1435
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:11,551
Burn it.

1436
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,559
lt"s done. Prepare for the funeral..

1437
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:29,458
Bana, why do you do it?
Aren"t you scared of him..

1438
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,509
A disbeliever fears only the storms.

1439
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:42,547
l"m a disbeliever.

1440
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,179
Who"s Madhuri?

1441
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:53,260
What?

1442
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:57,355
Who"s Madhuri, tell me who is Madhuri?

1443
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:01,267
Don"t turn away. Answer my question.

1444
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:05,239
l want an answer, tell me who
is Madhuri, l want to know!

1445
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:09,369
Madhuri is who you can
never be. Don"t irritate me..

1446
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:34,458
That.. Kiran..

1447
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:37,294
She"s gone. Her brother picked her up.

1448
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:43,240
The doctor didn"t allow me to meet
her. Kiran had left instructions.

1449
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:52,344
Hello. ls this Kiran"s
residence? This is Dileep..

1450
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:58,246
What happened?

1451
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:03,363
Dileep"s here.

1452
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:13,373
You"re the General Secretary?

1453
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,272
You resigned, l took up the post.

1454
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:18,435
Why didn"t you tell me?

1455
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:22,244
Kiran you have no idea. These people..

1456
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:23,374
Dileep, if you"ve got something
important to say, then talk..

1457
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:24,451
We have a lot of work.

1458
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:26,510
Can l talk to you in private?

1459
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,276
No.

1460
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:29,389
l"m sorry about
whatever happened, Kiran.

1461
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,459
lt won"t happen again.
Please don"t get angry.

1462
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:36,256
Dileep, please leave.
lt"ll be good for you..

1463
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:42,527
..if you leave peacefully One minute!
- Let"s go!

1464
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,371
Why did you rub red
powder on Ransa"s face?

1465
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:50,298
Jadwal did.

1466
01:40:51,412 --> 01:40:52,379
Why?

1467
01:40:55,516 --> 01:40:57,381
You had said something to Murari.

1468
01:40:58,519 --> 01:41:00,384
Something about hanging him in..

1469
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:05,314
..the market square
like Najibullah in Kabul.

1470
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:07,418
He wanted to answer you.

1471
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:16,564
You"ll would have been cremated
the same day as your father.

1472
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:19,339
The only reason you"ll
are here alive is..

1473
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,405
..because of sir. Remember that.

1474
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:33,411
My Sire..

1475
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:41,522
He flies into a rage
my sire, rants, raves..

1476
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:49,426
Spits fire, causes me pain.

1477
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:59,539
""My Sire flies into a rage..""

1478
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:07,444
""Rants, raves, spits
fire, causes me pain.""

1479
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:16,497
Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.

1480
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:20,601
Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.

1481
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:25,629
""My Sire flies into a rage..""

1482
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:30,511
""Rants, raves, spits
fire, causes me pain.""

1483
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:34,548
Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.

1484
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:38,575
Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.

1485
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,381
My sire growls, grumbles,
simmers and then..

1486
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:47,394
..rumbles, leaves me teary-eyed.

1487
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:53,396
Just like a raging
Uncle Sam strikes in..

1488
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:57,403
..the dead of the night.

1489
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:01,498
""Just like a raging Uncle Sam
strikes in the dead of the night.""

1490
01:43:01,575 --> 01:43:07,445
""My sire..""

1491
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:31,434
My in-laws give me grief..

1492
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:34,675
..taunt me beyond belief.

1493
01:43:34,675 --> 01:43:39,635
l"m haunted by ghouls and ghosts..

1494
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:45,440
..l am under an evil spell.

1495
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:48,453
My sire calls his girl a "dear.."

1496
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:50,456
His locals brew a "beer."

1497
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:52,458
He craves an English tongue..

1498
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:54,494
..in more ways than one!

1499
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:59,589
An English Jaipur and
an English Bikaner.

1500
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:06,607
As if mineral water from a bottle..

1501
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:07,665
..makes him an Englishman.

1502
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:10,504
As if mineral water from a bottle..

1503
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:12,546
..makes him an Englishman.

1504
01:44:12,546 --> 01:44:18,576
""My sire..""

1505
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:40,696
He brought the "other"
woman home instead..

1506
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:46,509
He brought the "other"
woman home instead..

1507
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:50,516
She"s just a friend, he said.

1508
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:54,645
She"s just a friend, he said.

1509
01:44:56,657 --> 01:45:00,650
He unsheathed his sword and..

1510
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:04,765
He unsheathed his sword and..

1511
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:08,724
lt was cold like a coca cola!

1512
01:45:08,835 --> 01:45:14,637
lt was cold like a coca cola!

1513
01:45:15,575 --> 01:45:19,636
Now, feathers are
ruffled, there"s furore.

1514
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:23,649
Now, feathers are
ruffled, there"s furore.

1515
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:27,788
Now, feathers are
ruffled, there"s furore.

1516
01:45:27,788 --> 01:45:35,696
This heart is screaming out for more..

1517
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:39,700
l"ve been shamed in the market square.

1518
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:43,704
My dress has been stained with a tear.

1519
01:45:43,704 --> 01:45:49,574
My heart thuds louder and
louder through the night..

1520
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:56,616
..just like democracy, trying to speak..

1521
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:57,818
..with its mouth shut tight.

1522
01:45:57,818 --> 01:46:00,721
Just like democracy, trying to speak..

1523
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:01,779
..with its mouth shut tight.

1524
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:06,587
""Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.""

1525
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:10,596
""Just like the towers that
got struck by the planes.""

1526
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:14,623
""Just like a raging Uncle Sam
strikes in the dead of the night.""

1527
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:18,672
""Just like a raging Uncle Sam
strikes in the dead of the night.""

1528
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:21,800
""And Afghanistan..""

1529
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:26,747
""And Afghanistan was ruined.""

1530
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:30,751
""And Afghanistan was ruined.""

1531
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:36,621
""Just like the towers that got struck by the planes.""
- ""My Sire..""

1532
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:40,250
Where"s the key?

1533
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:48,199
Why are you staring at me
like this. What did l do now?

1534
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:51,204
lf you didn"t then you surely..

1535
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:53,263
..would have, had l not
reached there in time.

1536
01:46:54,174 --> 01:46:57,371
What have you taken me for?

1537
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:02,273
Dileep wasn"t as big an idiot
as that girl made him out to be.

1538
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:04,274
You aren"t playing this game, she is.

1539
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,187
She"s playing with you
and you"re letting her.

1540
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:11,256
Where have l kept my car keys?

1541
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,157
You aren"t listening to me.

1542
01:47:15,228 --> 01:47:18,356
l know what she is and what
she isn"t, don"t patronise me.

1543
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:20,188
Where are the car keys?

1544
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:27,363
You couldn"t tell me earlier.

1545
01:47:28,241 --> 01:47:30,175
l did, but you never listen.

1546
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:38,342
You danced very well
today. Drop Madhuri home.

1547
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:42,355
Who"s that lousy woman?

1548
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:44,346
She"s a lethal one. Bana
just doesn"t listen..

1549
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:46,225
He"s the leader of the revolution.

1550
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,227
Tomorrow, it could be Karan"s turn.

1551
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:52,323
Who"s Karan?
- The fellow who was with the girl. Her brother..

1552
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,390
He"s a Bana too.

1553
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:57,270
Not yet, he will be.

1554
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:00,430
He killed Ransa so he could become one.

1555
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,301
They aren"t idiots by birth alone.

1556
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:07,209
You should try to drive some
sense into Duki Bana"s head.

1557
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:08,415
Does he ever listen to me?

1558
01:48:08,415 --> 01:48:11,350
He"ll have to or you"ll lose him.

1559
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:15,220
lf l hadn"t followed her,
she would have had him..

1560
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:16,255
..in no time at all..

1561
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:19,380
Come in, sir.

1562
01:48:20,393 --> 01:48:21,360
Hanif..

1563
01:48:21,428 --> 01:48:23,293
Yes, sir..
- How come Bana"s vehicle is still here?

1564
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:25,297
Yes, sir, he left with Kiran in her car.

1565
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:32,301
Come on, let"s go.

1566
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:39,334
That idiot..

1567
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:46,275
What happened ma"am? Bhati, look here..

1568
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,321
Yes, Ma"am.

1569
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:49,412
Do l look like that filmstar, Tabu?

1570
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:51,446
Of course, you do.

1571
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:53,254
You aren"t lying, are you?

1572
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:54,293
No, ma"am.

1573
01:48:55,395 --> 01:48:56,419
Then what does that Kiran have?

1574
01:48:58,465 --> 01:49:00,330
Can she dance the way l do?

1575
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:03,401
Can she love the way l
do? Can she take a beating?

1576
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:06,369
What does she have then?

1577
01:49:09,409 --> 01:49:10,398
Look away.

1578
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:21,487
She never loved you, Dileep.

1579
01:49:24,357 --> 01:49:26,325
She is just angry because
l got her pregnant.

1580
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:28,393
Adarsh and Duki Bana have incited her.

1581
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:29,428
They couldn"t fool
me with his nonsense..

1582
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:30,463
..so now they"re trying it on Kiran.

1583
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,301
Kiran has no idea what
those guys are about.

1584
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,495
You love her so much
that you don"t see her.

1585
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,429
She knows everything.

1586
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:44,305
She"s innocent.

1587
01:49:44,444 --> 01:49:46,344
She wasn"t meant for you.

1588
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:51,439
Where are you going now?

1589
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:57,449
""Settle in my dreams.""

1590
01:49:58,358 --> 01:50:04,354
""Make me besotted by you.""

1591
01:50:12,539 --> 01:50:19,411
You fool, why are you
here? Leave me, you fool!

1592
01:50:20,447 --> 01:50:21,414
Leave me!

1593
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:24,509
Leave me!

1594
01:50:46,506 --> 01:50:47,495
Dileep..

1595
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:49,499
What did you say to her?

1596
01:50:51,544 --> 01:50:52,511
To whom?

1597
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:53,546
To Kiran.

1598
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:59,385
You must have said something to her..

1599
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:02,546
..at the hospital that made her leave.

1600
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,581
You didn"t like my
being with her, did you?

1601
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,394
lf she wasn"t meant for
me then who was, you?

1602
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,419
Why are you looking away?
Look at me, you lousy woman.

1603
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:14,467
lf she wasn"t meant for
me then who was, you?

1604
01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:21,597
""Money is everything.""

1605
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:27,546
""The one l left behind..""

1606
01:51:27,614 --> 01:51:31,448
""..hasn"t changed at all.""

1607
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:39,425
The wind, it punishes me. Even my..

1608
01:51:39,492 --> 01:51:44,452
..loneliness is not lonely enough.

1609
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,465
You"re up this early. Haven"t you slept?

1610
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,626
l was waiting for you.

1611
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:53,331
l had gone to Madhuri"s house.

1612
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:56,264
You weren"t there either.

1613
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:05,184
What had you gone to do there?

1614
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:09,288
Meet you.

1615
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:13,325
lt was the first day of the
Diwali festival yesterday.

1616
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:16,162
Little crackers kept
bursting inside my heart.

1617
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:20,263
So, l thought lt was
time l burst a big one.

1618
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:30,170
Bhanwar.

1619
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:37,250
Make me some tea.

1620
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:38,318
Anuja ma"am has left.

1621
01:52:38,318 --> 01:52:40,183
So, what do l do? l"m leaving too.

1622
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:41,277
So, you"re doing me a favour
by telling me. Get lost.

1623
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:43,313
l didn"t get a chance to tell
you last night, but Bittu..

1624
01:52:45,225 --> 01:52:47,193
..l was five-years-old
when you were born.

1625
01:52:48,328 --> 01:52:49,295
lf ever anyone understood
you better than..

1626
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:54,323
..your father or your
brother, it was Anuja.

1627
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:58,336
She made you her friend
despite your shortcomings.

1628
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,401
She has lost nothing, you have.

1629
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:05,411
You want people who want you to change.

1630
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:07,311
Look what you"ve become because of them.

1631
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:11,216
But Anuja ma"am liked
you just the way you were.

1632
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:20,426
She was the one who got
your friend, Ransa killed.

1633
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:22,318
She"s the daughter of the same King.

1634
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:24,320
She"s no woman. She"s a lousy woman.

1635
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:27,332
Don"t abuse her. lf you don"t
believe me, go see for yourself.

1636
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:29,333
How she"s stuck to Duki Bana.

1637
01:53:29,402 --> 01:53:32,371
Look. Look at this.
This isn"t make-up..

1638
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:35,407
That idiot Duki thrashed me
because of that lousy woman.

1639
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:39,411
You still think l"m lying.
Then go see for yourself.

1640
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:46,386
l swear on Ransa. Where are
you going? Listen to me first.

1641
01:53:46,386 --> 01:53:51,346
Hear me out. l"m not lying!

1642
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:56,457
""Oh, Lord.""

1643
01:53:56,462 --> 01:54:00,398
""Oh, Lord.""

1644
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:06,431
""Oh, Lord.""

1645
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:12,367
""Oh, Lord.""

1646
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:17,282
lt"s still fresh in our memories.

1647
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,409
That melodious world..

1648
01:54:19,586 --> 01:54:22,419
Coloured balloons in our hot fists.

1649
01:54:22,488 --> 01:54:25,389
That fragrant time.

1650
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:32,492
""Oh, Lord.""

1651
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:36,399
""Oh, Lord.""

1652
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:39,302
lt was a world of dreams.

1653
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,499
A world of books.

1654
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:44,509
Of shivers in each breath.

1655
01:54:44,611 --> 01:54:47,444
And intoxicated eyes.

1656
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:53,351
""Oh, Lord.""

1657
01:54:54,354 --> 01:54:58,524
""Oh, Lord.""

1658
01:54:58,524 --> 01:55:01,461
There was the earth, the sky.

1659
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:04,397
But we didn"t know..

1660
01:55:04,397 --> 01:55:07,332
Where we stood..

1661
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:10,369
..was the brink of a deep, dark well.

1662
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:23,516
ln a crowd they came.

1663
01:55:23,516 --> 01:55:26,486
ln every hand a gleaming dagger.

1664
01:55:26,486 --> 01:55:29,422
Screaming "throw down those books."

1665
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:32,357
And step inside a prison cell.

1666
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:34,484
This deep dark well..

1667
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,530
..is not dark at all.

1668
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:40,500
There"s a treasure here.

1669
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:43,367
A new world for us all.

1670
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:45,529
Jump in with daggers drawn.

1671
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:48,541
Kill whoever is inside.

1672
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:54,377
You"re the warriors we seek.

1673
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:58,518
The Alexanders of tomorrow.

1674
01:55:58,518 --> 01:55:59,507
Go see..

1675
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:10,589
We just did what they told us to do.

1676
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:13,530
We fulfilled their desire.

1677
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:14,566
We don"t know why, what, who..

1678
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:16,397
l want to talk to
Kiran. Put that gun down.

1679
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:17,570
Dileep, l need to talk to Kiran.

1680
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:18,604
Dileep, you"ve gone insane?

1681
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:20,435
Shut up! l want to speak to Kiran.

1682
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,529
""The blood..""

1683
01:56:21,607 --> 01:56:25,668
Kiran isn"t here.. Call
her then. Call her..

1684
01:56:26,446 --> 01:56:28,573
What if l don"t?

1685
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:31,584
Shut up!

1686
01:56:31,584 --> 01:56:34,417
lt"s a happy day in Rajasthan.

1687
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:36,589
The freedom party has won the elections.

1688
01:56:36,589 --> 01:56:41,424
And all their kings and princes
have returned victorious.

1689
01:56:41,494 --> 01:56:43,519
Bana. Bana..

1690
01:56:43,596 --> 01:56:46,463
Bhati, call her.

1691
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:49,635
Bhati, call her. l want to talk to her.

1692
01:56:49,635 --> 01:56:50,624
Have you gone insane?

1693
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:54,574
Call her. - Okay. - l want to talk
to her. - l"m calling her here.

1694
01:56:54,574 --> 01:56:55,608
l"m not going anywhere.

1695
01:56:55,608 --> 01:56:56,642
l want to speak to her in your presence.

1696
01:56:56,642 --> 01:56:57,631
Okay.
- Call her.

1697
01:56:58,578 --> 01:56:59,612
Bhati, don"t call her.

1698
01:56:59,612 --> 01:57:01,614
You stay quiet.

1699
01:57:01,614 --> 01:57:02,648
All this is happening because of you.
- Bhati.

1700
01:57:02,648 --> 01:57:03,637
l told you so many times
not to meet that girl.

1701
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,479
Bhati! Call her.
- Yes, l"m telling her.

1702
01:57:05,585 --> 01:57:08,452
l"m calling her.
- Go. Go.

1703
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:09,545
Yes, l"m going.

1704
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:12,592
She doesn"t love you.

1705
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:13,626
She didn"t realize it yet.

1706
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:14,660
Stop talking like a kid.

1707
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:16,457
You snatched her away from me.

1708
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:17,663
She got Ransa killed.

1709
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:19,631
Gaurav killed her. He is also using her.

1710
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,674
What! Me talk to your president.

1711
01:57:28,674 --> 01:57:31,472
The president of United
States of America.

1712
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:33,478
What you persons have
done to the middle east?

1713
01:57:33,546 --> 01:57:36,515
Bana.
. We are not able to celebrate our Diwali because of the bad eye

1714
01:57:36,616 --> 01:57:38,618
Bana.
- You have taken the entire oil wells.

1715
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:39,607
One minute.

1716
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,598
Bana. Bana. One minute.

1717
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,636
Hello! Yes, Sanjeev.

1718
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:01,696
Now listen.. There is that girl..

1719
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:04,577
What is her name? Yes, Kiran.
Tell her to call Dukhi Bana.

1720
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:05,645
lmmediately.

1721
01:58:05,645 --> 01:58:07,647
l am her father speaking
and yours as well. Got it?

1722
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:08,614
Now make the call fast.

1723
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,618
l am a senior Cambridge student..

1724
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:14,654
..and don"t try to teach me
what America is all about.

1725
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:16,519
What happened?
- Nothing. Just like that..

1726
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:19,615
You carry on with
worshipping. l"ll be back.

1727
01:58:19,759 --> 01:58:21,594
Where is he?
- He is there downstairs.

1728
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:23,528
One minute.

1729
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:25,423
Come here.

1730
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:28,367
Don"t let anyone go out. Got it?

1731
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:29,469
No one will go out. Got it?

1732
01:58:29,469 --> 01:58:30,436
Till l return.

1733
01:58:30,536 --> 01:58:32,333
All of them are cowards.

1734
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:35,441
No one has the courage to come forward.

1735
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:40,275
lf Dukhi dies..

1736
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:46,442
..they have no one who can
become their commander-in-chief.

1737
01:58:50,323 --> 01:58:52,257
And to make me the
commander-in-chief they will have..

1738
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:53,451
..to give father"s name..

1739
01:58:54,393 --> 01:58:55,451
As long as Bhati is there..

1740
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:58,361
..it"s tough to kill Dukhi.

1741
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:01,400
Dilip. Dilip, talk to her on phone.

1742
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,265
She"ll make a call.
- l don"t want to talk to her on phone.

1743
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:04,403
l want to talk to her in front of you.

1744
01:59:04,403 --> 01:59:05,505
Ok, talk to her.

1745
01:59:05,505 --> 01:59:07,530
By the time she comes
here Bana will die.

1746
01:59:08,307 --> 01:59:09,296
Bhati, tell her to come here.

1747
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:12,274
Bhati, tell her to come here.

1748
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:14,370
Tell her to come here.

1749
01:59:16,415 --> 01:59:18,406
What will you do by calling her here?

1750
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:21,411
You will give away the bride?

1751
01:59:22,588 --> 01:59:24,488
We have to remove Bhati from our path.

1752
01:59:32,431 --> 01:59:36,299
Hello! One minute.

1753
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:40,405
Bhati"s call. Dukhi Bana
wants to talk to Kiran Shah.

1754
01:59:44,610 --> 01:59:46,407
Tell him she can"t meet her.

1755
01:59:48,481 --> 01:59:49,505
Kiran can"t meet him.

1756
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:55,342
Ok. Alright.

1757
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,516
Bhati is coming to union office.

1758
02:00:01,494 --> 02:00:03,519
You know with how
many men she has slept?

1759
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:05,523
l want to hear it from her.

1760
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:07,525
You think a lot.

1761
02:00:10,636 --> 02:00:13,537
You don"t want to
accept that she used you.

1762
02:00:14,373 --> 02:00:15,533
Karan made her to do
that on your insistence.

1763
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:17,364
On my insistence?

1764
02:00:17,476 --> 02:00:19,603
Why did you need to make
Ransa contest the elections?

1765
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:24,347
You.. lt was not my decision.

1766
02:00:25,518 --> 02:00:26,542
lt was Raja Saheb"s.

1767
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:28,478
Which Raja Saheb, Bana?

1768
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:31,353
His Highness Mrityunjay Singh.

1769
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:34,356
The founder of Rajputana.

1770
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:37,358
Ransa"s father.

1771
02:00:39,398 --> 02:00:44,563
He too made the same mistake that
my father did with Prithvi Bana..

1772
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:48,369
For schooling he was sent to England..

1773
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:52,374
..to John Lenin"s..

1774
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:59,117
As desperately as you
seek Kiran, Dilip..

1775
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:08,216
..l want Rajputana even more.

1776
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:11,152
What if l had gone and
told everything to police?

1777
02:01:12,365 --> 02:01:14,128
You wouldn"t have told them.

1778
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,167
Why?

1779
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:17,260
Because you are a nice guy.

1780
02:01:19,238 --> 02:01:23,299
When l can kill Jadwal..

1781
02:01:26,245 --> 02:01:28,236
..imagine what could have l done to you.

1782
02:01:36,355 --> 02:01:38,118
Can you fetch me some water?

1783
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:55,306
After the imposition of this ban..

1784
02:01:55,374 --> 02:01:58,366
..this is the second suicide..

1785
02:01:59,178 --> 02:02:03,249
..where before shooting himself
the victim told his relative..

1786
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:06,241
..lndira Gandhi"s "Garibi
Hatao" (End poverty) scheme.

1787
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,311
..is in reality a..

1788
02:02:39,385 --> 02:02:40,374
Sandeep.

1789
02:02:42,221 --> 02:02:43,210
Sandeep.

1790
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:45,346
Sandeep.

1791
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:03,230
l"ll see.

1792
02:03:07,313 --> 02:03:08,302
Sanjeev.

1793
02:03:17,323 --> 02:03:18,381
l need to talk to you, Kiran.

1794
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:20,258
ln private.

1795
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:30,336
You have gone crazy, Dilip.

1796
02:03:30,336 --> 02:03:31,394
l have not gone crazy, Kiran.

1797
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:33,396
You have made me crazy. You did.

1798
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,274
l can"t talk to you for two minutes.

1799
02:03:36,442 --> 02:03:38,376
You know what people
are saying about you?

1800
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:41,301
l don"t love you, Dilip.

1801
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:43,280
You are lying.
- l am not lying.

1802
02:03:44,483 --> 02:03:46,314
You are forcing me to lie.

1803
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:48,320
Weren"t you in love with me?
- No, l wasn"t.

1804
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,355
Then what was all that?

1805
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:50,344
Nothing.

1806
02:03:50,423 --> 02:03:53,415
lt was nothing for you, Kiran,
but it was everything for me.

1807
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,418
Remove the gun, Dilip.

1808
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,419
Dilip, you won"t understand it.

1809
02:03:58,497 --> 02:04:00,260
Then make me understand it.

1810
02:04:00,366 --> 02:04:01,424
l wanted to become the GS.

1811
02:04:07,506 --> 02:04:10,304
lt was just for that?

1812
02:04:10,476 --> 02:04:12,307
To become the GS. You
could"ve told me once.

1813
02:04:12,378 --> 02:04:13,402
You are saying that today, Dilip.

1814
02:04:15,314 --> 02:04:16,474
lt wouldn"t have been so
easy for you to resign.

1815
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:18,508
Dukhi would"ve never let you do that.

1816
02:04:19,351 --> 02:04:21,285
You could"ve at least
told me once, Kiran.

1817
02:04:21,353 --> 02:04:22,377
Forget Dukhi even his father
couldn"t have done anything.

1818
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:24,512
Whatever you would"ve done he
would"ve never let me become the GS.

1819
02:04:25,324 --> 02:04:27,359
Kiran, today you are
the GS because of him.

1820
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,295
Yes. Because he will do
anything for me today.

1821
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:37,392
You used me to reach Dukhi?

1822
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:39,437
You. Adarsh.

1823
02:04:40,406 --> 02:04:41,498
Which other name do you want to know?

1824
02:04:42,408 --> 02:04:43,375
Adarsh?

1825
02:04:43,442 --> 02:04:45,501
You don"t know how it feels
when everyone laughs at you.

1826
02:04:47,379 --> 02:04:49,472
They call my mother
Raja Saheb"s concubine.

1827
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:57,385
Ransa was your brother?

1828
02:04:57,490 --> 02:04:59,321
He was just my father"s son.

1829
02:05:00,526 --> 02:05:02,323
l have only one brother.

1830
02:05:02,394 --> 02:05:05,522
Kiran, the same brother is
using you. Everyone is using you.

1831
02:05:05,598 --> 02:05:07,532
Who told you that l
am not using everyone?

1832
02:05:10,369 --> 02:05:11,461
Kiran, you are also coming with me.

1833
02:05:11,537 --> 02:05:13,334
Remove the gun, Dilip.

1834
02:05:14,406 --> 02:05:15,498
Remove the gun, Dilip.

1835
02:05:20,446 --> 02:05:22,471
Go away from here. Go.

1836
02:05:37,396 --> 02:05:38,385
Kiran.

1837
02:05:45,538 --> 02:05:50,532
""O world..""
