1
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,641
Let's play a game
in which we unite.

2
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:38,721
Let's play a game of uniting all
that involves the whole world.

3
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:42,401
A game
that involves multiplication

4
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:46,841
which brings everybody together
and helps complete the game.

5
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:50,881
Let's play a game
in which we unite.

6
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,721
A game which ensures
loss and victory

7
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,961
Let's play a game of uniting all
that involves the whole world.

8
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,801
W-What's the time?

9
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,361
Greetings! A young hot boy,
Rajeev, from Mandur

10
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,361
Greetings! A young hot boy,
Rajeev, from Mandur

11
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:06,161
due to very serious reasons
had conflicts at home

12
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,921
his village, the village deity
and everyone.

13
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,401
In short, he had conflicts
with life

14
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:15,841
and was deeply hurt.
So he left his village naked.

15
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,721
I don't need this.
Keep this for yourself.

16
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:34,841
"Naked.."

17
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,481
He reached the city naked.

18
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,601
As he arrived here,
he met Brigadier Kaali Peeli

19
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,481
a notorious philosopher.

20
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,881
You will not find a piece of land,
without being naked.

21
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,761
Even after finding land,
you won't find clothes.

22
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,881
After finding clothes,
you will not get dignity.

23
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:10,881
What's next?

24
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,961
You bought me food and clothes.

25
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,881
Now if you could get a job for me,
it'd be great, sir.

26
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,041
What do you think?

27
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,081
The thrill in getting people
to quit the job

28
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,481
is not found in finding
a job for them.

29
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,361
Did you understand?
You didn't, did you?

30
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:25,561
You should understand.

31
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:35,121
Sir, who is she?

32
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:40,961
She is an honest,
married woman in our village.

33
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,201
I think I understood, sir.
But I didn't understand.

34
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:47,081
Don't get too carried away.
Look at her face.

35
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,081
I forgot to look at her face.
That is good too.

36
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,001
The bell rings. It's 6 o'clock.

37
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,001
The bell rings. It's 6 o'clock.

38
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,281
Take this route and take a right.
You'll find her in the third lane.

39
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,401
Is it, sir?
Have fun now.

40
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,641
Later, I'll get you a job.

41
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:27,481
"Indian Spinach, potato, onion."

42
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:32,641
"Mysore Sandal soap, coconut oil,
coriander."

43
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:38,241
"Instead of going
to the grocery shop with this list"

44
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,641
"come here to me.
- Yes.."

45
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:48,881
"Disconnect your wife's call
looking at me."

46
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,321
"Yes, we did."

47
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,521
"Thank you.
- Welcome."

48
00:05:54,161 --> 00:06:00,961
"The bell rang
and the liquor shop opened."

49
00:05:54,161 --> 00:06:00,961
"The bell rang
and the liquor shop opened."

50
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:04,521
"The glasses touched to cheer."

51
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:08,401
"Time ran out and night fell."

52
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:13,721
"Indian Spinach, potato, onion."

53
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,961
'Consumption of alcohol
is injurious to health.'

54
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:22,601
"Life.."

55
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:40,401
"If you have any silk saris,
please give it to us."

56
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:43,801
"We have to buy a matching lungi."

57
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,321
"We need your blessings."

58
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:52,801
"Our dignity will not be restored,
no matter what we do in return."

59
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,121
"Why do we require fancy stuff?"

60
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:59,961
"Lead your life
with what you have."

61
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:05,121
"You're the chairman
of a savings bank."

62
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:10,561
"We're the reason
for global warming."

63
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:14,201
"Ladies are the one
who dance and scold."

64
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:17,601
"We're just the audience,
aren't we?"

65
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:19,481
"Yes.."

66
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:23,001
"I'm the only one who knows
how decent you are."

67
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,641
"And I will tell nobody."

68
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,721
"Thank you.
- Welcome."

69
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:33,441
"The bell rang."

70
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,121
"The party began."

71
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:40,641
"All my imagination was buried."

72
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,801
"And loyalty went haywire."

73
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:50,201
"Well done!
Indian spinach, potatoes, onion."

74
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,441
"Stop!"

75
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,361
Everybody close your eyes.

76
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,761
Excuse me, give me a kiss.

77
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,521
Yes.

78
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,561
Sound!

79
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:37,361
"This lonely life is not even led
by gypsies."

80
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:44,281
"So, I came here.
But you aren't even looking at me."

81
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:51,481
"Gentlemen never break
into houses."

82
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:58,521
"Carpenter has not installed
a door in my house."

83
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:04,001
"Everything in here is a lie."

84
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:09,401
"Everything looks the same to me."

85
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:16,401
"What's going to be our story?
Please tell us or let us go."

86
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,201
"Okay, sir."

87
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:25,361
"The stories of the young
should never be disclosed."

88
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:30,321
"Thank you.
Bye! - Hello! - Goodbye!"

89
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:34,481
"Indian spinach.."

90
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:39,721
Don't..

91
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,081
Who are you?
- You have forgotten to remember

92
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:46,601
and have forgotten to forget.

93
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,521
You're an elderly person
and I'm still young.

94
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,721
Be it in intoxication or sobriety,
at home or familiar surroundings

95
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:54,841
be yourself always.

96
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,081
What is with him? Who is he?

97
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,881
He is one among millions.

98
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,961
He is a gem.
You won't find anybody like him.

99
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,201
'Parapancha.'

100
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,961
What is it? - Fourth after third,
fifth after fourth

101
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,161
and sixth after fifth.
- What should I do?

102
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,561
The seventh one is here.
- Who is it?

103
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,681
Oh!

104
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:36,841
Come here.

105
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:42,081
He is Bogaleandi Jokumar Seena.
- Okay.

106
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:47,001
He is good for nothing.
But at times, he is useful.

107
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:53,641
This hat is too small for me now.

108
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,601
You keep this.
I'll look for a bigger one.

109
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,401
Oh, God!

110
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:12,721
This is how I landed
in Parapancha.

111
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,881
In this Parapancha,
there's a small world.

112
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,201
There's betrayal, fraud,
joy, sorrow, happiness

113
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,521
grief, laughter, sadness.

114
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,641
One can say that it's like
an emotional dictionary.

115
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:36,201
I'm a friend to these drunkards
here from the past two years.

116
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:41,601
In this world,
I play the role of a waiter.

117
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,561
Few people slap.
Few others share sweets and hugs.

118
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,801
Few others pay tips
when they leave.

119
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:53,361
I wonder where God has gone
by giving us the job

120
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,961
of healing other people.

121
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:59,081
This can be done.
Who knows what's right and wrong?

122
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,161
Welcome, sir.

123
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,521
Seenu!

124
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,641
Greetings, sir.
- Sir! - Welcome.

125
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,761
Oh, welcome, sir..

126
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:20,681
I have a very bad memory nowadays.

127
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,841
They call it anterograde amnesia.

128
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,681
The past won't be forgotten.

129
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,361
Whatever is happening currently
will be registered

130
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:31,641
but cannot be recalled.

131
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:36,881
This means, my brain has lost
it's power to store new memories.

132
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:42,081
Look, I come here every day.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,041
I have no idea
how I find my way here.

134
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:47,361
Come, sir.

135
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,521
Please sit.

136
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,841
Is this required?

137
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,921
I have already poured
water all over my body.

138
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,081
And you say you want
to just wash my feet.

139
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,841
You're like God to me.

140
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,961
I'm just a pawn.

141
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,081
He's the player.

142
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,601
One shouldn't have such wishes.

143
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:23,561
Okay, as you wish.

144
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,761
The container doesn't enhance
the value of honey.

145
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,361
It's the honey that enhances
the value of the container.

146
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,761
My master taught me
to worship in my mind.

147
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,761
When I worship his
feet in my mind

148
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,361
he should get his feet wet.

149
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,401
That is actual worship.

150
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,441
That is success.

151
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:53,761
Isn't it, master?

152
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,441
Okay.

153
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,161
In all phases of your life,
be yourself.

154
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:06,201
There's no end to these people.
Nor is there any end to this world.

155
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:10,921
I was dreaming.
Deep down it felt restless.

156
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,121
By the time I absorbed
the essence of this world

157
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,921
I had forgotten the value
of the other world.

158
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,961
Deep down, it felt restless.

159
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,841
I just came in.
Oh, I didn't see you.

160
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:29,241
Okay. I have my office in a family
restaurant called Parapancha.

161
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,161
Yes..

162
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,801
The two of you visit my office.
Okay.

163
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,481
'Human being.'

164
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,241
Hey, Mahesha!
- Coming, sir.

165
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:50,041
Get a glass of water. There
are two fools coming in.

166
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,401
What else?
- It's just water for now.

167
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,721
Once the fools arrive,
get beer. - Okay, sir.

168
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,081
Okay.

169
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,681
This table is reserved.
Please occupy some other table.

170
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,601
Who is it reserved for?

171
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,441
Hello, Mr. Vijay.

172
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:19,121
I am Kasturi. I'm from Bagalkote.

173
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:22,361
But parents are settled
in Bengaluru from past 35 years.

174
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,161
I am 23 years old.

175
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,441
I know Kannada very well.
Shall we speak in Kannada?

176
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:30,241
Okay.

177
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:31,961
There are many other
unoccupied tables.

178
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:35,201
Otherwise, you can go upstairs.
It's exclusively for ladies.

179
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,441
How good is your eye sight?

180
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,121
Do I belong
to the ladies category?

181
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,961
How do you know Ramesh?

182
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:50,161
He is like a father to me.

183
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,241
He is like a father to you!

184
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:56,721
He never told me.
But you are..

185
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,521
Livelihood.

186
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,201
Oh, I'm sorry..

187
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:19,721
Why are we going to Parapancha?

188
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:22,121
I could've taken you
to a better restaurant.

189
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,201
There's a waiter who works there.

190
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,441
He is that insane man's follower.

191
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,001
Bogaleandi Jokumar Seenu,
is his name.

192
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,761
He's a very
interesting character.

193
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,921
The drinks he prepares
are very tasty.

194
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:44,361
If anyone else gives you the same
drink, it doesn't taste good.

195
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:45,601
Yes.

196
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:49,401
There's always a guy like this
in every profession.

197
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,721
Doctors, cooks, servers..

198
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,001
They serve with love.

199
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,441
Go. Go fast!

200
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,481
Give what he wants.

201
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:07,161
That man is insane.
He is a moron. Go!

202
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:11,121
It doesn't matter who the customer
is until I receive my tip.

203
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,521
What are you looking at?
He's your friend, isn't he?

204
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,681
Go..

205
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,601
Brigadier!

206
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:34,921
I'm a man who belongs
to the public.

207
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,281
Mountbatten Tippi.

208
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,321
It's hot!

209
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,881
Kaali Peeli.
Sit down..

210
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:04,721
What's the time?
Time..

211
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:08,881
"I can write anything
on behind the auto"

212
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,881
"as she left me."

213
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,601
I've played
the most difficult game.

214
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,801
The game of love.

215
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,081
Tell me your story in a single
line I'm quite busy.

216
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,201
I'm a fool who
had a ray of hope

217
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:31,361
in an empty heart.
I am the Auto Poet.

218
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,201
Oh, I understood..

219
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:36,921
We have a new drink
for all lovers like you.

220
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,081
A potion
to eradicate one's mad love.

221
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,961
It's my formula, I discovered
it yesterday only for you.

222
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,761
Drink this.

223
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:50,921
You'll be enlightened.

224
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:55,721
Wait here while I get the potion.

225
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,761
"Come on.."

226
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,721
It's too low to offer
to sleep with someone else

227
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:25,041
while you're here
with your husband.

228
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,681
Think how cheap it is.

229
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:28,201
Disgusting!

230
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,441
Don't say that in Kannada.
It sounds very cheap.

231
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:32,961
Do you want me
to tell you in English?

232
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:35,321
You're getting..

233
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:38,761
Okay, shut up, now!
Order something.

234
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,041
Don't they have a separate
section? Is there no privacy?

235
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:47,921
Privacy is torture.

236
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,681
I like mingling with people,
talking to them, laughing..

237
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,481
I'll fall sleep if I'm alone.
Come. - Okay.

238
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:02,841
This is Seenu.
He serves with love.

239
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:03,961
Hello.
- Hello, sir.

240
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:05,641
Please.

241
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,441
Hi! Darlings!

242
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:18,721
It's getting too hot in here.

243
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,361
Oh, my God!

244
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,041
My feet are happy now.

245
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,241
Why is everything like this?
Why? - Sir..

246
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,961
Sir.. Ask someone
to check the toilet. - Why?

247
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:29,881
There's no water in the loo.
- Water..

248
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,801
Before you sit or stand
in the loo

249
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,481
you need to check
if there's water.

250
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,401
Why didn't you check? Why?

251
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:41,961
Will someone go to the restroom in
a bar and check if there's water?

252
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:45,041
The words bar and water
are rhyming words in Kannada.

253
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,081
From the bar you directly
go to the restroom.

254
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,161
You shouldn't answer.

255
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:52,361
Kaali Peeli, who is this?
Explain me with the context.

256
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:57,401
I can't hear any pulse.
Who is he..

257
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:00,281
His hand is weak after writing
poems behind his auto.

258
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,281
Don't touch his hand.

259
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,321
Auto poet!

260
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,761
Autorickshaw is worth Rs. 2 lakhs.

261
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,121
But you can never estimate
the value of the poet.

262
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:11,641
Please recite a couple of poems.

263
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:15,321
You'll die if you go after
an auto or if you go after a girl.

264
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:17,281
Naughty boy!

265
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,241
You were born to die.

266
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:23,081
I've studied Sanskrit and Kannada
from 7th grade to 10th grade.

267
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:25,561
And I've scored 80 marks
every time.

268
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,161
How dare you compose
a poem in front of me?

269
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,161
Who are you?

270
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:33,641
Don't touch him!
His livers are damaged.

271
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,961
His eyes have turned yellow.

272
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:43,961
The liver given by God
is free. It's his boon.

273
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,041
Why did you ruin it? Why?

274
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:50,881
Love.
- L-Love!

275
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,121
Disgusting!

276
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,801
Why is everything like this?

277
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:01,001
Like me..

278
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,961
Six years.

279
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:06,241
Take another six more months.
Get to the matter.

280
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:10,361
I looked after her for six years.

281
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,641
She left me.
- You loved her for six years.

282
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:15,561
But she got impregnated
within six months.

283
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:17,801
There is no balance.

284
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,601
Inequality in the creation
of this world.

285
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:21,281
Why is there such an imbalance?

286
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:25,321
You've learnt to think
about any matter.

287
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:28,641
Why haven't you
learnt to be practical?

288
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,641
No! - Why are you this confused?
- Stop!

289
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:36,121
You write on the back of an auto.
Why not in front? - Stop!

290
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:39,561
Why do you need this poetry?
- Stop!

291
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,081
Why didn't you check
if there's water? - Stop!

292
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,881
Don't..

293
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,241
Hey, Tippi!

294
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:52,881
Beat me..

295
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,721
Leave..

296
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,001
Tippi, let him go!

297
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:59,921
Hey, let him go!

298
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,721
Leave, sir.

299
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:13,881
Leave. Hey!

300
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,121
Why didn't you check the water..

301
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:19,761
Kannada will triumph. - Tippi!
Kannada will live on. - Leave him!

302
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,761
Do you want the gun?
- Take it..

303
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,241
Hail Lord Ayyappa!

304
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:25,721
Active and passive voice..

305
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:28,801
Do you want to shoot me?
Shoot me..

306
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,361
Fear!
You can't do it!

307
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:33,081
It's poetry!

308
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,521
It's philosophy!

309
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:37,161
It's not a crime.
It's an experience.

310
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,201
Out!

311
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,601
Kaali Peeli. - Whom did you
come to kill, Tippi?

312
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:52,761
I won't say the name.

313
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:54,521
Yes, you!

314
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:58,081
I died when I was in the military.
How can I die again?

315
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:01,601
You're too good to die.

316
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:07,201
Why is everything like this?

317
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:11,441
I don't make friends everywhere.

318
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,201
The bar closes at midnight.

319
00:24:13,721 --> 00:24:15,041
Midnight!

320
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,441
That's the best time.

321
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,481
What's the time now?

322
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,321
Order please. I have mine.

323
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:28,921
Ask what she needs.

324
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,121
You've to have what
Seenu serves, today.

325
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,961
Both food and your drink.

326
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,201
Taste serve with love.

327
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:37,641
Whatever you like.

328
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:38,881
'Vodka Tadka?'

329
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,801
Good boy!
- Okay.

330
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:42,681
Yes, sir.

331
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:50,481
According to astrology,
your horoscopes have to be checked.

332
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,081
If there are any problems, we can
rectify it through few rituals.

333
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:56,241
We will give employment
to those who are unemployed.

334
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:57,841
Unmarried ones can get married.

335
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,241
This is for protection.

336
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:06,241
Finally, a life insurance.

337
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,681
All in one.

338
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:14,961
If you come to me,
your life will be settled.

339
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:19,161
Him?
Chief Minister's son-in-law.

340
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:22,321
Son-in-law?
- He is like a servant at home.

341
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,641
Is he into politics?
- No. He's useless.

342
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:27,601
Oh, no!

343
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:33,201
She is an ex-minister's daughter.
He is her husband.

344
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,201
He studied MBA.
Did he want this?

345
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,041
Who will employ him?

346
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,881
He is the CM's son-in-law.
- He's very intelligent.

347
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,961
He must be unlucky
to have married.

348
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:48,361
He isn't able to achieve anything.

349
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,961
Marry a poor man's daughter.
- Okay, boss.

350
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,801
Don't ever marry
a rich man's daughter.

351
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:02,841
Okay, boss.

352
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:14,921
Say something.

353
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,721
Well..
- Ask something about me.

354
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,561
I think, Mr. Ramesh
must have told you everything.

355
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,521
Actually, there's a lot
that he doesn't know about.

356
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,841
Do you know why?
- Why?

357
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:32,401
Sir, does anyone ask why?

358
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:36,161
I've already told you.
Mr. Ramesh is like my father.

359
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,961
A father doesn't know everything
about his daughter.

360
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,361
Only a mother will know.

361
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:48,401
If he gets to know, I'm dead.

362
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:58,801
Thank you.

363
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,921
Sir, autograph.
- Sure.

364
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,961
Sir, I have come to this city
leaving behind my hometown.

365
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:15,561
I wish to go back home after
I become a famous person like you.

366
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:16,721
Oh, all the best.

367
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,201
Idiot.
Do you want to be like him?

368
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,121
Do you know his worth?

369
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,881
A hundred crore rupees.

370
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,761
Don't disturb. Leave now.

371
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,161
Go away..
- Enjoy, sir.

372
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,961
Sir, you're not saying anything.

373
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,561
I'm the only one speaking.

374
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:33,641
How much property do you have?

375
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:34,961
Do you have property
worth hundred crores?

376
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,601
There's ten thousand crores
worth property.

377
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:39,521
Ten thousand crores!

378
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:43,321
And you are here with me
in Parapancha.

379
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,361
Sorry..

380
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,081
Mr. Ramesh says
that I laugh too much.

381
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:50,601
And he asks me to reduce it.

382
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,841
But I love to laugh.

383
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,121
Now, it's your turn to speak.

384
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:59,401
Okay. Cheers.
- Cheers.

385
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,361
Take this.

386
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:09,921
How good is your eye sight?
You never told me.

387
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,721
Women are such..

388
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,241
"You're the man of my dreams."

389
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:53,201
"Shall I bite you just once?"

390
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:58,161
"I'm an idiot, shall I touch"

391
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:04,401
"your moustache just once?"

392
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:08,401
"I won't exist anymore."

393
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:13,721
"I'm angry with myself."

394
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,201
"Tell me why I came across you?"

395
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:22,281
"You're the man of my dreams."

396
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:28,241
"Shall I beat you up just once?"

397
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:55,241
"It's not enough if just
the eyes are met."

398
00:29:55,321 --> 00:30:00,961
"I didn't know how naughty I was!"

399
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:06,161
"There's no need to understand
what love is"

400
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:12,041
"when you find
a cute face like his."

401
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:16,281
"I'm waiting.."

402
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:21,401
"My heart now belongs to you."

403
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:25,641
"Now we are united."

404
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:29,841
"You're the man of my dreams"

405
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:36,481
"Shall I bite you just once?"

406
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:56,321
"If I happen to hug you tight"

407
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,521
"please don't scold me"

408
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:02,321
"it's not my mistake."

409
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,281
"When confidence takes over me"

410
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:13,401
"there's no room to be shy."

411
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,401
"Finally.."

412
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:22,321
"I was unaware of my pride."

413
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:26,801
"There's a lot more
remaining to speak."

414
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:30,881
"You're the man of my dreams."

415
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:37,241
"Shall I bite you just once?"

416
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:41,841
"I'm an idiot, shall I touch"

417
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:48,441
"your moustache just once?"

418
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:15,961
Why is everything like this?

419
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:19,641
Why?
This is it, Kaali Peeli..

420
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:21,641
There's no value for anything.

421
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:24,361
When you were born you
were just three inches.

422
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,201
But you're coffin is six feet.

423
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:29,561
I was born. Why?

424
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,561
I'm the son of the administrator
of three hermitages, Rangaswamy

425
00:32:35,641 --> 00:32:38,081
and Savitramma. I am Tippeswamy.

426
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,441
Why?

427
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:44,161
Cry now.

428
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:48,361
This is my original cry now.

429
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,161
I'm going to cry now.

430
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:56,161
I'm howling.

431
00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:58,481
No sweat.

432
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,361
Tears! Separation!

433
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:08,081
Do ask why I'm crying,
Kaali Peeli! Ask why I'm crying!

434
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:12,201
Why?
- Dad is evil.

435
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:15,601
One fellow asked me to kill him.

436
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,921
He gave me Rs. 5,000.

437
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:21,841
I was a fourteen year old kid.

438
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:24,841
That was the first job
and I was a young boy.

439
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,401
I want to make it big!

440
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:31,321
On that night,
my dad and I were sleeping

441
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,801
on the floor. Mom was snoring.

442
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,281
It was midnight.

443
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:42,361
I could hear the sound
of a cricket outside.

444
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:47,921
I could also hear
the birds chirping!

445
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:53,761
There was a copper tumbler
which was shining.

446
00:33:55,801 --> 00:34:00,041
I pressed the pillow on his face!

447
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,361
A murder took place.

448
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,881
A father was killed by his son.

449
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:08,921
And that was the specialty.

450
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:17,041
My father breathed his last.

451
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:24,241
I met the person
who instigated this murder.

452
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,081
He paid me Rs. 20,000.

453
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:28,241
Do you want to know why?

454
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:29,561
Every action should have
an opposite reaction.

455
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,961
So, ask me the reason for it.

456
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,201
Okay, forget it.

457
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,321
I had to perform the funeral.

458
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:38,241
With these very hands, I killed him
and cremated him.

459
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:42,401
And I even had a sumptuous meal

460
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:45,481
on the day of his funeral.

461
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,561
I did all this with my right hand.

462
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:50,121
On the twelfth day

463
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:56,761
my mother, my only parent,
my creator

464
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:02,081
eloped with the guy
who hired me. She vanished!

465
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,281
Disappeared!

466
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:06,921
Why did she do that?

467
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:10,201
My mother is a good person,
but her beauty was the evil.

468
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,161
Why does everything

469
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:20,441
have to be between
one or the other?

470
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:27,841
Listen, I don't have time
to talk now. You leave now.

471
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:32,441
I didn't come here to leave.
I came here to take you back.

472
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,681
Where to?
- Somewhere.

473
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,201
But some place
where we can stay together.

474
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,841
I see.
But I can't come.

475
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:42,721
If you don't come,
I'll reveal all your secrets

476
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:44,961
such as who you really are
and what you really do

477
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,081
as I travel the entire city in
an auto-rickshaw with a microphone.

478
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:50,041
How will you stay
in this city after I do that?

479
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,481
Even I have many
dreams for my future.

480
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,481
They say today is a productive day.

481
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:00,801
I have a lot of work to do
in the bar downstairs. - I see.

482
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:00,801
I have a lot of work to do
in the bar downstairs. - I see.

483
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:03,641
I have to work twice as much and
be twice as good as Rajiv. - I see.

484
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,241
Many people's lives should prosper.

485
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,641
God has sent me here for
the sole purpose of serving people.

486
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:17,681
You know my whole story
and my goals.

487
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,521
Until I accomplish them,
I won't have peace of mind.

488
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:25,441
If I'm able to help a few people
today, I might find peace of mind.

489
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:27,721
But you're trying
to place obstacles in my path.

490
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,321
You're always helping people out.

491
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,601
What about the both of us?
When will we accomplish something?

492
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:36,121
Shouldn't the both of us hear some
good news on the productive day?

493
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,721
Oh, God! Don't do anything
until midnight.

494
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,281
I beg of you.
- Hey, Seena. - I'm coming.

495
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:46,121
Come on in, Seenu.

496
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,761
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

497
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,961
Once you are intoxicated,
everything seems the same.

498
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,161
Water, milk, you and even me.

499
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:58,881
You see the world
in a new perspective..

500
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:00,321
Wonderful, sir.
Wonderful!

501
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,521
Pay your respects to the master.

502
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,481
Greetings, sir.

503
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,761
Sir, in the game of hierarchy

504
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:10,481
you'll be at the top
and I'll be below you

505
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,321
and he'll be at the bottom.

506
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:13,601
He's a great guy.

507
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:17,521
Seenu, two for me.
- What will you have, master?

508
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,401
And two for the master.
- Okay.

509
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,841
What are you doing here, Brahma?
Go away. - Okay.

510
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,601
After that,
I was inducted into a monastery.

511
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,641
We were required
to take a cold bath at 5 a.m.

512
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:40,481
and study Sanskrit lessons
in praise of Lord Ganesh.

513
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:41,801
I am a fan of Kannada films.

514
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,961
"Lord Shiva, you watch over
the three realms."

515
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:48,521
"I can't bear the hunger..
Save me in my board exams."

516
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,001
Our ranks were neck to neck.

517
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,321
I was a sort of role model
to other students.

518
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,081
I begged for food
on a rotational basis.

519
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:56,961
I picked a new house every day.

520
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:59,881
I grew up on both vegetarian
and non-vegetarian food.

521
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,441
And one day,
I knocked

522
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:05,641
on some random house for food.

523
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,481
"The person who opened
the door was none other than"

524
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:13,001
"my mother, Kannada"

525
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:18,041
"my dear mother, Sanskrit.
Mother. Savitramma."

526
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,761
My mother..

527
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,641
We had a staring contest.

528
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:31,881
My mom's second husband
who hired me as a contract killer

529
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:35,161
to kill my father vanished.
He went missing.

530
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:41,241
She had another baby from him.
It was all so strange.

531
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,121
There were two options
but only one goal.

532
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:49,841
I had the responsibility
of my younger brother

533
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,081
his education and his well-being.

534
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,361
Also, stopping my mother from
running away with another man.

535
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,481
I was in a situation where I was
forced to do the thing I did best.

536
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,001
There was only one thing
I was good at. One thing.

537
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,281
Murder.

538
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:11,401
I alone have killed 18 people.
Is this not an achievement?

539
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:16,281
There is no evidence.

540
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:17,961
Whom are you here to kill today?

541
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:24,561
What's the time?

542
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,481
Why aren't you telling me
the time, Kaali Peeli? Why?

543
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,601
Death is placing
his tiny steps, and at midnight..

544
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,081
What's the time?

545
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,961
Why aren't you telling the time?
Why?

546
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,201
This is my visiting card.

547
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:45,561
Take a look..
Return it once you're done. Okay?

548
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,401
Give it here.
There you go, sir.

549
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:56,641
Take the money.
- I don't need any money, sir.

550
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,361
Life is not about money.
Right?

551
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,441
But I'll take it if it's
considered a gift for my mastery.

552
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,481
But if you call it fees,
I won't even touch it.

553
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:06,521
Consider it as a gift, sir.

554
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,081
Hail Goddess of fortune.

555
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:13,921
I'm not like the astrologers
who appear on TV. Get it?

556
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,561
If I were to appear on TV

557
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:20,641
all the existing astrologers
will have to pack up.

558
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:21,921
I know a person here.

559
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:25,401
He's promised me a chance
to appear on television.

560
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:26,881
He's upstairs.

561
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,721
But even he demands money.

562
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,841
Women have it a lot easier.
They get jobs easily.

563
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:36,001
Since you're men,
he says you have to pay.

564
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,361
What can I do?

565
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,441
That's the reason
I'm collecting funds.

566
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:47,201
"Come on.."

567
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,401
Ever since I was a child,
I was drawn to social service..

568
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,721
I wanted to work in NGOs.

569
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,441
But the problem is that
NGOs are only able to help out

570
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:06,601
Yes..

571
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,081
But with a TV programme

572
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:13,921
we can touch out to many people.

573
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:18,001
I mean reach out.

574
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,161
Let's go to Imax.
Okay?

575
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,961
Mr. Anirudh.
- Hi, Seenu.

576
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,961
It takes fifteen hours to travel
from Australia to Mumbai.

577
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:29,281
It takes one and a half hours to
travel from Mumbai to Bangalore.

578
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,201
And it takes three hours to get
from the airport to your home.

579
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,321
You have a jet lag
and are exhausted.

580
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:34,001
What shall I get you?
Be quick.

581
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:37,201
Hey magician,
do you have detectives on our tail?

582
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,961
See how..
- I have a special potion with me.

583
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:43,801
If you drink it, you'll learn
everyone's secrets immediately.

584
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,921
Then tell me
the colour of my innerwear.

585
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,561
Red.
- That is correct.

586
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:53,321
Oh, God.
This is too much.

587
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,321
I'm not looking at the ladies.
So, don't freak out.

588
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:57,841
What shall I get you?
Be quick.

589
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:02,881
You know, informing
pregnant village girls

590
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:08,801
about the dangers of smoking, etc.

591
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:13,161
With multiple people..
You know, what I mean to say..

592
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,441
Socially, if something
like that were to happen.

593
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:22,241
Informing about safety measures
when you involve with someone.

594
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,561
Also, warning them not to drink
while they are pregnant

595
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:30,401
because it will harm
the development of the foetus.

596
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,561
These social messages should
touch the village girls.

597
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:39,681
I mean reach them.

598
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:42,441
We should never take
the connecting flight.

599
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:43,401
That's true.

600
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,281
Ask anyone in Bangalore.

601
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,681
How are you, sir?
I'm fine.

602
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:50,121
How are you, ma'am?
I'm fine..

603
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,561
It's all a pack of lies.
Everything.

604
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,921
So, I've invented a potion.
The truth potion. - Wow.

605
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,041
What's that, dude?

606
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,561
Hey, he's talking
about the truth serum. - Yes.

607
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,201
Let him complete, man.
- Correct.

608
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,881
If you drink it, the truth
will come out one after the other.

609
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:08,281
Shall I give it?

610
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,841
You know what, guys?
He's right.

611
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:12,961
Actually, when I was in Australia

612
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:15,681
those guys there had
a knack of opening themselves up.

613
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:18,241
Shall we play a game now,
honestly?

614
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,681
I mean, honestly.

615
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:21,081
We must reveal one good thing

616
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:25,601
and another not so good thing.

617
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,361
Ready?
- Yes.

618
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:31,601
If you want something done,
you need to initiate it.

619
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:33,481
I've done it.

620
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,561
To cross the ocean of emotions,
relationships are the boat and oar.

621
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:45,801
Man doesn't know what he'll
do after he crosses the ocean.

622
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,121
He shouldn't know it!

623
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:51,241
Why does it have to be
one or the other? Why!

624
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,641
For instance, my first love affair.

625
00:43:57,121 --> 00:43:59,201
Sorry. I mean,
the first time I made out.

626
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,121
I had a series of psychological
and physical relationships.

627
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,681
It was the season of spring.

628
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,921
From that point, I had three
relationships every year.

629
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:18,241
Three relationships every year..

630
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:23,721
Maths, geometry and algebra
are all a lie.

631
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:27,561
Activity and creativity
will be lost forever.

632
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:29,361
Why?

633
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,521
Why doesn't anyone
stay together anymore?

634
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,121
Why don't they?

635
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:43,801
But there are exceptions.
Yes.

636
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:46,601
The photo that my mother worshipped

637
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,321
was of Satya Narayan Swami.

638
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:50,881
The beautiful girl
who sold flowers.

639
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,961
The florist.
The girl who sold flowers.

640
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,321
Who was it?

641
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:59,921
Ask me who it was, Kaali Peeli.
Ask me who it was.

642
00:45:02,441 --> 00:45:03,321
Why did you ask me that?

643
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:04,961
This was an unnecessary question.

644
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:07,801
Love is a pain
and it hurts the heart.

645
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:09,961
Why did you ask me that?

646
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:12,441
Go away.
You're weird.

647
00:45:13,481 --> 00:45:17,121
He evoked my flashbacks..

648
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:20,201
Flashbacks..

649
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:26,961
Photo, flowers, skirt, blouse.

650
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:30,321
And sometimes a sari.
Yes.

651
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:36,041
She was around 5 feet
and she was very sexy.

652
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:41,001
She held a jasmine with fingers
that had red nail polish.

653
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,481
Even though
all this was present

654
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:48,841
I was about 45-years old.
She was around 30-years.

655
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,601
Yes, she was at the right age.

656
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:51,641
But

657
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:57,761
nothing happened, Kaali Peeli.
Nothing.

658
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:00,521
This is a shock.
A shock!

659
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:06,481
That is love..

660
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:09,641
My mom's death

661
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:12,521
marked a new beginning.

662
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:14,641
A knock was heard on the door.

663
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,521
But it was soft.

664
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:24,361
It was my duty
to welcome the gorgeous girl.

665
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,961
My brother.
My younger brother

666
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,041
was not in the house.

667
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:34,081
We had a face to face meeting.

668
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,321
I was feeling shy.

669
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,601
When a man feels shy,
he should take a bath.

670
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:43,441
I learnt it in the monastery.

671
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,601
We were on our way
to the sacred place.

672
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:51,641
After a quick bath

673
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:56,801
she came out in a towel with her
body still steaming. I saw her.

674
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,641
There was a stool.
A skirt was on top of it.

675
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:05,241
So was a jumper.
Mrs. Tangal.

676
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:07,881
The door was closed.

677
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,361
My mom's garlanded photo
had a smile on it.

678
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:14,521
It was as if she permitted me.

679
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:19,081
The effect of steam
was uncontrollable.

680
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:25,161
I had to give in to my temptations.

681
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,921
Inevitable.

682
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,041
I'll become shy at this point.

683
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,801
All right?
- All right.

684
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,481
After it was done

685
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:54,081
I whispered a question in her ear.

686
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:56,761
I asked her what her name was.

687
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,881
She had tears in her eyes.

688
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,481
Why did that happen,
Kaali Peeli?

689
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:06,561
Why did that happen?

690
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:10,321
Ask me why it happened..
- Why did that happen?

691
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:13,321
She was deaf and dumb.

692
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,161
Her speaker and microphone
were not working.

693
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,721
It was very quiet.

694
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,041
With tears

695
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:23,161
a Kannada word came from her lips.

696
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:28,081
Flower.

697
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:32,601
If a flower blossomed there,
love blossomed here.

698
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,241
I fell in love.

699
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:39,641
After that

700
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:44,321
the fragrance of jasmine..
It was a feast of chicken soup.

701
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:49,481
It was difficult to differentiate
between the day and the night.

702
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,441
It was a period of transition.

703
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:55,041
My younger brother
went to live separately.

704
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:57,201
I paid the rent myself.

705
00:48:58,241 --> 00:48:59,721
Our privacy was more important.

706
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:00,841
That is nothing but fondness.

707
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:06,281
As time passed on,
our love grew stronger

708
00:49:06,681 --> 00:49:09,961
and the girl got pregnant
and puked as a result of it.

709
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,721
She was three months pregnant.

710
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:15,041
The moment
the lady doctor said that.

711
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,521
The moment I realised I was a dad.

712
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:19,561
The moment
my love became successful.

713
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:22,721
All this..

714
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:29,961
After nine months and nine days

715
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:32,961
it was a normal delivery.
A normal delivery.

716
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,441
A normal delivery.

717
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:39,401
Kaali Peeli, when the nurse
went to wash the baby

718
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:43,601
I went crazy, snatched the baby
and licked it like a dog.

719
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:45,161
He had jaundice.

720
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,841
They put him
in an incubator which had a bulb.

721
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:50,001
He looked fair.

722
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,521
They said he had jaundice.

723
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:58,481
This evening, he'll get discharged.

724
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:04,161
What's the time?

725
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:09,281
If I can host a TV programme

726
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:14,441
and if my husband bags
a government contract

727
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:16,801
it will be helpful.

728
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:20,521
What should we do
to make it a reality?

729
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:22,881
Tell me.
We'll do it.

730
00:50:23,841 --> 00:50:24,761
New world.

731
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:27,361
"Come on.."

732
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:32,841
Please come..

733
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,641
Hey, do you know who we are?
- I don't, sir.

734
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:44,201
Hey, I'll chop your tongue off
and use it to construct a building.

735
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:46,161
I'm a real estate king..

736
00:50:46,561 --> 00:50:48,161
I'm the king.

737
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:53,441
Here.
Now, salute me.

738
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:56,361
Come on, guys.

739
00:50:58,241 --> 00:50:59,721
Ask me..
I'll give you.

740
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,921
I'll only give the cheapest
and the best to you.

741
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:03,801
All right. Come..

742
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,161
I'll only give the cheapest
and the best to you. All right?

743
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:10,121
He wants the cheapest
and the best..

744
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:13,521
Which fool invented that phrase?

745
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:14,921
Give me the cheapest and the best.

746
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:17,761
Take the cheapest
and the best. Bloody fools!

747
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:20,641
Sorry, buddy.

748
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:25,441
This is a family restaurant.
A public place.

749
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:28,721
A place to mind your tongue.

750
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:31,081
Pay attention.
Note it down.

751
00:51:31,601 --> 00:51:35,521
You won't find anything
that is the cheapest and the best.

752
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:39,841
Hey, Seena, come here.
- Yes, sir.

753
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,081
I'm at your service.
- The boss is very happy today.

754
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,321
Guess who?
- Who, my boss?

755
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,641
No, it's me.

756
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:54,441
Keep this.

757
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,401
I'm tipping you Rs. 100.

758
00:51:57,721 --> 00:51:58,761
Come here.

759
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:01,401
Get me a drink
which is the cheapest and the best.

760
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:02,761
Okay.
All right.

761
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,401
That's nothing.
Just forget it.

762
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,361
How many times in a day
will you call?

763
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:12,761
I love you.

764
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:15,841
I've come to understand that you
only love me through the phone.

765
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:17,961
No, darling.
I really love you.

766
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:21,041
That is enough. It's been three
years since we got married.

767
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:22,961
Which other husband
would wait this long?

768
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:24,641
If my parents
come to know about it..

769
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:26,561
How will they know about
what goes on in our bedroom?

770
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:27,881
Please don't be upset.

771
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,281
It's not that I don't love you.

772
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,841
But you shouldn't be known
as the son-in-law of the ex-CM.

773
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:34,961
The ex-CM should be known
as your father-in-law.

774
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:36,561
Then we can..

775
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:39,321
If that's the case,
I'll die a virgin.

776
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,601
Your father is not
my father-in-law but my misery.

777
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:56,321
Live as a beggar but don't marry
into a matriarchal family.

778
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:57,321
All right, boss.

779
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,081
Are you going to ask questions
or should I tell you about myself?

780
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:02,001
Shall I teach you questions
that everyone ask?

781
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:03,281
First question.

782
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:07,041
You look so gorgeous.
What made you opt for this field?

783
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:09,961
Second question.
What's your real name?

784
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:13,201
Third question..
Forget it. Do one thing.

785
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:18,361
Oh, God! You're the boss,
not the worker.

786
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,201
Okay, I'll ask you a question,
then you have a go.

787
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:26,121
You agree to everything.

788
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,001
You're a fool and you're naive.

789
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:33,041
Okay, did your wife pass away
a long time ago?

790
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:38,201
Yes, it's been twenty years.

791
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:39,841
Now, you can ask your question.

792
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:44,161
You look gorgeous.

793
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:48,721
My boss complimented me
on my looks.

794
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:57,121
What are you doing in this field?

795
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:58,961
Didn't Mr. Ramesh tell you?
- No.

796
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:02,321
We have a long miserable story.

797
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:04,361
We don't have land
in our native place.

798
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:05,641
We don't have a house.

799
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:07,361
My dad didn't go to work.

800
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:09,481
He fathered six children
in ten years

801
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:10,801
and died of exhaustion.

802
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:13,161
All six are girls.
And my mother is sick.

803
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:16,201
I am the only beautiful one,
among the six girls.

804
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:22,641
God sent me here like it was
a gift for being beautiful.

805
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:25,401
But I'm fine.
I have no problems.

806
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:27,041
Don't worry, be happy.

807
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:30,121
I can send money home,
as long as people like you exist.

808
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:31,881
They'll be happy, and so will I.

809
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:33,441
Don't worry, be happy.

810
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:37,961
I heard you've remained a celibate
ever since your wife died.

811
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:39,201
Mr. Ramesh told me this.

812
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:43,401
Is this your first time?
- Yes.

813
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,761
You're naive and are a fool.
You've been a celibate for so long.

814
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,521
All right..
Go on.

815
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:55,801
I'm the only son.
- The luminary of the dynasty.

816
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:59,201
Rs. 1,000 crores won't get wasted.
Don't worry.

817
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:01,441
It's like the families
they show in movies.

818
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,441
Rich people with only one son.
This is just like that.

819
00:55:05,321 --> 00:55:06,401
Do you watch films?

820
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:08,041
I watch a lot of films.

821
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,841
Our lives are a lot
like night guards.

822
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:12,841
The night belongs to others

823
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:13,921
but the day is ours.

824
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:16,241
I watch films in daytime.

825
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:21,161
Kaali Peeli, it's hot.

826
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:26,761
What's the use of two men
worrying about something?

827
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:29,801
What's that smell?

828
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,361
I caught the scent of a woman.

829
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:35,121
Where is it coming from?

830
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:43,521
I welcome the eternal beauty.

831
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:51,521
You're like a monsoon shower
during the drought in a man's life.

832
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:55,201
A hungry dog

833
00:55:56,801 --> 00:56:00,081
when finds a morsel of food..
My queen..

834
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:01,201
Stop.

835
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:04,841
What is this?

836
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:08,401
It is dust.
A lack of civility.

837
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,921
Why isn't India clean?

838
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:16,121
Forgive me. Please come in.
Where is the broom?

839
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:19,841
Stop.
- Why?

840
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:20,921
There is no water.

841
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:22,521
We have water issues.

842
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,681
The pot..

843
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:28,921
It's our duty.

844
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:31,761
Give me the bag.
- Take it.

845
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,241
That's a lot of water

846
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:36,801
May you attain
success and glory.

847
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,481
I don't understand Kannada.

848
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,201
Talk to me in English, you fool.
Move aside.

849
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:43,361
Come here.

850
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,121
Oh, God!

851
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:22,001
Oh, dear woman.

852
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:27,121
A lot of items used by women that
can't be and shouldn't be told.

853
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,441
Hey, Kaali Peeli,
did you have lunch?

854
00:57:34,521 --> 00:57:35,481
No, I'm on a diet.

855
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:37,601
Hey, give me back my bag.

856
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,961
Sorry for taking the bag.

857
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,721
I have seen nothing.

858
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,841
If you say you haven't,
it means you have.

859
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:47,601
If I kick you..

860
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:48,961
A massage from the leg

861
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,161
and that too from a woman.

862
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:54,081
Definitely.
I am all for it. Go ahead.

863
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,601
Is it? - Yes.

864
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:57,441
Is it? - Yes.

865
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,601
Is it? - Yes.

866
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,041
What's the secret
behind this tenderness?

867
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:08,921
She is a beautiful creation
from top to bottom.

868
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:12,921
Do you know him?

869
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:17,721
I've seen plenty
of people like him.

870
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,281
He was after me.

871
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:24,161
But I didn't fall for him.

872
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,001
He's seeing a house maid now.

873
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:30,721
Is she still with you, Tippi?

874
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:34,321
Why do you talk so sensitively
when I'm fiery?

875
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:38,281
Forgive me for forgetting
my manners for a moment.

876
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:42,681
Do you even have morals, Tippi?
- I do.

877
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:44,601
I have a flower.

878
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:49,321
No beauty can be
compared to that flower.

879
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,281
She's a beauty, but like dirt.

880
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:53,241
It's a waste.
Sit down.

881
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:55,041
Sit down.

882
00:58:57,841 --> 00:59:00,441
Kaali Peeli..

883
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:04,401
You're a former military man,
a brigadier.

884
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:07,521
You've seen bravery and courage.

885
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:10,601
But haven't seen beauty.
Why is that?

886
00:59:10,761 --> 00:59:12,921
Why are you delaying

887
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,281
when there is a solution
to your stress, right next to you?

888
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:20,121
Don't go against
the wishes of nature.

889
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:24,001
She is frivolous,
and you're a mess.

890
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:27,841
I will lead your union.

891
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,321
I give my word.

892
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:30,481
What did you say..

893
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:31,481
What did he say?

894
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:36,241
I have no clue.
You leave.

895
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,721
You're mentally unstable
because you got hit by a bullet.

896
00:59:40,721 --> 00:59:42,241
This fool was born so.

897
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,281
I'm leaving.

898
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:47,601
I won't talk to useless people.

899
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:50,241
Don't associate yourself with him,
Kaali Peeli.

900
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:51,841
He's crazy.

901
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:58,881
She's either Hasthini, Chitrini,
Padmini, Shankini or Dhakini.

902
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,001
One should think about it clearly.

903
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:15,161
I wanted to tell you something.
- Go on.

904
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:19,081
Actually, I can't say it in
the presence of your husband.

905
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,321
It's all right.
Go ahead, sir.

906
01:00:20,521 --> 01:00:23,321
I'm selectively blind and deaf.
Selectively witty too.

907
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:29,521
That channel head
is a little romantic.

908
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:31,761
Just like me.

909
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:33,641
Move it..

910
01:00:35,441 --> 01:00:36,321
Stop.

911
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,321
Two arrows in a single fruit.

912
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:43,321
What next?

913
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:47,761
Our lady is just terrific.
She asks what's next.

914
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:50,841
She's self-sufficient.
Basically, she's independent.

915
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:54,321
She doesn't need God's help.
Will she require us?

916
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:56,041
Let's move.

917
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:04,001
You should fill
this diary with poems

918
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:07,601
and dedicate it to me saying,
'To my sweet Priya'. Okay?

919
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:10,961
Okay.

920
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:20,361
Kaali Peeli!

921
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:22,241
Should we get married
after we have kids

922
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:24,921
or have kids after marriage?
This is an important question.

923
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,041
Reply only if you know the answer.

924
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:28,361
If not,
I'll break your skull into pieces

925
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,441
like it happens in the fable
of Vikram and Betal.

926
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:33,321
Look, someone's there.
Answer them before he zips up.

927
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:34,401
He'll give the right answer.

928
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:35,601
Who goes there?

929
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:42,641
His head is facing
a shortage of hair.

930
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:46,601
Is it just the head
or the whole body?

931
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:48,761
I'm clean all over.
There's no doubt about it.

932
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:50,641
By the way, who are you?
- Who am I!

933
01:01:52,081 --> 01:01:56,321
What the hell is this?
- Isn't this an insult?

934
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:57,241
Am I not popular?

935
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:02,201
Listen, he can give you
an account of the past

936
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:04,841
and predict the future
very accurately.

937
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,361
He's a very respectable man.
He's learned.

938
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:08,921
Don't talk to him by placing
your hand over his head.

939
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:09,881
Take your hand off.

940
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:14,081
Hey..

941
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,081
What are you doing?

942
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:31,921
Greetings.
What do you want?

943
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:34,881
What do you need to predict?
The hand, the tongue

944
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:36,721
or the teeth or the back?

945
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:38,841
I don't require all that.

946
01:02:39,281 --> 01:02:40,081
I've brought you all this.

947
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:43,401
What do I do with insects?
I don't need them.

948
01:02:43,481 --> 01:02:45,641
Why not!

949
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:48,001
I require only the eyes.

950
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:51,561
The eyes. Do you read eyes?
- Yes.

951
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:55,841
Come on.
Let me take a look at your eyes.

952
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:58,081
You can close your mouth, sir.

953
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:11,881
Your grandfather's name
is Muni Venkata Swamy.

954
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,201
Your dad is Rangaswamy.

955
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:16,641
You're Tippe Swamy.

956
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:32,481
I'm impressed. Go on.
- Ask me what you want to know.

957
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:36,041
Can you tell me about all the
relationships I've had with women?

958
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:37,761
That's a bit hard, sir.

959
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:40,641
Because none of them
are your wives.

960
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:50,841
That is true..
- Isn't it?

961
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,561
Let me take a look at your eyes.

962
01:03:55,681 --> 01:03:59,001
Your baby boy was born today.

963
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:10,321
Master..

964
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:13,681
Hey, agent.
He is the father of the baby.

965
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:15,281
He wants to marry
the baby's mother.

966
01:04:15,361 --> 01:04:16,521
Suggest an auspicious time
for the wedding.

967
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:18,321
And get him one or two
insurance policies.

968
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,201
I can't help you with that.

969
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:24,481
I can't get him an insurance,
nor can I get him married.

970
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,761
Why not..
- Let me take a look.

971
01:04:29,921 --> 01:04:34,321
Tonight, around 12 p.m.

972
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:36,961
you'll die.

973
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:42,561
Death?
- Yes.

974
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:47,521
The end.
Demise.

975
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:50,681
Yes. - Will I die?
- Yes, you will.

976
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:52,881
Do I have a bad time?
- Yes.

977
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,361
You bugger, get up.

978
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:00,601
Get up..

979
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:07,121
If I place my gun here and shoot,
you'll die.

980
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:10,841
Stay quiet.
Don't breathe.

981
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:14,441
Get out! - I mean..
- I said get lost. Shut up.

982
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,361
All right..
- Out.

983
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:18,321
Get lost.
- Don't push..

984
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,201
Kaali Peeli.

985
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,361
Hey..

986
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:36,841
Kaali Peeli.

987
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:41,481
Will his words come true?

988
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:45,001
I'm getting scared.

989
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:48,001
W-Who'll kill me?
Will you kill me?

990
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:52,081
I think your son will kill you.

991
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:56,041
You killed your dad,
so your son will kill you.

992
01:05:56,121 --> 01:05:57,521
Your family has a long
tradition of contract killing.

993
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:01,481
No.

994
01:06:02,281 --> 01:06:03,841
Didn't fifteen people die
after having toddy?

995
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,321
I've been hired by their side.

996
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:11,041
I'm a killer.
I shouldn't be killed..

997
01:06:15,081 --> 01:06:16,481
It's a mistake..

998
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,161
Fifteen people.
Toddy. Murder.

999
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:21,361
Forget it..

1000
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:23,521
I did not say it
and you did not hear it.

1001
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,601
I must live.
I'm a father.

1002
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:43,481
A husband who isn't married
to a deaf and dumb girl.

1003
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,921
I must live.
It's a silent agony.

1004
01:06:47,641 --> 01:06:48,801
It's hot.

1005
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:52,241
Fan..

1006
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:54,801
I must become a family man.

1007
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:58,401
I want to go through the rituals
of a Hindu marriage.

1008
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,121
I must have them..

1009
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:02,201
My son should study well.
He shouldn't become like me.

1010
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:03,921
I've not taken the right path.
Damn it!

1011
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:06,481
My behaviour was wrong.
But I'll rectify it.

1012
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:12,721
My last crime.
The last murder.

1013
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,121
Gun.

1014
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:23,641
What's the time?
Please.

1015
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:27,201
Time.

1016
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:52,561
Seenu, this isn't your fault.

1017
01:07:53,161 --> 01:07:54,361
Forget all this.

1018
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:56,561
Let's carry on with our lives.

1019
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:59,041
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

1020
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,881
I exist only for..

1021
01:08:10,441 --> 01:08:13,681
Yes, come here.
I have the papers with me.

1022
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:16,321
The party is from America..

1023
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,401
Come here.
I'll get it for you.

1024
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,841
It is a miracle.

1025
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:28,761
Lord Sai Baba, save me.

1026
01:08:29,321 --> 01:08:32,281
Goddess, where are you?

1027
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:36,441
You didn't leave my side.
You saved me!

1028
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:39,841
Give me the microphone.

1029
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:43,081
Ladies and gentlemen.

1030
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:45,921
This is our night of celebration.

1031
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:49,401
We struck a deal
worth Rs. 100 crores.

1032
01:08:50,441 --> 01:08:54,601
During this time of celebration

1033
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,521
we would like to serve
drinks to everyone.

1034
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:02,121
You may eat and drink
what you like.

1035
01:09:02,321 --> 01:09:03,561
The bill is on us.

1036
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:06,681
A round of applause, please.

1037
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:09,921
Thank you..

1038
01:09:16,721 --> 01:09:20,641
Today,
we have Ms. Kasturi with us.

1039
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:23,401
Also, we have offerings
of Gudisalumane Arasu.

1040
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:25,921
On behalf of everyone,
I request

1041
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:31,121
Ms. Kasturi to sing a song.

1042
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:32,801
Thank you.

1043
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:55,521
"The health is important.."

1044
01:09:55,761 --> 01:09:58,201
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1045
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,881
"The health is important.."

1046
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:03,521
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1047
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:06,241
"Do not forget to eat your
meals every day on time."

1048
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,721
"Sleep early and wake up early."

1049
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:11,441
"The health is important."

1050
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:16,641
"Pick up the toothbrush
and brush until you fall asleep."

1051
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:19,281
"The health is important."

1052
01:10:19,361 --> 01:10:22,001
"Drink coffee and sit back."

1053
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:27,161
"Everything belongs to you.
So, relax.."

1054
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,801
"The health is important."

1055
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:35,041
"Go for a jog on the road.
If not, take a walk."

1056
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:37,601
"Buy a towel which has no odour."

1057
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:40,321
"Take a shower before
your wife can scold you."

1058
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:42,921
"The health is important."

1059
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:45,561
"Wear clothes keeping
your fat in mind."

1060
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,161
"Have breakfast
while pampering your kids."

1061
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:50,681
"You work for food
and a piece of cloth."

1062
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:53,201
"Believe in an ideology
and work towards it."

1063
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,121
"The health is important."

1064
01:10:56,201 --> 01:11:01,041
"When we are right,
the world seems right."

1065
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:05,721
"When you live lavishly,
you have a pot belly."

1066
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:09,201
"The health is important.."

1067
01:11:09,401 --> 01:11:11,881
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1068
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:14,441
"The health is important.."

1069
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:17,041
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1070
01:11:43,401 --> 01:11:48,521
"What is health?
- I have no idea. Please go away!"

1071
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:53,881
"My friend, Nagappa, was fine,
but passed away all of a sudden."

1072
01:11:53,961 --> 01:11:58,241
"Doctors say, bad habits
bring various diseases."

1073
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:03,321
"A man here says, people die soon
if they have no bad habits."

1074
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:03,321
"A man here says, people die soon
if they have no bad habits."

1075
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:09,761
"We cannot write,
'Health is wealth' on a bar door."

1076
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:14,961
"One cannot forget the way
to a bar when he's in self-denial."

1077
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:20,001
"The neighbouring village.."

1078
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:22,761
"The kids in the neighbouring
village are sick."

1079
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,521
"And the doctor
in our village is sick too."

1080
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:30,521
"No one can tell
the root cause of a disease."

1081
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:35,561
"From birth to death.."

1082
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:41,281
"From birth to death.."

1083
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:43,921
"All that is important is health."

1084
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:51,761
"How hard is it to maintain the
body that God has blessed us with?"

1085
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:56,641
"Live happily, no matter what."

1086
01:12:56,801 --> 01:13:02,201
"Live happily, no matter what."

1087
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:04,721
"The health is important.."

1088
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:07,401
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1089
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:10,001
"The health is important.."

1090
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:12,921
"Everyone, take
a look at your stomach."

1091
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:20,081
The health is important..

1092
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:25,441
God! The sort of people that exist
on this planet! It's unbelievable.

1093
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:29,121
Sir, in our world,
we have unlimited fun.

1094
01:13:29,641 --> 01:13:30,761
Come upstairs and check it out.

1095
01:13:31,361 --> 01:13:34,521
You see half the world here,
the other half on top.

1096
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:44,081
Charlie!
"Do what you will, live happily."

1097
01:13:45,081 --> 01:13:46,561
I'm unable to live happily.

1098
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:50,281
Hey, what's wrong?

1099
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:54,121
Actually,
I shouldn't have come to the party.

1100
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:55,721
I shouldn't have come
to the party.

1101
01:13:56,001 --> 01:13:57,281
I shouldn't have danced.

1102
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:00,441
I'm feeling very guilty today.

1103
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:03,361
It's been two months
since I lost my job.

1104
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:05,361
I haven't told anyone about it.

1105
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:10,281
I wanted to tell everyone
that I got a new job.

1106
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:11,881
I tried a lot.

1107
01:14:12,721 --> 01:14:14,161
I didn't find a job anywhere.

1108
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,641
In all likelihood, mom must have
found out about it by now.

1109
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:22,441
Poor mother.

1110
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,721
She's not broaching the topic.

1111
01:14:30,081 --> 01:14:34,001
Fearing that I might feel bad

1112
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:36,481
if she asks if I need money,
when I go out

1113
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:40,041
she asks me if I need change
and gives me money.

1114
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:47,201
When I had a job
which paid a handsome salary

1115
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:50,521
I behaved very rudely
with my parents.

1116
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,481
Now, I can't face anyone.

1117
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:08,281
Are you done with your story?

1118
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,881
Go straight, take a left
and then take a right.

1119
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:11,801
You'll find the washroom.

1120
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:13,401
The person whom you find
there is the cause

1121
01:15:13,561 --> 01:15:16,041
for your present situation.
Give him an earful!

1122
01:15:16,401 --> 01:15:17,481
Everything will be sorted.

1123
01:15:19,921 --> 01:15:22,881
By the way, were you
eavesdropping on us till now?

1124
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,961
Oh, no!
The tables have ears too.

1125
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:28,641
You may leave, sir.

1126
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:45,481
'The person whom you find
there is the cause'

1127
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:48,041
'of your present situation.
Give him an earful!'

1128
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:49,201
'Everything will be sorted.'

1129
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,121
Look here.

1130
01:15:57,681 --> 01:15:58,841
Look into my eyes.

1131
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:01,161
You can't, can you?

1132
01:16:03,121 --> 01:16:06,201
You're ashamed..

1133
01:16:06,481 --> 01:16:09,761
Shall I tell you something? Today's
like the day of your final exam.

1134
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:12,841
Pass or fail..
Let it be decided today.

1135
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:14,481
Put it outside!

1136
01:16:15,681 --> 01:16:18,121
I'll tell you whether
you're saying the truth or lying.

1137
01:16:18,321 --> 01:16:21,841
I'll tell you whether you're
human or a worthless creature.

1138
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:24,841
I'll cry and pour my emotions out!

1139
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:39,561
I didn't take good care
of my parents!

1140
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:44,001
I've lied a lot!

1141
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:51,721
I've cheated more than what was
required to lead a good life.

1142
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:58,001
I'm not a good person..

1143
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:11,481
I'll become a better person..

1144
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:15,241
I'll become a better person.
- Okay?

1145
01:17:17,441 --> 01:17:19,041
We can cross many hurdles
like this and sleep peacefully

1146
01:17:19,361 --> 01:17:24,401
if the two of us are together.

1147
01:17:25,201 --> 01:17:28,121
You'll be ruined if you let me go.

1148
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:32,161
I'll die if you let me go.

1149
01:17:42,281 --> 01:17:45,121
The man in the mirror
is a very good person.

1150
01:17:45,721 --> 01:17:47,201
You should just listen to him.

1151
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:49,281
Thank you, Seenu!

1152
01:17:55,641 --> 01:17:57,001
Have you ever sat inside
a restroom?

1153
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:59,481
Come and sit. It'll be nice.

1154
01:18:01,441 --> 01:18:02,761
Shall I tell you one thing,
mister?

1155
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,441
The fact that one can't
find a job is a lie.

1156
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:09,641
It's a different matter,
when one's choosy about a job.

1157
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:11,481
There was a guy in our town
named Chikanna.

1158
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:14,561
For some reason,
he had finished his MA and MEd

1159
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:15,761
but he was roaming around
without employment.

1160
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:18,201
His argument was that
he was very well educated

1161
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,721
and wanted the post
of a Headmaster.

1162
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,241
He was angry with
all the townsfolk.

1163
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:23,761
He has never worked as a teacher

1164
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:25,121
but wanted the post
of a headmaster.

1165
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,081
So..

1166
01:18:27,601 --> 01:18:30,521
He wouldn't go to another town
and he wouldn't work in our town.

1167
01:18:31,121 --> 01:18:33,921
These guys were a challenge
to God!

1168
01:18:36,521 --> 01:18:37,441
I understood.

1169
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:41,761
In our world,
a waiter's job is vacant.

1170
01:18:42,841 --> 01:18:43,681
I'll do it.

1171
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,081
I was kidding.

1172
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,721
You'll find a good job really soon.

1173
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:51,001
Don't worry.

1174
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,601
By the way, your chilled beer
is getting warm. Come.

1175
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:56,321
Thank you.

1176
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:13,921
Kaali Peeli!

1177
01:19:14,201 --> 01:19:16,921
You've a wind machine! A fan.

1178
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:21,881
It couldn't be repaired.
You're a waste..

1179
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,561
Sir?
- Who is that?

1180
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:28,161
I need to speak to you urgently.

1181
01:19:28,361 --> 01:19:29,201
Urgent..

1182
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:33,401
The consequences will be bad
if women are impatient!

1183
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:35,281
Whom do you want to speak to?

1184
01:19:35,401 --> 01:19:36,521
Mr. Kaali Peeli.

1185
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:38,921
'Mr. Kaali Peeli.'

1186
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:41,881
Can I get up and go or will you
put a gun to my head?

1187
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:44,401
There's no value for cruelty
in friendship.

1188
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:50,081
One and a half minutes is a very
big deal in the present-day.

1189
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:51,361
You..

1190
01:19:52,961 --> 01:19:54,721
One and a half minutes.
- Hold this.

1191
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:07,401
You know that I like Seenu,
don't you, sir?

1192
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:09,401
I know.
Tell me quickly.

1193
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:12,121
Why're you silent
if you know about it?

1194
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:15,561
I like him! I want to go
to Kanyakumari with him.

1195
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:17,841
We've to be alone
and look after our own lives.

1196
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:19,401
You must send him with me.

1197
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:22,641
You must never force love.

1198
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:25,521
You must earn it.
- Time out!

1199
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:31,321
What am I supposed to do now?

1200
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:35,161
Go and sit upstairs.
- Time out, Kaali Peeli!

1201
01:20:36,681 --> 01:20:38,601
Will you go quietly
or should I thrash you?

1202
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:39,521
Out.

1203
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:40,761
Out!

1204
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,561
Why, Kaali Peeli?

1205
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:50,561
Why, Kaali Peeli?
Why is the fan..

1206
01:20:51,361 --> 01:20:52,281
Why?

1207
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,081
You're neither letting me move
around nor go anywhere, Tippi.

1208
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:59,201
Have you been possessed?
- Possessed?

1209
01:21:00,161 --> 01:21:02,961
It's also like that.
This is like this and that is that.

1210
01:21:04,761 --> 01:21:08,241
Our friendship will last
till the day a bullet is fired

1211
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:11,641
at midnight, 12 o'clock
and the bar runs dry.

1212
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:14,001
Now,
can I go alone to the toilet

1213
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:15,881
or will you follow me
in the name of friendship?

1214
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:19,321
I've no part in any
kind of excretion.

1215
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:22,001
May you have victory.
You can go.

1216
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,081
What is that noise?

1217
01:21:32,361 --> 01:21:33,761
Water, Tippi.

1218
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:38,161
Please forgive me for my suspicion.
It's a birth trait.

1219
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:39,401
Forgive me.

1220
01:21:45,881 --> 01:21:47,601
I have messaged the account number.

1221
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,681
Transfer the rest of the money.

1222
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:51,441
Call me later.

1223
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:57,481
Hey!

1224
01:22:45,441 --> 01:22:47,281
Hey, Mr. Kaali Peeli..

1225
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:06,641
Military hands are really strong.

1226
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,641
Strong, Kaali Peeli.

1227
01:23:09,921 --> 01:23:14,001
This is very dangerous..

1228
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:21,801
I've tied you up. You'll die
if you try to come forward.

1229
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:25,321
Brigadier! Kaali Peeli!

1230
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:27,201
Will you go to the police?

1231
01:23:27,481 --> 01:23:29,361
Don't do that!

1232
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,441
The 15 people who died after
drinking counterfeit liquor..

1233
01:23:36,361 --> 01:23:40,681
Their family gave me
the contract to kill.

1234
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:43,601
Parents cry when
their children die.

1235
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:47,081
This is the contract
given to wipe away..

1236
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:49,481
This is the contract given
to wipe away their tears!

1237
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:52,281
The contractor had come here.
You've come to kill him.

1238
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,201
Damn it, no!

1239
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:58,121
Not him. It's Srinivasa,
the contractor's son.

1240
01:24:00,921 --> 01:24:02,001
Seena?

1241
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:06,161
Your son. The supplier
and the fair guy, Bar Seena.

1242
01:24:09,481 --> 01:24:12,321
The father was the one
who killed people

1243
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:13,961
by selling counterfeit liquor.
Why should the son die?

1244
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,881
Principle is different
from reasoning.

1245
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:22,081
The father will attain salvation
if we kill him. A peaceful death.

1246
01:24:22,561 --> 01:24:27,521
The father will suffer for the rest
of his life if we kill his son.

1247
01:24:27,681 --> 01:24:29,361
That's the point
of a contract to kill.

1248
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:31,641
The father must suffer!

1249
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:33,641
Hey, Kaali Peeli!

1250
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:45,521
'Rajeev thinks that good
will happen to everyone'

1251
01:24:45,601 --> 01:24:46,961
'on Success Day.'

1252
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:50,841
'But he doesn't know that death
is knocking on his door.'

1253
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,521
This is the final homage
of the 'Auto' poet.

1254
01:25:02,841 --> 01:25:05,481
From Ravi..

1255
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:10,161
...to Priya,
the girl who cheated him.

1256
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:12,561
Seena always asks me

1257
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:16,441
to tell my life
story in four lines.

1258
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:22,561
My life got over in four lines.

1259
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:27,201
Now, I've made a habit
of stopping at one line.

1260
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:29,841
There was an 'Auto' poet.

1261
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:33,201
A beautiful song for love.

1262
01:25:34,521 --> 01:25:37,441
Love isn't forced.
It grows and blossoms.

1263
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,081
It is born somewhere
and dies somewhere else.

1264
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:44,121
A beautiful celebration
for its birth.

1265
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:48,401
A beautiful song for death.

1266
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:53,521
"When you lose your way
and find me somewhere else again!"

1267
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:59,081
"Don't ask me about how I've been!"

1268
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:04,281
"Don't ask me about how I've been!"

1269
01:26:04,561 --> 01:26:09,761
"When all the words of my heart
are evident in my eyes!"

1270
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:15,001
"Don't ask me what happened!"

1271
01:26:15,601 --> 01:26:20,521
"My life became an existence
devoid of colours!"

1272
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:25,841
"Why did you get lost
in your silent poetry?"

1273
01:26:25,921 --> 01:26:31,081
"There's no share for you
in the pain which you gave me!"

1274
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:36,361
"When you lose your way
and find me somewhere else again!"

1275
01:26:36,601 --> 01:26:41,801
"Don't ask me about how I've been!"

1276
01:27:04,081 --> 01:27:08,841
"It seems like the account
has been settled!"

1277
01:27:09,241 --> 01:27:14,041
"I've some kind of uneasiness!"

1278
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:19,441
"Enough..
Enough of your zest for love!"

1279
01:27:19,961 --> 01:27:24,441
"All that's left
in my heart is pain!"

1280
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:29,641
"I've lost my senses
and I've lost my path!"

1281
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:35,401
"What's the point of living
without love?"

1282
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:41,921
"My heart will not lose
to such pressure ever again!"

1283
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:48,481
"When you lose your way
and find me somewhere else again!"

1284
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:53,921
"Don't ask me about how I've been!"

1285
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:02,801
Don't do that, sir!
I've put all my money in it!

1286
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:02,801
Don't do that, sir!
I've put all my money in it!

1287
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:14,401
I haven't put a rupee or two!
I've put five crores!

1288
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:19,401
No one will give even
ten rupees if I sell myself!

1289
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:25,721
Hello..

1290
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:30,001
Hey, that guy disconnected
the call! Say something!

1291
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:36,201
I've lost respect and reputation!

1292
01:28:38,401 --> 01:28:40,921
Collect the bill
from that dark guy.

1293
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:44,321
Make him wash the dishes,
if he doesn't pay.

1294
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:45,241
Come, guys.

1295
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:49,161
Save me, Lord!

1296
01:28:50,761 --> 01:28:53,041
I've lost all my money!

1297
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:56,241
I've lost all my money!

1298
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:02,361
A hut.

1299
01:29:03,161 --> 01:29:04,481
That's why people say that

1300
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:10,081
we shouldn't count our chickens
before they've hatched.

1301
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:14,721
I forgot, Shiva!

1302
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:25,281
Ladies and gentlemen!

1303
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:27,721
Our deal has been cancelled!

1304
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:32,441
You must pay the bill
for what you ate and drank.

1305
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:36,161
Forgive me..

1306
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:37,881
I'll leave.

1307
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:51,601
Why do you need all this?

1308
01:29:56,201 --> 01:29:57,241
Sir, good night.

1309
01:29:58,561 --> 01:29:59,561
Good night, sir.

1310
01:30:00,681 --> 01:30:04,241
'I would've become God if
I could've done good to everyone.'

1311
01:30:04,401 --> 01:30:06,481
'Better luck next time,
Mr. Arasu.'

1312
01:30:31,161 --> 01:30:33,481
The song which you sang
about love was very nice.

1313
01:30:34,241 --> 01:30:35,401
Mr. Auto poet.

1314
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:38,921
You fell in love with her,
got drunk, wrote a song about her

1315
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:42,281
and thought that you'll die.
But you're not dying.

1316
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:46,121
You've decided to die anyway.

1317
01:30:46,561 --> 01:30:48,441
Get up.
Today's the day of your death.

1318
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:50,441
Climb to the roof,
jump from there and die.

1319
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:55,681
Upstairs doesn't mean the second
floor. Go to the terrace.

1320
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,761
I won't ask about how you've been.

1321
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:55,641
I've lived four years
of my life hating you.

1322
01:31:57,321 --> 01:31:59,161
I wanted to kill you if we
ever came face to face.

1323
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:03,201
But you know that I'll melt
if we meet face to face.

1324
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:03,201
But you know that I'll melt
if we meet face to face.

1325
01:32:03,841 --> 01:32:05,161
Why did you do such a thing?

1326
01:32:06,241 --> 01:32:07,321
Women..

1327
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:11,201
...have very few choices in life.

1328
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:13,441
What would you do
if you were a woman

1329
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:17,921
and you had to choose between your
parents and the guy whom you loved?

1330
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:18,921
The guy whom I loved.

1331
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:29,481
No. My parents.

1332
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:34,321
There is one thing
that saddens me..

1333
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:36,681
I would've taken the responsibility
and got you married

1334
01:32:36,721 --> 01:32:38,761
if you had just told me.

1335
01:32:38,841 --> 01:32:41,401
I know that you've a big heart.

1336
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:43,281
I don't have such a big heart.

1337
01:32:43,881 --> 01:32:47,801
I wouldn't have gone back home
if I had seen you once more.

1338
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:51,921
My parents told that they'll commit
suicide if I don't get married.

1339
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:54,161
I thought that it was
better to let go

1340
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:55,761
since I felt that there was
no value for our love.

1341
01:32:58,921 --> 01:33:01,481
How's your husband?
Does he take good care of you?

1342
01:33:01,721 --> 01:33:04,601
He takes really good care of me.
A great person.

1343
01:33:05,801 --> 01:33:09,921
I don't know whether I should
feel sad or happy about this.

1344
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:18,161
One more thing.

1345
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:22,081
I was able to do one thing.
I've done it.

1346
01:33:22,161 --> 01:33:24,481
Not for you though. I've done it
for myself.

1347
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:28,641
I've named my child after you.

1348
01:33:36,321 --> 01:33:39,081
That's enough in this lifetime.
Be happy.

1349
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:41,881
Ravi.

1350
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:47,801
I don't have the right to tell you.
Can I make a request?

1351
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:51,321
Will you quit drinking for me?

1352
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:54,921
I'm quitting this life itself.

1353
01:34:03,241 --> 01:34:04,361
One last time.

1354
01:34:04,921 --> 01:34:05,801
One final time.

1355
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:14,921
I'll bring it.

1356
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:06,121
Kaali Peeli.

1357
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:08,281
This..

1358
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:12,281
...can turn anyone into
a poet if you tie them up.

1359
01:35:13,081 --> 01:35:17,081
Now, the verses which
I learnt at the mutt.

1360
01:35:25,081 --> 01:35:28,081
Kaali Peeli..
Hey, Kaali Peeli..

1361
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:35,561
I've tied a cable
because I know you.

1362
01:35:35,881 --> 01:35:37,441
Or else, I would've tied
a barbed wire around your neck.

1363
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:39,161
Your neck would've been sliced
if you even coughed.

1364
01:35:41,081 --> 01:35:42,161
Thank you.

1365
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:45,121
Now..

1366
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:50,121
It's the time for the renewal
of our strained friendship.

1367
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:51,561
It's time to sort it out.

1368
01:35:53,161 --> 01:35:57,161
I'm getting Rs. 15 lakh
for this contract to kill.

1369
01:35:57,801 --> 01:35:59,481
I'll give you Rs. 5 lakh from it.

1370
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,961
Completely.
I'll give you a bulk amount.

1371
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:05,721
No cheque. Only cash payment.

1372
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,121
Untie me..

1373
01:36:09,401 --> 01:36:12,161
It's hard to do it. I understand.

1374
01:36:12,401 --> 01:36:15,201
Okay, leave it.
Neither for you nor for me.

1375
01:36:15,281 --> 01:36:19,121
Let's share it equally.
Rs. 7.5 lakh for you and me.

1376
01:36:19,201 --> 01:36:20,281
Equal share.

1377
01:36:21,161 --> 01:36:23,321
Equal. Untie me.

1378
01:36:24,881 --> 01:36:26,241
I don't want it even if you
give me the entire amount.

1379
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:27,601
There's a different matter at hand.

1380
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:29,081
My vulgarity in Kannada
will come out now!

1381
01:36:29,281 --> 01:36:31,481
Should I add it to Rs. 15 lakh
which I'll give you?

1382
01:36:31,561 --> 01:36:33,361
What should I do
if I give it to you?

1383
01:36:34,081 --> 01:36:35,961
Do you know how business works?

1384
01:36:36,401 --> 01:36:39,121
It isn't like being at the border
and shooting at an outsider.

1385
01:36:39,321 --> 01:36:42,801
This is inside.
It must be done within society.

1386
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:45,161
That's war.

1387
01:36:45,641 --> 01:36:47,081
They gave you a medal and sent you.

1388
01:36:47,361 --> 01:36:50,441
You brought it back but instead,
what's with this fashion design?

1389
01:36:51,521 --> 01:36:54,641
You design and wear
these striped clothes.

1390
01:36:54,721 --> 01:36:58,121
No one cares. Wear some clothes
which are less eccentric.

1391
01:36:58,601 --> 01:37:00,761
People will call you mad,
Kaali Peeli.

1392
01:37:01,721 --> 01:37:04,081
Make some money. Learn to live.

1393
01:37:05,921 --> 01:37:08,321
Untie me..

1394
01:37:10,081 --> 01:37:12,561
Someone else will come
to untie you. - Who..

1395
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:16,481
Phone..

1396
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:17,841
Receive the call quickly.

1397
01:37:19,841 --> 01:37:22,721
What are the last three digits?
- 112.

1398
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:26,001
Oh, it's business! Money needs
to be transferred into my account.

1399
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:28,281
Death will occur only if money
is transferred into the account.

1400
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:31,321
Phone.. Let it ring
for a couple more times.

1401
01:37:31,961 --> 01:37:34,681
Listen to me.
Receive the call..

1402
01:37:34,841 --> 01:37:36,801
It's my livelihood! My business!

1403
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:38,521
Receive the call..

1404
01:37:39,161 --> 01:37:41,761
Receive it.. Let it ring.

1405
01:37:53,521 --> 01:37:54,361
Loyalty.

1406
01:37:55,081 --> 01:37:56,641
You've the disease of loyalty.

1407
01:37:57,521 --> 01:37:58,521
Tomorrow morning..

1408
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:02,481
I swear on my deceased son,
you're done for!

1409
01:38:02,561 --> 01:38:05,921
You're dead. What's the time..

1410
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:08,801
It isn't 12 o'clock yet, Tippi.

1411
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:12,761
No matter who's dying, it will take
place only at midnight 12 o'clock.

1412
01:38:16,161 --> 01:38:17,721
"Inky, Pinky.."

1413
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:19,161
It's your turn now.

1414
01:38:19,241 --> 01:38:20,841
People say that we must share both
our happiness as well as sorrow.

1415
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:23,361
You share your problems.
Who knows?

1416
01:38:23,521 --> 01:38:25,361
People say that today
is 'Success Day'.

1417
01:38:26,241 --> 01:38:27,921
He found peace.

1418
01:38:28,161 --> 01:38:30,081
The Auto poet found a life.

1419
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:31,801
I wonder what your problems are!

1420
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:35,041
How're your parents?

1421
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:39,401
Seenu.

1422
01:38:40,361 --> 01:38:43,441
Sit down.
- I've sat.

1423
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:45,041
Your table
mustn't have ears here.

1424
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:47,601
I want you to listen to me.

1425
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:51,081
I've a problem too.
I need an answer.

1426
01:38:51,161 --> 01:38:53,521
You start. We'll listen.

1427
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:57,881
There's a saying, 'All that
glitters is not gold', isn't there?

1428
01:38:58,441 --> 01:38:59,641
My life is like that.

1429
01:39:00,881 --> 01:39:02,681
I'm a software engineer
in the eyes of the society.

1430
01:39:02,761 --> 01:39:05,441
I've a paycheck of Rs. one lakh.
Trips to America and Australia.

1431
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:07,921
I maintain a team
of 180 people inside.

1432
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:10,721
It means that
I argue with 180 people every day.

1433
01:39:11,081 --> 01:39:13,441
Pressure from my bosses.
Car loan and house loan.

1434
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:16,721
Besides,
the stress of losing my job.

1435
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:19,721
I live my life with that tension.

1436
01:39:21,321 --> 01:39:23,201
Both my parents are teachers
back in our town.

1437
01:39:24,641 --> 01:39:27,481
They've a house
and four acres of land.

1438
01:39:29,681 --> 01:39:31,641
My father never expresses
his thoughts.

1439
01:39:33,121 --> 01:39:34,841
But my mother does
from time to time.

1440
01:39:36,641 --> 01:39:40,801
She says, 'You get food
at our house too.'

1441
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:43,681
'Leave everything
and come live here.'

1442
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:46,281
'I want to live with
my son, daughter-in-law'

1443
01:39:47,361 --> 01:39:49,561
'and my grandchildren
during my last days.

1444
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:53,361
I don't like this city actually.

1445
01:39:53,441 --> 01:39:54,761
But I can't speak out.

1446
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:58,361
I've a wheezing problem.

1447
01:40:00,561 --> 01:40:01,641
The doctor told me that
Bangalore's like this

1448
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:03,521
and asked me leave this place.

1449
01:40:05,601 --> 01:40:07,521
I asked them to tell me
the cost of the treatment

1450
01:40:08,921 --> 01:40:10,561
and told them not to advise me.

1451
01:40:16,721 --> 01:40:18,361
Now,
my child has asthma too.

1452
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:24,481
When I visited the doctor,
he asked me to keep my money

1453
01:40:25,121 --> 01:40:27,601
and told me to raise the child
in a healthy environment.

1454
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:30,561
I want this as well as that.

1455
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:33,161
Sometimes,
I don't want this or that.

1456
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,641
But, I've a monthly
paycheck of Rs. one lakh.

1457
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:40,441
I earn in a month

1458
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:41,921
what my parents earn
together in six months.

1459
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:46,521
Also, I've the social status
that 180 people work under me.

1460
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:51,281
On the other hand,
my parents

1461
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:55,401
my grandparents,
my hometown

1462
01:40:57,001 --> 01:40:59,601
our estate and our fields.

1463
01:41:00,001 --> 01:41:03,241
I'm unable to decide whether
to lead my life here or over there.

1464
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:04,721
Of late..

1465
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:08,241
...my mother's health
has also deteriorated.

1466
01:41:09,601 --> 01:41:10,841
She is worried about us.

1467
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:14,921
She misses me,
my wife and our child.

1468
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:17,841
It's an everlasting sickness.
It'll never leave your mind.

1469
01:41:22,761 --> 01:41:23,881
What shall I do?

1470
01:41:25,881 --> 01:41:27,241
'Work is worship.'

1471
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:29,641
The great dilemma is between
the car and house loans

1472
01:41:29,721 --> 01:41:31,761
and your parents,
isn't it?

1473
01:41:32,881 --> 01:41:34,401
I don't have an answer for this.

1474
01:41:36,521 --> 01:41:39,361
This is the same story of the guy
who comes to that table

1475
01:41:39,441 --> 01:41:40,801
the 'single busy man'.

1476
01:41:40,921 --> 01:41:44,681
He's a little older than you.
He has a team of 360 people.

1477
01:41:44,881 --> 01:41:45,921
360.

1478
01:41:47,281 --> 01:41:50,241
He was unable to visit his father
in the hospital, it seems.

1479
01:41:50,321 --> 01:41:52,521
Poor guy.
'Work is worship.'

1480
01:41:52,641 --> 01:41:54,921
He paid for a male nurse
who took care of his father

1481
01:41:55,001 --> 01:41:56,721
like a son would, it seems.

1482
01:41:57,641 --> 01:42:00,121
It seems that he was unable to go
even when his dad passed away.

1483
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:01,081
Poor guy.

1484
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:05,281
He was in a meeting.
'Work is worship', isn't it?

1485
01:42:06,681 --> 01:42:08,761
We can find another mother.

1486
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:11,241
But will you get another job
that pays Rs. 1 lakh? Tell me.

1487
01:42:11,801 --> 01:42:13,281
You tell me.

1488
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:28,961
'Huchha Venkat.'

1489
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:38,161
"What is left in life,
once you leave behind your native?"

1490
01:42:42,441 --> 01:42:49,761
"Don't fret now.
Wake up and get into the last bus."

1491
01:42:53,921 --> 01:43:01,361
"A breeze brought along a cry
from the direction of your native."

1492
01:43:01,521 --> 01:43:09,001
"Where else would you find
a better place than your native?"

1493
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:12,721
"Did you want this, buddy?"

1494
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:16,601
"Go back, my friend."

1495
01:43:16,881 --> 01:43:20,201
"Pack your bags and leave."

1496
01:43:20,641 --> 01:43:24,361
"Get into the right bus."

1497
01:43:24,441 --> 01:43:31,881
"What is left in life,
once you leave behind your native?"

1498
01:43:39,681 --> 01:43:47,001
"You're as good as dead,
if you're not in your native."

1499
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:54,601
"The banyan tree in your village
bears the name that you sculpted."

1500
01:43:54,921 --> 01:43:58,721
"For the name, fame and money,
you boarded a lorry"

1501
01:43:58,841 --> 01:44:02,361
"on the highway and reached here."

1502
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:10,161
"You came to the city and became
a gem covered in filth."

1503
01:44:10,241 --> 01:44:13,521
"Your girl will visit you
on a festival"

1504
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:17,441
"and her son will bear your name."

1505
01:44:17,641 --> 01:44:21,641
"I heard that the yield was good,
this season."

1506
01:44:21,761 --> 01:44:25,321
"It seems,
sister-in-law is pregnant again."

1507
01:44:25,441 --> 01:44:29,121
"Your candidate won the election."

1508
01:44:29,361 --> 01:44:32,921
"Uncle quit smoking."

1509
01:44:33,161 --> 01:44:40,561
"Aunt's daughter is studying.
She keeps asking for your number."

1510
01:44:40,681 --> 01:44:44,241
"You're on demand, buddy."

1511
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:48,081
"Go back to your home, my friend."

1512
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:51,921
"Pack your bags and leave."

1513
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:55,721
"Get into the right bus."

1514
01:44:56,081 --> 01:45:03,321
"What is left in life,
once you leave behind your native?"

1515
01:45:11,201 --> 01:45:18,801
"Why do you think too much
and cry over it?"

1516
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:22,881
"Why do you feel like your
parents are beside you"

1517
01:45:22,961 --> 01:45:26,201
"trying to console you?"

1518
01:45:26,641 --> 01:45:30,401
"A clueless man doesn't succeed."

1519
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:34,041
"Wherever you go,
you never change."

1520
01:45:34,201 --> 01:45:41,561
"Look for yourself in the place
where you were born."

1521
01:45:41,881 --> 01:45:45,241
"All your childhood friends
scold you."

1522
01:45:45,721 --> 01:45:48,961
"The girl next-door
awaits your arrival."

1523
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:52,921
"The teacher who
taught you expired."

1524
01:45:53,281 --> 01:45:56,681
"They sold the ancestral house."

1525
01:45:57,161 --> 01:46:00,881
"Your sister's husband
incurred a loss."

1526
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:04,361
"Your brother has fallen sick
from the past few days."

1527
01:46:04,721 --> 01:46:08,441
"Your dad is finding it hard
to even breathe."

1528
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:12,241
"Your mom has stopped
thinking about you."

1529
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:15,761
"This is the condition, buddy."

1530
01:46:16,201 --> 01:46:20,081
"Go back to your home, my friend."

1531
01:46:20,161 --> 01:46:23,481
"Pack your bags and leave."

1532
01:46:23,881 --> 01:46:27,761
"Wipe your tears
and board the bus."

1533
01:46:27,841 --> 01:46:31,561
"Pack your bags and leave."

1534
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:36,241
"Wipe your tears
and board the bus."

1535
01:46:46,001 --> 01:46:49,001
Seenu, I'll take
the last bus today.

1536
01:46:49,961 --> 01:46:51,161
I've been enlightened today.

1537
01:46:51,801 --> 01:46:52,721
May be.

1538
01:46:53,801 --> 01:46:56,241
Thank you..

1539
01:46:59,201 --> 01:47:00,121
Good luck.

1540
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:12,361
Wow! Such an eventful day.

1541
01:47:12,761 --> 01:47:15,521
Is it like this every day,
or is it because I've come here?

1542
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:18,121
It is like this all the time.

1543
01:47:18,321 --> 01:47:20,001
Something or the other would be
taking place here.

1544
01:47:20,321 --> 01:47:23,641
Parapancha would be like this
till Seena is here.

1545
01:47:24,081 --> 01:47:27,001
You probably wouldn't be able to
experience this in a 5 star hotel.

1546
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:28,321
Isn't it, Mr. Peddu?

1547
01:47:31,361 --> 01:47:33,801
It would've been good if you
had accompanied me home.

1548
01:47:34,161 --> 01:47:35,201
I would love to come.

1549
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:36,201
But a few clients
are coming today.

1550
01:47:36,281 --> 01:47:37,121
And that's the problem.

1551
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,281
Mom and dad would be upset again.

1552
01:47:39,401 --> 01:47:40,561
Yes, I agree
that they would be upset.

1553
01:47:40,641 --> 01:47:41,441
But I will definitely come
the next time.

1554
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:52,521
Today is something like
the judgement day.

1555
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:54,801
Pinky!

1556
01:47:55,641 --> 01:47:56,921
I will come in a minute. - Why?

1557
01:47:57,241 --> 01:47:58,321
I will just be back. - Okay.

1558
01:47:58,401 --> 01:47:59,481
She is my colleague. - Okay.

1559
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:00,961
Order something. - Okay.

1560
01:48:01,961 --> 01:48:02,921
Hi, Pinky.

1561
01:48:04,161 --> 01:48:05,001
Hi.

1562
01:48:05,081 --> 01:48:07,121
Hi, all. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi.

1563
01:48:07,401 --> 01:48:10,881
We're colleagues. - Okay. - Great!
- You're looking good, Pinky.

1564
01:48:10,961 --> 01:48:12,001
Sit..

1565
01:48:12,081 --> 01:48:14,361
Have a good time. Bye.
- You too. - Enjoy.

1566
01:48:15,161 --> 01:48:16,281
Who is he?

1567
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:20,161
He is my boss.

1568
01:48:20,561 --> 01:48:21,521
He's the Vice President.

1569
01:48:23,441 --> 01:48:27,961
He is harassing me sexually.

1570
01:48:30,521 --> 01:48:32,241
If I don't agree to his demands

1571
01:48:33,521 --> 01:48:36,921
he's saying that he'll fire me,
by giving fake excuses.

1572
01:48:37,201 --> 01:48:38,361
You should have complained
about this.

1573
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:40,681
Whom do I complain to?

1574
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:43,001
He is the Vice President.

1575
01:48:44,121 --> 01:48:46,321
The president sits in USA.

1576
01:48:46,881 --> 01:48:50,961
I'm afraid that I might lose my
job if I complain to the police.

1577
01:48:51,241 --> 01:48:54,961
My salary isn't sufficient
to lead a comfortable life.

1578
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:57,921
If I have to survive without a job
for 2-3 months

1579
01:48:58,601 --> 01:49:01,361
I will incur a debt
of nearly Rs. 25 lakhs.

1580
01:48:58,601 --> 01:49:01,361
I will incur a debt
of nearly Rs. 25 lakhs.

1581
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:06,001
He is aware that I'm not
in a position to quit my job.

1582
01:49:12,481 --> 01:49:14,281
'My wife is going
to her mother's place.'

1583
01:49:14,361 --> 01:49:16,041
'Why don't you join me tonight?'

1584
01:49:17,561 --> 01:49:20,081
My wife..
Okay?

1585
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:42,081
I feel like slapping him!

1586
01:49:43,921 --> 01:49:45,641
Pinky, this is your call.

1587
01:49:45,721 --> 01:49:46,921
You will have to do something
about this.

1588
01:49:49,441 --> 01:49:50,361
Seenu!

1589
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:51,921
Ma'am, I'm busy.

1590
01:49:52,001 --> 01:49:54,121
It's urgent. Please.

1591
01:49:57,881 --> 01:50:00,401
Seenu, is there an ear
below the table?

1592
01:50:00,481 --> 01:50:03,041
I have an ear here as well!

1593
01:50:03,881 --> 01:50:05,001
Tell me what it is.

1594
01:50:05,081 --> 01:50:06,801
What do I say, ma'am?

1595
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:11,201
If you heed my advice and go and
slap him, you'll lose your job.

1596
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:16,041
Then you'll blame me for it
and ask me to pay you Rs. 6 lakh.

1597
01:50:16,121 --> 01:50:17,761
Stop fooling around. Please.

1598
01:50:17,841 --> 01:50:21,521
Ma'am, aren't you
the Assistant Vice President?

1599
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,561
If you're unable to take decisions
pertaining to your life

1600
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:26,601
how will you take
the decisions of the company?

1601
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:31,081
Just think about the consequences
if you thrash him.

1602
01:50:31,201 --> 01:50:35,121
Also think about the consequences
if you oblige to him.

1603
01:50:35,241 --> 01:50:36,601
The choice is yours.

1604
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:42,321
I have to serve drinks
to the boss. Shall I leave?

1605
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:47,401
Yes, Pinky. He has a point.

1606
01:50:48,001 --> 01:50:49,921
Yes. Go, Pinky. Slap him.

1607
01:50:50,841 --> 01:50:53,521
Yes. Go, Pinky.
Go and slap him.

1608
01:50:57,521 --> 01:50:59,281
Excuse me. - Yes?
- Pinky?

1609
01:51:05,721 --> 01:51:09,521
Pinky, what's this?
Please, no..

1610
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:13,521
Oh, shit!

1611
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:16,281
I-I don't know anything.
I haven't done anything.

1612
01:51:23,681 --> 01:51:24,521
Slap him.

1613
01:51:33,121 --> 01:51:34,601
Heck with your job!

1614
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:36,441
I will resign right away!

1615
01:51:36,561 --> 01:51:37,761
And I will lodge a complaint
to the police.

1616
01:51:37,841 --> 01:51:38,961
I will join you.

1617
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:53,481
This is the house where
everything gets sorted.

1618
01:51:53,801 --> 01:51:55,361
Did you really want
all this, Seenu?

1619
01:51:55,561 --> 01:51:57,041
May God bless everyone.

1620
01:51:58,081 --> 01:52:02,321
The phone is ringing..

1621
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:03,841
The one with the flower..

1622
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:06,121
Answer the call..

1623
01:52:06,281 --> 01:52:08,121
The mother and the baby would've
been discharged now and gone home.

1624
01:52:08,281 --> 01:52:09,921
They'll be with that lady.

1625
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:14,081
Just answer! Say, hello.
Answer the call..

1626
01:52:14,281 --> 01:52:17,641
Let it ring for a few more times.
Please receive..

1627
01:52:17,721 --> 01:52:22,881
Answer the call, you idiot..
Answer..

1628
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:28,001
Do you like the mother
and the baby so much, Tippi?

1629
01:52:28,081 --> 01:52:30,521
She is the Goddess.

1630
01:52:30,601 --> 01:52:33,601
If something happens to the Goddess
and the baby..

1631
01:52:35,001 --> 01:52:38,841
I will destroy every doctor
who's out there.

1632
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:40,801
I'll have the entire town
destroyed!

1633
01:52:42,321 --> 01:52:46,881
Call back once..
Please do it for me.

1634
01:52:46,961 --> 01:52:49,521
Do it for my sake.

1635
01:52:53,481 --> 01:52:58,081
You are innocent and a gentleman.

1636
01:52:58,201 --> 01:53:00,881
And an ex-service man
of the military.

1637
01:53:06,521 --> 01:53:07,601
Hey..

1638
01:53:07,721 --> 01:53:10,441
Kaali Peeli!
I want to listen to her voice..

1639
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:14,561
Kaali Peeli, just once..

1640
01:53:17,161 --> 01:53:19,121
Kaali Peeli..

1641
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:21,361
Okay..

1642
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:24,601
Kaali Peeli..

1643
01:53:40,241 --> 01:53:41,801
You wouldn't understand
what she speaks.

1644
01:53:41,961 --> 01:53:45,401
Just dial her number once..

1645
01:53:45,481 --> 01:53:46,561
You will not understand.

1646
01:53:46,921 --> 01:53:49,881
Just once..

1647
01:53:50,121 --> 01:53:51,601
The doctor said..

1648
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:56,361
The mother and the baby died.

1649
01:53:59,161 --> 01:54:01,521
What?

1650
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:06,921
Didn't the baby survive..

1651
01:54:12,281 --> 01:54:15,241
Tippi..

1652
01:54:15,641 --> 01:54:19,601
Tippi..

1653
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:24,001
Listen..

1654
01:54:27,641 --> 01:54:29,081
Why did this happen..

1655
01:54:29,161 --> 01:54:30,521
The baby died of jaundice.

1656
01:54:30,961 --> 01:54:34,081
The mother breathed her last,
unable to bear the shock.

1657
01:54:37,681 --> 01:54:41,041
Why doesn't anyone want to stay
with me, Kaali Peeli?

1658
01:54:41,361 --> 01:54:43,281
Why? - Fate..

1659
01:54:44,001 --> 01:54:47,561
I condemn fate!

1660
01:54:52,321 --> 01:54:53,681
There's no one left, Kaali Peeli.

1661
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:57,681
Everything is temporary.
It isn't fair..

1662
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:04,401
I don't want to see the mother's

1663
01:55:05,081 --> 01:55:06,281
or the baby's corpses.

1664
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,801
I don't have the strength.

1665
01:55:10,241 --> 01:55:13,401
I am faint- hearted.
I don't want to see it.

1666
01:55:14,161 --> 01:55:18,201
I don't want to witness anything.
- Tippi!

1667
01:55:21,761 --> 01:55:24,081
This is the curse of all the people
whom I've killed.

1668
01:55:24,361 --> 01:55:26,361
This is the curse of death!

1669
01:55:30,281 --> 01:55:31,121
Kaali Peeli..

1670
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:36,521
Y-You please kill me.

1671
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:38,841
A single bullet
can take away my life.

1672
01:55:40,721 --> 01:55:42,281
I want to die.
I don't deserve to live.

1673
01:55:42,361 --> 01:55:43,681
Please kill me.

1674
01:55:44,281 --> 01:55:45,921
You can cremate my body

1675
01:55:46,041 --> 01:55:49,521
as well as the bodies
of my wife and my baby.

1676
01:55:49,601 --> 01:55:51,241
The funeral procession
should be grand!

1677
01:55:51,321 --> 01:55:54,081
Why, Kaali Peeli?
Just kill me.

1678
01:55:54,161 --> 01:55:55,281
Crime is precious.

1679
01:56:26,721 --> 01:56:28,041
Ma'am, deal!

1680
01:56:30,521 --> 01:56:31,561
You'll be part of a TV show.

1681
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:35,321
And your husband would get
a government contract.

1682
01:56:36,721 --> 01:56:38,841
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1683
01:56:39,881 --> 01:56:41,921
Should your husband be here?

1684
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:48,201
Go, mister.

1685
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:53,001
Oh, no! He wants to be thrown out.

1686
01:56:53,081 --> 01:56:57,201
What about us? - "Kicking around
on a piece of ground"

1687
01:56:57,281 --> 01:56:59,001
"in your home town."

1688
01:56:59,081 --> 01:57:03,481
"Waiting for someone or something
to show you the way."

1689
01:57:03,561 --> 01:57:06,441
Had I been to college,
I could have been like this.

1690
01:57:06,521 --> 01:57:09,721
"Tired of lying in the sunshine.."

1691
01:57:09,801 --> 01:57:13,521
I really wish to live like this.
- "Staying home to watch the rain."

1692
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:21,161
"You are young and life is long,
and there is time to kill today."

1693
01:57:21,881 --> 01:57:24,801
"And then one day you find.."

1694
01:57:25,961 --> 01:57:28,561
Oh, my God! He is my son, Vihaan.

1695
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:31,001
Oh, God! What do we do now?

1696
01:57:31,081 --> 01:57:32,481
I don't know what to do.

1697
01:57:36,881 --> 01:57:37,721
Oh, shit!

1698
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:39,041
What happened, buddy?
- What happened? - My dad!

1699
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:41,241
What happened? - Oh, no!
- Oh, my gosh!

1700
01:57:41,321 --> 01:57:42,121
What happened?

1701
01:57:45,921 --> 01:57:46,881
He has seen me.

1702
01:57:47,241 --> 01:57:48,401
It won't be nice if I leave now.

1703
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:51,201
Oh, no! Isn't he your father?
- I know.

1704
01:57:51,281 --> 01:57:52,441
Oh, my God! - Oh, God!

1705
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:53,921
Moreover, you are with me.

1706
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:56,601
Shall we ask him
if we have to join the tables?

1707
01:57:56,681 --> 01:57:58,361
Oh! - Dude, are you mad?

1708
01:57:59,121 --> 01:58:00,521
What is wrong in that?
- Hey, just keep quiet.

1709
01:58:00,601 --> 01:58:01,601
Don't joke around at this time.

1710
01:58:09,081 --> 01:58:10,401
He has seen me.

1711
01:58:10,481 --> 01:58:11,641
What do we do now?

1712
01:58:14,001 --> 01:58:16,401
Oh, my God!
- Oh, Vihaan! Is he your dad?

1713
01:58:16,481 --> 01:58:18,641
Shall we go and tell them
that we are friends?

1714
01:58:19,641 --> 01:58:20,921
Darn it! It wouldn't seem right.

1715
01:58:21,681 --> 01:58:24,521
You are a wealthy man
and I'm a bar dancer.

1716
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:26,881
Idea!

1717
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:29,881
We'll act innocent
in front of them.

1718
01:58:31,121 --> 01:58:32,641
Oh, God!
That wouldn't be apt either.

1719
01:58:33,401 --> 01:58:35,881
That would just raise suspicion
on us.

1720
01:58:36,761 --> 01:58:39,801
Guys, you carry on. - Hey..
- I'll leave. - Vihaan, don't go.

1721
01:58:39,881 --> 01:58:42,121
Vihaan, stop.. - Vihaan..
- No, Vihaan. Come back.

1722
01:58:43,841 --> 01:58:46,281
Hey!
- Seena, you don't understand.

1723
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:47,961
Please, let me go.
- Why? - Is he still there?

1724
01:58:52,281 --> 01:58:54,961
No, he isn't there.
He has left.

1725
01:58:55,041 --> 01:58:56,441
My dad is in there.
Please, let me go.

1726
01:58:56,521 --> 01:58:58,041
Both of you have seen each other,
isn't it?

1727
01:58:58,201 --> 01:58:59,841
Where will you go now?
Just sit down.

1728
01:59:04,281 --> 01:59:05,521
I think we should leave now.

1729
01:59:23,881 --> 01:59:25,641
Both of you have seen each other.

1730
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:27,241
What is the use if we leave now?

1731
01:59:27,321 --> 01:59:28,201
What do I do now?

1732
01:59:28,281 --> 01:59:30,161
I suggest you to confess the truth
before him.

1733
01:59:30,241 --> 01:59:31,401
What do I confess?
Should I tell him

1734
01:59:31,481 --> 01:59:32,921
that I've remained chaste
after my wife's death

1735
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:34,361
or that this is the first time
that I'm here?

1736
01:59:34,441 --> 01:59:35,281
It is not possible.

1737
01:59:35,361 --> 01:59:37,841
Many a times,
even if we tell the truth

1738
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:38,761
nobody would believe it.

1739
01:59:38,841 --> 01:59:40,481
I shouldn't have been caught
at this time.

1740
01:59:40,561 --> 01:59:41,881
It is up to them.

1741
01:59:42,921 --> 01:59:44,281
I can't even face him now.

1742
01:59:45,041 --> 01:59:46,841
I'm unable to face him now.

1743
01:59:47,841 --> 01:59:51,041
After all, we all are humans.

1744
01:59:51,441 --> 01:59:52,641
A mistake is a mistake

1745
01:59:52,801 --> 01:59:53,921
only if you consider it
to be a mistake.

1746
01:59:54,961 --> 01:59:56,041
Please go.

1747
01:59:56,121 --> 01:59:57,321
Go and talk to him.

1748
01:59:58,281 --> 01:59:59,201
Go and talk to him.

1749
01:59:59,761 --> 02:00:00,801
Everything will be all right.

1750
02:00:01,641 --> 02:00:02,841
Everything will be just fine.

1751
02:00:20,281 --> 02:00:23,761
Well, for some business deal..

1752
02:00:23,841 --> 02:00:26,401
Dad, I know
that she is a call girl.

1753
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:31,201
Sorry, I've made a mistake.

1754
02:00:31,281 --> 02:00:34,881
No, Dad. Actually, you have not.

1755
02:00:35,921 --> 02:00:38,321
No, Son. I have.

1756
02:00:40,041 --> 02:00:44,001
Sometimes, the truth sounds
better than a lie.

1757
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:46,081
It is better not to reveal them.

1758
02:00:46,521 --> 02:00:50,401
But anyway, I will open up
with you for my satisfaction.

1759
02:00:52,401 --> 02:00:53,881
From the time
your mother passed away

1760
02:00:54,681 --> 02:00:57,641
I never laid my eyes on any women.

1761
02:00:57,721 --> 02:01:00,241
Today is a bad day.

1762
02:01:00,321 --> 02:01:01,281
I know, Dad.

1763
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:06,361
For this reason,
people make fun of you.

1764
02:01:08,401 --> 02:01:10,561
So, do you believe me?

1765
02:01:10,641 --> 02:01:11,641
Yes, of course, Dad.

1766
02:01:12,921 --> 02:01:16,321
I don't have any problem
with you dating her.

1767
02:01:16,401 --> 02:01:19,321
In fact, this is your life too.

1768
02:01:20,321 --> 02:01:23,841
No, Son.
This is not just about my life.

1769
02:01:24,681 --> 02:01:29,121
It involves you
and your mother who is no more.

1770
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:30,801
Is it not? - Yes, you are right.

1771
02:01:31,281 --> 02:01:33,201
Your responsibilities
will never change

1772
02:01:33,321 --> 02:01:35,201
even if you go out with Kasturi.

1773
02:01:35,281 --> 02:01:37,881
They will remain same, like always.

1774
02:01:37,921 --> 02:01:39,641
You can enjoy your life, Dad.

1775
02:01:40,761 --> 02:01:41,601
Don't worry.

1776
02:01:42,721 --> 02:01:44,321
Mom might be happy too.

1777
02:01:45,121 --> 02:01:48,441
Who knows! Mom may have
sent you here, herself.

1778
02:01:50,161 --> 02:01:53,121
I never realised
that you have grown up.

1779
02:01:54,041 --> 02:01:55,801
Is it a compliment
or a verbal onslaught, Dad?

1780
02:01:58,401 --> 02:02:00,641
Okay.
Let me hear about you now.

1781
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:02,881
There was a strong reason
for me to feel ashamed.

1782
02:02:02,921 --> 02:02:04,241
But why were you trying
to run away?

1783
02:02:06,361 --> 02:02:07,841
Well..

1784
02:02:09,081 --> 02:02:10,521
In front of you..

1785
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:15,481
But this was the first time.

1786
02:02:18,241 --> 02:02:19,681
Do you trust me, Dad?

1787
02:02:19,761 --> 02:02:22,001
Can I trust you? - No.

1788
02:02:25,841 --> 02:02:29,321
Even I was caught by my father.

1789
02:02:30,201 --> 02:02:33,001
"Someone take me back
to the good old days."

1790
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:33,881
It happens.

1791
02:02:34,721 --> 02:02:37,481
But you should know your limits.

1792
02:02:38,281 --> 02:02:40,161
You shouldn't yield to it.

1793
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:44,401
You should control your habits.
- Okay, Dad.

1794
02:02:46,121 --> 02:02:48,761
So, what next? - Nothing, Dad.

1795
02:02:49,001 --> 02:02:51,001
Let me guess.
You have a girlfriend.

1796
02:02:51,801 --> 02:02:53,761
Yes, Dad.
N-No, Dad.

1797
02:02:54,881 --> 02:02:56,041
Is she the one in the white top?

1798
02:02:57,441 --> 02:02:58,561
Yes.
- Whose daughter is she?

1799
02:02:59,201 --> 02:03:00,241
She is the daughter of Mr. Shubh.

1800
02:03:00,561 --> 02:03:02,161
Mr. Shubh's daughter?
- Yes.

1801
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:04,761
Oh!
- What are you doing, Dad?

1802
02:03:07,721 --> 02:03:08,641
Hi, Shubh.
- Oh, God.

1803
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:11,721
Have you let your daughter
hit on guys?

1804
02:03:13,041 --> 02:03:14,441
She has netted my son.

1805
02:03:14,961 --> 02:03:17,161
Yes, man..

1806
02:03:17,641 --> 02:03:19,041
We are about to become relatives.

1807
02:03:20,321 --> 02:03:21,241
Yes, I will pass it to him.

1808
02:03:21,321 --> 02:03:23,921
No. - Talk to him..
- Please! Oh, God!

1809
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:26,801
Hello, sir.

1810
02:03:26,881 --> 02:03:28,761
No, Dad. Please.

1811
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:30,361
He is feeling shy.

1812
02:03:30,681 --> 02:03:32,801
Okay. See you, bye.

1813
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:37,361
You shouldn't play
with a girl's life.

1814
02:03:37,801 --> 02:03:41,481
Treat your girlfriend with respect.
Okay? - Yes.

1815
02:03:44,201 --> 02:03:48,281
Vihaan, shall I come to your table
and join the company?

1816
02:03:48,481 --> 02:03:51,521
Come on, Dad.
Don't do that now, please.

1817
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:55,401
She'll be waiting..

1818
02:03:55,641 --> 02:03:56,881
Go and join her.

1819
02:03:59,801 --> 02:04:02,521
Dad, give me the car key.
- Why?

1820
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:03,441
Just give it to me.

1821
02:04:06,281 --> 02:04:07,921
Here, take my bike keys.

1822
02:04:08,521 --> 02:04:09,761
Enjoy, Dad. - Bike?

1823
02:04:10,001 --> 02:04:12,681
Me? - Yes. - Okay.

1824
02:04:21,321 --> 02:04:23,801
"Life is very simple."

1825
02:04:24,641 --> 02:04:29,081
"It is full of ups and downs."

1826
02:04:29,601 --> 02:04:34,241
"In spite of having everything,
something would be missing."

1827
02:04:34,481 --> 02:04:39,361
"We've to chase something
which we really want."

1828
02:04:39,601 --> 02:04:42,281
"Life is very simple."

1829
02:04:44,921 --> 02:04:46,601
Is everything okay?

1830
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:49,161
Thank you, Seenu.

1831
02:04:49,241 --> 02:04:52,001
I'm just a pretext.
You have to thank God.

1832
02:04:53,081 --> 02:04:54,161
May God bless you.

1833
02:04:54,201 --> 02:04:55,201
Thank you very much.

1834
02:05:05,281 --> 02:05:09,041
I don't know if I did something
which is morally right.

1835
02:05:09,881 --> 02:05:12,801
But I'm really happy
for my father.

1836
02:05:13,001 --> 02:05:14,521
According to you,
whatever you have done is correct.

1837
02:05:14,601 --> 02:05:15,921
The same holds good with him.

1838
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:18,041
But God has already
pre-planned everything.

1839
02:05:21,321 --> 02:05:22,401
Thank you for everything.

1840
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:23,641
All the best.

1841
02:05:34,441 --> 02:05:36,041
Kasturi..

1842
02:05:36,601 --> 02:05:39,921
It was a bad moment
and I had bad intentions.

1843
02:05:40,761 --> 02:05:45,521
And I was lucky to have met you,
like a damsel!

1844
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:50,761
Because of you, I got my son back.

1845
02:05:51,761 --> 02:05:53,361
And I got a daughter-in-law
as well.

1846
02:05:55,201 --> 02:05:57,921
I got back my family.

1847
02:05:58,681 --> 02:06:01,801
I was confined to the four walls
of my house.

1848
02:06:02,601 --> 02:06:04,281
It has now become lively.

1849
02:06:05,241 --> 02:06:08,601
This is enough for this lifetime.

1850
02:06:10,601 --> 02:06:11,921
Even I feel the same way, sir.

1851
02:06:12,081 --> 02:06:16,361
This time, I want to give
this relationship a try.

1852
02:06:17,001 --> 02:06:20,161
The doors of my heart and my home

1853
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:24,481
are always open to you.

1854
02:06:25,641 --> 02:06:29,201
I want you to be a part
of my family.

1855
02:06:30,841 --> 02:06:34,241
If you want something,
you can always ask me.

1856
02:06:34,681 --> 02:06:35,521
I'm there.

1857
02:06:35,921 --> 02:06:37,081
I'll give you anything
that you want.

1858
02:06:37,921 --> 02:06:40,881
For now, the trust you have on me
is enough, sir.

1859
02:06:46,441 --> 02:06:49,881
Thank you very much.
Shall I leave? - Okay.

1860
02:06:54,521 --> 02:06:57,201
Take care. Bye.

1861
02:07:03,201 --> 02:07:05,681
No, stay away from me.

1862
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:07,361
How can you say it so easily?

1863
02:07:07,561 --> 02:07:09,401
It's been two years
since I've slept.

1864
02:07:10,601 --> 02:07:13,001
On the day 15 people drank liquor
from my father's shop, and died

1865
02:07:13,201 --> 02:07:15,441
an old lady started yelling.

1866
02:07:15,521 --> 02:07:16,401
She claimed that my
father is responsible

1867
02:07:16,481 --> 02:07:17,281
for the death of her children.

1868
02:07:18,201 --> 02:07:19,801
When I went there, along with
the three children of the old lady

1869
02:07:19,881 --> 02:07:21,201
twelve other men had died.

1870
02:07:22,161 --> 02:07:24,001
Everyone blamed my father for it.

1871
02:07:25,121 --> 02:07:26,601
I went home and probed my father
about this.

1872
02:07:26,721 --> 02:07:30,201
He said that this was unintentional
and such things happen in life.

1873
02:07:31,161 --> 02:07:32,841
He told me that I should
become like him when I grow up

1874
02:07:32,921 --> 02:07:34,241
and lead a life like him.

1875
02:07:35,361 --> 02:07:37,401
All the fifteen corpses were taken
right in front of my house.

1876
02:07:38,521 --> 02:07:41,001
On that day, I began to think
as to why a man desired

1877
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:43,641
for alcohol, recreational drugs
and other such things.

1878
02:07:43,921 --> 02:07:45,041
I felt crazy.

1879
02:07:45,201 --> 02:07:46,321
I was unable to eat.

1880
02:07:47,001 --> 02:07:48,281
I opted out of sports
and dropped out of college.

1881
02:07:49,681 --> 02:07:50,761
At last, I even left my city.

1882
02:07:51,721 --> 02:07:54,441
I threw away all the clothes
that my father had given me

1883
02:07:54,521 --> 02:07:55,481
and fled naked.

1884
02:07:56,641 --> 02:08:00,241
But the guilt from that day
isn't fading.

1885
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:06,081
The alcohol that claimed 15 lives,
shouldn't take away more lives.

1886
02:08:06,361 --> 02:08:08,281
If we ask people to give up
drinking, they definitely won't.

1887
02:08:08,401 --> 02:08:10,081
We must kill the main source.

1888
02:08:11,321 --> 02:08:13,241
If a few people reform
because of me

1889
02:08:14,001 --> 02:08:15,561
I might be able to catch sleep
for an hour.

1890
02:08:15,721 --> 02:08:16,961
And that would be
my genuine repentance.

1891
02:08:17,881 --> 02:08:20,841
The day I sleep peacefully

1892
02:08:21,001 --> 02:08:22,441
I'll come looking for you.

1893
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:24,081
In the meantime,
if you find someone else

1894
02:08:24,321 --> 02:08:25,601
I wish you both
to be happy forever.

1895
02:08:29,081 --> 02:08:30,281
Please leave.

1896
02:08:30,361 --> 02:08:32,041
Prashanth will drop you home.

1897
02:09:14,841 --> 02:09:16,201
Tippi, the boy is here.

1898
02:09:17,481 --> 02:09:18,321
I will call him here.

1899
02:09:18,641 --> 02:09:21,441
It is up to you to kill him
or give up your life instead.

1900
02:09:31,161 --> 02:09:32,961
Sir, what are you doing
by shutting the door?

1901
02:09:33,601 --> 02:09:36,081
The bar is closed.
What about supper?

1902
02:09:39,921 --> 02:09:42,121
You do know about the 15 people
who died last year

1903
02:09:42,201 --> 02:09:43,761
by drinking illicit liquor
from your father's shop.

1904
02:09:45,761 --> 02:09:48,841
The parents of those 15 people
together have paid him Rs. 15 lakh

1905
02:09:48,921 --> 02:09:50,601
and have asked him to kill you.

1906
02:09:52,921 --> 02:09:54,281
They don't want your father to die.

1907
02:09:54,361 --> 02:09:56,321
Instead, they want to see your
dad suffer because of your death.

1908
02:09:56,401 --> 02:09:58,281
He wouldn't leave this place
till you die.

1909
02:10:04,281 --> 02:10:06,001
Are you here to kill me?

1910
02:10:07,921 --> 02:10:11,841
I'm tired repenting, all my life.

1911
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:15,481
I can hear the cries
of the victims in my sleep.

1912
02:10:18,441 --> 02:10:19,841
I'm ready to give up my life
for the sin

1913
02:10:23,721 --> 02:10:24,881
that my father has committed.

1914
02:10:26,921 --> 02:10:28,001
Let it end here.

1915
02:10:35,481 --> 02:10:38,361
He's ready to give up his life for
the sin committed by his father.

1916
02:10:38,441 --> 02:10:39,921
He is living his life for others.

1917
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:42,441
We search for God everywhere.

1918
02:10:42,521 --> 02:10:44,561
God is present in virtuous boys
like him, Tippi.

1919
02:10:55,921 --> 02:10:59,521
When I

1920
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:03,881
called up the doctor, he said

1921
02:11:04,681 --> 02:11:06,361
that the mother
and the new born baby were fine.

1922
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:08,361
And that they have gone home.

1923
02:11:09,241 --> 02:11:11,121
I lied to you that
the two of them have died.

1924
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:15,441
I wanted you to know
the pain that parents undergo

1925
02:11:15,521 --> 02:11:16,601
when their children die.

1926
02:11:27,521 --> 02:11:28,321
Here, take it.

1927
02:11:38,801 --> 02:11:41,401
What are you looking at, Tippi?
Shoot him.

1928
02:11:42,881 --> 02:11:44,241
The other day, 15 people died
and their parents lamented

1929
02:11:44,321 --> 02:11:45,521
over the death of their children.

1930
02:11:45,681 --> 02:11:47,321
Today, you are about to kill him.

1931
02:11:47,401 --> 02:11:48,681
And his parents would lament
over his death.

1932
02:11:49,721 --> 02:11:53,801
You should be happy along with
your wife and your new-born baby.

1933
02:11:53,881 --> 02:11:54,681
Go ahead and kill him.

1934
02:11:54,921 --> 02:11:56,601
It's midnight.

1935
02:11:57,001 --> 02:11:59,401
Crime is philosophy.
Go ahead and shoot him.

1936
02:12:26,081 --> 02:12:29,441
I am dead..

1937
02:12:30,361 --> 02:12:32,321
Whatever the astrologer said
was true.

1938
02:12:33,201 --> 02:12:37,201
I am dead..

1939
02:12:38,641 --> 02:12:41,601
But I am born again.

1940
02:12:42,721 --> 02:12:43,521
It's a new beginning.

1941
02:12:44,721 --> 02:12:45,721
I've got a new life.

1942
02:12:48,361 --> 02:12:51,401
T-This gun is no way related to me.

1943
02:12:53,041 --> 02:12:56,121
That little one..

1944
02:12:57,001 --> 02:13:00,961
Little one..
You go back home.

1945
02:13:01,961 --> 02:13:02,801
You are a good person.

1946
02:13:03,601 --> 02:13:08,601
If those 15 people question me,
I will..

1947
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:12,201
Kaali Peeli..

1948
02:13:16,001 --> 02:13:20,881
My wife and my child
in the incubator..

1949
02:13:28,361 --> 02:13:30,921
Kaali Peeli..

1950
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:38,001
Auto..

1951
02:13:38,361 --> 02:13:39,361
My wife..

1952
02:13:40,001 --> 02:13:44,561
Auto.. My wife..

1953
02:14:04,321 --> 02:14:09,481
One fine day, let us all meet
at this beautiful place again.

1954
02:14:09,841 --> 02:14:10,641
Cheers!

1955
02:14:10,761 --> 02:14:11,641
Farewell.

1956
02:14:50,401 --> 02:14:51,641
'End.'
