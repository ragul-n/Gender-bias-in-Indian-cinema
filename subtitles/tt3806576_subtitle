1
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Will you take me to Pattom?

2
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,800
- Ah okay - Lets go

3
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
What else?

4
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,640
Buses are on strike today also, eh?

5
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
- Yes - Strike

6
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
- Will you come? - Sure

7
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
- Where to brother? - Pattom

8
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
- How's business? - As usual

9
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,680
'News headlines'

10
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,280
'Around 10:30 this morning, a ball of fire accompanied with a fearful sound...'

11
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
'...was reported to have been seen in several places'

12
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
The explosion in the sky at Palakkad have triggered panic among people

13
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,040
It was so loud It was a deafening sound

14
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,160
I have never heard so loud a noise in my whole life

15
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,880
We saw it, we actually did But no one believes us

16
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,840
The explosion and ball of fire has created panic among people

17
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,800
This is definitely Kaliyugam (age of downfall)

18
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,040
The world is on its way to its end

19
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
This is no earthquake It is some phenomenon

20
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,480
A very scary phenomenon

21
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,480
No one understood what it was They just ran out shouting in fear

22
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,920
People were terrified

23
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,880
We first though it was an earth quake Then we realized it was in the sky

24
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,400
We are ourselves destroying nature We must therefore bear the consequences

25
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,160
So let us face it

26
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,480
People must not panic

27
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,520
Everything can be brought under control

28
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,200
The govt has given orders for tight security

29
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,720
People who have suffered losses shall be compensated suitably by govt

30
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,360
The nodal officers have already been given instructions

31
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,720
The govt expects co operation and a combined effort...

32
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,200
...from all public works departments

33
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,680
We expect all of you to co operate

34
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,920
You must behave decently Not like a drunkard

35
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't worry It is with regard to your kids

36
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,480
- Everything will become alright - There's no use talking about it

37
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,280
Your oldest son Pratapan Take him for instance

38
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,240
You educated and brought him up well What more can you do?

39
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,800
- You just don't worry yourself - There is no use

40
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
This is the 'age of downfall' dude

41
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,960
Let us sit here for 5 minutes We'll try to reduce your anxiety a bit

42
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,520
I keep telling you not to worry These are not very important

43
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,480
Think of good things

44
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,320
Why must you worry?

45
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Goodness!

46
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,880
Hey! Look at that

47
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,160
Yes

48
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,640
Yes sir

49
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,000
What?!

50
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
What is the radar report?

51
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
Could not track any signal sir

52
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Inform the SUD And get a report now

53
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
Sir there were 3 lights Massive very bright and not so bright

54
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Just hovering around the earth

55
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,160
Get me the infra red report

56
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Its not an aircraft or any sort of defence mechanism used by a country

57
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
What the hell is it?

58
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,800
We have got another report Four minutes after the first sightings

59
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Its towards north east

60
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,600
- How far? - 282 km in 40 seconds

61
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
What?!

62
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,280
Sir

63
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Yes sir!

64
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Sir Minister for defense is on line

65
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
Sir Yes sir

66
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay

67
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
What are we supposed to do sir

68
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,600
Minister says everything is under control

69
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,880
But this is not under control

70
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,000
They don't know what they are dealing with

71
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,480
I can tell that she is scared

72
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
Those lights

73
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,400
Bright lights

74
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
She said...

75
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,760
...she couldn't take her eyes off it

76
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,160
Things were not the same since last 2 days

77
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,520
My dear Don't worry

78
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,720
It's nothing I tell you, it's nothing

79
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
It's okay

80
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,760
What did she see? I have no idea

81
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,480
What should I believe? That also I don't know

82
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,880
I have to consult an expert

83
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,200
I can't bear to see her suffer like this

84
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
Would you think the same like others do?

85
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
No

86
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,960
But I feel she needs your support and strength

87
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,960
Until she becomes normal both of you must go somewhere else

88
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,920
I will shift to my sister's house for a few days

89
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,440
Did she say anything else about that night?

90
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,520
I mean if she felt a presence

91
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,880
Or seen someone

92
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,120
Anything else that she saw out there?

93
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
No

94
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
Why do you ask?

95
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,040
Nothing

96
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
'We are all living in a world of imagination'

97
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
'A world we created for ourselves'

98
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,640
'Where the very laws of nature...'

99
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,960
'...are different, hypothetical and self contained'

100
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,160
'When our imagination clash with reality...'

101
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,600
'...we come across things and thoughts we can't fathom'

102
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,800
'Something that you cannot accept'

103
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,440
'That's when we must decide...'

104
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,000
'....whether to believe in it or not'

105
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,560
Sir, is this strange phenomenon connected to the red rains of 2001?

106
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,000
I am unable to give you more info on this, I am sorry

107
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,920
But the govt is very serious about this

108
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
And we have formed a special investigation team

109
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,800
We are examining similar events that have occurred earlier

110
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
You know people are already confused

111
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,680
You must not mislead them with false information

112
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,240
Are these investigations generally done under secrecy?

113
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,480
Is that why you are not sharing it with media?

114
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,960
We don't have any proper evidence which we are looking for

115
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,280
There are many witnesses to such events

116
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
Do you think it's not relevant?

117
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Fake photos and videos can be created even by a kid...

118
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,680
...with the help of a good software

119
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,120
They could not provide any proof to stand up and prove...

120
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,600
...the existence of this extraordinary Phenomenon

121
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Sir...one more question

122
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,240
How are you, brother?

123
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
Very funny!

124
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
- Got you, eh? - Yeah!

125
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,280
Come

126
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,400
- Here - Thank you

127
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,160
Come on tell me, what's up with you?

128
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,760
Have you finished your course?

129
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,760
Do you have to go back to the UK?

130
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,320
I must go back in any case

131
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,440
I have to submit my final dissertation

132
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,720
And I have with some friends planning to start a production house

133
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,680
I must apply for the VISA It takes time

134
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,840
Unbelievable! It's been 5 years, right?

135
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,920
Time flies

136
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,960
Actually things are just shaping up

137
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
It's come quite advanced, but the cold

138
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,760
Well isn't that the best part? Look how warm it is here

139
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Bro, we can tolerate the heat But the cold numbs your limbs...

140
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,520
...and I don't know how to express it

141
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,920
- But summer is heaven - Yeah, I know

142
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,480
That's why I come to India during winters

143
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,360
And enjoy the British summer every year

144
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,720
Any news about my younger brother?

145
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,840
Weren't you there? That's about it

146
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,080
The rented car which the police found

147
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
And some photos

148
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
It's been 4 years since he's been gone

149
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
No one knows where or what's happened

150
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,320
When he came to study in the UK I was very excited

151
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,800
To be among cousins That's a special kind of fun, isn't it?

152
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,080
Life is a puzzle

153
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,560
It's hard to unlock even though the answers are around you

154
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,280
These are the last words he told me

155
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
You know...I miss him too

156
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,360
I am hoping he comes back But we can only hope isn't it?

157
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,720
Forget that Go and freshen up

158
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
By the way, people here are all in panic

159
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
What happened?

160
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,360
I'll tell you Where are all your friends?

161
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
Lost their way, eh?

162
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
They? Lose their way?

163
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,600
In such a small town?

164
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,600
What's the name of the-

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
Mathrabhoomi office

166
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,240
The Mathrabhoomi office?

167
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,840
It's near the Mathrabhoomi office

168
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,160

Oh!

191
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Did he say right or left?

192
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,440
He said two kilometer then right

193
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480

But two kilometers straight and then right

195
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,400
He said two kilometers and then right

196
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,320
Trust me I told you we can find the way back

197
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,040
We can find the way back

198
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,520
Where are we man?

199
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,640

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,040

Let's stop somewhere

203
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,480
'Today's lucky draw Lottery tickets sale'

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,440
Sorry for him He is kind of crazy guy

229
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,320
Artistic Yeah artistic better

230
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,840
That's it! So we told him to come to India

231
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,320
Shoot some footage Documentary

232
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,080
- Come in - Oh sorry yeah

233
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,000
So what plans tonight?

234
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,800
I thought I'd cook and we could have some drinks

235
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,920
Yeah cool And we have cheddar cheese

236
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,280
- Perfect - You like it?

237
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,080
Yeah Yeah

238
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,480
Come lets go

239
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,120
Surya News

240
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,520
'In Siberia of Russia several people got hurt...'

241
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,600
'...in an earthquake that destroyed a number of buildings'

242
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,640
'People wonder if it was related to the event that occurred in Kerala'

243
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,800
I've been performing this research for a long time

244
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,600
What I have understood is that there is a lot of unnatural phenomena

245
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,800
But people here don't notice them

246
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,600
I don't know how to explain it to them either

247
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Recently a small girl fell prey to an incident

248
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
A victim of a close encounter

249
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,560
Close encounter? What's that?

250
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,920
If a person encounters a being from a different planet-life or meets a UFO...

251
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
...Unidentified Flying Object we call it a close encounter

252
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,600
Yeah UFO right?

253
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,600
Yeah you're a fool

254
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,280
I like it

255
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll explain it to you

256
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
Are you saying the child might have seen something like this?

257
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,280
May be I am not sure

258
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,640
I have no proof

259
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,640
You know Serjo people started to experience strange phenomenon from the sixties

260
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,880
Maybe also before I don't know

261
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,240
But have you never heard about alien abductions?

262
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,040
Nope

263
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,360
Hybridizations?

264
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
I don't want to know anything about that

265
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,480
Alien abductions became popular by the Betty and Barney Hill abductions

266
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
And that too in 1961

267
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,560
Yeah, everybody knows about this

268
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,120
I've never heard that I haven't about it at all

269
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,920
The first American couple who claimed they saw aliens

270
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,920
Later similar such incidents were reported in other parts of the world

271
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,160
Roswell incident You never heard about this?

272
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,840
Roswell incident?

273
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,800
Oh come on man What are you talking about?

274
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,520
I think everybody knows the truth

275
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,240
I don't know Andreah I don't know man

276
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,680
Could be but sounds strange

277
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,320
Extraterrestrials have visited earth many years ago

278
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
Few times...they don't show us But you know it's true

279
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,120
Oh stop it!

280
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
Brother, these aliens what are they like to look at?

281
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,600
Have you seen one before?

282
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,120
I don't know I've never seen one before

283
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,560
But recent incidents and witnesses descriptions have led us to believe that...

284
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,240
...they are quite different from us

285
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,040
I don't understand

286
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,840
For example, their eyes could be oval in shape

287
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
Or they could be small eyes

288
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,240
Or have different colors or shapes

289
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Or maybe they just look like us

290
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,280
Who knows how do they look like?

291
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,480
Brother, why haven't you proved any of this?

292
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,040
- Why did you stop teaching? - Stopped teaching?

293
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,880
Did you know?

294
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,560
In Kerala University when I was teaching astronomy classes, I was very enthusiastic

295
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,120
I felt a lot of excitement teaching kids Working in the observatory

296
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,040
When researching alien life forms I used to be amazed

297
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,640
How did the people of ancient times gain so much knowledge...

298
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,440
...of planets and the solar system

299
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
You quit when your brother went missing, right?

300
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,920
I do not know what happened to my brother

301
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,680
My own life had no answers

302
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,680
How do I find answers for someone else?

303
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,200
My brother was everything

304
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,760
He was my every joy and now my sorrow

305
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,160
Later, I wasn't able to even teach

306
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,520
I lost interest in everything

307
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,760
Even to find him

308
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,520
It changed my life completely

309
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,800
You know life has to move on

310
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,840
What is that?

311
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,360
I don't know

312
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
What's happening?

313
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,600
But I don't think this is the right time to find out

314
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Come let's go in Come on

315
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,760
'The mystery of bright lights that have been...'

316
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,880
'...have not yet been solved'

317
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,560
'Witnesses claim that they are multicolored...'

318
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,680
'...and appear in different places at different times'

319
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,120
'In some places they appear to move also'

320
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Hello?

321
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
What?

322
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,080
Where?

323
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,360
When?

324
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,440
Okay! I'm coming right away

325
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,560
Has anyone seen anything?

326
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,920
No, people of the house are terrified having heard sounds, middle of the night

327
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,760
What do you think?

328
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
There are marks as if a sharp instrument was surgically used...

329
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
...but not a drop of blood shed

330
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,600
The entire portion of mouth and internal organs entirely removed

331
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,440
I don't understand this

332
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,840
There was a similar incident reported in Colorado in 1967

333
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,920
A small pony 3 years old Only its skin remained

334
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Nothing could be found out

335
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,840
Later in the US European countries and Indonesia

336
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
And now here

337
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,360
Yes

338
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,400
We need more proofs I mean more information

339
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,080
What more do you want on this?

340
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,600
Have you reported this to the police?

341
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,400
This is happening all over

342
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,560
The news channels have been reporting it big way

343
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,560
Do we have to report it specifically to them now?

344
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,440
Police or channels, what's the use The govt will easily cover it up

345
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,040
I am unable to let it go

346
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,200
People must know why this is happening

347
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
I will come with you

348
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,480
No! I need a person to report to me

349
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,120
You stay back here

350
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,080
Where did you go so early this morning?

351
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,040
'Cattle are dying in large numbers'

352
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,000
'The govt has entrusted a special agency to investigate into this event'

353
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,520
'Officials inform that people must not panic in such incidents'

354
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,320
'The govt will suitably compensate for the loss of cattle'

355
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,920
'Further incidents may be reported to our nearest office says the govt'

356
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,560
'The agriculture minister will visit the places...'

357
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,480
'...of such unfortunate incidents and give a report directly'

358
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,680
'Our special correspondent reports from the site of incident'

359
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,480
'What sort of noises did you hear when cattle were being killed?'

360
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,680
'It was pitch dark'

361
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,600
'A vague form about 6-7 feet high We could not make out what it was'

362
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,760
'Not just in our locality, but over there also People have heard similar sounds'

363
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
'But no one could figure out'

364
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,600
What is going on here?

365
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,040
I'll explain

366
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,040
It was in 1967 that cattle mutilation was first reported

367
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,480
What is it?

368
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
It's a strange phenomenon

369
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,480
Unbelievable incidents

370
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Animals are deprived of their internal organs...

371
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,360
...their blood sucked out but without a single wound

372
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,040
Internal organs are lost and there is no obvious point of entry

373
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,000
You mean removed just like that?

374
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,400
No...I mean yes

375
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,040
There are wound marks like surgery was done but with no trace of blood

376
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,640
And they don't leave any evidence No tracks or marks leading to it

377
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,240
I am unable o believe this I don't believe it

378
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,760
I know it's hard

379
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,640
It's not that it's hard to believe Just things to fool people

380
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,760
It's a hoax guys No, no it's possible

381
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,040
It is possible Believe me it is!

382
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,440
But I don't understand why they do it

383
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,520
I don't know

384
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,080
May be it's a signal for a message or experiment

385
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,280
An experiment?

386
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,800
Yeah, like for hybridization or something else

387
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,720
What are you saying bro? Hybridization... in this 21st century?

388
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
Wait! I'll explain

389
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,000
What is there to explain?

390
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,320
That aliens from mars and Saturn are coming here?

391
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,000
Or that we are going there? Or maybe the earth is coming to an end?

392
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
Explain what?

393
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,840
The truth

394
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,760
No one here may believe what I am about to explain

395
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,920
See...Mexico, Montano Alamosa, Colorado

396
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,280
More than 15 states since 1967 have reported such events

397
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,680
Nearly 130 mutilations is said to have occurred during the 70s

398
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:57,840
Since 2001, more than 200 incidents and it's a fact, it's real it has happened

399
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,760
But what or who did it

400
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,960
I am not sure

401
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,240
But hypotheses suggest visitors from other planets

402
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,560
That means, beings from other planets

403
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,360
Aliens who may have come to collect genetic materials

404
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,480
Anyways their purpose is unknown

405
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,280
But their proximity to earth has always been there

406
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,360
From when is that?

407
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,080
Since ancient Egypt

408
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Haven't you seen pictures of beings with a human body and animal heads?

409
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,680
They say these were also created by God

410
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,200
Are you joking?

411
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,240
That is just a part of their beliefs and rituals

412
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,760
They are baseless There is no evidence

413
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,960
Evidences? How many do you want?

414
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Take the pyramids of Egypt

415
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Researchers have found bones of humans and animals...

416
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
...excavated from a single skeleton

417
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,080
The kings of those times disposed them in such a way that they'd never return

418
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,520
They buried these creatures so that they will never ever rise again

419
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,840
You mean like cloning?

420
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,720
Likely

421
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,320
See, we are in the right stage of re-creating animals and even humans

422
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
But were they...?

423
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,400
So why doesn't people know about this?

424
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,800
Because truth doesn't sound good all the time

425
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,320
Especially in a country like India

426
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,720
With multiple culture, religion and language

427
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,640
- It's hard to pin down - No one would accept that

428
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,400
That's not true Neil

429
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,880
Because there are a lot of people in the world...

430
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,320
...who believe aliens have visited the earth before

431
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,400
Check this

432
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
Maybe they are still here

433
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,360
But why...?

434
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,560
Why would you want to waste your time searching all these strange mysteries?

435
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,080
You don't have to go anywhere It's all around you

436
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,840
You just have to open your eyes and see the big picture

437
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,160
Sorry man!

438
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,560
I think I know where to find my answers

439
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes

440
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,360
Wow!

441
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,960
- What is it? - Banana chips

442
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,360
So good man Wanna try?

443
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,120
I don't know why we don't have this in Italy

444
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,480
It tastes so good

445
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,920
- Banana? - Yes banana

446
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,240
We are finally going to the jungle, right?

447
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,320
Yeah!

448
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,920
Finally Jungle

449
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,040
I don't think this is the best time to go

450
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,960
Come on every time You are so pessimistic man

451
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,960
I am not pessimistic

452
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,800
These days something is wrong here

453
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,080
I don't know what but I have a feeling

454
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,640
You are crazy man

455
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,800
You are crazy too

456
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,160
You guys okay at the back?

457
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Yeah

458
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,640
Where are we going now?

459
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,240
I have to meet a person urgently

460
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,160
A person who has clear thoughts about this

461
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,160
'The cabinet of ministers have decided to suitably...'

462
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,920
'...compensate farmers for the loss of their cattle'

463
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,840
'A special team was designated to investigate...'

464
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,520
'...and report from places of such incidents'

465
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,000
'The special team has collected detailed evidences such events'

466
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,080
'They beg people not to panic but be calm'

467
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,280
'They say these issues are under control...'

468
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,920
'...and the govt has ensured the safety of people'

469
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,680
'But some factions within govt claim that some anti social elements are doing this'

470
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,200
'And yet some others say it is a tactic to distract people'

471
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,120
'...from actual issues at hand'

472
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,360
'Witnesses claim that extremely bright lights...'

473
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,120
'...were seen on the sky at times in many places'

474
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,280
'As a precaution people are advised to stay indoors'

475
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:15,680
Capital M little m here Capital F is equal to little m

476
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,800
N is equal to capital M A constant

477
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:35,200
Newton at that age did not know that its value was divided by r square

478
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,760
R is the distance between 2...

479
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,840
Professor, do you still teach?

480
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,240
Isn't that why still exist? Imparting knowledge

481
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,320
It's been a long time since we last met

482
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,080
You left without a trace

483
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,080
How will I find you in this wide world?

484
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,600
I did leave without telling anything to anyone

485
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,880
You do know the state I was in

486
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,040
Did you get any information about your brother?

487
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
No

488
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,000
But I want to get some information

489
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,040
Some unknown phenomena

490
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,640
Certain things which I have no clue about

491
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,000
I want to know if I am going in the right direction

492
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,960
Regarding?

493
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,160
History, science

494
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,640
It's all about science

495
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,960
Great historians and scientists have left great messages

496
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,600
Sir Isaac Newton, Aryabhatta

497
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,000
Such great minds have spent their entire life...

498
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,200
...trying to find the truth about human evolution

499
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Sir, sorry to interrupt But I really need to know

500
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,200
Are they coming with you?

501
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,760
Yes sir

502
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,680
So they need to know what they are involved in

503
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,600
Involved?

504
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,480
What do you mean by involved?

505
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,600
Take your seat

506
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,280
Life on earth Life on other planets

507
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:05,720
Our solar system Stars, galaxies, constellations

508
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,680
Our scientists have spent their entire lives...

509
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,560
...to gather knowledge for future generations

510
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,320
While we just have a gala time Enjoying worldly pleasures

511
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,200
Not committed to anyone No commitments

512
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,840
Who does not know of such things today?

513
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,080
Solar system galaxies etc

514
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,080
Really?

515
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,680
So who can tell me about our solar system?

516
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,160
Tell us about the planets

517
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,520
You are all educated and well informed I know

518
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,800
As time passes we forget most of it

519
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,720
Which is the largest planet in the solar system?

520
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,280
- Jupiter - Good

521
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,800
Which is the planet nearest the sun?

522
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,480
- Mercury - Very Good

523
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,600
Our earth which is the 3rd planet from the sun and 5th largest...

524
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,480
...out of the 8 planets of solar system

525
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,120
A home to millions of species lies in its habitable zone

526
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,840
Keeping just the right distance from our sun

527
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,280
Any closer to the sun the waters would boil away

528
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,080
And farther away it will freeze

529
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,640
Ideal conditions for life to have evolved

530
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
That's true

531
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,800
The only world where life exists No aliens or extra terrestrials

532
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,960
We are the only living beings on this earth

533
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,320
Says who?

534
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:40,480
Just like we exist here there may be other planets where life may exist

535
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,240
Maybe million of light years away

536
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,560
But life is possible only on planet earth

537
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,200
No, there are millions other planets And millions other constellations

538
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,680
Galaxies

539
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,760
Different colors shapes sizes Thousands even millions

540
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,880
Earth like planets have been found Many of them out there

541
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,200
Scientists prove that life could exist just like ours

542
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,120
May be even advanced than ours

543
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Many times over the past years The Germans, Americans, Russians

544
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,280
May be most of the advanced countries have tried to make contact

545
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,680
Sir, is this in some way related to the red rain

546
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,160
Is it all connected?

547
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,080
I cannot tell you

548
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,640
I can only give you directions I cannot give an answer

549
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,040
But I am sure

550
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,800
You will reach whatever you are looking for...I am very sure

551
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,960
But I am not sure I am not clear about many things

552
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,240
I really need your help

553
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,080
It really doesn't depend on me

554
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,400
Look this job is too tough for an old man like me

555
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,280
But which job?

556
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,000

558
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,520
Really?

559
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,760
What do we do?

560
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,320
Wait, wait

561
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,640

00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,320
A writer, formerly a professor

564
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,240

565
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,320

00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,360

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,520

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,920

00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,920
Silent valley

586
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,880
Mannarkad, Melattoor, Agali, and Ballada where the incidents occurred

587
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,680
All these places close to Silent valley

588
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,960
Incident?

589
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
Have you been there before?

590
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,880
Yes, once with grandfather

591
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,120
Yeah, so we are out of water eh?

592
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,360
Yeah Let's stop

593
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,760
- Pull over - What timing

594
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,000
I am cool man

595
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,480

597
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,680

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,760
- Hey man - What's up?

599
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,400
I don't know

600
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,640
I don't have a good feeling about this trip

601
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,840
What? Why?

602
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,880
I don't know

603
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,760
Something is going wrong

604
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,480
What are you doing about it man?

605
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,840
What's happened?

606
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,320
Leave it Doesn't matter

607
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,760
Do you have that whiskey in there man?

608
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,040
Yes of course it's in there

609
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,320
- Which side? - Its inside

610
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,520
Are you kidding me? Do you want to drink now?

611
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,960
Just want a shot man Open it please

612
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,360
- Really - Yeah

613
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,560
Okay

614
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,560
Hold this

615
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,920
I'll drive

616
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,680
Why helicopters?

617
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,240
I think the air force is involved

618
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,160
Air force?

619
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,320
They would have got orders from higher ups

620
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,400
What actually is happening here?

621
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,280
I can't believe it

622
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,840
Are you okay?

623
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,920
Yeah

624
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,880
I heard about your brother

625
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,560
Do you have hope you'll meet him again?

626
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,160
I don't know

627
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,040
We will meet I do have a hope

628
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,480
- I feel so hungry man - Yeah, me too man

629
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,920
So hungry!

630
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,440
Why are there so many helicopters?

631
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,840
I don't know

632
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,480
It's a protected area

633
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,560
Sounds good

634
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,600
I think they'll keep quiet until everything settles down

635
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,680
That's exactly what they want No one to be involved

636
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,040
So many incidents

637
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,440
But do we ever get to know any of them?

638
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,320
- Conspiracy theories - Not just theories

639
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,640
Some evidences are erased through generations...

640
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,800
...and some are kept, never revealed

641
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,280
Actually what do you believe Jai?

642
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,280
Me?

643
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,400
Every stage of civilization, our forefathers have got...

644
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,800
...such messages and experiences from aliens for sure

645
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,640
A message from sky people

646
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,160
It's closed, visiting time is over You are not allowed inside

647
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,880
Let me speak to your officer

648
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,200
They won't allow you It's of no use

649
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,200
We are biologists come for research Just

650
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,320
2 minutes I will have a word and return

651
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,720
I said it was not possible, didn't I?

652
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,600
What's happening?

653
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,080
I don't know

654
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,480
Sir, they have come for a pass to go in

655
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,440
It's closed No more passes

656
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,040
- But sir - We have strict orders

657
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,360
We are coming from very far We can't go back now

658
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
We don't have the authority to give permission

659
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,040
There are some foreigners inside their vehicle

660
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,840
Then you must submit their ID proof and passports

661
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,800
All that is a pain

662
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,640
You can't go into the jungle with them

663
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,400
If anything happens I'll be in deep trouble

664
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,560
He's coming back

665
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,640
I don't think he has got permission

666
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,440
So what do we do now?

667
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,920
- Just go back - I think

668
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,640
I think we should go home

669
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,960
It doesn't make sense to go home now

670
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,080
I don't know I don't have a good feeling

671
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,520
Same here man

672
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,080
What happened?

673
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,040
Jai! What are you doing?

674
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,240
Brother what are you up to? Are you crazy?

675
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,520
Stop the vehicle

676
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,000
They will follow us, for sure man

677
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,920
Who sent them inside?

678
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,560
- They opened the check post - Go follow them

679
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,160
Oh my God

680
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,800
Brother what are you doing?

681
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,880
Where do you want to go man?

682
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,080
I don't know Let's see

683
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,160
Sorry guys

684
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,840
What do you mean you are sorry man?

685
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,920
Didn't I say this was not a good idea?

686
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,680
What am I supposed to do?

687
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,360
What is your intention bro? This is a restricted area

688
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,080
I know but I can't go back I must find out for myself

689
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,920
You can return if you want

690
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,760
Here

691
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,880
If you guys want to leave please leave

692
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,640
'They would not have gone too far'

693
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,400
I don't want to go inside I want to go back

694
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,680
You can't go back now Its too late

695
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,320
I'm not going in any further

696
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,280
This was not our plan It's too dangerous

697
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,080
We are almost there Please!

698
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,960
This is a forest You could get killed

699
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Look I must find out We are on the verge of first contact

700
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,800
What is your intention? Get us all killed?

701
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,720
Look at them Now they are also in trouble

702
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,400
And now we don't know what's going to happen

703
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,600
Look there

704
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,360
Check post officials will soon be here looking for us, but I must go

705
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,840
Forest officials will surely arrest us

706
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,240
I will not be a part of this any more

707
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,480
Sir, we found the vehicle

708
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,800
Yes

709
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,280
Contact emergency search department

710
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,640
Inform all local stations I need the report now

711
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,160
Just keep walking

712
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,160
Track them

713
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:40,400
I need all data, travel route last stop, phone calls and addresses

714
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,960
I think I saw something there

715
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,800
What?! Are you trying to scare me man?

716
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,520
No, I saw a movement

717
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,600
There is something there

718
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,520
Come Let's move

719
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Andreah

- Are you okay? - Something bit me

01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,400
Oh man! Wait!

01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,360

01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,120
- It's so red - No man

725
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,000
Don't touch Wait, wait!

726
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,320
- Painful - Painful?

728
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,400

729
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,120
- What's that? - I don't know

730
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,880
May be an insect bite

731
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,800
I've never seen something like this

732
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,560
There are some unknown bacteria in this place

733
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,920
What kind of bacteria?

734
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,000
I've read an article written by grandpa

735
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,400
It's relating to some kind of unknown bacteria

736
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,680
In 2001 there was news of a strange happening

737
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,400
A big ball of fire fell to earth and created panic among people

738
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,760
It was there in the media Remember?

739
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,560
No What was it?

740
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,880
Some people said something came down to earth from the sky

741
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,840
Others said it was a comet

742
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,040
Have you heard of Theory of Panspermia?

743
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,280
They say an asteroid may have struck earth 1000s of years ago...

744
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,480
...from which life originated

745
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,080
- I don't understand - I'll tell you

746
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,240
The phenomenon of red rain in 2001

747
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,440
It was big news

748
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,000
When researchers examined samples what they found was unbelievable

749
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,320
What was it?

750
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,160
Extraterrestrial cells They were alive

751
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,240
Yes, I remember

752
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,600
My grandpa had got in touch with higher authority in relation to it

753
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,320
But that context did not move forward

754
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Professor went ahead with its research on his own

755
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,120
Are these incidents related to the red rains?

756
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,080
Who knows?

757
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,440
But may be something happened Alien life would have seeded

758
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,280
So quickly?

759
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,400
We can't say It's possible but I'm not sure

760
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,400
The bacteria may have settled here through the red rain

761
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,760
Or through some other means

762
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,440
Maybe reached earth directly from the sky

763
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,640
In fact...

764
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,480
...no one knows the truth

765
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,840
I'll take your bag, okay man

766
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,120
Let's go

767
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Andreah

768
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,280
Come on

769
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,240
Hey?! Can we stop?

770
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,840
I have to stop

771
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,840
Okay

772
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,840
Let's try to camp somewhere

773
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,960
It's getting dark

774
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,120
Great!

775
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,800
Why don't we light a fire? There might be wild animals

776
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,720
- I will go get some firewood - I'll go with you

777
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,640
Have you got a lighter?

778
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,880
- Yep - Perfect

779
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,520
What happened? Are you okay?

780
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
I'm afraid of darkness

781
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,560
- Serjo - What man?

782
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,640
- Did you hear that? - No

783
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,800
Crap!

784
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,280
Let's go Let's go back

785
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,480
- Hurts? - Yeah man

786
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,400
Let me see

787
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,040
Slow

788
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,720
- It's so red man - Yeah

789
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,160
I cannot even rotate my neck

790
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,960
We have to do something

791
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,640
We can't go on like this

792
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,640
What can we do?

793
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,960
I don't know

794
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,040
Go to a doctor or something

795
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,520
Where do I find a doctor here?

796
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,600
I know

797
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,640
Tomorrow may be its okay

798
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,120
- Let's see - I hope man

799
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,840
Brother, you have studied the stars, right?

800
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,680
Yes

801
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,240
Why are those 3 stars in the same line?

802
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,640
Do you know its name?

803
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,440
No

804
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,000
The Orion constellation

805
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,280
I used to sit with my brother and gaze at stars as boys

806
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,280
You really miss him

807
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:20,640
Yes

808
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,400
He used to talk about the Egyptian superstitions

809
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,800
They believed the Gods came down from the stars on earth and life originated

810
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,880
Haven't you seen the pyramids?

811
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,400
They are based on these stars

812
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,800
- You mean the great pyramids - Yes the great pyramids

813
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,600
Helicopters!

814
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,160
- Come, put this fire off - No! No! What?!

815
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,360
You can't do this

816
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,520
- Where are you going? - Please stop it

817
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,480
Do you see anything Serjo?

818
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,640
What are you doing? Are you mad?

819
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,440
Help!

820
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,720

821
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,840
- Somebody help! - Neha don't run

822
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,280

01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,160
- Shall I help you? - I got it

824
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,680
- Is the camera on? - Yeah

825
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,960
Okay, quiet

826
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,800

- Where are they? - I don't know man

830
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,080
- Hello we are here - Sh! Are you crazy?

831
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,240
- What am I supposed to do? - Don't shout

832
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,160
Be quiet

833
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,880
Quiet

01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,440
- One second - What?

01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,240
- Neil - Don't shout

01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,120
Wait, wait! Just see if he has fallen down

What are you talking about? You can't go alone

867
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,120
You cannot go alone

868
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,480

You don't understand

We could have died out there

886
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,440
I didn't know Neha

887
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,240

And you ask us to stop and stay calm?

But I don't know

Zoom back

926
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,080
Looks like an old house

927
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,280

Watch out for the ground

932
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,480
Oh my God It looks so scary

933
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,480
This room is empty

934
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,640

Sit

969
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,440
It's out of our hands

970
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,400
In the middle of now where I really don't know what to do

971
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,560

977
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,240

979
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,800

980
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,200

981
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:17,160
It's so red man You have to go to a doctor man

982
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,920
I hear something

983
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,480
Look guys a helicopter

984
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,000
Where are they?

985
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,280
- Oh my God! - It's gone

986
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,360
We lost it

987
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,520
What do we do now?

988
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,600
Andreah?

989
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,440
You okay man?

990
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:00,920
'Holding us anxious and on tenterhooks The phenomenon finally appeared in the sky'

991
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,960
'It is in a state of continuous movement'

992
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,440
'To witness this rare event people Look up with eyes glued to the sky'

993
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:12,160
'Arousing wonder and fear to both the world of science and the human race...'

994
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,640
'...the phenomenon is now up there in the sky'

995
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,200
Mr Jai Please come

996
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,960
What I am sharing with you today...

997
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,400
...may not agree with our intelligence and logic

998
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,240
We are all living in a world of imagination

999
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:58,320
A world we have created for ourselves

1000
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,720
Where the very laws of nature...

1001
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,320
...are different, hypothetical and self contained

1002
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,400
When our imagination clashes with reality...

1003
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:29,480
...we come across things and thoughts we can't fathom

1004
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,680
Something that you cannot accept

1005
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:51,280
That's when we must decide whether to believe or not believe in it!
