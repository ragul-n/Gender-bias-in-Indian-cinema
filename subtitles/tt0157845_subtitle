1
05:03:48,668 --> 05:03:51,796
'Hail Bajrangbali!
- Hail! '

2
05:04:10,223 --> 05:04:15,183
"O' Maruti!
- O' Maruti!"

3
05:04:15,328 --> 05:04:20,664
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

4
05:04:20,800 --> 05:04:25,669
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

5
05:04:25,805 --> 05:04:31,175
"The devotion of the entire world... "

6
05:04:31,311 --> 05:04:36,305
"The devotion of the entire world
is contained in your eyes. "

7
05:04:36,449 --> 05:04:38,679
"O' Maruti!"

8
05:04:38,852 --> 05:04:44,119
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

9
05:04:44,491 --> 05:04:46,322
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

10
05:04:46,493 --> 05:04:48,859
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

11
05:04:49,195 --> 05:04:51,561
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

12
05:04:51,698 --> 05:04:55,134
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

13
05:05:10,550 --> 05:05:13,485
"You had set fire to Lanka. "

14
05:05:13,620 --> 05:05:15,781
"You had set fire!
You had set fire!"

15
05:05:15,922 --> 05:05:18,686
"You had shaken up Ravan!"

16
05:05:18,825 --> 05:05:21,316
"You had shaken him up.
You had shaken him up. "

17
05:05:21,461 --> 05:05:26,558
"By fetching the Sanjeevani
herb... "

18
05:05:26,700 --> 05:05:29,168
"By fetching the Sanjeevani
herb...

19
05:05:29,269 --> 05:05:31,897
...you had saved Lakshman's life. "

20
05:05:32,205 --> 05:05:34,435
"You had saved his life.
You had saved his life. "

21
05:05:34,574 --> 05:05:39,511
"Lord Ram always dwells... "

22
05:05:39,679 --> 05:05:44,742
"Lord Ram always dwells
in your heart. "

23
05:05:44,884 --> 05:05:47,250
"O' valorous one!"

24
05:05:47,520 --> 05:05:52,719
"O' valorous one, the essence of
Ram's tale is in your eyes. "

25
05:05:52,892 --> 05:05:54,757
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

26
05:05:55,228 --> 05:05:57,594
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

27
05:05:57,731 --> 05:06:00,222
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

28
05:06:00,500 --> 05:06:03,697
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

29
05:06:03,837 --> 05:06:08,706
"You are really the
destroyer of plight. "

30
05:06:08,842 --> 05:06:11,572
"You are the destroyer of plight. "

31
05:06:11,711 --> 05:06:16,648
"You have three eyes just
like Lord Shiva. "

32
05:06:16,816 --> 05:06:19,376
"You have three eyes. "

33
05:06:19,519 --> 05:06:24,650
"Whoever you grace with blessings... "

34
05:06:24,791 --> 05:06:27,157
"Whoever you grace with blessings...

35
05:06:27,260 --> 05:06:29,785
...never faces hardships or sorrows. "

36
05:06:29,896 --> 05:06:32,592
"He never faces hardships
or sorrows. "

37
05:06:32,732 --> 05:06:37,601
"The one that destroys worries... "

38
05:06:37,737 --> 05:06:40,103
"The one that destroys worries...

39
05:06:40,206 --> 05:06:42,731
...that sword is under your control. "

40
05:06:42,876 --> 05:06:45,367
"O' Maruti!"

41
05:06:45,745 --> 05:06:51,240
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

42
05:06:51,451 --> 05:06:53,214
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

43
05:06:53,453 --> 05:06:55,751
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

44
05:06:55,889 --> 05:06:58,119
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

45
05:06:58,391 --> 05:07:01,690
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

46
05:07:04,330 --> 05:07:08,426
"Guru is like Brahma. "

47
05:07:09,569 --> 05:07:13,505
"Guru is like Vishnu. "

48
05:07:14,374 --> 05:07:20,472
"Guru is like Shiva. "

49
05:07:22,282 --> 05:07:28,243
"Guru is like Supreme Brahmn. "

50
05:07:30,256 --> 05:07:37,219
"Therefore I bow to Guru. "

51
05:07:38,865 --> 05:07:41,095
You have become a scholar
in Vedas, scriptures...

52
05:07:41,201 --> 05:07:44,102
...and become expert in combat
with weapons, missiles...

53
05:07:44,204 --> 05:07:45,228
...and have acquired other skills.

54
05:07:46,172 --> 05:07:48,834
Now go back to Anjani, your mother.

55
05:07:50,810 --> 05:07:55,372
Master, give me a chance to serve
and repay you as my Guru.

56
05:07:56,182 --> 05:08:03,179
Dear, the sorrow of my life is
my unruly son Shani.

57
05:08:03,690 --> 05:08:09,287
Bring here that disobedient
and wayward son Shani.

58
05:08:09,829 --> 05:08:11,353
Hail Gurudev!

59
05:08:22,175 --> 05:08:25,144
Hey ape! I am Somdev.

60
05:08:25,411 --> 05:08:28,244
Without permission why are you
going towards the solar system?

61
05:08:28,515 --> 05:08:29,880
Where can I find Lord Shani?

62
05:08:30,183 --> 05:08:32,151
The entire world will
burn to ashes...

63
05:08:32,252 --> 05:08:34,447
...if Lord Shani gazes
at it in anger!

64
05:08:34,587 --> 05:08:37,317
Why do you want to lose
your life? Go back.

65
05:08:37,524 --> 05:08:40,084
The goal of Hanuman's life
is to complete the task.

66
05:08:40,460 --> 05:08:41,518
Move aside from my path!

67
05:08:50,370 --> 05:08:54,431
Attention! I am Mangal,
the Lord of War!

68
05:08:55,608 --> 05:08:57,838
Where is Lord Shani?

69
05:08:58,478 --> 05:09:01,538
I am feeling suffocated!

70
05:09:03,183 --> 05:09:04,616
Loosen your grip! Loosen your grip!

71
05:09:04,717 --> 05:09:06,742
First tell me where
is Shani's abode?

72
05:09:06,886 --> 05:09:09,411
Shani's abode is over there.

73
05:09:23,770 --> 05:09:26,295
I am Lohmani, mistress
of Lord Shani.

74
05:09:26,506 --> 05:09:29,270
My wrath can destroy you!

75
05:09:29,509 --> 05:09:30,533
Go back!

76
05:09:31,177 --> 05:09:33,873
Hanuman never retreats.

77
05:09:46,492 --> 05:09:51,293
TamRamayi will give you unlimited
wealth if you go back.

78
05:09:51,464 --> 05:09:54,558
Hanuman wants enmity, not wealth.

79
05:10:05,211 --> 05:10:07,839
You can never find success
while Rajatmayi is there!

80
05:10:08,481 --> 05:10:11,712
Hanuman knows how to turn
negative into positive.

81
05:10:23,529 --> 05:10:26,794
I am Swarnamayi, beloved
of Lord Shani.

82
05:10:27,667 --> 05:10:29,134
Humans tremble on
hearing the names...

83
05:10:29,235 --> 05:10:32,432
...of 71/2 years of misfortune
and Lord Shani.

84
05:10:32,772 --> 05:10:34,239
Still you have reached this place.

85
05:10:34,674 --> 05:10:35,698
That's praiseworthy!

86
05:10:35,842 --> 05:10:37,275
I forgive you.

87
05:10:37,510 --> 05:10:40,308
Go away! Save your life!

88
05:10:41,848 --> 05:10:44,817
I can take your life with one blow!

89
05:10:45,852 --> 05:10:49,379
But an avowed celibate would
never touch a woman!

90
05:10:49,522 --> 05:10:52,252
You coward, you need guts
to even touch a woman!

91
05:10:53,126 --> 05:10:54,150
Run away!

92
05:10:54,327 --> 05:10:56,625
Or else I will turn you into an
insect and crush you under this!

93
05:11:00,633 --> 05:11:02,191
Hail Gurudev!

94
05:11:06,139 --> 05:11:07,163
Let me go!
- Mangal!

95
05:11:07,473 --> 05:11:08,667
Let me go!
- Keep her trapped under this!

96
05:11:08,808 --> 05:11:09,832
O' valorous one; let me go!

97
05:11:10,143 --> 05:11:11,235
Let me go, O' valorous
one! Let me go!

98
05:11:11,344 --> 05:11:12,470
If she escapes...

99
05:11:13,279 --> 05:11:14,473
Let me go, O' valorous
one! Let me go!

100
05:11:14,580 --> 05:11:15,672
I got it! I got it!
- Let me go!

101
05:11:15,815 --> 05:11:18,477
You were born on a Tuesday.
- Let me go.

102
05:11:21,688 --> 05:11:22,712
What?

103
05:11:23,656 --> 05:11:26,625
Did the Lord of Death
refuse to take your life?

104
05:11:27,427 --> 05:11:29,554
Is that why you have
come to Lord Shani?

105
05:11:30,229 --> 05:11:34,563
Who are you, seeking
an untimely death?

106
05:11:35,768 --> 05:11:37,326
Hanuman, the disciple of Lord Sun.

107
05:11:38,504 --> 05:11:40,870
Lord Saturn, you have
got all the powers.

108
05:11:42,508 --> 05:11:43,532
You have all the qualities.

109
05:11:43,810 --> 05:11:47,644
But your biggest bad trait is
disobedience to your father.

110
05:11:48,181 --> 05:11:51,582
Lord Shani, it is a grave
sin to hurt him.

111
05:11:52,518 --> 05:11:54,884
I have come to take
you to your father.

112
05:11:55,254 --> 05:11:59,156
Stupid! Don't you know that
when Shani casts a glance...

113
05:11:59,258 --> 05:12:03,217
...at someone, he burns to
ashes that very instant?

114
05:12:03,563 --> 05:12:05,895
Hanuman was born to serve others.

115
05:12:06,232 --> 05:12:08,166
Because of my wrath...

116
05:12:08,267 --> 05:12:12,829
...even the venerated Lord
Ganesh's head was cut off!

117
05:12:13,873 --> 05:12:16,171
For Hanuman, nothing
is more important...

118
05:12:16,275 --> 05:12:18,539
...than following Guru's order.

119
05:12:18,678 --> 05:12:19,906
Then burn to ashes!

120
05:12:34,594 --> 05:12:38,928
You can't be burnt? Then
I will sit on your head!

121
05:12:41,501 --> 05:12:43,230
Well, get me off your back
if you have the power!

122
05:12:44,237 --> 05:12:46,262
An avowed celibate!

123
05:12:55,782 --> 05:12:56,806
Please let me go!

124
05:12:57,216 --> 05:13:00,185
Let me go! Please
let me go, Hanuman!

125
05:13:00,553 --> 05:13:02,817
Let me go!
- Lord Ape! Please save me!

126
05:13:03,189 --> 05:13:04,213
Please save me!

127
05:13:04,323 --> 05:13:05,881
She is trying to escape!

128
05:13:06,526 --> 05:13:09,324
Say that you will apologise
to your father!

129
05:13:09,529 --> 05:13:10,894
Yes, I will.

130
05:13:11,597 --> 05:13:13,258
That you will not burn anybody.

131
05:13:13,866 --> 05:13:15,527
That you will not harass anybody.

132
05:13:15,802 --> 05:13:17,895
That you will not sit
on anybody's head!

133
05:13:19,205 --> 05:13:23,164
I will not trouble in
anyway those people...

134
05:13:23,276 --> 05:13:25,710
...who venerate you on Saturdays.

135
05:13:26,245 --> 05:13:27,542
I will not trouble them in anyway!

136
05:13:27,647 --> 05:13:28,671
Now please get me down!

137
05:13:29,215 --> 05:13:31,615
I too will not trouble
anybody! I won't!

138
05:13:32,218 --> 05:13:34,186
O' Lord Ape, I too will not
trouble those people...

139
05:13:34,287 --> 05:13:36,687
...who venerate you on Tuesdays.

140
05:13:36,823 --> 05:13:37,847
Now let us go.

141
05:13:41,461 --> 05:13:45,329
Shani, my son, your arrogance
has been destroyed.

142
05:13:46,299 --> 05:13:47,732
Your anger has come under control.

143
05:13:48,501 --> 05:13:50,230
Today I am very happy.

144
05:13:50,770 --> 05:13:54,137
Father, I promise you that
in future anyone at whom...

145
05:13:54,240 --> 05:13:56,140
...I cast an auspicious glance...

146
05:13:56,242 --> 05:14:00,508
...will be showered with
wealth and prosperity.

147
05:14:01,247 --> 05:14:02,874
Bajrangbali is witness.

148
05:14:03,850 --> 05:14:08,446
Dear Bajrangbali, you have
repaid the debt of Guru.

149
05:14:08,721 --> 05:14:10,154
You are praiseworthy!

150
05:14:10,690 --> 05:14:14,888
Go; Anjani, your mother
must be waiting for you.

151
05:14:15,561 --> 05:14:16,892
Hail Gurudev!

152
05:14:17,697 --> 05:14:19,460
Brother Shani, salutations.

153
05:14:19,599 --> 05:14:21,658
Hail Bajrangbali!

154
05:14:31,811 --> 05:14:33,711
Oh, Maruti!

155
05:14:35,214 --> 05:14:37,182
Hey, you have grown up so much...

156
05:14:37,283 --> 05:14:38,545
...but you are still as naughty!

157
05:14:38,818 --> 05:14:42,379
Mother, can one ever forget
childhood traits?

158
05:14:42,555 --> 05:14:44,853
Oh, you have become
very knowledgeable!

159
05:14:45,157 --> 05:14:48,126
Mother, it is said in Rig Veda
that even great scholars...

160
05:14:48,227 --> 05:14:50,491
...are nothing compared to a mother!

161
05:14:50,630 --> 05:14:53,190
Stop it! Stop it! My evil
eye may affect you!

162
05:14:54,233 --> 05:14:57,327
Son, eat something; you will have
to go to Mount Hrishyamuk.

163
05:14:57,503 --> 05:14:58,527
Why, mother?

164
05:14:58,771 --> 05:15:02,138
Sugreev's elder brother Vali has
banished him from the kingdom...

165
05:15:02,241 --> 05:15:03,708
...and has taken away his wife.

166
05:15:04,343 --> 05:15:08,404
Due to fear, poor Sugreev is hiding
in the caves of Mount Hrishyamuk.

167
05:15:08,915 --> 05:15:13,511
Go and help him and make efforts
to unite him with his wife.

168
05:15:14,353 --> 05:15:16,344
Mother, you have said
what was in my mind.

169
05:15:16,556 --> 05:15:19,650
I am waiting for a chance
to help someone.

170
05:15:19,859 --> 05:15:21,884
Let us go right away.
- No, son.

171
05:15:22,595 --> 05:15:26,156
I will spend my time here
worshipping Lord Shiva.

172
05:15:26,532 --> 05:15:27,556
You should go.

173
05:15:27,800 --> 05:15:29,700
But what if you need me?

174
05:15:30,536 --> 05:15:32,697
Do come when I think of you.

175
05:15:33,239 --> 05:15:34,365
As you wish, mother.

176
05:15:35,308 --> 05:15:36,798
May Lord Shiva protect you!

177
05:15:37,243 --> 05:15:39,370
Lord, what kind of justice is this?

178
05:15:39,545 --> 05:15:41,638
Only women are punished!

179
05:15:41,781 --> 05:15:44,215
Here, only women are harassed
and made to cry!

180
05:15:44,517 --> 05:15:48,180
Regarding which woman, the Goddess
is taunting the Gods?

181
05:15:48,487 --> 05:15:49,715
It's surprising!

182
05:15:50,156 --> 05:15:53,125
Cunning Ravan abducted
Sita from Panchvati...

183
05:15:53,225 --> 05:15:58,288
...yet Lord Shiva is asking
as if nothing has happened!

184
05:15:59,332 --> 05:16:01,391
Goddess, what is destined,
is going to happen!

185
05:16:01,767 --> 05:16:03,200
What can I do about it?

186
05:16:03,903 --> 05:16:07,498
Have you taken a vow of
not protecting Goddesses?

187
05:16:07,773 --> 05:16:11,732
Or is it that Lord Shiva doesn't
want to punish his devotee Ravan?

188
05:16:12,678 --> 05:16:16,136
Taking care of a devotee and
punishing an offender...

189
05:16:16,248 --> 05:16:18,443
...both are appropriate tasks.

190
05:16:18,784 --> 05:16:23,312
Offender Ravan is full of pride
for both devotion and power.

191
05:16:23,689 --> 05:16:26,658
He has committed a grave sin
by Goddessously abducting Sita!

192
05:16:26,826 --> 05:16:30,592
No! I am the king of Lanka!

193
05:16:31,597 --> 05:16:37,297
Whatever I avoid doing is vice,
and whatever I do is virtue!

194
05:16:38,437 --> 05:16:43,272
Wicked Lakshman has cut
off my sister's nose!

195
05:16:44,176 --> 05:16:48,670
I will ruin the prestige of Raghu
clan by making Sita my wife!

196
05:16:48,814 --> 05:16:49,838
It is my vow!

197
05:16:50,483 --> 05:16:54,112
My lord, sister Shurpanakha's
nose will not be restored...

198
05:16:54,220 --> 05:16:56,381
...if you make Sita your wife.

199
05:16:57,490 --> 05:17:02,291
Instead, your fame and greatness
will be blemished.

200
05:17:02,662 --> 05:17:07,122
Sister-in-law, are you trying
to enhance brother's fame...

201
05:17:07,233 --> 05:17:09,360
...by teaching him cowardice?

202
05:17:09,502 --> 05:17:10,526
Shurpanakha!

203
05:17:10,670 --> 05:17:11,728
Brother, just remember!

204
05:17:12,505 --> 05:17:15,235
Sister-in-law does not care
for her husband's vow!

205
05:17:15,775 --> 05:17:17,402
She is worried about her status!

206
05:17:18,577 --> 05:17:20,442
She is jealous of a competitor!

207
05:17:21,347 --> 05:17:24,180
Sita might become the chief queen!

208
05:17:24,350 --> 05:17:25,681
I am the king of Lanka!

209
05:17:26,686 --> 05:17:28,881
My goal is revenge!

210
05:17:29,522 --> 05:17:31,649
Tit for tat!

211
05:17:32,591 --> 05:17:36,425
As revenge for my sister,
I will make Sita my wife!

212
05:17:39,765 --> 05:17:40,789
Sita!

213
05:17:49,875 --> 05:17:53,276
Sita, I am the king of Lanka.

214
05:17:54,747 --> 05:17:58,114
If I am displeased, even
celestial nymphs...

215
05:17:58,217 --> 05:18:00,185
...would fall at my feet!

216
05:18:01,153 --> 05:18:04,316
If I wish, celestial damsels
would try to appease me!

217
05:18:05,257 --> 05:18:08,556
If I order, demigod beauties
would offer themselves to me!

218
05:18:10,162 --> 05:18:13,131
But O' bewitchingly beautiful Sita...

219
05:18:13,232 --> 05:18:18,568
...the king of Lanka has lost
his heart to your beauty!

220
05:18:20,172 --> 05:18:22,436
Agree to become my chief queen.

221
05:18:22,908 --> 05:18:24,876
Be the queen of my heart.

222
05:18:26,178 --> 05:18:30,877
Ram will certainly shed the blood
of the arrogant king of Lanka.

223
05:18:31,250 --> 05:18:32,877
Sita, give in to my demand!

224
05:18:33,586 --> 05:18:35,577
I am the king of Lanka!

225
05:18:36,188 --> 05:18:39,817
My anger is like a raging fire!

226
05:18:40,626 --> 05:18:44,562
Despite being helpless, Ram's
wife is no less than a volcano!

227
05:18:45,531 --> 05:18:49,831
Karaaldamsha! Kaalsarpini!
Kunjanaini!

228
05:18:50,469 --> 05:18:53,097
Give harsh treatment to
this obstinate woman...

229
05:18:53,205 --> 05:18:54,604
...to force her to yield!

230
05:18:54,774 --> 05:18:59,473
Force her to chant Ravan's
name instead of Ram's name!

231
05:18:59,678 --> 05:19:01,202
I am the king of Lanka!

232
05:19:07,419 --> 05:19:09,853
I cannot bear to watch
such atrocities!

233
05:19:10,156 --> 05:19:13,216
I will personally protect Sita!
- Wait, Bhavani!

234
05:19:14,426 --> 05:19:18,123
After Ravan's sins cross the limit,
his end is certain...

235
05:19:18,230 --> 05:19:23,668
...with the help of Hanuman and
the power of Ram's arrows.

236
05:19:24,336 --> 05:19:26,327
But when? How?

237
05:19:28,507 --> 05:19:30,236
Lord Ram is wandering somewhere.

238
05:19:30,776 --> 05:19:32,607
Hanuman is roaming around
somewhere else!

239
05:19:32,778 --> 05:19:34,803
Goddess, do not be impatient.

240
05:19:35,748 --> 05:19:36,874
The time of their meeting
is coming near.

241
05:19:56,702 --> 05:19:58,693
'Ram!
- Ram! '

242
05:19:58,838 --> 05:20:00,669
'Ram!
- Ram! '

243
05:20:00,773 --> 05:20:02,673
'Ram!
- Ram! '

244
05:20:02,808 --> 05:20:04,639
'Ram!
- Ram! '

245
05:20:04,777 --> 05:20:06,472
'Ram!
- Ram! '

246
05:20:06,745 --> 05:20:08,474
'Ram!
- Rama! '

247
05:20:08,614 --> 05:20:10,309
'Ram!
- Ram! '

248
05:20:10,482 --> 05:20:12,211
'Ram!
- Rama! '

249
05:20:12,484 --> 05:20:17,717
"O' my mind!"

250
05:20:17,890 --> 05:20:24,625
"O' my mind! Life is a struggle. "

251
05:20:24,763 --> 05:20:32,693
"O' my mind! O my mind,
life is a struggle. "

252
05:20:33,439 --> 05:20:36,431
"Chant, Ram, Rama, Ram!"

253
05:20:36,575 --> 05:20:39,271
"Chant, Ram, Rama, Ram!"

254
05:20:39,445 --> 05:20:42,380
"Chant, Ram, Rama, Ram. "

255
05:20:42,514 --> 05:20:45,074
"Chant, Ram, Rama, Ram!"...

256
05:20:45,184 --> 05:20:53,455
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

257
05:20:53,726 --> 05:21:01,826
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

258
05:21:03,469 --> 05:21:08,839
"He is the mortal world and
He is the heavenly world. "

259
05:21:09,408 --> 05:21:14,675
"He is the earth and He is the sky. "

260
05:21:14,880 --> 05:21:19,840
"He is the earth and He is the sky. "

261
05:21:20,486 --> 05:21:25,856
"He is the eternal Narayan. "

262
05:21:26,225 --> 05:21:31,492
"He is the eternal Om. "

263
05:21:31,730 --> 05:21:36,667
"He is the eternal Om. "

264
05:21:37,503 --> 05:21:42,770
"No other name is a great as this. "

265
05:21:43,208 --> 05:21:47,645
"No other name is a great as this. "

266
05:21:47,780 --> 05:21:50,476
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

267
05:21:50,616 --> 05:21:54,143
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

268
05:21:54,353 --> 05:21:56,253
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

269
05:21:56,388 --> 05:21:58,754
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

270
05:21:58,891 --> 05:22:07,595
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

271
05:22:07,733 --> 05:22:16,198
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

272
05:22:17,543 --> 05:22:22,913
"His deeds are unique
and wonderful!"

273
05:22:23,248 --> 05:22:28,550
"His actions are amazing!"

274
05:22:28,821 --> 05:22:33,849
"His actions are amazing!"

275
05:22:34,560 --> 05:22:42,126
"He lights up the Sun and
the Moon like lamps...

276
05:22:42,234 --> 05:22:45,567
...without a wick or oil. "

277
05:22:45,738 --> 05:22:50,437
"Without a wick or oil. "

278
05:22:51,276 --> 05:22:56,771
"He only fulfils all our desires. "

279
05:22:57,249 --> 05:23:01,515
"He only fulfils all our desires. "

280
05:23:01,653 --> 05:23:04,451
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

281
05:23:04,590 --> 05:23:06,888
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

282
05:23:07,359 --> 05:23:09,793
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

283
05:23:09,928 --> 05:23:12,624
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

284
05:23:12,765 --> 05:23:21,537
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

285
05:23:21,673 --> 05:23:29,580
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

286
05:23:29,715 --> 05:23:32,775
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

287
05:23:32,885 --> 05:23:35,479
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

288
05:23:35,621 --> 05:23:38,556
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

289
05:23:38,690 --> 05:23:41,158
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

290
05:23:41,326 --> 05:23:44,124
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

291
05:23:44,296 --> 05:23:46,628
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

292
05:23:46,765 --> 05:23:49,700
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

293
05:23:49,835 --> 05:23:53,635
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

294
05:23:54,173 --> 05:23:55,197
Devarshi!

295
05:23:56,575 --> 05:23:59,135
I have been passing throughs
this route frequently...

296
05:23:59,244 --> 05:24:03,146
...but God knows why, today I
hear the echo of Ram's name...

297
05:24:03,248 --> 05:24:05,614
...from everything around me!

298
05:24:06,518 --> 05:24:08,145
My mind and body are being
attracted to it...

299
05:24:08,253 --> 05:24:10,881
...just like a magnet attracts iron!

300
05:24:12,191 --> 05:24:14,557
My entire body is thrilled!

301
05:24:14,827 --> 05:24:17,591
Devarshi, I feel as
if I am one with Ram!

302
05:24:18,530 --> 05:24:20,395
Bajrangbali, you are lucky!

303
05:24:20,732 --> 05:24:24,168
You feel this way only when
merciful Ram...

304
05:24:24,269 --> 05:24:28,171
...the gem of the Raghu clan
and son of Dashratha...

305
05:24:28,273 --> 05:24:30,605
...graces you with His blessings.

306
05:24:31,877 --> 05:24:33,572
Lord Ram, son of Dashratha!

307
05:24:34,746 --> 05:24:37,544
Liberator of sinners, Ram,
who liberated Ahilya!

308
05:24:38,617 --> 05:24:41,279
Ram, the destroyer of sins,
the slayer of Tadaka!

309
05:24:42,888 --> 05:24:44,116
Ram, of incomparable strength...,

310
05:24:44,223 --> 05:24:45,850
...who broke Lord Shiva's bow!

311
05:24:47,759 --> 05:24:49,852
Will the Lord meet
this lowly devotee?

312
05:24:50,195 --> 05:24:51,321
Will he appear before me?

313
05:24:51,530 --> 05:24:54,124
Bajrangbali, when Ram's
name is echoing...

314
05:24:54,233 --> 05:24:58,863
...from every pore of your body,
then you will certainly meet Ram!

315
05:25:03,208 --> 05:25:07,235
Today luck favoured me and
I am seeing you in person!

316
05:25:08,514 --> 05:25:11,881
My eyes are satiated!
Shabari feels blessed!

317
05:25:19,525 --> 05:25:21,652
Ram, eat this; it is very sweet!

318
05:25:23,929 --> 05:25:25,157
Mother Shabari, even the margosa
fruits taste sweet...

319
05:25:25,264 --> 05:25:26,288
...if offered with love!

320
05:25:32,237 --> 05:25:34,637
Lakshman, you also eat. Take it.

321
05:25:37,876 --> 05:25:41,471
Lakshman, try it; I have never
eaten such sweet berries!

322
05:25:43,182 --> 05:25:45,742
Brother, they are half-eaten!
By a tribal woman!

323
05:25:46,552 --> 05:25:47,576
Of a low caste person!

324
05:25:47,753 --> 05:25:51,120
Lakshman, a person does not
become worthy or unworthy...

325
05:25:51,223 --> 05:25:54,681
...by birth or caste, but by
his deeds and thoughts.

326
05:25:55,494 --> 05:25:58,122
A person whose deeds and thoughts
are good is worthy...

327
05:25:58,230 --> 05:26:01,666
...whereas whose deeds
are bad, is unworthy.

328
05:26:03,502 --> 05:26:05,129
Mother Shabari, won't
you offer more berries?

329
05:26:05,537 --> 05:26:08,233
Yes, yes! Take this!

330
05:26:10,909 --> 05:26:12,137
Brother, let us go!

331
05:26:12,444 --> 05:26:14,878
Do not forget sister-in-law
while eating berries!

332
05:26:15,714 --> 05:26:16,772
Sister-in-law?

333
05:26:17,516 --> 05:26:18,540
Yes, mother Shabari.

334
05:26:19,518 --> 05:26:22,146
Some wicked man has abducted
your daughter-in-law...

335
05:26:22,254 --> 05:26:23,619
...from Panchvati.

336
05:26:25,524 --> 05:26:26,889
He has abducted daughter-in-law
Sita?

337
05:26:27,726 --> 05:26:28,750
Oh God! Oh God!

338
05:26:36,235 --> 05:26:38,795
Hail Mahadev!
- Hail Mahadev!

339
05:26:38,937 --> 05:26:40,734
Gurudev! Gurudev!

340
05:26:40,872 --> 05:26:42,396
Sugreev, the king of apes is coming!

341
05:26:42,541 --> 05:26:44,372
Sugreev, the king of apes!
- Hail!

342
05:26:45,677 --> 05:26:49,272
Hanuman, it seems that Vali
has conspired to kill me!

343
05:26:49,514 --> 05:26:52,449
He has sent two men in disguise,
carrying bows!

344
05:26:52,684 --> 05:26:54,276
They are coming directly
to this place!

345
05:26:54,519 --> 05:26:55,543
Look!

346
05:26:58,223 --> 05:26:59,850
O' king of apes,
do not suspect them.

347
05:27:00,192 --> 05:27:01,420
They could be travellers also.

348
05:27:01,660 --> 05:27:03,127
No, Hanuman. You are an
expert in finding out...

349
05:27:03,228 --> 05:27:05,423
...the secrets of the enemy.

350
05:27:05,764 --> 05:27:07,288
You only go and find out.

351
05:27:08,166 --> 05:27:09,190
I am going.

352
05:27:13,538 --> 05:27:18,202
According to strategy, it is
better to go in disguise.

353
05:27:19,511 --> 05:27:20,876
God is Truth!

354
05:27:25,851 --> 05:27:27,876
God is Truth!

355
05:27:28,186 --> 05:27:30,154
O' sage, can you tell us
where we can find...

356
05:27:30,255 --> 05:27:32,883
...Sugreev, the king of apes?

357
05:27:35,527 --> 05:27:38,155
It is righteous duty
to help good people...

358
05:27:38,263 --> 05:27:43,394
...to guide those who are lost and
to bring great men together.

359
05:27:44,403 --> 05:27:49,272
But these bows and arrows indicate
that you are warriors.

360
05:27:50,175 --> 05:27:54,111
Despite being in ascetics' attire,
your delicate bodies...

361
05:27:54,212 --> 05:27:56,476
...show that you are princes.

362
05:27:57,482 --> 05:28:03,114
The glory of your face indicate
that you are not ordinary men...

363
05:28:03,221 --> 05:28:04,279
...but divine men!

364
05:28:05,223 --> 05:28:07,214
You are very attractive.

365
05:28:08,360 --> 05:28:11,625
Tell me without hesitation,
to which kingdom you belong.

366
05:28:11,797 --> 05:28:15,494
What is your clan and
who are your parents!

367
05:28:18,637 --> 05:28:23,199
Lakshman, language is
a symbol of knowledge.

368
05:28:23,775 --> 05:28:27,142
Only an eminent scholar
of Vedas and grammar...

369
05:28:27,245 --> 05:28:29,338
...can speak such pure language!

370
05:28:30,916 --> 05:28:33,578
Answer the sage.

371
05:28:34,853 --> 05:28:37,151
O' sage, we are the sons
of king Dashrath...

372
05:28:37,255 --> 05:28:39,450
...of the Raghu clan of Ayodhya.

373
05:28:40,192 --> 05:28:42,683
I am Lakshman; this is my elder
brother Lord Ramchandra.

374
05:28:44,596 --> 05:28:45,824
Lord Ramchandra!

375
05:28:46,531 --> 05:28:48,396
Lord Ram, the son of Dashrath!

376
05:28:50,869 --> 05:28:52,359
Lord Ram!

377
05:28:53,171 --> 05:28:54,661
Hanuman's beloved Ram!

378
05:28:55,340 --> 05:28:56,364
Hail Ram!

379
05:29:05,784 --> 05:29:08,218
Brother Hanuman! Brother Hanuman!

380
05:29:12,657 --> 05:29:15,319
There is a unique attraction
in true affection.

381
05:29:15,761 --> 05:29:17,456
We got separated in childhood.

382
05:29:17,829 --> 05:29:18,853
Today we are meeting again!

383
05:29:19,664 --> 05:29:25,603
O' merciful! You have graced
me with your presence!

384
05:29:26,304 --> 05:29:27,771
I feel proud of my good luck!

385
05:29:28,440 --> 05:29:30,874
Lord, I feel blessed!
I feel blessed!

386
05:29:31,843 --> 05:29:34,141
O' son of Anjani, life
is a combination...

387
05:29:34,246 --> 05:29:36,806
...of union and separation.

388
05:29:37,916 --> 05:29:43,149
Union brings people together,
separation makes you wander!

389
05:29:44,790 --> 05:29:46,815
Lord, you are suffering separation?

390
05:29:48,126 --> 05:29:54,395
Yes. To fulfil father's promise, we
have accepted exile for 14 years.

391
05:29:56,668 --> 05:30:01,264
Janak's daughter Sita, my wife,
was abducted from Panchvati.

392
05:30:03,175 --> 05:30:04,642
We are wandering searching for her.

393
05:30:05,744 --> 05:30:06,836
Searching for Goddess Sita?

394
05:30:07,546 --> 05:30:08,570
Yes, Hanuman.

395
05:30:09,481 --> 05:30:12,245
Mother Shabari has asked us to
meet Sugreev, the king of apes.

396
05:30:12,484 --> 05:30:13,508
I will take you to him immediately.

397
05:30:13,752 --> 05:30:15,720
Both of you sit on my shoulders.

398
05:30:23,595 --> 05:30:26,120
It will be good fortune of Sugreev...

399
05:30:26,231 --> 05:30:28,529
...if he can be of help to the Lord.

400
05:30:29,501 --> 05:30:33,801
One day, a demon was carrying
a woman by the sky route.

401
05:30:34,539 --> 05:30:38,635
The poor woman was weeping and
throwing down her ornaments.

402
05:30:39,778 --> 05:30:42,440
Look at these to see
if they are familiar.

403
05:30:46,651 --> 05:30:47,675
Look, Lakshman! Look!

404
05:30:47,786 --> 05:30:48,810
You also look!

405
05:30:49,254 --> 05:30:52,087
These bangles! These earrings!

406
05:30:52,657 --> 05:30:53,817
These anklets!

407
05:30:54,459 --> 05:30:55,551
Do they belong to Sita?

408
05:30:56,461 --> 05:30:58,725
Brother, I have always touched
sister-in-law's feet.

409
05:30:59,264 --> 05:31:00,288
These are her anklets only.

410
05:31:00,499 --> 05:31:05,664
Come... Come...

411
05:31:05,770 --> 05:31:11,208
These anklets also seem
to feel the separation!

412
05:31:12,644 --> 05:31:13,668
Sita!

413
05:31:15,814 --> 05:31:17,475
Come...

414
05:31:17,616 --> 05:31:18,640
Sita!

415
05:31:19,484 --> 05:31:24,478
"O' carrier of bow, do come now!"

416
05:31:24,656 --> 05:31:29,423
"O' carrier of bow, do come now!"

417
05:31:29,561 --> 05:31:34,328
"Come and see my helplessness. "

418
05:31:34,466 --> 05:31:38,869
"Come and see my helplessness. "

419
05:31:39,271 --> 05:31:43,867
"She is suffering a lot. "

420
05:31:44,175 --> 05:31:48,635
"She is suffering a lot. "

421
05:31:48,747 --> 05:31:53,582
"Your Janaki. "

422
05:31:53,685 --> 05:31:57,382
"Your Janaki. "

423
05:31:58,490 --> 05:32:03,450
"O' carrier of bow, do come now!"

424
05:32:22,280 --> 05:32:26,774
"O' Lord, this is not
the Ashok Grove. "

425
05:32:26,885 --> 05:32:31,345
"O' Lord, this is not
the Ashok Grove. "

426
05:32:31,623 --> 05:32:36,583
"I live in sorrow. "

427
05:32:39,230 --> 05:32:48,195
Despite Ram carrying arrows, I
suffer the assault of taunts. "

428
05:32:48,640 --> 05:32:53,873
"Today I feel despaired of life. "

429
05:32:58,283 --> 05:33:02,743
"Today I feel despaired of life. "

430
05:33:02,854 --> 05:33:06,654
"Your Janaki. "

431
05:33:07,459 --> 05:33:11,327
"Your Janaki. "

432
05:33:12,364 --> 05:33:17,358
"O' carrier of bow, do come now!"

433
05:33:36,321 --> 05:33:41,122
"O' Lord, come and see for yourself. "

434
05:33:41,226 --> 05:33:45,686
"O' Lord, come and see for yourself. "

435
05:33:45,797 --> 05:33:49,858
"What sufferings I am undergoing. "

436
05:33:53,171 --> 05:33:57,665
"Till yesterday, I was
living in palaces. "

437
05:33:57,776 --> 05:34:01,803
"What condition I am in now!"

438
05:34:02,514 --> 05:34:07,645
"She is bearing untold misery. "

439
05:34:11,856 --> 05:34:16,555
"She is bearing untold misery. "

440
05:34:16,661 --> 05:34:20,563
"Your Janaki. "

441
05:34:21,433 --> 05:34:25,267
"Your Janaki. "

442
05:34:26,271 --> 05:34:31,231
"O' carrier of bow, do come now!"

443
05:34:31,342 --> 05:34:35,676
"Come and see my helplessness. "

444
05:34:35,780 --> 05:34:40,444
"She is suffering a lot. "

445
05:34:40,552 --> 05:34:45,216
"She is suffering a lot. "

446
05:34:45,323 --> 05:34:49,783
"Your Janaki. "

447
05:34:49,894 --> 05:34:54,228
"Your Janaki. "

448
05:34:54,666 --> 05:34:59,626
"Your Janaki. "

449
05:35:00,739 --> 05:35:02,707
Please free me from Vali's fear.

450
05:35:02,907 --> 05:35:05,740
What can brother do without
knowing Vali's offence?

451
05:35:06,311 --> 05:35:10,145
Forcibly keeping someone else's
wife is not only an offence...

452
05:35:10,248 --> 05:35:12,546
...but a grave sin also.

453
05:35:12,851 --> 05:35:15,149
Vali has committed the
same sin by snatching...

454
05:35:15,253 --> 05:35:17,153
...the wife of Sugreev,
the king of apes...

455
05:35:17,255 --> 05:35:19,348
...and by banishing him
from the kingdom.

456
05:35:20,358 --> 05:35:25,318
Brother's wife, daughter-in-law,
sister and daughter are the same.

457
05:35:25,864 --> 05:35:28,162
The sin cannot be destroyed
unless you kill the sinner...

458
05:35:28,266 --> 05:35:31,292
...who casts lustful eyes on them.

459
05:35:32,237 --> 05:35:37,641
Only he, who pierces these 7 trees
with single arrow, can kill Vali.

460
05:35:49,187 --> 05:35:50,779
Lord Ram, I have confidence in you.

461
05:35:53,258 --> 05:35:57,126
With the fire as witness, I
take oath that I will send...

462
05:35:57,228 --> 05:36:00,129
...the army of apes to the
corners of the earth...

463
05:36:00,231 --> 05:36:02,256
...to search for Goddess sita.

464
05:36:03,268 --> 05:36:06,135
Ram also takes oath that
I will kill evil Vali...

465
05:36:06,237 --> 05:36:09,638
...and establish Sugreev on
the throne of Kishkindha.

466
05:36:11,209 --> 05:36:13,404
My friend, challenge
Vali for a duel!

467
05:36:14,779 --> 05:36:16,804
Hey, Vali!

468
05:36:17,682 --> 05:36:21,743
O' wicked man, hiding
behind a woman's veil!

469
05:36:23,188 --> 05:36:24,280
Come out! - Where are you?

470
05:36:26,324 --> 05:36:27,882
So it's you, O' coward Sugreev!

471
05:36:28,293 --> 05:36:30,386
That's why you have come
to embrace death!

472
05:36:30,862 --> 05:36:32,489
Beware!

473
05:37:37,729 --> 05:37:39,162
Ram!

474
05:38:11,496 --> 05:38:16,365
Father! Father!

475
05:38:26,911 --> 05:38:34,317
It is my good fortune
to die at your hands.

476
05:38:35,553 --> 05:38:42,152
Please take my son Angad
under your care.

477
05:38:42,460 --> 05:38:48,592
Ram! Ram! Ram!
- Father!

478
05:38:49,200 --> 05:38:54,832
It is your duty to search all
over the earth and find Sita.

479
05:38:55,540 --> 05:38:59,101
Whoever returns without
finding Sita...

480
05:38:59,210 --> 05:39:02,668
...will be beheaded along
with his family!

481
05:39:03,348 --> 05:39:06,545
This is the tradition of the
ape clan. Remember that!

482
05:39:10,488 --> 05:39:12,217
Lord, give us permission to leave.

483
05:39:12,857 --> 05:39:14,119
You have permission.

484
05:39:15,526 --> 05:39:16,550
Hanuman!

485
05:39:20,231 --> 05:39:21,255
Lord!

486
05:39:22,834 --> 05:39:26,133
But how will Goddess believe
me when I meet her...

487
05:39:26,237 --> 05:39:28,296
...that I am your servant?

488
05:39:32,710 --> 05:39:33,734
Take this ring.

489
05:39:35,680 --> 05:39:39,148
When you meet Sita, tell her...

490
05:39:39,183 --> 05:39:42,084
...that Ram's body is at Hrishyamuk...

491
05:39:42,186 --> 05:39:45,087
...his mind is with his life...

492
05:39:45,189 --> 05:39:50,559
...and God knows where
his life-force Sita is!

493
05:39:53,197 --> 05:39:55,165
The search for Sita
is a righteous task.

494
05:39:55,767 --> 05:39:59,294
Lord, a righteous task will always
be successfully accomplished.

495
05:39:59,704 --> 05:40:00,728
Hail Lord Ram!

496
05:40:03,641 --> 05:40:05,768
Apes will always remain apes!

497
05:40:06,411 --> 05:40:12,179
You should have directly come
to Sampati and asked him!

498
05:40:13,351 --> 05:40:16,115
Then you would have
come to know that...

499
05:40:16,220 --> 05:40:18,745
...Ravan has abducted Sita.

500
05:40:19,590 --> 05:40:20,716
She is in Lanka.

501
05:40:22,326 --> 05:40:24,226
I have become old.

502
05:40:24,796 --> 05:40:30,132
Otherwise, not just 100 miles,
but I would have flown across...

503
05:40:30,234 --> 05:40:35,365
...even 1000 miles across the ocean
to bring back mother Sita.

504
05:40:37,575 --> 05:40:42,239
Prince Angad, you are a young man.

505
05:40:42,780 --> 05:40:48,343
I can fly across the sea, but
I am doubtful if I can return.

506
05:40:48,753 --> 05:40:50,277
Then who will go?

507
05:40:50,388 --> 05:40:52,447
How will we locate Sita?

508
05:40:52,557 --> 05:40:54,354
With what face will we
go before Lord Ram?

509
05:40:54,459 --> 05:40:56,359
What answer will we give
to uncle Sugreev?

510
05:40:56,461 --> 05:40:58,429
He will cut off the heads of us all!

511
05:40:58,796 --> 05:41:01,765
Even our wives will be put to death!

512
05:41:01,866 --> 05:41:04,767
Even our children will be killed!

513
05:41:04,869 --> 05:41:07,167
Our lives will be ruined!

514
05:41:07,438 --> 05:41:09,531
It will be better if we drown
ourselves in the sea!

515
05:41:12,243 --> 05:41:13,267
Where is Hanuman?

516
05:41:17,148 --> 05:41:20,174
It's a cause for worry that even
Hanuman has become silent!

517
05:41:23,688 --> 05:41:25,781
Bajrangbali, why are you silent?

518
05:41:25,890 --> 05:41:27,790
You are very intelligent!

519
05:41:27,892 --> 05:41:30,554
You are very clever and valorous!

520
05:41:30,661 --> 05:41:31,719
You have to take the initiative.

521
05:41:31,829 --> 05:41:34,525
You alone can save our families
from certain death.

522
05:41:34,632 --> 05:41:36,691
You alone can protect our
families and children.

523
05:41:36,801 --> 05:41:39,463
You alone can save us from
this serious problem.

524
05:41:39,570 --> 05:41:40,730
Protect us, O son of
the God of winds!

525
05:41:40,838 --> 05:41:42,135
Have mercy on us, O valorous one!

526
05:41:42,240 --> 05:41:43,673
Bajrangbali!

527
05:41:45,843 --> 05:41:56,219
"Wake up now... O son of Anjani!"

528
05:41:56,787 --> 05:42:06,253
"Start on the way to Lanka. "

529
05:42:06,931 --> 05:42:17,307
"O valorous one from the past!"

530
05:42:18,242 --> 05:42:25,842
"Do create the present. "

531
05:42:26,884 --> 05:42:35,519
"All of us are deeply worried. "

532
05:42:36,294 --> 05:42:43,291
"Go and get news of mother. "

533
05:42:44,268 --> 05:42:52,403
"Dispel the sorrows
of the miserable. "

534
05:42:53,344 --> 05:43:03,720
"You are known as destroyer
of troubles. "

535
05:43:04,555 --> 05:43:06,682
"Try to remember... "

536
05:43:06,857 --> 05:43:11,556
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

537
05:43:11,662 --> 05:43:15,826
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

538
05:43:15,933 --> 05:43:20,563
"There was speed of lightning. "

539
05:43:20,671 --> 05:43:24,835
"There was speed of lightning
in your wonderful childhood!"

540
05:43:24,942 --> 05:43:29,572
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

541
05:43:29,680 --> 05:43:34,242
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

542
05:43:42,693 --> 05:43:47,323
"The world was wonderstruck
on watching your flight!"

543
05:43:47,431 --> 05:43:51,629
"You had shaken up the sky!"

544
05:43:51,736 --> 05:43:56,196
"For you, the sky was an arena!"

545
05:43:56,307 --> 05:43:58,400
"It was an arena!"

546
05:43:58,509 --> 05:44:02,741
"You defeated in a moment,
whoever challenged you!"

547
05:44:02,847 --> 05:44:04,815
"You defeated in a moment!"

548
05:44:04,915 --> 05:44:09,375
"You had dashed at the sun
at lightning speed!"

549
05:44:09,487 --> 05:44:13,821
"You hid the sun in your mouth!"

550
05:44:13,924 --> 05:44:18,224
"You ate up the raging
ball of fire!"

551
05:44:18,329 --> 05:44:20,490
"Yes, the ball of fire!"

552
05:44:20,598 --> 05:44:24,762
"The universe was shaken up
on witnessing your prowess!"

553
05:44:24,869 --> 05:44:29,238
"O' Hanuman!"

554
05:44:29,340 --> 05:44:33,572
"O' Hanuman, where is that
amazing strength?"

555
05:44:33,678 --> 05:44:37,842
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

556
05:44:37,948 --> 05:44:42,510
"Try to remember your childhood,
O son of God of winds!"

557
05:44:50,895 --> 05:44:55,628
"When a new enemy challenged you. "

558
05:44:55,733 --> 05:44:59,726
"Rahu!"

559
05:44:59,837 --> 05:45:04,240
"When a new enemy challenged you. "

560
05:45:04,342 --> 05:45:08,676
"He boasted and tried
to intimidate you. "

561
05:45:08,779 --> 05:45:12,806
"Rahu!"

562
05:45:12,917 --> 05:45:17,149
"You gave him also a kick. "

563
05:45:17,254 --> 05:45:21,350
"You defeated the sinner
very easily. "

564
05:45:21,459 --> 05:45:27,625
"When Rahu was defeated,
Indra also came. "

565
05:45:27,832 --> 05:45:32,496
"In anger, he struck at you with
his Vajra. "

566
05:45:36,540 --> 05:45:40,772
"Then in the end, all the
disputes were resolved. "

567
05:45:40,878 --> 05:45:43,108
"The disputes were resolved. "

568
05:45:43,214 --> 05:45:47,275
"Then all the Gods made your
body as strong as Vajra. "

569
05:45:47,385 --> 05:45:51,617
"Today is the testing time. "

570
05:45:51,722 --> 05:45:55,783
"O' son of Kesari, today is
the testing time for you. "

571
05:45:55,893 --> 05:46:00,455
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

572
05:46:00,564 --> 05:46:04,660
"Try to remember your childhood,
O' son of God of winds!"

573
05:46:04,769 --> 05:46:08,796
"You are very strong; you cannot
be intimidated by any one. "

574
05:46:08,906 --> 05:46:11,374
"You cannot be intimidated
by any one. "

575
05:46:11,475 --> 05:46:15,411
"There is no task that
you cannot accomplish. "

576
05:46:15,513 --> 05:46:17,811
"That you cannot accomplish. "

577
05:46:17,915 --> 05:46:22,147
"Get up and take a leap!"

578
05:46:22,253 --> 05:46:24,278
"Bajrangbali!"

579
05:46:24,388 --> 05:46:26,413
"Bajrangbali!"

580
05:46:26,524 --> 05:46:30,824
"Challenge the sky!"

581
05:46:30,928 --> 05:46:32,828
"Bajrangbali!"

582
05:46:32,930 --> 05:46:35,160
"Bajrangbali!"

583
05:46:35,266 --> 05:46:39,259
"Assume that formidable form!"

584
05:46:39,370 --> 05:46:41,429
"Bajrangbali!"

585
05:46:41,539 --> 05:46:43,507
"Bajrangbali!"

586
05:46:43,607 --> 05:46:47,771
"Bring us out of the predicament. "

587
05:46:47,878 --> 05:46:49,778
"Bajrangbali!"

588
05:46:49,880 --> 05:46:51,438
"Bajrangbali!"

589
05:46:51,549 --> 05:46:53,517
"Get up, O' Bajrangbali!"

590
05:46:53,617 --> 05:46:55,517
"Hail Bajrangbali!"

591
05:46:55,619 --> 05:46:57,450
"Get up, O' Bajrangbali!"

592
05:46:57,555 --> 05:46:59,386
"Hail Bajrangbali!"

593
05:46:59,490 --> 05:47:01,253
"Get up, O' Bajrangbali!"

594
05:47:01,358 --> 05:47:04,521
"Hail Bajrangbali!"

595
05:47:29,520 --> 05:47:31,511
My meal has arrived!

596
05:47:32,256 --> 05:47:33,382
A substantial meal!

597
05:47:33,491 --> 05:47:34,515
Stop!

598
05:47:36,694 --> 05:47:39,288
Hanuman has vowed to accomplish
Ram's task.

599
05:47:39,763 --> 05:47:41,594
Eat me when I am return.

600
05:47:41,699 --> 05:47:43,496
I will swallow you!

601
05:47:43,767 --> 05:47:45,735
Lord Brahma has granted me a boon.

602
05:47:45,836 --> 05:47:49,101
Whoever passes this way,
becomes meal for Surasa...

603
05:47:49,206 --> 05:47:51,470
...the mother of serpents.

604
05:47:51,675 --> 05:47:53,370
Enter my mouth!

605
05:47:56,647 --> 05:48:02,279
How will my huge body
enter your small mouth?

606
05:48:13,330 --> 05:48:16,424
Mother, I entered and
exited your mouth!

607
05:48:16,734 --> 05:48:18,634
Brahma's boon remained intact.

608
05:48:18,736 --> 05:48:20,363
Hail Lord Ram!

609
05:48:22,239 --> 05:48:23,570
You are very clever!

610
05:48:24,308 --> 05:48:26,742
Go and accomplish Ram's task.

611
05:48:32,716 --> 05:48:33,808
Hail Lord Ram!

612
05:48:42,459 --> 05:48:45,485
O' brave ape, you have
defeated Lankini!

613
05:48:45,596 --> 05:48:48,759
I realise that Ravan's end is near.

614
05:48:49,133 --> 05:48:50,191
Hail Lord Ram!

615
05:48:53,537 --> 05:48:56,563
"Hail Raghunandan! Hail Sita-Ram!"

616
05:48:56,674 --> 05:48:59,609
"Janakivallabh Sita-Ram!"

617
05:48:59,810 --> 05:49:02,779
"Sita-Ram! Hail Sita-Ram!"

618
05:49:02,880 --> 05:49:05,440
"O' my mind, chant Sita-Ram!"

619
05:49:05,549 --> 05:49:06,573
Ram's name!

620
05:49:06,684 --> 05:49:09,209
"Hail Raghunandan! Hail Sita-Ram!"

621
05:49:09,320 --> 05:49:12,346
"Janakivallabh Sita-Ram!"

622
05:49:12,456 --> 05:49:15,448
"Sita-Ram! Hail Sita-Ram!"

623
05:49:15,559 --> 05:49:18,619
"O' my mind, chant Sita-Ram!"

624
05:49:18,729 --> 05:49:21,562
"Hail Raghunandan! Hail Sita-Ram!"

625
05:49:21,832 --> 05:49:23,857
Hail Lord Ram!
- Hail Lord Ram!

626
05:49:25,836 --> 05:49:28,202
I am younger brother of Ravan,
the king of Lanka.

627
05:49:28,472 --> 05:49:29,496
Vibhishan.

628
05:49:29,907 --> 05:49:32,137
O' great ape, please
introduce yourself...

629
05:49:32,242 --> 05:49:34,574
...and state the purpose
of your visit.

630
05:49:35,512 --> 05:49:37,537
I am Hanuman, the son
of God of winds.

631
05:49:38,449 --> 05:49:41,077
On Lord Lord Ram's command,
I have come here...

632
05:49:41,185 --> 05:49:43,312
...to search for mother Sita.

633
05:49:43,721 --> 05:49:48,090
Wow! You are very lucky
that all the time...

634
05:49:48,192 --> 05:49:53,095
...you get the opportunity
of serving Lord Ram...

635
05:49:53,197 --> 05:49:58,100
...of viewing him, of listening
to his voice...

636
05:49:58,202 --> 05:50:03,640
...and of being near him!

637
05:50:05,709 --> 05:50:12,137
You are fully devoted to Ram with
your body, mind and deeds!

638
05:50:18,422 --> 05:50:20,322
Hail Hanuman, devotee of Ram!

639
05:50:20,424 --> 05:50:21,448
Hail Lord Ram!

640
05:50:22,192 --> 05:50:26,322
Brother Vibhishan, I am impatient
to see mother Sita.

641
05:50:26,430 --> 05:50:27,454
Where is she?

642
05:50:27,831 --> 05:50:29,128
She is in the Ashok Grove...

643
05:50:29,233 --> 05:50:31,724
...situated near the palace
next to this one.

644
05:50:31,835 --> 05:50:33,530
Hail Lord Ram!

645
05:50:34,471 --> 05:50:35,836
Hail Sita-Ram!

646
05:50:44,314 --> 05:50:45,406
Sita!

647
05:50:58,228 --> 05:51:00,253
O' beautiful Sita!

648
05:51:01,365 --> 05:51:05,096
The king of Lanka has come
to offer all the luxuries...

649
05:51:05,202 --> 05:51:08,501
...and wealth of Lanka in exchange
for your consent.

650
05:51:09,206 --> 05:51:10,639
It is superior to heaven.

651
05:51:11,208 --> 05:51:13,267
For a virtuous woman it
is worse than hell!

652
05:51:13,644 --> 05:51:16,408
You can ascend the throne!

653
05:51:17,214 --> 05:51:19,341
For Sita, it is equal
to funeral pyre!

654
05:51:19,616 --> 05:51:23,552
Stubborn Sita, I am
the king of Lanka!

655
05:51:24,221 --> 05:51:27,384
I can make you my wife by
force if I so desire!

656
05:51:28,559 --> 05:51:31,119
I have seen your prowess at the
time of competition for marriage...

657
05:51:31,228 --> 05:51:34,129
...when the mighty Ravan
had to bend double...

658
05:51:34,231 --> 05:51:36,199
...while trying to pick up the bow!

659
05:51:36,300 --> 05:51:38,791
You were like a straw
before my Lord Ram!

660
05:51:38,902 --> 05:51:40,392
You are insulting me!

661
05:51:41,205 --> 05:51:43,196
I am the king of Lanka!

662
05:51:43,307 --> 05:51:45,207
I will cut you into pieces!

663
05:51:45,476 --> 05:51:48,536
Each and every drop of Sita's
blood will chant Ram's name!

664
05:51:48,645 --> 05:51:50,613
My sword will silence you!

665
05:51:50,714 --> 05:51:52,614
My lord! Please stop!

666
05:51:55,786 --> 05:52:00,723
If you want to raise your weapon,
then kill Mandodari first!

667
05:52:04,361 --> 05:52:08,695
Sita, today you survived thanks
to queen Mandodari!

668
05:52:09,867 --> 05:52:12,165
But I will not let you live...

669
05:52:12,269 --> 05:52:18,367
...if you don't accept me as your
husband within one month!

670
05:52:18,742 --> 05:52:20,607
I am the king of Lanka!

671
05:52:28,252 --> 05:52:32,518
Ram! Where is my Ram!

672
05:52:33,390 --> 05:52:34,789
Why is he inactive till now?

673
05:52:35,826 --> 05:52:40,456
Is Ram, who protects everyone,
angry with Sita?

674
05:52:41,165 --> 05:52:42,632
He does not listen to my pleas!

675
05:52:43,901 --> 05:52:46,461
O' Ram! O' Raghav!

676
05:53:04,588 --> 05:53:08,649
Ram! The ring of my beloved!

677
05:53:09,526 --> 05:53:10,857
My Lord's ring!

678
05:53:24,441 --> 05:53:25,465
How did it come here?

679
05:53:26,877 --> 05:53:27,901
Who brought it?

680
05:53:33,483 --> 05:53:34,507
Who are you?

681
05:53:36,286 --> 05:53:38,186
Hanuman, a devotee of
merciful Lord Ram...

682
05:53:38,288 --> 05:53:39,619
...and the son of God of winds.

683
05:53:40,490 --> 05:53:43,425
Lord has sent me to
search for you only.

684
05:53:44,261 --> 05:53:45,819
As a proof, he gave me this ring.

685
05:53:50,567 --> 05:53:54,196
Are Lord Ram and brother-in-law
Lakshman all right?

686
05:53:54,905 --> 05:53:58,136
Mother, everything
else is all right...

687
05:53:58,242 --> 05:54:02,144
...but I am unable to describe
the Lord's condition...

688
05:54:02,246 --> 05:54:04,237
...due to separation from you.

689
05:54:05,649 --> 05:54:07,480
He has become silent.

690
05:54:08,352 --> 05:54:10,252
He has lost his desire to speak!

691
05:54:10,854 --> 05:54:13,755
Hanuman, my eyes yearn
to look at Raghav!

692
05:54:13,857 --> 05:54:15,552
Hanuman, my mind is
getting impatient!

693
05:54:16,660 --> 05:54:19,652
Each moment seems like an era!

694
05:54:20,764 --> 05:54:23,892
I keep chanting Ram's name!

695
05:54:26,870 --> 05:54:32,172
On seeing your plight amongst
these wicked people...

696
05:54:32,276 --> 05:54:38,840
...I feel like going to evil
Ravan and killing him!

697
05:54:39,583 --> 05:54:42,746
I feel like immersing the
entire Lanka into the sea!

698
05:54:43,487 --> 05:54:46,820
And I feel like taking
you to my Lord.

699
05:54:47,557 --> 05:54:50,117
But how will you be able to avoid
the terrible demon army...

700
05:54:50,227 --> 05:54:52,161
...and take me away single-handedly?

701
05:54:52,329 --> 05:54:55,856
Just the way I came to you
by fooling the demons!

702
05:54:56,633 --> 05:54:59,602
Mother, do not consider Ram's
devotee to be an ordinary person!

703
05:55:00,203 --> 05:55:01,431
Hail Lord Ram!

704
05:55:04,775 --> 05:55:06,299
Goddess, do you believe me now?

705
05:55:07,344 --> 05:55:10,677
If you ask, I'll carry you to the
Lord along with the piece of land!

706
05:55:12,582 --> 05:55:15,142
But the Lord has ordered
me to locate you...

707
05:55:15,252 --> 05:55:18,688
...and not to fetch you.

708
05:55:20,190 --> 05:55:23,523
Raghavendra is ideal of conduct.

709
05:55:24,261 --> 05:55:28,163
His honour lies in killing
by his hands...

710
05:55:28,265 --> 05:55:32,463
...my abductor, the evil Ravan!

711
05:55:33,203 --> 05:55:34,261
Mother, have patience.

712
05:55:37,507 --> 05:55:39,304
The Lord will certainly
come to fetch you.

713
05:55:40,210 --> 05:55:41,370
Hail Lord Ram!

714
05:55:43,814 --> 05:55:49,377
But mother, how will I convince
the Lord that I have met you?

715
05:55:54,391 --> 05:55:57,121
Here, show this hair pin
to him and tell him...

716
05:55:57,227 --> 05:56:00,128
...that if he does not
come within one month...

717
05:56:00,230 --> 05:56:02,198
...he will not find me alive!

718
05:56:03,300 --> 05:56:06,326
Touch brother Lakshman's feet on
my behalf and seek forgiveness.

719
05:56:06,837 --> 05:56:09,135
Tell him that the mistake Sita
committed at Panchvati...

720
05:56:09,239 --> 05:56:11,139
...by crossing the line
drawn by Lakshman...

721
05:56:11,241 --> 05:56:13,573
...has brought this consequence.

722
05:56:13,844 --> 05:56:14,868
Mother!

723
05:56:15,412 --> 05:56:17,141
You have given me a
new lease of life...

724
05:56:17,247 --> 05:56:19,340
...by giving me news of the Lord.

725
05:56:19,850 --> 05:56:22,216
Hanuman, may you live forever!

726
05:56:22,652 --> 05:56:23,676
Mother!

727
05:56:23,887 --> 05:56:27,880
Hanuman, you have faced so many
hardships in travelling so far!

728
05:56:28,925 --> 05:56:30,153
Mother, one does not
feel the hardships...

729
05:56:30,260 --> 05:56:32,319
...when one is intent on serving.

730
05:56:33,296 --> 05:56:36,197
Still, I can't even
offer you any food!

731
05:56:36,299 --> 05:56:38,233
Mother, do not worry about my food.

732
05:56:39,202 --> 05:56:43,366
Can I go hungry after entering
such a fruit-laden grove?

733
05:56:43,473 --> 05:56:45,304
Just give me permission.

734
05:56:45,642 --> 05:56:47,269
Go, O' son of God of winds.

735
05:56:47,377 --> 05:56:48,401
Hail Lord Ram!

736
05:57:03,894 --> 05:57:05,486
Hey! Monkey! Monkey!

737
05:57:05,595 --> 05:57:06,755
Monkey! Go away!

738
05:57:54,678 --> 05:57:58,637
Offender monkey! Akshaykumar
will kill you!

739
05:58:02,352 --> 05:58:03,376
You talk too much!

740
05:58:20,370 --> 05:58:21,394
Pick up the sword!

741
05:58:23,240 --> 05:58:24,867
Pick it up! Pick it up!

742
05:58:30,714 --> 05:58:31,738
Pick it up!

743
05:59:12,522 --> 05:59:14,217
Akshaykumar was killed?

744
05:59:14,457 --> 05:59:15,788
My son was killed?

745
05:59:15,892 --> 05:59:17,519
I am the king of Lanka!

746
05:59:18,595 --> 05:59:22,554
I will kill the ape,
who killed my son!

747
05:59:22,832 --> 05:59:25,858
Father, a brother will avenge
a brother's murder!

748
05:59:26,503 --> 05:59:29,438
Meghnad will send that
ape to his death!

749
05:59:29,539 --> 05:59:32,531
Catch him alive and bring
him to the royal court!

750
05:59:32,842 --> 05:59:33,866
Ok, father.

751
05:59:47,791 --> 05:59:50,555
My brother's murderer monkey!

752
05:59:52,229 --> 05:59:53,821
I will punish you!

753
05:59:54,364 --> 05:59:56,628
Introduce yourself,
O' boasting gentleman!

754
05:59:57,534 --> 06:00:01,095
You arrogant one! I am the
one who has defeated...

755
06:00:01,204 --> 06:00:04,105
...the guardian deities, I
have defeated the Gods...

756
06:00:04,207 --> 06:00:06,767
...I am Indrajeet!

757
06:00:07,210 --> 06:00:08,837
I too am Ram's devotee.

758
06:00:09,212 --> 06:00:12,181
I do not consider words;
I appreciate valour!

759
06:00:12,482 --> 06:00:14,416
Then face my valour!

760
06:01:30,260 --> 06:01:32,228
You cannot escape from Brahmastra

761
06:01:33,229 --> 06:01:35,322
I will have to preserve
Lord Brahma's prestige!

762
06:01:41,771 --> 06:01:45,571
Soldiers! Take this monkey
to the royal court!

763
06:01:48,411 --> 06:01:50,311
I will go to the royal
court on my own.

764
06:01:53,483 --> 06:01:54,950
Monkey! Monkey!

765
06:01:56,119 --> 06:01:58,747
Hail Lord Ram!

766
06:02:00,824 --> 06:02:05,454
Hail the king of Lanka, the
conqueror of the world! - Hail!

767
06:02:06,396 --> 06:02:08,591
This is the monkey who has
destroyed the grove.

768
06:02:08,865 --> 06:02:11,060
He is the killer of
brother Akshaykumar.

769
06:02:13,136 --> 06:02:17,038
Arrogant monkey! I am
the king of Lanka!

770
06:02:17,774 --> 06:02:20,504
I have ascended the throne
after conquering the world!

771
06:02:21,411 --> 06:02:23,606
The constellations obey my orders!

772
06:02:24,614 --> 06:02:26,741
The Gods tremble on
hearing my name!

773
06:02:27,350 --> 06:02:29,614
Aren't you scared for your life?

774
06:02:30,019 --> 06:02:33,648
Only a lustful person or
a thief would have fear.

775
06:02:34,090 --> 06:02:38,754
The one who treads the righteous
path never fears anyone!

776
06:02:39,763 --> 06:02:43,722
Stupid monkey, I am
the king of Lanka!

777
06:02:44,601 --> 06:02:47,661
Who are you to boast in front of me?

778
06:02:48,371 --> 06:02:52,398
How did you cross 100 miles
of sea to enter Lanka?

779
06:02:52,542 --> 06:02:54,942
I flew across the sea.

780
06:02:55,445 --> 06:02:58,437
My name is Hanuman, the
son of the God of winds.

781
06:02:58,615 --> 06:03:02,415
I am the messenger of Lord Ram,
the ideal of conduct.

782
06:03:02,585 --> 06:03:06,351
He has incarnated to protect
righteousness...

783
06:03:06,456 --> 06:03:08,890
...and to destroy sinners.

784
06:03:09,125 --> 06:03:13,619
Stupid, there is only one
incarnation in the world.

785
06:03:14,130 --> 06:03:15,927
Ravan, the king of Lanka.

786
06:03:17,400 --> 06:03:19,766
There is only one scholar on
righteousness or unrighteousness.

787
06:03:20,069 --> 06:03:21,866
Ravan, the king of Lanka.

788
06:03:22,572 --> 06:03:24,938
There is only one, who controls
life and death!

789
06:03:25,341 --> 06:03:26,638
Ravan, the king of Lanka.

790
06:03:27,343 --> 06:03:29,368
Ram is an ordinary man!

791
06:03:30,346 --> 06:03:34,305
O' arrogant, you consider
the almighty Lord Ram...

792
06:03:34,417 --> 06:03:36,647
...as an ordinary man!

793
06:03:36,986 --> 06:03:40,683
Just get a taste of
his ordinary devotee!

794
06:03:40,824 --> 06:03:43,019
Hail Lord Ram!

795
06:03:55,472 --> 06:03:56,962
Hail Lord Ram!

796
06:03:59,876 --> 06:04:01,571
Look, O' king of Lanka!

797
06:04:02,111 --> 06:04:04,739
The one who sits on the
throne is not great!

798
06:04:05,048 --> 06:04:08,347
Merciful Lord Lord Ram is great...

799
06:04:08,451 --> 06:04:11,648
...whose wife you have abducted
like a lowly thief!

800
06:04:11,788 --> 06:04:13,779
No!

801
06:04:14,858 --> 06:04:16,450
I have taken revenge!

802
06:04:17,494 --> 06:04:18,893
I am the king of Lanka!

803
06:04:19,963 --> 06:04:22,864
The forest-dwellers did not cut
off sister Shurpanakha's nose!

804
06:04:23,066 --> 06:04:24,863
They have cut off the nose
of the king of Lanka!

805
06:04:25,401 --> 06:04:29,303
If the king of Lanka were so
concerned about his prestige...

806
06:04:29,405 --> 06:04:32,306
...he would not have allowed
his grown up sister...

807
06:04:32,408 --> 06:04:35,707
...to wander in forests
to satisfy her lust!

808
06:04:35,912 --> 06:04:37,470
You would have kept
her under control!

809
06:04:37,647 --> 06:04:39,444
Hanuman!

810
06:04:40,450 --> 06:04:43,385
Do not malign the king
of Lanka's family!

811
06:04:43,753 --> 06:04:46,916
Do not invite your ruin,
O' king of Lanka!

812
06:04:47,624 --> 06:04:49,319
Return Goddess
Sita with due respect...

813
06:04:49,425 --> 06:04:53,691
...and seek Lord
Ram's forgiveness.

814
06:04:54,097 --> 06:04:56,497
You will improve your life in this
world as well as in heaven!

815
06:04:56,699 --> 06:04:58,929
Stop talking nonsense!

816
06:04:59,669 --> 06:05:01,000
Prime minister!

817
06:05:01,804 --> 06:05:05,501
Kill this arrogant messenger of Ram!

818
06:05:05,608 --> 06:05:07,769
Hail Lord Ram!

819
06:05:08,545 --> 06:05:10,570
I have a request to
the king of Lanka.

820
06:05:11,447 --> 06:05:15,474
It is a violation of the code
of ethics to kill a messenger.

821
06:05:15,585 --> 06:05:18,850
It can put a blemish on the
fame of the king of Lanka.

822
06:05:19,923 --> 06:05:21,686
Vibhishan, you are right.

823
06:05:22,692 --> 06:05:24,387
I am the king of Lanka.

824
06:05:25,495 --> 06:05:27,793
Monkeys love their tails.

825
06:05:28,598 --> 06:05:31,590
Set fire to his tail
and release him!

826
06:05:32,335 --> 06:05:33,427
As you command!

827
06:05:33,536 --> 06:05:36,369
Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

828
06:05:36,873 --> 06:05:37,897
Hail Lord Ram!

829
06:05:39,943 --> 06:05:41,376
Hail Lord Ram!

830
06:05:58,561 --> 06:06:02,793
Do tie the knot very tightly;
don't keep it loose!

831
06:06:11,908 --> 06:06:13,603
Tie it! I am holding it!

832
06:06:15,878 --> 06:06:16,902
Tie it!

833
06:06:18,781 --> 06:06:20,043
Tie it quickly!

834
06:06:21,451 --> 06:06:22,475
Tie it quickly!

835
06:07:19,442 --> 06:07:20,704
Lord, do you see this?

836
06:07:22,845 --> 06:07:25,678
The property of the king
of Lanka is burning!

837
06:07:26,749 --> 06:07:28,740
That too by the hands of a monkey.

838
06:07:28,918 --> 06:07:33,355
Queen, I am the king of Lanka!

839
06:07:33,823 --> 06:07:36,553
I can establish millions
of such Lanka!

840
06:07:38,061 --> 06:07:41,827
My lord, you are forgetting that
this is not just the property.

841
06:07:43,066 --> 06:07:45,296
The fame of the king
of Lanka is burning...

842
06:07:45,401 --> 06:07:47,801
...which was impregnable!

843
06:07:47,904 --> 06:07:49,394
Mandodari!

844
06:07:49,806 --> 06:07:51,364
I am the king of Lanka!

845
06:08:09,092 --> 06:08:10,457
Sita!

846
06:08:16,833 --> 06:08:19,324
Brother Hanuman, you have
given a new life to Ram...

847
06:08:19,435 --> 06:08:21,494
...by bringing news about Sita.

848
06:08:21,904 --> 06:08:24,998
O' Lord, I could do it with
your blessings only.

849
06:08:27,009 --> 06:08:28,636
Oh, what is this, Bajrangbali?

850
06:08:29,312 --> 06:08:32,281
Goddess Sita has sought forgiveness
for the offence...

851
06:08:32,381 --> 06:08:33,939
...by touching your feet.

852
06:08:34,550 --> 06:08:35,710
Sister-in-law's offence!

853
06:08:36,486 --> 06:08:37,510
What offence?

854
06:08:37,754 --> 06:08:40,279
She said that this is the
consequence of the mistake...

855
06:08:40,389 --> 06:08:44,291
...that Sita committed by crossing
the line drawn by Lakshman...

856
06:08:44,393 --> 06:08:45,690
...at Panchvati.

857
06:08:46,395 --> 06:08:47,726
What else did Sita say?

858
06:08:48,531 --> 06:08:52,297
If the Lord does not go
to her within one month...

859
06:08:52,401 --> 06:08:54,995
...you will not find her alive.

860
06:08:56,773 --> 06:08:59,003
Brother, what are you thinking?
- What?

861
06:08:59,742 --> 06:09:01,972
Give orders for attacking Lanka!

862
06:09:04,814 --> 06:09:07,647
Hail Lord Ram!
- Hail Lord Ram!

863
06:09:14,524 --> 06:09:18,392
How will our army cross
100 miles wide ocean?

864
06:09:19,762 --> 06:09:23,357
One arrow from Lakshman is
enough to dry up the ocean!

865
06:09:23,466 --> 06:09:25,263
No, Lakshman! It is not
right to destroy...

866
06:09:25,368 --> 06:09:28,599
...the nature of the ocean
for our selfish purpose.

867
06:09:28,704 --> 06:09:32,367
Raghuveer, the nature can be
preserved if we can build a bridge.

868
06:09:32,975 --> 06:09:34,442
Give orders to Null and Neel.

869
06:09:34,544 --> 06:09:36,637
They are expert in
this kind of work.

870
06:09:37,380 --> 06:09:40,474
Lord, it will take 6 months to
build a bridge 100 miles long!

871
06:09:40,583 --> 06:09:43,450
But Goddess Sita has given
time of only one month!

872
06:09:44,554 --> 06:09:45,578
What will happen now?

873
06:09:45,888 --> 06:09:49,756
If the stones can float, then the
bridge can be built very fast.

874
06:09:51,394 --> 06:09:52,793
Can stones float?!

875
06:10:00,870 --> 06:10:02,531
It has never happened,
nor will it happen!

876
06:10:02,738 --> 06:10:06,469
O' son of Anjani, you are superior
in strength and intelligence.

877
06:10:06,609 --> 06:10:07,701
Think of a solution.

878
06:10:08,678 --> 06:10:12,512
The key to success is
faith and hard work.

879
06:10:13,349 --> 06:10:14,373
Lord!

880
06:10:14,851 --> 06:10:17,718
Now we are going to enter the land
of Ravan, devotee of Lord Shiva.

881
06:10:18,087 --> 06:10:23,753
Before that, we should seek
blessings of Lord Shiva.

882
06:10:33,636 --> 06:10:36,935
Om Namah Shivay!

883
06:10:43,613 --> 06:10:48,550
Lord of Gods Mahadev!
- Hail!

884
06:10:51,454 --> 06:10:54,946
O' Lord of the world!
O' Lord of Ram!

885
06:10:55,491 --> 06:10:56,617
Give your blessings.

886
06:11:00,096 --> 06:11:01,358
O' Raghunandan, may you
always be victorious...

887
06:11:01,464 --> 06:11:04,365
...in your endeavours to eradicate
atrocities from the world...

888
06:11:04,467 --> 06:11:06,367
...in protecting the
virtue of women...

889
06:11:06,469 --> 06:11:08,903
...and in protecting righteousness!

890
06:11:09,005 --> 06:11:11,371
By establishing my idol,
you have done a deed...

891
06:11:11,474 --> 06:11:13,499
...for the welfare of the world.

892
06:11:14,477 --> 06:11:18,538
This place will be
known as Rameshwar.

893
06:11:19,148 --> 06:11:21,378
Whoever venerates Rameshwar...

894
06:11:21,484 --> 06:11:23,782
...will have his wishes fulfilled.

895
06:11:26,022 --> 06:11:30,391
Lord Bholenath, mother Sita has
given only one month's time.

896
06:11:30,960 --> 06:11:32,655
How will we be able to build
a bridge so quickly?

897
06:11:32,862 --> 06:11:34,557
How will the army reach Lanka?

898
06:11:34,764 --> 06:11:35,958
How can the stones float?

899
06:11:36,432 --> 06:11:40,334
Bajrangbali, why do you forget
that the name of Ram...

900
06:11:40,436 --> 06:11:42,768
...is the saviour of everyone?

901
06:11:43,105 --> 06:11:44,800
Life is a struggle.

902
06:11:45,441 --> 06:11:47,773
Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!

903
06:11:49,512 --> 06:11:50,979
Hail Bholenath!

904
06:12:09,665 --> 06:12:15,001
"O' my mind!"

905
06:12:15,104 --> 06:12:20,440
"O' my mind! Life is a struggle. "

906
06:12:20,543 --> 06:12:27,779
"O' my mind! O my mind,
life is a struggle. "

907
06:12:27,883 --> 06:12:30,750
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

908
06:12:30,853 --> 06:12:33,413
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

909
06:12:33,522 --> 06:12:35,990
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

910
06:12:36,092 --> 06:12:38,526
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

911
06:12:38,627 --> 06:12:46,796
"O' my mind! O my mind,
life is a struggle. "

912
06:12:58,381 --> 06:13:08,848
"Whoever chants the name of the
Lord in the ocean of existence. "

913
06:13:08,958 --> 06:13:13,588
"Whoever chants the
name of the Lord. "

914
06:13:13,996 --> 06:13:19,366
"Just as the stones are
floating on water...

915
06:13:19,468 --> 06:13:24,371
...he too will float
in the same manner. "

916
06:13:24,507 --> 06:13:29,001
"He too will float in
the same manner. "

917
06:13:29,745 --> 06:13:34,910
"My friend, surrender to Ram. "

918
06:13:35,017 --> 06:13:38,976
"My friend, surrender to Ram. "

919
06:13:39,088 --> 06:13:41,784
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

920
06:13:41,891 --> 06:13:44,416
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

921
06:13:44,527 --> 06:13:46,995
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

922
06:13:47,096 --> 06:13:49,656
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

923
06:13:49,765 --> 06:13:57,763
"O' my mind! O my mind,
life is a struggle. "

924
06:14:09,452 --> 06:14:19,760
"Brother, hold on to your faith;
Lanka is not very far. "

925
06:14:19,995 --> 06:14:24,557
"Lanka is not very far. "

926
06:14:24,967 --> 06:14:35,366
"Lord will be victorious over
there; have no doubt about it. "

927
06:14:35,511 --> 06:14:39,971
"Have no doubt about it. "

928
06:14:40,549 --> 06:14:45,748
"See the fruits of devotion. "

929
06:14:45,855 --> 06:14:49,882
"See the fruits of devotion. "

930
06:14:49,992 --> 06:14:52,620
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

931
06:14:52,728 --> 06:14:55,390
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

932
06:14:55,498 --> 06:14:57,864
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

933
06:14:57,967 --> 06:15:00,435
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

934
06:15:00,536 --> 06:15:08,500
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

935
06:15:08,644 --> 06:15:15,914
"O' my mind! O' my mind,
life is a struggle. "

936
06:15:16,485 --> 06:15:18,851
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

937
06:15:18,954 --> 06:15:21,582
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

938
06:15:21,690 --> 06:15:23,954
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

939
06:15:24,059 --> 06:15:26,687
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

940
06:15:26,795 --> 06:15:29,286
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

941
06:15:29,398 --> 06:15:31,764
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

942
06:15:31,867 --> 06:15:34,301
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

943
06:15:34,403 --> 06:15:36,667
"Chant, Ram, Ram, Ram!"

944
06:15:37,540 --> 06:15:38,564
Hail!

945
06:15:38,841 --> 06:15:42,368
Hail Ravan, the king of demons!

946
06:15:42,478 --> 06:15:43,604
Hail!

947
06:15:43,712 --> 06:15:46,306
Sire, the one who had
set fire to Lanka...

948
06:15:46,415 --> 06:15:48,440
...has arrived at the
border of Lanka!

949
06:15:48,551 --> 06:15:50,314
Sire, along with a huge
army of monkeys...

950
06:15:50,419 --> 06:15:52,751
...Ram and Lakshman are also there!

951
06:15:53,088 --> 06:15:55,318
Brother, fighting with Ram and...

952
06:15:55,424 --> 06:15:57,915
...Lakshman is like
inviting destruction!

953
06:15:58,427 --> 06:15:59,758
Destruction!

954
06:16:05,834 --> 06:16:08,064
Destruction of Ravan,
the king of Lanka!

955
06:16:09,104 --> 06:16:11,572
Of Ravan, the son of Pulatsya?

956
06:16:12,374 --> 06:16:14,399
Of Ravan, the one with ten heads?

957
06:16:15,044 --> 06:16:17,478
Of Ravan, who conquered
the nine planets?

958
06:16:17,880 --> 06:16:20,508
Of Ravan, the king of demons?

959
06:16:20,649 --> 06:16:24,483
Of the mighty Ravan, who
had held up Kailash?

960
06:16:24,787 --> 06:16:28,848
Of the all-powerful Ravan, who
had conquered the heaven?

961
06:16:29,391 --> 06:16:33,452
Of the invincible Ravan, who had
intimidated the three worlds?

962
06:16:33,963 --> 06:16:36,295
Destruction of Ravan, the
invincible, immortal...

963
06:16:36,398 --> 06:16:38,423
...and ardent devotee of Shiva?

964
06:16:42,805 --> 06:16:46,297
Very soon, I will crush
Ram and Lakshman...

965
06:16:46,408 --> 06:16:48,876
...along with the army of monkeys!

966
06:16:49,044 --> 06:16:50,909
I am the king of Lanka!

967
06:16:51,046 --> 06:16:53,412
Destruction obeys my orders!

968
06:16:53,616 --> 06:16:57,313
Brother, each and every living
being of the creation...

969
06:16:57,419 --> 06:16:59,444
...is controlled by Lord Ram.

970
06:17:00,422 --> 06:17:01,946
All of us are puppets.

971
06:17:02,524 --> 06:17:05,391
Lord Ramchandra is the puppeteer.

972
06:17:05,561 --> 06:17:06,892
Vibhishan!

973
06:17:08,731 --> 06:17:14,636
You belong to my side but
you praise the enemy!

974
06:17:15,504 --> 06:17:19,702
Brother, Lord Ram is
not anybody's enemy!

975
06:17:20,075 --> 06:17:21,838
He is everybody's friend!

976
06:17:22,544 --> 06:17:26,275
Return Janaki and save Lanka
also from destruction...

977
06:17:26,382 --> 06:17:29,010
...along with yourself!

978
06:17:29,518 --> 06:17:32,510
Traitor, get out of my sight!

979
06:17:32,755 --> 06:17:36,418
Go and take shelter with
the one you are praising!

980
06:17:39,762 --> 06:17:43,823
You do not think straight
when your end is near.

981
06:17:46,669 --> 06:17:49,297
You have given me a chance to
seek shelter with Lord Ram...

982
06:17:49,405 --> 06:17:51,669
...by kicking me.

983
06:17:52,341 --> 06:17:53,467
You have done me a great favour!

984
06:17:54,009 --> 06:17:55,533
Hail Sita-Ram!

985
06:17:56,078 --> 06:17:57,705
Hail Sita-Ram!

986
06:17:57,813 --> 06:17:58,837
Hail Sita-Ram!

987
06:17:58,947 --> 06:18:02,439
Hail, the king of Lanka, the
conqueror of the nine planets!

988
06:18:02,618 --> 06:18:05,644
Meghnad will shed the
blood of the enemies!

989
06:18:05,754 --> 06:18:09,315
Kumbhakarna, the brother
of the king of Lanka...

990
06:18:09,425 --> 06:18:13,384
...will destroy Ram's army
with his illusion!

991
06:18:13,495 --> 06:18:16,328
Meghnad, go with brother
Kumbhakarna...

992
06:18:16,432 --> 06:18:21,426
...and destroy those wicked enemies!

993
06:18:21,804 --> 06:18:23,328
You are Indrajeet.

994
06:18:23,672 --> 06:18:26,334
I entrust the strategy
of this war to you.

995
06:18:26,442 --> 06:18:28,433
Hail the king of Lanka!

996
06:18:30,746 --> 06:18:33,738
Hail the king of Lanka!

997
06:18:43,392 --> 06:18:47,692
Kaalnemi,

998
06:18:48,564 --> 06:18:50,828
Only a thorn can remove a thorn!

999
06:18:51,700 --> 06:18:56,603
Sita's dream will be shattered
on seeing Ram's head!

1000
06:18:57,406 --> 06:19:00,967
Sita will have to become
Lanka's chief queen!

1001
06:19:01,477 --> 06:19:04,412
I am the king of Lanka! Come!

1002
06:19:08,417 --> 06:19:09,441
Sita!

1003
06:19:10,352 --> 06:19:12,616
My word is destiny!

1004
06:19:13,355 --> 06:19:14,947
My wish turns into fate!

1005
06:19:15,624 --> 06:19:20,857
I am the king of Lanka! I send
my enemies to their death!

1006
06:19:23,632 --> 06:19:25,759
Ram! Dead?!

1007
06:19:26,301 --> 06:19:30,260
O' beautiful Sita, now it will
be beneficial to you...

1008
06:19:30,372 --> 06:19:36,333
...to become Ravan's chief queen
and live a luxurious life.

1009
06:19:36,845 --> 06:19:40,713
Forget the false affection
for the late Ram.

1010
06:19:40,916 --> 06:19:43,942
Late Ram! False affection!

1011
06:19:44,453 --> 06:19:47,547
Ram's severed head is solid proof!

1012
06:19:48,323 --> 06:19:49,881
Remove the cover and
see for yourself!

1013
06:19:50,626 --> 06:19:51,786
Dispel your misconception!

1014
06:19:51,960 --> 06:19:53,291
It is not Sita, but Ravan,
the king of Lanka...

1015
06:19:53,395 --> 06:19:55,454
...who has misconception!

1016
06:19:55,664 --> 06:19:57,291
How would a lustful man
like you know about...

1017
06:19:57,399 --> 06:19:59,299
...the true love between
a husband and wife...

1018
06:19:59,401 --> 06:20:02,495
...when despite being married,
he desires someone else's wife?

1019
06:20:02,738 --> 06:20:05,298
Arrogant Ravan, if any
harm had come to Ram...

1020
06:20:05,407 --> 06:20:09,400
...Sita would have
died at the same time!

1021
06:20:09,745 --> 06:20:14,375
No weapon or missile has the
power to even touch Ram!

1022
06:20:14,483 --> 06:20:16,474
Sita has unwavering confidence
about that!

1023
06:20:16,618 --> 06:20:18,518
I am the king of Lanka!

1024
06:20:19,354 --> 06:20:23,381
I will shatter your confidence
immediately!

1025
06:20:24,426 --> 06:20:25,484
My head?!

1026
06:20:25,994 --> 06:20:27,552
Is the misconception of the
king of Lanka dispelled?

1027
06:20:28,430 --> 06:20:29,658
Deceitful woman!

1028
06:20:30,065 --> 06:20:31,327
You dare to perform
illusionary miracle...

1029
06:20:31,433 --> 06:20:33,697
...before the conqueror
of the nine planets?

1030
06:20:33,802 --> 06:20:36,498
O' king of Lanka, this
is a miracle of truth!

1031
06:20:36,672 --> 06:20:39,334
Your end is near and certain
in the tussle...

1032
06:20:39,441 --> 06:20:42,740
...between sin and righteousness!

1033
06:20:43,479 --> 06:20:44,503
Huh!

1034
06:20:46,448 --> 06:20:50,680
Nectar is stored in my navel.

1035
06:20:51,453 --> 06:20:54,945
I am the king of Lanka!
I am immortal!

1036
06:20:55,791 --> 06:20:58,351
My son Indrajeet will
also become immortal...

1037
06:20:58,460 --> 06:21:01,793
...after finishing the
Vaishvanar fire sacrifice!

1038
06:21:03,899 --> 06:21:11,635
Meghnad, today Lakshman's
arrows want to taste your blood!

1039
06:21:12,074 --> 06:21:16,568
Lakshman! Uncle Vibhishan!

1040
06:21:17,479 --> 06:21:20,880
So a traitor within has fetched
the enemy into the house!

1041
06:21:21,149 --> 06:21:25,313
Meghnad, if there is threat,
from a person to a family...

1042
06:21:25,420 --> 06:21:30,323
...from a family to the society and
from the society to the country...

1043
06:21:30,425 --> 06:21:32,393
...then it is right to destroy them!

1044
06:21:38,433 --> 06:21:42,460
Both of you be seated; let me
finish the fire sacrifice.

1045
06:21:42,671 --> 06:21:44,332
A deceitful person does
not have the right...

1046
06:21:44,439 --> 06:21:47,067
...to complete fire veneration!

1047
06:21:47,543 --> 06:21:49,534
Meghnad is deceitful!

1048
06:21:49,645 --> 06:21:52,443
The entire family is deceitful!

1049
06:21:52,981 --> 06:21:55,347
Your uncle Maarich
deceived Lord Ram...

1050
06:21:55,450 --> 06:21:57,611
...by assuming the form of a deer!

1051
06:21:57,753 --> 06:22:00,347
Your father deceived mother
Sita at Panchvati...

1052
06:22:00,455 --> 06:22:02,582
...by assuming the
form of an ascetic!

1053
06:22:02,858 --> 06:22:04,348
On the battlefield,
the son deceived...

1054
06:22:04,459 --> 06:22:07,087
...by killing an illusory Sita!

1055
06:22:07,596 --> 06:22:12,863
Meghnad, deceivers cannot win all
the time against good people!

1056
06:22:13,535 --> 06:22:15,867
My hands are getting impatient!

1057
06:22:16,138 --> 06:22:18,629
Come; let me pat you on the back!

1058
06:22:18,740 --> 06:22:20,537
O' monkey!

1059
06:23:14,529 --> 06:23:15,553
An arm!

1060
06:23:18,400 --> 06:23:19,492
My husband's arm!

1061
06:23:21,737 --> 06:23:25,298
Sire, Meghnad's arm fell into
Sulochana's courtyard!

1062
06:23:25,407 --> 06:23:26,465
Meghnad's arm?!

1063
06:23:26,575 --> 06:23:28,941
In daughter-in-law's courtyard?

1064
06:23:29,911 --> 06:23:35,315
O' arm, if I am a virtuous
woman in mind and body...

1065
06:23:35,417 --> 06:23:39,319
...then tell me in writing
who has separated you...

1066
06:23:39,421 --> 06:23:41,651
...from my husband's body!

1067
06:23:52,701 --> 06:23:55,397
That lowly Lakshman!

1068
06:23:56,538 --> 06:23:59,530
The head...

1069
06:24:14,656 --> 06:24:16,749
My lord!
- My son!

1070
06:24:16,858 --> 06:24:17,882
Indrajeet!

1071
06:24:19,494 --> 06:24:26,423
My lord! I cannot bear
separation from you!

1072
06:24:28,403 --> 06:24:30,928
Today you have departed
from the world!

1073
06:24:32,074 --> 06:24:34,406
I am the king of Lanka!

1074
06:24:35,077 --> 06:24:38,808
I will kill Lakshman right away!

1075
06:24:39,414 --> 06:24:40,472
What's the gain?

1076
06:24:40,582 --> 06:24:47,579
My beloved, my dear
husband has departed!

1077
06:24:48,490 --> 06:24:50,617
What is the use of my life?

1078
06:24:52,360 --> 06:24:54,385
Father, give me permission to leave!

1079
06:24:54,529 --> 06:24:58,056
There shouldn't be a long gap
between my husband and my departure!

1080
06:24:58,934 --> 06:25:01,402
Get me my husband's head!

1081
06:25:01,503 --> 06:25:04,529
Daughter-in-law, I will
pile up a heap of heads!

1082
06:25:05,107 --> 06:25:10,409
I will destroy Ram's entire clan
to avenge for one's death!

1083
06:25:10,645 --> 06:25:12,636
Father, I do not want destruction...

1084
06:25:12,781 --> 06:25:14,976
...I want my husband's head.

1085
06:25:15,450 --> 06:25:19,784
I am the king of Lanka! The
ruler of the three worlds!

1086
06:25:20,122 --> 06:25:23,421
I cannot beg before Ram!

1087
06:25:23,525 --> 06:25:25,356
I cannot make a request!

1088
06:25:26,561 --> 06:25:29,394
Then give me permission!
- No!

1089
06:25:29,765 --> 06:25:34,532
Will my daughter-in-law
go to enemy Ram's camp?

1090
06:25:34,636 --> 06:25:35,728
Never!

1091
06:25:36,338 --> 06:25:37,805
I am the king of Lanka!

1092
06:25:38,774 --> 06:25:44,679
Daughter-in-law! My son is dead!

1093
06:25:45,814 --> 06:25:51,582
If you also leave me alone,
what will this mother do?

1094
06:25:51,853 --> 06:25:56,313
Mother, you can understand
a woman's feelings...

1095
06:25:56,424 --> 06:26:00,485
...her sorrow and about her welfare.

1096
06:26:00,896 --> 06:26:05,060
Would you want me to forget the
companionship of many lifetimes?

1097
06:26:05,433 --> 06:26:06,923
Should I abandon my
duties as a wife?

1098
06:26:07,035 --> 06:26:08,627
Never, daughter-in-law!

1099
06:26:09,437 --> 06:26:12,531
Go! Fulfill your duty
as a virtuous wife.

1100
06:26:17,612 --> 06:26:21,013
My dear, you have given up your
life while fulfilling your duty.

1101
06:26:21,116 --> 06:26:27,783
Please, look at this unfortunate
woman... at least once!

1102
06:26:31,526 --> 06:26:36,293
My lord, had my father Sheshnag
been with you...

1103
06:26:36,398 --> 06:26:41,597
...he would certainly
have protected you.

1104
06:26:48,476 --> 06:26:54,415
Silly! Whom would you blame when
the protector turns the assailant?

1105
06:26:54,616 --> 06:27:00,316
After death I came to know that
Lakshman, who killed me...

1106
06:27:00,422 --> 06:27:02,720
...is the incarnation of Sheshnag.

1107
06:27:07,629 --> 06:27:08,687
Salutations.

1108
06:27:10,799 --> 06:27:12,960
Cruel destiny!

1109
06:27:17,772 --> 06:27:22,505
Father is the killer of
his daughter's husband!

1110
06:27:26,047 --> 06:27:30,279
The one, who gave away
daughter in marriage...

1111
06:27:30,385 --> 06:27:33,354
...has killed her husband!

1112
06:27:35,390 --> 06:27:40,293
The father who gave blessings
for my husband's long life...

1113
06:27:40,395 --> 06:27:42,693
...has killed him!

1114
06:27:42,864 --> 06:27:43,888
O' daughter of Sheshnag!

1115
06:27:47,535 --> 06:27:51,027
Destiny controls people and
makes them forget everything.

1116
06:27:52,340 --> 06:27:56,299
O' pious lady, instead of shedding
tears of sorrow...

1117
06:27:56,411 --> 06:27:58,777
...pay tribute to your husband.

1118
06:28:00,615 --> 06:28:02,515
As you wish, O' Raghuveer!

1119
06:28:07,489 --> 06:28:08,615
My lord!

1120
06:28:12,093 --> 06:28:13,390
My lord!

1121
06:28:13,662 --> 06:28:16,722
Virtuous Sulochana!
- Hail!

1122
06:28:19,868 --> 06:28:24,805
Where is that offender
who has killed Meghnad?

1123
06:28:25,040 --> 06:28:26,905
Unrighteous and coward Lakshman!

1124
06:28:29,511 --> 06:28:30,603
Lakshman!

1125
06:29:33,742 --> 06:29:36,870
Lakshman, I am the king of Lanka!

1126
06:29:37,712 --> 06:29:40,704
The unfailing weapon will
not spare your life!

1127
06:29:42,684 --> 06:29:43,810
Unfailing weapon!

1128
06:29:50,058 --> 06:29:52,424
Killer of the son of
the king of Lanka!

1129
06:29:59,734 --> 06:30:03,295
Hanuman, you are the only
one in the three worlds...

1130
06:30:03,405 --> 06:30:06,374
...who can push back
the king of Lanka!

1131
06:30:08,009 --> 06:30:09,033
Wow!

1132
06:30:09,611 --> 06:30:11,636
Lakshman! Lakshman!

1133
06:30:18,753 --> 06:30:20,618
Lakshman! Lakshman!

1134
06:30:21,456 --> 06:30:22,480
Lakshman!

1135
06:30:25,026 --> 06:30:26,050
Lakshman!

1136
06:30:28,496 --> 06:30:29,520
Lakshman!

1137
06:30:29,631 --> 06:30:30,655
Lakshman!

1138
06:30:30,899 --> 06:30:31,923
Brother Lakshman!

1139
06:30:32,434 --> 06:30:34,527
Hanuman, what has happened
to Lakshman?

1140
06:30:34,636 --> 06:30:35,660
Unfailing weapon.

1141
06:30:35,870 --> 06:30:36,894
Unfailing weapon?

1142
06:30:37,806 --> 06:30:40,536
Lakshman! Brother Lakshman!

1143
06:30:42,043 --> 06:30:44,511
Speak! Speak!

1144
06:30:45,113 --> 06:30:46,546
Open your eyes!

1145
06:30:48,817 --> 06:30:51,411
You used to console me when
I used to become impatient!

1146
06:30:52,987 --> 06:30:55,649
Today you don't even speak
when I am wailing!

1147
06:30:56,791 --> 06:30:59,589
Lakshman, how will I go back
to Ayodhya without you?

1148
06:30:59,727 --> 06:31:00,751
How will I go?

1149
06:31:05,533 --> 06:31:11,369
Brother Lakshman, what will
I say to mothers Kaushalya...

1150
06:31:11,473 --> 06:31:12,497
...Kaikeyi and Sumitra?

1151
06:31:12,607 --> 06:31:14,575
What will I tell them?

1152
06:31:17,745 --> 06:31:23,581
Lord! Lakshman is only unconscious.

1153
06:31:25,820 --> 06:31:27,913
Physician Sushen is in Lanka.

1154
06:31:31,726 --> 06:31:33,353
Where am I? Where am I?

1155
06:31:33,495 --> 06:31:34,792
O' my God!

1156
06:31:34,896 --> 06:31:36,329
O' God!

1157
06:31:36,598 --> 06:31:39,499
O' God!

1158
06:31:41,436 --> 06:31:42,460
Physician Sushen.

1159
06:31:54,682 --> 06:31:56,673
Lakshman can be brought
back to life...

1160
06:31:57,385 --> 06:31:58,909
...if we can get Sanjeevani herb.

1161
06:31:59,621 --> 06:32:00,645
Sanjeevani?

1162
06:32:01,389 --> 06:32:02,822
Yes, Sanjeevani.

1163
06:32:03,391 --> 06:32:04,756
It grows on Mount Dronachal.

1164
06:32:05,093 --> 06:32:07,357
It must be brought here
before sunrise.

1165
06:32:07,829 --> 06:32:13,825
Kaalnemi! Lakshman's death will
be a tribute to Indrajeet.

1166
06:32:14,736 --> 06:32:16,033
Immediately go to Dronachal.

1167
06:32:16,638 --> 06:32:20,369
But remember that I will kill
you if someone takes away...

1168
06:32:20,475 --> 06:32:22,375
...the Sanjeevani herb!

1169
06:32:22,644 --> 06:32:25,306
I am the king of Lanka!

1170
06:32:25,947 --> 06:32:28,882
Who will fetch Sanjeevani
herb before the night ends?

1171
06:32:31,686 --> 06:32:37,318
Brother Lakshman, how will
Ram protect your life...

1172
06:32:37,425 --> 06:32:39,620
...if we can't get Sanjeevani herb?

1173
06:32:41,362 --> 06:32:42,852
How will he be able
to live without you?

1174
06:32:44,766 --> 06:32:47,326
Sorrow is the greatest hindrance.

1175
06:32:47,902 --> 06:32:49,927
Enthusiasm is the greatest achiever!

1176
06:32:50,838 --> 06:32:51,862
I will go.

1177
06:32:52,373 --> 06:32:53,738
Hail Lord Ram!

1178
06:33:00,381 --> 06:33:01,405
Stop!

1179
06:33:02,750 --> 06:33:04,377
You cannot go further!

1180
06:33:05,386 --> 06:33:07,616
I have come to get Sanjeevani
to save a life.

1181
06:33:07,722 --> 06:33:10,555
Nobody can take away even
a straw while I am there!

1182
06:33:10,992 --> 06:33:14,587
Someone who creates hurdle in
saving a life cannot be a sage!

1183
06:35:01,536 --> 06:35:02,594
This is the Sanjeevani herb!

1184
06:35:26,694 --> 06:35:27,718
Lakshman!

1185
06:35:27,995 --> 06:35:29,019
Brother!

1186
06:35:30,531 --> 06:35:31,759
Where is the wicked Ravan?

1187
06:35:42,343 --> 06:35:43,833
Your body is like Vajra

1188
06:35:44,479 --> 06:35:45,537
Hail Bajrang!

1189
06:35:45,980 --> 06:35:48,778
Today I will make the
earth devoid of Ram!

1190
06:35:49,417 --> 06:35:50,577
I am the king of Lanka!

1191
06:36:54,882 --> 06:36:56,941
Nectar is stored in Ravan's navel.

1192
06:37:01,922 --> 06:37:03,014
Lakshman!
- Yes?

1193
06:37:03,791 --> 06:37:05,725
Seek final preaching from
the erudite scholar.

1194
06:37:06,127 --> 06:37:07,151
As you command, Lord!

1195
06:37:10,664 --> 06:37:12,564
Salutations to eminent scholar.

1196
06:37:13,601 --> 06:37:15,228
Any final preaching?

1197
06:37:17,605 --> 06:37:22,702
Lakshman! Pity is
generated by anger.

1198
06:37:24,545 --> 06:37:27,514
Anger is generated by arrogance.

1199
06:37:29,283 --> 06:37:33,515
And the final stage of
arrogance is death.

1200
06:37:35,256 --> 06:37:42,526
Therefore, a man must always keep
in mind the reality of death...

1201
06:37:42,630 --> 06:37:46,532
...while going on with life...

1202
06:37:47,902 --> 06:37:51,861
...so that death does not
become painful for him.

1203
06:37:52,740 --> 06:37:54,708
O' ideal of conduct!

1204
06:37:55,976 --> 06:38:01,608
It is the greatness of a victor
to show mercy to the enemy.

1205
06:38:03,150 --> 06:38:06,119
And forgiveness is
the code of ethics.

1206
06:38:08,856 --> 06:38:15,625
Please forgive me... before
I breathe my last breath!

1207
06:38:22,303 --> 06:38:26,103
Lord Ram, the conqueror
of Lanka! - Hail!

1208
06:38:26,207 --> 06:38:27,231
Vaidehi!

1209
06:38:28,676 --> 06:38:29,700
Sita, stop there!

1210
06:38:30,744 --> 06:38:32,143
Raghuveer!
- Brother!

1211
06:38:32,613 --> 06:38:33,637
Lord!

1212
06:38:34,215 --> 06:38:38,515
Lord! On the day of victory, why
this harsh treatment to mother...

1213
06:38:38,619 --> 06:38:40,587
...at the time of reunion?

1214
06:38:41,155 --> 06:38:42,520
Did you make us search for mother...

1215
06:38:42,623 --> 06:38:46,525
...made me cross the sea and
fought a battle in Lanka...

1216
06:38:46,627 --> 06:38:48,857
...to treat her like this?

1217
06:38:49,263 --> 06:38:50,958
Tell me! Tell me, Lord!

1218
06:38:52,032 --> 06:38:54,523
There was a question of the
prestige of the Raghu clan...

1219
06:38:54,635 --> 06:38:55,727
...at the time of the
battle in Lanka.

1220
06:38:56,203 --> 06:38:57,795
Brother, what question
has come up now?

1221
06:38:58,906 --> 06:39:03,536
How will the society look at
Sita after she has lived...

1222
06:39:03,644 --> 06:39:06,010
...for one year as Ravan's prisoner?

1223
06:39:06,747 --> 06:39:07,805
A doubt on mother's character?

1224
06:39:08,182 --> 06:39:12,619
Lord, should one ask gold
whether it is really gold?

1225
06:39:13,320 --> 06:39:16,289
Should one ask Ganga
whether she is pure?

1226
06:39:17,157 --> 06:39:20,888
Ram knows that Sita
is pure and virtuous.

1227
06:39:21,762 --> 06:39:24,629
But Hanuman, everyone is not Ram!

1228
06:39:25,266 --> 06:39:26,494
Everyone is not Ram!

1229
06:39:28,202 --> 06:39:31,603
We will have to find a
way to satisfy them.

1230
06:39:32,973 --> 06:39:33,997
There is only one way.

1231
06:39:34,942 --> 06:39:35,966
A test by fire.

1232
06:39:36,076 --> 06:39:37,100
A test by fire?

1233
06:39:37,611 --> 06:39:38,635
Yes.

1234
06:39:38,913 --> 06:39:40,505
The Sita, daughter-in-law
of the Raghu dynasty...

1235
06:39:40,614 --> 06:39:42,047
...will not let the prestige
of the dynasty be blemished...

1236
06:39:42,149 --> 06:39:43,207
...while she is alive.

1237
06:39:44,251 --> 06:39:47,015
Brother Lakshman, prepare a pyre.

1238
06:40:05,706 --> 06:40:08,140
O' Ramchandra of Raghu dynasty!

1239
06:40:09,043 --> 06:40:12,604
I, the Lord of Fire,
am witness to piety.

1240
06:40:13,180 --> 06:40:18,550
I say without doubt and confidently
that Sita is without blemish.

1241
06:40:18,919 --> 06:40:19,943
She is absolutely pure.

1242
06:40:20,254 --> 06:40:21,585
Accept her with open heart.

1243
06:40:22,289 --> 06:40:25,087
I accept the verdict
of the Lord of Fire.

1244
06:40:27,294 --> 06:40:30,661
Pious Sita!
- Hail!

1245
06:40:31,131 --> 06:40:35,568
The king of Ayodhya, the gem
of the Raghu dynasty...

1246
06:40:35,669 --> 06:40:38,695
...king Lord Ramchandra!
- Hail!

1247
06:40:40,307 --> 06:40:43,572
Lord, you have given precious
gifts to everyone...

1248
06:40:43,877 --> 06:40:45,845
...but Bajrangbali got nothing!

1249
06:40:46,614 --> 06:40:48,206
Give him a post of high rank.

1250
06:40:48,616 --> 06:40:49,708
No, mother; no.

1251
06:40:50,718 --> 06:40:52,583
Someone who has vowed to serve...

1252
06:40:52,686 --> 06:40:53,710
...does not covet any post.

1253
06:40:54,254 --> 06:40:55,983
I only wish to serve the Lord.

1254
06:41:02,296 --> 06:41:03,320
Give it to him, O' queen.

1255
06:41:06,367 --> 06:41:08,631
Hanuman!
- Mother!

1256
06:41:36,797 --> 06:41:40,597
Sage Valmiki, what is
Bajrangbali doing?

1257
06:41:41,602 --> 06:41:45,163
King Shakun, go and ask Bajrangbali!

1258
06:41:46,073 --> 06:41:50,100
Bajrangbali, why are you breaking
this string of pearls?

1259
06:41:50,210 --> 06:41:52,576
After all Bajrangbali
is a monkey, isn't he?

1260
06:41:53,347 --> 06:41:55,872
A monkey wears a string of
Rudraksh!

1261
06:41:58,285 --> 06:42:02,722
Bajrangbali, this is an insult
to the queen of Ayodhya!

1262
06:42:03,624 --> 06:42:04,648
No, brother, no!

1263
06:42:05,259 --> 06:42:09,059
How can Hanuman insult mother Sita?

1264
06:42:09,797 --> 06:42:13,927
I am checking if Sita and
Ram are there in any pearl!

1265
06:42:14,802 --> 06:42:17,896
Bajrangbali, today you are looking
for Sita and Ram in pearls!

1266
06:42:18,639 --> 06:42:20,231
Have you ever looked into your body?

1267
06:42:20,708 --> 06:42:22,699
Are Sita and Ram in your body?

1268
06:42:22,810 --> 06:42:23,777
Are they?

1269
06:42:24,111 --> 06:42:25,135
They must be there!

1270
06:42:25,846 --> 06:42:27,541
If Sita and Ram do not
dwell in my body...

1271
06:42:27,648 --> 06:42:29,138
...then it is of no use to me!

1272
06:42:30,818 --> 06:42:32,615
Do not give speech! Give us proof!

1273
06:42:32,786 --> 06:42:34,083
We will believe if we see!

1274
06:42:34,855 --> 06:42:36,015
Are you challenging my devotion?

1275
06:42:37,658 --> 06:42:39,922
Hail Lord Ram!

1276
06:43:00,914 --> 06:43:02,643
Hanuman!
- Lord!

1277
06:43:23,704 --> 06:43:28,573
"O' Maruti!"

1278
06:43:29,076 --> 06:43:35,015
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

1279
06:43:35,115 --> 06:43:40,678
"The devotion of the entire world... "

1280
06:43:40,854 --> 06:43:46,690
"The devotion of the entire world
is contained in your eyes. "

1281
06:43:46,794 --> 06:43:49,592
"O' Maruti!"

1282
06:43:49,763 --> 06:43:55,668
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

1283
06:43:55,803 --> 06:43:58,169
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1284
06:43:58,272 --> 06:44:01,901
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1285
06:44:19,626 --> 06:44:22,322
"You are full of devotion. "

1286
06:44:22,429 --> 06:44:25,227
"You are very powerful. "

1287
06:44:25,332 --> 06:44:31,100
"Where Ram's name is chanted... "

1288
06:44:31,271 --> 06:44:34,172
"Where Ram's name is chanted...

1289
06:44:34,274 --> 06:44:37,072
...you always dwell in that place. "

1290
06:44:37,177 --> 06:44:42,843
"The lord's gaze is on you. "

1291
06:44:43,050 --> 06:44:45,951
"The lord's gaze is on you. "

1292
06:44:46,053 --> 06:44:48,886
"Your gaze is on the Lord. "

1293
06:44:48,989 --> 06:44:51,981
"O' Maruti!"

1294
06:44:52,092 --> 06:44:57,826
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

1295
06:44:57,931 --> 06:45:00,195
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1296
06:45:00,601 --> 06:45:03,968
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1297
06:45:18,986 --> 06:45:24,185
"There has never been
another one like you!"

1298
06:45:24,791 --> 06:45:30,161
"Your devotion to the
Lord is incomparable. "

1299
06:45:30,697 --> 06:45:36,567
"Listen, O' glorious Hanuman!

1300
06:45:36,670 --> 06:45:39,662
"Listen, O' glorious Hanuman...

1301
06:45:39,773 --> 06:45:42,571
...the earth feels blessed
because of you. "

1302
06:45:42,676 --> 06:45:48,205
"The love for mother Sita... "

1303
06:45:48,582 --> 06:45:54,282
"The love for mother Sita
is there in your eyes. "

1304
06:45:54,388 --> 06:45:57,221
"O' Maruti!"

1305
06:45:57,324 --> 06:46:03,229
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

1306
06:46:03,330 --> 06:46:05,730
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1307
06:46:05,966 --> 06:46:09,663
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1308
06:46:27,087 --> 06:46:30,056
"You are the life of the devotion
of all the devotees. "

1309
06:46:30,157 --> 06:46:32,990
"You are the glory of the prowess
of every brave man. "

1310
06:46:33,093 --> 06:46:38,929
"O' Hanuman, you are
one in a million!"

1311
06:46:39,032 --> 06:46:41,967
"O' Hanuman, you are
one in a million...

1312
06:46:42,069 --> 06:46:44,867
...you are a boon to the earth. "

1313
06:46:44,972 --> 06:46:50,672
"Day and night, there is... "

1314
06:46:50,911 --> 06:46:56,781
"Day and night, the Lord's
image is in your eyes. "

1315
06:46:56,883 --> 06:46:59,750
"O' Maruti!"

1316
06:46:59,853 --> 06:47:05,655
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

1317
06:47:05,826 --> 06:47:08,090
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1318
06:47:08,328 --> 06:47:11,161
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1319
06:47:11,264 --> 06:47:14,165
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1320
06:47:14,267 --> 06:47:17,031
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1321
06:47:17,204 --> 06:47:20,105
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1322
06:47:20,207 --> 06:47:24,234
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

1323
06:47:28,015 --> 06:47:30,609
Mother, arrangements for the
Lord's bath have been made.

1324
06:47:30,884 --> 06:47:32,511
Get his clothes and ornaments ready.

1325
06:47:32,986 --> 06:47:34,010
I will do it.

1326
06:47:37,657 --> 06:47:40,524
Mother, why are you
applying vermilion?

1327
06:47:42,929 --> 06:47:44,260
It is the symbol of the Lord.

1328
06:47:44,731 --> 06:47:47,666
The Lord is pleased even
more if I apply it.

1329
06:47:48,035 --> 06:47:50,970
The Lord is pleased even more
if you apply vermilion!

1330
06:47:51,238 --> 06:47:52,262
Ok, ok.

1331
06:47:54,908 --> 06:47:57,900
The Lord is pleased even more
if you apply vermilion!

1332
06:47:58,311 --> 06:48:00,711
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1333
06:48:00,881 --> 06:48:02,746
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1334
06:48:02,849 --> 06:48:04,544
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1335
06:48:05,285 --> 06:48:07,913
You have not written any duties
for Hanuman in this list!

1336
06:48:09,022 --> 06:48:10,216
How will Hanuman accept it?

1337
06:48:11,725 --> 06:48:13,659
You should entrust at
least one duty to him!

1338
06:48:14,594 --> 06:48:17,722
Or else... or else he will feel hurt.

1339
06:48:18,632 --> 06:48:20,031
Lord, Hanuman has served you a lot.

1340
06:48:21,168 --> 06:48:23,033
We should let him take rest now.

1341
06:48:24,538 --> 06:48:27,507
My brothers-in-law and
I too have some rights!

1342
06:48:28,275 --> 06:48:30,243
Place your seal on the list.

1343
06:48:30,710 --> 06:48:32,803
Yes, brother; sister-in-law
is right.

1344
06:48:35,015 --> 06:48:38,507
Ok; as the sister-in-law
and brothers-in-law wish!

1345
06:48:39,186 --> 06:48:42,815
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1346
06:48:42,923 --> 06:48:44,652
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1347
06:48:44,825 --> 06:48:46,690
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1348
06:48:46,793 --> 06:48:48,556
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!
- Hanuman, what's this?

1349
06:48:48,762 --> 06:48:50,059
Lord, feel pleased!

1350
06:48:50,163 --> 06:48:51,994
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1351
06:48:52,099 --> 06:48:53,828
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1352
06:48:53,934 --> 06:48:55,526
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!
- Bajrangbali, what's this?

1353
06:48:55,702 --> 06:48:57,260
Why have you assumed this guise?
- Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1354
06:48:57,737 --> 06:48:58,999
Lord, feel pleased!

1355
06:48:59,739 --> 06:49:01,263
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1356
06:49:01,374 --> 06:49:02,966
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1357
06:49:03,076 --> 06:49:04,907
What kind of charade is this?
- Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1358
06:49:05,011 --> 06:49:06,603
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!
- Tell me!

1359
06:49:06,880 --> 06:49:08,177
Lord, feel pleased!

1360
06:49:09,049 --> 06:49:10,744
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1361
06:49:10,851 --> 06:49:12,284
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1362
06:49:12,385 --> 06:49:14,046
What king of act is this?

1363
06:49:14,287 --> 06:49:17,017
Lord, I will tell you;
first feel pleased!

1364
06:49:17,124 --> 06:49:18,648
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram!

1365
06:49:18,758 --> 06:49:20,555
Lord Ram! Hail Ram! Hail Lord Ram...

1366
06:49:20,660 --> 06:49:22,560
- Janaki, what has
happened to Bajrangbali?

1367
06:49:24,131 --> 06:49:27,498
Mother, you only had said
that the Lord is pleased...

1368
06:49:27,601 --> 06:49:29,626
...if you apply even a little
bit of vermilion.

1369
06:49:29,936 --> 06:49:32,097
I have applied vermilion
on my entire body.

1370
06:49:33,073 --> 06:49:36,042
Still, the Lord is not pleased
even a little bit!

1371
06:49:40,113 --> 06:49:44,516
Hanuman, on seeing your eternal
love, Ram is not just pleased...

1372
06:49:44,618 --> 06:49:46,745
...he is forever indebted to you!

1373
06:49:47,287 --> 06:49:48,811
Lord, please do not embarrass me!

1374
06:49:49,556 --> 06:49:51,524
Let your devotee remain
a devotee only.

1375
06:49:51,625 --> 06:49:54,651
Wait, Bajrangbali! The tasks
have already been allotted.

1376
06:49:55,228 --> 06:49:56,252
Read this list.

1377
06:50:11,244 --> 06:50:14,543
Very good, mother! You
have misguided me!

1378
06:50:15,182 --> 06:50:17,173
You made me smear vermilion and
took away everything from me!

1379
06:50:17,684 --> 06:50:19,151
There are no duties for me!

1380
06:50:19,252 --> 06:50:21,652
You can take up some duty if there
remains any to be allotted!

1381
06:50:21,755 --> 06:50:23,154
Yes of course, you can take it up.

1382
06:50:23,723 --> 06:50:25,156
Only if there remains any duty.

1383
06:50:26,826 --> 06:50:27,850
If there remains any duty.

1384
06:50:29,896 --> 06:50:32,922
I can take up the remaining duty.

1385
06:50:36,102 --> 06:50:38,627
Ok, tell me can I take
up the remaining duty?

1386
06:50:38,738 --> 06:50:39,830
Yes, yes, you can.

1387
06:50:40,006 --> 06:50:41,667
Well?
- Yes, you can.

1388
06:50:41,775 --> 06:50:43,709
Well?
- Yes, yes, you can.

1389
06:50:44,077 --> 06:50:47,569
Mother, you also say, can
I do the remaining duty?

1390
06:50:47,847 --> 06:50:49,280
Yes, Hanuman, you can.

1391
06:50:49,649 --> 06:50:51,708
Lord, did you hear that?

1392
06:50:52,352 --> 06:50:54,286
All of them agree to it!

1393
06:50:55,222 --> 06:50:57,053
If all of them agree,
then I too agree to it.

1394
06:50:57,958 --> 06:50:59,721
Lord, do not say anything
to me later!

1395
06:51:00,026 --> 06:51:01,653
Where should I put the royal seal?

1396
06:51:02,829 --> 06:51:04,694
First tell us about your duty!

1397
06:51:05,632 --> 06:51:07,224
I have a very small duty!

1398
06:51:08,101 --> 06:51:12,094
I will snap my fingers whenever
the Lord yawns.

1399
06:51:14,040 --> 06:51:16,201
Brother, did you hear
about Hanuman's duty?

1400
06:51:16,376 --> 06:51:18,139
Hanuman will now snap his fingers!

1401
06:51:21,281 --> 06:51:25,581
Hanuman, go and fix the time of
meeting with Guru Vasishtha.

1402
06:51:26,253 --> 06:51:29,882
Forgive me, Lord; I do not
want to ignore my duty.

1403
06:51:30,590 --> 06:51:32,114
God knows when you might yawn...

1404
06:51:32,292 --> 06:51:33,691
...and I would be needed
to snap my fingers!

1405
06:51:34,127 --> 06:51:36,960
Now I cannot leave you
even for a moment!

1406
06:51:39,599 --> 06:51:40,623
Did you see?

1407
06:51:41,034 --> 06:51:44,561
Had I left, I would have
incurred the grave sin...

1408
06:51:44,671 --> 06:51:45,797
...of ignoring my duty!

1409
06:52:01,855 --> 06:52:03,322
Hanuman, now you can go.

1410
06:52:04,190 --> 06:52:05,714
Mother, where do I go?

1411
06:52:06,359 --> 06:52:09,624
I will have to be with
Lord Ram all the time!

1412
06:52:10,063 --> 06:52:13,089
I will have to keep awake even
while the Lord is sleeping!

1413
06:52:13,633 --> 06:52:15,601
He can yawn even in his sleep!

1414
06:52:16,202 --> 06:52:17,226
Oh!

1415
06:52:18,305 --> 06:52:20,705
Lord, please talk sense to him!

1416
06:52:20,940 --> 06:52:23,875
Lord, please do not take away
this small duty from me!

1417
06:52:24,878 --> 06:52:28,006
No, Hanuman; I cannot
take away your duty.

1418
06:52:29,049 --> 06:52:32,018
Hanuman, go out! This is my order!

1419
06:52:32,819 --> 06:52:36,755
Lord, how can I disobey
mother's order?

1420
06:52:42,595 --> 06:52:43,619
Hail Lord Ram!

1421
06:52:44,264 --> 06:52:45,288
Hail mother!

1422
06:53:04,984 --> 06:53:10,217
"My Lord knows... "

1423
06:53:10,757 --> 06:53:14,659
"My Lord knows about everything
in the world. "

1424
06:53:14,761 --> 06:53:20,597
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1425
06:53:22,235 --> 06:53:25,568
"O' Hanuman, go on snapping
your fingers!"

1426
06:53:25,672 --> 06:53:30,632
"On your head... "

1427
06:53:31,144 --> 06:53:35,012
"On your head, a sword is hanging. "

1428
06:53:35,115 --> 06:53:41,179
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1429
06:53:42,589 --> 06:53:46,218
"O' Hanuman, go on snapping
your fingers!"

1430
06:53:53,600 --> 06:53:55,158
Lord! Lord!

1431
06:53:55,735 --> 06:53:58,033
Lord! Lord!

1432
06:54:00,807 --> 06:54:06,575
"Who can win against the Lord?"

1433
06:54:06,679 --> 06:54:09,978
"Who can win? Who can win?"

1434
06:54:10,083 --> 06:54:15,817
"Who can outwit Lord Ram?"

1435
06:54:15,922 --> 06:54:19,289
"Who can outwit him?
Who can outwit him?"

1436
06:54:19,392 --> 06:54:24,659
"You do not know... "

1437
06:54:24,998 --> 06:54:28,934
"You do not know the divine
play of the Lord. "

1438
06:54:29,035 --> 06:54:34,996
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1439
06:54:36,743 --> 06:54:39,906
"Chant Ram's name! Stop worrying!"

1440
06:54:40,013 --> 06:54:43,642
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1441
06:54:43,750 --> 06:54:47,277
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1442
06:54:47,654 --> 06:54:49,554
Son! Ram!

1443
06:54:51,724 --> 06:54:52,952
Lord!
- What happened to my son?

1444
06:54:53,226 --> 06:54:54,284
What happened to my son?

1445
06:54:54,828 --> 06:54:56,659
Ram! Is anybody there?

1446
06:54:56,996 --> 06:54:58,793
Somebody, please come
here! Please help!

1447
06:54:59,199 --> 06:55:00,996
Ram, my son!

1448
06:55:02,068 --> 06:55:07,768
"We will deal with whatever
happens later. "

1449
06:55:07,874 --> 06:55:11,241
"We will deal with it.
We will deal with it. "

1450
06:55:11,344 --> 06:55:17,044
"O' devotee, who can
compete with you?"

1451
06:55:17,150 --> 06:55:20,779
"Who can compete with you?
Who can compete with you?"

1452
06:55:20,887 --> 06:55:25,984
"Do not worry. "

1453
06:55:26,559 --> 06:55:30,256
"Do not worry unnecessarily. "

1454
06:55:30,363 --> 06:55:36,598
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1455
06:55:38,171 --> 06:55:41,265
"Chant Ram's name! Stop worrying!"

1456
06:55:41,374 --> 06:55:45,003
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1457
06:55:45,111 --> 06:55:48,945
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1458
06:55:49,282 --> 06:55:50,647
Gurudev, please do some thing!

1459
06:55:50,750 --> 06:55:51,774
Please do something!

1460
06:55:53,786 --> 06:55:57,688
His pulse is normal. There is
no fever. Nothing is wrong.

1461
06:56:00,260 --> 06:56:01,284
Where is Hanuman?

1462
06:56:03,663 --> 06:56:09,260
"So what if mother threw
you out of the house?"

1463
06:56:09,369 --> 06:56:12,770
"So what if she threw you out?
So what if she threw you out?

1464
06:56:12,872 --> 06:56:18,674
"So what if you became
penniless for a while?

1465
06:56:18,845 --> 06:56:22,212
"So what if you are penniless?
So what if you are penniless?

1466
06:56:22,315 --> 06:56:27,582
"You also show them!"

1467
06:56:27,854 --> 06:56:31,722
"You also show them your
traits as a monkey!"

1468
06:56:31,824 --> 06:56:37,524
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1469
06:56:37,630 --> 06:56:40,963
"O' Hanuman, go on snapping
your fingers!"

1470
06:56:41,067 --> 06:56:44,628
"O' Hanuman, go on snapping
your fingers!"

1471
06:56:44,737 --> 06:56:49,572
"My Lord knows... "

1472
06:56:49,976 --> 06:56:53,844
"My Lord knows about everything
in the world. "

1473
06:56:53,947 --> 06:56:59,283
"Go on! O' Hanuman, go on
snapping your fingers!"

1474
06:56:59,586 --> 06:57:02,680
"Chant Ram's name! Stop worrying!"

1475
06:57:02,789 --> 06:57:06,247
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1476
06:57:06,359 --> 06:57:09,817
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1477
06:57:09,929 --> 06:57:13,558
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1478
06:57:13,666 --> 06:57:17,568
"Your troubles will be
destroyed immediately!"

1479
06:57:32,151 --> 06:57:35,211
Lord!
- Bajrangbali!

1480
06:57:37,824 --> 06:57:40,258
So this was the miracle of
Hanuman's finger-snapping!

1481
06:57:40,927 --> 06:57:41,951
It's true.

1482
06:57:42,128 --> 06:57:43,595
How will a master without
his servant...

1483
06:57:43,896 --> 06:57:45,727
...and the Lord without His
devotee feel at peace?

1484
06:57:46,566 --> 06:57:49,694
Yes, Hanuman, you win; we lose.

1485
06:57:50,937 --> 06:57:54,600
From today, Hanuman has the right
to serve Ram regarding everything.

1486
06:57:55,708 --> 06:57:56,902
He is an incomparable devotee.

1487
06:57:58,578 --> 06:58:01,547
Hanuman, your tale of devotion
will be there forever...

1488
06:58:01,648 --> 06:58:03,138
...as long as the creation lasts.

1489
06:58:03,783 --> 06:58:05,546
Whoever narrates or listens
to this tale...

1490
06:58:05,652 --> 06:58:07,813
...will earn merit equal
to serving the Lord.

1491
06:58:08,588 --> 06:58:09,612
Mother!

1492
06:58:13,593 --> 06:58:16,824
Hanuman, you have always
been serving us.

1493
06:58:17,263 --> 06:58:19,094
You have never given us
a chance to serve you.

1494
06:58:19,766 --> 06:58:21,791
Tomorrow you will have to
eat food cooked by me.

1495
06:58:22,268 --> 06:58:23,292
Will you eat it?

1496
06:58:23,770 --> 06:58:26,603
I will eat food cooked
by mother only.

1497
06:58:26,806 --> 06:58:28,103
Yes, yes, I will cook.

1498
06:58:28,775 --> 06:58:31,744
We 4 brothers will also eat
food cooked by you only.

1499
06:58:32,879 --> 06:58:35,871
All are invited, but only
after Hanuman has eaten.

1500
06:58:45,558 --> 06:58:48,527
Wow! Such delightful aroma!

1501
06:58:54,567 --> 06:58:55,898
Such sweet taste!

1502
06:59:03,276 --> 06:59:05,972
Wow! I feel like keeping on eating!

1503
06:59:15,855 --> 06:59:16,947
Mother, serve me more!

1504
06:59:35,041 --> 06:59:36,099
Mother, serve me more!

1505
06:59:50,156 --> 06:59:51,180
Mother, serve me more!

1506
06:59:56,829 --> 06:59:59,662
O' God! Is it Hanuman's stomach
or an endless pit!

1507
06:59:59,832 --> 07:00:03,131
If he keeps on eating like this,
everyone else will remain hungry!

1508
07:00:08,040 --> 07:00:09,098
Mother, serve me more!

1509
07:00:23,890 --> 07:00:25,016
Mother, serve me more!

1510
07:00:26,058 --> 07:00:27,184
Mother!

1511
07:00:27,860 --> 07:00:29,987
Mother, come here! Come here!

1512
07:00:33,933 --> 07:00:35,264
Look, everything got over!

1513
07:00:35,668 --> 07:00:36,692
What will happen now?

1514
07:00:38,137 --> 07:00:40,128
Brother, now I am feeling
very hungry!

1515
07:00:40,239 --> 07:00:42,571
I am feeling the hunger pangs!

1516
07:00:43,009 --> 07:00:45,807
Is Hanuman eating food
or passing time?

1517
07:00:50,983 --> 07:00:52,883
Mother, serve me more!

1518
07:00:53,286 --> 07:00:55,049
Take this! Take the vessel to him!

1519
07:00:57,957 --> 07:00:59,720
Mother, serve me more!

1520
07:01:00,293 --> 07:01:02,727
Yes! This is how food
should be served!

1521
07:01:02,962 --> 07:01:07,058
Do not serve in small plates!
Serve it in big vessels!

1522
07:01:09,869 --> 07:01:12,337
Mother's cooking is very delicious!

1523
07:01:13,105 --> 07:01:17,667
Now mother's hands are tired!

1524
07:01:23,282 --> 07:01:25,773
Mother, serve me more!

1525
07:01:26,219 --> 07:01:27,584
Mother Kaushalya is coming.

1526
07:01:29,155 --> 07:01:32,647
Daughter-in-law, you have
invited a fine devotee!

1527
07:01:32,992 --> 07:01:36,018
Before giving a promise, you should
have considered your condition!

1528
07:01:36,295 --> 07:01:37,819
Come on! Leave all this! Come!

1529
07:01:37,930 --> 07:01:38,954
He will call out!

1530
07:01:39,198 --> 07:01:40,790
Mother, serve me more!

1531
07:01:40,933 --> 07:01:41,991
What will I serve him?

1532
07:01:42,101 --> 07:01:46,094
Look; I have ordered sweets and
snacks from sweet-vendors.

1533
07:01:46,305 --> 07:01:48,705
Mother, serve me more!

1534
07:01:48,975 --> 07:01:50,806
Come on! Serve this! Go!

1535
07:01:51,043 --> 07:01:53,170
Mother, serve me more!

1536
07:01:53,312 --> 07:01:55,974
Mother, Hanuman will not
eat if he finds out!

1537
07:01:56,282 --> 07:01:57,874
How will Hanuman find out?

1538
07:01:58,251 --> 07:02:00,719
Nobody's name is printed
on the foodstuff!

1539
07:02:04,724 --> 07:02:06,988
This does not seem to
be made by mother.

1540
07:02:10,930 --> 07:02:12,693
Mother! If you are tired then
shall I wash my hands...

1541
07:02:12,798 --> 07:02:14,891
...and get up?

1542
07:02:15,801 --> 07:02:18,702
Today if anyone stays hungry
in Ayodhya's palace...

1543
07:02:18,804 --> 07:02:20,931
...then that will be Hanuman.

1544
07:02:21,407 --> 07:02:23,238
I will make the sweets;
I am making it.

1545
07:02:24,243 --> 07:02:26,404
Then I will sit here the whole day.

1546
07:02:26,846 --> 07:02:28,871
Mother, make it quickly.

1547
07:02:29,215 --> 07:02:31,809
There is some magic in your hands.

1548
07:02:31,918 --> 07:02:35,718
The more I eat the
more hungry I feel.

1549
07:02:42,194 --> 07:02:44,162
What happened? Sita, what happened?

1550
07:02:46,032 --> 07:02:47,863
Hanuman!
- Has Hanuman eaten his food?

1551
07:02:48,100 --> 07:02:50,034
Come on, now we too will go...
- No!

1552
07:02:50,136 --> 07:02:53,663
Wheat, wheat flour, rice, ghee,
milk, curds, sweets...

1553
07:02:53,773 --> 07:02:56,071
...everything is finished.

1554
07:02:56,175 --> 07:02:57,767
The whole godown is empty.

1555
07:02:57,877 --> 07:02:59,777
The entire godown is empty?
- Yes!

1556
07:02:59,879 --> 07:03:01,278
Hanuman finished everything?

1557
07:03:01,380 --> 07:03:04,349
On top of that... mother,
please serve me food.

1558
07:03:04,717 --> 07:03:05,877
Now what shall I serve him?

1559
07:03:06,218 --> 07:03:07,776
My Lord, everything is finished.

1560
07:03:07,987 --> 07:03:09,045
Please do something.

1561
07:03:10,289 --> 07:03:13,747
Brother, why are you quiet?
Please do something.

1562
07:03:13,859 --> 07:03:15,759
Otherwise the name of Raghukul
will be tarnished.

1563
07:03:27,006 --> 07:03:29,873
Take this; go and serve
him this basil leaf.

1564
07:03:39,085 --> 07:03:40,109
Take this.

1565
07:03:50,363 --> 07:03:51,387
I enjoyed it!

1566
07:03:51,797 --> 07:03:54,664
Mother, if you would have served
me basil leaf before...

1567
07:03:54,767 --> 07:03:57,258
...then you wouldn't have
had to be so helpless!

1568
07:03:57,703 --> 07:03:58,727
Is your hunger satisfied?

1569
07:03:58,838 --> 07:04:01,739
Mother, the Lord is satisfied
with the basil leaf.

1570
07:04:01,841 --> 07:04:03,832
And with the Lord's offering the
devotee is also satisfied.

1571
07:04:04,043 --> 07:04:05,340
Today my stomach is full.

1572
07:04:05,778 --> 07:04:07,177
Tomorrow too I will come at
this same time. - What?

1573
07:04:07,380 --> 07:04:10,679
No! No! No! - No? Is a small
leaf of basil too much...

1574
07:04:10,783 --> 07:04:14,344
...to be offered to Hanuman
in this Ayodhya's palace?

1575
07:04:14,453 --> 07:04:16,318
You... you just eat basil leaf.

1576
07:04:16,422 --> 07:04:17,787
Mother, just one leaf.

1577
07:04:18,190 --> 07:04:20,681
Just one leaf. Then Hanuman
you can come everyday.

1578
07:04:20,793 --> 07:04:21,817
Hail, hail Ram!

1579
07:04:26,932 --> 07:04:28,160
Daughter-in-law! Daughter-in-law!

1580
07:04:28,401 --> 07:04:30,198
Daughter-in-law! Daughter-in-law!

1581
07:04:31,737 --> 07:04:33,637
How many times I told you not
to over exert yourself...

1582
07:04:33,739 --> 07:04:36,264
...in this condition.

1583
07:04:37,243 --> 07:04:39,143
You must walk also carefully.

1584
07:04:40,346 --> 07:04:42,143
You must think of all
the good things.

1585
07:04:42,882 --> 07:04:44,679
And you must always stay happy.

1586
07:05:18,717 --> 07:05:19,741
"Hey you!"

1587
07:05:19,852 --> 07:05:20,876
"Hey you!"

1588
07:05:20,986 --> 07:05:22,749
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

1589
07:05:22,855 --> 07:05:23,879
"My name is... "

1590
07:05:23,989 --> 07:05:25,013
"My name is... "

1591
07:05:25,257 --> 07:05:27,817
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1592
07:05:30,262 --> 07:05:34,926
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1593
07:05:35,868 --> 07:05:38,701
"One King of Avadh... "

1594
07:05:40,906 --> 07:05:46,173
"One King of Avadh stole my heart. "

1595
07:05:46,278 --> 07:05:47,302
"Stole my heart. "

1596
07:05:47,413 --> 07:05:48,641
"My name is... "

1597
07:05:48,747 --> 07:05:49,805
"My name is... "

1598
07:05:49,915 --> 07:05:54,318
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1599
07:05:54,787 --> 07:05:59,724
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1600
07:06:20,045 --> 07:06:25,005
"Just see all of you are watching. "

1601
07:06:25,117 --> 07:06:29,747
"Just see all of you are watching. "

1602
07:06:30,022 --> 07:06:34,686
"I am so enchanting... enchanting!"

1603
07:06:37,062 --> 07:06:41,624
"Since the time the Lord
has looked at me...

1604
07:06:41,734 --> 07:06:46,762
...I have become enthralling...
enthralling!"

1605
07:06:49,175 --> 07:06:54,169
"Though externally I look playful... "

1606
07:06:54,280 --> 07:06:58,808
"Though externally I look playful. "

1607
07:06:58,918 --> 07:07:02,115
"But from within I
am not flamboyant. "

1608
07:07:02,221 --> 07:07:03,813
"I am not flamboyant. "

1609
07:07:03,956 --> 07:07:04,980
"My name is... "

1610
07:07:05,090 --> 07:07:06,114
"My name is... "

1611
07:07:06,225 --> 07:07:09,820
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1612
07:07:10,129 --> 07:07:14,964
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1613
07:07:35,254 --> 07:07:40,021
"My entire body is
filled with music. "

1614
07:07:40,125 --> 07:07:44,824
"My entire body is
filled with music. "

1615
07:07:44,930 --> 07:07:47,899
"The flute plays in my heart. "

1616
07:07:48,000 --> 07:07:49,831
"The flute. "

1617
07:07:52,137 --> 07:08:01,739
"All my life I will be devoted
to that person. "

1618
07:08:04,283 --> 07:08:09,118
"I am his puppet. "

1619
07:08:09,221 --> 07:08:13,749
"I am his puppet. "

1620
07:08:13,859 --> 07:08:15,656
"Of the one who has the
threads in his hands. "

1621
07:08:15,761 --> 07:08:17,319
"The one who controls me. "

1622
07:08:17,429 --> 07:08:18,760
"My name is... "

1623
07:08:18,864 --> 07:08:19,990
"My name is... "

1624
07:08:20,099 --> 07:08:24,399
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1625
07:08:24,937 --> 07:08:29,738
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1626
07:08:30,376 --> 07:08:32,970
"One King of Avadh... "

1627
07:08:35,147 --> 07:08:40,779
"One King of Avadh stole my heart. "

1628
07:08:40,886 --> 07:08:41,910
"Stole my heart. "

1629
07:08:42,021 --> 07:08:43,045
"My name is... "

1630
07:08:43,155 --> 07:08:44,179
"My name is... "

1631
07:08:44,290 --> 07:08:48,693
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1632
07:08:48,794 --> 07:08:54,164
"My name is Ramkatori. "

1633
07:09:04,677 --> 07:09:07,111
Listen! Hey you, listen!

1634
07:09:08,681 --> 07:09:09,705
Are you all right?

1635
07:09:09,815 --> 07:09:12,682
In King's Ram's rule no
houses need to be locked.

1636
07:09:12,785 --> 07:09:15,720
You do not have to protect the
elephants, horses and the cows.

1637
07:09:15,821 --> 07:09:17,652
So is your donkey going to be
stolen that you are sitting...

1638
07:09:17,756 --> 07:09:18,984
...here guarding it?

1639
07:09:19,091 --> 07:09:20,991
I was not guarding the donkeys!

1640
07:09:21,327 --> 07:09:24,296
I was waiting for the return
of this wretched lady.

1641
07:09:24,396 --> 07:09:26,796
You wretched lady!
You degraded woman!

1642
07:09:26,899 --> 07:09:29,333
Please spare me! Do not beat me.

1643
07:09:29,802 --> 07:09:31,167
Why are you beating me?

1644
07:09:31,270 --> 07:09:33,170
So shall I worship you?

1645
07:09:33,272 --> 07:09:35,001
The food is also not prepared.

1646
07:09:35,107 --> 07:09:37,837
You come and go
whenever you wished.

1647
07:09:37,943 --> 07:09:41,276
You go for one day and come
back after four days.

1648
07:09:41,380 --> 07:09:44,872
You tell me something and you
go and enjoy somewhere else.

1649
07:09:44,983 --> 07:09:47,281
You wretched lady! Tell me.

1650
07:09:47,720 --> 07:09:49,688
Where did you go to
degrade yourself?

1651
07:09:50,189 --> 07:09:52,123
I was in queen Sita's palace.

1652
07:09:52,391 --> 07:09:54,359
You wretched lady! You degraded one!

1653
07:09:54,727 --> 07:09:57,161
You stay in a hut but you
dream about a palace.

1654
07:09:57,262 --> 07:09:59,730
You had gone to learn the
qualities of queen Sita!

1655
07:09:59,832 --> 07:10:01,231
But I am not King Ram!

1656
07:10:01,333 --> 07:10:03,631
Who accepted Sita in spite
of she staying for a year...

1657
07:10:03,736 --> 07:10:05,897
...at Ravan's palace.

1658
07:10:06,004 --> 07:10:09,906
Ram is a king! No one can
point a finger at him.

1659
07:10:10,008 --> 07:10:11,373
No one can speak in front of him.

1660
07:10:11,810 --> 07:10:13,835
But I have to stay in the society.

1661
07:10:13,946 --> 07:10:17,074
Because of you I cannot
tarnish my name.

1662
07:10:17,182 --> 07:10:19,116
You wretched lady get
out of my house.

1663
07:10:20,018 --> 07:10:23,715
If you ever come here again
I will break your legs.

1664
07:10:23,989 --> 07:10:25,786
Get lost! Go away from here,
you degraded woman!

1665
07:10:26,258 --> 07:10:28,988
Get lost! I say get out from here!

1666
07:10:29,228 --> 07:10:30,752
She is not scared of her husband.

1667
07:10:31,296 --> 07:10:32,888
Neither is she worried
about the society.

1668
07:10:34,767 --> 07:10:37,668
What sin did Ramkatori commit
that she was thrown...

1669
07:10:37,770 --> 07:10:39,795
...out of the house after
being severely beaten?

1670
07:10:39,905 --> 07:10:42,203
May that washer man be ruined!

1671
07:10:42,307 --> 07:10:44,775
He even tarnished Sita's name.

1672
07:10:44,877 --> 07:10:46,674
Brother, what would you do
if your wife would be in...

1673
07:10:46,779 --> 07:10:48,337
...Ramkatori's place?

1674
07:10:48,814 --> 07:10:51,180
Instead of throwing
her out of the house.

1675
07:10:51,283 --> 07:10:54,013
I would have tied her up in
a gunny bag and killed her.

1676
07:10:54,319 --> 07:10:56,913
This is the injustice of all
the husbands. Real injustice.

1677
07:10:57,022 --> 07:10:59,889
Then what? Today this has happened
with that washerwoman.

1678
07:10:59,992 --> 07:11:01,687
Tomorrow these men can also
say that Lord Ram...

1679
07:11:01,794 --> 07:11:03,955
...should disown queen Sita.

1680
07:11:04,062 --> 07:11:07,828
According to justice Lord Ram
should disown queen Sita.

1681
07:11:07,933 --> 07:11:09,992
Priest, what have you to say?

1682
07:11:10,102 --> 07:11:11,694
Ramu, in Ram's rule the law
is equal for the king...

1683
07:11:11,804 --> 07:11:14,102
...as well as the people.

1684
07:11:14,907 --> 07:11:17,705
The king should do only that
by which the subjects...

1685
07:11:17,810 --> 07:11:20,176
...learn to have good behavior.

1686
07:11:20,779 --> 07:11:22,906
Otherwise... like the
king so the subjects!

1687
07:11:23,415 --> 07:11:26,043
King Ram's dignity is in doing
what is good for his people.

1688
07:11:26,151 --> 07:11:28,779
So to maintain his dignity he
should disown queen Sita.

1689
07:11:28,887 --> 07:11:30,821
Yes! Yes! He should do the same!

1690
07:11:30,923 --> 07:11:32,720
Yes, yes, that is only
the right thing to do.

1691
07:11:32,825 --> 07:11:35,988
What? You will disown
sister-in-law Sita?

1692
07:11:36,762 --> 07:11:38,229
Even after she went through
the fire test?

1693
07:11:38,997 --> 07:11:42,899
I have seen the fire test and
not the people of Ayodhya.

1694
07:11:43,735 --> 07:11:45,669
Brother, the one to make
this accusation...

1695
07:11:45,771 --> 07:11:47,762
...is a mere simple insensible
washer man.

1696
07:11:48,373 --> 07:11:50,341
Bharat, a washer man too
is a part of society.

1697
07:11:52,010 --> 07:11:53,204
The society is a mirror.

1698
07:11:54,379 --> 07:11:56,074
A person is an important
part of the society.

1699
07:11:57,816 --> 07:12:00,216
And a person's duty is
to respect the society.

1700
07:12:01,453 --> 07:12:04,013
King Ram can destroy
his own desires.

1701
07:12:04,823 --> 07:12:06,188
But he cannot go against the
wishes of his subjects.

1702
07:12:06,892 --> 07:12:11,022
The condition that sister-in-law
is in at present.

1703
07:12:11,396 --> 07:12:12,693
Any heartless man too would
never do such a thing...

1704
07:12:12,798 --> 07:12:15,130
...seeing any woman in
such a condition.

1705
07:12:15,801 --> 07:12:18,702
But even then Sita would prefer
to live respectfully...

1706
07:12:18,804 --> 07:12:20,704
...as a forest dweller than
to stay in the palace...

1707
07:12:20,806 --> 07:12:22,967
...with her name tarnished.

1708
07:12:23,075 --> 07:12:26,977
Brother, how can sister-in-law
bear to be separated from you?

1709
07:12:27,980 --> 07:12:31,643
Even if I plead can you
not change your decision?

1710
07:12:32,351 --> 07:12:35,980
No Laxman! Sita is innocent.

1711
07:12:36,355 --> 07:12:37,379
She is pious!

1712
07:12:38,290 --> 07:12:42,249
Without Sita Ram will be
just like a stone idol.

1713
07:12:43,795 --> 07:12:48,357
Even then King Ram's decision
is to disown Sita!

1714
07:12:49,167 --> 07:12:52,659
Tell me; who from the three
of you will go to leave...

1715
07:12:52,771 --> 07:12:54,739
...Sita in the forest?

1716
07:12:55,040 --> 07:12:56,064
I cannot go!

1717
07:12:56,174 --> 07:12:57,198
Even I cannot go!

1718
07:12:57,309 --> 07:12:58,333
Now even I!

1719
07:12:58,443 --> 07:13:02,675
My Lord, after your decision to
disown Sita it looks like...

1720
07:13:02,781 --> 07:13:07,946
...King Ram has killed the
identity of Lord Ram.

1721
07:13:08,787 --> 07:13:10,687
The duties of a king
have preceded over...

1722
07:13:10,789 --> 07:13:12,279
...the duties of a human being.

1723
07:13:12,758 --> 07:13:15,693
Hanuman, King Ram's main
aim is to protect the...

1724
07:13:15,794 --> 07:13:19,025
...decision of his subjects rather
than his own feelings.

1725
07:13:19,965 --> 07:13:22,365
Because of this people
call him as Ram!

1726
07:13:23,335 --> 07:13:24,427
Forgive me, my Lord.

1727
07:13:26,104 --> 07:13:29,699
But if to be called Ram
you need to disown...

1728
07:13:29,808 --> 07:13:33,904
...a pious, virtuous and
innocent lady like Sita.

1729
07:13:34,846 --> 07:13:39,647
Then I will say that King Ram
has been more heartless...

1730
07:13:39,751 --> 07:13:43,653
...and has inflicted more
pain on queen Sita...

1731
07:13:43,755 --> 07:13:45,780
...than his subjects.

1732
07:13:46,058 --> 07:13:48,322
Hanuman!
- Oh Sire, let me speak.

1733
07:13:49,761 --> 07:13:50,921
The one who has his abilities
as his strength.

1734
07:13:51,363 --> 07:13:52,921
The righteousness as his general.

1735
07:13:53,365 --> 07:13:55,094
Justice as his commander-in-chief.

1736
07:13:55,734 --> 07:13:59,192
Kindness, forgiveness and
obligation as his courts man.

1737
07:14:00,005 --> 07:14:01,734
The strategy is based on truth.

1738
07:14:02,374 --> 07:14:06,674
That King Ramchandra is
not disowning his wife...

1739
07:14:06,778 --> 07:14:10,737
...but he is disowning the truth,
is doing away with righteousness.

1740
07:14:11,116 --> 07:14:12,276
Is eradicating justice.

1741
07:14:12,384 --> 07:14:13,749
No, Hanuman, no!

1742
07:14:14,052 --> 07:14:15,986
Then where is that feeling?

1743
07:14:16,755 --> 07:14:21,124
Where Lord Ram lovingly
called his consort Sita!

1744
07:14:21,827 --> 07:14:25,695
Where is that pain that
you kept shedding tears...

1745
07:14:25,797 --> 07:14:28,288
...till you could find Sita.

1746
07:14:29,134 --> 07:14:32,626
Where is that immense love which
made a husband's life...

1747
07:14:32,738 --> 07:14:35,832
...impossible to live in the
separation of his wife.

1748
07:14:36,708 --> 07:14:40,269
Today such disloyalty
with that love?

1749
07:14:40,746 --> 07:14:42,771
My Lord how can you bear it?

1750
07:14:43,782 --> 07:14:48,242
After you disown her everything
will perish, my Lord.

1751
07:14:48,353 --> 07:14:50,150
Everything will perish!

1752
07:14:50,422 --> 07:14:51,650
Brother Hanuman, do not inflict
more pain on Ram...

1753
07:14:51,757 --> 07:14:53,987
...by saying all this.

1754
07:14:55,794 --> 07:14:58,661
If Ram loses his self control then
it will be very difficult...

1755
07:14:58,764 --> 07:15:01,198
...for him to disown Sita.

1756
07:15:02,234 --> 07:15:03,667
The people will call Sita
as dishonorable...

1757
07:15:03,769 --> 07:15:06,397
...and will always keep pointing
a finger at her.

1758
07:15:06,872 --> 07:15:08,931
Ram will be ruined, Hanuman!

1759
07:15:09,041 --> 07:15:10,736
Ram will not be able to face anyone.

1760
07:15:10,842 --> 07:15:12,104
No, my Lord; no!

1761
07:15:14,112 --> 07:15:18,742
How will mother be able
to bear all this?

1762
07:15:24,389 --> 07:15:27,688
Laxman, you will have to go
to leave Sita in the forest...

1763
07:15:27,793 --> 07:15:30,284
...as soon as it is dawn.

1764
07:15:31,329 --> 07:15:32,660
These are the king's orders.

1765
07:15:33,331 --> 07:15:37,233
King Ram has disowned queen Sita.

1766
07:15:37,869 --> 07:15:40,235
How shall I tell
this to sister-in-law?

1767
07:15:40,739 --> 07:15:43,071
How will I say this?
What will I say?

1768
07:15:44,176 --> 07:15:46,974
Yesterday Sita told me that she
wished to see the forest again.

1769
07:15:47,813 --> 07:15:51,044
Tell her that today her
wish will be fulfilled.

1770
07:15:51,149 --> 07:15:55,984
Brother... - If Laxman disobeys
the king's orders.

1771
07:15:57,756 --> 07:16:01,749
Then it is possible that
Ram may end his life.

1772
07:16:03,295 --> 07:16:05,126
As King Ram orders!

1773
07:16:12,871 --> 07:16:14,668
Brother Laxman, I just casually
said that I would...

1774
07:16:14,773 --> 07:16:17,298
...like to visit the forest again.

1775
07:16:18,176 --> 07:16:21,339
And Raghunandan immediately
fulfilled my wish.

1776
07:16:22,314 --> 07:16:23,338
I am blessed!

1777
07:16:35,961 --> 07:16:37,724
Brother Laxman, why did
you stop the chariot?

1778
07:16:38,330 --> 07:16:44,064
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
I have to make a request to you.

1779
07:16:45,170 --> 07:16:46,694
Why are you so sad?

1780
07:16:47,239 --> 07:16:49,207
Brother Laxman!

1781
07:16:52,277 --> 07:16:53,642
Whatever it is you wish to
tell me... tell me without...

1782
07:16:53,745 --> 07:16:54,803
...any hesitation.

1783
07:16:55,247 --> 07:16:56,737
Do not make me more worried.

1784
07:16:57,849 --> 07:16:59,373
Sister-in-law, how can I tell you?

1785
07:17:00,385 --> 07:17:02,250
I am totally shattered!

1786
07:17:03,188 --> 07:17:06,316
I am an obedient servant
of Raghuveer.

1787
07:17:07,959 --> 07:17:10,154
Has my Raghav given
any special orders?

1788
07:17:11,763 --> 07:17:12,787
Yes, sister-in-law!

1789
07:17:14,032 --> 07:17:21,029
Brother, say it even if it is
the most heartless thing.

1790
07:17:22,741 --> 07:17:26,233
Do not worry! Brother, tell me.

1791
07:17:27,412 --> 07:17:30,680
Sister-in-law, because the subjects...

1792
07:17:30,715 --> 07:17:33,684
...doubt your piousness King
Ram has disowned you.

1793
07:17:39,191 --> 07:17:40,658
Has disowned me!

1794
07:17:41,760 --> 07:17:43,853
Ram! Ram has done that!

1795
07:17:54,806 --> 07:17:57,297
'Oh my God! Ramkatori
has gone crazy!

1796
07:17:57,409 --> 07:17:58,842
She has gone mad! She
has lost her senses!

1797
07:18:02,280 --> 07:18:03,645
As she is thrown out of the
house she is wandering...

1798
07:18:03,748 --> 07:18:05,716
...aimlessly. That poor woman. '

1799
07:18:31,977 --> 07:18:36,971
"Oh Ram!"

1800
07:18:37,249 --> 07:18:40,912
"Oh Ram!"

1801
07:18:59,170 --> 07:19:03,766
"Oh Ram!"

1802
07:19:03,875 --> 07:19:06,708
"Oh Ram!"

1803
07:19:07,979 --> 07:19:16,148
"Oh Ram, how will the Sitas
live in your rule?"

1804
07:19:16,755 --> 07:19:24,753
"Oh Ram, how will the Sitas
live in your rule?"

1805
07:19:25,297 --> 07:19:29,324
"How will the Sitas live?"

1806
07:19:29,768 --> 07:19:33,704
"We innocent ladies. "

1807
07:19:33,805 --> 07:19:38,071
"Oh Ram!"

1808
07:19:38,176 --> 07:19:40,269
"Oh Ram!"

1809
07:19:56,995 --> 07:20:02,627
"Why didn't you kill the women
before their birth?"

1810
07:20:02,734 --> 07:20:09,230
"Why didn't you kill the women?"

1811
07:20:09,808 --> 07:20:14,643
"Why did you drown the
daughter of the earth...

1812
07:20:14,746 --> 07:20:18,238
...in immense sorrow?"

1813
07:20:18,350 --> 07:20:21,911
"This daughter of the earth. "

1814
07:20:22,354 --> 07:20:26,916
"Where should we go?"

1815
07:20:30,929 --> 07:20:34,922
"Where should we go?"

1816
07:20:35,166 --> 07:20:39,102
"We idols of love. "

1817
07:20:39,204 --> 07:20:43,334
"Oh Ram!"

1818
07:20:43,441 --> 07:20:45,932
"Oh Ram!"

1819
07:21:02,827 --> 07:21:10,962
"Oh Father of the universe why did
you give a tearful destiny?"

1820
07:21:11,069 --> 07:21:14,436
"Why did you give us
a sorrowful life?"

1821
07:21:15,206 --> 07:21:23,375
"Why are we always in bondage?"

1822
07:21:23,481 --> 07:21:27,110
"Always in bondage?"

1823
07:21:27,886 --> 07:21:32,323
"We are helpless in our own house. "

1824
07:21:36,194 --> 07:21:40,255
"We are helpless in our own house. "

1825
07:21:40,365 --> 07:21:44,392
"We Sitas are always
surrounded by fire. "

1826
07:21:44,736 --> 07:21:48,797
"Oh Ram!"

1827
07:21:48,907 --> 07:21:51,000
"Oh Ram!"

1828
07:21:53,111 --> 07:22:01,348
"Oh Ram, how will the Sitas
live in your rule?"

1829
07:22:01,719 --> 07:22:05,280
"How will the Sitas live?"

1830
07:22:05,824 --> 07:22:09,783
"We innocent ladies. "

1831
07:22:09,928 --> 07:22:14,024
"Oh Ram!"

1832
07:22:14,132 --> 07:22:18,762
"Oh Ram!"

1833
07:22:21,239 --> 07:22:24,697
Oh Mother Ganges, today only
your doors are open...

1834
07:22:24,809 --> 07:22:27,835
...for this unfortunate Sita.

1835
07:22:28,746 --> 07:22:32,842
Mother, please engulf me
in your arms forever.

1836
07:22:33,184 --> 07:22:35,345
Sita! My child!

1837
07:22:35,753 --> 07:22:36,845
Sage Valmiki!

1838
07:22:36,955 --> 07:22:38,081
Sita, wait!

1839
07:22:41,726 --> 07:22:44,354
My child, to commit suicide
is a great sin.

1840
07:22:45,864 --> 07:22:49,391
A greater sin than that
is to kill your child.

1841
07:22:51,436 --> 07:22:57,773
Baba! Why did
my husband disown me?

1842
07:22:58,176 --> 07:23:00,269
How can I answer that
question to anyone?

1843
07:23:01,713 --> 07:23:03,203
Now there is only one
way left for me.

1844
07:23:04,115 --> 07:23:05,412
To end my life.

1845
07:23:06,851 --> 07:23:10,685
To end your life is not then
of a question and neither...

1846
07:23:10,788 --> 07:23:12,949
...is that an answer.

1847
07:23:13,958 --> 07:23:17,758
My child, you are going
to be a mother.

1848
07:23:18,730 --> 07:23:22,757
A mother never lives for herself
but for her children.

1849
07:23:23,868 --> 07:23:25,426
You will have to live.

1850
07:23:26,804 --> 07:23:29,705
But Baba...
- My child, king Ram's duty is to...

1851
07:23:29,807 --> 07:23:31,900
...protect his subjects.

1852
07:23:32,844 --> 07:23:35,312
And Sita's duty is to carry it out.

1853
07:23:36,381 --> 07:23:38,645
My child, from today this
Valmiki's hermitage...

1854
07:23:38,750 --> 07:23:41,742
...will be your maternal house.

1855
07:23:42,854 --> 07:23:44,845
Come! Come with me.

1856
07:23:51,062 --> 07:23:54,395
This horse is being
left for victory.

1857
07:23:54,899 --> 07:23:57,663
You will have to defeat the
one who catches this horse...

1858
07:23:57,769 --> 07:24:00,738
...and bring this horse safely back.

1859
07:24:01,439 --> 07:24:02,997
Bajrangbali!
- My Lord!

1860
07:24:03,408 --> 07:24:05,706
Shatrughan! Pushkar!

1861
07:24:05,810 --> 07:24:06,834
Yes king!

1862
07:24:07,312 --> 07:24:09,280
It is your responsibility
to protect this horse.

1863
07:24:09,380 --> 07:24:10,813
Hail Ram!

1864
07:24:16,788 --> 07:24:17,948
Mother!
- Mother!

1865
07:24:18,056 --> 07:24:20,422
Mother! We too will go to
Ayodhya with Gurudev.

1866
07:24:21,059 --> 07:24:22,686
The saga of Ram that Gurudev
has taught us...

1867
07:24:22,794 --> 07:24:24,694
...we will go and narrate
it in front of Lord Ram.

1868
07:24:24,796 --> 07:24:26,696
...we will go and narrate
it in front of Lord Ram.

1869
07:24:26,798 --> 07:24:29,699
We will see that unjust
Ram who disowned...

1870
07:24:29,801 --> 07:24:31,826
...his innocent wife Sita for
the sake of his subjects.

1871
07:24:31,936 --> 07:24:33,301
No!
- Mother, why not?

1872
07:24:33,805 --> 07:24:35,898
We want an answer from king Ram.

1873
07:24:36,207 --> 07:24:38,641
How can he perform an
'Ashwameghyagnya by...

1874
07:24:38,743 --> 07:24:41,041
...keeping a golden idol of Sita
thinking it to be pious.

1875
07:24:41,145 --> 07:24:42,737
When he believes her to be unholy.

1876
07:24:44,349 --> 07:24:47,750
My son, this is the job
of the king to see.

1877
07:24:48,353 --> 07:24:49,820
Not the ones who stay
in a hermitage.

1878
07:24:49,921 --> 07:24:51,650
The one who has his duties
towards his people...

1879
07:24:51,756 --> 07:24:54,088
...he will have to answer
our questions.

1880
07:24:54,192 --> 07:24:56,183
Why this injustice with Sita?

1881
07:24:57,028 --> 07:24:59,861
He believes the golden
idol to be holy.

1882
07:24:59,964 --> 07:25:02,762
Then why does he pretend to believe
that Sita is unholy?

1883
07:25:04,068 --> 07:25:05,797
Ram is Sita's husband.

1884
07:25:06,337 --> 07:25:08,328
He can accept anything about her.

1885
07:25:08,439 --> 07:25:11,738
We will ask all the great priests
and ministers there.

1886
07:25:11,843 --> 07:25:13,071
Why such injustice?

1887
07:25:13,778 --> 07:25:16,713
No my son; you are too small you
cannot talk like this.

1888
07:25:16,814 --> 07:25:18,907
We will ask the subjects of Ayodhya.

1889
07:25:19,017 --> 07:25:20,041
Why this injustice?

1890
07:25:20,151 --> 07:25:22,676
Luv Kush! King Ram can accept
this as a revolt...

1891
07:25:22,787 --> 07:25:24,982
...and can punish you.

1892
07:25:25,089 --> 07:25:27,683
The children of the Goddess of
the forest have the strength...

1893
07:25:27,792 --> 07:25:29,783
...to teach a lesson to the one who
gives unnecessary punishment.

1894
07:25:29,894 --> 07:25:33,762
The injustice done to Sita is like
injustice done to all the women.

1895
07:25:33,865 --> 07:25:35,958
We will avenge this injustice!

1896
07:25:36,067 --> 07:25:38,729
No! No! No! You cannot
go to Ayodhya!

1897
07:25:39,137 --> 07:25:40,798
O' forest dweller, let them go.

1898
07:25:41,139 --> 07:25:44,631
If a washer man can speak
in the rule of Ram...

1899
07:25:44,742 --> 07:25:48,337
...then why can't the sons
of a forest dweller speak?

1900
07:25:48,746 --> 07:25:50,714
Sage! - My child, do not fear.

1901
07:25:51,683 --> 07:25:54,709
I will not allow any thing
inauspicious to happen in Ayodhya.

1902
07:25:56,020 --> 07:26:00,184
Luv! Kush! Take your
mother's blessings.

1903
07:26:02,894 --> 07:26:03,986
God bless you, my children.

1904
07:26:17,175 --> 07:26:20,667
My Raghuveer, if you wished...

1905
07:26:20,778 --> 07:26:24,976
...you could have remarried.

1906
07:26:25,783 --> 07:26:31,619
But establishing my idol
in a holy fire veneration...

1907
07:26:31,723 --> 07:26:38,185
...proves that you accept
that I am pious and holy.

1908
07:26:38,996 --> 07:26:42,830
You disowned Sita for the
sake of your subjects.

1909
07:26:43,267 --> 07:26:45,030
But she still resides in your heart.

1910
07:26:45,737 --> 07:26:49,002
This is Sita's good fortune.

1911
07:26:49,707 --> 07:26:53,234
You... Raghuveer, you are
great! You are great!

1912
07:26:54,312 --> 07:26:58,840
Sita is obliged to you
for many births to come.

1913
07:27:01,419 --> 07:27:02,647
She is obliged to you.

1914
07:27:10,728 --> 07:27:17,099
"O' Ideal of conduct. "

1915
07:27:17,702 --> 07:27:26,838
"O' Ideal of conduct why did you
violate the code of conduct?"

1916
07:27:27,845 --> 07:27:33,613
O' Ram, why have you installed
this idol of Sita...

1917
07:27:33,718 --> 07:27:38,121
...and disowned the real Sita?"

1918
07:27:38,222 --> 07:27:40,281
Stop this song!
- "O' Ram!"

1919
07:27:40,391 --> 07:27:41,949
Soldiers, arrest them!

1920
07:27:42,760 --> 07:27:45,627
Throw these children in the
dungeon who are accusing...

1921
07:27:45,730 --> 07:27:48,221
...the Ideal of conduct.

1922
07:27:48,733 --> 07:27:49,927
Soldiers, wait!

1923
07:27:50,334 --> 07:27:51,801
Quiet Laxman, quiet!

1924
07:27:52,904 --> 07:27:56,032
Children, sing your song.
I want to hear it.

1925
07:28:02,180 --> 07:28:08,380
"O' Ideal of conduct tell us... "

1926
07:28:08,953 --> 07:28:17,861
"O' Ideal of conduct why did you
violate the code of conduct?"

1927
07:28:18,796 --> 07:28:24,666
O' Ram, why have you installed
this idol of Sita...

1928
07:28:24,769 --> 07:28:29,001
...and disowned the real Sita?"

1929
07:28:29,106 --> 07:28:31,097
"O' Ram!"

1930
07:28:44,121 --> 07:28:48,615
"Why didn't you bestow
your love on the one...

1931
07:28:48,726 --> 07:28:53,686
...who always bestowed
her love on you. "

1932
07:28:54,265 --> 07:28:59,635
"Why didn't you be with her
who suffered so much...

1933
07:28:59,737 --> 07:29:04,071
...because of you. "

1934
07:29:04,342 --> 07:29:08,745
"Why didn't you be with her?"

1935
07:29:09,747 --> 07:29:15,845
"What sin did that queen commit?"

1936
07:29:16,354 --> 07:29:20,654
"What sin did that queen
commit that you...

1937
07:29:20,758 --> 07:29:25,388
...ruined her destiny?"

1938
07:29:26,697 --> 07:29:31,600
O' Ram, why have you installed
this idol of Sita...

1939
07:29:31,702 --> 07:29:36,730
...and disowned the real Sita?"

1940
07:29:36,841 --> 07:29:38,672
"O' Ram!"

1941
07:29:51,822 --> 07:30:01,720
"Tell us why are you so heartless
sitting here in Ayodhya?"

1942
07:30:02,099 --> 07:30:11,371
"You have become a God deserting
your devoted wife. "

1943
07:30:12,176 --> 07:30:15,976
"Why are you sitting
here like a God?"

1944
07:30:17,281 --> 07:30:23,743
"Why did the king to that Sati... "

1945
07:30:24,188 --> 07:30:32,857
"Why did you king strangulate
that Sati?"

1946
07:30:34,365 --> 07:30:39,667
O' Ram, why have you installed
this idol of Sita...

1947
07:30:39,770 --> 07:30:44,332
...and disowned the real Sita?"

1948
07:30:44,442 --> 07:30:46,774
"O' Ram!"

1949
07:30:59,890 --> 07:31:06,022
"Why did you break that
bow in Mithila?"

1950
07:31:06,797 --> 07:31:12,861
Answer us! Answer us!"

1951
07:31:12,970 --> 07:31:19,170
"Why did you marry Sita?"

1952
07:31:19,910 --> 07:31:25,371
Answer us! Answer us!"

1953
07:31:25,950 --> 07:31:32,185
"Why did you disown your own wife?"

1954
07:31:32,289 --> 07:31:38,319
"Why did you leave that virtuous
Sita in the jungle?"

1955
07:31:38,763 --> 07:31:45,168
"Why didn't you give
up your throne?"

1956
07:31:45,369 --> 07:31:50,966
Answer us! Answer us!"

1957
07:31:51,075 --> 07:31:57,412
"Why didn't you give up this rule?"

1958
07:31:57,715 --> 07:32:02,846
Answer us! Answer us!"

1959
07:32:03,220 --> 07:32:09,750
"O' King, you do not
feign innocence!"

1960
07:32:10,394 --> 07:32:14,694
"Be a human being. "

1961
07:32:14,799 --> 07:32:17,893
"Be a human being. "

1962
07:32:18,903 --> 07:32:23,863
"O' king, do not be a God
but be a human being. "

1963
07:32:24,375 --> 07:32:28,141
"O' king, do not try to be God!"

1964
07:32:28,345 --> 07:32:32,975
"O' king, do not try to be God!"

1965
07:32:40,291 --> 07:32:44,091
My dear children, your
song is very beautiful.

1966
07:32:45,696 --> 07:32:47,926
Come, come and embrace me.

1967
07:32:48,032 --> 07:32:52,332
No! The heart that disowned
a virtuous lady like Sita.

1968
07:32:53,003 --> 07:32:55,198
We do not wish to embrace
that heartless man.

1969
07:32:55,306 --> 07:32:57,331
The one who sheds tears,
what answer can he give?

1970
07:32:57,708 --> 07:32:58,732
Come on, brother!

1971
07:33:02,313 --> 07:33:06,010
King, both these children
are my students.

1972
07:33:06,984 --> 07:33:08,144
Ram, they are just children.

1973
07:33:08,886 --> 07:33:11,878
This Ram bows down in front
of the great sage.

1974
07:33:17,194 --> 07:33:21,221
Look here king Shakun. This is
Anjali the mother of Bajrangbali.

1975
07:33:24,034 --> 07:33:25,695
Go, go and do your job.

1976
07:33:25,903 --> 07:33:29,862
Mother! Mother!

1977
07:33:30,975 --> 07:33:34,103
Mother! Mother!

1978
07:33:35,279 --> 07:33:39,648
Mother, please save me! Please
have mercy on this child.

1979
07:33:39,750 --> 07:33:40,774
Who are you?

1980
07:33:41,085 --> 07:33:42,916
I am that unfortunate Shakun.

1981
07:33:43,854 --> 07:33:50,225
One great king has taken an oath
to kill me before sun set.

1982
07:33:51,695 --> 07:33:55,256
But I will not leave the feet
of Bajrangbali's mother.

1983
07:33:56,000 --> 07:33:57,991
I will lay my life here!

1984
07:33:58,102 --> 07:34:00,093
My son, my son Hanuman is not here.

1985
07:34:00,704 --> 07:34:01,728
Where has he gone?

1986
07:34:02,239 --> 07:34:05,697
But I know that non violence is the
primary duty of a human being.

1987
07:34:06,243 --> 07:34:08,677
If you want to do a good
deed then call Hanuman.

1988
07:34:09,013 --> 07:34:11,004
But if you wish to do a bad
deed then do not call him.

1989
07:34:11,849 --> 07:34:14,283
Mother, please tell me that
you will save my life.

1990
07:34:14,718 --> 07:34:18,984
I gave you my promise!
I will call Hanuman.

1991
07:34:24,795 --> 07:34:32,895
Madhuri! Madhuri! Madhuri!

1992
07:34:34,371 --> 07:34:36,635
Mother!
- My son!

1993
07:34:38,342 --> 07:34:39,366
Mother, what is the command?

1994
07:34:40,110 --> 07:34:41,839
My son, I wish to ask
something from you.

1995
07:34:42,112 --> 07:34:44,637
It is my good fortune that
my mother is asking...

1996
07:34:44,748 --> 07:34:45,908
...something from me.

1997
07:34:46,083 --> 07:34:47,641
Mother, ask me; I am promising you.

1998
07:34:48,152 --> 07:34:52,384
My son, I have promised king Shakun
that you will save his life.

1999
07:34:52,957 --> 07:34:54,652
Some king has taken an oath
that before sunset...

2000
07:34:54,758 --> 07:34:56,225
...he will kill him.

2001
07:34:57,027 --> 07:34:59,825
King Shakun, tell me; who is the
one who has taken this oath?

2002
07:35:00,164 --> 07:35:03,656
How can I tell you?

2003
07:35:04,001 --> 07:35:06,162
His name is on the tip of my tongue.

2004
07:35:06,270 --> 07:35:08,830
But my tongue is shivering.

2005
07:35:09,173 --> 07:35:11,198
Why?
- With fear.

2006
07:35:11,709 --> 07:35:13,677
I hope that you will not
break your promise.

2007
07:35:14,378 --> 07:35:16,676
King Shakun, nothing is more
precious to Hanuman...

2008
07:35:16,780 --> 07:35:18,338
...than his mother's words.

2009
07:35:19,416 --> 07:35:22,681
I take the oath of Lord Ram and
say that till I am there...

2010
07:35:22,786 --> 07:35:24,686
...no one can harm you.

2011
07:35:25,122 --> 07:35:30,685
I will tell you. His name is...
his name is... his name is...

2012
07:35:30,828 --> 07:35:32,056
King Ramchandra!

2013
07:35:33,898 --> 07:35:34,956
King Ramchandra!

2014
07:35:35,733 --> 07:35:37,701
King of Ayodhya, Ramchandra!

2015
07:35:38,669 --> 07:35:39,693
What is your offence?

2016
07:35:40,004 --> 07:35:42,302
Offence? I have not committed
any offence.

2017
07:35:42,806 --> 07:35:44,068
But it is sage Narad's offence.

2018
07:35:44,408 --> 07:35:48,071
At his behest I did not
greet sage Vishwamitra.

2019
07:35:48,412 --> 07:35:53,645
And in a fit of fury he took
an oath from king Ram...

2020
07:35:53,751 --> 07:35:59,018
...that today before sun set
my head would be at his feet.

2021
07:35:59,223 --> 07:36:02,681
Bajrangbali, please
protect me from Ram.

2022
07:36:07,197 --> 07:36:08,824
King Shakun, what have you done?

2023
07:36:09,934 --> 07:36:11,731
You took an oath from me and
put me into trouble.

2024
07:36:12,937 --> 07:36:14,097
Now what shall I do?

2025
07:36:15,306 --> 07:36:18,332
On one hand is my mother
who gave birth to me.

2026
07:36:19,310 --> 07:36:20,675
On the other hand is my Lord.

2027
07:36:21,712 --> 07:36:23,907
Where I have taken an oath
to serve him all my life.

2028
07:36:25,382 --> 07:36:28,977
In front of whom I never
raised my eyes.

2029
07:36:29,720 --> 07:36:31,847
How can I raise my head
in front of him?

2030
07:36:33,023 --> 07:36:38,256
I wish that before I face such a
calamity I should behead myself.

2031
07:36:38,929 --> 07:36:39,953
I should kill myself.

2032
07:36:40,297 --> 07:36:44,165
Hanuman, it is cowardice to think
about committing suicide.

2033
07:36:44,868 --> 07:36:46,199
It is like insulting me.

2034
07:36:47,938 --> 07:36:50,634
You are the son of such
a mother who has learnt...

2035
07:36:50,741 --> 07:36:52,265
...to live with self respect.

2036
07:36:53,310 --> 07:36:54,334
Do not forget that.

2037
07:36:54,812 --> 07:36:57,645
Then mother, the hands which
always raised to salute...

2038
07:36:57,748 --> 07:37:01,047
...my lord, how can I take
a mace in those hands?

2039
07:37:02,052 --> 07:37:05,647
How can a devotee or a servant
of a God fight with him?

2040
07:37:06,390 --> 07:37:09,052
The one who is calm and intelligent
never fear problems.

2041
07:37:09,994 --> 07:37:11,256
My son, they try to find a solution.

2042
07:37:13,230 --> 07:37:15,357
My son, Lord Shiva will help you.

2043
07:37:16,433 --> 07:37:17,730
Lord Shiva!

2044
07:37:18,969 --> 07:37:23,668
' Bajrangbali, why do you forget
that the name Ram...

2045
07:37:23,774 --> 07:37:25,105
...is the saviour of all. '

2046
07:37:29,279 --> 07:37:31,941
Mother, I will find out! I
will find out a solution.

2047
07:37:32,249 --> 07:37:33,614
Where you will not be ashamed and...

2048
07:37:33,717 --> 07:37:36,049
...my Lord too will not
be in a dilemma.

2049
07:37:36,754 --> 07:37:38,813
Come king Shakun.
- Come on.

2050
07:37:42,993 --> 07:37:44,722
You sit here and keep chanting
the name of Ram.

2051
07:37:45,129 --> 07:37:47,620
What if Ram releases an arrow at me?

2052
07:37:47,731 --> 07:37:49,961
The chanting of Lord Ram's
name will be like a wall.

2053
07:37:50,067 --> 07:37:51,796
Yes, that will be like a barrier.

2054
07:37:52,403 --> 07:37:59,639
No! No! The moment Ram
releases his arrow...

2055
07:37:59,743 --> 07:38:04,009
...that barrier will collapse.

2056
07:38:04,348 --> 07:38:08,910
And there will be destruction
in the entire universe.

2057
07:38:09,153 --> 07:38:12,213
And then everything
will be destroyed.

2058
07:38:13,690 --> 07:38:15,157
Bajrangbali, what do you say?

2059
07:38:16,160 --> 07:38:18,685
The one who is going to die
cannot believe anyone.

2060
07:38:19,696 --> 07:38:21,163
Don't you have faith
in Lord Ram's name?

2061
07:38:22,699 --> 07:38:25,133
No!
- Then see this.

2062
07:38:26,303 --> 07:38:33,004
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2063
07:38:33,644 --> 07:38:39,276
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!

2064
07:38:39,383 --> 07:38:40,907
Are these stones or kites?

2065
07:38:41,385 --> 07:38:43,216
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
- What is this?

2066
07:38:43,654 --> 07:38:45,144
This has become like a wall.
- Ram! Ram! Ram!

2067
07:38:45,789 --> 07:38:48,849
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2068
07:38:49,960 --> 07:38:53,623
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2069
07:38:54,131 --> 07:38:55,928
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2070
07:38:57,334 --> 07:39:02,294
Ram! Ram!

2071
07:39:04,141 --> 07:39:07,372
Ram! Bajrangbali, now I accept.

2072
07:39:07,945 --> 07:39:09,378
I accept this. I accept this.

2073
07:39:10,080 --> 07:39:11,741
The one who is dying
too will have faith.

2074
07:39:12,349 --> 07:39:15,113
Go! Fearlessly go and
sit on that wall.

2075
07:39:15,886 --> 07:39:17,820
When I am here no
one can harm you.

2076
07:39:17,921 --> 07:39:18,945
Okay!

2077
07:39:22,092 --> 07:39:24,652
Brother, it is not necessary
for you to use your bow...

2078
07:39:24,761 --> 07:39:28,288
...for such a small task
when Bharat is here.

2079
07:39:29,366 --> 07:39:33,598
Before sun set king Shakun's
head will be at Gurudev's feet.

2080
07:39:35,105 --> 07:39:36,129
Please allow me.

2081
07:39:38,275 --> 07:39:39,299
You can go!

2082
07:39:39,710 --> 07:39:46,912
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2083
07:39:47,251 --> 07:39:53,747
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2084
07:39:53,857 --> 07:39:55,347
A wall made in Ram's name?

2085
07:39:55,926 --> 07:39:59,692
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2086
07:39:59,997 --> 07:40:03,296
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2087
07:40:03,400 --> 07:40:05,630
This is definitely some
plan to save himself.

2088
07:40:05,736 --> 07:40:09,638
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2089
07:40:09,973 --> 07:40:11,770
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2090
07:40:12,876 --> 07:40:16,642
King Shakun who insulted
Gurudev Vishwamitra...

2091
07:40:16,747 --> 07:40:17,771
...in Ram's meeting.

2092
07:40:18,749 --> 07:40:21,741
You have planned a good charade
to save yourself from death.

2093
07:40:21,852 --> 07:40:22,944
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2094
07:40:23,053 --> 07:40:26,648
But Bharat's one arrow will
destroy all the evil...

2095
07:40:26,757 --> 07:40:27,917
...that you have woven around you.

2096
07:40:28,025 --> 07:40:30,653
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2097
07:40:30,761 --> 07:40:33,161
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!
Ram! Ram! Ram!

2098
07:40:33,697 --> 07:40:35,665
Ram, you are playing a dual game.

2099
07:40:36,099 --> 07:40:39,296
On one hand you send Bharat
to behead Shakun.

2100
07:40:39,970 --> 07:40:41,665
On the other hand you are
interested in increasing...

2101
07:40:41,772 --> 07:40:43,069
...the importance of your name?

2102
07:40:43,807 --> 07:40:47,368
Gurudev, you have
doubts on your Ram?

2103
07:40:47,477 --> 07:40:49,240
It is not suspicion;
it is the truth.

2104
07:40:49,713 --> 07:40:50,737
Bharat is the witness.

2105
07:40:51,248 --> 07:40:54,809
Bharat! - Brother, a wall is
erected by the name of Ram.

2106
07:40:55,185 --> 07:40:56,982
Shakun is also chanting your name.

2107
07:40:57,721 --> 07:41:00,087
My arrow too got burnt by
the chants of Ram's name.

2108
07:41:00,324 --> 07:41:02,315
Ram, tell me. Tell me.

2109
07:41:02,726 --> 07:41:03,750
Why are you doing this?

2110
07:41:03,860 --> 07:41:05,953
Narayan! Narayan!

2111
07:41:06,330 --> 07:41:07,388
Someone else does the work.

2112
07:41:07,798 --> 07:41:08,856
And someone else is blamed for it.

2113
07:41:09,066 --> 07:41:11,694
Sage Vishwamitra, only Ram's
devotee can make...

2114
07:41:11,802 --> 07:41:13,429
...a wall by chanting Ram's name.

2115
07:41:13,937 --> 07:41:16,701
Only Hanuman is such a devotee.

2116
07:41:19,276 --> 07:41:20,300
Hanuman!

2117
07:41:20,777 --> 07:41:22,802
Hanuman can go against Ram?

2118
07:41:23,213 --> 07:41:24,237
A fight between Ram and Hanuman?

2119
07:41:24,348 --> 07:41:25,372
What am I hearing?

2120
07:41:26,350 --> 07:41:27,840
A fight between the
lord and the servant?

2121
07:41:28,285 --> 07:41:29,411
A war between a devotee and his God?

2122
07:41:30,087 --> 07:41:31,213
A war between Ram and Hanuman?

2123
07:41:31,989 --> 07:41:36,722
Ram! This is a war between
power and devotion.

2124
07:41:37,427 --> 07:41:41,955
I had bestowed power on you when
I was teaching you artillery.

2125
07:41:42,399 --> 07:41:46,893
Do not forget that all power
is worthless before that.

2126
07:41:47,004 --> 07:41:51,668
Gurudev, I will myself shoot the
arrow of power!.

2127
07:41:52,743 --> 07:41:55,109
Narayan! Narayan!

2128
07:41:56,446 --> 07:41:58,346
King Shakun, the time is very bad.

2129
07:41:58,882 --> 07:42:00,076
But why?

2130
07:42:00,250 --> 07:42:02,912
Lord Ram himself is coming
here with the Shaktiban.

2131
07:42:03,020 --> 07:42:08,686
No! No! Bajrangbali, Lord Ram
is himself coming here...

2132
07:42:08,792 --> 07:42:11,283
...with his Shaktiban.

2133
07:42:11,728 --> 07:42:12,854
I am going away from here.

2134
07:42:13,196 --> 07:42:15,391
Why does the one who is going
to die escape from here?

2135
07:42:15,799 --> 07:42:20,168
Do not fear! The Shaktiban will
be confronted by power.

2136
07:42:22,973 --> 07:42:25,441
Hail Sita Ram!

2137
07:42:27,277 --> 07:42:29,336
That's it!

2138
07:42:29,980 --> 07:42:32,881
Please come; come and
sit on the battlefield.

2139
07:42:33,850 --> 07:42:35,943
You only will have to sit there.

2140
07:42:36,286 --> 07:42:37,344
You sit there!

2141
07:42:37,788 --> 07:42:40,780
Hail Sita Ram! Hail Sita Ram!

2142
07:42:41,158 --> 07:42:42,785
The one who is going to
die can do anything.

2143
07:42:43,293 --> 07:42:44,920
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2144
07:42:45,829 --> 07:42:47,194
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2145
07:42:47,297 --> 07:42:48,787
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2146
07:42:48,965 --> 07:42:50,262
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2147
07:42:50,934 --> 07:42:52,299
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2148
07:42:54,404 --> 07:42:55,996
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2149
07:42:56,340 --> 07:42:57,830
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2150
07:42:58,041 --> 07:43:00,874
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2151
07:43:01,244 --> 07:43:04,407
Shakun! Call your protector!

2152
07:43:05,282 --> 07:43:09,343
And tell him that the person who
hides his face is a coward.

2153
07:43:11,355 --> 07:43:12,379
Hail, hail Ram!

2154
07:43:13,890 --> 07:43:16,324
It's not ethical for the servant
to confront the Lord.

2155
07:43:17,060 --> 07:43:19,688
But the Lord has challenged
the servant to...

2156
07:43:19,796 --> 07:43:21,423
...carry out his duties.

2157
07:43:22,332 --> 07:43:23,356
The servant is right
in front of you.

2158
07:43:23,967 --> 07:43:24,991
Shoot the Shaktiban

2159
07:43:26,069 --> 07:43:29,903
Behead your servant and fulfill
your promise, my Lord.

2160
07:43:30,307 --> 07:43:32,298
Bajrang I want Shakun's head.

2161
07:43:33,210 --> 07:43:34,700
Handover Shakun to me.

2162
07:43:36,012 --> 07:43:38,173
Protecting Shakun is
my mother's oath.

2163
07:43:39,049 --> 07:43:40,983
I'll fulfill my oath even
if I have to lay my life.

2164
07:43:41,785 --> 07:43:44,845
Hanuman, don't compel Ram
to shoot the Shaktiban.

2165
07:43:45,222 --> 07:43:47,349
We both are helpless because
of our oath my Lord.

2166
07:43:47,891 --> 07:43:48,915
Shoot the Shaktiban.

2167
07:43:49,092 --> 07:43:50,650
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2168
07:43:50,761 --> 07:43:52,661
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2169
07:43:52,763 --> 07:43:55,357
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2170
07:43:55,899 --> 07:43:57,833
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2171
07:43:57,934 --> 07:44:03,770
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2172
07:44:04,107 --> 07:44:06,837
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2173
07:44:06,943 --> 07:44:09,741
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2174
07:44:09,846 --> 07:44:12,406
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2175
07:44:12,516 --> 07:44:15,007
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2176
07:44:15,118 --> 07:44:17,814
Hail, hail, Sita Ram!

2177
07:44:18,054 --> 07:44:21,387
Bajrangbali! Bajrangbali!
Lord Ram went away.

2178
07:44:23,794 --> 07:44:27,389
Narayan! Narayan! My life is saved.

2179
07:44:28,131 --> 07:44:31,100
Who told you that Lord Ram
will not come back again?

2180
07:44:31,668 --> 07:44:34,637
King Shakun, it is not yet sunset.
- Oh my God!

2181
07:44:35,238 --> 07:44:40,642
Ram, it was your oath that you
would keep king Shakun's...

2182
07:44:40,744 --> 07:44:42,712
...head at my feet before sunset.

2183
07:44:43,146 --> 07:44:44,841
Where is your Raghukul's tradition?

2184
07:44:45,682 --> 07:44:47,775
I may die but I will always
fulfill my oath.

2185
07:44:48,685 --> 07:44:50,983
Do you wish to tarnish the
name of the Raghu dynasty?

2186
07:44:51,087 --> 07:44:55,649
Gurudev! Before the name of the
Raghu dynasty gets tarnished.

2187
07:44:56,026 --> 07:44:58,017
This Laxman will destroy
the reason for it.

2188
07:44:58,128 --> 07:45:02,030
Laxman! I am not ParshuRam.

2189
07:45:02,399 --> 07:45:03,696
I am Vishwamitra.

2190
07:45:04,367 --> 07:45:06,062
The one in front of whom Lord
Brahma too accepted defeat.

2191
07:45:06,369 --> 07:45:09,099
Sage I am not Brahma!
Please remember that!

2192
07:45:09,206 --> 07:45:10,230
Laxman!

2193
07:45:10,874 --> 07:45:13,138
You have my oath if you
say one more word.

2194
07:45:14,244 --> 07:45:16,269
Gurudev's blessings are
on this Raghu dynasty.

2195
07:45:17,347 --> 07:45:18,678
Gurudev, you please be clam.

2196
07:45:20,116 --> 07:45:23,347
I will use the Ramban
to fulfill my oath.

2197
07:45:23,820 --> 07:45:26,220
Ramban? Definitely there
will be destruction.

2198
07:45:26,323 --> 07:45:27,415
Destruction is certain!

2199
07:45:28,825 --> 07:45:31,089
Narayan! Narayan!

2200
07:45:31,328 --> 07:45:33,626
King Shakun, beware! Lord
Ram will himself...

2201
07:45:33,730 --> 07:45:35,254
...will shoot the Ramban!

2202
07:45:35,398 --> 07:45:37,696
No one has ever saved himself
from the Ramban!

2203
07:45:37,934 --> 07:45:39,367
Ramban!

2204
07:45:44,674 --> 07:45:47,734
Be my shield! Bajrangbali!

2205
07:45:47,844 --> 07:45:50,870
What can a person who is dying do?

2206
07:45:51,681 --> 07:45:52,705
Hanuman, move away!

2207
07:45:53,283 --> 07:45:56,650
I will shoot the Ramban
to fulfill my oath.

2208
07:45:56,820 --> 07:45:59,653
My Lord, you only have taught
me that duty is greater...

2209
07:45:59,756 --> 07:46:01,246
...than emotions.

2210
07:46:01,958 --> 07:46:03,653
And whose shield is
Ram's name then...

2211
07:46:03,760 --> 07:46:05,387
...why should he move away?

2212
07:46:08,298 --> 07:46:10,129
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2213
07:46:10,233 --> 07:46:11,996
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2214
07:46:12,102 --> 07:46:13,831
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2215
07:46:15,705 --> 07:46:17,332
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2216
07:46:17,707 --> 07:46:18,799
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail...

2217
07:46:21,044 --> 07:46:22,671
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2218
07:46:25,015 --> 07:46:26,346
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2219
07:46:26,449 --> 07:46:27,916
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2220
07:46:29,185 --> 07:46:30,777
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2221
07:46:30,887 --> 07:46:32,320
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2222
07:46:34,658 --> 07:46:37,218
Hail Sita Ram! - Oh God,
please help in this dilemma.

2223
07:46:37,327 --> 07:46:39,818
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2224
07:46:41,831 --> 07:46:43,298
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2225
07:46:43,400 --> 07:46:44,958
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2226
07:46:45,235 --> 07:46:46,702
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2227
07:46:46,937 --> 07:46:48,336
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2228
07:46:48,738 --> 07:46:50,069
Hail Sita Ram!
- Hail, hail, Hanuman!

2229
07:46:59,816 --> 07:47:03,115
Ram, you proved to be in capable
in carrying out your oath.

2230
07:47:03,353 --> 07:47:04,377
Give me that bow and arrow!

2231
07:47:04,888 --> 07:47:06,253
I will kill Shakun!

2232
07:47:06,356 --> 07:47:10,190
Forgive me! Please forgive
me, sage Vishwamitra!

2233
07:47:10,694 --> 07:47:14,061
Now my head is at your feet.

2234
07:47:14,297 --> 07:47:15,321
Yes, sage Vishwamitra!

2235
07:47:16,066 --> 07:47:20,833
Before sunset, king Shakun's
head is at your feet.

2236
07:47:21,237 --> 07:47:22,261
Please forgive him.

2237
07:47:24,240 --> 07:47:26,674
Shakun!
- My Lord! My Lord!

2238
07:47:28,111 --> 07:47:30,079
Go! I have forgiven you!

2239
07:47:30,313 --> 07:47:32,747
You have forgiven me?

2240
07:47:34,751 --> 07:47:36,082
You gained greater respect.

2241
07:47:37,120 --> 07:47:38,849
Ram's oath too was fulfilled.

2242
07:47:39,189 --> 07:47:40,781
Bajrangbali's oath
too was fulfilled.

2243
07:47:40,890 --> 07:47:42,619
And my life was saved!

2244
07:47:42,859 --> 07:47:45,157
The one to die will never die now.

2245
07:47:46,029 --> 07:47:47,860
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!

2246
07:47:47,964 --> 07:47:49,363
My Lord, you are great!
You are great!

2247
07:47:50,000 --> 07:47:51,365
My mother's oath was respected.

2248
07:47:51,801 --> 07:47:54,065
The King of Raghukul...
hail to Lord Ram!

2249
07:47:54,270 --> 07:47:57,637
My Lord, two children have caught
the venerated horse...

2250
07:47:57,741 --> 07:47:58,799
...near sage Valmiki's hermitage.

2251
07:47:59,075 --> 07:48:00,736
A serious war is going on!

2252
07:48:01,077 --> 07:48:02,305
Hail Lord Ram!

2253
07:48:15,959 --> 07:48:16,983
Brother!

2254
07:48:20,096 --> 07:48:21,825
Leave me! Leave me!

2255
07:48:22,999 --> 07:48:25,661
Leave me You monkey, leave me!

2256
07:48:26,302 --> 07:48:27,326
Leave me!

2257
07:48:38,181 --> 07:48:40,274
Mother! Mother!

2258
07:48:41,885 --> 07:48:45,082
Mother! Just see this
ape is taking me away!

2259
07:48:45,855 --> 07:48:47,254
Mother Sita! - Mother!

2260
07:48:48,324 --> 07:48:49,348
Hanuman!

2261
07:49:04,407 --> 07:49:06,034
You had carried away
my brother, isn't it?

2262
07:49:06,142 --> 07:49:07,166
Now see this!

2263
07:49:10,814 --> 07:49:16,150
Come. Come brother! We will
take him to mother.

2264
07:49:16,686 --> 07:49:17,710
Mother! Mother!

2265
07:49:17,887 --> 07:49:20,947
Mother, just see what
a toy we have brought.

2266
07:49:21,758 --> 07:49:24,784
He is an ape but mother
he is very simple.

2267
07:49:25,695 --> 07:49:27,890
My son, why have you tied him up?

2268
07:49:28,698 --> 07:49:31,826
He is mighty and capable of respect.

2269
07:49:32,235 --> 07:49:35,671
He is the son of Lord Wind,
Hanuman who destroyed Lanka.

2270
07:49:36,072 --> 07:49:37,130
He is a great devotee of the God.

2271
07:49:37,240 --> 07:49:38,264
My children please free him.

2272
07:49:39,976 --> 07:49:41,000
Mother's wish!

2273
07:49:42,846 --> 07:49:44,837
Come on, brother, we will
go and see that horse.

2274
07:49:44,948 --> 07:49:45,972
Come on!

2275
07:49:47,083 --> 07:49:49,608
Hanuman, though you
are so valorous...

2276
07:49:49,719 --> 07:49:52,187
...how did you get tied
up by these children?

2277
07:49:52,722 --> 07:49:55,816
Mother, my Lord's two
sons are also my Lord.

2278
07:49:56,259 --> 07:49:58,625
I saw you and when I saw
the children's face...

2279
07:49:58,728 --> 07:50:00,719
...I immediately recognized them.

2280
07:50:01,197 --> 07:50:02,789
That's it! I felt like
playing with them.

2281
07:50:03,800 --> 07:50:07,759
The king of Raghukul... Lord Ram!
- Hail to him!

2282
07:50:08,404 --> 07:50:09,769
Will there be a fight between
the father and the sons?

2283
07:50:10,173 --> 07:50:12,266
No! I will not let that happen.

2284
07:50:13,810 --> 07:50:14,868
Wait there!

2285
07:50:16,279 --> 07:50:19,214
Children, leave the venerated horse!

2286
07:50:19,415 --> 07:50:21,713
First remove that golden
saddle that is on him.

2287
07:50:22,085 --> 07:50:23,643
Then you can take away your horse.

2288
07:50:23,887 --> 07:50:26,185
This is an insult to
any brave warrior.

2289
07:50:26,356 --> 07:50:27,721
This is a challenge to fight.

2290
07:50:29,125 --> 07:50:32,720
Amazing! You look like
son's of a sage.

2291
07:50:33,363 --> 07:50:35,194
But you talk like warriors.

2292
07:50:36,766 --> 07:50:37,960
What is your father's name?

2293
07:50:38,434 --> 07:50:41,665
We have caught
the horse not our father.

2294
07:50:41,805 --> 07:50:45,070
Do not try to pacify us thinking
that we are children.

2295
07:50:45,275 --> 07:50:47,300
If you are a brave warrior
then pick up your weapon!

2296
07:50:47,710 --> 07:50:52,704
No! Dear Luv and Kush, this
war cannot take place.

2297
07:50:53,783 --> 07:50:55,011
He is your father.

2298
07:50:59,289 --> 07:51:00,313
Our father?

2299
07:51:01,324 --> 07:51:02,348
King Ram!

2300
07:51:02,725 --> 07:51:04,693
Yes, my children!
- Mother!

2301
07:51:05,829 --> 07:51:07,228
King Ram is our father?

2302
07:51:07,931 --> 07:51:09,865
Yes, Luv!
- So you are Sita?

2303
07:51:10,733 --> 07:51:14,294
Yes! The Lord of this
unfortunate one.

2304
07:51:15,438 --> 07:51:19,431
The son of the Arya's!
He is my husband.

2305
07:51:21,244 --> 07:51:25,237
My sons, from today he
is everything to you.

2306
07:51:26,015 --> 07:51:28,848
I hand over you to him.

2307
07:51:29,752 --> 07:51:31,879
Go! Go and greet your father.

2308
07:51:33,723 --> 07:51:35,884
Go my children; go and
take his blessings.

2309
07:51:39,395 --> 07:51:41,192
Our greetings to our father.

2310
07:51:41,831 --> 07:51:44,197
Come! Come, my dear children.

2311
07:51:47,103 --> 07:51:48,127
Sita, listen to me.

2312
07:51:49,305 --> 07:51:51,671
Oh Mother! Oh mother,
Please appear...

2313
07:51:51,774 --> 07:51:56,404
...to prove my
virtuousness and my purity.

2314
07:51:57,113 --> 07:51:59,206
Oh Mother, please hide this
daughter in your holy veil.

2315
07:52:00,016 --> 07:52:02,211
Mother, please give me
a place in your lap.

2316
07:52:06,189 --> 07:52:07,713
Mother!
- Come, my daughter!

2317
07:52:13,863 --> 07:52:16,764
Sita!
- Mother!

2318
07:52:17,400 --> 07:52:19,027
- Mother! Sita!
- Mother!

2319
07:52:19,135 --> 07:52:20,762
Sita!
- Mother! - Sita! - Mother!

2320
07:52:20,870 --> 07:52:21,928
Sita!
- Mother!

2321
07:52:22,138 --> 07:52:23,162
Sita!
- Mother!

2322
07:52:23,273 --> 07:52:25,173
Sita!
- Mother!

2323
07:52:26,142 --> 07:52:29,134
The Ganges... the daughter
of Mother earth.

2324
07:52:30,380 --> 07:52:32,143
You immersed in the earth.

2325
07:52:33,182 --> 07:52:36,640
Bholenath, by Sita getting
immersed in the earth...

2326
07:52:36,753 --> 07:52:40,655
...it is proved that the truth
and this world is dependent...

2327
07:52:40,757 --> 07:52:41,781
...on sacrifice.

2328
07:52:42,358 --> 07:52:45,384
A man's success is dependent
on a lady's sacrifice.

2329
07:52:45,929 --> 07:52:48,659
Goddess that is why a woman is
accepted as Shakti.

2330
07:52:49,899 --> 07:52:52,129
Sita was Ram's strength!

2331
07:52:53,169 --> 07:52:57,902
Without his strength today Ram
too has become helpless.

2332
07:52:59,042 --> 07:53:01,670
In his fury he sentenced
a death punishment...

2333
07:53:01,778 --> 07:53:03,405
...to his beloved Laxman

2334
07:53:04,314 --> 07:53:07,078
The Sheshnag went in
to the Netherland.

2335
07:53:09,185 --> 07:53:11,676
Being sorrowful himself, Lord
Ram broke all bondage...

2336
07:53:11,788 --> 07:53:14,689
...from his throne, his subjects,
his life and all the materialistic...

2337
07:53:14,791 --> 07:53:17,225
...pleasures of the world and
is now returning.

2338
07:53:18,227 --> 07:53:19,694
Lord Ram has finished the
task he was allotted...

2339
07:53:19,796 --> 07:53:20,922
...in his incarnation.

2340
07:53:21,998 --> 07:53:24,398
Lord Ram is now returning!

2341
07:53:24,968 --> 07:53:26,435
No!

2342
07:53:29,005 --> 07:53:31,235
My Lord, can never desert me and go.

2343
07:53:31,808 --> 07:53:34,038
Jankidas cannot make me an orphan.

2344
07:53:34,310 --> 07:53:35,641
But Bajrangbali, like the Ramban...

2345
07:53:35,745 --> 07:53:39,806
...Ram's oath and his
decision is rigid.

2346
07:53:40,183 --> 07:53:42,651
Lord Ram cannot wait now.

2347
07:53:42,752 --> 07:53:46,711
My child, no one is protected
all his life.

2348
07:53:47,090 --> 07:53:51,652
Mother, for me this world
is worthless without Ram.

2349
07:53:52,161 --> 07:53:53,355
I will stop my Lord.

2350
07:53:53,896 --> 07:53:55,727
I will plead to him! I
will fall at his feet.

2351
07:53:56,232 --> 07:53:58,291
My Lord! Lord Ram!

2352
07:53:58,701 --> 07:53:59,725
Maruti!

2353
07:54:00,803 --> 07:54:02,896
Devarishi, what bad
news you gave me.

2354
07:54:03,373 --> 07:54:05,136
My life is leaving me.

2355
07:54:05,441 --> 07:54:06,874
I am losing my power.

2356
07:54:07,410 --> 07:54:09,401
My Lord! Lord Ram!

2357
07:54:09,846 --> 07:54:10,870
Maruti!

2358
07:54:11,047 --> 07:54:14,414
Hail Lord Ram!

2359
07:54:14,517 --> 07:54:18,009
Hail Lord Ram!

2360
07:54:18,121 --> 07:54:21,386
Hail Lord Ram!

2361
07:54:21,491 --> 07:54:24,983
Hail Lord Ram!

2362
07:54:25,094 --> 07:54:29,053
Lord Ram!
- Hail to him!

2363
07:54:30,733 --> 07:54:32,064
The great Guru Vashishth!

2364
07:54:33,336 --> 07:54:35,031
All my people from Ayodhya!

2365
07:54:36,372 --> 07:54:41,639
Till today all of you have given
immense love, affection...

2366
07:54:41,744 --> 07:54:44,372
...and faith to your Ram.

2367
07:54:45,415 --> 07:54:46,712
Ram is obligated to you.

2368
07:54:48,217 --> 07:54:53,655
Ram asks for forgiveness
if he has knowingly or...

2369
07:54:53,756 --> 07:54:55,656
...unknowingly committed any mistake.

2370
07:54:56,692 --> 07:55:01,288
Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!

2371
07:55:07,870 --> 07:55:09,667
Ram!
- Ram!

2372
07:55:09,772 --> 07:55:11,262
Ram!
- Ram!

2373
07:55:11,374 --> 07:55:15,037
My Lord! My Lord! - Ram!
- Ram!

2374
07:55:15,311 --> 07:55:19,213
My Lord! Ocean of mercy!
An ocean of kindness!

2375
07:55:19,715 --> 07:55:25,119
My God! God, there can never
be morning without the sun.

2376
07:55:26,055 --> 07:55:28,148
There can never be night
without the moon.

2377
07:55:29,025 --> 07:55:30,993
There can never be any melody
without... any instruments.

2378
07:55:31,994 --> 07:55:33,222
Without air there is no life.

2379
07:55:33,930 --> 07:55:36,023
And without life there
can never be any body.

2380
07:55:37,100 --> 07:55:40,900
How can the servant survive
without his Lord?

2381
07:55:45,408 --> 07:55:48,639
Brother Hanuman! The
sun and the moon...

2382
07:55:48,744 --> 07:55:52,874
...give light to the earth
from the exterior.

2383
07:55:54,150 --> 07:55:58,644
A devotee, a saint and a great
sage illuminate a person...

2384
07:55:58,754 --> 07:56:00,153
...from within.

2385
07:56:01,357 --> 07:56:03,655
Immortal devotees like you
and the great sages...

2386
07:56:03,759 --> 07:56:07,251
...only can do away with the
darkness of the world.

2387
07:56:08,164 --> 07:56:09,188
Yes!

2388
07:56:09,298 --> 07:56:11,664
But you are my light.

2389
07:56:12,034 --> 07:56:14,662
My Lord, what can I do with
this lifeless body...

2390
07:56:14,770 --> 07:56:16,294
...without my Lord?

2391
07:56:17,006 --> 07:56:18,268
Take me along with you.

2392
07:56:20,243 --> 07:56:22,677
Bajrangi, while making the bridge
you wrote Ram's name...

2393
07:56:22,778 --> 07:56:25,008
...on all the stones and made
them float on the water.

2394
07:56:26,249 --> 07:56:28,274
You saved Shakuni from the Ramban.

2395
07:56:30,019 --> 07:56:35,616
You only have proved that Ram's
name is greater than Ram.

2396
07:56:35,992 --> 07:56:37,619
The body is perishable.

2397
07:56:38,661 --> 07:56:42,062
But by soul we both
are always together.

2398
07:56:42,932 --> 07:56:47,369
You are within Ram! And
Ram is within you.

2399
07:56:49,405 --> 07:56:55,241
But ocean of mercy, how will
I carry out my services to you.

2400
07:56:57,013 --> 07:56:58,640
You have many times done
away with the problems...

2401
07:56:58,748 --> 07:57:00,340
...that Ram faced.

2402
07:57:02,051 --> 07:57:03,313
You are the saviour
from all problems.

2403
07:57:05,221 --> 07:57:09,658
To serve Ram is to live in this
world and help people...

2404
07:57:09,759 --> 07:57:12,091
...to do away with their problems.

2405
07:57:13,863 --> 07:57:14,887
It is my boon!

2406
07:57:16,032 --> 07:57:20,992
Wherever Ram's saga is sung
you will definitely be there.

2407
07:57:21,837 --> 07:57:22,861
You will be definitely present.

2408
07:57:28,311 --> 07:57:35,911
"Ram is leaving for his abode. "

2409
07:57:37,253 --> 07:57:42,714
"The entire Avadh is sorrowful. "

2410
07:57:44,193 --> 07:57:50,996
Hari's magical play only He knows. "

2411
07:57:52,101 --> 07:57:57,801
"What does this innocent
world know?"

2412
07:58:00,009 --> 07:58:08,644
"Today in heaven all the Gods
have opened the gates...

2413
07:58:08,751 --> 07:58:13,188
...to greet the Lord. "

2414
07:58:14,991 --> 07:58:23,660
"The Lord left back his incarnation...

2415
07:58:23,766 --> 07:58:27,930
...on the earth. "

2416
07:58:33,376 --> 07:58:36,607
You Goddess's, you have seen on
the earth that the devotee...

2417
07:58:36,712 --> 07:58:38,907
...is always anxious
to see their Lord.

2418
07:58:39,749 --> 07:58:40,943
Today you see him in Heaven.

2419
07:58:42,718 --> 07:58:44,743
How the Lord is anxious
to meet His devotee.

2420
07:58:45,354 --> 07:58:48,016
Wonder what might be God's
magical play in this?

2421
07:58:48,124 --> 07:58:49,785
This is not a magical play
but this is the truth.

2422
07:58:50,126 --> 07:58:51,616
There was never and will never be...

2423
07:58:51,727 --> 07:58:54,287
...an immortal devotee
like Bajrangbali.

2424
07:58:54,930 --> 07:58:56,693
This is Bholenath's mercy.

2425
07:58:57,300 --> 07:58:59,632
Yes! If Mahadev would
not have blessed...

2426
07:58:59,735 --> 07:59:00,997
...the son of Anjani.

2427
07:59:01,971 --> 07:59:03,768
Then Bajrangbali would
not have been born.

2428
07:59:04,874 --> 07:59:07,240
Then who would have sloved
Ram and Sita's problems?

2429
07:59:07,943 --> 07:59:09,706
Then God knows what would be
the saga of Ram and Sita?

2430
07:59:10,913 --> 07:59:14,940
Really, Bajrangbali is
the life of Ram's saga!

2431
07:59:20,756 --> 07:59:25,716
"O' Maruti!
- O' Maruti!"

2432
07:59:25,828 --> 07:59:30,891
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

2433
07:59:31,000 --> 07:59:36,165
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

2434
07:59:36,272 --> 07:59:38,604
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2435
07:59:38,708 --> 07:59:41,108
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2436
07:59:41,210 --> 07:59:43,804
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2437
07:59:43,913 --> 07:59:47,007
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2438
07:59:47,116 --> 07:59:50,108
"You are an extra ordinary valorous
one of this earth. "

2439
07:59:50,219 --> 07:59:52,346
"You are brave, yes, you are brave!"

2440
07:59:52,455 --> 07:59:55,151
"You are the lightening
but you are serious. "

2441
07:59:55,257 --> 07:59:57,817
"You are serious! You are serious!"

2442
07:59:57,927 --> 08:00:02,955
"We think that you are a precious... "

2443
08:00:03,065 --> 08:00:08,765
"We think you are a precious
arrow of Lord Ram!"

2444
08:00:08,871 --> 08:00:10,964
"You are a precious arrow. "

2445
08:00:11,073 --> 08:00:16,101
"There is always of the Treta Era... "

2446
08:00:16,212 --> 08:00:19,648
"There is always an incarnation
of the Treta Era...

2447
08:00:19,749 --> 08:00:21,649
...in your eyes. "

2448
08:00:21,751 --> 08:00:28,054
"O' Maruti!
- O' Maruti!"

2449
08:00:28,157 --> 08:00:33,254
"O' Maruti, the essence of Ram's
tale is in your eyes. "

2450
08:00:33,362 --> 08:00:35,660
"Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2451
08:00:35,765 --> 08:00:38,029
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2452
08:00:38,200 --> 08:00:40,725
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"

2453
08:00:40,870 --> 08:00:44,203
"Hail! Hail! Hail Bajrangbali!"
