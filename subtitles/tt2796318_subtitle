1
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,166
'This is not a fairness
cream add. It's my life.'

2
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:42,579
'I don't know how but didn't
realize when my life got messed up.'

3
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,003
Sir, this is Andrew Webber.

4
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,200
From US.

5
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,641
Murdered on the 26th.

6
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,504
Jimmy Tarkof.

7
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,840
From Ukraine.

8
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,548
Murdered on the 18th.

9
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,885
Both of them, were killed..

10
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,452
..within 10 days of
their arrival in Delhi.

11
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,782
By pricking of a needle..

12
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,187
"that was dabbed
with a lethal dose of..

13
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,352
..Radio Nucleotide Cyanide.

14
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,790
Sir, both of them were
murdered in a crowded area..

15
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,522
..and we couldn't find
any clue or evidence.

16
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,836
No fingerprints or DNA traces either.

17
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,830
The only thing we did find
from their fake credit cards"

18
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,209
"that, these two were hackers.

19
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,912
And, they were no ordinary hackers.

20
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,139
They were the
undisputed king of their domain.

21
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,312
But, sir... for hacking,
you don't need to..

22
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,477
..even step out of your bed.

23
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,988
So, what brought these two to Delhi?

24
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,755
One thing's sure.

25
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,924
Something big is
going to happen in Delhi.

26
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,656
They didn't come here to
steal loose change from the ATMs.

27
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,696
So...it's a cyber-cell case.

28
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,971
Why don't you seek their help?

29
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,172
Sir, I've been working with them..

30
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,243
...for the past few days.

31
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,479
They couldn't even
find their real names.

32
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,740
It's along shot, sir.

33
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,381
So, what's the option?

34
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,812
Sir, I need a hacker
that thinks like them.

35
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,246
Operates like them.

36
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,823
Someone who knows in and
out of the cyber-world.

37
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,860
Cunning and smart, just like them.

38
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,593
And...l need your
written permission to hire him.

39
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,407
Apple. Orange. Strawberry. Blackberry.

40
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,904
"Love's made in China."

41
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,883
Software. Software. Software.

42
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,612
"Love's made in China."

43
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,454
"Love's made in China."

44
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,549
"Love's made in China."

45
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,320
This is made in China. Great.

46
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,488
The M's missing.

47
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,963
Here you go. W's also like M.

48
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,761
"ll o warrantee.."

49
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:28,669
"N 0 Bill either.."

50
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,306
"Io guarantee.."

51
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,140
"ll o warrantee.."

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,012
"N 0 Bill either.."

53
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,014
"Love's made in China."

54
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,917
"Love's made in China."

55
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,822
"Love's made in China."

56
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,292
"Love's made in China."

57
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,204
"Love's made in China."

58
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,974
"Love's made in China."

59
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:22,390
"Here comes the container."

60
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:30,165
"Delivered straight from China."

61
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,534
"It could last forever."

62
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,572
"Or maybe just until dusk."

63
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,470
"The tension won't let you sleep."

64
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,476
"It'll wreak havoc."

65
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,340
"It could last forever."

66
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,472
"Or maybe just until dusk."
- Io kidding!

67
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,140
"The tension won't let you sleep."

68
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,047
"It'll wreak havoc."

69
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,316
"In this era, guarantee's
the last thing to expect."

70
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,481
"Listen carefully.."

71
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,082
"Love's made in China."

72
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,315
We've been granted permission"

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,918
"but, where are we
going to find a guy..

74
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,553
..with all these qualities?

75
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,299
A year ago, there was
a news about a hacker..

76
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,029
..who stole 10 Rs from
hundreds of accounts.

77
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,704
And people realized the
fraud only after three months.

78
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,605
And anyway, no one's going
to burn precious petrol"

79
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,641
..to lodge a
complaint about 10 Rs theft.

80
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,877
What was the name of that hacker?

81
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,306
Kung-Fu Chameli!

82
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,706
I see. Oh yes, sir.

83
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,715
The theft was so small,

84
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,113
we also didn't take
any interest in it.

85
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,981
I mean... it wasn't
worth the effort, so..

86
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,956
I want that small-time
crook Kung-fu Chameli.

87
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,537
Don't you have any shame?

88
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,374
Why will I crash your
college server for you?

89
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,744
ls the money ready?

90
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,515
I've just 2000, but please
help us out, bro... sis"

91
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,987
Who are you calling Sis?

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,057
Keep the money ready,
I'll do your job.

93
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,262
Despomjust because you
can't find a real girl..

94
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,166
..you're settling for her.

95
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,704
The things one has
to do to earn money!

96
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,097
You won't get it.

97
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,368
For now, let me hack
their college server.

98
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,673
This is not a girl's job.

99
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,539
Check out my moves, dude.

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,674
0h...flaunting in English.

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,644
Did you drop your
cousin at the airport?

102
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,247
Here you go.

103
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,790
I'm forwarding you the link.

104
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,789
low, try delaying the results
without crashing their server.

105
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,386
Do it.
- So, take this.

106
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,859
Do it. Come on, do it.

107
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,811
Oh! Shucks!

108
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,581
I'm in for a beating today.

109
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,075
Hello.

110
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,944
Yes, mom.

111
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,515
I'm writing my exams,
I'll call to you later.

112
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,554
You're such a liar.

113
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,089
Let me tell her the truth.
- Stop that.

114
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,856
Nothing, the examiner's staring at me.

115
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,390
He'll definitely crush my b""*.

116
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,622
I'll call you later.

117
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,856
Useless.

118
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,058
Doesn't make a difference.
- Come on.

119
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,502
Sir, the system of our
country is really strange.

120
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,630
There's a board in
every lane and alley.

121
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,706
"Hacker lot Allowed."

122
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,969
"Hacker lot Allowed."

123
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,303
Yet, we're looking for one.

124
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,274
That's not 'Hacker', that's "Hawker".

125
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,850
"H aw-Ker. H aw.."

126
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,022
Who are we looking for, sir?

127
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,485
<i>“Rae-ken “a-cker.“</i>

128
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,025
Hacker? I can't even
connect to the internet.

129
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,188
It keeps buffering all day.

130
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,631
They're just hackers, not hotshots.

131
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,462
You can find those
lowlifes at Nehru place.

132
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,400
You can find all of
them at Nehru place.

133
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,028
They just hang around all day.

134
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,936
Good-for-nothing.

135
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,475
We need electricity first.

136
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,340
Then we'll look for the hacker.

137
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,652
Sir...sir, you?

138
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,352
Stop mumbling!

139
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,356
I want a sharp-witted hacker.

140
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,793
You're at the right place, sir.

141
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,588
This is where Hackers are born..

142
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,326
..and also get together.

143
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,425
Sir, consider your search's over.

144
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,499
You'll find hackers of
every size and shape.

145
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,469
This market on the first
Tuesday of every month.

146
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,704
Hackers. Shackers.
Hardware, software. Porn..

147
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,108
You can get anything you like.

148
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,908
Sir...if hackers could fly..

149
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,046
"then, this would be their airport.

150
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,416
So, take a look.

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,619
Sir, look at that guy.

152
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,025
It's a simple system.

153
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:57,565
But it can jam all internet
connections...in a second.

154
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,326
He's called the Professor.

155
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,931
'Prof'.

156
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,398
The 'Papaji' (Father) of Hackers.

157
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,533
1...3...and..

158
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,510
Oops.
- Sir, he'll be perfect.

159
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,739
Shall I talk to him?

160
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,743
I need an ingenious youngster.

161
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,447
Like the 'Sehwag' of Hacking world.

162
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,820
'Sehwag' (Champion).

163
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,999
Hey, fools.

164
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,435
That's 'Floppy'.

165
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,839
Original name, Manjot Gill.

166
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,911
Look at my new innovation.

167
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,881
The Profiler. Alias, 'Khol De Pol'.

168
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,575
Sir, his list of escapades"

169
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,843
"are longer than the arms of the law.

170
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,884
It can tell you everything,
in just three minutes.

171
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,188
So the challenge is, either
you hack it in three minutes.

172
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,193
Or, he'll expose you
publicly in three minutes.

173
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,891
Anyone up for the challenge?

174
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,930
That's Palvinder. 'Pancho..'

175
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,802
That's his name.

176
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,204
His audio doesn't work.

177
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,471
Doesn't speak much.

178
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,247
He's more complex
than his brawny looks.

179
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,391
Come on. Give it a try.

180
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,995
Floppy the fool!

181
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,761
That's Chutney, alias Shalu Sharma.

182
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,205
She's a logistics expert.

183
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,376
Since she turned 16, she's
been doing everything...

184
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,673
"that's not allowed at 21 either.

185
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,318
Girl. This is no ordinary profiler.

186
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,986
The FBI and the CIA use it.

187
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,582
H ey!

188
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,259

Mickey the Virus.

194
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,689
Hold it.

195
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,927
Professor's laziest student.

196
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,061
He's one of those boys that
studies at the last moment.

197
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,171
He'll take up your job but,
never complete it.

198
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,306
He hates even the
mention of the word "Work".

199
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
Forget him. Look at Floppy sir.

200

Oh my! Did you make this?

201
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,997
It's a super-system.

202
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,190
You're a genius.

203
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,801
Floppy! You're my best friend.

204
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,197
Thank you, bro.

205

Call him.

Don't tell him about us?
- Yes.

00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,697
Sir, why won't he tell him about us?

212
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,577
He might get scared
realising that we're the Police.

213
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,639

This not a question, it's an order.

243
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,812
Will you come along quietly"

244
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,786

You see...l don't work
'with' or 'for' anyone.

249

It's my rule.

250
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,496
Think about it.

251
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,302
Give it a thought.

252
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,336
Like you guys 93V-

253
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,203

Sir, at least half a dozen
have tried since morning.

258
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,255
They're all useless.

259

Here he is. Welcome.

260
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,125
So, what's the outcome?

261
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,826
Tracking hackers was quite tricky sir.

262
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,003
I tried to track the
trailes of both the dead hackers.

263
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,330
But, couldn't find a clue about"

..why they came to Delhi?
Who called them?

265

Sir, I suggest"
- Io, no. Don't suggest anything.

267

Get going. I can guess
the rest from your face.

00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,780
In all you failed to score, right.

269
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,119
Come on, get going.

Sir, they can't even find their way.

Sir, it's not their cup of tea.

00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,163
They can't even hold their pants up.

276
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,724
Their pants keep slipping down..

277
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,789
"and, their
undenlvear keeps coming out!

We sell by the kilo.
- So, what?

It's the wedding season.

00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,688
Sweetmeats are the
delicacy of the season.

It's too expensive. That's not done.

309
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,135
You're selling it at a high rate.

310
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,296
You can't sell
something worth 10, for 50.

311
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,634
It's too expensive.

312

are you just looking around.

She's vanished!

Chutney. Please. Gimme one
pickup line to impress her.

I was trying to send you the line,
but it isn't going through.

356
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,931
Your system had to buffer now, right.

357
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,702
It was such a disastrous pickup line.

358
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,204
Madam, your card.

359
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,101
Kung-fu Chameli!

360
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,146
I will return her this card.
- Here. Take this along.

361
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,703
Read the line from this.

362
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,375
Thank you.

363
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,076
Wait, wait, wait.

364
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,913
You forgot your card.

365
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,425
Fate brought you to me Miss.

366
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,427
Fate brought you to me Miss.

367
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,726
Mutual funds are
subject to market risk.

368
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,861
My card?

369
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,733
I see. So your fate
brought us together.

370
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,937
So, if you're lucky, we'll meet again.

371
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,562
I am on my way.

372
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,266
Your Vegetable has
made my mind a vegetable!

373
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,611
Couldn't you give me a better line?

374
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,514
First you ask for help
and later crib about it.

375
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,750
But Floppy-

376
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,224
She was just amazing.

377
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,161
From the moment I saw her,
everything went into slow-motion.

378
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,546
What's happening?

379
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,045
Turn on the subtitles,
I can't hear a thing.

380
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,554
I'm getting that
'falling-in-love' type feeling.

381
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,991
He's dying in love.

382
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,102
Do you have a plan to find her?

383
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,662
To hell with the plan.

384
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,934
But, there must be a way to find her.

385
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,913
You don't know her name, her address,
or her phone number.

386
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,913
How are you going to find her? Stupid.

387
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,115
The professor always says,
if you're stuck"

388
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,746
..then hit rewind, and
review the events again.

389
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,652
You will find the solution in there.

390
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,860
'Madam, your card.'

391
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,754
'Wait, wait, wait.'

392
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,923
'You forgot your card.'

393
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,936
Palwinder. Your
audio's got super speakers!

394
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,150
Find anything?

395
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,828
Everything.

396
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,938
She's Kamayani.

397
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,474
Kung-fu Chameli.

398
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,111
Your gal's a real hottie.

399
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,616
Why do nerds always end
up with the best girls?

400
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,024
Fate did bring us
back together, Kammi!

401
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,121
My future childrens Mummy!!

402
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,863
Floppy, you know.

403
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,695
Your 'Profiler' was really good.

404
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,837
I just uploaded the latest antivirus.

405
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,843
Then why did you screw it up. Dog!

406
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,777
Did you forget the
Professor's first rule?

407
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,939
'No matter how good a
hardware you build.'

408
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:50,316
'If your software's weak, your
system will definitely crash.'

409
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,747
‘Elementaryf

410
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,346
You remember all the
Professor's rules.

411
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,482
But, everything he hands you a
job you disappear in thin air.

412
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,418
You two are the
Professor's ass lickers.

413
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,586
Why do you need me?

414
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,685
And anyway, I'm not like
the universal charger"

415
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,856
"that, you can plug me in anywhere.

416
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,027
Since you've fell for
that Kung-fu chick..

417
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,001
"Even your thoughts
have become triple X.

418
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,503
Kung-fu chick

419
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,699
You find this lame joke funny, is it!
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?

420
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,601
Hello.

421
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,070
Yes, Professor.

422
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,908
We're on our way.

423
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,407
Professor.

424
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,543
Come fast.
- Hey? Where to?

425
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,414
Sitting idle and doing
nothing is your job.

426
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,582
Come on.

427
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,825
SUVW. Where are you going?

428
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,984
Sit down.

429
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,393
Before you pin this bill
on me, I'm running away.

430
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,924
I've such useless friends.

431
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,835
'Our fates have been written
with the donkey's bottom.'

432
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,669
'But I had to see this time.'

433
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:46,607
'Whether fate's with me,
or with the police.'

434
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,667
Here you go.

435
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,475
Why don't you open a account for me?

436
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,174
Onions are getting expensive.

437
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,615
So, using cauliflower instead.

438
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,746
ls your brother okay, now?

439
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,255
Mickey. Enough fooling around.

440
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,661
You've a meeting
with the ACP. Let's go.

441
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,892
What meeting?

442
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,226
We gave you two days to think?

443
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:17,000
But you sent no message.

444
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,432
You made a run for it.

445
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,533
Come on. I've bought a bottle
of oil along to rub it on you.

446
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,441
low, we'll take you
for a spin...in our style.

447
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,104
Come on.
- Can I finish the noodles?

448
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,375
Get it packed.

449
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,117
Mom.

450
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,685
I'm going on a field trip. Yeah.

451
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,888
I'll be back by evening.

452
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,134
Well...it could even take a day or two.

453
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,838
Where will I get the gourd?

454
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,773
I don't want any sweetmeat.

455
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,639
Hello. I can't hear you. Hello...

456
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,908
I like sweetmeats"

457
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,881
There's a saying in
our Police station.

458
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,678
When a big vegetable is out

459
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,049
Everyone gets a piece of it

460
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,251
Right.

461
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,721
Sir, here's your Virus!

462
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,924
Stand straight.
- I knew it.

463
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,825
I knew it.

464
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,035
I knew it, Mickey Arora.

465
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,002
You're behind this mischief.

466
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,600
You destructor.

467
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,539
'All of you are
good-for-nothing slackers.'

468
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,975
'When you rack your
brains at dial-up speed..'

469
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,982
'..then, no need to
bigmouth like broadband.'

470
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:39,449
'Instead of using dead
brain cells, just follow me.'

471
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,848
'You can't understand
such a small thing.'

472
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,522
-Why..'

473
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,032
'Hey Bull worker, what's so funny?'

474
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,400
'Mr. Arora.'

475
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,804
'I hired you make our process manual.'

476
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,709
'When are we going to
see something in print?'

477
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,748
"I recognise your.."
- 'Sir, very soon.'

478
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,546
'You spent half your
life saying that.'

479
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,775
'Hello.'

480
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,347
'Who Priyanka Chopra?'

481
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,791
'Do I sound like Priyanka Chopra?'

482
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,555
'This is Pinchoo
Banerjee speaking over here.'

483
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,857
'Keep the bloody phone.'

484
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,756
'Nonsense.'

485
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,130
'You..
- "l recognise.."

486
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,128
'Hello.'

487
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,094
'Who Priyanka Chopra?'

488
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,937
'Keep the phone down
you no-good... Please.'

489
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,845
'Mickey, I'm warning
you for the last time.'

490
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,713
"l recognise.."

491
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,645
The bloody heroine perverted fans"

492
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,017
..are not letting me sleep.

493
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,855
I had to change my mobile
number because of your antics.

494
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,186
I'll have you thrown behind bars.

495
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,756
I won't spare you, swine"

496
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,889
Bhalla..
- I'll get you arrested.

497
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,358
Take him some place to cool down.

498
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,697
Come with me, I'll
buy you an icicle-pop.

499
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,828
But no sugar in it! 0k!

500
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,135
I've diabetes.
- Come along.

501
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:12,008
Sid. There's an amazing
sale at Sarojini Hagar.

502
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,442
Let's talk on the way.

503
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,419
You said you never work
'for' or 'with' anyone.

504
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,988
So, it was a slip of tongue.

505
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,125
But I soon mended my mistake.

506
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,356
Sir.

507
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,091
It's finally on print, sir.

508
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,060
Pinchoo!!

509
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,444
Mickey!

510
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,815
Have you always been
making these photos of girls"

511
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,786
..or, did you just hit puberty?

512
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,081
This are just...

513
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,953
Extra-curricular activities.

514
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,361
This is a list of all your scams.

515
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,695
And your boss is keen on
lodging a complaint with us.

516
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,161
So, either you work
for me, or go to jail.

517
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,066
This?

518
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,436
This is rubbish.

519
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,042
Don't take me for a fool.

520
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,378
Try linking me to any of these,
and I'll bow to you.

521
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,479
Have you heard that saying"

522
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,884
Heads is mine and tail is mine

523
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,649
...and I own the coin

524
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,986
So here I own all the coins

525
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,489
I can make you run between..

526
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,725
"court and jail for all your life.

527
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,301
Don't get sentimental.

528
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,096
Just tell me the job.

529
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,967
I got this installed for you.

530
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,710
It's cool.

531
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,983
Have you heard about the 'Bhram gang'?

532
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,252
'Bhram gang'?

533
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,189
What sort of a name is that?

534
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,259
Which gangster is he?

535
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,124
They aren't gangster,
they are hackers.

536
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,396
Hacker gang? lop!

537
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,234
What system is this?
I can't even open it!

538
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,871
It's just a can with a lot of wires!

539
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,609
Sid, tell me one thing.

540
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,248
You could've taken the advice"

541
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,217
..of the one you buying this for?

542
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,053
If I work on this, I'll
never get the job done.

543
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,026
We'll have to upgrade it.

544
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,194
Okay. What do you want?

545
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,729
I've a solution to problems.

546
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,297
I know a guy.

547
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,739
He's an expert in
cheaply upgrading computers.

548
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,272
The biggest jinx of my life.

549
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,248
What made you call me?

550
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,318
I need you to upgrade a system.

551
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,113
Yes.

552
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,487
8gb Ram, Ting-Ting-Ting 1.7 processor.

553
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,856
<i>4GB graphic card and...'I.TB hard disk.</i>

554
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,691
This will cost you...70,000 Rs.

555
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,665
150,000? Are you crazy?

556
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,735
Always hogging the bigger share.

557
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,032
We won't pay you a
penny more than 125,000.

558
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,732
They are the Police.

559
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,405
Better do their job.

560
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,870
Make a healthy relation with them.

561
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,110
It'll come in handy some day!

562
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,412
Okay, add the 25,000..
- Okay. Sure.

563
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,645
Done, done.

564
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,554
Sir, I've done your job.
- Cheapskate.

565
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,355
Once Antoo does his job, I'll do mine.

566
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,921
Can I go now?

567
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,459
Mom was calling.

568
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,533
We'll meet again...in a week ortwo.

569
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,716
Sir. You let that boy go.

570
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,812
Surprising, sir.

571
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,116
He made the Bengali run for his life..

572
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,315
"saying that you're filing a case"

573
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,119
..of mental harassment against him.

574
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,254
What's this, sir?

575
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:41,376
"Do I stop...this moment?"

576
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,584
"Or do l...let myself go?"

577
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,416
"What do I do?"

578
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,185
"What do I do?"

579
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,264
"What do I do?"

580
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:02,202
"l can't think anything right now."

581
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,605
"l am in love."

582
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,435
"l am in love."

583
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,708
"l am in love."

584
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,213
"l am in love."

585
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:22,656
"Since I fell in love with you."

586
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:29,495
"Since I fell in love with you."

587
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:36,495
"It started a series of events."

588
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:43,711
"Since I fell in love with you."

589
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:49,548
"Since I fell in love with you."

590
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,483
People follow on Facebook and Twitter.

591
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,912
But my feet are tired
following you around.

592
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,891
"It started a series of events."

593
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,254
So you won't give up.
- Me.

594
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,890
It's destiny after all.

595
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,290
See, we meet again
because it was destiny.

596
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,097
By the way, how about
coffee after office?

597
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,864
Isn't that too fast?
- Io.

598
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,597
Ilot tonight, tomorrow.

599
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,867
So...coffee...coffee...

600
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,911
Just one.
- You're so stupid.

601
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,411
"Sweetheart."

602
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,915
"I've lost my senses."

603
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,316
"I've lost mymheart."

604
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,822
"You dwell in my heartbeats."

605
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,319
"Sweetheart."

606
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:38,564
"l am in love."

607
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:45,040
"l am in love."

608
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,123
"l found you after losing myself."

609
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:09,222
"That's how I learned to live."

610
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,966
"l found you after losing myself."

611
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:22,774
"That's how I learned to live."

612
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:27,071
"l forsook everything for your love."

613
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:32,780
"That's how I learned to live."

614
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:39,652
"Your smile's...my happiness."

615
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,488
"My happiness is only with you."

616
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:50,399
"Since I fell in love with you."

617
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:57,112
"Since I fell in love with you."

618
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:04,217
"It started a series of events."

619
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:10,920
"Since I fell in love with you."

620
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:17,461
"Since I fell in love with you."

621
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,567
Mickey's missing again?

622
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,430
What, sir?
- Mickey!

623
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,173
He's disappeared, sir.

624
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,607
ls Mickey's supplier here yet,
to upgrade the machine?

625
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,343
He's out of town, sir.

626
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,072
Visiting the temple.

627
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,114
Goddess mother, bless us all.

628
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,278
He'll do it once he's back.

629
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,690
Sir, I'm curious to know.

630
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,988
What kind of a case are
we working on exactly?

631
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:21,291
Io identification, no investigation.
It's been so long..

632
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,659
"since we last tortured
someone in the station.

633
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,563
We're taking help of
a crook to catch one.

634
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,660
And, sir. Assign the
boy Mickey under me.

635
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,534
I'll set him straight with a stick.

636
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,698
I don't think Mickey can
be handled with a stick"

637
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,813
Might doesn't work everything, Bhalla.

638
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,816
Sometimes we need to be more
fluid like water to find a way.

639
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,917
Didn't like what I said.

640
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,851
Io, sir. Just... didn't
understand what you just said.

641
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,667
You?

642
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,235
At this hour?

643
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,737
I've got a gift for you.

644
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,176
A gift for me...stolen
from my own building.

645
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,080
Don't stolen gifts have sentiments?

646
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,316
Try to understand the feelings.

647
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,850
But, we're friends. 0k?

648
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,322
People only give a flower.

649
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,290
I gave you the entire pot.

650
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,624
And you say we're friends.

651
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,932
Fine. I've to get to my office now.

652
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,328
Go.

653
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,716
I proposed to her.

654
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:58,659
Watch it you bloody..
- Rascal. Stop flaunting your English.

655
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,320
Good for nothing,
I'll thrash you black

656
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,829
and blue and throw you out of Delhi.

657
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,397
And you, are you crazy?

658
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,396
Don't lust for a girl you don't know.

659
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,164
Just see it from my point of view.

660
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,163
And you'll definitely blow a fuse.
- I see.

661
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,433
No wonder I didn't
see you for so long.

662
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,645
So, why don't you tell her,
that you're a crook-hacker?

663
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,006
Chutney, it's time I
turned back from Mickey Virus..

664
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,812
..to Mickey Arora again.

665
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,081
But, how are you
going to mend your ways?

666
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,646
By joining the police.

667
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,020
I even have an offer.

668
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,720
Now Police is hiring
crooks in their department?

669
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,262
Then this country
definitely needs improvement!

670
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,031
There are cops ahead.

671
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,122
Shall I race ahead?
- Io.

672
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,395
Chutney, no. no. Io, chutney.

673
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,996
So, what exactly do you do?
- I..

674
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,703
'Mom, I am at the shop. Yes.'

675
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,907
I handle my family business,
part-time.

676
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,280
'That dog even sold the
Qutub Minar over the internet.'

677
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,510
'I'm not on the computer.
Who told you that?'

678
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,112
'He's a big thief. He can even
steal from the flea-market.'

679
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,314
'Bloody silly-con.'

680
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,982
'Who can dare steal anything
in front of me from this shop!'

681
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,856
'..when I am here.
You're just too much.'

682
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,490
'He can even infect a
typewriter with a virus!'

683
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,861
I sweep computers.

684
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:10,955
Hello, Mr. Shin Chan.

685
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,659
Yes, your virus is ready.

686
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,928
Yes, your virus is ready.

687
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,933
Very fast! Mr. Arora. Very fast!

688
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,131
You should be in China.

689
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,571
He's a champion of computers.

690
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,037
But I'll make mincemeat out of
him if he faces me directly.

691
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,907
Mickey, you..

692
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,472
Which ones?

693
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,476
'Dal-chini Virus'.

694
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,077
'Piles Virus'.

695
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,376
'Snacks Virus'.

696
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,782
And 'Bulldog virus.'

697
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,814
Andmlndian sweet virus.'

698
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,686
Look at what he's done to me.

699
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,355
lam on the roads.

700
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:43,929
I also freemlance... ing.
- Basically you are good for nothing!

701
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,730
Hey! Being useless is a big job.

702
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,098
Don't misunderstand.

703
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,363
I can read bodies, and minds too.

704
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,206
They call me Bond in my colony.

705
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,770
0k, Malviya llagar's Mr. James Bond..

706
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,342
..do you read body language?

707
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,350
Body...and language as well.
I'm like a magician.

708
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:11,455
Okay, jhalle. Then tell
me what I am thinking.

709
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,660
Every time I look at you..

710
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,358
"the parental control
of my mind's switched-off.

711
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,861
And my system crashes.

712
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,709
Don't look at that good-for-nothing.

713
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,006
He's just sitting there
with those headphones"

714
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,205
..on his ears listening
to cricket commentary.

715
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,781
Hold on. Hey! What's the score?
- Mickey.

716
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,818
You always know what's going around.

717
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,786
It's been a month since we met.

718
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,684
And according to that,
today is our anniversary.

719
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,453
Did you remember?

720
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,390
What kind of an anniversary
falls in a month old relationship?

721
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,904
The eggs in my fridge
are older than that.

722
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,206
You will always remain ajhalla.

723
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,873
Listen"

724
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,405
If you've paid the bill,
at least take the change!

725
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,847
Listen to me.

726
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,351
Listen to me at least!

727
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,116
You call yourself a magician,
don't you?

728
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,379
A magician can make an
elephant disappear"

729
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,948
..in front of thousands of people.

730
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:21,089
The things he shows us are not real.

731
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,929
Can you repeat your words?

732
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,131
Couldn't understand a word.

733
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,773
Hello.

734
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,009
Turn around.

735
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,453
Hi, Sid.
- Siddhant.

736
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,055
Let's sit inside.

737
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,862
Your guy has upgraded the system.

738
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,733
And, with one slap he took his
share without your commission.

739
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:05,933
Commission?

740
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,641
Sid, you can never trust such guys.

741
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,645
Can you see something written?

742
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,012
You're my brother after all.

743
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,213
Fine.

744
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:20,988
What's the job?

745
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:23,550
Laptop-

746
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,453
Careful.

747
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,925
I've raised this machine
with a lot of hard work.

748
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,527
Surprising, isn't it?

749
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,529
Imagine the chaos"

750
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,836
..you can cause with
this small tin can.

751
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,814
This is the Bhram Gang' site.

752
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,843
Study it,

753
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,855
It's quite a secure site.

754
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,957
Fine. I'll workout
something in a week.

755
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,497
We aren't going anywhere..

756
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,698
..until you don't crack this site.

757
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,639
Give me four days.

758
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,434
You're going to get me delayed.

759
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,292
Multi-layered firewall.

760
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,023
If I go any further, its
system will get activated.

761
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,259
And they will track the IP address"

762
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,800
..of this system in 60 seconds.

763
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,433
You mean, after pressing Enter"

764
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,339
..if you don't crack
this site in 60 seconds"

765
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,776
"then, these dangerous criminals"

766
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,643
..will come knocking at your door.

767
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,240
That's exactly what I said.

768
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,189
You've 60 seconds.
- Sid!

769
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,287
58!

770
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,059
<i>5“</i>

771
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,008
45 seconds!

772
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,242
It's a very secure site.
- lot your cup of tea?

773
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,447
30 seconds.

774
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,549
By the way, they've
committed four murders.

775
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,400
15 seconds.

776
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,916
5...
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

777
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,598
Don't ever do that again.

778
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,066
You squeezed my bu’; pretty hard!

779
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,730
I had no choice?

780
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,139
Your generation...

781
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:32,907
..generally doesn't perform
till their b""* are squeezed hard.

782
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,243
Work with me for 30 days.

783
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,749
If you like it,
we'll continue working.

784
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,786
I'll do anything you say.
Can I go now?

785
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,327
Tomorrow, 10:30 am.
At my police station.

786
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,730
10:30 am?

787
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,427
Fine, I'll be there. Can I go now?

788
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,005
Don't be late, or I'll
issue a warrant against you.

789
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,702
How much more are
you going to sc*** me?

790
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:17,557
Kammi! Why did you leave?

791
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,988
lam going to my office.
- Fine. Don't be furious.

792
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,361
Let's meet at 6:30 pm,
at the Chinese Corner.

793
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,832
Chinese Corner? Why
weren't you born in China?

794
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,962
Well, I've a grand
surprise for our anniversary.

795
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,230
Your arrangements better be good.

796
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,434
I'll be there at 6:30.

797
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,502
Bloody cop, got me in a trouble.

798
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,146
I've my entire life
to serve the country.

799
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,613
If I lose the girl,
I'll be left with nothing.

800
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,886
I'll have to plan the
anniversary as well.

801
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,852
"Cheap goods up for sale."

802
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,693
"Stop racking your brains."

803
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,232
What is this?

804
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,533
"Cheap goods up for sale."

805
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,199
"Stop racking your brains."

806
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,334
"Cheap goods up for sale."

807
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,038
"Stop racking your brains."

808
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,375
"One...two...three...four.."

809
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,849
"My heart sways..."

810
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,011
"My heart sways..."

811
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,449
"In English.."

812
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,681
"My heart sways..."

813
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,054
"The body's no fun."

814
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,389
"N or the top."

815
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:30,329
"You can't buy pizza at
the price of stuffed bread."

816
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:34,333
"Who's going through
the emotional pain?"

817
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,436
"The cow won't sing.."

818
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,877
"..after it lifts its tail."

819
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,312
"When will you come?"

820
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,748
"When will you come?"

821
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,150
"You'll defiantly kill me."

822
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,552
"When will you come?"

823
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:59,093
"l live for you, I die for you."

824
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,186
"What about VWXYZ?"

825
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:04,823
"Sweetheart, when are you coming?"

826
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,931
"Coming when you."

827
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,929
"Remember."

828
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,503
"Every time love's on your list."

829
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,232
"Mutual funds are
subject to market risks."

830
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,549
Kamayani, I've been
trying to call you.

831
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,915
Mickey, where are you?

832
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,317
I'm waiting for you
at the Chinese Corner.

833
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,381
Can you come at the office now?

834
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,582
What are you still
doing at the office?

835
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,894
Don't ask questions, Mickey.

836
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,966
Just come here as soon
as possible. Please.

837
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,348
Kamayani?
- Yes.

838
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,152
Kamayani?

839
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,732
Kamayani, what's wrong?

840
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,136
I messed things up, Mickey.

841
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,538
Messed what up?

842
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,067
I was just leaving to meet you.

843
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,210
My boss gave asked me
to transfer a amount"

844
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,678
..from a client's account.

845
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,880
But, I don't know how..

846
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,109
..in a haste to meet you,
I entered the..

847
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,982
..last two digits of the
client's account wrong.

848
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,620
Relax, Kamayani. Mistakes happen.

849
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,793
Tell your boss, he'll
make a reverse transaction.

850
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,990
Simple.

851
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,566
If he finds out, I'll lose my job..

852
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,796
..and my career will be over.

853
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,001
Well...it's not long
before that happens.

854
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,775
My boss has a meeting
with the auditors at 11 pm.

855
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,443
And he must be on his way here.

856
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,373
Come, Mickey. Let's go from here.
I can't face him now.

857
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,447
Mickey.

858
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,181
Mickey, let's go.
- Hold on, Kamayani.

859
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,901
Kamayani, give me the
bank site's link. - Link?

860
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:32,135
What do you want it for?

861
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,704
<i>I" If'. </i>

862
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,807
Try to reverse the transaction.

863
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,876
You think this is a
joke or a childs play!

864
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,546
It's impossible to
crack this bank's site.

865
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,620
Just give me the link.

866
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,773
Will the guard squeal to your boss?

867
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,008
Forget him, he won't say.

868
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,274
Let's go, Mickey.

869
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,309
Two minutes.

870
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,623
Madam.

871
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,861
The boss is in the building.

872
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,536
Mickey, let's just go from here.

873
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:36,770
They are here.

874
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,337
Kamayani, almost done. Wait.

875
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,488
Yes, done.

876
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,328
Here, enter the account number.

877
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,188
Do it.

878
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:07,126
"The eyes
first...spoke with each other."

879
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:14,906
"Later we just exchange conversation."

880
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:31,082
"The eyes first
spoke with each other."

881
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:38,896
"Later we just exchange conversation."

882
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:43,163
"Let the journey continue."

883
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,769
"Let these events go on."

884
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:55,038
"l pray that my heart
always beats for you."

885
00:57:55,104 --> 00:58:03,319
"l pray that my heart
always beats for you."

886
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,289
"May this continue just like this."

887
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,963
"May this caravan never stop."

888
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:18,972
"l pray that my heart
always beats for you."

889
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:28,708
"l pray that my heart
always beats for you."

890
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,958
Trouble!

891
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,228
I am late.

892
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,397
That cop's going to
beat the shit out of me.

893
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,639
There will be fireworks at
the Police station today.

894
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,378
So, what's your plan for the evening?

895
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,705
Evening?

896
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,780
All my best evenings are unplanned?

897
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,276
What about you?

898
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,653
By the way, my wish for today is..

899
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,287
Be careful what you wish for..

900
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,525
Let's meet in the evening.

901
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,094
There's a surprise for you.
- Surprise?

902
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,324
I want to know.

903
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:54,361
A surprise is a
surprise is a surprise.

904
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,662
Why did that cop
have to call me today?

905
00:59:58,328 --> 00:59:59,466
Fine.

906
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,006
Let's meet in the evening.

907
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,842
Don't worry, I'm there.

908
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,945
Where's Sid?
- Hold on.

909
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,077
Sid? Sid who?

910
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,014
My brother. The ACP. Where is he?

911
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,585
Inside.
- Sorry, Sid. Sorry.

912
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,923
I left on time, but
traffic's a dangerous thing.

913
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,997
And then, there are these
bloody cops at every signal.

914
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,268
Sorry.

915
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,810
Show this sharpness in your work.

916
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,239
Take him away.

917
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,339
And complete the joining formalities.

918
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,542
Yes, sir.

919
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,784
Come on, Mickey. Let's start with you.

920
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,650
I hope you took enough
rest before leaving home.

921
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,815
Let's go. Do you need a
special invitation? Come on.

922
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,868
It's an expensive system.

923
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,939
Yet, it's showing images upside down.

924
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,135
It's made in China, use and throw!

925
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,004
May I?

926
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,140
Sir.

927
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,512
Sir, I mean it.

928
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,281
Do you think he'll do the job?

929
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,852
Sometimes when a lame horse runs..

930
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:25,683
Sitting on such an advanced system.

931
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,227
..and all you can do is
capture videos of cars.

932
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,926
He can leave the
strangest horses behind.

933
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,826
If he doesn't, I'll
stick the rod up his bottom.

934
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,492
He'll keep jumping
around like an arse.

935
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,076
Done.
- Done?

936
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,710
How do you do it so quickly?

937
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,584
When you hand a
difficult job to a lazybone"

938
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,026
..he always finds an
easy way to do it.

939
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:19,839
Find anything?

940
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,109
Yes, I'm quite deep inside.

941
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:26,485
Then, you must be enjoying it too.

942
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,086
I'll send tea for you.

943
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,533
It's just like I feared.

944
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,844
I've lost the track of this case.
- What happened?

945
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,104
Last night, someone
hacked Anwar Raja's account"

946
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,084
..at the Excalibur
Bank's Hauz Khaus branch..

947
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,586
..and stole 100 crores.

948
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,359
ExcaliburmBank?
- Yes.

949
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,791
Excalibur Bank.

950
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:11,021
They stole Anwar Raja's money,
and right now he's in a flight.

951
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,127
And will be landing here
in Delhi after 12 hours.

952
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,128
And as soon as it does,
he'll screw us all..

953
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,695
"but, he won't spare
that hacker as well.

954
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,143
This is definitely the
doing of the 'Bhram Gang'.

955
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,742
They stuck their
nose in the wrong place.

956
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,276
Did you find anything?

957
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:31,880
Mickey?
- Yes.

958
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,878
Did you find anything?
- I'll look.

959
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,148
Hurry UP-

960
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,922
'It didn't take me long to realize..'

961
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,858
'..that I had made an a“ of myself.‘

962
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:09,916
Mickey!

963
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,854
Did you find anything?
- No, I'll...look.

964
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:14,287
Hurry UP-

965
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,899
Come on, Kamayani. Pickup, pickup.

966
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:28,404
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

967
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,005
Come on, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

968
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,374
Come on, Kamayani.

969
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,885
Hey Gadget geek. What are you doing?

970
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,855
Working, what else?

971
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,389
ls this how you work,
strolling around the room?

972
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,163
Do you take me for a fool?

973
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,855
Take your bag.

974
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,501
Come along.
- Where?

975
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,963
Sir's called for you?
- Why?

976
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,002
He'll sing you a lullaby.

977
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,967
Or give you a lollipop.

978
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,859
Must be a girl?
- What?

979
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,925
People often look this
tensed on two occasions.

980
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,191
Either it concerns a girl, or money.

981
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,934
You don't look like
you've money to lose.

982
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,367
Must be a girl.

983
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,970
Who is Anwar Raja, Mr. Bhalla?

984
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:12,838
Wonderful. Mr. Bhalla.

985
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,444
Anwar Raja is a
broker for the Ministers.

986
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,842
He turns their black money into white.

987
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,945
He's well-connected. Why?
- Io, l..

988
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,159
Come on out..

989
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,895
"It's a tall building.."

990
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,093
"Your lift's closed.."

991
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,431
Mr. Bhalla, what are we doing here?

992
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:39,967
It's a crime scene.

993
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,677
Crime...scene?

994
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,815
It's easy to commit crimes
with a tin-can on your lap.

995
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,380
Let's go see a real crime-scene.

996
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,915
We'll see how brave you really are.

997
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,379
Come on.

998
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,524
Surprise!

999
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:06,818
Sir.

1000
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,692
Isn't she the same girl, from Dubai?

1001
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,531
The one we arrested
for carrying drugs.

1002
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,998
With the same cyanide poison.

1003
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,000
Yes, sir.

1004
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,305
Sir.

1005
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,506
Yes, sir.

1006
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,149
She's a foreigner as well. From Dubai.

1007
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,717
lame, Kate George.

1008
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,181
I'll inform the Embassy right away.

1009
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,447
The killing pattern is similar, sir.

1010
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,526
It's difficult to say
whether she was a hacker or not.

1011
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,789
Sir.

1012
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,135
But, sir...CBl...

1013
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,364
Okay, sir.

1014
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,401
Sir.

1015
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,383
What happened?

1016
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,114
Why are you so silent?

1017
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,754
Oh...

1018
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,325
First time seeing a dead body.

1019
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,023
I'll get you a closer look.

1020
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,126
Come on.

1021
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,763
Move aside.

1022
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,269
Mickey wants to take a
closer look at the body.

1023
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,267
Take a look.

1024
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,342
Died at a young age.

1025
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,135
Touch her, she's completely cold.

1026
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,509
Touch her.

1027
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,479
Come on, touch her.

1028
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,277
She won't bite you. Touch her.

1029
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,547
Go to the bathroom.

1030
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,445
You will mess up the crime scene.

1031
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,468
'This is Kamayani.'

1032
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,945
'She's a foreigner
as well. From Dubai.'

1033
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,539
'N ame, Kate George.'

1034
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,553
'I'm a highly educated
girl from Pondicherry.'

1035
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,012
'I am not useless like you.'

1036
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,002
'I am trapped.'

1037
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,069
'First, the 100 crores theft,
and now this murder.'

1038
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,340
'What do I do?'

1039
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,676
'What do I do?'

1040
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,917
'Should I tell Sid?

1041
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,583
'Whenever you can't find a solution..

1042
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,180
'..Then, wait till the morning.'

1043
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,383
'Just leave it. Relax.'

1044
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,425
<i>'"0:</i>

1045
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:05,431
Oh no!

1046
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:20,677
Sir, if you don't mind.
Can I touch her once?

1047
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,120
ls she your mother?

1048
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,956
Do you want to touch her
feet and take blessings?

1049
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,157
Just stand there, and
don't finger me! Smart Arse!

1050
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,876
The murderer spent the
night with her here last night.

1051
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,483
The body hasn't stiffened yet.

1052
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,920
That means, she died few hours ago.

1053
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,765
How did she get mud on her nails?

1054
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,637
Send it to the lab for testing.

1055
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,371
Attention everybody!

1056
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,817
The murderer who's
been giving us the slip..

1057
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,752
...for the last 45 days, and we
had no evidence against him..

1058
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,322
"except for a clue
of a poison needle.

1059
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,915
low, we've complete
possibilities of apprehending him.

1060
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,322
Because this time he
has left evidence behind.

1061
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,421
Search every nook and
corner of the house.

1062
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,863
Don't miss a single clue.

1063
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:43,026
Just remember. We've 11 hours.

1064
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,997
Within 11 hours, that murderer's..

1065
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,562
..name should be in our files, and..

1066
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,868
..he should personally be behind bars.

1067
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,067
Get going!

1068
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:51,638
Come here.

1069
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,416
You're lucky for us.

1070
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,120
We'll definitely catch
that murderer this time.

1071
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,387
Open the computer in
the girl's bedroom..

1072
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:04,856
..and see what you can find.

1073
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,453
And hurry up, you don't have time.

1074
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,028
Are you feeling okay?
- Yes. What happened?

1075
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,435
First time you followed
my orders without arguing.

1076
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,168
Wear these gloves.

1077
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,370
Otherwise, we might
not find the murderer..

1078
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,714
..and you will end up
leaving fingerprints all over.

1079
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,581
ls the guard, who was
on night duty, here?

1080
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,216
He's on the way, will be here soon.

1081
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,089
Listen"

1082
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,594
I want the CCTV footage as well.
- Yes, sir. Of course.

1083
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,106
What?

1084
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,508
What?

1085
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,947
I wonder what he is typing.

1086
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,975
I told my wife so many
times to massage my knees.

1087
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,272
sir!

1088
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:08,741
sir!

1089
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,578
Sir. Look what I found.

1090
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,319
The generation these days"

1091
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,426
They'll leave there clothes open..

1092
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,122
"but, their phone's are locked.

1093
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:28,961
Here.

1094
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,167
What are you looking at?
You're a hacker.

1095
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,699
Unlock it.

1096
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,953
Will you please leave?
- Why?

1097
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,596
I can't work if you stand on my head.

1098
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:27,954
What are you..

1099
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,858
Yes.

1100
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,992
I'll call you back,
I'm busy right now.

1101
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:37,935
Listen"

1102
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,667
I'm busy now..

1103
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,405
Why don't you grow your
bloody eggplants at the back?

1104
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:45,443
A lady was murdered here..

1105
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,808
..and you want me to buy eggplants.

1106
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:51,113
Do you know all the ladies in Delhi?

1107
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,013
"Who died?" Keep the phone.

1108
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,015
What are you doing?

1109
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:58,254
Find anything?
- Nothing.

1110
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,182
Nothing?

1111
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,591
There's no data on the phone.

1112
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,758
Then why were you...doing this?

1113
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,858
That's how you unlock a phone.

1114
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:08,528
Are you trying to teach me?

1115
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,625
ls this how you unlock a phone..

1116
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:11,033
..by hammering on the keys.

1117
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,763
Mr. Bhalla, why
don't you do it yourself?

1118
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:17,899
Look, Mickey.

1119
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,038
You talk so respectfully
only when you're in trouble.

1120
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,112
Don't be too over-smart.

1121
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,248
Smartass from Malviya Hagar.

1122
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,547
Get to work.

1123
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,348
The CCTV recording's arrived, sir.

1124
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:36,921
The girl died around 10-11am.

1125
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,357
Show me the recording after 9am.

1126
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,462
Rewind.

1127
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,668
Stop.

1128
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,016
This man doesn't seem right.

1129
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,622
The camera's angle..

1130
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:12,425
Why can't I see it clearly?

1131
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,287
Can't the image get any better?

1132
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,221
Mickey.

1133
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:17,862
Back at the police station"

1134
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,694
..you fixed those messed up images.

1135
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,564
Why don't you work your
magical fingers here too?

1136
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:33,209
I... actually, the
image isn't the problem.

1137
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,776
It's the camera's angle.

1138
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,383
There's no way to fix it.

1139
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:41,085
There must be a way to
see his face clearly.

1140
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,521
What if we send this video
for resolution enhancement?

1141
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:48,421
Io, sir..
- Then we can see his face clearly.

1142
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:49,587
Play'-

1143
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,932
Hold on. Stop. Stop.

1144
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,540
Don't you see something strange?

1145
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,008
The girl was murdered this morning.

1146
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,341
The murderer will enter
the building, not exit it.

1147
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:07,970
Confirmed, it's him. l..

1148
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,512
0 poor man's Sherlock Holmes.

1149
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,483
You aren't doing the job we gave you.

1150
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,158
But, you've an advice for us.

1151
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,990
Io, l..
- Io, what..

1152
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,052
I say the first one's
the murderer, not him.

1153
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,223
What can you do?

1154
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,595
Io, sir, l..
- Don't worry.

1155
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,361
This is just a preliminary inspection.

1156
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,228
We'll check everyone.

1157
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,896
But, why aren't you on the computer?

1158
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,872
Sir, I wanted to tell you..

1159
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,267
Call him.

1160
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:42,774
What were you saying?

1161
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,615
I was saying I checked
the entire computer.

1162
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:52,051
All of Kam Kate's data's been erased.

1163
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,191
I could recoverjust one folder,
and it's encrypted.

1164
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,823
I mean, it's locked
and I'll need to open it.

1165
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,025
Then unlock it.
You're the hacker, not me.

1166
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,368
I need a software to
unlock it which is at home.

1167
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,461
I'll take it home, unlock it..

1168
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:07,302
..and bring it back by morning.

1169
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,466
Okay?
- Morning?

1170
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,035
Are you crazy?

1171
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,745
Sid, that software"
- You can't go.

1172
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,673
Half an hour to go,
another half to come back.

1173
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,409
Will be back in one and
a half hours, promise.

1174
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,548
Genius mathematician you are!

1175
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,379
Go.

1176
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,654
Why are you going inside?
- To get my laptop.

1177
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,219
Sir.

1178
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:33,061
Sir. I tell you. That boy's behind it.

1179
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,570
Can you identify him?

1180
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:43,601
Sir, I can tell you how
many strands of hair he had.

1181
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,070
Ilote it down.

1182
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,612
Yes, uncle.
- He was tall.

1183
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,917
His eyes were round like a frog.

1184
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,991
And he was wearing torn jeans.

1185
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:05,093
And his T-shin.

1186
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:08,693
There was long-eared
cartoon drawn on it.

1187
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,395
Just like on a kid's t-shirt.

1188
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,568
That's it.

1189
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,876
Sir, that's the
description of any 24 year old boy.

1190
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,440
Uncle. Tell me
something unique about him.

1191
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,749
Sir, then you just
bring him in front of me.

1192
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,475
I'll identify him in ajiffy.

1193
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,809
I can assure you he's behind all this.

1194
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,014
Mickey!

1195
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:30,986
Mickey!

1196
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,724
He ran out through the back.

1197
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,228
Call the sketch artist.

1198
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,660
I want that boy's sketch.

1199
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:42,794
I ow.

1200
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,599
"Move on.."

1201
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,933
Let's go..
- I don't want to.

1202
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,474
Come on, you don't have a fare.

1203
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:51,511
Io, I am busy thinking.

1204
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,306
You can think on the way. Come on.

1205
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,579
You seem to be in such a hurry
as if you've committed murder!

1206
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,708
What's the hurry?
- Shut up and let's go!

1207
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,450
Son, where to?

1208
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:06,892
'Does the problem too big?'

1209
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:08,757
'Seems difficult to find a solution.'

1210
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,425
'Start from where it all began.'

1211
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,792
Take me to Ber Sarai.

1212
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,452
Give me your phone.

1213
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,792
The battery of my phone's dead.

1214
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,593
I need to make an urgent call. Please!

1215
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:53,995
Keep this Rs.500. Please.

1216
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,740
No, no, there was no need for this.

1217
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,613
Oh no!

1218
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,852
Hi, you've reached the
voice-mail of Bombay Bakery.

1219
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,223
Please leave a message after the beep.

01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,654

1221
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,181
Yes.

1222
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:45,723
Bhalla?

1223
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,650
'Yes! Enter the account number.'

1224
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,541
Excuse me, Excalibur?
- 8th floor.

1225
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:19,975
8th or 7th? - It's been on
the 8th floor for 4 years.

1226
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,000
Well, it's the month end.

1227
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,443
So, we need to put in more hours.

1228
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,611
Forget that. Yes..

1229
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,617
Forget that" 7 up and 2 down.

1230
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:52,650
Excuse me.

1231
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,186
Bank's closed, come back tomorrow.

1232
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:57,016
Io, not you.

1233
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,059
Io, l..
- I wanted to know if..

1234
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,651
..Kate George or Kamayani works here.

1235
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:05,161
Look, we're not allowed to
give employee information.

1236
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,164
lot you.

1237
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,359
low, two up... Yes.
- Excuse me. Ma'am..

1238
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:14,032
And three"
- Just listen"

1239
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:15,601
Ma'am..
- Right.

1240
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,236
Ma'am..
- Right.

1241
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:18,939
I've been asking you something"

1242
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,104
..why don't you answer?

1243
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:23,040
Guards! Guards!

1244
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:24,138
Guards! Come quickly.

1245
01:27:58,806 --> 01:27:59,944
'Have you seen a magician"

1246
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,454
'..make an elephant
disappear in a crowd.'

1247
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:06,481
'What he shows us is not real.'

1248
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:17,735
Where have you been since yesterday?

1249
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,534
I'm in a big mess.
- What happened?

1250
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,972
Kamayani's been murdered.

1251
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,501
What?

1252
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:26,072
How? Who? Where?
- I don't know.

1253
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,840
All I know is I didn't do it.

1254
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,312
100 crores have been stolen.

1255
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:30,542
And, I'm being blamed for it all.

1256
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,016
I really don't know what to do.

1257
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:33,511
Where are you now?

1258
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:34,780
lam in the bank's building.

1259
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:36,480
Mickey, so much happened.

1260
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:37,921
And you're telling us now.

1261
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,460
They hired the entire floor..

1262
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:53,334
.and setup a duplicate bank,
right below the same bank.

1263
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,498
They just changed the name.

1264
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,199
From Excalibur Bank to
Excalibur Securities.

1265
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,709
Didn't you visit her floor?
- I did.

1266
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,211
Three times.

1267
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,281
She called me twice, and once I
had even gone there to propose her.

1268
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,542
What?
- What?

1269
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,680
The entire thing was pre-planned.

1270
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,741
So that when I hack their system.

1271
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:07,752
..l wouldn't know that I'm hacking"

1272
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,847
"the Excalibur Bank
system and stealing 100 crores.

1273
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,219
Mickey. But, they
could've made you do this"

1274
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,417
..from anywhere.

1275
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:14,456
Io, Chutney.

1276
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,519
The Excalibur Bank systems
couldn't be hacked externally.

1277
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:18,563
The plan was simple.

1278
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,428
Get me inside to do this job.

1279
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,960
The firewall inside the
bank wasn't strong enough.

1280
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:26,502
That's why you hacked such
a secure site internally.

1281
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:27,631
But, didn't you ever notice"

1282
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,072
"that, you're going on the 8th floor?

1283
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,371
I looked...l pressed 7th floor.

1284
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,344
When they can plan
such a big charade"

1285
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:36,109
..can't they
manipulate the lift system.

1286
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,260
The boy knows a lot now.

1287
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:53,125
What do we do with him?

1288
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,602
Mickey, that girl Kate... Kamayani..

1289
01:29:58,659 --> 01:29:59,865
Or whoever she is.

1290
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:01,634
She couldn't have done this alone.

1291
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,539
Someone was definitely helping her.

1292
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:05,033
Try to remember.

1293
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:07,742
Her office staff.

1294
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:10,776
Her boss. Who was
supposed to come that night.

1295
01:30:10,838 --> 01:30:13,045
'Madam. Sir's entered the building.'

1296
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:17,682
All those employees were fake.

1297
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,456
'Sir's entered the building.'

1298
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,154
Chutney!

1299
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,928
There was a security guard that night.

1300
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,334
Pancho?
- Yeah. I sent him.

1301
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:37,899
low, he'll be a big help to you.
- Thanks, Floppy.

1302
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,579
I just need to find that mastermind.

1303
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:45,943
What's the plan?

1304
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:48,948
Wait, I'll call you back.

1305
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:51,617
Siddhant, I'll be there in 20
minutes. My battery's very low.

1306
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,519
Siddhant!

1307
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:57,795
Yes.

1308
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:01,725
Chutney. Do one thing.

1309
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,162
Check out Kamayani's
Excalibur Securities site.

1310
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:05,902
And Floppy, I'm forwarding you".

1311
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,064
..a number I found
on Kamayani's number.

1312
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:08,868
Track it down.
- Okay.

1313
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,682
There's nothing here, Mickey.

1314
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,218
The site's missing,
just like the office.

1315
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:22,117
If someone created a fake site..

1316
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,780
..then, the domain must
be registered to someone.

1317
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,118
Check it online.

1318
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,883
<i>Nora. The number on
KamayanTs phone".</i>

1319
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,155
"belongs to some Babloo.

1320
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,495
The Excalibur"

1321
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:35,628
The Excalibur domain's also
registered in some Babloo's name.

1322
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,235
Oh no.

1323
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,100
Mickey, check your phone.

1324
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:45,203
Babloo?

1325
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,340
He's that guard.

1326
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:50,211
He's no guard. He's
a software engineer.

1327
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:51,614
Why was a software engineer.

1328
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,276
..working as a guard in a bank?

1329
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,750
ls he...the mastermind?

1330
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:08,095
Oh no.

1331
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,397
The location of his phone
is close to you. - What?

1332
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:15,469
Mickey, get out of there.
You can get in a mess.

1333
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,337
Hello, Mickey!

1334
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:43,224
Somebody is following you!

1335
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:41,289
So, this was your plan.
- I was after them for a year.

1336
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,761
But these Bhram Gang stole my plan..

1337
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:46,957
..and ruined my game.
- Bhram Gang?

1338
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,636
Pancho.
- Run, Mickey.

1339
01:33:57,732 --> 01:33:59,006
Catch him.

1340
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,608
That guy's your lifeline to freedom.

1341
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,009
Don't let him escape.

1342
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:03,571
Mickey, run!

1343
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:04,340
Take the next left.

1344
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,974
Are you sure?

1345
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,886
Floppy, where now?

1346
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:23,986
Take a left. Left.

1347
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:25,564
Your left or mine.

1348
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:27,792
Left's just left. What are you saying?

1349
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,128
There's a left up ahead as well.

1350
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:32,102
The left that you left behind.
Mickey, left.

1351
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:49,814
Straight. Just go straight.

1352
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:52,323
It's a dead end.
- Dead"

1353
01:35:58,152 --> 01:35:58,789
Yes..

1354
01:35:58,853 --> 01:35:59,797
Go straight"

1355
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,094
I've been going straight.

1356
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:03,533
I mean right. Take a right.

1357
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,098
Right. Right.

1358
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:14,545
Mickey, he's getting
ahead of you. Run.

1359
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:22,278
Tell me.

1360
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,056
Where now?

1361
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,956
Where's the link?
- What link?

1362
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:49,759
The link that you used
to transfer 100 crores.

1363
01:38:49,823 --> 01:38:50,961
That link.

1364
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:54,069
You're trapped, just like Kamayani.

1365
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:56,239
Don't you have the money?

1366
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:58,239
What do I look like to you?

1367
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:02,270
Why did you kill Kamayani?

1368
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:03,610
I didn't kill her.

1369
01:39:04,038 --> 01:39:05,016
By the time I arrived at her home..

1370
01:39:05,072 --> 01:39:06,449
..she was already dead.

1371
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:10,688
Who killed Kamayani?

1372
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,348
Must be the Bhram Gang.

1373
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:13,786
Bhram Gang.

1374
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,265
'Look. Life's like a wheel.'

1375
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:04,507
'To keep it in balance,
one has to keep moving.'

1376
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:06,077
'If you stop..'

1377
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:20,956
Take me to Begh Sarai.

1378
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,428
Hello. You've reached the
voice-mail of Bombay Bakery.

1379
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:31,629
Please leave a message after the beep.

1380
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,176
Chutney. Floppy.

1381
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:40,009
Bombay Bakery is our last clue.

1382
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,236
Find out where it is, and who owns it.

1383
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:43,414
I'm coming to see you two.

1384
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,281
So, are you done?

1385
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:50,583
Sir, here's the sketch.

1386
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:53,091
So, let's see who you are.

1387
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:55,320
An hour ago you said
you're coming in 20 minutes.

1388
01:40:55,616 --> 01:40:58,028
Sid, I'll be there as
soon as I unlock the file.

1389
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:01,525
Sir.

1390
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:03,496
Sir, take a look at this boy.

1391
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:04,900
He looks just like Mickey.

1392
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:09,032
sir!

1393
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,704
Sir. He's Mickey.

1394
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:16,714
Bloody... Mickey Virus.

1395
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:19,578
Now I get his game.

1396
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:21,912
He's the guy, Bhalla.

1397
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:23,348
He's the guy.

1398
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:31,758
FIOPPY-

1399
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:32,997
Did you find anything
about the voice-mail?

1400
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:33,963
I am on it.

1401
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,193
Hurry UP-

1402
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,800
Professor?
- We called him.

1403
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:38,392
Don't worry, Mickey.

1404
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:39,961
The Professor has studied your case.

1405
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:42,132
From Kamayani to the theft
of 100 crores, everything.

1406
01:41:42,896 --> 01:41:46,173
Case study.
- Whoever sent that girl after you..

1407
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:49,774
..did an extensive research on you.

1408
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,142
Chutney.

1409
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:55,512
Look, Kamayani. Look.

1410
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:57,918
Kamayani looks just like
Kung-fu Chameli in-person.

1411
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,554
But...she loved me.

1412
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:09,458
Maybe, just like you fell for her,
she fell for someone else.

1413
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:13,932
But...who could that be?

1414
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:18,499
Right now...we've to think
of a way to save you. Okay.

1415
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:21,642
That girl's dead and these
mysterious people are still after you

1416
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:24,282
It means that, they
still don't have the money.

1417
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,852
If we can find the money,
we can save you.

1418
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:31,789
Do you remember where
you transferred the money?

1419
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:34,021
No, Prof. I just hacked the account.

1420
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:35,883
Kamayani transferred
the money that night.

1421
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,322
Think, Mickey.

1422
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:39,860
You might remember something.

1423
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:41,260
Anything. Something.

1424
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:42,526
Something she said. A link.

1425
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:45,101
Anything that can
take us to that money.

1426
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:47,063
There's just one link. Bombay Bakery.

1427
01:42:47,327 --> 01:42:48,362
That's it.
- Arora.

1428
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,234
The voice on this
voice-mail isn't of a girl.

1429
01:42:52,599 --> 01:42:54,169
It's been doctored using a computer.

1430
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:57,880
Listen.
- Voice Modulation in progress.

1431

Please leave your

1440
01:43:21,428 --> 01:43:22,202
Professor.

1441
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,509
This means all the messages were..

1442
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:26,635
..being recorded at this
number for that mastermind.

1443
01:43:30,137 --> 01:43:31,639
I recognize this voice?

1444
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:34,452
What?
- Who is he?

1445
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:57,569
Where are you hiding?
- You were the one hiding, Sid.

1446
01:43:58,131 --> 01:43:59,542
Mr. Bombay Bakery.

1447
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:02,513
<i>Kamayani. Babhm. W“ craves.</i>

1448
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:03,673
I know everything.

1449
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:08,376
It was a nice plan. But,
you chose the wrong guy.

1450
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:12,549
Io, I chose the right guy.

1451
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:15,290
low, all the evidence is against you.

1452
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:17,659
So, better tell me
where are the 100 crores.

1453
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:19,627
Because, only I can help you.

1454
01:44:19,786 --> 01:44:20,958
You want the money.

1455
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:23,634
Come see me below
Moolchand Bridge in an hour.

1456
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:25,167
Are you out of your mind?

1457
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:27,199
Will you..
- One hour, Siddhant!

1458
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:28,798
One hour.

1459
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:32,234
Otherwise, I'll disappear in
thin air with your 100 crores.

1460
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:34,034
You can keep looking.

1461
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:35,942
Your time starts now.

1462
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:43,049
But, you don't have the 100 crores!

1463
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:45,582
I know that, but he doesn't.

1464
01:44:45,879 --> 01:44:47,222
Great idea, Mickey.

1465
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,652
Let's corner him at Moolchand Bridge.

1466
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,660
And, we'll shoot
everything through a hidden camera"

1467
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:51,388
..and get him arrested.

1468
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,624
Police!

1469
01:44:55,889 --> 01:44:58,597
Mickey. They came
here looking for you.

1470
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:01,964
Mickey. Without the money,
we can't do anything.

1471
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:05,374
Chutney. Do one thing.
- Yes.

1472
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,404
Hack the Bhram Gang site.
- Okay.

1473
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:08,912
Sid and Babloo suspected them.

1474
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:11,047
Floppy, give me your car keys.
- Here.

1475
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:12,380
Prof.

1476
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:14,611
Do it, please.

1477
01:45:15,175 --> 01:45:16,085
Do one thing.
- Yes?

1478
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:18,554
Go to Pancho's house, he'll help you.
- Okay.

1479
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:19,784
Mickey"

1480
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:26,931
Sir. The place is locked.

1481
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,504
Pancho. I heard you got beaten up.

1482
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:46,208
Babloo thrashed you like a dog.

1483
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:06,292
Yes, Chutney.

1484
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:09,206
Mickey. Send me a site to
crack the Bhram Gang site.

1485
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:10,866
Yes. I'll message it to you.

1486
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:12,274
0k. Bye.

1487
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:27,325
"Eyes say to weep.."

1488
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:30,394
"Wipe out the pain in the heart."

1489
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:33,064
"Lord is angry, My beloved
who is like God is angry."

1490
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:40,162
"Why did this happen?"

1491
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:43,173
"My shadow of my soul is lost."

1492
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:49,508
"Why has my love deserted me?"

1493
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:52,715
"How to stop weeping?"

1494
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:56,148
"How do I stop breathing?"

1495
01:46:56,243 --> 01:47:00,419
"l await you, please come."

1496
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,434
"My beloved, I don't
want to live without you."

1497
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:21,877
"My beloved, I don't
want to live without you."

1498
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:37,820
"Eyes say to weep.."

1499
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:40,693
"Wipe out the pain in the heart."

1500
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:47,933
"Lord is angry, My beloved
who is like God is angry."

1501
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:02,645
"l will not accept defeat now."

1502
01:48:02,742 --> 01:48:05,689
"l will defeat destiny."

1503
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:08,919
"The pride and attitude."

1504
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:09,960
Where did this mud in
her nails come from?

1505
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,656
"l will erase it."

1506
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,359
"l will attain you."

1507
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:18,459
"Or I will erase myself."

1508
01:48:18,525 --> 01:48:21,904
"But this is the play of destiny."

1509
01:48:22,195 --> 01:48:25,642
"l will destroy it."

1510
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:29,006
"Eyes say to weep.."

1511
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:32,016
"Wipe out the pain in the heart."

1512
01:48:32,205 --> 01:48:38,588
"Lord is angry, My beloved
who is like God is angry."

1513
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:41,749
"Why did this happen?"

1514
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:44,829
"My shadow of my soul is lost."

1515
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:51,228
"Why has my love deserted me?"

1516
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:54,272
"How to stop weeping?"

1517
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,808
"How do I stop breathing?"

1518
01:48:57,864 --> 01:49:03,246
"l await you, please come."

1519
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:08,046
"My beloved, I don't
want to live without you.

01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:13,815
"My beloved, I don't
want to live without you.

1521
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:20,090
"Even if I want to live, I can't."

1522
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:23,066
"There is nothing without you."

1523
01:49:23,123 --> 01:49:27,230
"My beloved, I don't
want to live without you."

1524
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:33,171
"O My beloved, I don't
want to live without you."

1525
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:36,745
You're stupid.

1526
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:39,708
She had a point.

1527
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:05,630
Sid. Change of plans...

1528
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:08,129
Meet me at Nehru Place
Parking Lot in 20 minutes.

1529
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:11,942
Why are you trying to
fight a war you can't win?

1530
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:13,272
Just do as I say.

1531
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,684
Floppy. I've found the 100 crores.

1532
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:28,151
But, why are you changing the plan?

1533
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:29,818
Meet me at Nehru Place
Parking Lot in 20 minutes

1534
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,288
But, why are you changing the plan?

1535
01:51:33,086 --> 01:51:33,860
I'll tell you later.

1536
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,921
And, why isn't Chutney
answering her phone?

1537
01:51:35,755 --> 01:51:36,927
Wait, I'll find out.

1538
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:47,611
You? That's him.

1539
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:50,881
Got you Mickey the Virus!

1540
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:56,412
Game over!

1541
01:52:17,163 --> 01:52:18,574
What a disgraceful place.

1542
01:52:20,366 --> 01:52:22,209
I wonder why that fool
Mickey chose this place.

1543
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:23,947
He said he'll tell us once he's here.

1544
01:52:24,003 --> 01:52:25,346
But, where is he?

1545
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:27,043
Where is he?
- Must be on the way.

1546
01:52:27,107 --> 01:52:28,814
Professor, please try to relax.

1547
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:29,985
Come on, I mean"

1548
01:52:30,844 --> 01:52:32,380
What can I say?

1549
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:41,296
ls that Mickey?

1550
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:55,671
Take a look.

1551
01:52:56,002 --> 01:52:56,878
Take a look.

1552
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:06,920
Mickey.

1553
01:53:35,575 --> 01:53:37,851
You bas""* why did you kill him?

1554
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:40,119
Stop abusing.

1555
01:53:40,914 --> 01:53:42,018
You should thank me instead.

1556
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:44,390
I just saved your life.

1557
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:47,762
Otherwise, he would've killed you.

1558
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:58,035
'Don't ever do that again.'

1559
01:54:00,366 --> 01:54:03,870
Bhram Gang belongs to Floppy,
Professor and Pancho.

1560
01:54:09,909 --> 01:54:12,116
They're the original
mastermind of this story.

1561
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:16,223
They killed those
Hackers and Kamayani.

1562
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:23,198
You killed Kamayani.

1563
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:26,937
You killed Kamayani.

1564
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:27,698
Why?

1565
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:32,867
Mickeymwe didn't want to kill her.

1566
01:54:48,648 --> 01:54:49,786
She's Mickey's girlfriend.

1567
01:54:51,851 --> 01:54:53,228
Listen! Please tell
us where the money is.

1568
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:54,731
Listen! We don't
have a problem with you.

1569
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:56,266
We'll leave. Just tell
us where the money is.

1570
01:54:56,356 --> 01:54:57,528
Why don't you tell us?

1571
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:06,238
But..
- Let's go. Come on.

1572
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:12,179
You killed Kamayani for money.

1573
01:55:15,308 --> 01:55:16,844
It was a grave mistake.

1574
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:21,623
You knew they're the Bhram Gang.

1575
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:22,985
Then, why didn't you catch them?

1576
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:25,454
At least Kamayani
could have been saved!

1577
01:55:26,552 --> 01:55:28,862
You'll ask and I'll
tell you everything.

1578
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:32,296
So that you can
capture our conversation"

1579
01:55:32,358 --> 01:55:34,304
..on the parking let's CCTV cameras.

1580
01:55:37,063 --> 01:55:38,133
What do I look like?

1581
01:55:39,065 --> 01:55:40,169
I've out the CCTV wires.

1582
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:44,140
Where's the money, Mickey.

1583
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,178
You want the money, don't you?

1584
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:55,020
Bhram Gang's Mastermind.

1585
01:55:55,648 --> 01:55:56,854
You want the money as well, don't you?

1586
01:55:57,383 --> 01:55:58,259
Come out.

1587
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:13,511
Mickeymgive me the link to the money.

1588
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:23,854
Professor. You've brought
the entire Bhram Gang along.

1589
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:26,821
Snatch it.

1590
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:28,623
Professor, don't come any closer.

1591
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:29,987
Otherwise, I will press this button..

1592
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:30,857
..and the money will be transferred"

1593
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,658
..back into Anwar Raja's account.

1594
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:40,027
There were two teams in this game.

1595
01:56:41,561 --> 01:56:44,508
Team Bhram Gang, led by Professor.

1596
01:56:45,264 --> 01:56:46,242
Floppy and Pancho.

1597
01:56:47,233 --> 01:56:48,143
But, Siddhant.

1598
01:56:49,268 --> 01:56:51,407
When did you enter
this game with your team?

1599
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:00,657
When two hackers were killed...

1600
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,161
A thought crossed my mind.

1601
01:57:06,252 --> 01:57:07,492
Hacking means money.

1602
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:13,498
There's a saying amongst us.
Only be honest till a limit.

1603
01:57:16,429 --> 01:57:19,239
During the hacker
investigation I came across Babloo.

1604
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:21,938
Corrupt power broker Anwar
Raja's got an account in the bank..

1605
01:57:22,568 --> 01:57:25,674
..where he's stashed
billions in black money.

1606
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:34,583
The small time software engineer
Babloo couldn't hack the account"

1607
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:38,121
..he even tried to take
Bhram Gang's help online.

1608
01:57:39,652 --> 01:57:41,859
But these guys
hacked his email instead"

1609
01:57:42,855 --> 01:57:44,493
..and stole all his information.

1610
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:51,674
And, when Bhram Gang couldn't"

1611
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:53,438
"hack Anwar Raja's account either"

1612
01:57:54,367 --> 01:57:55,869
"they called hackers from overseas.

1613
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:58,612
But, why call them this far?

1614
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:01,048
Come on, Mickey. Don't
be such a bad student.

1615
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:04,013
We called them to India because"

1616
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:06,147
..tomorrow if the news
of the theft breaks out..

1617
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:10,058
"these corrupt politicians In
India won't let it leak out,

1618
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:13,090
After those hackers failed..

1619
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:15,860
"sending them back was
not an option for Bhram Gang.

1620
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:26,237
You didn't have an
alternative so you killed them.

1621
01:58:29,469 --> 01:58:31,676
You could've employed the
Bhram Gang for this job.

1622
01:58:32,371 --> 01:58:33,008
Then, why me?

1623
01:58:33,206 --> 01:58:35,277
They were outsourcing
hackers from outside"

1624
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:37,883
"so, they couldn't have helped me.

1625
01:58:39,812 --> 01:58:43,624
And, by hacking their
secure site under a minute"

1626
01:58:43,683 --> 01:58:46,857
"you proved, that I
bet on the right horse.

1627
01:58:49,021 --> 01:58:51,262
I just had to do a
little research on you.

1628
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:53,760
Because your rules are different.

1629
01:58:53,826 --> 01:58:55,965
'I don't work 'for' or
with' anyone. That's my rule.'

1630
01:58:57,597 --> 01:58:58,439
'What's that, sir?'

1631
01:58:58,764 --> 01:59:03,270
So I felt...I'll have to do
something about your childish heart.

1632
01:59:05,404 --> 01:59:06,940
And you sent Kamayani.

1633
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:10,452
Right move at the right moment.

1634
01:59:11,244 --> 01:59:16,819
'I don't want to get stuck
in these legal procedures.'

1635
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:20,660
'Sir, please.'

1636
01:59:22,088 --> 01:59:25,467
'I'm ready to do anything you want.'

1637
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:29,272
You used Kamayani..

1638
01:59:30,696 --> 01:59:32,733
"and, made Babloo
stall her, to keep an eye.

1639
01:59:32,798 --> 01:59:33,799
It was necessary.

1640
01:59:34,267 --> 01:59:36,907
The virus called love is a bad one.

1641
01:59:38,337 --> 01:59:40,476
And used this pressure against you.

1642
01:59:42,909 --> 01:59:44,286
First time, you were in a hurry..

1643
01:59:44,343 --> 01:59:46,186
..to throw your
girlfriend an anniversary party.

1644
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:50,125
And the second time, you were
under pressure to save herjob.

1645
01:59:50,449 --> 01:59:53,396
'I messed up everything.
- Kamayani, just give me the link.'

1646
01:59:57,056 --> 01:59:59,696
You used that police
mind in the right away, ACP.

1647
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:03,563
And we bookworms were
trying to hack it from outside.

1648
02:00:05,731 --> 02:00:08,234
But, you trapped him and
took him inside the bank.

1649
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:11,181
..where it was comparatively easier..

1650
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:12,911
..to break the bank's firewalls.

1651
02:00:13,072 --> 02:00:15,348
And, at the right
moment you pressurized me..

1652
02:00:16,142 --> 02:00:17,849
..and I hacked the bank's secure site.

1653
02:00:18,411 --> 02:00:20,152
That's the problem
with this generation.

1654
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:24,456
They don't perform until
you don't apply pressure.

1655
02:00:24,650 --> 02:00:25,822
And you pressurized me again..

1656
02:00:25,918 --> 02:00:27,192
"after Kamayani died.

1657
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:31,334
Knowing that...l wasn't
involved in Kamayani's murder.

1658
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:34,802
After Kamayani's
death my plan was foiled.

1659
02:00:35,528 --> 02:00:37,269
I didn't know where the money was"

1660
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:39,238
..nor did the Bhram Gang members.

1661
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:47,011
All they knew...that you
can track this money.

1662
02:00:47,373 --> 02:00:49,785
And I thought...to
salvage the situation"

1663
02:00:51,043 --> 02:00:52,681
..l need to find those 100 crores.

1664
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:54,747
I've worked really
hard for those 100 crores.

1665
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:57,561
I won't let go of it.

1666
02:01:00,486 --> 02:01:02,488
Don't give him the money,
he'll kill you.

1667
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:03,957
Shall I give it to you, Professor?

1668
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:05,868
Will you let me go?

1669
02:01:06,892 --> 02:01:09,270
You're the bigger fraud here.
- Yes, I am.

1670
02:01:10,863 --> 02:01:11,637
I had to be.

1671
02:01:12,665 --> 02:01:13,473
What could I do?

1672
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:18,211
What's the value of a
Harvard genius in this country?

1673
02:01:19,071 --> 02:01:19,811
Nothing.

1674
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:23,479
It still takes minutes
to download a video.

1675
02:01:23,709 --> 02:01:25,086
Politicians like Anwar Raja..

1676
02:01:25,144 --> 02:01:27,283
..have stashed away
millions and billions.

1677
02:01:27,813 --> 02:01:29,759
ls it fair? ls it?

1678
02:01:30,883 --> 02:01:32,123
Does that mean we steal it?

1679
02:01:33,886 --> 02:01:36,127
It's not wrong to steal from a thief.

1680
02:01:37,256 --> 02:01:38,530
They stole it from the people.

1681
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:40,626
The Professor shouldn't
get his hands on this money.

1682
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:43,997
Mickey, tell me where's the money.

1683
02:01:44,063 --> 02:01:45,337
Otherwise I will kill you.

1684
02:01:46,732 --> 02:01:48,871
If you give him the money,
I won't spare you.

1685
02:01:50,102 --> 02:01:51,308
Mickey, what's wrong?

1686
02:01:54,206 --> 02:01:55,480
You slimy virusl!

1687
02:01:56,776 --> 02:01:57,777
He's been recording our conversation"

1688
02:01:57,877 --> 02:01:59,083
..from behind that wallpaper.

1689
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:41,780
What now, Virus?

1690
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:44,210
Your tin-can's broken.

1691
02:04:47,913 --> 02:04:49,415
Are you going to come out afterl die?

1692
02:04:49,949 --> 02:04:51,019
Come out!

1693
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:54,962
Bhalla's here.

1694
02:04:55,254 --> 02:04:56,392
Bhalla.

1695
02:04:57,623 --> 02:04:58,863
Arrest him..
- Sir.

1696
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,770
I tried explaining you".

1697
02:05:00,826 --> 02:05:02,430
..but you could never
understand this virus.

1698
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:05,900
Sorry, Mickey. I've been
trying to come out for long.

1699
02:05:05,965 --> 02:05:08,036
But, so many bullets were fired here..

1700
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:10,774
...I'm allergic to gun-powder.
I start sneezing. Really.

1701
02:05:10,903 --> 02:05:12,109
Don't mind.

1702
02:05:14,206 --> 02:05:15,412
Sir. This Virus had already"

1703
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:17,613
"arranged for an anti-virus.

1704
02:05:19,411 --> 02:05:22,915
This program's being
telecasted live on Youtube.

1705
02:05:23,816 --> 02:05:26,092
I'm sure you must have got
half a dozen hits by now.

1706
02:05:26,285 --> 02:05:28,458
So, basically...you're sc""".

1707
02:05:29,255 --> 02:05:32,634
In Hindi, you're in a mess.

1708
02:05:32,925 --> 02:05:35,872
Sir, I went to arrest him.
At the girl's house.

1709
02:05:35,928 --> 02:05:38,238
So, you aren't involved in this game.

1710
02:05:39,331 --> 02:05:40,901
I'll give you a punch on your face.

1711
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:42,843
How dare you doubt me!

1712
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:44,876
I received a call from this girl.

1713
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:46,643
She wanted to tell me some secret.

1714
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:48,276
Then, she never called back.

1715
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,410
So, I also didn't take an interest.

1716
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:53,423
By the way, what are you up to?

1717
02:05:56,048 --> 02:05:56,958
Hello.

1718
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:01,354
Bhalla. You want to
know the game, right.

1719
02:06:02,021 --> 02:06:02,863
He said to me.

1720
02:06:02,955 --> 02:06:05,128
Give me one hour..
- I'll expose everything.

1721
02:06:06,792 --> 02:06:09,136
But, this is like
the scoop of the year!

1722
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:12,802
You know, Professor.

1723
02:06:14,433 --> 02:06:15,969
We slow-pokes are better than"

1724
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:18,311
..an internet virus like you.

1725
02:06:19,238 --> 02:06:20,581
What was the point of your education"

1726
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:21,913
..if you wanted to
be a thief in the end?

1727
02:06:23,208 --> 02:06:25,745
Remember, even Raavan lost his pride.

1728
02:06:31,283 --> 02:06:33,388
My son's a big fan of yours.

1729
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:40,093
He always says "A
real police officer.."

1730
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,433
"..should be like your ACP, not you".

1731
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:45,405
He doesn't want to be like me.

1732
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,946
And, I won't let him become like you.

1733
02:06:54,506 --> 02:06:56,042
Would you prefer to
sit up front or the back?

1734
02:07:20,499 --> 02:07:21,239
Mickey.

1735
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:23,837
Floppy, Panchomthey are"

1736
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,081
Mr. Bhalla.

1737
02:07:36,849 --> 02:07:38,328
Details of the <i>99</i> crores.

1738
02:07:39,918 --> 02:07:41,329
The root of this entire problem.

1739
02:07:44,089 --> 02:07:45,159
See you.

1740
02:07:49,528 --> 02:07:51,269
What is this 99, a lucky number?

1741
02:07:52,398 --> 02:07:54,571
I mean, sir could've
stolen 100 crores.

1742
02:07:54,633 --> 02:07:58,308
Why steal 99?
- I thought about it to, but..

1743
02:07:58,671 --> 02:07:59,479
then the bell rung?

1744
02:08:00,973 --> 02:08:02,077
Phone's ringing.

1745
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:04,077
One minute.

1746
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:05,819
Hello.

1747
02:08:05,878 --> 02:08:06,618
Yes, mom.

1748
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:09,223
Yes, mom. I kept lying to you.

1749
02:08:09,381 --> 02:08:10,485
lam telling you the
truth for the first time

1750
02:08:10,616 --> 02:08:11,924
I was stuck in a big mess.

1751
02:08:12,551 --> 02:08:14,053
But, I am out now. Yes.
- Fine.

1752
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,029
Bring gourd when you come home.

1753
02:08:17,389 --> 02:08:19,062
I'll make sweetmeat for you.

1754
02:08:19,725 --> 02:08:21,602
I just got out of a big mess..

1755
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:23,071
..and all you can
think about are gourds.

1756
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:25,097
Fine.

1757
02:08:26,732 --> 02:08:27,733
I'll get you 5 kilos extra.

1758
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:29,905
You can make sweet gourd
for the entire colony.

1759
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:36,950
By the way, Mr. Bhalla how
does it make a difference.

1760
02:08:37,976 --> 02:08:39,478
<i>W“ or BM!</i>

1761
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:42,618
And, like you say"

1762
02:08:43,515 --> 02:08:47,725
When a big vegetable is cut...
everyone gets a piece of it..

1763
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:56,564
"Oh Mickey Virus! Digital freak!"

1764
02:09:01,366 --> 02:09:03,642
Saurabh Varma Who do
you think you are?

1765
02:09:03,702 --> 02:09:06,080
You want me to act. I won't do it.

1766
02:09:06,138 --> 02:09:07,674
You can do anything you want.

1767
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:11,482
What do you see when
you buy a computer?

1768
02:09:11,643 --> 02:09:13,645
Forget it, Mr. Bhalla. There
are lot of technicalities.

1769
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:16,920
Like the graphic card,
what's the ram, how many GB's..

1770
02:09:16,982 --> 02:09:17,892
Forget it.

1771
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:19,724
I just bought a computer for my son.

1772
02:09:19,818 --> 02:09:22,230
I see. Which one?
- The black one.

1773
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:25,068
He was saying silver.

1774
02:09:25,457 --> 02:09:26,800
But my wife didn't agree.

1775
02:09:26,959 --> 02:09:29,098
The sofa in our room is brown.

1776
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:30,162
So are the walls.

1777
02:09:30,562 --> 02:09:32,200
So she said black
will match the colors.

1778
02:09:36,135 --> 02:09:37,170
What's this?

1779
02:09:39,705 --> 02:09:40,945
Mickey.
- Yes.

1780
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:43,620
Will you do a job for me?
- Will I have to move for it?

1781
02:09:43,709 --> 02:09:45,245
Yes.
- Then ask someone else.

1782
02:09:46,512 --> 02:09:49,083
Come on, lazybones. You
can't do a simple thing.

1783
02:09:49,181 --> 02:09:50,353
Just drive the scooter.

1784
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:51,519
Don't get so close.

1785
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,153
Why don't you buy a proper helmet?

1786
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:55,323
Why buy just half?

1787
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:56,932
Did you sell the other
half for a cup of tea?

1788
02:09:57,689 --> 02:09:58,827
I'm going flat broke because of you.

1789
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:00,164
My life's ruined.

1790
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:04,797
Listen. There's a
petrol pump up ahead.

1791
02:10:05,063 --> 02:10:06,565
Fill up 10 Rs of petrol.

1792
02:10:07,466 --> 02:10:10,072
My wife's a hacker too.

1793
02:10:10,569 --> 02:10:14,176
I'm always missing money
from my purse every other day.

1794
02:10:14,373 --> 02:10:16,785
The time your wife
takes to steal money..

1795
02:10:18,043 --> 02:10:20,489
"hackers can hack someone's account"

1796
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:22,652
..big secrets, sexual fantasies"

1797
02:10:23,348 --> 02:10:27,990
..and sc*"" someone's entire life.

1798
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:33,469
Sir. How can someone's
sexual fantasies get stolen?

1799
02:10:43,402 --> 02:10:46,645
He said give me an hour,
I'll expose everything.

1800
02:10:48,106 --> 02:10:50,552
But, this is like complete disclosure.

1801
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:54,047
Who's going to say what
happened to Anwar Raja?

1802
02:10:54,146 --> 02:10:56,092
Siddhant. Someone tell me.
