1
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:02,468
O Lord! My wife has been terribly 
upset because of her ailment.

2
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:04,797
Please make her recover soon.

3
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,419
O Lord! My husband is always 
so worried about my cancer.

4
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,519
Please relieve him of his anxiety.

5
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,698
Because of my mother's ailment,
 my father is always so tense.

6
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:31,076
If my mother recovers from her ailment, 
my father will be happy man too.

7
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,676
O Lord! Please cure my mother!

8
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,350
How are you?
- I am fine.

9
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,608
How're you feeling now?
- She's feeling fine.

10
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:49,477
 She has even he started to moving around now.

11
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,037
Yet she is so heartbroken.

12
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,437
Please advise her that God is great.

13
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,858
My friend is right.

14
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,058
Take this offering to God. 
I've prayed to God that you recover soon.

15
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,529
I've threatened God to treat you soon. Or else   
If not...

16
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,838
It's time to report for work.

17
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,238
You leave her at home and 
come to the factory directly.

18
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,138
I'll escort the children to school.
Go ahead.

19
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,500
Give me the ball.
- Accept your guilty First.

20
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,800
I won't. Why do you eat lunch
 here when we're playing?

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,300
When we eat lunch here,
 you should go and play elsewhere.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Will you give me the ball?

23
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,196
Two is always more powerfull than one.

24
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:57,045
Our duty hours are over.
Don't you want to return home?

25
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,245
I'm coming.
- You're so carefree.

26
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:03,591
You should know that my wife
must be anxiously waiting for my return.

27
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,691
She doesn't even eat food without me...

28
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,891
... while my son doesn't sleep till I return home.

29
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,788
Let's hurry up.
- I'm moving quite rapidly.

30
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:15,388
I am as eager to return home soon.
I've to tutor my son.

31
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,788
After my wife's death,
 I've became became very lazy.

32
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,140
When she was alive, I was always
 so anxious to return home.

33
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,769
Sometimes you used to rush home
durina working hours too!

34
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,469
Let's run like the earlier days

35
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,711
What did you do?

36
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:32,911
Fill it quickly

37
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:40,735
What is that?
- Get up!

38
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,418
Get lost from here. And remember, 
you haven't witnessed anything here.

39
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:48,318
Yes. Nothing we haven't seen anything here.

40
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:49,978
Let's go.

41
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,321
You cheats!

42
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:56,712
You're indulging in smuggling.
 You're cheating the company.

43
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:02,016
Kishen, I'll detain them here. You'd better
rush and telephone the manager.

44
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:04,598
Don't you move.
Or I'll shoot.

45
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,437
Sir, please come.

46
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,970
Look how they're cheating the company.

47
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:26,098
Our factory is famed for its clean reputation.

48
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,749
How dare you smear the company's image?

49
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:32,946
I see to it that you're severely punished.

50
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,046
I've informed the police.

51
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:43,715
You've been brave and courageous.
I'll ensure that you're promoted.

52
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:48,458
Now you need not stand at
the factory gate any longer.

53
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:01,065
Kishen has been despatched to the heaven.
You'll be confined to the prison.

54
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,509
You killed my close friend.

55
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:21,083
Please come. It was me who had telephoned you.

56
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:23,283
These are security officers of our factory.

57
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,183
They indulge in illegal activities.

58
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,863
He is lying.

59
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,642
The two of them quarrelled over something.

60
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:33,542
He shot dead his own friend.

61
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:35,942
It's he who has shot him.
He is lying.

62
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Arrest him.

63
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,030
I swear!

64
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,460
I didn't commit the murder.
This rascal has killed him.

65
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,660
I haven't killed my friend.

66
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,772
Why do you console him now?

67
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,672
Your father has orphaned him.
- No, it's a lie!

68
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:07,772
You explain to them. 
Can my father do such a deed?

69
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,399
You're lying. It's your father
who has killed my father.

70
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:13,584
Vijay, don't speak, like this.
After all, we're friends.

71
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,645
Which friendship do you speak of?

72
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,045
Wasn't your father
his father's friend too?

73
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,088
Do you want to kill him,
like your father killed his father?

74
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,779
Get lost from here.
You're a son of a killer.

75
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,954
Don't you dare call my father a killer!

76
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:29,425
I'll repeat a thousand times.
Your father is a killer.

77
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,019
Come out!

78
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,834
You scoundrel! You kicked him!
Come out!

79
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:55,968
What's the commotion about?

80
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:03,857
Michael please.Please come out. You've arrived
at your destination.

81
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,994
Did you see?
This is how one should talk.

82
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,627
You should talk to me respectfully.

83
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:19,827
With respect.

84
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,379
If you talk with courtesy,
Michael can even sacrifice his life for you.

85
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:32,765
Michael pretty! Shall I tell you something?
Don't feel offended by it.

86
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:37,548
Stop all your shady activities,
and lead a civilised and peaceful life.

87
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,326
By siding with the poor and destitute..

88
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:43,495
..why do you clash with the affluent?

89
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:48,548
Onkel, if you had not
addressed me so respectfully..

90
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:53,638
..I would've given you a fitting reply
which you would've always remembered.

91
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,872
Always keep the prison doors
open for my return.

92
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,789
I've fought for the poor,
and I shall continue to do so.

93
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,193
Michael has returned.

94
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,094
What? Michael has
returned from prison?

95
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,749
O Lord! You're very kind!

96
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,520
You've returned!
- Hello aunty! How're you?

97
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,420
I was coming to meet you.
I hope everything's fine.

98
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:19,019
Things are not how they should be.
After you were imprisoned..

99
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,698
..Jung Bahadur had come
here with his hoodlums..

100
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:25,418
..to evict us from this colony.
He's likely to return today.

101
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:31,009
Perhaps he doesn't know
how much I value this colony.

102
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,379
Whenever I felt chilly,
I received shelter here.

103
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:37,811
Whenever there was excessive heat,
I received shade here.

104
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,850
Whenever there was a heavy rainfall,
it shielded me from hardships.

105
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,820
I love this colony as much
as I would love my mother.

106
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,631
Don't you worry at all.

107
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:56,861
Michael, ever since you left,
we haven't eaten sumpuously.

108
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:02,168
Is it so? All right. I'll treat you
today. Let's go.

109
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,943
Do you have mutton biryani?
- Yes, of course.

110
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:06,508
Fetch me 5 mutton biryanis.

111
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:08,743
Prepare 5 mutton biryanis.

112
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,515
Listen to me.

113
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,859
Do you serve keema here?
- Of course.

114
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:18,555
In that case, serve me
5 plates of keema instead.

115
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:22,207
Prepare 5 plates keema.

116
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,755
Why did you stop serving paayas?

117
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:30,385
We do continue to serve paayas.
It's our special dish, you know.

118
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,663
Everybody in the community
has savoured our paayas.

119
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,618
Is that so?

120
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:40,281
In that case, serve me
5 plates of paavas please.

121
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,211
Prepare 5 plates Paayas.

122
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:48,596
Why don't ask your owner
to serve malai koftas too?

123
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,257
You seem to be ignorant.

124
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:54,672
If you eat our malai koftas,
you would visit us repeatedly.

125
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,359
In fact, whenever cops
come here to collect bribes..

126
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,457
..we serve them malai koftas,
and they go away happily.

127
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:05,054
In that case, serve me
5 plates of malai koftas.

128
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,281
Prepare 5 plates of malai koftas.

129
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,603
Delicious. Tasty. Well-cooked.
-Delicious. Tasty. Well-cooked.

130
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,011
It was very delicious.

131
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:26,292
You  enjoyed it. Didn't you?
Let's go home now.

132
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,676
Boys. Let's go.
- Here's the bill.

133
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:35,665
Bill? What's the bill for?
- It's for the malai koftas.

134
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,334
A bill for malai koftas?
- Yes.

135
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:41,842
But I'd ordered for malai koftas
in place of paayas. Didn't I?

136
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,758
Yes.
- Why don't you inform him?

137
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,328
Yes. He had ordered it
in place of paayas.

138
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,860
In that case, you may pay
for the paayas then.

139
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,302
Pay for the paayas?
- Yes.

140
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:53,085
But I'd ordered for paayas
in place of keema. Didn't I?

141
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:55,242
Yes.
- Why don't you inform him?

142
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,097
Yes. He had ordered it
in place of keemas.

143
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:58,738
In that case, you may pay
for the keemas.

144
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,739
You're just being too forceful.

145
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:04,683
I had ordered keema
in place of mutton biryanis.

146
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,388
Didn't I?
-Yes.

147
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,231
He had ordered it
in place of mutton biryanis.

148
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,261
In that case, you may pay
for the mutton biryanis.

149
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,044
Pay for the mutton biryanis.

150
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,070
Why're you trying to confuse me?
I didn't even eat mutton biryani.

151
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:19,206
Did I eat mutton biryani?
- No.

152
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,406
Why don't you inform him?
- No. He didn't eat mutton biryani.

153
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,100
Hey! If he didn't eat mutton biryani,
why've you billed him?

154
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
Why do you hassle customers
meaninglessly?

155
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,113
Please don't mind sir.
My employee has turnes insane.

156
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,602
Enjoy this lollipop.

157
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:32,698
Sir!

158
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,317
Why do you stammer?
Go and finish your work.

159
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,471
Please spare us.
I beg of you.

160
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,101
I pray. Please spare me.

161
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:56,728
You old swine! How can I let go
the property worth crores?

162
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:59,481
We'll give you a fitting reply.

163
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:04,008
We'll ensure that you fail
to evict us from this colony.

164
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:10,288
That's great, indeed!

165
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I'm the uncroved King of this area.
Don't you confront me?

166
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,219
Tell your hoodlums not to
understimate the power of law.

167
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,208
I care a damn for the law.

168
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,943
How dare you confront me?

169
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,538
How dare you confront me?

170
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:43,576
Don't ever dare to
confront me?

171
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:47,577
Get going.

172
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:53,508
Scoundrel.

173
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,753
Never try to outsmart me.

174
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:03,389
Driver! Demolish the colony.

175
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:57,472
Don't dare confront
my demolition machine.

176
00:14:58,345 --> 00:14:59,045
Teach him a lesson.

177
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,799
Don't you touch me.

178
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:03,347
Don't you touch me.

179
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:05,868
Don't you touch me.

180
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:16,145
You've damaged my eyes.

181
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:16,857
Brother! That beast hit me
very severely.

182
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,737
Don't spare him.
Don't have mercy on him.

183
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:21,976
He bashed me too hard.

184
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:26,636
Promise me!

185
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:30,176
Break his limbs to pieces.

186
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,019
Teach him a lesson
he wouldn't forget too easily.

187
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:36,449
Don't spare him.
Don't spare that dog.

188
00:18:15,603 --> 00:18:17,703
How do you feel now?

189
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,664
You hit my brother for the sake
of those petty destitutes?

190
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,647
You act like their messiah.

191
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,580
See the consequences for yourself.

192
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:30,795
Alongwith the hutment dwellers..

193
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,802
..I'll bury you too in that colony.

194
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:38,404
I have tremendous
respect for that colony.

195
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:42,362
I won't spare you if you cause
any damage to that colony.

196
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,800
You had better abandon
your uniform because..

197
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
..you tend to lick rich people's
asses after wearing the uniform.

198
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,325
Your lifestyle is indeed deporable.

199
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:55,019
Grab this scoundrel.

200
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:10,264
You're holding me diwn forcefully.
You can beat me as much as you like.

201
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:14,172
But remember that I won't spare you
the moment I get released from here.

202
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:16,895
As it is, both you brothers
had better retire for god.

203
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,488
Hit me as much as you like.

204
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,789
You had better drink water.

205
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,561
What's your name?

206
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:03,191
I don't know what my
parents named me.

207
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,938
But people call me Kaalia.

208
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:10,053
What's your crime?

209
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:12,502
If there was one,
I would've told you.

210
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,435
You can consider me
as one of your kind.

211
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:20,288
You offered me water.

212
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:25,007
I'll always remember
your kind favour.

213
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:34,807
How're you? When did
you return from prison?

214
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:36,611
I returned just now.

215
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,023
I'm coming straight from prison.

216
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:43,024
Father! Did you trace Michael?

217
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:46,635
I'm sorry D'Souza.

218
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:50,859
I searched him everywhere.
But I couldn't trace him.

219
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,179
Nothing has changed.

220
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,255
Everything is as it was.

221
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:03,788
It's only the course of my life
that has changed.

222
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:08,378
Everything has come to a standstill.

223
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,974
D'Souza, have patience

224
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,073
Forget the past.

225
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,474
Start your life afresh.

226
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:23,836
Father. Start my life afresh?

227
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,658
Life is not worth living now.
 Whom should I live for?

228
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,971
There are a lot of reasosns 
why you should live.

229
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,699
There's Vijay, your friend's son.

230
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,308
You worked hard in jail..

231
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:40,166
..and financed his education. 
You've see him succeed in life.

232
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:47,628
D'Souza! You've to pray for his well-being.

233
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,710
Father. Promise me that you'll never
 let Vijay know that..

234
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,410
..it was me who financed
 his education.

235
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:00,357
For how long?

236
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:07,568
Till Vijay comes to know the fact 
that Tuti Shah is the cause of ruin.

237
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,398
I made him an inspector
 for this very reason.

238
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,991
Now I'll keep him informed about
 Tuti Shah's activities..

239
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:20,477
..and ensure the ruin of Tuti Shah.

240
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,700
Inspector? There are very
 few medals on your uniform.

241
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,380
I want to see you
 progressing in your career.

242
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:39,254
Instead of knowing about me..

243
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,789
..you should know about the place 
where illicit liquor is manufactured.

244
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:48,951
That place is know as Pascal Wadi.

245
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:53,845
You'll come to know about
 their boss by yourself.

246
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:50,769
What's the name of
 your boss?

247
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,775
Even if you were a deaf,
 I would've made you speak.

248
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,458
What's his name?

249
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:20,024
You don't seem to value your life. 
Whereas I hate silence.

250
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,620
Tell me

251
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:28,162
Officers of your ilk are a
 stigma for the police force.

252
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:30,978
You bash up innocent people
 every other day.

253
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,443
Newspapeers carry reports 
of your atrocities.

254
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,830
I've to be answerable
 for your misdeeds.

255
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,483
But this criminal is not guiltless. 
I've caught him red-handed.

256
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:44,535
Until and unless a crime is proved in court..

257
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,640
..every criminal is 
considered as guiltless.

258
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,670
But..

259
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,975
How did this man getout?
 - He has been bailed out.

260
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,331
The minister has himself
 ordered his release.

261
00:28:57,257 --> 00:29:01,657
You'll have to pay dearly
 for antaginising me.

262
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:08,776
Leave him. Let him go.

263
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,763
He's a criminal. 
Don't let him go.

264
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:34,455
You may go.

265
00:29:37,962 --> 00:29:40,562
How dare you misbehave
 in my presence?

266
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:43,332
I hereby order your
 transfer to another place.

267
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,499
If you continue to behave like this..

268
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,190
..you wouldn't last
 for long in the police force.

269
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,172
How many of our men were killed?
 - Six.

270
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:32,952
I interfered and effected
 your release.

271
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:36,942
But he has only one source
 to succeed in linking me.

272
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,801
It's you.

273
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:43,354
I suppose it's high time
 that you're run out now.

274
00:30:43,904 --> 00:30:45,204
No, sir!

275
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:48,526
Please forgive me. 
I've little kids to fend for.

276
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:53,937
As it is, you're committing
 sins by working for me.

277
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
You should at least have done a 
good deed to the nation..

278
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:58,827
..by not giving birth
 to children.

279
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:03,887
However, I could possibly reverse
 my decision of killing you.

280
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,189
Do you see these two envelopes?

281
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:11,615
One contains life, while
 the other contains death.

282
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,249
Nobody knows which one contains life,
 and which one contains death.

283
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm keeping these envelope here.

284
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,250
My parrot will pick up
 one of these two envelopes.

285
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,500
After I see which envelope
 has been picked by the parrot..

286
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:29,959
..I'll arrive at a decision
 whether to kill you or spare you.

287
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:29,888
Greetings, sir.

288
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,817
Yes. 
- I'm a messenger for Tuti Shah.

289
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:37,108
Who's Tuti Shah?

290
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,900
Before you joined duty,
 didn't someone tell you about him?

291
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:45,317
Perhaps that's the reason why
 you turned his dens into cemeteries.

292
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:51,313
In cemeteries, one can still find men
 till the corpse is burnt to ashes.

293
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,299
I want to ensure that Tuti Shah's
 dens wear a totally deserted look.

294
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:58,377
Considering your dedication, 
Tuti Shah has sent you this gift.

295
00:32:59,126 --> 00:32:59,726
Very good.

296
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,026
What does it contain?
 Money?

297
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,790
Offering money has become
 out of vogue nowadays.

298
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,795
It contains something quite different
 and novel. Why don't you have a look?

299
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,540
It's very beautiful.

300
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:27,436
The amazing thing is that
 it runs, dances..

301
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,259
..it looks the other way, 
and it even closes its eyes.

302
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,773
One can make him do anything
 by winding the key.

303
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:38,309
The key to this toy is 
in the possession of Tuti Shah.

304
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,959
Hello.
- Good Morning Tuti Shah.

305
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,559
Who's speaking?
It's me. Inspector Vijay Sinha.

306
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:00,781
I liked your gift very much.

307
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,241
But you're a strange fellow.

308
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:06,362
On one hand, you alert me.
Yet you sleep carelessly.

309
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,887
I entered your house and handcuffed you.

310
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:12,961
Yet you never got to know about it.

311
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:17,772
Tutti Shah, I only wanted to make you realise that..

312
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:22,741
..I can reach any place any time.
 You'd better be on your guard.

313
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:27,981
Send your henchman to me.

314
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,572
I've the key which can unopen your handcuffs.

315
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:38,367
Sir! I wish to lodge a complaint.
- What about?

316
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:40,268
As soon as I came out of my house early morning..

317
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:43,252
What's so unusual about it?
- As soon as I boarded the bus..

318
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:46,262
What's so unusual about it?
- Let's me complete my statement.

319
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,881
As soon I inserted my hand in my pocket..

320
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:51,573
Are people expected to insert 
their hands in other people's pockets?

321
00:34:51,677 --> 00:34:53,377
Please hear my complete story.

322
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,039
Some rouge has pick - pocketed me!

323
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,390
All right. There"s a constable sitting over there.

324
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,123
You may lodge your complaint wit him.
I'm the same constable.

325
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:07,031
I've been pick-pocketed.

326
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:11,951
Oh! So it was you!
- Yes!

327
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,469
The pickpocket seems to
 be more efficient than you.

328
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,800
Let's do one thing.

329
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,639
You may send that pickpocket 
toreplace you at work.

330
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:24,317
How much money did you lose?
- 2000

331
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:26,049
Oh, I see! 2000

332
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,860
And what's your salary?
- 700.

333
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:32,725
700...2000

334
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,285
Your money went away in the same
manner as it reached you.

335
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:39,606
Where're you taking me?

336
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:41,922
I'm taking you to
 lock you behind bars?

337
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,148
Behind a lockup? I've been mistaken.
 Please forgive me.

338
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:48,107
I can forgive you on one condition.
- What is it?

339
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,303
You'll have to go and 
track down the pickpocket.

340
00:35:50,577 --> 00:35:52,477
It's not just one pickpocket.

341
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:55,273
How many of them are there?
-It's a gang of pickpockets.

342
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:58,059
A gang of pickpockets?
- Yes.

343
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:58,726
Take this money. It's 500 rupees.
- How can it be?

344
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,959
I've received less money,
 while he has received much more.

345
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:03,147
In crime, everybody should
 receive an equal share.

346
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:07,071
Can you not make do by drinking
 only a little liquor once in a while?

347
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,970
This body's father is sick.
He has to buy some medicines.

348
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:16,497
You scoundrel. Seems like you
 don't have any emotions.

349
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:24,018
Munna, Take this money. Remember to get your
sister's school uniform tailored.

350
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:29,719
You work the maximum.Yet you
take only a fraction of the boooty.

351
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:33,668
Why should I bother? After all,
 you're my only near and dear ones.

352
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:35,888
I've no father or mother.

353
00:41:36,884 --> 00:41:40,584
As long as I manage to pay
 my bills regularly..

354
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:44,846
..why should I bother?
- Run! Hurry up!

355
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,340
Where do you run off? You've received 
your share. So you're heading for it.

356
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,700
This chap will convert all his
 friends into alhocolics.

357
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,109
He won't mend his ways.

358
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:55,201
Seems like you've earned 
quite well today.

359
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,539
It's nothing much, really.

360
00:41:56,922 --> 00:42:01,722
It seems like people've stopped
carriyng big amounts these days.

361
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:04,283
I can see that you've made
 a lot of booty today.

362
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:06,199
Don't you cast your
 evil eye on my earnings!

363
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,801
You've received your share. So you'd 
better keep your mouth shut.

364
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:11,163
It's surprising that you got away
 by pickpocketing the constable.

365
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:15,356
I've the guts to pickpocket even
 the highest ranking police officers.

366
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,446
That constable was just a big idiot.

367
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:21,075
Hey! What's wrong with your voices?

368
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:24,864
Where do you run away?

369
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:29,104
Let's take her away.
- All right. Arrest me if you wish.

370
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:32,244
You can do little besides 
arresting me.

371
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:36,184
Have you ever asked a thief 
about her plight?

372
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,481
What's your plight?
- You had better go..

373
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:40,561
..and seek your answer from
 my mother's dead body.

374
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,599
She died a violent death
 a couple of hours ago.

375
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:46,641
What did you say?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,566
My mother was sick
 since the last five months.

377
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:58,032
There was no money for her treatment,
 nor for our livelihood.

378
00:42:59,298 --> 00:43:03,298
I've seen my mother suffering
 the agony every day.

379
00:43:04,735 --> 00:43:05,535
Today..

380
00:43:06,796 --> 00:43:08,296
..she passed away.

381
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:13,757
Today, I committed a theft to pay 
for her last rites..

382
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:16,008
..and I've been caught red-handed now.

383
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:24,213
As soon as I complete her last rites,
 I'll surrender myself to you.

384
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:25,431
Sister..

385
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:30,836
In your hour of need, my watch might 
be useful to you. Please accept it.

386
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:35,074
No. I don't want it.
-Please take it.

387
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,442
All right, sir.
- Constable!

388
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:41,198
Escort her home
 in our vehicle.

389
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,239
No. You don't have to
 take the trouble.

390
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:47,996
He'll drop you home.
- No, thank you. I'll manage on my own.

391
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:54,649
Constable..You have a generous heart.

392
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:59,422
A generous person had given me
 this watch as a..

393
00:43:59,455 --> 00:44:01,255
As a what?
I mean to say..

394
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:04,289
I'd received it as a gift.
She needed it much more than me.

395
00:44:06,985 --> 00:44:09,585
I should've helped her
 by giving something.

396
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,700
Yes. You indeed should help her.
- Give her some money.

397
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:14,599
Hey! Where's my wallet?

398
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,880
A wallet! A watch!
 She's swindled both of us!

399
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:25,081
First she feigned her mother's death.
Now she's duped you of your wallet.

400
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,313
I wonder to what extent would she go!

401
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:29,743
I'll not spare her!

402
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:34,192
Let's go.
- Hey! She has my watch!

403
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:11,084
Bakshi Jung Bahadur has burned down
 the colony and fulfilled his goal.

404
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,340
He has been too cruel.

405
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,820
He has converted a colony brimming 
with life into a cemetery.

406
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:24,516
I want to introduce you to a person..

407
00:45:25,738 --> 00:45:29,438
..who's a sworn enemy of both
 Dharamdas and Bakshi.

408
00:45:30,073 --> 00:45:32,673
His name is Tuti Shah.

409
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:42,714
He's Tuti shah.

410
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:55,857
I've also suffered several 
atrocities inflicted on me..

411
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:57,305
..by Bakshi and his brother Dharamdas.

412
00:45:57,941 --> 00:46:00,441
Bakshi took advantage of his
 being a police officer..

413
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:02,751
..and looted his goods worth crores.

414
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,961
But considering the losses incurred 
by the residents of this colony..

415
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:06,937
..I find my losses negligible.

416
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:10,249
I can recover my losses easily. 
But how'll these poor people manage?

417
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,690
Where'll these helpless people go, 
with their kids in tow?

418
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,627
The almighty has destined poverty
 for these poor chaps.

419
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,499
But Bakshi is responsible for making
 their lives a living hell.

420
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:34,504
The aged will die in agony.
 The kids will have to beg on the streets..

421
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:37,078
..while the young girls will have to..

422
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,605
Bakshi will pave his path of prosperity..

423
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:42,935
..by subjecting these poor people
 to unimaginable torture.

424
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:47,667
I believe that you consider the colony
 to be your mother.

425
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:55,713
A mother who has a brave son like you,
 shouldn't have to worry about enemies.

426
00:54:17,278 --> 00:54:21,378
No. Please don't..
- That colony was my mother.

427
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:24,731
I've been deafened by
 hearing its screams of pain.

428
00:54:25,564 --> 00:54:28,964
I've been blinded by
 witnessing its destruction.

429
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:34,221
I've turned heartless after
 having experienced its sufferings.

430
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:38,290
I'm not a human being anymore.
 I've become death now.

431
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:41,796
You're my first victim.

432
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:47,547
No.

433
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:53,329
No.

434
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:05,888
I cannot..

435
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:10,975
I cannot anything.

436
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:14,623
I cannot see anything.

437
00:57:16,383 --> 00:57:17,883
I cannot see anything.

438
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:22,012
I cannot see anything.
Why're you so quiet?

439
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:25,012
Why don't you speak something?

440
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,925
I cannot see anything.

441
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:32,009
I cannot see anything.

442
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:52,774
Issue a press release that..

443
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:57,103
..that Tuti Shah's men were killed
 in a police encounter.

444
00:57:59,982 --> 00:58:02,082
Dharamdas has taken advantage
 of his being a cop..

445
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:04,632
..in seeking revenge 
of his brother's death.

446
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:08,945
He has done the first
 commendable job of his lifetime.

447
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:12,751
Where can I find Michael?

448
01:01:32,413 --> 01:01:35,513
No...no!

449
01:01:36,495 --> 01:01:39,295
Listen of me.

450
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,297
They've gone.

451
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:46,588
I'm your friend.
I'm not your enemy.

452
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:49,859
Have trust me.

453
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:52,045
I'll drop you home.

454
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:55,266
They've alredy left.

455
01:01:56,018 --> 01:01:59,018
They've left.

456
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:02,709
Don't worry. They've left.

457
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,725
I'm alone in this world.

458
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,664
I lost my parents when I was only a kid.

459
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:16,382
But they taught me the value
of leading an honourable life.

460
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:20,763
I was managing my livelihood by
performing in hotel and the stage.

461
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:23,626
I was leading a comfortable life.

462
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:27,014
But I wonder who cast
 an evil eye on me?

463
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:31,854
A demon's devilish deed resulted in
 a lifetime of blindness for me.

464
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:44,473
Please come in. Please be seated.
I'll make cofee for you.

465
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:46,726
No, thank you. Please do not
 trouble yourself.

466
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:48,293
Trouble?

467
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:52,281
My biggest trouble in life is 
that I cannot see anything.

468
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:55,797
There is nothing more
 troublesome for me.

469
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,521
You've asked me everything about me.

470
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,713
But you haven't told me anything about you.

471
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,939
I'm also alone in this world.
Just like you are.

472
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:38,765
Maria. Please treat me as your
 friend and well-wisher.

473
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:43,211
And never consider yourself 
as a helpless person.

474
01:03:44,356 --> 01:03:46,356
Good night!
- Good night!

475
01:03:51,308 --> 01:03:53,208
I was leading komfortable life.

476
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,837
But I wonder who cast
 an evil eye on me?

477
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,580
A demon's devilish deed resulted in
 a lifetime of blindness for me.

478
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,240
..a lifetime of blindenss for me.

479
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:06,726
My biggest trouble in life is
 that I cannot see anything.

480
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:09,794
..that I cannot see anything.

481
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:52,017
You're grief-stricken.

482
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,158
Because are responsible
 for Maria losing her eyesight?

483
01:04:59,306 --> 01:05:00,506
She could be cured by surgery.

484
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:03,771
But you'll need money for surgery.

485
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:06,751
You can receive money, of course..

486
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,890
After you kill Dharamdas.

487
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:13,746
Yes. His name is Dharamdas,
 meaning a follower of righteousness.

488
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,596
But all his activities are all sinful and criminal.

489
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:21,043
The punishment for committing one
 murder is death by hangig..

490
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:25,086
..and for committing another murder too, 
one can be punished only once.

491
01:05:26,812 --> 01:05:28,312
Give it a thought.

492
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:34,855
If you want to cure Maria's eyes, 
there is no other alternative.

493
01:06:47,484 --> 01:06:49,584
His shirt and trousers are both uniform colours.

494
01:06:50,054 --> 01:06:53,854
Gosh! This is a cop's house. 
I'm in for trouble.

495
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:24,753
Would you please come out?

496
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:30,340
 Please! Please come.

497
01:07:33,128 --> 01:07:34,628
After you left the other day..

498
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,284
..when I searched my pocket, it was empty.

499
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:43,241
So it would be pointless to ask you
 the purpose of your visit.

500
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,607
Actually, I've come to meet you.
- You've come to meet me?

501
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:49,483
Through the window?
Why do you want to meet me?

502
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:55,962
It so happened that the moment
 I saw you, I fell in love with you.

503
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:57,151
You've fallen in love with me!

504
01:07:58,104 --> 01:08:00,804
Sir, I've encountered many
 lewd and indecent men.

505
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:04,171
But you're first person
 who has been so generous.

506
01:08:05,074 --> 01:08:09,274
Ever since I lost my wallet,
 I've terminates my generosity.

507
01:08:10,857 --> 01:08:13,457
Please pardon me.

508
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,457
Please try to understand my helplessness.

509
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:19,362
My mother is very ill.
- Your mother is ill?

510
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:22,452
The other day, your mother
 had died. Today she is ill?

511
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,330
How many mothers do you have?

512
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:26,785
Did my mother die the other day?
- Yes.

513
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,519
I've blundered. I should've
 killed somebody else today.

514
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:33,146
It doesn't matter. 
I'm leaving now.

515
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,860
Now whether it's your mother or your
 father who might be on the death-bed..

516
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:43,018
..I won't let you go now?
Let's go to the police station.

517
01:13:17,571 --> 01:13:18,371
Tell me.

518
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:22,071
How should I tell you?
How should I explain?

519
01:13:22,258 --> 01:13:27,758
Small kids have taken me for a jolly ride.

520
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:31,025
They undressed me, and made good their escape.

521
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:33,568
I'm yet to recover from the shock.

522
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:39,479
Do you suspect anybody?
- No, sir. Everybody has escaped.

523
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:42,803
All right. There's a constable
 sitting in the chair over there.

524
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:44,886
Go to him and lodge your complaint.

525
01:13:46,084 --> 01:13:48,684
Please turn in this direction.

526
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,607
I'm the same constable
 you're referring to.

527
01:13:52,617 --> 01:13:56,517
It's you.
- It's me. It's me. It's me.

528
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:59,125
Small children relieved you
 of your uniform.

529
01:13:59,382 --> 01:14:02,082
Small children did it?
- Yes.

530
01:14:02,162 --> 01:14:04,562
And you were helpless? 
- Yes. I was helpless.

531
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:05,948
I couldn't do anything about it.

532
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:08,714
What surprises me is that
 how did they manage to undress you?

533
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:11,743
That is the crux of the matter.

534
01:14:11,938 --> 01:14:16,838
The kids told me that there's
 a mole on my posterior.

535
01:14:17,014 --> 01:14:18,714
They were eager to place
 a bet of 500 in this issue.

536
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:22,733
I agreed to the bet.

537
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,916
I showed them my posterior.

538
01:14:25,355 --> 01:14:27,455
Did they find a mole?
- How could they?

539
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:29,192
I didn't have any mole since my birth.

540
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:30,930
That was the reason
 why I agreed to the bet.

541
01:14:31,108 --> 01:14:33,308
Did they give you the money?
- No. They did not.

542
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,716
On the contrary, they ran away with my uniform.

543
01:14:35,827 --> 01:14:40,127
I've braved through crowds and the cold..

544
01:14:40,228 --> 01:14:45,228
..and managed to reach here somehow. 
Give me a blanket, please.

545
01:14:47,408 --> 01:14:49,608
I've never come across a constable like you.

546
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,610
You'd better get lost from here.

547
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,796
And show me your face only when
 you're dressed in your uniform.

548
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:57,443
Uniform? Where should I get a uniform?

549
01:14:57,483 --> 01:14:59,883
Get it from wherever you like.
- Yes! I know now.

550
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,280
I'll hunt for an uniform
 at the thieves market.

551
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:05,606
It's know as a thieve's market,
 but the goods aren't robbed ones.

552
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:09,545
We bring it with honour, earn our 
own bread, and eat food gracefully.

553
01:15:09,674 --> 01:15:13,374
Make your pick. It costs only 25 rupees.

554
01:15:13,582 --> 01:15:15,882
It's spotless and stainless.

555
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,990
There's not a tear, neither is it darned.

556
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:20,970
It you wear it, you'll feel as if 
you're wearing a new garment.

557
01:15:21,276 --> 01:15:25,076
Buy it. It costs 25 rupees only.

558
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:29,367
A cops uniform is being auctioned 
in the thieve's market.

559
01:15:29,599 --> 01:15:31,399
That too for a petty 25 rupees!

560
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:33,739
The police should hang their heads in shame.

561
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:36,577
Thieve's market. Here I come.

562
01:15:38,988 --> 01:15:41,988
Sir! It's you!
- Yes. It's me.

563
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:45,015
Her reaction proves that 
the uniform belongs to me.

564
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,790
My uniform is being auctioned for a mere 25 rupees?

565
01:15:47,945 --> 01:15:49,645
You should've auctioned it for a 1000 rupees at least.

566
01:15:50,097 --> 01:15:54,197
But what're doing 
in this thieves' market?

567
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:58,619
To show you my heart,
 and take you to the prison.

568
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:02,346
Where did she go?

569
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:10,033
Where has she disappeared?

570
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,300
You've changed your shoes,
You've changed your trousers.

571
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:22,884
Hey! The face has changed.

572
01:16:23,285 --> 01:16:26,485
Did you see any girl around?
- No.

573
01:16:26,884 --> 01:16:29,684
Are you blind? Didn't you see a girl passing by?

574
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:32,561
You baldy!

575
01:16:33,513 --> 01:16:36,413
In this deep jungle, in this solitude...

576
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:40,278
..what're you up to?

577
01:16:44,406 --> 01:16:47,606
It smells quite good. Hey! I'm a coop. No. I'm a beggar.

578
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,069
I'm insane.
I'm a Romeo.

579
01:16:49,299 --> 01:16:53,299
It's entered my nose
I've had it.

580
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:55,799
Do not shoot.

581
01:16:59,006 --> 01:17:00,406
Do not... shoot.

582
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:10,819
Michael will kill Dharamdas.
You had better kill Michael.

583
01:17:11,263 --> 01:17:17,263
It's my practice to eliminate 
all evidence after every murder.

584
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:19,781
Go!

585
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,831
Quickly! Take him to the hospital!

586
01:22:31,043 --> 01:22:34,643
Make way for me!
Move sidewavs!

587
01:22:42,267 --> 01:22:44,067
Take her for treatment! Be quick!

588
01:23:19,933 --> 01:23:21,933
Thank God! She is out of danger.

589
01:24:57,267 --> 01:25:01,167
The police is hunting for me.
And I want to hide here.

590
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:06,551
The cop may want to search the house.
But you Won't let him do so.

591
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:10,536
Remember! My revolver 
still has two bullets left inside.

592
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:18,597
What's the matter?

593
01:25:19,397 --> 01:25:23,597
A killer has escaped from the police.
I suspect he's hiding somewhere here.

594
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:26,989
Nobody has come here. All my doors
have been securely fastened.

595
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:32,111
Seems like I've heard your voice earlier.

596
01:25:33,364 --> 01:25:36,864
Now don't you say that
 you've even seen me somewhere!

597
01:25:38,498 --> 01:25:40,198
To tell you frankly, I do feel
 that I've seen you earlier.

598
01:25:48,718 --> 01:25:50,118
Who's bloody this?

599
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:56,424
I ask you! Who's bloody is this?

600
01:25:58,224 --> 01:26:01,124
That blood is mine.

601
01:26:02,502 --> 01:26:07,102
Look here! I cut my palm
 while cutting vegetable.

602
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:11,781
You'd better put a bandage on it.

603
01:26:20,723 --> 01:26:23,223
You may come out. 
The cop has alredy left.

604
01:26:28,578 --> 01:26:33,478
To save me, you wounded yourself?

605
01:26:34,513 --> 01:26:36,713
Don't worry about my wounds.

606
01:26:37,589 --> 01:26:40,789
You'd better worry about
 dressing your wounds.

607
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:46,403
It's very difficult to 
dress my wounds now.

608
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:04,657
Michael escaped me this time.
But we can finish him anytime later.

609
01:27:05,344 --> 01:27:08,544
He's from our profession.
He cannot escape us.

610
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:15,733
But my parrot has ordered to kill
 the girl who overheard me.

611
01:27:16,394 --> 01:27:18,494
We're so powerful.

612
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:21,150
How can an ordinary girl
 like her harm us?

613
01:27:29,431 --> 01:27:30,731
My first slap..

614
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:33,339
I don't seek your advice.

615
01:27:35,053 --> 01:27:36,353
The second slap..

616
01:27:36,997 --> 01:27:40,197
You dared tospeak against
 my parrot's decision.

617
01:27:40,351 --> 01:27:41,851
The third slap..

618
01:27:42,278 --> 01:27:44,878
You called her an ordinary girl.

619
01:27:45,271 --> 01:27:47,471
Even a match-stick is considered to be ordinary.

620
01:27:48,087 --> 01:27:52,687
But that ordinary match-stick is
strong enough to burn the world.

621
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:54,982
It's my record.

622
01:27:55,466 --> 01:28:01,166
My slaps can be erased from the cheeks, 
but not from the mind.

623
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:04,632
Go and kill that girl.

624
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,310
Everyone! Get out!

625
01:28:44,501 --> 01:28:45,401
Leave me!

626
01:28:48,729 --> 01:28:50,029
Leave me!

627
01:28:54,653 --> 01:28:56,153
Leave my path!

628
01:28:56,571 --> 01:28:59,771
You leave the girl first.
- I tell you! Leave my path!

629
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:01,388
I tell you! leave the girl!

630
01:29:04,528 --> 01:29:06,528
Seems like you want to leave the world.

631
01:29:07,797 --> 01:29:09,397
That's why you don't want to leave my path.

632
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,410
You seem to have an active mind!

633
01:29:11,225 --> 01:29:14,825
But what use is an active mind?
Why don't you so something about it?

634
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,099
Shall I?

635
01:29:23,766 --> 01:29:24,966
Hit him.

636
01:30:13,309 --> 01:30:14,009
He's dead and gone.

637
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:37,239
Who were they?
- I don't know.

638
01:30:37,782 --> 01:30:40,882
There were saying that this girl 
has heard it all. Kill her.

639
01:30:42,853 --> 01:30:45,153
It means that your life is in danger.

640
01:30:46,606 --> 01:30:47,506
Let's do one thing.

641
01:30:48,267 --> 01:30:50,267
You come and stay at my home.
- But sir..

642
01:30:50,961 --> 01:30:54,861
Don't you stay alone?
- So what? It's better.

643
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:58,423
What did you say?
- Yes. You're alone. I'm alone.

644
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:01,059
If we stay together, we would
 eliminate our loneliness.

645
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:02,545
Come with me.

646
01:31:05,806 --> 01:31:05,806
Let's go.
