1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,530
Hey Nandu! Why are you smoking 
in front of the hospital?

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,066
My wife is sick. 
She has gone in for a check-up.

3
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,590
What happened to her?

4
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:15,860
The usual gynecological problems. 
- Gynecological problem?

5
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:17,881
The treatment is so expensive.. 
- How much did this cigarette cost?

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,212
10 rupees. 
- 10 rupees!

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,666
How many cigarettes are you 
carrying with you? - One more.

8
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,482
You're ready to spend 
after something that can kill you..

9
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:28,293
..but you can't afford 
to save your wife's life.

10
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:29,946
What nonsense!

11
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:33,384
Look! Smoking kills.

12
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:36,032
But, this sanitary pad can save a life.

13
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,313
Don't laugh.

14
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,410
At the price of two cigarettes 
you can buy this sanitary pad..

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,745
..that'll save your wife from 
the gynecological problems caused..

16
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,610
..due to the use of dirty cloth 
during menstruation.

17
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:49,945
Quit smoking to avoid 
chances of a fatal disease.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,297
You can save two lives with the money 
you're spending in buying fatal cigarettes.

19
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:55,123
One yours and the other your wife's.

20
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:56,940
Give it a thought and then laugh.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,599
Smoking doesn't make you a hero.

22
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:03,156
Buying this makes you one.

23
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,848
Hi, Preeti!

24
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:25,326
Hello!

25
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,174
Good morning, Mr. Swamy.

26
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,552
Mr. Guruswamy, good morning I say.

27
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:41,385
Mr. Guruswamy! 
Good morning, sir.

28
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:45,555
Hey, don't disturb the system. 
If it reboots, I will give you boot shots.

29
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:50,926
Our boss keeps saying that there is 
no computer expert as good as you.

30
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,721
They say that you search the mouse 
in the laptop..

31
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,255
..so well that you surpass even a cat.

32
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:58,805
He is irritated.

33
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:02,010
It was not me, boss said that. 
- Get lost, you bugger!

34
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,854
Even you are not understanding 
my situation and feelings.

35
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,597
Darn these situation and feelings!

36
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:11,468
You bought a new house, a car 
and your wedding is fixed too.

37
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:16,218
Our stubborn boss 
has approved a month's leave for you..

38
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:20,546
..then what the heck are the feelings 
and situations you are talking about?

39
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:25,779
Pal, I am not interested 
in getting married to that rural girl..

40
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,055
..who has such low mentality.

41
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:32,968
By the way, what's not good about her, 
her beauty or her behaviour?

42
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,468
I don't know all that, 
I saw her many years before.

43
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,773
But she doesn't have parents. 
- Hey!

44
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,347
Are you serious? 
How did she take birth then?

45
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,425
Is she a test-tube baby?

46
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,722
Hey, test-tube babies are awesome. 
Please listen to me.

47
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,302
A girl like her is 
not a good match for me, pal.

48
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,378
I need a posh girl. 
- Oh, I see.

49
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,302
I am a white collar worker, 
whereas she is a torn sari woman.

50
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,593
The pair would be so bad, right?

51
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,315
My mom is not at all understanding 
my situation and feelings.

52
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,468
I can use this excuse 
to get him pay for my drinks.

53
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:09,927
Mr. Guruswamy, this is not 
an ordinary issue, this is quite serious.

54
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:15,472
So, there is a suitable place 
to discuss this at BAR.

55
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:19,510
Let's go there in the evening 
and discuss this properly, what do you say?

56
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,010
Hey! 
- Still, I have a doubt.

57
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,843
This virtual girl... 
who is she according to you?

58
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,343
UI Team Anusha.. 
- Oh, I see..

59
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:34,040
(Gasps)

60
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,343
Anusha?

61
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:43,359
Oh, shucks!

62
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,427
I was going to say that 
it would be good if the girl is like her.

63
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,593
Like her?

64
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:57,010
You mean, a girl like her? 
Like Anusha?

65
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:01,722
Hey, you will get 
Blood Pressure free with Diabetes.

66
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,180
You will get arrogance free with beauty 
if you want a girl like her.

67
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:11,760
God has created Anusha by mixing arrogance, 
attitude and superiority complex.

68
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,722
Pal, she is like a fire-bomb.

69
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,763
I am so sorry, ma'am. 
- You rascal! - (Slaps)

70
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,093
Here you go, live example.

71
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,430
Pal, maybe she took birth 
as a Celestial nymph.

72
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,302
I don't know much about it, 
but I am sure about one thing.

73
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,362
Listen to me..

74
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,247
..she is not a good match for you. 
- Hi, Swamy. Good morning.

75
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,115
(Humming)

76
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,930
"Come on, girl.." 
- (Laughs)

77
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,347
Hello! 
- (Laughs)

78
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,552
Hello!

79
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:41,218
Hi, guys!

80
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,552
Good morning.

81
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,796
We are gaining huge profits 
and are really getting lucky day the day.

82
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,963
All that is because 
of your hard work.

83
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:54,049
If there are dedicated workers like you, 
the company will progress very fast.

84
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,174
The company has grown, 
and of course, your salaries also.

85
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,119
So, congratulations!

86
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,025
(Applause)

87
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,796
Beyond that, 
I have one good news for you.

88
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,046
Congratulations, Anu!

89
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:06,879
You have bought Lawrence 
to our office.

90
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,296
You should lead 
the back-end team, okay? - Thank you.

91
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:11,799
Yeah!

92
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,508
(Applause)

93
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,546
Hey, Swamy!

94
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,674
She will be a Team Leader. 
Please share your thoughts with her.

95
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,588
Did you get it? 
- Enjoy your work!

96
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,468
Work hard and party harder.

97
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:23,508
(Laughs)

98
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,546
Anu, meet me in the cabin.

99
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:32,169
Congratulations! Very good! 
- Thank you.

100
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,444
Congrats. 
- Thank you.

101
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:36,088
Congratulations! 
- Thank you.

102
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,629
Anu, you don't have to worry about 
the new team and the new work.

103
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:46,004
Swamy will be very helpful 
to you in the new team.

104
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:52,924
In fact, Swamy deserved 
this promotion more..

105
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:55,004
..I recommended you, you know?

106
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:02,046
The mind asked me not to, 
but my heart said, go ahead.

107
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,108
Anu, I will keep 
giving you promotions.

108
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,296
I will keep changing your teams..

109
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,671
..and to my cabin.

110
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:17,213
My cabin to my house, 
my house to my bedroom.

111
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,546
Sleeping alone on a double-bed 
and thinking about you..

112
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:28,220
..is really hard, you know?

113
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:30,338
What do you mean?

114
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,921
You know what I mean.

115
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,525
Like a crocodile 
who is so powerful in the water..

116
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,588
..that it can even pull 
an elephant into the water.

117
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:44,589
Don't consider me weak, 
I am terribly strong in the bed.

118
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:50,921
You know, I don't believe 
in this marriage and all.

119
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:57,707
Everything about it 
is so irritating and disgusting.

120
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,049
It doesn't make sense.

121
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,963
In a room, 
if our minds match..

122
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,463
..we can keep rewinding it and be happy.

123
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:11,546
Just once, Anu.

124
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:15,421
I will take care of your status 
and promotions after that.

125
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,838
You bloody scoundrel! 
You think I am a bitch?

126
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:22,091
Did you think you can take undue advantage 
of me just because I am an orphan?

127
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,171
I have seen many like you.

128
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,879
Hell with your job 
and hell with your promotion!

129
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,716
Do you know what will happen if I complain 
to the Sexual Harassment Wing?

130
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,588
Hey, relax!

131
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:41,463
Why are you overreacting?

132
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:45,421
I just asked what I wanted. 
If you are not interested, no issues.

133
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,421
I didn't force you, right?

134
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,213
Don't mix it up with your promotion.

135
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:56,171
Many girls wait for such promotions 
and you deserve this.

136
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:57,463
Please take it.

137
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:01,504
Excuse me, I am not that kind of a girl.

138
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,004
Anu! 
Once again, congratulations!

139
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:07,341
Let us end it here.

140
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:07,909
(Scoffs)

141
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:56,072
(Music)

142
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:01,351
"Oh, my God.."

143
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:06,133
"I better die.."

144
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:11,226
"Without her, I have no life.."

145
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:16,041
"Please understand my pain.."

146
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,976
"I followed her till eternity, 
she never looked back.."

147
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:25,719
"I called her like it was my duty, 
she never answered.."

148
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,736
"Oh, my God.."

149
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:35,399
"I better die.."

150
00:12:35,968 --> 00:13:11,059
(Music)

151
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,271
"You entered my life 
like the sunrise.."

152
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:22,238
"You are the heroine 
for my life story.."

153
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,340
"Your steps are like dance moves, 
your bangles rhythm is like music.."

154
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:32,081
"Your words are like a music, 
sing it in my ears.."

155
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:36,791
"Be the dance or trance, 
take my heart away.."

156
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:41,762
"Oh, my God.."

157
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,735
"I better die.."

158
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,482
"Without her, I have no life.."

159
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:56,909
"Please understand my pain.."

160
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:01,135
Just tell me once, I can even carry 
a Shiv Linga for you like Bahubali did.

161
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,126
Really!

162
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:08,126
Stupid! I don't want a guy 
who carries a Shiv Linga in Bahubali movie.

163
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:14,667
I want a husband who carries the groceries 
home in the beginning of the month.

164
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:16,075
Nonsense!

165
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,822
"I feel like I have failed 
for the first time.."

166
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:30,792
"Like the red signal in the traffic.."

167
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:35,911
"Like the answer 
that never flashes during the exam.."

168
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:40,693
"Like an ad in the FM, 
why do you need so many breaks?"

169
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:46,336
"How do I tell her 
how much I love her?"

170
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:55,298
"Oh, my God.."

171
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:00,181
"I better die.."

172
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,225
"Without her, I have no life.."

173
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:10,019
"Please understand my pain.."

174
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:15,086
"I followed her till eternity, 
she never looked back.."

175
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:19,738
"I called her like it was my duty, 
she never answered.."

176
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:24,746
"Oh, my God.."

177
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:30,248
"I better die.."

178
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,501
Hey, girl with an attitude!

179
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:46,001
Do you consider yourself 
a Celestial nymph?

180
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,584
You are just an average girl, 
you can never get a better guy than me.

181
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,921
I have been requesting you 
every single day since two years..

182
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,167
..but you are consistently rejecting me.

183
00:15:56,084 --> 00:16:00,084
Understand one thing, 
no one will try to woo you.

184
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,917
My father is an MLA.

185
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:06,212
Just wait and watch, I will get married to 
a girl a hundred times better than you..

186
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,629
..and bring my child 
on a walk in this very road..

187
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:12,750
..but you will still be walking 
wearing the same old bag..

188
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,917
..then you will realise my value.

189
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:21,795
I will kill you!

190
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,542
Idiot, when did I say 
that I don't like you?

191
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,750
First of all, stop this same old drama..

192
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,223
..and say something to make me happy.

193
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,273
Okay, listen to me now then.

194
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,815
I am a graduate in Hotel Management. 
- What?

195
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:40,731
Did you think I was a spoilt brat 
just because my father is an MLA?

196
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:44,485
I am running a hotel in partnership 
with my friend, Prashanth.

197
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,690
I am busy with that business.

198
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,731
Are you serious? 
Are you into hotel business? - Yes.

199
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:54,568
Okay, tell your parents about me.

200
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,315
First, get married to me. 
Then we will see the rest.

201
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,690
Thank God!

202
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:03,565
We boys only pretend to be fast, 
but are very slow..

203
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,523
..whereas why do you girls pretend 
to be slow when you are so fast?

204
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,690
My mom has already agreed..

205
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:14,815
but convincing dad is a bit difficult.

206
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,758
When someone wants to give you boot shots, 
it is wrong to buy them a new pair.

207
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,190
I don't want all those excuses, 
that's your problem.

208
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,456
By the way, I will visit 
your hotel tomorrow.

209
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:37,683
You are cheating, sir.

210
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:39,818
You showed me that house, 
but are handing me over this house now.

211
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,677
It's not like that, 
the other customer processed it faster.

212
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,742
So, I could not allot you that house. 
I am so sorry, sir.

213
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:50,142
But I wanted that house, sir. 
- This house is good too, sir.

214
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:54,131
Sir, there is a lot of difference 
between the two houses.

215
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,485
Actually, it is the son of an MLA 
who has bought that house.

216
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,276
He came with a recommendation, 
so we couldn't do anything about it.

217
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:00,398
Sorry, sir.

218
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,440
Have you explained it to him? 
- Yes, sir. I have.

219
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:25,940
No one should drive faster 
than 10kmph in this road.

220
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,648
No one should use 
this road unnecessarily.

221
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:34,731
No one should enjoy the loud music 
in a car or a house.

222
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,898
Understood?

223
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,940
Good morning, Partha sir!

224
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:54,606
Hello, ma'am.

225
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,106
Sir..

226
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:07,148
Nice!

227
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,898
Good!

228
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,981
He is Prashanth!

229
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,443
Hello!

230
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,686
We pursued Hotel Management together..

231
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:18,485
..he used my help to pass in the exams. 
- Oh, really? - (Laughs)

232
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:19,690
I will order coffee or tea later.

233
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,523
He is my best friend.

234
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:23,773
Hi!

235
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,398
So, I made him a partner 
in this hotel business. - A partner?

236
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:31,398
He feels bad if I call him a partner, 
I should address him as a brother.

237
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,648
Brother? 
Okay, done.

238
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,981
I am the Boss, 
but he frames the conditions.

239
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,651
He minds it if I call him a brother, 
I should call him a brother in Kannada.

240
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:43,776
Am I right? 
- Brother, may I know who she is?

241
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:47,151
Hey, Rascal Rawalpindi! 
Is this how you work?

242
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,523
Don't you know who she is?

243
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,315
She is Anusha, the great queen 
of Jayanagar 4th Block.

244
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:55,151
Oh, so she is the one! 
- Yes.

245
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:57,440
Okay! Welcome to our hotel, ma'am. 
- Thanks.

246
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,898
Can I look around Partha's hotel?

247
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:04,255
Partha's hotel? 
- Don't give too many reactions, idiot.

248
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,481
It's not scripted, 
try to understand.

249
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,856
Actually, he is not too fond 
of this hotel word.

250
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:12,440
We should say it as restaurant. 
- Oh, I see.

251
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,773
There is nothing to look around. 
All you have is four walls, a kitchen..

252
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:21,026
..and sweating cooks 
in the kitchen. (Laughs) - What?

253
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:25,273
What do you mean? 
- Should I deal with her reactions too?

254
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,356
I mean, chefs.

255
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:31,526
Ma'am, ignore his nonsense. 
You take a look around. - Yes, I will.

256
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,648
Except the kitchen. 
- Okay.

257
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,884
(Laughs)

258
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:36,700
You are really great!

259
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:38,376
You are also.

260
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:47,481
"You are like a lotus, 
I can't live without seeing you."

261
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:52,981
"I can't get away 
with the magic of jasmine.."

262
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:59,175
"I can't get away 
with the magic of jasmine.."

263
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:04,829
"I can't live without you.." 
- (Door creaks)

264
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:07,230
Hey, naughty!

265
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:30,273
Mother, what did you decide?

266
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,151
What's there to decide?

267
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,648
I have got you married, 
now take your wife along.

268
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:36,773
I will stay in this house.

269
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,610
What's so special about this house?

270
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,401
Come and look how the house 
in Bengaluru is, you will love it.

271
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:42,940
You can live there peacefully.

272
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,371
(Chuckles)

273
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:48,412
A home is not meant 
only to live peacefully.

274
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:52,328
You were quite young 
when your father abandoned us.

275
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:56,149
Every wall of this house 
has seen my pain and has consoled me.

276
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:59,787
These walls made me muster up 
the courage to make what you are now.

277
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:03,415
No, son. 
I won't leave this house.

278
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:05,009
I agreed to get married only because..

279
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,078
..I thought you would come with me 
to Bengaluru.

280
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,620
Otherwise, I was never interested 
in this marriage. - Mind your tongue!

281
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,578
Why should she come with me 
if you are not coming there?

282
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:22,078
I will visit her often.

283
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:25,620
It would be better for you 
if you take her to Bengaluru.

284
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,578
You are superb!

285
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:48,037
She always ignored you, 
but you have convinced her for wedding now.

286
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:49,537
Very good!

287
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,207
Wouldn't it be better if you 
informed your dad about it?

288
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,453
Did my dad inform me 
when he got married?

289
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,120
He didn't.

290
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,748
Your logic is really strange.

291
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:04,646
Anusha will know that you have lied 
to her someday, what will you do then?

292
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,703
What can I do then?

293
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:10,453
I will confess my lie to her 
and act innocent.

294
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,111
She will get angry..

295
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,287
..I will buy her a new pair 
of slippers to hit me until she calms down.

296
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,828
It's okay if she calms down, 
what if she leaves you completely?

297
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,870
Anusha, tell me.

298
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:49,495
I don't know 
how uncle would react, so..

299
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,538
This is just a trial wedding.

300
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:58,620
Your uncle will get you married in real 
with all the pomp and show in our place.

301
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:00,787
That will be like a feast 
to the TV channels.

302
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,329
They will keep repeating 
the same wedding cassette till it gets worn out.

303
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:08,329
Anu, your uncle loves his son a lot.

304
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:15,012
You don't be afraid, 
just come home and stand beside me bravely.

305
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:17,032
I will deal with your uncle.

306
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:17,962
(Horn blares)

307
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:25,120
You don't worry whatsoever, 
seems like your uncle has come home.

308
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,370
Goodnight. 
- Okay, Aunt. Goodnight.

309
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:54,212
(Music)

310
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:59,666
"Should I pinch myself?"

311
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:04,291
"I am not able 
to believe if this true.."

312
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:09,500
"Should I pinch myself?"

313
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,583
"I am not able 
to believe if this true.."

314
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:19,583
"Do not leave my hand.."

315
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:24,458
"Do not break my dreams.."

316
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:29,458
"Do not go away from me 
even for a moment.."

317
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:34,375
"Let us not even think 
about going away from each other.."

318
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:39,125
"Should I pinch myself?"

319
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:44,291
"I am not able 
to believe if this true.."

320
00:25:44,371 --> 00:26:03,154
(Music)

321
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:08,891
"I want you to palm my face.."

322
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:13,791
"So that, I can keep 
looking at you.."

323
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:18,666
"I want to be with you 
in every birth.."

324
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:23,583
"And feel your breath on mine.."

325
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:29,042
"I am not able to speak.."

326
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:33,250
"Shedding tears of joy.."

327
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:38,666
"I have worn your gift in my neck.."

328
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:43,208
"I don't want anything else from life.."

329
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:48,306
"Should I pinch myself?"

330
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:53,457
"I am not able 
to believe if this true.."

331
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:58,106
(Music)

332
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,387
(Door bell rings)

333
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:04,375
Mom?

334
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,624
Oh, you are already here! 
Come in, come in.

335
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:09,769
How are you, dear?

336
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:13,333
Come in. - Mom, won't you 
welcome us traditionally?

337
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:17,791
I will do that if your dad doesn't 
kick me traditionally, come in now.

338
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,958
Mom! 
- Oh, God!

339
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,208
Go and get the veneration platter.

340
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,916
Now, don't ask me 
to fulfil more traditions.

341
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:32,041
If your dad doesn't kick me, 
I will do all that.

342
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,291
Come in soon.

343
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,708
Enter with your right foot first. 
Come on in.

344
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:43,083
God, please save me! 
Only You know what would happen!

345
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,958
Mom, why are you so tense? 
Where is dad?

346
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,333
He will be home any time. 
I have called him.

347
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:53,143
God, please save me. 
- When I am so calm, why are you tense?

348
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:56,125
You have the snacks, we have got them 
prepared especially for you.

349
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,274
You are a boy, you will be calm obviously.

350
00:27:58,354 --> 00:28:00,291
You will remain silent 
when your dad comes..

351
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,000
..but I can't. 
What do I do now?

352
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,041
Oh, he has come!

353
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,791
God, what do I do? 
Only You know what he would do.

354
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:10,833
What do I do?

355
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,000
Hey, come soon and take them.

356
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:17,083
God, what would happen now? 
God, please save me.

357
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,791
God, please help!

358
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,333
There shouldn't be any problem in the 
mass-marriage we have organsied. - God!

359
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,708
Those hundred couples..

360
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,000
Get me some water.

361
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:35,889
(Slaps)

362
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:44,166
Who is this 101th couple? 
- Dad, actually.. she is my friend.

363
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,083
What kind of a friend?

364
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,125
Girlfriend.

365
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:51,833
What is this?

366
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,750
Hello, Uncle. 
My name is Anusha.

367
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:58,916
I don't like creating 
a scene unnecessarily.

368
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:08,128
Partha and I got married this morning 
in the Sub-Registrar Office.

369
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:11,375
We came here to inform you about it 
and take your blessings.

370
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,920
A wedding is where the elders 
get their children married.

371
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,670
If you get married in some office, 
it means that you are being misled.

372
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,500
Now what I should give you 
is forgiveness, not blessings.

373
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:31,458
But he never does anything 
that deserves forgiveness.

374
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:33,958
Uncle, you have 
misunderstood Partha.

375
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,791
I don't have to ask you about my son.

376
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:43,125
We have given him birth 
and we are tolerating him now.

377
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,083
My ill-fate!

378
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,142
I think, you have been fooled as you got 
married to him..

379
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,708
..because he is the son of an MLA.

380
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:56,708
I didn't get married depending on you, 
we know how to live like a family.

381
00:29:56,788 --> 00:30:01,083
If you have any such ideas, 
you better get rid of them right now.

382
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,753
You are not going to get anything from me. 
- Uncle, your money is not.. - Let's go.

383
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,916
Partha.. Partha.. 
- What are you doing? - Be quiet, Mom.

384
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,000
You come with me.

385
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,875
I want to talk to him. 
- Anu..

386
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:18,166
Sorry, please don't mind me.

387
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,791
He has completed Hotel Management, 
he owns a hotel too.

388
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,166
What more do you want?

389
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:25,295
(Laughs)

390
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,416
So, he has told you the same story.

391
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,208
I thought he has lied only 
to other people to hide his cowardice.

392
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,041
You have fooled 
this innocent girl big time.

393
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,050
Shame on you!

394
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,250
Even my slippers 
lead a way better life than you.

395
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,458
Do you really own a hotel?

396
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:51,541
Girl, he has been paying 
to get passing marks since 10th grade.

397
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:55,166
I knew that he won't be 
a good human being if he remains home..

398
00:30:55,541 --> 00:31:01,208
..so I threw him away from the house. 
Just imagine!

399
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,250
His mom sends him money 
every time he demands.

400
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,083
His friend owns a hotel, he feeds him  
every time he visits that hotel.

401
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,420
He has free meal 
and roams around in the car.

402
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,920
This is the life he is leading.

403
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,333
It's believed that 
one shouldn't oust the newlywed couple.

404
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,916
The door is open.

405
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,791
Hey, come here.

406
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,067
(Slaps)

407
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,541
Get lost! 
What are you looking at?

408
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:19,682
(Music)

409
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:27,500
"I scribbled my dreams 
on the sea beach.."

410
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:37,521
"It got washed away 
with the water wave.."

411
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:42,872
(Music)

412
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:49,583
"I scribbled my dreams 
on the sea beach.."

413
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:54,250
"It got washed away 
with the water wave.."

414
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:59,791
"I can't even trust 
my own shadow now.."

415
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:04,708
"After the boat I trusted drowned.."

416
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:09,625
"I can't even trust 
my own shadow now.."

417
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:15,000
"After the boat I trusted drowned.."

418
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:21,583
"I scribbled my dreams 
on the sea beach.."

419
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,541
"It got washed away 
with the water wave.."

420
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:36,092
(Music)

421
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:08,027
(Crying)

422
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:10,286
(Door knocks)

423
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:52,581
(Music)

424
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:58,166
"I am like a bird now 
which has lost its feather.."

425
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:03,333
"The dream of reaching 
my destination makes no sense now.."

426
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,291
"I couldn't recognise 
your fake smile.."

427
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:12,875
"My dream has got shattered.."

428
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:18,083
"No proof is needed 
for the broken heart.."

429
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:22,791
"Aren't tears the proof enough?"

430
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,041
"I scribbled my dreams 
on the sea beach.."

431
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:35,250
"It got washed away 
with the water wave.."

432
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:54,713
(Music)

433
00:35:55,458 --> 00:36:00,458
"In his world with no secrets.."

434
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,916
"I am entering 
with these small steps.."

435
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:10,208
"When someone calls him.."

436
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,875
"It feels like they are calling me.."

437
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:20,416
"How can I look at him 
with my shyful eyes.."

438
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:25,000
"While my fingers 
are drawing imaginary pictures.."

439
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:30,333
"I am going on the chariot of love.."

440
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:34,875
"This excitement is too new for me.."

441
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,708
"I will hold your hands 
and come with you.."

442
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:44,334
"Your dreams are mine now.."

443
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:49,583
"I will hold your hands 
and come with you.."

444
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,291
"Your dreams are mine now.."

445
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:59,833
"I have started weaving dreams.."

446
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,500
"Help me complete them.."

447
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:09,208
"I will hold your hands 
and come with you.."

448
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:14,083
"Your dreams are mine now.."

449
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:29,002
(Phone rings)

450
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:30,833
Yes, Mom?

451
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:34,708
Partha, what happened last night?

452
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,125
Did Anu say anything? 
Did you people fight?

453
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:45,987
I wouldn't have minded 
if she had scolded me and insulted me..

454
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:49,500
..but she is a strong girl.

455
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:52,416
She has a strong mind 
and weak body.

456
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,833
What would you do now? 
- What would I do?

457
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,916
I will correct my mistake.

458
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,458
I know that it will take time.

459
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:09,000
Everything is in her hands, Mom.

460
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,625
If she...leaves you alone?

461
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,000
Why is everyone 
making me feel scared?

462
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:24,500
Do you all think 
I am not capable of convincing her?

463
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,625
I have lied to her to get married..

464
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,666
..but I really love her.

465
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:33,791
I will fight to make her 
live with me all my life.

466
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,758
It's okay if she doesn't treat me like 
a good husband..

467
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,250
..or treats me like I am an idiot..

468
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:43,000
..but I just want her to stay with me.

469
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,708
I can't even hear that 
she won't be with me..

470
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:49,750
..then how can I live 
if she leaves me alone?

471
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,458
I will go to the Paying Guest, 
pack my bags and go to my office.

472
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,250
I will come home from office, 
you get the bags.

473
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,795
Should I drop you?

474
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:06,686
(Scoffs)

475
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,583
Spare me. 
- I'll call you back.

476
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,458
Swamy? 
- Yes, sir.

477
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,166
You reported to work a day before.

478
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:37,541
Is everything okay?

479
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,390
(Laughs)

480
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,125
Why have you come to work when you are 
supposed to work somewhere else? - Exactly.

481
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,416
I was done with my work, so.. 
- What's wrong with you?

482
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,765
Only after you get married, you work 
day and night. Am I right, Rekha?

483
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,308
(Giggles)

484
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:53,166
Sorry.

485
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,125
Sir, wish Anusha too.

486
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:02,208
My grandpa got a heart attack, 
I got to know that only after he died.

487
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:05,000
Similarly, now I got to know 
that she has got married.

488
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,958
I am your boss. Forget inviting me, 
you could have at least informed me.

489
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,500
Sorry, sir. 
It was unplanned.

490
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,878
Unplanned, you say? 
- Yes, sir. Poor girl.

491
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,375
Only children come unplanned, 
not weddings.

492
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,857
Am I right, Rekha?

493
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:24,058
(Laughs)

494
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:27,041
Okay, just kidding. 
So, when is the party?

495
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:32,000
We will discuss it and throw a party 
at home, sir. - Excuse me!

496
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,625
You can't get together.

497
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:40,541
I agree that you have got married.

498
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,833
You can only discuss it, 
a house party is also good.

499
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:51,022
The ambience should be good, 
that's it. Okay? - Yeah, yeah.

500
00:40:51,102 --> 00:40:53,916
Now, please carry on with your work. 
- Okay. - Okay.

501
00:40:54,963 --> 00:40:57,255
So, you are not going 
to give me anymore money.

502
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:01,630
You have always given me money, 
now how can you refuse?

503
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:03,422
How would I pay for my food?

504
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:07,073
I know, Partha. 
This is what your father wants.

505
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:11,283
He told me to not 
give you any pocket money.

506
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:18,213
He has instructed the servants 
to keep an eye on telecalls with you.

507
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:20,963
Such a pain!

508
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:24,255
A maid will keep 
an eye on the owner now!

509
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:27,213
Anything is possible in politics.

510
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:31,838
Okay, hang up. 
- Okay.

511
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:42,303
Now, what do you want? 
- I have prepared tasty Sambar for you.

512
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,425
I want to have food with you.

513
00:41:44,509 --> 00:41:48,092
I asked you about 
your life and future.

514
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,550
I will never lie to you.

515
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,634
I will somehow correct my mistakes.

516
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:57,217
I don't understand 
what profession I should choose.

517
00:41:57,509 --> 00:41:58,717
I am confused.

518
00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:01,342
I will take a good decision 
as soon as possible.

519
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:07,554
My colleagues are coming home 
in the evening, I am throwing a party.

520
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:10,592
Don't behave like a stupid with them, 
maintain some decency.

521
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:13,384
I mean, don't open 
your mouth in front of them.

522
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,845
Stupid!

523
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:18,259
I better go outside, 
that would be good for you.

524
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:20,842
What would I do 
if I don't talk to anyone?

525
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:23,175
Just nod your head 
for everything I say.

526
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:29,179
'She respects me a lot.'

527
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:32,592
'God gives the tongue to talk, 
but wife locks it.'

528
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Shruti?

529
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:44,092
Shruti, are you still alive?

530
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,675
You and your face!

531
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:58,092
I am throwing a party 
to my colleagues this evening.

532
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,175
First of all, change your looks.

533
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:03,092
What's wrong with this look?

534
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:05,066
Do you want to know 
what's wrong? - Yes.

535
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:07,425
You look like a scarecrow.

536
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,384
Don't you have 'Chudidars'?

537
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:15,800
My father had bought me some 
during my school days.

538
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,217
They don't fit me now. 
- During your school days?

539
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,175
Till what grade have you studied?

540
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:25,676
This much. 
- 7th grade?

541
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:28,175
Yes, very good. 
Did you pass or failed?

542
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:30,925
I failed. 
- Very good!

543
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:38,925
Don't wear this old fashion this evening, 
instead wear the one I have brought for you.

544
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,675
Wear the bangles 
that I have bought, got it?

545
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:49,092
One more thing, 
don't apply oil to your hair.

546
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:53,425
Let them loose. 
That way, you will look modern.

547
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,300
Got it?

548
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:05,324
Shruti?

549
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:10,160
(Door knocks)

550
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,324
Shruti?

551
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:12,535
(Door knocks)

552
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:14,907
Shruti, how long do you take?

553
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:19,199
Yes, I am adorning myself just  
like you have asked me to, please wait.

554
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:22,157
No matter how much you adorn yourself, 
you will look the same. Come outside soon.

555
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,782
Okay, I will come in a while. 
You carry on.

556
00:44:25,427 --> 00:44:29,949
I am telling you, understand 
my situation and feelings.

557
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:31,324
Come out soon.

558
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:34,785
Congratulations, pal! 
- Hi!

559
00:44:34,865 --> 00:44:36,865
Congrats, Swamy! 
- Thank you.

560
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,780
Enjoy the party, man. Have fun. 
- Sure.

561
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:43,824
Hey, what are you doing? 
- Hey, Swamy! - Hi!

562
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:46,077
Why did you come alone? 
Where is your wife?

563
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:48,516
Is she a bit slow? 
- She is coming.

564
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:50,074
Is he? 
- Yes, she is.

565
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:54,285
Sweetheart, don't act over smart.

566
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:57,365
Hope you remember what I have told you. 
- You have got a good taste.

567
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,657
You have caught a village belle. 
Very nice!

568
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,699
Hey, why did you wear this sari?

569
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:08,994
Where is the dress I gave you? 
- I have worn them inside.

570
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:12,782
They looked indecent, 
so I covered them with the sari.

571
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:16,494
Cheers to everybody! 
- Cheers!

572
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:18,407
Wish them a happy married life!

573
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,767
I wish you a happy married life! 
- Let us all have fun!

574
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:31,382
Come, let's have some drink. 
- You carry on with your drink.

575
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,865
Hi! Vidya! Saraswati!

576
00:45:56,116 --> 00:45:57,375
Did you find the party boring?

577
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:58,752
(Laughs)

578
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:05,077
You are so well-educated, 
still you are afraid of talking.

579
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:06,177
(Laughs)

580
00:46:06,925 --> 00:46:11,623
If you are so timid, can we live 
with these corporate people?

581
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,927
(Laughs)

582
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:18,699
Hey, please stop crying.

583
00:46:19,412 --> 00:46:22,117
My wife will kill me 
if she sees you crying.

584
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,009
Please stop crying, I will go away.

585
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:25,740
I didn't do anything, 
I don't know anything.

586
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,199
In the next birth, I will be your son 
and pursue masters degree, okay?

587
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:31,615
See you.

588
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,619
It's not about you, my husband.

589
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:41,255
I don't have buffaloes, but cows.

590
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:46,199
And I have...studied 
till this much grade.

591
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,115
That too, I have failed.

592
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:51,990
Why did he lie?

593
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,933
She has completed her graduation 
though she comes from a rural background.

594
00:46:55,013 --> 00:47:00,782
She is pursuing masters here. 
- I don't have buffaloes, but cows.

595
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:03,907
This is such a great fate!

596
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:09,202
Both of us are treading the same path, 
but in two different vehicles.

597
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:10,824
It happened with me too.

598
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:13,990
My husband, Parth, owns a hotel.

599
00:47:14,187 --> 00:47:18,282
Happily married, happy life. 
I am very happy with him.

600
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,199
Whatever my wife said is also a lie.

601
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,115
Maybe, she wanted 
a husband who earns well..

602
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,740
..but I met her.

603
00:47:29,188 --> 00:47:31,990
So, she has told all the lies 
to patch the broken threads.

604
00:47:34,322 --> 00:47:39,490
Does that mean, even my husband 
wanted a well-educated girl?

605
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:41,907
I think so.

606
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:50,074
It's true that I don't deserve 
to be the wife of him.

607
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:53,407
My aunt asked me to get married, 
so I got married.

608
00:47:54,074 --> 00:48:00,449
But I didn't know 
this was the truth. - Seriously?

609
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,657
You didn't know, 
but I did this knowingly.

610
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:06,782
What can we do now?

611
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:11,241
See you again. 
Bye, bye.

612
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:26,712
(Car engine starts)

613
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:55,476
(Laughs)

614
00:48:55,965 --> 00:48:56,799
(Yawning)

615
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:10,281
(Laughs)

616
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,178
(Gasps)

617
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:55,865
Yeah.

618
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:57,907
Yeah, yeah, got it.

619
00:49:59,282 --> 00:50:00,657
Yeah, yeah.

620
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,115
Okay.

621
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:18,997
(Chuckles)

622
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,254
(Laughs)

623
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:01,074
Did you have your food?

624
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:15,157
Come home, I will serve you food.

625
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:40,994
One lady, two hands. 
Did you prepare all these dishes?

626
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:45,577
Not only this, 
I can cook many dishes.

627
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:50,785
Then it is good that your husband fought 
with you and left with an empty stomach.

628
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:53,489
Say sorry.

629
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:57,740
No wife would be happy if her husband 
leaves with an empty stomach.

630
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:00,824
So, I was going 
to give away the food to a dog.

631
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:02,494
But then, you came.

632
00:53:02,574 --> 00:53:03,699
Please don't.

633
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:08,074
Before you give away the food to dog, 
turn towards my house, I will be there.

634
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,240
You shouldn't waste food, 
Mr. Shyam Murthy will get angry.

635
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:18,324
Who is he? - He is the brand ambassador 
for headache medicines.

636
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:22,109
My wife, the woman with an attitude, 
I am talking about her father-in-law.

637
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:23,726
(Laughs)

638
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:27,907
I swear on the dog, 
whenever any food is left

639
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:32,782
come to the terrace and bark. 
I will drop in here.

640
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:38,115
So, shouldn't I give away 
the leftover food to dog?

641
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:42,502
No way, pack it for me. 
I will have it for dinner.

642
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,329
Okay.

643
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,865
Which hotel did you bring the food from? 
How did you get the money?

644
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:30,574
The hotel..

645
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:42,068
(Humming)

646
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,877
My friend, Prashanth..

647
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:55,615
On the friendship basis, I took 
a loan of Rs. 1000 without any interest.

648
00:54:56,104 --> 00:55:01,949
He told me to return it 
whenever I can.

649
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,990
Do you know why 
I am still living with you?

650
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:08,782
Not because I am hoping 
that you would change.

651
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:13,740
I just don't want everyone to know 
that you have fooled me.

652
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:17,907
Don't take loan from everyone 
and add up to my woes.

653
00:55:18,843 --> 00:55:20,657
Do not humiliate me.

654
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:38,944
Eureka! Eureka! Eureka!

655
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:08,662
Hey, MES! - I have told you, 
I don't have buffaloes, but cows.

656
00:56:08,742 --> 00:56:11,074
I have studied only till this much, 
moreover I have failed in the exams.

657
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:14,449
I will get you get good grades. 
You cook really tasty food.

658
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:16,699
I have completed Hotel Management.

659
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:19,115
I mean, I haven't completed it, 
but it's okay.

660
00:56:19,195 --> 00:56:21,032
You prepare food, I will sell it.

661
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,407
Why don't we start 
a 'give and take' business?

662
00:56:24,844 --> 00:56:28,935
I know how to 'geon', 
not sure about 'take' though.

663
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:30,160
(Laughs)

664
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,240
It's simple. Just prepare any dish 
you know and I will sell it.

665
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,699
Let's share the profit equally, 
what do you say?

666
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:43,990
How will you sell it? 
- Just like people sell vegetables.

667
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:49,460
No, I won't do it. My husband will cut 
and boil if he comes to know about it.

668
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,740
The brinjal? 
- No, me.

669
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:55,357
Your husband returns home only at night.

670
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:58,365
How will he know what happens 
when he is not home?

671
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:04,369
What if people doubt that 
there is more to our relationship?

672
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:06,657
Forget about the people.

673
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:12,490
This is a good decision to teach a lesson 
to your husband and my wife.

674
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,577
We should stand on our own two legs. 
- Then how do you think I am standing?

675
00:57:16,657 --> 00:57:19,732
On your husband's legs. 
- Really?

676
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:24,532
That's why, he often says 
that he will kick me. - (Laughs)

677
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:26,407
Oh, you have realised it now.

678
00:57:26,669 --> 00:57:32,449
I will get whatever I have at home, 
prepare whatever you get at your house.

679
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:34,324
Let's start the business tomorrow.

680
00:58:09,074 --> 00:58:11,782
What about tomorrow?

681
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:31,824
My husband is not home. 
- That is why, I came.

682
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:36,764
MES, didn't I tell you 
about the food business?

683
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:40,494
Open the door now. - I have told you, 
I don't have buffaloes, but cows.

684
00:58:40,574 --> 00:58:42,532
I have studied only till this much, 
moreover I have failed in the exams.

685
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:44,065
I will get you good grades.

686
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:50,449
Oh, so everything is ready.

687
00:58:52,178 --> 00:58:56,532
I don't know why, I feel scared. 
What if my husband comes to know about it?

688
00:58:56,736 --> 00:59:01,949
Throw him some food, 
he will calm down.

689
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:06,157
He is not Anu's husband that I will 
throw food to him, he is Shruti's husband.

690
00:59:10,497 --> 00:59:14,032
Do you know what 
the common problem of ever woman is?

691
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:18,199
No matter how many dreams you have, 
you hide it under your sad eyes.

692
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:25,782
Just take a deep breath twice, 
you will get the courage.

693
00:59:28,038 --> 00:59:29,350
(Inhales sharply)

694
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,541
(Laughs)

695
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:35,916
(Exhales deeply)

696
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,888
You are.. 
- (Laughs)

697
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:54,339
(Music)

698
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:58,990
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

699
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:02,849
"Why waste time.."

700
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:07,365
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

701
01:00:07,445 --> 01:00:11,365
"Why waste time.."

702
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:15,813
"To cut the expensive fruits.."

703
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:19,740
"Let's go happily.."

704
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,047
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

705
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:27,895
"Why waste time.."

706
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:44,948
(Music)

707
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:48,532
Sir, the car is an expensive one. 
Is the food expensive too?

708
01:00:48,699 --> 01:00:51,865
Sir, this is my first time. 
So, I will accept how much ever you give.

709
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:54,824
The GST is not applicable, come on. 
- Give me some then.

710
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:02,876
(Music)

711
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:07,407
Three, four.. 
My God, is it really so profitable?

712
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:12,285
The profit margin is 
more in food business.

713
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:15,740
People would have become lazy 
if they didn't have a stomach.

714
01:01:16,195 --> 01:01:22,365
Now I know why my wife and dad 
always asked me to work hard for food.

715
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:26,365
You are really a great cook!

716
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:29,657
Why don't you come 
with me to the hotel?

717
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,782
It's hard for me to manage alone.

718
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:33,734
No, I won't come.

719
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:37,185
My husband will cut and boil me 
if he comes to know about it.

720
01:01:42,624 --> 01:01:50,806
"When time calls, we should go.. 
We should understand its importance.."

721
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:58,539
"A simple leniency is enough for  
our people, we should be very careful.."

722
01:01:59,447 --> 01:02:03,615
"We have worked hard.."

723
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:07,559
"Now, let's reap the benefits.."

724
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:11,615
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

725
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:15,368
"Why waste time.."

726
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:19,907
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

727
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:24,115
"Why waste time.."

728
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:28,365
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

729
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:32,365
"Why waste time.."

730
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:36,949
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

731
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:40,949
"Why waste time.."

732
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:49,324
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

733
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:59,873
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

734
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,715
Hey, why are you so slow? 
- Sir, almost done.

735
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:05,549
It's a waste to pay you guys. 
Make it soon. - Just a minute, sir.

736
01:03:05,629 --> 01:03:07,590
Is it ready? 
- Yes, sir.

737
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,049
Say 'rolling' then. 
- Rolling, sir.

738
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:10,507
Rolling? 
- Rolling, sir.

739
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:15,799
Okay, I welcome you all 
to the special programme on food.

740
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:19,299
Everyone knows 
how expensive Fortuner car is.

741
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:25,010
A couple is selling North Karnataka food 
in the same Fortuner car in full fledge.

742
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,174
Come, let us find out more about it.

743
01:03:28,086 --> 01:03:29,338
Hello, lady. 
- Hello.

744
01:03:29,418 --> 01:03:32,043
We have come to make 
your Hotel Fortuner famous.

745
01:03:32,252 --> 01:03:34,043
What are the dishes in your hotel?

746
01:03:34,335 --> 01:03:38,076
'Jawar Roti', 'Palya' and 'Susla'. 
What do you want? - Superb!

747
01:03:38,156 --> 01:03:41,630
Are you the one who prepares food? 
- Yes, I prepare it and he sells it.

748
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,293
He.. 
Oh, is he your husband?

749
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:49,033
No, we just stay nearby. 
- Just stay nearby?

750
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:52,268
What do you mean by that? 
- We are neighbours.

751
01:03:52,348 --> 01:03:55,043
Oh, so they are neighbours. 
- Don't you understand anything?

752
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,261
Cover your face and stand aside.

753
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:58,543
Show your face to the camera, 
not your back.

754
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:02,252
He is the owner. 
- Sir, please don't shoot.

755
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,918
Please turn the camera off. 
- What is the problem?

756
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:09,213
Sir, please understand. 
Don't shoot, please.

757
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:11,380
Don't touch the camera, 
I will shoot it.

758
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,891
Shoot it, 
I will give the voice over if needed.

759
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:14,005
Sir, you are not understanding it.

760
01:04:14,085 --> 01:04:17,255
You cover your face and stand aside. 
- Show your face, what's the problem?

761
01:04:17,335 --> 01:04:19,130
Sir, please don't shoot. 
Please try to understand.

762
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,088
I won't understand, so what? 
- Sir, please don't shoot.

763
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:25,214
Hey, give the camera here. 
- Don't touch the camera, return it.

764
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:25,922
I won't!

765
01:04:26,002 --> 01:04:28,002
Return the camera. - Promise me that 
you won't shoot, then I will return it.

766
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:31,422
I get paid to shoot things like these. 
- No, I won't return it.

767
01:04:31,502 --> 01:04:33,255
So, you won't return it. 
- No, I won't.

768
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:36,713
Your restaurant name is Fortuner, right? 
I will change your entire fortune, idiot.

769
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:37,835
Wait here, I will come back.

770
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,088
Let's go, guys. How dare he snatch 
the camera! I will teach him a lesson.

771
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:42,335
Sir, the camera.. - What were you doing 
when he snatched the camera?

772
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:43,793
What kind of a cameraman are you?

773
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,793
I will teach you a lesson today. 
I won't spare you.

774
01:04:51,543 --> 01:04:54,460
Hello, sir. 
It's me from TV5.

775
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:57,793
Here's your money, 
the food was great! Will visit again.

776
01:05:02,043 --> 01:05:03,252
Sir? 
- What is it?

777
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,797
They came. 
- Hello, sir.

778
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:07,015
What are you looking at? 
Go and get the camera.

779
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:08,085
My people are here.

780
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:10,793
What do they think 
about the media professionals?

781
01:05:12,502 --> 01:05:16,287
Come aside, you people. 
- Sir, we are innocent.

782
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:19,005
Why did you make a bomb hoax call? 
- Sir, none of us did it. Please, sir.

783
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:20,793
Please let us go, sir. 
- This is how I teach lesson to people.

784
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:22,880
Sir, I don't understand 
why you are doing this.

785
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,002
Sir, what was our mistake 
that you have called the police?

786
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:27,147
You that we are innocent.

787
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:30,002
Sir, I have returned the camera, 
then what is the problem?

788
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:34,297
Sir, please tell them to stop. Sir, please. 
- I'll hit you if you don't move.

789
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:35,252
Move!

790
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:38,097
Sir, why are you seizing my car?

791
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:39,252
Please let it go, sir.

792
01:05:39,423 --> 01:05:40,876
Sir, what is this?

793
01:06:04,313 --> 01:06:05,835
We are not opposing anything..

794
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:11,127
..but we just want to live, 
and live respectfully.

795
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:16,127
We want that respect 
only from our spouses. - Exactly.

796
01:06:16,918 --> 01:06:20,543
Well, the sound of your language 
is really wonderful.

797
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:25,168
Okay, I was there today 
and I somehow managed it..

798
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:29,797
..but tomorrow someone else will be there, 
and they will misunderstand you.

799
01:06:29,877 --> 01:06:31,710
What if they create problems 
for your restaurant?

800
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:34,633
I might not have learnt 
much from my father..

801
01:06:34,713 --> 01:06:36,838
..but I have learnt a lot from my aunt.

802
01:06:36,918 --> 01:06:41,422
She says that noble deeds 
are always accompanied with hurdles..

803
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,293
..and that we should 
still cruise ahead.

804
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:46,710
Superb!

805
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:50,168
If everyone thinks like you, 
it would be great!

806
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:55,210
Actually, I thought of inviting 
you both for panel discussion..

807
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:57,043
..but we can do that later.

808
01:06:57,218 --> 01:06:59,377
First of all, let us correct 
what has gone wrong.

809
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,627
First of all, let's go to the police station. 
What do you say?

810
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,418
I will talk to them, you can resume 
your restaurant tomorrow. - Sure, sir.

811
01:07:06,066 --> 01:07:08,672
'Oh, so they are neighbours. 
- Don't you understand anything?'

812
01:07:08,752 --> 01:07:09,879
'Cover your face and stand aside.'

813
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,088
'Show your face to the camera, 
not your back.'

814
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:14,145
'He is the owner. 
- Sir, please don't shoot.'

815
01:07:14,352 --> 01:07:15,356
You don't worry.

816
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:18,755
Come on, everybody is here. 
- Look, don't call and irritate me.

817
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,380
Hey, what's this? 
- I'll call back.

818
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,630
Haven't you taken a lunch break yet? 
- Not yet, sir.

819
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,742
Come on, 
I will take you to a good restaurant.

820
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:26,504
Anu, you also come. Come on. 
- Oh, free lunch!

821
01:07:29,418 --> 01:07:32,710
Ma'am, let's go for lunch. 
- No, you carry on.

822
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,654
He will buy us lunch, come on. 
- I know that, you get lost!

823
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:38,293
She is such a fool!

824
01:07:55,252 --> 01:07:56,375
Where is the owner?

825
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:58,710
Why do you need to see the owner 
when the food is right here?

826
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,710
There's special 'Jawar Roti'. 
- Serve five plates of it.

827
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:04,002
Oh, sure. 
Please be seated, sir.

828
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:16,668
Come soon. 
- Here you go, sir. You too, ma'am.

829
01:08:17,085 --> 01:08:18,802
Prepare more 'Rotis' 
from tomorrow because..

830
01:08:41,335 --> 01:08:42,793
Let's go. 
What are you looking at?

831
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,800
(Car engine starts)

832
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:49,963
(Sighs)

833
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:56,543
Sir, you said that you would return soon. 
There was so much work, you know?

834
01:08:57,252 --> 01:08:59,963
Dilip, you saved my honour!

835
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:03,671
Here is Rs. 50 tip for Dilip 
who saved your honour!

836
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:08,091
Wow!

837
01:09:08,171 --> 01:09:10,608
(Clapping)

838
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:21,252
You should better change the title 
of this restaurant to 'Family Wreckage'.

839
01:09:26,443 --> 01:09:31,043
I didn't know your choice 
was so bad. Good luck!

840
01:09:55,105 --> 01:09:55,727
(Slaps)

841
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,401
Stand with your head high 
at least for today.

842
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:06,068
Don't be upset, it is my son 
who deserves to feel ashamed.

843
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:10,518
Swamy, there is nothing to be ashamed of.

844
01:10:10,598 --> 01:10:12,860
First of all, 
get rid of your doubtful thoughts.

845
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:17,151
When he was doing wrong, 
you supported him.

846
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,269
Now, he is trying to do 
something in his life.

847
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,651
You should actually be happy about it.

848
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,443
She roams around with someone.

849
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:27,113
God knows what all she is 
up to in the garb of business..

850
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:30,526
..and you are asking me to let her 
stay with me! - Hold your tongue!

851
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:32,901
Nothing as such has happened here.

852
01:10:33,073 --> 01:10:37,443
It's okay if the husband doesn't 
fight for her wife in the society..

853
01:10:37,797 --> 01:10:40,443
..but he shouldn't do something 
that humiliates her.

854
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:44,031
Shruti is one in a million, 
she is as pure as fire.

855
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:45,193
Then push her in fire.

856
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:47,257
We will see what we should do 
if she comes out alive.

857
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,818
As if you are as noble 
as Lord Sri Ram.

858
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:55,280
I hate what he is doing 
and it is about my prestige!

859
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,568
Stop shouting 
about your prestige.

860
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:04,401
I wanted to smile wholeheartedly, 
but you made it worse with your colleagues.

861
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,110
Partha!

862
01:11:08,987 --> 01:11:13,235
Partha, you don't understand girls.

863
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:17,821
I have an idea, ask your dad 
for some money and start a restaurant.

864
01:11:17,901 --> 01:11:19,405
Stop meeting that girl.

865
01:11:19,485 --> 01:11:24,443
Sharada, I don't want him 
to weave his future with my money.

866
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:30,735
You work in office and she sells food 
on streets, what's wrong in this?

867
01:11:31,568 --> 01:11:33,443
It is not about right and wrong.

868
01:11:35,235 --> 01:11:38,276
Just ask him 
if he will stop this or not.

869
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:39,526
Why won't he stop it?

870
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,901
He will definitely stop it, 
he should stop it for you.

871
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:46,610
Why are you quiet? 
Why don't you try to talk sense into him?

872
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:48,875
Don't listen to others..

873
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:52,113
..there is a very thin line 
between love and doubting..

874
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:58,360
..you can't erase it, but you should run 
your family taking care of it.

875
01:11:58,598 --> 01:12:02,651
If she agrees to live as my wife..

876
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,522
..stop her nonsense business..

877
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:09,526
..and remain home behind 
the closed door, yes.

878
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,151
Will your family run well 
if he stop his business?

879
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,651
We will see about that.

880
01:12:19,537 --> 01:12:21,860
We don't know what happens next.

881
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:28,138
A woman should hide her wishes..

882
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:34,276
..deep within her heart 
for the sake of her family.

883
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:45,526
Stop that business 
and look after your family.

884
01:12:46,651 --> 01:12:48,943
Even I am trying to say the same.

885
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:57,901
Consider this as a golden opportunity 
to correct your mistakes and stop it here.

886
01:12:58,151 --> 01:13:00,943
Go and tell this to that girl.

887
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:06,235
Dad! 
- For the sake of your wife, go now.

888
01:13:06,693 --> 01:13:10,318
I have to talk to Partha about it.

889
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:39,126
(Phone rings)

890
01:13:40,986 --> 01:13:43,526
Hello, Mr. Partha? 
Is the restaurant closed today?

891
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:47,985
Yes, for permanently. Burn the name plate 
and give me the ashes..

892
01:13:48,316 --> 01:13:49,985
..so that my mom relishes it.

893
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:06,610
People will always find 
an opportunity to comment on us.

894
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:10,413
They misunderstand it even 
if we try to serve food as our livelihood.

895
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:11,133
(Laughs)

896
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,138
Even if a man 
and a woman roam together..

897
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:16,443
..their imagination will go till bedroom.

898
01:14:17,693 --> 01:14:21,651
I am not able to convince 
my husband and mother-in-law.

899
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:22,845
(Sighs)

900
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:27,318
Let us stop this car restaurant here 
with a heavy heart.

901
01:14:29,818 --> 01:14:31,735
Instead, let us start a big restaurant.

902
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:36,318
Have you brought your camera 
again, sir? - No, girl.

903
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:39,485
I am trying to atone 
for my mistake.

904
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:43,443
You have become an inspiration 
to the unemployed.

905
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:45,554
We are getting a lot of calls 
at out TV station.

906
01:14:45,634 --> 01:14:46,901
So what should we do now?

907
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:53,693
You don't have to do anything, 
I have a plan for you.

908
01:14:54,316 --> 01:14:55,901
You should just agree to it.

909
01:15:00,315 --> 01:15:02,754
Both of you will start a good restaurant..

910
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:05,193
..I have convinced the 
Bank Manager to give you a loan.

911
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:10,693
Just bring all your documents 
tomorrow, is that okay?

912
01:15:13,688 --> 01:15:14,542
Bye!

913
01:15:18,607 --> 01:15:21,526
Sir, should we really start 
a good restaurant?

914
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,655
If I don't help people like you, 
God will punish me at the right time.

915
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,901
I will wait for you in the bank 
tomorrow, come without fail.

916
01:15:36,818 --> 01:15:42,151
I have never had any bad intentions 
at you. - Neither have I!

917
01:15:42,443 --> 01:15:43,943
I have never tried to bother you.

918
01:15:44,023 --> 01:15:46,151
I have just worked hard.

919
01:15:46,866 --> 01:15:50,901
This is not fair, why is 
everyone misunderstanding us?

920
01:15:50,985 --> 01:15:54,068
It is their mistake, 
then why should we get the punishment?

921
01:15:56,193 --> 01:15:57,485
You are right.

922
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,818
They are punishing us 
for their mistakes.

923
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:04,443
When I was jobless, 
they called me names.

924
01:16:04,877 --> 01:16:07,613
Now that I am working hard, 
they are pointing a finger at my character.

925
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:10,235
Yes, hard work never fails.

926
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:12,818
We shouldn't be afraid of the bee sting 
if we want to taste the honey.

927
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:14,985
We can find gold 
if we dig hard and deep.

928
01:16:15,482 --> 01:16:17,943
What do you think about 
starting the restaurant?

929
01:16:18,984 --> 01:16:20,943
Let the coin decide it.

930
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:24,110
If it is heads, I will run the restaurant 
and you will be a helping hand.

931
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:27,860
What if it is tails? 
- If it is tails..

932
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:31,818
..you run the restaurant 
and I will be a helping hand. - Done!

933
01:16:35,318 --> 01:16:38,810
I want my husband 
and mother-in-law too.

934
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,626
(Laughs)

935
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:46,943
Even I want my wife. 
I have worked hard to convince her.

936
01:16:47,578 --> 01:16:49,946
I can't say that I will go away 
from her even as a joke.

937
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:51,048
(Laughs)

938
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:53,827
At least, now try to understand.

939
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:58,651
Sharada, let's go.

940
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:19,049
(Music)

941
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:23,901
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

942
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:27,818
"Why waste time.."

943
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:32,610
"To cut the expensive fruits.."

944
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,485
"Let's go happily.."

945
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:40,651
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

946
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,651
"Why waste time.."

947
01:17:44,731 --> 01:18:00,531
(Music)

948
01:18:00,758 --> 01:18:05,110
"Let's have a goal.."

949
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:08,860
"And work towards it.."

950
01:18:09,276 --> 01:18:13,068
"Let's think about 
the drawbacks too.."

951
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:17,151
"And calculate our steps.."

952
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:21,568
"Let's play this game called life.."

953
01:18:21,776 --> 01:18:25,568
"And win it.."

954
01:18:25,651 --> 01:18:29,901
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

955
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,985
"Why waste time.."

956
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:38,318
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

957
01:18:38,443 --> 01:18:42,280
"Why waste time.."

958
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,738
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

959
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:50,651
"Why waste time.."

960
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:55,113
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

961
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:59,363
"Why waste time.."

962
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:09,151
"Let's do something 
productive, my friend.."

963
01:19:10,026 --> 01:19:20,943
"Why waste time.."

964
01:19:24,757 --> 01:19:27,968
(Anklets tinkling)

965
01:19:31,103 --> 01:19:33,193
Looks like you have grown arrogant 
since you are earning well.

966
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,818
How dare you enter my room!

967
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:41,151
Why? Should I buy a token 
to enter my husband's room too?

968
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,485
You are thinking too much 
and getting angry with me unnecessarily.

969
01:19:46,735 --> 01:19:47,610
Please have some sweets.

970
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:51,026
Hey, I had maintained standards..

971
01:19:52,022 --> 01:19:55,860
..but you ruined it all by selling food 
on the streets with another man.

972
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:59,193
You are earning 
through wrong means.

973
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,985
What does that mean? 
- Do you want to know?

974
01:20:04,985 --> 01:20:08,860
Just understand who you are. 
Just understand what you are.

975
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:10,526
Shame on you!

976
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:36,185
(Laughs)

977
01:20:36,358 --> 01:20:38,901
You made me a laughing stock 
in the eyes of the society.

978
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:45,026
They say that my wishes, dreams 
and deliberations are all fake..

979
01:20:45,903 --> 01:20:52,401
..and that anyone can fool me easily. 
You proved it so easily.

980
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,026
You made me a fool!

981
01:20:58,616 --> 01:21:00,318
I know that you are hurt.

982
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:03,818
You can shed tears if you feel like, 
at least I will wipe your tears.

983
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:09,068
If you make fun of me at a time like this, 
it feels like stabbing my heart.

984
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:13,360
I have worked hard 
to start this restaurant.

985
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:17,610
It's okay if you can't support me, 
at least wish me luck.

986
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:20,901
Wish?

987
01:21:21,728 --> 01:21:22,735
Wish!

988
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,901
Wish you all the best!

989
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:43,110
"No one is happy.."

990
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:50,068
"Everyone's heart 
is full of sorrows.."

991
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:55,901
"One should atone 
for his own sins.."

992
01:21:56,863 --> 01:22:02,443
"Why get angry on the God?"

993
01:22:02,862 --> 01:22:04,571
(Laughs)

994
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:08,360
MES, looks like you couldn't sell 
the sweet at your house too.

995
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:09,388
(Laughs)

996
01:22:09,468 --> 01:22:11,836
Are you waiting for a dog 
to give it away to him?

997
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:15,318
Let me have it. 
It's all God's blessings.

998
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:19,860
I don't think God really exists.

999
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,818
I have never seen a person 
like my husband.

1000
01:22:22,993 --> 01:22:24,655
(Laughs)

1001
01:22:24,735 --> 01:22:26,735
How many husbands have you seen?

1002
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:31,360
Don't joke around now, 
I feel like crying.

1003
01:22:32,842 --> 01:22:35,152
It has become common that we will have 
to take the medicine..

1004
01:22:35,232 --> 01:22:36,235
..if they get a headache.

1005
01:22:37,145 --> 01:22:40,151
What worse could have happened now 
that you are so hurt?

1006
01:22:40,551 --> 01:22:46,568
Of course, I am hurt. 
He has never seen me like his wife.

1007
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:48,735
Do you even know what he said?

1008
01:22:48,815 --> 01:22:53,151
No wife would want 
to hear it from her husband.

1009
01:22:53,362 --> 01:22:57,988
I am not a demanding wife 
like other women..

1010
01:22:58,068 --> 01:23:02,318
..I don't even ask him to bid me goodbye 
with a smile while he goes to office

1011
01:23:02,526 --> 01:23:08,026
I don't even demand gold jewelry, 
I don't even want a lot of love.

1012
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:14,985
But just two sweet words 
are enough for me.

1013
01:23:15,818 --> 01:23:18,123
The teachers who doesn't 
admit the kids to school..

1014
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:20,443
..do not give 100 marks 
to them in the exams.

1015
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:25,401
You are joking around again. 
I am not liking it.

1016
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:29,610
You talk so sweet 
when you are emotional.

1017
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:31,985
Shall I give you a free suggestion?

1018
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:35,064
If you talk like our Kannada 
serial actresses..

1019
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:36,943
..shedding tears as well as nose fluid..

1020
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,468
..you will look cuter.

1021
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:40,992
(Laughs)

1022
01:23:48,051 --> 01:23:49,401
I don't want anything.

1023
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:57,401
Even if she comes to me and says 
that she has changed and she loves me..

1024
01:23:58,007 --> 01:23:59,151
..I won't believe her.

1025
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:03,151
Her arrogance is more important 
to her, let her be like that.

1026
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:11,651
I just want her to understand 
who I am and how much I love her.

1027
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:14,401
Partha.. 
- It's okay.

1028
01:24:15,013 --> 01:24:16,526
You are not good at consoling.

1029
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,901
When you are crying, you shouldn't try 
to wipe someone else's tears.

1030
01:24:21,802 --> 01:24:25,727
I didn't want to say that, 
I was asking for the cup.

1031
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:42,831
(Door knocks)

1032
01:24:44,388 --> 01:24:45,101
(Door knocks)

1033
01:24:46,626 --> 01:24:47,577
(Door knocks)

1034
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:13,924
(Horn blares)

1035
01:25:56,895 --> 01:25:57,895
Here you go, sir.

1036
01:25:58,145 --> 01:26:00,145
What is it? 
- This one?

1037
01:26:03,002 --> 01:26:05,335
Oh, a book on how to woo wives.

1038
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:12,710
Please, sir.

1039
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:17,423
Look at the modern times.

1040
01:26:17,503 --> 01:26:20,335
It was not the same 
when my dad was young, he escaped.

1041
01:26:21,169 --> 01:26:23,719
Now, do you realise 
how big an issue is wife?

1042
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:25,585
'How to Woo Wives.'

1043
01:26:25,794 --> 01:26:27,044
Whose wife, sir?

1044
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:30,497
Our own wife 
who makes our life hell.

1045
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:31,427
(Laughs)

1046
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:34,585
The wife who is holding our collars 
is not even letting us hold her feet.

1047
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,335
What happens if a jaggery ball 
is thrown in fire?

1048
01:26:38,585 --> 01:26:41,127
It will melt and become soft.

1049
01:26:41,753 --> 01:26:44,089
Read this book 
and start loving in a new way.

1050
01:26:44,169 --> 01:26:50,056
No matter how rigid the wife is, 
her heart will melt.

1051
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:52,169
And you will get 
a baby in six months.

1052
01:26:53,169 --> 01:26:55,752
If we make haste in planning babies, 
it is said that they will become fools.

1053
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,585
I am not in a hurry 
for children, sir.

1054
01:26:59,223 --> 01:27:24,440
(Music)

1055
01:27:25,082 --> 01:27:35,919
"You are like a lotus in the mud.."

1056
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:48,612
"You are like a lamp in the temple.."

1057
01:27:50,538 --> 01:28:01,419
"You are like a lotus in the mud.."

1058
01:28:03,713 --> 01:28:13,752
"You are like a lamp in the temple.."

1059
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:20,544
"You are like a lamp in the temple.."

1060
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:47,634
(Music)

1061
01:28:47,972 --> 01:29:00,421
"You are like a calf 
dancing in the fields.."

1062
01:29:00,759 --> 01:29:11,752
"You are like a calf 
dancing in the fields.."

1063
01:29:13,631 --> 01:29:24,645
"You are a nectar like a mother's milk.."

1064
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:30,960
"You are a nectar like a mother's milk.."

1065
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:44,948
"You are like a lotus in the mud.."

1066
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:56,460
"You are like a lamp in the temple.."

1067
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:07,464
(Music)

1068
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:19,502
"You are like the voice of the peacock 
dancing in a flower garden.."

1069
01:30:21,214 --> 01:30:31,502
"You are like the fragrance of the flower 
in the garden.."

1070
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:38,002
"You are like the fragrance of the flower 
in the garden.."

1071
01:30:39,255 --> 01:30:45,002
"You...only you.."

1072
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,794
"You are like the fragrance of the flower 
in the garden.."

1073
01:30:53,343 --> 01:30:57,544
"You are like the fragrance of the flower 
in the garden.."

1074
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,710
We are here to enjoy.

1075
01:31:09,508 --> 01:31:12,669
Forget all your problems 
and enjoy the party.

1076
01:31:12,794 --> 01:31:16,002
Only to encourage you people, 
we organise such parties.

1077
01:31:16,335 --> 01:31:18,085
Cheers! 
Have some beer.

1078
01:31:21,046 --> 01:31:23,669
Taste some beer, it tastes good.

1079
01:31:23,749 --> 01:31:27,009
My Hostel Security used to say 
that it tastes like donkey piss.

1080
01:31:39,599 --> 01:31:40,794
Excuse me.

1081
01:31:47,044 --> 01:31:50,044
Hey, sorry guys. 
- Come on, sir.

1082
01:31:50,495 --> 01:31:52,460
Okay, we can go. 
Not a problem.

1083
01:31:52,752 --> 01:31:55,214
Let's go. 
We can go.

1084
01:31:55,294 --> 01:31:57,044
Enjoy! Cheers! 
- Thank you.

1085
01:32:03,502 --> 01:32:05,710
I can understand 
your situation and feelings.

1086
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:08,172
Here, drink some. 
- It's okay, sir.

1087
01:32:08,252 --> 01:32:10,044
This is for you, have it.

1088
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:15,044
Just look at her.

1089
01:32:16,795 --> 01:32:18,809
Then you will understand 
how to take the problems your wife..

1090
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:21,335
..has created for you in a positive way.

1091
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,669
Did you get me?

1092
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:32,460
Sir, just because our time is bad, 
we can't act like animals.

1093
01:32:33,794 --> 01:32:38,794
I have scanned Anu 
the first day she joined.

1094
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:40,130
(Chuckles)

1095
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,588
You express it to everyone, 
but I don't...that's the only difference.

1096
01:32:43,752 --> 01:32:45,169
Then what are you waiting for?

1097
01:32:45,585 --> 01:32:50,169
See, Anu's husband 
has pouched your wife.

1098
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,585
So, why don't you try to pouch Anu?

1099
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:56,047
You are wasting time 
thinking nonsense.

1100
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:57,502
Sir, actually.. 
- Listen!

1101
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:03,044
The iron is hot, 
this is the right time.

1102
01:33:04,585 --> 01:33:05,669
Go and talk to her.

1103
01:33:06,669 --> 01:33:08,919
I said, talk to her. 
Go ahead.

1104
01:33:30,055 --> 01:33:30,781
(Slaps)

1105
01:33:47,065 --> 01:33:47,741
(Slaps)

1106
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:53,061
Look at you, shameless! 
What did you say to her?

1107
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:55,252
Don't you know 
that I am already married?

1108
01:33:55,627 --> 01:33:58,002
Even I am married, 
but what's the use?

1109
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:00,877
You are looking 
for your husband in me indirectly..

1110
01:34:00,957 --> 01:34:02,335
..but you are not realising it.

1111
01:34:02,585 --> 01:34:05,422
So am I. 
I always wanted a wife like you..

1112
01:34:05,502 --> 01:34:06,919
Oh, sorry.

1113
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,960
I wanted you to be my wife.

1114
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,667
(Sighs)

1115
01:34:10,747 --> 01:34:12,210
I think, this is the right time.

1116
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:14,127
Scoundrel! 
- (Slaps)

1117
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,960
I didn't think 
Swamy is wrong here.

1118
01:34:19,252 --> 01:34:21,377
It is Anu's mistake.

1119
01:34:22,377 --> 01:34:24,794
Are you nuts?

1120
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:30,544
Don't use your political ideas here. 
You are making the situation worse.

1121
01:34:31,186 --> 01:34:33,252
How can he talk like that 
to our daughter-in-law?

1122
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:35,919
Don't talk nonsense 
and ruin my son's family.

1123
01:34:37,085 --> 01:34:39,585
I have enquired in their company.

1124
01:34:40,002 --> 01:34:42,752
He doesn't want to accept 
that village girl as his wife.

1125
01:34:43,835 --> 01:34:47,460
Whereas, she never wanted 
a good-for-nothing husband like your son.

1126
01:34:47,824 --> 01:34:52,252
Even if we force them, 
we can't change their heart.

1127
01:34:52,794 --> 01:34:54,002
It is impossible.

1128
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:59,335
Swamy always liked Anu.

1129
01:35:01,624 --> 01:35:03,044
Rascal! 
- (Slaps)

1130
01:35:03,835 --> 01:35:07,002
How dare you eye 
someone else's wife!

1131
01:35:07,502 --> 01:35:11,419
I think, if they don't like to run a family 
with the one they have got married to..

1132
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:13,589
..they can stay with whoever they like.

1133
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:15,752
What are you even saying? 
- Shut up!

1134
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,169
First of all, you and your son 
stop living the life of a pity.

1135
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:24,721
Once they calm down, 
their families will be fine.

1136
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:26,252
That is your misconception.

1137
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,005
What do you say, ma'am?

1138
01:35:29,085 --> 01:35:34,752
I have nothing to say, 
this rascal has already said everything.

1139
01:35:36,186 --> 01:35:38,044
I leave everything 
to their own wishes.

1140
01:35:38,534 --> 01:35:39,794
As they think.

1141
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:42,960
What do you have to say, Swamy?

1142
01:35:44,877 --> 01:35:49,460
If she is ready, 
I am ready to get married to her.

1143
01:36:08,627 --> 01:36:14,627
What do you all think of me? 
Don't I have a heart and dreams?

1144
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:18,544
I thought, I will have a beautiful life 
with the person I loved..

1145
01:36:19,085 --> 01:36:22,585
..but he made me a laughing stock.

1146
01:36:26,585 --> 01:36:36,319
Now, you all are humiliating me.

1147
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:38,210
No, dear.

1148
01:36:39,038 --> 01:36:42,335
Even I don't know 
if I am alive or already dead!

1149
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,502
Anu..

1150
01:36:50,627 --> 01:36:51,877
I want Anu, Dad.

1151
01:36:53,002 --> 01:36:55,210
Please don't discuss this 
in front of me ever!

1152
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:58,460
Even I don't want 
to be a villain in your life, son.

1153
01:36:59,419 --> 01:37:01,044
Sharada, let's go.

1154
01:37:02,919 --> 01:37:03,960
Partha..

1155
01:37:22,794 --> 01:37:26,085
Delicious! 
The food is really tasty.

1156
01:37:26,669 --> 01:37:30,377
All thanks to your training. 
She manages everything.

1157
01:37:30,919 --> 01:37:34,172
That is why, the food is so tasty. 
- I only prepare food..

1158
01:37:34,252 --> 01:37:39,005
..but he does all the cleaning, 
washing, maintaining etc.

1159
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:42,085
Only because of his help, 
we could run this restaurant.

1160
01:37:42,449 --> 01:37:44,339
(Laughs)

1161
01:37:44,419 --> 01:37:47,755
There is no use surrendering 
to your problems.

1162
01:37:47,835 --> 01:37:50,339
We should find solution 
to them ourselves.

1163
01:37:50,419 --> 01:37:54,005
Shruti, you tell his wife the truth.

1164
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:58,960
You explain it to my son.

1165
01:37:59,502 --> 01:38:02,755
Even the stones melt, 
then why can't people's hearts?

1166
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,335
This is what I call an idea! 
This is not even expensive.

1167
01:38:05,544 --> 01:38:07,210
This will definitely work.

1168
01:38:07,627 --> 01:38:10,710
That is why, it is said that 
a old woman in the family is necessary.

1169
01:38:14,172 --> 01:38:15,996
(Laughs)

1170
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:21,203
I never expected this.

1171
01:38:21,283 --> 01:38:23,294
I received an escalation mail 
from the management.

1172
01:38:23,377 --> 01:38:26,460
This is disgusting! We are getting 
humiliated in the production environment.

1173
01:38:26,874 --> 01:38:29,172
Shame on us! 
I need the root cause for this.

1174
01:38:29,252 --> 01:38:31,335
Please reply by mail. 
Get out now!

1175
01:38:33,419 --> 01:38:38,044
If anyone is not interested in working 
in my team, you can just get out!

1176
01:38:38,732 --> 01:38:40,460
Any, what happened? 
What's the problem?

1177
01:38:42,044 --> 01:38:44,628
Don't ask me, ask him.

1178
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:47,294
Swamy, what happened? 
- How would I know?

1179
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:51,252
Ask that woman. 
- Hey, mind your tongue.

1180
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:54,916
There is a problem between us, 
but don't bring it to office.

1181
01:38:54,996 --> 01:38:56,794
Otherwise, I will have 
to teach you a lesson.

1182
01:38:58,058 --> 01:39:01,502
Strange! 
So, you will teach me a lesson?

1183
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:03,085
Go ahead and teach me.

1184
01:39:03,419 --> 01:39:08,380
Your husband must be teaching 
some other lesson to my wife.

1185
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,880
Teach a lesson to your wife 
before pointing finger at my husband.

1186
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:14,089
Shut up, both of you. 
You both are creating a scene.

1187
01:39:14,169 --> 01:39:16,626
Please sort out your personal 
problems at home..

1188
01:39:16,706 --> 01:39:18,716
..it looks disgusting 
to discuss it in the office.

1189
01:39:19,206 --> 01:39:20,960
Isn't he talking disgusting?

1190
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:25,755
Oh, so your husband is 
not disgusting, he is interesting?

1191
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,960
You are crossing your limits now. 
I will kick you out of my project!

1192
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,335
You and your attitude!

1193
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:35,377
God has given you this darned life 
only because of your attitude.

1194
01:39:35,828 --> 01:39:41,835
Yes, I have an attitude. Didn't you know 
that when you were ogling at me secretly?

1195
01:39:42,755 --> 01:39:44,919
You don't even deserve 
to stand in front of me.

1196
01:39:45,457 --> 01:39:47,044
At least, you don't talk 
about deserving.

1197
01:39:47,124 --> 01:39:51,919
You deserve a MLA's son, 
whereas you are too good for me, right?

1198
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,669
What is this?

1199
01:40:11,127 --> 01:40:13,835
Come here. - What did I do? 
- You go to that house.

1200
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:15,960
Wait here quietly.

1201
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:18,917
(Door knocks)

1202
01:40:25,046 --> 01:40:26,586
(Clouds rumbling)

1203
01:40:26,838 --> 01:40:31,162
Sister Anu, are you home?

1204
01:40:32,429 --> 01:40:33,710
Sister Anu?

1205
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,460
Sister Anu, are you home?

1206
01:40:39,895 --> 01:40:41,210
Sister Anu?

1207
01:40:42,395 --> 01:40:43,752
Sister..

1208
01:40:44,828 --> 01:40:47,380
Why have you come at this hour? 
Partha is not home.

1209
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,294
I came to talk to you, Sister.

1210
01:40:50,757 --> 01:40:54,752
Your husband talked a lot in the office, 
have you come to add up to my woes?

1211
01:40:54,832 --> 01:40:58,460
Sister Anu, I have come 
to talk about Partha.

1212
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,438
Who are you to address me as sister?

1213
01:41:01,518 --> 01:41:03,752
After all, who are you to talk 
about Partha?

1214
01:41:04,502 --> 01:41:11,252
Partha is a very nice person, 
he loves you a lot.. - Please leave!

1215
01:41:11,518 --> 01:41:14,669
You don't have to tell me about Partha, 
I know everything about him.

1216
01:41:16,078 --> 01:41:21,797
He loves you with all his heart, 
please try talking to him once.

1217
01:41:21,877 --> 01:41:23,900
He is waiting for you to talk to him.

1218
01:41:26,383 --> 01:41:30,919
He started a restaurant for you, 
but when I asked him to stop it, he didn't.

1219
01:41:32,481 --> 01:41:34,794
Now, what can he do for me?

1220
01:41:35,758 --> 01:41:40,585
He didn't start the restaurant for me, 
but for you.

1221
01:41:42,794 --> 01:41:48,960
You stupid fool! Do you think you can 
convince me with your sweet words?

1222
01:41:49,745 --> 01:41:55,294
He is working hard to deserve your love 
and to make the lie a truth.

1223
01:41:55,538 --> 01:42:00,755
He is not able to look into your eyes 
as he had lied to you..

1224
01:42:00,835 --> 01:42:08,106
..but he is waiting that you will 
understand him and love him.

1225
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:16,252
He knows me better than you. 
- He can do anything for you.

1226
01:42:18,169 --> 01:42:26,085
Instead of you, if he had said 
all this to me, it would have been better.

1227
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:30,169
He is hesitating 
because he has hurt you.

1228
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:32,919
Please try talking to him once.

1229
01:42:33,252 --> 01:42:35,593
If you are ready to live 
with him happily..

1230
01:42:35,673 --> 01:42:37,460
..I will go away from 
the restaurant business.

1231
01:42:45,377 --> 01:42:49,922
Forget that, but Sister Anu 
is a very nice girl.

1232
01:42:50,002 --> 01:42:54,669
She is not at all angry with you, 
she wants to talk to you.

1233
01:42:54,749 --> 01:42:58,752
Really? Are you telling the truth, MES? 
What did you tell her?

1234
01:43:01,335 --> 01:43:03,210
But your husband is quite rigid.

1235
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,627
I told him that 
you are a very sweet woman..

1236
01:43:06,127 --> 01:43:09,044
..and that he will know what you are 
only if he tries to see it.

1237
01:43:09,835 --> 01:43:11,877
You should be fortunate 
to have a wife like her.

1238
01:43:11,957 --> 01:43:14,794
I am unfortunate, 
I don't want anything.

1239
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,710
You take that fortune along.

1240
01:43:19,202 --> 01:43:21,422
I am sorry. 
- It's okay.

1241
01:43:21,502 --> 01:43:25,669
He will realise someday, I am sure. 
You go ahead. - Okay.

1242
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:37,044
Oh, here you are!

1243
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:40,127
I have a lot to talk with you.

1244
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,919
Let's sit and talk.

1245
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:51,377
What are you doing?

1246
01:43:52,716 --> 01:43:56,210
Anu, you are making me 
feel uncomfortable.

1247
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:00,002
Please don't change all of a sudden, 
I won't be able to tolerate it.

1248
01:44:00,585 --> 01:44:06,377
Hurt me or love me, 
but in installments.

1249
01:44:07,044 --> 01:44:09,377
I am not strong enough 
to take it all at a time.

1250
01:44:10,794 --> 01:44:14,419
First of all, stop staring at me 
and tell me what you want to.

1251
01:44:15,335 --> 01:44:17,377
Why do you like me?

1252
01:44:19,835 --> 01:44:21,835
What can I say 
if you ask me all of a sudden?

1253
01:44:22,127 --> 01:44:23,127
It is hard.

1254
01:44:25,585 --> 01:44:30,544
It's okay, tell me why you like me.

1255
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:37,252
When I didn't know what I was, 
I had a reason.

1256
01:44:38,341 --> 01:44:41,919
When I decided to marry you, 
I had a different reason.

1257
01:44:43,291 --> 01:44:47,419
When you didn't leave me even after knowing 
the truth, I had many reasons to love you.

1258
01:44:49,034 --> 01:44:52,294
When you shed tears in the corner, 
I had many other reasons to love you.

1259
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:57,255
When you didn't even look at my face 
despite staying at the same house..

1260
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:58,877
..I loved you in a different way.

1261
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:04,835
Now, when you are staring at me constantly, 
I have a reason to love you.

1262
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:09,335
Only the maturity level of my love for you 
is changing, but not love for you.

1263
01:45:11,877 --> 01:45:14,585
I want you, 
I want only you!

1264
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:19,085
You should stay with me 
and keep threatening me!

1265
01:45:20,127 --> 01:45:24,002
But if you say that you would 
leave me alone, I will really die!

1266
01:45:29,877 --> 01:45:32,752
It's not important 
how much you love me..

1267
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:37,210
..and I don't even want 
to ask that at this stage..

1268
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:42,127
..but I am still not able 
to come over your betrayal.

1269
01:45:44,752 --> 01:45:47,210
You said that 
you would die without me..

1270
01:45:48,173 --> 01:45:52,669
..the give me one reason 
to stay with me.

1271
01:46:02,032 --> 01:46:10,404
(Phone rings)

1272
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:12,634
Bloody rascal!

1273
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,839
(Clouds rumbling)

1274
01:46:16,919 --> 01:46:20,085
Do you know 
what your partner told me?

1275
01:46:20,454 --> 01:46:23,544
She told me that you 
can do anything for me..

1276
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:29,711
..but I am not sure of it.

1277
01:46:30,669 --> 01:46:33,627
Anu, I am ready 
to do anything for you.

1278
01:46:34,335 --> 01:46:37,835
You shouldn't break your promise. 
Are you ready to do anything?

1279
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:43,044
We have come so far, 
at least now believe me.

1280
01:46:50,002 --> 01:46:53,277
Will you leave me 
because I want freedom from you?

1281
01:46:55,002 --> 01:46:56,877
I want to go away forever tomorrow.

1282
01:46:58,794 --> 01:47:01,210
You shouldn't try to convince me.

1283
01:47:01,919 --> 01:47:06,044
Not you, not your dad or mom, 
no one should try to convince me.

1284
01:47:09,127 --> 01:47:12,835
I feel ashamed to say to the court 
that I am married to you.

1285
01:47:13,669 --> 01:47:19,003
Please do not show your face 
for divorce formalities.

1286
01:47:45,134 --> 01:47:50,002
I am not sure if I wanted it, 
but I have got a lot from you.

1287
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:56,627
I don't understand 
how to return it to you.

1288
01:47:56,874 --> 01:47:58,960
You can ask anything if you want.

1289
01:48:01,013 --> 01:48:03,377
Are you expecting anything from me?

1290
01:48:08,242 --> 01:48:13,294
If you want, 
I am ready to sleep with you.

1291
01:48:20,919 --> 01:48:22,544
Will you ask me what I ask for?

1292
01:48:22,954 --> 01:48:25,127
Promise me that you won't laugh.

1293
01:48:25,623 --> 01:48:29,835
Before you go, 
I will prepare food for you.

1294
01:48:30,673 --> 01:48:32,570
No matter how bad it tastes..

1295
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:35,336
..please have it and tell me 
once that it tastes delicious.

1296
01:49:11,062 --> 01:49:16,197
(Crying)

1297
01:49:58,108 --> 01:50:00,858
My son loves you a lot, Anu.

1298
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:05,191
Please don't hurt him.

1299
01:50:06,525 --> 01:50:11,733
Every time you shed a tear, 
it hurt him.

1300
01:50:16,233 --> 01:50:18,275
He is our son..

1301
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:26,525
..so he is committed like his dad 
as well as staggering like me.

1302
01:50:27,261 --> 01:50:29,900
He is such a person..

1303
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:34,900
..that he makes everyone cry 
while he laughs.

1304
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:36,316
Mom, are you done?

1305
01:50:36,775 --> 01:50:39,983
Make it fast, 
the cab is already waiting.

1306
01:50:42,233 --> 01:50:44,691
Anu.. Anu, please don't go.

1307
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:48,983
(Crying)

1308
01:50:54,608 --> 01:50:57,150
Uncle, you were right.

1309
01:50:57,497 --> 01:51:01,941
I don't deserve to stay 
in a well-to-do family like yours.

1310
01:51:04,025 --> 01:51:06,316
I argued a lot with you that day.

1311
01:51:08,066 --> 01:51:09,650
Please forgive me.

1312
01:51:18,358 --> 01:51:23,483
Sometimes, we say 'see you' 
to people we don't even know.

1313
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:32,025
You have done a lot for me, 
my ego hurts to say 'see you' to you.

1314
01:51:33,608 --> 01:51:35,691
The food was delicious.

1315
01:51:39,316 --> 01:51:40,858
You are the reason for it.

1316
01:51:41,108 --> 01:51:44,858
If you ever blame me, 
I will kill you.

1317
01:51:48,775 --> 01:51:51,483
Anu! 
Okay, go away!

1318
01:51:52,066 --> 01:51:54,191
Do you think you 
are a Celestial nymph?

1319
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:57,150
Do you think my son 
won't live without you?

1320
01:51:58,139 --> 01:52:00,858
You don't deserve 
to live with my son!

1321
01:52:04,135 --> 01:52:10,025
"The heart is suffocating.."

1322
01:52:10,275 --> 01:52:16,025
"Without love, 
the heart is giving up.."

1323
01:52:16,441 --> 01:52:21,733
"The heart is yearning.."

1324
01:52:22,614 --> 01:52:28,650
"The heart is yearning for her touch.."

1325
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:34,361
(Music)

1326
01:52:34,441 --> 01:52:39,650
"Oh, my God.."

1327
01:52:41,026 --> 01:52:46,025
"I better die.."

1328
01:52:47,108 --> 01:52:52,775
"Without her, I have no life.."

1329
01:52:53,222 --> 01:52:58,150
"Please understand my pain.."

1330
01:52:59,505 --> 01:53:05,215
"I made a mistake, 
but whom should I confess it to?"

1331
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:11,400
"After she left me, 
what would I even want?"

1332
01:53:11,483 --> 01:53:17,066
"Oh, my God.."

1333
01:53:17,951 --> 01:53:23,066
"I better die.."

1334
01:53:24,108 --> 01:53:29,606
"Without her, I have no life.."

1335
01:53:30,147 --> 01:53:35,275
"Please understand my pain.."

1336
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:59,931
(Music)

1337
01:54:00,483 --> 01:54:06,691
"I agree I lied, 
you could have corrected me.."

1338
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:12,775
"I apologised to you so many times, 
you could have forgiven me only once.."

1339
01:54:13,233 --> 01:54:19,316
"Amidst the roar of the silence, 
the heartbeats are not heard.."

1340
01:54:19,525 --> 01:54:25,400
"You asked questions, 
but never wanted the answers.."

1341
01:54:25,608 --> 01:54:31,342
"With the tear drops, 
the words ended.."

1342
01:54:37,441 --> 01:54:43,695
"Oh, my God.. 
I better die.."

1343
01:54:43,775 --> 01:54:49,945
"Oh, my God.. 
I better die.."

1344
01:54:50,025 --> 01:54:55,986
"Oh, my God.. 
I better die.."

1345
01:54:56,066 --> 01:55:02,277
"Oh, my God.. 
I better die.."

1346
01:55:05,358 --> 01:55:06,525
Shruti?

1347
01:55:08,316 --> 01:55:10,025
Shruti, where are you?

1348
01:55:13,483 --> 01:55:14,900
Shruti?

1349
01:55:16,358 --> 01:55:17,400
Shruti?

1350
01:55:18,275 --> 01:55:19,441
Where are you?

1351
01:55:21,525 --> 01:55:23,108
Where did you go?

1352
01:55:23,781 --> 01:55:25,316
Where should I look for you?

1353
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:27,858
I have been looking 
for you everywhere.

1354
01:55:28,349 --> 01:55:31,191
Oh, God! 
Where did she go?

1355
01:55:32,511 --> 01:55:35,900
Swamy, where has Shruti gone? 
She is not around.

1356
01:55:39,608 --> 01:55:42,316
I am talking to you, wait there!

1357
01:55:42,608 --> 01:55:44,483
Can't you hear me?

1358
01:55:45,358 --> 01:55:48,430
Shruti is not seen since morning.

1359
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:50,150
Hey, insensitive guy!

1360
01:55:50,849 --> 01:55:53,858
Then say thanks to our family deity.

1361
01:55:55,078 --> 01:55:57,108
What are you even saying, rascal?

1362
01:56:00,227 --> 01:56:04,028
Thank God, at least now He understood 
my situation and feelings.

1363
01:56:04,108 --> 01:56:08,025
Are you thanking God 
since your wife has gone missing?

1364
01:56:08,715 --> 01:56:12,650
It has been six months that we got married, 
she has never been like my wife.

1365
01:56:12,944 --> 01:56:15,191
You have never been 
a husband to her either.

1366
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:20,525
If she starts a secret family with Partha, 
how can I be a husband to her?

1367
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:22,687
Go and check, she must be with him.

1368
01:56:22,767 --> 01:56:23,579
(Slaps)

1369
01:56:26,998 --> 01:56:28,796
(Horn blares)

1370
01:56:32,836 --> 01:56:33,715
(Horn blares)

1371
01:56:37,983 --> 01:56:39,275
Hey, come on out!

1372
01:56:39,904 --> 01:56:41,528
What is it, sir? 
- Come on out, I said!

1373
01:56:41,608 --> 01:56:42,983
First of all, leave my collar.

1374
01:56:43,931 --> 01:56:46,403
Oh, really? You scoundrel, 
what have I ever done to you?

1375
01:56:46,483 --> 01:56:48,983
What have I done, you rascal?

1376
01:56:49,512 --> 01:56:52,320
Are you proud of your 
father's connections and your complexion?

1377
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:55,778
You idiot Swamy, you dissatisfied soul!

1378
01:56:55,858 --> 01:56:59,742
I feel like breaking your legs, but I am 
quiet because you are Shruti's husband.

1379
01:57:07,161 --> 01:57:10,361
Partha! Let my son go! 
- Let my hand go, you rascal!

1380
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:12,918
Let me son go! Get lost!

1381
01:57:12,998 --> 01:57:16,653
Swamy, why are you fighting? 
What's wrong?

1382
01:57:16,733 --> 01:57:18,483
Hope you are all right, Partha. 
- Come on, fight me!

1383
01:57:18,563 --> 01:57:20,986
Yes, everything I have is yours.

1384
01:57:21,066 --> 01:57:27,236
You can't even control your wife 
and you dare to hit my son!

1385
01:57:27,316 --> 01:57:30,931
His dad will get you bashed up! 
- Of course, he will! - Move back!

1386
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:31,917
(Slaps)

1387
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:37,108
Mother, are you really idiot?

1388
01:57:37,404 --> 01:57:39,403
At least, now understand 
my situation and feelings.

1389
01:57:39,483 --> 01:57:42,653
He is the one who misled your 
daughter-in-law, why are you slapping me?

1390
01:57:42,733 --> 01:57:45,566
Hey! - No one understands 
my situation and feelings.

1391
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:51,441
You got a street food vendor 
to hit a software engineer.

1392
01:57:52,066 --> 01:57:53,945
Go to hell! 
Go to hell, everyone!

1393
01:57:54,025 --> 01:57:56,983
Swamy! - Hey lost! 
- You are responsible for everything.

1394
01:57:57,526 --> 01:57:59,900
Partha, let's go home. 
- Aunt, what is all this?

1395
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,941
Partha! 
- Where is Shruti?

1396
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:06,275
Let's go. 
- I didn't see her since morning.

1397
01:58:07,661 --> 01:58:09,983
Partha! 
- Come on then, let's find her.

1398
01:58:10,063 --> 01:58:12,983
Why would you find her? 
How are you related to her?

1399
01:58:13,283 --> 01:58:15,233
Let's go home. 
- Mom, let me go!

1400
01:58:15,675 --> 01:58:18,233
Shruti is an innocent girl, 
what if she harms herself unknowingly?

1401
01:58:19,441 --> 01:58:22,941
Partha, let them do whatever they want. 
- Please let's go and find her.

1402
01:58:24,296 --> 01:58:27,851
The worst case scenario would be 
that she will die, that's it.

1403
01:58:28,189 --> 01:58:30,775
Let her die. How would 
it make any difference to you?

1404
01:58:30,983 --> 01:58:34,820
You just take care of your own family. 
I will see what I have to. - Let's go.

1405
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,568
Her husband doesn't want her, 
no one wants her..

1406
01:58:36,648 --> 01:58:38,525
..her death won't mean 
anything to anyone.

1407
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:57,695
What is this, MES?

1408
01:58:57,775 --> 01:59:01,271
Mother-in-law told me to lock 
myself in the room..

1409
01:59:01,351 --> 01:59:03,567
..and she will make my 
husband concerned for me..

1410
01:59:03,647 --> 01:59:05,816
..so I was quiet.

1411
01:59:08,483 --> 01:59:12,650
Let's go to the restaurant, 
Dilip can't handle it all alone.

1412
01:59:17,013 --> 01:59:18,946
(Car engine starts)

1413
01:59:25,364 --> 01:59:28,445
Please try again.

1414
01:59:30,715 --> 01:59:32,278
Please try again.

1415
01:59:32,358 --> 01:59:33,946
The card is not getting accessed, 
it's my log in time.

1416
01:59:34,026 --> 01:59:35,400
Check what the problem is.

1417
01:59:35,483 --> 01:59:38,066
Excuse me, sir. 
May I know your name? - Guruswamy.

1418
01:59:38,816 --> 01:59:40,608
Can I have your ID, please?

1419
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:44,442
It's my log in time, what.. 
- Please be seated, I will check.

1420
01:59:45,108 --> 01:59:46,941
Sir, only two minutes.

1421
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:56,525
Mr. Guruswamy? 
- Yes.

1422
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,525
I am Pallavi from the HR Department.

1423
01:59:58,716 --> 02:00:00,650
Can I have your laptop, please? 
- Sure.

1424
02:00:06,858 --> 02:00:08,852
Hope this laptop doesn't have 
your personal data.

1425
02:00:08,932 --> 02:00:09,650
No, no. 
- Okay.

1426
02:00:09,733 --> 02:00:12,108
I have my personal laptop for that. 
- All right, Mr. Guruswamy.

1427
02:00:12,188 --> 02:00:14,068
So, you must be aware of 
the cost-optimisation..

1428
02:00:14,148 --> 02:00:15,650
..that's happening across the company.

1429
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:17,858
So, that list has your name.

1430
02:00:18,635 --> 02:00:20,258
If you are ready to put down 
your papers today..

1431
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:22,024
..we'll consider it as a normal exit.

1432
02:00:22,108 --> 02:00:23,947
Otherwise, we will have to 
give you a termination letter..

1433
02:00:24,027 --> 02:00:26,195
..and then don't expect 
any benefits from us.

1434
02:00:26,275 --> 02:00:27,270
Thank you.

1435
02:00:31,323 --> 02:00:33,483
What did you just say? 
Are you kidding me?

1436
02:00:34,188 --> 02:00:36,149
What's your name? 
- I am Pallavi from HR.

1437
02:00:36,566 --> 02:00:39,986
Pallavi, you can't do this. 
I have been working here for three years.

1438
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:42,148
I even got the Best Employee 
award last year.

1439
02:00:42,228 --> 02:00:43,399
Don't you have a heart? 
- Listen, listen..

1440
02:00:43,483 --> 02:00:46,025
I am not authorised to give you 
an extension or something else.

1441
02:00:46,108 --> 02:00:49,358
I am just here to complete 
your exit formalities. - Oh, God!

1442
02:00:49,945 --> 02:00:52,229
You just wait, 
I will call the higher authority.

1443
02:00:52,309 --> 02:00:53,983
Then you can talk to him.

1444
02:00:54,063 --> 02:00:58,108
No use calling anyone. 
- No, I will call. Just wait.

1445
02:00:58,188 --> 02:01:01,153
This is happening as per the contract 
you have signed. - Okay, I agree that.

1446
02:01:01,233 --> 02:01:03,358
Just wait, 
the line is getting connected.

1447
02:01:03,691 --> 02:01:05,580
See, whether or not you have to stay in 
the company..

1448
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,441
..is completely company's decision.

1449
02:01:07,646 --> 02:01:09,653
It's clearly mentioned 
in the contract letter.

1450
02:01:09,733 --> 02:01:12,441
Didn't you read the contract-letter 
before signing it?

1451
02:01:28,242 --> 02:01:30,201
(Phone rings)

1452
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:32,108
Hello?

1453
02:01:34,849 --> 02:01:37,191
What! 
Which hospital?

1454
02:02:15,972 --> 02:02:19,066
Just understand 
where your lives are leading to.

1455
02:02:19,233 --> 02:02:23,191
Why did you want to die 
just because someone fired you?

1456
02:02:23,809 --> 02:02:26,778
Losing a job is 
not like the end of your life.

1457
02:02:26,858 --> 02:02:32,695
The computer is going to yield 
you only money, not peace.

1458
02:02:32,775 --> 02:02:36,403
Learn to identify between 
computers and human beings.

1459
02:02:36,483 --> 02:02:38,733
Learn to love people.

1460
02:02:38,816 --> 02:02:41,649
Look at her face once.

1461
02:02:43,275 --> 02:02:47,900
No one can love you 
as selflessly as her.

1462
02:02:48,187 --> 02:02:51,233
At least, now understand 
who is on your side.

1463
02:03:07,441 --> 02:03:08,816
Drink it, rascal!

1464
02:03:19,525 --> 02:03:21,653
For how long are you 
going to force him?

1465
02:03:21,733 --> 02:03:25,820
I don't want him, I can't take it anymore. 
It's you who have got me caught in this.

1466
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,650
If you are okay with it, 
let me live with you.

1467
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:31,900
If you feel like I am a burden to you, 
let me go. I will go somewhere.

1468
02:03:46,775 --> 02:03:51,653
Actually, it was your name 
in the cost-optimisation list..

1469
02:03:51,733 --> 02:03:54,691
..but I fought for you 
and got Swamy terminated.

1470
02:03:55,441 --> 02:03:58,024
How can I retrain myself 
when he ogles at you in front of me?

1471
02:03:58,566 --> 02:04:00,149
I did it for you.

1472
02:04:01,836 --> 02:04:03,066
Only for you.

1473
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:54,871
Oh, God!

1474
02:04:56,495 --> 02:04:59,578
Are you really going 
away from my son?

1475
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:07,829
Your plan didn't work, 
so I have started a new plan.

1476
02:05:20,703 --> 02:05:22,037
What are you doing here?

1477
02:05:26,995 --> 02:05:28,787
You are still the same, aren't you?

1478
02:05:32,122 --> 02:05:35,579
At least, do you know 
what you are up to?

1479
02:05:40,162 --> 02:05:44,245
How could you believe 
that I love you?

1480
02:05:46,495 --> 02:05:50,995
If you are angry with someone, 
you can hide it behind a smile.

1481
02:05:52,287 --> 02:05:56,287
But you can't hide love 
behind anger for too long.

1482
02:05:57,352 --> 02:05:58,912
Do you know something?

1483
02:05:59,608 --> 02:06:05,329
Whoever wanted to live carefully with me 
are treating me carelessly.

1484
02:06:06,108 --> 02:06:08,797
Your love stands no chance 
in front of my pain.

1485
02:06:08,877 --> 02:06:11,203
You are so egoistic, aren't you?

1486
02:06:11,283 --> 02:06:12,662
You are still arrogant, aren't you?

1487
02:06:12,918 --> 02:06:15,537
You shouldn't let your tongue loose 
just because someone is ready to listen.

1488
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:18,579
Everyone is busy 
with their own work.

1489
02:06:19,446 --> 02:06:22,829
No one has the patience and time 
to care for someone else.

1490
02:06:23,906 --> 02:06:26,037
Everyone is fake here.

1491
02:06:26,338 --> 02:06:29,120
No matter what we do, 
they will find only weakness.

1492
02:06:29,325 --> 02:06:31,787
They try to play games with us 
with that weakness..

1493
02:06:32,136 --> 02:06:34,677
..but only if we entertain it.

1494
02:06:34,757 --> 02:06:36,620
Why do you entertain such people?

1495
02:06:36,983 --> 02:06:38,566
Am I not concerned for you?

1496
02:06:38,906 --> 02:06:40,859
Am I not trying to know how you are?

1497
02:06:41,608 --> 02:06:44,400
Why are you hurting me just because 
someone else was careless towards you?

1498
02:06:45,839 --> 02:06:47,317
I will kill you!

1499
02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:49,691
Let me cry peacefully.

1500
02:06:50,609 --> 02:06:53,108
Everyone made look like a villain.

1501
02:06:53,733 --> 02:06:56,566
Didn't I stay with you 
even after you fooled me?

1502
02:06:56,817 --> 02:06:58,775
Couldn't you understand my love then?

1503
02:06:59,192 --> 02:07:01,734
But what did you do? 
What did you do?

1504
02:07:02,636 --> 02:07:06,192
You left me for Shruti.

1505
02:07:09,405 --> 02:07:10,743
I feel like dying!

1506
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:13,892
(Crying)

1507
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:20,528
If you had let me sleep on your chest 
only once and apologised to me..

1508
02:07:20,608 --> 02:07:22,066
..I would have got convinced.

1509
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:24,108
Where is your partner?

1510
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:26,942
She went back to her village 
with her mother-in-law.

1511
02:07:31,364 --> 02:07:32,528
Great then!

1512
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:36,566
Let's close that stupid restaurant 
and start a posh restaurant!

1513
02:07:36,692 --> 02:07:38,984
Anyway, I have resigned from my job.

1514
02:07:41,283 --> 02:07:43,609
You did great! 
Let's do that!

1515
02:07:46,405 --> 02:07:49,487
Partha, I am not liking it.

1516
02:07:49,567 --> 02:07:52,775
Sister Anu is calling our restaurant stupid 
and you are okay with it.

1517
02:07:52,855 --> 02:07:56,650
Just because your wife came into your arms, 
you are ready to shut the restaurant down.

1518
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:58,942
I am a partner to the restaurant.

1519
02:07:59,136 --> 02:08:02,900
Sister Anu, you can work 
with us if you want.

1520
02:08:03,312 --> 02:08:06,025
Shame on you! 
Did you start lying again?

1521
02:08:06,447 --> 02:08:09,195
She was the one who told me 
that you are not normal..

1522
02:08:09,275 --> 02:08:12,733
..and that I should lie to you 
to convince you.

1523
02:08:14,083 --> 02:08:14,583
I swear!

1524
02:08:14,663 --> 02:08:15,602
(Screams)

1525
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:20,108
MES, what the heck!

1526
02:08:20,358 --> 02:08:22,650
You don't know 
how to talk to your wife.

1527
02:08:22,733 --> 02:08:25,816
You should talk to your wife 
wholeheartedly. - Oh, shut up!

1528
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:31,109
She doesn't understand simple words, 
forgetting understand the feelings.

1529
02:08:32,042 --> 02:08:34,030
Hey, attitude queen!

1530
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:37,191
You are the heroine of my life, 
don't act like a villain.

1531
02:08:37,692 --> 02:08:41,775
If you get angry for every little thing, 
our entire life would fade away.

1532
02:08:42,204 --> 02:08:44,566
I am planning kids.

1533
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,758
Anu, sorry!

1534
02:08:50,109 --> 02:08:55,244
"I followed her till eternity, 
she never looked back.."

1535
02:08:55,324 --> 02:08:59,829
"I called her like it was my duty, 
she never answered.."

1536
02:08:59,909 --> 02:09:04,726
"Oh, my God.."

1537
02:09:04,806 --> 02:09:09,904
"I better die.."

1538
02:09:46,899 --> 02:09:51,245
"You entered my life 
like the sunrise.."

1539
02:09:51,325 --> 02:09:56,186
"You are the heroine 
for my life story.."

1540
02:09:56,542 --> 02:10:01,493
"Your steps are like dance moves, 
your bangles rhythm is like music.."

1541
02:10:01,573 --> 02:10:06,196
"Your words are like a music, 
sing it in my ears.."

1542
02:10:06,276 --> 02:10:10,801
"Be the dance or trance, 
take my heart away.."

1543
02:10:10,881 --> 02:10:15,828
"Oh, my God.."

1544
02:10:16,144 --> 02:10:20,857
"I better die.."

1545
02:10:20,937 --> 02:10:25,506
"Without her, I have no life.."

1546
02:10:25,586 --> 02:10:30,847
"Please understand my pain.."

1547
02:10:52,489 --> 02:10:57,354
"I feel like I have failed 
for the first time.."

1548
02:10:57,434 --> 02:11:02,550
"Like the red signal in the traffic.."

1549
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:07,415
"Like the answer that never flashes  
during the exam.."
