00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,220
<i>The Beauty</i>

2
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,930
We've been waiting for you!
Where the hell were you?

3
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,930
Dad had to leave for London.

4
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,560
Then I had to help mom with some work.

5
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Okay, tell me,
why you guys called me here?

6
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,350
-As you know. We fail every time.
-What?

7
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,640
-I see.
-And you never fail.

8
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,510
So, you want me to fail along with you.

9
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,930
-Why do you always get it wrong?
-No.

10
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
You guys are wrong.

11
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,430
All right, listen to me, this time
we also want to pass.

12
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
-Okay.
-Work hard. Study.

13
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,390
-We have a plan.
-Okay.

14
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,560
The plan is that we'll go on a pilgrimage.

15
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,850
-I see.
-Visit Mother Goddess.

16
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,220
-Okay.
-Seek Her blessings.

17
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,310
-And pass with great grades.
-All hail Mother.

18
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,260
-All hail Mother.
-You see,

19
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,310
you've talked some sense for
the first time.

20
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,060
It's good, go and seek blessings
and expect to pass.

21
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,470
-Visit? We can't visit Her without you.
-I see.

22
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,720
You see, you have a better image
in our families.

23
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,720
-I see.
-For our families, we are useless.

24
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,930
-Yes.
-And if you agree to come with us

25
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,890
then we'll get the permission
just like that.

26
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay, so, you do want to fail me.

27
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,810
-No, man, it's not like that.
-Then? Tell me?

28
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,850
Talking about going to a pilgrimage
does not suit you guys.

29
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,890
-He got us.
-He is our true friend.

30
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,760
-Obviously.
-Rahul, tell him the truth.

31
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,310
-Now, listen.
-Yes.

32
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,970
We are planning a trip to Goa.

33
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Goa? Have you lost your mind?

34
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,010
We have our exams and you want to
go for a trip?

35
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,720
No. I'm not going to Goa with you.

36
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,260
-Hear us out.
-What?

37
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,140
Shraddha and Shikha
are also going with us.

38
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,010
Great! So, you've planned it all.

39
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,060
I don't want to be dragged into this mess.

40
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,310
-Listen...
-No.

41
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,470
-Sorry.
-Hear us out.

42
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,010
We've thought about you too.

43
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,890
-How?
-We've invited your girlfriend, Sweety?

44
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,140
-Sweety.
-Yes. Sweety.

45
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,010
-It's not possible.
-Is it?

46
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,560
Shraddha and Shikha, both are

47
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,220
in Sweety's house to convince
her strict father.

48
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,560
-Now say.
-Really?

49
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
Really.

50
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,930
Please, uncle.

51
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,350
-Please.
-No, it's not possible.

52
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,810
Have you guys gone mad?

53
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,350
You have your exams and you
are talking about a trip.

54
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,390
Uncle, at least hear us out.

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,560
If Sweety goes to pay
a visit to Mother Goddess...

56
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,810
she'll definitely top the college.

57
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,930
Yes, uncle! She'll pass with good grades.

58
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,140
Easier said than done!

59
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,680
Good, no need to study,
just seek blessings and you'll pass.

60
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,310
-Do you think I'm a fool?
-Yes.

61
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,930
-What?
-No, no.

62
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,850
We are trying to tell you that
seeking blessings

63
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,220
can help us with our grades.

64
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,390
And your consent will make
the journey memorable.

65
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,060
Please, uncle. Please.

66
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,060
Dad, please allow me to go.

67
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm not alone. They are with me.

68
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,220
If I go out, I'll get blessings of God,

69
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,260
-and some change in oxygen too.
-What?

70
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,760
So, you've been breathing
carbon-di-oxide here?

71
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,310
What's with the change in oxygen?

72
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,640
No, uncle, you are misunderstanding.

73
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,510
What she meant was going out
can be helpful for a change.

74
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,140
Fresh air will keep her mind fresh
and we can study better.

75
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,760
-Right?
-Yes, right.

76
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,680
Listen. I've never allowed
her to go out of the house alone.

77
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,350
But, she is not alone.

78
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,310
We are her friends.

79
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,930
Dad, please allow.

80
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,390
Okay, but there's a condition.

81
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,180
Promise me you'll take good care
of my daughter.

82
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,720
Uncle, don't worry at all.

83
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,970
Trust us.

84
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay, go seek Mother's blessings.

85
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,720
Rohit will pass anyway.

86
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,720
Why to take him along?

87
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,930
Shit!

88
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,470
Aunt, the thing is, we don't want
Rohit to only pass.

89
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,560
-We want Rohit to top.
-Yes.

90
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,930
And mummy was telling that
Ms. Agarwal has challenged you...

91
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
that her son will top.

92
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,560
I challenge you, this time
my son will be the topper.

93
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,430
Or else, I'll pay for the party next time.

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,260
Okay, if I win, I'll pay
for all the parties ahead.

95
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,510
-Do you accept?
-Yes, I do.

96
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,600
-Aunt, just imagine.
-Yes.

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,060
If Rohit tops...

98
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,140
you will be respected even more
in the society.

99
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,640
I hope you understand.

100
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,890
Aunt, all you need to do is imagine!

101
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,180
Divine blessings is a necessity
to be a topper.

102
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,260
Say yes.

103
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,560
-Fine.
-Yes.

104
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,140
I'll send Rohit with you guys to seek
Mother's blessings.

105
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,220
Thank you.

106
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,260
-Done. Done.
-But, mind you...

107
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
if my son does not top...

108
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,560
if my Rohit does not top...

109
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,470
then you both can forget this address.

110
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,060
-Aunt, don't worry.
-Not at all.

111
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,810
-What are you saying?
-Rohit will top for sure.

112
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,260
Done. Hundred percent.

113
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,510
May the Goddess protect you.

114
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,640
-All hail Mother Goddess.
-All right.

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,220
-All hail Mother Goddess.
-Yes.

116
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,140
-Get beer.
-Yes.

117
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,850
-Go get some.
-Get chilled ones.

118
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,640
-You talk such rubbish.
-Hey, 12 cans of beer.

119
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,310
-How much?
-540.

120
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,430
-Here you go.
-Enough now.

121
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
-Here's the beer.
-I'll drink the most.

122
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
-I'm thrilled.
-Goa is for fun.

123
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,680
-Go help him.
-We'll of course have fun.

124
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,010
Go help him.

125
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,140
-Come on.
-Quick. Quick.

126
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,180
-Give.
-Hold. Hold. One second.

127
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,060
-Who told to get these?
-She did.

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,810
-Okay.
-It's mom's call.

129
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,470
-So, pick it up.
-Come on.

130
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,970
-Hello.
-He's scared.

131
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,260
-Hi, mom.
-How are you, son?

132
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,140
-Great.
-It's mine.

133
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,850
-Where are you?
-What?

134
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,510
What's the location?

135
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
-In the temple.
-In the temple.

136
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,810
-In the temple?
-In the temple.

137
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,220
Great. Then I've called at the right time.

138
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,850
Do me a favour.

139
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,810
Take a picture of the Goddess
and sent to me.

140
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,930
Okay.

141
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,260
I'll also pay a visit to Her
from right here.

142
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,810
-Yes. I'll send.
-Two plus two is four.

143
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,350
-Now what?
-Mother wants the Goddess's photo.

144
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,930
Goddess's photo.

145
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,310
This is what you get
when you say temple.

146
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,140
-I'm always stuck!
-Do you have another place?

147
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,260
I've found the goddess.

148
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
How to send her the picture!

149
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,100
You want a photo, right? We'll get it.

150
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,060
-Hold this.
-We'll arrange the photograph.

151
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,180
-Come on, get down quickly.
-What happened?

152
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,220
-It's a baby boy.
-Wait. Wait.

153
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,390
Tell me. Where are they taking her?

154
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,560
What happened?

155
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,510
-Start.
-Start.

156
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,350
What are you doing?

157
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,390
-What's happening?
-Quiet.

158
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,970
-Is anyone going to tell me?
-Quiet. Quiet.

159
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,970
-What are you doing?
-That's it.

160
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,010
-Extend your hand. Hold this.
-Stay quiet.

161
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,430
Hands like this.
Apply the <i>bindi.</i>

162
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,970
-Take off the glasses.
-Hold on.

163
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,100
What the heck.

164
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,180
-Hold on.
-Yes.

165
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,010
Smile.

166
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,470
-Move.
-Sorry.

167
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,140
Sent.

168
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,850
-Gone.
-What did you send?

169
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,890
What are you doing?

170
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,680
-Your mummy wanted to see the Goddess.
-Yes.

171
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,470
-We've sent her the picture.
-What do you mean?

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,310
She is our Goddess. We clicked her
picture and sent it.

173
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,970
But, my mother knows Sweety!

174
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,970
Thanks, for the trouble!

175
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,510
-Listen.
-You're enemies.

176
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,060
-I'll not leave you today.
-Wait.

177
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,850
Run.

178
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,760
Wait.

179
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,260
Take that.

180
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,510
-It hit them.
-Oh God.

181
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,220
-Not us. Him.
-He did it.

182
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,600
-He hurled the shoe.
-That guy.

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,850
Get him.

184
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,600
Get him.

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,260
Run. Run.

186
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,060
Don't leave him.

187
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,060
-Actually...
-No, not even a word!

188
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,640
You both have caused problems.

189
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,100
You lie and bring me to Goa.

190
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,060
Then you turn my girlfriend into
a Goddess and send it to my mother.

191
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,510
I'll be doomed if my mother finds out.

192
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,850
-Your mother...
-Will not say a word.

193
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,010
Of course. Now we couldn't go to a temple
and take a picture, right?

194
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,310
We acted according to the situation.

195
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,180
Just chill. We have come to Goa.

196
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,720
Go around. Party. Enjoy.

197
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,390
Yes. Chill.

198
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,470
Now I have only one shoe left.

199
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,890
Because of them I've
been walking barefoot all day.

200
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,470
Shoes, right?

201
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,060
You'll get it.

202
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,350
Don't worry about shoes.

203
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,640
Okay, how?

204
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,470
It suits you perfectly, sir.

205
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,010
-What's the price?
-It's around 11999 rupees.

206
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,100
I mean, around 12 thousand rupees.

207
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,100
-You, sure?
-Yes.

208
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,180
I see.

209
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,100
No problem. Don't worry.
We'll give you a discount.

210
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,100
Yes, sir? What shoes are you looking for?

211
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,930
Show me some good sports shoes.

212
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,970
Shoe size?

213
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,810
-It's number 10.
-Okay.

214
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,010
-Check this out.
-Show.

215
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,600
Here. See this.

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,220
-How much is this for?
-You'll get the size.

217
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,260
Yes, right.

218
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,810
-Here.
-What's the price?

219
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,310
-This is for 8... 8999 rupees.
-Yes.

220
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,680
It seems nice. 8000 rupees.

221
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,100
This is fine. Do this. Pack it.

222
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,390
-Saru, pack this.
-It's the last pair.

223
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,470
Really? Sir, do this. Take off the shoes.

224
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,220
He has selected it.

225
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,970
No. I like it. I'll take it.

226
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,470
So, you take it. You keep it.

227
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,760
Sir, take it off and give it to him.

228
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,640
What are you saying?
I selected it first.

229
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,390
So I'll take this shoe.

230
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,970
I'm already wearing it.
So, I've already taken it.

231
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,060
Look, who finalised it first. I did.

232
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,010
-So I like this shoe.
-But...

233
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,850
-You decided between yourselves.
-The decision has been made.

234
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,470
-I'll take it.
-Listen. You don't understand.

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,430
I've taken it. Got it?

236
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,060
You're not trying to understand me.
I finalised this shoe first.

237
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,010
-Do this. Choose something else.
-He's a pile on.

238
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,850
Don't you get it?
Crazy man. I've taken this shoe./?

239
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,430
Am I crazy for you?

240
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,680
I told you I have taken it.

241
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,430
-Choose something else.
-Be respectful. And listen to me.

242
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,890
I've taken it. Don't get on my nerves.

243
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,260
You are not trying to understand
that I've taken this shoe.

244
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,010
Are you crazy?

245
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,060
-You want a shoe.
-Of course. Or else why am I here?

246
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,510
-You want a shoe, right?
-Why else am I sitting here?

247
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,350
Take this.

248
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,510
Take this.

249
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,970
Take this!

250
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,260
-Take this.
-Stop them.

251
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,060
Wait. I'll show you.

252
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,810
Stop. You rascal.

253
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,140
Good riddance.

254
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,010
Good riddance? They fooled us.

255
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,220
They took their shoes
as well as the shop's shoe.

256
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,430
-What are you saying?
-Yes.

257
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,720
-Catch them. Thief. Thief.
-Catch them.

258
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,310
Here's your shoes.

259
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,350
New shoes.

260
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,930
It's for you.

261
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,890
-Where did you get them?
-From the fish market.

262
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,560
We got it from a shoe shop.

263
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,140
Look, we've got you new shoes now.

264
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,100
I don't think you can afford
these shoes.

265
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,850
What do you think, we are thieves?

266
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,680
The shoes are expensive.

267
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,810
I sense trouble looking at these shoes.

268
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,260
What the hell, Rahul.

269
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,470
You don't trust us?

270
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
We got shoes for you.

271
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,640
-I know.
-Okay. Don't cry.

272
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
You got it by tricking someone.

273
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,720
-Where did you steal it from?
-Be happy with your new pair.

274
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,720
-Dad, my dad is calling.
-Parents and their phone calls./?

275
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,970
-Hello.
-Hello. Yes, papa.

276
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,510
-Sweety.
-Hello.

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,850
Where are you?

278
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,390
Me? At the pool.

279
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,810
In the pool?

280
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,930
-I mean I'm standing on a bridge.
-What is she saying?

281
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,600
Waiting for a cab.

282
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,220
Okay. Okay.
What's wrong with your voice?

283
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,680
Well, I have ulcers in my mouth.

284
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,810
Oh dear, take care of yourself.

285
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,100
Yes, papa.

286
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,430
I'm taking good care of myself.

287
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,720
Okay.

288
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,810
-Dear, tell me.
-Yes, papa.

289
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,430
Is Bedi's son with you?

290
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,060
No. Rohit is not with me.

291
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,430
This thing is, since you've left,

292
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,930
his windows are shut.

293
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,890
I have a doubt that he is with you.

294
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,430
-Oh shit.
-No, papa, he's not.

295
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,890
Listen, dear,

296
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,220
if I found out that he's with you,

297
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,430
then trust me,
I swear I'll kill both of you.

298
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,720
Come back quickly.

299
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,310
Shit!

300
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,720
I think my dad knows everything.

301
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,560
He has a doubt that I'm with Rohit.

302
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,260
-Now what?
-Oh shit.

303
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,760
-Now? Party of course.
-Yes.

304
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,640
-Come on.
-Cheers.

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
-Cheers.
-Yes.

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,220
-How was your journey?
-It was great fun.

348
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,600
-I feel blessed.
-Really.

349
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,760
-Even I got to see Mother Sweety.
-Mother Sweety is such a great mother.

350
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,060
-Mother, she...
-Son, I know everything.

351
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,220
Is it?

352
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,890
Your friends Rahul and
Arjun were here the other day.

353
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,680
-Yes.
-They were convincing me.

354
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,180
They were acting like idiots,
so, I knew something was fishy.

355
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,810
This time, you left,

356
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,060
but, from now on, you'll only study.

357
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,100
I promise mom, I won't go.

358
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,260
And yes, those two friends should not
be visible near you.

359
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,180
Mom, don't worry at all.

360
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,390
-I swear.
-Promise?

361
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes. Done.

362
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,600
As it is, I've challenged Mrs. Agarwal.

363
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
I see.

364
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,430
My son will top.

365
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,180
I will. I'll study now.
Let's go inside.

366
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,510
-My dear mother. You're so nice.
-Enough.

367
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,010
<i>When is she going to come?</i>

368
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,510
<i>Goddess please grant me blessings.</i>

369
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh God.

370
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,390
This boy has nothing to do.

371
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,470
He's always staring out of the window.

372
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,760
I feel I'm gonna kill him someday.

373
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,310
I swear.

374
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,680
Yes. Finally.

375
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,180
He's gone. Yes. Yes.

376
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,260
Hell! He's back.

377
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,510
Hey, what are you doing here?

378
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,140
Papa, I... I had a headache.

379
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,890
So, I came here to
breathe in some fresh air.

380
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,720
What's with the excuse of oxygen
every time?

381
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,350
You seem to always need fresh air.

382
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,100
And don't keep the windows open.

383
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,970
Outside dust will enter
and you may fall sick.

384
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,180
-Okay?
-Okay, papa.

385
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,850
Go, my dear. Study.

386
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,970
I'll destroy Bedi one day.

387
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,970
-Rohit.
-Yes, mother.

388
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,430
I've kept milk on the dining table.
Have it.

389
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,720
I will.

390
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm going for the kitty party.

391
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,430
-Study hard. Okay?
-Okay.

392
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,640
The house is unlocked. Mind you.

393
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
-Morning.
-Yes?

394
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,760
Is sir at home?

395
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,060
Papa has gone out.

396
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,390
We are from the pest control.
We've come to see the house.

397
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,810
-No one's at home.
-You're there, sir.

398
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,760
We've come from far.
We'll not have to come again.

399
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,180
-Hope it won't take too long.
-It will take just 5 minutes.

400
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,010
We just want to get an estimate.
That's it.

401
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,260
-All right, come.
-Thank you.

402
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,100
-It's a huge house.
-Yes.

403
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,600
Two rooms upstairs. Two downstairs.
And there's kitchen.

404
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,060
-We'll have to take a look.
-Sure.

405
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,390
-Pappu, go upstairs.
-Okay.

406
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,140
-You survey downstairs.
-Okay.

407
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Check properly. Don't miss anything.

408
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,390
Pest control is necessary.

409
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,720
-You need it every six months.
-I see.

410
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,140
Or the furniture decays.

411
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,680
Madam must be at home.

412
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,140
If you say,
I'll give you the estimate right here.

413
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,930
No. She is not at home.
She has gone out.

414
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,350
-She'll come by evening.
-Okay. Okay.

415
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,510
-Checked?
-Yes.

416
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,140
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

417
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,140
There is a lot to be done.
We'll need 4-5 men more.

418
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,600
We'll need 4-5 men more.

419
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay. Then I'll give
the estimate to sir tomorrow.

420
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,260
-Okay.
-Okay? See you.

421
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,600
You?

422
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,100
Yes.

423
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,890
-Are you fine?
-Why are you here?

424
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,180
Answer my question!

425
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,760
Rahul... what do you want?

426
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,390
You bookworm. You forgot.
India has a match today.

427
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,970
My family won't let me watch it at home.

428
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,680
I told them, I came to study.

429
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,560
I won't go without
watching the full match.

430
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,140
Rahul. Look,
you're used to failing. Not me.

431
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,600
And if mother finds out,
she'll be upset. Leave.

432
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,760
Son, I know aunt has gone out.

433
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,390
Let me watch bit of the match. I'll go.

434
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,640
-What's the problem?
-No. No match. Leave.

435
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,850
What kind of a friend are you?

436
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,720
Your friend is here.
Offer him tea or coffee.

437
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,470
You're not offering me even water.
Go get water.

438
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,850
Get it, buddy. Go.

439
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,390
<i>That'll be four too.
There is nobody behind leg.</i>

440
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,510
<i>Long leg is very, very fine.</i>

441
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,640
<i>It's edged. Dhoni has caught it.
He drops very few.</i>

442
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,430
<i>And yet another ball
from Mohammad Shami</i>

443
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
<i>that I think had the batsman
uncertain of which way it was moving.</i>

444
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,720
<i>This is...</i>

445
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,810
Hey... Hey... What's your problem?

446
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,970
Have water and get lost from here.

447
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,810
It was such an interesting match.
You switched it off.

448
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
I have my exams.

449
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,310
And I don't intend to fail
for five years like you.

450
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,220
Please go. I want to study.

451
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,010
Rohit, I want to watch this match.

452
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,760
I'll watch it on mute.
You'll not have any disturbance.

453
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,260
I swear. There are only
five overs remaining.

454
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,510
Let me watch it.

455
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,890
Okay. Watch just five
overs and then leave.

456
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,220
Don't worry, I'll manage.
Give me the remote.

457
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,350
Go and study in the bedroom. Very good.

458
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,640
<i>This is an absolutely
top spell from the young man.</i>

459
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,510
Yes.

460
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,510
<i>And he has gone through him.
That is an absolutely beauty.</i>

461
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,430
-I had great fun in Goa.
-I too had fun.

462
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,470
But now, I feel like going to London.

463
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,970
Don't worry, we're gonna travel
the whole world.

464
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,390
Don't get excited, just take me to London.

465
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,140
Sure. Promise.

466
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,470
We'll now breathe the oxygen of London.

467
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,470
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

468
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,600
<i>Take me to London</i>

469
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,060
<i>Take me to London</i>

470
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,930
<i>Take me to London</i>

471
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,140
<i>Take me to London</i>

472
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,390
<i>I want to watch cinema with you</i>

473
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,640
<i>I'll have food in Paris</i>

474
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,310
<i>I'll have a blast. This is what I feel</i>

475
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,180
<i>Take me to London</i>

476
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,680
<i>Take me to London</i>

477
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,560
<i>Take me to London</i>

478
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,140
<i>Take me to London</i>

479
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,470
<i>My heart pounds, it tells me</i>

480
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,720
<i>You and me walking on a cold street</i>

481
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>I'm a colourful bouquet</i>

482
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,890
<i>I'm more than a match for a hundred</i>

483
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,100
<i>I'm more than a match for a hundred</i>

484
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,600
<i>I'm more than a match for a hundred</i>

485
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,510
<i>Don't look here and there</i>

486
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,850
<i>Just prepare to leave</i>

487
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,010
<i>Just prepare to leave</i>

488
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,220
<i>Just prepare to leave</i>

489
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,260
<i>The entire territory should be of love</i>

490
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,430
<i>There should be no worry or concern</i>

491
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,810
<i>Let's make love that
Leaves everyone stunned</i>

492
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,260
<i>This is what I feel</i>

493
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,220
<i>Take me to London</i>

494
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,680
<i>Take me to London</i>

495
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,600
<i>Take me to London</i>

496
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,260
<i>Take me to London</i>

497
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,760
<i>The woman of my dreams
She was my queen</i>

498
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,310
<i>A castle in the mountain tops
Was her dream</i>

499
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,220
<i>Looking at sunlight with the side of
My pocket, give it to you later</i>

500
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,510
<i>In the form of a locket</i>

501
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,010
<i>I'll go to Buckingham palace.
Shake hands with the queen's guard</i>

502
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,180
<i>Shake hands with the guard</i>

503
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,850
<i>Shake hands with the guard</i>

504
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,600
<i>I'll go to the river port
And gorge on fish and chips</i>

505
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,810
<i>I'll gorge on fish and chips</i>

506
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,720
<i>I'll gorge on fish and chips</i>

507
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,100
<i>I'll lay down in a park</i>

508
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
<i>I'll take a picture of the Big Ben</i>

509
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,430
<i>I'll take one selfie after the other</i>

510
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,970
<i>This is what I feel</i>

511
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,810
<i>Take me to London</i>

512
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,220
<i>Take me to London</i>

513
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,220
<i>Take me to London</i>

514
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,470
<i>Take me to London</i>

515
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,930
<i>Let's rock it
Let's forget all the worries</i>

516
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,810
<i>Chuck the worries. Let's rock London</i>

517
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,720
<i>Hey, just make it feel the groove</i>

518
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,470
<i>Take me to London</i>

519
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,970
<i>Take me to London</i>

520
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,810
<i>Take me to London</i>

521
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,350
<i>Take me to London</i>

522
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,220
<i>Take me to London</i>

523
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,720
<i>Take me to London</i>

524
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,600
<i>Take me to London</i>

525
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,010
<i>Take me to London</i>

526
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,930
<i>Take me to London</i>

527
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,220
<i>Take me to London</i>

528
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,640
-Rahul.
-Yes.

529
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,430
-How many overs done?
-Just two as of now.

530
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,720
-It's a drink's break.
-Just two overs?

531
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,810
Is it a match or what?

532
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,310
Firstly this rain and
moreover he is yelling.

533
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>It's a drizzle.
The umpires say that's enough.</i>

534
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,470
<i>And off we go.</i>

535
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,720
<i>Are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?</i>

536
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,140
What were you doing with the pillow?

537
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,810
Have you gone mad?
Is this your match?

538
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,850
Thanks for ruining the mood.

539
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,760
Rain interrupted the match.
So, I switched to another channel.

540
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,850
Not another channel?
You were doing something else.

541
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,430
Tell me, why the pillow?

542
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,640
Have you gone mad?
Get out, you, jerk.

543
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,970
The rain must've stopped.
Let's watch the match.

544
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,470
To hell with the match.

545
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,680
-Go.
-But...

546
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,760
Mother is back. I'm doomed.

547
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,220
Mom's here. she'll kill me if
she finds out you are here.

548
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,430
It's okay. Tell her that
I came back to return your books.

549
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I'll save you. Go, open the door, now.

550
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,260
Go. Go.

551
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,930
Oh. The list of my problems have no end,
One side I have him and now this!

552
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,390
-Rahul.
-How are you?

553
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,260
-Come in.
-Coming.

554
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,260
-Where were you?
-What are you doing here?

555
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,430
-How are you?
-Great.

556
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,720
-Rajan. Why have you come here?
-Hey.

557
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,260
It means you improvised.

558
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,010
-Tell me. How are you?
-Great.

559
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,890
-Why are you here?
-I'm here to give something.

560
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,640
Aunt had asked for medicine
for knee pain.

561
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,390
So, I've got this oil for her.

562
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,850
Massage it on the knee.

563
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,260
Here.
By the way, where is aunt?

564
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,430
She's not at home.
You've given the oil, fine.

565
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,100
This man is behaving so rude.

566
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,970
I just entered your house,
at least let me sit for few minutes.

567
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,760
Go and get something for me to eat.

568
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,760
-Go.
-There is nothing. Leave.

569
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,220
Look, he is rude.

570
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,760
-Tell him.
-He is mad.

571
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,310
Aunt has called me here.
Why are you stressed?

572
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,850
Go get something to eat.
Or should I go?

573
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,810
I have exams tomorrow.
And you guys have come to disturb me.

574
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,850
He thinks we are here to disturb him.

575
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,930
Are you getting it or not?
Answer now!

576
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,430
Move. I'll take it from the fridge.

577
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,760
-Very good.
-At least you can leave.

578
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,100
I'll go with him, right?

579
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,970
Wow. There's milk here.

580
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,140
Hey... That's my milk.

581
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,350
Your milk?

582
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,600
I mean my mother left the milk for me.

583
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,470
This is friendship, don't worry.

584
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,350
What's going on?

585
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,430
Delicious.

586
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,140
Wow, look, I can see my favourite
cake here too.

587
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,560
-Is it a cake?
-Yes.

588
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,760
-Then bring it here.
-Yes, I'm coming.

589
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,680
-Mom's back.
-Your mom...

590
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,470
Don't worry, we came here
to deliver the oil.

591
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,890
Don't worry at all.

592
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,850
-Come on. Let's open the door.
-Yes.

593
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,850
Don't worry. Here.
Enjoy the cake.

594
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,350
I'll convince aunt. Okay.

595
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,510
-Come on.
-Come.

596
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,640
Tell her that you came just now.

597
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,760
-Are you mad?
-You see.

598
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
Idiot.

599
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,760
-It's a girl.
-Girl?

600
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,810
Yes.

601
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,350
-She is hot.
-It's a girl.

602
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,430
-Rohit. It's a girl.
-Girl?

603
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,100
-Girl.
-Yes, a girl.

604
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,430
Who is this girl?
Who could she be?

605
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,510
-Move.
-Hey...

606
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,640
I wonder who she is.

607
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,100
-Hi.
-Hi.

608
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,220
I'm Haseena.

609
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,350
Salesgirl.

610
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,140
Can I come inside?

611
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,100
-Yes. Sure.
-Come in.

612
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,850
-You can't come inside. Hey...
-Come in.

613
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,060
Thanks.

614
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,010
<i>Yeah, girl, yay!</i>

615
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,430
<i>Fly, girl, yay.</i>

616
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,430
But... wait...
Listen...

617
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,930
<i>Fly, girl, yay!</i>

618
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,390
By the way, is there no female here?

619
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,260
No. There is no female in this house?

620
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,850
No problem. I have products
for gents too.

621
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,350
-Show.
-Please show.

622
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,390
Sir, our company is about to
to launch a new deodorant.

623
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,390
It's market price is 160 rupees only.

624
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,220
But before launching our
company is running a special offer

625
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:32,180
wherein we're going door to door
and offering it for 65 rupees only.

626
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,810
That's not it. If you buy
two deodorants like this one

627
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,640
then it will cost you just 110.

628
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,970
We don't want.

629
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,220
-We don't want it at all.
-We want.

630
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,560
-What are you doing?
-Quiet.

631
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,850
Try it.

632
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,600
-What are you doing?
-Wow. Try. Try.

633
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,350
You'll be in heaven.

634
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,930
-It's good.
-Too good.

635
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,180
Try it out.

636
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,470
Won't you try?

637
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,720
No. I don't want.

638
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,140
-Okay.
-We want.

639
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,640
-We don't want.
-What are you looking at?

640
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,220
What other stuff do you have?

641
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,430
I have perfumes, wrist watches.

642
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,100
And razors. And also condoms
of international quality.

643
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,390
-Condoms?
-Yes.

644
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,510
You can use condoms at any time.

645
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,350
-Yes.
-No condoms.

646
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
-No. No.
-Then show.

647
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,850
-Hey.
-Wait. I'll show.

648
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,140
Oops. Ouch.

649
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,970
-Your stuff fell.
-My stuff.

650
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,510
<i>Fill it up with that.</i>

651
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,560
Here's your deodorant.

652
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,010
-Where did it go?
-It slid inside.

653
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,010
Right there.

654
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,390
Yes. Right there.

655
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,850
Oh my God.

656
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,810
What happened?

657
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,470
It's way too inside.

658
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,310
We'll have to slide in
something long to remove it.

659
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,600
Then slide it in. A long thing.

660
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,890
-Rajan.
-Yes.

661
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,180
Get me the broom.

662
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,180
-The deodorant slid inside.
-Inside of what?

663
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,390
The deodorant slid under the cupboard.

664
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,600
Come here.

665
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,760
-I'll not leave you.
-Move it.

666
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,180
Move. Let me.

667
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,810
-Hey.
-Rascal.

668
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,350
-Here's the broom. Sweep.
-What?

669
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,430
What are you doing?

670
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,510
Here, your deodorant.

671
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,180
Hold this. Here you go.

672
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,010
Your deodorant.

673
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,970
Thank you so much.

674
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,720
You had to take much trouble
because of me.

675
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,560
-No. No.
-No trouble at all.

676
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,140
We must find a solution
to every problem, right?

677
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,390
Yes. So you guys are
buying the deodorant, right?

678
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,640
Yes. I'll buy two.

679
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,970
Two for me too.

680
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,760
And won't you take?

681
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,310
No, no. I use branded stuff only.

682
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,060
Sir, once it enters the market,
it will be like branded only.

683
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,470
-I don't want.
-Okay.

684
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,100
-Ask her to leave.
-What?

685
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,100
-What are you doing?
-What's your problem?

686
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,220
-Leave it.
-See. See.

687
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,760
Man!

688
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,760
-Sir, these two are yours.
-Thank you.

689
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,060
And these two are yours.

690
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Thank you.

691
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,100
-Sir, the money.
-Just a second.

692
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,260
Here you go.

693
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,970
Is this amount from both of you?

694
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,680
-Yes, you are right.
-No, deduct my share.

695
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,470
You pay for your stuff.

696
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,760
I forgot my wallet.
You pay. I'll pay you tomorrow.

697
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,310
Do this. Take for both of us.

698
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,760
Okay fine.

699
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,930
-She is awesome.
-Tell her to go.

700
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,970
Okay. I'll leave now.

701
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
-Bye.
-Keep visiting.

702
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,850
Yes.

703
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,390
-Thank God she is going.
-Bye.

704
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,890
She's hell of a salesgirl. Seriously.

705
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,970
Listen, you two can follow her.

706
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,680
-We'll go. Don't worry.
-What's your problem?

707
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,720
Mother...

708
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,100
-She fell.
-Ouch.

709
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,310
-What happened?
-Oh God. What happened?

710
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,350
-My leg.
-Darn it. Her leg is injured.

711
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,600
-She is hurt.
-Seems like she is hurt badly.

712
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
-My knee.
-Now what?

713
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,720
Don't worry. Please, come here.

714
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,680
-Come.
-Get up.

715
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,970
-Easy.
-Easy.

716
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,810
-The poor girl is hurt.
-Oh no.

717
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,180
-She is badly hurt.
-Yes.

718
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,220
Careful.

719
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,220
Ouch.

720
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,930
-She is hurt.
-Badly.

721
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,930
Let me see.
Looks like you're hurt badly.

722
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,260
Yes, everything will be fine.

723
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,060
-The rascal is flirting.
-Rajan, the knee is not there. It's here.

724
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,100
Oh sorry.

725
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,010
Do you have a spray or cream in the house?

726
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,100
Spray?

727
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,560
Yes. Out with the oil I brought
for your mother.

728
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,720
-That's my mother's oil.
-Your mother's oil.

729
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,350
I'll get it for your mother later.
Where is it?

730
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,100
-What are you doing?
-Here. Massage this.

731
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,260
-You'll be fine.
-Listen. Let me massage.

732
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,850
How can she massage herself?

733
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,680
<i>-I got the oil. And he's enjoying.</i>

734
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,470
Enough. I feel better now.

735
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,970
-It was relieving, wasn't it?
-Yes.

736
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,220
Look, your leg is fine now.
Now, please leave.

737
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,970
And listen. You two also follow her out.

738
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,100
-Yes. We'll also go.
-Yes.

739
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,600
Come. Please.

740
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,470
Ouch. I'm unable to get up.

741
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,060
-Is my leg broken?
-No, no. How is that possible?

742
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,390
How can anyone's leg break
from a minor fall like that?

743
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,810
-It can break. Of course it can.
-Will such a cute girl lie?

744
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,970
You keep quiet.

745
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,640
If you don't mind.

746
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,810
If I lay down with my legs stretched
out then I'll get some relief.

747
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,810
Stretch it out.
You two also stretch with her.

748
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,510
-What an idea.
-I was also thinking the same.

749
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,100
-I was kidding.
-Thank you so much.

750
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,260
-Stretch it out.
-Yes. Stretch it out.

751
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,010
Not here.
Stretch it in the bedroom inside.

752
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,350
-Stretch it there.
-Come on. Come on.

753
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,470
Lay down there. Come. Come.

754
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,010
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Yes. Sure. Come. Come.

755
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,600
-Easy. Easy. Get up.
-Be careful.

756
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,640
What are you doing?

757
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,470
Ouch.

758
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,310
-Poor girl is unable to get up.
-It is paining.

759
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,010
Come. I'll take you. Come.

760
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,930
Come. Come.

761
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,970
-Move. Move.
-Move. Move.

762
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,760
-Where are you taking her?
-Come on.

763
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,810
Now stretch your legs inside comfortably.

764
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,680
-You guys are so sweet.
-You'll be fine.

765
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,970
I'm doomed.

766
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,760
Thank you.

767
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,010
Now what do I do?

768
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,510
If you don't mind.

769
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,640
My bag is lying outside. Will you get it?

770
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,180
-Yes. Right away.
-Thank you.

771
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,100
Enough.

772
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,260
-Easy.
-Ouch.

773
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,640
That's enough. It's okay.

774
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,390
-Now let me rest for a while.
-We'll come after some time.

775
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,390
-Okay?
-Please.

776
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,970
-Let's go.
-Come on. Come on.

777
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:07,850
Okay.

778
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:10,680
-Wait. Wait. Where are you going?
-Have you guys gone mad?

779
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,970
It's my mom's room.
What if mother comes?

780
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,970
-You mother...
-If she comes he'll say that...

781
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,720
she is his cousin.
She came along to give the oil.

782
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,640
Great. As if it was 50 gallons of oil
for it required two people to deliver it.

783
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,970
Stop fooling around. And get her out.

784
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,100
I mean the girl is smart.

785
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,890
He is right. She is very smart.

786
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,560
Didn't you see? How she was gesturing
to us using her stuff as an excuse?

787
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,220
-Yes. And what was she saying?
-What?

788
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,890
-You could need condom anytime.
-Say.

789
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,010
It means the chick
is pretending on purpose.

790
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,970
-Yes.
-Then get her out immediately.

791
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,390
Why aren't you trying to understand?

792
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,810
We can share this cream.

793
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,180
He is absolutely right.

794
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,720
What rubbish.

795
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,140
This is my house.
Not a brothel.

796
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,510
Why don't you understand?
Listen. Come here.

797
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,260
She has herself come to us to be had.
We just have to have her.

798
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,430
But what if mother comes?

799
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,060
-Your mother...
-Where is she?

800
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,430
-To a kitty party.
-So she'll come late.

801
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,720
-We'll be done by then.
-Yes.

802
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,260
Yes. It won't take us too long.

803
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,310
All right.
If she agrees then I'll go first.

804
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,720
Very good.

805
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,430
Isn't your mother going to come now?

806
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,600
Okay. Do this. You guys stay here.

807
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,640
-I'll go convince her.
-Go. Go. Go.

808
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,350
How are you feeling now?

809
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,260
How are you? All right?

810
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,390
Did I disturb you?

811
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,350
Ouch.

812
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,310
Don't get up. Don't get up.

813
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,350
Are you fine?

814
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,060
Don't mind but can I ask you something?

815
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,060
Go ahead.

816
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,510
You're so gorgeous. So hot.

817
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,140
So why do you this job
of an ordinary salesgirl?

818
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,510
You can get any job, isn't it?

819
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,100
I'll get a job. And in fact, I did.

820
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,060
But as you know. In today's world...

821
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,100
people expect other things
from a young and beautiful girl.

822
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,760
I had been for an interview
a few weeks ago.

823
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,890
Hi, sir. I'm Pooja.

824
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,220
I'm the worshipper.

825
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,100
Just joking.

826
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,930
Sir, here's my profile and certificates.

827
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,220
I can see.

828
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,560
I have certificates of some
other activities too.

829
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,890
I can see.

830
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,510
-I've done MBA.
-I can see.

831
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,850
Where are you looking, sir?

832
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,430
At what's visible.

833
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,720
You're a file from head to toe.

834
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,850
Just joking.

835
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,010
Okay tell me.

836
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,430
What package do you expect?

837
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,640
-Sir, no demands.
-Oh no.

838
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,010
You should get more than expectation.

839
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,970
You'll just have to please our clients.

840
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,100
That will be duty, sir.

841
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,720
That's too good. Too cute.

842
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,100
Before that, you'll have to please me.

843
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,180
-Sir, I didn't understand.
-Let me explain.

844
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,850
Come.

845
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,180
Sit here.

846
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,430
From today you're my lap's top.

847
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,470
What?

848
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,600
This time not joking.

849
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,930
Come. Come on.

850
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,510
<i>I won't be getting what I want here.</i>

851
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,010
<i>I had imagined I would convince the girl.</i>

852
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,930
<i>But the girl is extremely dangerous.</i>

853
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,890
-What happened?
-Nothing. Nothing.

854
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,510
You should quit jobs at such places.

855
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,310
You shouldn't work for such people.

856
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,930
I would've killed him.

857
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,600
In today's world good people are rare.

858
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,010
For example...

859
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,390
If I had got injured somewhere else.
In someone else's house

860
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,060
and I would be in his bedroom like this

861
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,760
then I wonder what
all they would've done to me.

862
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,760
But you guys.
You guys are not like that at all.

863
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,510
You guys are very sweet.

864
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,260
<i>You can't even imagine
how rascally we are.</i>

865
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,760
Hello. What happened?

866
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,720
Yes. Yes. You are absolutely right.

867
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,560
-Can I say something?
-Sure.

868
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:05,060
You're so hot.
Anyone would become promiscuous?

869
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,560
Did you?

870
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,100
You want the truth?

871
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,470
I really like truth.

872
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,930
Hey... Hey... It's okay.

873
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,970
Please relax.

874
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,180
I'll massage your knee.

875
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,970
-No, no. Thanks.
-Let me. You'll feel really good.

876
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,560
<i>Don't stop me like that</i>

877
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,560
<i>Let me come close</i>

878
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,310
<i>Don't stop me like that</i>

879
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,310
<i>Let me come close</i>

880
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,390
<i>Let me become a part of you</i>

881
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:24,720
<i>Stop a little
The mystery still remains</i>

882
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:29,390
<i>Let me explain myself</i>

883
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:34,310
<i>I'm afraid of your refusal</i>

884
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:40,220
<i>I hope this night does not end</i>

885
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,560
<i>Don't stop me like that</i>

886
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,600
<i>Let me come close</i>

887
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,930
<i>Let me become a part of you</i>

888
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,100
<i>Your loyalty says don't make a mistake</i>

889
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:21,720
<i>There must be distance between us now</i>

890
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:27,600
<i>Silence, loneliness</i>

891
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,220
<i>Let us cross all boundaries</i>

892
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:37,260
<i>Have patience, my love</i>

893
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:44,220
<i>I hope this night doesn't end</i>

894
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,600
<i>Don't stop me like that</i>

895
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,350
<i>Let me come close</i>

896
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:55,970
<i>Let me become a part of you</i>

897
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:29,890
<i>My wet body burns like fire
In the rains</i>

898
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:35,850
<i>Something happens to me
When I look into your heart</i>

899
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:41,560
<i>My wet body burns like fire
In the rains</i>

900
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,260
<i>Something happens to me
When I look into your heart</i>

901
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:52,970
<i>Let me stamp my love
On your lips with my lips</i>

902
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,970
<i>Let me lose my heart to you</i>

903
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:03,680
<i>Don't say such things to me</i>

904
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,930
<i>I hope this night doesn't end</i>

905
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,260
<i>Don't stop me like that</i>

906
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,140
<i>Let me come close</i>

907
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:21,260
<i>Let me become a part of you</i>

908
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:27,680
<i>Let me become a part of you</i>

909
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,560
What do you think?

910
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,350
Will he do the job?

911
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,310
Rajan is good for nothing.

912
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,470
He can just talk. But he is useless.

913
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,680
I have always said this. He is fake.

914
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,260
You bet. We are building
castles in the air.

915
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,640
And he'll come out with a long face.

916
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,680
You're right.

917
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,890
-Here he comes.
-Hey.

918
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,470
What were you doing?
What took you so long?

919
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,060
-Tasted.
-Tasted?

920
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,140
Such was the situation.

921
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,680
I couldn't stop myself.

922
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,010
But I had told you
that I'll taste her first.

923
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,100
She won't be affected by it for too long.

924
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,350
She will be back to her own self.

925
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,760
-Okay.
-Now do this. You taste her. Go.

926
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,760
-Will she agree?
-I've set it all up.

927
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,640
-Okay.
-She's an ordinary salesgirl.

928
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,810
-Go. Go.
-Okay. I'll go taste her.

929
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,680
-Hey... Stop. Stop.
-Where are you going?

930
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,430
Do you expect me to taste the leftovers?

931
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,890
-You stay here. It's my turn.
-Have fun.

932
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,220
-Mother is back.
-Mother had to come now.

933
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,510
-What now?
-We are in big trouble.

934
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,890
Where did she come from?

935
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:42,350
-Listen.
-What?

936
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,390
-Hide.
-What happened?

937
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,640
Sweety is here.
Sweety. Yes. Hide.

938
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,810
Rohit. I saw your mummy has gone out.

939
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,010
Sweety. Sweety. Sweety.

940
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,350
-Come on. Let's go to the bedroom.
-Wait.

941
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,600
Sweety. Sweety. Not inside.

942
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,510
Where are you going?
Listen. Let's do it all right here.

943
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,010
-Do all the talking in the bedroom.
-Wait.

944
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,560
Sweety. Sweety. Sweety. Sweety.

945
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,760
The bedroom is very dirty.

946
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,180
Let's do it here.
Outside is really enjoyable.

947
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,930
-No. No. In the bedroom.
-Wait.

948
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,350
Come here.

949
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,970
-We have got a good opportunity today.
-Sweety.

950
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,600
-How can I let it go?
-Let's get it done with here.

951
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,810
Not here. Let's go to the bedroom.

952
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,470
-Not in the bedroom.
-Please, Rohit.

953
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,510
-No.
-Let me explain the concept to you.

954
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,680
Look, tomorrow is my exam.

955
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,930
And I don't want my exam ruined
because of you.

956
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,470
And that's your responsibility.

957
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,680
Isn't it? So please go.

958
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,100
Please, Sweety. Go.

959
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,180
-Go.
-Okay. Give me a kiss.

960
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,720
Kiss?

961
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,260
On the lips.

962
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,680
I'm doomed.

963
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,220
Done. Happy?

964
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,560
I also liked it. Let's go.

965
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,220
Do you know what the problem is?
Mom could be back any minute.

966
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:52,970
Once I pass then we can
make such a program later too.

967
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,220
We can inhale oxygen all our lives.

968
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,560
Listen, do call me.
I miss you a lot. I love you.

969
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,100
-Go. Go. Bye.
-Bye. Love you.

970
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:02,220
She's gone.

971
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,220
-I'm safe.
-Rohit. Rohit.

972
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,930
-Wow. You were having such fun.
-Kiss. Kiss.

973
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,760
-Are you mad? Quiet.
-You were having so much fun.

974
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,140
And why were you hiding there?

975
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,260
-We are also enjoying.
-He's a player.

976
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,310
You know what, you're so lucky.

977
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,560
-She is also ready.
-Tell me something.

978
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,140
While you were doing all this
I would've done my thing inside.

979
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,970
Quiet. I can enjoy with her any time.

980
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,390
But she doesn't come every day, does she?

981
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,220
I'll deal with her first. Let me go.

982
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,430
-Go, my champion.
-He is such a jerk.

983
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,430
Hey... Isn't he taking a bit too long?

984
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720
Yes.

985
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,010
Has he started a second inning?

986
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,470
Quite possible.

987
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:02,600
Come. Was everything okay?

988
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,010
-Wow.
-What happened inside?

989
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,640
Thank God Rajan had my almond milk.

990
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,350
Otherwise you would've
had to wait for an hour more.

991
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,640
What happened? Are you going to tell?

992
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,640
-Where? Inside?
-Yes.

993
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
Here it is.

994
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,260
When I went inside there
was silence in the entire room.

995
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,390
-Then?
-I could hear the water.

996
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,510
-I went in further.
-Then?

997
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,680
-As soon as I saw her...
-Yes.

998
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,760
I removed my clothes and went inside.

999
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,560
-It was awesome.
-Really?

1000
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,720
Now, you hold this.

1001
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,970
It's my turn now.

1002
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,930
Rahul, you let it be.
Mother might come.

1003
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:43,510
Yes. His mother might come.

1004
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,510
Now that it's my turn
his mother might come.

1005
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,260
Have I come here to
listen to your stories?

1006
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,390
Move.

1007
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,470
Stop, Rahul. It will take you too long.
Mother might come.

1008
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,760
All right.

1009
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,640
When is he going to come?
When is he going to come?

1010
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,140
Where is he?

1011
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,930
Rajan, listen. As soon as Rahul comes out

1012
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,600
we'll drive that girl
out of here immediately.

1013
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,810
Mother could come any time.

1014
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,430
Don't worry.

1015
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,890
As soon as Rahul comes out
we'll drive that girl out of here.

1016
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,510
-Okay?
-Okay.

1017
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,430
When is he going to come?

1018
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,430
I wonder what's going to happen.
Mother could come anytime.

1019
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,850
How do I... How do I get
this girl out of here?

1020
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:27,060
Rohit, stop fretting.
Let Rahul come out.

1021
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,350
It's not your house. It's mine.
Mother could come anytime.

1022
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,850
One minute.
Let me hear what's going on inside.

1023
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,680
I wonder why it's taking him so long.

1024
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,760
-Hey... What are you doing?
-Quiet.

1025
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,560
He'll come out.

1026
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,430
Rohit. What are you doing?

1027
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
What's happening?

1028
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,890
No. Why are you getting angry?

1029
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,140
You took so long.
Hence I was worried for you.

1030
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,850
I see. Do I look mad to you?

1031
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:04,510
You were trying to overhear.

1032
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,140
And he is telling me that he was worried.

1033
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,140
-Never mind him.
-Sorry. Okay, tell me.

1034
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,680
Everything went off well inside, right?

1035
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,680
Don't omit anything. Tell us everything.

1036
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,510
-Inside?
-Yes.

1037
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:18,890
What happened inside was so pleasurable.

1038
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,350
What happened?

1039
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,470
-When I went inside I saw her.
-Yes.

1040
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,180
-Then?
-She saw me.

1041
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,140
Okay.

1042
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,560
As soon as she saw me
she dropped her towel.

1043
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:37,560
It was just awesome.
It was just awesome.

1044
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,100
Inspector, please help me.

1045
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,640
A girl came to my office
and robbed me in broad daylight.

1046
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,010
Sit. Sit.

1047
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,430
Relax. Tell me what happened.

1048
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,560
My name is Varun Sehgal.

1049
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:57,220
I put a job ad in the newspapers for
the vacancy of a secretary for my office.

1050
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,310
So, a girl came for the interview.

1051
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,060
-And...
-Relax.

1052
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,310
My purse. My watch. My diamond ring.

1053
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,760
My money. My laptop.
She made off with everything.

1054
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,510
How is this possible?

1055
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,350
Is there no staff in your office?

1056
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,310
The strength of my staff is 209.

1057
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,350
But... See this. This pen drive.

1058
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,390
It has all the footage of the CCTV.
Watch what she did.

1059
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,510
Watch. Watch.

1060
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,850
Hi, sir. I'm Pooja.

1061
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,760
-Yes.
-This is my profile and certificates.

1062
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,060
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

1063
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,600
Sir, it's so hot in here.

1064
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,680
The air conditioner is fine.

1065
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,810
It's the job of a personal secretary.

1066
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,890
You have experience, right?

1067
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:32,680
Yes. Yes. I have total experience.

1068
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,220
Sir, as it is, what's the job
of a personal secretary?

1069
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,640
Taking care of every
personal thing of her boss.

1070
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,260
Right, sir?

1071
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,890
Right, sir?

1072
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,010
Yes.

1073
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:04,510
Sa... What salary do you expect?

1074
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,850
Whatever you give.

1075
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,180
-All right.
-Thank you so much, sir.

1076
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:14,310
Thank you so much, sir.

1077
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:18,260
Thank you so much, sir.

1078
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,850
Mr. Sehgal,
what happened to you was really bad.

1079
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,720
But you're also at fault in this.

1080
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,100
You gave her the chance to rob you.

1081
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,430
Officer, what could I do?

1082
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,890
Little did I know she'll knock me
unconscious and rob me.

1083
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,470
I have suffered a loss
of 25 lakhs at least.

1084
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,100
For your information let me tell you.

1085
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:56,720
This girl's name is Haseena.
And she is a professional criminal.

1086
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,680
She goes to posh areas.
Targets rich people.

1087
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,010
Robs them.

1088
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,810
And the law will get her very soon.

1089
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,640
The law might have long arms.

1090
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,430
But they're still very
short to catch Haseena.

1091
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,220
Because it is not possible
to catch Haseena.

1092
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,060
It is impossible.

1093
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,720
Because Haseena kills with her style
and not with weapons.

1094
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:37,810
Don't go anywhere.
Just wait and watch.

1095
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,850
Yes. Let's do this.
Let's go inside together.

1096
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,890
-And drive that girl out.
-Yes. Cool.

1097
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,140
-Okay.
-Come on. Come on.

1098
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,430
Mom's here.

1099
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,430
-Your mother...
-Is here.

1100
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,600
-Come on.
-Let's see.

1101
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:55,930
Who is he?

1102
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,720
Rajan, it's not mother.

1103
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,600
It's a kid. I'll tell you. Hold on.

1104
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,180
Faddu. Why are you here?

1105
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,680
It's something serious, darling.

1106
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,180
It's nothing serious. Go back quietly.

1107
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:17,220
-I have exams. I want to study.
-Let me see what you're studying.

1108
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,430
Hey!

1109
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:23,060
He won't listen.

1110
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,970
Faddu.

1111
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,220
Who the hell are you?

1112
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:28,010
I see. So this is the study
that's happening.

1113
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,600
-What do you mean?
-I mean a girl came here an hour ago.

1114
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,560
-He knows.
-She's still here.

1115
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:34,760
What girl?

1116
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,600
Hey... There is no girl here. Out.

1117
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,430
-Go.
-Don't lie.

1118
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,930
Barack Obama has seen.

1119
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,850
-Barack.
-Barack Obama.

1120
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,810
Obama.

1121
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:44,100
-I'm Barack.
-I'm Obama.

1122
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,890
So... So what are you going to do?

1123
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,890
-Want me to show what I'm going to do?
-Yes.

1124
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,680
Rohit, tell them.

1125
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,260
Faddu, forgive them. Isn't it?

1126
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:56,180
Come on.
Why are you afraid of this kid?

1127
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:59,640
Hey... Whom did you call a kid?

1128
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,220
I'll go out and tell everyone
that there is a girl inside.

1129
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,680
Hey... How dare you threaten us?

1130
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:06,180
-Hey...
-You guys keep quiet.

1131
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:09,060
I'm talking to him.
Faddu, forgive them.

1132
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,140
Let's settle it between
us right here. Isn't it?

1133
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,180
I can. It's the matter of a second girl.

1134
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,970
That's why I'll take a good 1000 rupees.

1135
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,850
-1000 rupees?
-Yes.

1136
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:19,350
Give 1000 rupees.

1137
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,010
You never have money. Here you go.

1138
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,510
Here you are, Faddu. 1000.

1139
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,350
Listen. Don't tell anyone there
is a girl in this house. Okay?

1140
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,640
-Go.
-See you, darling.

1141
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,640
Let's go.

1142
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,220
Who is he?

1143
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:40,100
Darling, from today
you too are in my database.

1144
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,260
And 1000 is for an hour only.
Drive her out fast.

1145
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,180
Go. Out. Out.

1146
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,680
Barack. Obama.

1147
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,680
Out. Quick.

1148
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,060
Who was he?

1149
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,310
Everyone had to come today of all days.

1150
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:56,220
-He was one awesome kid.
-He is not a kid. He is a cannonball.

1151
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,720
Now get that girl out quickly.

1152
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:00,680
If we don't he'll gather
the entire neighborhood here.

1153
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,760
He is right.

1154
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,430
-Come on. Come on.
-Let's get her out.

1155
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,640
Excuse me.

1156
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,510
-Why did you take off your clothes?
-Yes.

1157
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:28,930
You guys molested me.
And you're worried about the clothes.

1158
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,180
Sorry. But why are you crying?

1159
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:36,850
What do I do if not cry?

1160
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,680
I've been dishonored.

1161
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,260
What's done is done.

1162
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:48,010
-Yes.
-Now tell us. What can we do for you?

1163
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:50,680
One of you three will have to marry me.

1164
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:52,260
-Marry?
-Yes.

1165
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,140
-Look, how is this possible?
-Why isn't it possible?

1166
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,890
It was possible
when you came to molest me.

1167
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,310
And it is not possible now?

1168
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,470
-Rahul, the girl is right.
-Yes.

1169
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,310
-Rajan, you marry.
-Yes.

1170
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:08,390
I... How can I marry?

1171
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:11,350
I am already engaged.
See this. Last week.

1172
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,510
This is a silver ring.

1173
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,060
It is not used for an engagement.
You're lying.

1174
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,970
I swear. I'm getting married next month.

1175
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,220
Do this. Rahul. You marry her.

1176
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,470
-Yes, you marry.
-Are you mad?

1177
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,720
I have four sisters.

1178
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,060
Am I supposed to get them married
first or get myself married first?

1179
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,430
-He is right.
-You marry her.

1180
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,850
-Me.
-You are not even engaged.

1181
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:28,510
You are good looking.

1182
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:30,850
-Yes.
-Just a minute.

1183
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,100
-Do you believe in sun signs?
-No.

1184
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,890
-Then we can never get married.
-Why?

1185
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:36,560
Actually let me explain
to you the concept.

1186
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,850
A boy who has Mars in his horoscope
marries a girl who has Mars in hers.

1187
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:41,310
And you don't have
Mars in your horoscope.

1188
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:44,060
So we just can't get married.
You marry them.

1189
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,720
-Yes.
-Him.

1190
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,810
-Mother is back.
-Oh God.

1191
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,850
The wedding party is here.
We are done.

1192
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:55,600
But you'll have to go and open the door.

1193
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,060
-Get up.
-Mother.

1194
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,220
-I'm doomed.
-Go.

1195
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:01,220
Look, please don't come out.

1196
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,970
We will handle the situation.

1197
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,100
-Please. Please
-Come on. Come on.

1198
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,350
Oh my God.

1199
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,930
Out of the frying pan into the fire.

1200
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,720
Who is it now? Is aunt back?

1201
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:21,560
It's my maid.
She is radio in the flesh.

1202
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,140
She'll spill the beans.

1203
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,310
Hold. Do this.

1204
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,810
Tell her to leave.

1205
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,310
-And drive her away.
-Drive her away.

1206
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:30,560
Drive her away.

1207
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
-Listen. Listen to me.
-Yes.

1208
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,310
I'll try to drive her away.

1209
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:38,180
But if she doesn't go she'll
clean mother's room first.

1210
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:39,430
Okay. Do this.

1211
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,560
Get that girl out of mother's room
and take her to my room.

1212
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,140
-Okay. Okay. Don't worry.
-Yes.

1213
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,640
-Go. Go. Go.
-Do something.

1214
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,760
Please. Let's go from here.
The maid is here.

1215
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,010
If she sees you here
it will be disastrous.

1216
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,430
Why should I go?

1217
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,720
Listen. Please. We beg you.
Listen to us.

1218
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:00,100
-Then we'll agree to whatever you say.
-Please.

1219
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:01,680
-Understand the situation
-I see.

1220
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,680
-Please.
-Please.

1221
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,600
Come. Come.

1222
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:13,220
Hurry.

1223
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,760
These people take so long.

1224
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:22,180
Not done.

1225
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:24,720
-You take so long to open the door.
-One minute please.

1226
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:29,390
It's not done if you
take so long to open the door.

1227
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,430
I have four other households to go to.

1228
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,430
Sangeeta, don't go inside.
There is no chore to be done today.

1229
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,310
-Go to other household.
-Why?

1230
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,510
-I don't take salary for doing nothing.
-Yes.

1231
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,600
-Got it?
-Sit. Sit.

1232
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,640
-Sit. Sit.
-He keeps talking rubbish.

1233
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,810
Move. Let me work.

1234
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,640
Sangeeta. Sangeeta. Have you gone mad?

1235
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,310
Sangeeta. Sangeeta.

1236
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,720
-Listen to me.
-What's wrong with you today?

1237
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,010
Have you gone mad?

1238
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,850
-She is coming up.
-She is coming up.

1239
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,140
-So what do I do?
-What do we do now?

1240
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:53,310
Sangeeta, why are you going upstairs?

1241
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,760
Hold on. Where are you going?

1242
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,260
Madam has told me to clean your room.

1243
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:00,850
I mean my room is clean.
My room is clean.

1244
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,640
-Hide in this cupboard.
-Please. Please. Come.

1245
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,010
-She'll come.
-Try to understand.

1246
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,720
-What are you doing?
-We'll be in big trouble?

1247
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,850
Please. Please.

1248
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:09,970
Should I tell?

1249
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,680
-Close it quickly.
-I feel you should tell.

1250
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,560
Now let me work.

1251
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,930
-Now I want to clean your room.
-My room is clean. It's okay. Go.

1252
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,220
I'll clean your room.
Or madam will get mad at me.

1253
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,810
-I'll handle it. You go.
-Move.

1254
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,510
The maid is coming.

1255
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,760
Here she is. Here she is.

1256
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,470
-Who are these two?
-She's here.

1257
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,850
My friends. As I told you.
We are studying together.

1258
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:34,600
-Correct. Studies.
-I've never seen you before.

1259
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,060
I'll go away. I'll clean up and leave.

1260
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,100
-Yes. Go.
-Move.

1261
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,220
Where is she?

1262
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,310
She's in the cupboard.

1263
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,220
Our secret has been disclosed.
We're doomed.

1264
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,430
We're doomed. We are safe.

1265
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,970
What's wrong with you today?

1266
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,060
You are behaving strange.

1267
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,260
Exercise. Exercise.

1268
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,260
I think he has gone completely crazy.

1269
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,560
I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

1270
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,600
I just heard the sneeze of a lady.

1271
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:08,930
-No. A girl sneezed.
-No. No.

1272
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,600
This is how I always sneeze.

1273
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,890
-I have a cold.
-You sneeze like a girl.

1274
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:19,310
-No. No.
-And why you both are up?

1275
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:22,350
-We are done studying.
-We are done studying.

1276
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:25,140
I'll go crazy if I work here today.

1277
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,430
I'm going.

1278
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,010
I'll tell madam everything
about you three.

1279
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,140
-Everything.
-Yes. Go.

1280
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,890
-I won't work today.
-Go.

1281
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:33,970
Not just today.
I'll never work here again.

1282
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,390
There is something wrong with this house.

1283
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,930
-She's gone.
-She's gone.

1284
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,600
Come.

1285
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,100
Okay listen. I'm going downstairs now.

1286
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,060
Enough of your hide and seek.

1287
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,720
-Move.
-Hey... Hey...

1288
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:54,260
She is going downstairs again.

1289
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,220
-Come on.
-Come on.

1290
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,760
Listen. Excuse me.

1291
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,760
Go downstairs and wear clothes please.

1292
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,060
Wear it please.

1293
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,140
-Wear it please.
-Man.

1294
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,720
Listen. Mother will be back.

1295
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,350
-Don't roam around naked like that.
-Yes. Don't.

1296
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,680
She doesn't even listen.
Please wear clothes.

1297
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,260
She went inside.

1298
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:18,430
She went inside.

1299
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,390
-I'll go crazy.
-Who is it now?

1300
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,640
-Who is it now?
-I'll go crazy.

1301
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,640
-Mother is back.
-Get up.

1302
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:27,640
-Mother is back.
-Go.

1303
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
-Rohit, get up.
-No.

1304
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:32,310
-Who else is going to go?
-Go see.

1305
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,640
Oh God, save me today.

1306
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,180
-Save me today.
-What now?

1307
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:43,560
Listen. You guys hide.

1308
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,060
It's not mother.

1309
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,220
Oh you.

1310
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:52,350
-Hi, Rohit.
-Hi.

1311
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,430
-How are you?
-Aunt...

1312
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,970
Rohit. I have told you so many times.

1313
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:06,310
Don't call me aunt.

1314
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:12,640
Rohit, you know that when you
call me aunt I feel so bad, don't you?

1315
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,220
Call me just Kamini.

1316
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,390
-Kamini.
-Okay, Kamini.

1317
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,680
O Rohit, my name sounds
so good coming from your mouth.

1318
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,560
Just like honey.

1319
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:34,680
Okay. Why are you so nervous?

1320
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,930
And why are you sweating?

1321
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,390
The...

1322
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,720
I have exams tomorrow.
I'm worried about it.

1323
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,350
Okay. Okay. Call mummy.

1324
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:50,560
-Mother has gone out.
-Oh my God.

1325
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:54,060
It means you are alone.

1326
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,810
No. No.

1327
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,720
Can I share your loneliness for some time?

1328
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,310
No. No. No, Kamini. No.

1329
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,140
As it is, I have told you
so many times that...

1330
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,810
during afternoons at I'm alone
in the house.

1331
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,470
But you just don't come.

1332
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:18,510
Don't you like me?

1333
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,100
-No. That's not the case.
-Then what is it?

1334
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,810
What are you doing?
Someone might show up.

1335
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,890
-Kamini.
-Rohit, who's here?

1336
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,600
What are you doing?
Someone might see.

1337
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,680
Kamini. Kamini. What are you doing?

1338
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,430
Someone might show up.

1339
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,260
Who's here to show
up apart from you and me?

1340
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:43,430
-Rajan. Rahul.
-Rahul? Who are they?

1341
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,760
My friends.

1342
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,180
-Where are they?
-Behind you.

1343
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:59,810
Kamini. My friends. Rajan. And Rahul.

1344
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,890
Hello, aunt.

1345
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,140
Yes. Hello. Hello.

1346
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,720
Rohit, why didn't you tell me before
that you're not alone in the house?

1347
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,010
You didn't give me the chance to tell.

1348
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,970
We have exams tomorrow.
So were studying together.

1349
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:18,140
-Okay. Okay. Study hard.
-Yes.

1350
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,430
And tell mummy when
she comes that I had come.

1351
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:23,890
Who was she?

1352
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:26,260
-She is my neighboring was aunt.
-She was one awesome aunt.

1353
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,010
-I swear.
-Yes.

1354
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,890
The bell rings every ten minutes.
Someone's showing up every minutes.

1355
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:32,310
As if this is not a house but an inn.

1356
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:34,350
I'll go crazy opening
and closing the door.

1357
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:37,560
-Get that girl out of here.
-That is what we are trying.

1358
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,010
-I have an idea.
-What?

1359
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,470
Let's combine our money
and give it to her.

1360
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,510
-That's a good idea.
-Out with the money.

1361
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,180
Here's Two.

1362
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:47,470
You said you don't have a purse.

1363
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,890
Yes. But I have money.

1364
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,100
You need to carry something
in case of emergency.

1365
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,970
-This guys is so smart.
-Never mind him.

1366
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,510
-Out with your money.
-Out. Out with it.

1367
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,640
-200 rupees?
-What?

1368
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,890
It's my house. It's my bedroom.
And I should contribute as well.

1369
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:02,060
-This is not done.
-Come on.

1370
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:04,140
Not done. Poor people

1371
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,310
I have 1100.

1372
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,560
I'll do this.
I'll save hundred for petrol.

1373
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,140
-And give her 1000.
-Yes.

1374
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:11,560
Let count the money.
Let's see how much it is.

1375
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,930
1000 rupees...

1376
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,010
it's 3200 rupees.

1377
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,510
-Listen. Will she agree for 3200?
-Of course she will.

1378
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,850
-Let's try. What's the harm in trying?
-Yes.

1379
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:26,600
-Come on. Come on.
-Come on.

1380
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,720
Get her out.

1381
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,600
<i>Haseena. Haseena.</i>

1382
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,640
Rascals. You think you're very smart.

1383
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:37,970
No. No.

1384
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:42,260
You've come to buy my honour
for such a small amount.

1385
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:43,680
No.

1386
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:47,970
What did you imagine?
You three can fool me.

1387
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,010
What?

1388
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,260
You rascals. What happened?

1389
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:57,010
-Has cat caught your tongue?
-You use swear words too.

1390
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,600
Swear words don't sound
good coming from your mouth.

1391
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,510
It doesn't suit your character.

1392
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,970
Keep quiet, rascal.

1393
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,510
Now are you going to teach me.
You smarty in particular.

1394
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,810
As to what suits me or doesn't.

1395
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:15,140
-No. No.
-You lustful brutes.

1396
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,810
Girls like us learn to use swear words
because of boys like you.

1397
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:19,890
What is she saying?

1398
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:25,140
And you deserve to be thrashed
and not just abused.

1399
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,100
No. No.

1400
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,060
You are really fond of hearing
swear words, right?

1401
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,600
Okay. Here you are.

1402
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:48,180
-Morons. Dogs.
-Stop. Stop.

1403
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,260
-You scums. You pricks.
-Stop. Stop.

1404
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:52,560
Are you going to make our ears bleed?

1405
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,060
I have never abused anyone
so much ever in my life.

1406
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,510
And I never even heard
so many swear words.

1407
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,220
Excuse me.

1408
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,560
Where did you learn
these swear words from?

1409
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,140
Shut up, you moron.

1410
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:09,930
-Now we'll get abuses.
-Who is it now?

1411
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:13,140
-What do I do now? She is back.
-Who is it now?

1412
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,930
Hey... Go and see.

1413
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,810
Yes. Go. See.

1414
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,720
You guys just sit there.

1415
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:25,010
Don't do that please.

1416
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:28,010
Listen. Go inside.

1417
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:30,310
And please wear clothes.

1418
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,600
I will not. Get lost.

1419
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,720
Please wear it. Please.

1420
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,350
Come on. Go. Go and see.
Or I'll whack you.

1421
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:38,890
Wear it please.

1422
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,100
-I'm certain to tie today.
-Rahul, what now?

1423
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,220
Send for me, O Lord.

1424
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,100
We're doomed. You idiots.

1425
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,010
Hey.

1426
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:51,760
-Rohit. Rohit.
- Rohit.

1427
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,600
-What's wrong with you?
-Rohit.

1428
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,060
Come to your senses.

1429
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,220
-What's wrong with you?
-Rohit.

1430
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,890
-Go see who is at the door.
-You go. You go.

1431
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:00,180
-What happened? Rohit.
-Oh no.

1432
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:03,930
Oh no. What now?

1433
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,510
Rajan. Rajan.

1434
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:07,680
It's an old man.

1435
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,140
-Old man who?
-How would I know?

1436
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,600
-Who is it now?
-Do this.

1437
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,810
-Take him inside.
-Leave him.

1438
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,930
-Take him inside.
-Leave him. Handle that old man.

1439
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,180
I'll handle him.

1440
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:21,140
Please. Will you help me?

1441
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:24,600
-Please come.
-Take him inside fast.

1442
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,850
Come. Please help.

1443
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,970
Pick him up.

1444
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:32,930
-Quick. Quick.
-Yes, I'm taking him.

1445
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,220
Go. Go.

1446
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:38,260
-Here. In the bedroom.
-He is so heavy.

1447
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:39,470
Go. Go.

1448
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,680
Pick him up. Please.

1449
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:47,640
-What?
-Where is Rohit?

1450
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:51,140
-Hello. Hello. Stop. Stop.
-Rohit. Rohit.

1451
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,850
Where are you, mister?
You can't barge in like that.

1452
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,510
Rohit, get up.
We'll be in big trouble.

1453
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,260
-What is it?
-Splash water on him.

1454
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,850
Yes. Rohit. Rohit. Get up. Get up.

1455
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:06,930
Get up.

1456
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,060
Who is this old man outside?

1457
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,140
Rohit. Get up.

1458
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:14,180
Rohit. Rohit.

1459
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,640
First tell me. Who are you?
And what are you doing here?

1460
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:19,720
-I'm Rohit's friend.
-I'm Rohit's uncle.

1461
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,970
-Uncle.
-Hey... What are you doing?

1462
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,850
I'm sorry. I didn't recognise you.

1463
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:25,850
My bad. As we have never met before.

1464
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:28,720
-Okay. Okay. Where is Rohit?
-He is studying in the bedroom.

1465
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,470
-Studying in the bedroom?
-Yes. We have exams tomorrow.

1466
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,850
So we thought if
we study together we'll pass.

1467
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,930
Okay. Let me see what he is studying.

1468
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,680
-Uncle, you can't go inside.
-Why can't I?

1469
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,890
Because if you go inside
you'll cause disturbance.

1470
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,010
And if there is disturbance
Rohit will fail.

1471
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,140
And I know you would never want to be
held responsible for him failing.

1472
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:52,390
Come to your senses.
We'll be in a soup. Rohit.

1473
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:55,680
Rohit. Come to your senses.
That old man will come inside.

1474
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:56,680
Get up.

1475
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,510
<i>Haseena, Haseena</i>

1476
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,890
Please go from here.

1477
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:01,430
We'll be doomed. We'll be ruined.

1478
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,720
-What are you doing? I'll fall.
-Come fast.

1479
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:05,890
Behave yourself. Move.

1480
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:08,760
-Uncle. Uncle.
-Don't be crazy.

1481
01:31:08,890 --> 01:31:10,720
-He'll fail if there is disturbance.
-Leave me.

1482
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:12,600
-Please yield.
-What are you doing?

1483
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,930
-Uncle, yield.
-Rohit.

1484
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,510
-He'll fail.
-Rohit.

1485
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,850
Uncle, disturbance...

1486
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,970
-Rohit. Where are you?
-Leave me.

1487
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,100
Leave me. Have you gone mad? Idiot.

1488
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,350
-Uncle. Uncle.
-You're back.

1489
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,010
-You can't go inside.
-Move.

1490
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:30,180
Don't go. Don't go.

1491
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,600
I'll hit you.

1492
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,220
All right, you want
to cause disturbance.

1493
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,010
I'll talk instead.

1494
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,930
-Rohit will get disturbed.
-Get up.

1495
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,310
-Get up. Go.
-Rohit.

1496
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,560
-Rohit.
-Move.

1497
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:49,010
Rohit. Rohit. Did you get disturbed?

1498
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,350
You got disturbed, my son.

1499
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:53,810
Enough. Enough.

1500
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,850
-Go.
-Should I?

1501
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,260
-Study.
-Okay.

1502
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,890
Who do you scream?

1503
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,470
-Bless me.
-God bless.

1504
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:03,390
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1505
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:06,260
-Study.
-You have such crazy friends.

1506
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:10,390
I had told him not
to let anyone disturb me.

1507
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,430
What are you studying?

1508
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,510
Today's studies have become
so tough that a man goes crazy.

1509
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:19,890
He loses his mind.
He starts doing weird things.

1510
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,430
Son, study hard.

1511
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,100
Uncle, you needed anything
or you came for a visit.

1512
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,850
Yes, dear.

1513
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,310
I wanted to meet sister-in-law. Got it?

1514
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,720
So I came.

1515
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:35,680
-Your crazy friend messed it all up.
-Okay.

1516
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:38,720
Actually the boy and his family
are coming to see Aarti.

1517
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:41,180
-I see.
-So where is mummy?

1518
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,560
Mother has gone out.

1519
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:46,760
-When will she be back?
-She'll return late. Call her up.

1520
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:49,060
Such things can't be
discussed over the phone.

1521
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,810
It needs to be discussed face to face.

1522
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:52,850
-Okay.
-No problem.

1523
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:56,140
I'll sit and wait.
I have time. It's okay.

1524
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,430
Look, you'll wait.

1525
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,390
I'll study inside. I'll not like that.

1526
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:03,510
-You'll sit here alone.
-Don't over think.

1527
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,850
Go and study.
In the meanwhile I'll watch TV.

1528
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,350
TV? You'll watch TV.
There will be noise.

1529
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:14,260
-I'll get disturbed. Not possible.
-Son, don't worry at all.

1530
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,930
-I'll mute the sound.
-Okay.

1531
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,060
-Study hard.
-Yes.

1532
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,600
-Watch.
-Uncle. Mute.

1533
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,140
-Yes.
-Okay. Watch.

1534
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:29,560
<i>In the water, I've been
playing ice spice with myself.</i>

1535
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:34,680
The old man slapped me.
We are having a bad day.

1536
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,890
-Please wear clothes.
-I'll not. Get lost.

1537
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,810
-You're back.
-Ha the old man left?

1538
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,890
-What?
-He is not going.

1539
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,060
He is sitting outside and watching TV.

1540
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,850
-Damn it.
-He had to watch TV today.

1541
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,100
Little did I know?

1542
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,260
I have gone crazy.
The old man is not budging.

1543
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,470
He is not going.

1544
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:57,390
<i>Haseena worth 50 lakhs.</i>

1545
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,720
<i>Let us show you a beauty who targets
big businessmen and industrialists...</i>

1546
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:07,010
<i>and robs them showing her beautiful body.</i>

1547
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,060
<i>The government has put
a price of 50 lakhs on her head.</i>

1548
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,100
<i>Be wary of this beauty.</i>

1549
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:16,390
<i>Or she might rob you
too by enamoring you.</i>

1550
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,350
-I'll go out now.
-No. No. You don't go.

1551
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,680
You don't go.

1552
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:23,760
-Don't go. Don't go.
-Leave me.

1553
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,850
Leave me. What are you doing?

1554
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,010
Have you lost your mind?

1555
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,350
What to do now? I don't understand.

1556
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:30,720
-I'll go crazy.
-Listen.

1557
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,310
You handle uncle, we'll handle her.

1558
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,220
-Go. Go.
-All right, I'll handle.

1559
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:36,390
-Go and handle the old man.
-Yeah, right.

1560
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:38,220
-Please sit.
-I don't understand.

1561
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,430
All of them are jerks,
bloody perverts.

1562
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,510
-Uncle, it's not possible.
-What's not possible?

1563
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,890
Uncle, you outside.
Me inside. How is it possible?

1564
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:52,470
-What?
-Study.

1565
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,560
Okay, let me explain what's happening.

1566
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,060
I'll study inside. When I try to study
I'm thinking about you.

1567
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:01,930
I start thinking about your needs
and health.

1568
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:03,600
My values don't allow me.

1569
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,930
Now, if mom come and questions me,
tell me what will I tell her?

1570
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:09,600
Son, I'm really happy
to hear this from you.

1571
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,640
Yes.

1572
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:13,260
-I'm proud of you.
-Yes, uncle.

1573
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:15,140
Okay. I'll leave.

1574
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,560
-Bye, uncle.
-God bless.

1575
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,930
And yes.

1576
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:21,390
Brother, you and sister-in-law, please
be on time on Monday.

1577
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:23,640
-Sure.
-See you.

1578
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,810
-Rohit.
-Yes, uncle?

1579
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,060
I need to use the washroom.

1580
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,890
Uncle, do it outside.

1581
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,970
What are you saying?

1582
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,560
Uncle, as I told you.
The studies. The exams.

1583
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,930
I've gone crazy. I have lost it.

1584
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:43,600
Okay. You go study in your room.
I'll go upstairs and freshen up.

1585
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,720
Then jump down from the room.

1586
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:48,720
-What?
-I meant come downstairs and leave.

1587
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:50,310
At least, wear something now.

1588
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,970
Why? What's wrong with it?

1589
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,970
No, No. You are looking beautiful.

1590
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,140
Yes, there is no harm.
-Okay.

1591
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,720
-To hell with your tummy.
-I hope it's not too late.

1592
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,760
Come fast.

1593
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,260
Come let's see.

1594
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:05,640
She came. She left.
She came. She left.

1595
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,930
Yes. Uncle left.

1596
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:09,010
I'll have to do something.

1597
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,850
-Is uncle gone?
-Yes. He's inside.

1598
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:15,010
-Inside?
-He's in the washroom.

1599
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:20,680
Aren't too many people
coming to our house today?

1600
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:23,430
-Yes.
-Yes. Because you two are ill-fated.

1601
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,010
Anyway...

1602
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,680
tell me what's the plan?

1603
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,100
Let me think.
Mom will be back any moment.

1604
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,510
-We are doomed.
-No, man.

1605
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,680
Okay listen, what about the girl?

1606
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,850
She's too stubborn.

1607
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,220
She's after marriage and only marriage.

1608
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:40,600
-What do we do?
-I'm confused about the situation.

1609
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,640
Pritam, I've been waiting for you guys!

1610
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,970
The situation here is getting worse.

1611
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,390
I don't know, people are popping
out of nowhere.

1612
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,470
It's getting tough to handle things here.

1613
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:57,470
I think, if anyone recognizes me,
we'll be screwed.

1614
01:36:58,010 --> 01:36:59,510
Come here as soon as possible.

1615
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:01,310
How much time will it take you guys?

1616
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:04,970
Haseena, manage for a while,
we are reaching there.

1617
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,220
Okay. I'll think of something.
Please come fast.

1618
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,060
I'm telling you, you both have
caused this problem.

1619
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,510
Hey, shut your mouth.

1620
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,680
You both enjoy and I'm the one who
gets stuck.

1621
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:19,220
Look at the faces of these rascals.

1622
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,810
Playing innocent, are you?

1623
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,100
Listen, zip it.

1624
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,760
You were the one bragging about
having sex.

1625
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:27,180
-What was that?
-Yeah, so.

1626
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,720
But, the thing is, you don't know
the details.

1627
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:36,720
-What do you mean?
-I kinda... I lied.

1628
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,140
-Lie?
-Yes.

1629
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,100
When I went inside.

1630
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,140
You jerk. Rascal.

1631
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,310
-What happened?
-Rascal!

1632
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:58,810
-What were you doing?
-What happened?

1633
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:01,140
-Nothing.
-What were you doing?

1634
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:02,970
What was your hand doing in my skirt?

1635
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,760
-No. No.
-You came to rape me.

1636
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:07,220
-You'll rape me. You'll rape me.
-No. No.

1637
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:10,180
-You'll rape me.
-I came to massage.

1638
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:12,640
-I had nothing on my mind.
-You came to massage.

1639
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,680
You'll massage me.
You rascal. You jerk.

1640
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:16,220
-You came to rape me.
-No.

1641
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,720
-You want to feel my skirt?
-No.

1642
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,640
Take this and this.

1643
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,600
Nothing. I came to check on you.

1644
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,680
You bloody pervert!

1645
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:27,260
I... I came to check your knee.

1646
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:30,390
You came to check my knee.
So, you are fond of knees?

1647
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:32,720
No. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1648
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,970
-Please forgive me.
-Forgive you?

1649
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,220
-Please forgive me.
-Forgive you?

1650
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:38,930
Your eyes show your perversion.

1651
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:41,640
Take this, bloody swine.

1652
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,510
When you told me to go to
the bedroom and stretch your legs...

1653
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,640
-I had a doubt on you right then.
-I'm sorry.

1654
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,890
So, you touch a girl without her consent!

1655
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:51,890
You were touching me with your hand,
weren't you?

1656
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:55,970
No. No. I came to check on you.

1657
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,930
Oh, is it? By feeling my skirt?

1658
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:02,930
-You'll put your hand inside my skirt.
-I was massaging your knee.

1659
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,220
So you think you can massage?

1660
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,680
I'm sorry.

1661
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1662
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:13,890
I was clear about your intentions.

1663
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,180
-Leave me.
-Your intentions are pathetic.

1664
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:19,890
You wanted to have fun in the bedroom?

1665
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,470
-Out
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1666
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:26,470
Get out, now.

1667
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,220
Listen...

1668
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:33,930
What are you going to tell
your friends outside?

1669
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:35,600
What should I say?

1670
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,260
Tell them we had sex.

1671
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,850
Seriously?

1672
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:44,760
Okay.

1673
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,100
Now, get out.

1674
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,430
Buzz off!

1675
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:54,890
Can I say something?

1676
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,640
Please don't tell my friends.

1677
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,970
I have a heroic image in front of them.

1678
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,640
-You want another explanation?
-No, not at all.

1679
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,430
I told you whatever she asked me
to tell you guys.

1680
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,890
Sorry. I lied to you guys.

1681
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:29,430
Rohit. Rohit. Why are you crying?

1682
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,100
Because he is my true friend.

1683
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:36,470
Rohit, you love me so much?

1684
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:38,260
Shut up!

1685
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,890
-This has happened because of you.
-Because of me?

1686
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,140
You said that
she is an ordinary salesgirl.

1687
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,470
I've impressed her.
To hell with your impressions!

1688
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,680
She handled me.

1689
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,720
Why? What happened to you?

1690
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,640
When I went inside...

1691
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,560
<i>I can shake it to the left
And shake it to the right</i>

1692
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:01,560
<i>I can dance all night
Before my mind</i>

1693
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:02,640
<i>I can shake it to the left
And shake it to the right</i>

1694
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,510
<i>I can dance all night
Before my mind</i>

1695
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,180
<i>Oh baby</i>

1696
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,430
Bloody pimp!

1697
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,220
-Rascal. You came to rape me.
-No. No.

1698
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:58,930
-You'll rape me.
-I'm sorry. Please.

1699
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:01,060
-Why are you beating me?
-You play very innocent.

1700
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:02,850
-You came to rape me.
-No.

1701
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:05,720
I came to check on you.

1702
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:07,720
You are going to check
on me by kissing my thighs.

1703
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:09,350
-Let your mother come.
-Sorry. Sorry.

1704
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:11,140
-You were playing very innocent.
-Sorry.

1705
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,850
-Rascal. What were you saying?
-Sorry.

1706
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:15,720
You wanted to taste me?

1707
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:17,720
You wanted to taste me?
You said that I'm cheap.

1708
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,140
-I'm cheap.
-No.

1709
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:22,930
Now I'll tell everyone
about your misdeeds today.

1710
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,720
-Wait and watch.
-No.

1711
01:45:24,850 --> 01:45:26,260
-I see. You thought I was cheap.
-No.

1712
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:27,850
-What did you think? I'll not tell anyone.
-No.

1713
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:30,310
I should talk softly. Weren't
you ashamed while doing all that?

1714
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:32,930
-Let your mother come. Out.
-Don't tell my mother.

1715
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,390
-Out.
-Yes.

1716
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:36,600
Get out.

1717
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:38,850
-Can I take the T-shirt?
-Take it.

1718
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,220
-Don't hit me.
-Get out.

1719
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:45,220
-No. No. Please.
-Out.

1720
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:47,600
Don't tell mother. Please.

1721
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:49,970
Get out.

1722
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,810
And listen.
Are you going to go out like this?

1723
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:55,890
Don't go out with the sad face.

1724
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:57,100
-Say you did it.
-Okay.

1725
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,260
Leave now.

1726
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,060
I'll tell them that I'm done.

1727
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,510
Can I have water?

1728
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,100
Okay, now, get out.

1729
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:16,310
Don't tell mother please.

1730
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,510
-Bye.
-Out. Out.

1731
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:43,180
I told you that mother will be back.

1732
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:44,970
-Yes.
-But you didn't listen.

1733
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:13,430
Oh darling!

1734
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,180
You made me wait for too long.

1735
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,970
Ouch.

1736
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:36,140
Rascal. What were you doing? You jerk.

1737
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:40,010
You rascal. You came to rape me.

1738
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:41,260
Why did you hit me?

1739
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:44,260
-Rascal. So should I venerate you?
-Why did you hit me?

1740
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:47,010
What did you guys imagine?
That I'm an ordinary salesgirl.

1741
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:48,390
You'll be able to have me.

1742
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:51,560
You dog. You really like
to massage oil, don't you?

1743
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,260
You'll massage my knee.

1744
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:55,970
You carried me in your arms.

1745
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,430
You were really fond of bringing me
to your bedroom.

1746
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,970
I am cheap. I'm salesgirl.

1747
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:05,010
So you'll impress me easily.
You brought here to your bed.

1748
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:07,140
What were you saying?
The girl is forward.

1749
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,930
-When did I say all that?
-Should I tell you when you said that?

1750
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,260
Wait. I'll tell you. Take that.

1751
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:14,930
You'll rape me. Out.

1752
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:16,310
-Sorry.
-Sorry?

1753
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:19,430
You're saying sorry to me.
You'll say sorry to me.

1754
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,350
-You'll massage oil. You'll massage.
-It's done.

1755
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:25,310
-You look like a rapist.
-Rapist.

1756
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:28,430
You brute. Rascal. Get out of here.

1757
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,850
-Out.
-Should I go?

1758
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,760
-Out. Or I'll whack you.
-I'm going.

1759
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:32,810
Get out.

1760
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,810
My nuts!

1761
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:42,060
Listen. Are you going to
go before your friends like that?

1762
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,180
No.

1763
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,510
Okay listen.
Tell them that you did it.

1764
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:56,430
-Listen. Please don't tell anyone.
-Okay.

1765
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,010
Hey...

1766
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:12,970
okay, so why are we scared
when we haven't done anything wrong?

1767
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:14,260
He's right.

1768
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,600
I suggest let's grab
her and throw her out.

1769
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,810
-Let's throw her out.
-Yes.

1770
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:20,430
-Correct.
-Come on.

1771
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:21,930
Who does she think she is?

1772
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,350
Hey... Queue up.

1773
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:50,220
Queue up.

1774
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:53,220
Get in line. Come on. Get in line.

1775
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:56,560
Keep going, old man.

1776
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:02,060
Why? Are you guys very
surprised to see me like this?

1777
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:03,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

1778
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,390
This old man is really
fond of peeping into the room.

1779
01:50:08,930 --> 01:50:11,390
I have introduced myself to him very well.

1780
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,260
-Uncle, there is a confusion.
-What?

1781
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:18,720
You went there to the washroom.
How did you end up in there?

1782
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:24,100
Son, you should've told me that
Haseena is hiding inside?

1783
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:26,680
She is well known thief.

1784
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:30,850
The government has put
a price of 50 lakhs on her head.

1785
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:34,100
She enamors everyone with her beauty.

1786
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,720
And then robs them.

1787
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:39,390
Got it? Got my introduction?

1788
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:43,260
Shocked, are you?

1789
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:48,310
Are you shocked upon knowing
about and to see me in this avatar?

1790
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,810
Excuse me.

1791
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:54,010
-Why have you come here?
-To rob your house.

1792
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:55,810
What?

1793
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:57,720
Come on, everyone.
Remove your clothes.

1794
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:01,060
-Clothes?
-But why clothes?

1795
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:03,810
Remove the clothes quietly
or I'll shoot all of you.

1796
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:05,970
No. No. Don't shoot.

1797
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,430
We'll remove our clothes.
Remove your clothes.

1798
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,850
Listen, do you need a special invitation?

1799
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:12,890
Come on, remove your clothes.

1800
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:14,930
-Son, remove it.
-Remove. Come on.

1801
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,220
All of you. Remove your clothes at once.

1802
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:22,220
-Come on. Quick.
-Take care of the shorts.

1803
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,470
Son.

1804
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,970
-Mother is here.
-Oh my God.

1805
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:35,680
Smarty. Come on. Open the door.

1806
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,680
You, this way. Old man, this way.

1807
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,310
Come on. Open the door.

1808
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,180
And you guys.

1809
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,430
Stand just like this.
Or I'll shoot everyone.

1810
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,260
Uncle, handle mummy.

1811
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:53,600
And you guys. Don't move.

1812
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:55,890
Or I'll blow his head off.

1813
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:57,600
Wow.

1814
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,560
-I hope it isn't sister-in-law.
-Hey.

1815
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,180
-I won't go.
-Get up.

1816
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:02,430
Get up.

1817
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:07,390
-We are in a mess now.
-She bashed me up.

1818
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,640
Everything is paining.

1819
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:12,220
Open it.

1820
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,680
Open the door.

1821
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,850
Open it or I'll shoot you.

1822
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:31,810
Oh Rohit.

1823
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:35,640
Why was your window closed?
Do you know how worried I was?

1824
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,680
You know what.

1825
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:39,720
I gave papa the slip.
Only to meet you.

1826
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:41,430
Now kiss me.

1827
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,760
What? What?

1828
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:47,810
By the way, you're looking cute.

1829
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:51,220
What's over there?

1830
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:57,180
Oh my God. A girl.

1831
01:52:57,310 --> 01:53:00,060
-It means you were making out?
-No.

1832
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,310
No. Why would I?
Have you gone crazy?

1833
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,760
-I'll never talk to you.
-Hey... Hey girl.

1834
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:07,260
-Not outside. Go inside.
-I... I'll go out.

1835
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:09,180
Are you listening?

1836
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,010
Not outside. Go inside.

1837
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:14,220
-I'll not go inside. Why should I?
-Tell her.

1838
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,720
Or I'll shoot her right here.

1839
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,720
Wait. Wait. I'll tell her.

1840
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:18,890
Sweety.

1841
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,850
-Rohit, what is all this?
-Go inside.

1842
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:27,760
Rohit, what is all this?

1843
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,600
Rohit, this girl...

1844
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,260
Move it.

1845
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:37,680
-She is also here.
-This girl... And she has a gun.

1846
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,390
All of you are also here.

1847
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:43,220
Why are you standing naked?
With your hands up.

1848
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:46,970
-Rohit.
-Who is she?

1849
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:50,010
She talks so much. Blabbermouth.

1850
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:52,720
Shut her up or I'll shoot her right here.

1851
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:57,260
-Mother is here.
-I'm sure.

1852
01:53:57,390 --> 01:54:00,350
-It is aunt.
-I'll go crazy.

1853
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:03,430
Bell after bell.

1854
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,640
Is this your house or a house of bells?

1855
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:08,470
Someone shows up every ten minutes.

1856
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,810
Come on. Open the door.

1857
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,010
-I won't.
-Come on.

1858
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:15,430
Come on. Open the door or I'll blow
off the heads of all of you right here.

1859
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,470
-Open it.
-Come on.

1860
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,310
-Okay.
-Move this side.

1861
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,760
-Move this side.
-Sweety.

1862
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:23,180
Smarty, this way.

1863
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:26,430
-Dear, come here.
-And you guys. Go inside.

1864
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,720
Inside.

1865
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:28,680
-Inside?
-Come on.

1866
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:30,350
Go inside. I'll blow your heads off.

1867
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,140
-Go. Go.
-We'll not go back to that room.

1868
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:39,310
-Papa.
-Where is Sweety?

1869
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,850
-What are you doing?
-Where is Sweety?

1870
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,890
-What's wrong?
-I'll not leave you.

1871
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:46,140
-I'll kill you.
-What are you doing?

1872
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:49,100
-I know Sweety is here.
-Sweety hasn't come here.

1873
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:51,930
I saw her enter with my own eyes.

1874
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:54,850
-Where is Sweety?
-Papa. What are you doing?

1875
01:54:54,970 --> 01:54:56,140
Your daughter is missing.

1876
01:54:56,260 --> 01:54:58,680
-Where is Sweety?
-You have a sword in your hands.

1877
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:03,470
-No.
-Do you think I'm a fool?

1878
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,510
She hasn't come here.

1879
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,760
-Papa.
-I saw her enter with my own eyes.

1880
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:07,970
-Papa.
-Where is Sweety?

1881
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,260
Papa.

1882
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:11,720
What are you doing? I'll get sliced.

1883
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:16,390
If I find Sweety here
then I'll cut you into pieces.

1884
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:18,640
-Darn you.
-The Sardar has gone crazy.

1885
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:22,100
-What are you doing? Papa.
-Sweety. Sweety.

1886
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:24,470
Sweety.

1887
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,430
-The bedroom is open.
-Yes.

1888
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,600
-And you're half naked in your shorts.
-Yes, papa.

1889
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,760
This means Sweety is inside.

1890
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:33,350
-No, papa.
-Sweety.

1891
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:37,930
-Papa. Don't go inside.
-Sweety. Sweety.

1892
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,220
He's gone. He's done.

1893
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:04,890
You fool. Had you told me
beforehand that Sweety was inside

1894
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:07,140
this wouldn't have been my state.

1895
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:11,060
Had I told you,
you would've cut me into pieces.

1896
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,430
-I'll kill you anyway.
-No.

1897
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,260
Papa, I'm sorry.

1898
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:17,310
-Sorry.
-I'll never forgive you.

1899
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:21,010
I told you so many times
to stay away from Rohit.

1900
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,850
But you just didn't listen to me.

1901
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:24,180
Forget it.

1902
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:26,600
They are a couple.

1903
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:29,510
Yes, they are a couple.

1904
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:36,100
I don't understand what's happening here.

1905
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:37,720
-Nor do I.
-Let me explain.

1906
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:39,010
Please do.

1907
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:46,600
You love this joker who came to rape me.

1908
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,600
-Rape.
-Rape.

1909
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:50,350
-No. No. I didn't.
-Darn you.

1910
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:52,850
-Want to see his misdeeds.
-Yes. Show. Show.

1911
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:54,430
Want to see? Hold on.

1912
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:57,930
-See this.
-Oh God.

1913
01:56:58,060 --> 01:56:59,430
Papa, you also watch.

1914
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:01,350
Disgusting, Rohit.

1915
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,680
-You'll rot in hell.
-Uncle!

1916
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:09,470
I had told you.
There is no oxygen here.

1917
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:11,510
There is carbon dioxide here.

1918
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:14,430
Jerk. See.

1919
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:20,720
Haseena, when did you record this video?

1920
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:24,350
I sensed that your
intentions were not good

1921
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:27,180
when you were carrying me
to the bedroom from the sofa.

1922
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:30,560
Excuse me. look,
I had stopped you from coming inside.

1923
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,600
And also these two from taking you inside.

1924
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,220
Bu you were saying that if she yields,

1925
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:35,760
-I'll go first.
-Really?

1926
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:38,760
I could hear everything.

1927
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:41,060
Which means that the girl is cunning.

1928
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:42,930
He is right. She is very fast.

1929
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:46,060
Didn't you see? How she was
gesturing to us by way of her stuff?

1930
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:48,220
-Yes. And what was she saying?
-What?

1931
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:50,810
-You could need condom anytime.
-Say.

1932
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:57,970
Disgusting. You're a really bad person.

1933
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:02,140
Sweety, I had told you beforehand
to stay away from this crook.

1934
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:06,930
The kids who don't listen
to their parents always suffer.

1935
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:08,180
-Sorry.
-Our bad.

1936
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:09,640
We've made a mistake.

1937
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,640
-Please forgive us.
-Hands up.

1938
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:15,220
And we've also got the
punishment for our misdeeds.

1939
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:17,060
Yes, we've suffered a lot.

1940
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:25,720
-Pritam, where are you? Come fast.
-We're at the door.

1941
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:28,060
Okay. The door is open.
Come inside quickly.

1942
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:29,180
Okay.

1943
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:33,970
Here.

1944
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,260
-Come fast.
-Who are they?

1945
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:39,310
Haseena...

1946
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:42,600
Damn!

1947
01:58:43,470 --> 01:58:45,600
-Is everything fine?
-What took you so long?

1948
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,930
Haseena, the cops are outside.

1949
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:48,850
We got in the moment it left.

1950
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:52,600
-These people?
-They are my men.

1951
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:56,510
Haseena, you're so naÃ¯ve.

1952
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,560
These are pest control people.
I know them.

1953
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:59,850
They were here in the morning.

1954
01:59:01,350 --> 01:59:03,760
Smarty. You're so naÃ¯ve.

1955
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:06,350
-They are my men.
-Really?

1956
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,220
They came to your house on my orders.

1957
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:13,760
We had to survey the house, you see.

1958
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:18,640
Brother, this is cheating.
Pure cheating.

1959
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:23,180
Pritam, barring this
smarty tie everyone up.

1960
01:59:23,310 --> 01:59:24,930
Why are you tying us up?
What have we done

1961
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:26,640
Grab them.

1962
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:27,890
Grab them.

1963
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:30,260
Get in line. Get in line.

1964
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:33,060
-Come on. No noise. Come on.
-Papa. Sweety.

1965
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:35,260
Tie them. No one makes a sound.

1966
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:37,640
-Why are you tying us?
-Rahul.

1967
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,510
-Haseena, why are you doing that?
-Quiet.

1968
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,560
-Leave us.
-Shut your mouth.

1969
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,680
What have we done?
What have we done?

1970
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:45,890
-Leave us.
-Why?

1971
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:46,890
Why are you doing this?

1972
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:49,260
-You dog. We are in a mess now.
-Sorry.

1973
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:52,430
And smarty, you.
Go and help them out a little.

1974
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,510
-Who?
-Tell them. What's in the safe? And where?

1975
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,890
-No. No. Please.
-Come on.

1976
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:58,470
What are you doing? I'll be ruined.

1977
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:00,600
-Come on.
-Please let me go.

1978
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,970
-Please.
-Come on, go.

1979
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:05,810
Rohit, don't tell them.

1980
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:08,010
-Leave. Leave him.
-Son.

1981
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,720
Where are you taking me?

1982
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:11,810
-Where are you taking him?
-You will ruin him.

1983
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:13,140
Please. Let us go.

1984
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,010
We won't repeat our mistake.

1985
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:17,100
You beat us up. What else do you want?

1986
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,890
-Let us go.
-Leave me. Forgive me.

1987
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:22,720
I'll never peep into any room again.

1988
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:25,720
-Let her go. Leave us.
-Haseena, you're so nice.

1989
02:00:25,850 --> 02:00:28,600
You're so beautiful. Let us go.

1990
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,760
Rohit.

1991
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,180
-How did it come to this?
-Why did you give all that?

1992
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:33,600
-Hurry. Bring it fast.
-Where are you taking him?

1993
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,100
Rohit. Rohit.

1994
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:37,010
-He's ruined.
-Come on. Come fast.

1995
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:39,350
-Rahul.
-Look.

1996
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:40,810
Be quiet.

1997
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:43,260
-Brother. Hello.
-He'll be ruined.

1998
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:44,600
Haseena.

1999
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:47,260
Where is this stuff going?

2000
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,560
-Leave us.
-Pritam.

2001
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:54,680
-Leave with them. I'll come.
-Hey.

2002
02:00:54,810 --> 02:00:55,970
Okay, get up.

2003
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,010
Haseena, leave quickly.

2004
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:01,850
Listen. Wait.

2005
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:04,640
I'm ruined. They took everything.

2006
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:12,430
Till jerks like you exist people like
Haseena will never be out of business.

2007
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:22,010
Tough luck.

2008
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,930
<i>Oh Haseena</i>

2009
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:29,930
Thief. Thief.

2010
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:32,350

-Catch her.

Rohit, how did it come to this?

2015
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,600
Very sad. Very sad.

2016
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:24,930
You know what?
I've learnt a lesson today.

2017
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:26,430
What?

2018
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,010
That you should never
be in company of bad friends.

2019
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:32,140
You never know where, when
or how they might put you in trouble.

2020
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,180
-Yeah.
-What did you lose? Nothing.

2021
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:36,470
I have lost everything.

2022
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:39,640
-Now where do I look for that chick?
-Yes.

2023
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:11,140
Yes?

I've come from Golden Section Company.

some of my graphic designs.

2027

Sorry. I'm busy.

2028
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,760
Sir, I'll take just five minutes.
So can I come inside?

2029

-Thank you.
