2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,130
The girl saw us! Nab her quickly!
Don't let her escape!

3
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,182
What are you all staring at?
Come with me!

4
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,240
Madam! What are you doing?

5
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,950
Don't you know that you shouldn't try
to get on a moving bus?

6
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,420
What's the matter, Khanna?
- Nothing!

7
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,220
A girl almost died just now!

8
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,410
Madam you brought your handbag
and left your brains at home!

9
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,000
If you got hurt,
your face would have been disfigured,

10
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,180
and you'd die a spinster.

11
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,740
No! Even a blind man
wouldn't mind marrying her!

12
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,120
Want to bet 10 to 1?

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,930
You! This is not the Derby
for you to make bets.

14
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,230
Sit in your place!

15
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,920
Khanna! The last seat is vacant.
Let the girl sit there.

16
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,760
Rajesh, you just drive the bus!

17
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,410
I know where the passengers
should sit and stand.

18
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,800
You always interfere in
my work! Stupid driver!

19
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,270
Stupid conductor!
You argue with the driver!

20
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,230
Shut up!

21
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,750
Ma'am, go take that window seat.

22
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,280
Pandit! Why did you stand up?

23
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,920
She is young enough to be
your daughter! - Bless you!

24
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,700
Wow! You are so old!
And yet you're ogling.

25
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,130
Oh my god! What are you saying?

26
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,680
What am I saying? Sit comfortably!
And invoke the name of god!

27
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,320
Shame on you!

28
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Pundit, you stop staring too!

29
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,350
Madam, where do you want to go?

30
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,360
Where is this bus heading?

31
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
To its destination!
Where do you want to go?

32
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,310
I mean which is the last bus stop?

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,490
The bus depot!

34
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,470
Not depot!
The last stop is the junk shop!

35
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
Who said that?

36
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,790
Father said it!

37
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,520
You old man! The last stop
of this bus is the junk shop?

38
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,870
Do you know where your last stop is?
The cremation ground!

39
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,190
People will lay you down on
the wood and burn you with kerosene!

40
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,920
Move! Madam, where do
you want a ticket to?

41
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,060
The last stop.
- The last stop is Goa. Panjim.

42
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,160
Then give me a ticket to Goa.
- Give me 30 rupees 25 paisa.

43
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,930
Kumbkaran! Sit straight!

44
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,270
Where is it?

45
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,540
Is this a note?

46
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,020
A thousand rupee note!
- A thousand rupee note!

47
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me see.

48
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,840
If you tear it,
madam won't spare me!

49
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,910
Madam, such a big note won't work
for the Bombay to Goa route!

50
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,500
I have no change!

51
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,510
I am sorry. I gave it to you in my rush.

52
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,610
I will give you another note.

53
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,500
Wow! What a passenger!

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,890
A 1000 rupee note
or a 100 rupee note!

55
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,320
I have sufficient change.
Here is your ticket!

56
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,700
Ma'am, I will give you Rs. 9.75 soon.

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Wow!

58
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,730
Is this your handbag?
- What do you mean?

59
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,290
I meant hold your handbag tight!

60
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,300
This is a bus!
You may be robbed in no time!

61
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,430
You! Do you have a ticket?

62
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,980
Yes! I booked it 3 days ago.

63
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,900
Come on!

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,000
You! Ticket!

65
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,960
Here!

66
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,760
Mother!
- Who are you calling mother?

67
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,940
Sister!
- Yes! I bought the ticket.

68
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,740
And you?
- She is my daughter.

69
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,120
Did you buy a ticket for her?
- Yes!

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,130
Conductor, give my 70 paise.

71
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,250
Wait! I'm not going to leave the bus
and run away with your 70 paisa!

72
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,060
Sorry!

73
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,070
Who put this wooden rod in between?

74
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,290
Conductor! What did you say?

75
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,180
This is not a wooden rod.
It is my boss's leg!

76
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,030
You fool!

77
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,880
If it is your boss's leg
then why don't you put it up?

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,150
Don't be insolent!
- Don't touch me!

79
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,860
Do you know who he is?

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,460
He is India's
greatest boxer John Ragada.

81
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,860
He is going to Goa to fight the
best boxer in the world, Clay!

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,500
If you are insolent to him,

83
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,600
he will break all your
teeth with one punch!

84
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,940
Let go! Why are you holding my chest?

85
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,740
Leave me.

86
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,810
Look, brother. We all are one,
travelling in the same bus.

87
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,450
So your boss is my boss.
Your mother is my mother.

88
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,340
My father is your father.
Your wife is my..

89
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,300
What did you say?
- My sister!

90
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,190
So you're on the right path!
- Yes!

91
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,780
Boss! Shake hands!

92
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,890
My hand!
Look, I will give your change later.

93
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,100
My hand is broken!

94
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,070
Boss!

95
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,170
That girl escaped on a bus to Goa!

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,390
A bus?
- Yes, boss. MP travels!

97
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,650
Kalia!

98
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,910
Fine! No problem! Come with me!

99
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,170
Mummy!

100
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,360
What happened, baby?
- Look there!

101
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,220
Shameless girl!
She is powdering her face in front of everybody!

102
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,160
Mother!
- Mother!

103
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,450
No! Sister!

104
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,470
It's wrong to powder
your face in public!

105
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,770
But you can apply lipstick, right?

106
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,190
Why are you
eavesdropping on our conversation?

107
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,960
With such a nice face,
I'm bound to eavesdrop.

108
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,390
You are a nice guy.

109
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,030
You seem to belong to an
affluent family like us.

110
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,510
What are you doing?

111
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,190
Please remove your fat hand!

112
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,120
Which family do you belong to?

113
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,400
The most illustrious family
among all the stage artists!

114
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:43,510
In my time, when I stepped
on stage, it would shake.

115
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,360
I am sure it must have!

116
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,290
Even the bus is shaking!
- You are joking.

117
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,990
Look you make
the stage and bus shake!

118
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,880
Your daughter doesn't do anything?

119
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,390
My daughter is being groomed.

120
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,740
When she makes her debut on stage,

121
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,090
she will become renowned all over India.

122
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,810
I don't know about that.
But she will definitely cause an uproar.

123
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,440
Mother, no, sister.

124
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,000
Sister, if you can't find a
stage hero for your daughter,

125
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,510
do keep me in mind.

126
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,860
Maybe I could come to
your daughter's aid!

127
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,830
Would only you be left
for my daughter?

128
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,880
You idiotic man!
- Wow!

129
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,270
Hurry up! The bus has arrived!

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,420
Come on!
- Yes! Coming!

131
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,520
Come on!

132
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,370
You?
- Wait! My husband!

133
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,210
Your husband!

134
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,940
Husband, hurry or
your wife will leave!

135
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,990
Come on!
- My slippers!

136
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,000
Your slippers!

137
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,290
Kishore Kumar!

138
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,090
Yes!

139
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,370
Kishore Kumar!

140
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,160
Move back! Move!

141
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,180
Enough!

142
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,650
Are you Kishore Kumar?
- Do you think I am mad?

143
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,110
Remove your spectacles.
- What?

144
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,450
Your spectacles!
- Here!

145
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,970
Yes! He is Kishore Kumar!

146
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,440
But what are you doing
here in this scorching heat?

147
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,030
What do I tell you?
My car has broken down.

148
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,840
We were lucky that your car broke down.

149
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,430
Or how would we have got
the chance to meet you?

150
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,770
Right, Rajesh?
- Yes, Khanna!

151
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,110
Rajesh Khanna?

152
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,880
You two got together and decided on that name?
- Yes, we are his fans!

153
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,850
Fan?
- Fan!

154
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,200
But forget that!
You are too good!

155
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,210
I swear on god! You
were so great in Aradhna!

156
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,640
I want to touch your feet, I swear!

157
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,190
I did not work in that movie.
Rajesh Khanna worked in that movie!

158
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,000
You were too good in Kati Patang!
- Yes!

159
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Not I, Rajesh Khanna!

160
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,140
Mr. Kishore, you don't understand!

161
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,810
We are not talking about acting!

162
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,290
Then? - We are actors.
We are talking about your songs.

163
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,130
You sang so well!
That song in Aradhana!

164
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,150
"A beautiful girl lives in
the house opposite mine."

165
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,030
That is the song from the movie Mehmood!

166
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,790
Yes! That was in the movie Padosan!
- Yes!

167
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,640
"Queen of my dreams,
when will you come?"

168
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,820
And that one
"In life's old journey."

169
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,460
Not old, lovely.
- Yes, lovely!

170
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,180
Enough!

171
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,030
If you start singing,
I will have to quit the industry!

172
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,290
Mr. Kishore,
the industry will never leave you!

173
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,880
But what were you doing here?

174
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,140
I was on my way for
the shooting of the movie Love in Bombay.

175
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,020
In Panvel?
- Yes!

176
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,740
Your car broke down?
- Yes!

177
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,750
Then come by our bus!
- Bus?

178
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,550
Why not?
Our bus is worth 1.5 lakhs!

179
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,020
And your car is worth just 50 lakhs!
- Not 50! Say 15 lakhs!

180
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,950
Why do you want me to get into trouble
with the income tax department?

181
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,920
How can the income tax
officers bother you?

182
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,390
It's you who put
the income tax officers in trouble!

183
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Lower your voice!

184
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,150
Abdul!

185
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,540
Bring the car when it's ready!
- Let's go!

186
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,260
Rajesh, start the bus.
- Which bus?

187
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,470
It belongs to MP travels.

188
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,270
Kishore Kumar!
- Kishore Kumar!

189
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,410
Let them see.

190
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,330
Come on!

191
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,510
Don't worry. Come!

192
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,730
What is it?

193
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,580
Come.

194
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,600
What?

195
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,780
You all have never seen an actor?

196
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,290
You

197
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,170
Here, Mr. Kishore! Here is your ticket!

198
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,690
But I was going for my shoot.
I haven't got any money.

199
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,330
Who is asking for money?
I will pay the money to the company.

200
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,430
When else will I get the chance
to serve an artist like you?

201
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,230
Thank you!
- Mention not!

202
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,740
Greetings, Kishore Kumar!
- Greetings!

203
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,840
Greetings!
- Greetings!

204
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,800
Which movie
- Move!

205
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,060
Thank you so much!

206
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,290
Where are you going?
- What? My name is Mala.

207
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,220
I didn't ask your name.
I said where are you going?

208
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,740
Goa.
- Goa!

209
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,130
Do you live there?
- No. My house is in Bombay.

210
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,550
Bombay!

211
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,580
Do you like movies?
- What?

212
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,630
I mean watching movies?
- Yes.

213
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,240
You have a beautiful face.
You can become a movie star.

214
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,260
A movie star?
- Yes.

215
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,060
No.
- Why not?

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,080
I hate actors!

217
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,060
I understand. Maybe like others,
you too have a bad opinion of actors.

218
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,780
But that's not true.

219
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,840
You find good and
bad people in every profession.

220
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,270
In business, society, government!

221
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,630
It depends on what
kind of a person you meet.

222
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,010
'Yes, Mala.'

223
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,940
'Before labelling
others bad, just think.'

224
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,330
'Your craze to become an
actress had blinded you.'

225
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,770
'And without thinking you got
trapped in by a man so devious.'

226
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,340
"My body is getting
drenched in the cold water."

227
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,020
"My body is smouldering."

228
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,080
"It is making me go crazy.
- Love!"

229
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,510
"Now I understood.
- Love!"

230
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,230
"That's what happened to me.
- Love!"

231
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,790
"Because of it I am in trouble."

232
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,930
"How do I reveal this secret?"

233
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,280
"I can't even say it."

234
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,140
"No matter how much
I want to keep quiet, I can't."

235
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,420
"Life is dull."

236
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,970
"The air is moist."

237
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,590
"What happened to me today?"

238
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,930
"My behaviour is different."

239
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,490
"What do I explain to you?"

240
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,730
"The water is blue."

241
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,320
"My body is wet."

242
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,900
"My body is smouldering."

243
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,830
"It is making me go crazy.
- Love!"

244
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,380
"Now I understood.
- Love!"

245
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,930
"That's what happened to me.
- Love!"

246
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,500
"Because of it I am in trouble."

247
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,310
Mr. Sharma! I made all the enquiries.

248
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,290
She is a golden bird.
Her name is Mala!

249
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,100
Her father Aatmaram
drinks water in a silver glass

250
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,280
and eats from a golden plate.

251
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,760
And the girl dreams of
becoming a movie star.

252
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,260
Then my work is done.

253
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,280
Come on! We too will
drink water in silver glass.

254
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,920
And eat from a golden plate.

255
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,920
Come on!
- Let's go!

256
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,640
Listen. You remember our technique?

257
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,610
Yes!
- Then let's go!

258
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,940
Excuse me.
- Yes, what do you want?

259
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,160
I am the photographer
for a film magazine.

260
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,470
May I click your snap in this dress?
- Why?

261
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,870
I will publish it in our magazine,
and prove that

262
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,770
there's beauty not just among movie
stars, but outside the film industry too.

263
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,450
Thank you.
- Mr. Verma.

264
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,540
Yes.
- If she doesn't mind,

265
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,020
send one copy of her snap
to Sharma International too!

266
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,120
Who is he?
- Pardon me. I forgot to introduce him.

267
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,880
He has just come down
from Africa. Mr. Sharma.

268
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,680
She is Ms. Mala.

269
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,140
How do you do?
- How do you do?

270
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,530
But how do you know my name?

271
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,910
This is strange.

272
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,430
There aren't many beautiful
girls like you in this city.

273
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,940
One.
- Or maximum two.

274
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,250
Yes. And it's not
difficult to find out their names.

275
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,480
So what was I saying?
Mr. Sharma has recently come down from East Africa.

276
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,070
There he owns a big factory
that manufactures elephant teeth.

277
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,590
He has come to India to make movies,
so he's looking for new faces.

278
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,900
Is that so?

279
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,540
I want to act in movies too.

280
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,220
I won many awards in
school and college for acting.

281
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,360
Will you give me
a chance in your movie?

282
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,910
What are you saying?

283
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,510
We need you. And you need us.

284
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,900
Mr. Verma the snap
must be true to life!

285
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,250
Hurry up! If the drops of
water on her skin dry up,

286
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,250
the snap will not look natural.
- Correct.

287
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,140
You stand right there.

288
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,990
Give a smiling pose!

289
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,830
Click!
- To the left!

290
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,800
Excuse me, madam! Ms. Mala,
autograph please!

291
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,230
Autograph?
- Yes!

292
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,360
Who are you?
- Forget who I am.

293
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,220
I just know that someday you
will definitely be a big film star!

294
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,320
Then I may have to be
born again to get to you!

295
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,370
So why don't I take
your autograph right now?

296
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,220
Please, Ms. Mala! Sign on my autograph book
with your delicate hands.

297
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,150
Mister!

298
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,460
Don't interfere in
somebody's personal matters! Got it?

299
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,470
Mr. Verma, click the photo.

300
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,900
And you move!

301
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,410
I won't! Go away!

302
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,720
Are you going to move politely or not?

303
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,280
Mister! I didn't ask
you before coming here,

304
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,710
and I won't leave just
because you tell me to.

305
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,960
Ms. Mala!

306
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,020
Please! Autograph!
- Look..

307
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,080
I think he wants to be beaten up.

308
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,420
Ms. Mala, come here!

309
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,110
Steady! Smile!

310
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,530
Ready!

311
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,450
One..

312
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,970
Stop! Hang on!

313
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,810
Go ahead!

314
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,240
Mister! What is going on?

315
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,870
This is the limit of tomfoolery.
- Who is jesting, mister?

316
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,920
Look, you are looking for a heroine!

317
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,230
And you are getting a hero with her too.
Sign on both of us.

318
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,610
Hold this.
- Okay.

319
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,510
I think now I will have
to do away with decency.

320
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,700
"I have given up decency."

321
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,940
See, ma'am? I converted one into a fish!

322
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,380
Now what do you want, mister?
- I don't argue with scum.

323
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,690
Ms. Mala! Hang on! Listen to me!

324
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,670
Look, god gives beauty,
but we have to safeguard it!

325
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,400
You should be careful in your youth.
- Come on!

326
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,720
Whether you believe
or not Is up to you.

327
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,240
My duty was just
to explain to you.

328
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,080
Give a sexy pose!

329
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,510
Yes!

330
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't move!

331
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,150
Steady!

332
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,410
Done! Thank you!

333
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,970
Ms. Mala, what are you doing day
after tomorrow in the evening?

334
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,400
Day after tomorrow
I have to go to college.

335
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,380
I am asking about the evening.
Come to Playboy restaurant, if you can.

336
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,390
Playboy restaurant?
- Yes.

337
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,200
We couldn't really talk. Let
us sit down and talk there.

338
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,710
I will try.
- Thank you.

339
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,630
Bye.

340
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,450
Is this how young girls behave?

341
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,590
Did you hear me?
Mala left for college in the morning.

342
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,190
And now its 9 p.m. and
she's still not returned.

343
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,870
You give her so much freedom,
she's getting ruined by the day.

344
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
Wife, she is my only daughter.

345
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,900
She must be partying with her friends.
She will be back soon. - No!

346
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,660
Now her partying must stop!

347
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,630
She should be home before 7 p.m.

348
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,200
And get her married to a
nice boy as soon as you can.

349
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,720
Mummy, it's better if you chain my legs,
so I can't walk or go anywhere.

350
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,570
Dear, your mother has been
shouting at me for so long.

351
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,380
I went to Rita's house.
She insisted on having tea.

352
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,010
I spent an hour there.

353
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,400
We were all together.
Rita dropped them home first.

354
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,950
And she just dropped me.

355
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,260
But daddy, mummy always scolds me.

356
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,040
You've educated me so much,
now let me be responsible too.

357
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,210
Certainly!

358
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,810
Look, mother of Mala.
Don't talk nonsense about my daughter.

359
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,160
I will say it countless times!

360
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,130
People in the locality are so orthodox.

361
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,110
Seeing a young girl return home
so late at night,

362
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,280
god knows what they must be saying!
- Mummy,

363
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,470
if you want, from tomorrow
I will stop going to college.

364
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,110
I will sit at home
the whole day and clean or cook.

365
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,120
Dear, what are you proposing?
She will jump at it!

366
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,980
Wife, when you have
tolerated a man like me for 25 years,

367
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,570
put up with this
small habit of hers too.

368
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,040
This is the limit!
You're always joking!

369
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,030
Dear, Mother scolded you. Not I.

370
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,050
Don't eat for your mother's sake.
Eat for my sake.

371
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,070
Daddy!
- Come on, dear!

372
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,520
Rita! Why has Mala still not come?

373
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,070
You know that she is always late.

374
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,950
Hi!
- Hi!

375
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,000
Mala, you are so late!
- I am so sorry!

376
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,140
So what if she is late?
At least she has come!

377
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,730
Excuse me! Thank you!

378
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,020
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,300
we proudly present to you
the one and only Usha lyer!

380
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,750
"Listen to the golden rain."

381
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,590
"Listen to the downpour."

382
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,540
"And with every drop of rain,
I love you more."

383
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,230
"What if it rains all night long?"

384
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,700
"Let my love for you grow strong."

385
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,380
"As long as we are together."

386
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,310
"Who cares about the weather?"

387
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,710
"You came."

388
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,810
"I was alone."

389
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,960
"I should have known."

390
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,140
"You were temptation."

391
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,450
"You smiled."

392
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,050
"Leading me on."

393
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,230
"My heart was wrong."

394
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,960
"You were temptation."

395
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,800
"Married a female wrestler,
as massive as can be."

396
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,320
"And she had bulgy muscles
which quite fascinated me."

397
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,830
"She said she loved me truly,
she also said by heck"

398
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,640
"If ever I catch you messing around,
I'll break your lovely neck."

399
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,290
"What shall I do,
how shall I love my skin?"

400
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,970
"I married a female wrestler.
Now look at the mess I am in."

401
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,990
"Never know how much I hate you."

402
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,460
"Never know how much I don't care."

403
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,230
"When you touch me,
you give me a fever."

404
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,370
"You give me a fever
but you are off today."

405
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,920
''You give me fever."

406
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,320
"When you touch me."
Fever, when you hold me close."

407
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,120
"Fever."

408
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,650
"My baby's going to give me fever."

409
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,570
"She is my baby."

410
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,170
"Don't mean maybe."

411
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,180
"She is my baby."

412
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,480
"Love my baby, love."

413
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,840
"It's the wrong time."

414
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,430
"And the wrong place."

415
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,650
"Though your face is lovely,
it's the wrong face."

416
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,290
"It's not his face,
but it's such a lovely face."

417
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,930
"That it's alright with me."

418
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,700
"It's the wrong song,
in the wrong style."

419
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,630
"Though your smile is lovely,
it's the wrong smile."

420
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,980
It's not his smile,
but such a lovely smile."

421
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,490
"That it's all right with me."

422
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,430
"She is my baby."

423
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,400
"Don't mean maybe."

424
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,740
"It's the wrong time.
And the wrong place."

425
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,410
Stop it! I can't sing!

426
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,420
I married a female wrestler..

427
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,870
Excuse me! Thank you!

428
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,700
Mister!
- Yes, madam!

429
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,870
What insolence is this?

430
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,470
Insolence? Here is your money!

431
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,680
Why are you being my enemy?

432
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Enemy?

433
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,000
Madam my intention is friendship.

434
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,890
If you consider this enmity,
I am very sorry!

435
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,780
Because of you Usha
lyer got angry and left!

436
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,630
What if I say that she got
angry and left because of you?

437
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,720
Why didn't you let her
sing a song of her choice?

438
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,310
Madam! What is there to fight about?

439
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,160
You wanted to hear your favorite songs.
I wanted to hear mine.

440
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,260
You are arrogant because of your money!
Do you know who I am?

441
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,040
Madam, I came to this restaurant
to eat a chicken sandwich,

442
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,630
not to ask your father's bank balance!

443
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,390
Shut up!
- You shut up!

444
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,200
Ms. Mala! Come here!

445
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,750
I will tackle this shameless man!

446
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,910
Get up!

447
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,800
What are you looking at?
Get up!

448
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:01,920
Come here!

449
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,020
What is going on?

450
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,410
Help!

451
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,120
Stop! Move!

452
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,540
Shut up!
- Move!

453
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,150
Is this a restaurant or a wrestling
- Ground!

454
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,330
How much is your bill?
- Nothing!

455
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,460
Yours?
- Nothing!

456
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,520
You didn't eat anything!
And unnecessarily you made me suffer a - Loss!

457
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,530
You come to the restaurant and
- Fight!

458
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,130
I will call
- The police!

459
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,220
Go!

460
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,780
Thank you!

461
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,210
One is tall! And one is fast!

462
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,370
Are you hurt?
- It's nothing, Ms. Mala!

463
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,840
If that manager had not intervened,

464
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,890
I would have thrashed him black and blue!
- Yes, Ms. Mala!

465
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,870
When Mr. Sharma started
his elephant teeth factory in East Africa

466
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,550
he would never buy the
teeth of dead elephants.

467
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,230
Then? - He would go to the jungle,
pounce on a live elephant,

468
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,370
and extract his teeth!

469
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,710
Right, Mr. Sharma?
- What are you saying, Mr. Verma?

470
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,930
How brave!

471
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,570
Thank you! Ms. Mala, you may be
running late today.

472
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,580
And your mood is not good either.

473
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,560
So you keep this card.

474
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,160
And come to my office
tomorrow in the evening.

475
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,200
Okay.

476
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,070
Let's not waste time.

477
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,120
I will take her to buy
the costume and makeup.

478
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,420
Tomorrow is her trial.

479
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,660
First ask her if she
wants to be a heroine.

480
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,120
You are right.

481
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,970
So Ms. Mala, what have you decided?

482
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,690
Are you really asking me that?

483
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,970
Oh no! I really can't believe it!

484
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,440
Could I really be a heroine?

485
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,910
Listen to her!

486
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,210
What are you saying, Ms. Mala?

487
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,400
Nowadays even ugly girls become heroines!
And you can't?

488
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,130
Features like yours
- Even Sophia Lorraine

489
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,890
and Elizabeth Taylor aren't so gorgeous!

490
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,810
Right, Mr. Sharma?
- Yes, Mr. Verma!

491
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,730
Thank you so much!
- You are absolutely right!

492
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,920
Thank you so much!
I am so thrilled!

493
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,930
You..
- Mr. Verma, we are going shopping.

494
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,700
Ask the cashier for 2000 rupees.
- Mr. Sharma, did you forget?

495
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,510
The cashier took half
day leave in the afternoon.

496
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,940
My Goodness! Now there is a problem!

497
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,030
Tomorrow is Sunday and
the shops will be closed.

498
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,830
Yes.
- We have to wait till Monday.

499
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,300
Correct.
- Why wait?

500
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,150
I have the money. I will pay it.
- Wow!

501
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,200
On the very first day she has
become a partner In our firm.

502
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,590
And she is making the
first investment too.

503
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,730
Mr. Verma, how can we allow this?
- What's the harm, Mr. Sharma?

504
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,570
Whether you or I pay,
it's the same thing.

505
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,250
But the work mustn't be delayed.
- Yes! It mustn't.

506
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,440
Come, let's go now!
- Let's go!

507
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,650
Thank you!

508
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,910
Cab!

509
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,550
Now you will go home, won't you?
- Yes.

510
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,890
Fine.

511
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,820
I have some work.
I will get down on the way. - Okay.

512
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,550
Come.

513
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,170
Let's go.

514
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,610
Okay, Ms. Mala!
Thank you very much!

515
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,550
And come tomorrow in the evening
for your makeup trial.

516
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,430
Okay.
- Okay!

517
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,350
Good night!
- Good night!

518
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,190
Let's go, driver!

519
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,080
Good night!

520
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,480
How much is the fare?

521
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,550
What fare? I am crazy about you!

522
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,730
You!

523
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,300
Yes! I take any excuse to serve you.

524
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,310
So go to hell!

525
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,330
Ma'am, you are the one
who is going to hell.

526
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,010
Never mind. We will go together.

527
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,190
Bye!

528
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,390
Wow! Fabulous!

529
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,910
What style! What grace!

530
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,840
Here! Have some sweets!

531
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,970
Today is your first
makeup test. Take this.

532
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,820
Enough applause.
- Ms. Mala, I am telling the truth.

533
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,700
The day you enter the film industry,

534
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,810
all our heroines will be out of work!
- Correct!

535
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,980
Shut up! Sycophant!

536
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,990
Take this.
- Thank you, boss.

537
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,910
Mr. Verma!
- Yes!

538
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,920
Why are we wasting time?
Are her snaps ready?

539
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,670
Yes!
- Come!

540
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,090
Amey, follow with the top.

541
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,950
Congratulations!
- Thank you!

542
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,720
Steady!

543
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,390
Stop!

544
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,530
Now it's okay!
- Ready!

545
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:02,300
Wow!

546
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,300
Ms. Mala!
- Yes!

547
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,700
Our cameraman, costume designer, makeup man,
they're all smitten by you.

548
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,390
And they keep praising you!
And that's increasing my problems.

549
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,310
Why?

550
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,590
There is a problem
pairing you with a hero.

551
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,850
I can't find someone
who'll look good with you.

552
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,250
Mr. Sharma, why don't
you approach a famous hero?

553
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,350
Madam, I was thinking that too.

554
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,700
But there is a problem.
- What?

555
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,470
What do I tell you, Ms. Mala?
I hope you don't misunderstand.

556
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,910
I closed down my business in Africa.

557
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,960
But most of my money is lying there.

558
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,600
Now, if I signed on a famous hero,
I'll need a bigger budget.

559
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,160
I want to tell you something.
- What?

560
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,850
Perhaps you may not like it.

561
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,870
But now I don't consider you a stranger.

562
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,810
If you can arrange for 1-2 lakhs,
we can put together a nice proposal.

563
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,360
Right, Mr. Verma?
- Yes, Mr. Sharma.

564
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,340
Signing on a famous hero
will make her renowned.

565
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,300
And our business will be taken
care of quickly, too. - Exactly!

566
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,730
That is what I am saying!
You are thinking it over.

567
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,530
Look, there is no compulsion.

568
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,920
Think about it and give us an answer.
- Okay.

569
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,310
I will let you know in a day or two.
- Certainly.

570
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,240
Fine.
- Take your own time!

571
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,200
May I leave now?

572
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,750
Bye!
- Bye!

573
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,180
Mala's mother!
- What happened?

574
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,610
Did you see this snap?

575
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,920
She looks like Mala!
- She is Mala!

576
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,510
Look what is written below.

577
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,750
Sharma International's new heroine Mala!

578
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,140
Look! And see this!

579
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,110
She betrayed us!

580
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,290
Mala!
- Mala!

581
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,010
Mala!
- Coming, daddy!

582
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,480
What's the matter, mummy?
Why are you both shouting?

583
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,030
I am not shouting.

584
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,920
I am lamenting my
death reading this news!

585
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,650
Look! Such an indecent snap.

586
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,750
That is my snap!
Daddy, what is there to scream about?

587
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,050
It's just my snap that's published!

588
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,440
This is not a snap!
It's a slap on my face!

589
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,720
Your mother rebuked me so many times
for giving you so much freedom.

590
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:06,500
And I because of my love
for you always scolded her.

591
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,510
You took advantage of
my love and kindness!

592
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:16,250
Daddy! Has anybody from
our family had a snap published before?

593
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,300
You should be happy, daddy

594
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,980
Your daughter is
making your family proud!

595
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,750
If you wanted to bring the family fame,

596
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,760
you should have set this house ablaze!

597
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,640
There would have been a commotion.

598
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,740
Why did you ruin my
reputation like this?

599
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,500
So what, daddy?
- Now what is left?

600
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,810
What will our relatives
say about your obscene snaps?

601
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,990
Mummy, you think this snap is obscene!

602
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,210
But it has some value in
the eyes of the world!

603
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,480
This is an artistic photograph!
It's not obscene.

604
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,450
Such indecency can never be artistic.

605
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,720
And your in-laws are decent people!

606
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,190
They won't consider
this snap a piece of art.

607
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,920
If they are orthodox
people who ride bullock carts

608
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,390
in this jet age,
it's not my fault?

609
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,360
And what do I have to do with them?

610
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,790
Daddy, today I want to
tell you something clearly.

611
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,470
I am not ready for marriage!

612
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,450
I want to become a film star!

613
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,920
What? You want to be a movie star?

614
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,930
Now I know why you
come home late at night!

615
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,240
You have really deceived your parents!

616
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,750
Today there was a debate, tomorrow this,
day after tomorrow that!

617
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,100
Is this what decent girls aspire to be?
- Yes, daddy!

618
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,740
That's what I want to be!

619
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,970
Fine! Then this is a serious matter!

620
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:45,500
Mala, if that's your decision
then here's mine.

621
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:50,320
From today your partying,
picnics, gallivanting will end.

622
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,570
Daddy!

623
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,880
And from tomorrow you
can't go to college! - Daddy!

624
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,980
You will get married next month!
- Daddy!

625
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,990
Go!
- Daddy!

626
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,170
Daddy!

627
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,600
Mr. Sharma! That's why I came here
secretly to seek your advice.

628
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,160
What should I do?

629
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,710
You are my friend,
philosopher and guide.

630
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,230
Mala, you are giving
me a big responsibility!

631
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,000
Let it be.
When you trust me so much,

632
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,930
I too will stand by you at all times.

633
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,820
Right now, I think Mala,
there is only one option left for you.

634
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,510
Tonight take all the money
that you can from your house,

635
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,400
and come to meet me.

636
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,660
What?

637
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,000
Run away from home?

638
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,260
Leave my parents?

639
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,740
Ms. Mala, you can't achieve
success without sacrifice.

640
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,040
Mr. Verma, you say something too.

641
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,040
Mr. Sharma, what do I say?

642
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:01,580
Ms. Mala, on one hand
fame is beckoning you.

643
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,640
And on the other hand the poison

644
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,660
of marriage wants to grab you.

645
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,170
Now Ms. Mala, you are intelligent.

646
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,880
Think and take a decision.

647
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,070
You won't get another chance.

648
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,750
Got it, Kalia?
- Yes.

649
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,640
Come, Ms. Mala!

650
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,310
Mr. Sharma, Ms. Mala has come.

651
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,550
At last you have come.
- First take this!

652
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,810
Have you counted it?

653
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,070
No! I took whatever
I could get a hold of.

654
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,210
Maybe it's more than you expect.

655
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,720
Ms. Mala, we too will prove to
be more than what you expected!

656
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,240
Now sit here comfortably.

657
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,660
Wipe the sweat from your forehead.

658
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,300
You have left that world now.
Why you are you worrying?

659
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,640
Right, Mr. Verma?
- Yes, Mr. Sharma!

660
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,730
I will keep this somewhere.

661
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,490
Listen!
- Yes, boss!

662
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,090
Look after madam!
- Boss, I understand.

663
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,260
Come.

664
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,170
Listen!
- Did you say anything to me?

665
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,150
Did you say anything to me?

666
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,780
Tell Mr. Sharma to come quickly!

667
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,830
I will call him.
Meanwhile you drink this.

668
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,170
Have it.

669
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,560
Have it.

670
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,400
Well done! The girl has
brought so much money.

671
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,340
Ismail, here is your share.
- Thank you, boss!

672
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,560
Babban, here is your share.
- Thanks, boss!

673
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,480
Nasir!
- Thank you, boss!

674
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,830
Boss, my share!
- Come.

675
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,720
Gopal, you too.
- Thank you, Boss.

676
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,980
Junior, here!
- Thank you, boss.

677
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,490
You be happy, too.

678
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,800
You take this, too!
What about that girl?

679
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,020
I gave her coke. In 2 minutes

680
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,080
Stop whistling! Take it.
- Yes!

681
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,260
Now Mr. Verma's share! One!
You should get double the share.

682
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,350
So two!

683
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,540
What happened?

684
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,140
Just 2 bundles won't do for me!

685
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,450
I want equal share in this loot!
- Equal share?

686
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:30,270
Yes! Don't forget that I enticed
the girl who brought this money!

687
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,080
Enticing Mala was not
your cup of tea, Mr. Sharma.

688
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,010
Give me half the share, fast.

689
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,530
What if I don't?

690
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:48,020
Then Mr. Sharma, you know
what is the punishment for

691
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,360
instigating an innocent and
decent girl to commit robbery

692
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,270
and luring her with the glamour of
the film industry to leave her house?

693
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,630
Meaning you have a plan that
could get me arrested? - Yes!

694
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,850
Mr. Verma maybe you don't know,

695
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:13,050
but I don't spare anyone
who antagonizes me. Got it?

696
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,980
Kala Dilip! Come!

697
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,640
What is it?

698
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,280
Kala Dilip, leave him alone!
This is our personal matter!

699
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,060
Mr. Verma I am very sorry.

700
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,990
Why fight over a trivial matter?

701
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,140
You can take as much as
you want. Please come.

702
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,870
What happened?
- What happened?

703
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,140
Did somebody stab you? What happened?
- Nothing.

704
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,270
Nothing!

705
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,540
I had a bad dream and
I started screaming.

706
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,050
I am sorry!

707
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,690
Sorry won't do.

708
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,410
You dream in the day,
and you scream too!

709
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,710
There are passengers in
the bus with a weak heart!

710
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,890
What if somebody had a heart attack?
- Yes!

711
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:07,970
Sit!

712
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,030
Mr. Kishore.
- Yes.

713
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,290
This girl's scream has
unnerved all the passengers.

714
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,640
You are such a good singer.
Please sing a song.

715
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,390
Yes!
- Yes!

716
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,230
That song

717
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,990
"You are so beautiful."

718
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,580
That will come later. Now sit.

719
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,460
I want to hear that song!

720
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,760
"With the saunter of breeze."

721
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,610
Listen to it in Kolkata.

722
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,950
Sing that song!

723
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,210
"Who is your kin here, traveller?"

724
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,020
Bald man, sit in your place!

725
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,460
Aradhana!
- No, the other one.

726
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,650
All of you calm down.
I will sing a new song for you all.

727
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,780
You have never heard it.

728
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,040
Yes!

729
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,550
But on one condition!
- Yes!

730
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,890
What? - You have to sing
along with me. Agreed?

731
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,480
Yes!

732
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,400
Mr. Guitar.
- Yes.

733
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,830
What's your name?
- Robert D'costa.

734
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,720
Robert D'costa, please help me.
- Sure! Why not?

735
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,530
Ready! 1, 2, 3, 4!

736
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,760
"Fragrant cold breeze, tell me."

737
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,800
"Do you know where my beloved lives?"

738
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,370
"The breeze smiled and said."

739
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,970
"Note down her address."

740
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,200
"If you want to meet your
beloved then go to Goa from Bombay."

741
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,270
"Bombay-Goa!"

742
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,120
"Bombay-Goa!"

743
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,420
"This is the journey of love."

744
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,680
"Fragrant cold breeze, tell me."

745
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,590
"Do you know where my beloved lives?"

746
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,580
"The breeze smiled and said."

747
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,720
"Note down her address."

748
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,950
"If you want to meet your
beloved then go to Goa from Bombay."

749
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,700
"Bombay-Goa! Bombay-Goa!"

750
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,910
"Bombay-Goa!"

751
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,220
"This is the journey of love."

752
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,760
Bus!
- Bus!

753
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,390
Stop!
- Bus!

754
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,690
Stop!

755
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,660
We have to catch the bus!

756
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,800
Do you think this
is a bus stop that

757
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:05,040
you can just stop the bus like this?
- Oh god!

758
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,290
Sir!

759
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:09,640
Look, this is not a temple!
It's a bus! Come on!

760
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,990
What are you doing? Come on!

761
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,880
Conductor! I heard a sound!
Did you throw out our luggage?

762
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,610
No! I climbed up and kept it there!

763
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,740
So what was that sound?

764
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,080
I fell down. That's why.

765
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,920
Come inside.
- Ok!

766
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,880
Drive!

767
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,030
You sit here!
- Okay!

768
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,590
Sit here!

769
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,520
Fatso, why are you
barging into the seat?

770
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,900
Father said to.

771
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,450
Father said to!

772
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,390
Mister, would you teach your
son to do this in the train?

773
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,570
A bus conductor is much
smarter than the train TC!

774
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,370
Come on! Sit here!

775
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,840
Mister, you let your
son come here half naked?

776
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,810
You should have made
him wear a shirt!

777
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,200
Why a shirt? His father is wearing one.

778
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,120
Thank goddess you didn't wear
a loin cloth for him.

779
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,270
Mister, why are you showing your teeth?

780
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,490
Where do you want to go?
- Goa!

781
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,660
Goa!
- Yes!

782
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,010
Do you drink liquor too?
- What are you saying?

783
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,520
We are going for our relative's wedding.

784
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,650
Then give me Rs. 69 for 3 tickets.

785
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh my! Why three tickets?
We are two!

786
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,640
What about this fatso?
- He too needs a ticket?

787
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,820
His father wears a shirt for him!
Will he get a free ride?

788
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,930
He is still a small child.
- He may be small for you.

789
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,940
For me he is a fatso!
Give me the money or I'll stop the bus.

790
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,700
Uncle Conductor!
- Yes, dear!

791
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:46,060
Mother has the money, not father.

792
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,280
Shut up! You tell everybody the secret!

793
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,500
I will give you a tight slap!
- Mother!

794
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,350
No, son! Why do you beat
the child? Put it back!

795
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,290
Mother, give me the
money for the ticket!

796
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,130
I am giving it! Money!

797
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,810
Nobody asked me for a ticket.

798
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,570
He said to buy
the child's ticket first.

799
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,960
Why are you arguing?

800
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,110
Our son has now grown up.
Give him the money.

801
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,610
You keep quiet!

802
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,850
Take 3.
- Take this! Here!

803
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:31,230
Take this!

804
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:33,360
Come on! Now honk!

805
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,540
Now overtake this bus!

806
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,760
Who is honking so much?

807
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:04,260
Rajesh, that car driver
is continuously honking!

808
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,190
Maybe he has to attend
his mother's wedding!

809
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,610
Let him overtake!

810
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:14,100
Fine! My name is Johnny!

811
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,000
How are you? Any problem
with the bus? Look out.

812
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,110
Overtake!
- Yes!

813
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,670
Hello! Hi!

814
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,190
Hail Kashi!
- Hail Kali!

815
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,870
Have you both understood?
- Yes.

816
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,630
So
- The bus is here!

817
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,720
Come on!

818
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,260
Kashibai!
- Wait!

819
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,450
Look! Tell uncle to make
rounds of the house!

820
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,590
By the time you finish explaining,
we'll be in Goa.

821
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,270
Okay!
- Have you both understood?

822
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,980
Khanna, hurry up!

823
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,700
Come on, mother! Get up!

824
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,340
Hail Mahakali!

825
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,840
Take care of her!

826
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,480
Take care of my mother.

827
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,450
Mother!
- You are the only saviour!

828
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:23,720
Kashibai! Where do you want to go?

829
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,600
Where I always go.

830
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,530
So you're to Goa to your
daughter's in-law's place?

831
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,130
What else? All my in-laws are dead!

832
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,560
Now only my daughter's in-laws are left!

833
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,840
But Kashibai I heard
that there was a tiff

834
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,890
between your daughter
and your son-in-law!

835
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,320
Last year he even sent
her to her maternal house.

836
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,700
Now he's called her back?

837
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:52,100
He had to! Once I too went to
my daughter's in-laws' place!

838
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,450
And I showed them Mahakali's form.

839
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,880
Then?

840
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,680
My son-in-law fell at
my feet immediately.

841
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,320
He apologised and took my daughter home.

842
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,060
Kashibai, this ha ha
ha of yours is fine.

843
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,480
Give me money for your ticket.

844
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:11,910
Fine.

845
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,720
123

846
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

847
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,570
The fat hen is here.
Where is the noise coming from?

848
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,750
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

849
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,820
Who brought a hen into the bus?

850
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,090
Hen? Oh god!

851
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,640
Hen? Alive or cooked?

852
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,990
Not cooked! She is hidden!

853
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,200
So mister you brought the hen!

854
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:18,090
I don't have a hen!
I have an egg!

855
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,680
Why are you laughing?

856
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:22,610
My face has been like
that since childhood!

857
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,960
Is that so?
Were you born laughing?

858
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,920
Did your mother laugh or your father?

859
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:31,570
It was a moonlit night!
Showers of water all around!

860
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,010
When I was born my mother was crying.

861
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,680
And my father Was laughing!

862
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,330
Mother, stop!

863
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,300
Mister, after Sorabh Modi I think

864
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,860
you are the second
Parsi man who acts well.

865
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,700
Thank you!
- Sit!

866
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,950
Sit!

867
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,810
Now tell me who is hiding the hen?

868
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,450
Rajesh! Stop the bus!

869
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,670
Oh god! It's gone!

870
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,900
Wow, Rajesh! What a way
you stepped on the brakes!

871
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,700
I got a betel leaf for free!

872
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:10,760
Now I want to ask you all something.

873
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,060
Where is that sound
of a hen coming from?

874
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,690
Hen!
- Yes, hen!

875
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,950
Hen!

876
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,250
You're not allowed to bring a hen into a bus.
Where is that sound from?

877
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,010
What is in this?
- Books.

878
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,480
Hens are not allowed in the bus!

879
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,490
Rajesh! The bus won't go
ahead until the hen is found!

880
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,240
Mr. Kader! The basket!

881
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:41,020
Conductor! Her basket is moving!

882
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,070
The basket is moving!

883
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:49,520
Kashibai! Are you
hiding a hen in this basket?

884
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:55,050
Not a hen! It's a chick!
- Is that so? Let me see the chick!

885
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:05,220
Is this a chick? Bald!

886
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,040
Kashibai, if this is a chick,
would the hen be your size?

887
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,580
Hens are not allowed in the bus!

888
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,230
What have you done? Cruel man!

889
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,530
Bring my hen back!

890
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,170
Go!

891
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,260
Hens are not allowed in the bus!

892
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,810
And you are telling
the conductor to bring it back!

893
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,280
Rajesh, start the bus!

894
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,330
No!

895
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,850
Will you bring the hen or not?

896
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:38,170
If you won't,
I will slay everybody!

897
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,730
Mother Kali! Don't curse us children!

898
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,480
I have been travelling on this
route for the past 10 years.

899
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,700
But I have never
seen that form of yours!

900
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,250
Yes, mother.
- Mother, forgive us!

901
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,600
Now you understood!
- Yes!

902
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,150
Rajesh!
- Khanna!

903
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,900
Come on! Let's search for mother's hen!

904
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,500
Pick up the basket and apologise!

905
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,840
Apologise later!
First get the hen!

906
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,100
Yes! Let's search for that hen!

907
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,530
I won't let that hen go!

908
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,160
Are you beckoning a hen or a girl?

909
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,500
Call the hen like this!

910
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,550
Come!

911
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:05,580
Catch it!

912
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,510
Wait! I will get the hen!

913
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,070
Come!

914
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,580
It went away.

915
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,840
Rajesh!
- Khanna!

916
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,900
I got hold of the head!
Sit in the bus quick!

917
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,450
Come on!

918
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,450
Start the bus!

919
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,730
Driver!
- Here is your hen!

920
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:27,850
Why are you all quiet?

921
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,080
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

922
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,180
You all look as
if you have seen a snake!

923
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:38,440
With great difficulty
I got hold of this hen!

924
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,300
What is it?

925
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:23,570
Oh god!

926
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,840
What strange people!

927
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:40,100
They are afraid of a snake!
A snake is so harmless!

928
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,910
It glides, it hisses.
Hold it and put it in your pocket.

929
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,100
Do you know that in many
countries people even eat snakes!

930
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,320
Do you know how many vitamins it has?

931
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,740
Why are you all screaming?
You are Indians!

932
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,670
Indians are not afraid of hardships!

933
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,860
You are scared of a mere snake!

934
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:10,960
Cowards!
Remember, you are all Arjun's descendents!

935
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:12,930
You all are Bhim's descendents!

936
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,190
And

937
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,920
Khana!
- Run!

938
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:40,890
Khanna!

939
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:00,610
Bhim's descendent!
Now where is your courage?

940
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,580
Have a vitamin pill and nab it!

941
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:03,750
Nab it!

942
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,980
Why are you people so scared?

943
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:12,410
This is the King of snakes!
It won't harm anybody!

944
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,550
Come, King of snakes!

945
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:23,720
Give the driver a kiss!
- No!

946
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,570
Give the conductor a kiss!
- Go!

947
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,540
King of snakes!

948
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,820
It went away!

949
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,240
Thank god!

950
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,640
What happened!
- Nothing!

951
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:46,530
My cap is at your feet.
Let me put it on my head.

952
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,210
Are you human or an animal?
You always scare us!

953
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,390
Shut up, old man!

954
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,850
You are a coward.
Always screaming!

955
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,030
Now I am relieved!
- No!

956
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,130
Where is my hen?

957
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,140
Mother, instead of a hen worth 5 rupees,

958
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,900
I got you a snake worth 500 rupees.

959
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,570
And yet you are wailing for your hen!

960
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:08,550
Sinner! I curse you!
- I don't drink liquor!

961
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,770
Curse!

962
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,330
In your next lifetime you will be a hen!

963
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:15,170
And I will kill and eat you!

964
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,030
Take this and remember what I told you!

965
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,800
There are just 2 bullets In it.
The work must be done! Got it?

966
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,010
I will follow the bus.
- Okay, boss.

967
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:40,450
Listen, take care of it as
soon as possible. - Boss!

968
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,880
The bus is here!
- The bus is here!

969
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,630
The bus is here!

970
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:43,720
Okay, boss. I will leave.

971
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,390
What are you all
looking at? Sit in the car.

972
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,660
Come on! Driver!

973
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,180
God knows what has
happened to children nowadays!

974
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:23,360
This is what they do
if you rebuke them even a bit.

975
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:28,850
What do they know
what parents go through?

976
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,670
Today the guy's family
is coming to see Mala.

977
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,090
How will we face them?

978
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,730
Is Mr. Aatmaram at home?

979
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,330
Come, Ramlal!

980
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,340
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

981
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,930
Your son has not come?

982
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,830
What a strange man you are!
First tell us to sit!

983
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,840
Serve us tea and water,
and then ask where my son is!

984
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:57,310
Do you think your son's in
law's house is some hotel,

985
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,530
for you to order for tea
as soon as you arrive?

986
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,010
Sister, will I see my
daughter-in-law today?

987
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,440
Yes. But

988
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,490
Sister-in-law, it so happened that

989
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,170
her friend has just returned
from London after 4 years.

990
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,980
and she took her to
her house for 2 days.

991
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,370
That's what happened in our house too.

992
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,470
His friend has returned
from America after 4 years.

993
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,810
And he took him to Nasik for two days.

994
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,690
What a strange coincidence!

995
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:28,500
I brought his snap,
if you want to see it. - Yes.

996
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:29,680
Do you want to see it?

997
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:42,150
Your son is very handsome!
- Like father like son!

998
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,120
Get lost! You think
you are very handsome!

999
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,050
They'll make a nice couple.

1000
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,450
Mind your leg!

1001
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,930
Madam, my legs handle me.
How can I handle them?

1002
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,690
Sir, ticket to where?
- Here!

1003
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,080
I am not a barber.
I am a conductor!

1004
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,960
Ticket to where?

1005
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,680
The last stop!

1006
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,570
So you too are heading
for the last stop. - Yes!

1007
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:02,180
I want to know what the destination
of this unknown journey is.

1008
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,860
Poet, recite poems later.

1009
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,380
What? - No, forgive me!
I meant give me 18 rupees 75 paisa.

1010
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,780
Here.

1011
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,730
Here.

1012
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,490
Sir, here is your 1.25 rupees

1013
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,620
Keep the change.

1014
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,460
Am I a waiter in a hotel?

1015
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,060
Mister, at the next stop you can have a plate
of rice for 1.25 rupees.

1016
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,270
Priest, here comes your rival!

1017
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,770
He is not my rival!

1018
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,870
I consider every young girl my
daughter-in-law or daughter!

1019
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:43,960
Daughter-in-law or daughter!

1020
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,890
That's just sour grapes!

1021
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:50,700
Mr. Kader, forget the grapes!
I don't understand one thing. - What?

1022
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,830
As soon as the boy entered the bus,

1023
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,050
he saw the girl and he whistled.

1024
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,440
The girl got scared.
He went and sat near the girl.

1025
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,300
The girl is in trouble.
The guy stared at the girl.

1026
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,560
They spoke with their eyes.

1027
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,190
God knows what's going on.

1028
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:09,580
What can be going on? It's
their youth that's to blame!

1029
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:44,870
"I didn't see. I didn't think."

1030
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,140
"I put my life at the target."

1031
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:55,380
"My desire is to die at your feet."

1032
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,250
"Swaying! Swaying!"

1033
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:44,320
"I will lay down my life.
I will die."

1034
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:48,130
"I will do some great deed."

1035
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,770
"If I don't find
solace even after my death."

1036
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,820
"Then where will I go, friend?"

1037
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,600
"Who is the murderer?
I can't say that."

1038
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,280
"But I can't even keep quiet."

1039
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:00,050
"Who is the bird?
Who is the hunter?"

1040
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:04,110
"Say something."

1041
01:20:53,390 --> 01:21:00,590
"I left my house vowing
not to leave her alone."

1042
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:07,410
"Spurning my life,
my crazy beloved has come here."

1043
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,120
"I didn't see. I didn't think."

1044
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,260
"I put my life at the target."

1045
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:44,210
"My desire is to die at your feet."

1046
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:48,860
Did you like the song?

1047
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:53,040
Conductor, why are you asking her?

1048
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,220
Ask me! This is how I liked the song!

1049
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:57,270
You dropped me down!

1050
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,750
Driver, stop the bus!
The conductor fell down!

1051
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,100
Don't worry. It's
happened many times before.

1052
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:05,600
He will come on his own.

1053
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,750
Stop!

1054
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,430
Catch it!

1055
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:20,760
Mother!
- Mother!

1056
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,760
No! Sister!

1057
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,070
Henceforth whatever I want to ask,
I will ask you and not your daughter!

1058
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,370
Fine! Sit!

1059
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,220
When I sit, you make me stand!

1060
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,360
And when I stand, you make me sit!

1061
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,640
Conductor! Come here!

1062
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,070
I am the conductor!
Treat me with respect!

1063
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,670
What happened?
- I bought a ticket for Belgaum.

1064
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,380
Now I want a ticket to Goa.

1065
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:51,650
What's the matter?
Why have you changed your mind?

1066
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,170
The journey is becoming interesting!

1067
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,010
You tell me your fare and
give me a ticket to Goa!

1068
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:00,190
Yes, I will give you a ticket.
I won't pick-pocket!

1069
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,370
Give me 12 rupees!

1070
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,600
Father!

1071
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:27,870
Suck your thumb!

1072
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,080
Father!

1073
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:33,390
Get lost!

1074
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,660
Father! Fried snacks!

1075
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,810
Fried snacks! Get lost!
- Father!

1076
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:48,300
Fried snacks!
- Shut up!

1077
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,890
Fried snacks!

1078
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,370
Why are you beating him?

1079
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:56,920
He is hungry! No, son!

1080
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:58,470
I will get you fried snacks!

1081
01:23:58,930 --> 01:23:59,980
Fried snacks!

1082
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,910
Calm down!
- Fried snacks!

1083
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,220
Fried snacks!

1084
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:23,420
Mister, hold his hand!
- Son, stop it!

1085
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,810
What are you doing?
You are gagging my son!

1086
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:29,200
This is the only way to stop him!

1087
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,620
No! I won't let you!

1088
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:31,840
Shut up!
- You shut up!

1089
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,810
Such a big child
wailing for fried snacks!

1090
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:37,400
It disgraces my position! Sit!

1091
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:38,410
You gag him!

1092
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,810
Don't beat the child!

1093
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,790
He is my son! Not yours!

1094
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,050
Don't touch me!

1095
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,440
I tell you, don't touch me!

1096
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,450
Here is the money.
- Yes.

1097
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,010
Here is the ticket.
- Sir, are you from the army?

1098
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:38,570
Old man, what a strange question!

1099
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:42,130
In that uniform,
does he look like he works in a laundry?

1100
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,100
Stop this nonsense
and do your work!

1101
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,650
You keep quiet!
Your mouth is stinking!

1102
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:54,060
Sir where are you posted?
- Pathankot.

1103
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,410
Pathankot! That area near Kashmir?

1104
01:25:57,790 --> 01:26:01,430
Yes.
- Sir, I heard it snows heavily there.

1105
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:03,480
It's very chilly there.

1106
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,700
Have you been to Kashmir before?
- I am not so lucky.

1107
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,680
But I read that in
books when I was a child.

1108
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,700
You read it when you were a child!

1109
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,840
And in your old age
you are feeling cold!

1110
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:23,450
Sir is there any way to end war in the world?
- What are you saying?

1111
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:26,090
If there is no war then
why would there be guns?

1112
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,470
If there are no guns,
then why would there be bullets?

1113
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,280
And if bullets are not there,
then why this man and this gun?

1114
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:33,620
What is the need?

1115
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:39,480
You are a Pundit and so am I.
But we think differently.

1116
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:43,420
I asked him whether
there is any way to end wars.

1117
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:46,470
So why did you start
screaming like a fool? - Pundit!

1118
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,950
Did you call me a fool?

1119
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,540
You're a Brahmin and
you insulted a Brahmin!

1120
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,470
You have slandered not just me,
but the entire community!

1121
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,070
I won't spare you!

1122
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,700
He didn't say anything wrong.

1123
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:02,970
He just asked for a solution to stop
war. And you got angry needlessly.

1124
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:05,820
Being a Pundit,
you are talking like a fool.

1125
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:09,290
You called me a fool!
You are a fool!

1126
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:12,260
You are the biggest fool!
- What did you say?

1127
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,190
You are the biggest fool in India!

1128
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,420
Your father and grandpa are fools!
Your great grandpa,

1129
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:23,060
your ancestors were fools!
- What are you saying?

1130
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:31,180
Leave me. Stop the bus!

1131
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,640
Stop fighting!

1132
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:06,810
Move aside.

1133
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,180
Shut up!

1134
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,650
Rajesh!
- Khanna!

1135
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:23,010
This fight won't end until a third
party intervenes and settles it.

1136
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,610
What do we care? Let them fight!

1137
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,000
We will play cards!
- Have you brought the cards?

1138
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,850
Wow! But how will we play?
I don't have money!

1139
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:35,450
Why are you scared?
We have today's wages.

1140
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,330
Yes! This sweet lemon!
- Tomatoes!

1141
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,050
I have tomatoes!

1142
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:40,770
We will play cards.

1143
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,140
Thank you!

1144
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,530
Move away!

1145
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,860
I will get a jack!

1146
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:33,260
I beg you all!
- Police!

1147
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,620
Here.

1148
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,840
Khanna, why is everybody
silent in the bus?

1149
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,980
Look! The policeman is taking
the criminal inside the bus!

1150
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,880
Come on! Take this banana!

1151
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,560
This is your banana.
- Okay,

1152
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:53,780
I will keep it with me.
- Why fight with friends?

1153
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,700
Here is your bag!
- Give it.

1154
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,050
Thank you very much, constable!

1155
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:21,490
Conductor! Stop the bus at the camp.
I have to get down.

1156
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:24,420
Rajesh!
Stop the bus at the camp!

1157
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:34,220
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1158
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,810
Bye, conductor!
We will meet again!

1159
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,650
How?

1160
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,540
Because of you there was
such a quarrel inside!

1161
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:43,130
We met on earth.
Now let's not meet in heaven.

1162
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,350
Okay!
- Bye!

1163
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,230
Bye!

1164
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:50,630
Constable, give me money for the ticket.

1165
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,100
My wallet! It was with me
when I took the bus.

1166
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:57,160
You thug! You are not
afraid of prison too!

1167
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,680
Constable, compared to
the penalty for murder,

1168
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,900
penalty for robbery is nothing!

1169
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:09,760
Thief, how did you steal
the constable's wallet?

1170
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:16,790
After he got on the bus,
when he raised his hands

1171
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,850
to sniff the snuff
I stole his wallet.

1172
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:22,450
Oh my god! This penchant
for snuff is very bad!

1173
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:26,380
In my 20 years of service,
this is the first time I have been fooled.

1174
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:28,270
From today I will give up this habit.

1175
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:35,760
Wow, constable! I've always heard
and seen police reform the criminal.

1176
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,940
But today for the first time I see

1177
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:42,790
a criminal reforming a policeman.

1178
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:45,350
You are right.
I will throw it away.

1179
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,360
What are you doing?
- I will throw it away.

1180
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,410
What are you doing?
- Let go! I will throw it!

1181
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:51,290
What are you doing?
- I will throw it away.

1182
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,690
Take the constable to the police station carefully!
- What did you say?

1183
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:25,660
I mean, you take him carefully.
Right!

1184
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:39,690
Madam!

1185
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,040
Thank you!
- Anytime, baby!

1186
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:47,050
You should always be careful in life,

1187
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:49,150
got it?

1188
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,380
Mr. Kader, do you see that?

1189
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,590
Now they have even started
whispering to each other.

1190
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,900
Pundit, I can see all of it!

1191
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:01,450
But we entered the bus
before this tall fellow. - Yes!

1192
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,880
We have the first right!
- Right.

1193
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,860
What is this?

1194
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,370
He is extending his leg as
if he owns the whole bus.

1195
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,470
Get up!
- Can't you see that boss is sleeping?

1196
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:17,660
If you disturb him, he will not spare you!
- This is the limit!

1197
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,510
Every passenger has paid the fare!
- Shut up!

1198
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,980
Where is the conductor?

1199
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:28,420
It is his duty to see to
the passenger's comfort! - What will he do?

1200
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:33,400
Didn't you see?
When the wrestler glared at him, he ran away!

1201
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,580
He's of no use anyway.

1202
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,550
Conductor! Why are you hiding your face?

1203
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:44,160
They are praising you!
- I can't hear properly!

1204
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:49,810
They are saying that
you a man in name only!

1205
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,110
Don't challenge me!

1206
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,960
So far you have seen men
only in the wrestling ground!

1207
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,390
But this is the first time that you
are seeing a man in a bus! - Show him!

1208
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,520
Show him!
- Fine!

1209
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,150
Shall I?
- Yes!

1210
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:02,620
Shall I?
- Yes!

1211
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,800
Okay!
- Show him! Let us see too!

1212
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,930
Boss!
- Quiet!

1213
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:19,990
Shut up! You!
- Let him sleep!

1214
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,920
Get up. Shut up!
- Let him sleep, conductor!

1215
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,440
I told you boss has a
fight in Goa, so he's sleeping.

1216
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:31,500
Fool! This is not a jumbo jet!

1217
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,480
You can't occupy three seats as
if it's your father's reign. This is a bus!

1218
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:36,780
Get up!

1219
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:38,910
Oh no!

1220
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,720
Who touched me?
- Boss, the conductor.

1221
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:44,780
Boss!

1222
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:48,420
The ant wants to
fight with the elephant?

1223
01:34:55,530 --> 01:35:01,810
Grumpy man, I may be an ant
And you might be an elephant.

1224
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:05,500
But this bus doesn't belong to your father!
- What did you say?

1225
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:09,310
Get up!
- Boss! Boxer! Calm down!

1226
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:10,810
Sister, let go of me!

1227
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:14,250
You are holding my hand!
Let go of me!

1228
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,800
Sister, let go of me!

1229
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:20,950
Boxer, you're lucky that you hit me in the bus,
that's why you're spared.

1230
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:23,790
If you hit me outside then..
Then what would I have done?

1231
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,930
You leave!
- Why?

1232
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:28,570
You are acting very smug!
- Yes!

1233
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:31,080
I will break your bones!
- Yes!

1234
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,840
What would you have done outside?
- No!

1235
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:34,890
Driver!
- Driver!

1236
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:35,810
Stop the bus!

1237
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,860
Rajesh! Stop the bus!
- Yes!

1238
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:38,860
Okay!

1239
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:46,230
Careful.

1240
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:53,430
Come on brothers.

1241
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:57,830
Don't leave him!

1242
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:05,780
Come on brothers!
- Beat him!

1243
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:09,260
Take off your clothes!
- Okay!

1244
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,060
Strip.

1245
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,190
You called me old man!
- Why would I be scared of him?

1246
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:16,120
Good! Take off your clothes!
- Stop!

1247
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:20,100
I can't take off my clothes! Boxer!
We will fight in Goa!

1248
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:22,650
What did you say?
Take off his clothes!

1249
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,790
Take off your clothes!
- Yes.

1250
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:28,050
Take off his clothes!

1251
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,220
Come on! Ask this ant how he is!
- Ant!

1252
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:40,910
Rajesh!
- Khanna!

1253
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,960
Hold this!

1254
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,600
Now I will teach him a lesson!

1255
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,670
Come on! Now.

1256
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:53,680
Come on!

1257
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:02,510
Why are you showing your chest?
Look at this stomach!

1258
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:08,710
Go!

1259
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,320
Just go! God bless you!

1260
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,610
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1261
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,290
Now this boxer and
the conductor are going to fight!

1262
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,970
I am ready to bet on him!

1263
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,310
Look at this boxer's muscles!
1.25 rupees!

1264
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,780
1.25 rupees for 1 rupee!

1265
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,540
And his is 15 rupees for 1 rupee!

1266
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:27,880
This is your chance to earn money!

1267
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,270
Come on, place your bets!
Where is the money?

1268
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:34,830
I bet 20 rupees!
- On whom? The conductor?

1269
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:38,470
Am I mad to bet on the conductor?
- Then?

1270
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,850
I'm betting on the boxer!

1271
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:40,860
Boxer!
- Yes!

1272
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,540
Go!
- 20 rupees!

1273
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,100
Go! - Anybody else?
This is your chance to make some money!

1274
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,980
Look at his muscles and place your bet!

1275
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,280
Come here.
- 1 rupee on the boxer!

1276
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,830
1 rupee on the boxer! What's your name?
- Hanuman!

1277
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,660
Go!

1278
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,310
Very good! Don't be scared!

1279
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:59,110
Get ready, boss!

1280
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:01,620
Very good, conductor Don't be scared!

1281
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,820
Silence! Ladies and Gentlemen!

1282
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:13,260
On my right from
the Parsi corner, Mr. Boxer!

1283
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:19,620
On my left from
the Madrasi corner, Mr. Conductor!

1284
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,320
Careful! Boss!

1285
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,090
Boss!

1286
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,930
Boss!
- 12

1287
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:36,450
345

1288
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,430
67

1289
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:43,950
8910!

1290
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:48,180
Ladies and Gentlemen!
The winner!

1291
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,900
Oh my god! You are superman!

1292
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:53,450
You are so strong!

1293
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:57,720
Don't touch me!
- Why? What are you saying?

1294
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,400
Don't touch me!
- Okay!

1295
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:02,750
Leave!
- Okay! I am going!

1296
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,140
Very good! My mighty man!
You won without a fight!

1297
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,950
Today I won the jackpot!

1298
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,380
How much have you made?
- More than 500, see for yourself.

1299
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:19,700
You! Robbing my passengers
by making me the scapegoat!

1300
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:21,460
No, no!
- Get lost!

1301
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:25,810
Rajesh! Return everybody's money!

1302
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:31,130
When god is kind,
even a donkey can be a wrestler.

1303
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:32,180
You!
- Come on, everybody!

1304
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,820
Even new guys can win.

1305
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:40,380
Listen!
- Yes!

1306
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,240
Is he dead?
- No, but he has lost!

1307
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,250
Don't cry!

1308
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:55,460
Look, every dog has its day.
- Today was your day!

1309
01:39:56,330 --> 01:40:00,650
Look I apologise to you and to him too.

1310
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:05,250
Now get some water to sprinkle on his face,
so he regains consciousness.

1311
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:08,350
From where do I get it?
This is enough!

1312
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,970
Get up, boss!
- Get up, boss!

1313
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,620
He's won and yet
he is apologising to you, boss.

1314
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,710
Get up! You have tarnished our image!

1315
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:37,410
Where is Mala?
- Boss, there is a problem.

1316
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,290
That scoundrel messed up my plans!
- Who?

1317
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,220
A tall man with whom
I got into a fight.

1318
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:45,990
Ravi! So he landed up here too!

1319
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,000
Yes, boss. He snatched
the pistol from my hand.

1320
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,510
But boss, I came up with a ploy to
make the bus break down on the way!

1321
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,900
Sit in the car, idiot!

1322
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,460
Let's go.

1323
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,110
Hey!

1324
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:33,800
Rajesh! Why did you stop the bus again?

1325
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,190
I didn't.
The bus stopped on its own.

1326
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:40,120
Get down and check it.
- Okay.

1327
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:51,670
Rajesh!
- Khanna!

1328
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:59,080
Don't fight!

1329
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:01,590
Who is Rajesh?
And who is Khanna?

1330
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,110
I don't know!
I just know Rajesh Khanna!

1331
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:06,030
Khanna, where are you?

1332
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:09,800
What are you doing below? Come out!

1333
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,440
What is this?
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

1334
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:16,370
No! The bus is leaking!

1335
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,540
Look!

1336
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,480
The screw of the oil tank is loose.
All the oil has leaked out.

1337
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:24,830
Oh my god! Now what?

1338
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,020
Get a bottle of oil!

1339
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:30,690
Why are you joking?

1340
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,750
You want me to walk 2 miles

1341
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:37,930
in this scorching heat and get the oil?
I can't do it!

1342
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,450
Khanna!
- Yes.

1343
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,460
You can't walk, can you?
- No!

1344
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:49,740
Then I'll get a car for you?
- Yes.

1345
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:54,720
Why? Nowadays you flatter me a lot.

1346
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:57,520
If I lose my temper,
I will thrash you.

1347
01:42:57,650 --> 01:43:01,460
Get lost! I will punch you!
- You!

1348
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,340
Hey!

1349
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,560
Why are you two fighting?

1350
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,030
Why are you two fighting? Stop it!

1351
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,740
Start the bus!

1352
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,670
You! Get inside!

1353
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:13,520
Conductor! Start the bus!

1354
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,860
Or I will file a complaint against you!

1355
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,160
Are you talking or spitting?

1356
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,750
Sister!
- Move!

1357
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,510
Sister! Do you want a handkerchief?

1358
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,600
Handkerchief!

1359
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:35,960
"Rajesh, go to sleep!"

1360
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:44,500
Rajesh! First repair the oil engine.

1361
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,500
Okay.

1362
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,180
Yes.

1363
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:57,850
Look, Mala!
- Yes.

1364
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:59,820
It will take the conductor
time to get the diesel.

1365
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:02,450
Why don't we go out for some fresh air?
- Okay.

1366
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:18,030
Come on! Hurry up!

1367
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:20,410
Come on! Yes, quick!

1368
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:27,030
Where is my wife?

1369
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,910
I am here! Come on!

1370
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:30,500
Come on!

1371
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:04,290
My cycle!

1372
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,740
What are you thinking?

1373
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:20,200
About the wrong decision
I made in life.

1374
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:24,840
Meaning more ambition
than courage.

1375
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:28,610
You left your house to
become a movie star.

1376
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,200
How do you know?

1377
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:33,380
I know everything that
goes on in the world.

1378
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:37,230
I even know who you are,
whose daughter you are

1379
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:39,750
and who you're going to marry.

1380
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,840
Did you like the guy?

1381
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:45,770
I didn't even see him.

1382
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:47,410
Then look at him now.

1383
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:48,620
Now?

1384
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:52,970
Yes. Your father
Mr. Aatmaram's friend

1385
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:59,090
Mr. Ramlal's son and
your fianc Mr. Ravi Kumar.

1386
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:05,200
You mean you
- Yes, It's me.

1387
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,800
Or would I have followed you like
your bodyguard like a mad man?

1388
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:12,400
But why did you hide
your identity from me?

1389
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,660
What could I do?

1390
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:17,760
You were blinded by
the glitter of showbiz.

1391
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:21,150
I thought you would get a kick from life,
and come to your senses.

1392
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,580
After all, jewellery is
made after melting the gold.

1393
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,420
Forget all that.

1394
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:32,910
Tell me, do you like your fiancé?

1395
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:39,360
Even if were not my fiancé,
I would have liked you. - Is that so?

1396
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:44,840
I think somebody is coming!
- Who else?

1397
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,730
Our bus companions!

1398
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:50,370
Listen!

1399
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,600
Come on!

1400
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:46,930
"My heart belongs to you.
And so do I, beloved."

1401
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:55,340
"I swear on you,
on your threshold."

1402
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:57,730
"I swear on your house,
oh beloved."

1403
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:02,710
"My love for you made me leave
the world behind, beloved."

1404
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:11,210
"I swear on your eyes,
on your tresses."

1405
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:13,390
"I swear on your cheeks, oh beloved."

1406
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:07,040
"Lovers want to create a new world."

1407
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,780
"We won't bother about anyone."

1408
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:18,010
"Nobody should lecture us."

1409
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:24,120
"We walk in a trance."

1410
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:28,940
"We won't step back."

1411
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:34,380
"My heart belongs to you.
And so do I, beloved."

1412
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:39,780
"My love for you made me leave
the world behind, beloved."

1413
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:45,680
What are you doing?
- What?

1414
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:48,030
Let go of my hand!
- Why?

1415
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,170
Please! Can't you understand?
- What?

1416
01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:55,980
People are watching!
- Let them!

1417
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:58,490
They will be envy us more.
- Is that so?

1418
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:02,930
So should I come closer?
- Yes!

1419
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,730
Here I come!

1420
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:09,550
"No matter how much
the world envies us."

1421
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:14,530
"Why should we fear the world?"

1422
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:06,940
"The ambience is so lovely."

1423
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:11,670
"The swaying breeze teases me."

1424
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:21,930
"Nobody else will
ever have such a union."

1425
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,420
"Lovers will unite."

1426
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:32,820
"No matter how much
the world tortures them."

1427
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:38,010
"My love for you made me
leave the world behind, beloved."

1428
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:46,380
"I swear on your eyes, on your tresses."

1429
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,720
"I swear on your cheeks, oh beloved."

1430
01:51:48,930 --> 01:51:53,710
"My heart belongs to you
and so do I, beloved."

1431
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,080
Goats!

1432
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:14,300
Are you blind? You're riding
your cycle over the goats!

1433
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:17,990
Where do I ride then?
Does this road belong to your father?

1434
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:19,240
Does it belong to yours?

1435
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,010
You weakling, you hit me!

1436
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,740
I will thrash you
black and blue! Scoundrel!

1437
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,960
You!

1438
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,640
Help!

1439
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,320
You hit me!

1440
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,570
Listen to me!

1441
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:49,260
Do you all mind pushing the bus
to the petrol pump? Then we can go there!

1442
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,930
Do you all agree?

1443
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:53,700
Otherwise go to hell!
- He went to sleep!

1444
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,660
Kumbhkaran!
- What is it?

1445
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:58,760
Forget the petrol pump, we can even
push it to your house. Right, brothers?

1446
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:00,600
Yes!

1447
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:02,400
Come on!
- Come on!

1448
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:03,870
Come inside.

1449
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:08,850
Wife, where are you?
- I am here!

1450
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:10,020
Wife.

1451
01:53:15,930 --> 01:53:18,310
Harder!

1452
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,330
Push harder!

1453
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:23,590
Push harder!

1454
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:25,850
Traveling by this bus
has got us into a mess.

1455
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,630
Rajesh!

1456
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:09,050
Rajesh!
- We're tired.

1457
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:12,110
Rajesh, I'm back!

1458
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,910
That is Khanna's voice!

1459
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:16,920
Yes! That's Khanna's voice!
- But where's it coming from?

1460
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,020
From here! Where else?

1461
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:22,280
Look up! I am here!

1462
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:24,080
And the oil tin is down!

1463
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,880
Look there.

1464
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:39,150
Why are you laughing?
- You look like a monkey!

1465
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:41,710
Rajesh!
- What?

1466
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:48,570
Rajesh, drivers shouldn't laugh
when conductors are in trouble!

1467
01:54:48,910 --> 01:54:50,330
Get me down!

1468
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:53,680
First tell me, are you hanging
from there on your own accord?

1469
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:56,400
Or did someone put you there?

1470
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,500
Rajesh, what do I tell you?

1471
01:54:58,790 --> 01:55:05,400
A child was taking his goats to graze.
I gave him a tight slap!

1472
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:08,710
And the villagers hanged me on the tree!

1473
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,440
Khanna, take an oath never
to raise your hand on anyone.

1474
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:14,570
Never!

1475
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:19,390
I swear on your mother, Rajesh!
I will never beat anybody!

1476
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:23,240
Won't I come to my senses
after hanging like this?

1477
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:26,340
Very good! Now you are
talking like a decent man!

1478
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:29,730
Come on!
- Go on.

1479
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,670
Have you repaired it?
- Yes, sir!

1480
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,630
What is this? Hurry up!

1481
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,520
We don't have much time!
If we lose the girl, we will all die! Got it?

1482
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:40,690
Come on! Hurry up!

1483
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:07,020
Where is my purse?
- Purse?

1484
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:09,370
Did I leave it outside?
- You didn't take it outside.

1485
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:11,800
Then I must have left it in the bus!
Why did you leave it in the bus?

1486
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,010
You know that

1487
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:18,370
Conductor! Somebody stole
this madam's purse! - What!

1488
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:19,920
Robbery in the bus!

1489
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,150
This has happened for the first
time in my 10 years of service!

1490
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,500
And madam, I told you before
to after your purse! Didn't I?

1491
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,470
Now we are in trouble!

1492
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:32,980
Pundit! Mr. Kader!

1493
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:41,860
If anybody found the purse,
or took it by mistake, please return it.

1494
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:44,790
You! Get up!

1495
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:47,090
Where is the purse?

1496
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:49,180
What rubbish!
Do you think I am a thief?

1497
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:53,540
Very good, so you know
how to get angry too!

1498
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:56,470
I thought you just knew to comb! Sit!

1499
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,520
Conductor!
- What happened?

1500
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,240
Mister, can't you be polite?

1501
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:03,120
Look how politely
I am talking to you!

1502
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:06,560
I want to ask you where
the passenger who was sitting here is.

1503
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:10,910
Mister never before did
you talk to me so politely.

1504
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:12,630
Otherwise I am a very simple..

1505
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,770
This man has vanished!

1506
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:20,870
He wanted to go to Belgaum first,
and then bought a ticket for Goa.

1507
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,720
And right from the beginning
he was eyeing madam's purse!

1508
01:57:24,010 --> 01:57:30,000
But don't worry!
He may be smart, but so am I.

1509
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:32,760
You're smarter!
- Yes, smarter!

1510
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:34,600
But what will I do now?

1511
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:37,120
I I Here's an idea.

1512
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,550
Rajesh! Take a U-Turn!
- What?

1513
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,270
Take the bus back towards Bombay.

1514
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,660
And I will turn the sign board!
- Why?

1515
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:50,350
Try to understand!
I am James Bond, too!

1516
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:53,990
Look, Bombay to Goa!
Goa to Bombay!

1517
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,210
Turn the bus!
- Now I understood!

1518
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:50,970
Move! I don't want
to travel in this bus!

1519
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:53,980
But we want you in this bus!
- But why?

1520
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:56,240
Come on!

1521
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:01,390
Give the purse! Get lost!

1522
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:04,320
Listen to me!
- Come on!

1523
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,540
Get down!
- Listen to me! - Get down!

1524
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:11,310
Rajesh!
Change the Bombay to Goa sign board!

1525
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:14,080
Climb up!
- Listen! Why are you beating me?

1526
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:15,330
You commit robbery!

1527
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,440
Conductor, listen! Please listen!

1528
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,850
"Bombay-Goa! Bombay-Goa!"

1529
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,860
"Bombay-Goa!"

1530
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,720
Look, whoever wants can
have their lunch here.

1531
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:31,110
I will take the thief to
the police station. Have your lunch.

1532
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:32,910
Come on!

1533
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:36,840
Now go to the police station!

1534
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:38,690
Come!

1535
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:40,860
Do you have lentil stew?
- We have everything!

1536
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:43,580
Have a seat!
- Meenakshi, we will get lentil stew here.

1537
02:00:43,710 --> 02:00:45,050
Agree.

1538
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,480
I am famished! I am taking a banana!
- Yes!

1539
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:51,870
Wow! You two look like Ram and Sita!

1540
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,260
I think you're newly weds.
- Married?

1541
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:58,070
Why are you shy? Go to the family room!

1542
02:00:58,150 --> 02:01:00,080
Okay, send 2 cups of tea!
- Okay!

1543
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,550
My sweetheart! My darling!

1544
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,700
Darling, let's go. Come on! Let's go!
- No.

1545
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,720
Its okay. You sit too, please.

1546
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:15,110
I am not shameless like you! Wife,

1547
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:16,820
Nosy parkers!

1548
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:17,930
Hail Bole Shankar!

1549
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,710
What will you have?

1550
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:26,790
Bring three plates of lunch!
- Three plates of lunch!

1551
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:31,600
Sir, why is the child gagged?
Did you take some oath?

1552
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:37,420
No. If you want to undo it, go ahead.
- No! I mean,

1553
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:42,150
what will people say about
the hotel if a customer is gagged?

1554
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,800
Nothing. They will only think
that the hotel is very dusty.

1555
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,520
Sir, you are joking!

1556
02:01:48,730 --> 02:01:53,210
No! You want to know the reason?
I will undo it.

1557
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,350
Now watch the fun!

1558
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:07,820
You!

1559
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:16,060
Leave me!

1560
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:21,670
Sir, hold him!

1561
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:25,900
Fried snacks!

1562
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,350
Why are you looking at my face?

1563
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:33,810
Give him fried
snacks and keep him quiet!

1564
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,320
What?
- Fried snacks!

1565
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:38,800
Fried snacks!
- Hurry up!

1566
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,230
Give him this!
- Here are fried snacks!

1567
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,360
Here are fried snacks!

1568
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:46,000
Now you know why we gagged him?

1569
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:49,810
Now I understood!
Not just his mouth!

1570
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,620
You should bind his eyes,
hands feet, everything!

1571
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:56,130
I think you've pampered him too much.

1572
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:58,520
What could we do? We
have only one child.

1573
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:03,330
One child like him is enough!
Oh my god!

1574
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,840
I think they've all gone to the canteen.

1575
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:16,480
Let's go ahead and wait.
- Come on!

1576
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:24,140
Here are your sweets!

1577
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,580
Oh my god!
- Sorry!

1578
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:13,220
Sit here!

1579
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,220
We'll come here again
- Yes!

1580
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:16,980
Don't worry.
- Okay!

1581
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:20,290
Clean the tables.

1582
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,720
Come here! Where is Rajesh?

1583
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:27,490
He is not here.
He must be eating in some private hotel.

1584
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:28,660
Meaning?

1585
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:35,110
Where besides food,
girls sing and dance.

1586
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,450
"Bindi will shimmer."

1587
02:04:37,790 --> 02:04:40,640
You guys take this car
and do exactly what I said.

1588
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:45,370
If this time you mess up,
I'll shoot you first. And

1589
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:47,330
Boss, don't worry.
Come on! Sit!

1590
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:01,780
Yes.

1591
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:10,820
Thank you, conductor!

1592
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,830
What is this?

1593
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,260
Is this your father's bus
that you stop it on the way?

1594
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,100
Don't be angry! Do me a favour!

1595
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:20,950
This poor man's mother is
about to die in a nearby village.

1596
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,470
What? His mother is dead?

1597
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,560
She is not dead! She is sick!

1598
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:27,690
Okay! Come!

1599
02:05:28,030 --> 02:05:30,710
Rajesh! Start the bus!

1600
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,720
Come on!

1601
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,870
Oh dear!
Is he a man or a hippopotamus?

1602
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:54,730
The bullet entered my stomach!
- Shut up!

1603
02:06:54,980 --> 02:06:56,190
He fired the bullet!

1604
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,810
Yes.

1605
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:07,330
Now this pistol is useless!
It had only two bullets.

1606
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,890
Rajesh! Stop the bus!

1607
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:15,530
Now this bus is not going to stop!
- The bus won't stop!

1608
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:16,500
Come on!

1609
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:21,690
Nobody move!

1610
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:27,380
If you try to stop,
I will shoot! Drive faster!

1611
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,700
Wow! Great!

1612
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:21,350
Thugs are abducting girls in the bus,

1613
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:23,650
and the men are just sitting idle!

1614
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:26,960
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
Wear bangles!

1615
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:31,690
Wear bangles!
- Nowadays men are not strong.

1616
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:34,280
They are eunuchs!

1617
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:37,130
Come on! We will save them!
- Yes! Come on!

1618
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:41,060
Wait! I am now inspired!

1619
02:08:41,730 --> 02:08:43,200
I am not a eunuch!

1620
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:45,790
Rajesh! Turn the bus back!

1621
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,930
There is no time for that!
I will take a reverse turn!

1622
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:49,690
Let them come.

1623
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:59,110
Come on!
- Come on!

1624
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,350
1, 2, 3!

1625
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:28,700
Leave me.

1626
02:10:53,650 --> 02:10:56,080
Wait! Come one by one!

1627
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:06,710
Hang on!

1628
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:09,100
Why are you taking off my shirt?

1629
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,820
I will get pneumonia!
I will get a cold!

1630
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:37,490
Scoundrel!

1631
02:11:37,570 --> 02:11:39,870
Go on. Fight.

1632
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:41,420
No, I'll not go.

1633
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:22,490
You thug!

1634
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:29,360
You beat my husband!

1635
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:53,680
You hold him!

1636
02:12:54,890 --> 02:12:56,020
Yes!

1637
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,820
It tickles!

1638
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:28,280
Oh my! Meenakshi!

1639
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:33,760
Save me!
- Mother!

1640
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:53,870
You beat me!
I won't spare you!

1641
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:57,430
I will teach you a lesson!

1642
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,900
Let me go!

1643
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:15,550
Look there!

1644
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:16,810
Come! Follow me!

1645
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:27,440
Come on!

1646
02:14:28,820 --> 02:14:29,790
Look there!

1647
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:34,310
You go this way!
You go that way!

1648
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:36,820
And you go this way!
- No, no! I will take this route!

1649
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:37,610
Go!

1650
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:53,310
Wow!

1651
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:57,960
Inspector! Come here!

1652
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:03,070
Look! My bus passengers have
done a police officer's job!

1653
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:08,890
I wish all young people would
help their country like this.

1654
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:12,160
Stop lecturing! We have to reach Goa!

1655
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:15,290
Fine! Inspector, nab them!

1656
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,600
Not me, nab them!

1657
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:29,740
Madam! You two can flirt later!
We have to reach Goa!

1658
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:31,790
Let's go!

1659
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:51,590
"Bombay-Goa! Bombay-Goa!"

1660
02:16:11,310 --> 02:16:13,700
"This is the journey of love."
