1
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,520
Between the 11th and 18th century,

2
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:34,116
witchery/witchcraft was practiced heavily in
Europe, Africa and Asia

3
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,131
It has been found that over 46 thousand witches...

4
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,131
..were killed during this period.

5
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,136
Every incident had a story.. One such incident had
occurred in.

6
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,534
..Northern India in a village named Kulbhata.

7
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,873
During 18th century, this village, surrounded by a
desert,

8
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,146
was tormented by a witch named Kaalo.

9
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,142
Kaalo wanted to sacrifice nubile girls to satisfy...

10
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,151
... her greed for immortality.

11
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,488
One day she was stoned to death and buried by
angry villagers...

12
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,688
...but her fear lived on in and around Kulbhata.

13
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,501
Years later some villagers spoke of Kaalo's sightings
yet again.

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:29,105
Kulbhata was vacated overnight by scared villagers.

15
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,522
All roads leading to Kulbhata were sealed by
horrifying tales...

16
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,526
.. of Kaalo killing anyone who dared to enter
Kulbhata.

17
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,864
It is said, Kaalo still roams in Kulbhata,..

18
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,127
.. in a more ferocious form than before.

19
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,134
And it is believed that since that incident,..

20
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,479
.. no one has gone to Kulbhata.

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,815
Until a bus carrying some passenge on its way to
Kuldevi...

22
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,817
.. had to pass through Kulbhata

23
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,455
Respected father,

24
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,458
I am coming back.

25
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,064
I id not reply to any of your letters until now

26
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,066
because I myself didn't have any answers.

27
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,068
But I do now.

28
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,471
I am bringing joys for the village with me.

29
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,468
I have a whole lot of explosives.

30
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,807
We will dig a well in our village.

31
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,812
No one will lack water now, father.

32
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,088
We will have everything.

33
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,491
Your son, Sameer.

34
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,700
People love to live when they are old and like to die
when young

35
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,770
You are riding many lives along with yours.

36
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,447
At least take care of theirs.

37
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,452
Taking care of others lives, my life has become
dreadful.

38
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,453
Now get in.

39
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:17,462
Show me your ticket. ... Go take your seat.

40
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,071
Excuse me, that's my seat.

41
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,401
My father told me not to take the window seat,

42
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,466
the sunlight will hurt my eyes. Look how hot it has
become.

43
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,081
Even the breeze comes in through the window.
Please.

44
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,097
Arrogant!

45
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,497
She's calling you arrogant.

46
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,696
Why are you making her sit in the sun? Try to
understand.

47
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,442
He's too much. He's turned a deaf ear.

48
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,775
Let it be, aunty, he's a kid.

49
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,779
Conductor, how much longer will you wait? Blow
your whistle.

50
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,054
Driver, move.

51
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,056
Oh God, protect us.

52
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:23,051
Whatever hurdles may come our way, may we never
stop.

53
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,058
Everybody listen to this important information.

54
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,071
You all are welcome on board.

55
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,474
No one remove your hands out of the window,

56
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,408
you may get hurt. I've warned you now.

57
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:43,414
And, it will take us 10 hours to reach Kuldevi,

58
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,484
if the bus is not stopped every now and then.

59
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,485
Information over.

60
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,084
I'd given this information to everyone already. This
was for you

61
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,823
Formality. Understand?

62
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:05,833
Do you know why I brought you to t Indian desert
for this photo shoot

63
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,098
Why? - Because I wanted to use the sand dunes,

64
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:15,843
the camels, the humps, the hounds, and the arcs.

65
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,117
Sit down, Hasmukh.

66
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,125
What is it?

67
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,855
You don't open your mouth, at least open your
hand.

68
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,142
Thank you.

69
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,543
What a pain he is!

70
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,149
Arrogant uncle.

71
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:17,098
What are you thinking? Missing your grandson?

72
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,842
I wish to fly and reach him,

73
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,118
and hug him.

74
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,123
It's just a matter of a few hours.

75
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,524
You can shower your love on him as much as you
want.

76
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,535
Ms.Aggressive, keep away those needles of yours.

77
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,866
They're hurting me.

78
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,734
Thank God. At least something hurts you.

79
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,549
What was I saying? - I'll hit you!

80
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,481
Okay! Take it as a joke. - No.

81
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,078
Let people talk. Just relax.

82
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,098
What is this?

83
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,103
If you have finished keeping your luggage, please
take your sea

84
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,836
A family will board the bus ahead.Those four seats
are booked by the

85
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,841
What are you doing? Can't you understand what I'm
saying?

86
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,513
I asked you to take the seat behind.

87
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,108
Hey! Are you trying to threaten us

88
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:38,453
No no.. I was only saying, will you set everything
here itsel

89
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,526
Leave something for the journey ahead.

90
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,868
Damn the driver! If he drives like this, we'll miss
Omi's weddin

91
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,132
Guddu, even Omi is getting married now.

92
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,874
Will my turn also come? Will I also get married?

93
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:03,410
You will surely get married, but the children will be
mine.

94
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,079
What will this nincompoop do in life?

95
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,113
Where did the travelers go?

96
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,673
They must have gone to attend nature's call.

97
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,084
Are they going to finish everything today?

98
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,084
Come on, Hasmukh.

99
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,099
What are you doing? - Making a line.

100
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,104
At least do this job well.

101
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,107
Guddu is the perfect wooer.

102
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:41,512
If that photographer acts smart, I'll kill him.

103
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,517
Amazing. -Very good.

104
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,845
Well, I'm a professional photographer.

105
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,521
Guddu, your...

106
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,121
babe. - Reminded me of her again?

107
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,070
Boss, how long will we wait for them? Let's go.

108
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,071
Wait. If I'd gone to attend to nature's call,

109
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,472
would you leave me behind? - Not at all. -Then wait.

110
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,121
Is this a ditch or a gorge?

111
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,521
Wonder how this gorge was formed over night.

112
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,788
What will we do now? - Just see.

113
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:07,464
When God shuts one door, he opens another.

114
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,465
Another door?

115
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,802
Don't worry, sir, there is another road.

116
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,475
Look, we will not take the other road.

117
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,081
We'll turn back. - Back? But why?

118
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,082
Because that road passes through Kulbhata.

119
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,082
Kulbhata!

120
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:34,823
It is said, whoever has taken the Kulbhata route,

121
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,096
has never returned alive.

122
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,098
Never.

123
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,100
Now come.Think of the good and bad in the bus.

124
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,102
Shall we go, boss? - Let's go.

125
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,439
The whole world worries about the hole.

126
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,099
Damn the hole!

127
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,510
Look, don't abuse the hole.

128
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:07,048
Hey Chhotu! Have you gone to sleep again like a log
on top of the bus

129
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,457
It's better if I put him to sleep for life.

130
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,792
Let it be. He's a kid.

131
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,464
Kid? He's a burden on earth.

132
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,799
Wake up, Chhotu. - Hey Chhotu! -Wake up!

133
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,072
Wake up!

134
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,045
Arrogant uncle, thank you.

135
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,060
It's okay.

136
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,061
Mr.Conductor, you must have come on this route
many times befo

137
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,465
Tell us some horror story.

138
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,477
Good idea. - I'll narrate a true incident.

139
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,482
Life is moving on

140
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,078
People are living in love and peac

141
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,830
Everyone here is unaware of death

142
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,437
No one knows when the journey may end'

143
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,451
But life is dear to everyone

144
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,788
Hey! Stop scaring everyone with your nonsense.

145
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:29,466
Uncle, don't be afraid, it's just a story.

146
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,467
Only a story.

147
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,075
What happened? - I feel something amiss.

148
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,084
I feel something terrible is going to happen.

149
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,677
I'll have to do something.

150
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,083
You're impossible. Look, there are no ghosts.

151
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,095
It's just a fear of the mind.

152
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,098
Wrong! Spirits exist.

153
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,112
What is this lemon chilly?

154
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,519
Hey old man, what is that?

155
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,523
Uncle, we played with those things in childhood.

156
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,527
Want to see the power of this string?

157
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,139
Until Goddess Kuldevi's blessings are here,

158
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,141
no trouble can enter this bus.

159
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,540
Amazing!

160
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,544
Nonsense!

161
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:53,550
It's fire proof! - See, we can make a costume out of
it.

162
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,883
And you can put me on fire. - Brilliant idea!

163
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,157
It will be a photo shoot on fire.

164
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:04,821
Nikhil, what this old man is saying... - Relax.

165
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,095
Chhotu, what happened?

166
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:20,112
Even I smoke, but it's forbidden in a bus, right

167
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,513
Thank you.

168
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,119
What happened? - Great! -What was that hero
saying?

169
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:01,813
What happened? -We have a flat tyre.

170
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:05,090
Get down all of you, we have a flat tyre.

171
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,082
Damn this bus!

172
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,754
They should not leave the bus.

173
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,495
They shouldn't.

174
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,498
They don't know what a big risk they are taking.

175
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:41,524
Chhotu, what's happened to you?

176
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,528
It's nothing,just a flat tyre.

177
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,532
Come, let's have a smoke. - Damn him.

178
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,532
Come on. Come! - He's such a sissy.

179
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,870
Why do you bring him along? I told you not to bring
him.

180
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,078
Why are you always after him? - Bury him alive.

181
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,080
Come on!

182
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,483
What? What are you up to?

183
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,491
That's the problem with me.

184
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:22,499
Whenever I see a girl dressed as a bride, even I wish
I had one.

185
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,102
Take, smoke.

186
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,104
Give.

187
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:33,111
This other girl in the shorts, I think her trousers
shrunk.

188
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:37,114
Or it must be today's fashion. I don't know.

189
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:15,078
1, 2, 3!

190
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,097
Come close. - No.

191
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,090
Shall I tell you something?

192
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,104
We're on our honeymoon.

193
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,083
Oh, God.

194
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:28,685
Shona, you are travelling alone.

195
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,493
Aren't you scared?

196
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,099
I've been coming to my grandma's house since
childhood.

197
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,493
Oh.

198
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,504
Even you are travelling alone. Don't you get scared?

199
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,113
I used to be scared earlier, not anymore.

200
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,847
You are with me, my grandma.

201
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,462
Brilliant. - Last one, huh. - Okay.

202
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:15,472
She's hot. Electrifying!

203
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,805
She may shock me.

204
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:25,072
There's none in this world who can shock you.

205
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,089
Want me to pick her for you?

206
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,489
Your sister-in-law?

207
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,497
No. - Hey, come on. - No. No. No.

208
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:49,506
Hey jerk! Look there, behind those shrubs.

209
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:54,511
Go! You won't get a better chance.

210
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:58,514
Go, Chhotu. - If you insist.

211
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,781
Go. - Let it happen.

212
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,455
I'm tired now after all his hard work.

213
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,459
But that was some photo session.

214
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,463
The best one for me. Well, that's how we do it in
Hollywood.

215
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:21,061
But, there is some eeriness about this place.

216
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,475
Manoj Night Shyamlan, you know. I can feel it.

217
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,478
I can feel it.

218
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,484
You!

219
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,818
You puny! -You prankster.

220
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:44,084
'Puny'. That's a good one.We'll use it somewhere.

221
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,096
Puny. Good. Yeah.

222
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,101
Can I take a picture of yours? - Don't take it.

223
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,102
Good. Let's go.

224
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:28,059
You fool!

225
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,079
What happened to him?

226
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,100
Help!

227
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,522
Chhotu!Where are you? Chhotu!

228
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,126
Chhotu!

229
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,528
Chhotu!

230
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,133
Damn! Chhotu!

231
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,127
Chhotu.

232
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,530
Chhotu.

233
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,088
Chhotu!

234
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:17,495
Chhotu, I know that's you over there.

235
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,497
Bloody jerk!

236
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,105
Don't play games with me.

237
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,110
It's going to be evening.

238
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,114
Come out soon!

239
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,118
Chhotu.

240
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,849
They are being very foolish.

241
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,523
Why don't they understand that they'll only find
death.

242
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,527
They don't know that this is the beginning of our
end.

243
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:59,865
I think we should leave. Even we may get sacrificed
because of them

244
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,069
True. - No.

245
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:05,074
We will all go together.We cannot leave anyone
behind.

246
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:44,707
Hey jerk! Come out!

247
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,118
Chhotu.

248
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,818
It's the effect of the joint.

249
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,095
Chhotu.

250
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,458
Why don't you understand? Know wha taking a
dead body with you means?

251
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,793
It means taking death along.

252
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,467
What do you mean, you rogue? I should leave my
friend here?

253
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,474
Chhotu is our responsibility.

254
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,475
Let's do one thing. We'll call an ambulance.

255
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,479
But my mobile is working here.There's no network.

256
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,812
Then to save us from legal hassles we'll have to
leave the body here.

257
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,078
What nonsense are you talking? This man was with
us.

258
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,490
We cannot leave his body behind in the jungle.

259
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:00,110
Sorry friend, I was only joking,

260
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,386
when I told you to die. But you really...

261
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,786
He's dead. Come.

262
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,058
You betrayer.

263
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:27,076
Guddu, why are you standing there? Please come.

264
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,079
Get in.What had to happen is over with.

265
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,484
Who can avoid what is destined?

266
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,487
Come, let's go.

267
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,821
Come on! Guddu.

268
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:46,093
I'm on a high.

269
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,101
Come inside.

270
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,109
Chhotu.

271
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,047
Chhotu.

272
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,051
Come.

273
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,507
I've been driving since so many years,..

274
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,475
.. but such a thing has never happened.

275
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:38,071
'Destiny'; while getting this printed on the bus, I
never knew,

276
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:41,519
that no one can get anything before time,..

277
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,478
.. and more than one is destined to.

278
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,492
Then even if it is someone's life.

279
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,090
Boss.

280
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,822
Where are you?

281
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,567
We have to go. We are getting late.Why are you
playing pranks?

282
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,829
We have to go. We are getting late.Why are you
playing pranks?

283
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,832
Boss. Boss.

284
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,454
Conductor, why don't you understan Get in the bus.

285
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,512
Conductor, why don't you understan Get in the bus.

286
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,521
Boss!

287
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,140
Boss!

288
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:34,787
Boss!.. Boss.

289
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,139
Boss. Boss.

290
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:53,133
Boss. Boss.

291
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,738
Damn the conductor! Let's go and check.

292
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:21,102
Damn the conductor! Let's go and check.

293
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,835
Stop them! -Why are you going out?

294
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,507
There's danger lurking outside. - Shut up!

295
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,100
Don't go out. - Let's go from here.

296
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,838
Cowards! - Come inside.

297
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,842
Come! Are you scared?

298
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,117
No, I'm not scared. But even they are sitting inside.

299
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,514
Wait, I'm coming.

300
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:40,524
You guys go. I'm going up to my Chhotu.

301
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:46,520
He's been lying there alone since so long.

302
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:51,702
You don't understand, you always insist on doing
what you want.

303
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,136
You don't understand, you always insist on doing
what you want.

304
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,539
Blood!

305
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,541
What's going on here?

306
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:05,480
Let's go, or even we will die.

307
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:12,924
You are sleeping? Making me cry, you are sleeping
here?

308
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,825
You are sleeping? Making me cry, you are sleeping
here?

309
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,601
Who will roll my joint? Huh?

310
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,090
Who will roll my joint? Huh?

311
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,502
Let's go. -Wait!

312
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,437
Where did the jerk go?

313
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,101
What have we got to do with the conductor?

314
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:34,212
Let's go back. Look at this blood.

315
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,511
Let's go back. Look at this blood.

316
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,117
It's only over here, nowhere else.

317
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:44,114
It seems like from here, straight up...

318
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,523
Run!

319
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,526
Guddu!

320
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,858
What happened?

321
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,468
Tell us what happened? What did you see? What
happened?

322
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,802
What happened? Why don't you tell us what
happene

323
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,277
Conductor.. his blood... - Blood?

324
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:09,075
Conductor.. his blood... - Blood?

325
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,478
Someone from above... - Shona?

326
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,059
Shona.

327
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,061
Shona.

328
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,055
You'll come to no harm, child.

329
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,467
Oh God. Kaalo has come for this child.

330
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,802
Oh, so this is the girl because of whom all this is
happening?

331
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,077
Throw her out!

332
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,806
Even I saw it.That witch looked at her.

333
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,412
Throw the girl out!

334
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:29,077
If we don't throw her out, the witch will kill us all.

335
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,087
If the root of the problem is this girl, let's throw her
out.

336
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,492
Throw her out! - She's not a kid, she's death for all of
us.

337
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:37,086
Throw her out! - She's not a kid, she's death for all of
us.

338
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:44,902
Throw her out!

339
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,096
Throw her out!

340
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,990
Don't any of you dare to touch the girl!

341
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,649
Don't any of you dare to touch the girl!

342
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:10,458
Shona will not go anywhere. And if anyone touches
her,

343
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,055
remember, I will kill him before Kaalo does!

344
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,503
Kaalo! Listen, Kaalo has seen us.

345
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,097
And whoever she sees once, she doesn't spare
them.

346
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,243
We must leave this place and leave the borders of
Kulbhata.

347
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:03,043
We must leave this place and leave the borders of
Kulbhata.

348
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:06,048
But she will never let that happen

349
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,051
My God! The witch has seen us!

350
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:09,620
Don't worry, it's going to be alright.

351
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,781
Don't worry, it's going to be alright.

352
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,650
Sit tight. I will get everyone out of here.

353
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,297
Damn Kaalo! I'll deal with the witch! - Careful!

354
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:20,786
Damn Kaalo! I'll deal with the witch! - Careful!

355
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,069
Damn you!

356
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,086
Damn you!

357
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,091
Damn you!

358
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,102
Damn you!

359
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,530
She's Kaalo! She went under the bus.

360
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,883
The tank of the bus is leaking. Everyone get out.

361
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:05,822
Get out! Ouick! Hurry! Run!

362
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,834
Rukmini, run fast!

363
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,111
Shona!

364
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,516
Run!

365
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,533
Run fast! Careful!

366
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,085
Shona!

367
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,490
Run! Run!

368
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,128
Guddu, we have to get rid of this girl,

369
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:46,856
or we all will die.

370
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,075
Let's go.

371
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,070
Leave my hand.

372
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,081
She's somewhere here.

373
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,085
Run!

374
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,089
Run! Rukmini, run, run, run!

375
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,495
Faster. Faster.

376
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:38,445
Hasmukh, let's go! Let's move. Fast! Fast! Fast!

377
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,523
Oh my God.Where's my hat? I'll just get my hat.

378
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,117
No Hasmukh, where are you going?

379
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,130
Hasmukh, no. Hasmukh.

380
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:04,073
Hasmukh, come back! Hasmukh! Are you mad?

381
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:08,078
Hasmukh, please don't go.

382
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:11,481
Hasmukh. Hasmukh. Hasmukh.

383
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:17,815
Hasmukh, please. Hasmukh, please don't.

384
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,490
Hasmukh, please don't go.

385
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,098
Hasmukh, come back.

386
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:52,522
Hasmukh! Hasmukh!

387
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,126
Hasmukh! Hasmukh!

388
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:03,466
Hasmukh! Hasmukh!

389
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,476
Careful.

390
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,083
Hurry!

391
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,503
Over here.

392
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,469
Rukmini!

393
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,480
Relax. Relax.

394
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,816
Come.

395
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,469
What are you doing?

396
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,667
I'd brought explosives to dig a well in my village.

397
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,078
But I guess it's required more over here now.

398
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,477
It's no use. -What do you mean?

399
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:34,482
There are some powers that can be destroyed only
with their power

400
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:38,486
Even Kaalo can be killed with her own weapon,
none else.

401
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,816
Where can we get her weapon from? -Then nothing
can be done.

402
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,094
No power in the world can save us from dying.

403
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,498
There are some weapons that can stall her death for
some time,

404
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,828
but not finish her.

405
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,834
So what should we do? Just sit back and do
nothing?

406
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,505
Sit here and wait for death to com

407
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,771
That is the truth, Sameer. We cannot do anything.

408
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,571
Certain things are beyond mankind.

409
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:11,043
We have to kill her, then whether she is a witch, or
anyone else.

410
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:17,449
Then whether she dies with her weapon, or with
explosives.

411
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,463
There is one option.

412
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,069
What option?

413
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,472
There is a jeep over there. If I reach there somehow,

414
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,404
we may not have to kill Kaalo.

415
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,068
No, you will not go there.You won't.

416
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,078
Sir, I don't know how ferocious Kaalo is.

417
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,808
But I will fight until I am alive.

418
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,092
We'll come to no harm, dear.

419
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:54,487
Sir, take care of Shona. -Yes.

420
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,528
He must be a dead man by now.

421
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,123
So what do we do now?

422
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:53,138
You take care of the old couple.

423
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,548
Oh God, what do we do? Sameer is not to be seen.

424
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,880
Could Kaalo have... - No.

425
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:07,085
Until then, I'll get rid of that jinxed girl.

426
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,499
Uncle, send that girl here.

427
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,106
Uncle.

428
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,110
Come on.

429
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,096
Glory to Lord Hanuman, a sea of knowledge'

430
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,828
Glory to the Monkey God, the enlightened one''

431
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:23,097
A devotee of Lord Ram, he is very brave''

432
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,110
He's the son of Anjani and Pawan, the God ofWind''

433
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,119
Ghosts and spirits cannot come near you''

434
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,124
When you chant his name

435
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,118
He can cure all illnesses, eliminate all pain'

436
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,133
Just invoke him

437
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,480
Listen! Just listen!

438
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,815
Guddu! Guddu! Sameer, listen to me.

439
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,089
Guddu, help!

440
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,818
Someone stop them! - Uncle, help!

441
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:21,086
Sameer, leave him. - Uncle!

442
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,495
Sameer, leave him.

443
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:32,507
Leave him! Why are you fighting? -What are you
two doing!

444
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,113
Stop!

445
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,118
Move! Sameer, leave him.

446
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,185
Uncle!

447
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,129
Uncle!

448
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:04,404
Enough! Enough!Why are you after each other's lif

449
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,403
If you have to fight each other and die,

450
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,477
why are you running away in fear from Kaalo?

451
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,408
Huh? Why are you running away from her?

452
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:16,474
If you have to fight, don't fight to belittle each other

453
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,486
Fight to finish Kaalo.

454
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:22,080
Fight to finish Kaalo.

455
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:26,493
I trusted you, sir.

456
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,098
I trusted you!

457
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,491
I trusted you. - I got scared.

458
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,109
Let's run out of here.

459
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,110
Come. Come on!

460
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,513
Hurry!

461
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:06,057
Chandan, remove it.

462
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,468
Remove it!

463
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,471
Hey! Remove it fast!

464
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:18,080
Remove it, Chandan!

465
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:29,083
Chandan. Hey! Chandan!

466
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:33,826
Forgive me, friend.

467
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:39,830
I feel she is flying over us.

468
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:45,836
I don't want to die. I'm going.

469
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:51,512
Chandan! You rascal!

470
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,849
I survived! I survived!

471
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,104
Remove it, please.

472
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,508
Remove it, Sameer. Save me!

473
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:59,114
That bloody friend of mine!

474
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,041
Remove it.

475
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,044
Sameer.

476
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,457
Sameer, you leave.

477
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:18,058
Sameer, you leave. Go, Sameer.

478
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:31,080
Guddu, I escaped!

479
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:41,489
Guddu. I tried to save you.

480
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,093
I even extended my hand.

481
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:55,104
Don't come near me, or I'll kill you! Go away!

482
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:57,504
I'll kill you!

483
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:03,443
I'll kill you. Go away! I'll kill you up there!

484
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,447
No one can kill me! Go and kill Guddu.

485
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,783
Guddu. At that tree...

486
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:18,058
A knife was stuck in his hand.

487
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,462
He must be in pain. He must be in terrible pain.

488
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:28,469
Forgive me!

489
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,800
Forgive me, friend.

490
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,075
What could I do? It's not my fault.

491
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,095
I'll kill you. Go away!

492
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,496
Move back!

493
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:18,452
I'll kill you! Don't come near me. I'm not scared. Hey!
I'm not scare

494
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,047
I'm not scared.

495
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:56,141
Husband! Husband!Where did you go away?

496
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,144
Husband!

497
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,488
Where did my husband go?

498
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,082
Where did he go? We were walking together.
Husband!

499
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:08,097
Husband! Husband!

500
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,141
Leave me!

501
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:58,136
Husband! No!

502
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:26,097
I'd trusted you, sir. I'd trusted you!

503
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:28,508
I'd trusted you.

504
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:50,132
Husband!

505
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,131
Husband!

506
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,127
Uncle.

507
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,498
Uncle, my wool. - Yes.

508
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,108
Mother. Mother.

509
01:15:57,153 --> 01:16:01,055
Uncle. Arrogant uncle.

510
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:23,078
Uncle.

511
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,481
No.

512
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,085
Uncle.

513
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,491
Arrogant uncle.

514
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:53,108
He brought the miracle herb and saved Laxman''

515
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:57,510
Lord Ram was very pleased

516
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:01,776
You give all the joys

517
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,052
When you are my saviour, why should I fear
anything?'

518
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:08,453
All troubles, all pain vanishes, once you chant he
name of Lord Han

519
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:13,051
Oh Lord, have mercy on me

520
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,067
Shona.

521
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,079
Uncle.

522
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:59,090
Shona. Shona.

523
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,436
Shona, what happened, dear?

524
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,445
Let's go.

525
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:28,052
Arrogant uncle, I have to go to my grandma's
house.

526
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:32,793
I'll drop you to your grandma's house. - And you?

527
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:38,062
Where will you go? - I'll go home.To my village.

528
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:41,472
But how will you dig a well now?

529
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,479
Your explosives are over.

530
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,070
I'll have to think of something.

531
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:52,476
I'll make you dig it. - Careful!
