The last viceroy, Louis Batten.

The flag raising and the salute"

...were done amidst the
most fantastic rejoicing.

When the flag broke a brilliant
rainbow appeared in the sky..

29
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,727
...which was taken by
the crowd as a good omen.

30
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,442
Get him!

31
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,663
Oh.

32
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,442
I was waiting for you.

Our British Company can
bring freedom to your country"

34
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:35,691
"but I will never bring
freedom to your village

I want every resource of this village

36
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,923
This is mine.

37
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,633
And you..
I always wanted to wear gold jewels..

38
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,404
"But you made me wear this bandage.

39
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,446
You don't like me, right?
You always want to fight me

40
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,708
Fight and fight, right?

41
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,857
Take the sword.
Take the sword and fight with me.

42
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,592
Fight with me you bloody lndian..

43
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,936
Come on! Come on!

44
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,648
I have a lot of curiosity
towards that village, sir.

45
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,921
I too feel the same.

46
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,793
"But don't you think you
are wasting both energy and time?

47
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,729
That's not so, sir.

48
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,963
After reading about that
village and the people in history..

49
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,198
...l feel like conducting research.
- Good morning, sir.

50
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,566
...and make a program

51
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,143
If I find clue;
I will make interesting program.

52
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,612
"Otherwise, lwill consider
it to be a good tour and come back.

53
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,750
Look sir, about that village,
people and the history that I read..

54
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,720
...and about my tour to that village,
I have written in this letter.

55
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,222
Letter? For whom?
- To the Home Minister:

56
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,689
Home Minister? Why Home Minister?

57
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,058
Who else other than him has to be
concerned about the border of Karnamaka.

58
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,758
Okay, go ahead.

59
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,872
If the program turns out to be a hit,
our channel will get TRP. Okay, go.

60
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,734
Harish, come here.
- Thank you, sir.

61
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,818
You can't get away.

62
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,669
You want to click photos?

63
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,835
Now, click my photo.

64
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,715
Greetings, sir. My name is Divya.

65
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,548
I work as a reporter
with a news channel.

66
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,618
When I was looking for
historical places in Karnataka.

67
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,954
...to conduct programs for the channel..

68
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,723
...when I studying a book
called History of Karnamaka.

69
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,731
...l came across the name of a village".

70
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,027
...the name of that
village is Vikramathirta.

71
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,729
The speciality of that village is
people who lived there were Gandhavas.

72
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,773
They actually belonged
to the Mysuru royal family.

73
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:27,003
In 1764, after the
attack by a muslim king.

74
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:31,272
...they escaped towards
the state of Maharashtra.

75
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,651
...now in Belagavi of Karnamaka.

76
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,779
Although, they lived there..

77
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,290
"They used to speak
only in Mysuru Kannada

78
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,294
Now, my intention behind
writing this letter is that.

79
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,656
...when I ran through the map of
Karnamaka to inquire about that village..

80
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,026
"There is no trace of it.

81
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,900
I also inquired all the departments
related to this village.

82
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,940
...but they said that a village
by this name doesn't exist in Karnataka

83
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:02,170
...go the same answer response
even when I inquired in Karnamaka.

84
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,909
So the information available
regarding the village is fake?

85
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,646
I request your government
to inquire about that village.

86
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,247
Even I'm in the process
of finding that village

87
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,148
Yours sincerely Divya.

88
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,021
Hari.
- Sir?

89
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,292
Such a village in our state?

90
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,801
Send for that reporter.
- Okay, sir.

91
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,769
It is very unfortunate that the border
issue has cropped up again.

92
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,669
We are looking into the matter.
Greetings

93
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,307
Sir.
- Yes.

94
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:36,312
I had phoned the channel
office to summon the news reporter..

95
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,979
"They said she hasn't come
to office for the last ten days

96
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,279
Even her phone is not reachable.

97
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,349
She said she was going to
that village but never returned.

98
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,784
Her parents have also lodged
a complaint regarding the same -I see.

99
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,330
I think she must've landed
in trouble in the same village, sir.

100
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,921
I see. I will speak to the CM.

101
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,163
Let's see what can be done.
Not to worry.

102
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,799
Greeting; Mr. CM.

103
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,972
Many many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.

104
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,273
Why are you lame?
-I was busy with work.

105
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,840
What's the need to work
after becoming a minister?

106
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,682
People vote for us
so that we make money..

107
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,848
...and spend more money
on the next elections

108
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,085
Sorry, sir. I only believe
in people's love, trust and faith.

109
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,125
...that's how I won elections
eight times..

110
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,893
...hence I don't understand
your calculations

111
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,359
That's true. Had you understood earlier"

112
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,698
...it wouldn't take so much time for
you to become a home minister:

113
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,466
Let's not talk about it. I need to
talk to you about something important.

114
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:42,973
What's the need to talk about work
in the party? Drink and enjoy yourself.

115
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,073
Ifl don't tell you what I'm here
to say and start drinking..

116
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,413
...your political career will get ruined.

117
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,687
Sir, I never took the letter seriously..

118
00:11:54,214 --> 00:12:00,187
...but the reporter who wrote the letter
went to that village and has gone missing.

119
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,991
After I learnt about it,
I have considered it seriously.

120
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,105
I also inquired the
relevant departments.

121
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,505
"According to the information
I got from them is that.

122
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,473
...no such village
by this name even exist.

123
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,746
Then where did the girl go?

124
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,944
Please look into the matter
and order for an inquiry, sir.

125
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,753
Mr. Home Minister:

126
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,897
If you don't want me to
be in this party, please go home

127
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,064
It's a silly matter,
why are you troubling me for that?

128
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,738
Let that be. Have people
ever talked about that village?

129
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,243
No. - Did the opposition
party raise questions about it?

130
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,346
No. - ls there any pressure
from the central government?

131
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,407
No.
- Look..

132
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,552
...the media itself is not
reporting the news on the channel..

133
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,957
...then why are you concerned?

134
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:07,360
Listen, no one knows with
whom did that reporter eloped.

135
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,926
She has just fooled you before she left.

136
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:17,365
If what you said is true..

137
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,542
...and it has not
come to light for days..

138
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,015
...there must be influenced
people like behind it.

139
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,081
So, let's not even get involved in it.

140
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:35,023
Sir, being the CM of this state,
you mustn't talk like that.

141
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,825
At least, let's try to
find out about that village

142
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,092
Amongst all the ministers in our party"

143
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,293
...you are the only minister
who opposes things

144
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,531
You trouble us more
than the opposition party.

145
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:54,806
Wham to do? You are our senior.

146
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,239
We can never say no to you

147
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:02,551
Okay. Do whatever you want.

148
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,919
Thank you, sir.

149
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,089
Oh my god.

150
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,856
Is there a place like
this in Karnataka, sir?

151
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,330
I don't know. Maybe or may not be.

152
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,936
Okay, sir. I will send a
special team to this place, sir.

153
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,303
Don't.

154
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:29,243
If people find out a reporter
has gone missing in that place.

155
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,946
...our government will get a bad name.

156
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,519
I have a serious doubt.

157
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,519
The girl who conducted
research about that place..

158
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,155
...has gone missing
after she went there.

159
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,924
...l'm very suspicious about that place

160
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,434
Therefore, I have decided
to conduct a secret operation

161
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,302
Okay, sir.

162
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,307
If you know any young man..

163
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:02,276
"With passion and zest and
wants to join police, let's send him

164
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,940
Sir, we don't know
anything about that place.

165
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,550
How can we appoint
someone in that place?

166
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,418
Let's find such a candidate.

167
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,592
...and I will tell
you how to go about it.

168
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:21,465
But is there a rough
and tough candidate?

169
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,129
Vi krarna!

170
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,940
Vi krarna!

171
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,167
Vi krarna!

172
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,004
Vi krarna!

173
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,637
You are rejected.

174
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,206
I very know that I won't selected.

175
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,578
...until you die or you get retried.

176
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,745
"But listen to me carefully,
I will never give you bribe

177
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,024
Bye.
- Okay. Get going.

178
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,359
Darn it The terrorists
plant bombs wherever they want.

179
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,524
"They should plant in
the houses of officers like him.

180
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,659
What was the need to tuck my shin in?

181
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,133
I'm very thirsty

182
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,608
I want water to drink

183
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,718
<i>'NM gave m.?</i>

184
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,388
This is 3852nd water
bottle that I'm giving you

185
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,627
Deduct from the dowry you pay me

186
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,296
Should I give you dowry?

187
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,737
It's not ajoke to marry you.

188
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,108
I see.

189
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,276
After I marry you and run the family..

190
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:53,110
...and go mad,
I will need money for the treatment.

191
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,348
The salary I get after becoming
a policeman won't be sufficient.

192
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:02,583
Don't be overconfident. First, become
a policeman and then talk about salary

193
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,562
You are mocking me too? Alright.

194
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,792
I will definitely become a policeman.

195
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,702
I hope the officer who
conducts interview dies.

196
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,598
He is after me for bribe.

197
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,300
Come, let's sit down.

198
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,810
How much is he demanding for? I will
talk to my father and get you money.

199
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,708
Then become a policeman
and marry me quickly.

200
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,846
Many guys are trying to woo me

201
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,286
Hey. They say that if we
get married after the age of 30..

202
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,589
...it is difficult to have children.

203
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,289
Really?
- Yes.

204
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,664
Look, the officer is not only
letting me become a police officen.

205
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,236
...he has also creating
hurdles in my marriage

206
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,164
Hey, the home minister is their boss..

207
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,205
...how about complaining to him
and seek help to become a policeman?

208
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,470
Okay.

209
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,876
Let's try doing that well.

210
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,549
He should've got promotion
long time back, but he didn't get it..

211
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,453
...so, he is getting restless.

212
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,389
Hey, why are you getting scared?

213
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,453
I'm not scared.
- Then?

214
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,256
I want to urinate

215
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,630
If I leave this place,
I won't get the job.

216
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,896
Look, I'm also sacrificing
this for police job

217
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,739
As if you are sacrificing
petrol found in Arab country.

218
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,207
Yes. Wait and watch
I will conven urine to fuel.

219
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,576
The home minister is coming.

220
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,518
The CM has summoned me,
tell them to come tomorrow. -Okay, sir.

221
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,419
Come tomorrow. Sir has to meet the CM.
- Greetings, sir.

222
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,758
Sir, greetings Sir, my name is Vikram

223
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,886
My passion is to
become a policeman, sir.

224
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,425
Please help me, sir.
- Look..

225
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,694
...to become a policeman,
you need to take police training"

226
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,269
...and attend interview"

227
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,736
"but if you ask me, what can I do?

228
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,968
Correct, sir.
Wham you said is correct, sir..

229
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,309
"But please take a look at my file...
- Let's go.

230
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,538
Sir! Sir!

231
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,515
Vikram!
- Sir! Sir!

232
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,642
Sir!

233
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,584
Oh.

234
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,390
So this what is called breaking rules?

235
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:22,325
I must say, becoming a policeman will
not give me more happiness than this.

236
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,297
Oh.

237
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,372
Such a pleasure

238
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,447
You agreed with whatever
the home minister said, now what?

239
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,909
Darn it. I couldn't even talk
to him properly because of this

240
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,750
I think he was quite busy.
- You never listen to me.

241
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,754
You think meeting the home
minister is a child's game?

242
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,894
I will play a child's game.

243
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,841
Sir. Sir, please don't scream

244
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,671
Who are you? Wham are you doing here?

245
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:11,237
Sir, neither I am a terrorist,
naxalite, ghost or devil.

246
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,752
It is 3 am now,
so I can't say this morning"

247
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,320
...recall what happened yesterday, sir.

248
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,556
I brought this file to you
saying I want to become a policeman.

249
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,392
But I told you what you need to do.

250
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,520
Sir, like you said,
even I applied for the job.

251
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,627
...l also go for training,
but I don't get selected.

252
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,860
Why?
- Because of bribe.

253
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,396
Because of bribe, sir.

254
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,003
It's no big deal, ifl tell my girlfriend,
she will give me money immediately.

255
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,774
...and I can become police officen.

256
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,869
"But ifl give bribe for once..

257
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,472
...all I will think of recovering
the bribe money somehow.

258
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,414
Ifl start taking bribe,
I will never be able to give up on it.

259
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,987
Sir, according to
me bribe is like AIDS..

260
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,583
...it is difficult to get rid of it.
Aml right, sir?

261
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,623
Am I talking too much, sir?

262
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,756
First of all, I shouldn't have
entered your personal room.

263
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,732
...and moreover, I see the fit of rage
in your eyes for barging in at midnight.

264
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,602
Sir, all I want to say is.

265
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,573
...l don't wish to give bribe and
become a policeman with a huge paunch.

266
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,906
I want to show people
the power of police, sir.

267
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
I want to become such a policeman, sir.

268
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,918
Sir, please have a look.
I came 1st in running"

269
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,825
...1st in jumping,
physically fit, perfect height.

270
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,551
Forget all this, sir.

271
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,891
Sir, there's tight
security in your house..

272
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,126
"But I still managed to barge in,
how courageously I should be.

273
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,135
Sorry, sir.

274
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,978
'Do you know any rough
and tough candidate?'

275
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,814
You are selected.

276
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,651
Sir.

277
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,528
He is wearing police uniform?

278
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,500
Shekar. - Sir.
- Did you see him?

279
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,774
He has lost his mind since
he didn't get selected in police.

280
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:22,077
He is wandering about
wearing police dress.

281
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:26,411
Hey, it's an offence
wearing police uniform.

282
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,918
I will put you behind the bars Idiot.

283
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,750
Listen, you idiot.

284
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,884
How can I humiliate you?
You are my senior in post.

285
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,525
Now, both of us are policemen.

286
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,529
...so give respect and take respect.

287
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,624
Hey, who said you are a policeman?

288
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,694
Didn't you get message
from the commissioner?

289
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,774
I think he picked phone,
dialed the number..

290
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:55,676
"Infantry Road, Cubbon Park, Chalukya
Circle, the phone is going to ring.

291
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:01,980
Take the phone.

292
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,083
Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,125
Shivmunhy, I am commissioner speaking.

294
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,159
Sir, good morning.
- Morning, morning

295
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,230
A guy named Vikram will come to you.

296
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,557
"Take the list of police duty
and some application forms.

297

Sign them and send it to me

298
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,469
Sir, is this guy appointed
in the police department?

299
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,535
No, nothing like that.

300
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,137
Sir, please repeat it once again.

301
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,747
Hello, can you hear me?
He is not a policeman.

302
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,645
Listen, listen to me carefully,
that guy is not a policeman.

303
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,451
Sign those documents
and send him to me. Okay?

304
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,820
Okay sir, I will send it, sir.
Thank you, sir.

305
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,488
Hey, did you hear that?

306
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,157
Idiot

307
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,893
Take this and give it
to the commissioner. Get out!

308
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,040
Kid, listen to me.
- Sir..

309
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,140
...l swear on my mother, today morning..

310
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,548
"At 3, home minister
said that I was selected.

311
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,517
Okay; okay.

312
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,920
You told my enemy that
I was not a policeman

313
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,686
One minute"
- Sir, I thought I was a policeman.

314
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,693
...and you would give me uniform later"

315
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,526
...so I got it stitched from
the tailor shop name JigganL.

316
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,625
...poor old man, I tortured
him to stitch these clothes. - Kid.

317
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,295
...he was so exhausted that
he got hospitalized.

318
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,540
...and was not able to stitch the pant.

319
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,004
Okay, dear. Listen to me

320
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:36,944
I did so much, but in ajiffy
you said I'm not a policeman, sir.

321
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,313
Look, listen to me.
Don't cry. Listen to me.

322
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,950
Wait. He is coming.
He will come. - No, sir.

323
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,579
I've phoned him Look, he is here

324
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,065
Good morning, sir.

325
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,300
Thanks for coming, sir.

326
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,298
It didn't take so much effort
for me to even calm my own children.

327
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:03,766
Wham happened?

328
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:04,306
Nothing, sir.

329
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,110
I told him 'I told the police
officer that you're not a policeman'..

330
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,779
...so he is crying like a child.

331
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:20,579
I don't know whether
you are lucky or unlucky.

332
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,216
Why are you scaring
me saying all this sir?

333
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,051
Nothing like than.

334
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,162
So, are you ready to become a policeman?

335
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:34,037
Sir, I swear by the siren on your car,
I'm ready.

336
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:36,602
Look
- Yes, sir.

337
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,733
In our past history and in our future.

338
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,270
...l don't think anyone would
become a good officer like you

339

00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:59,624
...and if you still want to become
apprentice police.

343

Sir, am I a policeman now?

353

Ye; you are a policeman.
- That's enough.

354

In that case, I will face anything
that comes before me. No problem.

Being a home minister why
are you doing this secretly?

For the power you have,
you can do anything.

The politicians who can do
anything to fulfill their self needs..

You didn't come inside the temple too.
What happened?

373
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,043
God is very bad. He betrayed me.

374
00:28:55,934 --> 00:29:00,076
Really? I thought God only grants boon
or curse. Does he also betrays people?

375
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,979
Super. How did He betray you?

376
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,756
I made a vow for your police job..

377
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,190

kinds of veneramions..

378
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,862
"But He is still betrayed me

379
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:18,097
Paru, God didn't betray you..

380
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,770
...He blessed with a police job.

381
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:28,000
I vowed that you don't get a police job.

382
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,150
You wretched girl.
You are my biggest enemy.

383
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,816
That's why it took me
several days to get police job.

384

I will kill you.

Okay, kill me, that would be betten.

387
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,252
Scared?

388
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,524
Why are you scared? Why?

389
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,767
If you find a girl
who is beautiful than me..

390
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,199
...you might forget me

391
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,372
I see. So, you don't trust me at all.

392
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:09,511
Well, you said beautiful girl than you..

393

I was recalling the
day you proposed to me.

not giving me any remuneration.

Ticket, sir.
- Sir, no discount on ticket price?

462
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,258
Discount? Had the stone which
your girl thaw hit the glass.

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,209
...when you asked for
discount in the ticket.

467
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,608
Look, forget the expenses of the women..

468
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,913
...no matter how much we men save,
it is not sufficient.

469
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,720
Really? I see. I have no idea

470
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,488
My girl never made me
spend even a single rupee.

471
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,227
In fact, I took Rs. 2000 from her.

472
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,460
I see. You are very smart.

473
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,266

Buy tickets and commence your
journey otherwise I will lose my job.

479
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,420
Karnataka ends here?

480
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,553
The home minister said
it's within the border.

481
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:35,427
Darn it. I don't find
anyone to ask for address.

482
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,365
I can't. I can't walk anymore

483
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,605
I can see someone working there,
I will go and ask them

484
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,715
Before I go, I will join the duty.

485
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,288
I have told the tailor to send my pant.

486

Excuse me.
ls this Vikramamhina? - Come here

490
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,412
This is Karnamaka state, isn't it?

491
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,075
Then why does the board
say Karnataka ends here?

492
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,419
Tell me, boss.

493
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,925
Hey. What? What are you doing?

494
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,992
They won't spare you if they see you.

Not just you they will beat me too.
Go and work.

00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,959
Where is the police station?
- Police station?

00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,732
It was destroyed several years ago.

498
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,007
Who are you? Are you police?

499
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,703
Ye; I'm apprentice police,
I'm a policeman

500
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,407
Whoever comes here,
they have to meet Padne Bhai first.

I don't know him
\Mll you please introduce him to me?

502

00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:23,499
Tell him to get out of my sight.

...l will send him straight to god.

509
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,442
He looks like atypical villager.

510
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,943
Kaalu, send him away.

511
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,052
What did he say?
- 'Why have the police come here?'

512
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,752
'Tell him to go away from here.'

513
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:51,987
'Otherwise, I will kill him.'

514
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:00,862
'You can also face several troubles'

515
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,533
'You can also face several
troubles' - Get out of my sight.

516
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,208
He says he will kill you, sir.

517
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,781
Vi krarna!

518
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,522
Vi krarna!

519
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,895
Vi krarna!

520
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,532
Vi krarna!

521
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,385
Since they've destroyed
the police station here.

522
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:33,054
"Hereafter,
his office will be the police station.

523
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,817
Hey, bring the board!

524
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,791
Vi krarna!

525
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,355
Vi krarna!

526
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:45,098
Vikrama! - Glory to Kulkarni!

527
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,932
Glory to Kulkarni!

528
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:58,338
Poor men and women of this area

529
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,213
Accept kulkarni's greeting.

530
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:08,983
If someone is corrupt in this area.

531
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,787
What?
- And from my party"

532
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,665
Yes, boss

533
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,263
Out of the way. Move.

534
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,106
Before I go see my brother..

535
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,306
...the one who thrashed my brother,
his dead body should be in the hospital.

536
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,747
I don't know what you will do.

537
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,288
Who thrashed my brother?
- Police, boss.

538
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:44,952
I have never allowed police
here ever since my father was alive..

539
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,756
...where did police come from now?

540
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,798
Who? Who are you?

541
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,097
Why have they confined you?

542
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,828
Why do you want to die fearing him?

543
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:59,875
Where is the sand going?
What's going on? Tell me

544
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:03,810
We don't know, sir. Not from now..

545
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,276
"This has been going
on for several years.

546
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,476
They say all this don't belong
to us though we are Kannadiga

547
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:14,219
They say everything belongs to them,
sir. That's all we know.

548
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,316
Believe us.

549
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:31,102
Sir, they are bad people
Please go away, sir.

550
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:35,242
Sir, please go away from here.
They are bad people

551
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,314
Believe me, go away from here.

552
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,495
Padne. Padne, get up.

553
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,931
Your brother has come. Get up, Padne

554
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:08,477
Sir, he is in coma
- Coma?

555
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,178
Sir, someone hit him with
a metal which is stronger than iron.

556
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,011
He hit him with his hands, boss

557
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,095
Ambulance has come

558
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,197
Padne. Padne, get up.

559
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,493
The one who thrashed you,
his dead body has come.

560
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,196
Get up, Padne. Get up, Padne

561
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,557
Padne.

562
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:11,372
All that we have..

563
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:17,477
"Sickle, rods, sword, bring everything

564
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:22,110
That wretched fellow, he will die..

565
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,050
...in my hands.

566
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:32,287
Along with police job,
I have also been doing welding job.

567
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,554
Great. There is no gym here,
it was more like workout in the gym.

568
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:44,366
Hey, why are you standing like this,
the chain has been removed.

569
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:48,100
Move freely, you needn't fear anybody.

570
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,906
I'm with you This is your place.

571
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,249
This place only belongs to you.

572
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:56,317
"L'm only for you."

573
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,280
"I'm only for you."

574
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,085
"This place is for."

575
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,890
"Don't cry, don't grieve."

576
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:09,227
"Don't cry, don't grieve."

577
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,392
"Live happily now."

578
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:14,595
"Live happily now."

579
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,964
"I'm only for you."

580
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,534
I remembered the song from
the film 'Mayura', I was lost.

581
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:28,279
Now, I need to go patrolling.

582
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,249
Since there used to
be a police station here.

583
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,320
...there surely must
be details of this place.

584
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,185
"But I'm don't know anything,
hence I will go find out.

585
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,229
I have a doubt on the
border that I crossed.

586
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,263
The border looks more like
India and Pakistan borders..

587
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,430
...l'm sure it's not
the work of our government.

588
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:54,635
...because our government
doesn't spend money on such things

589
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,274
Seeing the state of the village
and the people here, I feel..

590
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:03,108
...the people who thrashed by me,
it is their handiwork.

591
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,978
Out of passion for the police
uniform and since I joined the duty"

592
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,555
"let's go and fix a border.

593
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,452
Mum do you say?

594
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:17,394
Say yes. - Yes.
- That's good.

595
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,434
Jeep

596
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:23,030
After his office become
a police station.

597
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,971
"Nothing wrong if his
jeep becomes department jeep.

598
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:30,976
Say yes Just say yes
for everything I say. -Yes.

599
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:35,049
Everything is okay,
but one thing is missing

600
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,982
Bring the limestone paste.

601
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,623
There's one more thing
to write with this.

602
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,394
Who is he? Why is he coming so speed?

603
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,465
Hey. ls it him?
- Yes, it's him

604
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:31,072
Go! Go! Go!

605
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:35,702
Crash into him, along with
thejeep even he must burn into ashes.

606
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,168
Since he is coming so speedily.

607
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,270
...l think it must be the brother of
the one who got threshed by me

608
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,019
When people who got thrashed are coming
so speedily, it was I who thrashed them.

609
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:48,385
...l must be going more speed, right?

610
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,728
The power doesn't lie in the jeep..

611
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,265
"Police, the power lies in that.

612
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,195
I have already proved how strong I am..

613
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:42,477
...if you still have any doubt,
let's fight again.

614
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,738
Am I right?

615
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,166
You snatched the strength
of this village.

616
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:11,169
"But now,
the village has regained its strength

617
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:16,869
Let me tell you something.
Don't try to mess with me..

618
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:18,641
"Otherwise you will be burnt to ashes.

619
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,585
I can kill you with just two blows..

620
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:25,720
"But I'm not here for that.

621
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:37,490
Vi krarna!

622
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:41,397
You better think a thousand
times before you cross this board.

623
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,405
Vi krarna!

624
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:47,868
Vi krarna!

625
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,908
Okay.

626
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:01,252
Hereafter; you will do what I say..

627
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:05,791
...because I'm the newly appointed
apprentice police to this station

628
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,354
Okay?
<i>'</i> 0kay_

629
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:12,423
Now, men sit here and women sit here

630
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,965
Get up. Come here

631
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,261
Sit here. Sit.

632
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:22,367
Sit. Sit properly.
Hereafter, men are constables.

633
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:25,208
...and women are lady constables Okay?

634
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,839
Did a girl come here anytime recently?

635
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,246
Yes, she did come They killed her,
it was I who buried her.

636
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,257
Firstly, stop the work you
were doing for all these days.

637
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:43,723
Dig the place thoroughly.

638
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:48,827
When you dig,
you see than, those big poles, idols..

639
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:51,839
...if you find any other strange items..

640
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,408
"Bring them to me.

641
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:57,001
Okay? Super. Phone.

642
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,008
It's the home minister: Sir, greetings.

643
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:04,616
Hello. How are you?

644
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,723
Did you find the place? - Sir, I did
find the place and I'm also in trouble.

645
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,553
How is the environment there?

646
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,754
I didn't check the environment,
humidity or the temperature..

647
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,297
...as soon as I came here, there was
a fight and four men died on the spot..

648
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,458
...and I freed the poor
people from a MLA captive.

649
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,399
MLA?
- Yes sir, MLA

650
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,698
Sir, one more important thing.

651
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,366
You told me about the
girl who wrote the letter..

652
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:28,466
...they murdered and
buried her right here

653
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,435
Murder?
- The villagers told me, sir.

654
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:34,878
Sir, the sand here is
exported to an unknown place.

655
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,342
I have no idea to which place.

656
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:41,787
People here are Kannadigas,
but their employers.

657
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,825
...speak both Kannada and Marathi, sir.

658
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:48,455
But... who is the MLA?
- His name is Kulkarni.

659
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:51,931
Kulkarni? I will give you his details.
Keep one thing in mind.

660
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:57,471
If he informs his state
and creates an issue.

661
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,598
"This case can go
to the supreme court.

662
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,471
...in case he doesn't do anything"

663
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:04,774
...and remains quiet that means
he is betraying his state

664
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,848
Let's wait and see Okay, good night.

665
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,349
Good night.

666
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,755
Kulkarni, M LA Kulkarni.

667
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,824
Wham relation does
he have with that village?

668
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,618
There is relation!

669
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:25,091
There is relation!
From three generations.

670
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:29,838
...we have relation with that village

671
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:37,742
When that is so,
who is he who has come here?

672
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:42,750
Boss, with your political power, the one
who has come there, make him a big news.

673
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,787
Hey. You idiot.

674
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,783
Nobody will do such a thing.

675
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:55,890
No one must know about that place.

676
00:55:56,887 --> 00:56:04,601
For the last three generations,
we've been safeguarding that place.

677
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:09,735
But he came here and
messed up everything.

678
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,947
What's all this?

679
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,577
If my leaders find out..

680
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:23,358
"Forget being MLA,
they will kill me instead

681
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:28,027
What do I do?

682
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:34,930
He is a man who plays
football with people's heads.

683
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:37,105
Call the astrologer:

684
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,007
When you can't confront human beings..

685
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,804
...we must kill them with black magic

686
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,571
Call the astrologer!

687
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:06,390
The question says that no one can do
anything to the one who has come there.

688
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,097
Forget the questions, the answer".

689
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,097
...should be his death.

690
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,713
Hail Goddess Mahakali.

691
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:29,122
In the village,
the temple of Lord Vikrameshwara.

692
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:32,524
...the incarnation of Lord Shiva
has been buried.

693
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,722
Hence, to please the Lord.

694
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:38,699
"You need to perform rigorous
veneration for three days.

695
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,430
...only then we can try
doing black magic on him.

696
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:45,530
Black magic,
you must do everything possible

697
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,735
Perform any kind of
veneration to please any God..

698
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:54,577
...when will he die?

699
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,545
Looks like he will
perform black magic on me.

700
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,555
Listen, get started with
the preparations for the veneration.

701
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:05,025
Look at him, he looks so furious

702
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,882
None of you will be able to kill him.

703
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,691
Give up the idea of killing him

704
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,865
My prediction has never gone wrong.

705
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:41,247
You wretched man,
how dare you refuse me?

706
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:49,914
If you can't do anything about him,
I will kill him myself.

707
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,795
Hello, Vikram
- Tell me, sir.

708
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:57,229
As we guessed, the minister
has not come up with the issue.

709
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,231
...by that our movements
will become strong.

710
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,896
That means the minister
is betraying his state government.

711
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:07,441
The documents that you have sent,
I have sent them to the..

712
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,733
...retired sincere authorities of
the archeological department..

713
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,904
...and will get the report very soon..

714
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:15,276
...but there are clues that
they belonged to the old Kannada.

715
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,319
"Advantage is on our side
-Super, sir.

716
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:23,050
Now, the big question I; to which place
the sand is being exported from there.

717
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,023
If that is so,
shall I start the enquiry?

718
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,025
No, no, no.

719
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,096
Let there first be a confirmation.

720
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,791
...that it is our village
and then we will do something.

721
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,228
I will keep you updated
with the developments here.

722
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,793
Are you keeping in
touch with your girlfriend?

723
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,805
Sir, I didn't call my
girl ever since I've come here.

724
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,205
Thanks for reminding, sir.
- How can you do that?

725
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,911
Alright, goodbye.
- I will call you later, sir.

726
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:49,777
Wow. I'm so lucky,
my girl has sent me voice SMS.

727
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,110
Let's hear it.

728
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,882
Did you forget me?
- No.

729
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:56,287
I think you have found
a better girl than me

730
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,883
You neither called me or messaged me

731
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,762
Go after any girl you want.

732
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:06,699
"But before than, I had given you Rs.
6,824 until now..

Otherwise, I have the photos
in which you are kissing me stealthily".

735
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,878
...l will produce them and
lodge rape case against you.

736
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:20,244
You better call me in 10 minutes.

737
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:23,785
Okay?
- Who installed cameras in phones?

738
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:26,352
Darn it. She is very furious
I will call her.

739
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:36,891
You are lucky.
Had you been late even by 30 seconds.

740
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:39,092
...you would've been breaking
news on the news channels.

741
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,169
Why do you talk about rape all the time?

742
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,464
You stoop so low.

743
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,137
That's why you better marry me.

President and Prime minister

Because everyone in the world should know
that this place belongs to Kannadigas

...three times more you used

869
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:50,742
You mean, you want three
times more than I used to send you?

870
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,507
Why? ls there any problem?

871
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,414
I am unable to take one load
sand from here..

872
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:58,383
...and he's asking me to send
three times more.

873
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,621
To hell with him

01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:12,363
Kill that guy somehow and for my sake.

877
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:16,503
"Get that sand loaded
for one last time.

878
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,779
The renowned politician

01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,977
"The people's leader
is with us in our studio today.

01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,681
He wants to give out
an important information..

881
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,984
"Through our channel.

"There was a place name
Vikramamhina which was unknown..

...to Maharastra government or us

888
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,979
Wham is he saying? Let him do anything.

889
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:01,843
Let he get a good name to
the government. That's enough for me.

890
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:06,444
After our efforts, it's been
proved that this village belongs to us.

891
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:10,046
We are feeling very proud
to announce this good news to you

892
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:14,786
All the Kannadigas are obliged
to President for agreeing to this.

01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,922
But we can't say anything about".

We came to know about this unknown
place by a common guy named Vikram.

Sir, no problem sir.

Watch the bloody TV, you idiot!

Hey, turn on the TV, turn it on.

you and not to any government.

You come, sir.

I am coming

916
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,303
This is not a story or novel.

917
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:17,107
But a real incident that
is happening in Karnataka state

918
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:18,310
From the day of independence..

919
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:21,316
"This place was never known
to the common people, but a man..

920

This year,
the Karnamaka government has decided..

Vikramamhina with full passion

The story of finding Vikramathirta
village is very interesting"

925
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:39,764
...and the boy Vikram who worked
hard and brought this place to light.

926

...and solve our problems.
Only then we'll leave this place.

932

01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,390
...he sent it secretly
to the Home Minister.'

938
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:35,184
'Come, let's see the truth behind the
story with Vikram to our correspondent.'

He supported me a lot. Yes.'

One minute. One minute, please.

01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,740
Hello, tell me dear.
Are you watching the TV?

954
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,838
Am I looking smart?

955
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,043
Look, the rate of
dowry will increase now.

956
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,120
So, tell your father
to collect the money soon.

957
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,246
Hey Vikraln,
like I am watching you on TV".

958
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,790
"What will you do
if your parents see you too?

959
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,985
Wham will you do
if they come to know that.

960
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:41,288
...you've become a police office
without their knowledge?

961
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:44,092
'Don't ever tell my parents
that I am a police officer.'

962
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,759

Sir, please sir. Please, stop it.

965
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:58,743
Father?

966
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,843
Vikram, I can't talk to you much now.

967
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:06,214
My mother who was bedridden since
you were born, has regained her senses

968
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:09,353
If you wish to see her,
then come immediately.

969
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:13,084
Father? - Did you call Vikram?
-Yes I did.

970
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:14,889
Oh no!

971
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,464
Sir, please.. Sir, please sir.

972
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,070
Drive fast.

973
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,493
Come

974
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:28,493
I told you not to join
the police department.

975
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:31,428
You went against me and
became a policeman Forget that.

976
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:35,002
I will not scold you for this.

977
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,438
Because since you were born..

978
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,310
...my mother was lying like a zombie,
but she spoke today.

979
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,045
When I was 12 years old, she fell sick.

980
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:49,313
Since that day, I became a mother
to her and she became a kid to me.

981
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:53,425
The pain that I endured for
all these years have come to an end.

982
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:57,063
I never thought I would ever
see my mother like this again.

983
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,990
By god's grace,
she came to her senses Come.

984
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:04,534
'You can tell this day as an
auspicious day for people of Karnataka.

in sword fighting.

998
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,672
Ranganna. tell me something, Ranganna.

999
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,377
...why don't you leave
this village and go and..

01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,450
...join the freedom fight in the town..

1001
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:34,419
...and teach the guys
wrestling and sword fighting?

1002
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:36,247
Those Britishers..

1003
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:41,658
...they will use these skills against them
and we'll at least get independence

1004
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:45,128
You are just wasting your time here

1005
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:48,731
Independence? Father, what is it?

1006
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,196
Why are you listening to him?

1007
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:54,501
He has gone crazy after getting
educated in the city.

1008
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,768
Ashok, you tell me. Wham do we lack?

1009
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:03,347
Has somebody troubled us?
Poor British people..

...come and go once in a bluemoon

1011
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:09,146
They haven't asked us anything
and we haven't given them anything.

1012
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:12,123
Why should we mess with
them unnecessarily?

1013
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,455
We are living in peace,
let's stay in peace

1014
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,258

Don't talk unnecessarily to us.
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

1018
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,730
A guy like him is enough
to ruin the entire village

1019
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,400
I don't know when you will see sense

1020
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:34,479
Everyone, listen to me carefully.

1021
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,776
Every year we perform
this Lord Vikrama's funfair.

1022
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:42,422
...only after Lord Shiva's vehicle,
tiger growls.

1023
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:49,253
Hail Lord Muneshwara!
- Look, look.

1024
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:52,332
...Lord Shiva is getting
restless for the funfair to begin.

1025
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:56,096
So, His vehicle,
tiger is growling from afar.

1026
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,197
We all have gathered here for a reason.

1027
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:03,434
...and that is they say that
they can't permit the statues..

1028
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,739
...from Kumbokon to be
a pan of the funfair.

1029
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:09,611
So, how can we start the funfair,
it has become a big question now.

1030
01:25:09,705 --> 01:25:12,185
Let's take them in chariot.
Wham else can we do?

1031
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,617
We do that every year.
Let's go on elephants' this year.

1032
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:20,285
Shut up. Do you think it is easy to
get elephants and take a ride on them.

1033
01:25:23,352 --> 01:25:25,491
Hey, keep quiet.

1034
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:30,497
Tell me something,
everyone is present here.

1035
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,134
...where is our Vikrama?

1036
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,692
Who are you?
- I am a tiger.

1037
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:04,399
I have come here to save the tiger,
vehicle of our village god..

1038
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,732
...l am the tiger of
Vikramathina village

1039
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:11,336
It is our god.
I am telling you, please go away.

1040
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:15,214
Hey Mangya, we don't spare
the wild tiger in the jungle.

1041
01:26:15,304 --> 01:26:17,147
...how can we spare this village tiger?

1042
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:21,343
Even I don't spare
the wild pigs like you

1043
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:25,722
I kill them. - Why are
you listening to him? Kill him!

1044
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:24,540
"He is a great warrior of this world."

1045
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,746
<i>“He is very WWW'</i>

1046
01:27:27,943 --> 01:27:31,652
"He is very brave and courageous."

1047
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:35,285
"It is him! It is him!"

1048
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:16,301
"He is a great warrior of this world."

1049
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,600
<i>“He is very WWW'</i>

1050
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:23,436
"He is very brave and courageous."

1051
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:26,638
"It's him It's him!"

1052
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:29,807
"He is a great warrior of this world."

1053
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:33,285
<i>“He is very WWW'</i>

1054
01:28:33,509 --> 01:28:36,683
"He is very brave and courageous."

1055
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,555
"It is him! It is him!"

1056
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:47,031
Hey Vikrama, why are you
making these men pull the can?

1057
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,996
Who are they? They look like tribals

1058
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:52,839
Ranganna, they belong to the tribe.

1059
01:28:52,928 --> 01:28:55,568
So, I brought them here to meet you.

1060
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:57,710
Punish them the way you like.

1061
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:01,939
What wrong have they
done for me to punish them?

1062
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:06,782
We start the funfair of our
village only when the tiger growls.

1063
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,481
...they wanted to kill that tiger.

1064
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:13,720
I didn't let them do that. I fought
with them and brought them to you.

1065
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:19,690
Very good, my son. Very good.

1066
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:24,831
We were following our culture from age.

1067
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:28,734
...not only me,
you've saved the entire village.

1068
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:32,443
Everyone say, glory to victorious
Vikrama! - Glory.. - Hey..

1069
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,413
Glory to victorious Vikrama!
- Glory to him! - Hey, stop it.

1070
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,413
Don't sing praises about me.

1071
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:40,783
Ranganna taught us to wrestle
and save ourselves from any trouble.

1072
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:41,911
You should praise him

1073
01:29:42,611 --> 01:29:44,955
They've done such a heinous work..

1074
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:48,824
...so they have to pull the
chariot of Lord Vikrameshwara

1075
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:50,961
I am giving them this punishment.

1076
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,959
Hail Lord Vikrameshwara! - Hail!

1077
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:58,004
Hail Lord Vikrameshwara! - Hail!

1078
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,098
Hail Lord Vikrameshwara! - Hail!

1079
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:39,404
"Gowri. Gowri. Gowri. Gowri."

1080
01:30:42,204 --> 01:30:46,675
"Gowri listen,
my heart is filled with your thoughts."

1081
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:53,586
"I am the man who can
stand in front of a tiger."

1082
01:30:53,682 --> 01:30:56,959
"Don't know why,
but I fear in front of you."

1083
01:30:57,052 --> 01:31:00,727
"I have seen a beautiful face"

1084
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:04,497
"I have seen Gowri."

1085
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:08,063
"He is the creator of the world."

1086
01:31:08,163 --> 01:31:11,804
"Lord, You are our friend."

1087
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:16,007
"Gowri. Gowri. Gowri. Gowri."

1088
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:23,748
"Gowri listen,
my heart is filled with your thoughts."

1089
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:52,247
"Don't see me stealthily.
Gowri says this to Lord Shiva"

1090
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:59,982
"Lord Shiva who rules three worlds,
but don't know why He fears a flower."

1091
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:07,023
"Gowri, don't be so arrogant.
Kailash is empty without you."

1092
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:14,266
"Life without you
is like a barren land."

1093
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:21,879
"I have seen Shiva's games
I have seen His dance."

1094
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:29,218
"You've smeared Your body with ashes
You love to dance."

1095
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:32,045
"You have drums in one hand."

1096
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:35,849
"Bunch ofjasmine flowers in one hand."

1097
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:39,357
"Lord Shiva came crossing
thousands of mountains.

1098
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:43,255
...carrying Goddess Gowri on his head."

1099
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:50,603
"It was Nandi who spread
the message to everyone"

1100
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:54,602
"Gowri's shyness is
Lord Shiva's anklets."

1101
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:57,734
"Nandi was Lord's companion."

1102
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:04,884
"I saw Lord Shiva's
musical instruments."

1103
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:12,157
"The surprise which unites two hearts."

1104
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:20,666
"Goddess, you are the
life-partner of Lord Jagadeesha"

1105
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:30,739
Kulkarni, what was happening there?

1106
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:33,642
Sir, it is Vikrameshwara festival, sir.

1107
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:36,648
It's a very holy place.
The people are all coming.

1108
01:34:36,738 --> 01:34:41,016
They worship and they
are dancing and enjoying.

1109
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:44,147
That's called the place
is Vikramamhina - Good.

1110
01:34:58,193 --> 01:34:59,695
Hello ladies

1111
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:01,864
Sir..

1112
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:04,771
...you are putting tax
on all the villages in India

1113
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:09,012
Why aren't you putting
tax on Vikramamhina? Why, sir?

1114
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:13,217
I don't want to waste my money, time.

1115
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:15,948
...and energy in the useless land.

1116
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:17,782
Waste land.

1117
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,788
So, no need of tax

1118
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:31,333
That's the reason no one knows
about the struggle for independence

1119
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:23,955
You idiot,
you hold my hand when no one is around.

1120
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:26,125
If you have guts,
hold my hand in front of everyone

1121
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:27,284
Hey, silly gm.

1122
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:29,055
Had I not hold your hand now..

1123
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:33,098
...you wouldn't be alive to hold my hand,
as you were to fall in water.

1124
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:36,934
You know I come here every day,
then why did you get scared?

1125
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:40,296
I didn't get scared seeing you.
I slipped.

1126
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:42,968
Are you a tiger for
me to get scared from you?

1127
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:46,805
I saved the tiger of our village god,
so I am also atigen

1128
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:49,478
You saved tiger, god's vehicle..

1129
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:53,883
...can't you go to my father
and tell him that you love me?

1130
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:56,188
Ifl wish, I will hold your hand.

1131
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:58,985
...drag you in front of your father
and tell him, hey..

1132
01:36:59,214 --> 01:37:02,127
...marry your daughter to me. That's it!

1133
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:07,825
Father..

1134
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:19,809
I was watching him in the funfair.

1135
01:37:19,901 --> 01:37:22,142
Vikrama was staring at your daughter:

1136
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:25,477
I was thinking what were his intentions

1137
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:28,146
Hey, you don't think too much

1138
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:30,223
I should be the one who should think.

1139
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:33,121
Because he saw my daughter'.

1140
01:37:34,616 --> 01:37:39,065
Ranganna, think about it
and punish Vikrama the way you wish.

1141
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:41,191
My stomach is upset.
I will go to the river banks.

1142
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:44,036
In front of all of you..

1143
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,469
...l am punishing them.

1144
01:37:47,528 --> 01:37:52,602
...Vikrama should lead all
his life with this hooligan.

1145
01:37:54,269 --> 01:37:56,408
I'll get them married in three days

1146
01:38:01,142 --> 01:38:02,314
Father..

1147
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:06,953
You can't find a better groom than him.

1148
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:13,893
Ranganna, you are not only
my guru who taught me wrestling"

1149
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:17,503
"but you were a father to this orphan.

1150
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:19,868
...and now you are becoming
my father-in-law.

1151
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:27,374
Your heart is bigger than this village

1152
01:38:30,705 --> 01:38:34,050
I am not great.
It is all by God's grace.

1153
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:53,161
Mr. Commissioner, I have collected
all the reports of the soil testing..

1154
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:55,138
...from your area of administration.

1155
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:57,610
Well Mr. Scientist, thank you.

1156
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:01,104
I've done all the arrangements
for you to send to the headquarters.

1157
01:39:01,269 --> 01:39:03,044
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1158
01:39:05,006 --> 01:39:08,044
Glory to Gandhi!
- Hail India

1159
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:11,146
Glory to Gandhi!
- Hail India

1160
01:39:11,245 --> 01:39:13,987
Glory to Gandhi!
- Hail India

1161
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:10,138
Take me to that village
- Okay, sir.

1162
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:15,647
Ranganna, greetings.
- Everyone have food before you leave.

1163
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:18,054
Don't leave without eating.
- Okay, Ranganna -Okay.

1164
01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:21,650
You both are just married.
So, don't go out for two days.

1165
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,460
Who is he?

1166
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:32,027
Splendid, I say.
It seems to be a wedding.

1167
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:35,207
Do you mind if I take a photograph?

1168
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:38,676
What is he saying? - He wants
to take a photo. Everyone come here

1169
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:44,708
Thank you.
I wish you have a happy married life.

1170
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:10,305
I haven't tested the
soil of this village.

1171
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:49,212
Oh, you are feeling shy?
What do we do now?

1172
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,591
Oh my god.

1173
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,794
Mr. Commissioner! Mr. Commissioner!

1174
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,696
I have some really strange news.

1175
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:46,462
Sir, the soil we tested
in village of Vikramamhina.

1176
01:42:46,561 --> 01:42:49,872
...is completely one hundred
percent Uranium, sir.

1177
01:42:49,964 --> 01:42:51,773
Uranium?
- Yes, sir.

1178
01:42:51,866 --> 01:42:54,608
Of the kind we need
to make atomic bomb.

1179
01:42:54,702 --> 01:42:58,741
Like the United States dropped
on Hiroshima in 1945, sir.

1180
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,284
I think you understand
the importance, sir.

1181
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:07,288
That's a news
Please have a seat, Mr. Scientist.

1182
01:43:07,382 --> 01:43:08,588
Thank you, sir.

1183
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:14,466
Sir, we must inform the governor
of the state immediately, sir.

1184
01:43:14,656 --> 01:43:19,264
This could be a huge economic importance
to His Majesty's government, sir.

1185
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,840
Trust me sir,
if you would just take a look, sir.

And I don't want the
governor to know about this.

1188
01:43:30,905 --> 01:43:33,647

I mean, you should vacate this village.

1197
01:44:56,391 --> 01:45:02,342
In this British rule, the company is..

Ranganna, did you now realize?

1202
01:45:21,849 --> 01:45:24,693
I was telling you constantly.

1203
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:27,332
"But no one.. no one listened to me

1204
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:30,334

01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,541
What is this?

1208
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:44,882
This is our village

1209
01:45:45,373 --> 01:45:47,683
We live here from ages.

1210
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:49,947
Our god is here

1211
01:45:50,044 --> 01:45:51,682
You were not here all these years.

1212
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:54,658
Now who are you to tell us
to vacate the village?

1213
01:45:57,117 --> 01:46:01,065
Hey, I will chop everyone to pieces.

1214
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:04,993
Go away from here! You bloody idiots!

1215

What is he saying?
- He said..

1217
01:46:12,133 --> 01:46:15,376
...you enter the village,
take his permission.

1218
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:18,473
And you are a red mouth dog.

01:46:18,572 --> 01:46:21,712
Your skin is very white,
like leukoderma

01:46:21,809 --> 01:46:24,016
And he is talking about
your mother relation, sir.

1221

Ranganna!

1222
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:42,797
Father?

<i>'</i> No!

1229

Ranganna

1230
01:48:48,923 --> 01:48:50,903
Officer is important. Let's go.

1231
01:48:56,864 --> 01:49:00,607

Please be careful. Take proper rest.
I will see you soon - Thank you.

1233
01:49:13,147 --> 01:49:14,751
Good night.

1234
01:49:18,085 --> 01:49:21,999
Sir, everyone in that village is
an expert wrestler".

1235
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:24,763
"Stick fighter and sword fighter.

1236
01:49:24,959 --> 01:49:26,961
We can't confront them, sir.

1237
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:29,302
They know all types of fighting, sir.

1238
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:33,100
We can't fight in front side, sir.
We go back.

1239
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:38,942
How dare you say this?
They have to leave the village!

1240
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,616
It belongs to me

1241
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:47,725
Send the information to the headquarters
and call for extra force, now!

1242
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:09,645
They killed our village chief Ranganna,
we shouldn't fight them

1243
01:50:09,804 --> 01:50:12,375
I think it is better that we
all leave this place and save our lives

1244
01:50:12,673 --> 01:50:16,621
Hey, we got scared and have
handed over our country to them.

1245
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:19,188
I told you earlier and
will tell you the same..

1246
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,626
...if you don't listen to me,
you'll face problems in future.

1247
01:50:23,884 --> 01:50:26,262
Ranganna died because
he didn't listen to me

1248
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:29,691
At least now, you try to understand.

1249
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:31,870
There's still time.

1250
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:36,335
...we will have to save our village

1251
01:50:36,864 --> 01:50:40,937
I will protect you from them.
The teachings of Ranganna will save us

1252
01:50:41,869 --> 01:50:44,748
Let them come.

1253
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,787

Is there anyone?
- I don't see anyone here

1261

1262
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:07,888
Nobody is here.

1263

You can calm down. -Yes.

02:02:46,793 --> 02:02:50,104
'They are wasting time and doing drama'

1351
02:02:50,563 --> 02:02:53,567
'If they can't run this state, then they
should sit in their houses quietly.'

1352
02:02:54,401 --> 02:02:56,472
'Really, it is one of
the worst irresponsible.

1353
02:02:56,569 --> 02:02:57,673
"Government I have ever seen.'

1354
02:02:57,771 --> 02:02:59,773
'Shame on your government.
Shame on politics'

1355
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,820
'They say,
they don't know Vikramathina.

1356
02:03:01,908 --> 02:03:03,683
...tomorrow they may say,
they don't know where we live.'

1357
02:03:03,777 --> 02:03:07,884
'Sir, many Kannadigas have
lost their lives for freedom.'

1358
02:03:08,048 --> 02:03:09,686
'They are still
sacrificing their lives.'

1359
02:03:09,783 --> 02:03:12,593
'People of Karnataka say
that you and your government".

1360
02:03:12,686 --> 02:03:15,599
...is responsible for all these deaths.'

1361
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:17,498
'What answer do you have for them?'

1362
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:22,039
'The entire world is
looking upon Karnataka now.'

1363
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:26,543
'Look, end this program right away.
- One minute, chief minister.'

1364
02:03:28,034 --> 02:03:31,174
'Viewers, this was the
answer of our chief minister.'

1365
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:34,680
Come, let's leave. - 'Down!
Down! - Down with the chief minister!'

1366
02:03:34,741 --> 02:03:37,779
'Down! Down!
- Down with the chief minister!' - Move.

1367
02:03:58,898 --> 02:04:03,608
Sir, you asked me to meet you urgently.

1368
02:04:05,872 --> 02:04:13,848
When you told me about Vikramathina,
I insulted you and mocked at you.

1369
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:17,118
Running a government.

1370
02:04:17,584 --> 02:04:21,691
...is not a child's play
as the politicians think"

1371
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:28,430
...this Vikramathirta incident should be
like a lesson to the decision I take now.

1372
02:04:29,563 --> 02:04:34,911
So, I have come to a conclusion.

1373
02:04:35,835 --> 02:04:37,109
Sir, what is it?

1374
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:42,542
'Getting justice for Vikramamhina.

1375
02:04:42,642 --> 02:04:45,589
...is our government's first aim'

1376
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:57,529
One minute, excuse me.

1377
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,130
Hello, Vikram?

1378
02:05:00,226 --> 02:05:01,762
Sir?
- Did you hear the news?

1379
02:05:01,861 --> 02:05:04,774
Sir, until now Vikramthina
was my profession

1380
02:05:05,164 --> 02:05:08,543
But now, it has become personal.
- I have faith on you..

1381

of fulling hope of 7 corer Kannadigas.

02:08:43,883 --> 02:08:46,022
Sir, this is my investigation report.
- Sit down

1415
02:08:46,919 --> 02:08:48,193
Thank you, sir.

1416
02:08:49,155 --> 02:08:53,695
When I enquired everyone,
I got information about one man.

1417
02:08:53,793 --> 02:08:57,741
It is him. This one man
is ruling over Vikramamhina

1418
02:08:58,431 --> 02:09:01,901
He was getting support
from Maharashtrds MLA, Kulkarni.

1419
02:09:02,001 --> 02:09:03,446
But he is absconding.

1420
02:09:03,536 --> 02:09:09,111
The soil that we took from
Vikramathirta contains 48.008 PPM.

1421
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:11,449
I mean, C-class Uranium, sir.

1422
02:09:11,544 --> 02:09:15,185
He was doing mining of this
C-class Uranium through open class.

1423
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:18,885
He used to shift that
sand to the Goa port.

1424
02:09:18,985 --> 02:09:22,125
...and contaminate it
with iron and charcoal..

1425
02:09:22,321 --> 02:09:24,494
...and export it directly
to the Middle East.

1426
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:28,499
They sold the Uranium from our
country to International terrorists..

1427
02:09:28,795 --> 02:09:31,867
...and plan to explode
atomic bomb on our country.

1428
02:09:31,965 --> 02:09:33,273
Oh my god.

1429
02:09:33,366 --> 02:09:36,142
In fact, he is the one who
planted bombs in Vikramathirta.

1430
02:09:36,236 --> 02:09:40,184
Vikram, he did so much injustice to us
Can't we do anything to him?

1431
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,146
Goddess Chamundeshwari is
blessing all the Kannadigas, sir.

1432
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:46,121
He is in our country now.

1433
02:09:46,212 --> 02:09:48,920
I have blocked his visa and passport.

1434
02:09:49,015 --> 02:09:52,827
Shocking is that I even
know about his whereabouts.

1435
02:09:52,919 --> 02:09:54,796
Then go ahead. Arrest him

1436
02:09:55,154 --> 02:09:56,827
Sir, lam going to kill him

1437
02:09:57,256 --> 02:09:58,929
Vikram!
- Please, sir.

1438
02:09:59,259 --> 02:10:01,261
He and the people of Karnamaka
who supported him in this heinous act.

1439
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:04,865
...l've made a special team to nab them

1440
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:07,833
Sir, if not, with the money power".

1441
02:10:08,034 --> 02:10:11,106
...he will leave this country and
we won't be able to do anything to him.

1442
02:10:11,537 --> 02:10:13,175
Please sir, please.

1443
02:10:18,044 --> 02:10:19,318
Hi, officers

1444
02:10:21,147 --> 02:10:23,127
Sorry, I wish to address you..

1445
02:10:23,216 --> 02:10:26,390
...as friends and brothers rather
than calling you as officers.

1446
02:10:26,986 --> 02:10:30,058
Because, the work we are going
to do is to safeguard.

1447
02:10:30,156 --> 02:10:33,467
...our country, our state, and our home.

1448
02:10:33,927 --> 02:10:37,204
Here, we have to be like
brothers with each other.

1449
02:10:37,297 --> 02:10:40,005
You all know what our aim is.

1450
02:10:40,266 --> 02:10:42,974
Yes sir, we've studied the
complete records given by you.

1451
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:44,306
Good.

1452
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:49,045
Oh no!

1453
02:11:52,539 --> 02:11:53,950
Oh no!

1454
02:12:01,381 --> 02:12:03,588
Oh, you came to catch me.

1455
02:12:05,318 --> 02:12:07,161
Good. Very, very good.

1456
02:12:07,687 --> 02:12:11,965
I will destroy your
Vikramamhina completely

1457
02:12:15,194 --> 02:12:16,673
You can't catch me.

1458
02:12:16,962 --> 02:12:18,964
It's a challenge for you to stop me.

1459
02:12:20,433 --> 02:12:22,606
Now, listen to me carefully.

1460
02:12:23,436 --> 02:12:27,407
The team that you
came to arrest me with..

1461
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:30,084
...one of them is not from your team.

1462
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:31,988
Bye-bye.

1463
02:12:58,571 --> 02:13:01,643
'Here, we have to be like
brothers with each other.'

1464
02:14:04,737 --> 02:14:09,345
Sir, 360 degree, until where you see,
we are surrounded by our people.

1465
02:14:09,542 --> 02:14:11,021
\Mth weapons

1466
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:15,415
Sir, the people who say
Karnataka belongs to them.

1467
02:14:15,748 --> 02:14:19,093
...we will ruin them and go away.

1468
02:14:19,185 --> 02:14:21,324
We are safe, sir. No problem.

1469
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:24,458
Kulkarni, I don't know what you'll do..

1470
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:28,263
...but all I want is to load
all the soil by today into the ship.

1471
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:31,405
And listen,
the ship has to start from Goa.

1472
02:14:31,497 --> 02:14:33,238
...before tomorrow evening

1473
02:14:33,733 --> 02:14:37,704
And I don't want any disturbance
in my plan. Understand?

1474
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:45,646
Disturbance? Sir, Vikram who disturbed
us, we already killed him, sir.

1475
02:14:46,646 --> 02:14:52,221
Sir, if he is alive
with 5-10% life in him.

1476
02:14:52,585 --> 02:14:58,126

he has to confront my people..
