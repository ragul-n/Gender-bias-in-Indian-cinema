00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:45,069
You only read about him.

178
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,834
Just in case, he returns
you will propose him for marriage.

179
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,667
What's your problem?

180
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,469
We are your well-wishen.

181
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,100
You're unworthy.

182
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,068
Stop quarrelling.

183
00:13:57,132 --> 00:13:59,734
Jogi fled to Dubai.

184
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,569
Read the paper. - Read it.

185
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,701
Father, this is what
l was telling her.

186
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,100
Get back to work.

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,636
Jogi!

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,335
Uncle, this is what we get in return.

190
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,200
You put me in trouble.

191
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:21,867
He's criminal.

192
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:27,936
He said his mother always
advised him to earn his own living..

193
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,634
..and not to cheat on people.

194
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:35,503
But he went to Dubai
by cheating on all of us.

195
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:41,971
We used to save his life
putting our lives at stake.

196
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:45,368
Did his mother teach him
how to cheat on people?

197
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,734
He ruined me and my family.

198
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,900
He will get ruined.

199
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,001

when my son used to..

..saying l'm an irresponsible
father..

..who couldn't get
his son admiRed in school.

204
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,102
ls this what we deserve
in return for our favon?

205
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,202
He has left us with no choice.

206
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,867
He made our lives miserable, uncle.

207
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:19,099
He's not a human being.

208
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,900
He's a cannibal.

209
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,468
''Hail lord Shiva.''

210
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,901

''Hail lord Shiva.''

213
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,935
''Hail lord Shiva.''

214
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,333
Why did you scream?

215
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:39,367
Oh my God.

216
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,068
This sage has come all
the way from the Himalayas.

Bring coconut.

218
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:44,699

We are fortunate to
seek your blessings.

222
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,233
My friends looked for him..

223
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,035
..in most of the places of Mumbai.

224
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,301

''We looked for you,
but couldn't find you.''

234

A youthful girl lives in this house,
but you come wearing short clothes.

238
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:33,536
Dignified people like us will
be put to shame for employing you.

239
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,900
l did no wrong.

240

Don't say a word.

He's a cunning man.

242

You are such an irresponsible man.

246

You are mistaken.

Father, no. Don't send him.

He will misguide them.

00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:35,036
He's not trustworthy. Don't send him..

Madam..

lf we take right turn we
will have to travel 15 kms extra.

313
00:19:57,532 --> 00:19:58,900
Never mind.

l don't mind starting

You..

317
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,834
The driver didn't hear him abuse..

318
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,134
..else he would've
killed your brother.

319
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:09,765
Why?

320
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,701
No one would tolerate abuses.

321
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:15,969
This is how we talk in our place.

322
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:20,102
But in our place the
one who abuses gets killed.

323
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,900
You talk vey nicely.

324
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:26,135
l'm the most dignified
man in this village.

325
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,201

Go ahead.

329
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:41,399
He's so orthodox.

330
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,301
Son-in-law,
do you have more relatives coming?

331
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:48,036
Only nine of them, it is a ritual.

332
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:52,603
No maRer what, you will
not find even one extra person.

333
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,701
Son-in-law seems
to be the man of ethics.

334
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,033
Go on. - You're right.

335
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,701
You heard him? - He did.

336
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,268
Who is this fool?

337
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:03,633
l don't know him, do you?

338
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:04,934
He's the groom.

339
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,834
Why did he come here?

340
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,134
He's the one geRing married to Vidya.

341
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:13,700
Vidya is a fool.

342
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:14,466
You're right.

343
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:17,268
She's a Pallande (useless).

344
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:20,902
let's run away.
- What happened?

345
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,201
Turn around.
- That's the fact.

346
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,801
He always brings trouble to us.

347
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:31,402
''What do l do now?''

348
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,867
Why are you starring at me?

349
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,267
Are you blind? Help me.

350
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:39,737
Here l go. You're in trouble.

351
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,902
'Pallande'.
Dear, l don't know the meaning of it.

352
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,834
l guess people in South
Karnataka use this word.

353
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,467
l'm not sure.

354
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:52,035
You need to first know
which language is it.

355
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:56,569
My brother is an expert in horoscopes.

356
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,901
l lost the mood for
reading the horoscope.

357
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:11,176
But the part which is
of no use is called 'Pallande'.

358
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:14,868
lt is only used to to_h fire.

359
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,635
You guys are so irresponsible.

360
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,900
Where is that idiot?

361
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:21,900
What happened?

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,469
My fingen are aching
milking the cows.

363
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:26,034
You will understand only if you do it.

364
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:27,266
Get away.

365
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:28,399
Where is Busa?

366
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:31,936
l'm a vey orthodox person.
leave me alone.

367
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:34,067
ldiot. Where is he?

368
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:37,066
l will not work until
he leaves the house.

369
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,702
lf l rely on you
guys l will be done for.

370
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,735
Wait. - What is it?

371
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:52,439
You told the groom that
l was a useless girl. How dare you?

372
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:53,266
Don't say that.

373
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:54,867
Shut up.
- l will not.

374
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,003
l don't believe in auspicious
or inauspicious periods.

375
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:06,572
He follows rules for
evey little thing he does.

376
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,402
He will not let you even scratch
your body during inauspicious period.

377
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,668
Do you wish to mary such a guy?

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,067
l will mary him.

379
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:16,500
l will make him see sense.

380
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,803
l will also tell him that
nothing is greater than love.

381
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,532
l see.

382
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,702
A drunkard can give up drinking.

383
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:28,102
A gamble can give up gambling.

384
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,269
Even a criminal can reform himself.

385
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:34,567
But the one who
believes in horoscopes..

386
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:37,234
..will never see sense. Remember that.

387
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,702
lf he doesn't listen to me..

388
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,469
..my name is not Vidya Gokule.

389
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,800
Alright.

390
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,866
l knew it.

391
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:57,702
lf l'd not hold you,
you would've fallen down.

392
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,268
As per the horoscope
a girl should wear flowen..

393
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,967
..on the right side of her tresses.

394
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:04,766
But you've wore it on the left side.

395
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,867
That's why you were
about to fall down.

396
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:12,003
lf you had fallen down,
you wouldn't have got up forever.

397
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:14,534
Moreover, it is inauspicious period.

398
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:17,935
Wear the flowen on the
right side of the tresses.

399
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,633

00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:35,701

My daughter is looking
like Goddess lakshmi today.

464
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:30,700
Take out this ring.

465
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,035
l'm telling you.
Don't you understand me?

Fo_et about me taking out this ring..

467
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,534
..because it is my mother's ring.

468
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:44,870
Your star is moon.
That means Saturn. That is a gem.

469
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,368
lf you wear a green gem stone ring,
you'll get ruined.

470
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:51,101
My star is Guru. That means Pluto.

471
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:55,503
The Saturn and the
Pluto can't stay together.

472
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:59,169
lf we have gold and
green stone between us..

473
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,933
..we'll get ruined.

474
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,334
Take out that ring first.

475
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,000
Why will we get ruined
if we wonhip God?

476
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:05,733
lsn't a mother considered as Goddess?

477
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,834
l'm wearing this
ring as her memorabilia.

478
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,133
l won't take it out and that's final.

479
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:13,435
Darn it. Do you think l have
any enmity towards your mother?

480
00:30:13,532 --> 00:30:14,399
Son-in-law.

481
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:15,867
Green is inauspicious.

482
00:30:16,332 --> 00:30:20,436
We call a woman as wife who
knows about customs and traditions.

483
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,867
Wife should be like
Goddess lakshmi to us.

484
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:27,002
The girls who act like Goddess Chandi,
can't enter my house.

485
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,101
My mother has taught
me all these things.

486
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:32,568
My grandmother taught
this to my mother.

487
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,200
This is a tradition
in our family. - Okay.

488
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,701
l'll tell her.
- Don't we have to follow the elders?

489
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:41,703
Your mother is in your breaths,
in your eyes..

490
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:45,603
..in your drop of blood.

491
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:50,604
Why do you have to feel
bad for such petty maRer?

492
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:55,637
Your mother had always
wished to see you happy.

493
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:59,135
Now it is time to fulfill her wish.

494
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:07,940
Dear, please take that ring out.
Take that ring out. Please.

495
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:14,668
I I I I
Fo_et about the past.

496
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:20,134
''Burn all your desires.''

497
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:27,904
''You have to sacrifice
for your husband.''

498
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:30,434
I I I I
Fo_et it.

499
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,068
I I I I
Fo_et it.

500
00:31:33,165 --> 00:31:35,133
Hey, come to me.
It is not your mother.

501
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,968
Dear, come to me.
It is not your mother.

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,501
Oh..

503
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,035
l told you so many times
that it is not your mother..

504
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:48,668
..you recognized your mother
and straight went to her.

505
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,468
People say you can't speak.
You don't have sense.

506
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,601
lf l send you in a group of cows..

507
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,534
..you go to your mother straight.

508
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,868
lt is called as relationship.

509
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:03,136
look at us.. for our selfishness
and to fill our stomachs..

510
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:09,738
..we talk about customs and traditions
and sever so many relationships.

511
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,402
You are much better than
the people who can talk.

512
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:15,600
lsn't it?

513
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,600
lt is vey easy to talk about others.

514
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:22,835
lf you come into my shoes
and go through my pain..

515
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:25,534
..only then,
you'll really know what my pain is.

516
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,633
Why are you discussing
your problems with me?

517
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,834
You should've told your mother.

518
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,500
Weren't you angy then?

519
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:37,035
That's the reason l said,
animals are far better than humans.

520
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:38,366
Know that..

521
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:52,101
''A handsome lad came
from Sundernagar.''

522
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:54,466
I I I I
He's vey unique.

523
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,434
''He's come. He's a cheat.''

524
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,600
Sir, why are you
staring at me like that?

525
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,300
l've kept the hay there.

526
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,900
l've kept the cow food there.

527
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:09,366
l've changed the place of the dustbin.

528
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,000
But you are watching me anger..

529
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:12,065

You're a scholar.
You can do black magic..

..and you'll know it.

535
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:36,804
Hey.. you've come from
the South and are hiding here.

536
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,773
When you were in the south..
you were a terror for eveyone.

537
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,936
Sir.. l've not come
from the south or north.

538
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:49,834
Our village is surrounded
with forest all around.

539
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:51,667
l've come from Beddhalli.

540
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:54,869
Fool, is there any place in the world,

You are absolutely right.
- Hey.

545
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,835
You would've seen when his
cutout was put up in Bangalore.

546
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,134
When did they put a cutout?

547
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,767
When 'Haalu Jenu'
picture was released.

548
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:26,034
Get going, you idiot. Go away.

Son-in-law,

558
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,034
You are feeding milk

00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:21,434
Please, somebody save
me or he'll kill me.

563
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,201
Somebody please save me.
Somebody open the door.

Doctor!

579
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,300
Somebody please come here.

580
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,000
What happened to him?
- Come on, let's go.

581
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:10,169
Hey, what is this? - Doctor,
some rowdies have aRacked him.

582
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:11,600
Please, check him up.

583
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,234
Please, sir. - Have you
filed a complaint in the police?

584
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,034
Sir, actually..
- Are you out of your mind?

585
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,434
Don't you know, you shouldn't admit
anyone without lodging a complaint?

586
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:21,469
Sir, do you know who he is?
He's renowned rowdy of Bangalore.

587
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,700
This is his man.

588
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:24,399
Do the first-aid first.
l'll operate upon him only when..

589
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:25,666
..the FIR has been filed.

590
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:28,502
Doctor.. the police
will come here for sure.

591
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:31,500
But once if he dies,
he can't come to life again.

592
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:32,767
Please, check him up. Come with me.

593
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,901
Get lost, l say!
Who do you think l am?

594
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:39,001
Do you think l'm a hoodlum
who kills people for money?

595
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:44,003
Do you think l'm a drunkard
who drinks and troubles the family?

596
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:47,835
You're a third grade
rowdy who kills people..

597
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,834
..with a 12 inch dagger in your hand.

598
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:52,233
You are talking to
me about giving life?

599
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,836
I I I I
Jogi.

600
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,701
l've worked for 12
yean in Red Cross center.

601
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:01,500
l don't have to listen
to a lecture given by..

602
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,533
..a goon like you.

603
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:03,932
Get lost, l say!

604
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:08,733
What are you watching?

605
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,333
Do you think he's a freedom fighter?

606
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:14,101
lt is because of your fear
that these people multiply fast..

607
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,499
..and are ruining the system.

608
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,968
lf you would've thrashed
them with your slippers..

609
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:21,267
..these pests wouldn't
have crawled till the hospital.

610
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,233
Get back to your work eveyone.

611
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:26,001
''Amongst the people who take lives..''

612
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,901
''They've fo_otten God.''

613
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:37,469
''Jogi, who'll care for you?''

614
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:41,669
''A good man like
you cannot live here.''

615
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,234
Hello, boss. Siddhu, the boss is here.
Eveyone get up.

616
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:43,899
Get up.

617
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:49,933
Come on. Finally, you've come.

618
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,601
Boss, where had you been?

619
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,369
Hey! Boss,
they are from the transport.

620
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,133
l've told them to pay us Rs. 5 lakhs.

621
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,601
Hello, sir.
- All the builden have compromised.

622
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,533
Hello, sir.

623
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:02,301
lets sync in Rs. 5 lakhs.

624
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:04,166
Boss, let's not spare
anyone in Bangalore.

625
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:06,934
There are many places like
gambling clubs, mari)uana dealen..

626
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,368
..drugs, disco clubs,
we can extort money from.

627
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,032
Hey!

628
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,567
Move aside!

629
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:19,334
Uncle, let them not
give me a single penny.

630
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,467
Tell them to take back their money.

631
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:23,500
lf they don't do so,
l'll lose my temper. - Okay.

632
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:26,734
Hey, eveyone go away. Come on, move.

633
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,900
Go away from here.

634
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,034
Boss, why did you do this?

635
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:39,334
lt is said that if a horse
befriends hay, what will it eat?

636
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:41,467
listen here,
did we tell you to kill anyone?

637
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,034
Did we tell you to hold the dagger?

638
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:44,600
Boss, you are a don. A don.

639
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,369
Sit in one place and
)ust deal with people.

640
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,667
You'll get your token automatically.

641
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:50,833
l don't want anything!

642
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:53,468
You don't want it, but we want.

643
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:57,102
Police has tagged us rowdies
and is waiting to kill us.

644
00:39:57,265 --> 00:39:58,899
We have to live and die here only.

645
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,668
You have to go to JC and get released.

646
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,134
We thought of making
some money from that..

647
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:07,401
You don't have any of
your relatives to cy for you.

648
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:10,969
l have a whole family to run
and my parents are dependent on me.

649
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:13,934
Boss, l want to live.
Understand? - Hey Bhukka!

650
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:18,403
Did l say that l'm a don
and did l tell you to follow me?

651
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,467
Had l ever promised you
that l'll take care of you all?

652
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:22,668
Get lost! Go and earn money younelf!

653
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:25,101
Oh, you've changed completely now.

654
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,702
Remember that we've been
protecting you from all these yean.

655
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:32,269
Hey, Singh!
No one can save anyone's life.

656
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,167
What is written in
his destiny will happen.

657
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,167
Yes, if you had problems,
like we do, you would've..

658
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:38,566
..understood our problems.

659
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:41,001
Can we kill the whole village
)ust because we have problems?

660
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,901
Hey, my mother always
used to tell me..

661
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:47,268
.. 'son, earn money and live
your life and not by begging# 

662
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:50,602
l'm not a leader to
keep you as my associates.

663
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,467
Please, don't! Don't!

664
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:54,633
l don't want to do a )ob like this.

665
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,500
Go away! Earn a living
for younelf! Go away!

666
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,599
We will go.

667
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:01,799
let me see for how long you will..

668
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:03,434
..stay away from us.

669
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:05,000
lt is not me..

670
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:06,333
..but you who don't value my life.

671
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:07,733
Okay.

672
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,800
Well..

673
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,236
..you've disappointed us today.
You go and live your life.

674
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:13,533
Come on, let's go.

675
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:15,734
let's see how many days
he survives with this old man.

676
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:16,566
let's go.

677
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:21,335
''Birth is alms to you.''

678
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:25,502
''life is punishment for you.''

679
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:31,838
''This is the destiny
written by lord Brahma.''

680
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:38,671
''These people are eating my flesh,
what do l do?''

681
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:45,138
''How do l live on this earth,
tell me?''

682
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:50,835
Take this, son. Kill me,
but don't stare at me like this.

683
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:54,935
Son, Allah has not made
me so strong to endure your looks.

684
00:41:55,132 --> 00:41:56,700
Allah has not made me so strong.

685
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:00,869
Bhubhayya, you've ruined me.

686
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:03,667
You've ruined me.

687
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,169
Did you hear what all they told me?

688
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,235
Their life is important for them.

689
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:19,001
Who do l share my pain with?

690
00:42:21,032 --> 00:42:22,666
Who do l have, Bhubhayya?

691
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:26,833
That day what did you tell me?

692
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:34,772
You said, hold this dagger,
you'll get your mother.

693
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:37,767
Did l get her?

694

l watched people putting him to shame.

1034
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:46,470
Bhubhayya, if you were
alive he would've been powerFul.

1035
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:50,034
You would've bailed him out.

1036
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:53,267
His life is filled with sins..

1037
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:55,500
..and God granted you death.

1038
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:02,803
Now, he has to remain in )ail.

1039
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:06,801
No one will care about him.

1040
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:11,535
Sir, you filed a case
against the man who is..

1041
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:16,636
..hardworking, innocent and loyal.

1042
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,267
lsn't it unfair?

1043
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:24,302
He worked in my house
for three yean in Mumbai.

1044
01:07:24,598 --> 01:07:27,167
He would never accept extra money.

1045
01:07:27,231 --> 01:07:32,135
He used to lead an ordinay life.

1046
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,534
How is it possible for a person
like him to make so much money?

1047
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:37,799
Then who committed these crimes?

1048
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:40,466
Was it you or hired
someone to do them?

1049
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:46,867
The landlords, the builden..

1050
01:07:47,365 --> 01:07:49,934
..vendon on the street,
common people..

1051
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:52,533
..peon, the police commissioner..

1052
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:56,401
..many innocents lost their lives.

1053
01:07:56,699 --> 01:07:59,001
Many families were ruined.

1054
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:01,966
The guilt should be punished.

1055
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:04,399
l believe in papen.

1056
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:06,832
Don't waste my time.

1057
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:09,133
Papers are lifeless, sir.

1058
01:08:09,231 --> 01:08:11,032
lt is man who wrote on them.

1059
01:08:11,098 --> 01:08:13,066
Come with me and have a look..

1060
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,333
..you will know how innocent he is.

1061
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:17,566
Sir, please. For once..

1062
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,001
Sir, please listen to me.

1063
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,868
You want to get an innocent
punished by filing cases against him.

1064
01:08:26,365 --> 01:08:29,901
You're helping a criminal to get away.

1065
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:48,602
We always hear that behind
evey successful man there is a woman.

1066
01:08:49,098 --> 01:08:53,268
But you are here to save a criminal.

1067
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:56,600
Even if the woman is characterless..

1068
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,234
..she's tying to defend her man.

1069
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,766
That proves how strong
their relationship is.

1070
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:07,035
Seeing you l come to know that
you belong to a dignified family.

1071
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:10,100
What's your relation with him?

1072
01:09:10,999 --> 01:09:12,533
l knew it.

1073
01:09:13,598 --> 01:09:14,665
l knew it.

1074
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:18,834
l did feel..

1075
01:09:19,165 --> 01:09:21,600
..that something was fishy.

1076
01:09:22,632 --> 01:09:24,600
But l ignored it.

1077
01:09:25,565 --> 01:09:29,235
l was here to build relationship with
you since you're my mother relative..

1078
01:09:30,031 --> 01:09:31,866
..but you put me to shame.

1079
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,366
You put my honor at stake.

1080
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:35,466
No.

1081
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:42,038
l didn't know that my daughter
was in love with Mahadeva.

1082
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,300
listen to me carefully.

1083
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,967
Our horoscopes match really well.

1084
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:50,600
God's wish is that we two get married.

1085
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:52,366
l swear by my horoscope..

1086
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:59,003
..Jogi will be ruined in six months.

1087
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:03,766
A blind man can gain eyesight.

1088
01:10:04,565 --> 01:10:07,067
An unlucky man can get lucky.

1089
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:13,703
But a hoodlum's fate
cannot be changed even by God.

1090
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:15,833
Did you hear him?

1091
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:17,466
l'm a man.

1092
01:10:17,732 --> 01:10:20,134
There will be many
girls wanting to mary me.

1093
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:23,902
But if your daughter
gets married to him..

1094
01:10:24,398 --> 01:10:25,565
..she will get ruined.

1095
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:31,567
Dear, why don't you understand?

1096
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:36,102
Don't ruin your life
geRing married to Jogi.

1097
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,568
Father, you said Mahadeva
was my best friend..

1098
01:10:40,165 --> 01:10:42,100
..and now you talk against him.

1099
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:47,602
No maRer what happens
l will go to Mahadeva.

1100
01:10:49,765 --> 01:10:51,700
You will not find him alive.

1101
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:56,068
People call him Jogi.

1102
01:10:56,999 --> 01:11:04,106

and bring him back for sure.

1103

Are you talking about 'Pallande'?

1106
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:30,500
You shouldn't be
coming to such places.

1107
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:32,300
You're right.

1108
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:37,937
But did my father lie
that you're mother's brother?

1109

Hi.

1177
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:47,468
On one side people of Karnataka
are betting on Jogi's release..

1178
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:49,265
..on the other side..

1179
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,568
..hoodlums who feared Jogi
are now tying to kill him.

1180
01:17:57,231 --> 01:18:00,233
l feel something fishy.
- What do you mean?

1181
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:02,633
What if Jogi is aRacked
before geRing released?

1182
01:18:02,899 --> 01:18:04,867
l don't know how, Vidya.

1183
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:08,535
lt is our duty to guard
Jogi at the court premises.

Sir, help me.

That's all, your honor.

1206
01:21:03,965 --> 01:21:06,667
Ms, how are you related to
Mr. Ramkrishna, the victim?

1207
01:21:06,799 --> 01:21:07,966
He's my father.

1208
01:21:08,265 --> 01:21:09,733
Why was he murdered?

1209
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:12,902
He didn't want to sell
my grandpa's property.

1210
01:21:13,098 --> 01:21:15,433
You mean he was murdered for property?

1211
01:21:15,799 --> 01:21:16,232
Yes.

1212
01:21:16,332 --> 01:21:19,134
Who murdered him? - Jogi.

1213
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:21,600
Where you present at the murder spot?

1214
01:21:21,932 --> 01:21:25,001
lt was he who killed my father,
took his thumb impression.

1215
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:27,199
He then came to my house,
threatened my uncle..

1216
01:21:27,265 --> 01:21:29,634
..and had him sign the papen.

1217
01:21:29,832 --> 01:21:31,600
Was he the one?

1218
01:21:31,999 --> 01:21:33,400
No, his men.

1219
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,366
But you said it was
Jogi who killed your father?

1220
01:21:35,665 --> 01:21:37,566
The goons told me that
they were Jogi's aides.

1221
01:21:37,632 --> 01:21:40,067
You didn't see him, how do
you say Jogi killed your father?

1222
01:21:40,131 --> 01:21:41,932
How could l see him when
he didn't come to my house?

1223
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,399
Point to me noted, your honor.

1224
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:49,234
But Jogi says it was you
who got your father killed?

1225
01:21:49,465 --> 01:21:51,900
What? Me?

1226
01:21:52,131 --> 01:21:57,703
Yes. He says that you hired goons and
got your father killed for property.

1227
01:21:58,031 --> 01:21:59,832
How can you believe it?

1228
01:22:00,065 --> 01:22:01,800
When you can believe
what someone told you..

1229
01:22:01,865 --> 01:22:03,199
..why shouldn't the court
or l believe what Jogi said?

1230
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:04,499
He's lying.

1231
01:22:04,598 --> 01:22:05,665
The case itself is a lie.

1232
01:22:05,765 --> 01:22:07,500
Your honor,
like the 25 cases lacked evidence..

1233
01:22:07,598 --> 01:22:10,634
..similar even this case is the same..

1234
01:22:10,799 --> 01:22:13,401
Please do your)udgment.

1235
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,767
Jogi has been released!

1236
01:22:31,565 --> 01:22:34,701
lt was as if l was born again.

1237
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:38,934
My mother couldn't come back..

1238
01:22:40,098 --> 01:22:42,366
..that's why she sent you.

1239
01:22:43,999 --> 01:22:47,736
l'm indebted to her and you.

1240
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:53,668
lt was my mother
who gave birth to me..

1241
01:22:54,765 --> 01:23:00,871
..but you gave me a new life.

1242
01:23:03,498 --> 01:23:04,565
Bye.

1243
01:23:05,332 --> 01:23:09,135
God bless you. - Sir..

1244
01:23:09,598 --> 01:23:10,398
Excuse me, sir.

1245
01:23:10,498 --> 01:23:13,300
Your cases have been revealed today.

1246
01:23:13,632 --> 01:23:16,835
Did you win the cases in the
right way or did you threaten someone?

1247
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:25,301
Man commits murder for food.

1248
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:28,934
Man commits murder for money.

1249
01:23:29,765 --> 01:23:31,333
ln spite of being educated..

1250
01:23:32,065 --> 01:23:37,470
..you publish news in
your papen )ust to gain TRP.

1251
01:23:38,098 --> 01:23:41,301
You ruined many people
)ust to make your living.

1252
01:23:42,398 --> 01:23:43,699
lsn't it unfair?

1253
01:23:44,732 --> 01:23:48,969
ln the )ail we were told
that 'Truth Always Wins'..

1254
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:51,099
..and it was said by Gandhi.

1255
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:53,934
lf you were present during his time..

1256
01:23:54,265 --> 01:23:56,567
..Gandhi never would've become great.

1257
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,767
Mother Teresa wouldn't have stayed in
this county for more than two months.

1258
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:02,000
let me ask you something.

1259
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:06,102
Why does a mother want
her son to be educated?

1260
01:24:06,632 --> 01:24:08,400
So that he serves the society.

1261
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,468
l'm an illiterate man.

1262
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:14,400
You all are educated.

1263
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:17,434
Some of you are highly qualified.

1264
01:24:18,165 --> 01:24:19,633
Touch your heart and tell me..

1265
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:22,900
..did you study
)ust to make money?

1266
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:54,267
Publish in your papen.

1267
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,867
Make it headlines.

1268
01:24:58,031 --> 01:24:59,432
Bangalore belongs to me.

1269
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:08,772
No one can enter Karnataka
without my permission.

1270
01:25:13,098 --> 01:25:18,403
''Come on.''

1271
01:25:22,999 --> 01:25:28,504
I I I I
Jogayya, come on.

1272
01:25:33,332 --> 01:25:35,967
''She's watching you from a distance.''

1273
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:39,100
''She's cying for you.''

1274
01:25:39,398 --> 01:25:45,437
''Please don't go.''

1275
01:25:45,965 --> 01:25:49,535
''Don't let your mother down.''

1276
01:25:53,098 --> 01:25:57,068
I I I I
Jogayya.

1277
01:25:57,699 --> 01:25:59,700
''Gentlemen, you see it.''

1278
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:01,933
''He has got the power, you feel it.''

1279
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:04,334
''He has passion.''

1280
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:07,734
''Welcome back, Jogayya.''

1281
01:26:29,665 --> 01:26:33,402
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1282
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:37,868
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1283
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:42,269
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1284
01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:47,069
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1285
01:27:00,198 --> 01:27:06,137
The goons lost courage
a_er his release.

1286
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:12,070
He incurred us loss
a_er he got released.

1287
01:27:12,465 --> 01:27:18,704
The rich businessmen
don't fear us anymore.

1288
01:27:19,332 --> 01:27:21,600
Eveything is in a mess.

1289
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:27,436
l feel like going to
)ail committing murder.

1290
01:27:27,498 --> 01:27:29,366
Shut up.

1291
01:27:29,432 --> 01:27:35,604
lf Jogi stood against me,
l would've hacked him to death.

1292
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:40,636
Narasimha, don't get emotional.

1293
01:27:41,532 --> 01:27:43,133
Calm down.

1294
01:27:43,565 --> 01:27:44,666
Summon him to compromise.

1295
01:27:44,732 --> 01:27:49,903
He will never compromise easily.

1296
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:51,699
He's Jogi.

1297
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:53,533
Request him.

1298
01:27:54,632 --> 01:27:58,302
He will surely come to compromise.

1299
01:28:07,298 --> 01:28:08,999
Boss, don't feel pity.

1300
01:28:09,398 --> 01:28:11,233
They are not trustworthy.

1301
01:28:11,565 --> 01:28:13,133
Don't care about them.

1302
01:28:13,365 --> 01:28:16,367
Don't agree for a compromise.

1303
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:22,667
Hail lord Shiva!

1304
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:29,034
Hail lord Shiva!

1305
01:28:29,098 --> 01:28:35,103
I I I I
Jogi.

1306
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:42,734
Who fired bullets? Come on.

1307
01:28:42,799 --> 01:28:44,600
Check if Jogi is alright.

1308
01:28:44,665 --> 01:28:46,666
Boss, Jogi is not in the car.

1309
01:28:48,498 --> 01:28:51,000
What do we do now?

1310
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:53,133
lt was l who summoned him.

1311
01:28:54,098 --> 01:28:57,634
l'm such a fool. l messed with him.

1312
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,967
let's gets away.

1313
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:18,966
Krishna?

1314
01:29:20,398 --> 01:29:21,832
Cheluva?

1315
01:29:23,231 --> 01:29:24,832
Suri?

1316
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:27,800
l told you they are not trustworthy.

1317
01:29:27,865 --> 01:29:29,800
They tried to kill you.

1318
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:32,033
Boss, they will ta_et you.

1319
01:29:32,098 --> 01:29:33,666
They shouldn't be spared.

1320
01:29:43,832 --> 01:29:47,602
You need to pay aRention
when you're driving.

1321
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:51,235
There are people around.

1322
01:29:51,799 --> 01:29:55,602
Else they will not spare you.

1323
01:29:55,699 --> 01:29:59,869
Sir, l apologize on his behalf.
You may go.

1324
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:07,569
lt was the old man who ta_eted me.
Find him.

1325
01:30:07,632 --> 01:30:12,169
''Where is your kingdom?''

1326
01:30:12,565 --> 01:30:15,334
''Where is your kingdom?''

1327
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:24,468
l thought you will come tomorrow.

1328
01:30:24,765 --> 01:30:26,733
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1329
01:30:26,965 --> 01:30:31,569
You are quite fast.
- ''Hail lord Shiva.''

1330
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,867
Would you like to have coflee? - No.

1331
01:30:34,131 --> 01:30:35,398
This old house.

1332
01:30:35,965 --> 01:30:37,599
My hands are clean.

1333
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,367
My life is like an empty paper.

1334
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:43,601
The typewriter and the black ink.

1335
01:30:43,932 --> 01:30:48,202
They mean a lot.

1336
01:30:48,432 --> 01:30:53,837
This typewriter is my God.

1337
01:30:54,732 --> 01:30:57,568
l'm proud to say that l was a steno.

1338
01:30:59,565 --> 01:31:03,068
l worked as a steno for
30 yean in the session's court.

1339
01:31:03,732 --> 01:31:05,066
l'm now retired.

1340
01:31:06,131 --> 01:31:08,733
My name is Mukundiah.

1341
01:31:08,999 --> 01:31:10,367
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1342
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:13,367
You must be wondering
why l'm telling this to you.

1343
01:31:13,632 --> 01:31:16,301
There's some kind of
relationship between you and me.

1344
01:31:16,732 --> 01:31:20,135
lt is all about destiny.

1345
01:31:20,999 --> 01:31:26,404
l used to type with these
fingen about corruption and insult.

1346
01:31:27,632 --> 01:31:29,133
lt is my profession.

1347
01:31:30,765 --> 01:31:35,970
You are the only good man.

1348
01:31:36,465 --> 01:31:37,432
That's why l'm your fan.

1349
01:31:37,498 --> 01:31:40,234
You always put me in trouble.

1350
01:31:40,298 --> 01:31:41,599
Are you crazy?

1351
01:31:41,665 --> 01:31:42,632
lt is impossible.

1352
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:45,434
lf the government tries
to take away the farmen' lands..

1353
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:47,333
..we will not be spared.

1354
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:49,066
Moreover,
it is the maRer of 1500 acres.

1355
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:53,601
Fo_et about showing respect..

1356
01:31:54,131 --> 01:31:56,833
..there are many shameless
people in this world.

1357
01:31:57,098 --> 01:31:58,866
l'm asking for land
to build a steel plant..

1358
01:31:58,965 --> 01:32:01,033
..so that your government gains merit.
Understand?

1359
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:05,201
lf l do as you say the
government will collapse.

1360
01:32:05,265 --> 01:32:06,866
Sir, this is unfair.

1361
01:32:07,365 --> 01:32:09,967
Your government didn't collapse..

1362
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:11,899
..when you were making
plenty of money..

1363
01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:13,734
..or buying land for
your children in Bangalore.

1364
01:32:13,932 --> 01:32:17,001
But you can't do it for us.

1365
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:20,401
Naidu, if the opposition
party learns about it..

1366
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:22,466
..they will turn the assembly
into a wrestling ring.

1367
01:32:22,765 --> 01:32:23,799
Ty and understand.

1368
01:32:23,865 --> 01:32:28,102
You've been giving excuses
for the last three yean.

1369
01:32:28,165 --> 01:32:32,402
Organize a global meet asking
the big investors to make investments.

1370
01:32:32,498 --> 01:32:33,599
No one will question you.

1371
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:36,701
Sir, we will purchase
Iands through our men.

1372
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,800
Convert them from
greenbelt to yellowbelt..

1373
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:42,335
..and we will handle the rest.
What do you think?

1374
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:46,001
Tell them we will pay them
not 1 lakh but 1ÂYz lakhs for one acre..

1375
01:32:46,065 --> 01:32:47,332
..they will surely agree to sell.

1376
01:32:47,398 --> 01:32:50,367
lt is not easy to fool the villagers.
They are vey adamant.

1377
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:51,999
Stop it.

1378
01:32:52,265 --> 01:32:54,100
They want to expensive can to travel.

1379
01:32:54,365 --> 01:32:58,035
They want to have expensive
drinks and meet beautiful girls.

1380
01:32:58,298 --> 01:33:01,300
The man who has such
desires cannot be adamant.

1381
01:33:01,365 --> 01:33:02,733
He will sell his land for sure.

1382
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:04,934
Sir, it is not easy.

1383
01:33:05,131 --> 01:33:08,400
They are hard workers.

1384
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:10,766
They will not sell their
Iands even at cost of their lives.

1385
01:33:10,832 --> 01:33:12,500
Then let's kill them.

1386
01:33:12,565 --> 01:33:14,366
They will sell their lands for sure.

1387
01:33:15,732 --> 01:33:16,365
Am l right?

1388
01:33:16,598 --> 01:33:18,967
Boss, l will handle this.

1389
01:33:19,065 --> 01:33:21,333
l will meet you in the evening.
- Who is he?

1390
01:33:21,398 --> 01:33:22,465
Just a minute.

1391
01:33:22,699 --> 01:33:26,969
lt's about millions of rupees.

1392
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:28,165
l know.

1393
01:33:28,231 --> 01:33:30,032
What do you know?

1394
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:32,299
lt is not as easy as killing somebody.

1395
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:33,398
How will you do it?

1396
01:33:33,465 --> 01:33:36,568
l will do it, but l need your support.

1397
01:33:36,632 --> 01:33:38,734
You have all the support,
but how will you do it?

1398
01:33:38,832 --> 01:33:40,433
l have a condition.

1399
01:33:40,498 --> 01:33:43,901
You must pay me double
the amount you paid the builden.

1400
01:33:43,965 --> 01:33:47,101
l need to organize many things.
You know it.

1401
01:33:48,365 --> 01:33:50,800
Don't you think it is risky?

1402
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:54,202
lt is, but it will
take us to new heights.

1403
01:33:56,165 --> 01:33:57,533
Who is Jogi?

1404
01:33:57,765 --> 01:34:01,101
Does he take us to be cowards?
- Master..

1405
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:04,768
l will not sell the land
even at the cost of my life.

1406
01:34:04,832 --> 01:34:07,467
l don't fear anyone. let's go.

1407
01:34:07,565 --> 01:34:10,267
They are bad people.
They will kill you.

1408
01:34:10,365 --> 01:34:11,599
listen to me.

1409
01:34:11,665 --> 01:34:15,702
l told you he will not sell his land.

1410
01:34:15,799 --> 01:34:18,234
l will have him give
his thumb impression.

1411
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:19,198
You sign the paper first.

1412
01:34:19,265 --> 01:34:21,900
Not )ust me, even my brother
has to sign the papen.

1413
01:34:21,999 --> 01:34:23,600
l will have him signed.
You sign the papen now.

1414
01:34:23,665 --> 01:34:25,099
Boss, the master agreed
to sign the papen.

1415
01:34:25,398 --> 01:34:26,265
ls that so?

1416
01:34:26,332 --> 01:34:28,067
Your brother is a great man.

1417
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:29,899
He granted his finger.
Take his thumb impression.

1418
01:34:29,999 --> 01:34:30,966
Oh my God.

1419
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:32,733
Father!

1420
01:34:34,765 --> 01:34:37,100
Who is Jogi? Do you know who l am?

1421
01:34:37,332 --> 01:34:39,200
l'm a no. 1 builder in Bangalore.

1422
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:42,534
l'm not doing business with
politicians' or hoodlums' money.

1423
01:34:42,999 --> 01:34:45,768
Many like Jogi work
in my construction site.

1424
01:34:45,999 --> 01:34:47,266
Don't mess with me..

1425
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:54,034
Who is Jogi?

1426
01:34:54,265 --> 01:34:56,834
ls he a government authorized?

1427
01:34:57,031 --> 01:35:00,534
He barged into the
government oflices..

1428
01:35:00,632 --> 01:35:02,867
..torched the documents..

1429
01:35:02,932 --> 01:35:05,301
..and creating fake documents.

1430
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,366
They are killing the farmen.

1431
01:35:07,465 --> 01:35:09,033
The government is geRing ruined.

1432
01:35:09,098 --> 01:35:12,367
What is the government doing?

1433
01:35:12,432 --> 01:35:15,301
ls it the government..

1434
01:35:15,365 --> 01:35:20,069
..or Jogi, the notorious
hoodlum from faraway place..

1435
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,132
..ruling the state? We want to know.

1436
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:24,533
We will protest until we know it.

1437
01:35:25,732 --> 01:35:26,799
''Hail lord Shiva!''

1438
01:35:27,665 --> 01:35:30,134
The government is using your name..

1439
01:35:30,332 --> 01:35:33,034
..the situation was
totally out of control.

1440
01:35:34,231 --> 01:35:38,301
l pity your men. They suflered a lot.

1441
01:35:38,398 --> 01:35:41,968
He said his mother always
advised him to earn his own living..

1442
01:35:42,165 --> 01:35:43,566
..and not to cheat on people.

1443
01:35:43,799 --> 01:35:49,538
But he went to Dubai
by cheating on all of us.

1444
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:02,135
l then realized that it
was the problem created by you..

1445
01:36:02,565 --> 01:36:05,200
..and you must solve it younelf.

1446
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:07,166
l immediately left for Bangalore.

1447
01:36:07,398 --> 01:36:11,301
l looked for you eveywhere.

1448
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:14,968
''lord Rama, son of Dasharata..

1449
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:16,599
..went on exile..''

1450
01:36:16,665 --> 01:36:18,767
Why are you starring at me?

1451
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:21,066
Don't look at me like that.

1452
01:36:21,432 --> 01:36:24,501
You look tired.
Why don't you take the oblation?

1453
01:36:24,732 --> 01:36:25,566
Are you feeling shy?

1454
01:36:25,999 --> 01:36:28,134
Take it. Have it.

1455
01:36:28,598 --> 01:36:32,001
lf l had brought you along that day,
you would've been killed.

1456
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:37,834
l talked with the commissioner,
got you arrested..

1457
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:41,568
..and had you bring here safely.

1458
01:36:41,632 --> 01:36:43,033
Hail lord Shiva.

1459
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:46,467
When people learnt
that you were coming here..

1460
01:36:46,565 --> 01:36:48,466
..in the Karnataka,
some were excited, some were upset..

1461
01:36:48,565 --> 01:36:49,599
..some felt disgusted..

1462
01:36:49,665 --> 01:36:50,532
..and some got scared.

1463
01:36:52,498 --> 01:36:57,536
But he was the only one
who was vey much excited.

1464
01:36:58,899 --> 01:37:02,535
Those who ruined families,
created bloodshed..

1465
01:37:02,598 --> 01:37:04,099
..cheated on others..

1466
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:07,601
..truth is life fire.

1467
01:37:07,932 --> 01:37:09,433
He will come.

1468
01:37:10,665 --> 01:37:15,403
There will be no corruption,
no illegal activities.

1469
01:37:15,665 --> 01:37:18,601
Come on, son. Come on, Jogi. Come on.

1470
01:37:47,799 --> 01:37:49,066
O Allah.

1471
01:37:57,265 --> 01:38:01,035
You're turning this place
into a cemetery by an innocent.

1472
01:38:01,265 --> 01:38:02,199
lsn't that unfair?

1473
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:11,635
To clean up the system,
l have sent my man.

1474
01:38:12,532 --> 01:38:18,104
l can't stop him
until he does his )ob.

1475
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:22,135
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1476
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,535
Eveything is ready,

1477
01:38:32,799 --> 01:38:35,001
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1478

place into a cemetery.

Kill him!

1482
01:38:56,398 --> 01:38:58,466
Come on.

1483
01:38:59,265 --> 01:39:01,033
''Hail lord Shiva.''

''Hail lord Shiva.''

1491
01:39:36,098 --> 01:39:37,032
''Get them.''

1492
01:39:40,165 --> 01:39:43,868
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1493
01:39:45,965 --> 01:39:46,899
''Get them.''

1494
01:39:49,265 --> 01:39:50,332
''Get them.''

1495
01:39:50,899 --> 01:39:51,899
Get him.

1496
01:39:52,131 --> 01:39:56,134
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1497
01:40:00,932 --> 01:40:05,102
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1498
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:06,432
''Get them.''

1499
01:40:18,231 --> 01:40:19,865
Kill him. Come on.

1500
01:40:24,131 --> 01:40:29,035
I I I I
Jogi.

1501
01:40:30,498 --> 01:40:36,670
I I I I
Jogi.

1502
01:40:36,932 --> 01:40:40,101
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1503
01:40:40,699 --> 01:40:43,401
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1504
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:46,601
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1505
01:40:46,665 --> 01:40:51,703
lf he dies his own death,
then burn him.

1506
01:40:52,865 --> 01:40:56,835
lf you visit his death ceremony,
l'll thrash you.

1507
01:40:56,899 --> 01:40:59,334
ls it so easy to thrash you?

1508
01:40:59,699 --> 01:41:03,135
look there, the police and
the government is supporting me.

1509
01:41:03,231 --> 01:41:06,267
Who is Jogi? Give way, you fool.

1510
01:41:06,465 --> 01:41:08,300
We got ruined because of him.

1511
01:41:08,365 --> 01:41:10,133
My wife's and children's
curse will never spare him.

1512
01:41:10,365 --> 01:41:11,733
God will surely punish him.

1513
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,734
lf one has to live,
the other has to get ruined.

1514
01:41:13,799 --> 01:41:15,367
You can't do anything. Am l right?

1515
01:41:15,432 --> 01:41:16,833
Have we lacked in
anything for these guys?

1516
01:41:16,932 --> 01:41:18,933
We've even got them married.

1517
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:20,632
We've given them advance money.

1518
01:41:20,732 --> 01:41:22,366
No one will do so much as we've done.
Isn't it?

1519
01:41:22,432 --> 01:41:25,067
You didn't do it for free.
You confiscated their lands.

1520
01:41:25,165 --> 01:41:28,134
Keep quiet.
If we register them today..

1521
01:41:28,365 --> 01:41:30,433
..we can settle happily in Bangkok.

1522
01:41:30,498 --> 01:41:31,799
Come out sir.
There's nothing to wory.

1523
01:41:31,865 --> 01:41:33,266
We've kept eveything ready.
Come here.

1524
01:41:47,665 --> 01:41:51,101
Nab him. He killed that man.

1525
01:41:51,432 --> 01:41:54,501
Thrash him.
- Brother, the break failed.

1526
01:41:54,565 --> 01:41:57,067
Brother..

1527
01:42:08,398 --> 01:42:10,066
He is Jogi. Come on, run from here.

1528
01:42:10,131 --> 01:42:11,932
Hury up. Run!

1529
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:17,267
Come on, get into the car.
- Hury up. Flee from here.

1530
01:42:21,799 --> 01:42:23,300
You finally met with an accident.

1531
01:42:24,498 --> 01:42:28,768
Driver kept saying,
'the break failed# 

1532
01:42:29,532 --> 01:42:31,133
We couldn't do anything.

1533
01:42:31,732 --> 01:42:34,401
lt is God's wish. Am l right?

1534
01:42:34,498 --> 01:42:38,969

- He isn't Jogi, but he is Jogayya.

1538
01:42:50,098 --> 01:42:51,098
Jogayya?

1539
01:42:53,632 --> 01:42:55,867

01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:17,400
''The roof has come down.''

I I I
Run! Run! Run! Run!'

1548
01:43:23,965 --> 01:43:26,567
''Run!''

1549
01:43:27,332 --> 01:43:30,168
''You can't hold a
sword in your hands.''

1550
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:33,267
''Jogi is here.
You can't stand here now.''

1551
01:43:33,365 --> 01:43:35,834

''Run!''

01:43:39,265 --> 01:43:42,334
''This earth is full of cheaters.''

1554
01:43:42,432 --> 01:43:45,902
''We don't want anything.
Come with me.''

1555
01:43:46,265 --> 01:43:48,667

Come to me as Jogi.

''Run!''

1558
01:43:55,165 --> 01:43:57,567
Onta, looks like you are leaving.

1559
01:43:57,632 --> 01:43:59,734
l'm going to pilgrimage
with my wife and children.

1560
01:43:59,799 --> 01:44:02,134
Say that you are fleeing
from this village.

1561
01:44:22,765 --> 01:44:25,534
''He enters the area like a lion.''

1562
01:44:25,799 --> 01:44:28,468
''He orden that the
village belongs to him.''

1563
01:44:28,532 --> 01:44:29,733
''Run!''

1564
01:44:31,498 --> 01:44:32,732
''Run!''

1565

''He sits alone on a chair

''Run!''

1569
01:44:46,865 --> 01:44:49,834
''The kings have built many palaces.''

1570
01:44:49,899 --> 01:44:53,569
''All the kings have died now.''

1571
01:44:53,632 --> 01:44:56,101
''Come to me as a philanthropist.''

1572
01:44:56,198 --> 01:44:59,234
''Run!''

1573
01:44:59,298 --> 01:45:02,467

''l touch my wife,
but l see him around.''

1576
01:45:51,398 --> 01:45:52,365
''Run!''

1577
01:45:54,365 --> 01:45:55,532
''Run!''

1578
01:45:57,832 --> 01:46:00,634
''He's waiting for all
of us in the graveyard.''

1579
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,634
''No maRer how much you pray,
he'll not spare us.''

1580
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:04,732
''Run!''

1581
01:46:06,632 --> 01:46:07,933

01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:19,034
''Come to me as a philosopher.''

''You can't hold a
sword in your hands.''

''Jogi is here.
You can't stand here now.''

1589
01:46:31,398 --> 01:46:34,400
''Run!''

1590
01:46:34,498 --> 01:46:37,767
''Run!''

1591

I I I I
Jogayya.

1592
01:46:40,865 --> 01:46:42,866
I I I I
Jogayya.

1593
01:46:43,899 --> 01:46:46,167
I I I I
Jogayya.

1594
01:46:46,965 --> 01:46:49,233
''The roof has come down.''

1595
01:46:49,298 --> 01:46:52,167
I I I I
Jogayya.

1596
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,433

I I I I
Jogayya.

1598
01:46:59,265 --> 01:47:01,500
''The roof has come down.''

1599
01:47:01,565 --> 01:47:02,899
I I I I
Jogayya.

1600
01:47:14,398 --> 01:47:15,932
This is an endless road.

1601
01:47:16,265 --> 01:47:17,833
No maRer how much
you run behind him..

1602
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:21,401
..you'll get tired,
but this road will not end.

1603
01:47:21,732 --> 01:47:23,433
He has gone overboard.

1604
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:26,033
You won't get him.

1605
01:47:28,632 --> 01:47:31,935
Even l don't want to walk
on the road that leads to my village.

1606
01:47:32,865 --> 01:47:38,237
l told my father that l'll
get Mahadeva back, and not Jogayya.

1607
01:47:39,131 --> 01:47:43,568
l can live with Mahadeva's memories.

1608
01:48:03,999 --> 01:48:05,200
listen to me.

1609
01:48:05,498 --> 01:48:06,832
l and boss have had
food in the same plate.

1610
01:48:06,899 --> 01:48:08,333
We even went to the
bathroom together. - Yes.

1611
01:48:08,432 --> 01:48:10,867
leave from here.
- Please, tell our names to him.

1612
01:48:10,932 --> 01:48:12,867
Brother! - Move aside.

1613
01:48:15,298 --> 01:48:18,534
Bhusa, ticket, and you.

1614
01:48:18,799 --> 01:48:20,934
lt's been a long
time l've met you guys.

1615
01:48:21,131 --> 01:48:23,766
l'm so happy to see you all here.

1616
01:48:23,865 --> 01:48:26,167
Remember, we all worked together.

1617
01:48:26,265 --> 01:48:29,267
Just because we scolded you that day,
l hope you are not angy.

1618
01:48:29,332 --> 01:48:29,999
Nothing like that.

1619
01:48:30,098 --> 01:48:32,433
Tell me, what made you come here?

1620
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:34,432
We were ready to
go to Dubai to meet you.

1621
01:48:34,532 --> 01:48:35,399
Couldn't we come here to meet you?

1622
01:48:35,498 --> 01:48:36,265
ls it? - Yes.

1623
01:48:36,365 --> 01:48:36,932
Come on, let's go inside.

1624
01:48:36,999 --> 01:48:39,201
Unknown people are landing here.

1625
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:42,901
Oh, you have a vey big house.

1626
01:48:48,398 --> 01:48:52,602
ls the government ruling
over the people or the underworld?

1627
01:48:57,932 --> 01:49:02,102
He's announcing in the
media that the government of..

1628
01:49:02,165 --> 01:49:03,833
..Karnataka belongs to him.

1629
01:49:04,598 --> 01:49:08,134
The people who used to
stand in front of CM's house..

1630
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:10,033
..to have a glance,
today they are standing in front of..

1631
01:49:10,131 --> 01:49:11,131
..underworld don's house.

1632
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,067
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1633
01:49:14,265 --> 01:49:16,934
He confiscated the lands from
the poor and got Ashok Chabaria..

1634
01:49:16,999 --> 01:49:18,800
..murdered, he was an industrialist.

1635
01:49:18,999 --> 01:49:22,802
This shameless government
has proved it as an accident.

1636
01:49:22,865 --> 01:49:27,135
lf you really want to know the truth,
then handover this case to the CBl.

1637
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:28,732
Yes. - Yes.

1638
01:49:28,799 --> 01:49:32,235
We'll sit on protest for this.
Eveyone, come with me.

1639
01:49:37,131 --> 01:49:40,501
Bellay Naidu's team
doesn't listen to us at all.

1640
01:49:40,832 --> 01:49:43,367
Who all are involved in this case?

1641
01:49:43,465 --> 01:49:46,801
All are rowdies. - What do l do now?

1642
01:49:46,899 --> 01:49:49,601
lf they get any evidence,
eveything will be ruined.

1643
01:49:49,699 --> 01:49:52,735
Do one thing,
kill them all in an encounter.

1644
01:49:52,932 --> 01:49:54,333
Sir, if we do so,
then it will be diflicult..

1645
01:49:54,398 --> 01:49:55,799
..to answer the human rights
people.

1646
01:49:55,899 --> 01:49:57,533
Why will it be diflicult?

1647
01:49:57,799 --> 01:50:00,268
Tell them that the violence
in the city had increased.

1648
01:50:00,465 --> 01:50:01,999
let me see who does what.

1649
01:50:03,231 --> 01:50:03,998
Hey!

1650
01:50:04,398 --> 01:50:07,901
My sister's son who was
in the opposition party..

1651
01:50:08,165 --> 01:50:10,300
..your CM says that
he belonged to Rowdy Shetty..

1652
01:50:10,365 --> 01:50:11,432
..and want to get him
killed in an encounter. - Hey!

1653
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:16,298
Please don't do that..

1654
01:50:17,131 --> 01:50:19,466
Sir, you are already troubling Naidu..

1655
01:50:19,532 --> 01:50:21,300
..moreover you've put his
brother's name in the encounter list.

1656
01:50:21,398 --> 01:50:22,398
Erase his name from the list first.

1657
01:50:22,465 --> 01:50:23,732
You have to make him erase it..

1658
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:27,035
..or we'll go against
the government right away.

1659
01:50:27,098 --> 01:50:28,232
They said that they will protect us..

1660
01:50:28,298 --> 01:50:29,899
..and not to leak their names
to the department.

1661
01:50:29,965 --> 01:50:32,067
They had even promised us
that nothing would happen to us.

1662
01:50:32,131 --> 01:50:34,500
Now they've put our names in the
encounter list and are looking for us.

1663
01:50:34,565 --> 01:50:37,567
Hey, they would've done it by mistake.

1664
01:50:37,632 --> 01:50:40,167
l'm talking to them.
Keep quiet eveyone.

1665
01:50:40,231 --> 01:50:42,232
His wife is pregnant.
He'll surely come to meet her.

1666
01:50:42,532 --> 01:50:43,833
lf he comes here, shoot him.

1667
01:50:44,899 --> 01:50:46,300
Come on, get into the vehicle.

1668
01:50:47,899 --> 01:50:50,901
Have l built a house of my own
or have l given money to a mistress?

1669
01:50:51,098 --> 01:50:54,067
l've worked for the government.
Eveyone will support me.

1670
01:50:54,131 --> 01:50:55,532
Ministers are behind me.
No one can harm me.

1671
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:58,868
Mother, you hang up the phone.
l'll call you later. You hang up now.

1672
01:50:59,265 --> 01:51:01,333
Boss, no one is answering the phone.

1673
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:04,100
Sir, please. - Come on, run.

1674
01:51:04,298 --> 01:51:05,599
We are telling you to run. Come on.

1675
01:51:06,298 --> 01:51:09,267
Do you think we are demons?
They might be in )ail for six months.

1676
01:51:09,598 --> 01:51:11,032
Tell him to come and surrender.

1677
01:51:11,532 --> 01:51:13,533
Madam, no maRer how
much you plead them..

1678
01:51:13,732 --> 01:51:15,333
..they'll not spare your son.

1679
01:51:15,565 --> 01:51:18,634
You go home and pray to God.
God should help him now.

1680
01:51:18,732 --> 01:51:21,501
Go from here. Nothing can be done.

1681
01:51:27,265 --> 01:51:29,166
Stay here,
l'll go and meet him. - Okay.

1682
01:51:30,365 --> 01:51:32,233
Tell sir that l've come to meet him.

1683
01:51:32,298 --> 01:51:33,666
Sir, he's not at home. - What?

1684
01:51:33,765 --> 01:51:34,966
He left for his
village in the morning.

1685
01:51:35,031 --> 01:51:38,267
He's not at home or in the
parliament house. Where can he go?

1686
01:51:38,332 --> 01:51:40,200
Sir, why should l lie to you?

1687
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:44,266
There was a car parked here.
Where is it now?

1688
01:51:44,565 --> 01:51:45,933
They left as soon as you got down.

1689
01:51:55,932 --> 01:51:57,733
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1690
01:52:14,699 --> 01:52:18,502
l heard that police has
got order from their superiors.

1691
01:52:19,799 --> 01:52:22,835
They've got orden to
kill my Apanna in an encounter.

1692
01:52:25,065 --> 01:52:28,902
l heard that you never let
anyone go empty-handed from here.

1693
01:52:30,765 --> 01:52:33,601
l have only one son.

1694
01:52:35,465 --> 01:52:40,436
Please, spare my son.

1695
01:52:57,765 --> 01:52:59,032
Where he is now?

1696
01:53:06,799 --> 01:53:07,566
Apanna.

1697
01:53:07,665 --> 01:53:11,168
Mother, don't wory.

1698
01:53:11,231 --> 01:53:12,632
l'll surely return. - Jogi.

1699
01:53:13,765 --> 01:53:17,335
Jogi, even l've played many games.

1700
01:53:17,598 --> 01:53:20,100
But you abducted my mom
and want to deal with me.

1701
01:53:20,298 --> 01:53:22,833
Shame on you.
You call younelf as underworld don?

1703
01:53:31,598 --> 01:53:35,835
What do l do? Your mother
is asking me to protect you..

1704
01:53:37,432 --> 01:53:39,634
..and save your life.

1705
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,835
Wherever you are,

Come to Kempapura.

Son, did my son Appanna
say that he's coming?

1712
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:07,866
Will he come?

1713
01:54:08,298 --> 01:54:09,732
He said he'll come.

1714
01:54:10,999 --> 01:54:15,036
lf my mother comes to me and asks,
what have you done?

1715
01:54:16,765 --> 01:54:21,769
l was wondering how
would l answer her.

1716
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:24,498
No maRer even if l lose my life.

1717

You go home. Go.

01:54:49,699 --> 01:54:52,768
Sir, l want to call mother once.

1720
01:54:56,265 --> 01:54:57,265
Son!

1721
01:55:02,965 --> 01:55:08,670
Dear.. son?

1722
01:55:08,732 --> 01:55:11,568
Jogi, my mother always said..

1723
01:55:11,632 --> 01:55:13,700
..don't overact,
you'll be in trouble one day.

1724
01:55:14,165 --> 01:55:16,600
l used your name
and made a lot of money.

1725
01:55:16,899 --> 01:55:18,567
l've ruined your name.

1726
01:55:18,865 --> 01:55:20,800
Please, do me a favor.

1727
01:55:21,465 --> 01:55:26,436
lie to my mother saying,
he's gone there, he'll be back.

1728
01:55:26,632 --> 01:55:29,234
Or my mother will die of heart aRack.

1729
01:55:34,231 --> 01:55:36,266
Mother. Mother.

1730
01:55:36,699 --> 01:55:37,966
Mother..

1731
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:40,700
Mother. Mother.

1732
01:56:03,565 --> 01:56:04,966
Within one and half hour
such incident has taken place..

1733
01:56:05,031 --> 01:56:06,966
..that shocked whole of Bangalore.

1734
01:56:07,031 --> 01:56:09,066
The tax minister
Mr. Narasimha Naidu's brothen..

1735
01:56:09,231 --> 01:56:11,433
..Subramaniyam Naidu
and Muralikrishna Naidu..

1736
01:56:11,498 --> 01:56:14,901
..the police proved them as hoodlums
and shot them in an encounter.

1737
01:56:15,365 --> 01:56:17,166
let's see what
Mr. Naidu has to say about this.

1738
01:56:17,265 --> 01:56:19,467
Who do you call as rowdy?
They are not rowdies.

1739
01:56:19,532 --> 01:56:21,066
Ours is a respectable family.

1740
01:56:21,131 --> 01:56:24,701
They are workers who toiled
day and night for our party.

1741
01:56:24,765 --> 01:56:26,399
They have killed our party workers.

1742
01:56:26,498 --> 01:56:28,666
Sir, there must be something
between you and the government.

1743
01:56:28,865 --> 01:56:32,201
They couldn't bear that
we have Q7 MMs with us..

1744
01:56:32,298 --> 01:56:34,967
..CM has played this game with us.

1745
01:56:35,031 --> 01:56:36,932
Sir, even your government
is troubling people.

1746
01:56:36,999 --> 01:56:40,335
There's no government.
We all are withdrawing our names.

1747
01:56:40,532 --> 01:56:42,133
l can't stay peacefully
even for a day.. - Sir.

1748
01:56:42,198 --> 01:56:44,900
Welcome. like taking a
ticket a_er the train leaves..

1749
01:56:44,999 --> 01:56:46,567
..you are coming to
me a_er l lost my position.

1750
01:56:46,832 --> 01:56:49,067
Sir.. - How many times
l told you to erase their names..

1751
01:56:49,432 --> 01:56:51,934
..from the encounter list.

1752
01:56:52,031 --> 01:56:53,866
Why didn't you listen to
me and kill them in an encounter?

1753
01:56:53,932 --> 01:56:56,200
Sir, that's not a police encounter.

1754
01:56:56,298 --> 01:56:59,134
The bullet found in their
corpse is from your department.

1755
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:01,567
lf you didn't kill them,
then who did it?

1756
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:15,336
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1757
01:57:19,932 --> 01:57:21,833
Hey, it is Jogi.

1758
01:57:34,899 --> 01:57:39,303
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1759
01:57:39,365 --> 01:57:43,702
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1760
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:45,666
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1761
01:57:46,098 --> 01:57:51,570
'This means that they've
Iost their Q5 MMs# 

1762
01:57:51,632 --> 01:57:54,334
'That means that the
government is falling# 

1763
01:57:54,398 --> 01:57:55,866
Boss, what next?

1764
01:57:56,065 --> 01:57:59,501
Elections. let's ask the people.
let they take a decision.

1765
01:57:59,598 --> 01:58:01,566
l've toiled for three yean.

1766
01:58:01,799 --> 01:58:03,200
None of them have done
so much for you till now.

1767
01:58:03,265 --> 01:58:05,667
Gulabi party and Chitisire
party people are )ealous that..

1768
01:58:05,732 --> 01:58:07,867
..l've been serving the
government from all these yean.

1769
01:58:13,065 --> 01:58:14,366
Gloy to him!

1770
01:58:14,632 --> 01:58:16,100
Gloy to him!

1771
01:58:16,932 --> 01:58:20,835
As you all know that women struggle
so much to get drinking water.

1772
01:58:20,899 --> 01:58:23,034
What are the people reading
instead of listening to me?

1773
01:58:23,098 --> 01:58:25,133
Gulabi party and Chitisire
party people have come out with a..

1774
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:27,266
..new party named Mushti.

1775
01:58:27,332 --> 01:58:28,966
The hot news other
than all this is that..

1776
01:58:29,065 --> 01:58:31,534
..Jogi has come out with
a scheme who doesn't even..

1777
01:58:31,598 --> 01:58:33,166
..know the spelling of politics.

1778
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:36,334
All the party oflicers are
holding an emergency meeting..

1779
01:58:36,398 --> 01:58:40,268
..on the other hand all
the party leaden are scared.

1780
01:58:40,598 --> 01:58:43,067
He's saying that he
has 30,OOO crores with him.

1781
01:58:43,298 --> 01:58:47,001
lf he comes into politics..
people will celebrate daily.

1782
01:58:47,065 --> 01:58:48,466
We'll be ruined then.

1783
01:58:48,565 --> 01:58:50,800
Politicians, in their speech, always
say that youth should come forward..

1784
01:58:50,865 --> 01:58:52,666
..and they used to push
us behind and come forward.

1785
01:58:52,732 --> 01:58:54,266
Now Jogi has come up.

1786
01:58:54,332 --> 01:58:56,267
lf he's moving forward,
we all should follow him.

1787
01:58:56,332 --> 01:58:58,033
What do you all say? - Yes!

1788
01:59:02,365 --> 01:59:06,936
People of the city have
a new thunderstorm named Jogi now.

1789
01:59:07,365 --> 01:59:11,368
To calm this thunderstorm
Jogi himself should face people.

1790
01:59:11,632 --> 01:59:13,600
No one knows where Jogi
is and what he is doing.

1791
01:59:13,665 --> 01:59:16,401
No one knows that who
he is giving party ticket to.

1792
01:59:16,498 --> 01:59:19,000
We don't know what your boss has done.

1793
01:59:19,098 --> 01:59:23,769
We've lost our minds. Eveyone
is troubling us to give them ticket.

1794
01:59:23,832 --> 01:59:27,135
ls it a bus ticket, train ticket, or a
flight ticket to give away so easily?

1795
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:28,832
He is making eveyone wait
and he himself is sitting here..

1796
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:30,467
..peacefully and eating mutton pilaf.

1797
01:59:39,865 --> 01:59:42,601
ls it delicious?
- Yes, the meat is so soft.

1798
01:59:42,699 --> 01:59:43,666
lt is really vey delicious.

1799
01:59:43,932 --> 01:59:45,300
You eat so much.

1800
01:59:47,265 --> 01:59:49,533
Please, don't eye on my food.

1801
01:59:49,598 --> 01:59:50,632
l'll sufler from stomach pain then.

1802
01:59:50,832 --> 01:59:51,933
l'll order one plate for you also.

1803
01:59:52,198 --> 01:59:53,966
Punga, get one plate for him.

1804
01:59:54,231 --> 01:59:55,632
Hey boy, go and ask him what he wants.

1805
01:59:55,732 --> 01:59:58,935
Sir, l'll tell you something.
Never eye on other's food.

1806
01:59:59,265 --> 02:00:01,600
Are you telling this to me?

1807
02:00:02,031 --> 02:00:03,766
No maRer how young or old you are,
you have to learn.

1808
02:00:03,832 --> 02:00:04,232
Am l right?

1809
02:00:04,298 --> 02:00:08,068
Because the system is misusing your name..

1810
02:00:08,298 --> 02:00:11,834
..you brought all the illegal
activities taking place in the system..

1811
02:00:11,899 --> 02:00:13,033
..under your control..

1812
02:00:13,432 --> 02:00:14,633
..and say that..

1813
02:00:14,765 --> 02:00:17,834
..the system belongs to you.

1814
02:00:18,265 --> 02:00:19,299
lsn't it unfair?

1815
02:00:20,332 --> 02:00:22,634
Sir, female, gold, and land,
if they come to you on their own..

1816
02:00:23,098 --> 02:00:25,099
..you should not refuse them.

1817
02:00:25,465 --> 02:00:27,066
Think it as your
destiny and accept it.

1818
02:00:27,532 --> 02:00:29,533
You've played many games in the dark.

1819
02:00:30,065 --> 02:00:32,167
Now you want to play
game in the daytime?

1820
02:00:32,532 --> 02:00:35,167
Poor people..
they consider you as their hero.

1821
02:00:35,765 --> 02:00:39,902
When they come close,
they'll know that you are a villain.

1822
02:00:42,031 --> 02:00:44,700
l brought you to change the system..

1823
02:00:45,065 --> 02:00:47,500
..you want to ruin the whole system.

1824
02:00:47,999 --> 02:00:50,434
You also want the power, don't you?

1825
02:00:52,899 --> 02:00:56,636
Are you the Singainur Madesha?

1826
02:01:00,131 --> 02:01:02,266
Why? Do you have a doubt?

1827
02:01:02,465 --> 02:01:05,167
The son who always said that he
won't go against his mother's words..

1828
02:01:05,532 --> 02:01:07,867
..today you are going against her.

1829
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,200
Where are you going to?

1830
02:01:10,432 --> 02:01:17,105
Sir, who am l?
l'm )ust a puppet of God's hands.

1831
02:01:17,999 --> 02:01:19,100
My destiny.

1832
02:01:48,999 --> 02:01:53,770
Sir.. it is me. - Mahadeva?

1833
02:01:54,932 --> 02:01:57,634
What made you come here?

1834
02:01:58,565 --> 02:02:02,702
l came to meet you.
- Did you come to meet me?

1835
02:02:02,799 --> 02:02:06,469
Yes. - Why are you folding your hands?

1836
02:02:07,298 --> 02:02:08,899
Please, stand straight.

1837
02:02:10,265 --> 02:02:13,501
Sir, is Vidya alright?

1838
02:02:15,231 --> 02:02:17,499
Mahadeva, my daughter is not with me.

1839
02:02:17,598 --> 02:02:19,366
Sir, why are you ioking?

1840
02:02:20,165 --> 02:02:22,867
Vidya will go to her husband's
house a_er marriage, isn't it?

1841
02:02:23,298 --> 02:02:24,265
Why will she come to me?

1842
02:02:24,332 --> 02:02:26,534
He is not her husband.

1843
02:02:26,865 --> 02:02:29,667
l love Mahadeva.

1844
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:34,801
l'll live with him, or l'll die.

1845
02:02:34,899 --> 02:02:36,033
Dear, is this the time to talk..

1846
02:02:36,131 --> 02:02:37,365
..when you are geRing
married in some time?

1847
02:02:37,432 --> 02:02:39,734
What did you say when you
told me to take out the ring?

1848
02:02:40,498 --> 02:02:43,667
You said,
my mother wished to see me happy.

1849
02:02:44,365 --> 02:02:48,435
lf that wish has to be fulfilled,
l won't mary him.

1850
02:02:49,065 --> 02:02:51,000
l'll go to Mahadeva's house.

1851
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:53,566
l tried to convince her so much.

1852
02:02:53,832 --> 02:02:56,634
l told her that he is not the
innocent Mahadeva who worked for us..

1853
02:02:56,832 --> 02:02:59,668
..he is actually Jogi.
His business is diflerent.

02:03:02,899 --> 02:03:04,133
..she didn't listen to me.

1856
02:03:04,398 --> 02:03:10,003
She said, no maRer what,
l'll bring back my Mahadeva.

1857
02:03:10,098 --> 02:03:13,367
She left me and came
here looking for you.

1858
02:03:13,832 --> 02:03:16,801

''She's a stranger to you, Jogi.''

1869
02:04:06,832 --> 02:04:09,234
''She was with me in my evey step.''

1870
02:04:09,465 --> 02:04:11,934
''She protected me like a shadow.''

1871

Come on, quick.

1894

'Jogi, who was coming up

''Hail lord Shiva.''

1902
02:08:04,031 --> 02:08:07,467
'As soon as the news
about Jogi was revealed..

..not only people from Bangalore,
but also from the..

1904

..other states of Karnataka
have come to see Jogi.

1905
02:08:14,532 --> 02:08:19,203
lt is suspected that some political
Ieaden are involved in this incident.

1906
02:08:19,265 --> 02:08:24,136
Eveyone has a doubt
whether Jogi will be alive?

1907
02:08:26,131 --> 02:08:27,832
Doctor, how is he now?

1908

Grandpa, will Jogayya get well soon?
Tell me, grandpa.

Will he come out?
- Yes, dear. He will recover soon.

Oh my god, l can't believe this.

Jogayya!

1920

Total of 1Q people
were in the encounter list.

1921
02:10:05,665 --> 02:10:08,334
Naidu's brother's name
and his uncle's name were in it.

1922
02:10:08,832 --> 02:10:11,968
They are vey strong. They
have the government in their hands.

1923
02:10:12,231 --> 02:10:13,699
They both have got their
names erased from the list.

1924
02:10:13,932 --> 02:10:14,565
Take this.

1925
02:10:16,465 --> 02:10:20,268
Brother, three accidents
can be fo_iven for evey driver..

1926

..in our department.

1927

lf the break fails and
somebody loses their life..

1928
02:10:25,465 --> 02:10:27,099
..no one can do anything about it.
Am l right, brother?

1929
02:10:27,565 --> 02:10:29,566
CM has grudge on Naidu.

1930
02:10:30,198 --> 02:10:32,133
The government is standing
on a thin hair now.

1931
02:10:32,532 --> 02:10:34,100
Don't know when this
government will fall.

1932
02:10:34,165 --> 02:10:35,299
Jogayya!

1933
02:10:37,432 --> 02:10:42,103
Mr. Jogi, you've declared
30,OOO crores on younelf.

1934
02:10:42,432 --> 02:10:44,167
This is almost a state's budget.

1935
02:10:44,765 --> 02:10:46,500
Where did you get so much money from?

1936
02:10:57,565 --> 02:10:59,767
l got the money by using this.

1937
02:10:59,865 --> 02:11:01,566
When you were making
so much of money..

1938
02:11:01,665 --> 02:11:03,133
..was the government
and the police keeping mum?

1939
02:11:03,765 --> 02:11:05,533
You ask them. - What do you mean?

1940
02:11:05,865 --> 02:11:08,100
ln the day time, the work that
a leader chosen by..

1941
02:11:08,165 --> 02:11:10,934
..you to run this government..

1942
02:11:11,699 --> 02:11:15,803
..can't do, they take support
from the underworld people..

1943
02:11:16,598 --> 02:11:23,037
..at night time to do their work.
They've made me the leader of it.

1944
02:11:23,131 --> 02:11:25,433
You are a leader to the
government that runs at night..

1945
02:11:25,532 --> 02:11:27,634
..but you want to become a leader to
the government that runs at day time.

1946
02:11:27,732 --> 02:11:31,202
What's the guarantee that
you won't go back to your dark world?

1947
02:11:32,432 --> 02:11:33,966
Already the people of
Karnataka are saying that..

1948
02:11:34,031 --> 02:11:35,232
..you are going to be the next CM.

1949
02:11:35,298 --> 02:11:36,298
What do you have to say about it?

1950
02:11:36,398 --> 02:11:40,301
You are our leader.
You are our protector.

1951
02:11:56,131 --> 02:11:58,433
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1952
02:11:59,999 --> 02:12:04,236
You are our leader.
You are our protector.

1953
02:12:07,965 --> 02:12:15,472
My mother always said,
earn your food and not beg.

1954
02:12:16,965 --> 02:12:20,401
lf you make me sit on this position..

1955
02:12:22,098 --> 02:12:25,167
..l'll have to stamp you all.

1956
02:12:26,632 --> 02:12:28,967
The power of this seat is such.

1957
02:12:29,065 --> 02:12:31,333
We don't know about the power.

1958
02:12:31,398 --> 02:12:32,899
Jogayya is our power.

1959
02:12:32,965 --> 02:12:34,700
I I I I
Jogi.

1960
02:12:34,765 --> 02:12:38,001
Don't give your power
to me and make me a leader.

1961
02:12:39,799 --> 02:12:42,535
lf you keep your power to younelf..

1962
02:12:44,231 --> 02:12:46,866
..eveyone present here is a leader.

1963
02:12:48,231 --> 02:12:50,900
Then no one can harm you.

1964
02:12:55,098 --> 02:12:58,968
Please, leave me alone.

1965
02:13:01,532 --> 02:13:02,933
Even l'll live a life.

1966
02:13:05,298 --> 02:13:06,932
Please, don't make me a leader.

1967
02:13:07,565 --> 02:13:08,365
Spare me.

1968
02:13:11,332 --> 02:13:15,703
You finally proved that
you are Singnallur Madesha.

1969
02:13:15,765 --> 02:13:19,768
''lord Shiva.'' - Move aside.

1970
02:13:19,965 --> 02:13:21,266
Can't you see the boss is coming?

1971
02:13:29,965 --> 02:13:33,802
I I I I
Jogi.

1972
02:14:53,432 --> 02:14:58,470
I I I I
Jogi.

1973
02:15:04,899 --> 02:15:06,467
What is this?
- What's the maRer, sir?

1974
02:15:06,632 --> 02:15:08,900
Earlier, whenever we used
to come for a visit here..

1975
02:15:09,098 --> 02:15:11,800
..people used to flock
me like honeybees. - Yes, sir.

1976
02:15:11,899 --> 02:15:13,700
They never used to let
me get down from the car.

1977
02:15:13,765 --> 02:15:14,632
Sir, l don't know what's going on.

1978
02:15:14,865 --> 02:15:18,335
When l'm here to ask for votes,
there are no people around.

1979
02:15:18,398 --> 02:15:19,665
What is going on?

1980
02:15:19,732 --> 02:15:20,999
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1981
02:15:21,098 --> 02:15:23,500
Hello, madam.
We belong to Chitisire party.

1982
02:15:23,632 --> 02:15:25,900
Accept this sari and vote us, please.

1983
02:15:25,965 --> 02:15:28,000
Stitch a blouse from that sari
and make your wife wear it. Go away.

1984
02:15:28,065 --> 02:15:30,267
''Hail lord Shiva.''

1985
02:15:30,365 --> 02:15:32,200
Sir, what's your qualification?

1986
02:15:32,665 --> 02:15:36,435
lf l win the election this time,
l'll surely become the chief minister.

1987
02:15:36,699 --> 02:15:40,035
Why do l need to be educated for that?

1988
02:15:40,098 --> 02:15:43,434
Sir, if a doctor
has to treat a patient..

1989
02:15:43,498 --> 02:15:45,233
..he should study
17 yean to become one.

1990
02:15:45,298 --> 02:15:47,033
lf they have to build a building,,

1991
02:15:47,098 --> 02:15:49,200
..he should study for
16 yean to become an engineer.

1992
02:15:49,398 --> 02:15:52,667
You want to progress our county..

1993
02:15:52,732 --> 02:15:54,600
..you are asking us why
do you need qualification.

1994
02:15:54,699 --> 02:15:57,301
Our county will never progress
if it has politicians like you.

1995
02:16:04,565 --> 02:16:05,832
People have changed.

1996
02:16:05,999 --> 02:16:08,835
Sir, it is not people who
have changed, but Jogi changed them.

1997
02:16:08,899 --> 02:16:11,101
I I I I
Jogayya.

1998
02:16:12,065 --> 02:16:14,167

''You can't hold a
sword in your hands.''

2004
02:16:33,632 --> 02:16:36,267
''Jogi is here.
You can't stand here now.''

2005
02:16:36,365 --> 02:16:39,334
''Run!''

2006
02:16:39,398 --> 02:16:42,300
''Run!''

2007
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:45,434
''This earth is full of cheaters.''

2008
02:16:45,498 --> 02:16:48,868
''We don't want anything.
Come with me.''

2009
02:16:49,332 --> 02:16:51,667
I I I I
Come to me as Jogi.

2010

Onta, looks like you are leaving.

2013
02:17:00,598 --> 02:17:02,733
l'm going to pilgrimage
with my wife and children.

2014
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:04,700
Say that you are fleeing
from this village.

2015
02:17:25,799 --> 02:17:28,468
''He enters the area like a lion.''

2016
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:31,501
''He orden that the
village belongs to him.''

2017
02:17:31,598 --> 02:17:32,665
''Run!''

2018
02:17:34,565 --> 02:17:35,966
''Run!''

2019
02:17:37,965 --> 02:17:40,867
''He sits alone on a chair
admits the people in an area.''

2020
02:17:40,932 --> 02:17:43,801
''The people who fear him run haywire.''

2021
02:17:43,899 --> 02:17:44,866
''Run!''

2022
02:17:46,598 --> 02:17:48,032
''Run!''

2023
02:17:49,932 --> 02:17:52,768
''The kings have built many palaces.''

2024
02:17:52,965 --> 02:17:56,601
''All the kings have died now.''

2025
02:17:56,865 --> 02:17:59,167
''Come to me as a philanthropist.''

2026
02:17:59,231 --> 02:18:02,267
''Run!''

2027
02:18:02,332 --> 02:18:05,635
''Run!''
