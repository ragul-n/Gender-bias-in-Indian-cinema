1
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,208
Pawan. At this hour.

2
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,416
Have you seen the time, Pawan?

3
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,375
Is this the time...

4
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,458
What are you saying?

5
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,958
Are you sure?

6
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
I see.

7
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,500
Fine, I am coming.

8
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,791
Coming.

9
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,583
Sir, this is Mr. Shikhawat.
The morgue's manager.

10
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,375
This is a weird case.

11
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,875
Did you check all the units?

12
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,333
All the others are fine, except for one

13
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,000
which we reported to you.

14
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,833
Did you check anything
on the CCTV footage?

15
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,375
Keith is checking that.

16
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,708
Who was on duty?

17
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
The security guard. Tara Singh.

18
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,458
Did you record his statement?

19
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,208
He's scared.
He isn't saying anything.

20
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,875
What do you mean by that? Where is he?

21
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,500
He's there.

22
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,583
-Tara Singh.
-Yes?

23
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,000
-What did you see here?
-Tell him what you saw.

24
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,958
I was sitting at my desk
watching a movie on my cellphone.

25
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,250
<span style="style.center_1">-Come on. Take it.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Alcohol...</span>

26
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,833
<span style="style.center_1">I always obeyed my parents.</span>

27
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,375
Who's there?

28
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,375
Who's there?

29
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,791
Who's there?

30
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,416
Who's there?

31
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,208
Ghost!

32
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,375
Ghost!

33
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,583
The lock was broken from outside.

34
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,708
But no one came here from outside, sir.

35
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,541
How would you know?
You were busy watching a movie.

36
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,166
This is not some outsider's job, sir.

37
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,291
The dead woke up and walked out.

38
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,000
Honestly, sir.

39
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,875
Let me go, please.

40
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
I told you everything I saw.

41
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,458
Why would the ghost
have to break the lock?

42
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,000
He can walk right through closed doors.

43
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,583
Sir, he can also come back.

44
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,375
-Sir, please let me go.
-I see.

45
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,125
Until we see the CCTV footage,
no one's going anywhere.

46
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,375
By the way, whose body was it?

47
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,583
Sir, do you know Maya Verma?

48
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,166
-Ion Industries?
-Yes.

49
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,875
She died this morning
due to a heart attack.

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
The autopsy is still pending.

51
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,625
Which doctor attended to her?

52
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,708
Dr. Tanya Mehra, sir.
We've called her here.

53
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,666
One more thing.
How trustworthy is Tara Singh?

54
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,916
All I can say is that he's the only one
who volunteered for night duty.

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
I can't lose him, sir.

56
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,791
It's hard to find people.

57
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
Sir, should we check the elevator?

58
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,625
Does Tara Singh do alcohol or drugs?

59
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,458
No, sir, I never saw him
do such a thing.

60
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,875
We can always do an alcohol test.

61
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,250
-Should we?
-Go ahead.

62
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,333
And don't let the media
find out about this.

63
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,625
I am talking to you.

64
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,916
Sir, the hard disk's been taken out.

65
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,666
There are no recordings of tonight.

66
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,875
Why is this screen empty? The rest are...

67
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,125
Sir! Some cameras are out of order.

68
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,208
Why didn't you
replace those cameras?

69
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,750
I've already applied for it, sir.

70
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,458
This is a government building after all.
You know it takes time.

71
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,750
Blow harder.

72
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,250
How can the computer
hard disk get stolen?

73
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,583
Sir, please let me go.

74
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,833
Robert.

75
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,666
His breath analyzer test is clear.

76
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,875
The dead can't get up on
their own and walk away.

77
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,583
Someone broke in and stole the body.

78
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,000
At what time did the death occur?

79
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,375
4:30 in the evening.

80
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,750
She returned this morning from Los Angeles
after a business meeting.

81
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,500
Tell me something about her family.

82
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,041
Her family is based in Mumbai.

83
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,416
She was born in Mauritius.

84
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,125
Except for her husband, there are
no other members in her family.

85
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,375
She was about 18
when her father passed away.

86
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,500
Mr. Ajay Puri.

87
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
But, Maya Verma...

88
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,791
Yes, sir. Maya Verma didn't
change her name after her wedding.

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
What does Mr. Puri do?

90
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
He's the Director at Maya's laboratory.

91
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,791
He also teaches at the university
as a visiting professor.

92
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,625
Where was the body found?

93
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,416
-Maya Verma's house.
-And who found it?

94
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Ajay Puri.

95
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,833
Ajay Puri?

96
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,541
Let's begin with the wedding rituals.

97
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,625
No.

98
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,958
Maya!

99
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,333
What's wrong?

100
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,375
I don't want to get married.

101
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,958
It's not funny.

102
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
This is no time for jokes.

103
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,833
Is it something I did?

104
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,500
You are responsible for this.

105
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,208
-What is it?
-I know why you're marrying me.

106
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,708
It's for my money.

107
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,166
Why are you embarrassing me
in front of all these people?

108
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,625
You should have said this before.

109
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,791
If I had said it before,
how would this be a memorable wedding?

110
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,541
Come on.

111
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:20,916
Come on.

112
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,458
<span style="style.center_1">Every inch of me</span>

113
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,708
<span style="style.center_1">Every inch of me</span>

114
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,416

115
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,625

116
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,625
<span style="style.center_1">You're my moonlit nights</span>

117
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,958

118
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,875
<span style="style.center_1">My love for you is eternal</span>

119
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,958
<span style="style.center_1">And I have no way to express it</span>

120
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,000
<span style="style.center_1">You'll never find another lover</span>

121
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,791
<span style="style.center_1">Like me</span>

122
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:14,208

125
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:27,083
<span style="style.center_1">-Every inch of me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Is madly in love</span>

126
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:47,208
<span style="style.center_1">I am lost somewhere</span>

127
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,291
<span style="style.center_1">In the plethora of memories</span>

128
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,291
<span style="style.center_1">And I have no sense</span>

129
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,541
<span style="style.center_1">Of where I am</span>

130
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,708
<span style="style.center_1">My breathing is hard,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And my heart is restless</span>

131
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,791
<span style="style.center_1">And even in my restless heart,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The only image that dwells is you</span>

132
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,916
<span style="style.center_1">My love for you is eternal</span>

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,916

134
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,166

135
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,041

00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:28,416

00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,041
<span style="style.center_1">Every inch of me</span>

153
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,333
<span style="style.center_1">Every inch of me</span>

00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,416
<span style="style.center_1">Every inch of me</span>

155
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,625
Brother.

156
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,041
Brother.

157
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,625
Everyone came and left.

158
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,875
You could've at least thanked them.

159
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,916
By the way,
I don't know why you're so upset.

160
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,458
Shaina, please leave me alone.

161
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,500
And go back home.

162
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,875
By the way, you know something.

163
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,916
Ajay.

164
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,250
You should've called before coming here.

165
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,041
Don't worry. No one saw me.

166
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,750
Did anyone get suspicious?

167
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,791
I couldn't stay away from you anymore.

168
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,833
I had to come.

169
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,166
Are you okay?

170
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,875
I feel lonely
when you're not around.

171
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,958
Everything will be fine.

172
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,791
It must be someone wanting
to express his condolences.

173
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,208
I don't want to answer it.

174
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,333
What do you mean?

175
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,291
Who is this?

176
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,291
Look.

177
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,916
Fine, I am coming.

178
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,500
What happened? Who was that?

179
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,916
Maya's body has disappeared
from the morgue.

180
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,250
Disappeared?

181
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,375
Did someone steal her body?

182
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,875
-Why would anyone steal her body?
-I don't know, Ritu.

183
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,583
Maybe the police made a mistake.

184
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
Bodies can't just disappear.

185
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,458
I'll go and put an end to
this drama once and for all.

186
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,291
Do you have to go?

187
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,500
If I don't go,
the police will get suspicious.

188
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,625
Yeah! Mr. Puri.

189
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,416
-Are you the one who called me?
-Yes, I did call you.

190
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,458
Where is my wife's body?

191
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,000
We checked the entire facility,
but we couldn't find the body.

192
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,250
How can it just disappear?

193
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,875
This is a secure facility, isn't it?

194
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,458
What have you all been doing?

195
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,666
We're still investigating--

196
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,500
The cremation is tomorrow.
People are going to come over.

197
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,500
Do you understand?

198
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,875
Mr. Ajay Puri.

199
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,583
We're trying our level best, sir.

200
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,875
We need a little cooperation from you.

201
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,208
Okay, do your job.

202
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,416
But I'll stay here
until the body is found.

203
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,375
Where were you?

204
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,791
I'm sorry, I am SP Jairaj Rawal.

205
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,458
-Where were you?
-At home.

206
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,500
Really? We sent a guard,
he said there was no one there.

207
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,083
That's why we had to call.

208
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,041
Yeah, I had a headache so
I went out to get some medication.

209
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,250
I see.

210
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,250
Don't you have a servant or a driver
to run this kind of errand for you?

211
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,333
-I needed some fresh air.
-Yeah.

212
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,541
Which chemist was this?

213
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,541
I asked which chemist this was.

214
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,125
-I went to a 24-hour chemist close by.
-I see.

215
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,333
I want to ask you a few questions.

216
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,333
Why?

217
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,000
The body is missing.

218
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,791
And she won't walk out on her own,
Mr. Ajay Puri.

219
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,875
That means, someone stole her body.

220
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:32,041
Someone definitely wants to
hurt your wife even after she's dead.

221
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,791
Was someone bothering her?

222
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,750
Or, maybe some grudge...

223
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:41,833
No.

224
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,500
And how does it matter?

225
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,625
Why would anyone steal her body?

226
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,708
What would you do with your enemy?

227
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,833
Look, Inspector.

228
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,333
SP Jairaj Rawal.

229
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,791
SP.

230
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,958
Everyone in Port Louis knows
that we are decent people.

231
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,875
You can ask your boss as well.
He knows us pretty well.

232
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,166
And rather than asking me questions

233
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,333
go and look for the body.

234
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,291
Mr. Puri.

235
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,958
Don't you find all this weird?

236
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,375
Have you seen the CCTV footage?

237
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,916
The CCTV's hard disk is missing as well.

238
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,041
Has a body ever gone missing before?

239
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,541
She owned many businesses.

240
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:00,875
In her position, personal and
social relationships are very delicate.

241
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,583
Think hard.

242
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,833
Anyone who...

243
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,083
There is no one.

244
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,291
Think hard.

245
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,625
I did.

246
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,333
There is no one.

247
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,250
And you?

248
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,750
What about me?

249
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,000
Did you have a grudge with someone
who might want to get back at you?

250
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,000
Not at all.

251
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,291
How is your headache now?

252
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,291
I'm feeling great.

253
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,500
I feel refreshed
after meeting you guys.

254
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,291
You have to wait,
I have some more questions for you.

255
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,750
Why?

256
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:53,916
Because there are no 24-hour
chemist shops around here, Mr. Puri.

257
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,875
Yeah, Ritu.

258
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,500
Did they find the body?

259
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,541
No. But you must do something for me.

260
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,000
<span style="style.center_1">The investigating officer</span>
<span style="style.center_1">is very skeptical.</span>

261
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,958
His name is SP Jairaj Rawal.

262
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,291
Find out everything you can about him.

263
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,833
Ajay, you can do
this job better than me.

264
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,083
You know a lot of people
who are in the police force.

265
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:22,083
I don't know anyone, Maya did.

266
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,625
I don't think I can find out anything.

267
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,166
Please, honey.

268
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,333
Check it on the internet.

269
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,166
Maybe you'll find something there.

270
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,875
Why don't you just come back?

271
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,541
I can't budge from here.

272
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:37,208
No, honey, but I am being questioned.

273
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,750
Listen, I'll call you back, okay.

274
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,958
I had to come.
I've never come across a case like this.

275
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,583
Prima facie investigation
reveals a heart attack.

276
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,750
I can only confirm after an autopsy.

277
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,500
She was scared of flying.

278
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,333
And she took a long flight
from LA this morning.

279
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:17,958
Sometimes, the stress of a long flight
can lead to a heart attack.

280
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,000
The body's missing.

281
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,625
So there can be no autopsy.

282
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,166
There is another possibility.

283
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,291
What is that?

284
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,541
Catalepsy.

285
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,916
Do you actually believe that
the dead body is not really a dead body?

286
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,958
Catalepsy?

287
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:40,000
In medical terms,
ghosts are called catalepsy.

288
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,291
Even after 12 hours of being
declared dead, people have come back.

289
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,500
Fine, even if I believe you,
it makes no sense.

290
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,958
If she woke up, then why
didn't she make some sort of noise?

291
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,708
Why didn't she ask for help?
She just got up and disappeared.

292
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,791
Because she wasn't alive.

293
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,000
Someone stole her body.

294
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,333
If she died of a heart attack,

295
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,916
how will anyone benefit
from making the body disappear?

296
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,500
What?

297
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,875
The heart attack can be induced.

298
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:18,458
Through some sort of poison, or
through a very strong substance, right?

299
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,708
Do you think it was a murder?

300
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,541
This is an attempt
to avoid autopsy because

301
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,458
someone's trying to hide a murder.

302
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,041
And that's why you detained
Ajay Puri in the facility.

303
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:36,000
Did you notice him get emotional
while talking about his wife?

304
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,041
No.

305
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,375
It's been ten years since Nancy died.

306
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,208
And yet, I talk about
her like she's still here.

307
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,541
Whereas his wife died today.

308
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,250
If he wanted to make
the body disappear,

309
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,500
he would've done it before.

310
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,625
Why would he get the body to the morgue?

311
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,708
If he has murdered his wife,

312
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:02,333
making the body disappear
will only make things difficult for him.

313
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,375
-Right!
-You guys don't get it.

314
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,375
Try to understand Ajay's psychology.

315
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,708
He was afraid that the autopsy would
reveal the truth about the murder.

316
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,875
So, he made the same mistake
that all new criminals make.

317
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:18,125
He came back and
made the body disappear.

318
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,125
I am your junior, if I say anything--

319
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,500
Sir, I think you treat
every case very personally.

320
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:31,958
-What do you mean?
-You tend to get judgmental.

321
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,458
You met Mr. Puri for the first time.

322
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,166
And like always, you already
jumped to a conclusion

323
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,583
without any evidence, or witness.

324
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,750
Sir, the truth is,

325
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,833
you still haven't recovered
from the grief of Nancy's death.

326
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,791
It's been ten years
since that accident occurred.

327
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,250
That was not an accident.

328
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,958
Don't forget, Pawan.

329
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,833
He lied to us about the chemist.

330
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,833
-Okay.
-What happened?

331
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,500
Where is everyone?

332
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,791
Please sit inside.
Sir will speak to you when he gets back.

333
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,000
Have you seen the time?

334
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,625
Tell him I've to get home.

335
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,083
Yes, I know.

336
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,916
Do you even know who I am?

337
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,125
I do.

338
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,666
Take a seat, I'll go check what's wrong.

339
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,333
Where is yours?

340
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,750
I have to go to work.

341
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,125
So what?

342
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,041
I am not going to drink alone.

343
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,666
I am high on you.

344
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,875
Take your clothes off and climb in.

345
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,500
Maya, I just got a call from the lab.
I have to go.

346
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,750
It's been three weeks.

347
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:10,500
I need to talk to you about us.

348
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,625
Maya, I have a meeting.

349
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,291
Cancel it.

350
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,416
You're not answerable
to anyone except me.

351
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,833
I don't know whether I should
be happy, or embarrassed.

352
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:29,833
Were you happy, or embarrassed
with your job as a professor?

353
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,958
Are you counting your favors?

354
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,208
-Really?
-Yes.

355
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,375
If you want to repay them

356
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,875
take your clothes off and get in.

357
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,750
I want to go to work feeling happy.

358
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,166
Not upset, alright.

359
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,583
You haven't left yet.

360
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,125
I was looking for my car keys.
They were here somewhere.

361
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,833
I'm glad you didn't leave.

362
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,541
There's no need to go to work anymore.

363
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,291
Ajay won't come to the meeting today.

364
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,333
Maya.

365
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,333
Print his dismissal letter.

366
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,916
Maya, what are you doing?

367
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,416
Of course, I am serious.

368
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,666
It's my company, and I've decided.

369
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,958
What was that?

370
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:16,291
Now we can spend
the entire day together.

371
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,541
What?

372
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,583
I didn't call anyone.

373
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,125
Maya!

374
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,500
You get scared quite easily.

375
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,375
Let's have dinner tonight.

376
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,458
Finish work early and come home soon.

377
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,416
You'd be sleeping...

378
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,208
due to the jet lag.

379
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,125
I am not going to sleep.

380
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,000
Tonight, you're mine.

381
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,458
Sir, someone tampered with the fuse.

382
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,708
What are you doing in this room?

383
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,083
I heard some kind of noise.
Someone was here.

384
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,500
Those are Maya Verma's
personal belongings.

385
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,208
What were you looking for?

386
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:34,583
Nothing.

387
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,541
Keith.

388
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,416
I told you to wait outside.

389
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,291
Sir, the cellphone is missing.

390
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,416
Why are you asking me?

391
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Who else should I be asking? Your wife?

392
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,000
Empty your pockets.

393
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,916
Why would I take Maya's cellphone?

394
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,625
Will you do it?
Or, will I have to do it?

395
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,291
That's my cellphone, by the way.

396
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,333
-Now raise your hands.
-What?

397
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,500
-Raise your hands!
-But why?

398
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,291
Because I don't trust you.

399
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:17,958
Sir, he's right.

400
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,916
Let me do my job, Pawan.

401
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,250
What are you doing?

402
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,166
Please, we can't do this.

403
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,708
You will be answerable to my lawyers.

404
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:35,625
What is this?

405
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,791
First, answer this. What is this?

406
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,208
It was lying on the floor.
So, I picked it up.

407
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:53,250
The label belongs to your lab.

408
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,250
We supply products
to the morgue as well.

409
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,750
You can check any cabinet here.

410
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,291
You'll find many
of our products here.

411
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,583
What is TH16?

412
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,708
-It's a medicine.
-What kind of medicine?

413
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,708
I'll have to check. We manufacture
many kinds of medicine.

414
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,666
You manufacture medicines
and don't know what this is.

415
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,666
-I know, but...
-But?

416
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,208
I don't know what it exactly is.

417
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,250
I don't know.

418
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,833
This is not my department.

419
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,458
It's my sister calling.
She must be worried.

420
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,041
Yeah, Shaina.

421
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,791
Ajay, I found an
article on the internet.

422
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,750
<span style="style.center_1">-SP Jairaj Rawal is...</span>
-Shaina.

423
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,541
I am fine, but Maya's body is missing.

424
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,291
You can't talk right now?

425
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:28,791
What's going on?

426
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,583
I'll call you later.

427
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,166
Don't you save your sister's number?

428
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,583
It's her new number.

429
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,000
She must have got it today.

430
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,625
Can I use the bathroom?

431
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,125
My belongings?

432
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,458
Ritu.

433
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:21,750
Hurry up, I don't have time.

434
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,916
Some journalist has written

435
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,500
-a pretty big article on Jairaj Rawal.
<span style="style.center_1">-Okay.</span>

436
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:28,625
Jairaj Rawal was suspended
for a few days for an alcohol problem.

437
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,291
Later, he was transferred here.

438
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,000
His wife is dead and
his daughter left him.

439
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,125
He was undergoing counseling
for a few days.

440
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:38,875
<span style="style.center_1">Rumors are that he sees his dead wife.</span>

441
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,250
I knew it.

442
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,875
He does look crazy to me.

443
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,166
What's going on there?

444
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,791
Ritu.

445
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,833
-Someone knows something.
-What?

446
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,458
Who? The police?

447
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,375
I am not afraid of the police.

448
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,000
Someone broke into Maya's locker
and stole her cellphone.

449
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,958
And the TH16 bottle which
I threw away was in the locker.

450
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,291
Now the police have it.

451
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,541
But how is that possible?

452
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,541
-Did you tell the police anything?
-Have you lost your mind, Ritu?

453
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,000
But they will make you spill it.

454
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,833
<span style="style.center_1">Get out of there.</span>

455
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,875
The bigger problem is that

456
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:18,625
except for us, only Maya could've
known what's happening with her.

457
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,125
And she is dead.

458
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:22,208
<span style="style.center_1">I did everything right.</span>

459
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,666
There was no chance
she could have survived.

460
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,041
Ajay.

461
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,083
Could she have survived?

462
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:52,750
Do you believe that I get
emotional about my cases?

463
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,125
Stop looking at everyone
as the murderer.

464
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,000
Sometimes, accidents do occur.

465
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,625
But that was not an accident.

466
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,625
Maybe.

467
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,458
But his wife had a heart attack.

468
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,500
Stop looking for the murderer,
and look for the body, Jairaj.

469
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,916
<span style="style.center_1">I love you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">So says my heart</span>

470
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,125
<span style="style.center_1">Whether I am alive or not</span>

471
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:16,333
<span style="style.center_1">I love you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">So says my heart</span>

472
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:21,583
<span style="style.center_1">Whether I am alive or not</span>

473
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:27,583
<span style="style.center_1">Say it once for me</span>

474
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,125
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

475
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,708
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

476
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:39,750
Ajay.

477
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,083
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

478
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,833
You're late again.

479
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:47,333
Yeah, there was an accident in the lab,
so it took a while.

480
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,250
I called at the office.

481
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,916
Kriti said that you
left in the afternoon.

482
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,416
-Really?
-Yes.

483
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,916
-I went out to collect the samples.
-I tried your cellphone as well.

484
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,041
My cellphone was in my briefcase
and the briefcase was in the car.

485
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,750
I am sorry, Maya,
I didn't see your calls.

486
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:07,875
Wait.

487
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,500
<span style="style.center_1">Your body's fragrance...</span>

488
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,000
There's something here.

489
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,125
What is it?

490
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,916
Grey hair.

491
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,791
What did you think?

492
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,208
You're taking a lot
of stress these days.

493
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,666
-Who is it?
-Shaina.

494
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,875
Shaina, I've been
calling you for so long.

495
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,250
But you don't answer my calls.

496
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,166
<span style="style.center_1">So says my heart...</span>

497
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,708
I am with Maya right now.

498
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,250
We're in the middle
of an important discussion.

499
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,625
Can I call you later?

500
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,500
Shaina was thinking about you.

501
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:05,125
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

502
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,083
It's hard for me to admit...

503
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:18,833
that our relationship
is no longer what it used to be.

504
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,416
It's grown stronger.

505
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,791
And yet, you come home late.

506
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,500
Maya, what's wrong?

507
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:38,000
The song has made me sentimental.

508
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I started thinking about us.

509
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,250
I am afraid of losing you.

510
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,125
You won't leave me, will you?

511
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,791
You won't leave me, will you?

512
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,375
I won't.

513
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:18,083
<span style="style.center_1">My destiny has</span>

514
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:23,625
<span style="style.center_1">Only your name written all over it</span>

515
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,166
<span style="style.center_1">Believe me</span>

516
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,375
<span style="style.center_1">When I say it</span>

517
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:36,625
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

518
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:41,916
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

519
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,125
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

520
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:52,625
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

521
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,958
<span style="style.center_1">Love me...</span>

522
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:52,041
<span style="style.center_1">Beyond my imagination</span>

523
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,083
He's in the toilet.

524
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:58,083
<span style="style.center_1">Love me beyond my imagination</span>

525
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,750
Mr. Puri.

526
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:15,916
Mr. Puri.

527
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,333
Mr. Puri.

528
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:24,500
Yes!

529
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,458
Mr. Puri.

530
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,541
Sir is calling you.

531
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,416
Come with me.

532
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,166
-I am feeling dizzy.
-Now!

533
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,333
Dammit!

534
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,041
Give me a minute.

535
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,416
Mr. Puri.

536
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,291
Mr. Puri, come out, please.

537
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,833
Are you coming out,
or should I come inside?

538
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,958
You were in there
for quite a lot of time.

539
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,166
I am not feeling well.

540
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:40,791
I want to go home.

541
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:42,708
Okay.

542
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,375
Come with us. We found a clue.

543
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,666
The footprints are fresh.

544
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,541
Careful.

545
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,375
This is the only clue we have.

546
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,083
What clue is this?

547
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,583
Don't you know?

548
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,125
How would I know?

549
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,333
Yes, that's true.

550
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:13,416
Actually, the body has
been dragged through here.

551
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,916
Tara Singh told us that
there's a back door this way.

552
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,291
That is how we found out.

553
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:25,250
These shoe marks are absolutely fresh.

554
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:28,958
By the way, can you show me your shoes?

555
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:30,041
Why?

556
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:32,458
I like them, so I just...

557
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,083
You can't afford them.

558
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,375
I know, sir,
that's why I want to see yours.

559
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:41,041
Have you seen this place?
My feet will get dirty.

560
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,666
You don't have to audition
for a movie after this.

561
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,416
Take them off.
Let me see them, please.

562
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,916
I get it.

563
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,166
Take a look.
My sole's completely different.

564
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,625
So you have nothing to worry about.
Take them off.

565
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,791
Here.

566
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:11,250
Pawan, pay up.

567
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:13,791
You lost the bet. Now pay up.

568
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,333
We had a bet.

569
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:18,791
I told him that your shoes
will definitely fit this mark.

570
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:23,166
I am not the only person in this
world who wears a size 43 shoe.

571
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:25,916
Note that down.

572
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,208
Keith, bring him inside.

573
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:43,750
Okay.

574
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:07,291
It is said that the names which are
written on sand get easily washed off.

575
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,416
Their love is not true.

576
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,583
Look!

577
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,875
I knew it.

578
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,375
What?

579
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,625
That your love is not true.

580
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,708
You're sounding like a child.

581
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:27,083
Maya!

582
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,000
This is just a delusion, nothing more.

583
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:36,166
Did you bring me here for this surprise?

584
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,750
Yes.

585
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,458
I am leaving, bye.

586
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,291
Where are you going?

587
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,333
Maya.

588
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:55,916
That's my car.

589
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,041
Unlock the car, please.

590
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,125
Take your own car.

591
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,750
There's a limit to jokes.

592
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,291
So that was the surprise.

593
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,000
Isn't it perfect?

594
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,000
<span style="style.center_1">I want to be in front of you</span>

595
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:08,416
<span style="style.center_1">Make me your mirror</span>

596
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,291
<span style="style.center_1">You're the definition</span>

597
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:17,791
<span style="style.center_1">Of everything I say</span>

598
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:22,000
<span style="style.center_1">Blame me if you want</span>

599
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:26,291
<span style="style.center_1">Or complain if you like</span>

600
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,791
<span style="style.center_1">I'll bear every pain</span>

601
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:34,875
<span style="style.center_1">Only for your sake</span>

602
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:39,125
<span style="style.center_1">I want to be in front of you</span>

603
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:43,500
<span style="style.center_1">Make me your mirror</span>

604
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:46,833
<span style="style.center_1">You're the definition</span>

605
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:51,916
<span style="style.center_1">Of everything I say</span>

606
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:14,333
<span style="style.center_1">You are my passion</span>

607
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:17,375
<span style="style.center_1">Since I met you</span>

608
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:22,583
<span style="style.center_1">I found my salvation</span>

609
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:27,083
<span style="style.center_1">And that's when</span>

610
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:31,666
<span style="style.center_1">The happiness in your eyes</span>

611
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,875
<span style="style.center_1">Reflected on my lips permanently</span>

612
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:39,250
<span style="style.center_1">And I found my love</span>

613
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:44,708
<span style="style.center_1">Become my destiny</span>

614
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,375
<span style="style.center_1">I've come to hold you</span>

615
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,875
<span style="style.center_1">Hold you</span>

616
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:54,166
<span style="style.center_1">I want to be in front of you</span>

617
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,500
<span style="style.center_1">Make me your mirror</span>

618
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:01,833
<span style="style.center_1">You're the definition</span>

619
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:06,750
<span style="style.center_1">Of everything I say</span>

620
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,291
Why is it taking so long, Keith?

621
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,166
Let's go.

622
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:26,000
How did the sprinklers come on?

623
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,458
Go and check the switch panels.

624
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,375
Come on, everybody,
let's go to the lobby.

625
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,750
I can't talk right now.

626
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:42,375
Ritu, stop calling me.
Or else, we'll get caught.

627
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:45,750
You can't imagine the condition I am in.

628
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,583
-Where are you?
-I am coming to you.

629
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:49,708
Don't be crazy.

630
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:52,000
I'll tell the police
that you didn't do anything.

631
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,333
You were with me.

632
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,458
Turn the car around.

633
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,333
-No.
-Ritu, turn the car around.

634
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,583
I am going back.

635
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,708
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay...</span>

636
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,000
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay!</span>

637
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,416
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay.</span>

638
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,041
She's somewhere around.

639
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,458
I can feel her, Ritu.

640
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:37,166
She is dead, Ajay.

641
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,291
That's what we think.

642
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,416
Maybe she knew that I
was going to poison her.

643
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,666
<span style="style.center_1">And this is her trick.</span>

644
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,500
Stop scaring yourself.

645
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,500
Ritu, why is this happening?

646
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,500
Why doesn't she leave me alone
even after she's dead?

647
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,958
-She just sent me a note.
-What?

648
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,708
Ritu, she must have
seen all your messages.

649
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,666
Maybe she knew about us.

650
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,208
Does she know...

651
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:14,541
You must hide.

652
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,583
I think your life is in danger.

653
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,833
<span style="style.center_1">Maya is planning all this.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">She isn't dead.</span>

654
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:21,416
<span style="style.center_1">-She is planning to kill us.</span>
-How can she plan all this on her own?

655
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,583
Someone's helping her.

656
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,500
-Who?
-I don't know.

657
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,541
But right now she can
do anything she wants.

658
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,208
And no one's going to catch her.

659
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:32,875
<span style="style.center_1">To hell with her money.</span>

660
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,416
<span style="style.center_1">To hell with everyone else.</span>

661
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,791
Get out of there.

662
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,208
Let's go somewhere far away.

663
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:39,833
There's no one here.

664
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,458
-I must hang up now.
-Okay, sir.

665
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,500
Don't call me back.
I am deleting your call logs.

666
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,791
Take care of yourself.

667
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,583
Ajay...

668
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,500
I don't understand why you're upset.

669
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,541
Shaina. You're still awake?

670
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,708
-I am scared, brother.
-What happened?

671
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:30,583
Sometimes, I see a dream
that feels like reality.

672
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,416
What happened?

673
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,833
I dreamt that Maya tried to kill me.

674
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:39,083
It seemed very real.

675
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,541
Brother, I am still suffocating.

676
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,250
That was not a dream.
She is alive.

677
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,416
-How is that possible?
-How do I explain it to you?

678
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:54,041
Keep your doors and windows closed.

679
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,958
I'll see you in the morning.

680
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:58,083
<span style="style.center_1">-Where are you?</span>
-I...

681
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,333
Talking to your sister?

682
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,916
-Yes, it's her.
<span style="style.center_1">-Brother.</span>

683
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,291
She must be worried.

684
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,833
Do you want to talk to her?

685
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:13,458
It got disconnected.

686
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,916
You will stay right here.
I'll be right back.

687
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,583
-You can't take my phone.
-Says who?

688
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,958
Listen! Where are you going?

689
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,166
Sir, someone triggered the fire alarm.

690
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,583
What's going on here?

691
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,500
I checked. It was his sister who called.

692
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:56,333
Doesn't he know anyone else
except his sister?

693
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,875
Sir, do you still think
he's hiding something?

694
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,500
He's hiding a murder!

695
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,208
But you won't believe me.

696
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,625
The lab report for TH16 has arrived.

697
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,166
Good, read it.

698
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:15,625
It is a cardio-toxin made from the venom
of a snake called the Taiwan cobra.

699
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,875
And it's used in anti-cancer
medicines in very minute proportions.

700
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:22,291
Is that all?

701
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:23,625
There must be more. Read ahead.

702
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:27,416
No, sir. It's a very lethal drug.

703
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,250
And if it's induced in the body, it can
cause a heart attack in eight hours.

704
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,750
What did I tell you?

705
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:41,666
Where are you going, sir?

706
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,583
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay.</span>

707
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,750
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay.</span>

708
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,041
<span style="style.center_1">Tonight, you're mine.</span>

709
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,375
<span style="style.center_1">Mine.</span>

710
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,833
<span style="style.center_1">Only mine.</span>

711
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,666
Now you know that I am the reason
behind everything that happened.

712
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,708
How did I get here?

713
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,916
This is where it all started.

714
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,666
And this is where it will end.

715
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,333
What do you want?

716
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:16,500
I want to have a drink with you.

717
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:27,875
What's in it?

718
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:32,041
Whatever it is, it's in both the glasses.

719
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,666
Maya, I am not a murderer.

720
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,958
I don't know what came over me.

721
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,583
You're such a coward. It's just wine.

722
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:05,958
Maya.

723
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:10,541
Please don't hurt her.
It's not her fault.

724
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,333
She was just...

725
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,666
She...

726
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,791
Ajay, this was my last prank.

727
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:06,916
SP?

728
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,250
Is anybody there?

729
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,375
Maya.

730
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:07,250
Maya.

731
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:09,291
She forgot her phone here.

732
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,291
Who is this?

733
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,916
This is the waitress
at the Trinity Night Club.

734
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,916
How did you get this phone?

735
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,666
This phone belongs to my wife.

736
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,541
She passed away today morning.

737
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,416
We used to visit that
club quite frequently.

738
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,125
My wife is 29 years old.

739
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,666
She is slim and tall.

740
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,250
She is dead, isn't she?

741
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,416
She could be alive.

742
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:30,916
She has big eyes.

743
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,375
-And she always orders red wine.
<span style="style.center_1">-I don't know.</span>

744
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,250
Her friend called.

745
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,041
And he's coming over
to collect her phone.

746
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,083
Which friend?

747
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,291
<span style="style.center_1">I don't know.</span>

748
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,541
Try to remember, please.

749
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,333
Tony?

750
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,458
Who was that?

751
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:23,666
No one.

752
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,416
Who was he, Maya?

753
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,791
You were talking to him about me,
weren't you?

754
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,333
We were talking about business.

755
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:32,625
Don't lie to me.

756
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,000
You won't like it,
but he's my new lawyer.

757
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,458
New lawyer.

758
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,750
I need some changes in the asset
division of our marriage contract.

759
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,541
There you go again with your jokes.

760
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,458
Laugh all you want,
but you will regret it later.

761
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,500
Do you want everyone under your feet?

762
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:03,625
Not everyone...

763
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,250
just you.

764
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:20,916
I can't help myself,
it's so easy to fool you.

765
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:23,666
So, he is not your lawyer.

766
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,333
No. He's my psychologist.

767
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,708
-You need one.
-Don't get angry.

768
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,958
I don't understand
your sense of humor.

769
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:34,875
Okay.

770
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,833
My wife is seeing a psychologist
and I don't know anything about it.

771
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,125
What's wrong with you?

772
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:42,083
Love.

773
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,250
I love you.

774
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,500
And it's driving me crazy.

775
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,375
Ritu.

776
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,041
Whose number is this?

777
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,333
Listen.

778
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:24,208
I found a random phone that has
calls coming in from Maya's number.

779
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,625
Ajay... I am scared.

780
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,208
Come back soon,
and let's go somewhere far away.

781
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:35,458
Listen carefully.

782
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:38,791
Some guy called Tony is coming to
Trinity Night Club to collect her phone.

783
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,958
Is this important?

784
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,583
Why is this phone here?

785
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,333
And why does it have
only Maya's number?

786
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:45,708
Why did it ring now?

787
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:48,458
Why did the waitress answer the call
when I called back?

788
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,166
Slow down, I am confused.

789
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,166
Maya wants to say something.

790
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,375
What are you saying?

791
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,583
Ritu.
You have to find out who Tony is.

792
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:02,125
<span style="style.center_1">He's helping Maya.</span>

793
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,083
And then what?

794
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,000
Then, I promise, we'll leave everything
and go somewhere far away.

795
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:07,833
Just do this one last job for me.

796
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:11,625
Go to Trinity Night Club
and follow Maya's new friend.

797
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:36,208
Sir, the door was open.

798
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,000
But I locked him in.

799
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:40,541
What?

800
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:42,000
Do I carry a duplicate key?

801
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:44,375
No, you carry poison.

802
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,208
What do you think?

803
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,416
You can arrest me and
my lawyers will do nothing?

804
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,791
I think you're going to cooperate.

805
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:54,291
You're taking advantage
of my politeness.

806
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,333
Then kindly take a seat.

807
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,666
What else is there to talk about?

808
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,291
You know...

809
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,041
you killed your wife
by poisoning her with TH16.

810
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,583
And then you made the body disappear
so that you can escape the autopsy.

811
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:21,416
Am I right?

812
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,583
You're in the wrong profession.

813
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,083
You should have been a fiction writer.

814
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,208
And you should have been in jail.

815
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:30,500
I've done nothing.

816
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,000
TH16 is produced in your lab.

817
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,833
We found it in your pocket.

818
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,291
It causes a heart attack.

819
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:38,916
Your wife died of a cardiac arrest.

820
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,250
And you say you
haven't done anything.

821
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:41,625
Do you think I am stupid?

822
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,416
Do you think I am stupid?

823
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,625
If I had poisoned her,

824
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,375
why would I be carrying the
bottle in front of the police?

825
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:53,375
You don't have any
evidence against me.

826
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,875
You have no idea what we have.

827
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,541
Then find Maya's body.

828
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,958
Fine, tell me.

829
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,333
How did you meet your wife?

830
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,833
Why?

831
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,875
Trying to be my friend?

832
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,125
Is this a date?

833
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,041
I don't befriend murderers.
How did the two of you meet?

834
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:14,666
Why?

835
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,958
Because you have no stature
to marry a girl like her.

836
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,791
You have no stature
to talk to me like that.

837
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:23,791
She loved me.

838
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,916
And you loved her money.

839
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:27,166
I see.

840
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:28,916
What else do you know about me?

841
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,166
I know that you smile when you lie.

842
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:36,000
The smile is a crooked one.

843
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:39,875
When did you see her
for the last time?

844
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:42,791
This morning.

845
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,166
And you're not sad about losing her?

846
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:47,416
Not at all?

847
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:51,208
I've already cried a lot.

848
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,166
Really? Then be prepared
to cry some more.

849
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:59,666
Your wife hired a
detective three months ago.

850
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:02,791
I found this agreement
from her lawyer.

851
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,000
It's between her and the detective.

852
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,333
She also changed
the marriage contract.

853
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,291
What is it called?

854
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:19,708
I need some changes in the asset
division of our marriage contract.

855
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:23,416
According to your
new marriage agreement...

856
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,541
if you get divorced...

857
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:29,833
none of the companies
would pay you anything.

858
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:35,125
What was that detective looking for?

859
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,791
And only you know the answer to that.

860
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,750
But before your wife
could divorce you,

861
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,041
you killed her.

862
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:45,791
We'll prove this.

863
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,708
Pawan's gone to get Tony D'Costa.

864
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,416
He's dead.

865
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:00,333
I am telling you he's dead.

866
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:01,416
Take a look.

867
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:05,708
He was right here.

868
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,041
He was here.

869
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,416
I just saw the body.

870
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,250
How far are we
on the arrest warrant?

871
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:41,875
We're on it, sir.
And it will be done soon.

872
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,083
Ritu, why did you
call me on this number?

873
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:00,750
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay, it's over.</span>

874
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,458
What's wrong, honey?

875
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,375
Get out of there!

876
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:07,000
Tell me what's wrong.

877
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:09,041
Tony D'Costa is Maya's detective.

878
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:10,083
I know.

879
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,041
Did you find him?

880
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:12,000
No.

881
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:13,583
He found me.

882
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,083
<span style="style.center_1">There was an envelope</span>
<span style="style.center_1">lying outside my door.</span>

883
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:17,333
It contained a pen drive.

884
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:18,666
Wait a second.

885
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,750
Is his name written on the envelope?

886
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:21,833
There was no name on it.

887
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:25,250
But there's a folder on the pen drive
called D'Costa, and it has...

888
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,083
<span style="style.center_1">I am sending you the contents.</span>

889
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:33,583
<span style="style.center_1">Ajay.</span>

890
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:34,750
Yes, I got them.

891
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,333
Yes.

892
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,250
There's more.

893
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:52,166
We were bugged.
Listen to this.

894
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,125
<span style="style.center_1">When will you do it?</span>

895
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:56,958
<span style="style.center_1">Maya's leaving for LA tomorrow.</span>

896
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,208
<span style="style.center_1">We'll have to do it</span>
<span style="style.center_1">as soon as she comes back.</span>

897
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,875
<span style="style.center_1">She is scared of flying.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">It stresses her out.</span>

898
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,875
<span style="style.center_1">And it can easily</span>
<span style="style.center_1">lead to a heart attack.</span>

899
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:09,416
Ritu, she knew about us.
This is her trick.

900
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:12,000
She wants you to know.

901
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:12,916
Why?

902
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,166
Because she is crazy.

903
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,583
She wants to scare us.

904
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,875
Listen, get out of there right now.

905
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:20,958
Yes.

906
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,750
You know where to go.

907
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,458
I'll see you there.

908
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,000
But those people won't let you leave.

909
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,708
Your safety is more important.

910
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,625
<span style="style.center_1">But how will you get there?</span>

911
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,333
I'll be there.
Don't worry about me.

912
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,125
What has happened, Ajay?

913
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,625
Why did we ever meet?

914
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,125
What was that noise?

915
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:48,750
Ajay, the elevator...

916
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:49,916
Are you okay?

917
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,875
Listen, are you okay?

918
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,875
Someone's here, Ajay.

919
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:55,458
Someone...

920
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,750
Feels like someone else is here.

921
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,750
Ritu.

922
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:03,500
Ritu! Please stop thinking
about everything else.

923
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,583
I am with you.
I am there.

924
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:07,583
Please get here as soon as you can.

925
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,000
I am scared.

926
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,291
I love you, honey.

927
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,125
I can't live without you.

928
01:17:16,375 --> 01:17:17,458
Me neither.

929
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:19,458
Ajay!

930
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:20,375
Ritu.

931
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:24,541
Ritu.

932
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,375
Let me go!

933
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,458
Where is he going?

934
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,250
Let me go!

935
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,125
-What's going on here?
-Wait, Mr. Puri.

936
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:39,541
You are in my custody.

937
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:41,125
To hell with your orders.

938
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,333
Someone needs my help.

939
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:43,750
-Your help?
-Yes.

940
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,000
Who?

941
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,083
Who do you think you are?
You have no right to question me.

942
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:08,375
Well, the police will be there.

943
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,833
Tell me.

944
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:15,875
Who is this girl?

945
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:19,958
Why do you think that
someone wants to kill her?

946
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,791
<span style="style.center_1">I saw Ritu for the first time</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at the university.</span>

947
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:38,083
<span style="style.center_1">I had gone there for a lecture.</span>

948
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:40,250
<span style="style.center_1">It was not a special day.</span>

949
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:43,250
<span style="style.center_1">But after I saw her, it became special.</span>

950
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:50,958
<span style="style.center_1">I am familiar with your grace</span>

951
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:56,416
<span style="style.center_1">There are no secrets</span>

952
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:01,708
<span style="style.center_1">I can hear</span>

953
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:06,708
<span style="style.center_1">The voice that's forlorn</span>

954
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:14,833
<span style="style.center_1">I am familiar with your grace</span>

955
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:20,333
<span style="style.center_1">There are no secrets from me</span>

956
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:25,541
<span style="style.center_1">I can hear</span>

957
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:31,250
<span style="style.center_1">The voice that's forlorn</span>

958
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:37,625
<span style="style.center_1">I know there's a yes</span>

959
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:43,583
<span style="style.center_1">Hidden in your denial</span>

960
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:48,958
<span style="style.center_1">I know there's a yes</span>

961
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:55,541
<span style="style.center_1">Hidden in your denial</span>

962
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">The way you smile without a reason</span>

963
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:27,166
<span style="style.center_1">And keep forgetting things</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Without saying a thing</span>

964
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:32,541
<span style="style.center_1">Your hints, and your excuses</span>

965
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:37,708
<span style="style.center_1">For testing my patience</span>

966
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:43,541
<span style="style.center_1">This unheard saga</span>

967
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:50,166
<span style="style.center_1">That I just heard from you</span>

968
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:55,583
<span style="style.center_1">I know there's a yes</span>

969
01:20:55,666 --> 01:21:02,208
<span style="style.center_1">Hidden in your denial</span>

970
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,583
<span style="style.center_1">It was important to make a decision.</span>

971
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:30,041
<span style="style.center_1">And I chose Ritu.</span>

972
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,041
I know you're lying.

973
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,541
You don't love me at all.

974
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,416
You can never leave her.

975
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,916
And I cannot continue like this.

976
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,333
And let's go somewhere far away.

977
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,166
But...

978
01:21:58,666 --> 01:22:00,291
It wasn't going to be that easy.

979
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,500
You can't divorce Maya.
And you can't leave me.

980
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,041
You cannot do anything, Ajay.

981
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,666
Nothing.

982
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,375
I can get rid of her
without having to divorce her.

983
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,041
And keep all her money as well.

984
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:26,916
How?

985
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,583
Maya can get a heart attack.

986
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,250
Are you crazy?

987
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,250
No.

988
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:48,375
I asked Ritu for more time,
but she didn't listen to me.

989
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,666
And then you poisoned Maya and killed her.

990
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:57,791
You got what you wanted.

991
01:22:57,958 --> 01:22:59,875
Now please take me to Ritu.

992
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:02,875
I wish you had confessed earlier.

993
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,500
We wouldn't have had to stay up
all night.

994
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:08,791
Maya is alive and she will kill Ritu.

995
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:12,125
Would you prefer jail or a mental asylum?

996
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,041
You've listened to me so far.

997
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,208
How about a little longer?

998
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:34,958
<span style="style.center_1">She was prepared.</span>

999
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,666
<span style="style.center_1">She must have spit it out.</span>

1000
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,833
You don't get it.

1001
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:45,375
There are neuroleptics
that dissolve in blood like water.

1002
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,333
It slows down the pace of breathing.

1003
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,958
The heart stops beating for a while.

1004
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:50,750
And when the effect wears off,

1005
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:52,583
the body returns to normal.

1006
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:56,583
Only a madwoman would
take this kind of a risk.

1007
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:57,958
She is mad.

1008
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:00,666
She loves playing with people's minds.

1009
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,750
And she can never accept defeat.

1010
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,458
Please take me to Ritu now.

1011
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">I am at Ajay's house.</span>

1012
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:26,166
We found the morgue's detailed plans
and the escape route.

1013
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:29,250
He knew the morgue pretty well
from the inside out.

1014
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,958
We also found his sports shoes.

1015
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:33,166
The size and print match perfectly.

1016
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:34,875
-One more thing, sir.
<span style="style.center_1">-What?</span>

1017
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:40,833
-In his house?
-Yes, sir.

1018
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:41,750
-Did you send it?
-Yes.

1019
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:44,250
I've sent the footage to Keith's mobile.
You can check it.

1020
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,958
We found this at your place.

1021
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,250
What is it?

1022
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,416
How would I know how
this ended up in my home?

1023
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,458
-Where is Maya's body?
-I don't know!

1024
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,083
Where is Maya's body?

1025
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:16,375
You're forgetting that the place
where you found all the evidence

1026
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,666
is Maya's home as well.

1027
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:20,666
Maya has set this whole thing up.

1028
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,791
And she's laughing at me right now.

1029
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,250
He must be helping her.

1030
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:51,041
Maya has the money
and power to disappear.

1031
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,750
Prove that Maya is still alive...

1032
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:57,041
and I promise I will let you go.

1033
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:58,666
How can I do that?

1034
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:03,083
Listen to me.

1035
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:07,833
He's turned this into a circus.

1036
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,416
What?

1037
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,166
Where?

1038
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:22,166
Fine, I'll see you there.

1039
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:26,166
Come with me.

1040
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,541
A female's body has been found.

1041
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:36,000
Ritu!

1042
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:56,625
<span style="style.center_1">Goodbye, O companion</span>

1043
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:04,250
<span style="style.center_1">Whether we meet again, or we don't</span>

1044
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:10,666
<span style="style.center_1">Goodbye, O companion</span>

1045
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:14,416
<span style="style.center_1">Whether we meet again, or we don't</span>

1046
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:19,166
<span style="style.center_1">But I shall always be yours</span>

1047
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:25,833
<span style="style.center_1">Goodbye, O companion</span>

1048
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:29,666
<span style="style.center_1">On this painful and lonely journey</span>

1049
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:34,125
<span style="style.center_1">May God be your benefactor</span>

1050
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:41,708
<span style="style.center_1">Our saga</span>

1051
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:45,208
<span style="style.center_1">Is so weird</span>

1052
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,750
<span style="style.center_1">You're not around</span>

1053
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:52,541
<span style="style.center_1">And yet, you're the closest to me</span>

1054
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:56,291
<span style="style.center_1">Goodbye, O companion</span>

1055
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:59,625
<span style="style.center_1">Even the moments without you</span>

1056
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:04,875
<span style="style.center_1">Get me high</span>

1057
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,125
Where is the body?

1058
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,916
-Where did you find it?
-In the lake.

1059
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,875
Okay, go ahead.
I am coming with him.

1060
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,208
It was a good plan.

1061
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,166
If it wasn't for the body,

1062
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,666
I would have believed
that Maya is doing all this.

1063
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:39,000
And we found no one
at the address he gave us.

1064
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:41,250
There is no girl called Ritu.

1065
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,916
We asked around.

1066
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,333
No one knows anything
about a young girl.

1067
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,500
Do you know what I think?

1068
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:50,500
There is no Ritu in the first place.

1069
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,416
It's just a voice in his head

1070
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:58,458
that provokes him to kill his wife,
so that he can take her money.

1071
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,875
Pawan.

1072
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:04,708
And inform the judge
that Mr. Puri is in our custody

1073
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:06,750
and we can bring him
to court whenever we like.

1074
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,458
Bring the body.

1075
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:14,833
I am coming with the dead body.

1076
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:17,750
Okay.

1077
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,500
Get up.

1078
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,416
Ajay!

1079
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,416
What's happening to me?

1080
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,375
Your eight hours are almost up.

1081
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:38,416
It reminds me of my wife.

1082
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:42,750
She died ten years ago.

1083
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,958
-Nancy! Nancy, are you okay?
-Isha!

1084
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:07,375
Those people could have saved us.

1085
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,833
But they didn't do that.

1086
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:16,666
We were still alive.

1087
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,500
Remember?

1088
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:26,208
It was you and Maya.

1089
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:30,333
Maya is never wrong.

1090
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,208
Maya you are driving on the wrong side.

1091
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,041
Let's go.

1092
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,916
That kid has seen us.

1093
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,916
You'll be fine. Don't be scared.

1094
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:13,875
Sit.

1095
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,833
Stay here. I'll go get your mom.

1096
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,625
I'm coming.

1097
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:28,666
-Nancy!
-Mom!

1098
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:36,583
That day changed our lives forever.

1099
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,083
Look at this.

1100
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:52,041
Ritu?

1101
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,125
Isha, my daughter.

1102
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:05,375
<span style="style.center_1">Isha saw you at the university.</span>

1103
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:13,625
<span style="style.center_1">As the saying goes,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">"Time heals every wound."</span>

1104
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,916
<span style="style.center_1">But revenge is a dish best served cold.</span>

1105
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:26,500
<span style="style.center_1">The only motivation for me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and my daughter...</span>

1106
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:29,166
<span style="style.center_1">for the last ten years, was revenge.</span>

1107
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:32,875
Maya can get a heart attack.

1108
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:43,250
<span style="style.center_1">Everything that happened</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to you in the last eight hours</span>

1109
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,208
<span style="style.center_1">was a part of our revenge.</span>

1110
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:23,583
<span style="style.center_1">Now I have your confession,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and the evidence as well.</span>

1111
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:33,250
But sending you to jail

1112
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:35,333
wasn't enough punishment
for those ten long years.

1113
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:42,833
<span style="style.center_1">So, Isha poisoned you eight hours ago...</span>

1114
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:49,166
<span style="style.center_1">with the same TH16 that you used</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to kill Maya.</span>

1115
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:53,708
And now...

1116
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:02,500
The scores have been settled.
