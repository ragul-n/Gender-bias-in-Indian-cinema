Athreya...

8
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,220
Call for you.

00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,950
-Hello!-Hello.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,300
Uncle...

11
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,010
Hey Seenu!

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,430
How are you?

13
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,890
You need to come home.

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,010
You can catch a 
Bhopal-Tirupati tourist bus in four hours.

15
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,220
You can get down at Nellore.

16
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,550
Stay strong!

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,510
Careful buddy.

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,420
What happened uncle?

[vehicles honking]

20
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,760

[electricity trips]

24
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,050
This is the most important scene 
in this movie...

25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,010
You see that guy sitting 
in the chair?

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,300
He is Kaiser Sose!

27
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,720
He's the guy who runs the whole show.

28
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh shit!

29
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,550
Really?

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,470
Yeah...

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,560
I reacted just like you when 
I saw this for the first time.

32
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,960
But when I watched it for a second time,

33
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,120
I figured out he was the villain 
in the opening act itself!

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
Huh? 
[tongue clacking]

35
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,720
Look at him,

36
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,850
sitting there like he's innocent.

37
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,600
The next time you're at a crime scene,

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,890
the guy who comes across as innocent,

39
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,800
is your prime suspect!

40
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,140
-Hmmm... 
-Look at the guy...!

41
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,960
He's using details available in the 
room creating a story to fool the cops!

42
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,930
Stop stop stop!

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,970
Which building did he come to?

44
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,890
344...

45
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,030
Which one was he supposed to come to?

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,920
314!

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,140
How does he know?

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,050
That's when you know, 
that DiCaprio is the cop!

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,420

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,010
Really?

52
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes!

53
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,470
You don't need to overreact every time!

54
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,810
-Once was enough. 
-Hmm.

55
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,540
Even the best plans have minor flaws.

56
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,240
-That's how we catch them. 
-Hmm.

57
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,050
Play it.

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,180
DiCaprio! 
[indistinct voices from television]

60
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,550
Do you like DiCaprio?

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,260
A lot, sir!

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,140
Is it?

63
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,080
Do you want to marry him?

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,380
If there is a possibility, yes!

65
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,450
Come on! Come on! Come on! 
No!

66
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,070
I wantedly asked this 
trick question to you.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,260
Detectives do not have 
a personal life!

68
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,220
When you're discussing about crimes, 
all your focus should be on crimes!

69
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,180
-Ok? 
-Hmm.

70
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,720
Sorry, sir!

71
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,140
Now tell me!

72
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,780
Do you like DiCaprio?

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,100
DiCaprio?

74
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,970
Who's that?

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,140
Good! Ouch!

76
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,800
Tom hanks is here?

77
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,510
Yes!

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Did he meet DiCaprio?

79
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,350
Yes!

80
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,300
Did he go to the hotel?

81
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes!

82
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,550
Did he give his wallet?

83
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,140
Yes!

84
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,190
What do you think is in the wallet? 
[gasps]

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
-Just empty papers! 
-Oh!

86
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,980
Even a genius detective like 
Tom Hanks was fooled!

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,640
Watch.

88
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,500
[groans] 
[phone ringing continously]

89
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,200

Tell me!

92
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,850
Ok, ok!

93
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,680
All right!

94
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,490
[gleefully] 
Yes, yes, yes!

95
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,220
What happened, sir?

96
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,210
Any good news?

97
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,960
Someone passed away near 
Nellore Gandhi statue!

[gasps] 
[celebrating]

99
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,760
I mean...

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,090
We have a case!

101
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,540
They're not sure if its 
suicide or murder.

102
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,390
Oh...

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's go!

104
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,720
Yeah!

105
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,070
So you see...

106
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,550
That's the detective way!

107
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,010
That's exactly how we should execute!

108
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,890
Ok?

109
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,870
Never be boring or routine!

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,150
We need to stay unique!

111
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,170
No matter what we do,

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,580
it should have a 
unique style.

113
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,470
[giggles]

114
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,410
What do we do when 
it falls down like this?

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,180
Turn around.

116
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,180
Make sure no one is looking at you,

117
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,970
before you pop it back on!

118
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,800
-Oh... Ok! 
-Let's go!

119
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,350
The thing about crimes... 
Hey! Hey!

120
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,890
Where are you going?

121
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,640
Sir, I'm going to switch 
off the lights & fans...

122
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,180
No!

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,220
You need to rush out immediately 
after receiving calls like this!

124
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,100
That TV needs to stay on!

125
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,760
The fan turn too!

126
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,180
Lights need to stay on,

127
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,530
Shutter needs to stay open!

128
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,640
Most important thing,

129
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
when you go to a crime scene,

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,300
you need to have a coffee mug in hand!

131
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,800
Slurp it like this...

132
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,300
[slurping]

133
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,200
...and walk with an urgency! 
Try it.

"Don't act smart"

135
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,120
"He is a master in Nellore"

136
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,670
"You are confused by his dress, 
aren't you?"

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,830
"He is a master if he starts working"

138
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,110
"Hey! Listen to this 
if you are a criminal!"

139
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,640
"Oh moron! Run away"

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,530

Damn!

144

Spoiled my new coat! 
Rascal!

145
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,610
All these fellows love me.

146
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,070
This guy seems to be new, ignore him!

147
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,720
[indistinct voices] 
What else?

148
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,430
Why are you suddenly interested 
in being a detective?

149
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,200
Sir, it's not sudden...

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,180
English non detail text books in school,

151
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,970
got us all to study 
'Hound of Bhaskar Villa'.

152
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,190
-That... 
-My God!

153
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,640
It's not Bhaskar or Sudhakar!

154
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,260
Basker...

155
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,760
it's the hound of Baskerville!

156
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,350
That's our car!

157
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,830
Go and open the door immediately!

158
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,650
Hey, tomato guy!

159
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,890
Stop bugging me man. 
I have my own problems!

[gasps] 
Ouch! [groans]

161
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,120

-Sorry, sir!

164
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,770
I meant this door!

165
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,600
Sorry, sir!

166
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,550
Sit!

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,980
Sir, where is the driver?

168
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,050
Did he step out for a tea?

169
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,600
Why aren't you saying anything?

170
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,790
Who will drive the car 
now if there is no driver?

171
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,310
[crowd murmuring] 
[vehicles honking]

172
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,540
-Shall we go, sir? 
-Let's go.

173
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,210
-Sneha... 
-Sir.

174
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,500
This is your prescription 
for 10 days!

175
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,740
Watch 'Shawshank Redemption' 
film on an empty stomach tomorrow!

176
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,600
Watch 'Silence of the 
Lambs' after the breakfast!

177
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,680
This is a half hour before lunch,

178
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,890
L.A. Confidential.

179
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,890
This is after dinner,

180
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,680
Shutter Island.

181
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,930
Follow this for the next 10 days!

182
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,280
From the next month,

183
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,800
when you watch thriller 
or suspense movies,

184
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,720
you should be able to tell who's the 
murderer in the first ten minutes!

185
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,050
That's your work assignment!

186
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,280
Hmm! Good.

187
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,970
Ok, sir!

188
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,970
Meanwhile, where are we going?

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,020
Who died?

190
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,020
Ssh! 
[gasps]

191
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,510
Never discuss crimes in the car!

192
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,990
All that after we get out!

193
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,910
Huh?

194
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,300
Only casual talk is 
allowed in the car now.

195
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,620
The moment we get out, only 
crime related talks are allowed.

196
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,640
It's all casual now!

197
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,950
[Fake laugh]

198
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,950
Just like this.

199
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,470
So what else?

200
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,220
By look around...

201
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,630
Had your breakfast?

202
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,490
Yes, sir.

203
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,850
Steamcakes & Lentil Dumplings.

204
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,850
I love lentil dumplings!

205
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,100
I can go to any lengths for it 
if I like the taste!

206
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,910
There's a guy near Murlikrishna 
hotel near Gandhi statue,

207
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,310
who puts up a lentil dumpling cart!

208
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,350
He makes such amazing dumplings!

209
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,890
My god!

210
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,260
Anyway,

211
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,670
-I'm familliar with that place, sir. 
-Really?

212
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,740
My friends and I used to 
hangout there everyday!

213
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,860
He's comes at 4 sharp every day!

214
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,630
I made sure to have the first 
dumpling he makes every day!

215
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,970
I have a funny anecdote.

216
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,360
All of us bunked class and 
went there one day.

217
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,100
My uncle came there at the same time.

218
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,880
Sir, what happened after that?

219
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,020
Did your uncle catch you?

220
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,930
The girl's name is Sanjana!

221
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,160
Apparently, she committed 
suicide last night.

222
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,760
Huh?

223
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,050
I told you,

224
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,860
casual discussions are only for the car.

225
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,300
The moment we leave the car, our case 
should be the only focus! Let's go.

226
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,280
-Stop! Where are you going? 
-FBI! FBI!

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,850
FBI?

228
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,590
[door creaking]

229
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,990
This was a planned murder!

230
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,890
How are you so sure?

231
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,420
Look at the suicide note on the table.

232
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,870
It's tilted towards the left.

233
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,600
All her books and notes 
are tilted to the right.

234
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,390
Her pen is lying to the left side 
of the notebook,

235
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,640
the table lamp is at the right side,

236
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,580
all her eatables, cold drink, phone 
and chocolate are on the left side.

237
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,980
She's left handed!

238
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Then why is the gun in her right hand?

239
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,650
Why would someone so 
dominantly left handed,

240
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,990
shoot with her right hand just before 
the moment of her death?

241
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,510
-Point number 2. 
-Hmm.

242
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,350
Let's say, she did use her right hand,

243
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,870
shouldn't she let go of 
the gun when she fell?

244
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,140
Even if the gun simply stayed 
in her hands due to shock,

245
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,510
her finger would have 
been on the trigger but,

246
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,220
it shouldn't look as if it was staged.

247
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,140
Point number 3.

248
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,550
Cigarette smokers have a habit.

249
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,330
They always smoke the whole cigarette 
before throwing it out.

250
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,330
Especially depressed people.

251
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,660
Why did this girl shoot herself 
halfway through a cigarette?

252
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,550
Let's say that she shot 
herself halfway through.

253
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,600
Shouldn't the cigarette have 
completely burn out by now?

254
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,220
It just didn't.

255
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,100
She's still holding it tightly.

256
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,590
Someone else smoked that cigarette

257
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,140
and put it between her 
fingers after death.

258
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,420
The funny part is,

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
She's not a smoker.

260
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,680
This is the only cigarette in this house.

261
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,590
None of the other rooms in the 
house had any cigarette.

262
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,240
There weren't even cigarette 
stubs in dustbin.

263
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,170
There is no ashtray and 
stinky cigarette smell!

264
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,980
Every room except this one is clean.

265
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,280
Point number 4.

266
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,190
Anti depression pills on the table.

267
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,080
These pills expired an year ago.

268
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,950
Why did this middle class girl 
not choose the fan to die?

269
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,260
Why would she need a 
licensed gun to suicide?

270
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,950
This gun, anti-depression pills, cigarette 
this untidy room and that suicide note,

271
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,970
all these were staged to make us 
believe that she killed herself.

272
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,490
This is not a suicide.

273
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,900
It's a cold blooded murder!

274
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,550
You're a genius sir! 
[indistinct voices]

275
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:35,980
Sir!

276
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,370
Namaste!

277
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,440
Who are you people?

278
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,060
Sir, you must be 
thinking that this is a suicide,

279
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,810
it's a murder! 
Come on I'll show you!

280
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,080
Hey!

281
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,410
Who told you this was a suicide?

282
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,120
Even we know that 
this was a murder.

283
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,850
Upon interrogation, her friend 
confessed that he did it for money!

284
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,700
You had to interrogate him. 
I just looked around and found out.

285
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,680
What was that back there?

286
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,850
You think you are here for a 
shop opening?

287
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,640
Why did you entered 
by cutting the ribbon?

288
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,870
What's the hat and that coat?

289
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,750
Why are you dressed up like an undertaker?

290
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,550
What's with the interrogations?

291
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,420
Who the hell are you?

292
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,220
FBI!

293
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,080
FBI!

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,160
FBI?

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,470
Isn't that in America?

296
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,600
They copied from us!

297
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,060
FATIMA BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION!

298
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,150
Fatima was my first lover name.

299
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,970
I named it after her.

300
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,530
Saying "Fatima Bureau of investigation"

301
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,660
was getting too long!

302
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,050
So I changed it to FBI!

303
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,150
Very famous!

304
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,010
Two years later, 
go to U.S and ask for FBI,

305
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,750
they'll ask 
"Isn't that the one in Nellore?"

306
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,970
We also offer discounts to the police!

307
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,740
Sir, keep this somewhere...

308
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,040
Important...

309
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,200
Come here, sir.

310
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,830
We solved the case together, right?

311
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,750
Let's take a selfie! 
[phone keypad beeps]

312
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,050
Yeah!

313
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,610
Nice! 
'Murder solved' 'Feeling excited with...'

314
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,650
Sir, are you on Facebook? 
[camera clicks]

315
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,070
I'll tag you.

317
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,010
[slaps]

318
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,720
[laughs] 
Get up.

319
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,490
What do you want?

320
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,230
-Coffee... 
-There's no coffee in the cup man...

321
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,190
[laughs]

322
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,640
Who is this guy?

323
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,170
[birds chirping]

324
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,410
[vehicles honking]

325
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,140
Did he hit you too hard?

326
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,570
My uncle caught me at the 
dumpling cart that evening.

327
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,450
Oh, ok...! 
So your uncle caught you?

328
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,170
What happened next sir?

329
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,100
What else?

330
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,600
He tied me up to a tree and 
hit me with his belt!

331
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,800
So he also beat you?

332
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,080
"He is a laughing stock in Nellore"

333
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,660
Watch where you are going!

334
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,090
Hey! 
You can't touch me man!

335
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,780
"Don't laugh"

336
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,800
[indistinct television playing]

337
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,700
Look at there...

338
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,470
Even a genius detective like 
Tom hanks was fooled!

339
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,200
This is a part of the detective job!

340
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,930
Some times we get cheated 
and beaten by others!

341
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,450
-I can understand that, sir! 
-What?

342
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,930
I understood, sir!

343
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,020
What's that?

344
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm still learning, sir!

345
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,280
Don't act smart!

346
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,270
Do what's in your job description first!

347
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,940
What's with your clothes?

348
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,170
And those spectacles!

349
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,260
Get rid of the specs from tomorrow!

350
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,310
Didn't I tell you about the 
detective's attire that hat, coat,

351
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,370
and a band-aid though 
there isn't any wound?

352
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,820
-Do you even have a Facebook account? 
-Yes.

353
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,110
Do one thing!

354
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,300
Login to your account, search for 
our page 'FBI Nellore' and like it.

355
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,540
-Sir? 
-Hmm.

356
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,680
This has only two likes.

357
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,530
Mm-hm...

358
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,130
-One is you... 
-Hmm.

359
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,930
And the other one is... Sherlock Holmes!

360
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,110
Yes!

361
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,630
It's me!

362
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,630
I created a fake Sherlock 
Holmes page and liked our page!

363
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,200
He is like our deity!

364
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,940
-A like from him will help us get respect! 
-Oh!

365
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,830
-Do you have a passport size photo? 
-Yes, sir.

366
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,880
Bring it tomorrow!

367
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,630
I'll get your FBI ID card ready!

368
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,090
You can join work from tomorrow!

369
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,120
Okay, sir!

370
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,410
Let's go.

371
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,700
-Sir... Sir... 
-Hmm.

372
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,280
-I have a doubt! 
-What's that?

373
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,750
Can we get a tube light here?

374
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,560
It will be a little brighter!

375
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,250
No. This dim lighting 
suits our line of work!

376
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,650
Not only work but workplace ambiance 
is also very important!

377
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,100
Oh... You're amazing sir!

378
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,070
One more thing!

379
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,860
What is it, sir?

380
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,210
Don't keep calling me, sir!

381
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,830
Then what do I call you, 
sir?

382
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,100
[shutter bangs]

383
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,000
AGENT SAI SRINIVASA ATHREYA

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,630
[humming] 
[shutter bangs]

385
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,460
This is my shutter!

386
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,000
This is my home... my gift!

387
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,200
[beatboxing] 
Agent!

388
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,120
-Yes. 
-I got lentil dumplings for you!

389
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,810
Put them there. 
I'll eat while I'm working!

390
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,780
[Drily] That's likely!

391
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
By the way, 
what's our program today, Agent?

392
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,740
-Program? 
-Hmm.

393
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,520
Ours is a startup, Sneha. 
We won't get major cases everyday!

394
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,020
We didn't get any case even yesterday.

395
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,290
We went and investigated anyway!

396
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,750
-What? 
-Nothing.

397
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,650
We'll get a major case soon.

398
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,840
Until then let's solve some small 
cases and make a load of money.

399
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,600
Small cases as in? 
[indistinct voices]

400
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,960
Here comes one. 
Watch!

401
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,420
-Give me those lentil dumplings! 
-I'll break your bones! Come on!

402
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,710
-Hello, sir! 
-Hello Mr. Athreya. How are you?

403
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,210
I'm good, sir. You tell me, 
what's the matter? Take your seat.

404
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,200
There was a robbery in a nearby 
temple yesterday at 7 pm.

405
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,660
The priest says he saw these 
two skulking around.

406
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,570
Both of them are pushing the 
blame onto each other.

407
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,130
You need to find out who the culprit is...

408
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,380
That will be easy, don't worry!

409
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,230
Which one of you did it boys?

410
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,290
Sir, its not me but it's him.

411
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,990
Sir, I didn't do anything but he did it.

412
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,710
Really?

413
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,740
-Don't open it! 
-Hmm.

414
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,000
Do one thing!

415
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,680
Choose one of these fingers!

416
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,320
One is a thief's finger and the 
other is a good guy's finger!

417
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,130
Whoever chooses the bad finger, 
is the culprit!

418
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,210
What a naughty thief you are...!

419
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,940
Why did you do it?

420
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,630
-Sir, it's not me. 
-Sir, he is your thief.

421
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,600
No, I'm not!

422
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,820
He's fidgety because he is guilty!

423
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,430
Just by a happy fluke, he might have 
gotten the good finger...

424
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,910
There was a 50% chance in this!

425
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,600
So, he decided to take a shot.

426
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,760
That guy is innocent as he 
has no clue what to choose!

427
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,480
Hey! Enough said!

428
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,920
I went to the temple to pray,

429
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,240
but now because I touched your finger, 
you're calling me a thief!

430
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,730
What if I catch your feet?

431
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,720
Will I become a god now?

432
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,800
Is all this some bloody joke to you? 
Huh?

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,350
Hmmm. You are right man!

434
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,610
I get the feeling that 
you're telling the truth!

435
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,230
Moreover, you look like an innocent guy!

436
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,490
I think I saw you near 
Leelamahal Theater last night...

437
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,360
Were you there?

438
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,120
-Yes, sir! 
-You went to watch a movie?

439
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,230
-Yes, sir! 
-Balcony seat?

440
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:16,890
Yes, sir!

441
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,070
You parked your bike downstairs 
in the lot?

442
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,560
-Yes, sir! That's what I'm saying! 
-That's why I told you,

443
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,460
this guy is the thief!

444
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,780
[gasps] 
Sir!

445
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,480
Leelamahal theatre has been 
closed for repairs for a week!

446
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,850
What the hell were you doing there, man?

447
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,480
Sir... 
That is...

448
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,730
Were you watching the movie 
on some worker's phone there?

449
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,200
"Yes sir!" It seems!

450
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,420
Dirty rogue robbing temples...

451
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,540
Take him away sir! He is your thief!

452
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,250
You can go!

453
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,190
-Sir... Sir... Please listen to me! 
-Come you bloody thieving rogue!

454
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,740
Sir!

455
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,950
The case is solved, let's click a selfie.

456
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,590
Okay!

457
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,120
You too!

458
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,420
[laughs]

459
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,500
Why are you laughing?

460
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,340
Please act like a thief!

461
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,420
[camera clicks] 
Right, sir!

462
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,040
-Right. 
-Thank you.

463
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,270
Thank you, Mr. Athreya! 
Come.

464
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,880
Sir, what about my payment?

465
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,030
How much?

466
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,270
Give me Rs. 1116 since it's a temple case.

467
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,100
He has stolen Rs. 500.

468
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,300
[sighs] Keep this Rs. 116 for now. 
Let's settle some other time

469
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,810
Move! Move!

470
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,900
Bring me some major cases, sir! 
I'm done with the small stuff!

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
You'll be the first to hear when 
I find something! Move! Move!

472
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,260
Remember the slip I gave you just then?

473
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,440
Open it!

474
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,010
[gasps] 
How?

475
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,570
He said it himself!

476
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,620
No matter how fearlessly 
you commit crimes,

477
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,080
there is always a fear of getting caught!

478
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,850
It is visible in their eyes!

479
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,440
Most people cannot hide it!

480
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,300
Just like this guy!

481
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,770
-Even criminals? 
-Hmm.

482
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,840
Do you think these criminals 
are really that intelligent?

483
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,210
90% of them are morons!

484
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,180
All you need to do is to 
read their thought process!

485
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,860
Their way of doing the crimes,

486
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,200
Their fears...

487
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,520
If you get a grip on them,

488
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,830
You can solve any case!

489
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,490
[vehicles honking] 
[indistinct people talking]

490
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,710
-Agent! 
-Hey! Sirish!

491
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,600
Sir!

492
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,330
How are you man?

493
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:01,980
Super!

494
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,280
We've been talking on phone but it's 
been a long time since we actually met!

495
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,690
What can I say! 
Crime reporting has become a hectic job!

496
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,190
The stories take up most of my time!

497
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,340
Ocassionally when I do have time,

498
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,110
You remember my mentor in Kavali NGO?

499
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,760
-I go out and meet him! 
-Oh!

500
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,630
His place is shut today.

501
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,130
So I came to hang out with you 
before I head there!

502
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,530
Sir, it's our luck!

503
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,790
-Shall we go for a coffee? 
-Let's go!

504
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,860
Brother! 
Pour my coffee in this!

505
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,810
So, what's new man?

506
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,820
As you know, life is very busy!

507
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,350
-Any interesting cases? 
-Nothing man. Just barely hanging on!

508
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,440
Hey Sirish!

509
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,680
It's been a while, where are you man?

510
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,010
I was very busy man!

511
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,350
What are you doing here?

512
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,580
I came to meet a friend!

513
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,410
Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya!

514
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,480
Namaste, sir!

515
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,460
Agent?

516
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,870
LIC Agent?

517
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,120
Sir, I heard there's a new 
policy that came out recently...

518
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,300
You think I should take it?

519
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,220
[sniggering]

520
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,480
He's not a LIC Agent!

521
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,740
He's a detective agent!

522
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,880
[laughs]

523
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,540
Detective? 
[indistinct people shouting]

524
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,390
Detective!

525
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,310
As in?

526
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,570
-Actually.... 
-I'll explain.

527
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,690
What else, sir?

528
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,030
How's your house construction 
going on in the street behind?

529
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,890
What construction?

530
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,180
Oh, come on, sir...

531
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,050
You park your green vespa AP 
26 3473 here every morning!

532
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,280
You buy a newspaper here

533
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,370
and get on the 10.30 bus at 
the bus stop to go to office!

534
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,510
You'd reach your office coolly at 11, 
must be a government office then!

535
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,740
There's only one government office 
on your bus route!

536
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:19,880
PWD!

537
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,640
Pen & calculator in your pocket,

538
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,870
You must be the PWD account supervisor!

539
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,380
You're maintaining two phones on your Rs. 
15000 government salary!

540
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,780
One is an iPhone you've hidden away 
in the back pocket!

541
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,980
You must be doing a lot of 
under-the-table signings!

542
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,430
You leave those files pending

543
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,510
and then return back here in the same 
bus and get down here at 6 sharp!

544
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,760
You disappear somewhere 
between 6 pm to 8 pm!

545
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,340
You're shoes are heavily soiled when 
you're back at the shop at 8 pm.

546
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
You order a ginger tea 
& Red Wills cigarette

547
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,310
and you make a phone call 
to your wife from here!

548
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,110
"Darling! I'm stuck at the office"

549
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,580
"I'll be back in an hour." 
Why is it, sir?

550
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,090
Why doesn't madam know 
about the construction site?

551
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,000
Without informing about the second 
house and the second phone,

552
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,700
you pick up a bunch of Jasmine flowers, 
get on your Vespa from the parking

553
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
and return home like a loving husband!

554
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,590
Am I right, sir?

555
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,150
How do you know all this?

556
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,360
You drink tea here everyday 
don't you?

557
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,110
Brother, do you know who this man is?

558
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,470
-No. 
-Why?

559
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,970
-Because... 
-Because he's a teastall owner!

560
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,280
Well! 
You buy a newspaper here everyday.

561
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,900
Grandpa, do you know this man?

562
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,950
No!

563
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,920
-Because 
-Because he's a newspaper seller!

564
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,340
Then how do I know all this, sir?

565
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,010
Because you're a detective!

566
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,480
Sir, now do you understand?

567
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,770
What a detective does...

568
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,410
I fully do, sir!

569
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,140
Go on then...

570
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,670
It's 10.30... Time for your bus!

571
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,050
[vehicles honking] 
[bus arriving]

572
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,630
[tyres screeching]

573
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,280
Sir!

574
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,950
The kumkum and sacred ash marks on 
your forehead, rings on your hands...

575
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,260
You seem to be a god fearing person!

576
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,850
You're stamping on those 'evil-eye' 
pumpkins everyday, be careful!

577
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,180
Convey my greetings to the madam.

578
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:57,960
Bye, sir!

579
00:24:59,390 --> 00:24:59,880
Right!

580
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,220
Did you have to rag that 
poor fellow so much?

581
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,070
Actually, I'm here for your help!

582
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,060
About?

583
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,670
Un-identified dead bodies!

584
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,980
Just in Nellore district alone, 
five dead bodies are surfacing every day!

585
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,110
No one knows who it is.

586
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,170
No one knows why they died.

587
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,730
It is not even clear if it 
is a murder or a suicide.

588
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,530
An estimated 100 bodies surface 
everyday in our country!

589
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,460
Is there no police investigation 
about these bodies?

590
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,890
Actual complaints have no hope 
of being solved sometimes!

591
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,910
These bodies don't even match 
any missing complaints!

592
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,170
Nobody cares!

593
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,010
There is an unclaimed dead bodies 
section.

594
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
They hold the body there for a week!

595
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,730
If someone comes to claim them, 
well & good!

596
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,100
Otherwise, they obtain an autopsy report 
from a government hospital,

597
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,910
they're sending these bodies on 
for mass cremations!

598
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,640
Hmm!

599
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,110
Hey! I always wanted to chase 
this case down but,

600
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm not able to find the time for it!

601
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,810
Are you interested?

602
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,390
Tell me if any dead bodies show up again!

603
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,910
You know just how much I 
like these weird cases! Huh!

604
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,920
Just one call!

605
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,350
-Sure, man! 
-Sister! How are you?

606
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,440
I'm good Seenu!

607
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,690
So? What else man? What's new? Is 
everything okay? [phone ringing]

608
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,970
Hello!

609

We'll be there in 15 minutes!

611
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,980
Yeah... Thanks!

612
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,640
-Hey I need to leave man! 
-What happened?

613
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,600
Some murder case. We'll catch up soon. 
[indistinct people shouting]

614

There's a basket on my main gate everyday!

A milk packet goes missing 
from it everyday!

619
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,560

So you lost the milk packet here?

623
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,140
Don't tell anyone that we 
handled this case!

[sobbing] I've already completed the 
cremation customs by afternoon, Seenu!

Today is panchak kaal!

689

Conducting cremation 
activities during panchak kaal,

690
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,480
is said to be very bad for 
the village and the family!

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,250
That's why I had to 
complete it in a hurry!

692
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,950
How could you cremate her without me?

693
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,050
You were supposed to wait 
until I arrived!

694
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,680

you are aware of our village 
customs & traditions.

Last week, she went to the aadi 
festival held on every year.

nerves in her head damaged a lot

707
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,970
and she slipped into coma.

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,580
Why did you let her go?

711
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,940
Damn!

712
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,340
Mother...

713
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,640
Mother's gone...

714
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,680
[music muted voice]

715
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,570
Mother... [gasps] 
[phone vibrating continously]

716
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,960
Yes, Sirish!

717
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,650
Hey! They found a dead body near 
Venkatachalam railway bridge,

718
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,060
-on the outskirts of Nellore.  
-Is it?

719
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:41,990
Hurry up!

720
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,500
-I will. Thanks man!-Ok, man!

721
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,040
[phone beeps]

722
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,070
[dialer tone ringing]

723
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,080
[birds chirping]

724
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,590
[train honking]

725
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,300
What are you doing here?

726
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,050
Who are you? 
[train moving]

727
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,190
-Did you do this murder? Huh? 
-Why would I kill?

728
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,510
Someone... Called me... So I...

729
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,270
Are you trying to dispose the body here?

730
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,960
Sir!

731
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,130
I'm a detective!

732
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:27,950
Arrest him!

733
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,350
-Move! 
-Remove your hand.

734
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,010
Sir,

735
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,140
Please tell him.

736
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,390
Arresting a famous detective is not easy!

737
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,070
You should know...

738
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,840
No I don't!

739
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,160
Take him away!

740
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,310
Sir!

741
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,130
Sir...

742
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,610
You asked me to remind you 
about this file!

743
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,970
What a style, sir! 
Awesome!

744
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,600
That burger... Those chips...!

745
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,600
Those crunchy chips sound like 
Rehman's music!

746
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,850
Can you hear it?

747
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,190
-What is this nonsense sir? 
-My God!

748
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,050
Your height... Your uniform... My god!

749
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,270
Amitabh Bachchan!

750
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,810
Mr. Amit!

751
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,020
-Please sir, I really am a big detective. 
-Send it to this address!

752
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,710
Hey, Sirish Watson!

753
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,140
I can't possibly tell you how disappointed 
I am upon your late arrival!

754
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,790
Please do the needful to get me out of 
this godforsaken place, thank you so much!

755
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,850
What a bloody brilliant day!

756
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,380
Sir, I'm a...

757
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,490
crime reporter from Eenadu!

758
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,600
So?

759
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,110
The guy you arrested,

760
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,310
Athreya...

761
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,310
He's my friend!

762
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,010
This guy is a friend of our prisoner.

763
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,660
Throw him inside too... 
[sniggering]

764
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,640
Sir...

765
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,820
He really is a famous detective!

766
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,260
You've arrested him by mistake.

767
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,530
Stop saying famous.

768
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,380
No one knows him beyond his street.

769
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,620
How is he famous?

770
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,620
He went there on my information.

771
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,060
You're a crime reporter you say...

772
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,410
I'll tell you in words 
you will understand!

773
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,970
Objects found at the crime scene,

774
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,860
are called evidence! 
[typewriter keyboard clacking]

775
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,760
People, like your friend, 
found at the crime scene,

776
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,890
are called suspects!

777
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,690
So, he is my suspect.

778
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,880
No way am I letting him go!

779
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,140
Get bail. 
That's the only way he's leaving.

780
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,560
Today's a court holiday!

781
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,870
I can't get bail until morning!

782
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,020
Then he stays here tonight!

783
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,840
Don't you worry... 
We'll take good care of him

784
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,690
We'll feed him all he wants

785
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,170
and then we'll beat him until 
he digests all that.

786
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,710
I know how to bring him out...

787
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,840
-Come Sneha! 
-Good. Get on with it then...

788
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,800
...stop wasting my time.

789
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,110
Hey! Just one minute man!

790
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,180
Ya, I'd like you to hurry up!

791
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,910
The person you are calling...

792
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,220
It's ok... It's just one day!

793
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,660
Fine!

794
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,220
Detectives getting arrested 
is a good omen!

795
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,400
When they make my biopic,

796
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,050
this jail scene will bring 
layers of emotion to the film!

797
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,100
I'll try to get bail by 10 tomorrow!

798
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,240
It's alright!

799
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,790
All this is nothing.

800
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,340
That one guy is snoring a lot.

801
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,110
Don't worry!

802
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,760
-You can bail me out royally tomorrow! 
-Excuse me!

803
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,630
Your time's up. Leave!

804
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,460
Biopic it seems!

805
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,620
He'll probably play all the characters 
himself if someone makes his biopic.

806
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,410
How many more lies will you tell?

807
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,930
I've unnecessarily paid you 
a lot of money already!

808
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,500
-What is wasted? 
-I'm trying man!

809
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,310
You'll be bailed out in a week.

810
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,150
Trust me!

811
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,990
One more week?

812
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,010
Fine then.

813
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,110
What's the matter, brother?

814
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,310
Nothing, sir.

815
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,680
There was a theft in our village 
last month!

816
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,700
Then the police arrested me.

817
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,210
That's how I became a thief!

818
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,900
But I didn't do this theft, sir!

819
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,570
[phone ringing] I'm begging my 
lawyer to get me out on bail...

820
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,910
He keeps giving all sorts of excuses,

821
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,250
like there's not enough evidence 
or bail is impossible now...

822
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,520
Do one thing. 
[phone ringing]

823
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,000
Tell your lawyer to say you were 
out of town that day.

824
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,090
How's that possible?

825
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,980
Tell them you went to Chennai 
for a Sai Baba spiritual meeting!

826
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,590
Get a lodge bill to show you stayed there,

827
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:40,570
a food bill from a nearby restaurant, 
a couple of cinema tickets,

828
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,360
and a couple of fake bus tickets to 
Chennai from a private travels.

829
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,470
Get all these ready and create a 
story that you were in Chennai that day!

830
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,140
Get him to create these 
proofs of your innocence!

831
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
You're really great, sir!

832
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,010
Thanks!

833
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,050
One more thing,

834
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,390
Ask your lawyer to quit 
books and watch movies!

835
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,830
How are these people dealing cases 
without basic cinema knowledge?

836
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,360
-Sir... Even I'm not able to make bail! 
-Don't call me by addressing 'sir'!

837
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,210
Agent!

838
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,750
Agent Sai Sreenivasa... Athreya!

839
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,490
Come on!

840
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,010
Brother, please don't fight. 
One by one! [indistinct voices]

841
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,110
-Form a line! Form a line! 
-Hey! Wait.

842
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,730
Him, you, him, him, you and him...

843
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,130
I will bail out all of you tonight!

844
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,130
Hmm. Tell me 
what you did!

845
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,630
Sir, I... 
[music muted voice]

846
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,250
[music muted voice]

847
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,520
Sir...!

848
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,600
-Hmm. 
-What is this food?

849
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,260
Order a full meals from 
Venkataramana hotel!

850
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,460
Shut up and eat what's given!

851
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,450
Go, get in!

852
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,040
[metal door creaking]

853
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,330
Hello, sir... Welcome!

854
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,540
You too join us!

855
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:10,590
Oh my dear man!

856
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:13,870
What's happened, sir?

857
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
You're awfully quiet 
since I've been here!

858
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,800
You didn't even eat anything.

859
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,530
What's it sir? What is your problem?

860
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,480
Let it be anything, 
I'll solve it like that!

861
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,860
Do you want bail? 
Huh?

862
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,730
Sir! 
[snapping fingers]

863
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,560
I'm talking to you.

864
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,000
Alright, your wish!

865
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,550
Divya...

866
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,350
Who's Divya, sir?

867
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,550
Divya is my daughter.

868
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,510
What happened to your daughter?

869
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,470
She used to sponsor 
books for poor children.

870
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,930
She used to teach such kids

871
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,050
and also did many more 
charitable activities.

872
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:55,140
She went to Ongole on the 
18th of this month on some work.

873
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,680
That night...

874
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,220
She called me at 10 in the night and said,

875
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,930
"Father..."

876
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,850
"I'm scared"

877
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,970
"Those three will not leave me..."

878
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,260
And her phone got disconnected.

879
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
After that,

880
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,510
I couldn't reach her no 
matter how many times I tried.

881
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,470
I didn't know what to do.

882
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,640
I didn't know whom to turn to.

883
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,760
Immediately,

884
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,050
I took my friend to the Ongole station

885
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,720
and lodged a complaint there.

886
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,140
The inspector over there said,

887
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,760
"There's an unidentified body here"

888
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,890
"Go identify whether or 
not it's your daughter"

889
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,220
[crying]

890
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,180
My Divya...

891
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,050
It was my Divya!

892
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,510
The inspector said that she 
committed suicide because of love failure.

893
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,930
But that wasn't it,

894
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,890
Anyone who saw my daughter's 
body could clearly see it that

895
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,050
she was brutally raped and murdered!

896
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,480
[weeping]

897
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,650
That inspector refused to listen to me.

898
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,260
The doctors made a report citing 
it to be a suicide by hanging.

899
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:21,550
I don't know whom to talk 
to or where to go. [weeping]

900
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,890
Calm down, sir.

901
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,550
Do you suspect anyone?

902
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,010
I mean,

903
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
Did your daughter say anything?

904
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,010
That day,

905
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,970
right next to my daughter's body,

906
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,970
we found her cellphone.

907
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
I told you that she called 
me at 10 that night, right?

908
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,180
We checked her entire phone call list.

909
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,600
The same day from 9 pm onwards,

910
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:52,010
right up to 9.55 pm, there were 3 
to 4 calls from those three numbers.

911
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,640
I became suspicious.

912
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,220
I went to Ongole station and 
handed over the evidence to the SI.

913
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,800
He said they would verify those numbers,

914
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,300
they asked me to come back later.

915
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,720
When I went back again,

916
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,510
they feigned ignorance about the phone,

917
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,800
and said they don't know 
who I was and pushed me out.

918
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,640
I came back home to our police.

919
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,220
Some guy defrauded people in 
a chit fund scam at Venkatachalam,

920
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,390
and they claimed it was 
me and jailed me here.

921
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:34,160
[weeps]

922
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,350
You said your daughter got 
phone calls from three numbers.

923
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,510
Do you know who they were? Any details?

924
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,680
I don't know the names,

925
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,510
but I had written down the numbers 
thinking that it might be useful.

926
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,550
Can I see them?

927
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,390
Yes... Here.

928
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,010
Is that your daughter's picture?

929
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Yes.

930
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,680
I'll try to find out more 
about these three numbers.

931
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,140
[sobs]

932
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,850
Please don't cry sir...

933
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,600
Please don't cry!

934
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:23,850
When you lose someone you really love,

935
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,800
You hope to have had 
one last chance to see them.

936
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,140
But,

937
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,760
after seeing my daughter's lifeless body,

938
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,180
I prayed to God why I saw her like that.

939
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,780
[indistinct siren wailing] 
[taps]

940
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,720
Hey you! You got bail. Get up!

941
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,640
What with you, Agent?

942
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,970
You're out of jail.

943
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,550
Why are you still gloomy?

944
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,260
I met an old man in the lockup, Sneha.

945
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,760
Someone brutally raped 
and killed his daughter.

946
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,510
He tried complaining to the police,

947
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,640
instead of helping they 
filed fake cases on him,

948
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,390
seized his belongings and 
threw him in the lockup!

949
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,140
He had been crying, 
thinking about her all night...

950
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,160
When he was explaining about 
the way he found her deadbody,

951
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,430
it gave me chills!

952
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,010
Imagine a father,

953
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,010
he finds out that his daughter is dead,

954
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,850
he finds her body in such a condition,

955
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,740
Think about the pain he 
must be going through.

956
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,460
[claps]

957
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,600
I keep telling you all the time,

958
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,850
that we'd get a big case soon.

959
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:58,670
Hmm...

960
00:45:59,260 --> 00:45:59,970
This is the one!

961
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Let's take this up!

962
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,140
Maruti Rao gave me three numbers.

963
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,400
I doubt that these three guys are using 
their influence to bury the case details.

964
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,680
The police are also protecting 
them and covering the case.

965
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,180
Find out the details of these three guys.

966
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,680
Okay, agent.

967
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,500
They said I will be 
shifted to a sub jail tomorrow.

968
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,140
I will come meet you in two days.

969
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,760
My name is Maruti Rao.

970
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,470
What's your name?

971
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,510
Agent Sai...

972
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,850
Call me 'Babu'.

973
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,050
Agent.

974
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:51,510
What happened?

975
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
She said she will send 
it in an email, Agent.

976
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
[machine whirrs]

977
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,350
The first number belongs 
to some guy named Ajay.

978
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,720
Brindavan Apartments, 
behind railway station, Nellore.

979
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,010
Who's the second?

980
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:14,710
[machine whirrs]

981
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,180
Next print.

982
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,000
Harsha? Who's he?

983
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,470
RK Puram, Nellore.

984
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,140
The third one.

985
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,850
[machine whirrs]

986
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,320
Vasudha? A girl?

987
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,100
Is there no photo?

988
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,390
Uhuh! The photo of the third 
number is not in the database.

989
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,180
Interesting! Interesting!

990
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,600
Okay.

991
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,300
Let's check on these addresses first.

992
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,930
Are they still there?

993
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,760
Were they in Ongole on the 18th... 
We need to find out.

994
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,880
[knocks]

995
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,300
Hello madam!

996
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,190
Our bathrooms are already clean.

997
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,030
-No... I'm not here for that! 
-Is it?

998
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,630
Even our clothes are 
shining white and bright!

999
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,050
No... Not for that either!

1000
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,950
By chance you're from 
the salted toothpaste gang?

1001
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,620
No madam, I'm from One Flight couriers!

1002
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,270
Oh!

1003
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,190
There's a courier for Ajay sir!

1004
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,020
I was about to say 
that, but you didn't let me!

1005
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,940
[laughing] 
Hmm...

1006
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,580
Actually it had come on the 18th.

1007
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,180
I couldn't reach him 
on the phone that day.

1008
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,570
18th he was out of town.

1009
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,370
Yes... He did mention that 
he was going somewhere...

1010
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:18,830
To Ongole!

1011
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,540
Yes!

1012
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:20,740
Ongole.

1013
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,290
He said he was going to Ongole!

1014
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,910
He asked me to deliver it today.

1015
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,770
Its ok, give it to me!

1016
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,010
Sorry madam, please don't mind, 
Company policy!

1017
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,450
I can only deliver this to Ajay sir. 
can you call him once?

1018
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,370
He isn't home. He's at the office.

1019
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,910
He'll be back in the evening.

1020
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,820
No worries madam. 
I'll come back again in the evening.

1021
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,420
Ok.

1022
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,200
Thank you madam. Have a good day!

1023
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,290
What happened Agent?

1024
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,240
This is Ajay's house.

1025
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,200
Ajay was in Ongole on the 18th

1026
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,910
What do we do now?

1027
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,410
First get rid of this cap.

1028
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,950
She thought I was there 
to clean her toilet...

1029
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,620
...Like Abbas in that Harpic AD. Damn!

1030
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,950
Remove Ajay's address from the 
package and put Harsha's address on it.

1031
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,490
Actually it arrived on the 18th madam.

1032
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,660
18th he was in Ongole.

1033
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,080
Maybe that's why he didn't take your call.

1034
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,290
Haa ok, ok.

1035
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,410
Sir, did mention it.

1036
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,410
Later when I called him, 
he asked me to come today madam.

1037
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,830
He just went out. 
He'll be back soon.

1038
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,660
Ok... 
I have a few more deliveries to give out.

1039
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,120
Is it ok, if I come back in the 
evening at 4 o'clock or 4:30 maybe?

1040
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,690
Ok.

1041
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,030
Thank you madam, have a good day! 
[laughing]

1042
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,450
Even this guy was in Ongole on 18th!

1043
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,790
Sneha, 
something happened in Ongole that day!

1044
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,490
Hello madam.

1045
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,990
I have a courier for Vasudha.

1046
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,790
Who's Vasudha?

1047
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,660
She had given this address for delivery.

1048
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,830
There is no one here with that name!

1049
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,040
No one?

1050
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,080
-Are you new here? 
-Yes.

1051
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,080
Do you know about the previous residents?

1052
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,620
No!

1053
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,410
Can you give me the owner's number?

1054
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,200
Why?

1055
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,120
It's an important courier madam.

1056
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,100
-9, 0, 3, 0... 
-Hmm...

1057
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,820
6, 9, 3, 1, 4, 9.

1058
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,250
[chuckles]

1059
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,700
[door creaks] 
Many Thanks...

1060
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,910
I mean... thanks.

1061
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
-Make a call to the owner now. 
-Ok.

1062
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,120
Phone: The number you 
have dialed is not reachable.

1063
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,450
It says not reachable Agent!

1064
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,600
-Try Vasudha's number. 
-Hmm... Ok.

1065
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,340
Phone: The number you 
have dialed is not reachable.

1066
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,830
[sighs]

1067
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,540
-Ok, keep calling to the owner's number. 
-Ok.

1068
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,040
Ajay and Harsha both 
were in Ongole on 18th.

1069
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,160
So, something happened there.

1070
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,370
And Vasudha must have 
some information about this.

1071
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,880
So, let's follow Ajay and 
Harsha separately from tomorrow.

1072
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,240
Mmmm...

1073
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,200
This Harsha looks very dangerous.

1074
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,700
So just to be on the safer side,

1075
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,330
you follow Harsha.

1076
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,790
I'll follow Ajay.

1077
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,130
As the cops are trying to 
cover up this case here, that means

1078
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,000
any steps Ajay and Harsha would take in 
the next two days will also be covered up.

1079
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,470
So our following should be very thorough!

1080
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,540
Who are Ajay and Harsha? What 
they are? And what they are doing?

1081
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,740
Every minute of the day, 
what are they doing...

1082
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,810
every person that they meet.

1083
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,300
Everything has to be noticed and tracked.

1084
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,830
-Ok? 
-Hmm...

1085
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,260
-Did you try Vasudha's number? 
-Not reachable.

1086
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,570
-Her owner? 
-Not reachable.

1087
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,430
Keep try calling them, 
it's very important to contact them!

1088
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,260
Be outside Harsha's house 
tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock!

1089
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,380
-But Agent... 
-Hmm?

1090
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,440
I don't have a bike.

1091
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,220
-Oh... 
-Hmm...

1092
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,940
Now I remember,

1093
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,400
Even Harsha's bike is in need of repairs.

1094
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,690
It's time to walk!

1095
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,700
Stop! Stop!

1096
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,540
There's a hospital opening. 
Please visit with your family!

1097
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,740
I'm an orphan.

1098
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,530
Cotton candy

1099
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,790
Abdul Razaaq Persian 
traveler met Sri Krishna Devarayalu.

1100
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,700
Wasn't Abdul Razaaq a Pakistani cricketer?

1101
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,950
When did he meet Krishna Devarayalu?

1102
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,660
Some nonsense they keep writing!

1103
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,740
-Sir, please give alms, I'm hungry! 
-Dumb book, do you want to buy?

1104
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,810
Hey! Hey!

1105
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,440
[phone rings]

1106
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,160
Sneha where are you?

1107
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,290
Outisde the house.

1108
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,200
Has Harsha come?

1109
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,620
Not yet.

1110
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:34,540
Not Yet?

1111
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,040
Agent?

1112
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:36,870
Shall I knock his door and ask him?

1113
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,410
I need to follow you.

1114
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,830
Why aren't you out yet?

1115
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,200
Don't overact. Do as described 
in your job discription first.

1116
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,950
-Are you coming early? 
-I'll call you back in a while.

1117
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,290
Ya, I'll be back in the evening.

1118
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,120
I need to go out. 
Don't forget. Come home soon.

1119
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,540
Didn't I say I'll come?

1120
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,660
Sir, 
can you give me two minutes of your time?

1121
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,960
We're having a fantastic offer sir,

1122
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,710
this offer won't be 
available from tomorrow...

1123
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,340
-No, no need! 
-...sir.

1124
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,870
Just a two minute demo sir and 
then I can explain all about this offer.

1125
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,450
I don't want it!

1126
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,680
Sir offers like this are rare to come by.

1127
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,540
Once you hear this offer, 
even you will ask about it again.

1128
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,830
It's a very fantastic offer sir,

1129
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,750
-Fine Go on! 
-give me 2 minutes of your time sir?

1130
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:07,830
Hello!

1131
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,220
-What's the offer? 
-Hey, get lost!

1132
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,860
Sir, thank you sir, offer has expired!

1133
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,230
[music mutes voices]

1134
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,610
[metal door creaks]

1135
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:40,870
What's this?

1136
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,200
Are you trying to rob the bank?

1137
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,690
Sir we are having a very 
fantastic offer on books sir.

1138
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,070
Nowadays we see children 
are not interested in books at all.

1139
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,220
But reading our books will get 
your children's IQ from, 0-150.

1140
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,030
They might get selected to 
KBC/IIT in 3rd or 4th class itself.

1141
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,580
Within one week of buying the book, 
you will feel your intelligence growing.

1142
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,590
Friends will also remark on 
how intelligent you look now.

1143
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,240
We have a Rs. 50 discount for today sir.

1144
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,290
Can we learn all that in one week?

1145
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,990
You can feel your 
intelligence rising in 3-4 days.

1146
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,490
If you had actually read this book,

1147
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,830
you wouldn't need to be out on 
the streets selling this book now!

1148
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,220
-Go! 
-No problem sir.

1149
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,910
-Thank you very much, have a good day! 
-I am tired of my job and you're screwing.

1150
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,020
[laughing]

1151
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,120
Haa agent.

1152
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,490
I'm at the outskirts of Nellore.

1153
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,580
Harsha is in the ice cream parlor.

1154
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:21,080
He is talking to some one here.

1155
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:22,870
He's talking to Ajay!

1156
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Turn around!

1157
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,160
Agent...

1158
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:46,620
-They're leaving, let's follow them! 
-No, need.

1159
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,290
Hey! Sit, sit... Sit there and talk!

1160
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,490
This is how detectives should talk.

1161
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,540
We don't know each other.

1162
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,120
Venkatachalam Railway bridge!

1163
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,080
News paper office, car rental agency,

1164
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,040
Mortuary.

1165
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,060
Seeing all this,

1166
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,600
I feel that these guys have some 
connection to the railway bridge murder.

1167
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,260
They're trying to cover something up!

1168
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:08,870
That's why they're worried.

1169
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,830
2 things,

1170
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,040
first we have to gather the 
details of the guy in Tirupati

1171
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,900
and gather information about Vasudha!

1172
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:15,830
2nd point!

1173
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,540
Divya!

1174
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,000
They've told that she too 
went to Ongole on 18th.

1175
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:18,760
Why?

1176
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,990
Some NGO activity it seems, what is it?

1177
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,050
We need to find answers 
to all these questions.

1178
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,510
Come early tomorrow morning.

1179
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,890
-We have a lot do to. 
-Hmm...

1180
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,370
-Alright. 
-I'll take bill.

1181
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,120
Yeah!

1182
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,580
Separate though, not together.

1183
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,290
I don't know who she is...

1184
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:32,990
[laughs]

1185
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,370
Pay the bill and move. I'll meet 
you in the parking after 5 minutes.

1186
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,320
Agent! 
[phone rings]

1187
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,830
The house owner we 
tried calling yesterday.

1188
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:53,330
-I'm calling from the courier company sir.-Yes, please tell me.

1189
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,580
There is a courier addressed 
to Vasudha for your address.

1190
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,320
-Ok...  
-When I reached there...

1191
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,660
The tenants said they don't 
know anyone with that name.

1192
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,490
Vasudha?

1193
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,240
Yes sir.

1194
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,660
The current tenants have been 
shifted there 3 months back it seems.

1195
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,410
Was there someone with that name? 
A previous tenant!

1196
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,910
There used to be a couple before.

1197
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,540
The girl's name isn't Vasudha though!

1198
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,370
Ok.

1199
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,120
So that couple,

1200
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,330
do you know their whereabouts?

1201
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,240
I think they've gone to 
the US after vacating.

1202
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,370
I don't know anymore details

1203
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,370
Ok. Thank you sir!

1204
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:29,660
-Thank you sir!-Ok.

1205
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,490
Ok sir!

1206
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,330
We need to know who this girl is.

1207
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,620
Vasudha might know 
what happened in Ongole that day!

1208
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
Who killed Divya?

1209
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,180
[sighs]

1210
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:08,660
Divya?

1211
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:11,660
Divya!

1212
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,200
Agent!

1213
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:18,990
Divya?

1214
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:22,580
Oh my god!

1215
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:26,790
You're Divya right?

1216
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,200
Who are you?

1217
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,240
Who is Divya?

1218
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,330
No... Not that!

1219
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:33,840
You're...

1220
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,120
Do you know Telugu?

1221
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:37,620
What are you talking?

1222
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,330
Is your father around?

1223
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,730
Your father Maruthi Rao, is in jail!

1224
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,050
-He thinks you are dead. 
-Dad!

1225
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,400
-My daughter is calling. I'll make a move. 
-Ok.

1226
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:48,840
-Who is this? Do you know them? 
-Uh! Uh!

1227
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:50,490
Your father?

1228
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,160
He is my father!

1229
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,660
What are you saying?

1230
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,490
Sir... This girl...

1231
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,290
Can you understand what I'm saying?

1232
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,790

1233
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,040

-Sorry.

1235
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,040

1236

1237
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,540

1239

You come dear...

1240
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,410
The bus is ready now!

1241
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,290
What happened Agent?

1242
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,870
Sneha she's the girl in the photo!

1243
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,200
She's Divya.

1244
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,330
She's the one in the 
photo Maruti Rao gave me!

1245
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:23,330
He thinks she's dead, she's alive!

1246
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,040
Are you sure?

1247
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,470

[cicadas chirping]

1249
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,690
Suri, sir has sent them. Take care.

1250
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:50,410
Mmm...

1251
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,010
Sir! Greetings sir!

1252
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,240

1253
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,860
Need to meet Maruti Rao...

1254
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,860

1255
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:58,610

1257
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,450
Please sir.

1258
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,740
Fine... What's his name?

1259
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:05,610
Maruti Rao, sir!

1260
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:12,900
There's no one here with that name.

1261
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,280
Maruti Rao, he's an old man.

1262
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,650
He was supposed to be transferred 
here from the rural police station.

1263
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,650
Please check one more time.

1264
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,030
No prisoner was brought here 
from rural in the last 3 days.

1265
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,240
No one has come?

1266
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,650
That's what I said.

1267
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:49,830
I'm getting death threats, 
why aren't you taking action?

1268
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,720
-Stop whining man! 
-Hey! Where are you going?

1269
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:52,990
-I need to meet the Inspector. 
-He's busy. Sit down.

1270
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:54,220
-Sir it's a little urgent. 
-Sit down man.

1271
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,950
We're getting death 
threats from an unknown number...

1272
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,890
Hey, Detective, sit down man!

1273
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,070
No clue sir!

1274
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,570
I don't even know who they are sir.

1275
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,030
Come back in the morning.

1276
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,700
Sir, please tell him.

1277
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,070
Hey, wait!

1278
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,360
Go man!

1279
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,710
-Didn't he ask you to come tomorrow? 
-Send the detective!

1280
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,330
-Come dear. 
-Go!

1281
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:09,930
Thank you!

1282
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,860
Mmm... What is it?

1283
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:16,860
Mr. World Famous Detective,

1284
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:17,950
did you brought the burger?

1285
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,990
I will, 
if you give me a small information sir.

1286
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,150
You have arrested a person 
name Maruti Rao that day right?

1287
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,240
Didn't you transfer him to the sub jail?

1288
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,200
Maruti rao?

1289
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:26,490
Who's that?

1290
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:28,030
Maruti Rao sir...

1291
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,140
That old man in white clothes, 
he was in the lockup with me that day...

1292
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
Maruti Rao, ah?

1293
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,200
Wasn't that guy's name Gopalam?

1294
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,110
He was making a drunken scene nearby,

1295
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,490
so we locked him up for the night.

1296
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,390
-And freed him in the morning. 
-Who is Gopalam?

1297
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,140
His name is Maruti-

1298
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,780
You arrested him for being drunk?

1299
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:47,820
Tell him...

1300
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:49,150
Brother,

1301
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,670
-Do you have that man's address? 
-That is...

1302
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,120
-Brother! 
-Home minister sir is asking...

1303
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,000
Come on, tell him.

1304
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,490
This is our only job, 
to enquire about everyone's address.

1305
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,320
Get out!

1306
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,610
Go!

1307
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,490
Hello...

1308
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,450
Do you think the police are 
hiding something wantedly?

1309
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,010
[cicadas chirping]

1310
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:14,740
I spoke to Maruti Rao that day.

1311
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:18,700
I could see the pain in his eyes Sneha.

1312
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:21,450
How about we...

1313
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,360
go inquire in the 
Ongole police station once?

1314
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,610
He did say he registered 
a case in Ongole right.

1315
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,150
Let's go to Ongole, come on.

1316
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Agent! I should go to home for once.

1317
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,030
Mom has been calling continuously.

1318
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,360
Ok. You go home.

1319
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,530
I'll go get the car.

1320
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,490
Tell your mom we are 
going to Ongole on work.

1321
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,530
What's the delay?

1322
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,570
I went to buy medicines for mom.

1323
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,990
I'll be out in 2 minutes, Agent.

1324
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,330
[cicadas chirping]

1325
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,730
-Umm... Agent! 
-Yes?

1326
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:00,950
I need leave for one week!

1327
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,440
Why?

1328
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,650
Karni Mata festival is 
happening in Bikaner, Rajasthan.

1329
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:06,570
So what?

1330
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,110
Goddess Durga takes the 
form of rats in the town it seems.

1331
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,570
My mom believes, spotting a white rat 
among those rats brings you good luck.

1332
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,280
So, we us to go every year, 
but we couldn't go last year.

1333
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:19,490
Mom thinks that's why 
her health is affected...

1334
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:22,150
Sneha, how can you believe 
all this hocus pocus garbage?

1335
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,820
You're educated,

1336
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,280
you need to tell your mother.

1337
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,780
How can you ask for a 
leave in your first month?

1338
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,450
My shift is 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock, 
Agent!

1339
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,030
I am working overtime now right,

1340
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,950
I'll take a compensation leave for this...

1341
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,280
Oh wow!

1342
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,990
By the way Agent,

1343
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,530
will anyone in the Ongole 
station co-operate with us?

1344
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,990
Ongole SI is Sirish's friend.

1345
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:44,240
Oh... The it's fine.

1346
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,610
If there is a case in that station,

1347
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,490
we will know who's lying.

1348
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:53,990
Namaste sir.

1349
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:54,900
Namaste...

1350
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,030
We're here from Nellore.

1351
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,900
My friend Sirish must 
have called you already.

1352
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,570
What do you need?

1353
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:02,570
Has there been any case filed on 18th 
about the death of a girl named Divya?

1354
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,990
I need those details please.

1355
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,700
We did find a dead body.

1356
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,280
But it's a male dead body!

1357
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,290
Male dead body?

1358
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,820
We haven't been able to identify it.

1359
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,150
18th night, did we find any 
dead body of a girl named Divya?

1360
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,780
-Just check once. 
-Male dead body?

1361
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,650
Call me if you get any information.

1362
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,420
Thank you.

1363
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,700
Sorry Athreya!

1364
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,400
There has been no complaint 
registered in any station on Divya's name!

1365
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,740
Something is wrong Agent!

1366
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,400
I really don't 
understand what's happening.

1367
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,610
The total case is going clueless.

1368
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,700
The old man said he filed a case here.

1369
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,620
These guys are saying, 
there's no such case.

1370
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,400
Who's lying?

1371
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:39,650
Something's happening...

1372
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,400
We're reading this case all wrong.

1373
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,110
There has been no registered case,

1374
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
Maruti Rao is not in the cell.

1375
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,280
What happened to him?

1376
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,360
What happened in Ongole on 18th?

1377
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,450

01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,570
[meditating]

1406
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,930
Keep your attention on your breath!

1407
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,450
-Now with the little finger... 
-This isn't a little finger,

1408
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,120
-It's the index finger! 
-This is my little finger.

1409
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,300
Close your nostrils and do what I say.

1410
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,580
With this little finger,

1411
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:46,160
close your nostrils, 
exercise your lungs....

1412
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,790
Inhale...

1413
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:49,540
Hey, Athreya...

1414
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,660
-Athreya! 
-Exhale...

1415
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,480
Will this help us get released from jail?

1416
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,490
I don't know about that, but stress 
will definitely leave your body.

1417
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:58,000
What are you doing?

1418
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,790
I'm breathing the pure jail breeze man.

1419
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,850
Hey, when cops questioned you 
how it would be if you stay silent?

1420
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:04,000
What do you want me to say?

1421
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,220
Tell them you did nothing.

1422
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:07,930
Hey, when I was asking them, 
you know what they're saying?

1423
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,880
They are saying that you 
didn't even try to defend yourself man.

1424
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,370
That day in the hospital,

1425
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:13,410
in the ATM CCTV cameras,

1426
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,680
outside the car rental agency.

1427
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,420
There are video proofs 
everywhere that I was stalking Ajay.

1428
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,510
Ajay's watchman and his 
laundryman will definitely remember me.

1429
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,940
The day Ajay died, 
I had been following him everywhere.

1430
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,990
There are multiple video 
recordings of everything.

1431
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,080
And you want me to go to the cops and say,

1432
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,440
'sir I'm innocent'

1433
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:28,980
'Who is Ajay?' 'What is Ajay? 
Is this you want me to say?

1434
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,490
They will start hitting me for that.

1435
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,320
That's why I stayed silent.

1436
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,620
I'm probably just the prime suspect in 
Ajay's murder preliminary investigation.

1437
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,690
[sighs] 
I do understand, but

1438
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,590
who killed Ajay man?

1439
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,630
Ajay and Harsha together did...

1440
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,000
Harsha!

1441
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:52,740
Where is Harsha?

1442
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:54,980
I don't know Agent!

1443
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,320
Didn't Harsha talk 
anything after Ajay's dead?

1444
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:57,920
No!

1445
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,240
Call Harsha immediately.

1446
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,360
He isn't picking up.

1447
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,390
That's it!

1448
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,900
Ajay and Harsha had a tiff 
outside the coffee shop right?

1449
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,610
-Yes. 
-Later Ajay gets murdered.

1450
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,020
And now we don't know about Harsha.

1451
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:14,470
You both need to go 
and trace Harsha's whereabouts.

1452
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,820
He could be potential 
suspect in Ajay's murder!

1453
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:17,430
-Quick! 
-Ok man.

1454
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,170
-Ok done. 
-Ok Agent!

1455
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,490
[door knocks] 
[door creaks]

1456
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:23,030
Is Harsha at home?

1457
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,660
When will they give the body?

1458
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,010
Police verification is 
underway, maybe a couple more hours.

1459
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,020
Ok.

1460
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,430
Ajay and Harsha were brutally murdered.

1461
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,450
We had to identify the 
bodies by their belongings.

1462
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,330
A few body parts... are still missing.

1463
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,120
They found the murder weapon and...

1464
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:56,290
Your fingerprints are all over it!

1465
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,390
My fingerprints?

1466
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:58,160
Not only that,

1467
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,090
they even found drugs at 
Ajay and Harsha's houses.

1468
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,210
Same sample, 100g cocaine 
was found in your house too.

1469
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:04,890
What?

1470
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,830
Because of this the case 
against you has got more stronger.

1471
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,670
They're calling this a drug mafia clash.

1472
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,000
Cops are saying you 
killed them because of that.

1473
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,260
This is going to be the headline news 
paper and in every channel tomorrow.

1474
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,350
Are you happy now?

1475
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,880
-I told you long back. 
-One second... One second!

1476
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,940
Maruti Rao entered my cell 
on the day I got arrested.

1477
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,020
I started investigating this case 
after I heard about his daughter right?

1478
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,250
I thought I was helping the old man,

1479
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,180
I hoped this case would 
bring great fame to our agency.

1480
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,920
That after so long, 
I finally caught a big case.

1481
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,740
We didn't catch this case man.

1482
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,250
The case came and caught us, Sirish!

1483
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,280
Think about it!

1484
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,370
What was I doing?

1485
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,750
I thought I was following Ajay 
and Harsha for my investigation.

1486
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,500
No!

1487
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,370
There was never any investigation.

1488
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,620
I've been manipulated into 
planting evidence against myself.

1489
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,030
That day, 
a knife had fallen down on the road.

1490
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,110
I picked it up.

1491
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:01,270
There!

1492
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,250
That's where they found my fingerprints.

1493
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,540
What's the murder weapon?

1494
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:06,890
It was a billhook... 
(a coconut knife)

1495
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,070
That's it!

1496
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:11,280
Ajay and Harsha's 
deaths were already fixed.

1497
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,970
They needed me as a 
patsy to take the blame.

1498
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,430
That's how they created a 
fake case to pull me in.

1499
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,000
That old man's name was Gopalam, 
not Maruti Rao.

1500
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:23,080
Everything Gopalam told me was 
a well planned bullshit story.

1501
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,360
Athreya listen to me.

1502
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,430
All this looks very dangerous.

1503
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,220
I'll bring you out anyway I can.

1504
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,880
You're no Sherlock 
Holmes, just let this go now!

1505
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,440
Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.

1506
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,570
Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya is original.

1507
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,370
They trapped me right?

1508
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,300
Nice!

1509
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:38,590
They have planned it very well.

1510
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,880
Now this case got very interesting.

1511
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,290
I'm not going to leave until I 
get to know who and what they are.

1512
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,710
What should we do now?

1513
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,070
Three things.

1514
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:45,990
First,

1515
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:49,310
let's trace back to everywhere and 
everyone, Ajay and Harsha have visited...

1516
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,320
Only then can we understand 
what these two were up to.

1517
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:51,930
Second,

1518
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,020
Gopalam gave me three numbers Ajay, 
Harsha and Vasudha.

1519
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,240
Two of them are already dead.

1520
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,570
Vasudha, she is either dead 
or they are trying to kill her.

1521
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,890
We need to find her quickly.

1522
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,990
Third, can you get me out of prison?

1523
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,820
Case against you is very strong.

1524
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,590
-Apply for bail man. 
-I'm trying man.

1525
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,230
Ok.

1526
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:10,130
I'll go now.

1527
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,110
Hey, Sirish!

1528
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,700
What time was Ajay killed?

1529
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,480
9 P. M.

1530
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,090
I was in the sub-jail at 9 P. M.

1531
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:24,000
Really?

1532
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,570
I had gone to inquire about Gopalam.

1533
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,370
How can I kill Ajay?

1534
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,290
Go to the sub jail,

1535
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:29,840
get the CCTV footage from them.

1536
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,600
Apply for bail using that, I wasn't at 
the crime scene during time of death.

1537
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,290
Super man!

1538
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,180
I'm going to bring it!

1539
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,170
-Ok? Bye man. 
-Ok.

1540
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,750
The jail footage isn't clear,

1541
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,850
you've only been 
granted 5 days interim bail.

1542
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,860
Mean while you've to submit 
proofs that you are innocence.

1543
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,660
You just have 5 days with you.

1544
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,970
You need to give your signature 
at the police station everyday.

1546
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,360
Fine, thanks man.

1547
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,580
-Aren't you coming with us? 
-No, man.

1548
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,110
I'm going to the NGO in Kavali.

1549
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,070
There are many works left over there.

1550
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,120
-Ok, let's catch up later. 
-Hmm...

1551
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,270
I'll call you.

1552
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,020
Alright man.

1553
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,340
-Thanks man. 
-Bye.

1554
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,060
-Agent! 
-Hmm?

1555
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,680
You told some Sherlock 
Holmes dialogue yesterday.

1556
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,600
You told it well.

1557
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,980
A little funny,

1558
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:16,710
but feeling is good. 
[chuckles]

1559
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:18,980
Alright,

what's our brilliant plan agent?

1561
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,990
Listen carefully.

1562
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,410
Nellore MLA's son is 
getting married today.

1563
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,960
We need to go there,

1566
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,240
Plan it seems...

head, let's go solve them first.

Can I know why was this man here?

We're from the special 
investigation department.

1574

01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,870
We still haven't found 
that child kidnapper right?

1577
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,800
No. Not yet Agent.

1578
01:14:59,090 --> 01:14:59,600
I found him.

1579
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,490
Who is it Agent?

1580
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,320
Abdul, owner of Imran Cars.

1581
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,230
They say a man with a french 
beard is snatching little children.

1582
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,640
He's our regular customer sir.

1583
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:09,500
He booked a car to 
Venkatachalam 3 days ago.

1584
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,930
He came again yesterday because 
he some personal things in the car.

1585
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:12,940
That's all sir!

1586
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,900
He came to collect his personal things?

1587
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,610
Yes sir, 
he picked up his things yesterday.

1588
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:23,310
He's been asking for news articles on 
unidentified bodies in the last 4 days.

1589
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:25,100
-Unidentified bodies? 
-Yes sir!

1590
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:28,140
They found some dead body near 
the Venkatachalam railway bridge.

1591
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:30,380
He kept badgering me for 
that post postmortem report.

1592
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,060
This is a government hospital sir,

1593
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,620
no one cares enough for a post 
postmortem on unidentified bodies...

1594
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,460
They keep sending random write-ups.

1595
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,570
One says heart attack,

1596
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,000
another says kidney failure.

1597
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,330
To each their own...

1598
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,780
Just finish the job and go.

1599
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:44,840
Not only that,

1600
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,750
look at this signature,

1601
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,720
Satish it seems...

1602
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,830
There's no Satish 
working in this hospital.

1603
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,250
He used to ask reports like these sir.

1604
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,900
If these ever got 
out, I'll be behind bars.

1605
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,470
But he'd never listen sir...

1606
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,370
I will not tell anyone.

1607
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,550
I knew Harsha for a long time.

1608
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,920
Criminology student.

1609
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,470
He and Ajay were working on 
some unidentified bodies case...

1610
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:10,090
I called them when I saw one such 
body under Venkatachalam bridge.

1611
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:11,530
That day, in his hurry.

1612
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:14,120
Harsha dropped his bike keys.

1613
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,180
He had come here again searching for them.

1614
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,840
Sneha careful, there's a constable around.

1615
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,190
I will guide you over the phone.

1616
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,430
[cicadas chirping]

1617
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,120
Who are you?

1618
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,530
We're here for the investigation.

1619
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:31,990
Someone was just here...

1620
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,630
This is a second level investigation.

1621
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,930
Do you suspect anybody?

1622
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,450
I don't have any suspicions.

1623
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,660
Please go!

1624
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,270
Did Ajay give you any 
documents before he died?

1625
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:43,050
Nothing!

1626
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,730
Can you please try and remember?

1627
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,170
There's nothing to remember...

1628
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,090
I said there was nothing.

1629
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,170
How many people do I have to talk to?

1630
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,850
It's not like that...

1631
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,540
Sneha, just do as I say...

1632
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,310
Go to the door

1633
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,730
Stop! Turn around now!

1634
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,460
Look at her and repeat after me.

1635
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,310
Madam...

1636
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:05,610
Madam...

1637
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,780
Your husband was brutally killed.

1638
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,720
Your husband was brutally murdered.

1639
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,670
The only ones who are trying...

1640
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,150
To find the real culprits.

1641
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:14,740
If you don't help us,

1642
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,180
Why they killed Ajay?

1643
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,440
Who is the real culprit?

1644
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,810
Will remain a secret forever.

1645
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,140
Ajay's death will become meaningless.

1646
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,480
It's still your wish.

1647
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,390
One minute.

1648
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:31,440
[fingers snapping] 
Yes!

1649
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,100
What did she give you?

1650
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:39,850
Sneha, these are photos of 
unidentified dead bodies...

1651
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:43,060
They went to Ongole on 
the 18th for these photos...

1652
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,610
Agent...

1653
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,440
Someone is in the house... 
[cicadas chirping]

1654
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,270
Constable is sleeping....

1655
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,890
[vehicle honks]

1656
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,090
He's up.. He's up...

1657
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:01,950
Turn around, don't look at him...

1658
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:02,720
Hmm...

1659
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,680
-What else? 
-Uh! Uh!

1660
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,640
-Talk something very casually... 
-Hmm...

1661
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,280
Casual...

1662
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,140
-Did you feed the cat? 
-Hmm...

1663
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,330
-Does your cat drink Buffalo milk? 
-Hmm...

1664
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,660
What do you call your cat?

1665
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:14,920
I call him Agent!

1666
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:16,940
Is he gone?

1667
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,550
He's gone!

1668
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,020
Let's go... Let's go... Let's go!

1669
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,840
[metal door creaks]

1670
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,840
[door creaks]

1671
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,200
[wardrobe door creaks]

1672
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,230
[wardrobe door creaks]

1673
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,340
Agent!

1674
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:27,700
What happened?

1675
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,970
Agent... The same cover.

1676
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,820
This was the same cover someone 
gave to Harsha in the supermarket.

1677
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,150
Why is there my name on it?

1678
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,310
This has all my details.

1679
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:45,650
Come on, let's go!

1680
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,340
I forgot my mobile there!

1681
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,270
Hey, Sneha!

1682
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,910
-Sneha, constable will return. 
-2 minutes Agent.

1683
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:03,650
Come fast!

1684
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,300
[muffled screaming]

1685
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,890
[gasps] 
Agent!

1686
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,480
[coughing]

1687
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:48,680
Agent!

1688
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:53,930
Let's go!

1689
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,520
What are you worried about?

1690
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,560
Someone tried to kill me...

1691
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,770
It means our 
investigation is on the right track!

1692
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:11,940
Don't worry!

1693
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,060
I'll be fine!

1694
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:19,310
He's here!

1695
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:22,020
[vehicle arriving]

1696
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:29,900
Namaste sir!

1697
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,310
Thanks for seeing us 
immediately upon my phone call.

1698
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:33,850
That's okay, Athreya!

1699
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,900
I heard you guys talking yesterday.

1700
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,100
Discussing about that in the 
station is not a good idea.

1701
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,650
That's why I asked you to meet outside!

1702
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,020
Can you tell me everything 
that happened from the start?

1703
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,350
Sneha!

1704
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,020
Can you identify the man 
who gave the cover?

1705
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,560
If I see him, I will definitely identify!

1706
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,980
I couldn't see his bike 
number as I was in a hurry.

1707
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,270
But,

1708
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,810
I remember that the starting number was 7!

1709
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:00,560
7?

1710
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,650
It means we have 
thousands of vehicles to search!

1711
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,310
It's not going to be easy.

1712
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,690
Anyway, let's try getting a list of 
vehicles starting with 7 from the RTO.

1713
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:11,940
Okay. Thank you sir!

1714
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,910
It's getting late, you need to 
sign at the station. Let's go.

1715
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:18,740
I'll come tomorrow, sir.

1716
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:19,470
Agent!

1717
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,230
The vehicle I saw that day is outside!

1718
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,690
It's not the same 
vehicle, but a similar one.

1719
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,270
Similar to this one.

1720
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:39,940
Are you sure?

1721
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,440
Damn sure, sir!

1722
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,020
These are old police vehicles, Sneha.

1723
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,810
Blue Colts used to have them.

1724
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,480
Now, constables use them.

1725
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:48,850
I remember those blue 
and red stripes very well!

1726
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,480
Okay. Come with me.

1727
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,840
-Sagar. 
-Sir.

1728
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,270
Get a list of all police 
vehicles starting with number 7.

1729
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:57,230
Quick.

1730
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,520
Sir, here's the list.

1731
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:06,690
Sneha, what do you think his age would be?

1732
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:08,690
Somewhere between 35 to 40.

1733
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,900
Get a separate list of 
people in 35 to 40 age range.

1734
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,940
Photos?

1735
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:19,900
-Is it him? 
-No.

1736
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:20,770
Next.

1737
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,090
-Is it him? 
-No.

1738
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:24,700
Next.

1739
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,900
That's him, sir.

1740
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,440
He gave that cover to Harsha.

1741
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,770
I've seen this guy somewhere.

1742
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:35,270
Sneha, are you sure?

1743
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:36,810
Damn sure, sir!

1744
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:38,770
Suresh

1745
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:39,650
Sir

1746
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,660
Call Narayana and ask him to 
come to the station immediately.

1747
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:43,190
-Go. 
-Okay, sir.

1748
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,000
Why it took so late, Narayana?

1749
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,020
I was coming from the 
neighbouring village.

1750
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:58,310
Come, Narayana.

1751
01:23:59,230 --> 01:23:59,650
Sir.

1752
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,190
Did you meet Harsha a couple of days ago?

1753
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:05,440
Yes, sir.

1754
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:06,440
Why?

1755
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:08,400
Sir, the thing is that...

1756
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,730
The thing is that...

1757
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:10,900
Why! 
[taps hardly]

1758
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:11,940
Sir...

1759
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:13,950
Tell me...

1760
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:15,650
Sir, the thing is that...

1761
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:20,150
Harsha had seen this man near 
the Venkatachalam bridge dead body.

1762
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,940
He requested me to secretly give him 
Athreya's details which were in my station

1763
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,650
I just gave him those. That's all, sir.

1764
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:27,600
Is that it?

1765
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,480
Yes, sir! There is nothing 
more other than this.

1766
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,150
Okay. Go.

1767
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,190
I think he is telling the truth, Athreya.

1768
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:39,310
Ajay and Harsha saw 
me near that dead body.

1769
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,790
It means they knew that I was 
investigating those bodies, sir.

1770
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,850
Why didn't they report it to the police?

1771
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,350
Why did they secretly 
obtain my information?

1772
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,400
Harsha wanted to meet 
me about this case, sir.

1773
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:51,730
He must have some 
information about the dead body.

1774
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,730
They were killed before 
they could meet me, sir.

1775
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:57,650
That's why they tried to kill me too.

1776
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:58,270
Sir,

1777
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,230
They could have framed anyone in Nellore 
for the murders of Ajay and Harsha.

1778
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,270
Why me?

1779
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,400
Beause the common point between 
Ajay, Harsha and I is the dead body.

1780
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,940
This whole drama 
started with that dead body.

1781
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,020
I have a small request.

1782
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:12,520
Can you use your influence and force 
a proper postmortem on that body?

1783
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,520
If we can find out 
the cause of death,

1784
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,270
we will get to know the link 
between the murders of Ajay and Harsha.

1785
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:21,310
Thank you, sir.

1786
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:22,370
No problem.

1787
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,160
-I'll meet you tomorrow. 
-Okay.

1788
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,270
Thank you, sir.

1789
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,020
They asked me to file a 
complain in this station, sir.

1790
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,730
That area doesn't fall 
under our jurisdiction.

1791
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:30,440
What is this sir?

1792
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,980
You people are making me run 
around from station to station.

1793
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,760
My daughter and I've been 
getting death threats from a week

1794
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:37,350
and we are trying to file a complaint 
but none of you are paying any heed.

1795
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,100
Why are you shouting in the station, huh?

1796
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:39,810
What is this, sir?

1797
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:40,830
Don't you get my words?

1798
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,520
What is the point of 
wearing these uniforms?

1799
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:44,810
My daughter is missing.

1800
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,190
-What's happening here? 
-Are you guys happy?

1801
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:47,520
What is this nuisance?

1802
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,650
-Who is this man? 
-If something happens to my daughter...

1803
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:51,310
...I won't spare anyone of you.

1804
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:53,560
Sir, he says that his daughter is missing.

1805
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:56,230
He is shouting at us despite telling 
him that it's not in our jurisdiction.

1806
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,520
My daughter is missing, sir.

1807
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,850
If something happens to her...

1808
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,880
My daughter is missing, sir.

1809
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,900
If something happens to her... 
[weeps]

1810
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,560
-Listen to me, sir! 
-I cannot take it sir!

1811
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:13,120
Please stop worrying and 
answer my questions calmly.

1812
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:14,480
Come, sit down.

1813
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,630
[weeps]

1814
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:20,730
Give me your daughter's details.

1815
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:23,940
She looks fair and stands 
five feet six inches tall, sir.

1816
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,270
When she left the house,

1817
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,900
she was wearing a red coloured dress.

1818
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,690
Oh... Any identification marks?

1819
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:35,850
She has a tattoo of her mother's face on 
her hand which she got in her childhood.

1820
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,770
She went to the medical 
shop at night two days ago.

1821
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,060
She hasn't come back yet.

1822
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,060
I've called everyone I know.

1823
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,690
No one knows where she is.

1824
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,520
What's your daughter's name?

1825
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:47,270
Vasudha.

1826
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,510
[gasps]

1827
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,230
Vasudha?

1828
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,600
Yes, sir.

1829
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:53,600
Sir...

1830
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,230
When did you last speak to your daughter?

1831
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:00,230
Right before she left for 
the medical shop that night.

1832
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,850
She's missing since then.

1833
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:03,830
Did you try her cellphone?

1834
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,400
It's switched off.

1835
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,450
-Suresh. 
-Yes, sir.

1836
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,020
Is there any report about 
finding a female dead body?

1837
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,850
Yes, sir.

1838
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,690
A dead body was found near 
the Kavali bridge an hour ago.

1839
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:17,450
-Our policemen went there. 
-Okay.

1840
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:21,830
-Sir... 
-Yes, sir.

1841
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,150
You too come with us.

1842
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:30,620
[indistinct train honking]

1843
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:44,960
[wind soughs] 
[indistinct train honking]

1844
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,190
Morning, sir.

1845
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:03,730
What happened?

1846
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,510
It is a woman's dead body.

1847
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,200
The dead body is in an 
unidentifiable condition.

1848
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,810
She was brutally murdered.

1849
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:12,600
There were scratches on her entire face.

1850
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,000
The dead body started to 
decompose and it is stinking too.

1851
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:17,810
What is the colour of her dress?

1852
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,230
A red dress, sir.

1853
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,060
Come with me, sir.

1854
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,020
Please have a look at the body.

1855
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:55,120
[sobs]

1856
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,850
They've killed you Vasu...

1857
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,150
Vasudha!

1858
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,940
Sir, don't touch the body!

1859
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:05,230
-What are you good for? 
-Sir, her belongings.

1860
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,810
What are your uniforms good for?

1861
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,190
No... Just stay away!

1862
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,440
We found this near the body!

1863
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,090
Shucks!

1864
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:36,840
[exhales]

1865
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,840
-[indistinct voice in the walkie-talkie] 
-Sir.

1866
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:45,900
What are you doing here?

1867
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,980
Who allowed you here?

1868
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,480
Why are you looking up?

1869
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,750
Searching for the Arundhathi star?

1870
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,090
Show it to the girl too.

1871
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,100
Hey detective, he is talking to you.

1872
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:01,810
I'm asking you.

1873
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,090
Why do I always find 
you near a dead body?

1874
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,210
What can I do, sir?

1875
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,230
You aren't doing your job properly.

1876
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,000
Mind your words!

1877
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:09,730
If you had done your job, 
that girl would have been alive!

1878
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,100
-Why are you shouting? 
-Then?

1879
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,780
-Do you know who did this murder? 
-Who?

1880
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:15,270
Is it?

1881
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,890
In a way how you have 
murdered Harsha and Ajay,

1882
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,440
this murder took place 
in the similar pattern.

1883
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:20,900
-You killed them! 
-We understood that you can't solve crimes

1884
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,980
Next time, give me a call. 
I'll come and solve it for you.

1885
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:24,070
-Agent 
-What does he think of himself?

1886
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:25,290
-Let's go agent 
-What the hell are you talking?

1887
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:26,810
-What will you do? 
-I will tell you.

1888
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,560
There's no need to fear. 
We've done nothing wrong!

1889
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,560
-Let's go, agent. 
-There's no need.

1890
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:30,690
Come on... Tell me.

1891
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,900
This murder was also 
committed by this detective.

1892
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,100
See that his bail gets cancelled.

1893
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:35,920
Agent... Let's go agent?

1894
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,990
So you'll just go around arresting 
everyone in the crime scene?

1895
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,070
-Why are you shouting? 
-Do something, sir.

1896
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:40,850
-Athreya! 
-As the dead body is in the crime scene,

1897
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,020
-Cancel the bail of the dead body too.-I'll smash your teeth!

1898
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:42,790
Athreya, go from here.

1899
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,090
Calls himself an inspector 
but can't solve a crime.

1900
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,700
-Leave! 
-Call me next time.

1901
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,310
Go and sell burgers in a bakery!

1902
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:48,400
Hey, Vamsi!

1903
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:49,960
Is this your doing?

1904
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,410
Is it you who brought him here?

1905
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:52,690
Sorry, sir.

1906
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:57,220
Hey! Clear the scene.

1907
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,770
Suresh, make it quick.

1908
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,400
-No.. Don't touch anything! Don't! 
-Clear out everything!

1909
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:02,400
I'm not leaving.

1910
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:03,690
Don't touch her.

1911
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:09,470
[vehicle doors thud] 
[siren wailing] [vehicle leaving]

1912
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:12,440
[wind soughs]

1913
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,100
Go! Didn't he tell you to come tomorrow?

1914
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,930
[vehicle arrives]

1915
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:38,020
What is this, Athreya?

1916
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,390
After applying for a bail in the court,

1917
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,780
there is a high chance 
that it gets canceled.

1918
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,520
Why did you have to 
piss him off unnecessarily?

1919
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,650
We couldn't save Vasudha, sir.

1920
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:50,270
So?

1921
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,350
Sir...

1922
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,650
Can you find out about the autopsy 
report of the railway bridge body?

1923
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:00,510
[dials]

1924
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:04,400
Hello... Aditya.

1925
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:07,520
Hey Vamsi.. I was going to 
call about that dead body.

1926
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:08,280
Okay.

1927
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,980
It is neither a murder mor suicide

1928
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,230
It was a natural death 
because of liver failure.

1929
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:13,760
Natural death?

1930
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:16,900
Is there any chance to find 
out the details of the body?

1931
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:20,350
I've sent the fingerprints and 
hair samples to our database.

1932
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:23,830
-If we're lucky we might find a match.  
-No... No... No!

1933
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,980
Okay, Aditya. Thank you.

1934
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,440
How can this be a natural death?

1935
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:29,100
Three people have been killed over this.

1936
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:31,230
They've killed Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha.

1937
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,560
There is something huge is happening, 
how can it be a natural death?

1938
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,230
Let's go to Aditya and 
have a look at those reports.

1939
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,080
[vehicle starts]

1940
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,020
Shall I?

1941
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,480
Kick!

1942
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:04,440
Who are you?

1943
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:11,230
Why are you following me?

1944
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:17,270
What?

1945
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,350
Is it you who tied us or vice versa?

1946
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:22,350
If you know who I'm, you 
will untie me and salute.

1947
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,230
Uh-uh? Is that so?

1948
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:29,850
I have have track record of casually 
ending the careers of gangsters like you.

1949
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:33,290
I'm asking you one last time, who are you?

1950
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:43,030
[gun cocking]

1951
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,060
My name is Bala Venkata Subhramanya Swami.

1952
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,150
Since that is a mouthful, 
I've shortened it to Bobby.

1953
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:50,060
I'm from Hasan, Karnataka!

1954
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,190
Coming to the point,

1955
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:53,560
I've been following you since two days.

1956
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:54,730
Why are you following me?

1957
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:55,810
What do you mean?

1958
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,440
I'm a great detective in my town.

1959
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:59,100
That's what detectives do, isn't it?

1960
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,730
Moreover, I run the FBI agency too.

1961
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:02,230
What is the full form of FBI?

1962
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:04,690
Err... Friends Bureau Of Investigation!

1963
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:07,270
My friends contributed when I was 
starting up. So I named it after them.

1964
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,420
[smiles]

1965
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,440
Why are you laughing?

1966
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,660
You can check FBI Hasan page on Facebook.

1967
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,730
Sherlock Holmes has already liked my page.

1968
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,310
I thought he was alone.

1969
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,900
Seems like there is one 
moron in every state.

1970
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,270
And then?

1971
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,150
One day when I was visiting my native

1972
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:27,440
I came across a dead body.

1973
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,600
Nobody came forward to claim it.

1974
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,810
Eventually, cops cremated 
it as an unidentified body.

1975
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:37,350
That's when I received 
information that you have killed him.

1976
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
I've been trying to solve 
that case since then.

1977
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,650
That's why I'm following you.

1978
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:41,850
Did you get a call?

1979
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:42,440
Yes.

1980
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,300
Did they say it was me?

1981
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:43,980
Clear as day.

1982
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,150
And that's why you're following me?

1983
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:45,690
Of course.

1984
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,560
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

1985
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,650
My dear Bala Venkata Subramanya Swami!

1986
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:51,770
We've both been 
manipulated in the same way.

1987
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,150
They went the extra mile with you.

1988
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:55,350
You still don't get it, sir?

1989
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,560
They manipulated me into 
stalking Ajay and Harsha.

1990
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,400
Same...

1991
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,400
They painted me as a murderer 
and got this fellow to follow me.

1992
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,600
They killed those two guys and framed me.

1993
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,270
Now that I'm out on bail,

1994
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,190
they have planned to 
kill me and frame him.

1995
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:10,560
What a game, sir!

1996
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,480
We've been playing with a lot of 
involvement like a bunch of bozos!

1997
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,150
Do you take drugs, bro?

1998
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:16,350
No. Just drinks and smoke.

1999
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,770
Then start now. They're going 
to find drugs at your home soon.

2000
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,270
They're covering up their perfect 
crime and we are their patsy.

2001
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,770
We've been following each other like morons

2002
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:27,480
and been dancing to Ringa Ringa Roses!

2003
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,850
We've played very well!

2004
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,230
Very well played. God bless you!

2005
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,300
All this is a game?

2006
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,100
Haven't you killed anyone?

2007
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,190
What kind of a detective 
are you? Still don't get it?

2008
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,350
Just untie him...

2009
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:37,940
Please...

2010
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:39,470
Shucks!

2011
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,230
Why do they call is as game?

2012
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,020
Then who told me about the 
railway track dead body?

2013
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:50,270
It's all too confusing!

2014
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,020
What did you say?

2015
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:52,100
Detective!

2016
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:53,190
Not that. After that?

2017
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:54,800
-I'm going home... 
-What was that at the end?

2018
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,190
Body next to the railway track....

2019
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:02,290
[snapping]

2020
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,810
Sir, the body of Venkatachalam area's 
case was found next to the railway track.

2021
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,060
The body of Kavali area was 
also next to a railway bridge.

2022
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,480
Even this guy saw the 
body near a railway track.

2023
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:16,940
So?

2024
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,600
So...

2025
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:26,810
Hey, Sirish.

2026
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:27,650
Tell me

2027
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:30,020
Do you have a location wise 
list of all the unclaimed bodies

2028
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,600
that were found since last one year?

2029
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,440
I do have the list but 
I'm a little busy now.

2030
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:36,230
Hey, it is urgent. 
Can you send it to me immediately?

2031
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,900
I'm not at the office right now.

2032
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,770
Then send it with someone. Please!

2033
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:41,310
Okay. I'll ask a colleague to 
send it to you through email.

2034
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,550
-Okay?  
-Okay. Hurry up!

2035
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:43,260
Okay, bye.

2036
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,230
Athreya

2037
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:50,400
I've got news that they have 
applied for the cancellation of your bail.

2038
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,060
The hearing is at 11 am tomorrow.

2039
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,770
You might have to 
surrender in the afternoon.

2040
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:58,190
Agent,

2041
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,810
we got the email of list of 
unidentified dead bodies from Sirish.

2042
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:24,270
52 unidentified bodies were found 
in our state in the last six months.

2043
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,730
24 of those bodies,

2044
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,560
were found near 
railway tracks and bridges.

2045
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,440
Kakinada

2046
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:32,650
Tada

2047
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:35,810
All the bodies were found 
between these two stations.

2048
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:36,730
A few in Ongole,

2049
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:37,690
a few in Nellore,

2050
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:39,290
all of them were found 
near the railway tracks.

2051
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,980
These aren't unrelated 
cases like we thought, sir.

2052
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:43,730
They're all connected.

2053
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:44,810
Connected?

2054
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,650
Yes!

2055
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,230
How?

2056
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,900
These bodies are being dumped from 
the trains in this route.

2057
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,600
From the trains?

2058
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:54,770
Sir, we found a body near Venkatachalam.

2059
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:55,940
How did he die?

2060
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,020
Natural death.

2061
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:57,730
Exactly!

2062
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,230
Then, how did his body get to the track?

2063
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,310
Secondly,

2064
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,180
There is no approach road for a few 
places where these bodies have been found.

2065
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:10,310
How else are we finding these bodies 
near places without an approach road?

2066
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:12,270
The strongest possibility is that,

2067
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:14,440
the bodies are being dumped 
from the trains on this route.

2068
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,310
Won't a dead body catch 
attention on a train?

2069
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:18,150
What if the train...

2070
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,480
...is a goods train?

2071
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:21,150
Agent,

2072
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:23,060
why can't it be a passenger train?

2073
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,770
Just imagine,

2074
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,320
A passenger train with 
so many people around.

2075
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,650
It's impossible to pull this off.

2076
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,480
"Sir.. Can I have the side berth? 
I need to throw my dead bodies out"

2077
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:34,690
Imagine having to say this.

2078
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:35,730
So it has to be a goods train.

2079
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,850
Even on a goods train, 
they can't do this openly!

2080
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,100
They should be doing it at night.

2081
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,650
Hmm... It's impossible in daytime.

2082
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,100
Even if it is at night, it has to 
be done when everyone is sleeping.

2083
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:47,150
It has to be after 10 pm or before 5 am.

2084
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,020
-Bobby... 
-Agent

2085
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,610
Find out if there's any goods train moving 
after 10 pm on the Kakinada-Tada route.

2086
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,170
Okay.

2087
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,780
-Sneha  
-Agent!

2088
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,400
Get that map.

2089
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:57,560
Look, sir.

2090
01:38:58,690 --> 01:38:59,690
This is Kakinada.

2091
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:00,440
And this is Tada.

2092
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,100
The bodies found in the last 6 months...

2093
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:12,060
These bodies seem to be 
coming from Tamil Nadu, sir.

2094
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,020
How can you say that?

2095
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:15,850
Look... This is Tada.

2096
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,190
It's lies on the border of 
Andhra Pardesh and Tamil Nadu.

2097
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,270
So the first possibility is,

2098
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,150
this goods train begins in Tamil Nadu

2099
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:24,020
it enters Andhra Pradesh via Tada.

2100
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,600
As soon as they cross Tamil Nadu's border,

2101
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:28,270
they might be happily dumping these 
corpses everywhere in Andhra Pradesh.

2102
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,630
When the the state borders are crossed,

2103
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,070
the jurisdiction of 
police department changes.

2104
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,520
Even in the district level,

2105
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,980
the cops aren't able to spot the 
connection between the corpses.

2106
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,520
And when these bodies 
are from another state,

2107
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,520
there is no chance that 
they'd try to figure it out.

2108
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,150
In Tamil Nadu,

2109
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:41,810
In the stations after Tada,

2110
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,940
find out if there were any unidentified 
bodies recovered in the last 6 months.

2111
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,600
Sure.

2112
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:47,350
Sneha

2113
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:47,940
Agent

2114
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:49,690
What are the stations after Tada?

2115
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,770
After Tada,

2116
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,310
It's Aarambhaakam and Gummidipoondi.

2117
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,230
After that, it is Chennai outskirts.

2118
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:02,230
Agent

2119
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,230
Yes, what happened?

2120
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,700
There's a weekly goods 
train from Chennai to Delhi.

2121
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:06,360
Yes!

2122
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:07,770
Somewhere near Aarambhaakam,

2123
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,730
somewhere between 10 pm and 10.30 pm,

2124
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:13,270
This train stops at a red signal to 
make way for a super fast express trains

2125
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:14,650
Yes! Yes!

2126
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:15,150
Athreya

2127
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:15,770
Tell me, sir.

2128
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:20,020
There's no record of unidentified 
bodies between Tada and Chennai.

2129
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:20,980
Yes!

2130
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:22,270
So this train,

2131
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,650
stops for 30 minutes at Aarambhaakam.

2132
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:27,980
That's where these bodies are 
being loaded onto the trains.

2133
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:31,100
They start dumping them randomly 
soon as they cross Tamil Nadu's border.

2134
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:34,650
Agent, how can you be sure 
it is happening at that station?

2135
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:37,690
The stations before Aarambhaakam 
are Chennai and Chennai outskirts.

2136
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,190
These activities cannot happen 
at a major station like Chennai.

2137
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,270
They need a small station.

2138
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,900
That is Aarambhaakam.

2139
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:51,030
Why would they just dump these 
bodies with so much effort?

2140
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:52,730
To get to the bottom of this,

2141
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,070
We need to go to Aarambhaakam.

2142
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,440
Vamsi sir told that he would 
bring his car behind the market.

2143
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,640
[gunshots] 
Ah!

2144
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:09,600
Agent! 
[indistinct dogs barking]

2145
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:10,600
Agent!

2146
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,020
[pants]

2147
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,060
-Agent! 
-Agent!

2148
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:16,350
-Agent! 
-Agent!

2149
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,350
-[breathing heavily] 
-Sister, call the chief doctor urgently.

2150
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:21,950
[breathes heavily]

2151
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:24,630
Hi.

2152
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,100
Dummy gun doctor!

2153
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,810
Just makes sound and smoke.

2154
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,600
What about the blood?

2155
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:32,690
A little bit of Bru coffee powder and

2156
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:33,690
a little bit of vermilion...

2157
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:36,570
Mix them in water nicely and we will 
get nice amount of homemade blood.

2158
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,190
I swear!

2159
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:38,940
They're tracking everything I do.

2160
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,560
If they realise we're going to 
Aarambhaakam, they'll attack me again.

2161
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:45,600
If we need to reach Aarambhaakam secretly,

2162
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,380
Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya has to get 
admitted in the hospital for about 4 hours

2163
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:50,680
in critical condition. [wink mouth click]

2164
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,150
[whistles]

2165
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:55,020
What a perfect shoot bro!

2166
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,650
Come on... Lay down.

2167
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:02,230
You know what to do, right?

2168
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:03,940
-[breathes heavily] 
-Aah! Perfect!

2169
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:04,400
Some more!

2170
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:05,660
-[breathes heavily] 
-More...

2171
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:06,900
-[breathes heavily] 
-Peaks!

2172
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,810
Give him a blanket.

2173
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,940
They might have come here too.

2174
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,440
Can you please help me out, madam?

2175
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:14,270
Step out into the 
corridor for every 5 minutes,

2176
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,900
"Doctor... Doctor! 
Patient is Critical! Athreya!"

2177
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,190
"Athreya's BP is fluctuating!"

2178
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:20,310
Just keep making up 
something like this...

2179
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,980
Show me a sample once.

2180
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,020
Doctor! Patient is critical doctor! 
BP is going down doctor!

2181
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:27,940
Come fast doctor! Please doctor!

2182
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,190
You are a great actress... 
[beatboxing]

2183
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:34,570
Great... Let's go now!

2184
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,440
It's mine.

2185
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,230
You guys go on, I'll change up...

2186
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,190
Boss, someone shot 
Athreya! He's in the ICU.

2187
01:42:42,230 --> 01:42:43,440
Keep an eye on him and give me updates.

2188
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,020
What happened, Bobby? 
What's the band-aid for?

2189
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:56,880
[speaks in Kannada]

2190
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:01,440
Oh sorry, I got excited 
and spoke in Kannada.

2191
01:43:02,490 --> 01:43:05,650
I'd understand this dialogue even 
if you spoke in Chinese or Japanese.

2192
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,440
How?

2193
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:09,310
We've seen this same scene 
in Telugu several times.

2194
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,150
Hey... Same pinch!

2195
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:25,900
It is said that, everybody has 7 
doppelgangers in this world.

2196
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:27,440
Two of them are roaming 
in front of me now.

2197
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,450
[smiles]

2198
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:34,690
[phone ringing] 
Lets go sir!

2199
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:38,440
Tell me Aditya

2200
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:40,480
The finger prints of the dead 
body found at Venkatachalam,

2201
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:42,600
matched with a murder 
case suspect in Gujarat.

2202
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:44,760
-What? 
-What?

2203
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:47,190
I'll send the details in a few hours.

2204
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:48,740
Okay.

2205
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,350
Murder case in Gujarat?

2206
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:55,520
What is happening, sir?

2207
01:43:56,170 --> 01:44:02,170
[indistinct train honking] 
[indistinct railway announcement]

2208
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:08,560
Hello, sir. 
I'm the Nellore Sub Inspector!

2209
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,270
I need some information.

2210
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,230
How can I help you?

2211
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:12,270
Once a week,

2212
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,100
a goods train passes through 
your station at around 10 pm.

2213
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:14,980
It reaches Delhi.

2214
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,770
Yes.

2215
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,520
When it halts here, is there any 
chance of illegal activities...

2216
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,100
-I mean anyone... 
-Who would come here, sir?

2217
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:22,810
I've been working in this 
station for a long time...

2218
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,560
The goods train stops for 30 minutes.

2219
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:28,270
I've never noticed any 
illegal activities in that time...

2220
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,230
Gopalam!

2221
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,020
What are these photos, sir?

2222
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:37,230
This was taken at a 
railway event 5 years ago.

2223
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:41,730
These guys are famous actors in 
the nearby village theater groups.

2224
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:43,020
They performed a play for us.

2225
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:44,060
Drama company?

2226
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:44,770
Yes, sir.

2227
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,270
Where is this drama company?

2228
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,520
They're closed now.

2229
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:50,270
Where were they based before?

2230
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,190
I don't know, sir.

2231
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:52,810
Do you know, sir?

2232
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:55,230
I know... it's about 30km away from here.

2233
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,020
Athreya is not in the hospital.

2234
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,400
Kill Gopalam before he gets there.

2235
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,310
Okay. I'll take care.

2236
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:12,230
Who's the fool bringing me liquor?

2237
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,400
I asked for whiskey

2238
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,810
Why did you bring beer?

2239
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,520
This is cheating. I'm going to complain.

2240
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,020
Police!

2241
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:21,190
Police!

2242
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:22,600
Police!

2243
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,100
Who the hell are you?

2244
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,440
You called the police, didn't you?

2245
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:28,960
Eh?

2246
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:30,800
[splashes]

2247
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,060
Where are we, sir?

2248
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:40,060
Who are you?

2249
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:41,310
Give me a small peg of booze,

2250
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,810
I'll tell you everything.

2251
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:44,650
Enough?

2252
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:46,190
Or do you want a large?

2253
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:53,900
Until 3 years ago, 
we were absolutely jobless,

2254
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,580
just aimlessly roaming 
around in the village.

2255
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,650
I got a phone call one day.  
[phone rings]

2256
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,410
They offered a job.

2257
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,440
They promised to pay.

2258
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:04,250
Hello?

2259
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:05,980
Where do I need to come?

2260
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,600
Okay. I'll be there.

2261
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:10,150
Coming... I'm coming.

2262
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,850
[tyres screech]

2263
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:52,770
We were asked to take those 
bodies to the state border and

2264
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:55,770
cremate them in the forests discretely.

2265
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:10,960
[fire crackling]

2266
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,480
It started with 3 to 4 bodies a month,

2267
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,440
and grew up to 7-8 bodies a month.

2268
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,190
We got paid 5000 per body.

2269
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:34,310
We were so happy.

2270
01:47:58,730 --> 01:47:59,730
One day,

2271
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,650
as we were going about 
the usual forest cremations,

2272
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:03,850
the Forest Police spotted us.

2273
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:06,190
[siren wailing]Somehow we got away.

2274
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:09,440
The guys who hired us found out about it.

2275
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:10,730
Don't worry.

2276
01:48:11,230 --> 01:48:12,940
Stay out of sight for a couple of weeks!

2277
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:20,440
For someone like us who 
lived off minor thefts,

2278
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:22,900
Losing all the money from this job,

2279
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:25,020
Losing this easy money opportunity...

2280
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,480
Worried us a lot!

2281
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:29,900
Later, exactly after 2 weeks...

2282
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:31,400
We got a phone call  
[phone rings]

2283
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,060
This time they decided 
not to burn the bodies.

2284
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,560
We took them to another 
guy with a van instead.

2285
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,060
The bodies were kept in those 
vans for about 7 to 8 hours.

2286
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,400
And then given back to us.

2287
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,150
Store those bodies for the entire 
week in the places we showed you.

2288
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:01,190
Dump them all together at once.

2289
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:13,310
Then we made the bodies completely 
unidentifiable even if they were found

2290
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:15,980
and carried them over to Aarambhaakam.

2291
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:31,020
Delhi goods train stops at 
Aarambhaakam for about 30 minutes.

2292
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:33,230
We brought the dead bodies there,

2293
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,350
loaded them on to the train

2294
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:42,940
and dumped them each at a different 
place after crossing the border.

2295
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:26,350
What is this?

2296
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:27,940
Why are they doing this?

2297
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,560
Where do these bodies come from?

2298
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,100
We never understood all that.

2299
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:33,350
We never questioned it either.

2300
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:34,660
[woman weeping]

2301
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:35,850
But...

2302
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:37,480
One day...

2303
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:39,450
we finally understood what's happening.

2304
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,520
You will handle the cremation, won't you?

2305
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:44,020
Would you scatter their 
ashes in the holy Ganges?

2306
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,850
Scattering the ashes of a 
dead person in the holy Ganges

2307
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:54,880
will bring peace to the soul. 
This is a common Hindu belief.

2308
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:58,650
If the cremation happens on 
the banks of the Ganges at Kasi,

2309
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:02,650
the soul will reach heaven and there will 
be no rebirth. This is another belief.

2310
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:05,100
People who strongly believed in this,

2311
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:08,350
but couldn't afford going to 
the holy Ganges to cremate.

2312
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:13,540
The innocent public who had no idea 
how to get to Kasi were targeted.

2313
01:51:13,730 --> 01:51:15,810
Convincing them that the 
cremation would be taken care of

2314
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:19,440
money was collected from them only to dupe 
them and dump the bodies at random places

2315
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:20,530
is what we understood was happening.

2316
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,190
Just to keep their trust going...

2317
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,850
We pretended to perform some pujas 
before taking the dead bodies.

2318
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:31,270
We tied a small locket having 
Goddess Durga imprint to the dead bodies.

2319
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:33,270
People's faith in us grew.

2320
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:37,270
Word of these activities spread 
to neighboring villages and states.

2321
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,310
The number of bodies we 
needed to dispose grew.

2322
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:43,940
Cremation has to be 
done within 2 to 3 days.

2323
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:48,020
Otherwise, it is believed that the soul 
roams this world forever without peace.

2324
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:54,060
We convince people saying that it takes 
3 days to take the dead bodies to Kasi

2325
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:58,350
and take the dead 
bodies as early as possible.

2326
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,270
For 3 years,

2327
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,100
The whole process has 
been running smoothly.

2328
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,100
Last month, I suddenly fell sick.

2329
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,650
I was admitted in a hospital for 2 weeks.

2330
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:09,770
The dead bodies we had were 
decaying in our godown for 10 days.

2331
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:12,900
I got a phone call and I was 
told we couldn't wait anymore.

2332
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:14,350
Ad I couldn't go,

2333
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:16,480
I have sent someone else in my place.

2334
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:18,650
But I don't know what 
happened on that day.

2335
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:20,600
I don't know what 
happened to the guy I've sent.

2336
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:21,980
And then,

2337
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:24,850
I got a phone saying that we 
needed to stop this for a few days.

2338
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,190
Not just that...

2339
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:28,440
They sent me those 3 numbers,

2340
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,970
showed me the photo of an untraceable girl

2341
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,600
and asked me to cook up a 
story and narrate to you.

2342
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:35,980
I swear! It's the truth!

2343
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,560
Who's the guy calling you?

2344
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,650
I really don't know that.

2345
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,560
Why are the bodies being 
shifted into the vans?

2346
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:43,350
I don't know, sir.

2347
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,440
So you don't know who they are?

2348
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,560
I always got calls from 
some landline number.

2349
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:49,600
Who they are,

2350
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:50,900
What they do...

2351
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:52,190
How many of them there are...

2352
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,520
I know none of these things...

2353
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:54,400
Also,

2354
01:53:54,690 --> 01:53:58,100
I don't even know what they do to 
the dead bodies in their vehicles.

2355
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:58,700
I swear!

2356
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:01,940
Let's go.

2357
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,460
-Hello. Okay. Take a right from there... 
-You go on... I'll catch up!

2358
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,100
Come straight from there 
and take the first left,

2359
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:16,100
Adjacent to that is a godown 
[siren wailing]

2360
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,100
We're right here

2361
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,100
You're taking away so many 
bodies without the funeral.

2362
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:25,710
Don't the relatives or neighbours ask 
any questions about the dead body?

2363
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:28,940
Those who ask are told a story, 
that the bodies need to be cremated soon

2364
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,730
or the soul will be cursed...

2365
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:33,650
Or sometimes we say,

2366
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,230
"Burning the body during Panchak Kaal,"

2367
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,650
"is bad for the village and the family,"

2368
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:38,900
"that's why"

2369
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:41,100
"the body was cremated immediately..."

2370
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:42,900
Another story we tell is that,

2371
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:47,060
"Cremating in the early hours would 
send the body straight to heaven..."

2372
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,940
"There will not be anymore rebirth cycle"

2373
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:51,060
"That's why the program had to 
be done before everyone came"

2374
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:53,770
These are a few cover 
stories we prepared for them.

2375
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,940
[phone ringing]

2376
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:10,800
Uncle.

2377
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:12,050
Tell me, Seenu.

2378
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:14,090
Why did you cremate mom before I reached?

2379
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,780
I did tell you about 
the Panchak Kaal, didn't I?

2380
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,340
Uncle!

2381
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,590
Tell the truth, Uncle.

2382
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:26,670
They said cremating her near 
the Ganga was a great blessing...

2383
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,450
[disconnects call]

2384
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:06,840
When I was in school,

2385
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,090
When I wrote to my mom saying 
I was afraid to be alone without her.

2386
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:13,840
She would come to my hostel within 2 days.

2387
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,960
The only memories worth remembering 
in my life were with my mother.

2388
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:42,050
I lost my father in my very childhood.

2389
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,960
She was my everything.

2390
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,800
Then one day they told 
me she had passed away.

2391
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:56,630
I went home and she's not there.

2392
01:56:58,340 --> 01:56:59,630
I couldn't understand a thing.

2393
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:06,670
I couldn't see her for one last time.

2394
01:57:09,130 --> 01:57:11,710
Knowing that I wasn't next to 
my mother when she needed me...

2395
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,750
keeps eating away at me everyday.

2396
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:17,050
After all that she had done for me,

2397
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:22,550
I couldn't at least be there and cremate 
her properly. That pain is haunting me.

2398
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:25,550
For a very long time,

2399
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:27,750
I was convinced that she's still alive

2400
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,500
I couldn't see her one last time.

2401
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:33,380
When someone dies,

2402
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:36,300
we cremate them.

2403
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:39,710
That is the respect we show them, 
for the life they have lived.

2404
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:42,380
I couldn't even do that 
much for my mother!

2405
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:47,840
They're dumped from trains?

2406
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,340
They're dumped like trash?

2407
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:52,340
My mother...

2408
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:57,880
Not just me,

2409
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:02,670
A lot of people like me are not able to 
see their mother, father, sister, brother

2410
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,170
for one last time all because of 
some rogue's ridiculous business.

2411
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:22,460
When Gopalam doesn't know who his boss is

2412
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,590
how are we going to find out?

2413
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:35,130
Give me that.

2414
01:58:47,210 --> 01:58:48,550
Sir, can you please call your friend once?

2415
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:56,880
Hello

2416
01:58:57,090 --> 01:58:58,960
Hello Aditya, Athreya 
wants to speak to you

2417
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:01,000
-Sir  
-Yes, Athreya

2418
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:03,300
When did the Gujarat murder happen?

2419
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:05,590
One minute.

2420
01:59:09,590 --> 01:59:10,420
5 days ago.

2421
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,170
When might be the time of death for the 
dead body that was found in Venkatachalam?

2422
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:17,960
10 days.

2423
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:18,880
Thank you, sir.

2424
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,840
How did someone who died 10 days ago,

2425
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:24,780
kill someone 5 days ago?

2426
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,340
You can always be caught when you 
remove any organ form a human body, sir.

2427
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:34,460
There is one thing in our body that 
can be stolen without getting caught.

2428
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:38,920
Our fingerprints.

2429
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,840
They need these dead bodies 
to collect the fingerprints off them.

2430
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:48,880
What will they do 
with these fingerprints?

2431
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,960
You can plant these finger prints 
at any crime scene in the country.

2432
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:54,960
You can completely deviate 
a criminal investigation.

2433
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,590
You can create a 'fake fingerprint' 
database and sell it to criminal gangs.

2434
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,300
This is exactly the way it 
happened in the Venkatachalam case.

2435
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,630
They must have planted these 
prints at some crime scene in Gujarat.

2436
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,670
The local police might be investigating 
the case considering him as a suspect.

2437
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:11,000
They may never find out whom 
the finger prints belong to.

2438
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:12,670
Even if they do find out,

2439
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:14,710
this man is already dead!

2440
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:16,960
So they will conclude that,

2441
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,840
the murderer is already dead 
and close the case right away.

2442
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:24,750
This is a mastermind plan to 
perfectly deviate a crime.

2443
02:00:25,170 --> 02:00:26,550
Not just a crime deviation,

2444
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:31,380
Fake finger prints can be used to 
create new voters and rig elections.

2445
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:34,550
Terrorists who switch their identities 
with fake passports and Visas

2446
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:38,000
can carry out their plans 
in any country without getting caught.

2447
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:40,670
These fake finger prints are 
a necessity for all of them.

2448
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:42,880
If all they wanted was finger prints,

2449
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:44,380
couldn't they just take 
them off any dead body?

2450
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:47,090
Retrieving finger prints off 
a dead body is not easy, Bobby.

2451
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,500
When we die, our body loses 
Oxygen and blood supply

2452
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,380
extracting fingerprints after 
that is very challenging.

2453
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,400
Like Gopalam said,

2454
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,960
that's why they have been 
shifting the bodies into a mobile van.

2455
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:59,050
They probably have some sort of 
a lab setup in the mobile van.

2456
02:00:59,130 --> 02:01:01,460
They must be chemically 
extracting these fingerprints.

2457
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,880
It'll take at least 6 
to 7 hours to do this.

2458
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,620
That's why they planned whole charade.

2459
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,340
The bodies are stored in a 
warehouse after extraction.

2460
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,420
Later they were simply 
dumped off from the trains.

2461
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,000
Why?

2462
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:18,090
Because the railway department cremates 
unidentified bodies within 3 to 4 days.

2463
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,840
They are fully aware of this loophole.

2464
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:22,300
That single loophole is the 
capital for this business.

2465
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:27,920
Gopalam said that they wanted 
to stop operations a while ago.

2466
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:32,190
For them to stop a foolproof 
systematically run business suddenly,

2467
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:33,270
can mean only one thing.

2468
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:35,500
They feared they were 
going to be exposed!

2469
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:39,310
This fear means that they 
did a mistake somewhere.

2470
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:41,920
-Sneha. 
-Agent.

2471
02:01:42,210 --> 02:01:45,210
Where are Ajay's Ongole photos 
and unidentified bodies file?

2472
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:46,710
At the office.

2473
02:01:48,950 --> 02:01:51,200
Sir, Bobby and I will go 
study those photos again.

2474
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:51,710
Okay.

2475
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:52,800
A small request,

2476
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,220
Can you ask Narayana

2477
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:56,160
to bring us the belongings of the 
dead body found at Venkatachalam?

2478
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:56,710
Sure.

2479
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,130
We're missing a clue there.

2480
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,300
We might know it if we study it again.

2481
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:01,710
Sir, one more thing.

2482
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:04,000
Can you both visit Ajay 
and Harsha's college?

2483
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:04,800
College?

2484
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,820
-Yes. 
-Why?

2485
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,340
Any background information we 
have on them is important for us.

2486
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:09,140
Okay.

2487
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:16,920
Sir, these are the belongings of the dead 
body that was found at Venkatachalam.

2488
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:18,550
This issue...

2489
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:19,500
No problem

2490
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:23,070
[shutter opens]

2491
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:39,800
Hand me the constable's cover.

2492
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:45,960
We need to meet the principal.

2493
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:47,090
Last room on the ground floor, sir.

2494
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:48,170
Hmm... Okay.

2495
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,460
Hey, aren't you done yet?

2496
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:50,630
-Almost done sir! [phone ringing] 
-How much longer?

2497
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:51,420
2 minutes, sir.

2498
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:56,710
Sir, Athreya's bail has been cancelled.

2499
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:58,170
We have the orders to arrest him.

2500
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:01,390
-Narayana. 
-Sir.

2501
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:02,770
-Let's move. 
-Okay, sir.

2502
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,880
This is the dead body's photo that 
was clicked by Ajay and Harsha in Ongole.

2503
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,380
This was tied to the 
Venkatachalam body's hand.

2504
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:30,170
Why do they have the same talisman?

2505
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:35,550
This is the talisman 
of Goddess Bethaballi.

2506
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,170
There is a district 
called Vellore in Tamil Nadu.

2507
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:39,750
She's a popular deity there.

2508
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:40,590
Goddess' talisman?

2509
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:45,090
Remember what Gopalam said?

2510
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,130
Sometimes they pretend to do 
pujas and tie talismans on the bodies

2511
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:50,300
which is then removed 
before dumping the body.

2512
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:52,250
Gopalam didn't go that day.

2513
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,420
So, the new guy who went in his place

2514
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:56,170
knows nothing about these talismans.

2515
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,340
That's why these two bodies 
still have the talisman on them.

2516
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,710
These guys must have come 
searching for these talismans.

2517
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,880
The bodies are dumped at random location.

2518
02:04:03,590 --> 02:04:05,590
By the time they 
found the exact locations,

2519
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:09,550
these bodies were seen by Ajay & Harsha in 
Ongole, and I saw it in Venkatachalam.

2520
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:11,210
That's where they might have seen us.

2521
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:13,010
What is the problem if 
the talismans are found?

2522
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:16,250
We need details of your old students 
Ajay and Harsha for an investigation.

2523
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:19,420
A girl who was their classmate 
is working here as a lecturer.

2524
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,960
She may be able to help 
you with anything you need.

2525
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,910
-Okay. 
-Raghu, take them.

2526
02:04:28,750 --> 02:04:29,670
That is the route to Athreya's office.

2527
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,880
Why are they so worried about this?

2528
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,710
There must be a connection 
to them and this talisman.

2529
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,300
What is it? What's the 
connection? What is it? What is it?

2530
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:42,090
What do we know about them?

2531
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,670
They promise a funeral at Varanasi and

2532
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:47,060
cheat people by 
orchestrating a perfect religious crime.

2533
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,670
Such people shamelessly use 
God's name for everything.

2534
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:52,730
Sai baba industries, 
Balaji textiles and more such names.

2535
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:56,800
What if they have a 
business named after this Goddess?

2536
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:00,460
Maybe they're running an 
organization with this symbol.

2537
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:03,460
Do one thing,

2538
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:07,300
Any organization in this district 
with this deity's name or symbol,

2539
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,550
from small shops to 
large companies... anything

2540
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:11,090
Make a list of all of them... Quick!

2541
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:13,090
What do they have in common, ma'am?

2542
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,460
I mean... Friends or enemies?

2543
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,460
Any incident in the college in 
which they were both involved in?

2544
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:19,750
Nothing of that sort

2545
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:22,210
But they did do their 
final year project together.

2546
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:25,170
Oh! What's it about? 
Can I see that project?

2547
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:33,550
Religious crimes in India?

2548
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah!

2549
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:37,500
It's about how public are cheated 
by criminals in the name of religion.

2550
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:40,000
They have worked for almost 
six months on this material.

2551
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:41,750
Vasudha?

2552
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:43,590
Vasudha is their friend too.

2553
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:45,170
All three of them worked on this project.

2554
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:47,210
Sir, these three of them were friends.

2555
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:51,200
-All three of them know about this crime.-Madam.

2556
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,380
That's why these three were killed!

2557
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:58,250
Here are all the details about them.

2558
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:04,960
Ma'am, can we take these photos 
and project material with us?

2559
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:18,960
"Bethaballi Amman"

2560
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:20,130
That's the deity's name, isn't it?

2561
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:24,590
Bethaballi Amman milk diary, 
Bethaballi Amman Textiles,

2562
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:26,340
Bethaballi Amman NGO...

2563
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:29,950
[shutter opens]

2564
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:34,670
Did you find anything at the college?

2565
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,460
Yeah, agent!

2566
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:38,550
Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha were 
close friends and classmates.

2567
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:39,050
What?

2568
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,930
Their only common point is 
the project they did together.

2569
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:44,550
"Religious Crimes in India"

2570
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:46,500
These are their photos.

2571
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,800
They did a project on Religious 
crimes which means

2572
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,500
they might be knowing 
everything about these crimes.

2573
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,050
That's why they were killed.

2574
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:02,340
Business with corpses!

2575
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:05,090
They are highly intelligent, Agent.

2576
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:07,340
They are dead bodies anyway

2577
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:10,960
No complaints... No risk!

2578
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:14,260
What did you say?

2579
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:15,750
Yeah, Agent...

2580
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,300
all the relatives think that the 
body was cremated in Varanasi,

2581
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:20,210
who would lodge a complaint?

2582
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:54,860
[smiles]

2583
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:02,880
None of the railway track bodies 
had any missing complaints.... Right?

2584
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:05,050
Except for one.

2585
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:05,880
Whose?

2586
02:08:06,340 --> 02:08:07,190
The dead body that was found at Kavali.

2587
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:09,170
Her father filed a missing complaint.

2588
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:10,670
Red dress...

2589
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,460
Mom's face tattooed onto the hand...

2590
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:15,750
Tell me one thing, sir.

2591
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:19,210
How does the tattoo from her childhood

2592
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,050
and the one on the dead body...

2593
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,630
go missing from her 
hand in this photo?

2594
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:32,670
That's because Vasudha is still alive!

2595
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:35,880
All these things are being done 
by the father and daughter duo!

2596
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:47,840
If Vasudha is alive...

2597
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:50,250
Why did they fake her death?

2598
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,840
They made me believe 
that some Divya was dead.

2599
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,420
They framed me in the murder 
case of Ajay and Harsha.

2600
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:00,250
If that plan had worked, 
I would've been locked up for 10 years.

2601
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,650
But there were two mistakes in their plan.

2602
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:05,710
One: I saw Divya.

2603
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:06,880
Two:

2604
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:10,960
As there was a sub jail CCTV footage 
of mine at the time of Ajay's death,

2605
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:12,560
I got the bail.

2606
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:14,590
It was just Ajay and Harsha earlier.

2607
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:16,710
But now there is Athreya too.

2608
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,500
If these three people ever meet,

2609
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:22,550
With the details which 
Athreya had collected,

2610
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:25,000
and with the photos that 
Ajay and Harsha have...

2611
02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:30,590
The clue of the talisman would be easily 
known if they compare those details.

2612
02:09:31,590 --> 02:09:33,460
If they start looking 
into the talismans...

2613
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:35,800
it will lead them straight to us!

2614
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:37,840
Where's Gopalam?

2615
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:41,670
Ask him to find an 
untraceable girl's photo.

2616
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,420
Name her Divya

2617
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:45,710
and tell the story that 
I prepared to Athreya.

2618
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:48,130
Along with Ajay and Harsha's number,

2619
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,340
give one of my old numbers 
that has no photo in the database.

2620
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:51,460
No photo?

2621
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:53,750
This photo of the third 
number is not in the database.

2622
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:58,000
Athreya will be busy 
investigating those three numbers.

2623
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:01,250
He will come searching 
for all three of us.

2624
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:04,050
He will anyway not know about me,

2625
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:07,050
So, he will carefully 
stalk Ajay and Harsha.

2626
02:10:08,170 --> 02:10:09,920
Then, we will kill Ajay and Harsha.

2627
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:12,670
All the evidences will 
be made against Athreya.

2628
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,920
Ajay and Harsha will be dead.

2629
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:17,300
And Athreya will go to prison.

2630
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,300
Their plan failed and I came out on bail.

2631
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:24,630
If I investigate the murders of Ajay 
and Harsha and reach their college

2632
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,920
I would find that 
Vasudha was their classmate.

2633
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,840
Just to shift my attention 
away from Vasudha,

2634
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,420
they shifted to plan B

2635
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:32,300
Which was,

2636
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:35,550
To make everyone believe 
that Vasudha was dead.

2637
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:36,920
They came to the station,

2638
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:39,840
Her dad complained about 
some life threat to his daughter

2639
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:41,840
And then he files a missing complaint

2640
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,420
We were frantically running 
around trying to save Vasudha.

2641
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,130
So when her dad showed us a body, 
we naturally believed it was Vasudha.

2642
02:10:48,460 --> 02:10:53,550
"3 criminology graduates, died while 
investigating a religious crime!"

2643
02:10:53,650 --> 02:10:54,750
That was supposed to be 
headline to conclude this drama!

2644
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:59,050
How did Athreya even 
suspect Gopalam?

2645
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:01,840
We missed something.

2646
02:11:03,090 --> 02:11:06,460
He can unravel our 
entire business in 2 days.

2647
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:08,840
I thought putting him 
in jail would suffice.

2648
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:11,840
But he managed to get the bail 
because of that sub jail footage.

2649
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:15,090
This time, kill him before 
he gets to the jail.

2650
02:11:15,630 --> 02:11:17,380
There's another detective in Hasan,

2651
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:19,130
get him to follow Athreya.

2652
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:23,090
Just repeat what we 
did for Ajay and Harsha.

2653
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:26,130
Make sure they find drug 
packets with both of them.

2654
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,800
This should appear to 
be a drug mafia case.

2655
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,710
File a fake complaint 
saying that I have a life threat.

2656
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:34,210
After that, we have to fake my death.

2657
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:37,230
That's the reason I've gave my my phone 
number in the database with no photo.

2658
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:40,670
When Athreya learns about my death,

2659
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,630
he will assume that it is the work of 
the killers who killed Ajay and Harsha.

2660
02:11:44,710 --> 02:11:47,670
Even if he does go to the 
college and find out about us,

2661
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,550
We won't have any risk.

2662
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:51,770
Those three are criminology graduates.

2663
02:11:53,210 --> 02:11:57,210
They have a good knowledge about 
general crimes and religious crimes.

2664
02:11:58,710 --> 02:12:00,380
Ajay and Harsha used it for good.

2665
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,420
But this girl used it 
for the wrong reasons.

2666
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:05,130
We got away this time.

2667
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:07,250
Can't take that risk again.

2668
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:11,090
Buried bodies might 
eventually turn up somewhere.

2669
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:13,500
So let's use this loophole 
in the railway department.

2670
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,500
The dead bodies they recover 
are kept for 72 hours.

2671
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:21,550
Since no one is coming to 
claim, they'll burn the bodies.

2672
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,170
People who cheat others 
have a simple technique, sir.

2673
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:53,130
They carry out random philanthropic 
gimmicks for society such as

2674
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:57,000
distributing free food, running hospitals, 
blood donation camps and

2675
02:12:57,090 --> 02:12:58,590
all sorts of showy gimmicks!

2676
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,130
Because they need to 
win the people's trust.

2677
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:03,300
This religious crimes 
project has all the details.

2678
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:07,710
Even these guys are 
running a gimmick as a cover.

2679
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,550
That gimmick is called, 
"Bethaballi Amman NGO"

Nothing Agent

2687
02:14:18,170 --> 02:14:19,250
As we have caught Gopalam,

2688
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,830
she has cleaned up and 
got away in the meantime.

2689
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:23,630
We're late.

2690
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,830
She got away!

2691
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:25,500
Okay, let's go!

2692
02:14:26,290 --> 02:14:27,100
Let's go to Rajasthan.

2693
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,630
Why Rajasthan?

2694
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:29,960
Don't you want to catch Vasudha?

2695
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:32,420
But what's in Rajasthan?

2696
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:34,540
Stop expecting me to explain everything.

2697
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:43,930
What's next?

2698
02:14:44,510 --> 02:14:45,430
[door slams open]

2699
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:47,720
I'll tell you what's you should do next.

2700
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,100
Check the beer bottles outside.

2701
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:07,100
Someone didn't drink it 
all, there's still half left.

2702
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:08,510
Because they must have left in a hurry.

2703
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:11,600
The earth is wet, 
probably rained in the morning.

2704
02:15:11,890 --> 02:15:14,160
The tried to burn all the evidence 
but the fire is still going

2705
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:16,100
So they must have lit up 
the fire after the rain stopped.

2706
02:15:16,510 --> 02:15:17,600
They should have done it 
probably before one or two hours ago.

2707
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:19,180
Check these footprints,

2708
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,550
3 sets of prints are leaving the NGO.

2709
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:24,890
But there aren't any car 
or tire marks anywhere.

2710
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:26,140
So they haven't left by road.

2711
02:15:26,510 --> 02:15:29,620
They have only one option 
left to escape this place quickly.

2712
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,760
[indistinct train honking] 
That railway station!

2713
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:35,510
Everything here points to the fact 
that they were here until an hour ago.

2714
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:38,600
The only train that left from 
this station in the last hour,

2715
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,140
Train to Bikaner.

2716
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:42,470
Rajasthan.

2717
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:47,010
Didn't you book Rajasthan tickets 
for your mother last week?

2718
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,050
Yes, agent!

2719
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:51,010
We're taking the same train next 
week for the Karni Mata festival.

2720
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:51,850
Exactly!

2721
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:55,350
People believe that the Goddess 
appears as a white rat at this time

2722
02:15:55,850 --> 02:16:00,030
There will be several people with 
such beliefs who will flock there now.

2723
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:03,600
For a fraud like Vasudha... 
they are the easy targets!

2724
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:08,350
The case is closed, right?

2725

You keep your face in such 
a way as if someone died!

2729
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:21,390
But you're actually happy 
if someone dies, aren't you?

2730
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,820
Because you can happily steal 
and sell their fingerprints.

2731
02:16:25,430 --> 02:16:26,930

02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:15,720
why did you come anyway?

2773
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:20,760
Agent Sai Srinivas Athreya knows 
that Smt Mahalakshmi isn't here.

2774
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:24,100
But Mahalakshmi's son 
Seenu doesn't know that.

2775
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:29,790
[engine starts]

2776
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:36,760
How could they cheat so many 
people and pull of their business?

2777
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,180
We hope that talismans 
bring us good luck

2778
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:43,470
We fear that black cats bring us bad luck.

2779
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,390
Human sacrifices show 
hopes of hidden treasures

2780
02:18:46,430 --> 02:18:49,220
Evil wardings fight off fear of demons.

2781
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,970
Hoping for good to happen

2782
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,930
and fearing the bad 
that may happen

2783
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:57,100
can make a human blindly 
believe in anything!

2784
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:00,680
Their business isn't with people.

2785
02:19:01,430 --> 02:19:02,530
It's with their beliefs.

2786
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:26,050
I saw the movie Bahubali 
2 on NetFlix last night.

2787
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:31,220
Actually I had solved the case of 'why 
did Kattappa kill Bahubali' long ago.

2788
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:34,100
I knew the answer when Rajamouli 
sir was making the movie Eega!

2789
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:36,300
Why did Kattappa kill him?

2790
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:38,600
You haven't seen Bahubali?

2791
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:39,350
No

[curses in fictional language 'Kiliki']

2793
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:55,470
Why did Kattappa kill him?

2794
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:57,640
He fell of the building 
and died last night.

2795
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,100
They're say the he jumped at around 4 am.

2796
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:01,550
We need to find out if it 
is a suicide or murder.

2797
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:02,350
Let's go

2798
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:08,060
[snips]

2799
02:21:08,830 --> 02:21:09,640
When did this happen?

2800
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,000
Any clues?

2801
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:12,100
-We found the murder weapon 
-FBI!

2802
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:13,790
-What? 
-FBI.

2803
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:14,740
-FBI?

2804
02:21:15,180 --> 02:21:16,390
Isn't that in America?

2806
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,930
Fatima was my first love, sir.

Our headquarters is in 
vegetable market Nellore.

2808
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:25,720

Case solved.

2815

Huh!

2816
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:54,070
[chuckles]

2817
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:08,390
Did he hit you too hard, sir?

2818
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:10,750
The reason why 
kattappa killed Bahubali is...
