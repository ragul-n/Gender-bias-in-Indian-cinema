00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:16,105
It's terrible to be run out
when you're batting well.

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,673
It may happen because
of your own fault...

3
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,550
...or because of your partner's mistake.

4
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,522
Tobacco harms you when you smoke...

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,583
...or someone else smokes around you.

6
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,129
Be smart. Stay away from tobacco.

7
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,495
Don't be run out.

8
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,262
Which goddamn building is this!

9
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,404
Take off the cooling glass and look,
you dumbhead!

10
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,607
Oh, it's our college!!

11
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,076
If not submitted today..

12
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,476
Where are you girls going?

13
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,103
Got to submit assignment today.

14
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,309
Shall submit the assignment together.
Its this Riyaska words

15
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,350
As you say.

16
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,477
You got two challenging questions
from this Riyaska today.

17
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,782
Efforts gone in vain!

18
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,211
Do it later.

19
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,723
Dude, come here.

20
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,588
It's final year. At least now
try to learn some attitude!

21
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,360
Attitude won't work in such cases!

22
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,291
Got to have some glamour also.

23
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,399
Poor guys! I'm going, guys-

24
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,396
Hey, don't misunderstand me.

25
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,664
Let's go.

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,734
You deserve it for befriending CS rascal!

27
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,539
- Didn't bathe today?
- Drive the car.

28
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,708
Reached Cemetery!

29
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,342
- What is this?
- G0t Ji0's Wifi?

30
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,344
What is wrong with them?

31
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,079
Some are reading, some are fidgeting.

32
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,120
Yes!

33
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,383
What to say about this Jolly Miss!?

34
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,387
- She wishes to see me every now and then!
- As if!!

35
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,261
Do I look so handsome?

36
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,596
It's not that.
Jolly miss calls you to check if I'm here!

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,670
You go and tell her I'm here.

38
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,730
Sure. Let me go and chat with her
for sometime and be back.

39
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,168
- What is going on there?
- VIVA!

40
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,302
Very good.

41
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,304
See and learn.

42
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,081
- Last question.
- Miss!

43
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,543
Where is the bearing?

44
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,084
Gone awry!

45
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,284
- Where?
- Show.

46
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,227
Protect me O Lord!

47
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,354
- Is this the one , sir?
- Very good.

48
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,466
It's the right answer

49
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:50,728
<i>Athmaram'.!</i>

50
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,795
- You can go now.
- Okay sir.

51
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,504
Yes!!

52
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,239
Miss, see you later, ok

53
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:08,280
Thus I become the pride of this college

54
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,323
Your head ache is gone?

55
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,119
No sir, it still pains badly

56
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,990
Let's have Viva tomorrow.

57
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,051
Hmm...drink tea.

58
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,391
Thank you sir

59
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,203
I only asked you to drink tea,
why did you take vada?

60
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,499
Oh sorry, sir. I didn't know
you like vada so much.

61
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,374
Get lost from here.

62
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,210
Why the hell I offered you tea?

63
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,040
You will never ever pass this exam!

64
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,275
Shall I take this? Why wasting it?

65
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,443
Anyway I am not going to pass in the exam

66
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,084
Go and eat

67
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,087
Can't you tell me if you like this
vada so much?

68
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,353
Won't I give mine?

69
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,557
Where is your house, miss?

70
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,027
Vadakara!

71
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,563
- Really?
- H mm.

72
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,169
- What happened to Viva, dude?
- It's reduced to a vada!

73
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,262
Only this fool passed in our group!

74
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,207
- Then, you owe us a treat today!
- What?

75
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,504
Our parents send us here to study well

76
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,410
-and not to become wayward!
- Kill that bastard!

77
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,107
Don't thrash me. Ok, will give you treat.

78
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,980
Take the Car.

79
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,465
“There are no girls“

80
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,593
“What a time is this, dear“

81
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,037
“No girls, no girls, no girls“

82
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,072
“I searched till my eyes ached“

83
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,201
“To see a beautiful girl“

84
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,509
“No way, no way, no way“

85
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,674
“She need not be like moon“

86
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,685
“She need not be very beautiful“

87
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,680
“For namesake,
at least I must have one, O God“

88
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,191
"In every corner there are girls"

89
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,361
“But not one for me“

90
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,556
“This work is tough O my God“

91
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,591
“Chunkzz,
Chunkzz, Chunkzz, Chunkzz, Chunkzz“

92
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,467
“Chunkzz,

00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,697
“No way, no way, no way“

99

“Though there is no one to give company,“

100
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,749
“Chunkzz are always near me“

101
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,262
“Even if I get thrashes
or I burn with pain“

102

“Always Chunkzz who give

Mummy, tea.

114
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:08,583
Hello.

115
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,719
We are waiting outside, buddy come..

116
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,131
Come inside, guys. Have breakfast and go.

117
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:16,098
- Calls to take breakfast!
- Give that to me.

118
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,263
O my dear friend! No need

119
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,670
You want your mother to scold us?

120
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,468
Here everything is fine

121
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,306
There are Pancakes and Egg roast
for breakfast. Please come.

122
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,342
- Hot pancakes, friend.
- Really?

123
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,640
Riyas, pancakes and Egg roast!

124
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,382
Tell him we are coming.

125
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,474
Here we are, dude!

126
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,785
Hi dad! Both are gorging well.

127
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,784
Vagabonds reached at the right time!

128
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,185
Don't you get food from home?

129
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,729
Wow, 699!

130
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,791
Your craving for egg still not stopped,
you idiot?

131
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,064
Dad, egg is good to let off the gas!

132
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,637
Yes, my grandpa's gas also went
after the egg got stuck in his throat!

133
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,137
Well dad,
I want some money for studying Viva!

134
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,676
Study what?

135
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,802
For Viva!

136
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,112
Oh...Education cost is too high!

137
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,748
Last week you took
money for buying assembly

138
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,582
I bought timetable for that.

139
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,453
Every day you are...

140
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,749
How much money do you want now?

141
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,547
-1 O..1 O
- COS1:S RS.1 OOOO!

142
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,747
10000?!

143
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,550
To get the best Viva,
it will cost that much.

144
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,687
Yes uncle,
I also got it for that cost only.

145
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,492
You can afford, your father is an NRI

146
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,692
But I'm a poor real estate broker

147
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,195
Do one thing. Go for second hand one,
for Rs.3000!

148
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,669
Poor man! Then go for second hand only.

149
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,766
- Mummy..Pancakes are over..
- Mummy..

150
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,604
- What is it? - Get it quickly.
Got too much of work.

151
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,548
Goddamn work! Don't provoke my anger

152
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,185
If you come here in a form like yesterday,

153
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,250
then you my son, will never step
into this home, mind you.

154
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,082
No mummy, I told them not to take drinks

155
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,682
But they forced me...especially him.

156
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,658
Hey, you will get from me!

157
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:51,163
Oh! So you guys are spoiling my child!

158
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,765
Yes we admit that!
But who spoils his father, tell me mummy?

159
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,602
Why coming to me now?

160
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,174
You don't say anything.

161
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,709
Let them go, I will take you to task

162
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,238
Like father, like son.

163
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,343
When everyone can abstain from drinks
attending divine retreat,

164
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,743
Why can't your dad alone do it?

165
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:09,743
That is the problem.

166
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,478
Shut up and go!

167
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,121
You shut up and stuff the egg!

168
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,045
DEPARTMENT OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

169
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,253
Dude hurry up, it's miss Sonia's class!

170
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,096
Sit at the front..run..

171
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,397
- Good morning, miss.

172
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,062
Yes

173
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,565
Thank you, miss.

174
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,368
All are present!

175
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,772
Have we come to a wrong class?

176
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,707
No wonder Sonia's miss class is houseful!

177
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,747
- Come

Thank you.

179
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,242
Are you basking, you dog?

180
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,383
Get up, please. Sit at the back

181
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,748
But you guys are usually back benchers!

182
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,188
You go and sit.

183
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,720
Never let others to study

184
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,158
- You here?
- Sonia is my darling, Athma!

185
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,790
- Get away!
- Don't dare tell me.

186
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,086
Sit there if you wish to.

187
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,163
Present miss.

188
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,237
Here she comes!

189
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,201
O God!

190
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,441
Tender breeze keeps blowing!

191
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,221
Oh no!

192
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,046
- Can I sit at the corner?
- No

193
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,614
Hmm, all are present today

194
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,786
- Thank you very much! You can go.
- Ok sir.

195
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,495
Here comes the bloody Jose!

196
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,724

197
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,033
tricks to this Government Engineering
College passed out man

198
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,163
Excuse me, sir, why did Sonia miss leave?

199
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,641
Asking why? Not only you, I know
how to bring your dads also to my class.

200
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,576
Sit down.

201
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,205
It's fine even to prank with Sony miss

202
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,407
- Sir!
- Yes.

203
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,413
Can I take leave, sir?

204
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,414
You sit down there

205
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,551
No sir, I belong to CS

206
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,744
- Pardon!

207
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,579
Yes I know! Searching for a Chalk while
sitting in a chalk mountain..bloody fool!!

208
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,522
Sit down.

209
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,118
Bird watching in Mech despite
having pretty girls in CS!

210
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,489
- Stay there.
- You deserve it!

211
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,652
Hi students!

212
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:10,125
Today we are discussing about factors
influencing breaking effect!

213
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,501
Sure I'll break his neck today

214
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,338
What is cos(90° - ?)?

215
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,375
Eh!

216
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,511
Oh no!

217
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,205
Cos(90° - ?)?

218
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,712
Sin?_

219
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,343
<i>No ba ba ban.</i>

220
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:32,184
Without knowing basic fundamentals
how you reached up to final year?

221
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,723

222
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,560
Sit down. Let me see if I can teach you!

223
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,526
Don't know fundamentals?

You will get only cattle feed atlast!

230
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,177
Having studied this way,
nothing got into your heads I believe!

231
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,051
So, let's forget that method.

232
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,317
A for Anuradha..

233
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,057

00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,221
T for Tamanna!

Close your mouth

236
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:18,335
And C for Catherine Teresa

237
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,038
Interesting?

238
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,471
- Fantastic!
- Yeah Yes sir.

239
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,339
- Lovely?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,045
They were the trends of some phase of time

241
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,774
Stick onto this order

242
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,207
it will never ever
go away from your memory

243
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,347
Sir, one minute.

244
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,017
Yes

245
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,045
- One doubt
- Yes

246
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,147
Doubt?!

247
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,591
Can I change Silk to Shakeela?

248
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,355
I mean..if change to
Shakeela..in driving school..

249
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,361
Being a Mech student..

250
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,559
Will also be quite easy to study.

251
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,193
Thank God!
Atleast now you opened your mouth

252
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,666
Thanks! Sit down.

253
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,502
Change it whoever you like
- Silk, Shakeela

254
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,599
- Who else you said" ah, Sunny Leone!
- Really?

255
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,632
- Yes
- Thank you, sir.

256
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,075
- I'm offering you
- Thank you, sir.

257
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,478
Sir, Pappichan arrived

258
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,647
-inform that I will give a call.
- Ok sir.

259
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,249
Why do you wish to see me urgently?

260
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,484
Get in, I will tell you.

261
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,194
What is the problem?

262
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,028
What is the problem, buddy?

263
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,624
I'm really in a fix

264
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,759
Oh, is this the problem!

265
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,333
Since sometime, I was also wishing
to have drinks with you.

266
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,633
Good

267
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,205
I'm in a big tension, you know.

268
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,170
What happened?

269
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,647
If possible, we should not send our
children to Bangalore for studies

270
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,706
It's true, boss.

271
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,543
But whom do you have in Bangalore?

272
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,554
Came to know from this week's magazine
about the Bangalore enjoyment

273
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,119
Shut up, you rascal!

274
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:44,748
Come to the point.

275
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,753
I'm not able to sleep
also because of this tension,

276
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,221
am in that much pressure.

277
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,387
- I've bigger tension than you
- What?

278
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,058
I struck a land deal
and unable to make the payment

279
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,031
Your goddamn land dealings!!

280
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,366
When my life sucks here,
you talking about your land dealings?

281
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,428
Then, tell me what is your problem!

282
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,066
Who else will I say if not you.

283
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,305
Dude, you know my daughter Riya..

284
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,478
...has got an affair.

285
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,412
Do something and get that ready.

286
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,514
Simple! Show me the person,
I will get it done.

287
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,079
- Really?
- Yes

288
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,554
Her intimate friend

289
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,522
...College mate!

290
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,523
Came home insisting strongly to marry her!

291
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,390
Where is the person now?

292
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,762
I somehow convinced
and made him stay in my flat

293
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,065
- In our flat?
- Yes

294
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,330
Matter is too simple!
Needn't worry at all.

295
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,435
<i>Do one thing, give me 30 has</i>

296
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,767
<i>30 has'?</i>

297
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,668
Not as a loan, as my fees.

298
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,612
Shall sort this out
and clean this away, deal!

299
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,274
Won't you resolve it?

300
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,206
This Varkey has only one word ..

301
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,045
Deal or no deal?

302
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,583
OK

303
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,213
Now, next question

304
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,357
Have you heard (King)
RAJA drink milk, is it?

305
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,721
Which DOOT(Milk) does RAJ drink?

306
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,655
Don't know?

307
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,065
Rajdoofl!

308
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,524
Now comes next question..a
bit challenging one!

309
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,703
Which PAL(milk) PRINCE drinks?

310
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,639
Don't know?

311
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,074
O my Rasiya!
Move away your scarf and think!

312
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:14,073
Shall I say? It's PRINCIPAL!

313
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,241
She doesn't know anything..Dumbhead!

314
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,181
You have good sense of humour I guess!

315
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,284
Not such. Occasionally.

316
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,414
Got it out of learning or by inheritance?

317
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,785
Will you just shut up? Hangs
around with pretty girls with ugly looks!

318
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,291
Enough of stuffing! Get away, don't stare

319
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,425
I also don't wish to talk to a
nasty creep like you.

320
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,136
- Hey..
- Leave me, Rasiya

321
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:41,571
- You..
- Thank you.

322
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,735
- I will debit your account
- In Riyas account!

323
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,277
Here is Riyas lkka.

324
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,142
- You here?
- Yes dude

325
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,578
- We were looking out for you.
- Tell me.

326
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,149
Like last time, won't you
be the goal keeper this time also?

327
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,582
Don't worry, We'll excel!

328
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,285
These pals want me for everything!

329
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,490
Riyas lkka is your best
player in your team, is it?

330
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,049
He's not in our team.
Plays for the opposite team.

331
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,159
We are Mechanical!

332
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,524
It will be easy for
us if he is the goalkeeper

333
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,392
Can tease him after hitting goals.

334
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,531
Is it enough? I will be here, see you.

335
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,232
They lost the last match after I scored eight
goals alone that is why they are jealous.

336
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,440
Sinner!

337
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,298
- Riyas lkka!
- Yes, tell me.

338
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,741
Got cricket match this evening.
Won't you come?

339
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,340
Can't start the game without you.

340
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,413
Definitely I will come.

341
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,113
Else who will pick the balls
for us other than lkka!

342
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,621
Picks up the ball in a jiffy!
Excellent picker!!

343
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,085
You are really a Judas!

344
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,089
Don't get me? He is our ball picked!

345
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,494
Joking!

346
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,256
Might have hit 8 sixers in the
last match of his over,

347
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,126
that is why he is jealous, right?

348
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,192
I hit 6 sixers and your
dad hit the last 2 sixers!

349
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,561
Let's move, Rasiya, Come.

350
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,105
Needn't stay here for a minute also, come.

351
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,238
- Get off you!
- Get going home!

352
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,109
- Taken a Tarpaulin?
- What for?

353
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,578
Likely to rain!
We'll swim inside the car then

354
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,806
- Go by bus tomorrow.
- Stop..Stop

355
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,413
- What for?
- I need to recharge

356
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,311
- Come back soon
-ol<

357
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,320
- Shall cool it?
- It is too hot. Put A.C

358
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,181
Dude!

359
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,220
Isn't she the one who ditched you?

360
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,225
Isn't that a pharmacy?

361
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,697
- That blue dress!
- Yes, she is the one.

362
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,528
We must take her to task!

363
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,533
Of course!

364
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,237
Read that number

365
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,811
Looking gorgeous today
with green colour top!

366
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,640
Phone is ringing

367
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,547
- Hello
- Hello sis

368
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,116

Give me a paper and pen!

Paper and Pen! Here take.

10 Packets Whisper

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,661
And also 10 packets Pampers!

376
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,400
10 Packets Snuggy, ok

377
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,440
- Big order I guess.
- Noted?

378
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,478
- I did - If so, stuff that paper
into your mouth and swallow, you bitch!

379
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,046
Now nappy!

380
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,374
Who is that?

381
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,647
Wrong number!

382
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,379
Interesting!

383
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,023
Now my turn!

384
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,395
- Hello
- Hello

385
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,237
- KPK Medicals?
- Yes

386
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,075
Take a pen and paper

387
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,704
No pen and paper, you dog!

388
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,738
Then pull out the paper you stuffed
earlier into your mouth and write.

389
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,750
- Again wrong number!
- Hmm

390
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,150
Can make out from your looks!

391
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,148
- Come..Come
- Hey Varkey..wait.

392
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,454
- What are you going to do?
- Simple...!

393
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,827
- Oh no! It's not something you think!
- Listen to me.

394
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,158
You don't involve. Stay here.
I will handle the rest.

395
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,564
- Let nobody know about your coming.
- Varkey, please listen to me.

396
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,367
I will give you a whack! Stay quiet

397
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,397
Watch this Varkey's operation, ok.

398
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,444
Mr..

399
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,350
Who are you?

400
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,249
- Sorry, I've come to a wrong flat
- It's ok.

401
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,649
OK

402
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,057
I'd been to a wrong flat.

403
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,325
- This's the flat.
- This ?

404
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,365
Yes

405
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,628
- If so, then you are saved
- How?

406
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,227
He has brought another woman home!

407
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,701
- Not him, dude
- Then, you?

408
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,399
- Not me also.
- Then?

409
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,097
- You saw a girl now, isn't it?
- Yes

410
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,575
- That girl is the boy.
- What?

411
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,572
Boy who insisted to marry my daughter,

412
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,637
...is this girl

413
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,581
I will give you a tight slap,
tell me clearly, you swine!

414
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,242
This girl only insists
to marry my daughter!

415
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,516
Oh! So they are lebonese, ah!

416
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,423
- What?
- Lebonese!!

417
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,091
No..No..My daughter is not that sort!

418
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,090
I swear..believe me.

419
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,726
But this girl is of that sort,

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,469
that is the reason she
causes all these problems.

421
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,033
- Oh!
- Yes.

422
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,767
For the 1st time I'm
handling Lebonese case!

423
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,675
- I will operate it.
- Won't you?

424
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,369
- Definitely!
- Won't you deal this?

425
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,477
This Varkey has only one word!!

426
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,205
- Deal or
-..no deal!

427
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,076
Oh Jesus! Hope he doesn't kill that girl!

428
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:40,398
This evening at 7.30,
there is an Indigo flight to Bangalore

429
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,240
You must board in that, ok?

430
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,679
Get yourself boarded!

431
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,746
My dear lass! You are not aware
of this Varkeyachhan's true colour!

432
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,755
You must leave this evening!

433
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,547
You will, ok!

434
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,039
Come on, man..hmm..

435
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,762
Come on, smash her friend!

436
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,638
Smash kicking her abdomen

437
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,220
Excellent friend!

438
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,779
Awesome!

439
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,234
Deal?

440
00:27:59,211 --> 00:27:59,734
No deal!

441
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:00,668
Why?

442
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,615
Marry off your daughter to her!

443
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,980
What nonsense are you talking?

444
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,017
Good girl! Really good!

445
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,518
Won't lack in anything.

446
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,224
Will take good care of her.

447
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,393
- What the hell are you blabbering?
- Kick you bloody

448
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,389
That lebonese hit my
chest so hard and damaged

449
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,555
You only said.

450
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,563
I will surely pay you for this!

451
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,431
Turned up like a godman's case!

452
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,528
What did he do to her?
What is wrong with him?

453
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,534
Wait, buddy!

454
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,381
Mummy, here comes Sikandar
(character) of Punjabi House!

455
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,780
Get off you, rascal!

456
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,386
Don't provoke me say anything.

457
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,301
Oh my Goodness!

458
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,530
What happened?

459
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,033
What was the problem?

460
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,972
I involved in a boundary issue!

461
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,069
Must have simply got a hit on his head!

462
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,378
Hell with...!

463
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:15,576
Girls!

464
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,018
What happened daddy?

465
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,249
What were you girls doing inside? Tell me.

466
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,989
Doing combine study

467
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,085
Combine study!!

468
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,256
No combining and doing new studies!

469
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,633
If you are able to do only combine-study!

470
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,535
Call few boys . I don't mind.

471
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,140
- Boys?
- You get going home.

472
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,140
- What are you talking?
- Please get away

473
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,299
Combine study!! My foot!

474
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,000
Mummy, what is wrong with dad?

475
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,310
Your dad...! Damnit!

476
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,470
What has happened to him?

477
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,013
When got a hit on his head,
he probably gone mad I guess!

478
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,015
Possible!

479
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,781
Mummy, milk.

480
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,780
Getting, son.

481
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,714
Oh god! Why this lag, mummy?

482
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,690
Who told him he will turn fair
if he drinks milk?

483
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,625
- Get quickly
-ol<

484
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:57,585
Take.

485
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,257
No saffron?

486
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,459
No son, waste of money!

487
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,658
Of late our comedy is not that good

488
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,633
Keep in mind.

489
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,468
This is more than enough for you!!

490
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,206
That is pretty good! 2 points!

491
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,468
How is your college doing?

492
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,471
After putting me up in a hopeless college,
asking how is it doing?

493
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,306
Total failure!

494
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,174
Really? Pappichayan's daughter is also
joining that college only

495
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,507
Shall I ask him to stop?

496
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:22,583
Oh God!

497
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,750
Mummy, I was joking

498
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,087
It is really a superb college.

499
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:27,819
What?

500
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,191
Experienced teachers
for scoring good marks,

501
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,760
Job opportunities, ample playground

502
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,097
Enough! Don't make it a bit over.
Hell with his playground!

503
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,827
Not necessary, is it?

504
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,537
She is joining your college only.

505
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,697
Always keep an eye on her, ok.

506
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,539
Why only my eye, behind her,
there will be loads of eyes!!

507
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,803
- What?
- H mm

508
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,811
Fragrance in the breeze here!

509
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,442
What... A Stink.

510
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,183
Dear.. What is this?

511
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,215
- Unseen in the earth
- Oh it was that!

512
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,457
Father says our future is in our hands

513
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,720
But use it with care, ok..

514
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,328
Such a big one?

515
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,194
- Look at this pal!
- What is it , dude?

516
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,198
- This stone might have come out
while I was peeing!-Ugh!

517
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,129
It's a cockroach repellant you fool!

518
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:11,726
Is it?

519
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,737
So, it's confirmed
I have no kidney stones.

520
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,063
- What dude? Any obscene bits
- Get lost!

521
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,577
To keep watching full pieces
we are not your dad, scoundrel!

522
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:23,274
All my search on the
Facebook has been a failure.

523
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,706
She left for Dubai at a very young age.

524
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,245
Haven't met her since..

525
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,814
Now she must have grown into a chic!

526
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:34,081
No way! Good looking ones in childhood
lose all that when they grow up!

527
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,717
Shut up!

528
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,725
Let me see

529
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,764
<i>Look at Rome!
Neither handsome then nor is he now'.!</i>

530
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,157
Shut up, give back the photo

531
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,724
You guys are unaware of her background

532
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,169
Only if we have seen her,
can we say if she has a background or not.

533
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,605
Dude! She was born with a golden bum
in her mouth.

534
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,664
- Golden Bum?

Don't let anyone here know that
I'm older to you by 2 years, okay

Isn't it between us...

588
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,086
Are you not on facebook? I searched a lot

00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,726
There is a Mech group in Whaisapp

606
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,601

607

612
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,340

00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,074
Just like that.

616
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,377
This is Sherin.
We were together in Bangalore.

617
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,080
What brings you here?

618
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,320
I had some work here.
Moreover it's her first day here.

619
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,381

00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,106
Don't use that. He bought it for mere 50rs
at a church festival

628
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,540
Wear this new Rayban glasses of mine.

629
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,341

634
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,286
Pal, please carry this

635
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,458
Keep my bags in the hostel

636
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,719
Please carry it, dude

637
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,292
Thought of impressing her all alone,
is it? You do it yourself.

638
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,060
Let's move, pal

639
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,191
Get off you.

640
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,664
HEAVEN

641
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:55,357
Dude, stop!

642
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,498
What are you doing with Guitar?

643
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,036
One of the strings is bit loose

644
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,560
Must get that done.

645
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,433
Of late all your strings are
causing too much problems

646
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,464
No, only when seeing you.

647
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,032
That isn't quite good character, okay

648
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,036
May be to impress her!

649
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,509
I will set you right, dude

650
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,347
Riya is the pride of our department

651
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,286
Yes! You are right

652
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,187
Not yours!
You belong to a different department

653
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:20,501
You noticed one thing, Riya!

654
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:22,272
How matching are our names!

655
00:39:22,346 --> 00:39:24,110
If add a S to Riya..it's Riyas!

656
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:27,215
If cut of the Ri, then he is just an Ass!

657
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,080
Needn't have to sing a song

658
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:32,280
It will create more trouble
if Jose sir sees this

659
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,621
- Take it.
- Wow! Thank you.

660
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:41,293
See this!

661
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:42,491
His usual trick!

662
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,466
- Hey Atmaram..
- What is it?

663
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,295
- Hi
- Hi

664
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:47,766
Riyas, come here for a minute.

665
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,567
- Both of you.
- What for?

666
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:50,568
Come here.

667
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:52,166
Riya, just a minute, I will be back now.

668
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:53,775
Will be back now, guys

669
00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:55,470
What brings you here?

670
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,409
Both of us were giving Riya company

671
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,642
You giving company to Riya!!

672
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,114
We are here for that. Get away

673
00:40:02,352 --> 00:40:03,513
I already warned him.

674
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:05,453
Where are you going, sir? You stay here.

675
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:07,786
When you didn't have money to
contribute funds yesterday,

676
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:09,155
How could you afford to buy her a
diary milk today?

677
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:12,119
That money was given by my mother
for buying medicines.

678
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:13,560
So you bought her a chocolate
with that money, ah!

679
00:40:15,565 --> 00:40:18,364
A classic Malayalam
song especially for Riya!

680
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:19,869
When I chased one, another one comes!

681
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:21,834
I will surely kill all of you, watch!

682
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,644
Guitar strings are a bit loose!
Tuning also gone

683
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:29,736
If talk about tuning..

684
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,744
- You know to play?
- Yes, he also plays well.

685
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,614
- But not using Guitar.
- No, I beat drums excellently

686
00:40:35,752 --> 00:40:36,514
As if!

687
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:37,883
Riya, come with me,
I got to say something.

688
00:40:38,555 --> 00:40:41,286
- Do I?
- Hmm, come. Move your leg, dude

689
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,720
Now relieved!

690
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:45,825
Are you trying to impress her with this?

691
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,625
I will break this into pieces.

692
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:49,597
I will kill you, don't dare touch this.

693
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,701
Please don't come here without
wearing a overcoat!

694
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,602
All are very bad guys. That's why

695
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,832
Why does a Mech Queen need a overcoat?

696
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,142
Yes, you are right. Why an overcoat..

697
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:01,144
Why do you have tension now ?

698
00:41:02,412 --> 00:41:04,278
Coming, sweetheart!

699
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:06,111
Shall we begin?

700
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:09,313
I'll take you to task

701
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:15,348
"O Moon, do you have a small casket
of mandhara flowers, rubies“

702
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,326
Jolly miss is okay now

703
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:19,353
Jose Sir..

704
00:41:21,364 --> 00:41:22,763
- What's it?
- Too much of disturbance in class!

705
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,398
- I'm not able to study
- When did you start studying?

706
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,299
- I thought of starting from today
- As if!

707
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,337
How can I study?

708
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:31,270
Yudas is staging a musical concert
in the classroom with Guitar!

709
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,270
- In Classroom? Musical concert?
- Yes, Yes sir

710
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:34,606
You carry on, sir. I will be back now.

711
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:37,338
- Indisciplined fools!
- You have to suspend them

712
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:39,547
Only you will be able to control them.

713
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,516
Get inside, sir..

714
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:47,283
“When waves of ecstasy rise
in the heart, silence sings“

715
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,259
“a small casket
of mandhara flowers“

716
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:51,817
I'm sorry sir.

717
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:56,424
We won't repeat this. Sorry sir.

718
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:57,823
Sir, sorry sir.

719
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,773
“In the platter of vegetables,

720
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,279
one potato grandma said“

721
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:11,171
This dumbhead is awesome!

722
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:20,117
“Little one,
have food in the leaf bowl and swing“.

723
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,296
“In the platter of vegetables,
one potato grandma said“

724
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:33,727
“Little one,
have food in the leaf bowl and swing“.

725
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,465
...have food in the leaf bowl and swing..“

726
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:41,771
...have food in the
leaf bowl and swing..“

727
00:42:42,112 --> 00:42:46,515
- I will kill you today!
- Sorry sir..sorry

728
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:49,809
Okay enjoy, but discipline!

729
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:51,612
Carry on.

730
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:55,117
Mass...a deadly mass!

731
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:56,684
What have you done, sir?

732
00:42:57,294 --> 00:43:00,696
Rather than lying on the road sloshed out

733
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:03,562
Try to learn such performing arts!

734
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,234
Okay? All the best

735
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:07,630
Bullshit

736
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:11,774
Playing Cards is injurious to health! Should
be displayed in the beginning of the films

737
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:12,569
What is the need?

738
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:14,235
People are losing plenty
of money because of that.

739
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:15,540
Even smoking does not cause
so much loss of money

740
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:17,546
As if you had given money!

741
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:19,841
Get lost you.

742
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,344
- What is gnawing you?
- Stop it, man!

743
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:25,752
Go and wear your brassieres and come.

744
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:27,680
What sort of a guy he is?

745
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,128
I guess Boney have
a relationship with a girl

746
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,553
Asking if he could meet her tomorrow

747
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:34,491
Who is that girl?

748
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:36,530
I will surely come..

749
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:39,363
Tell the truth, to which girl
are you chatting over the phone?

750
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:42,167
I called my mom
not allowing me in at home, you idiots.

751
00:43:42,806 --> 00:43:44,137
What sort of guys you are?

752
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:45,134
So rFY

753
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,334
Always think this

754
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:48,811
- Pal, I'm leaving
- Where do you go?

755
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,607
I need to recharge my phone

756
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,442
Usual trick!
Escapes when asked for his share!

757
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:55,182
- Is it enough if I give my share!
- When will you give?

758
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:58,677
- Next month, okay?
- Get off you, beggar.

759
00:43:59,623 --> 00:44:01,182
Who took away the lighter?

760
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:03,355
- It's with me
- What is this?

761
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:04,187
Light a cigarette.

762
00:44:07,497 --> 00:44:08,726
I think numbers of
cards have been decreased

763
00:44:09,332 --> 00:44:10,697
- Sherin is calling.
- Sherin?

764
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,360
- Yes, Sherin
- Please give me the phone

765
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:13,596
- Give me please
- No, I will attend.

766
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,728
Sflence

767
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:18,141
- Hello Sherin
- Where are you?

768
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:20,107
- I'm in Heaven
- Heaven?

769
00:44:20,343 --> 00:44:21,777
I meant my hostel

770
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:23,774
Come quickly to the entrance
of the Ladies hostel

771
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:25,712
Ladies...What for?

772
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,350
Please da

773
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:28,513
What she said?

774
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:29,608
Calling me to ladies hostel

775
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,745
- Ladies hostel?
- I'm leaving

776
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:40,423
Sherin

777
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:42,694
Seeing her!

778
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:45,496
Not getting sleep at night!

779
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:47,365
I don't feel good without seeing her.

780
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:48,503
Me too!

781
00:44:48,538 --> 00:44:51,599
- But I will sleep peacefully tonight..
- How?

782
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:53,505
I saw you

783
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,678
Don't you remember me?
I'm Riyas from cherupalassery

784
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:57,711
What am I supposed to do for that?
- Stand aside

785
00:44:58,181 --> 00:44:58,807
What is your problem?

786
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,075
I want to see her.

787
00:45:01,518 --> 00:45:02,314
- So you want to see her?
- Yes

788
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,209
- This Yudas will take you.
- Take off your hand

789
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,654
What nonsense! Don't you know visitors
are not allowed during night hours

790
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:07,622
It's just a cheap show of his!

791
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:10,455
- Then Scale the wall!
- What? At night hours?

792
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:11,422
That is asking for trouble!

793
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,096
Isn't it enough to meet her tomorrow?

794
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:15,229
Who is this Amul baby?
Get away

795
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:16,527
One of our distant friend.
Don't mind him, Come.

796
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:17,691
Come let's go

797
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:21,101
- Stay here and eat grass
- Come pals!

798
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:23,702
Don't leave me alone.
It's a ladies hostel.

799
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,698
May frighten me!

800
00:45:24,774 --> 00:45:26,264
Come on, put your feet
on my shoulder and scale

801
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,438
Oh God! She weighs too heavy

802
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,308
- Hey, hold me.
- Was it you, dude?

803
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,139
You beggar!

804
00:45:34,718 --> 00:45:35,583
Bend down dude!

805
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:36,813
Climb sister

806
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:37,710
Hold me please

807
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,783
Sherin, step on with
your right feet and climb

808
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,787
You dog, leave me.

809
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:43,622
Riyas leave her

810
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:45,584
Why did you grab me?

811
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:46,796
You asked to hold

812
00:45:47,197 --> 00:45:49,188
If asked to hold, is it on the butt
you've your hands on, rascal?

813
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:50,858
That was the one I first saw,
what can I do?

814
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:57,336
Happy Birthday, dear.

815
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:02,272
No one should make noise. Go slowly

816
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,503
Why do you walk this way?
Bend down and move.

817
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,273
It is us who will get
into trouble, not you.

818
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,411
This is quite interesting!
Why don't we visit all the time?

819
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:08,679
Shut up you dog

820
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:10,686
Something there.

821
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,091
Sherin, you love to
scale down the wall, is it?

822
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:16,353
I'll show you dog

823
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:17,460
Shut up You rascal

824
00:46:17,794 --> 00:46:20,161
Trouble...Run away.

825
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:21,760
What are you girl shouting?

826
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:24,456
Sherin, who is this?

827
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:25,691
Is that Atma on the top?

828
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,297
Hey, what are you doing here?

829
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:30,362
Why are you guys here?

830
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,430
Any marriage function here?

831
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:32,665
Is this your recharge shop?

832
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:35,106
I often come here to recharge

833
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:37,408
- No hot scenes here, get away
- You could've called us also

834
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,380
Oh Sherin! Please don't mistake me.

835
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:40,746
I came to clear my doubt.

836
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:42,410
When did you come? Are you fine?

837
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,249
I want to see Riya. Where is she?

838
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,115
She is here. Climb up

839
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:48,519
Sister, you climb first.

840
00:46:49,692 --> 00:46:50,454
I will hold you.

841
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:51,585
Get away you

842
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:54,790
I hold you, climb

843
00:46:54,864 --> 00:46:56,764
These idiots are a big nuisance now

844
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,269
Look there

845
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:02,471
What is it?

846
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:06,074
Jolly miss and Sony miss are in great form

847
00:47:11,681 --> 00:47:13,581
Oh Lord , Look Rasiya there.

848
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,211
Anybody will fall upon seeing this.

849
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:18,778
Take the phone

850
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:20,614
Hey, If you capture, I will kill you

851
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:25,083
You filth, get away

852
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:29,591
- Hello
- Hello

853
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:31,757
- I'm in your hostel
- Where?

854
00:47:32,168 --> 00:47:35,103
I'm waiting in the sunshade of the
room where you and your friends are now.

855
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:35,829
Come immediately.

856
00:47:37,674 --> 00:47:38,698
Just a minute.

857
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:41,138
- Hi Riya
- Why you here?

858
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:42,474
I can't stay without seeing you.

859
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:45,144
- You came alone?
- Those guys are also there.

860
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:50,745
Is it over?

861
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,313
- Take that glass
- Shut up please

862
00:47:58,127 --> 00:47:59,788
Thief...Thief!!

863
00:47:59,863 --> 00:48:01,524
- Escape!
- Go go... Get away

864
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:03,289
Let me climb down first

865
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,799
- That is the real girl
- Wh0?

866
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:13,802
Sherin!

867
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:17,541
What a boldness!

868
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:22,179
- Must love such a kind of a girl!
- For what?

869
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,109
Can get rid of your friendship, is it?

870
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,821
She is a best match for him

871
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,114
Never bathes at all, isn't it?

872
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:29,282
Good morning boys

873
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,088
Hi my dear.

874
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,262
We boys are really pathetic!

875
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:35,095
What a celebration
in your hostel yesterday

876
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:36,529
Was it a Church fest!

877
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,531
You are not aware of girls!

878
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:40,636
- We always have a good bash!
- I knew it earlier

879
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:43,233
If dare come there..

880
00:48:45,074 --> 00:48:46,439
When did Sherin leave yesterday?

881
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:48,304
She left early morning itself

882
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,411
Why did you bring her to the hostel?

883
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:53,773
Actually it was not us. She took us there.

884
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:55,209
Would we do such a thing?

885
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:56,514
Come, I got something to tell you.

886
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:58,682
What's it?

887
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:01,517
Although she is my best friend,

888
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,457
Of late I feel there is some
change in her behavior.

889
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:07,157
No more friendship with her, ok?

890
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,391
OK

891
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:09,632
I take leave?

892
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,798
Pal, look there

893
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:19,435
Did you notice the girl at the centre

894
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:20,670
She keeps staring at me.

895
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,542
As if she got no other jobs
to do other than minding you!

896
00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:29,713
You watch, she will glance at me
while passing this way, bet?

897
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,752
Let's see

898
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:36,385
What a stink, Riyas?

899
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,550
Can't you go to the toilet?

900
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:39,728
You have to consult a doctor

901
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:43,166
Riyas! Give up eating potatoesH

902
00:49:43,232 --> 00:49:46,167
Go to the toilet and come.

903
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:50,262
If give a whack..

904
00:49:50,473 --> 00:49:51,599
What happened, Riyas lkka?

905
00:49:51,808 --> 00:49:54,175
Your father died, idiot

906
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:28,106
Wow! Very good.

907
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,140
What a tough question paper is this!

908
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:58,171
HEAVEN

909
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:40,844
Hello Riya, what happened

910
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,218
Why don't we go for a trip?

911
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:44,754
I'm terribly bored here

912
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:45,879
All are going home here

913
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:47,680
- Going for a trip?
- Yes

914
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,520
Why don't we go to Goa then?

915
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:51,617
Full of familiar people are there

916
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:54,287
- Fully on!
- But I hardly have any money

917
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,430
If parents come to know,
it will cause trouble

918
00:51:56,899 --> 00:52:00,335
Money? Don't worry, I will take

919
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:02,132
- Let's go-Call them also then

920
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:05,340
This won't work out if we call them

921
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:06,404
Why?

922
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:07,705
They don't have money with them.
Then the trip will be cancelled

923
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:09,802
Okay, what is your plan then?

924
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,811
Nothing will work as planned

925
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:13,173
Let's leave immediately

926
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:15,716
Ok. So we shall leave, is it?

927
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:17,483
Of course! Shall we leave?

928
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:18,815
Okay da

929
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:20,146
Okay.

930
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:22,816
Excellent!

931
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:24,558
Hey Dudes

932
00:52:27,663 --> 00:52:31,395
Riya and I are travelling to Goa

933
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:32,466
To Goa?

934
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:34,794
Pal! He is going to Goa along with her

935
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:36,832
- What
- Tell him we are also joining

936
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:39,641
- Dudes it is not the kind of trip
you are thinking about - What else?

937
00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:41,700
Both of us are going on a honeymoon

938
00:52:41,778 --> 00:52:43,712
What...Going on a Honeymoon..

939
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,715
So don't keep calling in between
and disturbing us, bloody fools!

940
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:48,709
What did he say?

941
00:52:49,152 --> 00:52:50,551
He is going on a honeymoon.

942
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:53,553
- Honey moon, is it? You needn't worry then
- Why?

943
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,259
Must have taken him as her driver,
else what?

944
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,186
To Goa as if!!! With him

945
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:00,159
they may be travelling local!

946
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:02,493
Exactly! He and Goal!

947
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:29,520
"O bird, my heart is stolen“

948
00:53:29,692 --> 00:53:33,094
“if my heart is stolen, O God“

949
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:43,672
"O bird, my time has come“

950
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:47,400
"if my time comes, O God"

951
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:50,842
“Is this a dream or real?“

952
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:54,549
"It is real, but is it a dream?"

953
00:53:54,717 --> 00:54:01,680
“Whoever hears this will not believe it“

954
00:54:01,757 --> 00:54:05,193
"Oh Goa“

955
00:54:05,261 --> 00:54:08,663
"Oh Goa“

956
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:12,190
"Oh Goa“

957
00:54:12,268 --> 00:54:15,568
"Oh Goa“

958
00:54:15,638 --> 00:54:19,472
"O bird, my heart is stolen“

959
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:23,206
"if my heart is stolen, O God"

960
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,624
“When we laugh, play, take bath and
stand drenched“

961
00:55:10,793 --> 00:55:14,286
“Life Jingalala, life jingalala“

962
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,661
“The time when we rub our wings
with desire and throbbing heart“

963
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:21,201
“Life jingalala, life jingalala“

964
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:35,843
“We flew high like colourful kites,
as we wished“

965
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:39,518
"Oh Goa“

966
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:42,556
"Oh Goa“

967
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:46,092
"Oh Goa“

968
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:50,228
"Oh Goa“

969
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,698
"Oh Goa“

970
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,834
"Oh Goa“

971
00:55:57,206 --> 00:56:00,335
"Oh Goa“

972
00:56:00,676 --> 00:56:04,704
"Oh Goa“

973
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:10,809
Would Premaettan have slept!

974
00:56:12,254 --> 00:56:13,187
Eh.. so you know him?

975
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:14,414
Know him!

976
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,489
Just watch!

977
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:18,288
- I will set the room and be back
- Okay!

978
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:19,192
Stay here.

979
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:31,231
Slept off?

980
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:36,741
Brother Prem..Brother Prem.. Brother Prem

981
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:39,673
I swear, I was not me who peeped this time

982
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:42,616
O my Premettan! It's me Remo!

983
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:45,211
Oh it is you! Why so late?

984
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:47,320
Got late! ls the room set?

985
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,618
Yes! I've set an excellent
honey moon suite especially for you

986
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:50,625
Fantastic!

987
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,786
A bit costly! For a couple of days Ok!

988
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:53,560
Cost doesn't matter in such moments

989
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,427
Get the room keys ready,
I will be back now.

990
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,564
- Shall bring her and come.
-ol<

991
00:56:56,632 --> 00:56:57,793
Hand over the room key

992
00:56:58,234 --> 00:56:59,429
- Who is this?
- Aunt's son!

993
00:56:59,568 --> 00:57:01,195
Aunt sent him over to build himself up.

994
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,260
So it will take some time..

995
00:57:03,439 --> 00:57:05,567
Riya! Come on man

996
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,541
Keys..

997
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,550
Keys please

998
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,109
See you, good night.

999
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:19,221
Stay here. You go, dear

1000
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:21,256
We have an unhindered relationship

1001
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:23,214
I can show you the room

1002
00:57:23,492 --> 00:57:24,755
You go dear. Just walk straight

1003
00:57:25,127 --> 00:57:26,390
Don't shut the door, I will come soon.

1004
00:57:26,562 --> 00:57:29,122
Last time when you came nothing worked

1005
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:31,599
so you have come in with all set up,
naughty boy!

1006
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,465
She is my girl friend.

1007
00:57:34,136 --> 00:57:35,763
We understand everything

1008
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:37,129
Still how did you managed to get her?

1009
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,604
Haven't I told you brother
Prem it is not in the looks...

1010
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:41,370
Eh.. It is in the work!

1011
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:42,605
Yeah. Teach him that!

1012
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:45,305
It's late night. Let me sleep.

1013
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:47,415
- Work well then.
- Ok!

1014
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:48,314
Thank you.

1015
00:57:49,351 --> 00:57:50,443
Spoilt others sleep!

1016
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:52,419
Hmm..His fortune!

1017
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:53,478
That even I have?

1018
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,221
Must be bathing!

1019
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:05,457
Let her bathe

1020
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,628
What if I peep?

1021
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:11,273
Na..

1022
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,435
That will make me a typical Malayalee

1023
00:58:13,576 --> 00:58:17,740
What if some money is spent..
the mood has been created!

1024
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,749
Eh.. Leis look

1025
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,584
No gaps...

1026
00:58:36,732 --> 00:58:38,757
Here there is..

1027
00:58:40,202 --> 00:58:41,727
At least if I could see something

1028
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:48,134
Hi.-I "was doing sit ups
- Yes..Yes

1029
00:58:48,277 --> 00:58:49,403
Sit upsl!

1030
00:58:49,578 --> 00:58:52,843
Sitting in the car for long time
has caused a severe back pain.

1031
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,148
Having back pain at this young age,
that means your condition is bad

1032
00:58:56,485 --> 00:59:01,252
True...Oh no. When I did pushups
and sit ups, it is completely cured

1033
00:59:01,524 --> 00:59:03,253
Nice room, isn't it? You liked it?

1034
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,721
Easy boy..

1035
00:59:07,363 --> 00:59:08,421
"Easy-

1036
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:10,726
Oh god! What attire is this, girl!

1037
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,091
Needlessly tempting one to lose control!

1038
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:14,427
Did you lose your control?

1039
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:17,805
As if.. I will not
lose my control so easily.

1040
00:59:19,575 --> 00:59:20,667
Really

1041
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,703
Then that needs to be tested.

1042
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:41,362
“This is an intoxication pervaded by
fresh arrows of flowers“

1043
00:59:44,433 --> 00:59:48,301
“A special butterfly in the river of lust“

1044
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:57,746
“Slowly, come dressed up and fuddle me“

1045
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,545
“You enjoy the honeymoon“

1046
01:00:01,617 --> 01:00:05,815
“This is an intoxication pervaded by
fresh arrows of flowers“

1047
01:00:08,524 --> 01:00:14,156
“A special butterfly in the river of lust“

1048
01:00:15,564 --> 01:00:21,628
“Slowly, come dressed up and fuddle me“

1049
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:26,669
“You enjoy the honeymoon“

1050
01:00:30,779 --> 01:00:32,338
It is not to lie with you that I like..

1051
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:34,610
But sleep hugging you tight that I love to

1052
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:35,707
Get off..

1053
01:00:35,784 --> 01:00:36,808
Duluqar talks like this only

1054
01:00:37,186 --> 01:00:38,278
Get lost you.

1055
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:44,821
As per motor vehicle act,
mistake lies on my part

1056
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:46,153
Ouch!

1057
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:49,156
- You lie down my dear.
- It was needless!

1058
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:50,523
Where is this guy gone?

1059
01:00:52,601 --> 01:00:53,466
Flip it.

1060
01:00:53,535 --> 01:00:56,664
You were asked to serve Masala Dosa
to that Englishman

1061
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:59,140
And you are happily stuffing
in Omelette here! You swine!

1062
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:00,367
The egg had broken !

1063
01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:02,308
I know that Omelette can't be made
without breaking an egg.

1064
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:05,541
Why are you getting on me?
Only if he roasts, can I serve

1065
01:01:05,614 --> 01:01:06,775
Couldn't you have roasted a Dosa?

1066
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:07,782
I am just a supplier?

1067
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,477
- My foot! Supplier!
- Where is the Dosa?

1068
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:10,642
Pan needs to get hot.. Look here.

1069
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:12,380
- If I give a knock on your head..
- What?

1070
01:01:12,588 --> 01:01:13,555
Pan isn't hot yet it seems!

1071
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:14,789
What is there to eat now?

1072
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:15,850
Appam and..

1073
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,555
- Then?
- Onion curry is there.

1074
01:01:17,726 --> 01:01:21,128
Stuff some onion curry inside Appam and
serve it as Masala Dosa to the Englishman.

1075
01:01:21,196 --> 01:01:22,391
What Cheating?!

1076
01:01:22,464 --> 01:01:24,762
English man wouldn't understand.
Go and serve

1077
01:01:25,768 --> 01:01:26,758
Oh Shit..Pan is hot.

1078
01:01:26,835 --> 01:01:29,634
Is it? But you said Pan is not hot.

1079
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:31,363
Almost getting heated up.

1080
01:01:49,124 --> 01:01:50,592
Bloody rascals!

1081
01:01:56,265 --> 01:01:57,426
Oh that rascal!

1082
01:02:02,738 --> 01:02:05,571
- Hello
- Hello pal..hello dude...

1083
01:02:05,641 --> 01:02:07,166
- What is it dude?
- What was it like last night?

1084
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,541
Did anything take place?

1085
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:10,806
Took place!?

1086
01:02:11,347 --> 01:02:12,610
Will put it on the speaker

1087
01:02:13,082 --> 01:02:13,640
What is he saying?

1088
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:15,775
Dudes, it was like medicine..
like medicine

1089
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,218
Have you developed sugar?

1090
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,651
Like medicine?

1091
01:02:18,854 --> 01:02:21,551
One three times a day

1092
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:23,818
My my! I am having a roaring time here.

1093
01:02:24,093 --> 01:02:25,561
Don't have to lie

1094
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:28,860
You dog! Glamour isn't sufficient.

1095
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:31,460
To entice girls, you need skills. Got it?

1096
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:33,331
Did you hear?

1097
01:02:33,502 --> 01:02:36,233
Do one thing.
Send us her photo from your phone.

1098
01:02:36,405 --> 01:02:37,236
We'll believe you then

1099
01:02:37,306 --> 01:02:39,240
I will send the photo

1100
01:02:40,409 --> 01:02:41,877
Not your ugly photo, ok!

1101
01:02:42,244 --> 01:02:44,178
Send us the photo of
you being together, got it?

1102
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,238
Did you hear? I will surely send it.

1103
01:02:48,117 --> 01:02:51,747
If that will satiate your desire,
so be it!

1104
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:54,553
These guys won't know anything.

1105
01:02:54,623 --> 01:02:56,216
I will show it now. Don't wake up

1106
01:03:27,856 --> 01:03:29,722
To make it a little more realistic,
I have an idea

1107
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:32,355
I will show you pals!

1108
01:03:37,866 --> 01:03:38,799
You!!

1109
01:03:40,302 --> 01:03:41,497
Hello, madam, good morning.

1110
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:43,229
What are you doing with my brassiere?

1111
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:44,236
Brassiere!!

1112
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,240
Oh! Is this a brassiere?

1113
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:49,243
No..Panties! Put that back and get lost

1114
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:51,243
Fill it up with sponge and shout at me..

1115
01:03:51,814 --> 01:03:52,781
I don't need this

1116
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:55,651
Oh god! In fact I was looking
for a medicine for my head ache

1117
01:03:55,717 --> 01:03:57,742
Poor guy! Looks tired.

1118
01:03:57,886 --> 01:03:59,149
All seemed to be out of focus.

1119
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,245
Take off your glasses and see

1120
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:01,412
Too many photos!

1121
01:04:03,158 --> 01:04:04,523
We must rather hang ourselves to death!

1122
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,422
True!

1123
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:07,751
Such a louse has got a pretty girl!

1124
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:09,753
That too like Sunny Wayne!

1125
01:04:09,832 --> 01:04:11,095
Not Sunny Wayne, its Sunny Leone!

1126
01:04:11,366 --> 01:04:12,527
No matter whether its Wayne or Leone!

1127
01:04:12,701 --> 01:04:13,600
He is lucky!

1128
01:04:13,869 --> 01:04:14,893
Okay da, I will come now.

1129
01:04:15,204 --> 01:04:17,263
You changed so quick!

1130
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:19,271
What is the programme for the day?
Shall we have a bash?

1131
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,273
No pal, I need to go out..

1132
01:04:22,311 --> 01:04:24,643
Hey.. Out .. Wait ...Just a minute.

1133
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,815
Hey stop!

1134
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,175
Where are you going alone?

1135
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:30,719
To meet my friend.

1136
01:04:31,353 --> 01:04:32,184
Friend?

1137
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:35,487
Hello...which friend?

1138
01:04:35,557 --> 01:04:36,490
Or shall I also come along?

1139
01:04:36,558 --> 01:04:38,720
Needn't! It's been long since I saw him

1140
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:40,626
Got some personal matters to talk.

1141
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:41,458
See you then.

1142
01:04:42,231 --> 01:04:45,166
Hey.. Riya .. How long has it been!

1143
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,467
Dude! This is Arjun

1144
01:04:48,237 --> 01:04:49,727
We were together in Bangalore

1145
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:51,432
<i>and this is Rome'.!</i>

1146
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:53,166
- Hi!
"Ugh!

1147
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:54,636
Is he the Romo you mentioned about?

1148
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:56,176
Phew!

1149
01:04:58,347 --> 01:05:02,477
To tell you the truth..when you suggested
Goa, meeting him was what had me join you

1150
01:05:02,784 --> 01:05:04,149
- Let's go
- Sure

1151
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:07,450
So we will take leave.
You sit happily boozing! Okay

1152
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:27,141
Let it fry well

1153
01:05:37,486 --> 01:05:38,282
it is like that for me too,

1154
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:40,447
whenever some pain comes in,
the next thing is to hit the bottle.

1155
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:45,324
Anyways seeing your state I recall
the title of the skit I enacted in school

1156
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:46,427
Which skit was that?

1157
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,520
No luck girl, roll up the mat!

1158
01:05:48,597 --> 01:05:49,587
Nice title!

1159
01:05:50,232 --> 01:05:50,824
Fill one more!

1160
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:55,663
What was it last night!
Erotic song dance etc

1161
01:05:55,837 --> 01:05:58,499
And at the Climax, in the pole position,

1162
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:00,574
She kicked him to the floor from the cot.

1163
01:06:00,642 --> 01:06:02,440
You.. So you were peeping into my room?

1164
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:04,476
Is it termed peeping in your land?

1165
01:06:04,613 --> 01:06:06,445
What a cheapness!

1166
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:11,116
Just because he peeped in,
he is able to join in your pain.

1167
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:13,245
Exactly! Advise him like that.

1168
01:06:13,322 --> 01:06:14,687
Don't burn your guts like this!

1169
01:06:14,756 --> 01:06:15,484
What kind of binge is this!

1170
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:19,456
These two were like the small dark lamp
kept beside the big shiny lamp

1171
01:06:20,062 --> 01:06:21,223
That is not how it is to be said

1172
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,123
it is Ghee rice and meat!

1173
01:06:23,198 --> 01:06:24,290
Yes, meat would be correct

1174
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:25,458
Hmm. That is the correct

1175
01:06:25,534 --> 01:06:27,468
Hey that was a joke! Laugh man?

1176
01:06:27,736 --> 01:06:29,170
Laugh my DOV!

1177
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:34,474
To tell about him...Needlessly
pining for a girl..

1178
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:04,226
So sitting alone and admiring Sunset!

1179
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:05,795
Cute!

1180
01:08:07,035 --> 01:08:08,400
Dude.. I am asking you.

1181
01:08:09,771 --> 01:08:10,397
What happened to you, dear?

1182
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:12,138
Why do you want to know all that?

1183
01:08:12,374 --> 01:08:13,398
Because we came together

1184
01:08:13,642 --> 01:08:16,043
Is that why you walked out with another
guy this morning?

1185
01:08:16,344 --> 01:08:17,573
Isn't he my friend?

1186
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:21,340
Listen if I had come with you and walked
out with a girl, how would you feel?

1187
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:23,617
For that matter
which girl would come with you?

1188
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,747
True. Who will hang around with me?

1189
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:29,151
I am not handsome, isn't it?

1190
01:08:32,394 --> 01:08:34,260
Who said you are not handsome?

1191
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:35,454
I know.

1192
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:36,461
How do you know?

1193
01:08:36,631 --> 01:08:37,462
Get lost!

1194
01:08:43,772 --> 01:08:44,637
Now has your anger disappeared!

1195
01:08:46,141 --> 01:08:47,631
Pal, truly he is my friend.

1196
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:51,738
May be if you give me one more,
it could go fully

1197
01:08:51,813 --> 01:08:53,281
Try your luck, flirt!

1198
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:34,479
"Oh Goa“

1199
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,316
"Oh Goa“

1200
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:41,827
"Oh Goa“

1201
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:45,293
"Oh Goa“

1202
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,800
"Oh Goa“

1203
01:09:49,271 --> 01:09:52,468
"Oh Goa“

1204
01:09:52,774 --> 01:09:56,233
"Oh Goa“

1205
01:09:56,311 --> 01:09:59,804
"Oh Goa“

1206
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,182
Excuse me, this card is not working

1207
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:05,150
Swipe it again, man

1208
01:10:07,322 --> 01:10:09,484
Last morning, didn't we go to Anjuna..

1209
01:10:09,658 --> 01:10:11,148
I think this card is blocked.

1210
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:15,824
Can you get me a bottle of water please?

1211
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:17,255
- Sure
- Oh thank you.

1212
01:10:17,866 --> 01:10:20,563
I'm afraid card is blocked.
Got any money on you?

1213
01:10:20,635 --> 01:10:23,229
What? I have no money, I already told you.

1214
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:24,295
What shall we do now?

1215
01:10:24,706 --> 01:10:25,730
For a change, shall we run away?

1216
01:10:26,107 --> 01:10:27,666
Can we try the sizzlers?
And get ourselves bashed up

1217
01:10:27,742 --> 01:10:29,642
What else.. how do we eat the noodles?

1218
01:10:29,845 --> 01:10:31,313
You do something. I will walk out easily.

1219
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:34,313
O boss! Why talking like this?

1220
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:36,515
Let me call Premettan!

1221
01:10:37,853 --> 01:10:39,844
Fantastic! His phone is not reachable.

1222
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:44,222
Do one thing. Go and get money
from Premettan and come.

1223
01:10:45,227 --> 01:10:48,219
Just because I am gone doesn't mean
you buy this shop

1224
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:51,123
Here is the phone.

1225
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:58,839
Have it man! Enjoy life happily like this!

1226
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:01,606
Of course!

1227
01:11:03,144 --> 01:11:04,771
Appear to be generous malayalees!

1228
01:11:05,647 --> 01:11:07,137
"Eni0y!
"Bro!

1229
01:11:08,516 --> 01:11:09,847
<i>+m
+m.</i>

1230
01:11:10,385 --> 01:11:12,080
Who is that beggar?
Do you know him?

1231
01:11:12,187 --> 01:11:13,780
Yesterday itself how much
money did you throw on that girl!

1232
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,345
- Hi
+m

1233
01:11:15,657 --> 01:11:16,647
- Good morning
- Good morning

1234
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:18,215
Could you do a small favour?

1235
01:11:18,393 --> 01:11:19,861
- Give him a bottle of beer
- No..Not that help

1236
01:11:20,195 --> 01:11:21,856
- Then?
- My ATM card isn't working.

1237
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:23,289
Oh! So what do we do?

1238
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:25,493
It is not that...l came
along with my girl friend.

1239
01:11:26,301 --> 01:11:28,736
Would it be possible
to pay this restaurant's bill?

1240
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,395
I will return you immediately
when I go to my room.

1241
01:11:30,472 --> 01:11:33,169
- Otherwise I need to leave her alone here.
- What a pity!

1242
01:11:33,275 --> 01:11:35,107
Having good bash with girl friend,
you naughty!

1243
01:11:35,176 --> 01:11:38,146
Yes, I did but now feel bored

1244
01:11:38,613 --> 01:11:40,206
Please settle the bill, bro.

1245
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:43,443
- Doesn't he carry a shady look?
- May be there..

1246
01:11:43,518 --> 01:11:44,644
- Yes, you do!
- Certainly!

1247
01:11:45,353 --> 01:11:47,481
Let's do one thing. We shall meet
his girl friend first

1248
01:11:47,555 --> 01:11:50,217
Then let's decide whether to swipe
the ATM Card or not

1249
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:51,348
What do you say?

1250
01:11:51,626 --> 01:11:53,151
Doesn't matter. Let's meet her.

1251
01:11:53,194 --> 01:11:55,322
I swear, She is waiting at the top

1252
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,726
Let's take a look!

1253
01:11:58,233 --> 01:11:59,496
You guys wait here! Will inform if found

1254
01:12:01,636 --> 01:12:03,627
She is truly your girl friend, is it?

1255
01:12:04,339 --> 01:12:05,272
Girl friend means, we are not engaged.

1256
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:06,634
Just hanging around!

1257
01:12:07,842 --> 01:12:09,537
Dude, is she like you?

1258
01:12:09,678 --> 01:12:11,339
Yes! She is fun!

1259
01:12:11,613 --> 01:12:12,603
Come.

1260
01:12:54,612 --> 01:12:59,174
As I oil my little son, sing this...

1261
01:12:59,316 --> 01:13:01,614
- Hey Boss, is your driver in?
- Yes sir

1262
01:13:01,786 --> 01:13:03,345
- Boss is in full tension
- Okay boss

1263
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,752
Come to cheat him..

1264
01:13:05,823 --> 01:13:08,087
- Hey Paapi...
- I am here..

1265
01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:10,286
Ah You are there...

1266
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:12,292
Pretty early to start
drinking your breakfast...

1267
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,488
I have not drunk my breakfast..

1268
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:19,064
Why is it you wanted to see me!

1269
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:21,332
Completely problematic..

1270
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:23,371
Ah.. Tell me the matter...

1271
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:27,208
This place called Goa...
Isn't it full of problems?

1272
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:28,502
Isn't it the best place!

1273
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:31,678
Where in two pieces
you can see chics around..

1274
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:33,510
Why not go? I am free for two days..

1275
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:34,775
Over.. All is over..

1276
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:37,514
What is over..Thousands are there without
a stitch on them..

1277
01:13:37,688 --> 01:13:38,587
Leis go..

1278
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:43,186
The whole of last week do you know
where my daughter, Riya, was?

1279
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,259
Is that to be asked to me, bull head..
Call her in and find out

1280
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:48,321
The whole of last week she has been
roaming around in Goa..

1281
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:49,693
- In Goa...?
- Yeah..

1282
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:52,461
To get off everything I had her shift
here from Bangalore..

1283
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:54,332
Now, from here she has gone to Goa..

1284
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:56,163
Did she go with the other
one...“Lebanese“ (Lesbi...)

1285
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:00,508
<i>Hey“ ha ha ha... This time she
has gone with some other son of...</i>

1286
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:04,648
- Wow...You are a fortunate guy..
- Why so..

1287
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,113
Now you needn't worry..
Hasn't she gone with a guy?

1288
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,183
Get her married off..

1289
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:11,353
The guy has a fraud look, says Freddie..

1290
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:12,755
Ooohh..

1291
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,814
Do you have any details about the guy?

1292
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:17,661
Details should be with Freddie..

1293
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,660
Freddie.. Son..

1294
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,298
- Yes...
- Come here

1295
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:25,131
Since he spotted the
two in Goa we got to know it..

1296
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:25,700
What is it Dad?

1297
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:26,828
Show the other photograph..

1298
01:14:27,104 --> 01:14:28,196
The one you took in Goa..

1299
01:14:28,272 --> 01:14:30,206
Looks like someone dipped in Varnish"

1300
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:32,365
By the way.. why did you go to Goa..

1301
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,440
I went in for a business meet.

1302
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:35,374
In Goa..

1303
01:14:35,446 --> 01:14:36,675
No... in Mumbai..

1304
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:40,815
Yes don't we go via Goa to Mumbai..

1305
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,554
Paapi...have a close eye on your son

1306
01:14:44,421 --> 01:14:45,354
Is he from CBI?

1307
01:14:45,422 --> 01:14:47,220
Here it is..

1308
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,389
Hasn't he got a look of a fraud?

1309
01:14:53,297 --> 01:14:54,162
Ah...He...

1310
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,162
Do you know him, Uncle?

1311
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,459
- Of course..
- Who is he?.

1312
01:14:57,802 --> 01:15:00,794
He is related to me as a son..

1313
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:01,629
Doesn't seem so..

1314
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:04,241
- Your son..
- Yes..He is my son, Romario...

1315
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:06,436
Oh no.. if I had known he was your son,
I would not have bashed him up..

1316
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,638
Doesn't matter..He really
had it coming... Good job..

1317
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:06,435
Yes.. Dude. Whats up..

1318
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:13,307
Had that ATM card not got blocked..
could have hit the streets in Goa..

1319
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:17,314
Yes for sure...There has been no
other trip in my life I enjoyed the most..

1320
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,381
Really..

1321
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,151
I had something to tell you..

1322
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,244
What is it, Dude?

1323
01:16:24,822 --> 01:16:26,187
Whatever it be.. say it..

1324
01:16:27,358 --> 01:16:30,419
Wouldn't you be coming to the college
for submission of assignment?

1325
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:31,655
Yes..

1326
01:16:32,396 --> 01:16:35,331
- If so, I shall tell it tomorrow..
- Ok... My Sweetie..

1327
01:16:58,422 --> 01:17:04,794
In such critical moments, as a friend,
I believe, it is my duty to support you..

1328
01:17:06,263 --> 01:17:11,167
The marriage between my son Romario and
your daughter Riya is acceptable to me..

1329
01:17:13,037 --> 01:17:14,198
Aren't you happy?

1330
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,308
Isn't a casual word..This is friendship..

1331
01:17:20,544 --> 01:17:21,636
Hey dear..Your grandfather
has hit a jackpot..

1332
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:23,737
I can't even think of
that guy as a brother-in-law..

1333
01:17:23,814 --> 01:17:25,805
If this disaster happens, I will hang myself
and write the name of this bearded guy..

1334
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,654
What is this conversation you are having?

1335
01:17:31,388 --> 01:17:35,188
Haven't you seen my daughter?
That white, chubby, bright girl...

1336
01:17:35,259 --> 01:17:37,626
Getting married to the dark,
burnt, boy of yours.. how would it be..

1337
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,493
Tomorrow when they have a child..
how would that look like?

1338
01:17:39,563 --> 01:17:42,658
Haven't they grown
a liking for each other?

1339
01:17:42,733 --> 01:17:44,497
Who said the liking is there? Did she?

1340
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:46,625
If not would they travel to Goa together?

1341
01:17:46,837 --> 01:17:48,532
If so, leis find out from her..

1342
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,369
Dear.. Riya..

1343
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:56,310
- Yes..What is it Dad?
- Come here..

1344
01:17:56,613 --> 01:17:58,775
I wanted to ask you something

1345
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:01,777
What is the relationship
between you and his son?

1346
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:03,313
He is my best friend.

1347
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:04,780
Is that all..

1348
01:18:05,589 --> 01:18:06,420
That is it..

1349
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,487
You can go dear.. go dear..

1350
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,384
But then...

1351
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:13,123
So you heard...He is her best friend..
That is all...

1352
01:18:13,163 --> 01:18:14,028
Chapter closed..

1353
01:18:14,098 --> 01:18:16,692
- What about this deal...
- No deal...

1354
01:18:17,134 --> 01:18:18,033
<i>Got it'?</i>

1355
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:19,133
Varkey leave...

1356
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:25,074
- Then...she wanted to have
a water scooty ride.. -Is it..

1357
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:26,267
Yes..

1358
01:18:26,443 --> 01:18:32,815
Then I jumped on to the water scooty...
like you see in Hindi movies"

1359
01:18:33,183 --> 01:18:34,412
Caught her like this ..Oh my friend

1360
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:37,815
Hello...helloo..

1361
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:40,350
Don't let too much lies

1362
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,687
Today you are getting it..

1363
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,820
When a girl called him has gone as her
body guard to Goa..

1364
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:46,820
Are you intending to make me insolvent?

1365
01:18:47,297 --> 01:18:48,230
Sorry Dad..

1366
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:50,527
I am in complete love with her..

1367
01:18:50,801 --> 01:18:52,394
Dad you must bless me..

1368
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:54,003
What is use of you liking her..

1369
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:56,005
She said it's just friendship
between two of you...

1370
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:58,104
- She said that...
- No.. no...

1371
01:18:58,175 --> 01:18:59,700
Take a look at these pictures in the phone

1372
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,039
Very sexy one

1373
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,436
This idiot spoilt everything

1374
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,775
Let his dad know his prowess..

1375
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,144
Son's nude pictures
being enjoyed by father..

1376
01:19:08,318 --> 01:19:10,150
That is the India
this Atmaram dreamt of ..

1377
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:18,323
After all this if she still sees
you as a friend then you are a failure..

1378
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:19,690
Correct..

1379
01:19:20,731 --> 01:19:21,789
Take and eat it

1380
01:19:24,168 --> 01:19:24,657
Leave it..

1381
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:27,170
Don't worry..We will
buy some dates and badam

1382
01:19:27,237 --> 01:19:28,568
Buy some cashew nuts too..

1383
01:19:29,106 --> 01:19:30,471
Dumbhead...!

1384
01:19:31,608 --> 01:19:33,633
A father's anguish..

1385
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:36,502
Do you have the money to buy cashew nuts"

1386
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,547
Get lost you dog..

1387
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:45,519
Is the hair OK?

1388
01:19:45,589 --> 01:19:46,818
Don't get tensed..

1389
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:49,822
- Have this..Have some..
- Might have reduced the tension, right?

1390
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,763
Pal.. Why hasn't she come?

1391
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,222
Its been some time...

1392
01:19:55,766 --> 01:19:58,292
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?
Ain't I the one proposing?

1393
01:19:58,535 --> 01:20:00,629
Pal..if it doesn't set for you then
I could look at it for myself.

1394
01:20:00,704 --> 01:20:03,139
What.. ls looking for
second hands your job?

1395
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:05,241
I want to let you know one thing..

1396
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:07,770
You all must start looking
at her as your sister..

1397
01:20:08,212 --> 01:20:10,544
Hell... for that let her acknowledge
first that she loves you..

1398
01:20:10,614 --> 01:20:12,742
Then we will decide whether she should
be a mother or sister"

1399
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:16,008
You can make her as your daughter..
The Ages match..

1400
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:19,520
You beggar...It is me
who actually meets her age..

1401
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:24,022
Whatever it be..
she went on a trip with you..

1402
01:20:24,228 --> 01:20:25,696
- It will get set...
- Will it?

1403
01:20:25,762 --> 01:20:27,423
For that matter,
if she didn't like you, then?

1404
01:20:27,498 --> 01:20:30,433
Then just consider the dosage
of the medicine he gave was less.

1405
01:20:31,068 --> 01:20:35,665
Hey dear son Judas I get clearly why you
are siding with him..

1406
01:20:36,073 --> 01:20:36,539
Why..

1407
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:40,339
If his is set up then in that gap you can
have a set up with Sherin, isn't it?

1408
01:20:40,511 --> 01:20:42,741
For that this Atmaram must die..

1409
01:20:42,813 --> 01:20:44,804
There... she is coming..

1410
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:52,455
All leave...Leave.. Leave...

1411
01:20:53,257 --> 01:20:55,157
Hey buddy.. come...

1412
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:57,617
I have to see live she
expressing her love to him...

1413
01:20:57,694 --> 01:20:59,992
We will show you the first night in live.
Come along..

1414
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,589
Atmaram, I told you
not to tease me like this

1415
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,292
All the best..

1416
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:12,700
Hi..

1417
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:29,617
Good morning , Bro..

1418
01:21:30,227 --> 01:21:31,126
Morning..

1419
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,663
What was it you said wanted to be told?

1420
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,759
Are Dad and Mom fine?

1421
01:21:40,037 --> 01:21:41,027
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

1422
01:21:41,572 --> 01:21:45,372
What.. What about your
elder sister and kids?

1423
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,705
It is been quiet a long
time since I met them..

1424
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,438
Stop beating about the bush..
be straight..

1425
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:51,575
That trip has caused a lot of turmoil..

1426
01:21:51,815 --> 01:21:53,749
What happened? Anything at home about it?

1427
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:55,676
- Not at all...
- Then?

1428
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:59,145
- I am unable to sleep at night..
- Eh?

1429
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:02,555
Without you around,
I just cannot sleep at night..

1430
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,184
What are you considering?

1431
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,757
Want to marry you , Riya.

1432
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:10,291
Come on, dude..

1433
01:22:10,601 --> 01:22:12,035
Are you mad?

1434
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:13,761
No, I am serious..

1435
01:22:14,738 --> 01:22:16,433
Riya, you are someone I love a lot..

1436
01:22:16,607 --> 01:22:18,541
Dude, that will not work..

1437
01:22:19,576 --> 01:22:22,511
See I am older to you by 2 years..

1438
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,011
Don't we know the cases of
Sachin Tendulkar and Abhishek Bachan?

1439
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,110
See.. take a look..

1440
01:22:28,352 --> 01:22:30,218
Look at the colours..
Do you see any match?

1441
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:32,487
Tell me.. Any match?

1442
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,683
Do not let this damage
our existing friendship.

1443
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,721
Please..Did you get that..

1444
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:55,567
Hey Dude..what happened..

1445
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:57,810
Shit .. wasn't necessary"

1446
01:22:58,282 --> 01:22:59,511
- What happened?
- Tell us the matter..

1447
01:23:02,753 --> 01:23:04,448
I thought she loved me..

1448
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:07,350
But ain't I dark?

1449
01:23:09,226 --> 01:23:13,424
If I had been fairer may
be things could have worked out.

1450
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,632
Dude.. do not bother..

1451
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,691
I had known this earlier
that it will not set for him..

1452
01:23:19,236 --> 01:23:20,362
So haven't I got scope?

1453
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:23,539
Oh.. playing one up on
one of ours broken heart..Swine..

1454
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,832
Hell with your scope!

1455
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:26,403
You be at peace..

1456
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:29,077
Sorry dude..

1457
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:31,706
I never considered
him to be that serious..

1458
01:23:32,115 --> 01:23:35,517
- Come here.. -Your overacting
sometimes becomes unbearable..

1459
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:37,446
Use a bit of common sense"

1460
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:41,521
Do you think only these kinds of people
like Dulquer Salman need to love...

1461
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:43,218
Don't guys like us also
need to fall in love...

1462
01:23:43,427 --> 01:23:46,863
Come on.. Leis for a bash"

1463
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:19,723
O girl, my sweetheart,
You are the moon in my heart

1464
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:24,100
Aren't you the pupil shining in my eye

1465
01:24:25,068 --> 01:24:29,198
O girl, my sweetheart,
You are the moon in my heart

1466
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:34,066
Aren't you the pupil shining in my eye

1467
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:38,680
lam not like Dulquer,

1468
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:43,116
lam not like Nivin,

1469
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,582
I am not Fahadh in handsomeness

1470
01:24:47,858 --> 01:24:52,591
Even then am I not in your heart?

1471
01:24:52,863 --> 01:24:57,460
O girl, my sweetheart,
You are the moon in my heart Sweet

1472
01:24:57,534 --> 01:25:02,062
Aren't you the pupil shining in my eye

1473
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:06,369
O girl, my sweetheart,
you are the moon in my heart

1474
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:11,537
Aren't you the pupil shining in my eye

1475
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,838
words in your red lips

1476
01:25:42,112 --> 01:25:44,308
Your eyes like sky

1477
01:25:44,481 --> 01:25:49,146
Aren't you my lover forever?

1478
01:25:49,219 --> 01:25:51,347
Your laughter is sweet milk

1479
01:25:51,555 --> 01:25:53,489
You are the girl I first saw

1480
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:57,058
Am I not there with you always

1481
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:02,430
O beauty, O flower

1482
01:26:02,566 --> 01:26:07,128
You are my soul in this world

1483
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:12,204
lam not like Dulquer,

1484
01:26:12,275 --> 01:26:16,735
lam not like Nivin,

1485
01:26:16,813 --> 01:26:20,772
I am not Fahadh in handsomeness

1486
01:26:21,284 --> 01:26:27,053
Even then am I not in your heart?

1487
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:31,318
We can't wait longer, Varkeyacha..

1488
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:34,796
Before the contract ends, arrange the
money to complete on the registration"

1489
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,500
The contract had already
expired 4 months back..

1490
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:38,725
Can't wait any more, Varkeyacha...

1491
01:26:39,202 --> 01:26:40,601
What we had to say, we have told..

1492
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:42,529
An avoidable deal we landed into..

1493
01:26:42,606 --> 01:26:46,133
This extension of 1month was got after
a lot of cajoling..

1494
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,842
Speak to them and find out if an extension
of 2-3 months could be obtained

1495
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,445
I don't think further
extension would be possible.

1496
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,412
Consider the advance given is gone..

1497
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:56,145
Varkeyacha, do whatever you feel like..
I have told you all.

1498
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:06,555
Oh God.. it is Pappi..

1499
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:10,022
Hey Varkey..

1500
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:15,163
What kind of person are you..

1501
01:27:15,238 --> 01:27:16,637
You never turned up after that..

1502
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:19,571
I was working on arranging the money and
then come over to meet you...

1503
01:27:19,743 --> 01:27:21,074
Are you talking about
the money that you owe me?

1504
01:27:21,144 --> 01:27:22,236
- Yes..
- Let that be there..

1505
01:27:22,312 --> 01:27:23,541
I came now to talk about something else..

1506
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,240
Come.. Leis move in..

1507
01:27:25,815 --> 01:27:27,180
What could it be?

1508
01:27:29,152 --> 01:27:31,587
Dude.. is the thing available?

1509
01:27:32,155 --> 01:27:33,281
Dear..

1510
01:27:33,523 --> 01:27:36,618
Oh Last night I had the
remaining and finished it..

1511
01:27:36,693 --> 01:27:39,162
- What kind of Christian are you?
- Tell me what brought you here.

1512
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:40,754
I came to talk about my daughter..

1513
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:42,298
Please" do not talk about that..

1514
01:27:42,365 --> 01:27:44,459
I got involved once and the pain
hasn't left fully yet..

1515
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:45,763
- Anything other than that, lets talk..
- It is not that..

1516
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,704
Came to tell you about getting my daughter
married to your son..

1517
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:52,641
Best.. That is best..100% best...
That is a great decision..

1518
01:27:52,709 --> 01:27:54,074
Not because he is my son..

1519
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:56,704
I have never seen a best
person like him in my life..

1520
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,611
Really..

1521
01:27:58,014 --> 01:28:01,473
He can have one drink more than
I can and still stand erect...

1522
01:28:01,685 --> 01:28:02,277
That is the kind of person he is..

1523
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,452
Awesome decision"

1524
01:28:04,621 --> 01:28:06,680
Mary,, get that Scotch bottle..

1525
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:10,089
Wow.. You are the original Christian

1526
01:28:11,294 --> 01:28:13,456
- That I when had half..
- Understood..

1527
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:14,461
By the way there is another thing..

1528
01:28:14,598 --> 01:28:16,293
This marriage cannot be dragged for long..

1529
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:18,661
Needs to be done immediately and
has to be done next Sunday...

1530
01:28:19,202 --> 01:28:21,102
What are you saying.. Next Sunday.?

1531
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:21,634
How can that be possible?

1532
01:28:21,705 --> 01:28:22,763
Aren't there several aspects
on which decisions need to be taken?

1533
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:24,200
What is there between us to think about?

1534
01:28:24,474 --> 01:28:26,670
Aren't there business related issues?

1535
01:28:26,743 --> 01:28:28,438
All that can be dealt
with even after the wedding..

1536
01:28:28,645 --> 01:28:30,511
Marriage has to be conducted next Sunday.

1537
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,139
Why are you in such a hurry?

1538
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:36,186
Come here... shaa hava pega..

1539
01:28:36,386 --> 01:28:37,319
What that say"

1540
01:28:37,387 --> 01:28:39,321
- Hey she is pregnant!
- Pregnant!!

1541
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:40,115
Ya!!

1542
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:43,322
While roaming together
who thought they will end up doing this..

1543
01:28:44,327 --> 01:28:47,194
Oh Oh" HO HO.-.

1544
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:48,488
So that is the reason..

1545
01:28:48,765 --> 01:28:52,133
- That.. That will not be OK..
- Why so!

1546
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:54,269
As I am thinking,
I do not see it work out..

1547
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:55,666
- Why dude..
- Nothing.. but

1548
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,437
- The other day you said...that was correct..
- What did I say?

1549
01:28:57,574 --> 01:29:00,100
My son is black..

1550
01:29:00,276 --> 01:29:01,573
And your daughter is white..

1551
01:29:01,778 --> 01:29:03,439
Between them the colours do not

1552
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:07,047
Sh... what is there in colour..

1553
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:09,049
Isn't it all about the closeness and
love between them that is critical..

1554
01:29:09,252 --> 01:29:11,653
Without our knowledge she
has become pregnant.. look at that..

1555
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:15,122
- Oh Gods.. There is another problem..
- What is that..

1556
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,620
As you came in did you
see three people leaving?

1557
01:29:17,794 --> 01:29:18,625
Yes..l did . I did..

1558
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:20,791
Holy shit.. I gave my word..

1559
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:23,761
- What word have you given?
- Oh No.. Oh No..

1560
01:29:24,134 --> 01:29:25,431
- I spoilt it
- Tell me the matter..

1561
01:29:26,536 --> 01:29:28,231
Lis Elizabeth Fernandez..

1562
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:28,793
Who

1563
01:29:29,205 --> 01:29:31,640
Lis Elizabeth Fernandez..She
is a millionaire's daughter..

1564
01:29:32,175 --> 01:29:35,076
A marriage alliance with this guy..
She is adamant about my son..

1565
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,374
And I was in need of some money..
Unfortunately I gave my word..

1566
01:29:38,548 --> 01:29:39,572
What do I do?

1567
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,481
The mistake I committed is that
I have taken an advance too..

1568
01:29:41,618 --> 01:29:43,484
Dude return the advance to them..

1569
01:29:44,387 --> 01:29:49,621
My money... is lying at different places ..
In the bank, advance given for land etc..

1570
01:29:49,693 --> 01:29:51,092
- These decisions at such times...
- So what...

1571
01:29:51,294 --> 01:29:52,455
I will give you the amount,
that needs to be returned..

1572
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:55,394
Wouldn't it be a bother for you?

1573
01:29:55,999 --> 01:29:58,434
What are you saying?
Aren't all our earnings for our children?

1574
01:29:58,601 --> 01:29:59,762
That is true. For our children.

1575
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,264
I will give it to you. Tell me the
amount taken as advance..

1576
01:30:02,338 --> 01:30:07,276
The amount...is.. eh.. eh.. taken is..

1577
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:12,346
- Rupees One... Crore..
- One Crore Rupees!

1578
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:14,273
Oh! That is all..

1579
01:30:14,484 --> 01:30:15,451
I will give it to you right away..

1580
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,245
For the time being that is enough

1581
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,549
Later I can ask you step by step.
It is there with you..

1582
01:30:20,724 --> 01:30:23,591
All that is later..
Now return the advance to them..

1583
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,057
I am giving you a cheque

Did Brother Pappi leave?

1590
01:30:45,348 --> 01:30:49,307
For the first time in my life
your son has been of use to me..

1591
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:53,122
- Have you gone mad..
-Insane is your father..

1592
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:58,259
Pappi was here to confirm his daughter's
marriage with our son..

1593
01:30:58,461 --> 01:31:01,726
- Really?
- See this..advance..

01:31:02,132 --> 01:31:06,399
Who are you now? Wife of a millionaire!

1595

Hey what is this game

01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:15,240
You are my son.. my very dear son..

01:31:16,746 --> 01:31:18,236
Dad did you hit a jackpot?

- Why? Then you scold them..
- Not for scolding.. there is a surprise"

1603
01:31:32,629 --> 01:31:35,189
Surprise?

1604
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,094
Boney, you fool catch the ball.

1605
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:43,230
You are not playing in a stadium"

You are really smart".

1618

- Really fast.. Drink.. Drink..-Thank you..

1619
01:32:22,045 --> 01:32:24,207
BY the way..
my people need to be called first..

1620
01:32:24,514 --> 01:32:28,451
All that we will do..
Before that we need to book the hall..

1621
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:29,780
We got just a week's time..

1622
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:32,053
- One week!!

1623
01:32:32,288 --> 01:32:34,382
- Why is it like that..

01:32:35,225 --> 01:32:36,249
Next Sunday it is..

1625
01:32:36,626 --> 01:32:38,754
Any delay will cause problems..Won't it?

1626
01:32:39,028 --> 01:32:40,189
Come on Dad..

1627
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,659
What would be the problem?
Lets hear that..

1628
01:32:43,466 --> 01:32:45,298
She is pregnant..

1629
01:32:46,569 --> 01:32:48,469
Kids of today, what do we say"

1630
01:32:49,505 --> 01:32:50,768
What ..

1631
01:32:53,343 --> 01:32:54,367
What. .Pregnant..

1632
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:58,244
Mom.. Mom..
That..l swear I don't know anything

1633
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,108
Dad.. Dad.. I have not even touched her..

1634
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,479
Really you haven't touched her..

1635
01:33:01,684 --> 01:33:05,587
What is all that hugging and cuddling stories
that I heard you sharing with friends"

1636
01:33:06,222 --> 01:33:06,814
Is it so son"?

1637
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,324
Mom.. Dad..
I just said that to impress Dad..

1638
01:33:09,392 --> 01:33:12,259
- I just tried to impress you, dad
- If I give you one..

1639
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:13,625
Is this the way to impress your Dad?

1640
01:33:14,097 --> 01:33:16,794
I do not know anything..
I am not the one who impregnated her

1641
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:19,632
- If it is not his...
- What if it is not his..

1642
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:24,300
It is a girl's life..
My Pappi's daughter's life..

1643
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,508
Have you kept that cheque ?

1644
01:33:26,576 --> 01:33:28,101
I swear I didn't do that dad

1645
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:29,740
Even if you have not done anything..
That pregnancy is yours..

1646
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,079
You are marrying her..

1647
01:33:31,347 --> 01:33:33,145
Thus your that work has been saved"

1648
01:33:33,783 --> 01:33:34,682
All the best..

1649
01:33:35,084 --> 01:33:36,210
Belief that is everything..

1650
01:33:36,352 --> 01:33:37,342
Mom.. Tell something..

1651
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:50,597
- Hello...
- Helloo..

1652
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:52,294
Hey your dad had come over..

1653
01:33:52,368 --> 01:33:54,063
He had come to fix our marriage..

1654
01:33:54,137 --> 01:33:55,468
<i>Now aren't you happy'?</i>

1655
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,235
Let us wait for the marriage...

1656
01:33:59,309 --> 01:34:01,403
first tell me who is
responsible for your pregnancy..

1657
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:03,102
Who else, but you..

1658
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,669
Stop playing--

1659
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:07,641
Did you forget all that we did in Goa..

1660
01:34:07,717 --> 01:34:11,051
You walked out with some beggars and
how could you put that on me..

1661
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,086
Do that with anyone else, not me.

1662
01:34:13,156 --> 01:34:14,453
I would have walked out with any beggar..

1663
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,424
But the responsibility
for this pregnancy is on you..

1664
01:34:16,492 --> 01:34:18,620
You will go to jail for harassment.

1665
01:34:18,795 --> 01:34:20,820
Who me...

1666
01:34:25,168 --> 01:34:26,499
Harassment..

1667
01:34:32,608 --> 01:34:34,372
Mummy, here we're!

1668
01:34:34,444 --> 01:34:36,139
Shut up and get out all of you!

1669
01:34:36,612 --> 01:34:37,602
What happened, mummy?

1670
01:34:38,147 --> 01:34:41,242
Rascals spoiling my son! Get out!

1671
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:44,853
If anyone dare step in,
I will break their knees, mind it

1672
01:34:45,121 --> 01:34:46,316
She is quite angry now

1673
01:34:46,789 --> 01:34:48,086
Wait guys! I'm also coming.

1674
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:50,649
Didn't I already say it was some hoodwink
when she asked us to buy a bottle!

1675
01:34:50,827 --> 01:34:52,192
- Just a minute, dude!
- Come back quickly

1676
01:34:52,462 --> 01:34:53,361
Your father got to be appreciated!

1677
01:34:53,429 --> 01:34:54,123
Aunt)!

1678
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:56,393
- What?
- Can I ask you something?

1679
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,200
The cost of the bottle..was
contributed by me.

1680
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:00,392
Get out, you dog!

1681
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:02,561
Thousand and one bars closed!

1682
01:35:09,278 --> 01:35:12,111
Please trust my words, guys!
Nothing actually has happened.

1683
01:35:12,181 --> 01:35:13,580
However, you are a real Tiger!

1684
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,582
I've never even touched
my girl friend, you know?

1685
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:17,117
That's your incompetency!

1686
01:35:17,186 --> 01:35:18,051
Tea..Tea..

1687
01:35:18,221 --> 01:35:20,485
- Did I ask you to bring tea?
- No.

1688
01:35:20,556 --> 01:35:21,421
Go and get the touching!

1689
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:22,752
Go and get the touching.

1690
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:24,551
Fed up of him!

1691
01:35:24,627 --> 01:35:26,117
What all you boasted! Like a medicinel!

1692
01:35:26,162 --> 01:35:27,254
What else he said.

1693
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:30,493
Water bike,
bull shit..etc..what all you bragged

1694
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:33,158
To show off before you guys, I bragged

1695
01:35:33,236 --> 01:35:34,704
Truly nothing happened.

1696
01:35:35,071 --> 01:35:37,233
- Really?
- No.

1697
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:39,504
Now I'm relieved

1698
01:35:39,709 --> 01:35:40,505
- Stop it bloody.
- Needlessly got tensed.

1699
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:43,509
When I'm going insane here..
that is when his irritating language!

1700
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:47,516
After spoiling our darling Riya,
are you creating a scene here?

1701
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:50,075
We won't trust your words. It is yours!

1702
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,349
Stop it. Even otherwise
after 2 pegs you lose control.

1703
01:35:52,522 --> 01:35:54,650
In case if it had happened
without your knowledge..

1704
01:35:54,724 --> 01:35:55,350
That is for sure.

1705
01:35:55,391 --> 01:35:57,155
May be under the influence of alcohol..

1706
01:35:57,427 --> 01:35:59,156
- My dear Dasappa..
- Yes friend.

1707
01:35:59,228 --> 01:36:00,457
Get lost you dogs!

1708
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:01,793
- Take
- Cheers

1709
01:36:02,065 --> 01:36:03,794
- One glass for me too
- Take it and gulp

1710
01:36:04,033 --> 01:36:05,398
Happy!

1711
01:36:05,568 --> 01:36:06,729
Too dry!

1712
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,506
- Tea
- Why the hell bringing tea now?

1713
01:36:12,742 --> 01:36:13,732
Take it and go

1714
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:17,041
- Tea..for relieving tension
- I will drink, you go.

1715
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:18,479
Give me also then

1716
01:36:18,548 --> 01:36:19,674
No tea for you

1717
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:21,215
Get lost

1718
01:36:21,284 --> 01:36:25,050
If give her a tight slap,
won't she speak the truth?

1719
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:26,611
Only pregnancy case is on you now.

1720
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:28,384
If you do that,
harassment case will also be added to it.

1721
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:29,548
Cool down, Romo.

1722
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:31,624
What all you bragged!

1723
01:36:31,694 --> 01:36:33,628
Don't flog a dead horse!

1724
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,558
You beggar!

1725
01:36:39,302 --> 01:36:40,633
Come here rascal!

1726
01:36:42,572 --> 01:36:45,837
- O my hair!!
- Sherin, stop..

1727
01:36:47,243 --> 01:36:49,371
- Get away you dog.
- Dear..

1728
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:50,205
Leave him.

1729
01:36:50,546 --> 01:36:51,672
Get away rascal!

1730
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,316
Don't keep watching! Pull her away

1731
01:36:53,382 --> 01:36:56,181
- Listen to this Yudas
- Got it? Move.

1732
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:57,515
You bloody!

1733
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:01,123
- Madhavan Kutty!
- Madhavan Kutty?!

1734
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,453
Had she raised her voice a little,

1735
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:05,628
or cried a little,
he would've come back to his senses!

1736
01:37:06,262 --> 01:37:07,661
- True!
- If I give one kick".

1737
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,589
You didn't find any other girl, is it?

1738
01:37:09,665 --> 01:37:12,032
Shut up you bloody! I'm not
responsible for this pregnancy!

1739
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,362
Trust my words, please.

1740
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:15,368
Is this any mega serial?

1741
01:37:15,505 --> 01:37:16,529
Are you speaking the truth?

1742
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,669
Please..l swear.

1743
01:37:19,075 --> 01:37:20,338
Then it must be the
tricks of those rascals!

1744
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:21,470
Whose?

1745
01:37:21,511 --> 01:37:22,808
Pappi's and your dad's!

1746
01:37:23,179 --> 01:37:24,203
Call her and say you wanted to meet her.

1747
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,509
She is not attending my calls.

1748
01:37:26,649 --> 01:37:28,174
Oh Does she smoke also?

1749
01:37:34,524 --> 01:37:36,185
- Hello
- Hello

1750
01:37:36,259 --> 01:37:38,057
- Where are you?
- At home.

1751
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,695
Come out, I wish to see you.

1752
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:41,223
Nobody is at home here.

1753
01:37:41,564 --> 01:37:43,396
Then stay there. I will come

1754
01:37:43,799 --> 01:37:44,561
Okay.

1755
01:37:44,634 --> 01:37:47,399

Give it to him.

1801
01:39:30,706 --> 01:39:31,798
Doesn't matter! Keep the balance.

1802
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:32,807
Let's go dude

1803
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:34,772
Four of you don't fight!

1804
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:37,802
Why have you worn crumpled shirt?

1805
01:39:38,314 --> 01:39:40,339
If give to her,

1806
01:39:40,449 --> 01:39:42,042
An excellent lroner!!(LITERAL
MEANING DITCH) am I right?

01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,512
See you dear

1808
01:39:43,786 --> 01:39:45,185
Do you know him?

1809
01:39:46,055 --> 01:39:50,253
Her bloody pregnancy! I will not leave
the place until it is resolved.

1810
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:51,087
Get down.

1811
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:55,026
“Use condoms for your protection“ is stuck
in all the hospitals.

1812
01:39:55,164 --> 01:39:56,427
Would he have got into
trouble if he had read it?

1813
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,030
Pant became a bit tight!

1814
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,499
Got to get the final word ..

1815
01:40:00,102 --> 01:40:01,433
Move away

1816
01:40:03,606 --> 01:40:04,698
is what I heard true?

1817
01:40:05,107 --> 01:40:06,438
That I'm pregnant?
- That's true

1818
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:07,542
Who is responsible for it?

1819
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:08,702
Who else could it be other than you?

1820
01:40:09,278 --> 01:40:10,109
Then, it is true!

1821
01:40:10,179 --> 01:40:11,613
Where are you going? Stand here.

1822
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:15,279
I'm not any Al Qaida to take
responsibility of any pregnancy!

1823
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:16,441
Al Qaida?

1824
01:40:16,519 --> 01:40:17,452
How is that related to this?

1825
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,282
You shut up!

1826
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:20,617
Get some urine of yours.
I have got a Pregnancy tester.

1827
01:40:21,023 --> 01:40:21,489
That's not necessary

1828
01:40:21,624 --> 01:40:24,286
See..she dissents!
That means it is not my pregnancy!

1829
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,624
You fool! It'll not show the name of
the person responsible for the pregnancy!

1830
01:40:26,796 --> 01:40:28,594
If she is pregnant,
two pink lines will be visible!

1831
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,130
- I will not believe!
- Why?

1832
01:40:30,299 --> 01:40:32,165
- Because colour of the Urine is
Yellow, is it? -He is right.

1833
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:33,793
Go and bring your urine.

1834
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,571
Yes, get it. Something would have got
Missed while you tested.

1835
01:40:36,772 --> 01:40:38,137
Yes, it could be that.

1836
01:40:38,274 --> 01:40:39,639
Then, let's test it soon.

1837
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:42,567
You! Where the hell are you going?

1838
01:40:42,778 --> 01:40:43,472
To collect the urine

1839
01:40:43,546 --> 01:40:44,775
She will bring, you stay here.

1840
01:40:45,314 --> 01:40:45,576
Needn't, is it?

1841
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:48,148
- You have good knowledge in this!
- Give you a whack!

1842
01:40:48,351 --> 01:40:49,477
Let her get

1843
01:41:18,047 --> 01:41:19,310

1846
01:41:35,364 --> 01:41:37,458
Take off your hands!

1847
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:56,251
Dude! You won a cash award
of Rs.6000 from Government

1848
01:41:57,052 --> 01:41:58,076
Now you believe?

1849
01:41:59,255 --> 01:42:00,245
Bloody cheat!

1850
01:42:00,556 --> 01:42:03,423
It happened in a weak moment!

1851
01:42:04,093 --> 01:42:05,424
I lost my control

1852
01:42:05,694 --> 01:42:06,354
You...!!

1853
01:42:06,429 --> 01:42:07,726
Ain't I there, Sherin?

1854
01:42:08,197 --> 01:42:12,361
Had she raised a voice a little or cried
aloud, you would've come back to senses!

1855
01:42:12,535 --> 01:42:14,094
At last entire blame is upon men!

1856
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:17,401
My dear friend!
I neither did nor know anything.

1857
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:19,668
Riya was the apple of my eye!

1858
01:42:19,742 --> 01:42:21,540
If you cheat her
anymore..You rascal I'll..

1859
01:42:21,777 --> 01:42:24,439
- O my Sherin
- O my Papa is coming. All of you go.

1860
01:42:24,613 --> 01:42:25,444
Come dude!

1861
01:42:25,748 --> 01:42:27,113
Dude, when is your treat?

1862
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:28,309
Get lost!

1863
01:42:28,584 --> 01:42:29,176
You!!

1864
01:42:29,418 --> 01:42:30,783
No need! You needn't owe me treat!

1865
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,787
There will be stuff in her dad's room,
I'll get it and come that way.

1866
01:42:34,123 --> 01:42:34,521
Take 2 or3 bottles!

1867
01:42:34,657 --> 01:42:36,648
For her pregnancy, where else other than
her house will I pick the bottles from?

1868
01:42:37,126 --> 01:42:37,786
Needn't trust me!

1869
01:42:38,127 --> 01:42:40,289
When I prove my innocence,
you guys will surely cry! Watch!

1870
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:41,755
O my black brother-in-law is here!

01:42:42,565 --> 01:42:43,293
Your in laws!

1872
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:48,230
- Why has he come here?
- Who knows?

1873
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:50,136
What will people say
if walks in prior marriage?

1874
01:42:50,473 --> 01:42:51,304
What more to say?

1875
01:42:53,476 --> 01:42:54,443
When did you reach?

1876
01:42:54,643 --> 01:42:55,701
A Little while ago.

1877
01:42:56,245 --> 01:42:56,768
Whose bike is this?

1878
01:42:57,146 --> 01:42:58,113
That is Sherin's

1879
01:42:59,181 --> 01:43:00,080
- Whose?
- Sherin's!

1880
01:43:00,249 --> 01:43:01,307
Riya's friend.

1881
01:43:01,584 --> 01:43:02,244
Has Sherin come home?

1882
01:43:02,318 --> 01:43:03,149
Yes, she is inside.

1883
01:43:03,419 --> 01:43:04,716
Oh my God!

1884
01:43:05,154 --> 01:43:06,144
I'm also there, Papa

1885
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:09,780
Sherin, aren't you going with them?

1886
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:11,193
I will be leaving only after marriage.

1887
01:43:11,494 --> 01:43:12,655
We still got many days for marriage.

1888
01:43:12,828 --> 01:43:14,159
Let her stay here, Papa!
It's a marriage occasion, isn't it?

1889
01:43:14,497 --> 01:43:16,158
Now she will go and then come for marriage

1890
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,326
No Papa, don't we need a person
to help us in shopping here?

1891
01:43:18,501 --> 01:43:19,332
You guys are here for that, is it?

1892
01:43:19,502 --> 01:43:21,766
Is she like us? Taste and everything
will be different from us!

1893
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:23,138
Come dear!

1894
01:43:23,839 --> 01:43:25,830
Come with me..

1895
01:43:26,175 --> 01:43:27,665
From where the hell you found this bitch?

1896
01:43:28,611 --> 01:43:29,669
- Can you give me a ride...
- What?

1897
01:43:29,712 --> 01:43:30,440
I mean your bike.

1898
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:31,640
Papa, look, he is going after Sherin

1899
01:43:31,847 --> 01:43:33,315
Don't you know his character?

1900
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,482
Don't have any tension about him

1901
01:43:35,784 --> 01:43:37,149
Just take care of yourself

1902
01:43:37,486 --> 01:43:38,146

1905
01:43:56,305 --> 01:43:57,739
Suppose I say I got another link

1906
01:43:58,140 --> 01:43:59,630
She may get away, is it?

1907
01:43:59,808 --> 01:44:01,640
You are yet to resolve the problems
caused by your one link

1908
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:04,307
And now comes with another!! Bloody ass!

1909

1931
01:44:44,787 --> 01:44:46,755
I swear I didn't do anything to her.

1932
01:44:47,723 --> 01:44:51,353
Is there any way to prove
its someone else's child?

1933
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:53,626
What else is the way?

1934
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:57,766
- One Antony, who is pursuing Nursing..
- Yes

1935
01:44:59,101 --> 01:44:59,693
Why don't we contact him?

1936
01:45:00,102 --> 01:45:01,592
Yes, he is the best in such a case.

1937
01:45:02,605 --> 01:45:03,766
- Contact him immediately then.
- Okay

1938
01:45:06,275 --> 01:45:08,107
- Will he be okay?
- He is okay.

1939
01:45:09,478 --> 01:45:10,445
- Hello!
- It's me, buddy.

1940
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:11,274
Tell me buddy.

1941
01:45:11,413 --> 01:45:12,278
- I called to clear my doubt.
- Tell me.

1942
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,610
Any ways to find out the person
responsible for pregnancy?

1943
01:45:15,117 --> 01:45:16,642
For whom, dude?

1944
01:45:16,819 --> 01:45:18,651
Not for me,
dude..It's for one of my friend.

1945
01:45:18,821 --> 01:45:20,255
DNA test might work!

1946
01:45:20,322 --> 01:45:22,654
- How is that done?
- Need Urine for testing.

1947
01:45:22,825 --> 01:45:24,156
Okay buddy. Thanks.

1948
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,458
If collect her urine,
DNA test can be done.

1949
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:28,496
Urine.. how...?

1950
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:35,427
Atma.. Atma...

1951
01:45:35,804 --> 01:45:37,169
My darling!

1952
01:45:40,843 --> 01:45:42,811
No..Don't throw.

1953
01:45:43,145 --> 01:45:44,271
I threw away.

1954
01:45:48,717 --> 01:45:50,845
What you threw now was my life,
you swine!!

1955
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,485
Is this Urine your life?

1956
01:45:53,589 --> 01:45:55,250
I will kill you to death, Swine!!

1957
01:45:55,424 --> 01:45:56,755
What foolishness..

1958
01:45:57,126 --> 01:45:59,527
He was wrong.
DNA test is not possible with Urine!

1959
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,390
Kill me.

1960
01:46:02,464 --> 01:46:03,454
Kill me, rascal!

1961
01:46:03,799 --> 01:46:04,664
Don't make it too over!!

1962
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,132
He told it can be tested with Urine.

1963
01:46:06,268 --> 01:46:07,463
Don't I have the worth of urine also?

1964
01:46:07,636 --> 01:46:09,126
- What nonsense you said!
- What will I do?

1965
01:46:09,304 --> 01:46:10,567
- You said it was possible
- What am I to do?

1966
01:46:10,606 --> 01:46:11,630
- Get lost
- O Buddy

1967
01:46:12,307 --> 01:46:13,468
Nice comedy!

1968
01:46:15,244 --> 01:46:16,075
What is this?

1969
01:46:17,546 --> 01:46:19,344
- Not like this?
- No.

1970
01:46:20,783 --> 01:46:22,148
Sit straight..Keep your hand straight

1971
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:23,780
Here.. Concentrate

1972
01:46:28,057 --> 01:46:30,219
Shucks! What the hell she is up to?

1973
01:46:33,128 --> 01:46:35,324
- Keep your hand straight.
- Papa!

1974
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:37,632
What is this?
Have you swallowed an amplifier?

1975
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,827
Papa, these are not our items.
There are special items for us it seems.

1976
01:46:41,537 --> 01:46:42,333
Are you haPPY?

1977
01:46:42,504 --> 01:46:43,733
Get lost! Get off from here!

1978
01:46:44,073 --> 01:46:45,507
- Why is he losing temper now?
- Get away I say.

1979
01:46:45,774 --> 01:46:47,833
If he is lazy to do exercise,
can't he say that?

1980
01:46:48,777 --> 01:46:51,769
Nothing surprising that his father started
plantain farming after he was born!

1981
01:46:51,847 --> 01:46:53,440
Sis..you know disco"?

1982
01:46:53,582 --> 01:46:54,606
Is it? I don't know.

1983
01:46:54,717 --> 01:46:57,118
Hi Sherin!
Ancy aren't you coming to sleep?

1984
01:46:57,186 --> 01:47:00,417
- I'm sleeping with Sherin today
- Is it? Okay enjoy.

1985
01:47:01,757 --> 01:47:03,589
Everyone will wish for a change!

1986
01:47:06,095 --> 01:47:08,530
You did not think of calling me when
you indulged in it? And now lamenting?

1987
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:10,758
However, please deal this case.

1988
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,261
Is it for this rubbish
you called me from that far?

1989
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,403
What?

1990
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:17,439
Firstly, he is unfit to impregnate someone

1991
01:47:17,606 --> 01:47:18,596
Why?

1992
01:47:18,674 --> 01:47:19,607
Lack of stamina!

1993
01:47:19,775 --> 01:47:21,709
You thought this is
as easy as making pappads!

1994
01:47:22,044 --> 01:47:23,671
Even I've been trying this long since!

1995
01:47:23,746 --> 01:47:27,410
It could be gas trouble!
Give some garlic and ginger paste!

1996
01:47:27,549 --> 01:47:28,345
Pregnancy will go like gas

1997
01:47:28,417 --> 01:47:31,148
No, she is really pregnant.
We checked it with Pregnancy test!

1998
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,153
True!

1999
01:47:32,287 --> 01:47:34,688
- It was double line.
- Really?

2000
01:47:35,057 --> 01:47:38,755
Shucks! Could've rather offered
fireworks worship in the temple!

2001
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:40,287
I would've been gotten
four children by now.

2002
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:41,827
- Must also know to work it
- Stop

2003
01:47:42,364 --> 01:47:43,297
Let me take a fag

2004
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,567
Here comes Pulsar Suni!

2005
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:49,629
Pulsar is the omen for you..

2006
01:47:50,272 --> 01:47:52,138
Probably your problem will also resolve!

2007
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,739
Give some idea please

2008
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,444
<i>Got'?</i>

2009
01:48:02,651 --> 01:48:04,050
Good!

2010
01:48:04,553 --> 01:48:05,714
Come on say.

2011
01:48:05,788 --> 01:48:07,620
Children of this generation seem
to be good players I guess!

2012
01:48:08,657 --> 01:48:10,022
Watch! Full of goals only.

2013
01:48:10,492 --> 01:48:12,756
Find some solution to my problem first.

2014
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,759
- Is she sure that it's her child
and not yours? - Eh!

2015
01:48:16,131 --> 01:48:17,496
Answer to my question first.

2016
01:48:17,766 --> 01:48:19,029
I don't get your question.

2017
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,464
You did not have anything
to understand at that moment?

2018
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:25,736
Dude! Asking if she is sure
that it's her child and not yours!

2019
01:48:25,808 --> 01:48:27,139
Now who is pregnant here?

2020
01:48:27,342 --> 01:48:29,674
Pregnant is your dad! Swine!

2021
01:48:30,078 --> 01:48:31,136
Can you however deal this please?

2022
01:48:31,313 --> 01:48:34,339
- I could that. How about
the things around her? -That's..

2023
01:48:34,516 --> 01:48:36,143
Not sure if she got any marks around

2024
01:48:36,318 --> 01:48:37,342
Somewhere around here there is..

2025
01:48:37,486 --> 01:48:40,046
Dude...please understand my situation

2026
01:48:40,255 --> 01:48:41,484
May not be sensitive !

2027
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:42,490
Put on a dog lock..

2028
01:48:42,658 --> 01:48:44,524
Were you born in any bricks factory?

2029
01:48:44,693 --> 01:48:45,683
Full of muck!!

2030
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,523
She is well off

2031
01:48:48,697 --> 01:48:49,357
Really?   www.TamilMV.re

2032
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:50,523
Shall I tell the truth now?

2033
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:53,167
I'm sole responsible for her pregnancy

2034
01:48:54,136 --> 01:48:55,467
- You rascal!
- Oh god!

2035
01:48:55,637 --> 01:48:57,628
This pregnancy makes his life sucks,
you know?

2036
01:48:58,173 --> 01:48:59,231
It's not mine!

2037
01:48:59,308 --> 01:49:00,002
Hold this a minute!

2038
01:49:01,043 --> 01:49:02,010
Just now you admitted you are responsible

2039
01:49:02,177 --> 01:49:02,643
Thank you.

2040
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:07,478
No wonder to get pregnant here

2041
01:49:07,649 --> 01:49:09,174
You guys are good hitters isn't it?

2042
01:49:10,652 --> 01:49:14,020
You guys keep cracking comedy!
But it's me who won a trophy!

2043
01:49:14,056 --> 01:49:16,024
- Sorry da
- Not a comedy, come here.

2044
01:49:17,392 --> 01:49:20,487
First stay away from these rogues!

2045
01:49:20,662 --> 01:49:23,029
Or you will suffer more than this.

2046
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:25,496
- For your rescue,
there are only 2 ideas left -What?

2047
01:49:25,567 --> 01:49:28,502
Get away from here
and survive doing any jobs!

2048
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:31,503
I hardly know any jobs

2049
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:33,336
What is the second idea?

2050
01:49:33,508 --> 01:49:35,340
Do one thing. Marry her then

2051
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:38,808
Wow! What a best ideal!
Get off with your idea!

2052
01:49:39,214 --> 01:49:43,378
- Marry her and take away her maximum gold
and wealth - Then?

2053
01:49:43,452 --> 01:49:44,510
Flee away!

2054
01:49:44,686 --> 01:49:46,518
And return after 2 or 3 years!

2055
01:49:46,688 --> 01:49:48,520
By then dust will get settled here!

2056
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,350
How is my idea?
I will do all arrangements to flee!

2057
01:49:51,526 --> 01:49:55,485
- So I can live happily for 2 years
without doing any work, is it? - Of course!

2058
01:49:55,697 --> 01:49:56,459
How is it?

2059
01:49:57,199 --> 01:50:00,294
- Lovely! - Go ahead and make all
arrangements for marriage.

2060
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:03,097
- I will take care of the rest.
- Like your name, you are really lovely!

2061
01:50:03,405 --> 01:50:05,430
Needn't say! All knows!

2062
01:50:05,707 --> 01:50:07,334
- Okay, done.
- Give hand.

2063
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:12,110
God bless you

2064
01:50:12,247 --> 01:50:12,907
Let's go dude!

2065
01:50:13,181 --> 01:50:17,175
Today's celebration is for him.
Say Cheers!

2066
01:50:21,523 --> 01:50:23,685
- We must have a good bash tomorrow!
- Definitely!

2067
01:50:24,459 --> 01:50:26,188
Look at his sheer luck! That is luck..

2068
01:50:26,361 --> 01:50:29,023
- Because of Riya's money, is it?
- Else how?

2069
01:50:29,097 --> 01:50:29,791
That is not the reason, buddy.

2070
01:50:30,198 --> 01:50:32,530
I appreciate you in one thing.

2071
01:50:32,801 --> 01:50:36,704
He effortlessly fathered a child!

2072
01:50:37,205 --> 01:50:38,070
Correct!

2073
01:50:38,206 --> 01:50:39,799
Doesn't matter if have no children.

2074
01:50:40,075 --> 01:50:41,668
When take one, you get one free, is it?

2075
01:50:42,477 --> 01:50:44,377
What have you thought of me?

2076
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:47,513
- That I will marry her
and accept her child!! - Then?

2077
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:49,708
Romario Varghese must be a fool then!!

2078
01:50:50,218 --> 01:50:51,743
What the hell are you up to then?

2079
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,655
I will marry her,
take her money and flee to Dubai.

2080
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:57,486
Premettan has already
made arrangements for that.

2081
01:50:58,026 --> 01:51:00,222
You guys keep loitering around, dogs!

2082
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:01,757
Would you dump her and go?

2083
01:51:02,164 --> 01:51:02,653
What happened?

2084
01:51:08,337 --> 01:51:09,099
When did you come?

2085
01:51:09,304 --> 01:51:12,205
You will marry me and
abscond with cash, is it?

2086
01:51:12,274 --> 01:51:14,242
I can't hold responsibility
of someone else's child.

2087
01:51:14,309 --> 01:51:17,335
Won't I become preghnant if use me
3 times like a medicine?

2088
01:51:19,348 --> 01:51:21,680
Excuse me, it's PREGNANT and not Preghnant

2089
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:23,117
Whatever it may be!

2090
01:51:23,185 --> 01:51:25,483
But who told you all this?

2091
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:31,382
It's me!

2092
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:36,357
What the hell did you take you to be?

2093
01:51:36,698 --> 01:51:38,564
You could go on a trip with him..
...Share bed with him..

2094
01:51:38,633 --> 01:51:40,192
Using him 3 times a day medicinel!

2095
01:51:40,268 --> 01:51:41,429
But couldn't marry him.

2096
01:51:41,503 --> 01:51:42,527
Did he tell you all this?

2097
01:51:42,704 --> 01:51:45,196
Apart from telling,
also sent us the photos" Have a look..

2098
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,069
We are nothing

2099
01:51:47,442 --> 01:51:50,537
You at last spoiled
and dumped an innocent boy!

2100
01:51:50,679 --> 01:51:53,478
Stop it! If man and woman travel together,
does it means only sex?

2101
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:54,739
No.

2102
01:51:55,117 --> 01:51:57,142
- Whatever he said, all are white lies!
- Is it?

2103
01:51:57,486 --> 01:51:59,011
Whom do we trust now?

2104
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:00,313
Trust her or him?

2105
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:02,648
It is true that I like him.

2106
01:52:02,724 --> 01:52:03,657
But Papa will not agree.

2107
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,253
- Moreover his bloody lies!
- True

2108
01:52:06,328 --> 01:52:07,591
Yes, he does.

2109
01:52:08,063 --> 01:52:10,157
Can you guys stand by
me to make him speak the truth?

2110
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:12,999
- H mm.
-ol<

2111
01:52:15,003 --> 01:52:15,663
Stop it all of you.

2112
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:19,037
How about the double
line in the pregnancy test?

2113
01:52:23,512 --> 01:52:25,276
Look at his doubts!

2114
01:52:25,347 --> 01:52:26,508
Tell me guys

2115
01:52:26,715 --> 01:52:29,047
Story unfolds..

2116
01:52:29,317 --> 01:52:30,580
- Hello
- Hello Riya

2117
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:32,652
- Our plan misfired!
- What happened?

2118
01:52:32,721 --> 01:52:35,349
- Sherin is coming home with
Pregnancy test - Oh no.

2119
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:36,521
What shall I do now?

2120
01:52:36,725 --> 01:52:37,692
You google and see

2121
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:39,357
- Definitely find a solution.
-ol<

2122
01:52:50,405 --> 01:52:51,372
Urine..

2123
01:52:56,078 --> 01:52:58,638
Abbas was of some use to us!

2124
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:00,376
Abbas? Which Abbas?

2125
01:53:02,184 --> 01:53:06,121
The one who comes in
the toilet cleaning ad!

2126
01:53:06,521 --> 01:53:07,386
<i>Got it'?</i>

2127
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:12,423
Tomorrow we will have good
bash at their wedding! Okay.

2128
01:53:17,466 --> 01:53:18,456
Is it ok for all of you?

2129
01:53:18,633 --> 01:53:19,794
Of course!

2130
01:53:22,737 --> 01:53:25,331
Playing tricks with my dad!!!

2131
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:29,106
Of late you are boozing heavily

2132
01:53:29,277 --> 01:53:30,472
Business is totally dull.

2133
01:53:30,712 --> 01:53:32,271
My hopes are in you now!

2134
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:34,176
Hopes!!! I already have 10 - 20 backlogs

2135
01:53:34,316 --> 01:53:36,216
Unlike earlier,
Engineering has no demand now

2136
01:53:36,384 --> 01:53:37,146
What is your plan then?

2137
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:38,844
- Why don't I get married?
- What?

2138
01:53:39,121 --> 01:53:40,611
- I will marry a rich girl
- Wh0?

2139
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:43,215
Your friend,
Pappi Uncle's daughter Pinky..

2140
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:44,848
I've an eye on her since childhood

2141
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:48,659
If marry her,
I will get abundance of wealth

2142
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:50,491
My life will also be settled, dad.

2143
01:53:50,565 --> 01:53:53,432
That's..But Pappi was saying
she is living a wayward life in Bangalore.

2144
01:53:53,735 --> 01:53:55,760
I will deal that.
Will you stand by me, dad?

2145
01:54:00,142 --> 01:54:01,132
She is one of our Chunkzzs!

2146
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:03,601
Idea is good but it's quite risky

2147
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,614
- If matter gets leaked, we're dead!
- Bull shit!

2148
01:54:07,782 --> 01:54:08,613
Oh God!

2149
01:54:09,317 --> 01:54:11,183
Hello Sherin Darling! Where are you?

2150
01:54:11,253 --> 01:54:12,152
Tell me dude! What's it?

2151
01:54:12,687 --> 01:54:14,621
- Isn't Riya with you?
- Yes, why?

2152
01:54:15,257 --> 01:54:17,282
A small plan!

2153
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,822
It will benefit you as well.

2154
01:54:19,194 --> 01:54:21,185
In that case I'm okay

2155
01:54:21,496 --> 01:54:22,657
However try and bring Riya here.

2156
01:54:23,365 --> 01:54:25,094
I and my dad shall deal the rest.

2157
01:54:25,167 --> 01:54:26,191
Okay, deal!

2158
01:54:26,334 --> 01:54:28,268
I will give you a whack!
Tell me what the problem is.

2159
01:54:28,537 --> 01:54:31,734
This girl is the one who wants to marry
my daughter is causing all the troubles.

2160
01:54:31,806 --> 01:54:33,171
Ohh...

2161
01:54:35,277 --> 01:54:35,800
Here..

2162
01:54:36,478 --> 01:54:38,173
...is the price you demanded

2163
01:54:38,446 --> 01:54:39,277
Only 50,000?

2164
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:41,171
<i>Romario agreed to pay me 5 has!</i>

2165
01:54:41,349 --> 01:54:43,647
Let it work.
Then I will pay the balance amount.

2166
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:46,679
Why do I need to bother
if it works or not?

2167
01:54:46,855 --> 01:54:49,825
If I'm not paid what I demanded,
then you will see my true colours.

2168
01:54:50,559 --> 01:54:56,430
My dear lass!
You don't know this Varkeyacchan's nature!

2169
01:55:00,735 --> 01:55:04,103
Don't let her study in Bangalore any more.

2170
01:55:04,272 --> 01:55:05,262
Let her study here

2171
01:55:05,473 --> 01:55:08,170
I too wish that,
but she is doing her final year now.

2172
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:11,174
At this last moment, how will she get
admission in college here?

2173
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:14,541
- I could get her admitted in
Rome's college - Really?

2174
01:55:14,616 --> 01:55:16,414
But it will cost a little

2175
01:55:16,484 --> 01:55:19,476
Doesn't matter!
Cost not matters! Get her admission

2176
01:55:19,554 --> 01:55:21,147
Shall we go for a trip?

2177
01:55:21,323 --> 01:55:22,313
- Trip?
- Yeah

2178
01:55:23,558 --> 01:55:24,787
Let's go to Goa then

2179
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:27,629
Goa is fine.. but don't be too lavish

2180
01:55:28,096 --> 01:55:29,154
Come on, dad. I know.

2181
01:55:29,331 --> 01:55:31,163
We shouldn't be stingy in such things

2182
01:55:31,333 --> 01:55:33,631
Only if you throw some
money can we get returns

2183
01:55:34,169 --> 01:55:34,567
Hello!

2184
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:35,660
Sherin dear!

2185
01:55:37,272 --> 01:55:38,637
Pappiachhayan has given
his consent to this marriage.

2186
01:55:38,707 --> 01:55:40,835
Fantasticl! Don't forget my cash!

2187
01:55:41,109 --> 01:55:44,511
If this marriage gels over,
I and dad will have a great bash!

2188
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,677
Let me take the support of my leg..

2189
01:55:48,683 --> 01:55:49,343
Take it.

2190
01:55:49,784 --> 01:55:52,219
- I am sure no old habit of
manipulation, is it? -Manipulation?!

2191
01:55:54,589 --> 01:55:57,115
Along with the price demanded,
I also added Service tax!

2192
01:55:57,459 --> 01:55:58,426
Then it will be better for you

2193
01:55:58,627 --> 01:56:01,756
We are now Multimillionaires!

2194
01:56:02,597 --> 01:56:03,587
Dad! What are you up to?

2195
01:56:03,765 --> 01:56:05,233
I thought it was her.

2196
01:56:11,239 --> 01:56:14,607
Looks these fools are dancing
without knowing the facts!

2197
01:56:16,211 --> 01:56:18,771
Pappi's nephews in Uniform, those fools"

2198
01:56:19,147 --> 01:56:20,444
shall make them also naught and rock!

2199
01:56:20,615 --> 01:56:22,481
That's simple, dad! Deal!

2200
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:25,109
We are the real Chunku, dad!

2201
01:56:25,186 --> 01:56:27,416
I'll give you a whack! Chunkzz!!

2202
01:56:27,622 --> 01:56:30,319
Yeah Chunkzz!!

2203
01:56:31,293 --> 01:56:32,454
O my dear!

2204
01:56:33,461 --> 01:56:34,451
What happened, dad?

2205
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:37,621
- Screwed!! We're screwed
- O God!

2206
01:56:39,234 --> 01:56:40,326
Let's run away, dad

2207
01:56:41,636 --> 01:56:43,798
Was it all preplanned by both of you?

2208
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:47,472
I never expected you will do this to me.

2209
01:56:48,343 --> 01:56:49,401
- That's..
- Don't talk a word either.

2210
01:56:50,312 --> 01:56:53,077
Dad and son thought of gulping a
full bottle all alone, is it?

2211
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:54,113
Pour a glass for me also

2212
01:56:54,749 --> 01:56:55,739
Pour it dude!

2213
01:56:57,585 --> 01:56:58,279
Do it, son.

2214
01:56:58,353 --> 01:56:59,752
Chunkz!!

2215

“Call them, bro“

2222
01:57:51,639 --> 01:57:54,438

He and she, those people and these people

Here and there scattered,
like a sea of laughter

Hey you! Sing our song

Hello Premettan! What is up?

Put her to sleep and try to flee away
