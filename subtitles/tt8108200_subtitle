1
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,869
Dadda!

2
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:42,431
We have to take another route.

3
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:32,198
Take Holy Mother's name
and keep walking.

4
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:45,079
'Sonchiriya'

5
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,323
What happened?

6
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,889
Dead snakes carry a curse, Dadda.

7
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:00,293
Changing routes won't
change the curse.

8
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,654
Once you're cursed,

9
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,895
you stay cursed.

10
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,251
What are you afraid of?

11
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,897
Death?

12
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:26,373
I've spent a lifetime
in these ravines.

13
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,658
I have no reason to fear death.

14
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,294
Then?

15
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,776
I felt pride in calling
myself a rebel.

16
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:37,820
Now I feel shame.

17
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,262
Rebels beware!

18
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,030
The Chinese used these
guns in the '62 war.

19
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:25,943
Indians and Chinese are like bros
who shoot at each other like pros.

20
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,626
How much?

21
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,023
35 for one.

22
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,069
60 for two.

23
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,946
We can't buy them right now.

24
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:42,149
But we need them right now. Gujjar
is after us with all he's got.

25
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,352
There is a way, Man Singh.

26
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:49,428
You know that ever since Phuliya
has made her own gang

27
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,426
the Mallah caste rebels are
hunting for Beni Ram.

28
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:55,752
Moving around with my face covered.

29
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,950
This is no bloody way to live.

30
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,670
You commit a sin. You have to pay.

31
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,513
And have you paid for yours?

32
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,149
It's only been 2 weeks.

33
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:16,990
Sermons are for the Brahmins.

34
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,714
Doesn't suit us Thakurs.

35
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,035
Look,

36
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,951
Phuliya has camped
near our village Naroda

37
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,312
waiting to kill him.

38
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:32,872
You get rid of her.
The guns are yours.

39
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,522
Lachhu is here.

40
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:15,404
Are the kids okay?

41
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,761
Yes. Yes, Dadda.

42
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,241
There's news, Dadda.

43
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,125
What?

44
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:27,047
There's a wedding in Brahmpuri,
the jeweller's daughter.

45
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,565
He's giving a kilo
of gold as dowry.

46
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:32,724
And cash too.

47
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:36,484
You sure about this?

48
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,126
Yes, Dadda.

49
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,125
Are you okay?

50
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,050
What happened?

51
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:51,923
Hey, Lachhu,

52
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,365
is there something you want to say?

53
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,173
Vakil...

54
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:07,247
Vakil!

55
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:11,089
Vakil!

56
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,013
Yes, Dadda.

57
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:13,856
Come here.

58
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:15,369
Yes, Dadda.

59
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:17,412
Give Lachhu 500 rupees.

60
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,336
What are you looking at? Go ahead.

61
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,692
For his father's medicines.

62
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:26,931
What happened?

63
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,776
And listen up everyone.

64
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,533
We head to Brahmpuri
for a loot tomorrow.

65
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:40,013
The jeweller there is rich enough
to take care of all our debts.

66
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,777
Right, Lachhu?

67
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,296
Now, Dadda?

68
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,974
With the cops all over us?

69
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,300
That's exactly why we need to rob.

70
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,375
We need new weapons.

71
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:52,778
Or you'd rather have
the cops over for a picnic.

72
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,574
I didn't mean that.

73
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,102
But the STF... - The Police will
uphold their Dharma.

74
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,140
The rebels, theirs'.

75
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,695
What is the rebel's Dharma?

76
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,103
It's okay if anyone doesn't want
to come to the loot.

77
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:13,502
Meet us directly at Holy Mother's
temple in Pachrola.

78
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:16,423
All together now Rebel Man Singh...
- All Hail!

79
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,339
Rebel Man Singh...
- All Hail!

80
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,382
Rebel Man Singh...
- All Hail!

81
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:03,311
Ma'am, move your hand a little.
Yes, that's it. Smile.

82
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,952
Buzz off, you swine!

83
00:11:16,032 --> 00:11:18,832
'The president has
proclaimed emergency.'

84
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,227
'This is nothing to panic about.'

85
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:23,350
'I am sure you are all conscious'

86
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,989
'of the deep and
widespread conspiracy,'

87
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:29,708
'which has been brewing
ever since I began introducing'

88
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,911
'drastic and progressive measures
of pension for common man...'

89
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:38,152
What's done is done, kiddo.

90
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:40,276
Forget about it.

91
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:41,673
Yes, brother.

92
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:42,876
What did I say?

93
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,278
Forget about it.

94
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:46,553
Lakhna.
- Yes, Dadda.

95
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,597
Come here.

96
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:52,038
Take eight men and head
to the mansion to keep watch.

97
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,193
Don't you trust me anymore?

98
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:58,357
What did you say?

99
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,679
But...

100
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,918
What did you see in
the river yesterday?

101
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:13,999
Whatever it was, I saw it too.

102
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,003
You still want to talk
about trust here?

103
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,883
Silly boy.

104
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,003
I know that...

105
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:31,808
When I need you, you will come.

106
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,844
Hail Holy Mother!
- Hail Holy Mother!

107
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:38,005
Hail Holy Mother!
- Hail Holy Mother!

108
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:41,041
Hail Holy Mother!
- Hail Holy Mother!

109
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,163
Hail Holy Mother!
- Hail Holy Mother!

110
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,243
Brahmpuri folks!

111
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:51,682
This is rebel Man Singh's gang!

112
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:56,242
There's no reason to be afraid.

113
00:12:57,524 --> 00:13:01,529
Let us do our work in peace.

114
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:07,805
We urge the ladies to take their
children and go inside their homes.

115
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:12,887
The men stay exactly
where they are.

116
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,287
If you try to be a hero,

117
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,771
you will be shot.

118
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,533
Madam.

119
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,293
The bride's room, please?

120
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:51,290
'If there is no unity
and discipline,'

121
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,254
'then our foundations
will be weak.'

122
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:59,331
'On our road to progress,
if a comrade trips and falls,'

123
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,976
'then our instinct is to help...'

124
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:18,857
Nobody touches the jewellery
the bride wears on her.

125
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,459
Hey, Vakil.

126
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,660
Hand over the bride
her wedding gift.

127
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,065
101 rupees.

128
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,788
I beg you...

129
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,103
Nothing will happen.

130
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,744
Kindly hand over the cash, sir.

131
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,423
Hey. Hey...

132
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:15,148
Someone get a chair.

133
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:17,743
Not for me, son.
For the gentleman here.

134
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,148
Sit down.

135
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,390
Call all units.

136
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,432
All units be alert.

137
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,194
Wait for signal to attack.

138
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:50,270
'All units be alert.'

139
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,074
'Wait for signal to attack.'

140
00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:01,353
Hey, old man.
It's time for your retirement.

141
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,237
Here.

142
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,878
The enemy's here, rebels beware!

143
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,519
Bhoora, check what happened.
- Let's go!

144
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:40,359
Hold it, Vakil.

145
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:49,358
We've been surrounded.

146
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:55,124
Rascal, you ratted on us?

147
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,721
You ratted on us?

148
00:16:56,842 --> 00:17:00,760
No sir! We were told that
a few policemen will be nearby.

149
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,966
Hey, don't hit them Vakil.

150
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,604
You rascal! I'll kill you.

151
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,244
Where's your head?

152
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,043
Have you left it behind?

153
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:16,321
If he knew, would he have risked
the lives of women and children?

154
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:20,404
None of them die today.

155
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:23,088
None of them. Do you understand?

156
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:26,086
Do you?

157
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,727
'Man Singh.'

158
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,812
'Your game is over.'

159
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:37,051
'Tell your men to
throw their weapons'

160
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,849
'and come out into
the lane on all fours. '

161
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,367
Shut up you two bit copper.
I'll have your head.

162
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,014
Calm down.

163
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:50,132
Calm down.

164
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:53,213
Nothing will happen.

165
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,049
Get inside everyone.

166
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:59,651
Sir, please go in.

167
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:05,371
6 rifles and 2 SLRs at the gate.
No one enters the house.

168
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,615
Yes, Dadda. Let's go.

169
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:08,814
The rest come with
me to the terrace.

170
00:18:08,894 --> 00:18:10,419
Move. Move...

171
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,776
Die you rascals!

172
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,098
Give me your hand.

173
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,614
C'mon, hurry up.

174
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,655
Move to the right.

175
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,460
Babu, climb up the stairs.

176
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:14,072
Hey, Gujjar!
Have you forgotten your aim?

177
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:24,624
Khalifa, cover me!

178
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,466
Run, you idiot!

179
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,589
Hey, Natthi!
- Shera, move forward!

180
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:45,637
Don't let them move
towards the house.

181
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,587
I am trapped.

182
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,471
Lakhna?

183
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,231
Where are you going?

184
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:15,716
Balak Ram, are you okay?

185
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,073
"Hey rebel!"

186
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,276
"My forsaken rebel!"

187
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,516
Dadda? Are you okay?

188
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,877
These government bullets
aren't going to kill us.

189
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:53,397
Only their promises

190
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,436
kill friends, Indians
and countrymen.

191
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:03,401
"Not Lord Vishnu's avatar..."

192
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:10,804
"Not any snake's venom..."

193
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,524
Listen.

194
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:20,601
I just want to go to the roof.

195
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,324
Are you a cop or a rebel?

196
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:25,283
Don't ask me again.

197
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,608
The rebel's rifle
doesn't like such questions.

198
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:31,448
Go ahead.

199
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:36,682
"Not Lord Vishnu's avatar."

200
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,524
"Not any snake's venom."

201
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,009
"And yet, the king of the ravines."

202
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:47,248
"You are..."

203
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:53,804
"'In the game of virtue,"

204
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:57,608
"the dice of sin is yours."

205
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,327
"The red-eyed dawn follows"

206
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:05,129
"the night that offers no rest."

207
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,610
"Hey, rebel!"

208
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,973
"My forsaken rebel."

209
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:32,532
"Not the angel of death."

210
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:36,213
'Not the ghost that
haunts the soul."

211
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,858
'Just a reptile at the bottom
of the river Chambal..."

212
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:43,335
"You are..."

213
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:49,376
"The feet are dirty."

214
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:53,059
"But the soul is unblemished."

215
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,904
"The dawn..."

216
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,955
Dadda!

217
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,187
The path is clear.

218
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,150
Dadda!

219
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:55,435
Dadda!

220
00:24:56,878 --> 00:25:00,038
Lakhna, Run...
- Let's go, Lakhna. Come on!

221
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,953
'Don't let them get away.'

222
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:32,043
C'mon, hurry up!

223
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:35,121
Get inside the van! Faster!

224
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,998
Hurry.

225
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:47,005
'Well done, Virender Singh. Over.'

226
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,681
'There's time yet for
compliments, sir.'

227
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,645
'Half the gang is still at large.'

228
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:52,603
'Over.'

229
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:55,806
'Any arrests? Over.'

230
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:58,764
'No, sir.'

231
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:01,606
'All 15 are dead.'

232
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,009
'Over.'

233
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,445
'Singh'

234
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:08,406
'don't make this personal.'

235
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,527
'Over.'

236
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:10,849
'Not at all.'

237
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,489
'You've entrusted me
to clean up the Chambal.'

238
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,246
'I'm only following orders.'

239
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:19,571
'Over'

240
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:20,885
'and out.'

241
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:26,450
'For my brethren of the Gujjar
community. - Balkhandiya Gujjar.'

242
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:36,621
He's dead already.

243
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,578
Now these Gujjars want to chew
at his corpse like vultures?

244
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,219
'The mice are preyed
on by the snake,'

245
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,223
'the snake is preyed
on by the vulture.'

246
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:52,624
'The Gods looked down and said,
"Well, that's the law of nature".'

247
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,340
Kakku, he's a human being.

248
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,023
And a Thakur at that.

249
00:27:57,103 --> 00:28:00,666
Not your village,
not your Inspector.

250
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,583
Keep your trap shut here

251
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,667
else you'll lose your job

252
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,343
and your life too.

253
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,826
'Her fight is our fight'

254
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:16,508
'Ignore rumours and loose talks.
Just do your job'

255
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,113
'We are getting there.
- Hold him!'

256
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:50,950
'Keep moving!'

257
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,233
Hold tight, Balak Ram.

258
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,673
Oh, Dadda!

259
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,834
Killed by the bite of a dead snake.

260
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:20,680
Lachhu is that snake.

261
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:23,354
And he's not dead yet.

262
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:25,595
Lachhu owes his life to Dadda.

263
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:27,759
He couldn't have done this.

264
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,834
Lachhu's your cousin, right?

265
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,436
Where were you during
the loot, Lakhna?

266
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:35,798
Answer him.

267
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:38,476
The answer is in the
barrel of my gun.

268
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:39,838
Do you want it?

269
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,801
Didn't see any of
them in the house.

270
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,842
Hey, watch it!

271
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,760
We were on the watch on
Dadda's orders.

272
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:52,043
And you all are alive
only because of Lakhna.

273
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,124
Have you all lost it?

274
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,321
You want to kill each other now?

275
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:03,602
Look at his condition.

276
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,961
We have to take him
to a hospital or he'll die.

277
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:12,726
Lakhna had told Dadda

278
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,006
that it is not a good time
for a loot.

279
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:16,571
But nobody listened.

280
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,965
What else could he have done?

281
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,923
Did he have a choice?

282
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,809
Surrender.

283
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:27,728
What?

284
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:30,166
The Police Captain
of Dholpur has offered

285
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,803
those who surrender
will be treated justly.

286
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:35,889
If we cross the border into
Rajasthan... - Justice by cops?

287
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,572
They threw Dadda alive from
the roof. And you expect justice...

288
00:30:39,652 --> 00:30:42,688
That was STF and this is Rajasthan
Police. There's a difference.

289
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,968
Don't teach me the law.

290
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:47,651
Admit it you don't have
the guts to fight anymore.

291
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:49,126
Don't you feel any remorse

292
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:50,890
for what we've done?

293
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,808
I do feel remorse.

294
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,137
But that doesn't mean
we stop following our Dharma.

295
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:58,410
I asked Dadda. Now I ask you.

296
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,013
What is a rebel's
Dharma Vakil Singh?

297
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:06,812
To live and die in the ravines.

298
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,371
To protect his caste
and his people.

299
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:11,375
To not show his back in battle

300
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,171
but take a bullet on his chest.

301
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:16,534
And that's the Dharma that
Dadda followed unto his death.

302
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,856
Did he? Or did he not?

303
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,741
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

304
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,412
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

305
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:23,216
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

306
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,015
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

307
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:26,818
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

308
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:28,974
Our leader Man Singh...
- All Hail!

309
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,425
Let us go or I'll shoot.

310
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:29,106
This is a gang of Thakurs.

311
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:31,422
We respect women.

312
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:33,185
Put the gun down.

313
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,308
These ravines are no
place for a woman.

314
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,310
This little girl has been violated.

315
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:41,466
She's in great pain. I have to get
her to the hospital now.

316
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:43,626
Where are the men of the house?

317
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:47,344
All of them murdered.

318
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,589
It was a dispute over land.

319
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:52,268
I'd gone to the river so was saved.

320
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:56,306
They're still hunting for us so
I escaped to the ravines.

321
00:32:56,386 --> 00:32:57,510
What caste are you?

322
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,789
Thakur.

323
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:00,310
And she?

324
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,237
She's my little sister.

325
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:04,590
Please...

326
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,349
Help us get to the hospital.

327
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:10,787
They'll kill us if they find us.

328
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:12,471
Please take us.

329
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,390
We've got enough problems already.

330
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:15,952
We're going to the hospital anyway.

331
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,515
They can come along with us.

332
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,910
Bhoora is right.

333
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,194
Think about it.
These are Thakur women.

334
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:25,881
Protecting our caste and
our people. Isn't that our Dharma?

335
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,075
Protect then.

336
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:34,952
Please take us.

337
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,322
Hold on.

338
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,758
This late...

339
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,482
Lakhna.

340
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,077
We got the news about Dadda.

341
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,641
Heard many of the gang were lost?

342
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,284
What happened?

343
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,603
What are you looking
for in the toilet?

344
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,483
Wake him up.

345
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:48,446
I tried, but he isn't waking up.

346
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,484
Hey, doctor. Hey.

347
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:58,810
Wake up.

348
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:03,448
Hey, doctor. Wake up.

349
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,733
Who is it?

350
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,491
Where are you taking me?

351
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,614
The cops are on the alert.

352
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,978
They're spying on the
doctors as well.

353
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:52,976
Lakhna.

354
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,101
My back is all scraped.

355
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:59,221
It's not safe right now, Lakhna.
It's best you leave.

356
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,019
Listen.

357
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:03,182
I will come to the
ravines tomorrow.

358
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,823
The rebels never forget, doctor.

359
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:11,022
Help us now and we'll help
you for the next two lives.

360
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,059
Okay?

361
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:16,902
Go ahead.

362
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:19,506
Gopal, get my kit.
- Yes.

363
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:23,422
Who are they?

364
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:26,706
They are Thakurs. Someone
has brutalised the child.

365
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,624
Take them inside.

366
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,103
Gopal.
- Yes.

367
00:36:30,184 --> 00:36:34,508
Run to the clinic and get me
these pills and instruments.

368
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,463
Nobody leaves.

369
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:44,067
Trust the words of a Thakur,
even if you can't trust a doctor.

370
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:55,988
Come fast.
- Yes.

371
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,152
Hold him tight.

372
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,350
What's up, boy?

373
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:29,034
How's this movie?
"The Rebel's Revenge."

374
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:34,316
It's garbage, sir. The bandits
ride on horses in this one.

375
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:36,156
Bandits on horses?

376
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,235
We want to see the ones on foot.

377
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,634
Say, you'll show us?

378
00:37:46,636 --> 00:37:49,036
'Do the check-up.
- It's horrible!'

379
00:37:49,115 --> 00:37:50,396
Bloody animals!

380
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:52,317
Will she make it?

381
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:55,154
The wound's deep.
There's internal bleeding.

382
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,637
She needs surgery.

383
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,558
May have to remove the uterus.

384
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,477
I'm giving her
an injection for the pain.

385
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:04,957
Have put some packing as well.
- Yes.

386
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,038
But she needs a big hospital.

387
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,121
What?
- Gwalior or Dholpur.

388
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:13,000
Surgery should happen
within 48 hours.

389
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:14,158
Or else

390
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:17,763
she won't make it.
- How will it happen, doctor?

391
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:19,996
Where the hell is Gopal?

392
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:32,765
Vakil Singh!
- Doctor. No, please.

393
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:34,640
What happened, doctor?

394
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,202
How dare you bring this girl
into my home?

395
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,639
What happened?

396
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:42,121
This happened.
The girl is of Jhirsa caste.

397
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,202
You could have sent
her to the clinic.

398
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:45,326
Gopal would have checked her.

399
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:47,885
But in my own home? An untouchable?

400
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,446
I swear on Holy Mother.

401
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,725
I belong to your caste
from Ghardori village.

402
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,684
Stop it, Vakil. She's a woman.

403
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:02,844
You wanted them to
come with us, right?

404
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,253
Lakhna Singh can't
be trusted any more.

405
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,967
They were whispering to each other
on the way here.

406
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,048
What did you say?

407
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,405
It's the truth.

408
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,527
Switch off the light.
Shut it down.

409
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:23,809
And the engine too.
- Shut the engine.

410
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:26,609
Where are the reinforcements?

411
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,651
On the way, sir.

412
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:29,768
The truck had a flat tire.

413
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,973
They are replacing it.
And will be here any moment.

414
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:34,732
Your son will tell his pals in
school that my father was martyred

415
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:36,536
because the truck had a flat tire.

416
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:39,651
Switch it off!

417
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:42,051
The enemy's here, rebels beware!

418
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:46,853
It's the cops!

419
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,974
What did I tell you?

420
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:54,493
Nobody leaves.

421
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,577
Didn't I tell you!

422
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,693
How dare you rat on us?

423
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,815
Why would I send Gopal if
I had to rat on you?

424
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:04,298
Vakil, think about
getting out of here.

425
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,101
Badlu!
- Yes, sir.

426
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:11,137
Get 10-15 men from
the village nearby.

427
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:12,774
I don't understand, sir.

428
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,856
If you did, you would've been
an inspector.

429
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:15,740
Scram!

430
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,016
Son.

431
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:20,456
Is there any other way to
escape from the house?

432
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:23,621
Had it made for such situations.

433
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:26,017
Opens up behind the house.
Hurry up.

434
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:27,580
C'mon guys, move.

435
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,179
Follow me.

436
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:32,102
Come on!
- Open it.

437
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,261
It's too late.

438
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,182
Gopal, you snitch!

439
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,819
This is to inform all the bandits

440
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,540
that the police
has surrounded the house.

441
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,944
You guys are completely cornered.

442
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:59,223
10 brave cops lay
siege behind the house.

443
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:01,986
And 12 in front.

444
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,584
That leaves you guys
with no options.

445
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:07,268
Quickly get behind the Inspector.

446
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:10,549
Think about it.

447
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,707
If you surrender

448
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:18,830
you save your lives and
government's bullets too.

449
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:21,305
The country progresses

450
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:24,108
and your family tree too.

451
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:31,707
Use your head, Vakil Singh.

452
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,508
When your Dadda couldn't
take on the police,

453
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:38,151
what makes you think that you can?

454
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:03,032
Enough of the rebel's
life, brothers.

455
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:06,681
Time to become the
government's guests

456
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,518
and enjoy free lunches
the rest of your lives.

457
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:15,354
Get up, everyone.

458
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:17,835
We fight our way out.

459
00:42:18,754 --> 00:42:20,155
On the count of three.

460
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:24,395
Vakil!

461
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,118
What are you doing, Lakhna?

462
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:32,357
Listen.

463
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:37,882
Bhoora and Khalifa will be with me.
The rest will stay here.

464
00:42:38,676 --> 00:42:39,996
Khalifa, open the door.

465
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,000
Come on.

466
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:46,678
I owe you a wall.

467
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:50,759
Everybody move back.

468
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:15,885
Rascals!

469
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,124
Come on!

470
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:22,082
Move! Move!

471
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:24,927
Hurry up towards the road.

472
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,967
Hey! Be ready to fire.

473
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:29,686
Move fast.

474
00:43:30,726 --> 00:43:32,568
Take us with you.
The police won't spare us.

475
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:34,963
Just tell them the truth.
They will drop you home.

476
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,528
But we can't go home.
- What?

477
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:37,926
What happened?

478
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,133
Stop!

479
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,047
Don't move.

480
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,449
Get the kid.

481
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,934
Let's go!

482
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:10,692
I had told you that I'll come
to the ravines. - Move!

483
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:12,336
Look at what you've done.

484
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:14,050
Lakhna, listen!

485
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:31,416
Stop him.

486
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,417
Stop. Stop.

487
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:43,340
Jaggu! Shera, hurry up!

488
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:50,220
Where's the key?

489
00:44:56,418 --> 00:44:57,581
C'mon, start already!

490
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:00,228
C'mon, Khalifa! Move it!

491
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:02,461
The women aren't coming.

492
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,622
Vakil, they need help.
They are all alone.

493
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,661
I am from your caste, I swear it.

494
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:15,466
From Ghardori village.
Indumati Tomar is my name.

495
00:45:16,224 --> 00:45:17,620
The cops are coming.

496
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:24,222
Vakil, let them aboard.

497
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:26,184
Come on!

498
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:28,303
Give me your hand.

499
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:37,325
The Holy Mother is unhappy.

500
00:47:39,363 --> 00:47:41,245
We have to seek her blessings.

501
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:45,854
After that we can
head back to the ravines.

502
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,328
Khalifa! Towards Pachrola.

503
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:53,651
Why Pachrola?

504
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,967
My village is not far from there.

505
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,487
'Hey, Bhoora.'

506
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,687
'Find someone from the Yadav caste
nearby and buy a goat.'

507
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:12,690
'Today we sacrifice
at Holy mother's altar.'

508
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:13,808
'Okay.'

509
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:36,894
Holy Mother blesses you!

510
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,136
Holy Mother blesses you!

511
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,378
Holy Mother blesses you!

512
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:50,533
Holy Mother blesses you!

513
00:48:58,054 --> 00:48:59,376
Dadda hasn't come?

514
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,057
You live in Holy Mother's shadow,
Brahmin Lord.

515
00:49:02,137 --> 00:49:03,741
I'm sure you know the truth.

516
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:07,499
Is it true, Lakhna

517
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:09,256
that the government is giving

518
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:10,739
a good deal to the rebels
who surrender?

519
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:16,380
Then, let's surrender.

520
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:18,781
This is no way to live.

521
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:21,417
Will the rest of the
gang let us go?

522
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,822
We'll put a bullet up
their bottoms if they don't.

523
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,382
If surrender is the way then
we have to do it carefully.

524
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,501
Nobody is thinking
straight right now.

525
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:33,820
They'll brand us deserters.

526
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:37,101
Let's get the girl
to the hospital in Dholpur.

527
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:40,742
Then we'll discuss this
calmly with Vakil Singh.

528
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:45,542
He'll come around.

529
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,062
Eat.

530
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,385
Look.

531
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:52,942
Don't you want to get better?

532
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:54,265
Eat it or I'll slap you.

533
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:57,224
Have it child.

534
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:59,830
This meal is a blessing
of the Holy Mother.

535
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,346
The bandit Phuliya
was even worse off

536
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:06,948
but once she had a
meal at the mother's temple

537
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,427
she roared like a tigress

538
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:15,272
and swore revenge
on Thakur Beni Ram.

539
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:17,909
Hear what he said? Now eat.

540
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:23,750
C'mon, girl,

541
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,831
get up.

542
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,552
Hurry.

543
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:33,108
C'mon girl, get up.

544
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,630
Let me go.

545
00:50:39,156 --> 00:50:40,671
Don't do anything to us.

546
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:45,676
Don't hurt us.

547
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,792
Tell them!

548
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:54,759
Get them.

549
00:50:59,594 --> 00:51:01,076
What's the matter?
- What happened?

550
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:05,636
You guys sent us the message.

551
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:12,435
You were right about her, Vakil.
This is a twisted tale.

552
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:14,799
Is she related to you?

553
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:17,559
She's my brother's wife.

554
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:19,997
And my nephew's mother.

555
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:22,998
Grab your land and woman by force.

556
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:24,721
Or they shall never be yours.

557
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:27,236
Take it.

558
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:30,240
Wallop her with this.

559
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:32,040
Come on.

560
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:34,998
No...

561
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:54,045
Get hold of them.

562
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,204
C'mon.
- No!

563
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,441
No...

564
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:01,807
Let her go this isn't her fault.

565
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:04,806
She is in great pain.
- Come.

566
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:07,444
He was raping her.

567
00:52:07,563 --> 00:52:08,968
So what?

568
00:52:09,445 --> 00:52:11,125
She is an untouchable.

569
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:14,166
He would've thrown
some money at her too.

570
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:16,606
We've fed her whole
family, haven't we?

571
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:18,246
Get out of my way.

572
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:20,488
This Jhirsa has killed my father.

573
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,855
She hasn't.

574
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:25,850
I killed him.

575
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:30,088
What are you saying?

576
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:32,288
Have you lost it?

577
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,848
This is absolutely crazy.

578
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,134
He was my father.

579
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:38,887
Your son's grandpa.

580
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:41,613
He was a sinner.

581
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:43,612
Lowlife scum.

582
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:46,970
Can't you see the state she is in?

583
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:49,531
She's 12 years old.

584
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,212
Son!

585
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,939
Hey.

586
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,541
Hold it.

587
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,138
They aren't going anywhere.

588
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,820
You rebels are like brothers.

589
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,699
We are the same caste too.

590
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:55,182
But this is about family.

591
00:53:55,383 --> 00:53:56,900
This is about justice.

592
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:01,785
You are our leader, Vakil.

593
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:03,344
Now deliver justice like one.

594
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:05,541
Look, Lakhna,

595
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,622
the girl was wronged
but she had her revenge.

596
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:11,990
Now the sons need to
avenge their father.

597
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,542
That's vengeance.

598
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:14,624
Not justice.

599
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:16,863
This is called justice
in the ravines.

600
00:54:17,144 --> 00:54:18,908
Blood for blood.

601
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:20,230
Let them go.

602
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:30,707
This is your leader's
justice and his command.

603
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:34,588
Then you are no longer our leader.

604
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:37,026
Think about it.

605
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,948
The ravines offer no
place to hide a deserter

606
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:43,393
I can hide from the gang.

607
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:45,547
How can I hide from myself?

608
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,512
Hey, Lakhna.

609
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,995
Let the women go if you
want your brother alive.

610
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:29,196
This isn't right.
- Shut up.

611
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:30,438
Let them go!

612
00:55:30,557 --> 00:55:31,596
Do what he says.

613
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:33,797
Put your weapons down.
- Natthi, get the kid.

614
00:55:33,877 --> 00:55:35,197
Stay calm...

615
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:36,439
Stay calm or I'll cut you.

616
00:55:36,558 --> 00:55:38,481
Let's go...
- Natthi.

617
00:55:39,397 --> 00:55:41,199
Move...

618
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:43,635
Put your guns down.

619
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,012
Sheetla...

620
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:45,728
Run, Lakhna...

621
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,249
You rascals!
- Run! Run!

622
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,168
Run! Run!

623
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,893
Hurry up! Come on!

624
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:03,129
Where can you go?

625
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:10,612
Breathe kiddo your brother
is right here with you.

626
00:57:10,971 --> 00:57:12,173
Sheetla...

627
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:13,774
Sheetla.

628
00:57:17,616 --> 00:57:19,133
What have you done?

629
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:20,294
Stop!

630
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:22,731
Where are you going, you scoundrel?

631
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:25,296
Who fired the first shot?

632
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:27,255
Who?

633
00:57:28,896 --> 00:57:31,373
Tell me or I'll have
your son for my brother.

634
00:57:31,453 --> 00:57:33,457
The fault is mine sir.
I fired the first shot.

635
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,376
Kill me, he didn't do anything.

636
00:57:35,576 --> 00:57:36,980
He didn't do anything.

637
00:57:40,017 --> 00:57:41,059
You Swine!

638
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,297
Where has he come from?

639
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,817
Why did you fire you swine?

640
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:56,061
I made a mistake.

641
00:57:57,417 --> 00:58:01,497
You're not a man bloody woman.

642
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:04,260
Look, Vakil.

643
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,502
We have a common enemy.

644
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:11,219
We can fight each other

645
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,583
or we can help each other find him.

646
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:16,828
Your call...

647
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:20,822
He won't come.

648
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:23,665
He's with us because
our father wanted it.

649
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:26,460
Now that father is dead, there's
no need to keep him.

650
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,464
Come, Lalla.

651
00:58:35,065 --> 00:58:36,863
Go to hell.

652
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,187
Let's go.

653
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:07,110
The bell is thunderous,
Brahmin lord.

654
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:09,229
Must weigh a quintal.

655
00:59:09,308 --> 00:59:11,593
Mother's blessing, Inspector.

656
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:15,272
I thought it was Man
Singh's blessing.

657
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,633
This is her court sir.

658
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:19,554
Anybody can walk in here.

659
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:23,873
And where did they go?
The ones that had come?

660
00:59:26,554 --> 00:59:28,951
I don't understand, sir.

661
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,594
Found these in your courtyard.

662
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:39,114
The bell can't be loud enough to
drown out the sound of gunfire.

663
00:59:47,277 --> 00:59:47,993
Sir.

664
00:59:50,157 --> 00:59:52,235
Sir, the pundit will die.

665
00:59:54,278 --> 00:59:55,238
Sir.

666
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:07,281
Is it all coming
back now, dear lord?

667
01:00:08,477 --> 01:00:10,960
There was an altercation.

668
01:00:11,438 --> 01:00:16,679
Someone fired a shot. And then
they escaped into the ravines.

669
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:19,319
That way.

670
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:22,767
That's all I know.

671
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,361
Will not lie on a Tuesday.

672
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:26,803
The priest is lying.

673
01:00:30,283 --> 01:00:32,919
He knows that Vakil
Singh's brother died.

674
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,401
He will be at the cremation
ground by the river.

675
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:47,444
"The curse of the balladeers."

676
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:53,167
"Resonated through the ravines."

677
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:59,045
"The trees shrivelled."

678
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:05,046
"The lakes dried up."

679
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,166
If I do not return before the
mourning period ends,

680
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,610
then perform my last
rites too, Pundit.

681
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:20,729
"The curse of the balladeers."

682
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:24,852
"Resonated through the ravines."

683
01:01:27,728 --> 01:01:31,571
"The trees shrivelled."

684
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:35,332
"The lakes dried up."

685
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:40,295
"But this dark heart of mine"

686
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,973
"won't listen, won't care."

687
01:01:46,732 --> 01:01:48,976
"No clouds and no seeds."

688
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:51,572
"Yet it wants to plough fields."

689
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,977
"Those who don't fall
in their death."

690
01:01:57,736 --> 01:02:02,014
"Fall to their blind obstinacy."

691
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:10,617
"The mice are preyed
on by the snake."

692
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,899
"The snake is preyed
on by the vulture."

693
01:02:38,578 --> 01:02:43,903
"Golden bird."

694
01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:48,383
"Golden bird."

695
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:56,464
"Golden bird..."

696
01:02:56,742 --> 01:03:01,143
"Golden bird."

697
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:06,626
"She has eyes with
a hundred charms."

698
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:13,263
"She's right before you
but disappears in a flash."

699
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:20,267
"Like a boat floating on sands."

700
01:03:21,707 --> 01:03:27,231
"Golden bird."

701
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:33,626
"Golden bird."

702
01:03:39,435 --> 01:03:43,230
"Hides the skies in
her belly button."

703
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:49,267
"Carries freedom on her wings."

704
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:54,193
"Vanquishes the night."

705
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:57,429
"Does such a magic."

706
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:02,395
"The wheel of time
spins backwards."

707
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:06,313
Be careful.

708
01:04:11,754 --> 01:04:14,477
The crocodile would have pulled
her in. She is a lucky girl.

709
01:04:19,994 --> 01:04:21,516
Sleep.

710
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:24,717
How do you know her?

711
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:28,434
She was born after my wedding.

712
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:32,196
Her mother cleaned
latrines in the village.

713
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:36,996
She must've been around two

714
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,439
when her mother died of cholera.

715
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,765
Since then

716
01:04:44,516 --> 01:04:48,079
she has grown up right
before my eyes.

717
01:04:49,482 --> 01:04:51,439
I named her too.

718
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,839
Sonchiriya.

719
01:04:55,439 --> 01:04:57,564
The one that we all seek

720
01:04:58,005 --> 01:04:59,562
but the one that we'll never find.

721
01:05:03,002 --> 01:05:04,844
Did you really kill
your father-in-law?

722
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:13,046
We are no one to judge
you or your actions.

723
01:05:17,367 --> 01:05:18,645
You are good people.

724
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:19,685
What?

725
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:20,686
All of you.

726
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:29,248
Do not forget, Ma'am,
we are outlaws.

727
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:32,726
Can't outlaws be good?

728
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:34,685
We became outlaws to escape from
the goodness of the world.

729
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:41,808
Outlaws have a bounty
on their head.

730
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:46,647
But it seems like you carry
some other burden.

731
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,851
It's a debt.

732
01:05:53,935 --> 01:05:56,048
Not any ordinary debt.

733
01:05:56,772 --> 01:05:58,450
It's a curse on our head.

734
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,495
What kind of curse?

735
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:04,773
A curse of a girl of five.

736
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:27,093
'Seven bandits killed in an ambush.
Police team awarded.'

737
01:06:27,173 --> 01:06:30,014
Ha! A rebel alive is
a pain in the neck.

738
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:32,778
Dead, he is worth a fortune.

739
01:06:33,537 --> 01:06:36,541
The newspaper men take
rubbish photos of us rebels.

740
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:40,499
This one looks like Natthi,
doesn't he? - Show, show.

741
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,096
Look, he's so pretty!

742
01:06:43,657 --> 01:06:44,898
Buzz off!

743
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,818
His moustache is not even
twirled upwards.

744
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:48,220
When I die,

745
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:51,419
the right side of my moustache
will be up sky's right bottom

746
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:53,858
and the left side up
sky's left bottom.

747
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,419
And your nose inside
the sky's hole, smelling it.

748
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,578
Is that so?

749
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:01,499
Why don't you put your nose
in mine and smell it.

750
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:03,343
Come here!

751
01:07:03,422 --> 01:07:04,342
Come here!

752
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:05,458
Come here!

753
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:08,822
Is that real?
- Yes.

754
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:11,463
So this is what Man Singh's
dreaded gang looks like.

755
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:16,343
Hey, Lakhna!
- Yes, Dadda!

756
01:07:16,424 --> 01:07:17,702
Stop them

757
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:19,664
or Chambal will stop fearing us.

758
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,781
The enemy's here, rebels beware!

759
01:07:22,863 --> 01:07:24,184
'Left Right Left'

760
01:07:24,263 --> 01:07:25,783
'Left Right Left'

761
01:07:25,902 --> 01:07:27,067
'Left Right Left'

762
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,063
Who is it?

763
01:07:29,543 --> 01:07:31,586
Dadda... Balkhandiya.

764
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:40,944
They knew we were coming.

765
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:48,070
This is rebel Man Singh's gang.

766
01:07:49,826 --> 01:07:52,587
There's no reason to be afraid.

767
01:07:54,106 --> 01:07:55,749
We know

768
01:07:56,748 --> 01:07:59,993
that Balkhandiya Gujjar is hiding
in this village.

769
01:08:01,267 --> 01:08:03,629
Today is an auspicious day.

770
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:08,949
We don't want to loot
or harm anyone.

771
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:13,271
All we want is Balkhandiya Gujjar

772
01:08:14,354 --> 01:08:17,711
who has killed 3 of our men.

773
01:08:19,034 --> 01:08:21,713
Hand him over to us

774
01:08:22,513 --> 01:08:24,912
and the auspicious
day will remain auspicious.

775
01:08:42,637 --> 01:08:44,074
Take cover!

776
01:08:44,274 --> 01:08:46,198
Run!

777
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,716
Hide!

778
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:49,435
Run! Run!

779
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:52,637
Rambir is hit!

780
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:56,358
Where are you hiding, you coward!

781
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,120
'Balkhandiya is like our brother.'

782
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,998
'He has done a lot
for our community.'

783
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:08,080
'It is best you leave the village,
Man Singh.'

784
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:09,921
Lakhna, stop!

785
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,078
Stop, Lakhna!

786
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:16,040
We're here only for Balkhandiya.

787
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:18,243
Vakil,

788
01:09:18,324 --> 01:09:20,559
keep a watch here with 10 men.

789
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:23,440
The rest divide into small groups

790
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:25,645
and search the entire village.

791
01:09:25,804 --> 01:09:26,767
Move!

792
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:33,927
Khalifa!

793
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,042
Lakhna, look in.

794
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:50,611
Hurry up to the room upstairs!

795
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,885
And do not come out. Go!

796
01:09:58,452 --> 01:10:00,171
Move, Move, Move!

797
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,970
Balak Ram! Keep on moving ahead.

798
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:05,452
Quick! Quick!

799
01:10:05,813 --> 01:10:07,772
Hey, Balkhandiya!

800
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:11,252
Don't be shy like a newlywed bride!

801
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:13,534
Come out!

802
01:10:24,811 --> 01:10:26,695
Go, go, look.

803
01:10:34,138 --> 01:10:35,697
What did you see?

804
01:10:35,855 --> 01:10:37,340
Go there and look.

805
01:10:37,422 --> 01:10:39,581
Natthi! Move, move.

806
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:17,869
What is it?

807
01:11:31,827 --> 01:11:33,269
Catch him, Catch him!

808
01:12:13,357 --> 01:12:14,995
Dadda!

809
01:13:28,522 --> 01:13:29,805
Dadda!

810
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,561
Bhoora, stay here!

811
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:34,324
Dadda!

812
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:36,403
Dadda!

813
01:13:36,601 --> 01:13:40,363
They shot the children!

814
01:13:42,963 --> 01:13:44,163
Dadda!

815
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:49,724
What happened, Dadda?

816
01:13:49,887 --> 01:13:50,926
Lord Rama!

817
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:55,170
Lord Rama!

818
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:57,565
Corpse!

819
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:01,048
It is a corpse.

820
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,089
It is a corpse.

821
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,326
Lord Rama!

822
01:14:12,968 --> 01:14:14,732
Dadda!
- Yes.

823
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:16,929
We have to leave.

824
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:22,210
We have to leave now!

825
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:23,330
Get them!

826
01:14:23,408 --> 01:14:25,530
Are you guys deaf! Hurry up!

827
01:14:26,415 --> 01:14:27,614
Let's go, Lakhna.

828
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:28,730
Move!
- Come on out!

829
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:29,851
Let's go, Lakhna.

830
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:31,452
Hurry up. Come on out!

831
01:14:31,611 --> 01:14:33,012
Let's go, Dadda!

832
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:36,972
Let's go. Let's go.

833
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:40,652
Come, Come!

834
01:14:40,735 --> 01:14:42,216
Hey, Vakil!

835
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:44,652
All the villagers have gathered!

836
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,576
Come out fast!

837
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:12,387
Let him go.

838
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,305
Let him go.

839
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:25,194
Once there was Lord Rama
and his wife, the Goddess Sita.

840
01:16:26,868 --> 01:16:30,549
Their love for each other
knew no bounds.

841
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,474
And then...

842
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:36,954
The evil King Ravana kidnapped
Mother Sita.

843
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,194
Eventually Lord Rama rescued her,

844
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:42,830
but he could never
accept her again.

845
01:16:43,352 --> 01:16:44,994
And you will?

846
01:16:48,118 --> 01:16:51,593
Your wife has run away with the
outlaws of her own free will.

847
01:16:52,993 --> 01:16:55,715
We don't want to accept her back,

848
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:58,233
but to punish her.

849
01:17:00,756 --> 01:17:01,872
Wow!

850
01:17:02,794 --> 01:17:04,277
Father gropes in the dark

851
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:07,236
while the son's a
bloody power station.

852
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,638
What happened?
- No information, sir.

853
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:13,396
What?
- Nothing, sir.

854
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:16,078
This command

855
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,198
goes out to the
entire Mallah community.

856
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,196
We know

857
01:17:21,276 --> 01:17:23,519
that despite our warnings,

858
01:17:23,599 --> 01:17:28,162
you help the bandits
cross the river.

859
01:17:28,441 --> 01:17:33,917
If you get any information about
Man Singh's Gang,

860
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,197
then report it to the nearest
police station.

861
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,440
'If anyone fails to do so, then the
consequences'

862
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,402
'will be suffered
by the entire community.'

863
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:46,601
Where did all the Mallah go?

864
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:48,480
Let's check in the village.

865
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:49,762
Move on!

866
01:17:54,922 --> 01:17:56,283
Where could he have gone?

867
01:17:57,243 --> 01:17:58,483
Dholpur.

868
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:00,365
To surrender.

869
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:03,122
There are two ways to Dholpur.

870
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:05,605
One through Naroda

871
01:18:05,885 --> 01:18:07,368
and the other Kasloi.
- No.

872
01:18:08,524 --> 01:18:11,845
Lakhna knows that Mallah gang
is camped near Naroda.

873
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:15,248
If he goes there, Phuliya will not
spare him.

874
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:16,404
Means?

875
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,005
He will take the other route

876
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:21,446
through Lachhu's village.

877
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:27,490
Lakhna struck a deal with
Dholpur Police with Lachhu's help.

878
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:31,771
Peaceful surrender in exchange
for Man Singh's life.

879
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,929
And Lachhu will accompany
Lakhna for the surrender.

880
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,292
Relax. Nothing happened!

881
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,411
Fired a shot to scare her.

882
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:47,613
She wasn't letting
us take the oars.

883
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:50,493
Phuliya will avenge us!
- Shut up!

884
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:54,535
The cops have picked up all
the Mallah men.

885
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:57,652
We have to row the boats ourselves.

886
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,009
Where are we going though?

887
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:01,534
Kasloi.

888
01:19:01,692 --> 01:19:02,775
Naroda.

889
01:19:03,334 --> 01:19:05,133
Steer towards Naroda.

890
01:19:06,695 --> 01:19:07,772
But Lachhu is in Kasloi.

891
01:19:07,852 --> 01:19:08,974
Lachhu won't do a thing for us.

892
01:19:10,098 --> 01:19:11,176
Nor will anybody else.

893
01:19:13,093 --> 01:19:17,336
Everybody knows that helping us
makes them an enemy of Gujjar.

894
01:19:17,657 --> 01:19:19,256
And Beni Ram in Naroda
will help us?

895
01:19:19,336 --> 01:19:20,295
I said...

896
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:23,895
Whatever has to be done
has to be done by us alone.

897
01:19:26,342 --> 01:19:29,019
The Mallah gang is camped
near Naroda right now.

898
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:30,817
So?

899
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,378
Will Phuliya spare our lives?

900
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:36,576
Phuliya's feud is with Beni Ram,
not with all Thakurs.

901
01:19:37,257 --> 01:19:38,500
Say, Mallah?

902
01:19:38,896 --> 01:19:40,258
Am I right?

903
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:43,658
You must know

904
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:46,061
she is your caste sister after all.

905
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,102
Halt!

906
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,061
Who goes there?

907
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:59,059
Lakhna the rebel is here!

908
01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:08,262
Had told Man Singh

909
01:20:09,225 --> 01:20:10,624
to take the guns.

910
01:20:11,021 --> 01:20:12,744
Did I or not?

911
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:17,104
Who are they?

912
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:19,303
The ones we kidnapped.

913
01:20:19,783 --> 01:20:21,508
It was the little girl's wedding

914
01:20:22,187 --> 01:20:23,664
and she's her aunt.

915
01:20:25,026 --> 01:20:26,467
And the rest of the gang?

916
01:20:26,984 --> 01:20:28,749
It's not safe to be all together,

917
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:30,985
so we split into small groups.

918
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:35,989
Vakil allowed you
to take the women?

919
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:37,748
Won't hide anything
from you Beni Ram.

920
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:41,469
We have decided to separate
from Vakil Singh.

921
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,591
And so you ran away
with the kidnapped.

922
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:49,909
The king dies
and his empire collapses.

923
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:58,910
Their family is responsible for
Man Singh's death.

924
01:21:00,914 --> 01:21:02,591
What will be the punishment for
ratting to the cops?

925
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:10,792
Dholpur?

926
01:21:11,473 --> 01:21:12,432
Yes.

927
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,393
We have to leave tonight.

928
01:21:15,073 --> 01:21:19,194
Dhani Ram has taken the car
to Morena to meet the MP.

929
01:21:19,752 --> 01:21:20,915
Will be back tomorrow evening.

930
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:22,515
The mutton is delicious.

931
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:27,395
Any other car in the village?

932
01:21:28,877 --> 01:21:30,235
Do something, please.

933
01:21:30,835 --> 01:21:32,398
The kid needs to get to a hospital.

934
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,075
If something happens to her,
we won't get the ransom.

935
01:21:35,835 --> 01:21:37,155
Do something, Beni Ram.

936
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:38,836
Once we get the ransom

937
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:40,799
we'll form a new gang

938
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:42,596
which will be of help to you.

939
01:21:42,676 --> 01:21:44,639
30 of you couldn't
do a thing for me

940
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,238
then what good are 3 of you?

941
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:52,757
Eat something, child.

942
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:56,403
It's late in the night

943
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,561
and the roads are no good.

944
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:02,882
Best that you guys
sleep here tonight.

945
01:22:03,846 --> 01:22:05,479
I will organise another car
in the morning.

946
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:07,882
Hey, Radiya.

947
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,921
Make beds for the
men on the terrace

948
01:22:10,122 --> 01:22:12,842
and for the women in
the small room. - Yes.

949
01:22:20,047 --> 01:22:22,404
Hey, girl wake up.

950
01:22:22,643 --> 01:22:25,565
It's turmeric milk
you will have to drink it.

951
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:28,088
Get up.

952
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,684
Madam, everything hurts.

953
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,809
Don't drink it then. Let it be.

954
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:39,087
What about a lemon juice?

955
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:43,696
What did I tell you?

956
01:23:45,338 --> 01:23:47,099
Outlaws can be good people too.

957
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,859
Hey, Khalifa!

958
01:23:59,937 --> 01:24:02,303
Will they serve us
mutton in the jail?

959
01:24:02,384 --> 01:24:03,818
Oh, sure. Why not?

960
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:05,659
Mutton.

961
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:08,100
Chicken.

962
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,939
Rice pudding.

963
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,179
And the jailer will send his
daughter on Saturdays.

964
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,101
Why are you joking?

965
01:24:20,941 --> 01:24:22,620
Who started it?

966
01:24:23,902 --> 01:24:26,108
Mutton, my foot!

967
01:24:27,381 --> 01:24:29,342
Oh my mother!

968
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:32,223
How will we get past
14 years in jail?

969
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,142
Prison can't be worse
than the ravines.

970
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:39,906
True that.

971
01:24:41,268 --> 01:24:43,464
Walking 30 miles a day.

972
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:45,987
No time to sleep, nowhere to shit.

973
01:24:47,062 --> 01:24:48,947
A piece of dry bread is a feast

974
01:24:49,028 --> 01:24:52,064
else keep marching on
an empty stomach.

975
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:04,952
What will you do once
you've served time?

976
01:25:07,707 --> 01:25:08,831
I'll do agriculture.

977
01:25:12,349 --> 01:25:13,634
By riding on a camel.

978
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:18,950
Just like my father.

979
01:25:21,154 --> 01:25:22,549
And I'll have a woman.

980
01:25:24,393 --> 01:25:26,951
Not like my mother though,
she was nasty.

981
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:30,152
The way she abused my dad.

982
01:27:15,168 --> 01:27:16,689
Want to smoke?

983
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,931
Yeah, Lakhna brother.

984
01:27:19,774 --> 01:27:20,967
Come then.

985
01:27:24,611 --> 01:27:27,332
So what's a rebel's life like?

986
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,968
It's alright.

987
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,693
Never any mutton to eat is all.

988
01:27:34,773 --> 01:27:35,892
Is it?

989
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,611
If someone wants to join a gang

990
01:27:40,091 --> 01:27:43,018
only asking for my knowledge
what should one do?

991
01:27:48,254 --> 01:27:49,372
No big deal.

992
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:50,936
Just...

993
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:54,893
Just memorise this mantra.

994
01:27:54,976 --> 01:27:55,895
Mantra?

995
01:27:57,975 --> 01:28:01,455
The enemy's here, rebels beware!

996
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,463
Hold him!

997
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,783
Teach the wretch a lesson.

998
01:28:58,983 --> 01:29:00,584
You wretches!

999
01:29:05,545 --> 01:29:06,705
Let go of me!

1000
01:29:06,783 --> 01:29:09,468
Hey Radiya, they're taking
the boss away.

1001
01:29:09,909 --> 01:29:11,866
Get off me!
- Hey!

1002
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:13,545
You'll die, wretches!

1003
01:29:13,626 --> 01:29:16,229
Just pin him down.

1004
01:29:20,669 --> 01:29:22,868
You rascals!

1005
01:29:28,508 --> 01:29:30,147
Hold him down.

1006
01:29:30,627 --> 01:29:32,951
Lakhna! Lakhna!

1007
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:35,149
Don't let him go.

1008
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,354
Grab him, Khalifa!

1009
01:29:51,631 --> 01:29:53,952
This will teach them a lesson.

1010
01:29:59,314 --> 01:30:00,475
Open the door!

1011
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:03,432
Open the door.
- Hey!

1012
01:30:03,513 --> 01:30:05,715
Come on! Come on!

1013
01:30:05,994 --> 01:30:07,876
Yes, get that.

1014
01:30:08,393 --> 01:30:09,953
Hey... Hey...

1015
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:10,994
Let's go, Lakhna.

1016
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,517
You leave. I'll stop them.

1017
01:30:12,598 --> 01:30:13,916
Lakhna!
- Go!

1018
01:30:16,275 --> 01:30:17,475
Open the door.

1019
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:31,678
When a vermin is your boss,
you eat dirt.

1020
01:30:33,759 --> 01:30:34,679
Lakhna!

1021
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:42,679
Lakhna has won.

1022
01:30:42,919 --> 01:30:43,720
What did I say?

1023
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:49,640
"Lakhna comes victorious
after killing them all."

1024
01:30:49,837 --> 01:30:55,123
"Lakhna comes victorious
after killing them all."

1025
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:03,921
Hey!

1026
01:31:06,322 --> 01:31:07,846
Natthi!

1027
01:31:09,763 --> 01:31:11,603
You piece of shit!

1028
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:15,648
Lakhna!

1029
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:20,766
Lakhna, don't!

1030
01:31:22,005 --> 01:31:24,049
Lakhna, no!

1031
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:26,085
He will die.

1032
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:06,412
We'll have to go back..

1033
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:08,650
What happened Lakhna?
- Natthi had said

1034
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:10,855
his moustache be twirled
upwards when he dies.

1035
01:32:11,016 --> 01:32:13,012
We'll have to go back.
- Lakhna!

1036
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:14,893
What's wrong with you?

1037
01:32:16,572 --> 01:32:18,858
They'll print his photo
in the newspaper.

1038
01:32:19,817 --> 01:32:21,533
We will be cursed.

1039
01:32:21,814 --> 01:32:22,774
Lakhna!
- No!

1040
01:32:26,175 --> 01:32:27,896
What wrong did Natthi do?

1041
01:32:31,097 --> 01:32:32,257
It's over.

1042
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,018
It's all over.

1043
01:32:37,457 --> 01:32:38,618
Dadda, Natthi.

1044
01:32:40,295 --> 01:32:41,897
All over.

1045
01:32:42,861 --> 01:32:44,818
I can't do this anymore.

1046
01:32:45,256 --> 01:32:46,820
Hey!
- Lakhna!

1047
01:32:50,822 --> 01:32:51,739
Don't move.

1048
01:32:58,664 --> 01:33:00,580
What happened to you

1049
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,060
could've happened to anyone.

1050
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,342
The debt that you
carry on your head

1051
01:33:10,703 --> 01:33:11,862
throw it away.

1052
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:32,585
That is Lachhu's house.

1053
01:34:04,512 --> 01:34:05,550
Lachhu!

1054
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:12,991
Where's Lakhna?

1055
01:34:26,632 --> 01:34:27,592
Quiet.

1056
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:30,712
Why do you cry?

1057
01:34:30,913 --> 01:34:32,238
What happened?

1058
01:34:33,319 --> 01:34:35,515
Your father lived long enough.

1059
01:34:36,836 --> 01:34:39,597
Now perform his last rites
as per the holy books.

1060
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:41,560
The priest will visit

1061
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:44,234
and read the scriptures.

1062
01:34:46,515 --> 01:34:49,360
'The body is but a vehicle.'

1063
01:34:49,879 --> 01:34:51,677
And all the other bullshit.

1064
01:34:55,642 --> 01:34:57,881
Man Singh had no such luck.

1065
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:04,762
Where's Lakhna?

1066
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:08,438
I don't know, Vakil.

1067
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:13,442
Answer, you swine!

1068
01:35:16,523 --> 01:35:17,643
Tell me!

1069
01:35:18,721 --> 01:35:20,283
Where's that coward?

1070
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:21,882
I don't know.

1071
01:35:28,925 --> 01:35:30,243
Where is Lakhna?

1072
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:32,565
Where?

1073
01:35:33,723 --> 01:35:35,207
Let me go!

1074
01:35:42,687 --> 01:35:44,448
Tell me where he is?
- I don't know.

1075
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,444
Leave me!

1076
01:35:51,489 --> 01:35:53,166
You want to shoot me?

1077
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:55,247
Go ahead then!

1078
01:35:55,969 --> 01:35:57,646
Better to die of a bullet
than of a curse.

1079
01:35:57,846 --> 01:35:59,450
My son!

1080
01:35:59,531 --> 01:36:00,608
Tell me, Lachhu.

1081
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,448
Or else your whole family
will burn on the pyre tonight.

1082
01:36:03,887 --> 01:36:05,049
Son!

1083
01:36:05,566 --> 01:36:06,769
Son!

1084
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:11,490
Say!
Did you rat to the cops or not?

1085
01:36:13,972 --> 01:36:16,692
Did you?
- I was going to.

1086
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:23,456
Then?
- I couldn't betray Man Singh.

1087
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:26,971
He has done so much for me.

1088
01:36:27,773 --> 01:36:29,613
I told him the truth.

1089
01:36:36,533 --> 01:36:37,374
What?

1090
01:36:37,532 --> 01:36:44,771
"Rebels."

1091
01:36:44,853 --> 01:36:47,137
There's a wedding in Brahmpuri
the jeweller's daughter.

1092
01:36:47,658 --> 01:36:50,376
He's giving a kilo
of gold as dowry.

1093
01:36:50,655 --> 01:36:52,095
And cash too.

1094
01:36:53,659 --> 01:36:55,261
You sure about this?

1095
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:57,536
Yes, Dadda.

1096
01:37:08,179 --> 01:37:09,539
Hey, Lachhu

1097
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:11,579
is there something you want to say?

1098
01:37:14,462 --> 01:37:15,660
What happened?

1099
01:37:16,577 --> 01:37:18,862
My father is in trouble, Dadda.

1100
01:37:19,781 --> 01:37:21,740
The cops have locked him up

1101
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,899
and they're torturing him.

1102
01:37:25,743 --> 01:37:27,185
They've told me

1103
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:30,342
they'll let him go only if
I give you this information.

1104
01:37:34,626 --> 01:37:35,745
Get up.

1105
01:37:36,703 --> 01:37:37,703
Get up!

1106
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:41,623
Please don't go, Dadda
Gujjar has set a trap.

1107
01:37:42,786 --> 01:37:44,022
And your father?

1108
01:37:44,902 --> 01:37:46,704
Will the cops let him go?

1109
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:49,787
Won't they kill him in custody?

1110
01:37:52,505 --> 01:37:55,705
The gang owes a debt to Gujjar.

1111
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,105
We have to pay it back.

1112
01:38:02,549 --> 01:38:06,110
He deserves his chance.
- No, Dadda.

1113
01:38:06,189 --> 01:38:08,506
Don't want the sin of
betrayal on my head.

1114
01:38:08,587 --> 01:38:10,986
You haven't betrayed us.

1115
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,109
On the contrary, you've
done us a favour.

1116
01:38:16,547 --> 01:38:18,668
Everyone will die, Dadda.

1117
01:38:21,874 --> 01:38:25,029
A rebel's job is to
perform his Dharma

1118
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:27,950
rest is up to Holy Mother.

1119
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:33,993
If she wants us to come to her,

1120
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,872
our debts will be paid.

1121
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:47,193
He made me take an oath.

1122
01:38:48,953 --> 01:38:51,073
To get father home

1123
01:38:52,838 --> 01:38:54,357
and not utter a word
about this to anyone.

1124
01:38:56,476 --> 01:38:57,796
But

1125
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:00,554
father died anyway.

1126
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,678
Such treachery?

1127
01:39:30,839 --> 01:39:32,846
That's Man Singh for you.

1128
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,641
He pays off his debt

1129
01:39:41,602 --> 01:39:43,961
and leaves us stumbling
in these ravines.

1130
01:39:49,923 --> 01:39:52,324
Well done, my treacherous Dadda!

1131
01:41:20,014 --> 01:41:23,820
It was my love for this
uniform that stopped me.

1132
01:41:26,218 --> 01:41:27,859
Else it's impossible
that someone raises

1133
01:41:28,017 --> 01:41:29,939
a hand on you and I do nothing.

1134
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:34,378
That too this Gujjar.

1135
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:39,102
Let it go, dear nephew.

1136
01:41:41,419 --> 01:41:45,784
The skin is the real uniform.

1137
01:41:46,946 --> 01:41:52,102
And our skin is that of a Thakur.

1138
01:41:53,862 --> 01:41:58,423
Have as many stars
on your uniform as you like,

1139
01:41:59,144 --> 01:42:02,505
the skin comes naked.

1140
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,905
It leaves the earth as it comes.

1141
01:42:08,062 --> 01:42:14,584
And this Inspector
knows this well enough.

1142
01:42:29,989 --> 01:42:31,787
What do you think?

1143
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:38,109
By exacting vengeance and
punishing your mother...

1144
01:42:42,352 --> 01:42:44,028
How will you feel?

1145
01:42:49,594 --> 01:42:51,151
People will laugh at
us in the village.

1146
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:54,790
Father is already a joke.

1147
01:42:55,313 --> 01:42:56,952
Now mother too.

1148
01:42:58,274 --> 01:43:00,351
'Shots fired in village Naroda
in Morena district.'

1149
01:43:00,431 --> 01:43:03,591
'All precincts stay on alert.
Bandits are on the move.'

1150
01:43:03,673 --> 01:43:07,274
Enough rest! Move it everyone!

1151
01:43:17,595 --> 01:43:19,073
How far?

1152
01:43:19,915 --> 01:43:20,875
Hey, Mallah?

1153
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,678
Hold her.

1154
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,878
Hey! Stop!

1155
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:52,040
Hey! Hey, stop!

1156
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,199
Hey, listen.

1157
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:55,519
Stop! Stop!

1158
01:43:55,598 --> 01:43:56,800
Listen to me!

1159
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,959
Don't hit them.

1160
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:00,924
I'm on your side. Let me go.

1161
01:44:01,123 --> 01:44:02,961
Don't hit him!
- Hey!

1162
01:44:03,122 --> 01:44:04,163
Please, stop.

1163
01:44:04,802 --> 01:44:06,202
Why are you beating them?

1164
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,527
Let him go! Please!

1165
01:44:08,725 --> 01:44:10,761
Stop!
- Help!

1166
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:12,844
Hey!

1167
01:44:13,602 --> 01:44:15,042
What's your name?

1168
01:44:18,162 --> 01:44:19,522
Lakhna Singh.

1169
01:44:19,806 --> 01:44:21,683
From Man Singh's gang.

1170
01:44:22,243 --> 01:44:24,248
We heard there were 3 of you?

1171
01:44:25,566 --> 01:44:28,047
The third one died
bringing your gift.

1172
01:44:29,087 --> 01:44:32,850
When your boss was alive,
he didn't do a thing for Phuliya.

1173
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:35,687
What gift are you bringing
me then, Thakur?

1174
01:45:40,777 --> 01:45:42,057
Let's go.

1175
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:45,096
Vishnu Mallah?

1176
01:45:45,257 --> 01:45:46,777
Won't we get anything from
Phuliya in return?

1177
01:45:49,857 --> 01:45:51,020
Let's go!

1178
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:52,298
Listen.

1179
01:45:52,936 --> 01:45:54,579
We have to take this child
to a hospital.

1180
01:45:54,738 --> 01:45:57,136
There are people out to kill her
and the STF is after us.

1181
01:45:58,901 --> 01:46:00,379
Just help us get to Dholpur.

1182
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:05,221
You are from a Thakur gang
and yet Phuliya spares your life.

1183
01:46:05,461 --> 01:46:06,825
Isn't that enough?

1184
01:46:14,744 --> 01:46:17,863
You sought justice now
learn how to deliver justice too.

1185
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,983
Hey, Phuliya!

1186
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:23,066
Look at the condition
of this little girl.

1187
01:46:23,626 --> 01:46:25,542
She has suffered the
same torment that you had.

1188
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:29,425
Who did this to her?

1189
01:46:30,345 --> 01:46:33,786
The one who had done it is dead.

1190
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:43,827
Sir! Sir,
there is news from Naroda.

1191
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:48,146
There were 3 bandits they've
kidnapped the smuggler Beni Ram.

1192
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:53,908
They will try to cross the
border after such a big job.

1193
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:57,226
They are in the
ravines near Dholpur.

1194
01:46:57,508 --> 01:46:58,590
'What's your plan?'

1195
01:46:58,669 --> 01:47:00,068
'Over.'

1196
01:47:00,388 --> 01:47:04,510
We'll have to block all paths
between Naroda and Dholpur.

1197
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:10,153
'I will need men from
all precincts nearby. Over.'

1198
01:47:13,509 --> 01:47:15,229
What will you do after
reaching the hospital?

1199
01:47:19,151 --> 01:47:20,871
Will your husband spare you?

1200
01:47:24,794 --> 01:47:26,755
You should join my gang.

1201
01:47:29,954 --> 01:47:31,631
Why do you laugh?

1202
01:47:32,713 --> 01:47:35,033
You've learnt how to kill sinners.

1203
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:37,635
You're already a rebel.

1204
01:47:37,835 --> 01:47:39,593
This is a Mallah gang.

1205
01:47:40,116 --> 01:47:42,039
And I'm a Thakur by caste.

1206
01:47:46,395 --> 01:47:48,636
You don't get it, do you?

1207
01:47:49,398 --> 01:47:51,836
Brahmins, Thakurs,
Baniyas, Shudras...

1208
01:47:52,235 --> 01:47:53,917
These castes are
to categorise the men.

1209
01:47:56,276 --> 01:47:59,318
Women are a different
caste altogether.

1210
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:03,037
Different from all.

1211
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:05,602
Beneath them all.

1212
01:48:07,998 --> 01:48:08,799
Hey!

1213
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:14,439
The valley begins up ahead
Two men go ahead.

1214
01:48:23,681 --> 01:48:24,643
Hold on.

1215
01:48:24,923 --> 01:48:28,401
They are scouts. The gang
must be behind them.

1216
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:48,245
Sir!

1217
01:48:48,364 --> 01:48:51,565
Near the Sikarwar ruins.
A couple of miles off Dholpur.

1218
01:48:56,286 --> 01:48:57,126
Yes.

1219
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:59,127
Drag those animals into the fort.

1220
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:02,048
Keep them surrounded until
we reach there. - Yes, sir.

1221
01:49:02,325 --> 01:49:05,807
I'm sending in reinforcements
as soon as possible.

1222
01:49:06,086 --> 01:49:08,572
Listen! We divide into 2 groups.

1223
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:10,647
First, we will fire from here.

1224
01:49:10,728 --> 01:49:13,126
And when they run in your
direction, you fire. - Yes, sir.

1225
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:16,972
And remember, we have to
drag them into the ruins.

1226
01:49:18,087 --> 01:49:21,690
And listen, none of them
should get away.

1227
01:49:35,252 --> 01:49:36,573
Just a little longer, child.

1228
01:49:37,092 --> 01:49:38,694
She's losing breath.

1229
01:49:38,774 --> 01:49:40,616
Hey, hold this.

1230
01:49:41,213 --> 01:49:43,494
What happened, kiddo?

1231
01:49:43,814 --> 01:49:47,456
Don't waste any time.
Dholpur is not far.

1232
01:49:47,696 --> 01:49:49,054
Give me some water.

1233
01:49:51,135 --> 01:49:52,454
Up there, there...

1234
01:49:53,611 --> 01:49:54,855
Police!

1235
01:49:55,377 --> 01:49:57,454
Let's go!

1236
01:49:58,615 --> 01:50:00,298
Go, go, go.

1237
01:50:01,576 --> 01:50:02,538
Run, run!

1238
01:50:07,777 --> 01:50:09,255
Run, run!

1239
01:50:09,817 --> 01:50:11,942
Keep running.

1240
01:50:12,817 --> 01:50:14,938
Pace up! Run!

1241
01:50:20,342 --> 01:50:22,820
We're being shot at from
both directions.

1242
01:50:23,181 --> 01:50:25,579
Which way to go?

1243
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,621
Surround the girl!

1244
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:34,742
Look there!

1245
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,980
Take her away.
- Go, go...

1246
01:50:38,822 --> 01:50:40,222
Cover them.

1247
01:50:41,864 --> 01:50:44,064
Move faster!

1248
01:51:27,269 --> 01:51:29,029
Get back.
- Hide.

1249
01:51:32,147 --> 01:51:34,431
Watch out! Who is there?

1250
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,351
Who are you guys?

1251
01:51:37,554 --> 01:51:39,591
Madhya Pradesh Police, who else?

1252
01:51:39,831 --> 01:51:41,833
But that's us too. Which precinct?

1253
01:51:41,912 --> 01:51:43,551
Hey! Watch it.

1254
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:47,033
You're talking to the
Deputy Captain of Sheopuri.

1255
01:51:48,031 --> 01:51:52,151
Who's your officer? Which precinct?
You look like bandits.

1256
01:51:52,352 --> 01:51:56,913
No, sir. Govind Bhadoriya,
Station head, Kichni.

1257
01:51:57,914 --> 01:52:00,676
This area doesn't
fall under Kichni.

1258
01:52:01,838 --> 01:52:03,315
What are you guys doing here?

1259
01:52:03,476 --> 01:52:05,914
Sir, these rascals are lying.
I bet they're bandits.

1260
01:52:05,997 --> 01:52:07,196
No, sir!

1261
01:52:07,634 --> 01:52:10,996
HQ messaged us on the wireless

1262
01:52:11,075 --> 01:52:16,077
that the Mallah and Man Singh gangs
are surrounded at Sikarwar ruins.

1263
01:52:16,357 --> 01:52:19,437
We've been ordered to lend support.
That's why.

1264
01:52:40,682 --> 01:52:42,283
What's with the long faces?

1265
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,159
They're just 8-10 of them.

1266
01:52:45,403 --> 01:52:47,360
We'll get rid of them in no time.

1267
01:52:58,283 --> 01:52:59,362
Oh, dear!

1268
01:53:01,406 --> 01:53:03,723
They've blocked both the exits.

1269
01:53:04,443 --> 01:53:05,966
But they're not moving forward.

1270
01:53:06,084 --> 01:53:07,484
Rascals!

1271
01:53:07,884 --> 01:53:09,843
They're waiting
for reinforcements.

1272
01:53:11,244 --> 01:53:12,086
Open your eyes!

1273
01:53:13,048 --> 01:53:14,045
Rascals!

1274
01:53:21,848 --> 01:53:22,726
What are you doing?

1275
01:53:23,167 --> 01:53:25,208
Hey! I will shoot!

1276
01:53:58,573 --> 01:53:59,574
Oh, girl!

1277
01:54:03,653 --> 01:54:07,053
Why are you hiding?
Impotent rascals!

1278
01:54:07,896 --> 01:54:09,174
Throw away the gun!

1279
01:54:10,131 --> 01:54:11,733
Get a skirt for yourself!

1280
01:54:12,053 --> 01:54:14,295
Tell me your waist size!
I will get it stitched!

1281
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:15,858
Rascals!
- You tramp!

1282
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,815
She's not breathing.

1283
01:54:26,015 --> 01:54:27,457
Do something, please.

1284
01:54:27,535 --> 01:54:28,734
Don't worry. It won't take long.

1285
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:48,143
Hey, Phuliya.

1286
01:54:49,658 --> 01:54:52,460
Why did you get
involved in their mess?

1287
01:54:53,023 --> 01:54:56,066
Go to hell, Inspector!

1288
01:55:03,584 --> 01:55:06,702
Get closer to the ruins.
Shoot at the bandits.

1289
01:55:07,624 --> 01:55:11,146
There's a woman and a child in
there they shouldn't be harmed.

1290
01:55:12,624 --> 01:55:13,783
Move forward.

1291
01:55:30,906 --> 01:55:32,065
Bloody swine!

1292
01:55:43,987 --> 01:55:45,506
Dear!

1293
01:56:18,635 --> 01:56:22,196
"Golden bird."

1294
01:56:24,232 --> 01:56:28,273
"Golden bird."

1295
01:56:29,475 --> 01:56:34,876
"Golden bird."

1296
01:56:35,195 --> 01:56:39,638
"Golden bird."

1297
01:56:40,715 --> 01:56:44,398
"She has eyes with
a hundred charms."

1298
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:49,718
"She's right before you
but disappears in a flash."

1299
01:56:51,717 --> 01:56:56,120
"She has eyes with
a hundred charms."

1300
01:56:57,241 --> 01:57:00,960
"She's right before you
but disappears in a flash."

1301
01:57:02,759 --> 01:57:06,960
"Like a boat floating on sands."

1302
01:57:08,199 --> 01:57:13,043
"Golden bird."

1303
01:57:13,883 --> 01:57:18,803
"Golden bird."

1304
01:57:39,325 --> 01:57:41,409
The enemy's here, rebels beware!

1305
01:57:52,808 --> 01:57:54,169
Take cover.

1306
01:57:54,289 --> 01:57:56,050
Rascals!

1307
01:58:06,009 --> 01:58:07,488
Cover me!

1308
01:58:13,215 --> 01:58:16,571
Jaggi, you okay?
- It's just a scratch.

1309
01:58:24,294 --> 01:58:26,933
Lakhna! The path is clear.

1310
01:58:27,174 --> 01:58:29,334
Leave now with the girls.

1311
01:58:29,413 --> 01:58:31,695
And you guys?
- No, Lakhna, you leave.

1312
01:58:31,895 --> 01:58:32,936
Don't worry.

1313
01:58:33,494 --> 01:58:35,578
I knew all along that
we won't make it to surrender.

1314
01:58:36,979 --> 01:58:38,697
I could see it in your eyes.

1315
01:58:39,134 --> 01:58:41,574
I played along for Natthi's sake.

1316
01:58:42,213 --> 01:58:43,615
That swine!

1317
01:58:46,455 --> 01:58:48,656
Go! Go! Go!

1318
01:58:49,135 --> 01:58:50,698
Hey!

1319
01:58:52,821 --> 01:58:53,698
Phuliya!

1320
01:58:53,775 --> 01:58:56,937
I will always remember you.
- Remember my offer, too.

1321
01:58:58,337 --> 01:59:00,541
Give cover fire to Lakhna.

1322
01:59:01,498 --> 01:59:03,019
Run!

1323
01:59:04,978 --> 01:59:05,938
Get behind the mound,

1324
01:59:06,017 --> 01:59:07,821
Lakhna!

1325
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,222
C'mon, Vakil!

1326
01:59:16,664 --> 01:59:18,260
Let's go.

1327
01:59:22,383 --> 01:59:23,904
Move forward!

1328
01:59:24,185 --> 01:59:25,502
Keep moving!

1329
01:59:32,266 --> 01:59:33,063
Go!

1330
01:59:34,383 --> 01:59:35,505
Let's go.

1331
01:59:37,341 --> 01:59:39,266
Stop! Listen...

1332
01:59:39,666 --> 01:59:40,623
My child.

1333
01:59:41,462 --> 01:59:42,424
She's your mother.

1334
01:59:42,746 --> 01:59:45,786
We are not to kill her
but to take her back home.

1335
01:59:56,787 --> 01:59:57,385
Vakil!

1336
01:59:58,509 --> 01:59:59,269
Take her inside!

1337
01:59:59,469 --> 02:00:00,226
Sniper.

1338
02:00:00,785 --> 02:00:02,229
There is a sniper. You go!

1339
02:00:03,909 --> 02:00:05,146
Go!
- Are you OK?

1340
02:00:05,627 --> 02:00:06,908
Get up.

1341
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:09,309
Give me the rifle.

1342
02:00:10,232 --> 02:00:12,389
There's a sniper. That rascal!
- Come on.

1343
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:16,191
Get in.

1344
02:00:19,471 --> 02:00:20,189
Well done!

1345
02:00:31,152 --> 02:00:33,114
Take them and leave.
I'll hold them.

1346
02:00:33,394 --> 02:00:34,557
No way.

1347
02:00:44,273 --> 02:00:46,475
Dadda was seeking deliverance.

1348
02:00:49,034 --> 02:00:52,193
That's what we all seek
in the ravines,

1349
02:00:54,398 --> 02:00:56,757
our own Sonchiriya.

1350
02:00:57,437 --> 02:00:59,515
She's walked into our
lives on her own.

1351
02:01:00,874 --> 02:01:01,875
Make sure

1352
02:01:02,318 --> 02:01:04,556
no harm comes to her.

1353
02:01:07,317 --> 02:01:09,240
Your wish is my command, boss.

1354
02:01:16,917 --> 02:01:17,759
Move, Move!

1355
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,200
Hurry up.
- Are you alright?

1356
02:01:45,325 --> 02:01:46,882
Hey.

1357
02:01:55,006 --> 02:01:56,164
This way.

1358
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:18,966
Come this way!

1359
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:32,213
What the hell are you doing?

1360
02:02:32,332 --> 02:02:33,893
He is my son!

1361
02:02:45,572 --> 02:02:47,013
Come on!

1362
02:02:47,175 --> 02:02:48,616
Be careful.

1363
02:02:56,816 --> 02:02:57,774
Come here.

1364
02:03:04,697 --> 02:03:05,655
Out of my way!

1365
02:03:06,055 --> 02:03:07,055
What are you doing?

1366
02:03:07,538 --> 02:03:09,215
Hey, no!

1367
02:03:09,457 --> 02:03:10,858
I said, move away.

1368
02:03:11,698 --> 02:03:13,897
She is your mother!

1369
02:03:22,256 --> 02:03:23,580
My son.

1370
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,780
What fills your heart
with such venom?

1371
02:03:34,581 --> 02:03:36,502
This is not what we taught you!

1372
02:03:36,582 --> 02:03:37,379
Did we?

1373
02:03:37,459 --> 02:03:39,261
Is this what we taught you?

1374
02:03:45,421 --> 02:03:46,903
Listen to me.

1375
02:03:49,863 --> 02:03:51,066
It's not her fault,

1376
02:03:52,984 --> 02:03:54,261
it's mine.

1377
02:03:55,383 --> 02:03:57,344
Let me take her to the hospital

1378
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,546
then you can do what
you want with me.

1379
02:03:59,627 --> 02:04:02,503
She has killed my grandpa.

1380
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:04,225
Your grandpa was scum.

1381
02:04:05,226 --> 02:04:07,188
And he wasn't your grandpa anyway.

1382
02:04:10,185 --> 02:04:11,108
What is he saying?

1383
02:04:11,347 --> 02:04:12,546
Don't pay any attention to him.

1384
02:04:12,746 --> 02:04:14,226
You want to hear the truth?

1385
02:04:14,426 --> 02:04:15,869
Will you be able to hear it?

1386
02:04:15,988 --> 02:04:17,423
Will you be able to bear it?

1387
02:04:17,545 --> 02:04:19,508
Say it. Say, what are you saying?

1388
02:04:19,666 --> 02:04:21,546
Don't know what this woman
has filled his head with.

1389
02:04:21,667 --> 02:04:24,466
Don't say a word, Lakhna.

1390
02:04:24,706 --> 02:04:26,187
I beg you!

1391
02:04:26,309 --> 02:04:28,670
What happened to you,
could've happened to anyone.

1392
02:04:29,107 --> 02:04:30,232
Give up.

1393
02:04:30,912 --> 02:04:32,429
Don't do this.

1394
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:42,830
What are you doing? Leave it!

1395
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,591
Drop it!

1396
02:04:45,753 --> 02:04:48,152
Your grandpa was not your grandpa,

1397
02:04:48,432 --> 02:04:50,273
he was your father.

1398
02:04:53,432 --> 02:04:55,910
She was 13, your mother
when she was married.

1399
02:04:56,273 --> 02:04:57,832
Younger than you are.

1400
02:04:58,074 --> 02:05:00,192
When there was no child
even after 4 years,

1401
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:02,715
your grandpa didn't take
his son to the doctor.

1402
02:05:03,196 --> 02:05:04,833
It would've hurt his pride.

1403
02:05:06,797 --> 02:05:08,794
So he decided to treat her himself.

1404
02:05:12,353 --> 02:05:14,236
He was my father-in-law.

1405
02:05:16,035 --> 02:05:18,238
He was my husband.

1406
02:05:20,595 --> 02:05:22,357
He was your grandfather.

1407
02:05:27,557 --> 02:05:28,636
He was your father.

1408
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:37,959
What happened?

1409
02:06:07,003 --> 02:06:08,763
'Dholpur Hospital'

1410
02:10:18,844 --> 02:10:21,642
'The mice are preyed on
by the snake.'

1411
02:10:22,443 --> 02:10:25,166
'The snake is preyed on
by the vulture.'

1412
02:10:26,247 --> 02:10:32,485
'The Gods looked down and said,
'Well, that's the law of nature'.'

1413
02:10:41,047 --> 02:10:51,085
"Every fibre of that
being sparkled"

1414
02:10:53,008 --> 02:11:05,372
"when the line between conscious
mind and unconscious mind faded."

1415
02:11:15,447 --> 02:11:23,652
"The bird is flying to that land"

1416
02:11:23,732 --> 02:11:31,491
"that is full of hope."

1417
02:11:31,931 --> 02:11:39,131
"The bird is migrating
to the foreign land"

1418
02:11:40,133 --> 02:11:47,493
"that is not bound by
age-old restrictions."

1419
02:11:47,694 --> 02:11:51,696
"Every fibre of that
being sparkled"

1420
02:11:51,896 --> 02:11:55,978

mind and unconscious mind faded."

02:12:00,061 --> 02:12:03,900
"Every fibre of that

1422
02:12:04,178 --> 02:12:07,979
"when the line between conscious
mind and unconscious mind faded."

1423
02:12:08,219 --> 02:12:11,818
"The vision of the bright light"

1424
02:12:12,338 --> 02:12:16,421
"filled the heart with joy."

1425
02:12:16,501 --> 02:12:20,342
"Every fibre of that
being sparkled"

1426
02:12:20,542 --> 02:12:24,224
"when the line between conscious
mind and unconscious mind faded."

1427
02:12:50,142 --> 02:12:57,983
"A plunge into the unknown"

1428
02:12:58,346 --> 02:13:06,105
"answered all
the unresolved thoughts."

1429
02:13:06,466 --> 02:13:14,627
"It was stagnant for centuries."

1430
02:13:14,708 --> 02:13:21,950
"However, that time
eventually came to an end."

1431
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:26,111
"As old secrets tumbled out,
new secrets were kept."

1432
02:13:26,350 --> 02:13:30,229
"It was just like replacing
the contents into a new utensil"

1433
02:13:30,511 --> 02:13:34,350
"and again becomes soil."

1434
02:13:34,674 --> 02:13:38,793
