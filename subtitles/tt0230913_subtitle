1
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,140
Hi, baby!

2
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,860
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

3
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:02,340
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Sharma.

4
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,420
You!?

5
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,540
Why? Didn't you like my coming here?

6
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,254
Hey! Take the proof of your love.

7
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:15,940
I have many such proofs
which I have kept very carefully.

8
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,573
Are you trying to blackmail me?

9
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:24,460
I agree, we don't share an
intimate relation anymore..

10
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,500
but it's not right that
you use such words for me.

11
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:33,500
Before I leave for Calcutta,
I want you to..

12
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,620
come to my room for sometime.

13
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,980
So that at least once..
- What if I don't?

14
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:43,580
Very simple.

15
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,460
The proof of our love story will
be handed over to your husband.

16
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,820
And perhaps, your
brother's wedding may also stop.

17
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:58,020
Karuna was right. You are a
very vile and a wretched man!

18
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,220
Shut up!

19
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:04,340
I am staying at Hotel Unique.
Meet me at 8 p.m sharp.

20
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,334
Give some pistachios
for the sweet dish.

21
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:46,060
Let's go. Every one
remembers things at the last minute.

22
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,940
Kamla.

23
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,220
Kamla.

24
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,380
How come you're here at this hour?
- I want to tell you something..

25
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,020
but privately.

26
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:14,220
Friends, please sit in
that room for 2 minutes.

27
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
I am scared, if I go to the hotel,
he may do something to me.

28
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,300
And if I don't, he has threatened to
give the photographs to my husband.

29
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,740
I don't understand what I should do.

30
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:50,660
Wonder which unfortunate moment it
was when I fell in love with him..

31
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,870
and I wrote letters to him. Oh God!

32
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,940
Why don't you tell your brother?
- Are you mad?

33
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,180
If anyone else besides us,
learns of this, I'll commit suicide.

34
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:12,420
I am saying the truth, if he
gives those letters to Deepak..

35
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,740
I swear it, I will commit suicide!

36
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,700
Don't be silly!
- You tell me what I should do?

37
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,180
You had cautioned me against
Brij and I was able save my honour.

38
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,660
Now, only you can help me!

39
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,940
Karuna, tell me something!

40
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,060
When will the marriage
procession arrive here?

41
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,660
In an hour, but why?

42
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,500
It doesn't take more than 20 minutes
to go and return from the hotel.

43
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,540
What do you mean?
- I'll get your letters back.

44
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,660
You'll go the hotel?
- He will not dare to touch me.

45
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,580
No, Karuna!

46
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:01,340
You are getting married today.

47
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:07,039
Yes, but it is my duty to save
my in-law's house from disgrace!

48
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,820
What if the procession
arrives before your return?

49
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:14,740
If I am destined to get married,
nothing will go wrong.

50
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
You handle everything here, okay.

51
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,420
Karuna.

52
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,340
Will you wait here?
- I am in a hurry, madam.

53
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,060
Wait for 5 minutes,
I'll be back soon.

54
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,260
Okay.

55
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:40,860
I'll go home later. First,
I'll complete your work in Poona.

56
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:44,020
Okay?
- Okay.

57
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,820
Yes, please..

58
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,340
In which room is
Mr. Brij Bhushan staying?

59
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,820
Brij Bhushan?

60
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,820
In room number 417.

61
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,020
Thank you.

62
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,380
Come in!

63
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,460
Please come in.

64
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:33,900
So Kamla has sent you here?

65
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,020
What will you have?
- Kamla's letters.

66
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,260
That you will get but,
what will you drink?

67
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:50,700
A soft drink, a hot drink or..
- I want Kamla's letters.

68
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:55,100
Aren't you getting married today?
- Yes.

69
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,140
And you are..

70
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,660
Didn't you get scared
coming here, at this time?

71
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,340
I heard Kamla saying that
you had praised me a lot.

72
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,980
That I am a rogue, a
wretched man who's full of lust!

73
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,700
I don't have time and..
- And I don't let time slip by.

74
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,340
That night, because of you,
Kamla slipped out from my hands.

75
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,420
But today because of her,
you have come to me.

76
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,700
Time has settled the matter.
Should I also do the same?

77
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,060
What do you mean?

78
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,820
It is very clear.
You need Kamla's love letters..

79
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,060
and I want a price
for those letters.

80
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,692
What price?
- Marriage!

81
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:58,860
What?

82
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,660
Not for life, only for sometime.
- Shut up!

83
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,980
Why are you getting angry?
I was only asking a price of this.

84
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,300
If you can't oblige, it's okay.

85
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,220
Think about it, I have a
customer who will buy them.

86
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,500
Kamla's husband!

87
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,500
What is the hurry, madam?

88
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,180
Leave me!

89
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,260
After I get my price,
I'll leave you.

90
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,500
How long will it take?
- Give us 5 minutes more.

91
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,580
Looks like she is
explaining a lot of things to her.

92
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,340
Who is it? -How long will
your private talk go on?

93
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,220
I will open the door
when we are through.

94
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,380
Let's go, looks like
it is a very long story.

95
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,580
Driver, drive fast.

96
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,140
How much is it?
- Six rupees, forty paise.

97
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,780
I don't have the change.

98
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,740
Keep the change.
- Keep the change?

99
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,580
Wow! It's a very good day for me.

100
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,220
Karuna.
- Kamla.

101
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,380
Thank God!
- Take your letters and burn them.

102
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,060
Did he give it easily?
- Do you think he would?

103
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,540
But I have taught him such a
lesson that he'll always remember.

104
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,820
What happened?

105
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
The procession is approaching,
I'll tell you later.

106
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,340
You forgot to add sugar.
- Why are you wasting the sugar?

107
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,860
Hold her finger and stir the
coffee, it will become sweet.

108
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,060
Kamla.

109
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,540
Yes, I am coming.

110
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,180
I remembered a joke.
A man reached a doctor.

111
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,180
And said "I have amnesia,
I forget everything".

112
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,220
The doctor asked, since when?
- He said, 'what since when?'

113
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,020
Is your joke over? Please laugh!

114
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:20,500
Hey listen! Stop the party now.

115
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,260
Aren't you concerned
about the new bride?

116
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,780
Wow!
- New bride.

117
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,740
We forgot that he
has just got married.

118
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,100
It is 3 O' clock in the morning.
He is already late!

119
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:00,820
Karuna.

120
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,500
Sit down! I know you are very tired.

121
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,020
Even I am very tired.
- But everything has gone wrong.

122
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,460
What went wrong?

123
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,660
You are sitting as
though I am a stranger to you.

124
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,700
Take off your veil!

125
00:18:05,907 --> 00:18:06,940
Why?

126
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,300
You were never shy before marriage!

127
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:14,100
It was different then. My
aunty told me while leaving..

128
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,660
that a new bride should feel shy.

129
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,860
And what should I do
according to your aunty?

130
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,900
Why should I tell you?
You go and ask your uncle.

131
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,900
No! He is the deputy
commissioner of police.

132
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I can't ask him. But yes, my
other uncle did say something..

133
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,380
Oh yes! He told me that
I should very lovingly..

134
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,820
lift my bride's veil.

135
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,980
Then do it, I am feeling stifled.

136
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,580
Look into my eyes!

137
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,180
Aunty told me not to look
into your eyes immediately.

138
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,020
My uncle gave me a
solution for this problem.

139
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,940
He told me that if your bride
doesn't look into your face.

140
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,540
Then very lovingly lift her
face and say that you love her.

141
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,780
And then, kiss her immediately.
- But my aunty never told me this.

142
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,940
She didn't.. But my
uncle told me to do so.

143
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Aunty did not tell me.
- Uncle told me!

144
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,660
Hey! Didn't he
sleep here last night?

145
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,180
He must be drunk!

146
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:52,300
Murder!

147
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,220
Murder!

148
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,740
Murder!

149
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,820
Murder!

150
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,500
I will do all that,
you go for a bath.

151
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,340
I take only 2 minutes for a bath
meanwhile, you do you make up.

152
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,740
What are you doing?
- I am applying lipstick.

153
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,380
Why do you need to
colour your lips artificially?

154
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,340
I will colour them right away!

155
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,700
Oh! - Father. - I'm sorry.
I'm more than sorry.

156
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,420
Never mind, you carry on,
I'll come later.

157
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,020
Come in, father.

158
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Did you have an important work?
- No, nothing important!

159
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,624
Fool! Couldn't you close the door?

160
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,420
I was..

161
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,540
What?
- I was packing.

162
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,180
Ask your mother, we didn't meet
anybody for 2 days after marriage.

163
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,540
And you both don't look as
though you have been married.

164
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,900
Anyway, come for breakfast.

165
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:00,260
And listen..

166
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,420
And finish your work and come!

167
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:31,940
There's

168
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,780
Take the photographs!

169
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,540
Mahadev.

170
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,020
And you take the
fingerprints on the glass.

171
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,340
Okay.

172
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,420
Sir, this wallet.
- Yes, keep it.

173
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,780
K.

174
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,180
Sir, the DCP has come.

175
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,180
Good morning Inspector Kamat.
Good morning.

176
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:09,180
Your area is progressing a lot,
3 murders in 2 days.

177
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,380
This is the influence of films. My
jurisdictions has 5 cinema halls.

178
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,260
Out of which, one has a
story of thieves, 2 of bandits..

179
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,300
.. and 2 murder mysteries.

180
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,780
These films teach ways
to break the law and now..

181
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,100
They have started teaching
ways to fool the police also.

182
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,340
And we get into trouble.

183
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,820
It's a part of our business, my boy.

184
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,660
I have called the hotel manager.
I will need your help.

185
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,900
Sure. Sure. Any time.

186
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,020
The man is dead. But why
should his murder defame our hotel?

187
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,420
Tell the staff to say that
Mr. Brij Bhushan was a decent man.

188
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,980
You follow me?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,140
The police shouldn't
know more than this.

190
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,460
Okay?
- Okay.

191
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,460
Usha, your brother has
found a wife for himself.

192
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,860
He is after her since last evening.

193
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,620
Take this!
- No, thank you.

194
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,020
Usha, why do you have a
swelling on your forehead?

195
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,820
I slipped in the bathroom yesterday.

196
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,660
Hey, brother Vikram!
Please come here.

197
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,700
Sorry, we disturbed you.
- No problem!

198
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,300
But when are you getting married?
- Marriage?

199
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,660
Oh, Usha's marriage!
It will happen very soon.

200
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,260
If you know of someone
then please let me know.

201
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,020
I am asking about your marriage.

202
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
My marriage?
- Yes.

203
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,380
You mean, my marriage?

204
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,580
The chances are very less.
- Why?

205
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,460
I cannot get married until
she doesn't get married.

206
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,860
See, everyone is
laughing at my helplessness.

207
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,020
Hello! This Kailash Chandra speaking.

208
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,220
Is Mr. Anand there, the DCP
would like to speak to him.

209
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,500
Let me speak first.

210
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,260
Sir, it's the judge..

211
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,340
Oh! It's my brother.

212
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,660
Hello, brother!

213
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,060
Hello, tell me sir
what are your orders?

214
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,860
Didn't you go for a walk today?
- There you spoke like a fool!

215
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,820
Who gets up early in
the house full of guests?

216
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,980
You left early but we were awake
till wee hours of the morning.

217
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,940
I know. I know.

218
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,140
Is Anand at home?
- What is that matter.

219
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,420
I had some work in the office if
it is possible for him to come..

220
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,300
Now I am confident that you should
have been a constable and not a DCP.

221
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,460
Yes. I know. I know.

222
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,500
He is going for his honeymoon
and you are calling him for work?

223
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Aren't you ashamed of
calling yourself his uncle?

224
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,020
You should hide your
face with share. - Okay!

225
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,860
Yes. Yes. Yes. Brother.

226
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,300
Looks like the line
got cut! Try again.

227
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,340
Who is speaking?
- Munna, this is grandfather speaking.

228
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,300
Who, small grandpa?

229
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,220
I know. I know.

230
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,780
Call your uncle!
- Uncle!

231
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,620
Uncle, it is small
grandpa on the line.

232
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,759
I'll just come.
- Don't go, you'll get trapped.

233
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:53,721
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

234
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,340
Good morning, sir. - Good morning,
inspector. Good morning.

235
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,460
I am glad you have come.

236
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,300
There was a murder in
Hotel Unique yesterday.

237
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,180
And your colleague,
Inspector Bulsara is very sick.

238
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,220
What happened?

239
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,500
Appendicitis!
He'll perhaps be operated.

240
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,900
And as you know Wagle
already has a lot of work.

241
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:29,980
That's why, I had to
cancel your holiday.

242
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,608
No problem.

243
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,460
This file has the
investigation report

244
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,420
Take a look!

245
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,900
And fill up.

246
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,220
Till I read this, you get the
photographs, fingerprint reports..

247
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,820
..and the hospital reports..

248
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,889
..we will have to go to Hotel
Unique for on the spot enquiry.

249
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,460
Okay, boss.

250
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,060
Anand, I sometimes
feel sorry for you. - Why?

251
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,060
As for as reports are concerned it's
ok but, you are serious about work.

252
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,940
Pay attention, if you
wouldn't take the case today..

253
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,500
..then you would be out on
your honeymoon today evening.

254
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,500
What do you mean?
- I am talking about your honeymoon!

255
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,500
Get the reports immediately.

256
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,940
Hi, Karuna.
- Hi.

257
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,580
You look very cute.

258
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,180
Thank you.

259
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,980
Congratulations Karuna!
Where is Anand?

260
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,060
He must be on his way.

261
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,980
I sing along with the saints..

262
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,940
I also go and pray in the temples.

263
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,860
I hope I don't turn into God.

264
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,540
What did you say?

265
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,420
I meant God.

266
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,100
I hope I don't turn into God.

267
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,700
Thinking of that, I
don't even commit sins.

268
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,820
Wow!

269
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,540
Here comes Anand!
- You are late for your our party?

270
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,820
Sorry. Sorry.

271
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,460
The people in the
police are never in time!

272
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,660
Where were you? - Sorry. I
had to go far an urgent case.

273
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,420
What was so urgent?

274
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,500
A man was murdered in
Hotel Unique yesterday.

275
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:22,940
Did you find the murderer?
- All we know is that it is a woman.

276
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,500
It is the age of the women, friends!
First they killed with their looks.

277
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,620
Now, they have
started using weapons.

278
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,340
Anand, did you find a
clue about the killer?

279
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,500
All I know about
the killer is that..

280
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,660
.. she has an innocent
face but an evil heart!

281
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,300
Wow! Now sing a song!

282
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,620
Hey no! I can't sing.
- Wow! Wow!

283
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,820
You will have to sing!

284
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:02,380
"I know this much
about the assassin.."

285
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,940
"..she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

286
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,220
"..she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

287
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,940
"I know this much
about the assassin.."

288
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:21,500
"..she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

289
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,940
"She lowers her gaze,
feigns ignorance.."

290
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,380
"she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

291
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,700
"..she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

292
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,580
"Do not walk out of
the gathering like this"

293
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,740
"Do not walk out of
the gathering like this"

294
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,300
"Sit with me, give
me a smile, please"

295
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,780
"We're celebrating
our happiness today.."

296
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,420
"..so forget whatever
happened in the past"

297
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,780
"What's that about the past..?"

298
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,100
"It's about her beauty,
the secret of my love"

299
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,540
"It's about her flowing tresses,
about all eyes straying.."

300
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,940
"..how my suffered. It
burnt in the fires of passion"

301
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,340
"She was in my embrace,
but at heart, I still pined"

302
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,780
"There was a stillness in the air,
I was almost out of my senses"

303
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:47,220
"She was driving me crazy.. how
beautiful the assassin looked"

304
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,460
"I shall lift the
veil from your face.."

305
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,380
"I shall lift the
veil from your face.."

306
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,580
"I shall tell everyone
how the slaying happened"

307
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,940
"The one who kills now
finds herself in trouble.."

308
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,300
"she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

309
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,700
"she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

310
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:36,180
"Do not hurl accusations like this"

311
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,540
"Do not hurl accusations like this"

312
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:44,980
"The secret will
be exposed.. beware"

313
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,620
"We're celebrating
our happiness today.."

314
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,700
"Forget whatever has
happened in the past"

315
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,260
"Remember the times
you met her secretly"

316
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,620
"How you used to gaze
into each other's eyes"

317
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,940
"Nights that were longer than days,
spent talking about each other"

318
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,260
"How helpless you felt! You
were distanced from each other"

319
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,580
"Having lost your heart,
you used to wander aimlessly"

320
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,780
"You thought you'd die and your
desires would remain unfulfilled"

321
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:26,140
"That's exactly why I
had extended my support.."

322
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,420
"I had steered your
boat to the shores"

323
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,780
"That's exactly why
this beauty is so vain"

324
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,060
"That's exactly why
this beauty is so vain"

325
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,700
"She's drunk on her own beauty"

326
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,420
"Look how she sits.. all decked up"

327
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,300
"She's forgiven seven murders..
not just one"

328
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,420
"She's forgiven seven murders..
not just one"

329
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:05,980
"The law is also
bowled over by her.."

330
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,220
"she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

331
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,500
"she has an innocent face,
but she's black-hearted"

332
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,060
Wonderful. Wonderful.

333
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:29,500
What is the matter? Why
do you look so scared?

334
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,860
Kamla, Brij is dead!
- What?

335
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,060
When did he die and how?
How did you know?

336
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,900
Your brother said it.
He is handling the case.

337
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,220
Oh God! - And he even knows
that the murderer is a woman.

338
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,140
What will happen now?
How will I face anyone?

339
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,980
I will be in a big trouble, Karuna.

340
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,527
Deepak will throw
me out of the house.

341
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:06,060
And my parents will
also not accept me.

342
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,860
No one will accept me, Karuna.

343
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,420
Don't cry!
Nobody will know anything.

344
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,460
Then will you..
- Yes, if I am caught..

345
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,500
..then I will take the
blame on myself. - No, Karuna!

346
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,420
I am the one at fault.
I had written those letter's.

347
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,060
You went there because
of me. Because of me..

348
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,540
Kamla, I went there because
you are my husband's sister.

349
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,180
You are the daughter of my in law's.

350
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,780
It was my duty to save you
from that rogue's clutches.

351
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,380
I went to Brij to save
the honour of this house..

352
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,580
I will never open my mouth
and put that honour at stake.

353
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,540
I will die but never
tell anyone about it!

354
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,700
Karuna.

355
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,660
Let's go, they all
must be waiting for us.

356
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,100
Where are you? Come here!

357
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,580
Where do you go
early in the morning?

358
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,940
Sit.
- Shall I make your tea?

359
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,540
Before that, give
me some cough syrup.

360
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,940
Do you have a sore throat?
- No, to change the taste of my mouth.

361
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,220
Leave me! The phone is
ringing since so long.

362
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,460
Hello!

363
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,020
Is Mr. Anand there?
- Who is speaking?

364
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,780
I am Sharma, the
manager of Hotel Unique.

365
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,580
Who's call is it?
- It is Mr. Sharma from Hotel Unique.

366
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,100
Hello, Mr. Sharma!

367
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,100
It's nice that you returned from
Poona, our case was not progressing.

368
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,580
You are the one who
can identify the killer.

369
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,300
You had seen and
spoken to that woman.

370
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,860
Your colleagues said that on 24th
March, the night of the murder..

371
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,420
remember, a girl had
enquired about Brij Bhushan to you?

372
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,020
Good. So when will you meet me?

373
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,220
You can come at my place.

374
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,580
Hey! No some guests
are leaving today.

375
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,580
Are you in the hotel? I will
meet you there at around 11. a.m.

376
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,580
Okay? Okay. Thank you.

377
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,220
What did you do?

378
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,620
Okay then! Please
have control over Anand.

379
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,580
These police people
like to boss even at home.

380
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,740
Drop me on the way.

381
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,540
Karuna.

382
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,660
Karuna.

383
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,860
I am leaving you alone
to face all the problem.

384
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,540
But I am helpless or else, I
wouldn't leave you in this dilemma.

385
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,700
Hurry up, it's getting late.

386
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,940
Take care of yourself. I am going!

387
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,740
"I face a grave
predicament in my life.."

388
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,700
"..how on earth am I
going to solve it?"

389
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,820
"I face a grave
predicament in my life.."

390
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,660
"..how on earth am I
going to solve it?"

391
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,500
"I'm like the boat
caught in a storm.."

392
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,340
"..how will I steer it to safety?"

393
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,860
"The pain that lies in my heart.."

394
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,020
"The pain that lies in my heart.."

395
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,620
"I can't explain
how agonising it is"

396
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,380
"I can't explain
how agonising it is"

397
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,900
"I do want to tell
those that I love.."

398
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,700
"but I still can't bring
myself about to tell them"

399
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,460
"but I still can't bring
myself about to tell them"

400
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,060
"Like the tears that
flow from my eyes.."

401
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,660
"Like the tears that
flow from my eyes.."

402
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,380
"I wish I could flow away too"

403
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,020
"I face a grave
predicament in my life.."

404
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,580
"how on earth am I
going to solve it?"

405
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,860
"I'm like the boat
caught in a storm.."

406
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,500
"how shall I steer it to safety?"

407
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,140
My profession is such that I have to
keep my ears and eyes open always.

408
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,940
Whatever I see, is
immediately stored in my mind.

409
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,580
Really?
- I have just met you.

410
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,860
But I know that you are
wearing brown socks and black shoes.

411
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,660
That's strange!

412
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,420
And you use your left
hand more than right.

413
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,780
How did you notice that?!
- As your come here..

414
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,780
you took out the cigarette packet
with left hand, lit the match ..

415
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,260
and now you are pulling the
chair also with left hand.

416
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,180
Mr. Sharma, you are just fantastic.

417
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,220
If you have such a good memory then
you surely must remember that girl?

418
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,660
Of course! I can
describe her perfectly.

419
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,740
As she stepped from the taxi.
- Taxi?

420
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,940
Yes, a taxi. - Do you
remember the taxi number then?

421
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,340
I am sorry.

422
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,980
I did not see that.
But it was a fiat taxi.

423
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,820
Which model? - It was
Premier President Safari model

424
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,060
Good. Good. Good.

425
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,980
Then it won't be a
problem searching the taxi.

426
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,420
Tell me, how can I help you?

427
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,500
I want the number and the addresses
of the owners of the Safari Taxies.

428
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,140
Come tomorrow, today I am busy.

429
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,260
Look, it very important.
- I told you, I don't have time.

430
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,940
The commissioner has sent me here!

431
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,580
Yes, the
commissioner has sent me here.

432
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,580
Do you also, like me..
- Sometimes!

433
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,060
Then your work will be
done first. Please sit!

434
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,900
Thank you. So nice.

435
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,380
Next.
- 4..

436
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,497
Say it in Hindi.
- 47.

437
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:48,072
M.

438
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,902
R.

439
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:51,898
T.
- T.

440
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:54,620
2. 8.

441
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,540
3?
- 4.

442
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:00,100
4.

443
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,940
Name.
- Krishnakant.

444
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,180
Keralal Kishen.

445
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,220
Kishen.
- C/o.. - C/o..

446
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,260
Kulveer Singh.
- Singh.

447
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:16,820
Ko.. Koilewala..
- Koilewali..

448
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,020
Koliwada.
- Koliwada.

449
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,060
There aren't any further.
- No more?

450
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Thanks for your co-operation.

451
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,700
Aren't you like me?
- Of course not!

452
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,180
I was sympathizing with you.
I am not like you.

453
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,140
Goodbye.

454
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:52,020
What a CID inspector he is,
he is, trying to imitate me!

455
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,660
Hey! Where is this taxi owner,
Nafasat Ali's house?

456
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,100
This is it.
- This is it?

457
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,020
If that girl come in front
of you, can you identify her?

458
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,260
Yes.

459
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,420
But what has she done?
- Nothing much, just a murder!

460
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:41,220
What happened?
- Nothing!

461
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,140
I found this letter in the cab that
night. I think it belongs to her.

462
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,580
Oh! Even this has the same 'K'.
- Let me see!

463
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,500
Yeah! it's the same.
It says 'only my, Brij'.

464
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,660
Brij?

465
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,460
He is talking of the same girl
who went to the hotel that night.

466
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,980
I was not aware that even
murderers write love letters!

467
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,020
All right, you drive. Read it.

468
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:14,900
'My dear, Brij. It is not just a
letter or words written in ink..

469
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,780
it's my breath, which has come
in form of words, on this paper.

470
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,700
That means, she must have gone
to take her letters back from him.

471
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,940
Why would she want to do
that if she loved him?

472
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,420
Besides, why will
she kill her own lover?

473
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,500
Perhaps, she was in
love with him then..

474
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,420
..and now she loves someone else.

475
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,820
You are right.

476
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,340
Brij must have refused to give the
letters, so she must've killed him.

477
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,620
This is road from when she
hired the taxi and also got down.

478
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,780
Which way did she go?
- No idea where she has gone.

479
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,100
It won't be difficult to find her.
- Why?

480
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,460
She is your sister-in-law.
- What?

481
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,660
Didn't you get married
to a girl from this area?

482
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,780
So aren't you the
son-in-law of this area?

483
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,460
Good you reminded me.
I had to go there, let's go.

484
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,260
No, I am not coming.
You can go ahead!

485
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,020
I will take him to
office and note his statement.

486
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,820
Let's go!
- Goodbye, sir.

487
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,180
Let's go.

488
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,180
Child, you also have tea with us.
- I'll have it here, father.

489
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,060
I have to make food
for your journey..

490
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,860
..if I leave it on Ramu Kaka,
you'll miss your train.

491
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,060
I am dependent on her,
after her mother's death.

492
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,300
Now that she too has gone,
this house feels very lonely.

493
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,940
I don't feel like staying here.
- Are you going to Haridwar?

494
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,380
Yes. It is better to go
for pilgrimage at this age.

495
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,140
Anyway, tell me when are
you getting your holidays..

496
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,740
And has your case ended yet or no?

497
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,380
It has almost ended. I have
got a very big evidence today.

498
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,060
Really?
- Yes,.. See this!

499
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:32,300
This letter belongs to that murder
which she dropped in the taxi.

500
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,980
Father, I am sure that this letter
will help me to find that girl.

501
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,460
Dear Karuna, I haven't heard
from you since I have come here.

502
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,100
I console myself that..

503
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,340
..if there is no news,
then all is well there.

504
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,900
Stop it now! Why are you
writing such a big letter?

505
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,860
I am just ending it!

506
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,620
Believe me, all I do
is think about you.

507
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,100
Whenever I think of it,
I curse myself.

508
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,100
Why did I let you go to the hotel?

509
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,740
I hope that brother can
never ever solve this case.

510
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,780
And it gets closed without ending.
Lots of love, your Kamla.

511
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,860
Postman.

512
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,860
Take your post.

513
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,180
This is Kamla's letter!

514
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,260
Hey! Inspite of being my wife,
you are getting scared?

515
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,300
What if he gets Kamla's letter
and he recognises her writing?

516
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,500
Come on, give.

517
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,300
Car for sale.

518
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,020
Do you know, mother and
father have taken Munnu out.

519
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,860
Really?
- And Jeetu has gone to the market.

520
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,180
Really?

521
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,500
Shankar is not well.

522
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,980
He is not well?
- Really?

523
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,980
You have returned back tired and
now you're sitting with this mail.

524
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,820
Let's of upstairs.

525
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,700
Let me see if there is
something important.

526
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,380
"All day and night.."

527
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,380
"it's work, work and work"

528
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:37,660
"All day and night,
it's work, work and work"

529
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,820
"All day and night,
it's work, work and work"

530
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:48,060
"Why don't you, honey,
ever talk about love?"

531
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,260
"You take no break from work.."

532
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,260
"You take no break from work.."

533
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,860
"I'm not going to
talk to you, my love"

534
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,460
"All day and night,
it's work, work and work"

535
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,500
"Why don't you ever talk
about love, sweetheart?"

536
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:36,460
"Why is my heartbeat
exposing my secrets today..?"

537
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,620
"it's revealing my secret"

538
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,340
"I know it, he doesn't.."

539
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,460
"what it means to pine like this"

540
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,740
"what it means to pine like this"

541
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,860
"You couldn't ever
read what's in my heart.."

542
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,860
"You couldn't ever
read what's in my heart.."

543
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,700
"I'm not going to
talk to you, my love"

544
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:17,140
"All day and night,
you talk only about work"

545
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,060
"Why don't you ever talk
about love, sweetheart?"

546
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,580
"You promised me so much in love.."

547
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,420
"so what holds you back today?"

548
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,700
"so what holds you back today?"

549
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:59,020
"I can't bear the idea
of being with you.."

550
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,140
"and yet being so far
away from my sweetheart"

551
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,460
"and yet being so far
away from my sweetheart"

552
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,540
"You're the one for whom
my passions are aroused.."

553
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,580
"You're the one for whom
my passions are aroused.."

554
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,300
"but I'm not
talking to you, my love"

555
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:27,900
"All day and night,
you talk only about work"

556
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,860
"Why can't you ever
think of love, honey?"

557
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,340
"You can't ever take a
break from your work.."

558
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,940
"You can't ever take a
break from your work.."

559
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,860
"I'm not talking to you.."

560
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,020
Shreekanth.

561
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,660
What are you doing?
- I've caught him with great difficulty

562
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,860
Oh! Is he is the one?
Then welcome him warmly.

563
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:08,700
Take this, put him inside,
I will deal with him.

564
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,580
Make arrangements for his welcome.
- Come on!

565
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,140
Take him gently.
- Ok, sir.

566
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,500
Let us go.

567
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,980
Very good, Shreekanth!

568
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,020
You will definitely go up.

569
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,060
Vikram. Come here.

570
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,660
This is the Joshi lane Junction..

571
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,940
..from when she boarded the taxi.

572
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,140
And where she even got down.
- Correct.

573
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:45,860
That means, her house should be
maximum within is 1 mile area.

574
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,220
Correct.

575
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,740
That means, she
lives within this area.

576
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,980
As soon as we find her, I become
an inspector and you, the ACP.

577
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,940
For that we'll have to
check every house in that area.

578
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,300
The girls who live in this area,
on the night of murder,..

579
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:10,020
or the girls who were in the area,
we will have to list them out.

580
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh God! This time I will not
be able to do the work. - Why?

581
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,980
I have lost my patience,
searching for the taxi driver.

582
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,740
This time, hand over
this task to someone else.

583
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,620
The promotion will
also go to someone else.

584
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,540
Yes, give it to someone else.
Am I not your friend?

585
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,860
Am I your enemy? Okay, tell me.

586
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,500
Girls with initial 'K'..

587
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,260
I have to list out the girls
with the initial 'K'.

588
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,700
Then list the girls who are match
Sharma's and Nafasat's description.

589
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,580
Correct.
- That means, age is 18-25 years..

590
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,940
..beautiful girl, fair
complexion and average height!

591
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,622
Absolutely correct.
- Absolutely right?

592
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:47,420
There must be thousand
of houses in that area..

593
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,860
And it will take at least
2 months to list them out!

594
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,940
It will but, if you have
to be an inspector then..

595
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,260
I will start right away!

596
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,020
Thank you very much for the advice.

597
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,460
Munna, come here and
give me these books.

598
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,940
Hey! Junior Judge.
- Did you say something?

599
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,980
Yes. Keep those
glasses aside and help me.

600
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,060
Nobody lets me read in this house.

601
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:34,140
Keep them properly or
grandfather will get very angry.

602
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,300
He'll say why did you teach my books?
- Brat! You're a copying me?

603
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,140
What were you doing?
- There was dust on the books.

604
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,940
Lakshmi. Lakshmi.

605
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,380
Why do you start screaming
when you enter the house?

606
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,820
Look what Karuna's is doing?
- What is she doing?

607
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,380
Just see!

608
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,620
When you get married you
did not work for 1 year.

609
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,340
And she is married for
less than a month and..

610
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,660
she is working.
- I didn't tell her.

611
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,620
Father, I was
getting bored, so I did it.

612
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:15,580
Even I was getting bored.
- Now I understand!

613
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,620
Nonsense!

614
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,140
I have told you to give top
priority to assembly questions.

615
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,420
Why didn't you put a red
tape on it? - I'll just put it.

616
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,060
Keep it in mind and work.
- Okay, sir.

617
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,096
Idiot.

618
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
Deputy commissioner here..

619
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,420
Which fool made you a D.C?
- Brother, you?

620
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,060
Yes it's me, you are a constable,
not a D.C.

621
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,860
I get into trouble because of you.

622
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,260
I did it, sir.

623
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,860
Yes, I am aware. I know. I know.

624
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,900
What 'I know, I know'!

625
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,900
You don't know anything.
You can't do anything yourself.

626
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,260
I put the slip, can I keep it, sir?
- Keep it.

627
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,260
What, should I keep the phone?
- I meant, you are right.

628
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,940
If that's so then, send Anand home..

629
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,780
tell him Karuna is not feeling well.

630
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,740
What happened?
- Why are you asking?

631
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,940
You didn't let them go on a honey-moon.
You've involved Anand in work.

632
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,900
I wish I could
demote you to a constable.

633
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,260
I know. I know. Thank you, sir.

634
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,060
I will send him right away!
- Okay.

635
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:32,460
Has Anand come?
Anand, come into my office.

636
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,300
"We will take away.."

637
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,700
"We will take away the bride.."

638
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,500
Be careful, you will hurt aunty.

639
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,100
"We will take away granny."

640
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,660
Go play outside.

641
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,460
"We will take away.."
- You are getting late for school.

642
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,780
"We will take away the granny.."

643
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,060
Wait you brat, I will get you!

644
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:03,900
His father was the same.
He had become a major..

645
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,980
..but he acted like a kid.

646
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,780
Whenever he came home there
would be happiness all around.

647
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:19,380
His wife used to comb my
hair the same way, everyday.

648
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,820
Seeing my white hair,
she would pull it out.

649
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:30,740
She'd say you're not
my mother-in-law..

650
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,740
..but like my elder sister.

651
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,340
She passed away
while delivering Munna.

652
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,060
The next day we received the news..

653
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,620
..of my son's death.

654
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,980
In two days, I had
aged 20 years more.

655
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:03,260
God had no mercy on that child!

656
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,900
He did not see his
mother's or father's face at all.

657
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,420
Child!
- Come in, Ramu Kaka.

658
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,940
Hello, madam!
- Hello!

659
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,700
Few of her clothes were left back.

660
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,220
I have got them and your father
had left a letter for you..

661
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,740
..while leaving.

662
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,980
You take the clothes,
I'll go and see where Munna is.

663
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,620
Jeetu, make tea for Ramu Kaka.

664
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,500
Okay. Come, Ramu Kaka.

665
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,460
Come, first have cold
water and then hot tea!

666
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,420
You?

667
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,700
Didn't I catch you? What
were you doing so secretly?

668
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,740
I was putting those clothes..
- Don't lie!

669
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,980
I have seen with my own eyes.
- What?

670
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:36,580
That thing you are
trying to hide. Come on, give.

671
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,780
I am not talking about this.
I mean that thing..

672
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:51,060
Hey! I am talking of the thing
that can be seen from your blouse.

673
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,260
Move away!
- Whose letter is that?

674
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,100
Oh! It is my
father's letter, read it.

675
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,900
I will read it later,
first remove your sari.

676
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,220
What are you saying? - Come on,
hurry up, remove your sari!

677
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,340
How can I..

678
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,380
Look what I have got for you.
- It's such a nice colour.

679
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,580
I want to see how this
colour looks on your fair skin.

680
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,420
How do I look?
- How do I look?

681
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,620
How do I look?

682
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,900
Munna, give me the shawl.
- No, I won't!

683
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,780
Please Munna, give it.
- Don't give.

684
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,660
Munna.
- Be careful. - No, I won't give.

685
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,900
Uncle, hold me.

686
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:57,580
Not me, uncle. Hold this shawl.
Very good, don't give it back.

687
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,020
Okay!
- Great. Don't give it, uncle.

688
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,780
Hold it tight, don't give it.

689
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,220
Hold it tight, don't give it.

690
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,700
Uncle, hold it right.
- Leave it!

691
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,140
Who needs the shawl?
I need the owner of the shawl.

692
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,500
Even I need the owner of the shawl.

693
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,380
Munna, grandmother is calling you.

694
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,700
No, she sent me here to
call you. You come with me.

695
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,780
Is the list ready or not?
- Just a minute.

696
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,460
There are 11 girls with the
initial 'K', who can be doubted.

697
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,100
Only 11?
- Yes.

698
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,100
That means, it's easy to get them.

699
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,460
Out of this, the first 3
girls are out of town..

700
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,660
they have been informed, we will
interrogate them, when they return.

701
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:17,100
Out of the remaining 8 girls,
the 11th girl can be ignored.

702
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,060
Why?
- Because she has a strong alibi.

703
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:24,740
At the time of murder,
she was getting married.

704
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,580
Yes! With a foolish CID Inspector.

705
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,860
Then why did you
write Karuna's name?

706
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,220
With the fear that you
may question me later..

707
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,900
..that why didn't
I mention her name?

708
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:44,620
Get these 10 girls
identified by Mr. Sharma. - Okay.

709
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,300
And I will interrogate
the 11th girl on my own.

710
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:53,620
What is the need?
- I'll just have some fun.

711
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,380
Oh! So you also like to joke?
- Your company has an effect on me.

712
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,100
Good. Good. Very good. Carry on.

713
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,980
I hope that she doesn't get serious.

714
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,420
I will pacify her.
- All the best.

715
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,780
Didn't I tell you, I don't
know of any Brij Bhushan.

716
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,540
Try to remember properly,
he was your lover.

717
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:24,060
Aren't you ashamed?
- Yes, I am.

718
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:30,020
But since I am a CID inspector,
I will have to interrogate you.

719
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,540
Besides, I have a
complain against you.

720
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,940
You did not write a single love
letter to me, as you wrote to Brij.

721
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,100
This is a lie!

722
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:46,780
Did you marry with your own
choice or were you compelled to?

723
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,660
Or did you have a fight with Brij?

724
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,020
I told you, I was not
connected with him, I only..

725
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,580
Okay, why are you screaming so much?

726
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,460
Okay, I agree that
you did not know him.

727
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,820
When did you get married?
- Why, don't you know?

728
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:12,020
Oh yes! Even I was present.
Wasn't it on 24th March?

729
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,820
Brij was murdered on the same night.

730
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:23,380
What time did you get married?
I think it was 10 p.m.

731
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:29,540
And as per the post mortem report,
the murder was between 8 to 9 p.m.

732
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:36,020
That means, after the murder,
you could sit in the marriage hall?

733
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,620
Now you will say that
you did not kill him.

734
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,460
Then answer my question.

735
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,740
What were you doing at
the hotel that night?

736
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,660
And it was 8 p.m when my
friend saw you getting into a lift.

737
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,100
That means, you had..

738
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,020
..what happened, Karuna?

739
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,220
Karuna. Karuna.

740
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,140
What happened? I was joking.

741
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,580
Karuna.

742
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,460
Jeetu.

743
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,780
Jeetu. Shankar.

744
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,580
"My heart, caged for life.."

745
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,260
"My heart, caged for life.."

746
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,860
"how shall it ever be set free?

747
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:56,900
"how shall it ever be set free?

748
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,260
"Live, I must.."

749
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,700
"until I breathe my last"

750
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,580
"until I breathe my last"

751
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:17,740
"I can't even
breathe freely anymore.."

752
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:27,300
"I can't even
breathe freely anymore.."

753
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:31,620
"how shall I bear this burden?"

754
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:37,340
"This grave
predicament of my life.."

755
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:41,540
"how will I ever solve?"

756
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:47,140
"I'm like a boat
caught in a storm.."

757
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:51,300
"how shall I steer it to safety?"

758
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:57,620
"This grave problem of my life.."

759
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,900
Let's go, Mr. Anand.

760
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,780
Tell me, Mr. Sharma, who is the one?

761
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,100
That girl is not
present here, Mr. Anand.

762
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,340
What are you saying? Are you sure?

763
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,300
Yes, that girl is not here.

764
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,580
Mr. Sharma, check once gain.,
It has to be one of these girls.

765
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,980
No Mr. Vikram, you
can send them away.

766
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,740
Shall I leave them?

767
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,820
Thank you.

768
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:55,780
This girl seems to be quite
smarter than we anticipated.

769
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,020
Hiring a taxi from one junction
and leaving at the same spot..

770
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,300
was to fool the police.

771
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,420
What shall we do now?

772
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,220
I don't understand.

773
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,020
No Anand, it's no point
wasting more time on this case.

774
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,580
Close it and put it
as a dormant file.

775
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:28,300
This will be injustice to me.
Give me some more time.

776
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,420
Or else, it will
tarnish my career forever.

777
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,460
I know you have worked
very hard on this case.

778
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:40,140
Hard work! I have invited the
wrath of my family for this case..

779
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,580
I have hurt Karuna,
sacrificed my happiness..

780
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,660
and now, when I am
close to my destination..

781
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,580
Anand. Don't be so serious
about this case.

782
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:54,020
I know you've worked very hard.
Read my remarks, I've blamed you.

783
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,740
If the case closes,
I will obviously be blamed.

784
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,220
And the department will
consider it as my defeat.

785
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,300
What defeat? The ones who
lose hopes are defeated.

786
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,940
In fact, seeing your efforts,
you've been made an ACP.

787
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,340
Congratulations!
- Thank you, sir.

788
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,820
But sir, don't close this case.
Give me some more time.

789
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,940
If you want to progress..

790
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,380
..then you should
accept victory and defeat!

791
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,020
Probably, closing this
case may do some good to you.

792
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,940
Listen, you make
arrangements to go out of Bombay.

793
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,340
I've been neglecting another
case since 4 months, for this one.

794
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:41,460
Which case?
- Your wife, Karuna's case.

795
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,900
I have sanctioned your leave.
Take these 2 plane tickets.

796
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:49,620
It is my gift for your honeymoon.

797
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,980
Cheer up, man. And have a
good time. Come on, man.

798
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,580
If you go home like this, Karuna
will think you've had a fight.

799
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,940
Come on.

800
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:15,460
Hello! - Hello, Karuna. This is
Vikram. You've got a promotion.

801
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:20,260
My promotion?
- Your husband has become an ACP.

802
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,980
Really? This is a good news!

803
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,060
That hotel unique murder case..

804
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:30,500
..due to which your honeymoon
was canceled that case is closed..

805
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,100
Hello! Hello!

806
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:05,460
"You look so sweet today.."

807
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:10,020
"you look more like a
rose that blossoming"

808
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:14,620
"What's special then..?
- There is something"

809
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:19,660
"What secret is it..?
- There is something"

810
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:25,100
"You look so sweet today.."

811
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,540
"you look more like a
rose that blossoming"

812
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:34,180
"What's special then..?
- There is something"

813
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,900
"What secret is it..?
- There is something"

814
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,580
"You were your usual self
till yesterday, but today.."

815
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:13,700
"what has transpired?"

816
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:24,060
"Between yesterday and today,
I happened to meet happiness"

817
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,220
"I happened to meet happiness"

818
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,780
"What sort of happiness..?
- I'm not telling you"

819
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,660
"Aren't you telling me..?
- No, I'm not telling you"

820
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:42,780
"You won't tell your sweetheart?
What happiness is this?"

821
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:50,180
"For the first ever time,
I'm in love with life"

822
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,460
"I smile today, for Spring is mine"

823
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:59,140
"What's so special..?
- There is something"

824
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,740
"What secret is it..?
- There is something"

825
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:31,900
"You have no clue how
delighted I am to see you happy"

826
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:36,300
"..how delighted I am.."

827
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:46,420
"My eyes will tell
you what's in my heart"

828
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:50,700
"..what's in my heart."

829
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:55,340
"So what do your eyes say?
- I'm not telling you"

830
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:00,260
"Aren't you telling me..?
- Yes! I'm not telling you"

831
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,300
"Else, when have you ever flattered
me unless you want something?"

832
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:05,500
Is it so?

833
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:12,580
"You look very sweet today.."

834
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,980
"I can see the
excitement on your face"

835
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:21,540
"So what's special..?
- There is something"

836
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,340
"What secret is it?
- There is something"

837
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:31,540
"So what's special..?
- There is something"

838
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:36,620
"What secret is it?
- There is something"

839
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:44,140
That is like it! It should be known
that our son has become on ACP.

840
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,140
Everyone gives a party but there
should be something more to it.

841
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,580
Vikram, there should be
song and dance programme.

842
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,820
That too only girls should dance.
- What do you mean, uncle?

843
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,380
I mean that they
should be good dancers.

844
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:03,940
The programme will be suspense.
- Okay, there should be a song also.

845
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,180
"I've been robbed by
those pretty lassies.."

846
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,060
"the ones with fair
cheeks and long, black hair"

847
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,700
"Your eyes aren't eyes. They're
daggers that pierce my heart"

848
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,820
We have engaged this
hall for the party.

849
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,300
There's a small hall adjoining
this, where the food will be served.

850
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,180
The complete
arrangement should be good.

851
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:36,300
Don't worry, Mr. Vikram.

852
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:38,980
All the
arrangements will be perfect.

853
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,100
Very good.
- When is the party?

854
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:44,980
Anand and his wife
have gone to Kashmir.

855
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,060
They couldn't go earlier
because of the murder in the hotel.

856
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,260
When are they coming?
- Saturday.

857
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:54,140
The party is on Sunday at 8 p.m.

858
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,700
Sunday evening, 8 p.m!

859
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,940
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

860
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,780
As you all know, that
this party is in honour of..

861
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:08,420
the retired Judge Kailashnath's,
just retired from Kashmir..

862
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,260
Mr. Anand's ..

863
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,620
I'm sorry. just returned
from Kashmir Mr. Anand Chand.

864
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:22,180
This party is due to
Mr. Anand's promotion.

865
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:26,140
We hope that next year,
we will once again..

866
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:34,620
have this party to welcome
the arrival of a junior ACP.

867
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,740
So ladies, gentlemen and policemen..

868
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,740
The special item for
the evening is wives..

869
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,540
the policemen's wives.

870
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:47,300
So hear the woes of
the policemen's wives?

871
01:18:53,100 --> 01:19:00,380
"It remained in my
heart for so long.."

872
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,660
"and it comes to my lips today"

873
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:16,900
"By marrying my sweetheart.."

874
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:25,420
"how I've lost out on
the best years of my life"

875
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:35,700
"My sweetheart has eyes
for the whole world.."

876
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,420
"I'm the only one he
will not cast a glance at"

877
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:44,180
"My sweetheart has eyes
for the whole world.."

878
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:47,980
"I'm the only one he
will not cast a glance at"

879
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,180
"What a waste.."

880
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:56,900
"Oh, what a waste of
my passionate youth.."

881
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:00,580
"he just won't look at me"

882
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:05,140
"he just won't look at me"

883
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:30,500
"I swear it on God..
- I swear by my dreams"

884
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:36,980
"By God, I rue the
moment I looked into his eyes"

885
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:43,420
"I was out of my mind
to have married him"

886
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:54,020
"Oh, the sweet words he
used to steal my heart"

887
01:20:54,260 --> 01:21:00,140
"He made such tall
claims to ensnare me"

888
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:06,380
"Which police station will I
report my cruel husband to?"

889
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,340
"He refuses to look at me"

890
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:14,140
"He refuses to look at me"

891
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,780
"My husband has eyes
for the whole world.."

892
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:22,460
"I'm the only one he
won't cast a glance at"

893
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,780
"He refuses to look at me"

894
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:52,860
"I've borne enough tyranny.
I can't take it anymore"

895
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:58,820
"My father-in-law is better.
He at least takes Ma-in-law out"

896
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:03,220
"If anyone would care to see.."

897
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,140
"the father's far more
energetic than the son"

898
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:13,180
"How I regret becoming
an Inspector's wife"

899
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:19,540
"He'd rather grab
criminal's necks, but not my hand"

900
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,620
"I can't take this death anymore"

901
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:31,820
"But I'm not keeping quiet anymore,
I'm a fiery lady"

902
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:35,660
"He won't even talk at home.."

903
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,100
"He won't even talk at home,
but kicks up a fuss outside"

904
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,943
"Oh, he won't even
cast a glance at me"

905
01:22:44,023 --> 01:22:47,740
"Oh, he won't even
cast a glance at me"

906
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:51,940
"My husband has eyes
for the whole world.."

907
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:55,900
"but I'm the only one he
won't cast a glance at"

908
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:00,180
"Oh, he won't even
cast a glance at me"

909
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,180
May I come in, sir?
- Yes.

910
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:16,140
Come in, Mr. Sharma. I'm sorry, I
couldn't speak to you last night.

911
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,860
Please sit. Have you
come regarding the bill?

912
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,176
Who cares about the bill?

913
01:23:21,256 --> 01:23:24,020
I have get a very good
news for you.

914
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,900
That girl is found.
- Which girl?

915
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:30,820
The one who was involved with
the murder case in our hotel.

916
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,140
You found that girl?

917
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:40,420
Tukaram, get the Unique Hotel
murder case file immediately.

918
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,740
Alright.

919
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,940
Mr. Sharma, where did you see her?

920
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,180
I will tell you but I
should also get a reward for it.

921
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:53,300
Yes, of course! If it is that girl,
I will personally reward you.

922
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:58,660
Then listen, I saw that girl
last evening in your party.

923
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,740
In my party?
- Yes.

924
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,820
What is her name?
- I don't know, but..

925
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,740
I can describe her with
my photographic memory.

926
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:14,220
Fair complexion, big eyes,
beautiful body..

927
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:19,540
..she had worn big
earnings and a matching necklace..

928
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,940
..and a diamond nose pin!

929
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:29,020
Which colour sari was she wearing?
- It was a white 'Gharara suit'

930
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,700
She was very beautiful!

931
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:33,780
You idiot..

932
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,660
Do you know whom you
are talking about?

933
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,100
She is my wife!
- Your wife!?

934
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:43,300
Yes. - But how can it be possible?
I remember very well that..

935
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:52,260
But how can she be your wife?
I could possibly be wrong.

936
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,180
No. I'm sorry.
- Get out! Get out!

937
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,340
Sir, file..

938
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:39,820
You were in Kanpur for quite long.
- Yes, I went there only for 15 days.

939
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,900
But I fell sick
when I reached there.

940
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:46,100
Pick up the phone. Since morning
there have been many wrong numbers.

941
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,420
These Bombay phones are such!

942
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,580
Hello!
- Karuna..

943
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,740
Hello, Anand! This is Usha speaking.

944
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,420
How are you?.. Yes,
I will just call her.

945
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,860
Karuna, it's your wrong number!

946
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,420
Hello!
- Karuna.

947
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,940
Will you go out for a film?
- Film?

948
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,580
What is it, don't you have
work today that you thought of me?

949
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:18,260
Okay, listen, get Usha along.

950
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,420
I will reach by 3 O'clock sharp.

951
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,860
Oh my! Now why has this stopped?

952
01:26:56,740 --> 01:27:00,740
Why don't you sit close to him?
Looks like the engine has got cold!

953
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:03,100
Hey! I am talking about the car.

954
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:06,300
I think we should go by a taxi.

955
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,420
Let's go.
- Okay.

956
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:11,500
You're not taking us out willingly..

957
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,860
..if the beginning is such
the film will surely be a flop!

958
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:16,940
Never mind, I yet want to see it!

959
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,740
There is a taxi!

960
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,180
Is it engaged?
- No, sir.

961
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,260
Chandan cinema.
- Chandan cinema? Ok, sir.

962
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:40,009
You go ahead, I am coming.

963
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,820
Did you recognize?
- Yes.

964
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,380
Who was it?
- The one in red sari.

965
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:57,460
Are you sure?
- Yes! I had seen her very clearly.

966
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:03,500
You don't get passengers
everyday who give a big tip.

967
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:31,220
This handwriting does not
match with Karuna's handwriting.

968
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:35,260
I know it. How does it matter?

969
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,060
What are you saying!
She is innocent..

970
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,660
Sharma and Nafasat Ali's
identification can be wrong.

971
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,900
And yet you say, how does it matter?

972
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,340
There were many girls at the party..

973
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,300
..why did Sharma
point towards Karuna?

974
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:50,260
Why only her? Why did not
Nafasat Ali point at Usha..

975
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:54,260
But what about this writing? This
letter is not written by Karuna.

976
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,620
Letters can be written
by someone else also.

977
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:00,260
Are you mad?
- I am not mad.

978
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:05,020
You have not seen her nervousness.

979
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:09,580
I did not pay attention then.
But today if we believe that..

980
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:13,620
..she has killed him then, I
know the reason of her nervousness.

981
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,460
And if she actually
has done it then..

982
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,380
..she has deceived two
people at the same time.

983
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:26,020
She first kills her ex-lover..

984
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:32,020
..and after sometime, with the some
blood stained hands, she's weds me.

985
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,540
He keeps her husband in dark!

986
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:41,260
Just think, a girl who can
be so smart and clever..

987
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,940
..can't she tell someone
else to write her love letter?

988
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,860
Why don't you understand..

989
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,500
..if someone else
wrote those letters..

990
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,100
..then why would she
bother about those letters?

991
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,740
Why would she go to the
hotel on her wedding night?

992
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:58,260
Are you sure, she went
to take back her letters?

993
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,340
It could be that
along with the letters..

994
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:04,380
..there was something more some
photographs or something else.

995
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:08,020
Why are you seeing this
case with only one angle?

996
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:12,180
What is wrong with you? You
want to ruin the person you love?

997
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:18,220
Yes Vikram, I love her very much!

998
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:23,340
That is the tragedy of my life!
- Then end this tragedy.

999
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,940
Close the case.

1000
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,620
Retrace your steps. Or
your happiness will be..

1001
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,300
What life?

1002
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:37,140
The life which is full of
doubts is not worth living.

1003
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:43,100
When she's close to me, I'll
have only one question on my mind..

1004
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:46,700
..that is she a killer!

1005
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:53,780
No my friend, I will not be
able to go through that dilemma.

1006
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,060
It would be better that it
is decided once and for all.

1007
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,620
What kind of decision?

1008
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:04,700
The one last thing that will prove
her crime are her finger-prints.

1009
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:24,220
"I face a grave dilemma in life.."

1010
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:28,460
"how will I solve it?"

1011
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:34,060
"I face a grave dilemma in life.."

1012
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:38,420
"how will I solve it?"

1013
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:43,740
"My own sweetheart has
caused me so much of grief.."

1014
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:47,340
"how shall I explain it?"

1015
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:10,580
"Her promises of love have
turned out to be fake.."

1016
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:15,380
"Her promises of love have
turned out to be fake.."

1017
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:20,180
"my bond of faith
with her is severed"

1018
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:24,940
"my bond of faith
with her is severed"

1019
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:30,060
"As my companion for life.."

1020
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:34,780
"why is she robbing me of my peace?"

1021
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:39,300
"my bond of faith
with her is severed"

1022
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:46,220
"..to such a companion?

1023
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:58,540
"How can I ever be
loyal to such a companion?"

1024
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:04,460
"I face a grave crisis in life.."

1025
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:08,780
"how am I to solve it?"

1026
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:14,580
"I face a grave crisis in life.."

1027
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,700
Who is it? I am coming!

1028
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:33,020
Anand, you? Come in.
- Take this glass.

1029
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,900
It has some finger prints,
I need the prints urgently.

1030
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,500
You'll get it by afternoon.
- I say urgent.

1031
01:34:39,660 --> 01:34:42,020
I'm in the office, get the report.

1032
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:45,060
But it will take
some time for this work.

1033
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,140
What a strange man he his!

1034
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,220
Anand, the prints and
the report is ready.

1035
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,620
Keep it on the table.

1036
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,820
Won't you see it?
- I'll see it later?

1037
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:21,220
Then why did you keep me
awake the whole night?

1038
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:26,780
At least say sorry.
- Thanks for your work.

1039
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:57,780
"There are so many secrets.."

1040
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:02,740
"There are so many secrets.."

1041
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:07,100
"my destiny keeps from me"

1042
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:11,940
"my destiny keeps from me"

1043
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:21,740
"No one knows what
twist life might take"

1044
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:26,740
"..what twist life might take."

1045
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:32,820
"I cannot foresee what
destiny has in store for me.."

1046
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:41,980
"I cannot foresee what
destiny has in store for me.."

1047
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:46,940
"every moment, I dread
what might be unleashed on me"

1048
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:51,780
"I face a crisis in life.."

1049
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:56,340
"how am I to solve it?"

1050
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:01,780
"The anguish my dear
ones have caused me.."

1051
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:06,700
"I can barely speak about it"

1052
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,500
"I face a crisis in life.."

1053
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,740
You should feel
happy about your success.

1054
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,940
Why don't you arrest Karuna?

1055
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:26,420
So is the report..
- Didn't you see the report?

1056
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:30,940
These finger prints match
perfectly with those prints.

1057
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,340
These are the same fingerprints
found on the candle stand..

1058
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,940
..and the table.

1059
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,380
So what if the
domestic peace is ruined.

1060
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,820
For a honest inspector,
his duty is foremost.

1061
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:48,540
Your name and photograph will be
printed on the official gazette.

1062
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:52,220
Besides, it is not
easy to get a gold medal.

1063
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:59,900
But if you happen to see the death
of your love, then close your eyes?

1064
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:03,700
Vikram. - People don't
purposely ruin their own houses.

1065
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:08,060
I told you not to go ahead, Anand!

1066
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:12,420
It's yet not late. I am not a
police officer at this hour..

1067
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,180
I'm your friend. Listen to me..

1068
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:18,180
Burn the report and close the
case and forget about the murder.

1069
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:22,540
And forget about the murder in
the Hotel Unique. Please forget it!

1070
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:25,020
I request you to forget it.

1071
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,700
Shut up!

1072
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:36,100
Our daughter-in-law
and she.. It is a lie!

1073
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:39,260
Fingerprints never lie, sir!

1074
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:43,900
How did this happen?
What will brother think..

1075
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:49,700
What will happen to
our honour, your life?

1076
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,460
Why did this case come to us?

1077
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,660
O God! O God!

1078
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:04,900
Sir, we will have to arrest Karuna.

1079
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,300
I know. I know.

1080
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:12,380
It is very easy for
us to arrest others.

1081
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:17,100
But today, we have to
do it in our own house..

1082
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:22,060
Anyway, duty is duty.

1083
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:26,380
I will send Inspector
Wagle to arrest her.

1084
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:31,340
No sir, it's my case.

1085
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,980
I will arrest her.

1086
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,460
Today if I would ask for
anything from God, I would get it.

1087
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:07,540
I was thinking if you
would come early then I would..

1088
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:12,940
Hey! Why are you seeing? It is your
fault and you are getting angry?

1089
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,780
How innocent you act, Mr. ACP.

1090
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:27,580
Do you know that you
are going to be a father?

1091
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,100
Karuna. Karuna.

1092
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,940
Why, aren't you happy?

1093
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:02,500
Karuna.

1094
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:11,580
I have come to arrest you.
- Then do it!

1095
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:16,820
I have come to arrest you
for murdering Brij Bhushan!

1096
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:33,180
I did not know that the
woman whom I thought of us pure..

1097
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:36,900
..was actually a promiscuous woman.

1098
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:43,460
Why did you play with my life?

1099
01:42:44,143 --> 01:42:45,561
Answer me?

1100
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:01,900
Why are you crying, grandmother?

1101
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:06,940
What happened to her uncle?
- Nothing, son.

1102
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:17,620
Uncle, why is grandmother crying?

1103
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,460
Aunty, pacify grandmother.

1104
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:26,740
Mother!

1105
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,820
Inspector.

1106
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:45,700
No! Uncle, where are
you taking my aunty?

1107
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,340
Leave her alone.
Where are you taking her?

1108
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:53,140
I will not let her go, leave her!

1109
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:55,340
Let her go, son. Let her go.
- Leave her.

1110
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,500
Let her go. Let her go.
- Leave her.

1111
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,660
Sir.

1112
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,780
Munna, come here.

1113
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:04,460
Uncle, they are taking her.

1114
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:07,340
Stop them, uncle!

1115
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,660
Aunty!

1116
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:17,140
Aunty! Leave her.

1117
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:21,660
Aunty! Aunty! Aunty!

1118
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:37,980
I should be highly obliged if you
could send me the true copy of..

1119
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,300
Hello!

1120
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:45,540
Grandpa, they've taken aunty away!
- Who took whom away?

1121
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:48,340
The police took away aunt
in handcuffs.

1122
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:50,020
What are you talking about?

1123
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,540
Come back soon.
- Isn't your uncle there?

1124
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,740
He is there but, he is quiet
and grandmother is crying.

1125
01:44:56,820 --> 01:45:00,940
Please get my aunty back, quickly.
- Okay, I'll come soon.

1126
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,100
I'll see your file tomorrow.
You can go.

1127
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:19,860
Grandfather, the policemen
have taken aunty away. - Come.

1128
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:27,180
How did this happen?
Where is Karuna?

1129
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:31,380
Why don't you speak? Where is Anand?

1130
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:35,300
Anand.

1131
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,100
Where is Karuna?

1132
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:44,260
I asked where is she?

1133
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,500
Why don't you answer?

1134
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:55,980
That means, it all happened in
your presence, with your consent.

1135
01:45:56,180 --> 01:46:00,820
How dare you get the police here?
For which crime is she arrested?

1136
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:07,660
She is a murderer.
- What?

1137
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:14,540
Yes, she killed her ex-lover Brij
Bhushan on the night of the wedding.

1138
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,180
Aren't you ashamed
of accusing your wife?

1139
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:21,060
It is not a false accusation.
- How can you say that?

1140
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,340
I have witnesses and evidences,
She went to the hotel that night.

1141
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:31,780
We have a torn piece of her shawl,
which she was wearing that night.

1142
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,460
We have the candle stand with
which she killed Brij Bhushan.

1143
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:38,380
I have myself seen
her fingerprints on it.

1144
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:44,860
I wish I would turn blind
before seeing all this. - No!

1145
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:50,380
It is better to die
than live a shameful life.

1146
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,180
No!

1147
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,940
What is the point in
living life like this?

1148
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:59,300
People will taunt me and
ridicule me if I step out.

1149
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:03,700
You are ridiculing yourself, on
one side you are weeping for her.

1150
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:06,020
On other side, you are
pushing her towards death.

1151
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,620
She is not innocent!
- Anand.

1152
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:10,580
I have been associated
with criminals..

1153
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:12,060
..for years more than your age!

1154
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:16,220
I have seen the murderers very
closely, I know their behavior..

1155
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:21,540
I know every act of theirs and you
are teaching me about criminals?

1156
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,780
My experience says
that she is innocent..

1157
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:25,860
..and I have
confidence on my experience!

1158
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:41,300
I am coming inside.

1159
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:49,100
God bless you, dear.

1160
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:54,660
Child, don't worry about anything,
everything will be fine.

1161
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:56,620
I'm there with you.

1162
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,340
I am here to protect you.

1163
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:03,780
Listen child, tell my..

1164
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:07,380
..why did you kill
him did he deceive you?

1165
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,500
No, I had no relation with him.

1166
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:15,340
Then inspite of that, you
wrote love letters to him?

1167
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,540
No, I did not write
any letters to him.

1168
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,380
You did not write?
- No!

1169
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,340
I see.

1170
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:26,940
That means, it was someone else's
letter's which you went to take.

1171
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:34,260
Please tell me child,
whose letters were they?

1172
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:41,380
It is necessary for me to know it,
it'll always be a secret between us.

1173
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:45,180
No father, I have promised someone.

1174
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,180
I see.

1175
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,620
Okay child, sign here and
write anything you wish.

1176
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,820
I want a sample of your writing.

1177
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,260
Brother.

1178
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,300
Mr. Deputy Commissioner of Police.

1179
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,940
These are the court orders, I
have got her bail sanctioned.

1180
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:15,660
I have come to take her.
- But please sit, brother.

1181
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:19,020
Don't call be brother!
I don't have a brother.

1182
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:21,620
You ask for a remand in the court.

1183
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:25,340
The whole police department
wants to punish an innocent girl.

1184
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:31,820
You can try what you want. But I
will see how you can punish her?

1185
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,380
Brother.

1186
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:37,420
You are just on DCP, you
have no relation with anyone.

1187
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,420
Karuna is not related to you?
- Will you break off all the ties?

1188
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:43,340
Will you snatch the right to
call her my daughter in law?

1189
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:47,620
Enough! I am taking her home.
Instruct them to release her.

1190
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:54,940
Son.

1191
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:58,820
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday, eat these fruits.

1192
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,180
Eat them uncle, or else
even grandmother won't eat.

1193
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:06,900
No mother, I don't feel like it.

1194
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:09,780
Jeetu, get our baggage.

1195
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:25,020
How did this happen?
We couldn't believe it.

1196
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:27,220
We came here immediately.

1197
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:34,860
Brother, what is all this?
How did you let it happen?

1198
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:38,820
Brother, get Karuna back.

1199
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:41,980
Don't shed tears for a killer.

1200
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,060
Brother, even you are blaming her?

1201
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:48,060
She is not at fault,
she is innocent, brother.

1202
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:53,660
Madam, master has got
Karuna madam back home.

1203
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,860
Kamla.

1204
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:00,060
Munna.

1205
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:02,620
Look whom I have got.
- Aunty!

1206
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,620
Aunty.

1207
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,100
When did you come, Deepak?

1208
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:16,500
Kamla.

1209
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:18,780
Yes. - Won't you meet
your sister in law?

1210
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,660
Karuna.

1211
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,460
Kamla, take her upstairs.

1212
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:43,900
Come.

1213
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:54,060
What is this? She has come
back and everyone looks so sullen?

1214
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:57,660
She is a murderer and we
are not concerned with her.

1215
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:59,900
I can't see it anymore..

1216
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:04,060
..I cannot bear my brother
tarnishing your character.

1217
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,340
I will tell everyone that I
had written those letters.

1218
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:10,340
I had a relation with Brij.
- No, you will not say that.

1219
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:11,860
Why can't I?

1220
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:16,260
Due to my mistake, you are standing
on the cross road of your life.

1221
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:20,140
And you want me to
be a silent spectator?

1222
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:25,220
Try to forget your small
mistake is my this big crime!

1223
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:30,300
Let this carry on!

1224
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:34,940
Nobody will ever learn the truth.

1225
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:38,180
Everybody's welfare lies in this!

1226
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,460
Karuna.

1227
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:45,260
You are not just a woman,
you are a goddess!

1228
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:49,140
If you think she is a goddess then,
build a temple for her.

1229
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,900
But she cannot live here.
- Did you get this house in your dowry?

1230
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,740
I have worked hard
to make this house!

1231
01:52:56,820 --> 01:53:00,460
But now I can only
sense hatred in this house.

1232
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:02,940
I don't want to live here myself.

1233
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,460
Come down quickly, Karuna.

1234
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:11,540
The injustice that you are
doing with someone's daughter..

1235
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:14,260
God forbid, if the same
thing happens to Kamla..

1236
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,900
..and her in law's..
- Don't speak about Kamla.

1237
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:21,700
If I learn that my wife is a
killer and a character less woman..

1238
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:23,380
..then I will not even
go close to her shadow.

1239
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:27,380
You're accusing my daughter-in-law!
- You are also evading the truth.

1240
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:32,700
Deepak is right. Didn't she write
those love letters to Brij Bhushan?

1241
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,940
Didn't she go to
Hotel Unique that night?

1242
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:37,900
If the need arises, I'll
answer your question in the court.

1243
01:53:37,980 --> 01:53:41,980
And Mr. ACP, this is
Karuna's handwriting sample.

1244
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:46,820
Before slandering her character,
match the handwriting.

1245
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:51,260
I have done it.
- And yet..

1246
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:54,340
I see.

1247
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:58,100
Come on, child.
- Grandfather, I'll join you too.

1248
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:00,140
Okay. Let's go, child.

1249
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,860
Sit child!

1250
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:21,540
Father!

1251
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:26,340
Father!
- What are the newspapers saying?

1252
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:29,460
I read it in Benaras and
come back immediately.

1253
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:32,620
How did this all happen?

1254
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:36,940
Don't worry, I will try my best
to prove that she is innocent.

1255
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:39,900
Inspite of all this,
you are supporting her?

1256
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:43,220
You are great!
I am the thankful to you.

1257
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:45,740
It is my duty.
- Where is Anand?

1258
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:48,940
I am sorry. I can't invite you in.

1259
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:51,140
We have left this house.
- What?

1260
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:54,780
Are you doing all
this for my daughter?

1261
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:57,140
She is my daughter too.

1262
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,900
Please come with me.

1263
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:04,140
Don't refuse, I am
an ordinary person..

1264
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:08,100
I cannot force you.
But I can plead to you.

1265
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:11,940
Don't embarrass me! Okay, we
will go with you. Come child.

1266
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:18,940
I agree that Brij
Bhushan tried to assault you..

1267
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:21,500
..and you killed him
in self protection.

1268
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:24,460
But there is no eye
witness to that incident.

1269
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:28,780
That is why, we have to prove
that he could attempt an assault.

1270
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:31,340
Because he was a rogue
and a promiscuous man.

1271
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:36,020
And for that, we need the girl
whose letter you went to take.

1272
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:39,540
The entire case
depends on that girl..

1273
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:42,140
..and you don't want to
reveal her name? But why?

1274
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:46,020
How can I express my helplessness.

1275
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:50,860
All if know that my our
people have disowned me..

1276
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:54,980
..and by disclosing her name,
why should I ruin her happiness?

1277
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:57,500
Why should her
family's honour be tarnished?

1278
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:03,420
So you are concerned about her
happiness but not your old father?

1279
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,700
You are no concerned with
the honour of our family?

1280
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:11,580
That's not right. I can
give my life for your honour.

1281
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:14,100
You can give your life
but to save that honour..

1282
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:16,340
..you cannot
disclose your friend's name.

1283
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:20,460
My daughter-in-law is proven as
a murderer and goes to the jail..

1284
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:24,060
..the whole city laughs at us,
but you will not tell her name.

1285
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:28,340
I cannot tell you, father.

1286
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:31,980
If not for yourself,
think about your husband.

1287
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:35,180
He is very sad, aren't
you concerned about him?

1288
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:44,660
Think of the future of the child,
who is yet to be born.

1289
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,460
Do you want the world to point to
him, and say he's a killer's child?

1290
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:49,860
No!

1291
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,580
If I was in your place,
I would kill my child.

1292
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:55,460
No!

1293
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:05,780
I thought that she
would tell me the name.

1294
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:08,460
And I will win the case.

1295
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:13,460
But now I think that
there is no chance.

1296
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:18,180
The question is not whether she
killed Mr. Brij Bhushan or not?

1297
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:23,820
All the witness and evidences,
even the accused herself,..

1298
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:26,020
.. claims that she murdered him.

1299
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:29,300
That is why the question is that..

1300
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:32,523
..under what circumstances
was a decent man..

1301
01:57:32,603 --> 01:57:34,100
..like Brij Bhushan murdered?

1302
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:38,500
If she committed the
murder in self defence..

1303
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:42,100
..then why didn't she surrender
herself to the law that time?

1304
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:48,620
If she was innocent and
true then what was the fear?

1305
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:52,580
Why didn't she admit her
crime that minute itself?

1306
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,740
Your honor..

1307
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:57,380
It is a very
courageous task that a girl..

1308
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:02,340
..breaks the head if an innocent
man, wounds him, kills him..

1309
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:07,340
..and very quietly
comes for her own marriage.

1310
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:10,340
She has no fear of any
law or the punishment.

1311
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:15,460
Inspite of knowing that her
would be husband is a CID inspector.

1312
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:21,140
She should be applauded
because after committing a murder..

1313
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:27,300
..she could live like an ideal wife
with her husband and his family.

1314
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:30,580
And that too, not for a day or
two but, for months together!

1315
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:33,660
And at a time..

1316
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:39,540
..when she learnt the
progress of the case!

1317
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:45,940
But she was not affected and
carried out her act of innocence.

1318
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:50,380
She was so smart right
from the beginning..

1319
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,780
..that she herself
didn't write her letters..

1320
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:56,740
..so that she
shouldn't be caught in future.

1321
01:58:56,820 --> 01:59:00,980
Taking advantage of that,
she has stated that..

1322
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:03,580
..she had no
relation with Brij Bhushan.

1323
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:09,860
She had gone to take her
friend's love letters from him.

1324
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:16,020
If we agree this for
sometime then it is obvious that..

1325
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:22,860
..they are very thick friends
and are very close to each other.

1326
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:26,379
But what friendship is this that..

1327
01:59:26,459 --> 01:59:31,900
..one is willing to be
sentenced for life..

1328
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:35,740
..and the other one is watching
her going through this problem!

1329
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:42,380
What friendship is it that one
friend, or her wedding night..

1330
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:47,820
..to save her friend's honour,
gets into trouble herself.

1331
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:54,060
And the other one has no desire
to help her in the time of need?

1332
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:56,620
Isn't there any
humanity within that friend?

1333
01:59:56,700 --> 02:00:00,860
There cannot be any such friend..

1334
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:06,820
..who is willing to do this!

1335
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:12,500
There can't be any friend who in
spite of her sacrifice is quiet!

1336
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:15,420
Your honor..
- Judge..

1337
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:19,020
What happened? How did she fall?
- She has fainted!

1338
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:21,780
She has fainted. We will
take her home. - I'll also come.

1339
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:25,140
Your honour, she has fainted.

1340
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:28,180
I request the court to
adjourn the court for sometime.

1341
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:31,500
Alright. The court is
adjourned till 3 p.m.

1342
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:32,860
Thank you, your honor.

1343
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:51,900
Stop the car, turn
it towards the office.

1344
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:00,780
Yes, sir.

1345
02:01:00,860 --> 02:01:03,580
Get my personal letters file,
quickly. - Yes, sir.

1346
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:15,100
Her pressure is very high. She
has perhaps fainted due to shock.

1347
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,580
I will give her an injection.

1348
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,340
If the pressure doesn't come
down we'll have..

1349
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:20,060
..to take her to the hospital.

1350
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:23,900
Sir, it is the master's call.

1351
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:31,980
What happened, aren't
you feeling all right?

1352
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:40,020
This is Kamla's letter and here's
the photo-copy of the other letter.

1353
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:42,260
Match both the writings.

1354
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:51,300
Oh no!

1355
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,020
That means, Kamla had a
relation with Brij Bhushan?

1356
02:01:57,220 --> 02:02:00,460
Yes, now do you know
why he fainted.

1357
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:05,020
She must be going through this
turmoil the day Karuna got arrested.

1358
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:08,820
And today in the court, when
her conscience was shaken..

1359
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:11,060
She couldn't bear it and fainted.

1360
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:15,940
You know that she is a
very weak minded person.

1361
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:21,580
And I accused that poor
girl of such a big crime?

1362
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,820
She did such a great thing for us!

1363
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:30,940
I am not even fit to
beg for forgiveness.

1364
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:36,980
Yes son, she was saving
our honour all this while.

1365
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,100
What will you do now?

1366
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:44,860
To prove Karuna innocent..

1367
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,420
..we will have to
present Kamla in the court.

1368
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:55,180
What are you thinking?

1369
02:02:56,500 --> 02:03:00,860
I am thinking, to save
Kamla from being defamed..

1370
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,780
..Karuna went
through so many problems..

1371
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:07,220
.. and faced humiliation.

1372
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:09,980
But today it is all wasted.

1373
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:18,380
There is no other alternative.
it is our daughter's fault.

1374
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,060
She will only have to atone for it.

1375
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:30,660
Hello! - Kamla is not regaining her
senses, the doctor cannot diagnose.

1376
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:35,980
Please call some other doctor.
- Okay, I will send Anand.

1377
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:40,460
Go home, Anand.
Your mother is worried about Kamla.

1378
02:03:57,620 --> 02:04:01,140
Mr. Mehra, do you
have to speak anymore?

1379
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:11,020
Yes, Your Honor! My argument
is not yet over. - Go ahead!

1380
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:15,660
The defence consul is not
present perhaps his daughter..

1381
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:17,220
Here, he is!

1382
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,740
Sorry.

1383
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:36,500
Mr. Kailash Chandra..

1384
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:39,820
Please sit, so that we can proceed.

1385
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:48,500
Mr. Kailash Chandra.

1386
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:52,980
Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.. Yes.

1387
02:04:57,820 --> 02:05:00,660
Your Honor, I have come
to know of a witness..

1388
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:03,660
..who can bring
a twist in the case.

1389
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,660
I..

1390
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:14,740
I would request the court to give
me a day to present this witness.

1391
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:18,060
Who and where is your witness?

1392
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:22,620
Your honour, my witness is..
- Your Honor..

1393
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:30,060
Your Honor, I have
witness who can prove that..

1394
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:33,940
..the deceased Brij
Bhushan was a licentious man.

1395
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:43,860
I request the court to
permit me to present the witness.

1396
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:49,460
What're you doing? You're presenting
a witness against the state?

1397
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:51,580
Don't forget that you
are a government servant.

1398
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:54,300
Don't talk about my job.

1399
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:58,300
If my job creates a
hindrance in the way of justice..

1400
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,740
..then I resign right now.

1401
02:06:01,460 --> 02:06:05,900
Your honour, please permit my
witness to give her statement.

1402
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:09,340
This is wrong and against
the proceedings of the court.

1403
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,180
I raise a point of objection.

1404
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:14,980
Mr. Mehra, it's within
the means of the court..

1405
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,740
..to take anybody's
statement at anytime.

1406
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,420
Objection over ruled!

1407
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:21,500
Call the witness.
- Thank you, your honor.

1408
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:32,660
What is this, Vikram?
Why have you got her here?

1409
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:35,740
Uncle, she told me
everything sometime back.

1410
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:39,420
When I learnt, I thought there was
no other way to solve this problem.

1411
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:43,020
No uncle, you please
take her statement.

1412
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,220
Usha.

1413
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,300
Please, uncle.. Take her statement.

1414
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:52,740
I will speak nothing but the truth!

1415
02:06:58,260 --> 02:06:59,700
Your name?

1416
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:01,420
Usha Kapoor.

1417
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:04,940
Did you know Brij Bhushan?
- Yes!

1418
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,860
Since when?
- Since 2 years.

1419
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:14,420
I loved him!

1420
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:20,820
Did he also love you?

1421
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:23,780
That's what he always said.

1422
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:27,580
But I learnt later
that he was deceiving me.

1423
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,340
How?

1424
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:33,100
Our love had crossed
the limits of decency..

1425
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:36,500
..which an unmarried and a
decent girl shouldn't do.

1426
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:41,220
You mean that..
- I mean that, I..

1427
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:45,180
I was carrying his child.

1428
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:53,980
Did Brij Bhushan know this?
- No, I spoke to him of marriage.

1429
02:07:54,980 --> 02:07:57,300
But he always avoided me.

1430
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:00,980
I feared that my
brother would learn if it.

1431
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:06,100
But that evening I had decided
to convince him about marriage.

1432
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:10,340
That is why, on the 24th March
evening, I went to his hotel.

1433
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,140
Which day?
- 24th March.

1434
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:14,260
Which hotel?
- Hotel Unique.

1435
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,660
What was the time.
- 7.45 p.m.

1436
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:23,660
Your honour, please note, March 24,
Hotel Unique and time, 7.45 p.m.

1437
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:28,340
What was he doing when you went there?
- He was drinking.

1438
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:33,940
I again spoke about
marriage and he tried to evade it.

1439
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:36,620
But I was persistent.

1440
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:43,340
If you don't marry me,
I will consume poison.

1441
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:46,940
Oh, my God! I am
fed up with all this.

1442
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:50,260
Go ahead and have it in
your house. Don't eat my head!

1443
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:55,060
Brij.

1444
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:01,740
Usha. Darling, I am sorry.

1445
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:05,420
But dear, why don't you understand?

1446
02:09:05,820 --> 02:09:07,780
I have an important work today.

1447
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:12,020
I am expecting an important guest.
You please go home.

1448
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,980
Come on, love.
- Who is it?

1449
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:16,140
How are you concerned?

1450
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:18,740
Do I have to tell
you about business?

1451
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:20,500
Come on, darling. Be good.

1452
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,900
Come. Come on.

1453
02:09:24,740 --> 02:09:28,380
I will not go. I know
your work very well.

1454
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:33,780
You must have called a girl
and must be cheating on her also.

1455
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:37,380
You must have promised marriage
to her also. I will not leave!

1456
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,140
I will expose you to her.

1457
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,580
Brij.

1458
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:06,540
I don't know how
long I was unconscious.

1459
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:09,820
But when I came into senses,
I was feeling dizzy.

1460
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:13,060
I could hear noises
in the other room.

1461
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:31,900
I saw from the key hole.
- Leave me!

1462
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:35,860
Who was she the girl
Brij was trying to molest?

1463
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:40,060
I tried to open the door but
it was locked from outside.

1464
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:45,420
I saw again, but I
could not see her face.

1465
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:49,860
I wanted to bang the door,
but I stopped.

1466
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:55,220
I feared of being
exposed and defamed.

1467
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:57,660
Then I saw once again..

1468
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:14,900
Brij was wounded and he fell down.

1469
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:20,740
And when I learnt that he
was dead, I was very happy.

1470
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:24,580
A wretched man like him
should have met such an end only.

1471
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,340
Mr. Mehra..

1472
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:39,180
Ms. Kapoor, you just told
the court that you loved him.

1473
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:42,260
Can you give a proof of it?

1474
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:50,020
I think these photographs
will suffice as evidence.

1475
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:59,460
You just said that he
locked you in the bathroom?

1476
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:00,820
Yes.

1477
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:03,300
Then how did you come out?

1478
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:07,540
Did the police remove you out
or the hotel staff helped you?

1479
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,860
Are you a public prosecutor?

1480
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:14,860
Wouldn't you know
if I was helped out?

1481
02:12:16,529 --> 02:12:17,523
Order!

1482
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:22,260
Give me a correct answer,
how did you come out?

1483
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:27,180
If you see the suite number 417
of that hotel, you'll know it.

1484
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:31,580
The other door was fortunately open.

1485
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:33,900
I see.

1486
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:38,260
You said that you
were carrying his child.

1487
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,580
Then where is that child?

1488
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:48,940
If it was a proof of love,
it would be alive.

1489
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:56,940
I had been to my aunt's place,
I slipped suddenly and..

1490
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:03,700
If you want you can get the
report from the nursing home.

1491
02:13:04,740 --> 02:13:06,140
Any other question?

1492
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:08,100
That's all, Your Honor.

1493
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:19,180
You could have hidden your
shameful story that you just said.

1494
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:22,260
You belong to a decent family..

1495
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:26,660
..then why did you
want to get defamed?

1496
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:33,300
It was not easy for me
to speak in the court.

1497
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:37,260
I had to struggle a lot with myself.

1498
02:13:37,940 --> 02:13:41,900
But when the public prosecutor..

1499
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,380
..used to praise
Brij's character and deeds..

1500
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:50,420
I wished to get up and
say that it was a lie.

1501
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:54,220
Don't tarnish decency
by calling him decent.

1502
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:59,540
It was not a crime to
kill a monster like Brij.

1503
02:14:00,580 --> 02:14:06,860
It was a good deed. I feel
sorry that I couldn't do it.

1504
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:12,140
Your witness, Mr. Mehra.

1505
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,100
I have no further question.

1506
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:31,660
Ms. Usha Kapoor's statement has
given a new twist to this case.

1507
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:37,860
Which proves that the deceased Brij
Bhushan was a character less man.

1508
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:43,740
He was fond of playing with
the lives of innocent girls.

1509
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:50,260
And that night, if Karuna
wouldn't save herself from him..

1510
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:52,860
..then she would
fall prey to his lust.

1511
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:56,660
She did it in her self defence.

1512
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:03,140
That is why, this court announces
Karuna innocent and releases her.

1513
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:10,180
Uncle, aunty has come!
Grandfather has got her.

1514
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:14,500
Grandmother, aunty has come.
My aunty has come!

1515
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:18,780
She is also regaining her senses.
- Where is she?

1516
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:20,260
Downstairs!

1517
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:26,980
How is Kamla?
- She is fine but..

1518
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:30,460
how did you release Karuna
without Kamla's statement?

1519
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:32,740
I will tell you later.

1520
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:37,500
Listen, Kamla wasn't exposed and the
matter should always remain closed.

1521
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:40,780
We are not aware, do
you understand? - Yes!

1522
02:15:41,420 --> 02:15:44,020
Don't look at me,
Karuna is waiting, go.

1523
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:45,500
Go.

1524
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:15,300
Karuna.

1525
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:20,820
I don't know how to apologise,
Karuna.

1526
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:24,392
Don't say anything!

1527
02:16:36,832 --> 02:16:38,294
Kamla.

1528
02:16:43,362 --> 02:16:45,119
Kamla.
- Karuna.
