'He suspects they may be involved

00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,578
Blasted rain!

6
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,587
Where can I leave her
for a while?!

7
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,384
Stand here
I'll be right back

8
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,389
Don't go anywhere, okay?

9
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,043

00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,645
Ouch! Would have
burnt myself now

12
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,516
1 tea, bro

13
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,682
Sit down

14
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,754
Started again!

15
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,121
The minute they have an audience
they begin showing off

16
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,630
Things are so expensive these days

17
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,098
' Hell you!
- Yes?

18
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,198
- Speed! They are too fast
- Yes! You bet!

00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,244
Ouch!

20
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,481
What the hell?!
Take it away, boy

21
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,252
What's wrong
with these fellows?

22
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,621
Audacity, that's what it is

23
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,786
What are you gaping at?
Move, man

24
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,595
What a performance!
My eyes popped out

25
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,598
This is nothing

26
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,157
There's another chap
who rides a Duke

27
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,225
My eyes popped out
seeing his stunt

28
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,608
Hey! Go away, guys

29
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,673
Those crackpots are
on their way here...scoot!

30
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,588
Scoundrel!

31
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,131
You'll learn only if you fall
and break your legs

32
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,102
What did you say?

33
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,304
You would have been plastered
on the road if I hadn't swerved

34
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,368
You dare curse me?

35
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,506
I won't get hurt
with such curses

36
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,073
Do you know from
when I've been revving?

37
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,714
This is not confidence
It's my arrogance

38
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,009
Oh God!

39
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,234
Mother!

40
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,308
I warned you many times

41
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,614
If this is the way you behave
I'll discharge you right away

42
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,209
You think you can misbehave
just because it's a Govt hospital?

43
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,018
Fall and break you limbs somewhere
Then come here to trouble us

44
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,520
What the heck are you doing?
Don't you know this is a hospital?

45
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,462
I can't sleep
because of the pain

46
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,689
And the mosquitoes
sketch a pattern all over me

47
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,197
I smoked to chase
the mosquitoes away

00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,132
'Astrology'

49
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,365
Smoke in some places
Ashes all over the place

50
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,634
What is happening to people?

51
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:28,237
Must be the fire inside
that book causing the smoke

52
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,579
My job is to sell tickets
illegally at the theatre

53
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,143
Don't try to pull a fast one on me

54
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,479
- Fraud Swamiji!
- Get lost, mongrel

55
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,144
You have an injection

56
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,353
Not on your arm

57
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,117
On your buttocks
Turn around

58
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,090
Lower my underwear, Sister

59
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,023
No need! Plenty of holes
for the needle to go in

60
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,458
It was a new one
But I don't know...

61
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,694
...how it became
hole-ridden so soon

62
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,402
My poor bum!

63
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,028
There are many patients in here

64
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,629
Next time you want
to smoke, go outside

65
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,072
That was exactly
why I called you

66
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,335
To help me

67
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,240
Call your wife to do it

68
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,209
Such a prude!

69
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,144
Hey! What happened to you?

70
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,203
You mean this?

71
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,444
I walked over a few people to
get tickets for a Mohan Lal film

72
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,647
One wretched fellow moved away
and my leg went for a toss

73
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,224
Hey nurse! Don't think
I can't go without your help

74
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,693
This is not confidence
This is my arrogance

75
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,664
Going by his arrogance
both his legs must be broken

76
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,599
Be quiet, you dog!

77
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,729
Sister, we haven't as yet got
our daily quota of egg and milk

78
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,535
Consider yourself lucky
you got a bed here

79
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,066
Whatever we do, they never
have a good word for us

80
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,607
What do you lack here?

81
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,306
We lack smiles

82
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,216
If only the nurses here smiled
half our illness will vanish into thin air

83
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,549
Help me!
I fell down

84
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,556
That's what happens
if you call a holy man a fraud

85
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,726
Can't you lie there quietly?

86
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,824
Look now! I had to
come and help you

87
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,086
That's exactly why I fell down

88
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,598
What happened to you, son?

89
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,827
I fell from a bike

90
00:10:59,091 --> 00:10:59,831
It skid

91
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,335
Bhai, you fell from a bike?

92
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,999
Do you know who he is?

93
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,603
A well-known bike rider who takes part
in races at Fort Kochi, Madras and Maradu

94
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,341
I find it hard to believe
he fell from a bike

95
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,049
It was no ordinary fall

96
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:16,677
Then?

97
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,483
It's a long story

98
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,581
Doesn't matter
Narrate it as a short story

99
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,183
Be quiet, man
Anyway we've lost our sleep

100
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,092
Don't shorten it
Go ahead, full throttle

101
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,631
Can I also listen to the story?

102
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,165
Why are you all still awake?
It's past midnight

103
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,394
There she starts again!

104
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,095
Don't mind her
Just tell us the story, bhai

105
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,369
How can a mere fall from a bike
be such a dramatic story?

106
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,510
This is not a story
It really happened

107
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,351
<i>'This is our own Koch?</i>

108
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,250
Hey! Go away
with your camera

109
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,228
You have spread
enough stories about Kochi

110
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,461
Come out with
something new, dude

111
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,467
Okay, then why not
call it Ernakulum?

112
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,165
Kochi is not full of murderers
and freaks like they show in films

113
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,266
Most people who live here
are middle class like us

114
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,277
1st let me introduce my friends

115
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,438
Otherwise my story
will come to a standstill

116
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,444
'Meet him
A smart boy'

117
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,077
Lord! Only Rs 100

118
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,513
Please ensure she doesn't
splurge and ruin my day

119
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,261
Where were you?

120
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,361
I was delayed at work

121
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,061
Today is my treat
for your birthday

122
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,399
Let's go in here

123
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,168
We go here all the time

124
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,709
It's your birthday
We'll go to a special place

125
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,372
Where?
Tell me, Anthony

126
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,446
I'll tell you
as we go over there

127
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,046
Here?

128
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,444
Not this
Somewhere much better

129
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,320
- There?
- On top of this too

130
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,255
Come

131
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,195
Sir, what do you want?

132
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,499
2 coffee and 2 cutlets

133
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,282
Cut the cutlet
Coffee will do

134
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,442
This is not a hotel
It's a furniture shop

135
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,422
How much does
this table cost?

136
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,727
'Someone had abandoned him
at a theater when he was a baby'

137
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,398
'Chakappan'chetan who had
come to see the film 'Thalapathi'...'

138
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,454
'...took him home'

139
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,468
'Everyone called him Dhalapathy <i>'</i>

140
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,098
Sweetie pie!

141
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,636
'I'll introduce you
to the next person'

142
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,546
'Meet him, he is
the mischievous one'

143
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,767
Give me way, please

144
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,260
Which number to press?

145
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,361
9...8...4...6

146
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,403
Sounds like a mobile number

147
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,440
Move, brother

148
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,533
This won't move
unless the button is pressed

149
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,640
- ls the doctor here?
- He's on leave

150
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,703
Wish I was a doc-

151
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,046
Hey! Out to kill me?

152
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,478
Get in

153
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,384
What are you up to?

154
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,315
It's over loaded now

155
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,190
You get out

156
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,195
You are not needed
on the top floor

157
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,298
This won't go up
unless I'm here

158
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,263
Some guys are perverts
Even a poster is enough!

159
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,399
'Breast milk'

160
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,415
Only now it is stuck properly

161
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,053
Poor chap, dad
He's handicapped

162
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,319
What did you say?
I'm handicapped?

163
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,289
Get me married
to your daughter

164
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,489
After 10 months she will
be sitting there like her

165
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,053
Only my leg is affected, okay?

166
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,291
Doling out pity on me?!

167
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,230
Akbar

168
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,259

Only son of Stalin Mammali

'Red salute'

00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,405
'It's not his leftist views

'He was afflicted by polio'

172
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,743
What happened?

173
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,383
Everyone has ups and downs
in their lives

174
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,351
'He goes through it every day'

175
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,013
'Because he is a lift operator!'

176
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,419
- ls his fate sealed?
- Not yet

177
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,356
It will be, when he sees
the hospital bill!

178
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,583
- Going to the mortuary?
- No, 1st floor

179
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,560
All the same

180
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,524
'Now we'll get to
know his parents'

181
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,396
- Mother
- What?

182
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,527
Did you see my-

183
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,195
Hey! This is for your father
Your black tea is in the kitchen

184
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,538
At this rate father will
burst a muscle and die

185
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,611
God!

186
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,148
Will you please feed it to me?

187
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,982
'Meet my next friend'

188
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,322
'Smartest of the lot'

189
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,449
'Who does he think he is?
Mega star in films, Prithviraj?'

190
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,618
'Plingr

191
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,091
I thought you said
all were middle class chaps?

192
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,490
Bhai, you are kidding, eh?

193
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,621
Let me finish, dude

194
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,658
Those are his aspirations

195
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,190
But what he actually drives
is a superb vehicle

196
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,608
- Are you afraid of speed?
- No

197
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,611
Is this what you drive?

198
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,740
Didn't you say you were a pilot?

199
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,574
When I get free time, I also-

200
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,680
Can you please park this airplane
a little away so we can pass through?

201
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,359
Shame on you!
Pilot, it seems

202
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,095
Amar

203
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,430
Amarnath

204
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,361
Who is Amalnath living
in the same address?

205
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,667
He's my younger brother

206
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,003
Father's name?

207
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,167
Ramanan

208
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,608
Anyone in need of money...

209
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,448
...comes running to me

210
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,106
What is your father's occupation?

211
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,514
A watchman at this ATM

212
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,147
He is a bit conscious of his looks

213
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,621
'This program was sponsored by...'

214
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
'...Lens and Frames'

215
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,662
'lndulekha Bhringa oil'
For hair fall and peace of mind'

216
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,290
'Colgate, #1 brand
recommended by dentists'

217
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,301
'Freedom from germs!

218
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,504
Switch off that damn TV

219
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,238
And your mother?

220
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,435
- How old are you?
- 32

221
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,770
Don't worry

222
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,742
Everything will soon be fine

223
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,146
- What is your star?
- Taurus

224
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,715
I want your photo also

225
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,748
The groom is a doctor too

226
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,383
32 years is not something
you should be defensive about

227
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,620
I will soon get you married

228
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:25,098
There hasn't been any issues
in any of the alliances I've fixed

229
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,661
If you have any doubts
enquire at Girinagar colony

230
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,172
See you, okay?

231
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:36,204
Don't go in for too detailed
an enquiry, okay?

232
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,581
'Like any other ordinary family
avail petty loans...'

233
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,246
'...eat sumptuously on weekends
and live contentedly'

234
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,118
'A happy family'

235
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,319
Wait! Hold on

236
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,223
Who is that veiled girl
in their family photo?

237
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,329
That is the girl whose marriage
Chandrika chechi had arranged

238
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,558
'An orphan girl Resmina'

239
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,135
'Her marriage expenses were met by
the mosque and donations from people'

240
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,498
Look! He is a fine boy

241
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,666
Aren't you happy?
Now look up

242
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,765
You too

243
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:11,279
'But the groom she got for Resmina
stole all her jewelry and vamoosed'

244
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,010
God!

245
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,382
'That very day she shifted residence
to Chandrika chechi's house'

246
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,087
Her husband whisked her gold

247
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,419
But left her holding a baby

248
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,087
Amar, Akbar and Anthony
are like usual boys their age

249
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,065
They walk in and out
of malls and window shop

250
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,662
'Bargain and buy
at roadside shops'

251
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,707
'Save money and go for tours to
places like Nelliampathy and Munnar'

252
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,304
'They have no idea
if vegetables cost more'

253
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,571
'Or the quota for cylinders
used for cooking'

254
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,241
'They don't even know who
India's Prime Minister is'

255
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,547
- Don't make us so cheap
- We are not so dumb

256
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,814
Who is it then?

257
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,350
Isn't it Narendra Prasad?!

258
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,481
- That's correct, isn't it?
- Must be!

259
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,589
'But in spite of all this they were
very focused about one thing'

260
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,459
'For the past 2 years
they are saving up for this'

261
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,591
'They are hand and glove about this'

262
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,094
A tour to Pattaya beach in Thailand

263
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,102
it was their dream destination

264
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,335
And it's an open secret boys don't
go to Pattaya to eat rice and dhal!

265
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,544
But God does not allow life to
endorse one's dreams all the time

266
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,778
Likewise their lives also
underwent a change

267
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,422
An incident that turned
their world upside down

268
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,030
Goodness gracious!

269
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,299
Where is that photo
of Mathai's daughter?

270
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,702
Look inside 'Ramayana' book

271
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,467
Mathai's daughter in 'Ramayana'?

272
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,338
I left it there myself
Absent-mindedly

273
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,502
I promised to go there
with this photo today

274
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,808
Dear God! If this clicks
I can make some money

275
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,610
This boy watches
only English movies!

276
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,748
My teacher says, watch
English films to learn English

277
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,149
Which teacher asked you
to watch it without sound?

278
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,217
Go to school, kiddo!

279
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,285
Why are all of you
harassing me?

280
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,161
Did mother buy me
from the market?

281
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,294
If that was the case
I would've bought a good one

282
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,634
Are you trying
your Wha1sApp jokes on me!

283
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,191
My dear boy
Isn't it salary day today?

284
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,424
I was talking to you
Will you get your pay today?

285
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,789
You mongrel!
I was talking to you

286
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,090
You won't get
a paisa from my salary

287
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,604
You are always spending it on
some marriage, baby shower...

288
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,072
...house warming and
using up all my money

289
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,109
This time we will go
for that tour we planned

290
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,408
Gracious me!
I don't want your money

291
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,674
Who wants your
niggardly money?!

292
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,139
Hey you buffalo!

293
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,378
When is the last day
to pay your fees?

294
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,350
It was 2 days ago

295
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,082
Tell them maybe
you'll pay it next month

296
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,654
You will be able to pay
only if I get my brokerage fee

297
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,388
Have you recovered
from your cough?

298
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,392
Of course I have

299
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,259
But we must continue
to buy your medicines

300
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,697
God! I have no money
for even my bus fare

301
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,999
Look at Unni
our neighbor

302
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,535
These chaps must learn
a few lessons from him

303
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,768
The mono-act was superb

304
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,413
God! Why did you
get him a job like this?

305
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,412
When I see his leg
my heart wilts

306
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,321
I want to try
Ayurvedic treatment

307
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,552
But where is the money?

308
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:48,496
I have taken too many loans
So that's out of question

309
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,159
If I repay it
I'll get some more

310
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,169
But where is the money to repay?

311
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,799
Hey! Isn't it salary day, son?

312
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,043
Get away from here
I know what you are up to

313
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,169
Come early morning
to lather me up

314
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,736
This isn't soap

315
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,140
It's oil

316
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,345
Good Lord!

317
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,579
This fellow isn't worth a dime

318
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,988
Useless fellow!

319
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,123
The theater he was born
is now a marriage hall

320
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,685
- Thanks to his 'fortune'
- Ask your mother to shut up

321
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,526
- What is the use?
- Be quiet!

322
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,192
Isn't our neighbor Unni
the same age as you?

323
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,100
See, how he looks after his family

324
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,501
Learn from him

325
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:32,336
This fellow here wants to sighisee
Glutton, worse than a pig!

326
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,570
Hey! Don't stop eating
Finish the whole thing

327
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,138
I wanted fried fritters

328
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,447
Eats for more than 2 stomachs!

329
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,521
Are you sure you want
to go only to Pattaya?

330
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,490
We have Ooty, Munnar, Lulu Mall

331
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,390
All that's too much
We'll stick to Pattaya

332
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,659
What shall I bring
from Pattaya for you?

333
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,099
Your choice
Anything except AIDS!

334
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,034
'Pling'

335
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,002
Drink this milk
before you go, son

336
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,411
I don't want

337
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,211
Only on the days I get my salary
you'll be magnanimous!

338
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,580
On all other days
only black tea

339
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,449
I have no money

340
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,286
How do you manage to give
Horlicks and Boost to father?

341
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,587
That's because your
father was once 'Mr Kochi'

342
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,356
So why should I drink black tea?

343
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,332
Chandrika'echi has brought
a good alliance for you

344
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,595
The girl is not on Wha1sApp,
Facebook or any love affair

345
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,466
Wonderful girl

346
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,496
If she isn't in any of these
she must be handicapped like me

347
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,506
What a strange boy!

348
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,441
No need for
anymore new stories

349
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,603
We are hell bent
on going to Pattaya

350
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:47,446
He and his blessed Pattaya
Faisal must be the bad influence

351
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,244
My throat has become
parched talking to him

352
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,387
Goodness!
My husband

353
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,595
Aren't you going for work?

354
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,631
Who will on a Monday?

355
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,290
Who's yelling out there?

356
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,356
Anthony

357
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,400
So?

358
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,595
What does he mean by 'so'?

359
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,296
Is he nuts?

360
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,370
Partner

361
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,464
Don't shout
I'm coming

362
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,506
- Antho?
- What?

363
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,137
What did your folks say?

364
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,679
Few cuss words
plus a curse, that's all

365
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,544
Dhalapathy, shall we go?

366
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,642
Your mother fed you
lots of milk, eh?

367
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,514
I didn't drink

368
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:27,750
Who wants milk when Pattaya beach
is waiting for us with yummy 'desserts!

369
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,419
I thought you weren't going

370
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,549
My wife is harassing me at home

371
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,388
This is why I won't get married

372
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,590
I'll woo all the girls
and then whiz away

373
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,325
What?

374
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,731
I said that's why
I'll be single

375
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,729
Come again

376
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,628
That's why I don't get any girl

377
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,569
That's correct
That's the spirit

378
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,004
You can crawl
to master's house

379
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,132
We'll meet Pathu there

380
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,267
May your bike
have a flat tyre!

381
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,053
Pathu!

382
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,220
You have taken my
brushes again, huh?

383
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,190
What have you got
behind you?

384
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,062
Let me see your hands

385
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,228
Show me

386
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,234
This was painted by master

387
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,209
All the rest here
are painted by me

388
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,302
You minx!

389
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,518
Paint all over your hands

390
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,055
Come here

391
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,549
Quiet mischief!

392
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,427
Sanju, come here

393
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,362
Come here, Sanju

394
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,769
Path u'n1a!

395
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,238
Sanju is scaring me

396
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,675
It's alright
He isn't normal

397
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,009
- What, dude?
- Sanju frightened her

398
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,015
What went wrong with him, master?
He used to be quite normal

399
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,612
We have only heard of
kids winning in reality shows

400
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,384
But he is in shock after he lost out
in the elimination round

401
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:11,052
Anyone will become crazy with
high pressure at this young age

402
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:15,292
That's why though people insist
I don't participate in such shows

403
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,458
That's because he's already crazy

404
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,229
It's pay day today

405
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,271
What gift do you want
for your birthday?

406
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,965
Do I get 1 or 3?

407
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,371
Pathu!

408
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,602
Okay, 1 will do

409
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,665
What do you want, my dear?

410
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,734
I want a big teddy bear

411
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,480
- Beer?
- Bear

412
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,173
Bearer?

413
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,717
The stuffed toy

414
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:35,575
Oh! I see

415
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,584
Yes, that's the one

416
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,745
- Will it be very expensive?
- Who knows!

417
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,456
Time for your school bus

418
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,119
Before your mother
starts yelling, go to school

419
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,405
Go die, you Vagabond

420
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,632
Not you, Vagabond

421
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,072
That goody-goody U n n I

422
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,302
With his organic farming...

423
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,777
...saint like face and
taking care of his family

424
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,310
He is the sole reason we lose sleep

425
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,643
Everyone has a dialog on loop
Look at Unni and learn

426
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,480
Who is bothered!

427
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,116
Want a lift?

428
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,158
My exam is today
Not tomorrow

429
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,021
You carry on crawling

430
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,425
- You'll fail your exam
- Get lost, Vagabond!

431
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,232
Look! She comes exactly
when we cross this place

432
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,726
See! Jenny turned and
smiled at us even today

433
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,102
Why doesn't she
confess her feelings?

434
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,470
How can she tell her
feelings about me to you?

435
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,009
I'll woo her too
and just whizz away!

436
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,703
Partner! if Amar eyes a girl-

437
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,039
Anthony would have wooed her

438
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,774
- Challenge?
- Sure

439
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,644
Are you still here?

440
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,181
Hey! Look he's caught up with us

441
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,020
Your bike has picked up speed

442
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,252
Not at all!

443
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,291
Yours went into
slow motion seeing her

444
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,385
0h yes!

445
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,159
Stop running after that
worthless girl and do your work

446
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,464
Okay, see you
at 'Shake Sherbet'

447
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,602
He's on an advising spree lately

448
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,660
Don't speak ill of him
after he's gone, you rogue

449
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,207
Won't you do the same
about me tomorrow?

450
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,240
This junk! Didn't you
get it repaired as yet?

451
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,309
We'll be late today also

452
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,105
Yes

453
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,373
May be petrol is
not flowing freely

454
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,177
Or is it because you
did not fill up the tank?

455
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,309
- Let me try tilting it
- Go ahead

456
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,154
Only last week I had
filled Rs 30 worth fuel

457
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,356
G'ma
Praise the lord!

458
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,459
<i>“Leis take a same, honey“</i>

459
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,432
“Give me a muah...many“

460
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,228
Are you on Facebook?

461
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,364
Yes!

462
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,031
Just like you, full time

463
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,705
You never leave that
Kaniha Menon alone, do you?

464
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,479
You mean the girl
studying in 12th grade?

465
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,311
Yes

466
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,406
Mammy!
How did you know?

467
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,474
Have you seen her in person?

468
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,348
<i>No</i>

469
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,649
You can see her now

470
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,314
lam Kaniha Menon

471
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,124
'Pling'

472
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,490
You are always asking me
what dress I am wearing

473
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,195
I am always
in this traditional attire

474
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,128
Don't ever ask me
that again, okay?

475
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,327
What was all that?

476
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,233
Hey! Not me

477
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,332
Discard this bike and
buy a Harley Davidson

478
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,442
Heavy sporting
riding position

479
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,536
The back mono shock
gives super performance

480
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,512
It won't ditch you half way

481
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,551
Hey! This lady doesn't
belong to olden times

482
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,778
Hi-tech!

483
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,646
Chicken biriyani
for 500, right?

484
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,281
I take full responsibility

485
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,519
See you on Sunday

486
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,690
Big deal!

487
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,095
Hi Calamity Express

488
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,065
I stopped talking
about calamities

489
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,758
Hey! Wonder of wonders

490
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,005
Got your bike
repaired in half an hour?

491
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,164
Let's go

492
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,333
Reji bhai, shouldn't we celebrate
Shibu's wedding with fanfare?

493
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,070
Don't go yet

494
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:26,306
Hahn! That reminds me
What are weddings after all?

495
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,545
One day I too decked up and
went to church to get married

496
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,551
Look what happened to me

497
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:37,021
My bride eloped with the driver
who went to pick her up

498
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,726
How can you be sure
Shibu's bride will marry him?

499
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,695
I thought you stopped
talking about calamities

500
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,754
What to do?

501
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,432
I am a calamity myself

502
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,569
This fellow is the biggest
calamity in this house

503
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,069
You damn mother of my mother!

504
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,265
- I'll pickle you to pieces
- Just try it!

505
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,399
Hey! Aren't you going to Pattaya?

506
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,573
- I am coming too
- Me too

507
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,677
- Then I won't come
- I too won't

508
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,412
So you've decided on this tour

509
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,209
Once my uncle went
on a tour too

510
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,719
And their bus fell into a ditch

511
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,421
Everyone in that bus-

512
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,286
Hey! Let's get away quick

513
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,616
Not a single person lived

514
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,492
Hear me out how uncle's body
was brought back in 9 parts

515
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,197
This is not fair, sir

516
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,639
You can't deduct
my salary this time

517
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,642
As it is you pay me pittance

518
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,376
Chuck your job
and leave if you want

519
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:33,541
There are plenty of educated
jobless people to fill your place

520
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,173
But I don't intend going

521
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,546
First of all, you are late
delivering the pizzas

522
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:42,148
Plus there are many complaints
about a missing slice in your delivery

523
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,665
What rubbish!

524
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,727
Are you saying I eat a piece
and deliver the remaining?

525
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,229
Half baked theory!

526
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,465
From today I will
deliver on the dot

527
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,508
Fat chance!

528
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,140
Sujith Vaassudev?

529
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,450
Just 15 minutes

530
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,747
No, there won't be any delay

531
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:17,092
This order will be
delivered on the dot

532
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,177
This time I'll outsmart myself!

533
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,623
Am I not on the dot?

534
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:55,626
Where is the pizza?

535
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,099
Ooops! I forgot to get the Pizza

536
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:25,120
My dear lady! I swear
I don't know a word in English

537
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,356
People cook up stories

538
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,424
Look over there!
An accident

539
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,730
Don't go
You're asking for trouble

540
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,026
Don't you have
anything better to do?

541
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,504
- Let's just see
- Come back

542
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:39,667
Should I stop and look?

543
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,041
Better take the pizza fast
Otherwise your salary will be cut

544
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,410
I'm going

545
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,713
Move aside
Just move a bit

546
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,656
Goodness!
Looks quite serious

547
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,116
What happened?

548
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,155
Accident victim!
Can't you see?

549
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,193
He should be
rushed to the hospital

550
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,524
Why don't you take
a picture of this also?

551
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,466
Shameless fellow!

552
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,967
A man is almost dying here

553
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,369
And he wants to
click snaps in his mobile

554
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,469
Let me make a call

555
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,670
Brother, please call Jadayi

556
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,679
Jadayu?

557
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,647
Jadayi Sabu

558
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,296
Who is dying, you are
rushing to buy medicine?

559
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,990
Your father

560
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,100
Father?
Then it's okay

561
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,734
Just look at
our Fort Kochi Beach

562
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,540
It's so vast and beautiful

563
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,633
Even your own mother
won't bear this stink

564
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,178
If this was USA, women would
have spread out like that algae

565
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,141
It's so long since I asked
for a 'Shake Sherbet'

566
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,548
Just a minute, bhai

567
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,643
It's so crowded these days

568
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,717
That is an understatement

569
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,589
Last week I had to
use political clout

570
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,689
What a lousy joke!

571
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,289
- Not good, eh?
- Terrible!

572
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,133
I wish I hadn't said it

573
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,430
Can't be more
of a damp squib

574
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,971
I thought so too

575
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,200
Where the heck is this Amar?

576
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,473
Did some girl's father
beat him to death?

577
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,544
Hey?

578
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,377
So rFY

579
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,507
- Why?
- For my lousy joke

580
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,709
Get lost, man

581
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,975
Shake, shake, shake
you'll soon get your share

582
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,385
Bro, a shake for me also

583
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,013
Wait, you'll get one

584
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,252
Last week, to drink this I had to use
a letter of reference from a politician

585
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,988
What a dumb joke!

586
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,195
But I changed
politician to 'minister'!

587
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,459
This fellow is incorrigible!

588
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,501
I came up with a joke
that suited you guys

589
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,002
Where were you all this while?

590
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,102
An accident on my way here

591
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,404
At the ground, near the signal
a woman fell into a pit

592
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,442
Not a single soul
bothered to help

593
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,742
I got her into an auto
took her to hospital

594
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,949
And donated blood
before coming here

595
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,685
How old was she?

596
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:09,154
Around 45

597
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,623
Not the woman
Her daughter?

598
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,226
I didn't ask

599
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,329
Maybe around 17

600
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,267
Bingo!

601
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,964
Otherwise we know
you'd never offer to help

602
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,097
Bingo 2!!

603
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,504
Is there a photo of her?

604
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,337
<i>No</i>

605
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,432
Show me?

606
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,171
This is the politician

607
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,074
And this is the minister's quota

608
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,207
Where is mine?

609
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,443
Come with a letter
from a politician, bhai

610
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,510
With such stupid jokes
you won't get food at home also

611
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,119
Let me taste

612
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,489
That is our salary
for 1 month

613
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:48,593
'Interests, ration shop,
milkman, loans, petrol'

614
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,360
None of them should
hassle us this month

615
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,132
What about the gift for Pathu?

616
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,066
Rs 1000 will do for that

617
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,301
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes

618
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:08,483
Partner, our savings
and this month's salary...

619
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,280
...is a round figure of Rs 24000

620
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,583
Minus Rs 30

621
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,655
Why?

622
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,321
For the 'Shake Sherbet'

623
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,122
You are such a pessimist!

624
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,424
Better buy the air ticket
while the offer is on

625
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,362
Faisal said we will
get it for just Rs 24000

626
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,365
Really?

627
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:28,733
So this time our dream
will actually come true

628
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,678
Tempting me!

629
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,379
She's already got a guy

630
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,355
It's Akbar'ikka

631
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,757
He's greeting us

632
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,794
Oh whatever!

633
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,052
Find out if we can
get the other items

634
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,796
Amar, your father
had an accident

635
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:57,794
He is in hospital

636
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,659
You must deposit
Rs 24000 immediately

637
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,602
I can't rope in a single rupee
except this belt!

638
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:04,731
What is it?

639
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,770
Father is in hospital
I have to pay Rs 24000

640
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,539
What about Pattaya?

641
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,181
How will you go?

642
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,184
Go and pay up
at the hospital

643
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,455
Are you sure this is the floor?

644
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,017
He isn't dead as yet

645
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,593
But critical, anyway get
an obituary bill board!

646
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,627
His photo
Not mine

647
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,055
- There you are!
- What is it, master?

648
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,725
A minor accident

649
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,331
Hope nothing is wrong

650
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,667
How can nothing be wrong?
It's an accident

651
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,062
Where did this happen?

652
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,802
At the signal near the grounds
He fell into a pit

653
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,602
Lord! Was that his father?

654
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,152
Father!

655
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,822
How are...

656
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,525
...the nurses here?

657
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,187
One or two are good

658
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,000
Was this room necessary?

659
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,295
Couldn't you have managed
in a common ward?

660
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,440
I have access to TV here

661
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,501
Today Deepti delivers
in the episode 'Nombaram'

662
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:20,447
Now we'll know if the father
of the baby is Ramesh or Babu

663
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,310
Is that Deepti?

664
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,357
Please bring a change
of dress for the patient

665
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,388
Sure
He will bring

666
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,453
Me?

667
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,051
You think he will go?

668
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,385
Go fast, dude

669
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,792
Anthony

670
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,429
- This cash hasn't been paid
- I will do it

671
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,663
- The money-
- I have

672
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,070
I have the tour money

673
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,665
I am taking this rotten banana

674
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,038
Dying of hunger!

675
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,641
- Where are you going?
- To close matters

676
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,180
Oh! Is he gone?

677
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,613
I haven't informed your people

678
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,743
Regi just blew it
out of proportion

679
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,650
What if he had died?

680
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,385
My uncle just like this
during a baptism-

681
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,052
Ask this shameless fellow
to shut up!

682
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,059
Why are you like this?

683
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,186
Get lost, man

684
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,580
How many times
should I tell you?

685
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,085
If you come here
Rasmina will be left all alone

686
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,484
Father is fine

687
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,656
And I can stay
if he wants company

688
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:38,182
You also can go
Right, Sister?

689
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,024
I'll call you later

690
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,192
I am Anthony

691
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,067
Here's your shirt

692
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,605
This one?

693
00:43:54,765 --> 00:44:00,181
Didn't I ask you to bring that
green collar with red beads party wear?

694
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,442
Party wear, my foot!

695
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,518
Green collar...red beads?!

696
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,384
He is on a 'high'
seeing those young chicks

697
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,325
No one on earth but your father
will demand party wear in a hospital!

698
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,010
Why are you here?

699
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,156
My mother is in ICU

700
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,517
Critical condition

701
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,354
We've been asked to
inform our near and dear ones

702
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,557
Sorry, dude

703
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,662
Your father is a better man!

704
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,728
Partner, I paid the bill

705
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,206
It was so crowded there

706
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,139
Thanks, dude

707
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,676
Why this formality
amongst friends?

708
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,609
- How much
- Rs 26000

709
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,275
Don't hike it
Exact figure

710
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,142
What?

711
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,377
Don't pinch a commission
Tell me the exact amount

712
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,477
- Commission?
- Tell me the truth

713
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,680
I'll punch you

714
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,120
But don't hike the amount

715
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,384
What the heck-

716
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,982
Come with me

717
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,489
When his dad is lying like this
we can't afford to do this

718
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,155
How much was it actually?

719
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,558
Rs 22000

720
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,294
Bro, Rs 24000

721
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,201
Rs 1000 for him and Rs 1000 there
So it is Rs 22000

722
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,630
Next time you bet
I won't pay the bill

723
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,135
Amar, the ambulance driver is here

724
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,608
So what?
This is a hospital

725
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,773
He was the one who brought
your father to the hospital

726
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,477
He was the one
who called me too

727
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,449
Please go and meet him

728
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,043
Jadayu Sabu

729
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,554
Jadayu Sabu?

730
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,522
Sabu?

731
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:51,785
Jadayu Sabu

732
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,563
Thanks

733
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,594
Okay, I'll take leave

734
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,623
Are you leaving?

735
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,202
Yes, I stayed to
just hear the thanks

736
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,397
if you had not reached on time-

737
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,230
All that is okay

738
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,332
I have rescued
so many like this

739
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,434
Don't think of this
as just a profession

740
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:15,416
Tomorrow if we lie on the road
hope no one abandons us

741
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,450
True

742
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,612
Why 'Jadayu'?
Is it your surname?

743
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,015
People call me that
because I fly to their rescue

744
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,025
Isn't it 'Dinkan' who flies
to everyone's rescue?

745
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:24,684
What?

746
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,193
It's nothing
Nothing, bro

747
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,320
ls your father okay?

748
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,419
Okay, see you

749
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,022
How can you leave?

750
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,624
You must accept something

751
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,724
No, it's alright

752
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,267
Just for our sake

753
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,567
I don't have that habit
of taking money

754
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,041
That won't do
You must

755
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,133
Please accept

756
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,337
This is a real pain

757
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,640
Then give me Rs 100

758
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,179
That's a bit too much

759
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,643
Crap!

760
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,287
Brother, let me explain

761
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,152
I was just joking

762
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,457
Do you take...?

763
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,221
I swim in it

764
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,388
He belongs to our group

765
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,997
We were supposed to go to Pattaya

766
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,160
Since that isn't happening
Let us splurge

767
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,335
I will name the place,
the time and the booze

768
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,171
Expense is yours?

769
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,575
Near Kurisupalli, eh?

770
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,411
I'll be right there

771
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,179
Strange fellow!

772
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,546
What a smart fellow!!

773
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,247
Good chap

774
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,521
I should have just
given him the 100 bucks!

775
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,459
What can I say!

776
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,261
When they split, all photos
were sent to her husband

777
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,062
For heaven's sake
speed up, Akku

778
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,397
This is the maximum it can go

779
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,597
No wonder we don't get
optimum mileage

780
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,730
Tell us about that nurse

781
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,167
Her husband came back from Dubai

782
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,201
- My dance practice went for a toss
- We get yelled at for nothing

783
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:51,540
Look!

784
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,481
She gets dropped by
a different guy everyday

785
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,178
Is she really going
for 'cinematic dance'?

786
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,017
Why don't you
ask her yourself?

787
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,118
- Yes, ask her
- I will

788
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,126
- Then ask
- Sure, I will

789
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,661
Look, he plans to ask
Quick, follow him

790
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,287
Let him

791
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,200
- I'll drop you home?
- Just stop here

792
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,127
Come early tomorrow

793
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,363
This will do

794
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,103
She gets dropped by
a different guy everyday

795
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,702
Is she really going
for 'cinematic dance'?

796
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:27,309
Hey! They copied your dialog

797
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,483
You missed that slap!

798
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,618
I stopped dancing
Now I am a hired killer!

799
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,993
Go and ask her now

800
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:44,725
<i>No</i>

801
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,631
Go now

802
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,397
This is the perfect time
Go and ask her

803
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,028
Sure!
Best time

804
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,231
You cheapo!

805
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,069
After her father
became bedridden...

806
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,044
...to support her family she had to
tie anklets to her feet and dance

807
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,341
But anklets aren't worn
in 'cinematic dance'

808
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,550
True, dancers in films
do not use anklets

809
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,017
That's right

810
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:04,711
Let's go

811
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,176
I'll go, but admit
there are no anklets

812
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,244
No anklets

813
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,416
Yes, no anklets

814
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,560
Didn't we promise Pathu a gift?

815
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,568
Gift?

816
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,263
I don't remember

817
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,168
I don't want any gift

818
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:25,569
Why?

819
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,577
Mom said you need lots of money
because grandpa is in hospital

820
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,579
So I don't want
a gift for this birthday

821
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,377
But next birthday you can
get me a big teddy bear

822
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,246
That's okay

823
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,148
But not a big teddy bear
A small one will do

824
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,049
I want a big one

825
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,452
Yes, a smaaaall one!

826
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,455
I don't want a small one
I want a big one

827
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,085
Small one is okay

828
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,190
Then I don't want any

829
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,253
Path u dear!

830
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,594
I don't want any

831
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,758
Which bear do you want?

832
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,700
Give it to me

833
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,283
I want it

834
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,479
Look over there
Far away there is a ship

835
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,424
One day we'll go in that

836
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,153
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere

837
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,493
Come, I'll carry you

838
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,792
- Don't cry, okay
- Drink your milk

839
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,078
Where is our daughter?

840
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,215
Chinnu...!

841
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,120
Chinnu
Where is she?

842
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,286
My daughter!
Chinnu...!

843
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,488
I don't see her anywhere

844
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,564
Mother

845
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,596
Ma

846
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,046
Where did you find him?

847
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,480
Careful

848
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,418
Here

849
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,621
Sit here

850
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,389
Sit, Sabu'cheta

851
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,424
Mother, he is Sabu'chetan
who admitted father in the hospital

852
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,191
I am very grateful

853
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,731
This man is so careless

854
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,529
He falls into any pit
he sees on the way

855
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,594
25 years ago I fell
into the biggest pit ever!

856
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,037
What a joke!

857
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,665
Look! It's streaming down

858
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:40,503
What?

859
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,736
Your dye!

860
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,045
You could have brought him
home in an auto

861
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,138
Why did you
trouble that boy?

862
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,549
It's no trouble at all
This is my job

863
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,314
Just a 'thank you' will do

864
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:53,376
Grandpa

865
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,479
Come, my dear

866
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,324
Who are they?

867
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,789
Our daughter Rasmina

868
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,585
And her daughter Fathima

869
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,529
Our dearest Pathu

870
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,329
But how are Rasmina
and Fathima your 'family'?

871
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,702
I'll explain this evening

872
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,006
Okay, I'll leave

873
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,099
Leaving?

874
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,042
You must accept a payment

875
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,079
No, not necessary

876
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,241
Don't say that
Please accept something

877
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,373
I'll handle it

878
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,712
See you in the evening

879
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,774
okay

880
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,486
They are all
the same kind

881
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,555
Go and pay him something

882
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:37,727
'Statutory warning: Smoking and
drinking alcohol are harmful to health'

883
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,033
I've fixed the board

884
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,694
We can get away
with anything we want

885
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,431
Bro, it's a great place

886
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,733
No one will disturb us here

887
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,274
We can be here
till tomorrow morning

888
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,435
Why are you sitting so glum?

889
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,443
Say something

890
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,739
What can I say?

891
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,408
Once, just like this, my best friend
sat near the backwaters, drinking

892
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:58,142
He fell into the sea
And was found only 3 days later

893
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,278
Are you satisfied?

894
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,016
Regi chem, don't ruin this
beautiful night with such stories

895
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,352
Let him say what he wants

896
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,484
Frankly, I feel like laughing
when I hear about such mishaps

897
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,224
Our friend Kumaran
died laughing like this

898
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,629
Take that glass

899
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,630
In memory of our Pattaya tour
that fell into a bottomless hole!

900
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,031
Abuses to all employers
who cut salaries

901
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,599
For the peace of all souls
who died in calamities

902
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,171
Sit...sit

903
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,054
When you talk of calamities
come up with new stories

904
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,463
ls someone's house on fire?

905
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,264
Don't worry

906
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,368
It's my ring tone

907
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,140
Recorded it during a funeral

908
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,107
Don't call me
unless it's an accident

909
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,807
Now I am in the middle of
the Metro rail project discussion

910
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,319
Whose ring tone is that?

911
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:10,085
It isn't a ringtone
It's that buffoon moaning

912
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:16,629
Everyone moans
after a couple of drinks

913
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,757
I really love it

914
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,536
Love failure, eh?

915
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,537
How did you know?

916
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:33,009
A girl will cry
at the drop of a hat

917
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,514
But a man will cry
only for 1 reason

918
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,009
A girl

919
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,614
How did your love break up?

920
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,657
Hey!

921
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,521
Don't be so thrilled

922
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,426
How did it break up?

923
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,434
<i>Lizzie, Jessy, Sumi, Sherry</i>

924
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,069
So many of them?

925
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,970
But none of them
made me cry

926
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,341
I loved only 1 girl sincerely

927
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,675
Only 1 who I really
wanted to marry

928
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:12,643
I even told
my mother about her

929
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:13,619
And?

930
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,239
Look! She is the girl
Go and talk to them

931
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,608
She's good looking

932
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,478
But let me see
if she will match our family

933
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,246
That flirt's mother is coming

934
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,183
You sit in the car

935
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,079
Wait please

936
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,422
- What is your girl's name?
- Gowri Menon

937
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,392
- Is she studying?
- Yes

938
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,562
Who else is part of your family?

939
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,629
If you're thinking in terms
of an alliance, forget it

940
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:01,731
Her marriage is fixed

941
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,502
I just wanted to know-

942
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:07,234
It's so obvious when uncultured
people like you come to talk

943
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,174
Hey! It's not a proposal

944
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,545
My son wanted a chic chick
simply for time pass!

945
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:19,181
May be go for a movie
or drive around in the car

946
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:23,757
Won't I get refined girls from
a good family to marry my son?

947
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,315
Poor aunty!

948
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,225
Misunderstood me completely

949
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,353
Ruined it!

950
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,431
Marry a girl with
a bloody face like that?

951
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,263
Why did you mess it up?

952
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,770
How will I not be angry?

953
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,699
Her mother is
so damn arrogant!

954
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:42,767
She looks the riff-raff kind

955
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,342
Good for nothing!

956
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,445
That's gone too

957
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,021
It was a great catch

958
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,752
His own mother
ruined his chances

959
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,291
Since I was a good looker...

960
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,560
...I didn't have to lie
saying I was a pilot

961
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:06,623
High hopes!

962
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:11,138
She loved me knowing
what and who I was

963
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:16,336
She called me home one day
to introduce me to her family

964
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,511
She had only 1 condition

965
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,015
Her father must be
suitably impressed

966
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,059
How is everything?

967
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,699
Going on well

968
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:47,464
Angel...

969
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,306
...told us everything

970
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,545
Anthony, meet Joe

971
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,714
My cousin

972
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,186
I simply love music

973
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,260
Me too

974
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,222
- Do you sing?
- A little

975
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,690
Then you must sing today

976
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,403
He always says
he likes to sing

977
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,496
But I've never heard him, daddy

978
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,633
Sing for us

979
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,567
Don't

980
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,212
sing

981
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,281
Don't sing

982
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,543
Please sing

983
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,346
Don't sing

984
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,084
I did

985
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:39,092
"A chap who outsmarted
an already Smart Alec!"

986
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:45,461
“Dreams dissolved, my heart too
Dear goblin who is an imp true“

987
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:03,574
“Don't sell ice to the Eskimos
Don't try to paint the chameleon!“

988
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,181
We never knew

989
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:10,713
No one told us
the boy sings so well

990
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,390
Hey! Didn't you fall in love?

991
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,161
I did

992
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:21,660
Not now

993
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,398
Long back
In school

994
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,148
I like you very much

995
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,618
Yuck! I don't like you
Lame fellow!

996
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,151
If you did not like me...

997
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,489
...big boo to you!

998
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,129
From that day when I see girls
I turn my face away

999
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,463
After removing his knickers!!

1000
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:31,737
Sabu'cheta

1001
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,571
You haven't got married
because of a broken affair too?

1002
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:38,178
Nothing like that

1003
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,774
But there was a girl in my life

1004
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,381
And?

1005
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,674
What else?

1006
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,744
She just left me

1007
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,422
That is how a girl's heart is

1008
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:52,749
Like water

1009
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,625
It just flows on and on

1010
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,564
Men are like mobiles

1011
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,999
If mobile falls into water
or water falls on the mobile...

1012
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,565
...the mobile gets spoilt

1013
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,729
Even God can't predict
when an auto will turn!

1014
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,443
Or when a girl
will change her mind

1015
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,137
Sometimes it may even change
on the way to the altar

1016
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,408
No heart

1017
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,143
Girls don't have a heart

1018
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,310
Have you ever heard of
a girl dying of a heart attack?

1019
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,752
Not at all

1020
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,253
Some men belong to
the imbecile clan

1021
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:28,125
He won't touch a girl
claiming she's a Goddess

1022
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:32,323
In the end when some
software engineer marries her...

1023
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,526
...he'll sit and moan

1024
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,795
What is the use?

1025
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,765
That's why you must
get to taste the goodies-

1026
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,334
I'll punch you hard

1027
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,429
Only a thought

1028
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:43,466
Men who got jilted
advise their friends like this

1029
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,638
Let me ask you something

1030
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,139
We gave our hearts

1031
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,442
Should we give our body too?

1032
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,577
Are they entitled to it?

1033
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,483
That was superb
I like it, partner

1034
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,150
We men love-

1035
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,284
Stop it, I say

1036
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,486
Love, bull and bunkum

1037
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,493
Don't you have any other topic?

1038
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,429
Don't say that, partner

1039
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,228
Love is-

1040
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,631
What is it?

1041
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,733
Love is-

1042
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:25,309
“What is love, sweetheart?
A fire that sears the heart“

1043
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:50,441
“What is love, sweetheart?
A fire that scorches the heart“

1044
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:58,652
“What is love, sweetheart?
A fire that scars the heart“

1045
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:03,550
“Hooch cannot salve the pain
nor will dope make the hurt abstain“

1046
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:11,364
“Hooch cannot salve the pain
nor will dope make the hurt abstain“

1047
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,095
“Even if you pluck your heart en masse
hand it over in your loved one's hands“

1048
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,363
“Won't you say it is
a red hibiscus?“

1049
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,999
“And fling it far away, lass?“

1050
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:29,339
“We'll tuck the flowers neat
behind our ear lobes petite“

1051
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:33,251
“And be named after the moon
'Shashi' or 'Shashank' dude“

1052
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:37,414
“We'll tuck the flowers neat
behind our ear lobes petite“

1053
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,656
“And be named after the moon
'Shashi' or 'Shashank' dude“

1054
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:48,258
“What is love, sweetheart?
A fire that sears the heart“

1055
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:53,233
“A fire that sears the heart“

1056
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,167
"if glamorous like Shah Rukh Khan"

1057
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,332
“Any girl will fall flat
but just for fun!“

1058
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,434
"if Shah Rukh Khan ends up a pauper
with An1jad Khan she'll elope proper!"

1059
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:42,315
“Only a guy loaded with cash is a lover
Any other beggar is only her brother“

1060
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,152
“A leaf falls on a thorn suddenly
or vice versa as the case may be“

1061
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:51,663
“Girl, why does the leaf then lodge a case
against the thorn for being a nuisance?“

1062
01:04:54,223 --> 01:05:00,299
“Even a snake in the grass
will go to court for justice“

1063
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,641
“Life will turn worthless I say
As useless as a knife without a blade“

1064
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,443
“Even a snake in the grass
will go to court for justice“

1065
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,748
“Life will turn worthless, intolerable
As useless as a wheel without an axle“

1066
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:19,687
“What is love, sweetheart?
A fire that sears the heart“

1067
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,343
“Chatterbox of a girl garrulous
who is just full of nonsense“

1068
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:49,447
“Pretends she reeks of intelligence
Falls into traps, begging for deliverance“

1069
01:05:53,716 --> 01:06:00,326
“Doomsday has come for men
when palm trees climbed by women!“

1070
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:05,031
“Girl, that's it, once you get married
men are as good as blindfolded“

1071
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:10,601
“Even if an elephant runs wild
won't a man still be a mahout kind?“

1072
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:23,079
“Such gibberish is a waste of time
A poppycock song that has lost its rhyme!“

1073
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:31,323
“Such Greek and Latin is a waste of time
An absurd song that has lost its rhyme!“

1074
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:38,739
“What is love, sweetheart?“

1075
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:46,442
“A fire that sears the heart“

1076
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,617
You rocked, man

1077
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,580
I think it's about to rain

1078
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:55,747
Let's go

1079
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,389
Where is the other guy?

1080
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:58,422
Akbar

1081
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,687
Let's go

1082
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:00,557
Wait a minute

1083
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,618
Let me empty out my sorrows

1084
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,633
If there is love in my life
it will only be with my Jenny

1085
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,032
Your Jenny?

1086
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,196
- Your Jenny
- Mine!

1087
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:12,569
Stop it

1088
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,266
Let Jenny belong to anyone

1089
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,135
Get up

1090
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,234
Help me UP

1091
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,242
Come

1092
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,505
lvly Jenny

1093
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,070
Society's Jenny

1094
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,599
Is it your or my leg
that has a complaint?

1095
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,067
- Who is that?
- Let him go

1096
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,195
Must have gone up
to get tender coconut

1097
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,437
He should have
given me also one

1098
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,235
Why don't we mind our business?

1099
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,637
Why do you interfere?

1100
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,508
Once a grandpa climbed
a tree to get coconuts

1101
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,104
We know that story

1102
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,514
Do such people even have grandpas?

1103
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,711
He must be punched first

1104
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,999
What a beautiful sight!

1105
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,543
Has she been there long?

1106
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,380
What is it?

1107
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:34,517
Why drool over a lady
who is like our elder sister?

1108
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,986
After all she's a policeman's wife

1109
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,387
I'll click a snap

1110
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,257
Will come of use later

1111
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,434
I will woo this chechi also
and whizz away

1112
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,333
Are you feeling bad?

1113
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,042
There will be a teacher
in every school

1114
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,576
And a chechi in every town

1115
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,641
That is the law of nature

1116
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,720
Wonder where
our society is heading

1117
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,288
I'm quite fed up
of this saint!

1118
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,304
- Aren't you going today?
- Today is Sunday

1119
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,072
I know you've gone
for catering on Sundays too

1120
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,113
Maybe we'll leave 10:30

1121
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,407
Till then do you know why
they hang around here?

1122
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,679
Oh! I see

1123
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,720
Chechi, shall we go for a movie?

1124
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,154
But didn't we plan it already?

1125
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,459
- Yes
- Then why again?

1126
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,626
This was just to remind you

1127
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,131
You bet!

1128
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,138
It will be very crowded

1129
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,334
We must leave early, okay?

1130
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:01,397
Okay

1131
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,067
That's her idea

1132
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:14,777
Partner

1133
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,022
No chance!

1134
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,217
Look at this winding queue

1135
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,017
Shall I get it for you?

1136
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,386
You?

1137
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,389
Watch the power of
a handicapped person

1138
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:56,786
What?

1139
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,053
I am handicapped

1140
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,064
3 tickets

1141
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:02,125
Why do such people
come to these places?

1142
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,735
Don't beat me

1143
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,375
Go back to the queue

1144
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,543
Didn't you get tickets?

1145
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,038
Give us 2 and you can
sell the rest in black

1146
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,776
Can you believe?
He really beat me

1147
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,583
I will get tickets

1148
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,711
I will make her buy them

1149
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,790
She has to oblige
if I ask her to

1150
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,189
Give me the money, you dog

1151
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,678
Actually the theater owner is my friend

1152
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,449
Looking at her smile
I think she fell for it

1153
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:56,489
Shut up!

1154
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,616
Since you are here
it isn't right to meet him

1155
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,751
Policeman

1156
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,158
Kaput!

1157
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,591
Don't beat me
She's my wife

1158
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,055
Wife?!

1159
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,589
Move back

1160
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:05,647
What is the time?

1161
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:06,617
Don't bother

1162
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:07,456
I know

1163
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,722
4:30

1164
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,161
He says it is 4:30

1165
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,230
Brother, can you
please bend a little?

1166
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,064
You mean till the movie gets over?

1167
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,737
You mean bend down
for two and a half hours

1168
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,065
If you want
stand up and see, fool!

1169
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,344
Let her go
She isn't bothered

1170
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,280
Who are you waving out to?

1171
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,643
Did you notice her face?

1172
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,049
Not face
God-awful face!

1173
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,780
Whatever!

1174
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,784
Did you catch that shy-look...

1175
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:37,484
...when I said she was my wife?

1176
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,219
Yes, she was shame-faced

1177
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:42,023
Any girl will feel ashamed
being your wife

1178
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,223
Let me tell you
something honestly

1179
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,026
No need

1180
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,327
Don't mind him, go ahead

1181
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,426
During the movie
I held her hand

1182
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,399
You what...?

1183
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:52,665
I caught her hand

1184
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,071
You held Jenny's hand?

1185
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:54,607
I swear!

1186
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,142
Must be true

1187
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,804
- I heard a loud slap!
- Maybe true

1188
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,274
I meant I caught her hand...almost!

1189
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,074
Everybody has a good opinion

1190
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,379
How was the film?

1191
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,009
Superb

1192
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,212
Lower class people like the film too!

1193
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,319
Here's you r 'd osa'

1194
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,352
It's my treat

1195
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,332
Especially because
she said she liked me

1196
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,690
When did she say so?

1197
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:24,137
She will soon
Anticipating that joy

1198
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,228
Let her first profess

1199
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,672
May be she'll choose me
But still you can pay

1200
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,703
Are you footing the bill?

1201
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,439
Bro, 1 more fish fry
with plenty of onions

1202
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,707
Right away

1203
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:37,610
“Mackerel fried hot
Roasted pearl spot“

1204
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:41,516
“Prawns in kokum gravy freshly caught“

1205
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:44,181
In spite of all this
do you know why...

1206
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,692
...I am not scared I'll lose Jenny?

1207
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,251
Because you know
you won't get her, right?

1208
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,266
I have an item with me

1209
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,293
A song,
Just 2 lines

1210
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,170
If you look into a girl's eyes
and sing those 2 lines...

1211
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,036
...consider her fallen

1212
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,334
Angel's father fell, remember?

1213
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,411
I am not talking
about the father

1214
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,013
lam talking about the girl

1215
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,276
That's how Angel fell for me

1216
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,045
Bro, some chutney please

1217
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,085
Here

1218
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,695
What are those 2 lines?

1219
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,099
What?

1220
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,062
You mentioned that time
about...making girls fall?

1221
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,768
Making girls?

1222
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,270
To make them fall for you

1223
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,303
Oh! Those 2 lines, eh?

1224
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,444
You want to know?

1225
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,043
Tell me, dude

1226
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,123
Not in a mood today
Tell you tomorrow

1227
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,589
Bro, chutney

1228
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:59,065
I asked for chutney
Not your kidney

1229
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,222
Tell me, dude

1230
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,201
What's wrong with you?

1231
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:04,669
He was just egging you
and you fell for it

1232
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,205
You be quiet
Let him tell

1233
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,366
Can't you just eat
and be quiet?

1234
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,101
What did you say?

1235
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,142
Be quiet and eat

1236
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,439
Is it because you are paying?

1237
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:17,740
I don't want anyone's charity

1238
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,576
- Then don't eat
- I won't

1239
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,016
Sit there, Akku

1240
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,180
I don't want

1241
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,314
- Don't show off
- I said I didn't want

1242
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,381
- I order you, sit
- I won't sit

1243
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,257
- Are you sure?
- Yes, very sure

1244
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,728
Can I take your fish fry?!

1245
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,590
Waiting for me to get up
to eat my fish fry!

1246
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,376
What are those 2 lines?

1247
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,520
All water-

1248
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,423
What the heck?
That isn't correct

1249
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,354
Come to me asking
for snacks this evening

1250
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,088
Then take some more

1251
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:44,763
Is it beef?

1252
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:50,033
I remember, my aunt once ate beef
and the bone got stuck in her throat

1253
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:50,734
Clear out

1254
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,672
I only asked you to be careful

1255
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,266
Pilot is catering

1256
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,640
I feel like jumping
into the pool

1257
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,651
Once my cousin jumped into a pool
They had to drain it to get the body

1258
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,052
- I said it without thinking
- I only cautioned you

1259
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,116
Hey! Don't dump it like that

1260
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,126
This pit is only half dug

1261
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,059
Where is the guy who
was supposed to dig it?

1262
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,993
- Who was it?
- I don't know

1263
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,122
A Hindi speaking guy

1264
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,428
If we dump waste outside
it will create an issue

1265
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,594
That's why we thought
we will bury it here

1266
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,432
Where is this devil gone?

1267
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:52,596
Hindi-man?

1268
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,634
Hey you buffalo!

1269
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,999
Get up, sir

1270
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,441
Let's go home

1271
01:19:31,566 --> 01:19:32,738
Is he dead?

1272
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,243
- Any waste to be dumped, bro?
- No, I have to take 'this' home

1273
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,647
He drank like a dipsomaniac!

1274
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,208
I understood something today

1275
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,345
There is no rich or poor

1276
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,581
Every single person is a base

1277
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:46,114
Well dressed people build
skyscrapers on that base

1278
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,052
He drank 12 of them

1279
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,455
Did you remember to tell Regi
to keep a bottle for us?

1280
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:57,135
Hey! Don't cover it up
There is some more trash

1281
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,297
Don't go

1282
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:01,599
Who the hell was that fool?

1283
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:03,108
He covered up the pit

1284
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,637
Now where do we dump this?

1285
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:06,440
Into the neighbor's plot

1286
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,038
That's our habit
Let's not break it

1287
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:13,152
Haven't we seen him somewhere-

1288
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,414
Come fast

1289
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,756
You think this is
where we will all die?

1290
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,093
Be quiet!

1291
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,101
Every second
you talk about death

1292
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,531
- What is it?
- Who knows?

1293
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,135
There he comes

1294
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,773
- These boys, huh?
- Yes, sir

1295
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,743
In the house where you
went as caterers...

1296
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,580
...a kid is missing

1297
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,121
We called you
to enquire about that

1298
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,450
But how are we concerned?

1299
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:07,162
Was there any stranger
in your catering group?

1300
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,502
No one

1301
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,240
- Are you sure?
- Yes

1302
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,043
I know these boys, sir

1303
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,542
Okay Go

1304
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,109
Someone was an uninvited guest!

1305
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,449
Wonder if they found out
I smuggled some food?

1306
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,717
Why should I be scared?
I do it all the time!

1307
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,492
What were you about to say?

1308
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,428
Yesterday that Hindi speaking man-

1309
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,659
Don't open your mouth
and stuff your feet into it!

1310
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,099
Our tour will go for a toss

1311
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,464
We'll be hassled
with court cases

1312
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,800
- Just come away
- He's looking at us

1313
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,037
Nothing to do with us

1314
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,207
Mommy!

1315
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,189
Give it to me

1316
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,127
No, I won't

1317
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,324
- Give
- I won't

1318
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,932
<i>Gun dear</i>

1319
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:51,342
What will I tell your
Facebook friends?

1320
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,938
<i>Gun dear</i>

1321
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,847
G'ma, look Jenny has come

1322
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:04,254
Ask her to dance and
make it colorful here

1323
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,016
Come, let's go

1324
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:16,699
- Got some?
- No

1325
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,230
Come

1326
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,333
I drive the ambulance

1327
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,745
No policeman will dare stop me
when I drive with the siren

1328
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,947
- Over?
- I finished it

1329
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,346
I shared it with him just now

1330
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,910
How will it be enough?

1331
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,383
Go and tell Regi'chetan
It is for his sake

1332
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:38,818
Ask him, dude

1333
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:40,219
Move

1334
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,088
Wait...wait!

1335
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,687
Give it here

1336
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,221
Happy?

1337
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,162
Softly

1338
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,293
senseless!
Wasted that also

1339
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,261
<i>Gun dear!</i>

1340
01:23:56,665 --> 01:24:00,044
The stuff is over
Should we buy more?

1341
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,348
- What brand?
- MH

1342
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,218
<i>Gun dear</i>

1343
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:33,003
I don't know if this is
the right time to ask

1344
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,011
But still-

1345
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,139
What now?

1346
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,249
What were the 2 lines
of that song?

1347
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,047
Are you still
thinking of that?

1348
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,016
Don't take her away

1349
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,183
How will she take
a 'selfie' now?

1350
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:48,421
Let me take one
for the last time

1351
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:50,764
<i>Gun dear!</i>

1352
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,236
Get up, Akku

1353
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,796
This cannot be carried in the lift

1354
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,136
Move your leg

1355
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,013
Tell me where the rest
of the booze is and then sleep

1356
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,080
Wake up, man

1357
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,784
Don't behave like rogues
in a funeral house

1358
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,782
Wait until you have a funeral
in your own house!

1359
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:15,913
I'll get back at you guys

1360
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,217
I won't buy you
a single drink

1361
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,883
I swear on my dead g'ma

1362
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,190
- That's cheating
- Wasting money going after it

1363
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,357
Why is that a different color?

1364
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,965
He drinks only Horlicks

1365
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:31,766
Of course
Such a baby!

1366
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,200
Why are they drinking
senselessly like this?

1367
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,901
Out of sheer sorrow, my dear girl

1368
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,911
Why not?
Sorrow indeed!

1369
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:43,313
He said he wanted to meet
Faisal regarding his ticket

1370
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:44,750
Wonder if he'll wake up

1371
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,650
He'll manage
Don't worry

1372
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:51,952
They keep saying Pattaya
What is so special there?

1373
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,050
There are many
statues of Buddha

1374
01:25:54,115 --> 01:25:57,028
They must be going there to pray

1375
01:25:57,853 --> 01:25:59,924
Lord Buddha!

1376
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:04,727
Yuck!
What a stink!

1377
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:06,033
Ugh!

1378
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:10,241
Haven't you completed
this sewage work as yet?

1379
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,868
They will finish it

1380
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:13,412
You don't have to bother

1381
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:32,922
What is this, my boy?!

1382
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:36,367
You drink tea also like
you're gulping down booze

1383
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:37,761
Did dad leave early?

1384
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,167
Yes

1385
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,677
Aren't you going to school?

1386
01:26:44,733 --> 01:26:46,337
I have fever

1387
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,278
Fever?

1388
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,338
Don't pretend
Go to school

1389
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,412
Really, she is running
a high temperature

1390
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,381
I must take her to the doctor

1391
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,916
Let me see

1392
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:02,227
You are mad

1393
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:03,786
Nothing is wrong with her

1394
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,226
Here
Go see a doctor

1395
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,270
If she's sick...

1396
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:12,964
hands and legs
start trembling in fear

1397
01:27:13,028 --> 01:27:15,167
Then it's better you
go and see the doctor

1398
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,007
As the tour comes nearer
hospital duty beckons you!

1399
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,139
Why don't you arrange more
alliances like you did for Rasmina?

1400
01:27:30,946 --> 01:27:32,892
I must cut my hair today

1401
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:36,322
All salons are closed on Tuesdays

1402
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,255
Guys always think of
a haircut only on a Tuesday

1403
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,398
- Are you okay?
- You bet!

1404
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,398
I actually came to talk to you

1405
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:49,707
What is it, bro?

1406
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,411
Shall we sit over
a cup of coffee?

1407
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,179
Will you pay for it?

1408
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:55,111
It's okay

1409
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,672
I'll tell you right away

1410
01:27:58,173 --> 01:27:59,311
Just a minute

1411
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:03,814
Do you remember me?

1412
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:08,057
I was the one who
drove you to the hospital

1413
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,695
So do you want money?

1414
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,894
I don't want any darn thing

1415
01:28:17,092 --> 01:28:20,301
A good deed deserves
a simple word of thanks

1416
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:23,642
What did you want to tell us?

1417
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,006
What is it, mother?

1418
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:29,707
What happened?

1419
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,949
We'll be there at once

1420
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,683
Sabu'cheta, I'll call you this evening

1421
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,115
- What is it?
- Nothing

1422
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:36,748
- Tell us what happened
- Just come

1423
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:38,955
What is it?

1424
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,367
What happened?

1425
01:28:50,959 --> 01:28:52,199
What is it?

1426
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,763
I don't know
You find out for yourself

1427
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,201
Akku!

1428
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:06,844
What happened, man?

1429
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,819
What happened?

1430
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,419
Answer us

1431
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:22,097
Tell us what it is

1432
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:24,032
Didn't you go buy the ticket?

1433
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,829
I did, but I couldn't buy

1434
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,646
Sorry, brother

1435
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,778
This will be your last

1436
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:38,915
Where were you looking?

1437
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,247
I didn't see
It was so sudden

1438
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:41,218
Couldn't you see?

1439
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:42,687
Sorry, bro,
I did not notice you

1440
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,189
You apologize
after banging into me

1441
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:45,246
I was reversing and so-

1442
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:46,690
Did you see the front of my bike?

1443
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,318
Pay me for this damage
Who will repair this?

1444
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,159
- No, brother
- Give me money, man

1445
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:02,707
Did I not ask you
to stop, you pig?!

1446
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:14,753
Who was he?

1447
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:16,244
Forget it

1448
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,288
Who was that guy?

1449
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:24,797
He's one of them
from the 'Andhakar' colony

1450
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:28,159
Let's go

1451
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:57,023
They belong to that Sabbati colony

1452
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,999
Don't go
Those boys are all rogues

1453
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:05,098
Your son is very dear to our heart

1454
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,261
Partner

1455
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,402
Anyone who has hurt him
will pay dearly for it

1456
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,809
We'll come back
only after we take revenge

1457
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,004
Come, dude

1458
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:16,109
Let's go

1459
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,691
Get down

1460
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:28,718
Get down for a minute

1461
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:22,913
Why don't we take
our revenge tomorrow?

1462
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,321
Yuck! Is this
the way to sleep?

1463
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,920
Wake up, Akku
I brought you Horlicks

1464
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,862
That was for him

1465
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,969
That's mine

1466
01:32:58,106 --> 01:32:59,676
Who threw this?

1467
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:01,277
What is it?
Bill for milk?

1468
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,389
Hold this for a second

1469
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:08,990
I like you a lot

1470
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:15,701
You imp Pathu
Was that you?

1471
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:18,094
Just you wait!

1472
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:20,965
You don't have to tell us this

1473
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:22,872
She wrote it to someone else

1474
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,409
Tell me the truth
Who is it?

1475
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,201
But I did not write it

1476
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:28,008
- Then who did?
- I won't tell

1477
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:30,071
You won't?
Tell me the truth

1478
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:33,152
Hey! You better tell or
he'll squeeze you to death

1479
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,878
Jenny chechi

1480
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,384
My dear Jenny!

1481
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:48,718
“Over the mist laden hills and vales
Come sing with me o' beautiful Koel“

1482
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:59,003
What have you got to do
in my song sequence?

1483
01:33:59,067 --> 01:33:59,977
Your song?

1484
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:02,173
What if she had
intended it for me?

1485
01:34:02,337 --> 01:34:04,783
At least come with
a good costume, man!

1486
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:07,046
Look at the absurd way
you are dressed

1487
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:09,116
Let's go, eh?

1488
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:10,415
Come

1489
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:31,669
“Golden deer honey sweet
Shimmering fish slipping neat“

1490
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:35,237
“Apple of my eye, sugar
I dream of you forever“

1491
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,911
“Just once let me caress“

1492
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:39,007
“Don't say no please! “

1493
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:41,212
“Let me whisper
sweet-nothings in your ear“

1494
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:42,652
“You are my desire“

1495
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,850
“Like the rainbow in a sky azure
Men will fall for your smile for sure“

1496
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:48,154
“Golden figure blossoming“

1497
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:50,355
“Like cadamba the love-flower blooming“

1498
01:34:51,386 --> 01:34:57,860
“Anklets tinkling
Mischief sprinkling“

1499
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,001
“Golden deer honey sweet
Shimmering fish slipping neat“

1500
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:06,773
“Apple of my eye, sugar
I dream of you forever“

1501
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,405
“Just once let me caress“

1502
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:13,218
“Let me whisper
sweet-nothings in your ear“

1503
01:35:13,841 --> 01:35:17,050
“Like the rainbow in a sky azure
Men will fall for your smile for sure“

1504
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:19,352
“Golden figure blossoming“

1505
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:22,254
“Like cadamba the love-flower blooming“

1506
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:28,366
“Anklets tinkling
Mischief sprinkling“

1507
01:35:33,161 --> 01:35:36,165
'This is not the way to make girls fall'

1508
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,971
'I'll teach you how'

1509
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:39,873
'Come, my love'

1510
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:41,844
'Throw away this shameless fellow'

1511
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:00,429
“Oh youth, hey loony
I am in love with you madly“

1512
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:03,999
“Say yes to love
'coz you live only once“

1513
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:07,369
“Oh youth, hey loony
I am in love with you madly“

1514
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:11,103
“Say yes to love
'coz you live only once“

1515
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:14,438
“Whether you know or not
I am crazy, truly besotted“

1516
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,204
“God made us
'Made for each other“'

1517
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,045
“I am your hero forever“

1518
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:21,382
“Whether you know or not
I am crazy, truly besotted“

1519
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:23,212
“God made us
'Made for each other“'

1520
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,984
“I am your hero forever“

1521
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:26,184
“Love and be loved“

1522
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:28,386
"In my heart as long as I live"

1523
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:36,060
“My dearest, come near
Listen, I want to tell you, dear“

1524
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:40,866
“Golden figure blossoming“

1525
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:43,238
“Like cadamba the love-flower blooming“

1526
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:49,946
“Anklets tinkling
Mischief sprinkling“

1527
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:54,211
Bless you!

1528
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,915
My dearest Jenny, you will
fall sick dancing in this rain

1529
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,047
That too with such crazy fellows
Hold this umbrella

1530
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:02,822
I must tell you something urgent

1531
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:07,066
I taught them that dance

1532
01:37:07,255 --> 01:37:08,393
Come with us

1533
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:11,192
Jenny, go away
These fellows are not normal

1534
01:37:11,726 --> 01:37:14,673
All these days you hated girls
Now what happened?

1535
01:37:14,729 --> 01:37:16,970
You are excited after
reading her letter, aren't you?

1536
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:19,136
Did she send it to your house?

1537
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,677
TO yours?

1538
01:37:20,902 --> 01:37:21,937
She gave it to me

1539
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,641
Read it if you want

1540
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,876
Jenny, my dear
Are the dancers ready?

1541
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,048
I like you very much

1542
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:33,017
To my Akbar

1543
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,286
Goodness!

1544
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:37,022
What does she see in him?

1545
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:03,822
“The moment I saw you, my lovely“

1546
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:07,324
“My words got stuck totally“

1547
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:13,426
“As it is you're so sweet
It's music when you speak“

1548
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,861
“That's why every night
chatting with you is a delight“

1549
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:23,065
“Love makes me mad
Don't feel bad“

1550
01:38:23,164 --> 01:38:26,270
“That's my heart
Gold 24 carat“

1551
01:38:26,334 --> 01:38:29,338
"if you fall in love true
is that the end of you?"

1552
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,742
“Will your mind filled with ego
forget me, tell me now“

1553
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:35,945
“My heart beats there, my dear
Draws your face very clear“

1554
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,115
“Golden figure blossoming“

1555
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:40,658
“Like cadamba the love-flower blooming“

1556
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:46,663
“Anklets tinkling
Mischief sprinkling“

1557
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:59,005
As decided at the meeting of
Girinagar residents association...

1558
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:02,013
...next Sunday we celebrate
our 1st anniversary

1559
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:04,149
Jenny has offered
to organize a dance

1560
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:06,376
Who else is performing?

1561
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,048
I have a mono act to present

1562
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,110
'A fisherman's mishap'

1563
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:11,417
Shut up!

1564
01:39:11,846 --> 01:39:14,156
Jenny has promised to
teach us 'kitchen dance'

1565
01:39:14,215 --> 01:39:15,387
That's the last straw!

1566
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:16,890
I am not joining you

1567
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,294
These kids can dance

1568
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:19,592
That too at this age-

1569
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,257
What age?

1570
01:39:21,656 --> 01:39:23,602
You don't have to come
I will take part in all the items

1571
01:39:23,658 --> 01:39:24,966
Dyeing your hair
won't make you young!

1572
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,300
Who is applying dye?

1573
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,863
Enough! You can
discuss all that later

1574
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:31,671
Master! Before that the sewage
canal must be covered

1575
01:39:31,766 --> 01:39:33,211
Kids run all over that place

1576
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:36,111
They have promised
to finish it this week

1577
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,307
Shall we wind up this meeting?

1578
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:40,113
Master!
Just a minute

1579
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:42,980
Do you have any item
for the program?

1580
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:45,146
We have programs
only off the stage!

1581
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:47,283
Sabu'chetan wants
to say something

1582
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:48,292
Go ahead and say it

1583
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:50,158
Opinions are always welcome

1584
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:51,287
Yes

1585
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,326
Go...go

1586
01:40:04,865 --> 01:40:06,970
I don't belong to this colony

1587
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:10,013
But many of you know me

1588
01:40:10,071 --> 01:40:10,879
I am Sabu

1589
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:12,110
Jadayi Sa-

1590
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,881
Some people call me that also

1591
01:40:15,076 --> 01:40:16,248
I am an ambulance driver

1592
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:19,888
I don't know if this is the right time

1593
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:23,257
But since everyone is here

1594
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:28,598
All these days I was in a mad rush
saving lives of other people

1595
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,696
Now I feel I too want
a life of my own

1596
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:35,637
I feel awkward saying this

1597
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:40,707
If caste and religion
are of no consequence...

1598
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:46,641
...can I take care
of Rasmina and Pathu?

1599
01:40:57,985 --> 01:41:00,898
I may not be very affluent
but I will take care of their needs

1600
01:41:00,955 --> 01:41:02,662
They will not starve for sure

1601
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:08,732
lam not doing this out of pity

1602
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:10,408
I really like her

1603
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:16,610
I also know you are
all the family she has

1604
01:41:16,971 --> 01:41:20,817
That is why I came here
to ask your permission

1605
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:23,043
Rasmina is not like my daughter

1606
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:24,789
She IS my daughter

1607
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,590
This time we won't decide
about her life hastily

1608
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:37,028
We understand how she feels

1609
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:41,229
We are very happy
to entrust her to you

1610
01:41:44,999 --> 01:41:49,106
So let's clap and pass this?

1611
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:12,099
Mom, wait

1612
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:31,851
We should have
asked Rasmina first

1613
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:32,924
True

1614
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:35,756
He felt humiliated
in front of everyone

1615
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:38,830
Why don't you call him?

1616
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:40,430
He was quite upset

1617
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:42,097
That's true
Call him

1618
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:06,219
I think he is dead

1619
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,156
He's moving

1620
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:08,716
If we stop, we'll get into trouble

1621
01:43:08,883 --> 01:43:09,725
Let's go

1622
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:12,789
'How does it concern us?'

1623
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,899
'One day if we are
lying on the road...'

1624
01:43:14,989 --> 01:43:17,936
'...I just hope I don't die
like an abandoned dog'

1625
01:44:11,145 --> 01:44:14,217
Who brought me here?

1626
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:34,407
Thanks

1627
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:35,911
Why?

1628
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:39,076
For some actions
thanks isn't necessary at all

1629
01:44:44,411 --> 01:44:45,389
Gone...gone

1630
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:46,157
It's my turn now

1631
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:47,692
No, it isn't

1632
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:48,385
It's my game

1633
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:49,659
You are cheating

1634
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:50,887
No, you are cheating, grandpa

1635
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,760
- Then I'm not playing
- Okay, don't play

1636
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,197
- What is it, my boy?
- Where is he?

1637
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:56,225
- He's in there
- Come out, dude

1638
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:56,961
What is it?

1639
01:44:56,991 --> 01:44:58,698
Oh! You are here?

1640
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,761
You are the one
who should see it

1641
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:01,898
What is it?

1642
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,101
Come with me, dude
It's a suspense thriller

1643
01:45:04,164 --> 01:45:05,438
Come

1644
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:20,919
Study well, okay?

1645
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:22,187
Good morning, chem

1646
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:27,061
- What is it, man?
- I'll show you

1647
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,797
Is it a wedding?

1648
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,900
See you

1649
01:45:39,233 --> 01:45:41,213
Go, but seeing you again
is highly doubtful

1650
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:42,246
Anyway let's see

1651
01:45:42,302 --> 01:45:43,679
God help me

1652
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:45,075
What is it?

1653
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:47,311
- What is the matter?
- I'll tell you

1654
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:51,187
Remember he used to
water plants on his terrace?

1655
01:45:51,378 --> 01:45:52,823
Do you know what it was?

1656
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,154
Ganja cultivation

1657
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:02,858
Bribe them and
try to come out

1658
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,833
Bribing is wrong, isn't it?

1659
01:46:08,996 --> 01:46:10,998
Goody-goody U n n I!

1660
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:31,891
How awful!

1661
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,070
- That is too much
- It is very simple

1662
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:43,130
I can't do that

1663
01:46:43,197 --> 01:46:45,939
Jenny is more of a match for me

1664
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:47,343
Let us dance together

1665
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,881
- Hear...hear!
- Made for each other

1666
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,375
Toothless actor Prem Nazir

1667
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:53,947
Count me out

1668
01:46:54,108 --> 01:46:56,679
Mammali's Body Show
is better than this

1669
01:46:58,812 --> 01:47:01,088
Next is Pathu's mono act

1670
01:47:01,148 --> 01:47:03,253
A round of applause for Pathu

1671
01:47:03,317 --> 01:47:05,058
I will do it on stage

1672
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:06,393
No way

1673
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:08,064
You rehearse first
and then on stage

1674
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,792
- She will do it
- No, I won't

1675
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:12,201
Come, Path u

1676
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:14,068
Go...do it

1677
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:16,968
Look, she'll begin now

1678
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:21,335
Do it

1679
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:25,109
Greetings

1680
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,083
lam...

1681
01:47:28,342 --> 01:47:29,616
here...

1682
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,187
today to...!

1683
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:38,229
Pathu...my dear

1684
01:47:38,385 --> 01:47:39,989
What happened?

1685
01:47:42,156 --> 01:47:45,137
Fooled you...got you!

1686
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:49,933
This is how a kid with
stage-fright will act!

1687
01:47:50,898 --> 01:47:52,002
Smart girl

1688
01:47:52,065 --> 01:47:53,976
You scared us
out of our wits

1689
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:56,173
My dear, you were superb

1690
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:58,750
This is not super
I'll spank you for this

1691
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,182
You can sing the poem...

1692
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,846
...for which you won
the 1st prize in school

1693
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:04,086
That's true

1694
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,748
Then I can do what she did

1695
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:06,790
Verrrry good!

1696
01:48:06,847 --> 01:48:07,655
Wait and watch

1697
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:09,126
All of you will be dumbstruck

1698
01:48:09,383 --> 01:48:12,193
'Girinagar Residents Association
1st year Anniversary'

1699
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:29,672
Open it

1700
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:31,374
Hold the vessel

1701
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:35,179
Don't be greedy

1702
01:48:35,242 --> 01:48:36,880
Just checking
if it was original

1703
01:48:37,144 --> 01:48:38,214
Bun is ready

1704
01:48:39,213 --> 01:48:40,214
Put it in

1705
01:48:48,155 --> 01:48:49,998
Chechi, care for a bun?

1706
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:52,100
She doesn't like buns

1707
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:53,638
These guys are always joking

1708
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:55,367
- Sir, bun?
- Get lost

1709
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:57,169
Isn't that what I also asked?

1710
01:48:57,631 --> 01:48:59,975
Next is a dance by Jenny

1711
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:02,741
Which has never been
performed before

1712
01:49:02,803 --> 01:49:05,147
Raise the curtain

1713
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:07,082
My girl's dance

1714
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,745
- Move away
- Get lost

1715
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:37,145
Move away

1716
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:48,927
Hey! Move
I can't see

1717
01:49:51,818 --> 01:49:52,922
Now, no problem

1718
01:49:52,986 --> 01:49:55,057
What the heck?!
Sexual assault, eh?

1719
01:49:55,122 --> 01:49:57,261
Why would I hit on
such an ugly creature!

1720
01:50:00,394 --> 01:50:01,930
What are you up to?

1721
01:50:02,396 --> 01:50:03,636
I'm coming

1722
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:05,968
Go quickly, man

1723
01:50:06,233 --> 01:50:08,179
I'll meet you outside, pig!

1724
01:50:08,402 --> 01:50:10,109
What are you up to?

1725
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,241
He is reeking of booze

1726
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:23,857
Our next item is-

1727
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:24,827
Next is mine

1728
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:25,926
Someone else has to perform

1729
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:26,794
No, let me do mine

1730
01:50:26,853 --> 01:50:28,992
Remember what Pathu did the other day?

1731
01:50:29,056 --> 01:50:30,000
I'll do that

1732
01:50:30,057 --> 01:50:31,764
It will be a great act!

1733
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:36,372
Now we have
a mono-act from Regi

1734
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,641
Pathu, he's doing
what you did

1735
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:46,840
Dear members of-

1736
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:49,212
Why isn't anyone coming?

1737
01:50:49,276 --> 01:50:51,051
Get up and go!

1738
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:54,085
Go

1739
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:55,624
I am acting

1740
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:56,888
Get out, man

1741
01:50:57,284 --> 01:51:00,163
- He must be drunk
- I swear I am not

1742
01:51:00,287 --> 01:51:01,925
You'll laugh
I promise you it'll be funny

1743
01:51:01,988 --> 01:51:02,932
Get out, man

1744
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,866
He is not even steady on his feet

1745
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:06,028
Come, 9113/5

1746
01:51:07,027 --> 01:51:08,870
It's not over yet

1747
01:51:08,929 --> 01:51:10,306
It will be funny

1748
01:51:10,364 --> 01:51:12,401
You'll laugh at the climax

1749
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:14,036
Please be calm

1750
01:51:14,134 --> 01:51:18,605
Next is a beautiful song by Fathima

1751
01:51:34,187 --> 01:51:40,934
“Once in my garden in a corner
With love I grew a jasmine creeper“

1752
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:47,639
“I watered it, my heart truly happy
with feathered dreams created a canopy“

1753
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:54,243
“A cool breeze delightfully
touched those tendrils daintily“

1754
01:51:54,307 --> 01:52:03,318
“A few days later he came out of the blue
My cherished buds into darkness he threw“

1755
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:10,960
“Once in my garden in a corner
With love I grew a jasmine creeper“

1756
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:17,736
“A cool breeze delightfully
touched those tendrils daintily“

1757
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:26,851
“A few days later he came out of the blue
My cherished buds into darkness he threw“

1758
01:52:34,714 --> 01:52:41,154
“Hands with bangles jingling clapped
I could not hear the parakeet's ballad“

1759
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:48,135
“No game could I play happily
with the squirrel or magpie easily“

1760
01:52:48,662 --> 01:52:55,204
“When angels land in my garden
riding on chariots from heaven“

1761
01:52:55,268 --> 01:53:00,081
“I don't have garlands of jasmine
to welcome these fairies divine“

1762
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:04,885
“I don't have gold or pearls either
but in my garden nurtured with care“

1763
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:11,328
“Once in my garden in a corner
With love I grew a jasmine creeper“

1764
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:18,164
“A cool breeze delightfully
touched those tendrils daintily“

1765
01:53:18,225 --> 01:53:27,077
“A few days later he came out of the blue
My cherished buds into darkness he threw“

1766
01:53:35,008 --> 01:53:41,687
“I wished, sweet spring will arrive
to befriend the moon and dragonfly“

1767
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:48,825
“On lips sweet smiles to bestow
A never fading golden glow“

1768
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:55,668
“Hoping koels with beaks caressing
sang on trees a special blessing“

1769
01:53:55,729 --> 01:54:00,439
“Wishing the forest streams saunter
like anklet bells ringing in laughter“

1770
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:05,080
“I longed for my dreams to flower
Once in my garden in a corner“

1771
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:11,885
“Once in my garden in a corner
With love I grew a jasmine creeper“

1772
01:54:11,945 --> 01:54:18,328
“A cool breeze delightfully
touched those tendrils daintily“

1773
01:54:18,385 --> 01:54:27,703
“A few days later he came out of the blue
My cherished buds into darkness he threw“

1774
01:54:41,207 --> 01:54:43,016
Wow! What a resounding applause!

1775
01:54:43,076 --> 01:54:44,987
Fathima rocked

1776
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:47,319
If that's how one gets applause
I too would have sung

1777
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:50,293
Yes, and we'll have to run around
to arrange your funeral

1778
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:51,852
I have an idea

1779
01:54:51,985 --> 01:54:54,864
Let's present that 2 line song

1780
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:55,899
Which one?

1781
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:59,798
The one you sing
looking at a girls' eyes

1782
01:54:59,993 --> 01:55:01,768
That can't be done here

1783
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:03,136
That's for ladies only

1784
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:05,236
Lungi dance?!

1785
01:55:08,735 --> 01:55:10,442
Go...she has started dancing

1786
01:55:10,704 --> 01:55:12,012
I am going

1787
01:55:12,105 --> 01:55:13,175
Let's go

1788
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:31,166
What is it?

1789
01:55:31,224 --> 01:55:32,703
Look! That is the rascal

1790
01:55:32,993 --> 01:55:33,801
Which rascal?

1791
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,100
Remember that fellow who hit me?

1792
01:55:35,161 --> 01:55:37,698
He's the one from 'Andhakar' colony

1793
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:41,702
How dare he dance here?!

1794
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:42,745
You Vagabond!

1795
01:55:45,805 --> 01:55:49,651
How dare you dance here
after hitting our partner?

1796
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:51,279
Don't leave him

1797
01:55:53,747 --> 01:55:54,919
Are you running away?

1798
01:55:57,851 --> 01:55:59,125
Catch him

1799
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:00,789
Stop right there

1800
01:56:00,887 --> 01:56:02,264
Don't let him go

1801
01:56:06,059 --> 01:56:07,697
Run...run

1802
01:56:07,761 --> 01:56:09,206
Catch him

1803
01:56:11,031 --> 01:56:13,307
Have you seen Pathu?

1804
01:56:20,607 --> 01:56:22,814
Pathu is missing

1805
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,378
Where is Pathu?

1806
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:26,655
Did you see my daughter?

1807
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,985
My daughter is missing

1808
01:56:29,215 --> 01:56:31,195
She must be somewhere here

1809
01:56:31,251 --> 01:56:33,060
She must be with the other kids

1810
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,893
Don't cry

1811
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:24,201
My little girl!

1812
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:56,904
“Once in my garden in a corner
With love I grew a jasmine creeper“

1813
01:58:58,164 --> 01:59:07,676
“I watered it, my heart truly happy
with feathered dreams created a canopy“

1814
01:59:08,708 --> 01:59:13,708
“A cool breeze delightfully
touched those tendrils daintily“

1815
01:59:19,752 --> 01:59:24,752
“A few days later he came out of the blue
My cherished buds into darkness he threw“

1816
01:59:52,252 --> 01:59:53,822
'I am calling from
the travel agency'

1817
01:59:53,887 --> 01:59:56,060
'Sir, Pattaya tour tickets
have been issued'

1818
01:59:56,122 --> 01:59:57,863
'The tour package details!

1819
02:00:06,099 --> 02:00:10,104
Listen! Take it easy

1820
02:00:11,971 --> 02:00:14,952
You got one more
calamity to narrate

1821
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:34,197
You must come to
the police station at once

1822
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:37,005
The Chief inspector
wants to meet you

1823
02:00:44,938 --> 02:00:47,009
We haven't got
any more information

1824
02:00:48,141 --> 02:00:53,147
No, I am on a sacred vow
Otherwise I would've-

1825
02:00:53,947 --> 02:00:55,620
Please give me 2 days, sir

1826
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:02,155
Where was the kid staying?

1827
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:03,892
In my house

1828
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,934
What is the matter?

1829
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:05,662
What?

1830
02:01:05,725 --> 02:01:06,703
What is the matter?

1831
02:01:06,759 --> 02:01:07,897
Nothing

1832
02:01:07,961 --> 02:01:11,306
Recently there were
reports of missing kids

1833
02:01:12,231 --> 02:01:14,768
All of them were
girls below 10 years

1834
02:01:14,834 --> 02:01:19,305
3 of those girls were found dead
in 3 different places

1835
02:01:19,605 --> 02:01:23,917
Coincidentally, they had
all been sexually assaulted

1836
02:01:26,746 --> 02:01:27,781
Sir, what are you...

1837
02:01:27,847 --> 02:01:29,019
"saying?

1838
02:01:29,048 --> 02:01:32,757
The post mortem report says
your Fathima also-

1839
02:01:41,594 --> 02:01:43,369
Wait! I haven't finished yet

1840
02:01:45,264 --> 02:01:51,078
Based on facts from locations
where these kids were found...

1841
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:53,117
...we have zeroed in on a suspect

1842
02:02:02,281 --> 02:02:04,727
Dhapan, a Bengali

1843
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:08,028
After serving a jail term in Bengal
for assaulting a 5 year old...

1844
02:02:08,087 --> 02:02:10,397
...he is just out
A habitual offender

1845
02:02:11,157 --> 02:02:15,628
He was seen in those areas
where the kids went missing

1846
02:02:19,365 --> 02:02:21,072
Have you seen him?

1847
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:26,082
Yes, sir

1848
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:28,345
When?
Where?

1849
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:33,051
'Who is that?'

1850
02:02:33,246 --> 02:02:35,988
'He must have come
for some tender coconuts'

1851
02:02:36,182 --> 02:02:38,287
'We've seen him somewhere'

1852
02:02:39,752 --> 02:02:40,787
'Come, dude'

1853
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:45,134
We actually suspected him

1854
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,192
Really?

1855
02:02:46,259 --> 02:02:48,068
And what did you do about it?

1856
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:49,970
Tell me, what did you do?

1857
02:02:50,997 --> 02:02:52,670
What can you do, right?

1858
02:02:52,899 --> 02:02:54,105
None of your business, eh?

1859
02:02:54,167 --> 02:02:57,944
Why take unnecessary
responsibility for someone else

1860
02:02:58,104 --> 02:03:00,106
Never do anything worthwhile

1861
02:03:00,907 --> 02:03:03,114
But why are you affected now?

1862
02:03:04,343 --> 02:03:07,813
When it concerns your own family
makes your stomach churn, right?

1863
02:03:10,283 --> 02:03:14,288
If you had complained, a small hint
that girl would have been alive today

1864
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:15,696
You wastrel-

1865
02:03:16,289 --> 02:03:17,962
God forgive me!

1866
02:03:26,132 --> 02:03:27,304
Sir, we never imagined-

1867
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:28,344
Shut up!

1868
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:34,749
You don't react promptly and
you come here and moan, eh?

1869
02:03:35,041 --> 02:03:36,748
Shameless fellows

1870
02:03:36,809 --> 02:03:38,811
Spineless creatures!

1871
02:03:39,378 --> 02:03:41,756
Call yourself youngsters

1872
02:03:42,782 --> 02:03:46,855
Full of booze and drugs
you're blind to everything

1873
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:50,067
Didn't he kidnap that kid
right under your nose?

1874
02:03:50,123 --> 02:03:51,363
Suspected him

1875
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,926
Go home kids

1876
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:55,898
Go home, have dinner and
tuck yourselves into bed

1877
02:03:55,995 --> 02:03:57,736
You guys are fit only for that

1878
02:03:57,763 --> 02:04:00,437
This is our job, right?
We'll catch him

1879
02:04:00,933 --> 02:04:03,311
We must, right?
We will

1880
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:05,079
We will for sure

1881
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:09,083
I too have a daughter this young

1882
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,457
You can go

1883
02:04:17,283 --> 02:04:18,762
Get out!

1884
02:04:28,728 --> 02:04:29,968
Sir

1885
02:04:32,265 --> 02:04:34,142
You won't get him

1886
02:04:35,368 --> 02:04:41,410
No other kid will have to go through
what happened to our Pathu

1887
02:05:25,284 --> 02:05:26,854
Yo u

1888
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:47,114
Wait there

1889
02:05:49,408 --> 02:05:51,649
Pay me for the broken pots

1890
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,769
Give me my money

1891
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:24,744
No! Don't

1892
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:26,719
Let me go

1893
02:11:26,779 --> 02:11:27,917
I want to chop him up

1894
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:30,722
I want to kill the guy
who killed our Pathu

1895
02:11:30,783 --> 02:11:31,989
Move

1896
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:33,961
Chop him, dude

1897
02:11:34,019 --> 02:11:35,293
True! He ought to die

1898
02:11:35,354 --> 02:11:37,891
He was the one
who killed all of them

1899
02:11:37,957 --> 02:11:41,131
But your Pathu was
not killed by him

1900
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:26,106
What the hell are you doing?

1901
02:12:27,072 --> 02:12:31,953
This is the man...who killed Pathu
and dumped her into the drain

1902
02:12:35,981 --> 02:12:38,928
Me?
Don't talk rubbish!

1903
02:12:39,318 --> 02:12:43,061
That poor kid was always
hanging around you, master

1904
02:12:44,223 --> 02:12:47,670
Don't believe them
They are crazy

1905
02:12:47,726 --> 02:12:50,434
Yes, we are mad

1906
02:12:51,163 --> 02:12:54,042
These simple souls
will easily believe you

1907
02:12:54,299 --> 02:12:57,178
Isn't that how you
made him also 'mad'

1908
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:20,368
Why don't you
sing a song, Sanju?

1909
02:13:20,626 --> 02:13:21,195
<i>No</i>

1910
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,137
- Then let's go home
- No, I won't come

1911
02:13:23,195 --> 02:13:23,969
You are evil

1912
02:13:24,029 --> 02:13:26,031
Better come with me
Otherwise I'll kill you

1913
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:27,304
I won't come hereafter

1914
02:13:27,366 --> 02:13:30,939
I will tell your parents everything

1915
02:13:31,203 --> 02:13:32,307
No! Please don't

1916
02:13:32,404 --> 02:13:33,815
Then come with me

1917
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:24,793
Beat him to death
The dirty pig!

1918
02:14:25,691 --> 02:14:28,865
Such a satanic fellow!

1919
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:30,940
Beat him till he dies,
bloody lowlife

1920
02:14:30,996 --> 02:14:34,205
No one must ever
stoop so low ever again

1921
02:14:34,266 --> 02:14:35,836
Give it to him!

1922
02:14:39,304 --> 02:14:41,250
He isn't the only one to be killed

1923
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,843
We don't want any one
like him here anymore

1924
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:45,217
Die!

1925
02:15:03,162 --> 02:15:05,369
Sir, this is getting out of hand

1926
02:15:05,664 --> 02:15:07,109
Let them do
what they want, dude

1927
02:15:07,166 --> 02:15:10,739
We arrest them with great difficulty,
bring them to court, punish them

1928
02:15:10,903 --> 02:15:12,177
And send them to jail
For what joy?

1929
02:15:12,237 --> 02:15:14,376
To feed them mutton and
make their bodies beefy, eh?

1930
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:18,387
There are already many of them
in there...minus a leg or a hand

1931
02:15:19,344 --> 02:15:23,121
Such perverted guys
must not be punished by us

1932
02:15:23,315 --> 02:15:24,919
The affected people must do it

1933
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,043
Rip him to pieces, my girl

1934
02:16:58,110 --> 02:17:00,112
What they did
was perfectly right

1935
02:17:01,713 --> 02:17:03,886
We often read
about it in the papers...

1936
02:17:03,982 --> 02:17:07,020
...and felt like reacting
just like what they actually did

1937
02:17:07,252 --> 02:17:10,893
But your friends were a little too late

1938
02:17:10,956 --> 02:17:15,427
But why didn't we see you
even in a single scene?

1939
02:17:19,164 --> 02:17:24,045
'He and his blessed Pattaya!
Faisal must be the bad influence'

1940
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:26,912
'Go tell Faisal
He'll set it right'

1941
02:17:27,139 --> 02:17:30,848
'He said he was meeting Faisal
to get tickets for the tour'

1942
02:17:33,211 --> 02:17:37,091
Get your tickets ready
I'll take care of the rest

1943
02:17:38,617 --> 02:17:41,826
But you haven't yet told us
how you fell from your bike

1944
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:04,747
'A few months later
on a pay-day'

1945
02:18:12,818 --> 02:18:13,922
See you!

1946
02:18:17,222 --> 02:18:17,927
What is it?

1947
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:19,295
It's Faisal

1948
02:18:19,358 --> 02:18:20,735
Put the phone on speaker

1949
02:18:20,792 --> 02:18:23,966
Sing the 2 lines of the song
you woo the girls with

1950
02:18:24,029 --> 02:18:26,009
There are many here
waiting to hear it

1951
02:18:26,064 --> 02:18:26,974
Sing it, man

1952
02:18:27,032 --> 02:18:28,067
Sing it at least now

1953
02:18:28,133 --> 02:18:30,044
- Bro, please
- So I sing it, eh?

1954
02:18:30,102 --> 02:18:31,376
Sure

1955
02:18:34,339 --> 02:18:36,182
After so long...finally!

1956
02:18:39,644 --> 02:18:44,218
“New face...another new face“

1957
02:18:44,282 --> 02:18:46,694
“New face...“

1958
02:18:49,121 --> 02:18:52,159
You rascal
Wait there...you!

1959
02:18:52,224 --> 02:18:55,797
