1
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:13,712
The story is set in the society
prevailing in 1991-92...

2
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:18,050
...couldn't remove all the boards,
vehicles from the scene..,

3
00:01:18,223 --> 00:01:26,892
...since it has not importance to story,
viewers would forgive us.

4
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:45,410
Past is chasing!

5
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:47,575
Future is terrorizing!

6
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,085
To escape l've only one region!
Present!

7
00:01:57,262 --> 00:02:02,427
Just present only!

8
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:17,272
1991, April

9
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,970
Mr. Father!

10
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,975
Give me a cigarette!

11
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,141
How was the journey, father?

12
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:03,325
lf you want to scold me,
do it right on my face!

13
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:07,158
l didn't expect you'd give a
cigarette immediately on asking!

14
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,323
l expected you'd say quit smoking!

15
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,162
Father, a small confession.

16
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,827
l've started drinking Beer recently.

17
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,671
That's not the reason
for your silence.

18
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,165
Tell me the truth.

19
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:25,840
When asked what your son is doing,
l'm losing my honour.

20
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:31,346
Playing guitar is not
profession or my hobby too, dad.

21
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,354
Just for pocket money.

22
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:37,518
lf you say yes, you can buy
that pub with your pocket money.

23
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:44,700
Do you know the share value
of your company?

24
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:49,538
Now, your property is Rs.500 crores!

25
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:59,878
Don't pull me into your sensex.
l'm fine like this.

26
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:03,044
l don't know even to imagine
that l'm a rich man.

27
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,878
l can't carry that much of burden.

28
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,236
Father, l want Rs.5000!

29
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,731
Can you give?

30
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:37,248
l was waiting years for this moment!

31
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:41,248
Can we get Beer at this hour?

32
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:44,589
You're drama king, dad.

33
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,603
Yours only...mother's!

34
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,112
lnitially l was also just like you.

35
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:12,947
No, you're now just like me then.

36
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,122
First time l saw your mother.

37
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,955
From that moment l felt
l couldn't live without her.

38
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:30,802
From that day Prakash's chase begun!

39
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,809
Now...like this...with you!

40
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:41,813
Someday you'd also get this feeling!
- What feeling?

41
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:45,650
lf she's not there l would die,
that feeling!

42
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:51,152
l'll die if you're not there,
where are you?

43
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,332
Hey Ganesh! lt's not a goal,
it went out!

44
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:06,337
Mithuna sister! Gove me the ball!
- Give the ball, sister.

45
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:13,849
Can't you give us the ball?
- l can't hear you!

46
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,220
Don't you want the ball?

47
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,300
Exam starts in an hour.
Do you remember everything?

48
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,573
Don't you've any fear?
- Why should l fear, father? l read everything!

49
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,746
Your mother offered prayers for you...

50
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:54,279
l'm getting late to the exam,
let's go, father.- Rogue!

51
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,447
My past is cursing me...

52
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:05,027
For the delay in
introducing to her...

53
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:08,793
Hereafter you're my life...

54
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:14,469
Though it's a curse,
l feel like a boon this moment...

55
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:39,160
Don't know why l feel l got
wings today only...

56
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:42,664
Strangely l'm touching the sky...

57
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:46,326
After seeing eyes that devoured me...

58
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:51,669
My heart laughed for the first time...
What a change is this!

59
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:57,179
Flood of mirage drowned me!
lts not a dream, is it?

60
00:08:57,349 --> 00:09:01,513
This unbearable pleasant pain
is because of you...

61
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:40,556
O time, you've been travelling
for eons without stopping...

62
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:47,563
You stop when she's with me...
Don't chase me, O distance...

63
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:51,395
Without you l'm not there...
l'm nowhere...

64
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,061
Though won over the world...

65
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,406
May l lose for the
happiness of your love?

66
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:08,747
Rain fell like little drops...
Drenching my life...

67
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:16,588
For this pain,
word love falls short...

68
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,919
l want to talk to Prakash!

69
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,502
His son is dead.

70
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:27,267
Yes, Gautham.

71
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,104
Definitely.

72
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:37,945
Father!

73
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:43,949
You told me, someday l'll meet her!

74
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,784
l realised on seeing her!

75
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,789
What did you realise?

76
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,292
That l would die without her!

77
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,138
She's just like mom!

78
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:08,639
To tell you the truth,
she's better than mom.

79
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:11,475
Father!

80
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,643
What's her name?

81
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:20,313
l don't know.

82
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:24,989
For the present Angel!

83
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,825
You know, father!
Tomorrow l'm going to Hyderabad.

84
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,991
l'm going to introduce
my love to her.

85
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,846
Tell me something new!

86
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:50,181
New? Tell you love only me!
-l'll not tell.

87
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:53,017
Will you at least tell
that l'd die without you?

88
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,351
l'll not die!

89
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:58,360
Pulse is weakening!
Heart is stopping!

90
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,690
Tell me quickly!

91
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:04,028
No problem! Everything will
be new in a moment.

92
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:07,865
ln a moment?
l didn't get you.

93
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,373
Can anyone live after pulse
goes down and heart stops?

94
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:13,533
You're mad!

95
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:16,271
She-devil! Will you kill me?

96
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:20,215
Okay! Will you at least
fulfill my last wish?

97
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:24,719
l'll try! Tell me.

98
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,880
l feel this moment...

99
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:30,892
...right now...here...you...
- Me?

100
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:33,895
l feel like kissing you
right now this moment.

101
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,225
l'll wait for you.

102
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,406
Mithuna! Open your eyes!

103
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:48,068
My dear, open the eyes!

104
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:59,246
You'll like me after
my wounds are healed.

105
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,602
Are you God?

106
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,282
l told you'd like me
if my wounds heal.

107
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:29,442
You didn't hear me.

108
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,947
l don't know what you do,
l don't mind the cost,

109
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,285
the girl must live, that's all!

110
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,473
Mithuna! Your angel's name!

111
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:28,840
Where will you marry?
ln sky or on earth?

112
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:30,674
ln a registrar's office!

113
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:37,010
Go away!

114
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:04,204
l'll die hundred times for you!

115
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,377
Do you know this?

116
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:13,714
You've sleeping
for the past four months.

117
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:15,548
Aren't you bored?

118
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,739
Where is Surya?

119
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:51,258
Don't tell me he's dead!

120
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:06,107
Few months later...

121
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:34,302
Surya, you left me in dark!

122
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,345
Sister! lt seems film stars are in
the guest list of your marriage.

123
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,515
Will Chiranjeevi also come?

124
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,183
Hey! lt seems Chiranjeevi
too is coming!

125
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,035
Will you please come here?

126
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:45,539
Coming!

127
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,049
lf you don't like the marriage,
run away!

128
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,387
Will you kill yourself?

129
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:14,064
l'm unable to forget Surya.

130
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,398
Don't forget!
Who told you to forget?

131
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,570
Hello Surya! My name is Gautham.

132
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,410
l wish to marry Mithuna.

133
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,074
You must make her agree.

134
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:37,918
People are waiting for us.
- l need little time, Gautham.

135
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:51,935
Shall we elope?

136
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,108
Shall we elope?

137
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:08,452
Father! Groom eloping with his bride!

138
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:20,635
For this pain,
word love falls short...

139
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,966
Ananthagiri
(14 kms away from Tamil Nadu)

140
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,802
You go in my car sir,
l'll take care of this.

141
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:51,165
You entered my heart
like breathe...

142
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,667
Don't turn into despair...

143
00:19:53,838 --> 00:20:01,176
ls it justified for you to change me
so much that l can't recognise myself?

144
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:08,345
How could you be so cool?

145
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,511
Don't get restricted to past only,
come into the reality...

146
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,022
l was passing time in dreams,
truth shows you're the reality...

147
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:18,525
What a change!
l've fallen in love with you...

148
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:22,689
What am l to do?
You please tell me...

149
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,576
What's this?

150
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,240
l think my father's arrangements.

151
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:29,756
Shankaram! Throw it far away!

152
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,262
Did your marriage go off well?

153
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,773
No uncle, bride didn't like me.

154
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,778
She loves someone else.

155
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,778
What did he say?
l didn't get it.

156
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:51,615
l too didn't get him.
Who is she then?

157
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,113
Who are you then?

158
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,195
l love this like my life...
no, love her more than my life.

159
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,791
That's why l eloped with her.

160
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,962
Thief girl!
Both made fun of us!

161
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:14,861
Watching for a moment,
you've become a memory of four letters.

162
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,368
Will you become reality
by tying the knot?

163
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,538
Will you remain as a memory?

164
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,735
Such a big bungalow!
Not a photo of God to pray!

165
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,740
Can there be homes without God?

166
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,238
Strange!

167
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:57,804
What is this?
- You!

168
00:24:58,142 --> 00:24:59,632
One minute!

169
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:04,804
Were you after me since then?

170
00:25:04,982 --> 00:25:06,973
Did you come running
this far to ask this?

171
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:11,143
You never told me about this!

172
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:23,663
Did you keep this photo to hurt me?

173
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,825
Will you please speak in Telugu?

174
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:34,340
Do you know him?

175
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,668
l don't know.

176
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:35,569
What's the meaning of it?

177
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:39,402
l love you!
- l know that!

178
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,571
Why are you telling me now?

179
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:46,079
You said l didn't tell you till now.
l'll tell that to you every day.- Why?

180
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,413
For the reply from you
that you too love me.

181
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:16,774
No use in sitting like
a bull at entrance.

182
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:20,940
lts four days since she went out!
Not bothered about her at all.

183
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,117
No use of growing old!

184
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:37,529
Will you make Gongura chutney?
Days since l had it.

185
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:39,530
Wants chutney!

186
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:47,137
lt's four days since she went,
you don't bother about her.

187
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,973
She doesn't have the sense
to call her on phone.

188
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:53,810
l'm shouting here!
Can you hear me?

189
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,648
She didn't go after marriage,
she went away refusing marriage.

190
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:01,484
Do you hear me?

191
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,178
Pick up the phone, mom!

192
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,023
l want to talk to you, mom!

193
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,201
Do you want money?

194
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:52,368
Save it for my death anniversary!

195
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,551
Share my pension money!

196
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,241
l'm saved!

197
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:37,410
All of them joined together
to take my life.

198
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:57,768
Aunt Kalavathi!
Decorated me like a festival bull!

199
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,122
What's the time?
- l don't know.

200
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,694
Were you sitting here all the night?

201
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,993
lsn't this night?

202
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,004
lsn't this little over?

203
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,642
lt is but can't avoid!

204
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,812
Normally it is difficult
to impress girls,

205
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,647
moreover you!

206
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:44,476
l know what you would say!
l've seen it in many films.

207
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:48,318
You'll say l'm not a girl
but an angel wandering on earth.

208
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,323
That is true!

209
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:54,157
But what l intended
to say isn't that!- What?

210
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,660
What else then?
Tell me.

211
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,831
Answer me and go.

212
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:23,352
Hey girl!

213
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:26,059
You only!

214
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:30,363
The town is talking about you!

215
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:34,436
Come and sit here.
Come...come...

216
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:36,528
Sit here.

217
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,869
ls it you who married out Gautham?

218
00:31:41,211 --> 00:31:45,705
Come here, the girl who married
our Gautham is here!

219
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:49,045
You don't mistake us, dear.
Gautham's mother is our friend.

220
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:50,709
They lived here for 3 years.

221
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,377
Why are you harping about
that old tale?

222
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:54,456
Where did you first meet Gautham?

223
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:02,387
ln hospital!

224
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,401
Did you like him at first sight?

225
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,733
No, liked him very much.
- What happened then?

226
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,745
Then, l came to know he
loves another girl.

227
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:28,417
Where is Surya?

228
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:31,916
l don't see him here.

229
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:35,254
What did you do then?

230
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:46,098
l laughed!
- Laughed? Laughed then?

231
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:47,937
You don't stop her.

232
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,602
Can't you listen without disturbing her?
- You carry on dear.

233
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:53,845
Surya will not die!

234
00:32:56,453 --> 00:33:00,617
But when l came to know the
girl he loves left him,

235
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,281
l almost died!

236
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:05,622
Die? You should've laughed now, right?

237
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,629
Poor Gautham! What happened then?

238
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:14,464
When l opened my eyes,
l could see only myself.

239
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:18,304
When l close my eyes...

240
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:22,308
Don't feel sad, dear.
He'll forget!

241
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,312
Would he trouble you for
a girl who died long back?

242
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:28,144
Must forget!
He must forget, that's all.

243
00:33:34,658 --> 00:33:36,319
l'm also trying!

244
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:54,500
lf you spread my love like mat,
earth wouldn't be enough!

245
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:58,003
Seas would go dry if put into it.

246
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,340
Don't hide the truth!

247
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,121
Say l'm a bird!

248
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:58,798
Say!

249
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:03,800
What?
- Say l'm a bird!

250
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:06,635
Yes, you're a bird!

251
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:17,477
What's that flies into air...

252
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:20,054
Bird!
- Bird!

253
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:25,659
Agree you're a bird.

254
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:29,825
Yes, l'm a bird.

255
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,828
Come.
- Where are you taking me?

256
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:37,500
Shall we fly to some faraway place?

257
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:44,677
You need some time, right?

258
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,008
Look to your left!

259
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:54,518
That fair skinned girl!
She's bowled over you!

260
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:58,688
She'll fly to any place for you!

261
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:02,695
Moving are not lips!

262
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:07,359
Lips are not moving!

263
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,871
Her eyes are expressing it.

264
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:21,380
Aren't my eyes expressing anything?

265
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:24,217
Tell me what's it?

266
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:35,224
l know it, Gautham.

267
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:39,399
lf l say no, your heart will break.

268
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:49,239
What? Have you handed over your
future husband to another girl?

269
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:51,573
What do you think of yourself?

270
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:54,581
l don't get you!
Do you at least?

271
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,082
Mother! Who is she?

272
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:58,413
The woman who carried husband
in a basket to a prostitute.

273
00:37:58,588 --> 00:37:59,748
Sati Sumathi!

274
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,253
Yes Sati Sumathi! Do you think
you're a chaste woman like her?

275
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:07,260
Or say let him go to hell
l don't care a hoot about him.

276
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,920
Don't you feel it is wrong?

277
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,589
Don't lecture for asking you.

278
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,758
No that, please listen to me.

279
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:15,598
Bye.
- Please one minute!

280
00:38:28,618 --> 00:38:33,282
Shall we fly away?

281
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:16,821
l've lost faith in you.

282
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,491
When will you start love me?

283
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,001
Drop me in my home.

284
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:28,007
l'm leaving.

285
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:32,012
Will you go away leaving me here?

286
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:14,888
l'm having headache!
Open the door!

287
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,392
Don't you pity me!
Open the door.

288
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:23,725
Open the door.

289
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,231
Did anything happen last night?

290
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:27,892
Don't show me your face!

291
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,232
This is unjust, open the door.

292
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:32,237
Did you leave me in cold?
- Oh God!

293
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,399
Last night...momentarily...

294
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:36,568
l feel like killing myself
thinking about it.

295
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:38,574
lt has become a habit
for you to die.

296
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:42,748
l'm starting to recollect.

297
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,912
Did l kiss you last night?

298
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:56,258
At least l tried, right?

299
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:10,777
l'll not touch till you ask me.

300
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:14,443
Open the door, please.

301
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:47,976
What are you doing?

302
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,316
l didn't touch you, right?

303
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:30,356
Listen to me!
Why are you so angry?

304
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:36,526
People are watching us.
l didn't touch you, right?

305
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:40,525
Hey Miss! Please stop!

306
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:42,694
Before so many people!
What would they think about me?

307
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:47,206
Did you see it?
- No, l shut my eyes.

308
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:51,746
Thank God! You saved me!
l feared you had seen it.

309
00:42:59,722 --> 00:43:02,555
The mirror looked beautiful!
ls it my mistake?

310
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:06,893
Listen!
l was just joking!

311
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,391
l'm not getting laugh!

312
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:14,233
Don't refuse to marry me
for a bad joke.

313
00:43:14,404 --> 00:43:15,894
l'll die right here now!

314
00:43:20,243 --> 00:43:23,235
This is not ajoke!
l'm serious!

315
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,259
Come quickly mother,

316
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:50,099
must be back in home before
your son-in-law finishes bath.

317
00:43:50,273 --> 00:43:53,765
No need to rush,
l've locked the door.

318
00:43:57,113 --> 00:43:58,444
Mother! How are you?

319
00:43:58,614 --> 00:44:02,277
She picked it, mother!
We're fine.

320
00:44:02,452 --> 00:44:03,942
Won't you ask how l'm?

321
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,451
What's wrong with you?
You would be fine.

322
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:07,782
l've been trying to call you
for 3 days.

323
00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:09,117
Your father isn't going
out of home.

324
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,455
Father called me yesterday.
- Did he?

325
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,960
Did you hear? Your son-in-law
talked to her yesterday.

326
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:16,462
He didn't even tell me.
- ls it?

327
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:17,621
Did you remember me?

328
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,631
ls it forgettable that you've done?

329
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:22,794
Don't torture him,
he loves you so much.

330
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:26,468
Think over this.

331
00:44:26,642 --> 00:44:28,974
You met with the accident
and he lost his life.

332
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:30,476
He's a gentleman.

333
00:44:30,646 --> 00:44:34,138
l'm telling you, can't find a
better man than him anywhere?

334
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:35,477
Do you hear me?

335
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:41,988
Mother called to scold me.
- Why?

336
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:45,149
Not to trouble you.

337
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:52,995
Am l really troubling you?

338
00:44:53,836 --> 00:44:55,326
Dinner is excellent!

339
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:09,845
Day after tomorrow my dad is coming.

340
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:11,680
Please don't ask him to eat!

341
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:13,344
Poor man will runaway!

342
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:18,020
Promising to show around,
making me climb mountains!

343
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:37,042
Can we also play?

344
00:46:21,424 --> 00:46:26,088
What man? Are you so great?

345
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:36,436
What man? What will you do?
- Why involve a girl?

346
00:46:45,448 --> 00:46:49,282
Move...move...

347
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:27,987
Sorrow...testing time...

348
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:32,655
A thought that's asphyxiating...

349
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:37,162
Hatred...my life...

350
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:41,667
ls it crime to get closer?

351
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:46,171
Aren't there flowers without thorns?

352
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:50,836
Aren't there eyes without tears?

353
00:47:51,013 --> 00:47:55,177
lsn't there a sea without waves?

354
00:47:55,351 --> 00:48:00,186
lsn't there a life without dreams?

355
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:09,196
O heart, forget or else die...

356
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:20,208
Past burn away with
the hope of future...

357
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:43,892
l'm seriously making a try.

358
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,232
To forget.

359
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:52,735
But don't know why it
came out suddenly!

360
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,240
called aloud Surya!

361
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:06,119
lt seems if hit on head
one forgets the past.

362
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:09,418
Like it happens in films!

363
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:10,923
Why not try like...

364
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:31,110
l'm dying a death everyday
to live with her.

365
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:36,142
Surya is dead but
still lives in her.

366
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,780
My love for her is vast
as universe, father.

367
00:49:39,455 --> 00:49:42,618
l don't know how to hide it
in such a small heart.

368
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:46,117
She loves a dead man so much.

369
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:50,963
l'm living before her
but l'm not seen, father.

370
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:54,959
Unable to act, l feel l may die.

371
00:49:56,305 --> 00:50:00,298
Did a great thing!
Don't do like his for money!

372
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:01,807
Who wouldn't do it for money?

373
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:04,969
Look, how l'm!
Very beautiful!

374
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:07,980
You look the birthday girl not her.

375
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,142
You look like Goddess Lakshmi!

376
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,981
l'm not like Lakshmi but Shakthi.

377
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:14,816
Why do they use turmeric,
sandalwood, vermillion?

378
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,480
To hell with these customs.

379
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:19,492
Don't say like that.
That's the greatness of my religion.

380
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:22,153
We've mixed health tips into customs.

381
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:25,494
Turmeric is antibiotic
and beauty enhancer.

382
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:27,898
Many times better than your powder.

383
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,899
Their situation too
is just like us.

384
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:39,002
A small game, eh?

385
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:42,677
You're Gautham and
l'm Mithuna for some time.

386
00:50:45,187 --> 00:50:46,347
Give me the cigarette.

387
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:48,011
Give it!

388
00:50:57,366 --> 00:51:00,199
l'm not Mithuna but Gautham.

389
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:06,030
l don't care how much you love me.

390
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:09,534
l'm unable to forget Surya.

391
00:51:11,881 --> 00:51:13,712
lf l say no, l know you'll die.

392
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:16,878
l want little time.

393
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:21,553
What if l can't forget all my life?

394
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:24,056
What can l do?
What's there in my hand?

395
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:25,557
Tell me like you, Gautham.

396
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:37,262
l'll tell if you promise
not to laugh.

397
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:59,091
l'll wait till death!
This is true!

398
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:00,592
For whom?

399
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:30,956
Word of heart's hope is love...

400
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,030
Question of silence is love...

401
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:43,969
Companion of death too is love...

402
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:55,710
The magic that happens
to us is love...

403
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:19,834
Golden flowers!

404
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:28,848
Love is the fire that burns
the sorrows of heart...

405
00:53:29,018 --> 00:53:34,854
Love douses those raging fires...

406
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:40,860
Love is ajourney without
a beginning or end...

407
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:46,866
Love sneaks in like dawn
into dark homes...

408
00:53:47,036 --> 00:53:58,208
Love is vast as universe,
can we hide it in heart?

409
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,744
ln a country that worships stones,
it's not wrong to love a stone.

410
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:43,585
Gautham! Haven't paid for the tea!

411
00:54:55,938 --> 00:55:01,604
Love can't be cremated
because it has no end...

412
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:07,613
Love will not ask life,
because it has no mother...

413
00:55:07,783 --> 00:55:13,619
Won't you find sea
if you try in tears?

414
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:19,625
Love, don't chase thirst
like water...

415
00:55:19,795 --> 00:55:25,631
Light that gives shadow
is my companion...

416
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:31,137
What would become of me
if it turns dark?

417
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,360
l didn't mean to hurt you.

418
00:56:31,366 --> 00:56:33,197
lf l had hurt you with my words...

419
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,374
ls forgetting so easy?

420
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:57,385
l don't know whether forgetting
is easy or not,

421
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:02,891
but it is very difficult
to love like this.

422
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,179
Where are you?

423
00:59:56,238 --> 00:59:58,399
lt has become a habit
to die for everything!

424
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:02,737
You want to die everyday
for a man who died.

425
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:05,903
Can't you try to live
a moment for me?

426
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:11,912
lf you don't want to marry me,
forget it!

427
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:13,418
At least live!

428
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:21,426
This moment...right now here...

429
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:26,257
...l feel like marrying!

430
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:27,925
What's that again?

431
01:00:29,104 --> 01:00:32,096
l'll divorce if you insist me
to eat chicken.- What?

432
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:34,765
l'll divorce if you insist me
to eat chicken.

433
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,300
Come again!

434
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:09,808
This moment...right now here...

435
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,304
...l feel like marrying!

436
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,559
Where's this garage?

437
01:02:26,721 --> 01:02:27,551
Did you paint it?

438
01:02:27,722 --> 01:02:31,886
No, the mad man who
paints made this!

439
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:40,064
l asked him to paint an angel,
he painted this picture.

440
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:44,069
He'll not listen to anyone,
he's a mad man!

441
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:47,067
ls Surya his name?
Do you know where can l find him?

442
01:02:47,242 --> 01:02:48,903
ln the abandoned factory.

443
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:31,783
You can find him drawing
pictures in that corner.

444
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:33,284
He's there.

445
01:04:28,843 --> 01:04:30,504
l don't know who you are!

446
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:36,514
To make you bleed, l'll hit thrice!

447
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:11,713
ls it your blood or mine?
lt's my blood!

448
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:20,722
This universe is small
if you spread my love.

449
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,386
Seas will go dry if you put in water!

450
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:27,899
Don't hide love in heart like
Lord Shiva hides poison in throat.

451
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:04,265
ls this your blood or mine?
Tell me!

452
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:50,807
What's the girl's problem?

453
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:54,482
Still for that dead Surya.

454
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,823
Surya is alive!

455
01:07:03,164 --> 01:07:04,188
Did you see him?

456
01:07:06,668 --> 01:07:08,192
Did you tell Mithuna?

457
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:11,832
Couldn't muster courage!

458
01:07:12,006 --> 01:07:15,840
Mithuna loved Surya
in past not now.

459
01:07:23,351 --> 01:07:27,913
You didn't make any mistake, right?
You can't!

460
01:07:29,023 --> 01:07:32,356
Why Surya did go away
from Mithuna?

461
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:39,030
He has built a temple, father!

462
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:14,395
Exam starts in an hour!
Don't you've any fear?

463
01:08:14,569 --> 01:08:16,901
Why should l fear, father?
l'm fully prepared!

464
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:58,435
What happened?
- l'm scared, father.

465
01:09:30,812 --> 01:09:34,043
Got him!
- Where did he go away?

466
01:09:46,327 --> 01:09:50,320
He's there, catch him boys!
- Stay there only!

467
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:54,328
May be he'll take us
to Charminar again.

468
01:10:10,351 --> 01:10:11,511
Boys! He's here!

469
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:19,853
Come...catch him!

470
01:10:24,032 --> 01:10:25,522
How long will you keep running?

471
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:30,201
He has slowed down!
- Got him...got him...

472
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:36,037
Come on boys!
Over?

473
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:45,049
Why are you shouting man?

474
01:10:47,221 --> 01:10:49,712
Where will you run away?
Stop...stop...

475
01:10:50,224 --> 01:10:51,555
l'll kill you.

476
01:10:51,726 --> 01:10:54,388
Hey you!

477
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:01,724
Are you really scared?

478
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:06,729
Shall we go back home, father?

479
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:11,404
Okay! What can we do?

480
01:11:13,414 --> 01:11:16,406
lf you still fear,
chant Gayathri hymn 3 times.

481
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:18,081
Do you remember it?

482
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:20,151
Tell me.

483
01:11:56,624 --> 01:12:01,459
Some magical charm has engulfed me...

484
01:12:01,629 --> 01:12:04,962
Handcuffing my heart...

485
01:12:07,301 --> 01:12:11,965
Why earth is shivering like this?

486
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:15,875
May be heart yearns for her...

487
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:22,476
Has sky changed it form...

488
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:27,212
Has it come down as rain for me...

489
01:12:27,989 --> 01:12:33,154
Has it reached heart like love...

490
01:12:33,327 --> 01:12:38,492
ls my love desiring you?

491
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:41,157
Mirages in clouds...

492
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:43,667
Hot sun is spreading
cool moonlight...

493
01:12:43,838 --> 01:12:49,504
lt's magical...
but still pleasant...

494
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:14,198
Season is changing every moment...

495
01:13:14,368 --> 01:13:16,859
My every nerve is chased by thunder...

496
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:20,940
My running has become
floods newly...

497
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:24,875
All of a sudden l'm flying...

498
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:27,537
Daytime is spreading
a net of thoughts...

499
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:33,051
My heart has lost it's
balance and standing still...

500
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:37,385
Don't melt away like dream
what l saw with my eyes...

501
01:13:37,558 --> 01:13:42,393
Don't fly away
when l come before you...

502
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:44,895
Like a magic...

503
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:50,394
That changed me totally...
Like a magic...

504
01:13:51,572 --> 01:13:53,233
That made me like you...

505
01:13:53,407 --> 01:14:04,750
O moonbeam...

506
01:14:23,437 --> 01:14:26,770
Father! Stop Father!

507
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:30,440
What dear?

508
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:33,273
Exams are over, l'm worried.

509
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:35,108
Would l at least pass
this time, Father?

510
01:14:35,283 --> 01:14:37,274
You're testing God.

511
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:42,646
They're Gods, right?

512
01:14:43,457 --> 01:14:45,789
He'll pass any number of exams.

513
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,121
l'm getting late to church,
l've to go.

514
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:55,363
My name is Surya.

515
01:14:55,803 --> 01:15:00,797
lf you've any problems,
tell Father.

516
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:01,964
Not to me.

517
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,471
He went to the church just now.

518
01:15:36,844 --> 01:15:39,176
lt may not be nice to say
l love you to Father.

519
01:15:41,349 --> 01:15:43,010
Have you seen earth softening?

520
01:15:43,517 --> 01:15:46,680
Raining at call?
World stopping for claps?

521
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:48,845
l've seen it all.
Yesterday!

522
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:55,526
Don't think l'm not handsome
because of these wounds.

523
01:15:55,696 --> 01:15:57,027
l'll be good after wounds heal.

524
01:16:00,034 --> 01:16:02,366
l told them not to punch my face!

525
01:16:02,536 --> 01:16:03,730
But those idiots didn't listen.

526
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,530
Don't decide in hurry.
You'd like me if my wounds heal.

527
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:34,898
What?
- Has it started?

528
01:16:36,737 --> 01:16:38,398
Today Arjuna comes to the
groom choosing contest.

529
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:39,561
Keep it inside!

530
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:46,744
l forgot to tell you,
a boy came for you, some Surya.

531
01:16:55,923 --> 01:16:58,255
Did he come here too?
- Yes.

532
01:16:58,426 --> 01:16:59,757
Did you sent him to me?

533
01:16:59,927 --> 01:17:02,589
Yes, he said about some work,
so l sent him to you.

534
01:17:06,434 --> 01:17:09,426
Why are you so angry?
What's the matter anyway?

535
01:17:09,603 --> 01:17:11,161
lt seems he loves me!

536
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,271
What's that strange disease?

537
01:17:17,111 --> 01:17:18,442
Do you know him?

538
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:22,445
You knew him before me.

539
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:25,949
Fish is in the air,
arrow is in hand.

540
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,281
He may hit the target!
- Why don't you try it?

541
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:34,788
No respect for elders too!
Blabbers as she wishes!

542
01:17:34,962 --> 01:17:36,452
Are you telling me the truth?

543
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:47,304
l swear on Arjuna!

544
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:06,319
Didn't l tell you
l'll be handsome?

545
01:18:06,494 --> 01:18:07,324
You didn't listen to me.

546
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,319
Do you like me?

547
01:18:16,337 --> 01:18:17,497
Will you kiss me?

548
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:23,506
Will you kiss me before
so many people?

549
01:18:26,347 --> 01:18:29,009
Okay for me,
is it okay for you?

550
01:18:31,519 --> 01:18:32,508
Scared?

551
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:35,177
Chant Gayathri hymn!

552
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:38,021
l'll kill you!

553
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:41,517
Did you kiss me really?

554
01:18:58,546 --> 01:19:00,707
lf someone dies in some
far away place!

555
01:19:01,549 --> 01:19:03,540
Do we've to wash and
clean the entire house?

556
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:05,382
l don't get you.

557
01:19:05,553 --> 01:19:07,885
As if there's meaning to
everything you do.

558
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:09,886
Girls must be within limits.

559
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:13,049
Even banyan trees age!
What's the use?

560
01:19:13,227 --> 01:19:17,061
First decide if l'm banyan tree
or a girl and then carry on. Got it?

561
01:19:18,065 --> 01:19:20,226
Ashamed to go out!

562
01:19:22,403 --> 01:19:24,735
What has happened now?
ls it about that bearded man?

563
01:19:24,905 --> 01:19:26,395
ls he the only one
or you'd many more?

564
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:28,235
See, how shamelessly
she's asking me!

565
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:31,742
l'm seeing...
like king like citizen!

566
01:19:33,914 --> 01:19:36,906
You don't need to see anything,
mind your work. Old woman!

567
01:19:37,918 --> 01:19:39,249
What did my mother do?

568
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:41,411
Didn't you tell me that he loves you?

569
01:19:41,589 --> 01:19:44,581
Didn't he 'Oops' you
before so many people?

570
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:46,248
He didn't 'Oops' me!

571
01:19:46,427 --> 01:19:49,919
True! lf you want
l swear on grandma.

572
01:19:50,097 --> 01:19:52,088
Will you kill me?

573
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:53,426
lf you trust, you'd live, right?

574
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:56,434
The parrot that learnt to talk
says no when asked to say Rama.

575
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:02,268
Who told you that
he gave 'Oops' to me?

576
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:05,606
You're angry not because of he
gave you 'Oops' but who told us!

577
01:20:05,779 --> 01:20:07,269
Did you hear it, mother?
- l am.

578
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:09,279
You keep on telling and
she'll keep on hearing.

579
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,941
Meanwhile l'll go and kill him.

580
01:20:14,288 --> 01:20:15,778
Did you hear her?

581
01:20:15,956 --> 01:20:18,117
lf cow eats grass,
would calf give milk?

582
01:20:30,804 --> 01:20:32,635
Don't you know to drive?

583
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,146
Will you arrest
if you know to drive?

584
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:49,645
l would've if l didn't
knew to drive.

585
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:53,483
l've great respect for
drinking and driving.

586
01:20:54,995 --> 01:20:58,726
l can't mix them both.
- You can quit, right?

587
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:02,829
You mean drinking?
- Yourjob, Dikshitulu!

588
01:21:06,507 --> 01:21:09,340
You can sit at home and
drink happily, right?- Home?

589
01:21:10,344 --> 01:21:12,005
No need to think about
that hell now.

590
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:15,012
lf l go home drunk at night,
my daughter stops talking to me.

591
01:21:15,182 --> 01:21:18,345
For coming home drunk at night,
wife stops talking next morning.

592
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:23,513
What's this? Can't you speak
to both all your life?

593
01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:25,022
l pity you sir.

594
01:21:25,192 --> 01:21:27,183
That's why l don't drink in day time.

595
01:21:27,695 --> 01:21:32,029
l may have to talk to myself,
people may think l'm mad.

596
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,211
Did your husband come riding
on horse again?

597
01:21:57,224 --> 01:21:58,213
Won't you talk to me?

598
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,734
Father! Come out quickly!
Coffee is getting cold.

599
01:22:10,904 --> 01:22:12,064
Coming...coming.

600
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,400
Tell your mother to
keep it on table.

601
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:20,907
Listen to me and divorce him.

602
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:24,573
How long will you tolerate it?
Shall l talk to father?

603
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:29,416
l didn't come riding on horse!

604
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:34,083
You can talk to me, can't you?

605
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,592
Sister!

606
01:22:41,935 --> 01:22:44,426
Do you want water?
- No.- Come upstairs.

607
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:47,768
l'll not come, your grandma
will ask me recite tables.

608
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:51,274
What's the matter?
- l know who that was.

609
01:22:52,112 --> 01:22:53,101
Who is that 'He'?

610
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,775
lt's Naveen who told your mother
that he kissed you.

611
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,796
Don't tell him my name, sister?
- Okay, come.

612
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,133
He's dead today!
l'll not spare him alive.

613
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:24,470
How many times l've forged his
mother's sign on progress card,

614
01:23:24,645 --> 01:23:26,476
did l tell anyone?
- No!

615
01:23:30,651 --> 01:23:34,815
You stay here! l'll get Naveen.

616
01:23:34,988 --> 01:23:36,819
Get him fast.
- Okay.

617
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,150
l'll kill him.

618
01:23:39,326 --> 01:23:42,989
There are ghosts here,
don't get scared.

619
01:24:57,905 --> 01:25:02,274
l'll kill you!
Stop children!

620
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:09,909
How dare you cheat me!

621
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,745
Sister, catch us! lt's Holi!

622
01:25:15,088 --> 01:25:16,419
l'll kill you, stop there...

623
01:25:57,464 --> 01:25:59,625
l lost my respect in home
because of you.

624
01:26:00,133 --> 01:26:03,296
Mother made me promise on
all photos of Gods in home.

625
01:26:05,305 --> 01:26:08,468
Leave me alone!
- Tell me why?

626
01:26:08,642 --> 01:26:11,634
Why should l tell you?
Why should l tell you?

627
01:26:16,316 --> 01:26:17,977
You must tell me.

628
01:26:18,151 --> 01:26:19,982
Because my shouts too
didn't bring rain.

629
01:26:20,153 --> 01:26:23,486
My hands are tired clapping!
Nobody stopped!

630
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:27,319
Hey Naveen, stop!
- l'll not stop, get lost!

631
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:29,155
l'll beat if you don't stop.

632
01:26:29,329 --> 01:26:31,320
Did you see? He didn't stop
even on shouting.

633
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:33,659
That's why if not l'll curse you.

634
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:39,833
Leave me, l've to go,
if not sister will beat me. Leave me.

635
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:48,345
l'm dying unable to hear
my grandma's lousy proverbs.

636
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:53,516
l beg you, my Lord!
Please don't torture me.

637
01:27:01,194 --> 01:27:02,525
You agree, right?

638
01:27:09,202 --> 01:27:10,533
Agreed!

639
01:27:24,551 --> 01:27:28,715
l'm after you...
l'll follow till end...

640
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:32,381
l say my life is your, O love...

641
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,724
You enchanting smile...
l've fallen long back...

642
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:41,129
The mistake is all yours, O love...

643
01:27:42,235 --> 01:27:46,569
Ain't l a match for you?

644
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:50,232
Don't chide me,
am l not fit for you?

645
01:27:51,411 --> 01:27:55,404
Though you look at me angrily...

646
01:27:55,582 --> 01:27:59,143
May l come as smile on you...

647
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:23,103
O girl boarding a bus...
Make my heart your abode, dear...

648
01:28:23,276 --> 01:28:27,610
Why are you firing me
like a missed missile?

649
01:28:27,781 --> 01:28:32,115
Whichever side you go,
l'm there everywhere...

650
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:35,777
l'm sun that never rests,
are you competing with me?

651
01:28:35,956 --> 01:28:44,625
lf you run away in day time,
it means you're in my lap...

652
01:28:44,798 --> 01:28:49,132
lf you slip away into the
highways of night...

653
01:28:49,302 --> 01:28:53,636
Won't l come as moon
in civil dress?

654
01:28:53,807 --> 01:28:57,971
May l come as moving sleep...

655
01:28:58,145 --> 01:29:01,979
May l become pleasant pain...

656
01:29:02,816 --> 01:29:06,479
lf you fight, may l be your victory...

657
01:29:07,154 --> 01:29:10,817
lf you throw me out angrily...

658
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:15,317
May l become generation
that chases me...

659
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:19,997
May l become passion
touching you...

660
01:29:22,002 --> 01:29:24,664
You promised not to come
after me, right?

661
01:29:24,838 --> 01:29:25,827
Why again?

662
01:29:27,674 --> 01:29:29,005
l think you don't know a thing.

663
01:29:29,176 --> 01:29:31,167
My father is a police man.
He'll not take bribes too.

664
01:29:31,344 --> 01:29:32,834
Really a police man?

665
01:29:38,518 --> 01:29:43,012
lf you torture me like this,
l'll join them.

666
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:55,566
Do you know who he is?

667
01:29:56,703 --> 01:29:58,193
Our son Rahul!

668
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:00,028
ln 1995!

669
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:03,540
Have you forgotten it?

670
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:14,714
Even if you hide in stars,
l'm there next to you...

671
01:30:14,888 --> 01:30:18,380
Whichever way the flowing river
may flow, am l not there?

672
01:30:19,726 --> 01:30:21,387
lf you say yes, l'll become real,

673
01:30:21,561 --> 01:30:23,722
if not l'll become a dream...

674
01:30:23,897 --> 01:30:27,230
l'll appear even if you say no...

675
01:30:27,567 --> 01:30:28,727
What if l kill you?

676
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:30,225
He'll die.

677
01:30:38,078 --> 01:30:41,741
l'll be in heaven...

678
01:30:42,749 --> 01:30:46,241
l'll wait for you...

679
01:30:47,087 --> 01:30:50,750
There begins the next birth...

680
01:30:51,424 --> 01:30:55,087
But your fate will not change...

681
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:13,442
lf he dies, he'll go to hell.

682
01:31:13,613 --> 01:31:15,103
Who will die? Who would go to hell?

683
01:31:15,282 --> 01:31:16,271
That man, sir.

684
01:31:25,625 --> 01:31:28,617
He's taking my life.
- Did you inform your father?

685
01:31:32,132 --> 01:31:36,466
Clap needs two hands,
what did you do, tell me? He said.

686
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:40,962
l feel like dying, uncle.
- Stop crying first.

687
01:31:41,308 --> 01:31:42,798
Have some water.

688
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:45,801
Sir, my wife is beating me.

689
01:31:45,979 --> 01:31:49,142
What shall we do now?
- Arrest her. l beg you sir.

690
01:31:49,316 --> 01:31:51,807
Keep in jail for at least a year.

691
01:31:51,985 --> 01:31:54,317
Not enough! Send her to life term.

692
01:31:54,487 --> 01:31:57,149
She pushed me into well recently.
- You wait man.

693
01:31:57,991 --> 01:31:59,822
What does he do?
- l don't know.

694
01:31:59,993 --> 01:32:01,153
She does everything
knowing very well.

695
01:32:01,328 --> 01:32:04,820
lf l say anything, she threatens
to act like mad in court,

696
01:32:04,998 --> 01:32:07,660
l wanted to die, sir.
- Go die man!

697
01:32:08,335 --> 01:32:09,825
Would anyone come to station
for husband beating?

698
01:32:10,003 --> 01:32:11,163
Aren't you a man?

699
01:32:12,005 --> 01:32:14,166
Can men do anything then?

700
01:32:14,341 --> 01:32:17,333
Not you! Girls are great! Enough?

701
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,341
You mean if they kill, should we die?

702
01:32:19,512 --> 01:32:23,346
Yes, die if killed.
lf not l'll kill you.

703
01:32:24,517 --> 01:32:26,678
Uncle, ask him to leave the place.

704
01:32:26,853 --> 01:32:29,686
You go, come later.
- Go man!

705
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,850
You're always a cyclone!

706
01:32:32,025 --> 01:32:33,356
Don't know who would marry you,
he's dead meat!

707
01:32:33,526 --> 01:32:36,188
Don't know who he is!
He's your perfect man!

708
01:32:36,363 --> 01:32:37,421
Stop there!

709
01:32:37,864 --> 01:32:40,424
l'll kill you.
- She's taking the gun, catch her!

710
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,691
l'll kill you, stop!

711
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:51,032
l'll lose my job!

712
01:32:55,882 --> 01:32:58,214
What's this?
What are you doing here?

713
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:03,052
He's Surya. Good boy.

714
01:33:03,223 --> 01:33:04,884
He has great respect for girls.

715
01:33:08,228 --> 01:33:10,389
You don't mind her,
l think she's little angry.

716
01:33:10,563 --> 01:33:12,554
l know sir.
- Wait, l'll be back in a sec.

717
01:33:16,903 --> 01:33:18,063
l didn't tell your name!

718
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:34,250
You've come with a big...
- ...big plan only!

719
01:33:37,424 --> 01:33:40,916
You've charmed my father too.
Tell me something new.

720
01:33:41,094 --> 01:33:42,083
l think you don't know one thing.

721
01:33:42,262 --> 01:33:45,425
My brother is a big goon.
He'll kill you.

722
01:33:48,268 --> 01:33:52,102
Father is police and doesn't
take bribes.- Why are you laughing?

723
01:33:52,272 --> 01:33:55,264
Brother is goon, you're mad!
- Stay there only!

724
01:33:55,942 --> 01:33:58,775
You can't get a better man than me.

725
01:33:58,945 --> 01:34:00,936
Didn't l tell you?
He's your perfect man!

726
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:12,622
The world knows it!
Don't you know it?

727
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,451
God! How am l to escape
from that bearded man?

728
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:19,788
l'll write Rama's name
100 crore times.

729
01:34:22,469 --> 01:34:24,300
l'll climb the seven hills running!

730
01:34:24,471 --> 01:34:25,961
God save me, please!

731
01:34:54,334 --> 01:35:03,174
lf you run away in day time,
it means you're in my lap...

732
01:35:03,343 --> 01:35:07,507
lf you slip away into the
highways of night...

733
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:12,515
Won't l come as moon
in civil dress?

734
01:35:14,354 --> 01:35:17,846
May l come as moving sleep...

735
01:35:18,525 --> 01:35:22,188
May l become pleasant pain...

736
01:35:23,196 --> 01:35:26,688
lf you fight,
may l be your victory...

737
01:35:27,534 --> 01:35:28,865
lf you throw...

738
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:47,216
Arrange my marriage at
the earliest, father.

739
01:35:52,058 --> 01:35:54,219
l can't study anymore.

740
01:35:57,564 --> 01:35:59,225
Don't look at me like that, father.

741
01:36:00,567 --> 01:36:01,556
l swear!

742
01:36:08,074 --> 01:36:10,235
Moreover l'm unable to sleep alone.

743
01:36:14,747 --> 01:36:17,580
Were you waiting for this
since morning? Aren't you ashamed?

744
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,742
Why should l feel shame?
Didn't you marry?

745
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,081
Today's children are an enigma.

746
01:36:23,256 --> 01:36:26,589
You don't try to understand.
l've my own problems.

747
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:52,281
Get down!
- l can't avoid anymore.

748
01:36:52,452 --> 01:36:55,979
Get down l say!

749
01:37:05,131 --> 01:37:08,464
Don't you've any other work?
- This is my job!

750
01:37:11,137 --> 01:37:12,468
Bloody idiot!

751
01:37:19,145 --> 01:37:20,305
What should l tell all of them?

752
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,469
What's again?

753
01:37:21,648 --> 01:37:23,479
l've committed to them.

754
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:26,813
That you've fallen for me.
What should l tell them?

755
01:37:28,488 --> 01:37:29,978
Here!
- Why are you after me?

756
01:37:30,156 --> 01:37:32,147
lf you say yes,
l'll be beside you.

757
01:37:32,325 --> 01:37:35,817
lf you say no, what else can l do
other than chase you? Tell me!

758
01:37:35,995 --> 01:37:39,988
You'll die! Come...come in.
Come in!

759
01:37:43,336 --> 01:37:45,327
Don't you want me to die?

760
01:37:46,339 --> 01:37:47,499
Tell me the truth.

761
01:37:47,674 --> 01:37:50,336
You recently said l'm mad.
What do you want to tell now?

762
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:53,843
One minute.
l've run out of breath!

763
01:37:54,514 --> 01:37:57,415
l've told everyone that
you've fallen for me.

764
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,852
Just because you told everyone,
should l love you?

765
01:38:03,022 --> 01:38:05,855
l don't like you!

766
01:38:11,864 --> 01:38:15,356
Don't know why l hear
3 times whatever you say!

767
01:38:16,035 --> 01:38:19,766
l've committed! No choice!

768
01:38:20,873 --> 01:38:24,365
For this life your madness is mine!

769
01:38:24,544 --> 01:38:26,034
This is not a film title.

770
01:38:26,212 --> 01:38:31,047
Stop...stop...stop!

771
01:38:38,057 --> 01:38:40,048
Bloody, l'll burn you
dousing with petrol.

772
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:41,883
You'll get burnt in this
heavy rain too.

773
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,733
Come fast...come...

774
01:38:51,738 --> 01:38:53,399
l've been waiting for you
for 30 minutes.

775
01:38:53,573 --> 01:38:54,904
My mother too is not in home.

776
01:38:55,074 --> 01:38:56,905
Why?
- First come in.

777
01:38:57,076 --> 01:38:58,737
Has grandma kicked the bucket?

778
01:38:58,911 --> 01:39:03,245
l'm totally confused.
- l don't hear Gita rendering too.

779
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:06,408
Stop talking please.
- What else then?

780
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,579
Come.

781
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:25,431
Just 10 minutes, she'll be ready.

782
01:39:25,605 --> 01:39:28,597
No problem, she's totally
drenched, take her in.

783
01:39:28,775 --> 01:39:30,436
Go dear.
- Come.

784
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:34,272
Why did you get wet in rain?
Couldn't you've taken an auto?

785
01:39:34,447 --> 01:39:37,280
What's all this?
What's happening here?

786
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:39,611
Don't shout, reduce the volume.

787
01:39:41,454 --> 01:39:42,284
Who are these people?

788
01:39:42,455 --> 01:39:44,616
You asked to arrange your
marriage at the earliest, right?

789
01:39:52,298 --> 01:39:54,459
Where is the groom?
Did you see him?

790
01:39:54,634 --> 01:39:55,794
ls he handsome?

791
01:39:57,303 --> 01:39:59,464
What?
- Why are you excited?

792
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:01,470
You'll meet him, go inside.

793
01:40:02,308 --> 01:40:03,468
Go!

794
01:40:03,976 --> 01:40:08,310
Next song in the program is
from 'Happened Story',

795
01:40:08,481 --> 01:40:11,314
'what a fine day',

796
01:40:11,484 --> 01:40:15,648
written by Cinarey!
Music composed and sung by Ghantasala.

797
01:40:15,822 --> 01:40:17,983
Do you know that's his voice!

798
01:40:18,157 --> 01:40:22,491
As his mother l mustn't say this
he's no less to Ghantasala.

799
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:27,993
You took my life, right?
Tell everyone now.

800
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:29,828
lt seems l fell for you!

801
01:40:31,504 --> 01:40:34,837
Groom works in radio station.
He has no bad habits.

802
01:40:35,007 --> 01:40:35,837
Are you hearing me?

803
01:40:36,676 --> 01:40:37,836
Can you hear it?

804
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:54,854
My brother is asking if your
daughter knows to sing.

805
01:41:04,537 --> 01:41:07,700
lf you ask me to sing before
them, l'll not sing!

806
01:41:07,874 --> 01:41:09,364
Why are you saying it 3 times?

807
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:11,533
Don't you want this proposal
to get through?

808
01:41:16,382 --> 01:41:20,375
Did l really say it thrice?

809
01:41:23,723 --> 01:41:25,554
l must get this
radio station to accept.

810
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:31,724
Wishing for you...

811
01:41:31,898 --> 01:41:37,734
Our eyes met...

812
01:41:37,904 --> 01:41:40,236
Like flowing river...

813
01:41:40,406 --> 01:41:42,897
Like first poetry...

814
01:41:43,075 --> 01:41:45,566
Thoughts are rushing...

815
01:41:45,745 --> 01:41:48,236
Lover's heart is blooming...

816
01:41:48,414 --> 01:41:50,405
Raghurama of Sun race...

817
01:42:12,605 --> 01:42:17,440
You're the man who will
play this musical Veena...

818
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:21,444
My thoughts and my love are...

819
01:42:21,614 --> 01:42:23,275
Do you want to talk to me alone?

820
01:42:42,468 --> 01:42:46,632
You're talking too much
for some time now...

821
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,472
Strange l can't hear anything.

822
01:42:50,643 --> 01:42:53,305
l didn't say a word.
Trust me.

823
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:01,813
l forgot to tell you,
l can't play musical instruments.

824
01:43:05,658 --> 01:43:07,319
Golden tooth!

825
01:43:08,995 --> 01:43:10,986
Sister! You like him?

826
01:43:11,163 --> 01:43:13,825
Till now...l like him.

827
01:43:14,834 --> 01:43:17,667
l didn't get you.
Do you love anyone?

828
01:43:17,837 --> 01:43:21,329
Nothing like that!
But a man is after me.

829
01:43:21,507 --> 01:43:22,667
For 3 months!

830
01:43:23,676 --> 01:43:25,837
Do you like him?
- l'll kill you!

831
01:43:27,179 --> 01:43:32,515
Not you! That fellow!
He's taking my life.

832
01:43:32,852 --> 01:43:35,013
Just a while ago he almost
got crushed to death.

833
01:43:35,187 --> 01:43:36,347
l saved him.

834
01:43:37,023 --> 01:43:40,015
Will you do me a favour?
- What's it?

835
01:43:40,192 --> 01:43:41,853
You come and tell him strongly,

836
01:43:42,028 --> 01:43:45,191
tell him you'll break his limbs
if he comes after me.

837
01:43:45,698 --> 01:43:48,861
l think l may not be able
to say it so strongly.

838
01:43:49,035 --> 01:43:50,366
You've to tell him.

839
01:43:51,704 --> 01:43:52,398
Can't avoid!

840
01:43:55,374 --> 01:43:56,204
Why?

841
01:43:57,209 --> 01:44:00,406
l've told him my brother
is a big goon.

842
01:44:00,713 --> 01:44:06,549
Your nest is shattered...
Your heart is broken...

843
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,052
O little pigeon! Who beat you?

844
01:44:10,222 --> 01:44:12,417
Brother! One minute, don't fall...
- Are you mad?

845
01:44:33,913 --> 01:44:36,074
Till now l was like Seetha in Lanka.

846
01:44:36,248 --> 01:44:37,579
Wherever l went his eyes followed me.

847
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:39,581
l felt like killing myself,
you know that?

848
01:44:39,752 --> 01:44:43,153
Are you missing him?
Come, let's go.

849
01:44:47,927 --> 01:44:51,158
Nothing of that sort!
l swear!

850
01:45:15,287 --> 01:45:16,276
Forgive me.

851
01:45:45,151 --> 01:45:48,643
Brother...brother... Brother!

852
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:53,656
l'm...did you threaten him strongly?

853
01:45:53,826 --> 01:45:54,986
Yes, why?

854
01:45:55,161 --> 01:45:57,527
He has stopped coming after me.

855
01:45:58,664 --> 01:46:00,154
l'll tell when we meet again.

856
01:46:00,332 --> 01:46:03,495
No, l'll become cheap.

857
01:46:20,686 --> 01:46:21,675
One minute please.

858
01:47:45,437 --> 01:47:49,100
l've never anything like this.
What are these?

859
01:47:49,942 --> 01:47:54,106
Waiting for an angel to
put life into them like me.

860
01:47:55,948 --> 01:47:58,280
What do you do for living?

861
01:47:58,450 --> 01:47:59,109
For the present loving!

862
01:48:00,786 --> 01:48:06,452
l don't know what made me say like
that to the prospective groom?

863
01:48:08,294 --> 01:48:10,455
l feel like dying
when l think about it.

864
01:48:12,298 --> 01:48:15,290
lt doesn't mean l love you.

865
01:48:17,636 --> 01:48:18,967
Not that l hate you either.

866
01:48:19,638 --> 01:48:22,801
The man who marries me should
love me as much as...

867
01:48:23,142 --> 01:48:23,972
...void!

868
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:26,471
Void is not seen.

869
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:30,642
Though not seen,
you understood the simile, right?

870
01:48:30,816 --> 01:48:31,805
Prove it.

871
01:48:33,652 --> 01:48:34,641
l can't.

872
01:48:41,994 --> 01:48:43,154
l can't, Mithu!

873
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,163
lf you spread my love like mat,
earth wouldn't be enough!

874
01:48:49,168 --> 01:48:51,159
lf its blown into wind,
it'll blow up the universe.

875
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:54,162
Seas would go dry if put into it.

876
01:48:55,007 --> 01:48:58,670
l can hide it here like
Lord Shiva hides poison.

877
01:49:07,186 --> 01:49:09,017
lt seems earth isn't enough
if he spreads his love.

878
01:49:09,188 --> 01:49:11,179
Your grave! Bloody!

879
01:49:11,357 --> 01:49:13,848
lt seems he's Shiva!
Should l believe it?

880
01:49:14,026 --> 01:49:16,859
Can seas ever go dry?
Bloody!

881
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:21,021
My mother told me love won't suit us.

882
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,532
l didn't listen to her.
Lost my honour!

883
01:49:24,536 --> 01:49:26,094
l deserve this humiliation!

884
01:49:37,917 --> 01:49:39,885
Hello! What do you mean
by humiliation?

885
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:54,730
Bloody idiot!

886
01:50:06,745 --> 01:50:08,144
What's your name, dear?

887
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:14,246
Do you like me?
You want to kiss me?

888
01:50:18,590 --> 01:50:20,751
lf a girl is seen, every rogue...

889
01:50:26,598 --> 01:50:28,793
Grandpa! One minute!

890
01:50:32,271 --> 01:50:34,102
Mithuna, that's my name.

891
01:50:34,273 --> 01:50:35,763
Please don't mistake me, grandpa.

892
01:50:36,108 --> 01:50:38,440
l said that in an angry burst.

893
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:41,272
ls it? l thought you said that really!

894
01:50:43,382 --> 01:50:46,442
Do you love anyone?

895
01:50:46,785 --> 01:50:48,116
Please don't ask me that.

896
01:50:48,287 --> 01:50:49,618
Had a fight?

897
01:50:49,788 --> 01:50:53,781
Nothing like that, l told him
to show how much he loves me.

898
01:50:58,797 --> 01:51:00,128
Have you come?

899
01:51:01,133 --> 01:51:03,624
Did he show you?
- He said he can't show.

900
01:51:03,802 --> 01:51:06,635
He said about earth, sky
in Sanskrit language.

901
01:51:06,805 --> 01:51:09,467
l didn't get him.
- He was right!

902
01:51:09,975 --> 01:51:11,966
lf it was something to be seen,

903
01:51:12,144 --> 01:51:15,636
how can a blind man
like me see love?

904
01:51:19,985 --> 01:51:23,148
Shall we go?
- Come. lts late night!

905
01:51:49,348 --> 01:51:51,339
Have you seen earth softening?

906
01:51:51,517 --> 01:51:54,680
Raining at call?
World stopping for claps?

907
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,681
l've seen it all.
Yesterday!

908
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:21,372
Looks like angel has lost her way!

909
01:52:32,057 --> 01:52:33,046
l've understood!

910
01:52:34,726 --> 01:52:38,059
lf it can be shown,
then it is not love.

911
01:52:47,906 --> 01:52:49,066
But one condition!

912
01:52:50,409 --> 01:52:52,900
Don't ask me to come
to films and parks.

913
01:52:54,246 --> 01:52:55,076
One minute!

914
01:53:03,255 --> 01:53:06,747
Don't cross the limits
in trying to kiss me.

915
01:53:07,426 --> 01:53:09,951
Mustn't run after buses and autos.

916
01:53:10,262 --> 01:53:12,423
Quit smoking immediately.

917
01:53:25,944 --> 01:53:28,606
Am l looking cheap
for coming on my own?

918
01:53:29,781 --> 01:53:30,941
l'll kill you!

919
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:34,282
l'll die hundred times.

920
01:54:00,979 --> 01:54:02,970
For making me come to you...

921
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:05,810
You did some magic...

922
01:54:06,318 --> 01:54:10,311
Did some magic...When l changed
and saw under my feet...

923
01:54:10,489 --> 01:54:12,320
l found sky...

924
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:13,651
Stars were hitting my head...

925
01:54:13,825 --> 01:54:18,660
l could lay hands on the moon...

926
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:20,991
l started blushing...
straight into my nerves...

927
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:23,157
You've entered like queen...

928
01:54:23,335 --> 01:54:27,499
l've changed unbelievably
like you...

929
01:54:29,508 --> 01:54:34,343
Never ending for generations...
- Your companionship is a treasure...

930
01:54:34,513 --> 01:54:38,506
There's no difference
between yours and mine...

931
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:09,544
We've become a pair to
pack loneliness to home...

932
01:55:09,881 --> 01:55:13,544
Let's dance to make
this earth sweat...

933
01:55:13,719 --> 01:55:18,554
Am l not myself anymore?
Have l become you?

934
01:55:18,724 --> 01:55:22,387
So much change to change life...
- Have l taken a new birth?

935
01:55:22,561 --> 01:55:27,555
Have l left myself to be
like you and become you?

936
01:55:27,733 --> 01:55:30,566
lt's rain of love on me...

937
01:55:59,264 --> 01:56:01,425
Though there are many fights,
it dawned...

938
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,591
Dawn sprinkled cool water...

939
01:56:03,769 --> 01:56:05,760
Black and white struggled...

940
01:56:05,937 --> 01:56:07,768
Scrambled under the sheets...

941
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:11,102
How many colours...
- Rain that has swallowed...

942
01:56:11,276 --> 01:56:12,607
lt drenched my heart...

943
01:56:12,778 --> 01:56:16,942
Distance distanced itself...
- Became the dot on my forehead...

944
01:56:17,115 --> 01:56:23,281
Your first appearance...
driven out my long pending wish...

945
01:56:23,955 --> 01:56:27,288
The burden has given way
to our union...

946
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:32,794
The way is raining boons...

947
01:56:32,964 --> 01:56:36,798
My girl has become my fate...

948
01:56:36,968 --> 01:56:41,302
Your shadow which accuses
waiting for me...

949
01:56:41,473 --> 01:56:46,968
May be your life partner...
Not leave you till end...

950
01:57:10,001 --> 01:57:12,162
Say you love only me!

951
01:57:14,506 --> 01:57:16,906
Say you'd die without me.

952
01:57:38,864 --> 01:57:42,197
She needs at least
16 operations to survive.

953
01:57:42,367 --> 01:57:44,858
4 important operations have
to be done in America.

954
01:57:45,036 --> 01:57:47,368
l think this is beyond your means.

955
01:57:47,706 --> 01:57:50,197
lf you leave her like this,
at least you can live happily.

956
01:58:02,387 --> 01:58:04,947
Mithuna will live!

957
01:58:10,395 --> 01:58:14,388
Mithuna will live
if l go far away!

958
01:58:15,567 --> 01:58:16,556
l'll go away!

959
01:58:22,407 --> 01:58:27,743
Hiding truth, telling lie,
are both same, uncle?

960
01:58:27,913 --> 01:58:30,404
lf truth is fire, lie is loan.

961
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:34,749
One will burn you and
another will chase you.

962
01:58:35,754 --> 01:58:37,085
Think over it yourself.

963
01:59:06,117 --> 01:59:10,611
Gautham? ls it you?
Please come in.

964
01:59:10,789 --> 01:59:11,778
Please sit down.

965
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:17,459
l didn't expect you here,
please sit here. Sit.

966
01:59:20,131 --> 01:59:21,621
Mother! Where are you?
- Bus stand.

967
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,789
Gautham is here.
- ls it?

968
01:59:22,968 --> 01:59:24,299
l'm confused.

969
01:59:24,469 --> 01:59:25,959
Has he come alone?
- Yes.

970
01:59:26,137 --> 01:59:27,968
Come quickly.
- Okay.

971
01:59:29,641 --> 01:59:31,302
Would you like to have coffee?

972
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:33,801
Don't look at me like that,
l've learnt.

973
01:59:33,979 --> 01:59:35,469
l made excellent coffee.

974
01:59:40,819 --> 01:59:43,310
TV is working, you can use it.

975
01:59:48,827 --> 01:59:55,995
Since no one is in home,
don't even try to touch my shadow.

976
01:59:56,334 --> 01:59:57,494
l'll raise a hell!

977
02:00:32,704 --> 02:00:35,104
lt thinks it has life.

978
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:40,375
Poor thing doesn't know it has no life.

979
02:00:40,879 --> 02:00:41,868
And it can't fly!

980
02:00:46,384 --> 02:00:48,875
Surya is alive!

981
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:50,710
This is true!

982
02:01:18,249 --> 02:01:20,410
You said you didn't have the
courage to tell the truth.

983
02:01:39,938 --> 02:01:42,930
You can smile and make others cry!

984
02:01:44,109 --> 02:01:47,272
What if Mithuna wants Surya!

985
02:01:48,613 --> 02:01:49,944
Would you still smile just like this?

986
02:01:54,285 --> 02:01:59,450
This is not property to give up.
lt's your life.

987
02:02:13,138 --> 02:02:16,130
1992, December - Curfew hour

988
02:02:24,983 --> 02:02:25,972
Who are you?

989
02:02:26,151 --> 02:02:28,483
l want to meet my father,
l want to talk to him.

990
02:02:28,653 --> 02:02:32,817
Where are you coming from?
Don't you know the area is under curfew?

991
02:02:32,991 --> 02:02:33,980
Father!

992
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:37,151
Who is that? There's no father
here, go away.

993
02:02:37,328 --> 02:02:39,159
You can't go that side.
- Go back.

994
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:42,822
l can't understand your language.
l don't know.

995
02:02:44,002 --> 02:02:45,162
Father!

996
02:02:53,845 --> 02:02:55,005
Let her go!

997
02:03:24,375 --> 02:03:31,213
Tell me the truth, father.
Surya is alive.

998
02:03:36,221 --> 02:03:38,382
l ruined myself half
as father with this.

999
02:03:38,556 --> 02:03:42,219
l may get ruined completely
if l tell the truth.

1000
02:03:42,393 --> 02:03:44,054
Tell me truth only, father.

1001
02:03:44,229 --> 02:03:47,721
She needs at least
16 operations to survive.

1002
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:50,390
4 important operations have
to be done in America.

1003
02:03:50,568 --> 02:03:52,900
lf you leave her like this,
at least you can live happily.

1004
02:03:53,071 --> 02:03:55,562
l know how to save my daughter.

1005
02:03:57,408 --> 02:04:00,900
No, let's take away
our daughter from here.

1006
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:08,246
He tells us to leave her.
Will you carry?

1007
02:04:08,586 --> 02:04:10,417
l carried her for 9 months!

1008
02:04:11,256 --> 02:04:13,247
Are you God?

1009
02:04:13,925 --> 02:04:17,326
l don't know who you are!
My body isn't co-operating.

1010
02:04:17,929 --> 02:04:19,089
l must fall at your feet.

1011
02:04:20,265 --> 02:04:22,756
Spending so much without
any relationship...

1012
02:04:22,934 --> 02:04:26,927
To forge relationship,
if you don't have an objections.

1013
02:04:28,273 --> 02:04:30,104
First the girl must survive.

1014
02:04:31,943 --> 02:04:37,279
My girl has become my fate...

1015
02:04:45,623 --> 02:04:46,783
Where's the lCU?

1016
02:04:48,126 --> 02:04:51,027
God left me with no choice, dear.

1017
02:04:51,462 --> 02:04:57,298
Any father would like his
daughter to marry not to die!

1018
02:04:57,468 --> 02:04:59,459
You should've left me to die.

1019
02:05:03,474 --> 02:05:04,634
What am l to do now?

1020
02:05:07,145 --> 02:05:09,306
l feel like l've died hundred times.

1021
02:05:22,994 --> 02:05:27,158
Fix the marriage at
the earliest, father.

1022
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,360
What's the meeting at
the time to commit murders?

1023
02:06:04,369 --> 02:06:06,360
You've to kill a man.

1024
02:06:22,553 --> 02:06:24,043
Are you playing joke?

1025
02:06:27,225 --> 02:06:29,557
l wish this was ajoke.

1026
02:06:35,066 --> 02:06:38,229
Any business problem?
- More than that!

1027
02:06:39,404 --> 02:06:40,393
My son!

1028
02:06:41,239 --> 02:06:42,900
You called me at the right time.

1029
02:06:44,575 --> 02:06:46,065
Who should l kill?

1030
02:06:47,245 --> 02:06:53,081
lt took me 3 days to
take this decision.

1031
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,251
ln a minute after hearing it,

1032
02:07:00,925 --> 02:07:03,587
you're asking,
who should l kill?

1033
02:07:07,098 --> 02:07:08,258
ls killing so easy?

1034
02:07:08,433 --> 02:07:13,598
Didn't hear Rama going to hell for
killing Vali from behind a tree.

1035
02:07:14,272 --> 02:07:16,263
Sugreeva too who ordered that kill.

1036
02:07:19,777 --> 02:07:21,506
What if the victim
is Rama himself?

1037
02:07:24,115 --> 02:07:26,276
lt's time for him to put
an end to his incarnation.

1038
02:07:37,962 --> 02:07:39,122
Who is amongst you is Odhelu?

1039
02:07:47,305 --> 02:07:48,294
What's the job?

1040
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,979
Come here.

1041
02:08:07,658 --> 02:08:09,649
Conference will be over by 5 pm,
then...

1042
02:08:09,827 --> 02:08:13,319
This is not a smoking zone, idiot.
Throw it out.

1043
02:08:18,169 --> 02:08:20,160
That's not an ash tray!

1044
02:08:23,508 --> 02:08:25,999
Come...come, there's lot of
matter to discuss.

1045
02:08:26,177 --> 02:08:27,667
What's the matter you've
come here suddenly?

1046
02:08:27,845 --> 02:08:30,678
To say sorry to dad,
l went overboard last night.

1047
02:08:34,185 --> 02:08:35,846
Won't you talk to me?

1048
02:08:37,355 --> 02:08:39,016
Do you see anything new in me?

1049
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:42,682
You look very happy!
Have you divorced Ramesh?

1050
02:08:45,863 --> 02:08:47,023
Yes.

1051
02:08:54,539 --> 02:08:56,029
l'm Sharma here.

1052
02:08:56,707 --> 02:09:00,040
ls Prakash there?
- He's in a conference.- ls it?

1053
02:09:00,711 --> 02:09:01,609
There is.

1054
02:09:05,716 --> 02:09:06,705
What should l tell?

1055
02:09:10,555 --> 02:09:13,183
l'm fine.
How are you?

1056
02:09:27,238 --> 02:09:29,729
The Rama you told me about
isn't in Ayodhya.

1057
02:09:29,907 --> 02:09:33,240
He has been exiled to a
dilapidated factory in Ananthagiri.

1058
02:09:33,411 --> 02:09:34,571
With empty bottles!

1059
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:37,240
Bargained and fixed
the rate with Ravana.

1060
02:09:37,415 --> 02:09:40,077
Day after tomorrow night
Rama's incarnation will end.

1061
02:09:40,251 --> 02:09:41,912
After that world will rejoice!

1062
02:09:45,590 --> 02:09:49,253
Why did you tell me
that Surya is alive?

1063
02:09:53,931 --> 02:09:56,263
You came suddenly,
you broke the news,

1064
02:10:00,938 --> 02:10:02,098
are you testing me?

1065
02:10:14,785 --> 02:10:17,618
Can l see him only once?

1066
02:10:25,463 --> 02:10:28,626
How is he now?
Did you see him?

1067
02:11:18,516 --> 02:11:21,007
Hey you! Are you still alive?

1068
02:11:31,362 --> 02:11:35,355
l'm scared!
Let's go away quickly from here!

1069
02:11:36,701 --> 02:11:37,759
Are you scared?

1070
02:11:40,204 --> 02:11:43,196
How can you be scared
in your own temple?

1071
02:11:45,209 --> 02:11:47,871
We've come to the climax,
come to Surya.

1072
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:53,448
Hey Miss!

1073
02:11:56,721 --> 02:11:58,552
l forgot to tell you
for so many days.

1074
02:12:16,073 --> 02:12:17,233
l want to talk to Prakash.

1075
02:12:17,408 --> 02:12:19,899
Ordered not to disturb him.

1076
02:12:21,912 --> 02:12:23,402
His son is dead.

1077
02:12:24,915 --> 02:12:26,576
l told you not to disturb me.

1078
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,079
Go!

1079
02:12:31,589 --> 02:12:33,750
Father!
- Tell me son!

1080
02:12:34,925 --> 02:12:37,416
l know you love me so much to die.

1081
02:12:40,598 --> 02:12:42,088
l didn't know it was to
the extent of killing!

1082
02:12:42,266 --> 02:12:43,927
What are you saying, Gautham?

1083
02:12:47,605 --> 02:12:50,597
Truth!
- What truth?

1084
02:12:50,775 --> 02:12:54,108
lt isn't Surya who is going
to die now, father. Your son Gautham!

1085
02:12:54,612 --> 02:12:57,274
Have you gone mad?

1086
02:12:57,448 --> 02:12:59,780
lt's the first mistake
of your life, father.

1087
02:13:01,952 --> 02:13:03,852
What have l done, son?

1088
02:13:04,288 --> 02:13:06,449
Why such a harsh punishment to me?

1089
02:13:07,792 --> 02:13:10,124
You mustn't have any reason
to commit a mistake, father.

1090
02:13:12,129 --> 02:13:14,620
Lastly...even if is me!

1091
02:13:16,634 --> 02:13:17,464
You mustn't have!

1092
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,540
Mr. Father!

1093
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:28,972
Will you fulfill my last wish?

1094
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:33,143
Don't say like that son!
l'll die right now.

1095
02:13:33,317 --> 02:13:34,978
No...no way, father.

1096
02:13:38,489 --> 02:13:45,327
You must live!
You must live till you die.- No!

1097
02:13:45,496 --> 02:13:47,327
lf you've any love for me..

1098
02:13:49,667 --> 02:13:50,998
l think you would've...

1099
02:13:52,837 --> 02:13:58,002
Forgive me once, son!

1100
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:03,840
l can't bear this sorrow.

1101
02:14:08,352 --> 02:14:09,683
Bear it with a smile, father.

1102
02:14:11,355 --> 02:14:12,845
That's my last wish.

1103
02:14:16,193 --> 02:14:18,184
l'll fall at your feet, son.

1104
02:14:27,204 --> 02:14:29,035
l'm not smiling now, father.

1105
02:14:29,707 --> 02:14:32,039
Don't leave me alone!

1106
02:14:35,379 --> 02:14:37,040
Talk to me please...

1107
02:16:12,476 --> 02:16:13,966
See if this card will make the show.

1108
02:16:14,645 --> 02:16:18,479
They're killing my son.
Please save him, sir.

1109
02:16:18,649 --> 02:16:19,638
What happened?

1110
02:16:19,817 --> 02:16:22,980
l'll give you crores, no...
l'll give my entire property.

1111
02:16:23,153 --> 02:16:24,814
Who is killing him?
- l don't know.

1112
02:16:24,989 --> 02:16:26,820
Who is killing him?
Tell me quickly.

1113
02:16:26,991 --> 02:16:28,481
Don't irritate me.
- Me!

1114
02:16:30,327 --> 02:16:33,160
What does he think? ls it police
station or mental hospital?

1115
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:36,993
lf you're free, play cards
instead of playing with me.

1116
02:16:37,167 --> 02:16:39,158
lt seems he'll kill and
wants us to save him.

1117
02:16:39,336 --> 02:16:41,327
Who is he?
- Some fool!

1118
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:31,119
Are you bleeding?

1119
02:17:38,896 --> 02:17:41,729
How dare you beat me!

1120
02:17:45,235 --> 02:17:47,203
Behead him!!- Buy me drink, l'll break it myself.

1121
02:17:52,576 --> 02:17:54,407
l'll break open the head myself.

1122
02:20:08,212 --> 02:20:10,703
Are you scared, son?

1123
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:15,381
lt's very painful, father.

1124
02:20:18,722 --> 02:20:21,555
l can see death far away.

1125
02:20:23,227 --> 02:20:25,058
l can't wait till then.

1126
02:21:42,973 --> 02:21:45,806
He's dead, right?

1127
02:21:47,477 --> 02:21:48,637
Leave him.

1128
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:53,643
l don't know who you are!
But you're very lucky!

1129
02:21:54,318 --> 02:21:55,979
You're dead completely.

1130
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:59,812
We're strangers to
each other till we live.

1131
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:05,485
But for each other, one sacrificed
love and another sacrificed life.

1132
02:22:18,842 --> 02:22:20,673
l'm unable to forget Gautham.

1133
02:22:21,678 --> 02:22:24,010
l want little time, Surya.

1134
02:22:36,526 --> 02:22:39,689
Missing

1135
02:22:42,032 --> 02:22:47,026
Past is chasing!
Future is scaring!

1136
02:22:48,372 --> 02:22:55,039
To escape l've only one region!
Present!

1137
02:22:56,213 --> 02:22:59,046
Just present only!

1138
02:23:01,551 --> 02:23:06,386
Running far away from
the merciless love!
