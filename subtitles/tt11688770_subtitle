The place is cool.. but what will we
do other than eating and drinking?

00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,516
For the moment all hold their own place.

21
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,333

00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,916
You all wanted adventure

38

00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,666
Nothing sir.

53
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,166
The car is good

54
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes We know

55
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,041
What's the matter boss

56
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,296
You seem to be in a
different mood this morning

57
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,415
Did you not sleep at night

58
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,041
Nothing like this

59
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,208
Tell me one thing

60
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,166
Did you hear anything at night

61
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,208
What?

62
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,250
Some ghoul sound or something

63
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,416
No

64
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Leave it

65
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What are you thinking?

66
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,375
Dude, at night I heard the
sound of someone's ghoul

67
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,288
Do not understand whether
that voice was true or not

68
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,333
That voice was true, sir

69
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,541
Tea

70
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,375
Can't believe it?

71
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,291
But you were trying to believe

72
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,333
Well

73
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,583
Let me tell you what you heard last night

74
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,001
There is a village just a
little further due here

75
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,875
Named "SAR"

76
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,166
The village for the last several years

77
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
Unheard of due to a witch

78
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,541
Witch?

79
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,708
Yes Witch

80
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,166
People know her by different names

81
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,666
Someone calls her a witch

82
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,738
Someone calls him an evil spirit

83
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,666
In our place, she is called a daakan

84
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,958
These are all stories of stories

85
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,791
The story is also real
and the stories are also

86
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,791
Because witch is also real sir

87
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,745
For the past several years, this village
has been in the possession of a witch.

88
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,833
And what you heard last night

89
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,083
That was the voice of the same witch's feet

90
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,166
Whenever she comes here

91
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,041
The whole village is closed

92
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,750
Not a single villager is seen outside

93
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,250
But why does she come to the village

94
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,416
Maybe looking for someone

95
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,541
Since she came to this village

96
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,541
Does not leave any newcomer alive

97
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,375
Whether he is a relative of a villager

98
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,875
Or a traveler like you

99
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,375
For her

100
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Everyone's gonna die

101
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,833
But

102
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,541
Why did the boss hear her voice

103
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,208
We are not in the village

104
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:19,041
Not in the village but at
the border of that village

105
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,375
The village starts a little
further away from here

106
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,083
And starts with

107
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,916
The area of that witch

108
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,833
Nobody has gone to that village
for so many years

109
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,208
So .. we will go to that village

110
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,583
Now you did the man's thing

111
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,434
Although you never do

112
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,166
I am with you

113
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,416
No no don't get into this unnecessary mess

114
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,125
Have come to roam here, roam
and get out of here that's it.

115
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,166
I'm not going anywhere

116
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,916
Listen, dude

117
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,017
What is it?

118
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,916
Man you are afraid a lot

119
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,250
Just like she will come and pick you up

120
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:35,059
She is also a girl, even if she takes you,
have fun dude

121
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,583
Don't talk unnecessarily

122
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,875
If you want to go then go
I'm not going anywhere

123
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,208
So tell me

124
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,916
Who's ready to go

125
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Now think

126
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,125
Have to spend two days sitting here only
or want some horror?

127
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,708
See if what "Khan" is saying happens or not

128
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,750
What do you say

129
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,208
Brother

130
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,541
Tell me one thing

131
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,875
How do these villagers know that
the witch is going to come

132
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,875
This is a good question

133
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,892
HEERA

134
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,916
Heera?

135
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,208
Heera tells everyone

136
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,476
What ever he is

137
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,267
We meet him in the village

138
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,291

139
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791

Maybe you don't know what you're saying

190
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,416
The news of all of you coming,
that witch must have guessed

191
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,666
Giving everyone a chance

192
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,541
Get out of here before night falls or else

193
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,333
What else tell me?

194
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,875
Here I am Come kill me

195
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,601
If encountered

196
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,375
You will pee inside

197
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,041
Get the hell out of here

198
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,416
Don't make fun of it

199
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,625
Baba

200
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,666
Give us only one night to stay

201
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,958
If there’s is really a
witch in this village

202
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,291
We will take her with us

203
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,559
forever

204
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,583
No

205
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,916
Not a single night

206
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,940
Get the hell out from here Right now

207
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,541
I am telling you people Let's go from here

208
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,333
Chanting mantras

209
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,208
I will drive that witch away

210
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,166
I have that power in me

211
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,541
Friends

212
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,916
Tell these people

213
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,500
Why do you guys bring me here

214
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,041
again chanting mantras

215
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,416
The grief of all you villagers ends today

216
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,750
Because I will arrest that witch

217
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:58,958
Baba Only one chance

218
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,208
Only one

219
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,041
Fine

220
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,625
We give you guys a chance to stay tonight

221
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:51,226
But if anything happened
then the responsibility is your own

222
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,250
Ok Ok

223
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,250
We agree

224
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Get lost

225
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,083
Come, let's see the village now

226
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:08,875
Ok

227
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:12,791
You guys go
I will arrange some food for you guys

228
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,750
Just be careful

229
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,958
Haha careful?? haha

230
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,041
evil laughter

231
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,250
Seeing this village, it seems that

232
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,458
It's too old

233
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Deepak

234
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:12,291
Seeing this, it seems like the
witch will actually come here

235
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,166
Let's go

236
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,125
Don't see such crazy things

237
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,875
Jay

238
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,625
Rakhi

239
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:33,833
Where are you guys?

240
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,958
Don't buff man

241
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:42,833
Where are you guys?

242
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,000
I almost died You idiot

243
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,375
I will kill you

244
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:20,958
Crazy

245
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,750
Just stop please

246
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:32,916
Baba

247
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,416
Want to talk to you

248
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,708
I know what you want to talk

249
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,976
Come

250
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,375
Worship the goddess first

251
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:16,625
Baba

252
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,066
You were about to tell me something

253
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,351
Very few people dare

254
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,559
Someone deliberately do

255
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,583
Some inadvertently

256
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,809
Means?

257
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,351
Meaning that you guys have also dared

258
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,375
But unknowingly

259
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,833
What do you want to say

260
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,041
This is why no new man has come
to this village for many years

261
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,833
For years I have not seen
any new face in this temple

262
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,041
It's all because of that witch story?

263
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,291
What else

264
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,541
All these are concocted by all of them

265
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,541
Not concocted

266
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:50,000
Till date, no new man has
come to this village

267
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,291
has never survived

268
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,041
That witch I saw her

269
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,059
Gives a very painful death

270
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,083
very painful

271
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,583
But

272
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,541
But why does she do all this

273
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
The story of years ago

274
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,708
In the same village

275
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,791
Down here was her house

276
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,583
She was evil woman

277
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,100
She used to look at anyone with evil eye

278
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,416
Especially children

279
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,916
Then slowly the children started dying

280
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,458
And one day

281
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,392
The villagers together hanged her

282
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,625
That was the biggest mistake of them all

283
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,083
All will die

284
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:55,958
He is heera

285
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,458
He tells the whole village that
the witch is going to come

286
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:06,541
How?

287
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,958
You will find the answer yourself

288
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:21,083
It is near evening and the
witch is sure to come

289
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,166
That's why I suggest you guys stay here

290
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,083
correct Babaji is right

291
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:30,934
Gone mad?

292
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:31,934
Came to stay here?

293
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:32,958
Agreeing to him?

294
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,871
If you want adventure, you
have to go to the village

295
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,708
But

296
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,583
You shut up now

297
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,125
Wait

298
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,291
One more thing before leaving

299
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,125
Only this temple in this village

300
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,666
Where you come back

301
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Then you will be alive

302
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,791
Good night

303
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,666
Now she will come

304
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,291
She will eat you all

305
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,666
You will see it

306
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,208
You all are left out

307
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,083
You are left out

308
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:31,916
Village closed Completely closed

309
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,750
What I heard seems to be correct

310
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,530
I'm saying let's get out of here

311
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,083
Chanting mantras

312
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,458
Where will you go now Trapped

313
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,458
You all have to die now

314
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,916
You all have to die now

315
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:03,000
You have to die now

316
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:08,208
You have to die now

317
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,958
You all will see the
spectacle of your death

318
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:16,559
You all will see the
spectacle of your death

319
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,583
No No

320
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:21,708
I will see the spectacle of your death

321
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:26,625
I will see the spectacle of your death

322
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,583
Will be fun

323
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,000
Will be great fun

324
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,291
Listen this is the way out of the village

325
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:36,916
Natasha

326
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Rahul

327
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,208
Where is everyone?

328
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,416
Don't know

329
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,083
Oh my god

330
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,333
What to do?

331
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,458
Natasha

332
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,083
Do you hear something?

333
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,708
The sound of bells

334
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,875
The priest said

335
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:02,434
Temple is only the place if we reach there
we will survive

336
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,809
But it will take time to go to the temple

337
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,642
But there is no other option

338
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,851
We have to go there anyway

339
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:09,851
There is an option

340
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,916
We just have to reach the car

341
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,708
Yes, car

342
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,333
My key?

343
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,541
The key to the second car is with Jai

344
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,351
The key to the second car
is with Jai, Let's go

345
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,375
Where is Jay?

346
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:28,791
Please open

347
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,500
Someone please open the gate

348
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,000
Why I came

349
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Come fast

350
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,000
The temple is near

351
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,291
Not dead yet?

352
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,833
Not dead yet?

353
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,416
You will die soon

354
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,243
God hanuman chants start

355
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:09,029
Forgot the mantras

356
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:06,018
Why did she leave me

357
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:21,100
It's sure to end after every start
It has begun, now the end will come...

358
