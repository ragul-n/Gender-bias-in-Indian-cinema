1
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,557
I'm ready

2
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,102
"Ready, ready, ready...
I'm ready for love"

3
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,110
"I want to fall in love..."

4
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:25,115
"my heart goads me to
fall in love"

5
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:45,129
"Childhood is passe,
I've now stepped into youth..."

6
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:50,130
"and how crazy I've gone"

7
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:57,070
"I'm ready, ready...
ready for love"

8
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,113
"If someone would come..."

9
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,622
"and teach me..."

10
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,119
"the way to love"

11
00:03:54,105 --> 00:04:00,408
"I've gone crazy..."

12
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,580
"who am I to call my lover?"

13
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,580
"I'm dying to love"

14
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,082
"I'm ready"

15
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:20,086
"I'm ready, ready...
ready for love"

16
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,462
"On my finger..."

17
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,729
"if someone..."

18
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,570
"could put a diamond ring"

19
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:17,754
"On my mobile-phone,
if a lover..."

20
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:21,092
"could make the ring-tone
of love come alive"

21
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:24,562
"I'm dying, dying for love"

22
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:29,598
"I'm ready!"

23
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:34,101
"I'm ready, ready...
ready for love"

24
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,275
"I want to fall in love,
my heart goads me to fall in love"

25
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,280
"Fall in love!"

26
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:58,696
"I'm ready, ready...
ready for love"

27
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:09,073
"Childhood is in the past,
I'm now into youth..."

28
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,576
"and how crazy I've gone"

29
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,084
"I'm ready, ready...
ready for love"

30
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:11,586
Welcome my Indian friends to this
Saturday night fun party!

31
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:19,060
You will all be given masks and there
will he some hot music for a minute

32
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:24,063
The spotlight will follow you and
exactly in a minute, the music will stop

33
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:29,077
The couple the spotlight focuses on
will be the couple of the evening!

34
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,272
So ladies and gentlemen,
let's rock the party!

35
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:16,052
I'm first?
The spotlight's on me?

36
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,196
Congratulations to me!

37
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:23,566
My delicious ghari from Surat!
My delectable chuda from Vadodara!

38
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:27,066
Let me take a snap of yours
immediately... one minute, okay?

39
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,068
Say cheese!

40
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:33,276
My moon-like beauty...
show me your pretty face!

41
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:42,083
Mask behind a mask?
Nd that too a Sardarji's mask?

42
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:46,446
Take that off!
- I'm real a Sardar. Sat Sri kal

43
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,458
Why does all this
happen only to me?

44
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,827
That's the wrong couple! We got
5 seconds of music coming up next!

45
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:18,116
I request the couple of the evening
to please come to the stage

46
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,117
Thanks

47
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:26,125
Congratulations!
I got to take your snap too

48
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,128
Please introduce yourselves

49
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:32,603
Hi friends. I'm Kajal from Mumbai.
India

50
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:38,464
I'm here on a holiday with my friends
and I'm having a blast

51
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,479
Hi friends. I'm Raj.
Look at the miracles of destiny

52
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,149
I'm also from Mumbai, India.
But I'm all alone

53
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,645
I'm single... and ready to mingle

54
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,086
He's hot!

55
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,758
I now request Raj and Kajal
to rock the floor

56
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:22,452
Thanks, thank you

57
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:26,623
I really enjoyed myself...
- Excuse me

58
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,528
Yes?
- Let's be friends

59
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,627
I don't make friends with strangers.
You're not my cup of tea

60
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,132
Could I be your coffee then?
- I hate coffee

61
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:44,141
So what do you like?
- T least not you

62
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,644
But I'm destined to have you.
No wonder we met here

63
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:50,142
You call this co-incidence
your destiny?

64
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,740
How silly!
You're such a naive guy

65
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,585
But it's this silly and naive guy
you're going to be crazy about someday

66
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,587
Really? But I'm still not saying
"all the best" to you

67
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,089
What will you say then?
- Bye

68
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,085
Bye, bye

69
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,593
She said bye.
She didn't say bhai (brother)

70
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,772
Raj loves Kajal

71
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,103
Raj loves Kajal

72
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:43,600
Raj loves Kajal

73
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,409
Raj loves Kajal?

74
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,580
"The scarf flies away..."

75
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,554
Kajal!
- Raj! My love

76
00:13:12,597 --> 00:13:16,431
Oh my love! Kajal!
- What love, brother?

77
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,105
So my love drew you to me?
- Yes, Raj...

78
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:26,607
tell me, how many cars?
- Cars? I have four!

79
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,279
Let go, I don't want your car!

80
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:34,614
What could be your bank balance?
- I own the bank... Father Bank

81
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:41,450
Father Bank? Never heard of it.
- My father! He's Father Bank!

82
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,786
Father bank or mother bank...
what have I go to do with that?

83
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,528
Have yourself examined, will you?
What's going on over here?

84
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:49,833
How can I stay away
from you, my love...?

85
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,569
"Let me go, for God's sake..."

86
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:58,473
"what we're doing
isn't right for men"

87
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:01,737
Let go... don't cling to me!
What's come over you?

88
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,078
How sweet!

89
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:08,580
You're treading on fire, okay? Take
your hands off, before you get burnt!

90
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:13,482
What are you doing, dammit!
What if someone sees us...?

91
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,751
Let them see...
but let me make love

92
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,426
Make love to the one you should!
Madman!

93
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,763
You...?
- What were you upto?

94
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,602
Oh my God! Kajal!

95
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:30,095
You were dreaming of Kajal
and licking my face...?

96
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:35,108
The places you shoved your hands into!
You got into every no-entry zone!

97
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,606
She's the one you love, right?
So make an entry with her!

98
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:48,614
See? I'm a photographer. I capture
people's feelings in my camera!

99
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:53,057
I develop it into a love-story then.
I'll set it up for you, feller!

100
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:57,557
Thank you. She's so beautiful.
- No doubt... she is beautiful

101
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,397
My friends also showed me a picture.
Nd I agreed to marry her

102
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:06,407
On our nuptial-night, when it was
time for me to raise the bridal veil...

103
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:12,408
I did it in a manner
no one can ever imagine!

104
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:24,824
"Hot new vessel has just
arrived in my house"

105
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:35,099
"It's as if you were heated up
only for me"

106
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:45,611
"I'm so starved, I'm taking off
the lid..."

107
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,555
My word! You sing so well!

108
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,231
Why're you keeping away?

109
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:11,071
What's up with you?
Why're your lips trembling?

110
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,578
Why are you so scared?

111
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,081
"My lips tremble out of fear"

112
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:23,083
"My heart's about to explode"

113
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:30,083
"Your body looks like
a graveyard to me"

114
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:38,090
"Spend a night with me..."

115
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:44,602
"I'll make love to you
till dawn"

116
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:04,056
"Let me get going...
or what might happen of me?"

117
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:07,059
"Let me get going...
I'll be finished in a few moments"

118
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,393
"Let me think on my feet...
else I'll be dead"

119
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,566
"Before I die,
let me learn the way to life"

120
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:23,070
Ever since I've been on the run.
Like I were running an Olympics race

121
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:29,075
From India to Indonesia to Korea to
ustralia to Cape Town in South frica!

122
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:32,081
She catches my scent and follows me
wherever I go

123
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,425
That's my tragic love-story.
But I have it worked out for you

124
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,596
I'll see you've got it made.
- Thanks

125
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,054
Look at that, Kajal!

126
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,156
Raj!
- Yes?

127
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,426
Time to celebrate!
It's Kajal... c'mon!

128
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:58,406
Hi Kajal
- Oh no

129
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:03,039
nother miracle of destiny, see?
We meet again

130
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,573
Why do you call these small
coincidences part of destiny?

131
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,553
Don't you believe in destiny?

132
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,718
Whether I do or don't.
What difference does it make?

133
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:20,063
Meeting like this is mere
happenstance. Co-incidence

134
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:24,067
Kajal, he dreams of you,
and clutches on to me!

135
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:28,269
I had a narrow escape yesterday.
Is that a co-incidence too?

136
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,235
That's not a coincidence.
It's an accident!

137
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,438
Could I have an accident with her?
- Hey!

138
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,578
I've already had breakfast!

139
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,413
Naughty.
- Let coincidence become destiny

140
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,621
He's a great guy!
So let a love-story happen!

141
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,585
Really? II right

142
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,590
I'll write my mobile-number
on the sands there

143
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:51,761
You will stand there,
by the rocks

144
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,595
I'll gesture to you,
you must come rushing over...

145
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:59,234
note down my number
and phone me. Okay?

146
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:03,600
By the time I get there, the waves
will have wiped out the number

147
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,305
She's conning you, all right!

148
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,247
It's not so easy to win me over.
Why? You've lost faith in destiny?

149
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,117
Never. I agree

150
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,777
Go and stand by the rocks then.
- Okay

151
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,126
Don't take the trouble
of scrawling your number

152
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:26,124
Just give me the number.
I'll make a call

153
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,927
I said I've had breakfast!

154
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,303
C'mon!

155
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,150
C'mon! Faster!

156
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:55,088
Fast! Come on!

157
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,094
C'mon!

158
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:19,615
Oh shit!

159
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:31,788
Like the waves washed out my number,
erase my name from your heart

160
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:34,460
Else, you'll keep running in
circles all your life

161
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:38,465
nd what you'll get is... nothing!
Bye

162
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:47,466
Well? Nervous already?
Because she's going away?

163
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:52,406
Look, when you jump a traffic-signal,
you think nobody has seen you

164
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,581
But the traffic cop always takes down
your registration number. Right?

165
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:01,587
I'm no cop, I'm a photographer.
But I sure can print the number

166
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,087
I've got her number.
- That's great, buddy!

167
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,594
No wrong place this time, I hope?
- No way!

168
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,768
Cheers!

169
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,105
She's here?

170
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,108
I'm dead!
Here comes the nuisance!

171
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,612
Who?
- The one I'm running away from...

172
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,608
my wife! She's coming!
Don't look back... don't!

173
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:33,521
Save me today. Just say "yes" to
everything I say... nothing more

174
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,124
My darling!
- Just a moment

175
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:41,120
I can take you all over Cape Town,
don't worry

176
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:48,631
If you want to see Nelson Mandela,
a one-day cricket match...

177
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:52,574
on a lovely Sunday!
Like Salim Masala

178
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,573
So what is it, sister?
- Sister? I'm your wife, mister!

179
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:01,409
Does anyone leave his wife
on the nuptial-night...

180
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:03,586
without consummating the marriage?
- Who did that?

181
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:07,257
You did! I followed your scent here

182
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,585
I'm not sparing you anymore.
Let's go back to India!

183
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:13,422
India? Why India?
What's her problem, man? Sk her!

184
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,598
What's your problem, ma'am?
- He's my pati (husband)

185
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,099
Patiya? What patiya?
- She says that you're her husband

186
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:27,604
Husband? She must be joking!
Madam, I'm already married. You know?

187
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,111
Four wives. Eight children.
Nd four more coming!

188
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:34,609
If they get to know I'm your husband,
they'll kill me. You understand?

189
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:36,615
Patiya? What Patiya?

190
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:40,123
One minute... the phone.
- You must be mistaken, ma'am

191
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:53,726
Labour-pains. My wife giving birth
to my baby. It's coming, yeah!

192
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:58,063
Congratulations! Don't worry, sis!
I'll pray for your husband

193
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:01,073
Brother, your cab's arriving
at 9

194
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:07,072
Hello...? Delivery...?
Delivery!

195
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:12,088
Ma'am... please! Sit down...
relax, don't worry

196
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,756
Ma'am, relax.
He's not Funsukh

197
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:21,086
He's a local guide.
He's a South frican

198
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:25,101
re you sure?
- Yes

199
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:27,270
re you speaking the truth?
- Of course

200
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,775
re you single...?

201
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,272
What happened?
Ready to mingle?

202
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:39,445
Labour pains!

203
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,116
Hello?
- Hi, Kajal

204
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,616
Who's this?
- You don't like my face...

205
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:54,557
and don't recognise my voice.
But I'll tell you, if you want to know

206
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:56,725
Yes?
- This is Raj, darling

207
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,568
You? Where did you get
my number from?

208
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:02,571
I followed your fingers that scrawled
the number on the sand

209
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,073
lmpossible!

210
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,411
Beautiful girls look prettier
when they are angry

211
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,080
Like you look right now

212
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,551
Can you see me?
- Yes

213
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:16,585
nd where are you?

214
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,414
I could come out in the open,
if you command me

215
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:20,419
Why not? Come on out

216
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,092
Look to your right then

217
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:30,597
You're not to my right.
- Look to your left then

218
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:33,095
Left...?

219
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,102
You're not to the left either

220
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,579
Now look to the front, my love

221
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,616
head? You're not
in front of me either

222
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:51,187
Turn around, will you?
- Turn around?

223
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:02,665
Now look down, my love.
- Down?

224
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:14,069
You're not down there, either!

225
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:18,073
Look behind then, love.
- Where...

226
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:23,086
where did you get my number?
- Wherever. But I got it, all right

227
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:28,088
If you want to be friends with me,
tell me where you got my number

228
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:31,461
re we really friends, if I tell you?
- Yes

229
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:34,597
You're the witness, okay?
- Yes

230
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:39,601
Once you scribbled your number on the
sand, Funsukh-bhai took a snap of it

231
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,335
Cheating! This is cheating!

232
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:46,442
Kajal, in the olden times,
war used to break out for love

233
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:51,114
Nowadays, one's got to cheat to
make things work. That's love for you!

234
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,213
Right?

235
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:55,451
I've told you the truth.
Be friends with me now, please?

236
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,553
No! Never!

237
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,382
C'mon, Kajal. You promised
to be friends with him

238
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:02,525
If you don't keep your promise,
won't that be cheating too?

239
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:07,059
It's not longer cheating now.
It's part of the system

240
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:12,065
Okay, one last try. If you fulfill
a condition of mine...

241
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,729
I promise to be friends with you.
- I accept. What is it?

242
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,570
Before sunset tomorrow,
meet me at a place...

243
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:26,248
where man goes only with good feelings.
Okay, Mr Raj? Bye

244
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:43,092
Hey Kajal...

245
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:51,103
learn to love those you hate

246
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:56,038
But never hate those
who love you

247
00:27:57,414 --> 00:28:02,716
The world will belong to you.
But please remember...

248
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:05,722
that you mean the world to me

249
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:15,387
We have time till tomorrow evening.
We'll think of a way out, no sweat

250
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,563
Everything will be all right.
C'mon!

251
00:28:19,236 --> 00:28:24,401
Kajal, Raj looks like a good boy.
I could see love for you in his eyes

252
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,609
He really likes you, baby

253
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:30,577
Meeting good and bad people
is mere happenstance

254
00:28:31,114 --> 00:28:33,548
The heart decides who you
fall in love with

255
00:28:34,117 --> 00:28:38,076
But it's destiny that decides who
becomes your life-partner

256
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:43,081
But take it from me.
Raj is your destiny

257
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:48,090
s if you're an astrologer.
- No, not an astrologer...

258
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:51,457
but I'm no less than one.
So watch it!

259
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:01,377
This is tension for me!
With good feelings...

260
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:08,380
nobody goes to hospital, courts,
to crematoriums and graveyards...

261
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:10,553
But what are good feelings?

262
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:17,556
I got to ask Bhavna (feeling, name).
Four Bhavnas in my locality

263
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:22,460
One goes to the club, one to the disco,
one to the garba and one to...

264
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:25,395
I get it! To the temple!

265
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:28,070
Kajal! The temple!

266
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,397
Drive slowly, it scares me. Okay?

267
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:33,575
Got to get to the temple
before sundown, Funsukh-bhai

268
00:29:36,313 --> 00:29:40,079
What are you doing... Hey...
what are you upto?

269
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:43,576
What way of finding a girl is this?
Drive slowly, will you?

270
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,578
Don't be scared, Funsukh-bhai!
- Re you driving a car or an aircraft?

271
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:51,093
Nothing's going to happen.
- Two occasions when man drives like this

272
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:54,086
It's either in an Olympics race or
when the cops are giving him a chase

273
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:58,093
No need for you to race like this.
What way is this...?

274
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,433
We've got to get to the temple
before sunset

275
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:05,596
I'm not in a hurry to die!
The heavens and hell can wait

276
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:10,572
I'll die if you drive like this, okay?
Drive slowly!

277
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:14,514
Here we are, Funsukh-bhai!

278
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:28,594
Bout time, buddy. Go on inside
while I park the car

279
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,087
Before sunset, he's here Kajal

280
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:11,607
Hi Kajal.
- Hi Raj

281
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:18,103
With God as my witness, I seek
your hand in friendship

282
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:26,122
I love you, Kajal

283
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:14,633
"I've seen merican eyes"

284
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:18,105
"I've seen Russian eyes"

285
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:21,610
"I've seen German eyes"

286
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:25,439
"I've seen French eyes"

287
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:30,115
"But the one that took
my breath away..."

288
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,123
"is the girl with
the Punjabi eyes"

289
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:40,619
"The girl with the Punjabi eyes"

290
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:48,632
"I swear it on God,
I swear it on my heart..."

291
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:52,135
"this girl is amazing"

292
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,574
"This girl with the Punjabi eyes"

293
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,119
"With a kiss she gave me a cheque"

294
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,613
"she said I'd find it useful"

295
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:53,068
"Encash it, when you take
my bridal palanquin home"

296
00:33:56,906 --> 00:34:02,071
"How she pierces my heart..."

297
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:06,075
"this girl with the Punjabi eyes"

298
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:21,425
"C'mon, give me the Bhangra beat!
- My handsome lover..."

299
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:26,102
"my love...
- Shake it, baby!"

300
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:30,102
"My handsome lover,
sweep me off my feet"

301
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:56,559
"Those that she casts
her Punjabi eyes on..."

302
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,562
"find themselves in
an ecstatic trance"

303
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:06,064
"I'm the pretty lass
every hero's crazy about"

304
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:23,749
"This girl sure is
a two-edged sword"

305
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:28,257
"This girl with the Punjabi eyes"

306
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:42,611
"I swear it on my heart,
on God..."

307
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:46,110
"you're the one
I'm nuts about"

308
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,618
"I, the girl with the Punjabi eyes"

309
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,582
"The girl with the Punjabi eyes"

310
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:33,425
Hello...?
- Hi dad

311
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,758
Hi, son! So how's Cape Town?

312
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,094
Cape Town's beautiful, dad

313
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:42,098
nd I've even found a beautiful
daughter-in-law for you and Mom

314
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,107
Fantastic! You are amazing, my son!

315
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:48,109
Your son has found
a daughter-in-law for us

316
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,105
Let me talk to him

317
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:53,042
How're you doing, my son?
- I'm enjoying myself, Mom

318
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:56,049
I see. So what's the name
of my future daughter-in-law?

319
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:58,049
Kajal.
- Kajal?

320
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:00,422
She's a great girl, Mom.
Nd she's very beautiful too

321
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,552
Wow! That's a lovely name, my son.
- Give that phone to me!

322
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:09,558
So give me her father's name, son.
I'll quickly finalise the wedding

323
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,068
Her Papa's name is Fakkie Capper.
He lives at Madh Island

324
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:17,399
That's it, son! You could say it's
all arranged! Congratulations!

325
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,575
Thank you, dad! I love you!

326
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,409
Yes, Papa. He's a very nice boy.
- What's his name?

327
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:27,082
Very good.
- Thanks, Papa. Love you!

328
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,053
Someone's here to see you, sir.
- Who is it? Show him in

329
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:22,066
Namaste, Mr Fakkie Capper.
- Good afternoon

330
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:27,575
Yes, Fakkie Capper. No worry,
no tension. Ny problem?

331
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:33,571
Ny doubts?
- No doubts at all. I'm convinced!

332
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,081
The same face, the same build
and the same voice

333
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,429
He looks like the same guy

334
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:53,026
But maybe he's not.
- He looks like it, but maybe he's not?

335
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:57,033
What nonsense are you talking?
- You are not Fakkie Capper

336
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,538
If I'm not Fakkie Capper,
am I a wicketkeeper?

337
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:05,371
No! You're neither a wicketkeeper
nor Fakkie Capper...

338
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:13,551
you're the guy who bought and sold junk!
Fakirchand Kapur of Patiala!

339
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:17,390
What...?
- M I right?

340
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:20,221
I didn't talk in English now.
So tell me!

341
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:25,401
Who told you that?
- Who will tell me?

342
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:30,561
Try and recognise me, Fakira!
I'm Ranjit! The vegetable-vendor!

343
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:36,408
From Patiala!
- My word! My childhood chum!

344
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:43,074
Ranjit! You've changed so much!
I couldn't even recognise you!

345
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,749
Fakire, tell me... how did
Fakirchand turn into Fakkie Capper?

346
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,585
I went to merica from Patiala

347
00:39:50,827 --> 00:39:53,591
nd everyone who goes to merica
changes his name there

348
00:39:53,830 --> 00:40:00,099
Jaikishen becomes Jackson.
Madhavkishan becomes Max

349
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:05,100
I went there as Fakirchand
but came back as Fakkie Capper

350
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:10,608
That's very good!

351
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:22,116
Know what? Change your own name now.
No Ranjeet, no jeet (victory) or loss

352
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:27,629
Make it Ran.
The shorter it is, the better

353
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:32,464
But tell me something.
How did you get here from Patiala?

354
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:36,134
Like you, I came away
to Mumbai from Patiala...

355
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:41,136
and became a very big businessman.
I'm now going to be related to you!

356
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:45,139
Related to me? How come?
I have only two daughters

357
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:48,645
One is already married and the other
one has already chosen her groom

358
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:52,582
His name is Raj.
- I happen to be Raj's father...

359
00:40:54,123 --> 00:40:56,091
and you're Kajal's father!

360
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:59,595
I'm the groom's father,
you're the bride's old man...

361
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:04,092
aren't we related then?
- Forget about everything else...

362
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:09,598
and start preparing for the engagement!
Give me a hug, my dear relative!

363
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,438
So c'mon Fakirchand!
- No, no...

364
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:18,605
Mr Ran, I'm not Fakirchand anymore.
The name is...

365
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:24,449
say Fakkie...
- Fakkie...

366
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:28,123
Capper! Fakkie Capper!

367
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,461
We're related now!

368
00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:52,612
You know...?
- I know

369
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:58,084
Shut up! Raj, my Papa knows...
- My dad knows...

370
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:01,086
My Papa knows your dad

371
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:03,425
They're childhood...
- Friends

372
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,754
Is this coincidence or destiny?
- Of course, it's destiny

373
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:11,592
Thank God! Now you believe in destiny.
- Yes

374
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:15,097
Raj, what style of romance
do you really dig?

375
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:19,439
Western? Or Indian?
- God! Indian style...?

376
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:23,600
Romancing Indian style is
terribly long and boring

377
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:27,441
Woo a girl, she feels shy,
looks down...

378
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,110
and runs away in the end.
- No, no. No more

379
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,446
That's not how Indian girls now are.
They're no more shy

380
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,457
C'mon! Try touching them before
marriage and they shake off your hand

381
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:42,453
Try to get closer
and they push you away

382
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:45,133
You are also the same

383
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:49,126
Know what? I love romance
Western-style

384
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:53,075
"Hi Babe, I'm Raj.
You wanna be friends?"

385
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:58,072
She says, of course.
Fter that, it's so easy

386
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:02,573
The guy gives her a tight hug.
The girl does not protest

387
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:06,584
He plays with her hair,
she still doesn't say a word

388
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:12,086
He then moves closer to kiss her...
and she still says nothing

389
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:22,437
Raj! Great news!
- What?

390
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:31,102
Your parents and mine have fixed our
engagement on ugust 9, my birthday!

391
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:37,615
There'll be a lavish party at
the Grand Maratha Sheraton

392
00:43:38,654 --> 00:43:41,452
So you have it worked out, don't you?
Let's go back to India!

393
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:46,125
Their love-story is all tied up.
Do something about us now...

394
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,627
how long will I go around like this?
- My dad's an army General

395
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:52,393
He'll fire a cannon at you.
- God! The only General in India...

396
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:56,059
who carries a cannon on his shoulder!
"Look at my cannon..."

397
00:43:56,272 --> 00:44:00,572
"I'll blow away the guy who casts
a look at my daughter. Look, a cannon!"

398
00:44:01,444 --> 00:44:03,207
Hi Funsukh!

399
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:11,075
"I've found him"

400
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:14,412
"I'm all shaken up"

401
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:20,584
"I've found him at last.
Found him, found him"

402
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,102
No cannon, that's a missile!

403
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:33,606
Funsukh, where haven't I followed you
for the sake of your love?

404
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:36,607
Nd when I came here,
you made a fool out of me?

405
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,188
But now, I've found someone too

406
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:52,587
nd now... I love him!
I love him!

407
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:55,059
Found someone?

408
00:44:55,464 --> 00:45:01,061
God, if she has really found
someone... thanks so much to You!

409
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:06,207
Sam, my love,
darling... c'mon!

410
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:17,585
My love...

411
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,080
I've escaped!
Narrow escape!

412
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:27,425
Won't you congratulate Sam?
- Why not?

413
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:31,093
Congrats, Sam. Congratulations.
- Thanks, thank you

414
00:45:32,134 --> 00:45:36,594
Funsukh, won't you congratulate Sam?
- I will! Congratulations

415
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:41,768
Leave me alone! Let go!

416
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:46,445
You've hurt my darling so much.
You're not a good man

417
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:50,651
Not a good man.
- I'm sorry... leave my hand

418
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:58,386
He's a beefy bull!
- If Sam divorces me...

419
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,720
where will I go?
- Where?

420
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:06,559
I'll rush to you.
- Take her away... go on

421
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,737
Congratulations.
God bless you

422
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:17,401
"To her husband's house
goes the pretty bride..."

423
00:46:17,847 --> 00:46:23,080
"You have no idea, mister,
the trouble you're in for"

424
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:40,098
"I'm the treasure
lost in love..."

425
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:49,434
"I'm the era
that has gone by"

426
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:58,047
"Even joys mourn my sorrow..."

427
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:06,558
"alas! What a sordid saga I am"

428
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:11,061
"I'm nothing but a saga"

429
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:36,590
"My life has been
snatched away from me..."

430
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:41,085
"what anguish has been
unleashed on my heart?"

431
00:47:55,711 --> 00:48:00,045
"Either call me to Yourself..."

432
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:04,546
"or blow the world asunder"

433
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:08,545
"I seek nothing else
from anyone..."

434
00:48:09,091 --> 00:48:13,551
"just call me over, Lord..."

435
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:18,392
"unite me with my lover"

436
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:14,550
"Life and death
are not in my hands..."

437
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:19,283
"what mystery is life all about?"

438
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:23,727
"I'm lonely,
I suffer in silence..."

439
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:28,729
"and she suffers
all alone too"

440
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:34,569
"I shall severe my ties with
the world to come to you..."

441
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:38,577
"I shall forsake the world
to join you..."

442
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:42,681
"I seek nothing else
from anyone"

443
00:49:42,885 --> 00:49:47,584
"just call me over, Lord..."

444
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:52,093
"unite me with my beloved"

445
00:49:52,628 --> 00:49:56,587
"Summon me, my Lord..."

446
00:49:57,299 --> 00:50:01,759
"for I wish to see my beloved"

447
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:41,636
"To hearts, You gave love..."

448
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:46,477
"and then ordained
separation for us"

449
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:51,152
"How shall I complain,
what shall I say...?"

450
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,752
"How shall I say
anything against You?"

451
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:01,085
"Thou art the One that
adds colour to all creation..."

452
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:06,097
"thou art the One that creates
pearls in oysters..."

453
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:10,098
"I seek nothing from anyone else..."

454
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:14,639
"just call me over, Lord..."

455
00:51:15,144 --> 00:51:19,444
"unite me with my beloved"

456
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:34,122
"My life has been
snatched away from me..."

457
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:38,632
"what anguish has been
unleashed on my heart?"

458
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:43,461
"Either call me to Yourself..."

459
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,802
"or blow the world asunder"

460
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:52,406
"I seek nothing else
from anyone..."

461
00:51:52,648 --> 00:51:57,085
"just call me over, Lord..."

462
00:51:57,286 --> 00:52:01,746
"bring my beloved together with me"

463
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:24,606
"Love - the melody of the heart.
"Love - the secret of the heart"

464
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:29,111
"It's hearts that love;
that's the one thing hearts do"

465
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:40,691
"You and I are, because love is.
The world is, for love is"

466
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:45,128
"Those in love
have only to love"

467
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:50,138
"Call me over, Lord..."

468
00:52:50,439 --> 00:52:54,569
"unite me with my beloved"

469
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:17,758
What is it?

470
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:27,775
So I got to live on?

471
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:31,446
I want to die,
but You won't let me die

472
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:35,283
I wish life and death
were not in Your hands

473
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:38,881
Nice way of bullying us

474
00:53:40,155 --> 00:53:44,455
Do not be angry.
There is a reason why you live...

475
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,126
there is a mission.
Have faith in me...

476
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:55,235
I'm there for you.
I am here

477
00:54:01,643 --> 00:54:05,079
Handed me an assurance again?
"I'm there for you"

478
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:12,083
What did I ask for?
Life...? You snatched it away

479
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:15,583
nd when I asked for death,
You didn't give it to me

480
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:21,088
I sought nothing else.
But here You are, that too...

481
00:54:23,632 --> 00:54:27,591
at 3:30 in the morning?
Please go to sleep...

482
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:32,100
and let me sleep.
Good night, okay?

483
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:40,240
God, there's nothing
like privacy anymore

484
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:46,117
What if I were sleeping in the nude?
This is too much

485
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,459
Nimmi, come on!
Coming...

486
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:56,397
Yes, I'm just waiting for her. Nimmi!
- Coming

487
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:01,061
What now?

488
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:10,445
I'm coming, the parking
is on the other side

489
00:55:36,138 --> 00:55:38,106
Oh my God! Kajal...?

490
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,105
Excuse me...

491
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:54,555
Thanks for saving my life

492
00:55:56,091 --> 00:56:00,551
Thank Him, not me.
Better see the writing on the wall

493
00:56:01,263 --> 00:56:04,562
Like all happiness is linked to sorrow.
Everybody's life is, to somebody's death

494
00:56:06,568 --> 00:56:11,062
People in India aren't doing things
right, so He's taken over the reins

495
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,068
Everything's happening smoothly now

496
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:19,208
What now...?

497
00:56:30,459 --> 00:56:32,086
Where do you live?
- Bandra

498
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:34,588
lt'll take you half an hour to
get home in Bombay's traffic

499
00:56:35,397 --> 00:56:38,594
If you hate your father, don't go home.
Get on with your shopping

500
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,599
But if you love him,
go home immediately...

501
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:46,096
seek his forgiveness for your mistakes.
Love him, serve him as best as you can

502
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:53,206
Because he will be no more
after nine tonight

503
00:56:53,548 --> 00:56:57,040
What?
- Look, I have nothing to do with that

504
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,519
Forgive me for what I said.
Hail a rickshaw and hurry home

505
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:06,056
Kajal, what rubbish are
you falling for?

506
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:09,526
He's a madman!
- No Nimmi. He's not a madman

507
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:12,062
How did he know this accident
was going to take place?

508
00:57:12,534 --> 00:57:15,560
C'mon, it's just a coincidence!
Forget it!

509
00:57:16,438 --> 00:57:18,406
Today's such a joyous day!

510
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:22,270
It's your birthday and your
engagement... c'mon now!

511
00:57:28,884 --> 00:57:31,409
Sanjana hasn't yet arrived.
I told her to be here

512
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:34,622
Kajal, my child...
- Hello, Doctor Uncle

513
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:39,088
Doctor Uncle, is Papa all right?
- Of course, he's fine

514
00:57:39,294 --> 00:57:41,762
I checked his reports yesterday.
There's nothing wrong with him

515
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:45,466
He's fit and healthy. Enjoy.
- Thank you

516
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:48,559
See? He's fit and fine

517
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,038
Kajal! What are you mulling over?
- Nothing

518
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:05,712
I know... you're thinking about
what that guy said, isn't it?

519
00:58:06,555 --> 00:58:09,046
Look... how happy your Papa is

520
00:58:10,425 --> 00:58:13,553
He was a nut. So just forget it.
Be happy

521
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:20,061
This girl told her boyfriend,
"I'm pregnant"

522
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:25,539
He said, "How come?
I haven't even touched you!"

523
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,536
She said, "No sweat.
I'm marrying your father tomorrow"

524
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:34,074
C'mon, let's take photographs.
- Let's go

525
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:41,081
Kajal! You look so ravishing!

526
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:48,422
I say, apply a black-charm on your
cheek. You might attract the evil eye!

527
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:06,040
Where are you going, Kajal?
- Papa's looking very good today

528
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:12,717
To save him from the evil eye, I'm
going to apply a black-charm on him

529
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,217
Papa...

530
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:36,403
It's okay, Papa.
- I'm so sorry, my child!

531
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:41,579
Let's celebrate your birthday now.
C'mon Ranjit, doctor...

532
00:59:41,783 --> 00:59:44,251
let's go and celebrate the birthday.
C'mon, everybody!

533
01:00:00,669 --> 01:00:05,106
Ladies and gentlemen, today
I have a very important...

534
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,599
and a very pleasant announcement
to make

535
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:16,448
My close friend Ranjit and I are going
to turn our friendship into family ties!

536
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:25,456
Friends, my son Raj and Kajal
will be engaged right now

537
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:29,627
nd in exactly 3 months,
the wedding will take place!

538
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:33,132
Nd there'll also be a grand party
for all of us!

539
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:51,151
My son... congratulations

540
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:54,522
God bless you, my child

541
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:59,616
ren't they made for each other?
- Of course

542
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:05,095
Congratulations.
- Thanks, sister

543
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,425
Come to me, my children.
- Papa...

544
01:01:10,338 --> 01:01:14,604
Raj, I have given Kajal
the love of a mother

545
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:20,607
Give her so much of love
that she forgets even her Papa

546
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:42,136
Papa...

547
01:01:43,972 --> 01:01:45,633
Doctor Uncle!

548
01:01:45,774 --> 01:01:47,639
Look what's with Papa...

549
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:12,528
I'm sorry, he's no more

550
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:20,000
Your dad will be no more
after nine tonight
