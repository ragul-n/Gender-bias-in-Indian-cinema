1
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,984
In pursuit of dreams,
I run even today

2
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,791
My desires remain far, far away

3
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:41,561
In search of dreams we run on and on

4
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,431
Do we see them?

5
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,832
Do we perceive?

6
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,660
In pursuit of dreams,
I run even today

7
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,394
My desires remain far, far away

8
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,029
In search of dreams we run on and on

9
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,834
Do we see them?

10
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,807
Do we perceive?

11
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,932
In pursuit of dreams,
I run even today

12
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,866
My desires remain far, far away

13
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,635
In search of dreams we run on and on

14
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,506
Do we see them?

15
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,442
Do we perceive?

16
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,215
Christ's Grace

17
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,693
Jesus protects this house

18
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,036
Oh Lord!

19
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,572
Has she returned so quickly?
Chey!

20
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,145
Alleluia!

21
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,854
Good morning sir

22
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:18,818
Yes?

23
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:24,129
l am from Murdoch marketing company
with some products for the kitchen

24
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,186
- Look here
- Sir?

25
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,993
The only 'product' of my kitchen
has gone for her driving lessons

26
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,934
lf she sees me here with you
l may as well join a meditation camp

27
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,129
You can go

28
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,907
- Sir?
-Aiyo! Sh...!

29
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,938
What is it, dear?

30
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,971
lchaya(hubby), Lucy speaking
5 minutes more and l am done

31
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,311
What are you up to?

32
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,177
l...er...am watching
Shalom (Christian) channel on TV

33
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,885
By the way, l'll be back after
shopping at the supermarket

34
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,888
Jesus! Does that mean
you'll be here only after 2 hours?

35
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,222
- Yes, lchaya
- Chey!

36
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,889
Listen! Wait till l return
before you go out, okay?

37
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,293
Come quickly, okay?

38
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,295
- Heard me?
- Okay, lchaya

39
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,067
- So, you are from home appliances, eh?
- Yes sir

40
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,108
Well, come in
Let me have a look

41
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,578
- Sir, casserole?
- No

42
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,814
Sir, if you are really interested
l have a small side business too

43
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,351
CDs of some new movies
Only Rs 100

44
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,285
- ls that so?
- Yes

45
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,787
Where? Let me see

46
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,818
Sir, are you a businessman?

47
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,622
No, in the police force

48
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,060
Deputy Superintendent of Police
Benny Tharakan

49
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,265
Selling pirated movie CDs
is your business, eh?

50
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,062
Sir?!

51
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,140
Be quiet! So convenient
coming in with evidence, like this

52
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,832
Non-bailable offence, understood?

53
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,004
Please don't betray me, sir
l desperately need the money

54
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,742
Please sir
l'll do anything you ask me to

55
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,146
Do have only movie CDs?
lsn't there any other kind?

56
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,681
Other kind?

57
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,020
Don't you have adult movies?

58
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,162
Yes or no?

59
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:06,861
Take it out

60
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,434
Wait here

61
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,438
Let me find out first
whetherto send you off or not

62
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,701
Aiyo! lsn't that me?

63
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,332
Christ! lt's me!

64
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:55,945
You!!!

65
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,759
Reporter, Bharath Vision

66
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,795
Jesus!

67
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,027
My dear sister,
don't get me into trouble

68
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,965
l've just got back into service
After 2 suspensions and 2 meditations

69
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,342
Please, l'll do
whatever you want me to

70
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,936
Sir, answer that call
Must be from the TV channel

71
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,147
Hello?

72
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,275
Venu, that's my name

73
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,416
A well known camera man
of a well known TV channel

74
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,053
l know you, sir
l've met you

75
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,786
- So, further introductions not needed
- Not at all

76
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,396
lf prime time
news today decides to air...

77
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,490
...your antics with that chick
what will be your opinion?

78
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:52,903
Aiyo! l no longer will exist
Tell me sir, what should l do?

79
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:02,742
Rs 3 lakhs, in notes of 1000
Send it with that girl

80
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:03,538
Okay, sir

81
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,348
Okay

82
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,221
Why has no one taken this?

83
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,385
We don't want any lOUs, sir
Just give us our salary

84
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,292
This is not an lOU
Just a security

85
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,854
Look, only 2 minutes left
Go and begin the news telecast

86
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,126
By then the money will be here

87
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,964
Money that's not come since 4 months
do you think will come in half an hour?

88
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,162
On its way

89
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,203
Then l'll read the news
after it arrives

90
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,435
Or you do it yourself, after all
you were a lion in Bharath Vision, right?

91
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,509
Yes dude, l was indeed, a lion

92
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,100
When l started my own channel
l became a cat

93
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,872
Okay, don't read, you pig
l'll do it, give me that coat

94
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,538
No need to remove the coat
l got the money

95
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,550
Here, Rs 3 lakhs

96
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,813
Did you see how we got the money?

97
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,122
Here's Rs 3 lakhs, take your dues
lf anything's left, leave it there itself

98
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,529
Bro, l have to go read news
Please keep my 40 aside

99
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,793
Brother, where's mine?

100
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,234
A Bharath Vision lD card?
Are you back with that channel?

101
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,603
l went for an 'operation', dear
My old card came of use, that's all

102
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,273
Stop your chatter
Come with me

103
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,405
Were you going to explain
all that happened, to them?

104
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,016
You can as well air it on news time!
Let everybody here be aware!

105
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,246
Great! Remember the way
you followed ethics so strictly?

106
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,390
When it didn't work, you quit
Bharath Vision to start a new channel

107
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,461
As the head, you are resorting
to 3rd rate tactics, to pay the salaries...

108
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,129
...and that too mimicking
a decent guy, like Venu sir

109
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,329
Go and tell Venu everything!
You can get married to my dead body

110
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,403
He'll kill me!

111
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,105
l've not made it a habit, right?
This was only the first time

112
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,904
Sir?

113
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,004
What is it?

114
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,845
Minister Kunjumoideen will land at 1 :00 PM
None of us will be there to coverthe event

115
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,316
Select some good channel
and just reproduce their content

116
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,579
lsn't that what we do every time!

117
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,451
Hey! Also include an 'it seems'
in every other sentence

118
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,421
What's that sir?

119
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,323
Like...the Minister is involved in
the sex racket case 'it seems'

120
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
Or...there is a chance
he'll resign 'it seems'

121
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,632
Like this, we include 'it seems'
in all matters, we are not sure of

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,659
Understood?

123
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,162
- Yes, now l do
- Then go

124
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,600
What a big media star you were
Rs 1 .5 lakh salary and...

125
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,276
...post of chief operating officer
What went wrong at Bharath vision?

126
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,647
Conceit! l have only myself to blame
A kind of smugness, dying to be pricked!

127
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,216
Oh Lord!
lt's Venu!

128
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,559
Would he have somehow
come to know what l did?

129
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,255
Aiyo! Would Benny Tharakan
have talked to him, about it?

130
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,592
Will the Town Hall
be free tomorrow?

131
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,529
Why?

132
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,394
To keep my dead body
for public viewing

133
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,966
Hello?
What's up dude?

134
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,507
ls it?
He doesn't know!

135
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,106
Aren't you ashamed
to go cover a silly 'lathi charge'?

136
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,011
Oh, you call itjust time pass, eh?
Definitely not! You are itching for kudos!

137
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:57,112
Returning from Delhi after 5 years
just a cheap trick to say you are back

138
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,348
Ow!
He's swearing!!

139
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,561
He can't be idle even for a day
without taking up some work

140
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,096
Probably needs the money

141
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,131
He?

142
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,528
The money he earns for
each assignment of Reuters and CNN...

143
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,109
...no camera man would get
even after 3 or 4 years of toil

144
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,972
When sensitive issues crop up
channels in Delhi bid for his services

145
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,106
4 lnternational awards
including the Rory Peck Award

146
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,739
This is not for money
Just to show off, that's all!

147
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,109
For which channel could it be?

148
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,745
Certainly not, for Bharath Vision

149
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,332
Look here Suraj
Renuka Ma'am has come

150
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,970
lf you confront her,
you'll need to look out for another job

151
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,132
Her attitude is
'Just take a leap if you cannot'

152
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,507
l will take it up, not with her
but with CEO Vijayakumar sir

153
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,512
She separated me and my wife allotting
different shifts without a word to us

154
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,643
My shift is from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM
and hers, from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM

155
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,654
l have been gazing at stars
the whole of last month

156
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,054
- Be quiet, dude
- Get lost, buddy

157
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:11,253
When she joined as junior reporter
l was already here, as sub-editor

158
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,593
Now she claims
to be executive editor!

159
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,563
Arun, come here

160
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,335
On the run down, first item should be
Minister Kunjumoideen and sex racket

161
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,302
The women's activist Sharada
and the retired old DySP Ramarajan

162
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,034
l want both of them on phone
connected to me, right time

163
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,211
lf you come up with stories like unable
to connect, and so on, l'll blast you!

164
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,083
- Revathi?
- Ma'am

165
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,399
Greetings, I am Renuka
The news, headIines

166
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,131
Minister Kunjumoideen has aIso been
impIicated in Vadakara sex racket case...

167
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,672
...says retired DySPRamarajan

168
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:59,302
In Kuttikanam adivasi zone,
Land mafia faked 420 documents

169
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,606
The news in detaiI

170
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,205
Minister Kunjumoideen's part in the case
is now a topic of controversy

171
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:10,721
The girI who'd been harassed had named
the minister too in her originaI statement

172
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,623
This cIaim by DySP Ramarajan, the officer
who was investigating the case then...

173
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,593
...has sparked off
these fresh controversies

174
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,522
Arun, didn't you get connection?

175
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,157
l am trying, but not getting through

176
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,235
You'll get it from me
if you don't get it, right now

177
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,769
Get lost from here
if you can't, dude!

178
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,171
The minister who was in Delhi
since the Iast 4 days, wiII be here...

179
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,680
...in Nedumbashery airport
by afternoon...is the latest report

180
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,516
Sir may I?

181
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,481
Yes

182
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,115
What's it, dude?

183
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,248
l have a complaint

184
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,484
You or your wife?

185
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,390
So this game was
with your approval, eh?

186
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,859
Dude, I'll know even
if a leaf moves in this place

187
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,564
Sir, it's been a month
since anything moved at all!

188
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,895
Sorry, she takes the decisions

189
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,103
She can, but she'll have
to bear my mother's curse

190
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,672
What's your mother's role in this?

191
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,765
Mother wants to die, only after
she sees her grand child

192
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,868
That's being greedy, isn't it?
Didn't she get to see you, as a baby?

193
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,540
- Look here sir
- lf you want to change shifts, go ask her

194
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,549
ls she Goddess of Chottanikkara
to bow and beg favors from?

195
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,742
Go and ask her directly, useless!

196
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,116
Why use me to test
your sharp tongue?

197
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,385
- Sir, can you help?
- No!

198
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,184
Oh, there she is!
The she-devil!

199
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,595
We don't pay a salary for
couples to coochy-coo during work

200
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,326
There's no question
of changing the shift time

201
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,131
May be, on humanitarian
considerations...?

202
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,800
l don't see such considerations
when you force TAM rating on me

203
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,397
Do you think l am a machine?

204
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,410
l've lost out an entire life!
Don't forget that!

205
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:44,848
Hello?

206
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:46,649
Is it?

207
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,349
Did you see?
No, I will come

208
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,412
Sir

209
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,619
The minister is in the guest house,
women activists and party members too

210
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,856
We can expect something hot
You take over the news, I'll come 'live'

211
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,963
Did you see that enthusiasm?
Focus channel got Venu to shoot for them

212
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,496
You mean Reuter's Venu?

213
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,436
Here?

214
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:11,872
He's come from Delhi and is here
since a week, to testify on some old case

215
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,872
Must have accepted this job
having free time on his hands

216
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,707
Oh Lord! In today's lathi charge
once, just one beating...

217
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,287
...may this queen of Jhansi
receive on her head, please God!

218
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,687
- What's it, dude?
- Nothing, sir

219
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,839
- Preetha, did you see Venu sir?
- ls Reuters Venu covering this?

220
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:53,715
- Why is he here, for this lifeless story?
- Our Vice President requested him, come

221
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,409
Where the heck is this man?!

222
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,455
Must be hanging around somewhere

223
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,257
The Minister will soon be here

224
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,658
Nothing will happen
till l get out of here

225
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,427
We cannot be too sure, sir

226
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,998
Your own party members
will stir up problems

227
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,801
That's also part of politics
Creating and solving problems

228
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,741
You guys need your guns and lathis
l need to use my tongue, just watch

229
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,058
Don't get excited

230
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,319
Stop your slogans

231
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,260
Stop!
Stop, I say

232
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,496
Stop, l say
Don't you understand?

233
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,632
l have only respect
for the women folk of this land

234
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,573
Listen to what I have to say...

235
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:56,012
...after which you can shout
dissent or block my way! Please!

236
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,407
Please...please...please!

237
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,949
Okay, stop
Let him say his piece

238
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,291
Don't bother asking me
I will tell you everything

239
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:11,727
All this hullaballoo is simply because of
the statement of a retd DySP, 6 years later

240
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:16,491
Let the police investigate
I am prepared to co operate

241
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,532
Do you want me to step down
during the period of investigation?

242
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,370
Let my party or chief minister demand
I am prepared for that also

243
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,068
To counter a false accusation
What more should l do?

244
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,514
How is it?

245
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,014
Enough?

246
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,955
Mohammed, what is
the schedule for this evening?

247
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,828
Renu, don't try to barge in
He subdued everyone with just 4 sentences

248
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,591
Don't think you can play around
with this news, the whole day today

249
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,600
Chey! l came because l heard
Venu was covering this for Focus TV

250
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,728
You can expect
fireworks when he's around

251
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,939
Move aside all of you

252
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:56,999
Move!

253
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,581
See you later

254
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,352
Move

255
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,499
Come on finish off
all these sons of guns!!!

256
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,433
Charge!

257
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,685
Get lost you!

258
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,825
Start the car

259
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,012
See that shoe
and that bare foot

260
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,671
- Shoot both, dude!
- Okay

261
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,657
Da!

262
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,461
You are totally useless
Get lost, you...!

263
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,060
Sorry, ma'am

264
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,546
Venu sir?

265
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,279
There won't be any more
further issues, will there?

266
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,109
What?

267
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,584
l mean the other one?

268
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,851
Did he see me throwing my shoe?

269
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,991
Well, if he did, let him!

270
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,133
- Here, go and serve it
- Thank you, sir

271
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,036
TaIking diplomatically and calmly
the event passed off uneventfuIIy

272
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:45,201
But someone threw a shoe at him
and party members turned vioIent

273
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,040
Chey! Who could it be?

274
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,217
Did you see the rhythm
in those shots?

275
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,584
Oh!

276
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:13,703
One second, turning on a single leg
a180degree pan, a shot with amazing impact!

277
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,840
Wouldn't you have got it
using both legs for 2 seconds?

278
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,269
Sure you will

279
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,915
But it can be shown only in your cheap,
crappy, sub standard channel

280
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,246
All good channels
will cut them, edit them

281
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,116
Whatever l shoot, will not
give them a chance to edit

282
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,813
- Oh! For sure
- Look there, my boy

283
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,917
Chey! They chopped
the scenes, those vagabonds!

284
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,696
Smart boys don't
need an excuse to edit

285
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,856
Yes, Venu here

286
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,229
I came, created an issue
and shot those scenes for you

287
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,637
Now, using my footage, you are
teaching your boys editing, eh?

288
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,675
Rascals! With no sense
about rules of continuity!

289
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,072
What? Sorry?

290
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,875
You can stuff your sorry
under your leg...arms...

291
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,571
...I'll take it when l need it!

292
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,688
What is it, dude?
Giggling away to glory,eh?

293
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,223
Twin screen play writers
What the heck do you know?

294
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,285
Venu, they are my friends
They have 5 super hit films to their credit

295
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,160
They've come here for my sake
To discuss a program for my NBI Channel

296
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,325
lf you have anything to say
direct it at me, not them

297
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,663
I will tell this not only
to you, but to them also

298
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,227
I didn't jump up from the middle
of my dinner, to wield a camera

299
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:24,139
As a gold medalist from film institute
I refused to step into the film world...why?

300
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,801
My ambition was to shoot visuals
that were authentic, not manipulated

301
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,842
Understood?

302
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,080
Humph!
Cinema my foot!

303
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,178
Looks like, a gas bag
sprouted hands and legs!

304
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,055
Like army stories narrated by
tea shop owners with big moustaches

305
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,127
Sure! Army stories indeed

306
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,389
Kargil war! Who covered it
for the Defense Ministry?

307
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,358
Him

308
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,363
The terrorist attack
at the Taj hotel, Mumbai

309
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,969
Who covered the commando
operation for CNN channel?

310
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,064
Was it Azhagappan?

311
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,102
Not azhag-appan
Your appan (dad)!

312
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,040
Very good

313
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,076
Oh, it was you, sir?

314
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:08,847
ls he in?

315
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,114
Sure, come in

316
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,988
Venu, look who's here

317
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,084
Hey, Somarajan sir?

318
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,019
When l called
Rishi said you were here

319
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,824
Don't worry, I won't
stay for long and trouble you

320
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,068
So my perjury,
led to something good

321
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,438
Yes, l got the fax today
My lPS is confirmed

322
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,811
lt was only for you
l've surfaced here after 5 years

323
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,046
Just to change
my earlier statement

324
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:37,479
Thanks

325
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,148
Thank you

326
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:45,154
When l packed up and left
l swore l wouldn't return

327
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,689
But my return has resulted
in something good!

328
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,883
Don't you know him?

329
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,426
Superintendent of Police
Somarajan sir of Special branch

330
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,158
- Was suspended for a brief period
- Along with a criminal case

331
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,733
He was the defendant
and I was the petitioner

332
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,335
News continues

333
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,235

Did the vehicle, for a second
slip into reverse gear?

339
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,818
This vehicle does not have a reverse gear
It can only take an U-turn, if you want

340
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,528
Venu
Come on, take an U-turn

341
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,960
Anyway these guys
don't know anything

342
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,431
What if there's scope for a story?

343
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,369
- Should I?
- Go ahead

344
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:34,998
Sir

345
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,038
Please, sir

346
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,015
About 5 years ago...

347
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,983
After nearly 7 days of fasting
and in very poor health conditions...

348
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,019
...sociaI activist and poetess Radhadevi
has been arrested and admitted in hospital

349
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,565
Demanding immediate soIution
to the Chambakara issue...

350
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,534
...Radhadevi announced soIidarity with
the citizens protest and started her fast

351
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,435
Venu sir has come!

352
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,400
Did you get it, sir?
The police refuse to allow us in

353
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,909
Here's the Commissioner's permission

354
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,446
lf she's conscious after an hour
and cooperates, take her interview also

355
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,846
- Let's go to the casualty
- Me?

356
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,983
You want me to shoot
this lifeless interview?

357
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,815
To just focus on her mug
watch it and die of boredom?

358
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,185
Get lost, dude!
Go do it yourself

359
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,417
Sir, the permission
is in your name, Reuters Venu

360
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,015
lf you are not there
the police will block our entry

361
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,321
You can go after it begins

362
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,292
You arejust harassing me

363
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:33,856
Come!

364
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,897
lmpossible!

365
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,799
lt's not for an interview
We must tell the public about her condition

366
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,996
Didn't I tell you
that you can't meet her?

367
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,060
Why not?

368
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,196
Not possible, that's all

369
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,399
Let me see if l can

370
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,172
Who is this fiery maiden?

371
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,302
Renuka, junior reporter of Bharath vision

372
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,539
A beginner's enthusiasm

373
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:52,507
- l must see how you will
- Let me go

374
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,142
You useless, behaving atrociously, eh?

375
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:55,946
You...!

376
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,952
Hey, that was great

377
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,082
You arrogant girl!

378
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,355
You! You dare lay
hands on a policewoman

379
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,400
You fool! Aren't lady-police
assigned to deal with women?

380
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,061
Why do you interfere?

381
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,935
Throw him into the police van, the dog

382
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,443
You dare to lay hands
on media persons, you pig?!

383
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,447
Let me go
Kill him, this son of a gun

384
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,419
- That's Venu sir
- You mean, Reuters Venu?

385
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,380
Sir

386
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:03,947
And then?

387
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:04,946
What?

388
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,917
You saw DySP Somarajan
pushing away the reporter Renuka

389
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:09,684
And then?

390
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,593
Very calmly and
full of respect, l asked him

391
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:20,670
Sir, is it right to do such things
to a girl, that too, to a media person

392
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,573
He said who are you
to ask me such...come here

393
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,578
And gave me a slap

394
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:33,016
And a kick here...here on my chest

395
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,018
l don't remember anything else

396
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,520
Note it down

397
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,022
The certificate is ready
You go and take that

398
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,423
How are you?
Are you in pain?

399
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,125
Sure, l'm covered by insurance

400
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,525
He asked, if you are in pain

401
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,660
- What?
- Pain

402
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,133
Pain, yes it is paining
This thing blocks and l'm unable to hear

403
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,938
Removing that is not going to help
He'll never be able to hear again

404
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,983
l hope there is nothing
seriously wrong, doctor

405
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,727
Ear drum is totally damaged
He'll have to use a hearing aid

406
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,755
Explain it to him gently

407
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:22,690
Okay?

408
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,237
Look here, just take it easy

409
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,167
What?

410
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:39,016
Don't get agitated
You'll be a little upset on hearing this

411
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,745
But how can l tell you this,
in any other way...?

412
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,047
Doctorjust said...

413
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,216
What's this, dude?
Like some melodrama in cinema

414
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,156
With broken words, it is cancer
lts blood cancer, brother...

415
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,525
Tell me whatever it is
you dumb fellow!

416
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,426
l'm not dumb
You are the one now, deaf

417
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,997
Your ear is gone forever, dude

418
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,336
Hereafter, we must fix that thingy
A hearing aid, that's what l meant

419
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,543
So, this is a goner!

420
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:21,049
Once, the artist Van Gogh
chopped his ear off, for his lady love

421
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,087
My dear girl, l've just lost it for you
without love or any such moonshine

422
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,595
Be grateful, okay?
Gratitude

423
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,701
- That thing which you said...
- Gratitude?

424
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,565
No, this love

425
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,704
lt can happen even now and
everything will fall in place

426
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,172
- Will that happen?
- lt's already too late

427
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,640
- Then go get a taxi
- Okay

428
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,199
Get lost, dude and
stop weaving stories

429
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,204
Venu!

430
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,529
My God! You should have
seen them after that incident

431
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:05,759
lt wasn't love,
they just took off on a high!

432
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,841
l, was the reason forthat love to begin
Since l am not there in the rest of the story

433
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,870
l'll say, okay good night

434
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,277
Good night

435
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:18,714
And then?

436
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,551
And then...

437
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,325
Where were you?

438
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,461
The press meet is about
to begin, I'll call you back

439
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,129
Hey, it's urgent
lt's an exclusive

440
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,429
Needs to be
shot immediately

441
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,370
What is it about?

442
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,236
I'll explain
Come quickly

443
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,139
I am waiting outside

444
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,272
Monacha, I've got
an exclusive, l'm leaving

445
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,336
Shouldn't I come
to cover the event?

446
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:56,685
This is being covered by Venu sir
Reuters Venu, accompanied by, Renuka

447
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,486
Come, get in

448
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,253
- What is so exclusive?
- l'll tell you everything

449
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,334
Which is this place?

450
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,935
Guest house of Kelvin Joseph

451
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,766
He is the guy who is
funding Rishi's new channel

452
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,171
Didn't you say
we have something exclusive?

453
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,237
Yes, there is no one else here
Only 2 of us, exclusive literally, come

454
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,916
- Come on, I say
- Venu

455
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,349
Let me go

456
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:34,452
Come

457
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,819
What are your intentions?

458
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,556
Dishonorable ones, of course!

459
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,221
Sure! Go climb a wall!

460
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,790
Oh! That!

461
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,771
No! Please no...not before marriage

462
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,331
lsn't that what you mean?
Well, l have no such inclinations

463
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,369
Then?

464
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,773
Why that disappointed
expression, when l said that?

465
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,643
Aiyada! Disappointment!

466
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,576
Do you know to cook?

467
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,451
- Sure, to an extent
- Okay

468
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,480
- Where's the kitchen?
- Over there

469
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,259
What do you prefer?
Tea or coffee?

470
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,352
Before that, by the way
have you heard my song?

471
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,589
Song?

472
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,358
Music track, karaoke

473
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:19,561
ln our future lives, very frequently
we have to face 2 gigantic issues

474
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,662
Your cooking and my music!

475
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,771
Let's begin our interaction
from that point

476
00:32:55,006 --> 00:33:00,410
As rays of the fading evening sun,
Iay sprawIed on the shores unrestrained

477
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:05,745
Swinging your littIe tender arms, dear
On a littIe boat you rowed, my baby dear

478
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:11,420
Tear drops never fell but brimmed
Eyes that glistened with tears unshed

479
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:16,391
Memories, like a wick of lamp burning
not feeling the heat of the flame brightening

480
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:21,659
Oh, why did you Ieave me and go
My sweet littIe chirpy red sparrow

481
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:26,965
I wait on these shores for you on and on
My desires like roots spread far and yon

482
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:32,475
As rays of the fading evening sun,
Iay sprawled on the shores unshackled

483
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:38,277
Swinging your tender littIe arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

484
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:53,762
As the wheels of time and age
Turned around on earth's heritage

485
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:59,064
As flowering trees and young LaureI
grew and changed beyond recaII

486
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:04,365
As before my eyes this littIe stream
faded out of sight, never to be seen

487
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:09,742
I turned into a golden sand boat
that didn't have water to go afIoat

488
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:15,012
lAs rays of the fading evening sun,
lay sprawled on the shores uncontrolled

489
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:20,614
Swinging your tender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

490
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:41,841
Adorned in anklets on feet so pretty
Bangles aplenty on hands so dainty

491
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:47,078
A garland, you once gave me
with blossoms of Mimusop's Elengi

492
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:52,452
Festivities, dance of warfares
Long over are the temple fairs

493
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,789
A sentinel I stand in a tempIe forsaken
Like a burnt out black stone lamp alone

494
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:03,094
As rays of the fading evening sun,
Lay sprawled on the shores unrestrained

495
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:08,537
Swinging your tender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

496
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,838
As rays of fading evening sun,
sprawIed upon the shores unrestrained

497
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:19,076
Swinging your tender little arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

498
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:24,553
As rays of fading evening sun,
Iay sprawIed upon the shores unrestrained

499
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:29,922
ISwinging your tender IittIe arms, dear
in a boat you rowed away, my baby dear

500
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,401
Go climb the wall!

501
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:40,698
Cruel fellow!

502
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,537
And then?

503
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,142
Why mood off, sir?
A kind of sadness?

504
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,578
He's sad that
he can't have a baby

505
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,206
Haven't you heard?
Sorrow of being childless

506
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,744
What do the doctors say?

507
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,682
No use!
No use at all!

508
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,015
How can a baby be born
when we didn't have a chance?

509
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,749
Cruel she-devil
Witch, hellcat!

510
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,551
Cheater!

511
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,418
Da! You don't say anything

512
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,021
l will, she cheated me also
l will tell you, the rest of the story

513
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,865
lt was when, l quit Bharath Vision
and started my own channel, the NBI

514
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,664
lt was 2 or 3 days
before its launch

515
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,066
The day before these lovers
tired after love making...

516
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,109
...decided to get married
at the registry office

517
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:27,175
Well known NRI businessman
and MaIayaIee Rajan Kartha nominated...

518
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:32,746
...as Rajya Sabha member from Kerala as
decided by Democratic party central powers

519
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:38,627
State party president and possibIy future
Chief Minister, Bharathan Pillai...

520
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,187
...overcoming objections
of other parties in KeraIa...

521
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,962
...vouched for Rajan Kartha's nomination

522
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:49,004
When KeraIa does not have
a singIe candidate or MP...

523
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,065
Rishi, this is a good omen

524
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,542
Which one?

525
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,743
Our channel is taking off, at a time
when the situation is heating up with news

526
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,147
Our channel won't have
any dearth for news

527
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,052
That's true, but actually it's not
the way you think it is, Jose'aettan

528
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:09,488
From today, all channels will focus on
Rajan Kartha and Bharathan Pillai

529
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:14,725
But we will wake up in 2 days with
an exclusive story that'll divert viewers

530
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,163
All other channels are baffled

531
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,061
What's the story?

532
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,603
4 exclusive stories are ready

533
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,031
We'll just decide what to air
We have 2 more days, right?

534
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,200
There is 1 which could be
most exclusive, we can't ignore that

535
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:27,936
Venu!

536
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,840
Ah! Has the bridegroom arrived?

537
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,105
Don't you know him?
Venu

538
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,910
Who doesn't?

539
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,677
- Kelvin Joseph's partner
- l know him

540
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,888
Don't splurge all your money on him
although he may convince you

541
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,614
Come

542
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,087
We are getting married tomorrow

543
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,652
But not inviting you,
it's a registered marriage

544
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,296
Rishi did mention it, congrats!

545
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,223
Thanks

546
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,663
Give it to me

547
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:56,667
Dude, it's only a signature tomorrow
Don't take way Renu, for another month

548
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,298
She is my sub-editor

549
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,902
Come down to earth dude, just beginning
and thinks he's already a channel bigwig

550
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,240
Go, go

551
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,760
Dad wanted a proper wedding

552
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,759
Find someone else then, to stand
well decorated and smiling...shall we?

553
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,163
l just mentioned dad's wish

554
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,362
Let's find someone for dad then
Will your mom allow it?

555
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,764
God! What a thorny tree

556
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,166
Am l a thorny tree?

557
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,835
Am l not a flower, hmmm?

558
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,872
Hey! Can't you wait till tomorrow?

559
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,315
l've reached limits
of my patience, dude!

560
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,350
Rishi come here,
l'm reiterating what l've always said

561
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,758
l'm not investing, to strut around like
a channel owner, it's only for business

562
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:53,326
l have no allegiance to
any particular religion or party

563
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,661
Ratings, commercial
value of news, that's all

564
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,095
Also, l'm giving you
the freedom you've always wanted

565
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,037
Correct! Even otherwise
who are we indebted to?

566
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:07,805
A man comes home, freshens up
waits for his kids to sleep, views TV...

567
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:12,941
...for 2 hours, the programs and news
for which we have toiled and sweated

568
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,745
Ask him to get lost, l say!

569
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,410
Sheer attitude problem
Let's see you like this always, okay?

570
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,813
Sure, if this attitude shifts...

571
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,289
...l swear l'll work for you,
for your channel, for what you pay!

572
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,428
Renu, its Manilal here

573
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,961
A shocking exclusive!
l got this information, just now

574
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:38,840
Okay, Mani

575
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,979
Venu, something important, come

576
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,858
Rishi! Can your channel
go on air today, tonight?

577
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,425
We are on to an exclusive
which nobody may get

578
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,723
Yes or no?

579
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,921
Yes of course!

580
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,201
Listen, we are going on air
tonight itself, get everything set

581
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,205
The promos have to start
by today evening, 6:00 PM

582
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,338
NBI will be launched tonight at 10:00
with news, that's going to shock Kerala

583
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,407
Promos have to start
on internet and FM Radio

584
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,287
Rishi, seeing the promos,
people will wait for the shocking news...

585
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,289
...but what if the info is wrong?

586
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,882
We already have 4 other stories
that will shock, we'll start with any of them

587
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,789
Forward this now itself to play up

588
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:32,451
Okay

589
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,737
What is that?

590
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,439
5m, waterproof USB wire camera
Usually used in surgical procedures

591
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,014
lt will enter any body organ
or even the intestines, to shoot

592
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,077
But why, for our purpose?

593
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,210
62 degree wide vision view

594
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,014
AV details will be, clear
as crystal, high resolution

595
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,885
Have you prepared
your introduction lines?

596
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,928
Let's shoot it here
in the vehicle itself

597
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,188
Do we have to?

598
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:12,736
lt must be your face before the visuals
You won't get any benefit otherwise

599
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,462
Okay

600
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,331
Ready, rolling

601
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:22,872
In India, peopIe worm into political and
Iaw making infrastructures of this country...

602
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,418
...out of sheer power of money, one such
shocking scene, we invite you to witness

603
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:34,048
Candidate for Rajya Sabha, Rajan Kartha and
Bharatha pillai Democratic party president...

604
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,786
...caught in the act with crores
of money changing hands, watch it!

605
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,226
I hope we get to see all
what was just said

606
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,342
- Camera
- Sir

607
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,475
Here, take it

608
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,854
- Pan rights
- Okay, sir

609
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,154
- Okay sir?
- Okay, fine

610
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,399
Sir, this has come back after repair
Where shall we put it?

611
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,630
lt was taken from the office room
Keep it back there

612
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,312
Why does he still have this old fridge?
Can't he buy a new one?

613
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,949
That's our Bharathan Pillai sir
Such humility and modesty

614
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:58,958
Varghese, l am feeling very tired
Shall we meet tomorrow?

615
00:43:59,069 --> 00:43:59,535
Okay, sir

616
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,068
Okay, leader

617
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,305
Okay, we are leaving

618
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,568
Okay, everything
as we'd already planned

619
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,363
He is Kartha sir

620
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,036
Come, come

621
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,167
- Greetings
- Greetings

622
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,710
- Varghese, don't allow anyone in

623
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,457
I didn't have much hope
till the decision was made

624
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,254
Party members
protested so vehemently

625
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,627
They raise a hue and cry
only here, none of it reaches Delhi

626
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,427
Isn't that why I extended
my hand, when you asked?

627
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,161
Now, where is that stuff
which must reach my hand?

628
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,672
Oh that, yes!
That is ready

629
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,113
True, it's the key to your fridge

630
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:21,113
l took it by telling Varghese,
it needed repair

631
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,694
The entire amount
you've asked is here, count it

632
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,666
This will cover only
the Rajya sabha seat

633
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:49,508
The crown of a central minister
is on its way, don't forget that

634
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,014
I shall continue remembering it
like this, all the time, isn't that enough?

635
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:54,709
Sure

636
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,384
Sir is returning

637
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,092
Get the camera

638
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,491
Renu, take it

639
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:24,705
Come

640
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,242
Where?
What is it?

641
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,422
Sign off, it should be with
Pillai's house as a back drop

642
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,860
This is Renuka, with cameraman Venu
from Bharathan PiIIai's residence

643
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:38,785
Come

644
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,171
Police!

645
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,296
Don't drive off immediately!

646
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:53,843
Go straight ahead, there is
a round about, take a right and ask there

647
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,804
Now take off!

648
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,775
Hey! Come here

649
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,318
Who are you?

650
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,222
Why are you
prowling around here?

651
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,120
Nothing

652
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,352
Who was in that vehicle?

653
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,085
They asked for directions
and I told them

654
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,260
Hello?

655
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,132
Chief lnspector, Anthony

656
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,632
What is it?
You wanted to see me?

657
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,129
l am right in front of your house

658
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,573
We've caught a man
who looks suspicious

659
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,404
Looks like a journalist

660
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,614
What?
A journalist?

661
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:43,392
Reuters, BBC
Delhi based

662
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,391
Not any local channel eh?
What were you planning?

663
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:51,901
Look sir, this is wrongful confinement
How can you hold me like a criminal?

664
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,864
l am a media person
with a national rating

665
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:58,374
Okay! How many policemen know
what Reuters means in our town?

666
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,473
Please wait outside
Venu, sit please

667
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,477
No thanks

668
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,646
What was the information?

669
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,819
What did you see and shoot?

670
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,681
Open your mouth
and tell me, you...!

671
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:12,777
Hey, be quiet!

672
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,725
What you've guessed
was the information we got

673
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,853
Later, we realized it was false

674
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,359
How?

675
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,362
Kartha sir came in
with nothing in his hand

676
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,438
He did not carry any briefcase
or bag which could contain money

677
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,636
- Sir
- What is it?

678
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,711
Police chased and caught the van
We've got a wireless message

679
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:39,715
And?

680
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,341
The van belongs
to NBI, a new channel

681

00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,915
Flash news is appearing on TV right now
Nothing was found from the vehicle

683
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,994
Only the driver was there
So the van was allowed to go

684
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:04,840
NBI, News Bureau of lndia

689
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,356

Varghese, get an ambulance ready
So as to reach here, in just 2 minutes

691
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,295
Hello?
Yes, Bharathan Pillai

692
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:33,935
Who was it?

693
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,995
- Don't know, got disconnected
- Call him back

694
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:40,868
Now it is switched off

695
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,858
Greetings, good evening
NBI, News Bureau of lndia

696
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,701
No need for introductions
for news, that's true and authentic

697
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,570
ln the same way NBI
without introductions

698
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,633
From this minute, for you, from today

699
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:20,682
As a brand new channel, naturally
we come to you, with exclusive news

700
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,613
Confessions, we have seen them
many times on channel screens

701
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:30,558
But here is a secret which will
shock Kerala, truth brought by a priest

702
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,589
ln 2003 there was a sensational...

703
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,002
Sorry Venu
Sorry for the inconvenience

704
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,607
Varghese, drop him
wherever he needs to go

705
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:46,933
Sorry

706
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,684
What the heck did you build up to?

707
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,083
Was it only me?
Who asked for an ambulance?

708
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:01,123
lf the news was true
we had to shift stuff from here

709
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,659
What will l do with that cash?
That was the reason

710
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,660
Who is this priest?
Who knows?

711
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,099
A sinner who is not penitent
deserves to be punished

712
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:14,830
Rishi

713
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,597
What happened?

714
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,033
Where is Renu?

715
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,933
You returned
together, didn't you?

716
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,946
We waited for you till the last minute
When you didn't come, we aired another story

717
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,612
Tell me what happened?

718
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:35,448
l sent her off at 9:00 PM
With the footage we shot

719
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:36,521
And then?

720
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,822
Do you think she could be hurt?

721
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,696
No! Don't panic!
Nothing will happen to her

722
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,527
Why don't we air
this issue now itself?

723
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:48,864
Rishi look!

724
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:55,070
Candidate for Rajya Sabha, Rajan Kartha and
Bharathan pillai Democratic party president...

725
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,808
...caught in the act with crores
of money changing hands, watch it!

726
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,664
How can your program on
confessions have any effect...

727
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,759
...when such explosive news is being aired?

728
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,770
This channel was a dead baby
even before it was born

729
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,864
Even a launch program
couldn't be done confidentially...

730
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,570
...and l've wasted my money
Enough, just wind up now

731
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,179
This is Renuka, with cameraman Venu
from Bharathan PiIIai's residence

732
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,832
- Sir
- Where did you drop her?

733
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,134
Sir, at the over-bridge
Another car came and she got into it

734
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,607
Let's go to Bharath Vision

735
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:48,788
Move man

736
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:54,220
You are finished!!!

737
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,956
You are no more!

738
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,893
Over! l'll just think you died
after turning insane!

739
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,081
Hello?

740
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:28,130
Venu, you dragged and threw me down
from a very great height

741
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,025
l called to let you
know my happiness

742
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:36,969
A deep wound and the sharp pain
When it heals, only l'll feel it

743
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,566
But be sure, you also will know it

744
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,079
Democratic party after its meeting...

745
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,644
...decides to strip
Bharathan PiIIai's presidentiaI position

746
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,253
They have aIso requested vigiIance...

747
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,193
...to start investigations
against Kartha and Bharathan PiIIai

748
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,970
Oh that was a terrible thing to do!

749
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,703
Doesn't matter
Forgiven

750
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:19,176
lf l was 1 day late, l would've had
to stand in a queue at the family court

751
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,147
l've forgiven!

752
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,016
l will not forgive!
She ruined my NBI

753
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,382
He wasn't referring to you

754
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,886
Bharathan Pillai would have
been a Chief Ministertoday

755
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,888
Today he's just
a state committee member

756
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,654
The rotten corpse!

757
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,255
lts 5 years since we heard
anything about NRl, Rajan Kartha

758
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,592
- Da!
- What is it, da?

759
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,931
They are all his people
Send them away, quickly

760
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,197
l'm hungry, where's your bike?

761
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:49,874
Da?

762
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,275
Did you pay salary to your staff?

763
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,976
- Yes l did
- How did you manage?

764
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,108
Did you get a windfall?

765
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,211
You refused to loan me
So l sold you

766
00:55:58,755 --> 00:55:59,244
How?

767
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,822
We got incriminating
footage of that DySP Benny

768
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,654
Some youngster shot it at some resort

769
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,662
l showed him the footage and
threatened him, mimicking you

770
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:07,321
Rs 3 lakhs

771
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,762
Stop!

772
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,933
- Stop!
- Don't punch me

773
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,360
Stop the bike!
Aiyo!

774
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,297
l'll kill you

775
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,141
Can't l use your name a bit?

776
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,243
This has a different name
You want to see...?

777
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,046
Will an action do?

778
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,384
- Have you gone away?
- l am here

779
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,991
l will use you also

780
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,263
Don't do that
l am not like that

781
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,289
What's happening?

782
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:46,464
Police!

783
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,761
Why are you dancing
in the middle of the night?

784
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,965
We were just exercising

785
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,032
Exercise? Middle of the night?
Put them both in the jeep

786
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:54,701
Wait!

787
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:56,438
l will come by myself

788
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,211
Do l have to repeat it to you?

789
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,775
You'll face consequences
if you lay your hands on me

790
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,785
Tomorrow, all channels will carry
your stupid face, as its cover story

791
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:11,787
Beware! You are playing games
with Reuters stinger Venu, got it?

792
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,721
You may be big people, but when you
play such public games, what shall we do?

793
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,800
Oh, so what shall we do?

794
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,367
Sir?

795
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,695
This is his usual drama

796
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,373
Any time police catch him
or gets into any other issue...

797
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,411
...he will immediately say
that he's big-wig of a channel

798
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:32,237
He's nothing of that sort
Does video coverage, of weddings

799
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:36,911
Da!

800
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:38,479
l will come

801
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,418
Walk quickly, man!

802
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:46,825
Come in

803
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
Move aside!

804
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,729
Francis! Get their bikes
to the police station

805
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,463
Put in a liter of petrol also, okay?

806
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,276
Get up, l say

807
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,281
Get up

808
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:07,212
What's happening?

809
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,443
This man is a nuisance

810
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,349
He brought the bench
from the veranda to sleep here

811
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,751
Lock me up
Or, l will sleep here

812
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,052
l always sleep at ten
after a glass of milk

813
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,490
Go

814
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,261
This is sheer menace and
l already wrote out the FlR!

815
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,297
lf you want to get out
get someone to bail you

816
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,561
We don't have anyone, sir
We are orphans

817
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,361
We are from the public orphanage

818
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,063
Sir?

819
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,435
Please switch on that fan

820
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,108
Do you hear him?
Switch on the fan

821
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,075
Who is it, middle of the night?!

822
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,450
lf it is anyone important
ask him to call tomorrow, l'm off to sleep

823
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,890
Hello, who is it?

824
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:54,953
lsn't this the number of Venu
stinger cameraman, of Reuters?

825
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,569
Who is it, sir?
ls it from the orphanage?

826
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:04,530
Hello?

827
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,805
l am advocate, Manilal
What is the case?

828
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:15,851
Counsel, it was a mistake
Please ask him to overlook this

829
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,920
My police pal, see what happens
when you confront me, at midnight?

830
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,320
- Did you see now?
- Heard now?

831
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,122
Thanks a lot

832
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:25,393
Venu?

833
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,863
l've been trying you from
last evening but couldn't get through

834
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,093
Who are you?

835
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,601
l am advocate, Manilal
l have something to tell you

836
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:35,899
What is it?

837
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,431
lt's about an exclusive

838
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,336
However important it is
l'll see you tomorrow...

839
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,071
...when l am fresh
Come let's go!

840
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,186
So tell me, what is this
exclusive, all about?

841
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,130
An exclusive like this won't ever occur
in the history of news channels again

842
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,501
A story that has
to be shot risking life

843
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:11,166
l've risked my life many times
Forget that, come to the point

844
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:15,404
l will, but before that, l want
a firm affirmation from you

845
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:20,905
This exclusive info was got
from a particular channel

846
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,251
The story has to be
covered, only for them

847
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,286
Their reporter will accompany you
Do you have any objections?

848
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,217
Once l disclose information
You can't go back on your word

849
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:37,388
Mr lawyer, l do follow certain ethics
lf l give my word, it is forever

850
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,499
So you agree?

851
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,131
Agreed

852
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,230
But l'll be the one to decide
what to do and how to do it

853
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,569
Okay, agreed

854
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:04,959
Now l come to the actual point
What you have to cover, is a murder

855
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,487
The murder planned, is on behalf
of a well known politician of Kerala

856
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:16,532
Sorry! l cannot do this

857
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,470
Hey! Venu!
Please!

858
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,475
A life is more important
than a piece of news

859
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,512
Since we have info,
we have to try and save him

860
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:27,375
lt may lessen the news value, but
ratings mustn't depend on blood spilt

861
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,145
Venu, let me explain

862
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,226
lt's not my urge to make money
by 'live' coverage of a man's death

863
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:46,191
He can't be saved by anyone
even if it's reported to the police

864
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:52,131
Because, Bharathan Pillai still dictates,
even though, he's not yet Chief Minister

865
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,334
- Bharathan Pillai?
- Yes

866
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,545
This murder will
take place on his behalf

867
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:02,312
We can't prevent it, can't we at least
make sure the culprits don't escape?

868
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,452
Okay, so who is the victim?

869
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,255
A man in Bharathan Pillai's group
We don't know who or what...

870
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,453
What rubbish is this?

871
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,759
l can only assure you
this information is 100% genuine

872
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:25,640
Tell me the place, time and date and
who is the reporter, coming with me

873
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:27,404
Renu?

874
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,549
This woman?!

875
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:42,112
Find someone else!
Lawyer, drop me back!

876
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:48,027
Venu, listen to me
You can't go, you agreed...

877
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,658
...l disclosed info because
you claimed to have ethics

878
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,827
Did you tell me beforehand
this useless creature was coming?

879
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,401
You only said some reporter

880
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:00,701
Didn't l warn you to disclose info
only aftertelling him everything, Chey!

881
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:07,371
Think it's not Renuka, but a stranger
X or Y, with a professional approach

882
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:13,114
l am totally professional! Such a risky job,
l need someone who gels with me

883
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,818
Petty personal issues
mustn't come in the way...

884
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:19,550
...of this exclusive with
such strong social impact

885
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,462
We don't have any option, but Renuka

886
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,293
Venu, you can insist on
whatever conditions you want

887
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,671
Please

888
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:35,609
Please Venu!

889
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:39,580
Okay

890
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:45,746
These are my conditions
l'll be the sole decision maker

891
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,383
Reporter X or Y is not allowed
to make any suggestions

892
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,255
Sure

893
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:55,492
A DSNG van, without any crew
must be at my disposal

894
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:57,528
Okay

895
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:03,338
Visuals l 'UP' has to be aired, unedited
With no interference in it, whatsoever

896
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:05,598
Agreed

897
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,502
My remuneration alone, is Rs 10 lakh

898
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:14,710
- Here, it's got more than what you've asked
- Let it wait, there are more conditions

899
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,917
Visuals must accompany
a scrolling script...

900
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,619
'Visuals exclusively covered
by cameraman Venu'

901
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,618
No intro or sign out by the reporter

902
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,291
Agreed

903
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,195
You have 12 hours to plan
and prepare, Renu knows the details

904
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:36,771
Okay

905
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,736
The baton has now
shifted into your hands

906
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,138
Venu...Renu?
Shake hands on this

907
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,175
Not necessary!

908
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,576
What's this? You'll be
working together hereafter

909
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,544
Be professional

910
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,672
Venu please?

911
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,629
Keep the cash in the car

912
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,924
You have neither an intro nor sign off
Why the hell are you tagging along?

913
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,207
Suppose you run away with the footage
as a revenge for the old grouse?

914
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:16,472
There is only 1 creature on earth
who'd do such things, and that's you!

915
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:21,476
l forgot to tell you, DSNG receives
poor signal at the crime spot

916
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,917
Even if it did, we cannot
go there with the van, right?

917
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:25,954
Oh, you are right

918
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,889
Okay, now both of you
can chart out a plan

919
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,453
Not 'both' of us
Only me!

920
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,343
- Shall l suggest something?
- No!

921
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,274
- Listen first
- Not necessary

922
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,678
Don't get into a fervor
and try to save the victim

923
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,786
You must be so blood thirsty!
Cruel she-devil!

924
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:07,021
Murder will occur even if we interfere
and finally we'll become defendants

925
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,355
- Are you sure?
- Very sure

926
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,889
Then l will surely interfere, l don't care
if l'm accused, you'll also go to jail

927
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:13,826
Come on, be serious

928
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,699
You want me
to be serious? Really?

929
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,703
lf l did, you'll be lying
in ICU, very serious

930
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,499
There are arrears
in plenty against you

931
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,810
No need to contribute, be quiet
and just allow me to do my stuff

932
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,814
To hell with you!

933
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:58,979
Lean back and sit without
touching me, especially your bust!

934
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,881
You dirty...chi!!!

935
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:22,467
Turn left

936
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,607
This is the club house

937
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:28,770
Here? ln such an open area?

938
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,069
Disputed property

939
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,644
Government acquired 15 years ago,
not even a watchman will be here

940
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,476
What time is this
crime scheduled for?

941
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:36,982
Between 8:00 and 9:00 PM

942
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,350
ls it a favorable time?
Like they fix in weddings?

943
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:24,622
Come here

944
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,964
Are you scared to be alone?
l am going up there

945
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:36,929
A little

946
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,672
Then wait right here

947
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,707
After some time,
yourfear will increase

948
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,175
lf you make a sound,
l'll kill you with one blow!

949
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:01,657
Hey!

950
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:02,792
What is it?

951
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:04,561
A rat!

952
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:09,265
Rat?! l'll stuff cloth down your throat!
Not a sound from you!

953
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,093
Don't scare me,
you she-devil!!!

954
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:46,968
How did you come up?

955
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,372
l too learnt martial art
Kalari, for 6-7 years

956
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:01,979
Look...a car

957
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:20,660
Let me go, don't kill me
l begged forgiveness at his feet

958
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,104
Take me to him

959
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,935
You are great man
Sir will come to meet you here

960
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,956
Don't hurt me, please
Let me go

961
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,992
Leave me

962
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,751
Let me go

963
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,627
Don't harm me

964
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,432
Leave me, aiyo!

965
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:18,326
Don't harm me, sir
Didn't l confess everything?

966
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:22,420
Will your confessions
give me back, all what l lost?

967
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:28,097
My image, position, the days l spent
idle at home, since last 5 years

968
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:32,332
Suguna, to you, wasn't it
just an itch on your tongue?

969
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:39,038
When you betrayed us
to the channel you knew very well...

970
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:42,015
...it would cost me
and Kartha our political careers

971
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:46,745
Let me at least have
the joy of deciding your end

972
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,221
Sir, don't kill me

973
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,072
Take him away and hang him

974
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,298
Hello, Venu?

975
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:19,305
Ready?

976
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,873
l am going to upload
the footage of the visuals

977
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:25,240
You have to 'UP' it with
the scrolling script and your logo

978
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,008
Okay

979
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:31,280
When you switch on, l'll go watch TV
in some place, any editing, remember...?!

980
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,986
Okay Venu, there won't be
any interference from us

981
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:38,651
Yes! Venu's footage will come now
UP the scrolling script along with it, okay?

982
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,988
Get ready with camera
DSNG crew and everything

983
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:45,090
We've got to be in front
of Bharathan Pillai's house

984
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,968
l am going to that
restaurant to watch TV

985
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,337
l want to see if they have
messed with my visuals

986
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:54,500
Be right here, till l get back

987
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:16,353
A true and shocking incident
that occurred a few moments ago

988
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:22,563
Prompted us to air this speciaI buIIetin
BrutaI visuaIs we have never seen before

989
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:30,110
Democratic party Ieader Bharathan PiIIai's
CrueI revenge against party member Sugunan

990
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,282
Don't harm me, sir
Didn't I confess to everything?

991
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:40,611
My image, position, the days I spent
idIe at home since Iast 5 years

992
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:44,050
Suguna, wasn't it to you
just an itch on your tongue?

993
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,684
Don't kiII me

994
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,162
Take him away and hang him

995
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:12,247
From the pIace of incident
this is Renuka with camera man, Venu

996
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,691
Get down the way you came up

997
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,554
Sure, give me the bag
l will throw it down

998
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:32,503
From the pIace of incident
this is Renuka with cameraman, Venu

999
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,369
You...!

1000
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,458
lsn't it them?
The camera man and reporter?

1001
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,428
Sir, this is really amazing
Did the 2 of you really shoot this?

1002
01:18:56,131 --> 01:19:00,534
- ls his body still hanging there?
- May be, let the police enquire

1003
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:03,627
- They must have shot it, hiding
- No dude, he shot it right from the front

1004
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,402
They wouldn't be alive
if they'd been caught by those thugs

1005
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,534
Sir, we are on our way
to Bharathan Pillai's house

1006
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:13,706
lf Pillai resists arrest
we'll have to use force

1007
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,682
We've sent our forces
to the club house

1008
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,247
Once the body is traced and identified
we'll immediately go in and arrest, sir

1009
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:25,153
Look! Bharathan Pillai's house
Police have come to arrest him

1010
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,462
After watching visuaIs of
Bharath Vision's exposure

1011
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:35,025
You are seeing here
the frenzy of peopIe

1012
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,098
We also know only
what was shown on TV

1013
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,364
Police have already gone
to the place of the incident

1014
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:43,601
Let us trace the body first
after that we'll take necessary steps

1015
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,202
Will there be any arrests, sir?

1016
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,606
We cannot say, at this juncture
We'll let you know by and by

1017
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:49,649
Move!

1018
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:57,189
Arrest the murderer

1019
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:02,528
Stop!

1020
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:03,723
Stop!

1021
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,861
What do you want?
Pelt stones till l die?

1022
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:07,693
Go ahead
Do it, kill me

1023
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,499
No need for police and courts
You have the right to punish me

1024
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,540
Before that, you have
to know certain truths

1025
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,665
You don't have
to say any darn thing!

1026
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,073
We saw everything on TV

1027
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,078
Just answer the police
when they question you

1028
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,471
Varghese!

1029
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,470
Look! There's the dead man!

1030
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,176
Whatever l have to say
is here, for you to see, 'alive'

1031
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:58,912
lt was him, it seems
who l killed and then hanged

1032
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,513
What more can l say?!
Ask him whatever you want

1033
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,749
Mr Suguna, what do you have to say?

1034
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:10,688
l don't know anything, l too saw it
on TV, Pillai sir will tell you the rest

1035
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,695
Mr Pillai, what do you have to say?

1036
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:17,761
l don't understand why that girl
and cameraman have enmity to me

1037
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,206
l also have no idea
how they created such visuals

1038
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:22,708
l am not a technical expert

1039
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:26,541
You remember, 5 years ago
the same team hunted and...

1040
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,550
...pinned Kartha and me down
with a bribe charge, using visuals

1041
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,381
l couldn't prove anything then

1042
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,578
Break and destroy Bharath Vision!
Come, dude!

1043
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,714
Damn his hidden camera!!

1044
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:40,794
Wait there! You can't go
after creating controversies

1045
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,761
Go, get into the van
without gaping, you idiot

1046
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:53,706
Don't let them go

1047
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:00,815
Come on, climb

1048
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:05,714
Abu! Van!

1049
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:07,820
Move

1050
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:24,906
Burn it up!

1051
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,364
Turn right, we'll go to
Bharath Vision

1052
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:52,861
Turn right
lt's saferthere

1053
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:53,730
What?

1054
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,270
Turn right
We'll go to the studio

1055
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,432
Don't utter a word
What do we do at the studio?

1056
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:05,444
Move aside

1057
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,987
Where is he?
Come

1058
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,259
l don't know what happened
The original footage...

1059
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,259
Enough! Stop

1060
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:21,886
- l was just talking to the home secretary
- Later

1061
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:25,626
- Let me discuss this with my legal advisor
- We'll get him to the police station, come

1062
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,729
Move aside!

1063
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:44,984
Get down!

1064
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,611
Today, some shocking visuaIs
of a brutaI murder that stunned...

1065
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,749
...the conscience of KeraIa
were aired by Bharath Vision

1066
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:55,023
But soon after that, within minutes
the man who was claimed to be killed...

1067
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,725
- l am Venu
- Where are you?

1068
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,766
-Are you in your apartment?
- No, at the studio

1069
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,528
l am right beneath
your apartment

1070
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,794
Right below my apartment?!

1071
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,361
Don't you dare go there!
l'll kill the 2 of you

1072
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:07,600
You went to favor Bharath Vision
Exclusive it seems!

1073
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,973
Go, take her also along
l can't do anything for you

1074
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,807
Tell me where the keys are, vagabond!

1075
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,740
Only you can go in, not her

1076
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:19,612
l'll decide that, now tell me
where is the key, useless!

1077
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:22,583
On the window sill

1078
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:26,991
Don't open the door to anyone, l'll be
ruined if anyone knows you are in there

1079
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,693
Look, you don't broadcast this, okay?
l'll kill you, if you do!

1080
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,346
Get inside, you...!

1081
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:31,982
Oh Lord, am l fated to die
without a drop to drink?

1082
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,927
Protestors from Bharathan PiIIai's house
were uncontrollable by the time...

1083
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,591
...they reached the Bharath Vision studios

1084
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:44,467
PoIice arrived and stopped them whiIe
breaking the glass and trying to barge in...

1085
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,132
...and on charges of
telecasting false news

1086
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:52,111
...they arrested CEO
and 1 of the directors, Vijaykumar

1087
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:55,780
His granny's information!
He has to be kicked, the pig!

1088
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,547
lt was I who got the information
Not Vijaykumar, sir

1089
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:00,884
What?

1090
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:05,049
lt was l who was informed

1091
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:07,151
Tell me, who gave the info to you

1092
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,631
Come on tell me

1093
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:13,759
Go on

1094
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:17,594
lt was the lawyer, Manilal

1095
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,902
So he was the one who betrayed, eh?

1096
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:25,705
He is innocent
l know very well

1097
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,680
Not innocent (actor)
ldavela Babu (actor)

1098
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,444
How can you trust him?
ls he God, or your dad?

1099
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:36,747
He's my cousin, all exclusive info
l've covered, were based on his tip-offs

1100
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:41,258
His info was always true
including the bribe case

1101
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,055
Manilal will not betray

1102
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,695
Pillai deserves a bouquet

1103
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:51,263
He retrieved all he'd lost on a single night
At the same time, made us go into hiding

1104
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,836
Yes, now l can hear

1105
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:57,535
Mr Bharathan Pillai, the incident at
the cIub house being proved faIse...

1106
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,546
...are you now claiming that
the bribe case charged on you

1107
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:04,051
...and Kartha 5 years back
was totally baseIess?

1108
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,912
Didn't the truth
come out by itself?

1109
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,113
Now let the central committee
decide what l should do

1110
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:12,590
l've suffered for 5 years, in spite of
not having committed a single crime

1111
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,628
The people and party members
who rejected me then, are now with me

1112
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,963
l'm sure the central
committee will realize this

1113
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,498
Thank you

1114
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:29,601
High hopes! l didn't hang that fellow
to get an award for good behavior

1115
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,235
Let them bring it back
All what they took away

1116
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:36,045
The 2 of them are in a pathetic state
Must be hiding, not knowing what to do

1117
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,744
Renuka along with camera man Venu

1118
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,718
Dude, this is simple straight math

1119
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:45,190
Anyone with an ounce of brains
can decipher this move, let alone Venu

1120
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:49,054
The credibility he'd destroyed
l managed to get back

1121
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:55,794
Now to ruin their trust and careers
l'm taking the same route, a silent chase

1122
01:27:56,004 --> 01:28:01,806
Sir, but isn't there a risk?
Will he not come after you again?

1123
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:04,902
Of course he will
But not immediately, Varghese

1124
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,076
They will not get out
until this noise dies down

1125
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,118
l too gain time that way,
because by then...

1126
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,312
...l'll occupy the chief minister's chair

1127
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,081
Let them come after that

1128
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,932
- Here, use onions
- l don't want your onions

1129
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,153
Don't show your craving

1130
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,891
- l never asked
- l won't give, even if you ask

1131
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,050
Shhhh!

1132
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:55,726
Someone's knocking

1133
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,825
Some one's outside

1134
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:01,869
Sure, there is someone

1135
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,794
Greedy devil!

1136
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:37,295
Thanks

1137
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,191
Ask them to come in

1138
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:20,772
Burn it all up, dude!

1139
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,849
Sir, this is Venu's l-Pad
All the visuals are in this

1140
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:28,351
So we've got all
the original footage

1141
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,412
- Yes sir
- Good!

1142
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:31,356
Settle their accounts

1143
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:36,853
Having been proved
that the visuaIs were faIse...

1144
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,399
PoIice have charged a case
against Venu and Renuka

1145
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,936
And they are on the Iookout to find them
The sooner they are...

1146
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,028
Switch it off, l say!

1147
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,232
Says the city poIice commissioner

1148
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:48,301
What do we do now?

1149
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,139
Think! lf you get
a brainwave, tell me

1150
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,414
We need to know
the legal consequences

1151
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,173
Shall l call Manilal?

1152
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,149
Who am l, to ask permission?
Your husband?

1153
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:02,219
My phone was lost in that DSNG van
lf you give me your phone, l'll call him

1154
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,761
Call him with the speaker phone
switched on

1155
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,721
l want to hear what he says

1156
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:10,262
Okay

1157
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:11,855
Don't tell him about this place

1158
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:17,266
Stand near me and call

1159
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:22,167
Hello?

1160
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,801
Mani, it's me Renu

1161
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:25,811
Where were you?

1162
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,440
Couldn't you call?
l was so worried

1163
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,310
Don't ever be caught
by the party men or police

1164
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,081
All of them are in a frenzy

1165
01:31:34,188 --> 01:31:36,247
Tell me, what can
happen to us, at the most?

1166
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:37,949
lf you are caught
it will be a big problem

1167
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:41,357
Once arrested, you won't
get bail for 40 days

1168
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:48,468
l'll tell you a way out, because
l'm concerned about you

1169
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:52,306
The 1st one, who's caught
gets 40 days in lock-up

1170
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:56,773
When the 2nd person surrenders,
it'll be forjust 1or 2 days

1171
01:31:56,878 --> 01:31:59,244
You will surely
get bail, being a woman

1172
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:03,041
Why take a risk?
Get him caught somehow

1173
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,415
Tell me the place,
l'll take care of the rest

1174
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:14,084
Don't glare at me, he likes me
He must've said that, to save me

1175
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,492
Your Mani...l'll...!

1176
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,826
You and your people
are all of the same kind, cheats!

1177
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,602
Didn't you move away
from me, to talk in secret?

1178
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,374
l've been told the FlR
has not yet been written

1179
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:01,237
Yes

1180
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:04,503
Tell me, you want to be
defendant or a witness?

1181
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,513
There's not much time
isn't it, Anthony?

1182
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,378
Yes, sir

1183
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:14,421
Let's say, you trusted Renuka
and aired the visuals from Bharath Vision

1184
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:21,089
You neither knew anything nor
did you entrust Venu this job, that's all

1185
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:27,464
Bharatha Vision can continue
functioning as usual from tomorrow

1186
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:28,567
What do you say?

1187
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,971
Where are they?
Venu and Renuka?

1188
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,004
They are on the run
Don't you know?

1189
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:38,411
We have decided
not to run after them

1190
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,142
Sorry sir, but l'm running after them

1191
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:47,648
Was it for this show-down
he was brought to the police club?

1192
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,480
No sir, the commissioner
wanted to question...

1193
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,420
- No!
- Sir!

1194
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:56,394
You never asked me
why l was running afterthem?!

1195
01:33:57,531 --> 01:34:00,125
l have my doubts, as to why
they wanted to create a footage...

1196
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:03,364
...of a man being killed
when he actually was not

1197
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:06,139
So l thought l'll ask them directly

1198
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,104
Benny

1199
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:13,342
You must find them, quickly
Time is running out, for me and you!

1200
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:21,016
You heard that?

1201
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:25,588
Today's 10:00 PM news
has to be neutral

1202
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:30,322
But stress on, Renuka's thirst
for exclusivity and popularity

1203
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:30,989
Okay, sir

1204
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:34,398
And Venu, just a camera man
who covered, what she asked him to

1205
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:37,562
See that you protect him
lf possible, we'll drop a bombshell

1206
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:39,138
An exclusive interview with Venu

1207
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:40,434
ls it to be here, in the studio?

1208
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:44,409
You...! Go get yourtext
ready for the evening news!

1209
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:46,303
Go, all of you

1210
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:49,045
Dumbo! But not when
he doesn't get his pay!

1211
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,418
SP Somarajan sir is calling

1212
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:52,977
Sir?

1213
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:58,356
Rishi, Police may raid your studio
Their intention is to catch Venu

1214
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,085
Come, we have work to do

1215
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:15,040
lf they begin to shoot
take away the camera

1216
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:17,542
Return it only after
removing the footage

1217
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,612
- lndhu, is the sound ready?
- Ready

1218
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:23,775
VCR must be in position

1219
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,575
Only the indicator must be seen

1220
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,658
Don't allow anyone to enter or exit

1221
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:32,750
What is it, sir?

1222
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:35,155
- Where is Venu?
- Which Venu?

1223
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,524
How many Venu-s do you know?

1224
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:38,161
lndhu?

1225
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:39,693
Call Venu

1226
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:43,394
What is the problem, sir?
Don't harass him, innocent chap!

1227
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:46,739
Sir, there's Venu

1228
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:49,673
What is it sir?

1229
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:50,403
This...!!!

1230
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:53,043
What is it, sir?

1231
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:56,606
Are you making fun of me?
Where is he buddy, the Reuters stinger?

1232
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,719
Why would he be here?
He must be at Bharath Vision studio

1233
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:04,224
Don't play your games with me
l'll deal with you good and proper

1234
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:07,021
Tell me! You must know
His 1 and only friend, right?

1235
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:10,593
Sir, leave his collar
Look, it's going on 'live'

1236
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:11,494
Live?

1237
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:21,599
Mr Rishikesh, as a responsible channel head
shouldn't you be helping the police?

1238
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:24,405
Get lost, you useless!!!
Sure, l'll help you catch him, you...!!!

1239
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:27,409
How can you behave like this?

1240
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,244
Sudhi, cut Rishi's audio

1241
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:32,550
Now onwards it will be
a shower of swear words!

1242
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,419
Ouch!

1243
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:50,263
Okay, let me know if you get info
This is my number, here

1244
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:52,365
Okay, see you then

1245
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:53,098
Sure

1246
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:56,169
Sir, watch out, these rascals might
put a camera even into our inner wear

1247
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,577
lndhu, audio on

1248
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:11,518
The competition for excIusive news
may have put Renuka into this jeopardy

1249
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,419
What you saw now, is how,
based on past events...

1250
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:16,894
...police are treating
the entire media community

1251
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:21,328
This is what DySPBenny Tharakan
wrote, just before he Ieft the studio

1252
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,832
I'II deaI with you outside, you dog!

1253
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:32,112
In case you don't see me on this channeI
you can concIude, I'm in poIice custody

1254
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:38,144
We are on to fresh info about
the teIecasting of faIse news issue

1255
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:42,386
The poIice who are on the Iook out
for Reuters stinger camera man Venu ...

1256
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:45,721
...in connection with the controversiaI
murder footage, wiII join us on Iine now

1257
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:46,657
Hello Venu?

1258
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,524
Sorry, our technicians
wiII soon connect us

1259
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,162
Hello?

1260
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,402
Venu?
Can you hear me?

1261
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,476
Send me at Ieast
a bottIe of brandy, you fooI!

1262
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:06,341
HeIIo?

1263
01:38:07,948 --> 01:38:11,440
I'm going insane, there's nothing
to booze, you miserIy vagabond

1264
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,382
HeIIo

1265
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,189
- Can't you hear me?
- Yes, I can, teII me Venu

1266
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,254
What actuaIIy
happened that night?

1267
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:21,294
What eIse, it was just
a drama by that PiIIai

1268
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:23,659
I must be kicked
in the butt for faIIing for that...!

1269
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,363
Hello, Venu?

1270
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:32,303
You vagabond!

1271
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,374
In this situation
what have you got to say?

1272
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:39,806
There are unscrupuIous fellows
amongst us, who use personaI phone caIIs ...

1273
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,747
...of even their cIosest paIs
for excIusivity

1274
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:46,513
If that attitude changes
we can be free of such issues

1275
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:48,719
Thank you, Mr Venu

1276
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:51,424
A short break before
we move on to other topics

1277
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:04,403
Sir, Kakkanad, Skyline apartments

1278
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:11,702
Sir, we've traced his hide out
Skyline apartments, at Kakkanad

1279
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:12,336
Very good

1280
01:39:12,413 --> 01:39:14,347
But we couldn't trace
the floor he occupies

1281
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:18,483
We'll enquire if any media person
resides there and search that first

1282
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:34,627
Da! l've favors saved up, to return to you!
You sold me, on 1st chance you got, right?

1283
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:37,398
Forget it, your phone call
was traced and police have located you

1284
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:40,531
Somaraj sir informed me, they'll be
there right now, so go away from there

1285
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:42,234
Where will l go at this time of the night?

1286
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:45,345
Just move from there forthe time being
l'll find another place and call you

1287
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:14,535
Where are you going?

1288
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:17,840
Police have traced us here
They'll be here at any moment

1289
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:18,843
Oh Lord!

1290
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,677
One minute, l'll go
to the john and come

1291
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,503
l can't bear it any more

1292
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:19,465
What?

1293
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:21,338
Please stop!

1294
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:22,766
What for?

1295
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:26,675
What?
What is it?

1296
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:28,873
l want to pee

1297
01:41:29,683 --> 01:41:32,709
Oh! This will be our ruin!
Couldn't you finish it at the apartment?

1298
01:41:32,786 --> 01:41:34,981
You locked the door and
took off before l could, didn't you?

1299
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:41,456
Get off

1300
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:47,695
Please

1301
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,731
Chey! That was an ambulance

1302
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,128
Where is the bike's key, you...!?

1303
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:26,934
Here

1304
01:42:27,007 --> 01:42:28,599
You were trying
to get me caught, right?

1305
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,777
l did that, so you
wouldn't leave me and go

1306
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:35,645
You cheat! Don't lie
l know...you didn't go to pee

1307
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:36,747
Chey! Get lost da!

1308
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,782
You dare say,
'get lost, da' to me?

1309
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,017
Didn't you start the bike
to go off and let me get caught?

1310
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:42,487
l thought l'll be ready
by the time you come back

1311
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:44,056
Why did you lock me up in the flat?

1312
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,186
So what? Yes l did!!!
To trap you, now what about it?

1313
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:48,155
Sure, l too did the same

1314
01:42:54,234 --> 01:43:00,139
One of us must give ourselves up
We can't live like fugitives, under pressure

1315
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,936
l am not giving myself up
without finding a solution to this

1316
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:06,446
Then drop me at
the police station and go

1317
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:08,175
Don't start being sentimental, okay?

1318
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:12,048
Sentiments?! Sure l don't have any
Remember? Only popularity mania, right?

1319
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:14,677
Look, no flashbacks, okay?
Pouring oil on troubled waters!

1320
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:17,621
You are a reporter, me, a camera man
That's all, now get on the bike

1321
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:21,021
Unless this is solved
we are not surrendering

1322
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:26,855
A hideout is ready, take the 1st left
after the Alpuzha Nedumudi bridge

1323
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:30,602
After about, 1 .5 km
you'll see a wooden gate

1324
01:43:31,171 --> 01:43:32,729
l'll be there, with Abu

1325
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:33,597
Okay

1326
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,166
Who was it?

1327
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:37,537
Rishi

1328
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:10,872
Hi

1329
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:20,150
Come dude, this summer house
belongs to a friend, he's in the USA

1330
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:21,176
Come

01:44:36,637 --> 01:44:37,934
l'll come back
tomorrow morning

1332
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:38,895
What?

1333
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:41,671
l'll be here in the morning
with clothes and a hearing aid

1334
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:43,975
Buy all newspapers
you can lay hands on

1335
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:46,605
l have news for you

1336
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:49,212
Bharath Vision has
denounced both of you

1337
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:51,616
Vijaykumar presented it
on the late night report

1338
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:53,184
Tell this to her tomorrow

1339
01:44:53,754 --> 01:44:55,551
- lt's not over
- What else?

1340
01:44:55,922 --> 01:45:01,019
News from Delhi, yourjob
at Reuters has been terminated

1341
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:05,795
What else?

1342
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:07,967
Nothing much

1343
01:45:08,735 --> 01:45:12,330
Bharathan Pillai is being
considered for CM post

1344
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:17,608
The central committee is meeting
Swearing in may happen soon

1345
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:21,940
- Okay
- See you, dude

1346
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:33,315
Abu
These clothes are for them

1347
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:36,589
Da, give me those newspapers

1348
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:42,163
- These are clothes for both of you
- Thank you

1349
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:47,798
Here's your hearing aid

1350
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:12,730
Rishi, the original footage
is missing from the DSNG van

1351
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:15,901
Without that
how can we prove the truth?

1352
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:19,262
That's how they planned it
The screen play was fool-proof

1353
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:24,767
From the time we passed info
to the restaurant drama, a neat script!

1354
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:27,337
Written and directed
by Bharathan Pillai

1355
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:31,179
lf so, Rajan Kartha
must be the producer

1356
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,449
He's here in Kochi
since the last few days

1357
01:46:34,888 --> 01:46:37,322
Almost from the day
you came from Delhi

1358
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:42,056
Didn't you say, swearing in
of the CM will happen shortly?

1359
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:44,387
We have time
only till then, Rishi

1360
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:48,892
Now Sugunan must be
made to talk, isn't it?

1361
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:49,797
Yes

1362
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:56,705
Ouch!

1363
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:57,466
Oh mother!

1364
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,351
What happened?

1365
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:13,483
He hit me and took off
Some rascal!

1366
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:16,258
Aw, my hand

1367
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:17,887
Hey! Aren't you Sugunan sir?

1368
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:20,330
Just give me a hand, brother
Let's go to the hospital

1369
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:22,401
- Ouch my hand!
- Gently, take care

1370
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:32,438
- ls it still paining?
- No, it's better now

1371
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:37,347
Sir you are very smartly dressed
Don't you wear Khadi usually?

1372
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:41,715
lt is to avoid TV
Nuisance!

1373
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:49,393
Look! That's the vehicle that hit me

1374
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:51,761
Really?!
l'll find out right now

1375
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,494
Don't step out, you'll be recognized
l'll go find out

1376
01:48:01,341 --> 01:48:04,504
- What's all this?
- Exactly what we also want to know!

1377
01:48:05,912 --> 01:48:10,474
1st die, then come alive
Are you the Lasser of modern times?

1378
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,280
1st let him get over his shock
Then he'll talk, our Sugunan -Lasser

1379
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:14,183
Okay

1380
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:32,863
We saw you being killed

1381
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:35,806
We showed it to the public also
No confusion about this at all!

1382
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,269
But after some time
you reappeared alive

1383
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:40,369
- Public became confused
-And so did we

1384
01:48:40,914 --> 01:48:44,145
We are not going to clear that
We are going to increase it

1385
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:48,278
On the same place and rope
you will swing, hanging dead

1386
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:51,447
We'll shoot it very smartly
and show it to the public

1387
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:54,392
The public will go mad
What must they believe?

1388
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:57,123
l swear, l have not done
anything intentionally

1389
01:48:57,998 --> 01:49:00,398
l really thought
they were going to kill me

1390
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:09,533
l did tell Manilal, about the bribe
You guys flashed it, as hot news

1391
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:12,940
lt was only recently Pillai sir
came to know it was l who had informed

1392
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:20,351
l fell at his feet, cried begging his pardon
He asked me to pass 1 more info to Manilal

1393
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:24,022
That a murder would happen,
on behalf of Pillai sir

1394
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:27,225
After l did that,
he asked me to leave

1395
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:30,291
But the next day...

1396
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:41,272
Sugana, come with me
Bharathan Pillai sir, is asking for you

1397
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,344
Hello, take this

1398
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,274
What is it, sir?

1399
01:50:02,996 --> 01:50:04,520
What are you doing?

1400
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:06,962
Leave me

1401
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,067
What is it, sir

1402
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:10,595
Stop it!

1403
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:12,532
Don't harm me

1404
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:14,236
Didn't l confess everything, sir?

1405
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:18,476
Confession to the holy person
in a church will do you good

1406
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:22,572
But what's inside my chest
is not a holy heart, Suguna

1407
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:34,256
- Ready, sir
- Lift him now

1408
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:42,191
How is it?
lsn't it okay?

1409
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:50,266
Leave me, I say

1410
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:07,586
Go, hang him!

1411
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:25,000
After you left
they returned

1412
01:51:30,316 --> 01:51:36,084
Shibu, this is an antidote
Make him inhale it, he'll wake up

1413
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,658
They took me
to Pillai sir's house

1414
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:47,360
When people turned nasty
He asked me to come out

1415
01:51:50,603 --> 01:51:53,333
l was only a dupe sir, a dupe of
the person who was to be, actually killed

1416
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,202
Dupe?

1417
01:51:55,208 --> 01:52:00,510
ln that club house
there will be an actual murder

1418
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:02,739
ln the same place
almost in the same manner

1419
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:06,183
Who?
Who will it be?

1420
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:07,779
l don't know, sir

1421
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:14,082
But l know for sure
it's on the 12th night

1422
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:17,521
How do you know this?

1423
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:21,398
l heard Pillai sir's assistant
Varghese, tell my captors...

1424
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:24,499
...that they must leave the club house
as soon as the deed was done

1425
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:29,131
That their tickets have been booked
for the 2:00 AM train, on13th morning

1426
01:52:29,476 --> 01:52:32,377
That they should return, only after
Pillai sir, was sworn in, as Chief Minister

1427
01:52:36,282 --> 01:52:39,740
Abu, go drop Suguna
at the nearest hospital

1428
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:45,190
- Do you know who's going to die?
- No

1429
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:46,688
lt's you

1430
01:52:47,227 --> 01:52:50,196
Pillai wants to frame us
with that crime

1431
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:54,794
Don't try to run and escape
Even if you try, they won't allow you

1432
01:52:55,535 --> 01:52:57,059
Remember, we haven't met

1433
01:52:57,237 --> 01:53:00,331
We'll be there on the 12th
We want to shoot that event

1434
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:03,400
Go, don't be scared
Nothing will happen to you

1435
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,477
-Abu
- Yes, sir

1436
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:11,615
Here, ask that lawyer Manilal
to meet me before noon tomorrow

1437
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:13,343
He started all this, right?

1438
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:21,858
Mani, l have to see you urgently
Come tomorrow afternoon

1439
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:23,858
- What is it?
- l'll tell you

1440
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:27,765
We've found a way out of this mess
You have to stand by us

1441
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:28,726
Sure

1442
01:53:29,903 --> 01:53:31,393
- What did you think?
- Poor fellow

1443
01:53:31,838 --> 01:53:33,100
Yes

1444
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:37,374
He's a great actor, noticed his tears
without a drop of glycerin? Cheat!

1445
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:40,342
We did not get him, dude
Pillai threw him at us, a bait

1446
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:41,411
What are you saying?

1447
01:53:41,714 --> 01:53:44,205
lt's the next scene in
Pillai's frivolous drama

1448
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:51,784
Believing his story, Renuka and l will
go on 12th, to shoot the original murder

1449
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:57,159
Pillai, Kartha and their boys will wait
Because it is we who are going to die

1450
01:53:57,864 --> 01:53:58,660
Simple

1451
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:01,632
Gosh! This is getting
more and more complicated

1452
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:08,903
lf we remain free, they are clueless
as to the extent we'd go, to prove the truth

1453
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:13,542
So we have to be
eliminated forever

1454
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:18,342
They will make us, fugitives forever
Police, government and the media

1455
01:54:18,551 --> 01:54:22,453
We have no option but to go
to their butcher shop on 12th

1456
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:26,215
This is a trap for us, as well
as our only way to escape

1457
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:32,222
lf we win, we can regain all we lost
As well as ensure, Pillai's political funeral

1458
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:35,530
- lf you lose?
- Death

1459
01:54:36,736 --> 01:54:39,398
Like your usage, 'it seems'
they committed suicide

1460
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:49,611
On 12th we are shooting
the incident, whatever the risk

1461
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:52,277
Look at the irony of it

1462
01:54:52,385 --> 01:54:55,616
However priceless, this exclusive
we shoot now is, no channel will air it!

1463
01:54:55,788 --> 01:54:57,187
Except for his NBI

1464
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:58,918
Ours is a small channel...

1465
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:02,285
...if you intend giving it to some
gigantic one, please let me know

1466
01:55:02,862 --> 01:55:04,659
We don't have to trouble
ourselves unnecessarily

1467
01:55:06,866 --> 01:55:09,334
Only l will be going, to shoot this

1468
01:55:09,736 --> 01:55:10,862
What if l come?

1469
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:14,371
You want to sign-out, as usual
Just forthat, you needn't come

1470
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:16,971
This is an issue
involving my credibility

1471
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:20,574
l will come!
Whoever objects, l'll come!

1472
01:55:22,982 --> 01:55:24,643
Go, let me plan this out

1473
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:43,864
l have been tolerating
innuendos for last 3-4 days

1474
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:47,001
l don't want considerations
Nor do l even expect it

1475
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,466
You don't deserve it also

1476
01:55:49,742 --> 01:55:51,607
l don't need to
convince you of that

1477
01:55:52,378 --> 01:55:55,870
The 1 who was supposed to be
convinced, has never come forward

1478
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:57,812
l am not interested
in a reconciliation talk

1479
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:58,610
Me too

1480
01:55:58,685 --> 01:55:59,310
Then?

1481
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:01,386
This is a social issue
which involves me too

1482
01:56:01,554 --> 01:56:03,419
l cannot stay away
whatever you say

1483
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:05,582
This is to make you
stay away from death, you...!

1484
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:10,891
After all, he did have you
in his heart, for some time

1485
01:56:11,431 --> 01:56:13,797
He is now going
into the arena of death

1486
01:56:14,567 --> 01:56:18,697
- What?
- Nothing

1487
01:56:20,673 --> 01:56:23,437
Tell me, Rishi
What is happening?

1488
01:56:24,377 --> 01:56:27,278
lt's not Sugunan, who will die
lt will be you and Venu

1489
01:56:34,854 --> 01:56:36,253
Do you really want to go now?

1490
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:43,261
lf l don't go after knowing this
l won't exist anymore, Rishi

1491
01:56:48,434 --> 01:56:51,631
l thought we had time, that when
l get a chance, l could explain

1492
01:56:51,971 --> 01:56:56,067
l expected such a chance, when
l set out with him on this venture

1493
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:58,939
Since that is no longer a surety...

1494
01:56:59,045 --> 01:57:02,014
l'll tell you the truth,
l never betrayed you

1495
01:57:05,985 --> 01:57:09,477
That day, fearing the police
when Venu sent me off in the van

1496
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:16,391
l was on my way
to our...sorry, your studio

1497
01:57:17,096 --> 01:57:17,858
But...

1498
01:57:18,364 --> 01:57:21,993
Abu make it fast, its already 9:15 PM
lt has to be edited and aired by 10:00 PM

1499
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:25,060
Renu, be assured
l'll reach you there in 15 minutes

1500
01:57:38,684 --> 01:57:41,812
Mani! Success! l'm on my way
to the studio with the footage

1501
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:44,481
Renu l know, l was there nearby

1502
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,051
lt's all a mess now and Venu
has been caught by the police

1503
01:57:48,361 --> 01:57:49,885
Now, they'll soon be after you

1504
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:52,659
Aiyo!
Oh God!

1505
01:57:52,732 --> 01:58:00,070
l am right behind you, a black lnnova
Stop and get into my car, that will be safer

1506
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:02,704
-Abu, stop here
- Renu, time is...?

1507
01:58:02,809 --> 01:58:03,901
Abu, just stop!

1508
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:12,778
Get in, quick!

1509
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:20,782
Mani quickly, it has to be
aired at 10:00 PM

1510
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:31,862
Be on Bharath Vision's pay roll
and get the story for NBI Channel, eh?

1511
01:58:31,971 --> 01:58:35,771
But l am no longer your staff
l resigned 5 days back

1512
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:39,744
We've not got any such resignation
And even if there is, l've not accepted it

1513
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:42,375
Mani, stop! l want to get out

1514
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:47,579
He will not, because if he does
this footage will go to Bharathan Pillai

1515
01:58:47,653 --> 01:58:48,950
Drive us to the studio, dude!

1516
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:54,091
He has taken Rs 2 lakhs
from us for this story

1517
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:59,621
How can this become
NBI's launch story?

1518
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:03,465
My mistake sir, l didn't know
she had committed to NBI

1519
01:59:03,569 --> 01:59:07,130
l will return that money
today itself...sir, please!

1520
01:59:07,206 --> 01:59:09,572
That's all over
Nothing more to discuss

1521
01:59:09,675 --> 01:59:10,573
Sir, but...

1522
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:11,837
lt's not money alone

1523
01:59:11,911 --> 01:59:18,612
Once you did this story, he'd bargained
and fixed senior editor's post for you

1524
01:59:18,684 --> 01:59:21,551
Mani, l don't want any post
Get me that footage back

1525
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:27,058
This will come only in NBI

1526
01:59:27,927 --> 01:59:29,121
lt will not

1527
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:32,824
lt can come in any other
channel, but never NBI

1528
01:59:32,932 --> 01:59:36,197
l am sitting in the chair
Rishi discarded and left

1529
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:42,532
How can l let this explosive
story, be launched by Rishi?

1530
01:59:43,643 --> 01:59:47,773
Mani, forthem it's channel war
To me it's a question of trust and my life

1531
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:51,441
Mani please, tomorrow
Venu and l are getting married

1532
01:59:51,751 --> 01:59:52,877
Sir, please!

1533
01:59:52,952 --> 01:59:54,783
You don't talk anymore

1534
01:59:56,055 --> 01:59:59,115
l will not air this
without your permission

1535
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:03,957
But l'll use this to
make sure NBI is not born

1536
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:08,088
Simple, l'll just hand this overto Pillai

1537
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:14,996
NBI will remain, a dream to Rishi
And Venu is in police custody

1538
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:18,805
l won't be able to even guess
in what state, he will return

1539
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:23,478
You have time till
Pillai attends this call

1540
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:27,882
Sir, no
l beg you

1541
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,511
Sir, it's her future
that will be affected

1542
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:33,823
- Hello?
- ls it Bharathan Pillai?

1543
02:00:34,093 --> 02:00:35,617
Yes

1544
02:00:36,662 --> 02:00:37,151
Sir...

1545
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,033
l became 'all alone
in one single night'

1546
02:00:46,672 --> 02:00:54,169
With nothing left, l had only
Bharath Vision, as an option for survival

1547
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:59,544
Renu, 5 years you have...

1548
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,016
Oh God!

1549
02:01:03,222 --> 02:01:06,157
- Venu must be told...
- Don't, Rishi

1550
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:09,789
He must not know this now
He won't take me along otherwise

1551
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:14,791
l know his concern, for people
he cares for, please don't tell him

1552
02:01:16,902 --> 02:01:17,596
Okay, l won't

1553
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:43,057
What is that secret meet there?

1554
02:01:43,162 --> 02:01:45,096
Will that she-devil
betray us, in this also?

1555
02:01:45,164 --> 02:01:47,632
Da! Don't be so mean

1556
02:01:49,068 --> 02:01:51,730
Are you on her side or mine?

1557
02:01:53,606 --> 02:01:55,369
This is why we say
you should also be there

1558
02:01:55,908 --> 02:01:59,207
Your cousin is risking
her life for this

1559
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:01,644
Convince her not to,
she refuses to listen to me

1560
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:02,840
Venu, is there
some other way out?

1561
02:02:02,948 --> 02:02:03,937
You tell us

1562
02:02:04,016 --> 02:02:05,745
Mani, let Venu explain

1563
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:09,086
Today is the 10th
Day aftertomorrow, it is12th

1564
02:02:09,922 --> 02:02:13,722
Only if we convincingly shoot
our act, that we are going to die...

1565
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:16,226
...Pillai and Kartha's
intentions can be proved

1566
02:02:16,896 --> 02:02:18,363
But how and who will shoot this?

1567
02:02:18,898 --> 02:02:22,129
lt's impossible to shoot in
the club house or surroundings

1568
02:02:22,234 --> 02:02:22,996
Then?

1569
02:02:23,803 --> 02:02:24,735
Come, l'll explain

1570
02:02:25,404 --> 02:02:29,340
500 meters away, that is
half a kilometer away, on top...

1571
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:33,242
...of the pavilion, cameras with
telescopic lenses, will be set up

1572
02:02:34,013 --> 02:02:35,742
Rishi's camera crew
will operate them

1573
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:41,215
Pretending to cover Sugunan's murder
we will reach the club house, on12th night

1574
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,417
We'll get surrounded by them
and a little struggle will ensue

1575
02:02:43,656 --> 02:02:47,092
A little action sequence by me
And finally, we get caught

1576
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,761
lf Kartha comes, we can
expect a cinema style dialog

1577
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,694
l'll have a voice recorder in my pocket

1578
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:55,699
After shooting what we want
you and Abu should interfere

1579
02:02:55,768 --> 02:02:57,861
Don't delay my friend,
or we'll never come out alive!

1580
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:58,900
l agree, sir

1581
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:00,632
Can l tell you what l fear?

1582
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:02,867
Those who fear need not come
Didn't l warn you?

1583
02:03:02,942 --> 02:03:04,807
Let her tell her opinion

1584
02:03:06,712 --> 02:03:07,178
Yes, Renu?

1585
02:03:07,246 --> 02:03:09,874
ln case we are not able
to pull this off, Pillai and Kartha...

1586
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:13,248
...will escape for ever
We can't take a chance

1587
02:03:13,986 --> 02:03:16,819
That is what l'm also coming to, silly

1588
02:03:19,492 --> 02:03:22,256
- This will not be exclusive to NBI
- What?

1589
02:03:22,862 --> 02:03:26,662
We will allow 2 more channels
to shoot, without our involvement

1590
02:03:26,732 --> 02:03:27,824
That's why l asked,
Manilal also to come

1591
02:03:27,933 --> 02:03:28,957
Go climb a wall!!!

1592
02:03:29,101 --> 02:03:31,797
lt's impossible!
This is exclusive to NBI

1593
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:32,268
Dude?

1594
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:36,707
Don't say 'no'! l've pinned all my hopes
on this and planned a lot for its success

1595
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:38,776
Does our friendship have
the value of, just an exclusive?

1596
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:41,472
l have not gained anything
with this friendship, l've only lost

1597
02:03:43,783 --> 02:03:48,049
- l will do this story alone, if not...
- lf not...?

1598
02:03:48,854 --> 02:03:51,322
lf not, don't expect
anything more from me

1599
02:03:55,227 --> 02:03:59,095
Then so be it!
You are not doing this story

1600
02:04:08,841 --> 02:04:09,865
Abu! Start the vehicle

1601
02:04:09,942 --> 02:04:10,704
Rishi!

1602
02:04:12,978 --> 02:04:14,036
Didn't you hear me?

1603
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,405
You can take it yourself, sir

1604
02:04:19,819 --> 02:04:21,252
Rishi? Please!

1605
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:36,765
ls your father dead? Everybody
thinks only of their own benefits

1606
02:04:36,836 --> 02:04:41,034
This is not the 1st time
Abu can operate my camera

1607
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:45,768
Lawyer Mani, 12th is day after tomorrow
Tomorrow we set up camera at the stadium

1608
02:04:45,878 --> 02:04:48,312
Fix up a couple of more
channels and let me know

1609
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:16,201
Park it near the north of the stadium
When it gets dark, we'll be there

1610
02:05:56,215 --> 02:06:01,448
Abu, don't wait, it'll take time
Come only when l call you

1611
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,612
Okay, sir

1612
02:07:05,417 --> 02:07:08,386
- What is it?
-A mosquito

1613
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:10,419
Mosquito?!

1614
02:07:37,349 --> 02:07:40,648
This is field limit, whatever happens
don't move away from this limit

1615
02:07:41,086 --> 02:07:43,646
Find all possibilities and fix the limit

1616
02:08:10,749 --> 02:08:13,946
- Venu, there's a car!
- l saw it too, you useless!

1617
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:41,676
Bharathan Pillai!

1618
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:12,277
Rishi has cheated us
lt's not what we thought, lets escape

1619
02:09:12,344 --> 02:09:13,276
Be quiet girl!

1620
02:09:32,164 --> 02:09:35,827
Venu, it will happen today!

1621
02:09:36,301 --> 02:09:39,168
The camera is gone
Now what's the point?

1622
02:09:39,338 --> 02:09:41,738
Whatever happens
you won't die, enough?

1623
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:51,640
Without getting into trouble
come with me, you shrew!

1624
02:10:12,337 --> 02:10:16,330
l was in a hurry to die sir
So, l came here today itself

1625
02:10:17,776 --> 02:10:22,543
There lies your camera, how will you
shoot and show it to the public now?

1626
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:51,471
Call that lawyer
Call Manilal

1627
02:11:06,959 --> 02:11:08,256
Call that lawyer!

1628
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:48,894
Don't!

1629
02:11:53,005 --> 02:11:55,940
Take it away, there mustn't be
even a small scratch on the body

1630
02:11:56,208 --> 02:12:00,577
They have to be hanged
Not murdered but as suicide

1631
02:12:01,947 --> 02:12:05,212
Why do you need a binocular
camera to shoot such a near event?

1632
02:12:05,317 --> 02:12:10,414
Not binoculars, a microscope
is enough for a worm like you

1633
02:13:28,433 --> 02:13:29,559
What are you glaring at?

1634
02:13:29,668 --> 02:13:32,933
Where are your contraptions
witnesses, 2-3 channels, etc?

1635
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:37,332
People ready to jump to save you
from death, where the hell are they?

1636
02:13:37,743 --> 02:13:40,644
When you sent him away
l knew, you'd smelt trouble

1637
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:42,509
Stop lecturing and call that punk

1638
02:13:42,581 --> 02:13:45,880
Pillai waves from 1 .5 KM away
and now hiding in the kitchen

1639
02:13:45,951 --> 02:13:46,883
l'll give you a sound sla-!

1640
02:14:02,768 --> 02:14:03,860
Why should l hide, Venu?

1641
02:14:04,436 --> 02:14:05,698
lt's you who are still in hiding

1642
02:14:05,771 --> 02:14:09,036
Venu, Manilal is trapped
l heard his phone ringing

1643
02:14:09,141 --> 02:14:10,438
He's here somewhere

1644
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:15,339
Lawyer, don't hide
Come into the arena, you pig

1645
02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:21,516
Come out! lt'll be awkward only
if have to see them, ever again

1646
02:14:29,961 --> 02:14:30,985
Son of a mongrel!

1647
02:14:33,865 --> 02:14:38,962
l don't have any cinema dialog
l will go away after just 1 , okay?

1648
02:14:39,438 --> 02:14:43,101
This is not revenge, if it was
l'd have had time, only for that in life

1649
02:14:44,009 --> 02:14:48,946
This isjust a precaution!
Allow me to rule and live peacefully, dude

1650
02:14:49,014 --> 02:14:55,044
Taking cameras into people's bedroom,
bathroom and calling it media activism!

1651
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:57,521
This is the only medicine
for all that, okay?

1652
02:14:57,656 --> 02:15:01,717
2 media persons who've lost
credibility and life, commit suicide

1653
02:15:02,561 --> 02:15:03,425
Shall l hang them, sir?

1654
02:15:04,629 --> 02:15:07,359
Do you have anything to say?

1655
02:15:07,799 --> 02:15:14,932
l don't, but she has...a sign-off
After all we are going to die, right?

1656
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:17,705
Go ahead!
Look somewhere and say it

1657
02:15:27,686 --> 02:15:32,385
From the place of events
this is Renuka with cameraman Venu

1658
02:15:32,524 --> 02:15:33,752
More cameras?

1659
02:15:36,761 --> 02:15:41,562
lf there are cameras here
ask your people to bash them up

1660
02:15:41,666 --> 02:15:44,863
Don't panic, these are
last minute tactics to escape

1661
02:15:44,936 --> 02:15:45,903
Hang them both!

1662
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:56,147
Freeze!

1663
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:20,070
-Are we on time?
- Perfectly on time!

1664
02:16:24,743 --> 02:16:26,973
What other contraptions
do you want to see?

1665
02:16:27,612 --> 02:16:30,206
Open your eyes wide and look!

1666
02:16:30,849 --> 02:16:31,816
Lights on!

1667
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:34,946
See, how many cameras!

1668
02:16:45,797 --> 02:16:48,027
No other channel
Only NBI

1669
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,694
Because, this is
an exclusive for his channel

1670
02:16:56,007 --> 02:16:56,769
Arrest them

1671
02:16:57,042 --> 02:17:00,205
Lawyer, when Rishi stormed off
angrily, what did you think?

1672
02:17:00,312 --> 02:17:01,643
That we had parted ways?

1673
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,015
He had ajob here
which needed 24 hrs

1674
02:17:06,952 --> 02:17:09,853
When l learnt that it was you
who had fixed up a story for her...

1675
02:17:09,955 --> 02:17:13,652
...at Bharath Vision, l knew
it was you, who was their pimp

1676
02:17:20,632 --> 02:17:23,123
You want to give him a couple?
