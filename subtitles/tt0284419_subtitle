3
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:50,183
Father! Father!

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,664
Janaki! Janaki! Janaki!

5
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:02,970
Lord! Lord!

6
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,010
- Where did you get her from?
- From the temple.

7
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,514
- Her parents?
- Her father was an old, blind priest over there.

8
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,770
The poor man died.

9
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,970
Did he die or did you...

10
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,010
How much will you charge for her?

11
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,370
Not charge, Pannabai. I
will take rupees for her.

12
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:36,730
- A total of 1000 rupees.
- I will give you 300.

13
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,530
You can't fool me, Pannabai.
I will take her to Hirabai.

14
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:45,740
I will give you 500 rupees.
Not a penny more than that.

15
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,930
- Give me.
- Here.

16
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,170
Count them.

17
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:53,650
And remember, if you ever
inquire about the girl...

18
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,690
I will give your
name to the police.

19
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,302
Don't worry, Pannabai.

20
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,907
I don't act in a way that
might get me to the police.

21
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:08,745
I hope you will recall me when
this bud blooms in a flower.

22
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:14,637
Mangal, charity begins at home.

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,800
May God bless you, Pannabai!

24
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:35,930
If you don't know how to
put bangles on someone...

25
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:37,970
why do you deal in bangles?

26
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,730
Only for you. So that I can
meet you and talk to you.

27
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:49,053
These bangles are broken, but
my hands are still empty.

28
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:54,630
Just as your forehead, your hair
and your life is also empty.

29
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,992
What are you up to, Ramesh?

30
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,176
Have you worn Janaki the bangles?

31
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:03,636
You've broken so many bangles?

32
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,771
You bring poor quality bangles
these days, Ramesh.

33
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:10,144
Not poor quality, they are
as delicate as my heart.

34
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,736
Just a small push, and
they break down.

35
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:17,096
You also get pushed, Ramesh?

36
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:20,766
Don't talk too much, and wear
my dear child the bangles.

37
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,176
I am still to get her
ready like a bride.

38
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,457
Today is her show; many
rich people will come.

39
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:31,336
Sir, Janaki misses you very much.
She's cried her eyes out.

40
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,416
Won't you come to meet her?

41
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,010
Sister is coming! Hide somewhere.

42
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,496
Not here; behind the sofa.

43
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:45,841
- What's this? - What?
- You're again going on hunting?

44
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:50,262
Sister, I am a Thakur. Will I play
cricket instead of hunting?

45
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:52,262
You haven't hunted down
even a sparrow till now.

46
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,353
I missed my shots till now.
But today I won't.

47
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,638
Come back early in the evening.

48
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:58,925
Or your brother in
law will be angry.

49
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,062
Sister, I don't fear
when you are with me.

50
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:03,142
Please, convince brother in law.

51
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,222
Come out!

52
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,395
- Here, take these 10 rupees...
- 10 rupees?

53
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:10,822
Don't make noise. Give
it to Pannabai...

54
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,902
and tell her that I
am coming this evening.

55
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,462
Go! Go fast!

56
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,502
What's this? Who's he?

57
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,862
Sir, he might have come with
a message from Pannabai.

58
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,662
That means Vikram still goes
at Pannabai's brothel.

59
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,253
Yes, sir, he hasn't yet
stopped visiting her.

60
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,942
It should be stopped, Munimii.

61
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,088
Go to Pannabai today
and tell her that...

62
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:52,086
if she allows Vikram
to enter her brothel...

63
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,443
- we won't let her live in this city.
- Yes.

64
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,982
Wow! What beauty!

65
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:33,503
'How do I come to meet you, dear? '

66
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:39,943
'How do I come to meet you, dear? '

67
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,370
'How do I get out of the house? '

68
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:46,503
'Look! Look! Look! '

69
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:52,263
'How do I come to meet you, dear? '

70
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:55,039
'How do I get out of the house? '

71
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:58,931
'Look! Look! Look! '

72
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:06,823
'I get scared after
walking a few steps'

73
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:11,143
'Look! Look! Look! '

74
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:36,503
'In an unfamiliar street.'

75
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,382
'... I was waiting with
my drape off my head'

76
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,823
'In an unfamiliar street.'

77
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:49,823
'... I was waiting with
my drape off my head'

78
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:58,463
'My body was dancing like
a flame burning all night'

79
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:02,463
'Look! Look! Look! '

80
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:10,143
'I get scared after
walking a few steps'

81
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:14,310
'Look! Look! Look! '

82
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,903
'These wretched bangles speak.'

83
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:43,749
'... that my beloved laughs at me'

84
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:48,983
'These wretched bangles speak.'

85
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,343
'... that my beloved laughs at me'

86
00:09:54,499 --> 00:10:01,463
'These Ghoonghroos prick
my leg like thorns'

87
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:05,463
'Look! Look! Look! '

88
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:09,589
'How do I come to meet you, dear? '

89
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,503
'How do I get out of the house? '

90
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,823
'Look! Look! Look! '

91
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:25,503
'I get scared after
walking a few steps'

92
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:29,704
'Look! Look! Look! '

93
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:59,503
Dear, sir, what has displeased you?

94
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:03,023
You know that I've come
here to hear her sing...

95
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,103
not to get myself insulted,
and that, too...

96
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,122
by some ordinary man.

97
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:10,383
This isn't an insult.
This is the style of a lover.

98
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:14,543
She attracts her lover with
some jealousy and agony.

99
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,223
Look, Pannabai, you know that...

100
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,423
I've been crazy after
Janaki for long.

101
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,943
And you also know that I
have the first right...

102
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:27,743
over whichever new girl
comes to the market.

103
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:31,551
Why not, sir? But you
also know that...

104
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,463
there are millions of
lovers of a prostitute.

105
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:38,349
But that guy is the luckiest
whom the prostitute loves.

106
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,023
And that lucky one is you.

107
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,181
Really, Pannabai?

108
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,421
Then Janaki should be sent...

109
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,503
to my bungalow near the
lake tomorrow night.

110
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:49,932
- She will reach there, sir. But there's one point.
- What?

111
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:53,903
Such a priceless flower
blooms once in years.

112
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,865
And its price is what one
asks for. Got it, sir?

113
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:01,196
We are ancestrally rich, Pannabai.

114
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,988
We understand such points at once.

115
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,669
Will thousand rupees
for a month be fine?

116
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,272
What are you saying, sir?

117
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,232
1000 rupees a month will only
be for smelling its fragrance.

118
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,082
What about its beauty, color,
youth and style?

119
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:18,272
I will take 5000 rupees
for all that.

120
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,192
Very good, Pannabai.

121
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:23,143
Janaki has robbed my heart;
you rob my money.

122
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:24,552
I'm robbed!

123
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,472
My place is only at your feet, Lord.

124
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:32,712
I've been offering you
flowers of my dignity.

125
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:36,072
I won't let that dignity be robbed.

126
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:40,592
Before my dignity gets robbed,
take my life away, Lord.

127
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:45,323
Pannabai!

128
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:55,484
- Is Pannabai here?
- She's inside.

129
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,523
Tell her that Munshi Dindayal
has come to meet her.

130
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,523
Please, have a seat.
I will call her out.

131
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:08,204
- Pannabai! - Tell me.
- I agree to all that you say.

132
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,138
I'll leave now. I will eagerly
wait for Janaki tomorrow.

133
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:15,724
- Aunt Panna!
- Who? Janaki?

134
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:19,324
Speak! Speak!

135
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:22,366
Aunt, Munshi Dindayal
has come to meet you.

136
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,607
Munimii? Why did that
wretched come here?

137
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,884
Pannabai, do something.

138
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:35,324
Don't worry. Go out by the back
door and I'll handle the rest.

139
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,764
Come with me. Come.

140
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:46,562
My house is graced today!
How come you're here?

141
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,804
Where is Vikramsingh?

142
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:51,890
Who? Thakur Viredrasingh's
brother in law?

143
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,588
I refused him to come her...

144
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:57,084
the same day you told
me the orders of Thakur.

145
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,364
Don't lie, Pannabai. Vikramsingh
comes here.

146
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,364
And he is present here
at this moment.

147
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,754
Girl, you tell me, is
Vikramsingh here?

148
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:13,358
Believe me, Munshiji. I've stopped
him to come here for good.

149
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,849
We singers go to Thakur's
place to pay him respects.

150
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:20,649
How can we dare to
disobey his orders?

151
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:24,427
Vikramsingh is not here. You can
search my house if you want.

152
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:30,289
Pannabai, I am warning
you the last time.

153
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,449
If Vikramsingh doesn't
stop coming here...

154
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,329
this brothel of yours will
be shut down for good.

155
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:37,649
Remember that.

156
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,553
You! Would it have bothered
you if you...

157
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,598
had said that Vikramsingh
does not come here?

158
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,473
How could I lie?

159
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,215
You think yourself
to be sati Savitri?

160
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:59,505
I've spent all my earnings
to bring you up.

161
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,899
And now when it's time to
recover it, you act smart?

162
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,082
I've already made a deal
with someone for you.

163
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,179
You will have to go to Vikramsingh
tomorrow. Got it?

164
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,459
You're so strange, Munshiji.

165
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,339
If Vikramsingh was at
Pannabai's place...

166
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,299
why didn't you drag him back here?

167
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,507
Don't you realize that
his habit defames us?

168
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,219
Who says that Vikram goes
to Pannabai's brothel?

169
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,606
Munshiji, do you have some
enmity with my brother?

170
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,446
What are you saying, madam?

171
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,314
Then what will you gain
by defaming him?

172
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,421
Munshiji is just doing his duty...

173
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:34,581
Munshiji said that and
you believed him!

174
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,244
That poor boy had gone for
hunting since the morning.

175
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:39,572
- Had gone on hunting?
- Yes, I'll call him.

176
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,056
- Vikram!
- Yes, sister?

177
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:45,014
What is it?

178
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:46,741
What were you saying, Munshiji?

179
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,501
He had really gone on hunting.

180
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,021
Very good, brother in law.

181
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:52,021
You're wearing clothes of hunters...

182
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,341
but perhaps you did
that in hurry, right?

183
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,301
You're holding a shoe in hand,
the button's undone...

184
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,402
No, the button is done.

185
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,657
- What have you killed?
- Killed?

186
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,010
Yes, you had gone hunting, right?

187
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,781
Yes, but I had to come empty
hand today, brother in law.

188
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,152
Such a pity! You've been
hunting since many days...

189
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,176
but you've not caught a
single animal till date.

190
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,541
The thing is, brother in law, I've
been after a deer for many days.

191
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:14,849
I'll shoot her tomorrow.

192
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:17,560
Brother, if you were a real hunter...

193
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,204
you would know that a hunter
never kills a female, but only males.

194
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,401
Yes, yes, I know that.

195
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,283
Well, whichever deer
you kill tomorrow...

196
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,181
I will come along
to see your shot.

197
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:30,101
Yes, sure, sure. But brother,
that jungle is very dangerous.

198
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,741
- That means I should not go with you.
- No.

199
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:36,997
- Come, Vikram. - Wait!
- Do I also wait, brother in law?

200
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:39,301
You can go.

201
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,181
You can also go, Munshiji.

202
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,159
Come.

203
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,217
Sit.

204
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,101
Do you still think that
Munshiji is lying?

205
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,048
Listen, Ratna, everyone loves ones
own people, but not like this.

206
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,649
Your love has spoiled him
and made him a bad person.

207
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,648
Don't know what will
he be in future.

208
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,899
- I know you don't like Vikram.
- No... no...

209
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,968
What else? If I had kids,
why would he stay here?

210
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,807
- He has everything in life.
- What do you mean?

211
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,168
You're getting defamed because of
him. He will not stay here anymore.

212
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,848
- I will tell him to go...
- Wait! Wait!

213
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,145
If you've felt bad, I won't say
anything to Vikram from now on.

214
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:28,648
Are you happy now?

215
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:32,088
I am ready to lose anything
for your happiness.

216
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,048
Just tell him to keep in mind
my prestige. That's it.

217
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,168
- I will tell him.
- Look at me and say that.

218
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:43,048
I will talk to him right now.

219
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:48,768
Look, Janaki, if you dare
to displease Vikramsingh...

220
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,688
I am Pannabai, got it?

221
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,048
You've brought me up like
your daughter, auntie.

222
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,448
Please, don't ruin my life.

223
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:02,568
I will serve you by singing
and dancing all my life.

224
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:05,648
I will survive on two
pieces of bread.

225
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:07,128
Stop blabbering!

226
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,512
You should be happy that...

227
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:10,972
a rich man like Vikramsingh
is crazy after you.

228
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:14,289
You will live like a queen.
You will live luxuriously.

229
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,172
It is better to die...

230
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:20,115
than live luxuriously after
selling your dignity.

231
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,932
Shut up! Think yourself
to be a decent girl?

232
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,969
Sit here and wait for Vikramsingh.

233
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,908
I am going, and will take
you back in the morning.

234
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:31,853
No, no, auntie. I beg of you;
don't leave me in this hell.

235
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:35,732
- I won't stay here.
- How will you not stay? Let go of me.

236
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,732
You won't stay here?

237
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:45,674
Aunt Panna! Aunt Panna!

238
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:53,009
- Pannabai!
- Yes, sir? - You are wonderful.

239
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,652
- Where is my darling?
- She's waiting for you inside.

240
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:03,658
Here, take this 5000 rupees;
it's your price.

241
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,612
And this 5000 is the salary
of Janaki, in advance.

242
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,164
Thank you very much, sir.

243
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,292
Pannabai, you can go now.

244
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,367
Driver! Drop Pannabai at her home.

245
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:27,700
'Without you, o darling,
nothing interests me'

246
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,692
'Without you.'

247
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:34,772
Have you locked the
door from inside?

248
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:39,892
Doesn't matter. I know
how to come in.

249
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:44,852
You helped Draupadi once
when she was in trouble.

250
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,572
You will have to protect me today.

251
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:52,372
I will die, but I will not
let anyone touch my body.

252
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:55,092
You?

253
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:59,852
What will he know, darling?
Look here.

254
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:04,252
A living Kanhaiya is standing
in front of you.

255
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:07,243
Whatever you want,
ask from me, dear.

256
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:09,452
- Come here.
- Don't touch me!

257
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:14,372
Pannabai has just taken 10
thousand rupees from me.

258
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:19,732
I've bought the rights to
touch you. Come and hug me.

259
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:25,052
- Scoundrel!
- No, lover has ever slapped me.

260
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:31,507
Here, slap me again. Slap, but
don't make me wait, dear.

261
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,904
Let go of me!

262
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,440
Leave...

263
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:42,986
Help!

264
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:52,394
Let me go! Let me go!

265
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,713
Lord, help me!

266
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,299
No... listen... no fighting...

267
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,572
Don't hit me.

268
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:22,304
Is anyone there? Get hold of him.

269
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,012
Catch this man.

270
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,892
Hit him hard and break his bones.

271
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,411
Where will you escape now, dear?

272
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:21,147
O God!

273
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:49,132
Scream now! Call him!

274
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:51,030
Ramesh!

275
00:22:54,926 --> 00:23:01,355
- No, I won't go. I won't go.
- How won't you?

276
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,212
She's gone!

277
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,372
Idler! Do you pay you
every month for this?

278
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:30,052
Aren't you ashamed to get
beaten by a poor man?

279
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,772
Curse you!

280
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,932
When I saw you at Pannabai's place...

281
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,612
don't know why but I felt
sympathy towards you.

282
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:46,372
But after listening to your story,
I am ready to help you.

283
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,212
That's why we've come
to you, Munshiji.

284
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:52,453
Today I've saved Janaki
from Vikram...

285
00:23:53,152 --> 00:23:55,333
but he won't rest till
he revenges for that.

286
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:57,093
He's a rich man.

287
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:01,093
Don't worry about Vikram.
I only want to know...

288
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:03,013
whether you really love Janaki.

289
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:09,037
I not only love her, Munshiji,
I can give my life for her.

290
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,411
Despite knowing that she's been
brought up by Pannabai?

291
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,271
Munshiji, river Ganga also flows
through so many places.

292
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,151
And so many dirty creeks
get place in her waters.

293
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,031
And yet its holiness
is never at threat.

294
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:25,951
When do you want to marry Janaki?

295
00:24:26,638 --> 00:24:27,911
As soon as possible.

296
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:30,911
All right, you both stay
at my place for tonight.

297
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,471
I will get you married tomorrow.

298
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:34,551
Munshiji?

299
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,770
Don't worry, Pannabai. No one
can dare question Vikram.

300
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:44,031
I will smash that bangle
man. Like this.

301
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:48,743
- Munshiji?
- What happened?

302
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:53,550
Pannabai, we cannot get Janaki
now. Let's go back.

303
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:56,301
Coward! Get out of my way.

304
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,361
This marriage cannot take place!

305
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,436
This marriage is already
done, Pannabai.

306
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:07,602
If you create any nuisance,
I will get you all in jail.

307
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,156
Thakur? Why have you come here?

308
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,889
I've come to congratulate
the groom and the bride.

309
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:21,196
To congratulate? I see.
Come. Please, come.

310
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:25,996
Bless you. May God always
keep you happy!

311
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:32,267
Congratulations to both of you!
And to you, too, Munshiji.

312
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,507
Vikram, what are you doing?

313
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:49,580
Has anyone said you anything...

314
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,340
that you are displeased
and are leaving?

315
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:53,848
Why don't you speak?

316
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:56,903
What do I say, sister? If
I live in this house...

317
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:59,264
people say that I am at the
mercy of my brother in law.

318
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,236
That mere Munshiji is respected
here, but not me.

319
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:04,533
How can you be compared to Munshiji?

320
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:06,900
Munshiji is our servant,
but you are my brother.

321
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:10,243
Listen, sister! If Munshi
stays here, I will not.

322
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,780
Why do you get upset,
brother in law?

323
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,631
- I will get him out right away, but on one condition.
- What?

324
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:22,942
- What's his fault?
- Brother in law, his fault is...

325
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:25,991
- Yes, tell me...
- Speak! Why don't you tell him?

326
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,068
- The fault is that...
- I will tell you, Ratna.

327
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:34,096
The thing is that the female
deer he wanted to shoot...

328
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,831
- Female deer?
- Yes, Munshiji has let her run away.

329
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:39,127
You're a Thakur and yet you
fired on a female deer?

330
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:40,082
Weren't you ashamed?

331
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:42,706
If you must shoot, couldn't you
shoot a lion or a cheetah?

332
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:43,791
Sure! Sure!

333
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:44,801
But, brother in law...

334
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,553
Your secret will be disclosed.

335
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,591
Better take out your clothes
from this bag...

336
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,191
and put them back in the wardrobe.

337
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:55,591
- What are you staring at? Take it.
- Go.

338
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:00,311
- How innocent he is, isn't he?
- Yes.

339
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,412
Thank God I have only
one brother in law.

340
00:27:02,492 --> 00:27:05,551
If I had two, what might
happen to me? Come.

341
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,791
- Give.
- Eat fast while the food is hot.

342
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:15,871
You also sit here. I can't
eat a bite without you.

343
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:30,151
- Is Ramesh home?
- I'll see who's come.

344
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:34,751
- Munshiji? Please, come.
- How are you, sister?

345
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,387
- Greetings. - Greetings.
- Please, have something.

346
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:39,987
I am fasting today. You carry on.

347
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:42,043
- Please sit.
- Today I was passing by this street...

348
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:44,747
so I thought I might
as well meet you both.

349
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,867
I hope Vikram or Pannabai
are not troubling you.

350
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,427
- Not till now.
- Good.

351
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:54,387
Sometimes we wonder, how will
we repay this favor of yours?

352
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:58,034
Someday... Ramesh, what's the matter?

353
00:27:58,114 --> 00:28:00,347
- Why are you holding your stomach?
- Nothing.

354
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:03,227
Munshiji, he gets such stomachaches
many times.

355
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,707
It pains him, but he does
not care to visit a doctor.

356
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,707
It's not good to be so
careless about health.

357
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,507
Promise me in front of Munshiji
that you'll go to a doctor.

358
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:14,747
Hold him... lift him. Let's
take him to the bed.

359
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:17,307
I will call the doctor.

360
00:28:19,418 --> 00:28:21,786
Don't worry. I will
call the doctor, right away.

361
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:30,187
- Thakur!
- Doctor, I hope there's nothing to worry about.

362
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:32,747
It's not a matter to worry,
but to be happy.

363
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:33,947
You mean?

364
00:28:34,027 --> 00:28:35,827
That means whether you
have a boy or a girl...

365
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:37,867
don't forget to
send me the sweets.

366
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:40,422
Boy or... what are
you saying, doctor?

367
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,387
- Is Ratna going to be a mother?
- Yes.

368
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:44,605
- Really, doctor?
- Yes. - Keep lying, Ratna.

369
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:48,184
- Congratulations. God has granted your wish after many years.
- Yes.

370
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:50,827
- Have patience, dear. I'll be off now.
- Ok.

371
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:54,987
Doctor, I didn't expect it.
So many years after our wedding...

372
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,507
Ratna, did you hear
what the doctor said?

373
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,367
It has been 15 years
to our marriage.

374
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:02,187
We had lost hope of having a baby.

375
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,067
- God never lets anyone down.
- Yes.

376
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:08,107
- He has heard our prayers after all.
- Congratulations!

377
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:10,347
Congratulations, sister.
Congratulations, brother.

378
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:13,200
- I am also going to be a Mama.
- Mama?

379
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,987
Didn't get it? Double Ma, that
is Mama (maternal uncle).

380
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,107
Don't sit, brother in law.

381
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,787
Let us be alone on this
occasion of joy.

382
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:23,867
Got it. So that you can
have a romantic chat?

383
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,227
Yes, that's it.

384
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,227
Close the door.

385
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,707
What's the matter, sir? Why
do you look so tensed?

386
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:42,313
What do I tell you, Munshiji.

387
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:43,763
She was unconscious
when she gave birth...

388
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:44,987
and the baby was born dead.

389
00:29:45,524 --> 00:29:47,437
Doctor said that Ratna
is in a critical state.

390
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:48,810
I fear I might lose her.

391
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,587
Don't say that, sir.

392
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:52,187
I've given her the medicine.

393
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:54,361
She'll regain consciousness
by 8 or 9 o'clock.

394
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:57,147
But take care, Thakur, that
you don't tell her...

395
00:29:57,227 --> 00:30:00,027
about the baby till
she is conscious.

396
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,147
But we will have to
tell her, doctor.

397
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,507
That might put her life to danger.

398
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:07,387
We will have to hide this
matter from her...

399
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:09,547
till she is completely all right.

400
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,667
It's not that easy, doctor.

401
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,474
Ratna became a mother...

402
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:16,323
after 15 years, and that,
too, of a dead child.

403
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,610
What will we answer when she asks?

404
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,371
Don't be tensed, Thakur.
Come with me, please.

405
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,506
Ratna!

406
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:41,546
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes.

407
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:43,426
Try to sleep.

408
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,986
What happened, Ratna?

409
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:48,864
My baby... where is the child?

410
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:52,378
The child is with the nurse
in the other room.

411
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,106
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I did.

412
00:30:56,746 --> 00:31:00,140
He's beautiful, healthy...

413
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,568
- Bring him to me.
- Yes.

414
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:08,774
- Go... go...
- The child might be asleep now...

415
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:10,586
or the nurse would have
brought him here.

416
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,146
And the doctor has said
that you need rest.

417
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,948
See the child tomorrow morning.

418
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,706
No, I will see him now.

419
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:20,026
Ratna, what's the hurry?
See him later.

420
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:25,957
You won't get it. I can't rest till
I see him. Please, bring him.

421
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,346
Why don't you go?

422
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,114
I will neither go nor
bring the child.

423
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:36,066
Doctor has said that you
are ill and need rest.

424
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,906
Ok, I will talk to the nurse myself.

425
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,666
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

426
00:31:40,746 --> 00:31:43,683
Let go of me! There
surely is something...

427
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,242
because of which you don't
want to show me the child.

428
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:48,426
- No, it's not that, Ratna.
- I will see the child right now.

429
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,546
I will hug him and love him.

430
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:53,786
Please, for God's sake,
show me my child.

431
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,544
How do I show you the child?
Actually the matter is...

432
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:01,634
Actually the matter is, madam...

433
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,572
that you are ill, and that's why
sir refused to bring the child.

434
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,532
This is the matter, Ratna - If you
want to see the child, you surely can.

435
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,466
Nurse, bring the child.

436
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,346
Here.

437
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:27,626
Ratna, give the child to
the nurse and lie down.

438
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:29,866
No, let me hold him
for some more time.

439
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:32,426
Let her, sir. Come.

440
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,672
Munshiji, I will give...

441
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,632
as much money as required
for his treatment.

442
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,552
Go and give her the money tomorrow.

443
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:51,392
And tell her that Ratna should
never know of that.

444
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,952
- Don't worry, sir...
- Vikram is coming here.

445
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,977
Brother in law, forgive me.

446
00:32:58,444 --> 00:32:59,762
The tyre of my car got punctured...

447
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,728
when I was returning from
a hunt. That's why I am late.

448
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:03,872
I should have been here earlier
at such an occasion.

449
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,912
Good that you came late.
Right, Munshiji?

450
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,912
- Why? - You won't get it.
- I won't get it?

451
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,472
Anyways, tell me whether
she had a boy or a girl?

452
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,392
Better find it out yourself.

453
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:20,151
Sometimes you crack such jokes;
I really enjoy them.

454
00:33:23,758 --> 00:33:29,312
No, no, Munshiji. We haven't
sold our child.

455
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:33,312
One day you did a big favor to us.

456
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:39,072
Janaki, any big favor can
be valued, but not yours.

457
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,035
I am giving you this money because...

458
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,632
no illness can be treated
without money these days.

459
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:49,552
Ramesh is ill; it is necessary
that he recovers.

460
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,420
Get him treated so that
he can recover fast.

461
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,592
Even if I do recover,
how will I forget...

462
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:01,198
that I increased my
life by losing by son?

463
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:04,872
Don't be silly! You both
are still very young.

464
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:07,872
If God wishes, you can have 10 sons.

465
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,472
Janaki, I got you married.

466
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:17,792
So it is my duty to take
care of your husband.

467
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:25,552
Look, Janaki, if you ever need
anything, just let me know.

468
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:29,945
Do you remember, Janaki,
I had told you...

469
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,888
on the 1st night of
our marriage that...

470
00:34:32,926 --> 00:34:35,062
I am not worth being your husband?

471
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,971
I controlled my tears
when I lost my child.

472
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:44,171
- Do you want me to cry again?
- No, Janaki, no.

473
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,971
A good child is his
parents' support.

474
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:55,091
Our child proved that as soon
as he was born, didn't he?

475
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:56,531
Yes.

476
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:01,291
Yes, put it over there.

477
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:03,307
Munshiji, some one has
come to meet you.

478
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:04,951
I've made her sit in that room.

479
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:07,691
Yes, I'll go and see. You guys
continue with your work.

480
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:09,778
Viru, see that they work properly.
I'll be right back.

481
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:10,931
Come on.

482
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:14,731
Who?

483
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,651
Janaki? You?

484
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:25,331
How come you're here?

485
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:28,331
I am leaving by next
morning's train...

486
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:31,251
with Ramesh, to get him operated.

487
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:36,831
I want to see my child
once before I leave.

488
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:39,177
What are you saying, Janaki?

489
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:41,631
Just think, if anyone sees you...

490
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:43,391
in this house, it
would be terrible.

491
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,311
You shouldn't have come here.

492
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:53,517
I tried to convince and stop
myself, but couldn't stop my heart.

493
00:35:54,591 --> 00:36:02,591
Once... if I could hug him just
once... I will go away for good then.

494
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:06,991
I understand your restlessness,
but can't do any thing.

495
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,231
I can neither take you in,
nor bring the child out.

496
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:17,151
Forget him, Janaki. Now
he is not your son.

497
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,991
- Nor is there a way to meet him.
- There is one way.

498
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:23,711
Today is his naming ceremony.

499
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:28,831
I had abandoned dancing
to gain my husband.

500
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:35,631
I will dance again to
see my son, Munshiji.

501
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:37,391
Janaki!

502
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:41,071
Let me sing on this ceremony,
Munshiji.

503
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:44,751
I will never forget
this favor of yours.

504
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:50,671
All right, Janaki. Go now, and
come back in the evening.

505
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:31,672
'Blessings to your son'

506
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,326
'Blessings to your son'

507
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:42,126
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

508
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:46,606
'Blessings to your son'

509
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:50,846
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

510
00:37:50,926 --> 00:37:55,014
'Your son.'

511
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:59,566
'Your son.'

512
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:03,646
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

513
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:40,699
'With small legs he falls
and stands up again'

514
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:48,966
'May the sun always
bright his future'

515
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,532
'The sky will bow
down and kiss him'

516
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:57,476
'The sky will bow
down and kiss him'

517
00:38:57,556 --> 00:39:00,806
'In this courtyard'

518
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:09,126
'Your... your... your son.'

519
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:13,126
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

520
00:39:13,326 --> 00:39:17,326
'Your son.'

521
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:21,286
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

522
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:25,366
'Your son.'

523
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,286
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

524
00:39:28,316 --> 00:39:29,332
What is this, brother in law?

525
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:31,396
You're giving your son in
the hands of a prostitute?

526
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,287
Stop blabbering! And what's
wrong even if I give her?

527
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:39,102
- She will only love her.
- Never! Vikram is right.

528
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,204
A prostitute cannot love my child.

529
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,607
Forgive me. I had forgotten
my identity for a while.

530
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:24,886
'Like a naughty moon swinging
in the pram'

531
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:33,805
'Don't look at him too much, or
his complexion will be dirtied'

532
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,674
'Take my drape.'

533
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:42,686
'Take my drape.'

534
00:40:42,895 --> 00:40:46,830
'And put him in it'

535
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:54,926
'Your... your... your son.'

536
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,126
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

537
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:39,880
'Everyone can give away
money and diamonds'

538
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:47,726
'I have only brought
good wishes for him'

539
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:52,604
'May he get my life! '

540
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:56,606
'May he get my life! '

541
00:41:56,686 --> 00:42:00,446
'May you live long! '

542
00:42:00,706 --> 00:42:08,366
'Your... your... your son.'

543
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:12,686
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

544
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,599
Please, give this prize money in
charity after your son's name.

545
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,639
May God always protect him!

546
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,850
May all my well wishes fall
on him like a mother's milk!

547
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,477
You've fallen back
to your old status.

548
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:47,838
If you wanted to live a decent
life only for few months...

549
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,799
I could have done that for you.

550
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:53,122
Where are you going? You refused
me for a poor man?

551
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:55,359
- Get out of my way.
- Ok.

552
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:59,479
But remember, Janaki
I will ruin your life.

553
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:16,018
Janaki, sir Thakur has
come to meet you.

554
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,971
Janaki, I regret for what
happened yesterday.

555
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:28,611
You had done us a big favor
by giving away your child.

556
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:30,908
But yesterday you made
us your slave...

557
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:33,251
by keeping quiet at the ceremony.

558
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:37,891
- Sir Thakur... I...
- I don't know what do I say to you, Janaki.

559
00:43:38,642 --> 00:43:40,931
You strangled your motherly love...

560
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:42,851
but didn't let our
prestige be blotted.

561
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:48,611
Don't embarrass me, sir.
Now he is your son.

562
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,571
That's what I've come to tell you.

563
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:53,571
Don't worry about your son's future.

564
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:58,851
He will live like a prince in our
house, and will lack nothing.

565
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,651
He will be called our son,
but we will try...

566
00:44:03,835 --> 00:44:07,171
that he acquires virtues like
yours, and becomes like you.

567
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:11,891
Munshiji! Here!

568
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:14,451
There are some photos of
your son in this album.

569
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:16,849
Munshiji will keep you...

570
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,793
informed about your son regularly.

571
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,851
That will be enough for me, sir.

572
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:25,248
We cannot repay your favor,
but God will repay it.

573
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,731
Your husband will
get well very soon.

574
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:31,158
You will recover.

575
00:44:31,307 --> 00:44:33,331
Greetings, sir.

576
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:48,981
Come, sir.

577
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:52,821
Ratna, kiss him.

578
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,221
Go child, and play outside.

579
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,432
What's the matter? You
look very happy today.

580
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:01,621
- I won an old case today.
- Really? Our son is so lucky.

581
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:04,621
Since the day he was born,
everything goes well.

582
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:06,106
- Not at all!
- What?

583
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,581
Every thing is not going well;
it is going very well.

584
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:13,901
Are you making these socks for
Suraj? Aren't they a bit small?

585
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:16,501
They're not for Suraj,
but for Chand.

586
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:20,141
- Who's Chand?
- Suraj should be having a younger brother.

587
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:24,021
He should be having or is
he going to have a bro?

588
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:29,541
I see. That's why you
look prettier everyday.

589
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,701
- Pretty! Prettier...
- Brother in law!

590
00:45:34,877 --> 00:45:37,901
Come, come, dear. Come in now
that you are already here.

591
00:45:38,224 --> 00:45:40,741
Brother, Munshiji has
come to meet you.

592
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,816
That's fine, but we
really disliked you...

593
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:44,675
coming here at this moment.

594
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:47,181
How would I know you
would be romancing...

595
00:45:50,741 --> 00:45:52,261
Greetings, sir.

596
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,541
Greetings, Munshiji. Sit down.

597
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:57,494
Did you meet Ramesh and
Janaki? How are they?

598
00:45:57,917 --> 00:46:00,861
No, I couldn't find them. Don't
know where they've gone.

599
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:02,199
What does that mean?

600
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,221
I could only find out that...

601
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,237
Ramesh got operated successfully
and recovered.

602
00:46:06,261 --> 00:46:09,021
And after that he also
found a good job.

603
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:13,547
That's good news, but
why did they do this?

604
00:46:13,627 --> 00:46:14,888
They didn't even inform us.

605
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:18,701
That's for the better, sir. Now this
secret of the child will be buried.

606
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:24,496
That's true, but I wanted to be
of help to Janaki all her life.

607
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,061
Looks like they broke relation
with us on purpose.

608
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,661
That's possible, sir.

609
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:35,021
But, Munshiji, I will never
forget her decency.

610
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:38,461
Nor will I let her child feel
any shortage in life.

611
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,562
Janaki, the more you
recall the child...

612
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:54,722
the more you will find it
difficult to forget him.

613
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:59,741
Look here. Why these
tears in your eyes?

614
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:02,621
You used to encourage me.

615
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:04,381
How come your heart
has fallen so weak?

616
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:08,221
With God's grace we've
got everything.

617
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:11,261
I have recovered; we have
a house and a business.

618
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:15,741
Your faith on God will make
you a mother once again.

619
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,125
Rather than recalling
Suraj and crying...

620
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:23,334
pray to God that
he makes him happy.

621
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:25,341
And make him a successful person.

622
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,658
He might not be called our child.

623
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:30,621
But may he make his guardian
parents feel proud!

624
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:36,541
Close this album for ever,
Janaki. Close it.

625
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:02,061
You seem to be in a hurry, bro.
Where are you going?

626
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:05,057
Why haven't you gone to the college?

627
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:07,103
I will go, but where are you going?

628
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:10,394
I... I am going to the office.

629
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:14,543
- Suraj!
- Yes, father.

630
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:18,921
- Where is Suraj?
- Brother has left for the office. - So early?

631
00:48:19,526 --> 00:48:22,708
Well, give this letter to Dr.
Gupta on your way to college.

632
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:27,183
And listen! Go to some barber and...

633
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:29,636
Yes, yes, I will get them
cut when I return.

634
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:49,225
How can you come in so shamelessly?
Father is home.

635
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:50,962
Doesn't matter; let him be at home.

636
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,829
- What?
- Yes.

637
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:54,389
And he also knows that you come
here everyday to meet me.

638
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,263
- That's even better.
- What? - Yes.

639
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,339
How come you're not scared to
hear father's name today?

640
00:48:59,363 --> 00:49:03,789
I saw Munshiji going out and so
I hid. He went and so I came.

641
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,623
I see. So that's the case?

642
00:49:06,954 --> 00:49:10,783
Ok, tell me, how long will you keep
meeting me secretly like this?

643
00:49:11,192 --> 00:49:14,191
You joined your father's business
after completing studies.

644
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:16,183
This is my final year.

645
00:49:16,743 --> 00:49:18,453
Don't know when will I
get to see that day...

646
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,628
when you'll come
to meet my father...

647
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:23,050
and talk to him
about our marriage.

648
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,679
- Tell me.
- It's very simple, Shobhana.

649
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,555
According to the rule
of our family...

650
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,596
a proposal will be
sent to your family.

651
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:32,209
Then a priest will
be sent for. Then...

652
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:35,763
Then the priest will come.
Find an auspicious day...

653
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:38,226
and then I will be marrying
someone else.

654
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:43,466
- If that happens, I will feel very sad.
- Only sad? - Yes.

655
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,848
I don't understand why I love you.

656
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:50,386
- It's because I love you.
- Father! - We'll be in trouble.

657
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,602
- Why has he come back?
- Don't know.

658
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:55,386
- Greetings, Munshiji.
- Bless you, child.

659
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:57,106
Have you come on some errand?

660
00:49:57,446 --> 00:50:00,126
Yes... I was going to the office so
I thought I will take you along.

661
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:01,610
Shobhana told me that
you had already left...

662
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:03,594
but here you come back.
Let's go to the office.

663
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:05,290
You go on; I will come
after some time.

664
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:07,067
Father, I am going to the college.

665
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,666
Fine; I'm going to the office;
I will drop you at the college.

666
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:23,186
With God's blessings your
wish is fulfilled today.

667
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:28,226
I have got your Kiran
admitted in a college.

668
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,666
Raja, here comes your Kiran.

669
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:51,786
Wow! I've been waiting for
this meeting for long.

670
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:55,586
You have never looked
at me with a smile...

671
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,026
ever since you've
come to this college.

672
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:06,186
Answer to me with your sweet voice,
and not with this cycle bell.

673
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:09,986
I've heard that your voice
is like lovely bells.

674
00:51:10,508 --> 00:51:13,546
Get the signal, Raja. This
is just the cycle bell.

675
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:14,999
I hope you don't get thrashed.

676
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:21,506
One does not get thrashed after
meeting such a pretty girl.

677
00:51:21,586 --> 00:51:23,192
One hears the wedding bells ringing.

678
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,199
Shall I arrange for that?

679
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:28,586
I won't let you go without
hearing the answer.

680
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,146
- Right now?
- Of course.

681
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,666
Have you got your answer? Remember,
my name is Kiran.

682
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,735
- Listen!
- Yes?

683
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:56,204
You're going home alone.

684
00:51:56,284 --> 00:51:58,822
If you don't mind, can
I drop you home?

685
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:02,702
- Who are you?
- My name is Prakash.

686
00:52:02,782 --> 00:52:05,222
It wasn't wise of you
to mess with Raja.

687
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:09,062
They are planning to revenge
on you this evening.

688
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:12,102
Mr. Prakash, I can take
care of my self.

689
00:52:12,532 --> 00:52:14,822
By the way, thank you very much.

690
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,742
Prakash, you were talking to the
girl who can thrash any one.

691
00:52:20,822 --> 00:52:22,342
Are you in your senses?

692
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,182
What's wrong with him?

693
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:15,062
Raja, the chain's down.

694
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,542
Let's fix it, dear. Come.

695
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,622
Do you want help, Ms. Kiran?

696
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:32,695
Help? That, too, from
a loafer like you?

697
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:37,302
Kiran! I haven't forgotten
my insult yet.

698
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:39,342
You shouldn't forget either.

699
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:42,934
By the way, I don't want
to bother my hands again.

700
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:46,102
I had thought that I'd forgive
you if you'd ask forgiveness.

701
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:49,369
But looks like I will have
to teach you a lesson.

702
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:54,177
Oh! So you've come with these
guys to teach a lesson?

703
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:59,169
Teach me. But first tell
me, which lesson?

704
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,329
A lesson that you will remember
all your life. Catch her!

705
00:54:17,093 --> 00:54:18,489
Girls! Start!

706
00:54:20,788 --> 00:54:23,169
Wait! Looks like they're
thrashing in wholesale!

707
00:54:36,017 --> 00:54:38,569
Help!

708
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:58,882
Stop!

709
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:01,628
Where are you running?

710
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:36,191
Raja has got a good smashing today.

711
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:46,720
Sister, forgive me.

712
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:55,289
Let him go. His team has
run away from the field.

713
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,012
He's already got a good smashing.

714
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:58,572
Let us give him a chance.

715
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:01,412
Ok, we'll recover in the next match.

716
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,532
Get up, and disappear!

717
00:56:03,813 --> 00:56:06,652
Mr. Raja, shall I help you?

718
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:11,652
- Shut up!
- Go!

719
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,852
You should be ashamed, Raja.

720
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,171
You act like a loafer instead
of a college student.

721
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,012
You've broken the discipline
of the college...

722
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,612
and acted like an
uncultured person.

723
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:27,868
I tried to make you understand...

724
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:30,532
I advised you and even warned
you, but all in vain.

725
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:33,332
Sir, I say again that Ms. Kiran
has accused me falsely.

726
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:36,085
I had not come to the college
yesterday. You can ask them.

727
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:38,332
Really, sir, Raja was ill yesterday.

728
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:40,776
Yes, sir, we didn't
go home last night.

729
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,212
Sir, I'm still ill. I've come
to ask for leave from you.

730
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:46,212
Ask me, sir; I will
tell you the truth.

731
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:53,052
First of all Raja teased Kiran.
He harassed her.

732
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,532
And when she was going back home,
all of them surrounded her.

733
00:56:57,692 --> 00:56:59,588
If the girls of the college
hockey team had not...

734
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:01,347
been there, don't know
what might have happened.

735
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:02,932
I've seen all that myself, sir.

736
00:57:03,012 --> 00:57:05,132
You can call on the whole
team and ask them.

737
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:08,692
I don't need to ask anyone after
hearing your statement.

738
00:57:09,212 --> 00:57:11,932
Raja, we are now convinced
that you will not improve.

739
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:15,294
Boys like you defame the college,
city and country.

740
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:18,772
I am giving you the last chance.
Ask forgiveness from Kiran.

741
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:21,521
I won't ask forgiveness, sir.

742
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:24,172
If you don't, I will rusticate you.

743
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:26,892
You can, sir. I don't care.

744
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:37,672
- Hallo.
- Hallo.

745
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:40,612
- Listen!
- Yes?

746
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:44,407
You warned me yesterday, and
today you stood on my side.

747
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,292
You've done me two favors.

748
00:57:46,452 --> 00:57:48,212
I will repay them as soon
as I get a chance.

749
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,332
- You can repay now if you want.
- How?

750
00:57:51,899 --> 00:57:54,278
Look, for favor number one...

751
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,612
stop calling me with respect
one has for elders.

752
00:57:56,692 --> 00:57:58,408
We study in the same college.

753
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:00,452
Your name is Kiran,
and mine is Prakash.

754
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:03,332
Done. And for the second favor?

755
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:07,332
- For that you will have to come with me.
- Where?

756
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:10,532
On a picnic. Some girls and
boys have arranged a picnic.

757
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:12,819
- Will you come?
- Yes, yes, she will surely come.

758
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,852
I've talked to some
of my girl friends.

759
00:58:15,172 --> 00:58:16,932
You can also bring
your friends along.

760
00:58:17,012 --> 00:58:19,652
But not those hockey girls, please.

761
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,452
You didn't answer me, Kiran.

762
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:26,452
Now I will have to agree to you.

763
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,852
It will be better to repay your
favor as soon as possible.

764
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:33,012
What time are we going?

765
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:36,535
Be ready at 7 a.m. We will
pick you up from your home.

766
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:38,772
- Ok? Done?
- Done.

767
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:44,852
One thing is assured, Prakash.
Kiran will never smash you now.

768
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:48,027
Because she's said 'Done' to you.

769
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,292
You're going fast, dear!

770
00:58:50,372 --> 00:58:54,452
It took you just a leap from
'thank you' to 'picnic'.

771
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,332
- Now you are to take me further.
- Me? How?

772
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:01,972
Look, bring the boys and girls
on the picnic spot late.

773
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:06,252
Late? Got it. You both are
burning in the same fire.

774
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:10,772
Don't know about her. But
I am really burning.

775
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:15,012
I wish I could get a chance
to talk to Kiran in privacy.

776
00:59:29,086 --> 00:59:31,246
- Where are the others?
- Who others?

777
00:59:31,452 --> 00:59:34,046
The boys and the girls. We've come
here on a picnic, haven't we?

778
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,566
Y... yes, yes, they must
be coming soon.

779
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:41,566
- I hope they know this place.
- Yes, they all know it.

780
00:59:42,566 --> 00:59:46,206
By the way, how did
you find this place?

781
00:59:47,908 --> 00:59:52,166
Very good. The climate is good...
and this lonely place...

782
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:55,966
I am also with you. What
else would you want?

783
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,886
That's what you wanted, right?

784
00:59:58,046 --> 01:00:00,244
That you would get a chance...

785
01:00:00,324 --> 01:00:03,486
- to talk nice things to me in privacy.
- What?

786
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:05,486
Speak, dear. Don't feel shy.

787
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:08,643
Now that you've brought me here
with the excuse of picnic...

788
01:00:08,914 --> 01:00:11,646
speak up whatever
is in your heart.

789
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,726
- Is there a need to say?
- Shut up!

790
01:00:20,146 --> 01:00:22,416
- I thought you were not like other guys.
- Kiran!

791
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:25,486
Keep quiet! I will complain
about you to the principal.

792
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:28,366
And will meet your parents
and tell them that...

793
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:31,406
you took me to a jungle in the
name of picnic and teased me.

794
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:33,006
What do you think me to be?

795
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:45,486
Oh! Is that so?

796
01:01:00,016 --> 01:01:05,594
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

797
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:11,486
'Why do you cry? I had
teased you with love'

798
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:18,297
'Someone will lose his
life in this game'

799
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:24,006
'Why do you cry? I had
teased you with love'

800
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:29,726
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

801
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:36,606
'Why care for heart or life
in this game of love? '

802
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:42,246
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

803
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:06,555
'If you say so, my dear,
let it be so'

804
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:12,526
'That it is the fault of this
youth and not yours'

805
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:19,166
'If you say so, my dear,
let it be so'

806
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:24,966
'That it is the fault of this
youth and not yours'

807
01:02:25,766 --> 01:02:31,126
'When you meet me with love,
you play mischief'

808
01:02:31,886 --> 01:02:37,206
'Why do you cry? I had
teased you with love'

809
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:43,446
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

810
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:50,124
'Why care for heart or life
in this game of love? '

811
01:02:50,204 --> 01:02:55,686
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

812
01:03:17,453 --> 01:03:22,926
'Whether I tease you or not, you
don't like it either way'

813
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:29,446
'Looks like you've gone
crazy from today, dear'

814
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,988
'Whether I tease you or not, you
don't like it either way'

815
01:03:35,204 --> 01:03:41,126
'Looks like you've gone
crazy from today, dear'

816
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:47,366
'You are unable to brace yourself'

817
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:53,126
'Dear, it is not good to
tease a restless heart'

818
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:59,366
'Why care for heart or life
in this game of love? '

819
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:05,486
'Someone will lose his
life in this game'

820
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:11,646
'Why care for heart or life
in this game of love? '

821
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,290
There's only one problem
with this agreement.

822
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,370
This figure does not
match our expenses.

823
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:43,604
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, Munshiji. Come.

824
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:46,490
What are these flowers for?

825
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:49,210
You've forgotten as usual that
today is your birthday.

826
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:53,426
See, Suraj? Whether I celebrate
my birthday or not...

827
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:56,230
Munshiji never forgets
to bring flowers for me.

828
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:57,930
- Thank you.
- Greetings, uncle.

829
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,410
You don't come so often
to our place nowadays.

830
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:01,811
Uncle, it's my last
year of studies...

831
01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:04,250
And you want to gain 1st
rank as usual, right?

832
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:08,050
Vikram, go and tell your sister
to sweeten Munshiji's mouth.

833
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,890
What a bad era! It is the
birthday of a big Thakur...

834
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:13,930
and you expect me to just
sweeten everyone's mouth?

835
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,572
There should be a grand party today.

836
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:19,650
Father does not believe
in these things, uncle.

837
01:05:19,907 --> 01:05:21,290
It is a waste of money.

838
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,530
I don't understand...

839
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,799
how you were born in this
Thakur family, nephew.

840
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,330
The grandeur or the
rich people lies...

841
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:30,665
in wasting money,
not gathering it.

842
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:36,570
Just as I wasted. People till
date talk about my kindness.

843
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:39,690
Yes, of course. And it
is me who pays for...

844
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,356
your kindness on the first
date of every month.

845
01:05:42,854 --> 01:05:47,308
It is your duty, brother. If I lose
my prestige, you will lose, too.

846
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:49,726
Yes, dear, there's a saying...

847
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:52,686
let everything be on one side, and
let wife's brother be on the other.

848
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:55,266
Munshiji, come to the office.
I have some work with you.

849
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,153
Sit, child. I'll be back in a while.

850
01:05:57,233 --> 01:06:00,330
Elder nephew, I wanted to talk
something important to you.

851
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:04,250
Talk to me next month, uncle.
You've already talked this month.

852
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:08,467
- Listen! I want some books.
- Yes, let's go upstairs.

853
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:13,759
Dear me!

854
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:17,130
- Tell me which book you want.
- Not among these.

855
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:19,249
I want the book which
the priests use...

856
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:21,450
to find out the auspicious
marriage date.

857
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:25,770
I've given a few hints to
my father about that.

858
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:27,493
What have you done?

859
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:31,201
I haven't yet got a chance
to talk to father.

860
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:36,730
If you can't tell him, write
him a letter. I will post it.

861
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:40,170
Don't joke, Shobhana.
It is a serious matter.

862
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:43,050
After all it is a matter
of our wedding.

863
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,330
You can't talk to your father.

864
01:06:46,563 --> 01:06:49,130
You're scared of talking
to my father.

865
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,882
- Do you know what will be the result of that?
- What?

866
01:06:51,962 --> 01:06:53,770
I will be married to someone else...

867
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,250
and you will just keep watching.

868
01:06:55,324 --> 01:06:57,449
Don't say such inauspicious
words, Shobhana.

869
01:06:57,529 --> 01:06:59,222
Think of a way to talk to father.

870
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:01,255
I will tell you the way, brother.

871
01:07:01,335 --> 01:07:04,876
- Greetings, Bhabhi.
- What? You called Shobhana Bhabhi?

872
01:07:04,956 --> 01:07:07,970
If I knew this earlier, I would be
calling her Bhabhi since long back.

873
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:10,120
You proved to be really
secretive, brother.

874
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,379
Prakash, I don't like such jokes.

875
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:14,228
What are you saying, brother?

876
01:07:14,308 --> 01:07:16,483
It's a matter of life and
death for both of us.

877
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:18,683
I mean for the two of us.

878
01:07:18,763 --> 01:07:21,233
For you because you
can't talk to father.

879
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:24,531
And for me because if I don't
make Shobhana my Bhabhi...

880
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:28,595
my being born as your younger
bro would be useless.

881
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:30,574
Prakash, will you stop
this blabbering?

882
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:33,803
Brother, you will understand it
when you will go to talk to dad.

883
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:35,538
But won't be able to say any thing.

884
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:37,723
That day your obedient
brother like Laxman...

885
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,163
and this tape recorder
will prove useful.

886
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,120
Listen! You also listen.

887
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,283
I want the book which
the priests use...

888
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:46,283
to find out the auspicious
marriage date.

889
01:07:47,137 --> 01:07:50,363
I've given a few hints to
my father about that.

890
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:52,683
- What have you done?
- Listen; it's your voice.

891
01:07:53,364 --> 01:07:55,031
I haven't yet got a chance
to talk to father.

892
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:59,443
- This one is yours.
- If you can't tell him, write him...

893
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:02,921
Younger brother in law,
promise me that...

894
01:08:03,127 --> 01:08:05,287
if not needed, you will not
let anyone hear this tape.

895
01:08:05,311 --> 01:08:07,755
I swear on you, Bhabhi...

896
01:08:08,003 --> 01:08:11,443
as soon as brother gets married,
I will give it to him.

897
01:08:11,776 --> 01:08:15,387
So that you both can recall
old memories with your kids.

898
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:18,163
- Will you now go or not?
- Yes, yes, I am going.

899
01:08:18,631 --> 01:08:20,804
But I give you a time
limit of one week, bro.

900
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:23,443
If you don't talk to father
within this week...

901
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:25,733
I will have to act like
your elder bro then.

902
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,807
Move now.

903
01:08:27,888 --> 01:08:30,003
Bye, brother. Bye, Bhabhi.

904
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,442
- Wicked!
- He's very naughty.

905
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,209
Shashi, do you want to give
any message to aunt Sarla?

906
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,462
Kiran, get me some
money from mother...

907
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:40,742
and tell her that I pay much
attention to my studies.

908
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:43,084
You're paying attention?

909
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,056
Movies in the morning,
and comics at night.

910
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,762
I am going to tell her that, and
I won't get you any money.

911
01:08:48,064 --> 01:08:51,807
- Parkar, what are you doing?
- Parkar is following my orders.

912
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:53,003
And my order is that...

913
01:08:53,084 --> 01:08:54,700
you will go only after
attending the function.

914
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:55,964
Mr. Chandraprakash...

915
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,940
- is the table man of this function committee.
- Hey!

916
01:08:57,964 --> 01:08:59,395
I mean the he is the chairman.

917
01:08:59,475 --> 01:09:04,244
So it is the duty of ours, his
friends, to follow his orders.

918
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:09,045
- I bow down and accept this order.
- Good.

919
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,847
- But I have a request.
- It will be heard. It will be heard.

920
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:15,804
There are still 15 days
to the function.

921
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:17,780
I will meet my mother and
come back immediately.

922
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:19,863
Grant me the permission
to meet my mother.

923
01:09:19,944 --> 01:09:22,288
It will surely be granted.

924
01:09:22,573 --> 01:09:25,554
But you will come straight
to me after meeting mother.

925
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:28,244
- I surely will.
- Parkar! - Yes, guru.

926
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:30,843
- Let her bag be given back to her.
- Sure.

927
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:34,187
- Let the lady be dropped at the station.
- Sure, sir.

928
01:09:34,715 --> 01:09:36,204
- Thank you.
- Come.

929
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,324
Janaki!

930
01:09:46,045 --> 01:09:48,604
You've been working
since the afternoon.

931
01:09:48,787 --> 01:09:51,252
Got a bigger load, sister Sarla.

932
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:54,441
You got a bigger load, or
did you purposely take it?

933
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:56,441
You know, sister Sarla,
how much money...

934
01:09:56,847 --> 01:09:59,416
your Shashi needs every month.

935
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:04,281
If I don't work, how will I be able
to pay for Kiran's study fees?

936
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:07,641
My Shashi spends only on studies.

937
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:10,521
But your Kiran lives like
a princess over there.

938
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:13,911
To put up a false prestige,
you sold your jewelry...

939
01:10:14,274 --> 01:10:15,481
and mortgaged this house.

940
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:18,754
Take my advice and tell Kiran
the true state of affairs.

941
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:20,501
No, sister Sarla.

942
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:26,961
Her father never let her feel short
of anything till he was alive.

943
01:10:27,506 --> 01:10:33,161
And neither do I want her
to know my troubles.

944
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:36,601
And get distracted from her studies.

945
01:10:37,141 --> 01:10:39,321
She's studied enough, Janaki.

946
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,761
If a boy had born to you
instead of Kiran...

947
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,841
he would have earned
some money for you.

948
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:47,001
And would have been the
support of your old age.

949
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:50,921
Let Kiran come this time.
I will tell her the truth.

950
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:55,081
For God's sake, don't do that.
She'll feel bad.

951
01:10:56,403 --> 01:10:58,921
There aren't many days left to
the completion of her studies.

952
01:10:59,517 --> 01:11:01,641
Till then your bones will
be broken, Janaki.

953
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:04,761
Let my bones break, sister.

954
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:08,041
Let anything happen.

955
01:11:11,071 --> 01:11:15,081
Kiran's father wished that
Kiran would study a lot.

956
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:20,783
He had many dreams for his child.

957
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,961
I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of his soul.

958
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:29,881
May God give you strength! Come
with me and eat some thing.

959
01:11:30,175 --> 01:11:31,601
Don't cook anything now.

960
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:37,361
You've ruined your health
by working at nights. Come.

961
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:41,241
But, Prakash, 2000 rupees is too
much. Why don't you get it?

962
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:43,877
- Yes, that is too much.
- Ok, give me 10 notes of 100 rupees then.

963
01:11:43,901 --> 01:11:44,901
- That should be fine.

964
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,059
Look, I am the chairman of
the function committee.

965
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,685
You be the chairman of
the funds committee.

966
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:50,143
I don't want to be that.

967
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,401
Talk to Suraj; he handles
the business.

968
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:54,081
I've already talked to brother.

969
01:11:54,592 --> 01:11:56,006
He says he won't give me
more than 100 rupees.

970
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,204
That's a waste of money.

971
01:11:57,284 --> 01:11:59,841
If Suraj has said 100, you
will get only 100 rupees.

972
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,390
What are you saying, father?

973
01:12:01,546 --> 01:12:04,184
You are a big Thakur; I am your son.

974
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:06,454
All my friends have come.
What will they think of us?

975
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:09,441
- Greetings.
- Here, Kiran has also come.

976
01:12:15,808 --> 01:12:17,823
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

977
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:24,382
I feel I've seen this girl
somewhere. I don't recall.

978
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:26,150
How can you have seen her, dad?

979
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:29,385
- She's come at our house for the first time.
- I see.

980
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:30,976
Father, the fund?

981
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:34,001
Yes, I will talk to Suraj. But
you won't get more than 1000.

982
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,949
Uncle, we had written
only 1000 over here...

983
01:12:36,839 --> 01:12:39,681
- So you were fooling me?
- Look, father, you've promised.

984
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:41,121
A promise is a promise.

985
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:43,537
- You've also promised...
- Daddy, not in front of every one.

986
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:46,001
- That's the modern style.
- Is that a modern style?

987
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,545
Ok, take an appointment of a barber.

988
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:49,841
One thousand.

989
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:53,219
Very good, Kiran. You've
come one day earlier.

990
01:12:53,893 --> 01:12:55,733
Come; let's sit and discuss
about the function.

991
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:59,288
Prakash, I had come
to tell you that...

992
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:01,201
What's the matter? Why
do you look so tensed?

993
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:05,201
No, it's not that. I won't be able
to participate in the function.

994
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:09,435
- Look now; don't joke.
- I am not kidding. I am telling the truth.

995
01:13:09,591 --> 01:13:10,951
She is telling the truth, Prakash.

996
01:13:11,156 --> 01:13:13,121
- Is there a telephone?
- Telephone? What for?

997
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:15,761
- I want to call at the hospital.
- Hospital? What happened?

998
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:17,574
If she won't participate
in the function...

999
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:20,140
we will get thrashed on that day.

1000
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,870
Why not book a bed in advance?
Shall I, miss?

1001
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:27,121
Please! Why do you want
to put us in trouble?

1002
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:28,321
Please, agree.

1003
01:13:28,912 --> 01:13:31,957
Did you hear that? Ms. Kiran,
you are a great artist.

1004
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:33,457
Now don't force us to
flatter you more.

1005
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:34,801
Let's start the rehearsals.

1006
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:13,152
- 'What are you?
- Yes, tell me'

1007
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:17,161
'You are my shadow'

1008
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:24,321
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1009
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,681
'I've got such beauty'

1010
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:33,561
'I taught the crazy
boys what love is'

1011
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:41,241
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1012
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:45,946
- 'What are you?
- Yes, tell me'

1013
01:14:46,026 --> 01:14:49,081
'You are my shadow'

1014
01:14:49,742 --> 01:14:56,756
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1015
01:14:56,937 --> 01:15:00,207
'I've got such a heart'

1016
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:05,481
'I taught the pretty
girls what love is'

1017
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:13,561
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1018
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:39,721
'My delicate hands will be
your support in grief'

1019
01:15:41,763 --> 01:15:49,241
- 'The life brightens up with my fair face.
- Got it? '

1020
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:55,001
'My delicate hands will be
your support in grief'

1021
01:15:56,744 --> 01:16:02,681
'The life brightens up
with my fair face'

1022
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:11,721
'I've lighted the lamp
of each heart'

1023
01:16:12,209 --> 01:16:17,881
'I taught the crazy
boys what love is'

1024
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:25,561
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1025
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,801
'I've got such a heart'

1026
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:34,361
'I taught the pretty
girls what love is'

1027
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:42,281
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1028
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:04,841
'My tears make the pearl
necklace in your neck'

1029
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:13,562
- 'If I sigh, your eyes will weep.
- Got it? '

1030
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:18,898
'My tears make the pearl
necklace in your neck'

1031
01:17:20,957 --> 01:17:26,181
'If I sigh, your eyes will weep'

1032
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:35,521
'It is me who has cheered up
the magic of each beauty'

1033
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:40,805
'I taught the pretty
girls what love is'

1034
01:17:41,878 --> 01:17:48,361
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1035
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,747
'I've got such beauty'

1036
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:57,082
'I taught the crazy
boys what love is'

1037
01:17:58,259 --> 01:18:04,753
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1038
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:12,840
'What are you? You are my shadow'

1039
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:32,457
- Excellent! Excellent performance, Kiran.
- Thank you.

1040
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:35,497
I want you to have tea with
me tomorrow evening.

1041
01:18:35,965 --> 01:18:38,421
- But I...
- Please, don't refuse.

1042
01:18:39,044 --> 01:18:41,387
If you insist with so much love,
I will surely come.

1043
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:46,014
- Here's the address.
- Come.

1044
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:48,937
Eat, dear. Why are
you looking at me?

1045
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,697
I've cooked them with much love.

1046
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:53,738
That's why I am looking
at the one who cooked.

1047
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:56,599
Really, Ratna, it's been
40 years to our marriage.

1048
01:18:56,679 --> 01:18:58,849
But neither yours nor
my love has faded.

1049
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,537
You still look like a bride.

1050
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,297
That's why I tell you not to
look without the specs on.

1051
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:07,017
You're caged in my eyes.
Why do I need the specs?

1052
01:19:07,097 --> 01:19:09,457
Here. There's no difference.
No difference.

1053
01:19:10,214 --> 01:19:12,217
You've grown old, and
our kids have grown up.

1054
01:19:12,522 --> 01:19:15,644
They might have grown up. Does
that mean that we are old?

1055
01:19:16,734 --> 01:19:18,377
Ok, have this.

1056
01:19:19,769 --> 01:19:24,617
- Father!
- Come, Suraj. Sit down. Have the Snacks.

1057
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,986
Your mother cooked them for me,
but you can have them.

1058
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,897
Father, I want to tell you
something important.

1059
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,817
Yes, child, is it regarding
the business?

1060
01:19:33,937 --> 01:19:36,817
- No, more important than that.
- Go on, tell us.

1061
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:40,977
I've been wanting to say this
for many days, but couldn't.

1062
01:19:41,773 --> 01:19:44,212
What does that mean?
Tell him to speak.

1063
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,777
- What's the matter, son?
- I'll tell you.

1064
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:50,137
There's only one matter, nephew...

1065
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:54,297
that one hesitates to
tell to the parents.

1066
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:57,977
- Looks like you're in love.
- Really, Suraj?

1067
01:19:58,057 --> 01:20:01,188
- What are you saying, uncle.
- What's the matter, Suraj?

1068
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:04,017
- I'll tell you later, father.
- Wait, Suraj, listen.

1069
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:05,737
- Will talk to you later.
- Listen!

1070
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:09,172
He's feeling shy and went away.
Didn't even speak to us.

1071
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,097
I will tell you, father.

1072
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:14,810
Why would I say either?
Listen for yourself.

1073
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:16,217
Not among these.

1074
01:20:16,765 --> 01:20:19,021
I want the book which
the priests use...

1075
01:20:19,101 --> 01:20:21,097
to find out the auspicious
marriage date.

1076
01:20:21,177 --> 01:20:25,734
I find this voice very familiar,
but can't recognize it.

1077
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,530
- No.
- She is Shobhna. Munshi's daughter.

1078
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,537
I haven't yet got a chance
to talk to father.

1079
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,537
- Is that Suraj's voice?
- Yes. - Stop it.

1080
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,493
Did you get it, Ratna?

1081
01:20:33,573 --> 01:20:36,937
Suraj had come to talk about
marrying Shobhana.

1082
01:20:37,017 --> 01:20:38,297
But felt shy and went away.

1083
01:20:38,457 --> 01:20:40,248
- You're enjoying this?
- Yes...

1084
01:20:40,328 --> 01:20:43,217
- Mom, they both want to marry each other.
- Keep quiet!

1085
01:20:43,707 --> 01:20:45,394
Why? Do you object to this relation?

1086
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,777
Yes, I do. Munshiji is our servant.

1087
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:50,017
And his daughter cannot
be our daughter in law.

1088
01:20:50,385 --> 01:20:51,665
You're strange, Ratna.

1089
01:20:51,745 --> 01:20:55,462
- I've never considered Munshiji a servant, but a friend.
- But...

1090
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:58,097
It is your greatness, sister
and brother in law.

1091
01:20:58,337 --> 01:21:00,729
- The world believes in only what it sees.
- You mean?

1092
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:03,537
To the world you are the master
and Munshiji your servant.

1093
01:21:03,617 --> 01:21:05,867
The times of master and servant
has passed, uncle.

1094
01:21:06,017 --> 01:21:07,697
Now are the days of equality, right?

1095
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:10,218
Why discuss on this matter?

1096
01:21:10,817 --> 01:21:13,617
We cannot tie relation with someone
lower in status to us.

1097
01:21:14,318 --> 01:21:16,497
I will choose the daughter
in law of this family.

1098
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:18,497
- Come, Vikram.
- Coming, sis.

1099
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:20,700
Forgive me, brother in law.

1100
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:24,097
You've never respected any
of my ideas till now.

1101
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:27,777
But do think over what
sister has said.

1102
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,697
Right, younger nephew?

1103
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:35,457
What are you thinking, Prakash?

1104
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:38,977
What if elder brother
knows of this, father?

1105
01:21:39,617 --> 01:21:41,537
Don't worry. Go and
tell your brother...

1106
01:21:41,617 --> 01:21:43,337
that I will talk to
Munshiji tomorrow.

1107
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:47,297
Brother in law takes Munshiji
as his friend.

1108
01:21:47,457 --> 01:21:50,977
And Munshiji takes brother
in law as his prey.

1109
01:21:51,402 --> 01:21:53,290
This is the signal of danger.

1110
01:21:53,864 --> 01:21:56,577
You made it clear in
front of everyone...

1111
01:21:56,657 --> 01:21:58,657
that you will choose
your daughter in law.

1112
01:21:58,897 --> 01:22:00,805
But brother will convince
you somehow...

1113
01:22:00,885 --> 01:22:03,485
and that daughter of Munshiji
will become your daughter in law.

1114
01:22:04,991 --> 01:22:07,178
Only God can save this house now.

1115
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:08,410
What nonsense you keep talking!

1116
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:11,297
You always find my ideas nonsense.

1117
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:14,237
And that Munshi who keeps
calling you 'Madam'...

1118
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:18,417
you and brother in law don't
know how cunning he is.

1119
01:22:18,497 --> 01:22:21,737
He has trapped Suraj
through his daughter.

1120
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:23,977
Now he will become your relative.

1121
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,883
Munshiji has forgotten his standing.

1122
01:22:27,312 --> 01:22:29,457
And he will get insulted
for this mistake.

1123
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:34,604
Dinu! Come here.

1124
01:22:37,948 --> 01:22:40,868
Cut off the leaves that are
falling outside the fence.

1125
01:22:41,427 --> 01:22:44,389
- Come, come, Munshiji. You're late.
- Greetings, sir.

1126
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:47,348
Greetings. Go and tell madam
that Munshiji is here.

1127
01:22:49,468 --> 01:22:51,868
Munshiji, I want to discuss
something with you.

1128
01:22:51,948 --> 01:22:53,668
Anything special, sir?

1129
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,508
I think we should get
Suraj married now.

1130
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,748
He has already chosen the girl.

1131
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,788
Then why wait, sir? Get
them married soon.

1132
01:23:03,908 --> 01:23:07,428
The girl who will marry
Suraj will be very lucky.

1133
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,106
That means, Munshiji...
listen carefully...

1134
01:23:12,186 --> 01:23:16,148
that if we propose to the girl's
family, they won't mind.

1135
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:20,401
- The girl's family might mind, sir.
- About what?

1136
01:23:21,045 --> 01:23:24,588
If they come to know that Suraj
is Janaki's son, they might mind.

1137
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:31,375
You've put me in confusion,
Munshiji.

1138
01:23:31,908 --> 01:23:36,937
There's no confusion, sir. The
world knows that Suraj is your son.

1139
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:39,637
So he should get a girl from a
high status and rich family.

1140
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:43,781
Munshiji, do you also believe
in status and rich family?

1141
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,154
The times have changed...

1142
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:49,191
but we still have to follow
it in the matters of marriage.

1143
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,031
Did you hear that? Munshiji
is talking sense.

1144
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:55,757
Please, make him understand.

1145
01:23:56,025 --> 01:23:57,785
To him the wish of a boy and girl...

1146
01:23:58,227 --> 01:24:00,505
are more important than
the prestige of a family.

1147
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:02,223
One cannot sacrifice the
prestige of the family...

1148
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:04,065
for the silly wishes of kids.

1149
01:24:06,092 --> 01:24:07,865
What are you thinking, sir?

1150
01:24:08,023 --> 01:24:11,385
I am thinking that what
will I tell Suraj.

1151
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:13,275
Don't worry about Suraj.

1152
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:16,825
He is my son and he will have
to agree to what I say.

1153
01:24:24,547 --> 01:24:26,105
Come, Kiran.

1154
01:24:29,301 --> 01:24:31,785
Perhaps you'd be surprised
to hear this.

1155
01:24:31,865 --> 01:24:35,305
I am stepping in this dance
hall after 3 years.

1156
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:40,808
I was the owner of this hotel
and also a cabaret dancer.

1157
01:24:40,946 --> 01:24:47,745
People from near and far came to
this hotel to watch my dance.

1158
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:51,505
I had been fond of dancing
since my childhood.

1159
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,100
When I used to come on stage...

1160
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:58,569
the hall would be filled
with the sound of claps.

1161
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:06,962
I would feel that the whole
world is welcoming me.

1162
01:25:07,696 --> 01:25:12,460
And I would dance out
of uncontrollable joy.

1163
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:37,660
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1164
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:41,100
today I will present a novel
item in front of you.

1165
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:57,226
'Come, come, my dear love'

1166
01:25:57,371 --> 01:26:01,466
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1167
01:26:01,546 --> 01:26:04,660
'... are only for you'

1168
01:26:14,732 --> 01:26:16,660
'Come, come, my dear love'

1169
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,900
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1170
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:23,940
'... are only for you'

1171
01:26:38,888 --> 01:26:42,980
'Come. You and I will be
somewhere else then'

1172
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:47,620
'These few moments are nothing,
but they are enough'

1173
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,660
'Come. You and I will be
somewhere else then'

1174
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:56,235
'These few moments are nothing,
but they are enough'

1175
01:26:56,315 --> 01:27:00,180
'My love is restless.
You are also waiting'

1176
01:27:00,624 --> 01:27:04,180
'You and I have only this evening'

1177
01:27:13,438 --> 01:27:15,536
'Come, come, my dear love'

1178
01:27:15,685 --> 01:27:19,380
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1179
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:22,420
'... are only for you'

1180
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:54,740
'How come you don't recognize me? '

1181
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,540
'The drink we drank together
last night.'

1182
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:03,540
'How come you don't recognize me? '

1183
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:08,116
'The drink we drank together
last night.'

1184
01:28:08,196 --> 01:28:12,220
'That glass, my dear, still
has the sign of my lips'

1185
01:28:12,558 --> 01:28:16,287
'See you are still holding
that glass'

1186
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:27,434
'Come, come, my dear love'

1187
01:28:27,514 --> 01:28:31,627
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1188
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:35,020
'... are only for you'

1189
01:28:42,476 --> 01:28:44,932
Hey! She's fallen down!

1190
01:28:46,732 --> 01:28:51,340
My leg was broken. From then
onwards I could not dance.

1191
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:57,340
Dance was my life. My life was
taken away from me, Kiran.

1192
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:02,060
I recall those old days today
as I stand in this hall.

1193
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,460
Forget those old days.

1194
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:09,260
You are a born artist, Kiran.
I want you to dance here.

1195
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,740
I dance here? In this hotel?

1196
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:17,340
Why? Does art fade away
if one dances in a hotel?

1197
01:29:17,992 --> 01:29:20,130
The world does not consider
it a decent thing.

1198
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:22,178
Whatever the people think...

1199
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:25,020
an artist considers
his art as his worship.

1200
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:28,398
And wherever you worship, that
place becomes a temple.

1201
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:30,489
But I cannot dance in this hotel.

1202
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:35,684
My mother is poor, but
she will never like...

1203
01:29:36,021 --> 01:29:38,409
people saying bad words
about her or her daughter.

1204
01:29:39,209 --> 01:29:42,569
Kiran, I've danced in
hotel all my life.

1205
01:29:43,415 --> 01:29:46,729
But no one has ever said anything
bad about me till now.

1206
01:29:47,577 --> 01:29:52,199
By showing one's art, one gains
prestige, fame and money.

1207
01:29:53,009 --> 01:29:55,962
You had said that your
mother is poor.

1208
01:29:56,991 --> 01:30:00,806
You can serve your mother
with your art.

1209
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:03,489
And also serve the art itself.

1210
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:05,929
Tell Kiran the true
state of affairs.

1211
01:30:06,529 --> 01:30:08,969
I do not want her to
know my troubles.

1212
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:12,249
And get distracted from her studies.

1213
01:30:13,017 --> 01:30:14,489
She's studied enough, Janaki.

1214
01:30:15,784 --> 01:30:17,504
If a boy had born to you
instead of Kiran...

1215
01:30:17,921 --> 01:30:19,649
he would have earned
some money for you.

1216
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:22,014
And would have been the
support of your old age.

1217
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:24,009
- What are you thinking, Kiran?
- Well...

1218
01:30:24,855 --> 01:30:27,855
- What have you decided?
- I will dance in your hotel.

1219
01:30:29,062 --> 01:30:32,577
Thank you, Kiran. You've
given me a new life.

1220
01:30:33,147 --> 01:30:35,743
I will arrange such a
grand program for you...

1221
01:30:35,823 --> 01:30:38,278
that everyone will be amazed.

1222
01:30:43,362 --> 01:30:44,362
Brother!

1223
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:48,034
Why are you standing in
the dark like that?

1224
01:30:48,496 --> 01:30:50,922
Now the life of both of us is
going to be lighted by love.

1225
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:54,882
This tape recorder had recorded
the voice of your heart.

1226
01:30:55,442 --> 01:30:57,282
Now listen the voice of my heart.

1227
01:30:57,362 --> 01:30:59,802
- I will tell you the girl's name later.
- Let it be, Prakash.

1228
01:31:00,618 --> 01:31:03,722
Erase mine and Shobhana's
voice from it for good.

1229
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:08,202
- Brother!
- Never... never again play this game of voices.

1230
01:31:12,202 --> 01:31:13,501
Father, you were going...

1231
01:31:13,581 --> 01:31:15,482
to talk to Munshiji about
brother's marriage.

1232
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,962
Yes, but what Munshiji
said was right.

1233
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,062
I wanted Shobhana to be
my daughter in law.

1234
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,162
That she would marry Suraj, but...

1235
01:31:23,242 --> 01:31:25,082
And yet you agreed to mother?

1236
01:31:25,539 --> 01:31:29,402
I would have convinced Ratna any
time. She's a mother after all.

1237
01:31:29,482 --> 01:31:30,697
She would have forgotten...

1238
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,322
this gap of high and low
status within a few days.

1239
01:31:33,882 --> 01:31:38,042
- But regretfully, Munshiji minds this relationship.
- Munshiji?

1240
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:40,762
- Yes, he refused to it.
- I see.

1241
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:44,282
And after his denial it was no
use taking this matter further.

1242
01:31:44,622 --> 01:31:48,682
Listen, child, tell Suraj that
I could not fulfill his wish.

1243
01:31:55,847 --> 01:31:58,682
Not every love story ends
successfully, Shobhana.

1244
01:32:00,397 --> 01:32:05,882
It would be better for us
to forget each other.

1245
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:08,282
Will we be able to forget?

1246
01:32:11,821 --> 01:32:19,002
What can I do? I will have
to accept my mother's wish.

1247
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:21,450
Brother, you should have also
loved after asking mother.

1248
01:32:21,818 --> 01:32:23,642
This is cowardice!

1249
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:25,930
To give up one's love
for mother's wish...

1250
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,538
is not cowardice, Prakash;
it is sacrifice.

1251
01:32:28,704 --> 01:32:31,930
It is Munshiji who refused,
not mother.

1252
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,610
This is an accusation on my father.

1253
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,542
He was insulted by being
called a servant.

1254
01:32:37,328 --> 01:32:40,010
And that's why he refused
to save his dignity.

1255
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:43,593
And you took that as a code of law?

1256
01:32:44,097 --> 01:32:46,245
Come with me; I'll get
you both married.

1257
01:32:46,605 --> 01:32:48,282
Mother will have to bless you then.

1258
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:51,066
Mother will never give us
her blessings, Prakash.

1259
01:32:51,735 --> 01:32:53,770
You don't know what she has told me.

1260
01:32:55,382 --> 01:32:57,290
I can never hurt the feelings
of my mother.

1261
01:32:57,779 --> 01:33:00,984
You cannot hurt mother, but
you can break her heart?

1262
01:33:01,266 --> 01:33:03,370
Why do you quarrel
with him, Prakash?

1263
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:05,210
He cannot hurt his mother.

1264
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:08,730
I cannot bear my father
being insulted.

1265
01:33:09,691 --> 01:33:11,855
Let us bear what's written
in our destiny.

1266
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:16,730
All right, Shobhana. No one can
stop those who want to die.

1267
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:19,610
God bless you!

1268
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:40,730
Prakash, whose car did Kiran go in?

1269
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:42,650
Don't know. Let's check.

1270
01:34:04,249 --> 01:34:05,650
Prakash, this is the car.

1271
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,530
Yes, this is the car,
but where is Kiran?

1272
01:34:08,746 --> 01:34:10,450
Let's go in and check.

1273
01:34:39,809 --> 01:34:41,969
'Come, come, my dear love'

1274
01:34:42,049 --> 01:34:45,849
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1275
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:49,689
'... are only for you'

1276
01:34:54,887 --> 01:34:58,329
'You are a coward. Why
wouldn't I say it? '

1277
01:34:58,874 --> 01:35:03,169
'Look at me. My heart is
damp and yet I smile'

1278
01:35:03,249 --> 01:35:07,009
'You are a coward. Why
wouldn't I say it? '

1279
01:35:07,463 --> 01:35:11,689
'Look at me. My heart is
damp and yet I smile'

1280
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:15,529
'Whatever you say today, dear'

1281
01:35:15,714 --> 01:35:19,529
'This is popular news that
I have your love today'

1282
01:35:28,462 --> 01:35:30,569
'Come, come, my dear love'

1283
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:34,729
'Dear, this night, and
also my words.'

1284
01:35:34,849 --> 01:35:37,609
'... are only for you'

1285
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:07,410
- Driver!
- Yes?

1286
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:09,690
Do you know where is the girl
you brought in this car?

1287
01:36:09,957 --> 01:36:13,170
- In room number 17, with Mr. Reen.
- Mr. Reen?

1288
01:36:14,161 --> 01:36:15,161
Some work.

1289
01:36:15,787 --> 01:36:18,387
- Yes. You have some work with her? Yes, I want to meet her.
- Ok.

1290
01:36:20,129 --> 01:36:23,210
- Here's your prize for today.
- Thank you.

1291
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:26,970
- Go down; my car will drop you home, ok?
- Yes.

1292
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:48,730
- Prakash?
- Why do you look scared?

1293
01:36:48,997 --> 01:36:50,701
Because I've come here suddenly...

1294
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:51,881
and have seen your true face?

1295
01:36:51,905 --> 01:36:55,925
- Prakash!
- I didn't know you would stoop so low.

1296
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:58,031
- Is this your price for one evening?
- Shut up!

1297
01:36:58,311 --> 01:37:01,351
You should be ashamed to talk
such things about me.

1298
01:37:02,541 --> 01:37:06,231
You love me, and yet you insult
your love this way?

1299
01:37:07,151 --> 01:37:09,191
What does coming here and
this money mean then?

1300
01:37:09,486 --> 01:37:12,711
I had come here to dance, and this
money is my payment for that.

1301
01:37:13,257 --> 01:37:14,871
But why did you need
to dance in a hotel?

1302
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:17,591
- I have some problems.
- Why didn't you tell me of them?

1303
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:19,631
I didn't want to tell anyone.

1304
01:37:19,804 --> 01:37:21,084
But looks like your suspicion...

1305
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:22,951
would not be cleared
without telling you.

1306
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:25,074
The last time I went home,
I came to know that...

1307
01:37:25,098 --> 01:37:29,991
how much trouble my mother is
going through to make me study.

1308
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,551
She is bearing much pain for me.

1309
01:37:33,963 --> 01:37:35,751
I came back without meeting her.

1310
01:37:36,618 --> 01:37:39,831
When I was returning I decided
that I will quit studies.

1311
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:42,791
I will work and help my mother.

1312
01:37:43,551 --> 01:37:45,591
I met Mrs. Reen in the function.

1313
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:50,071
She offered me to dance here,
which I could not refuse.

1314
01:37:50,151 --> 01:37:54,043
I thought I will be able
to continue my studies...

1315
01:37:54,123 --> 01:37:56,203
and will also help lessen
the burden on my mother.

1316
01:37:56,276 --> 01:38:02,551
But you doubted me... told
me bad words. Go from here!

1317
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:06,471
I've done a big mistake, Kiran.

1318
01:38:06,551 --> 01:38:09,275
Punish me as you like,
but please, forgive me.

1319
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:11,831
I love you more than my life.

1320
01:38:12,311 --> 01:38:15,191
I swear on you that I will
never again doubt you.

1321
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:19,991
Please, one more chance. Forgive me.

1322
01:38:20,631 --> 01:38:23,031
- I forgive you.
- Thank you.

1323
01:38:24,634 --> 01:38:26,382
Now tell me what can I do for you.

1324
01:38:26,462 --> 01:38:28,791
Not now. First learn
to be independent.

1325
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:31,471
Then I will give away
all my worries to you.

1326
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:33,471
And rest carefree.

1327
01:38:33,837 --> 01:38:36,471
Come. Mr. Reen's driver
must be waiting for me.

1328
01:38:38,187 --> 01:38:41,151
No, you won't go in Mr. Reen's
car. You will go in my car.

1329
01:38:41,327 --> 01:38:46,511
- Not again.
- I am not forcing you; I am requesting you.

1330
01:38:46,911 --> 01:38:48,712
All right. Come.

1331
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:56,349
Janaki, is there a
letter from Kiran?

1332
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,430
No, it's a money order.

1333
01:38:58,615 --> 01:39:01,830
- And see, she's sent me 200 rupees.
- Really! - Yes.

1334
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:04,150
Listen to what she writes.

1335
01:39:04,556 --> 01:39:07,510
Mother, I felt very bored
after the study time.

1336
01:39:08,015 --> 01:39:12,150
So I give tuition to two
kids in spare time.

1337
01:39:12,633 --> 01:39:14,597
I am sending you this money...

1338
01:39:14,943 --> 01:39:17,270
because if I keep them with me,
they might be spent off.

1339
01:39:17,762 --> 01:39:23,350
Shashi is fine, and waiting
for aunt Sarla's money order.

1340
01:39:23,747 --> 01:39:25,270
Your daughter, Kiran.

1341
01:39:28,461 --> 01:39:33,270
See, sister? I had told you that
education does not go in vain.

1342
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:38,070
Kiran has filled up the lack
of a son, hasn't she?

1343
01:39:38,408 --> 01:39:44,124
- Hasn't she, sister?
- Really, Janaki, Kiran is your son.

1344
01:39:45,716 --> 01:39:49,590
Yes, sister Sarla, she
is a son. A son.

1345
01:39:51,545 --> 01:39:55,896
- Who is it?
- It's me, madam, Parkar. - Come in.

1346
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,507
See? She called us in as soon
as she heard my name.

1347
01:39:58,587 --> 01:40:00,710
I'll be right back.

1348
01:40:07,986 --> 01:40:10,148
Madam, my prestige...

1349
01:40:10,228 --> 01:40:11,940
is now in your hands, or
rather under your feet.

1350
01:40:11,964 --> 01:40:14,031
I don't get you, dear.

1351
01:40:14,688 --> 01:40:15,724
The thing is, madam...

1352
01:40:15,804 --> 01:40:18,615
that I told one of my friends
that I know you well.

1353
01:40:18,909 --> 01:40:21,158
Now he wants me to arrange a
meeting between you and him.

1354
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:23,084
Now tell me, what should I do?

1355
01:40:24,367 --> 01:40:27,884
What's there to worry so much
about? I will meet your friend.

1356
01:40:28,163 --> 01:40:30,324
- Where is your friend?
- Standing outside.

1357
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:33,073
- Call him in.
- Thank you very much, madam.

1358
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:34,153
Thank you very much.

1359
01:40:35,982 --> 01:40:37,804
I am sorry.

1360
01:40:40,609 --> 01:40:42,244
Come in, dear.

1361
01:40:57,228 --> 01:41:00,188
- Good evening, madam.
- So this is your friend?

1362
01:41:00,577 --> 01:41:03,468
- Yes, Mr. Raja (king).
- The king of which state?

1363
01:41:04,383 --> 01:41:05,828
My name is Raja, madam.

1364
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:09,434
Oh! I see. So you're a king
just for name's sake.

1365
01:41:10,368 --> 01:41:13,388
Not only for name's sake, madam.
I am also a king by heart.

1366
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:17,908
I want to spend this
evening with you.

1367
01:41:19,925 --> 01:41:21,748
This evening is over.

1368
01:41:24,361 --> 01:41:25,548
But the night's not over yet.

1369
01:41:26,988 --> 01:41:29,708
Tell me, in which hotel
should I book a room?

1370
01:41:30,378 --> 01:41:33,508
Mr. Raja, you are a very,
very smart person.

1371
01:41:33,948 --> 01:41:35,148
Thank you, my sweetheart.

1372
01:41:36,944 --> 01:41:39,663
Talk business. What do you charge?

1373
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,890
I don't charge; I slap!

1374
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,708
You're beaten again, Raja.

1375
01:41:48,628 --> 01:41:50,548
Looks like you didn't recognize her.

1376
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:54,562
It's surprising. You
didn't recognize me...

1377
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:56,588
even after being beater
the 3rd time.

1378
01:41:56,779 --> 01:41:59,148
- You?
- Yes, me.

1379
01:42:00,347 --> 01:42:03,968
Very good. A college student
in the morning.

1380
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:06,067
And a cabaret dancer at night.

1381
01:42:07,517 --> 01:42:11,467
You've insulted me the 3rd time
today. I will revenge for that.

1382
01:42:12,827 --> 01:42:15,307
Those who speak too much don't act.

1383
01:42:15,757 --> 01:42:20,147
If I were in your place, I would
have smashed so hard...

1384
01:42:22,233 --> 01:42:25,587
Enough, Prakash. This punishment
is enough for today.

1385
01:42:27,312 --> 01:42:31,587
My name is Raja, Prakash. I
will break your bones today.

1386
01:43:20,469 --> 01:43:23,714
- Hallo. Hallo.
- Why are you peeking in, Parkar?

1387
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:26,490
Raja is being welcomed inside.

1388
01:43:26,514 --> 01:43:27,811
Is he? Then we should also go in...

1389
01:43:27,835 --> 01:43:31,007
No, no! Let him enjoy.
You guys go now.

1390
01:43:47,973 --> 01:43:49,564
Mr. Reen, good that you've come.

1391
01:43:49,896 --> 01:43:54,159
Madam wants to see you. Go in.
Can I go?

1392
01:44:08,467 --> 01:44:11,987
Get out of here, or I will hand
you over to the police. Got it?

1393
01:44:12,812 --> 01:44:14,867
- Ok.
- Get out!

1394
01:44:16,846 --> 01:44:18,166
The wound is deep.

1395
01:44:18,374 --> 01:44:20,686
It is necessary to take an
injection and tie bandage.

1396
01:44:21,557 --> 01:44:24,366
Why need such a long
treatment for that?

1397
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,742
Just put your hand here,
and it will be fine.

1398
01:44:26,822 --> 01:44:29,006
Don't joke. I will go and change.

1399
01:44:29,086 --> 01:44:30,606
Then we'll go to the doctor.

1400
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:36,686
I will come with you, not to the
doctor, but to your mother.

1401
01:44:37,561 --> 01:44:40,737
She lives 100 miles far from here.

1402
01:44:41,228 --> 01:44:43,726
Doesn't matter even if she
lives 1000 miles away.

1403
01:44:44,307 --> 01:44:47,690
I will go to her today. It is
necessary to tell her every thing.

1404
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:49,806
Tell her what?

1405
01:44:50,071 --> 01:44:55,097
That we love each other,
want to marry...

1406
01:44:55,177 --> 01:44:57,702
and have promised to
live with each other.

1407
01:44:58,373 --> 01:45:01,286
And you will agree to me and
convince your mother...

1408
01:45:01,366 --> 01:45:02,926
that whatever I am saying is true.

1409
01:45:03,286 --> 01:45:05,658
I am not shameless as you are...

1410
01:45:05,914 --> 01:45:08,606
who would accept her love
in front of her mother.

1411
01:45:08,807 --> 01:45:11,886
It is not shameful to tell one's
feelings to one's parents.

1412
01:45:12,328 --> 01:45:14,246
Rather it's shameful to hide.

1413
01:45:14,397 --> 01:45:15,686
And you know that one cannot...

1414
01:45:15,766 --> 01:45:18,362
progress with being shy
in this modern days.

1415
01:45:18,826 --> 01:45:21,806
Just as our Munshiji didn't
let his daughter progress.

1416
01:45:22,285 --> 01:45:24,606
But the son of Thakur
Virendrasingh...

1417
01:45:24,686 --> 01:45:28,139
does not want any obstacles
in his wedding.

1418
01:45:28,768 --> 01:45:31,522
Enough! Enough! Thakur
Virendrasingh's son...

1419
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:34,461
if you say such boring dialogues
of some idiot play...

1420
01:45:34,541 --> 01:45:39,526
in front of my mother, she will
consider you some joker...

1421
01:45:39,606 --> 01:45:42,846
and deny to marry
her daughter to you.

1422
01:45:43,024 --> 01:45:45,267
I can hear that denial,
but I will not accept it.

1423
01:45:46,035 --> 01:45:52,606
Listen carefully, pretty one, I've
vowed that I will make you mine.

1424
01:45:53,166 --> 01:45:55,136
And even if God himself
tells me that...

1425
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:57,566
you cannot marry Kiran, do
you know what will I answer?

1426
01:45:58,116 --> 01:46:00,326
Mr. God, it is none
of your business.

1427
01:46:03,257 --> 01:46:06,737
Get ready fast. We'll
move from here, ok?

1428
01:46:12,465 --> 01:46:15,486
Who's knocking on the door
so late in the night?

1429
01:46:16,063 --> 01:46:18,046
Coming, dear.

1430
01:46:23,452 --> 01:46:26,966
- Who is it?
- I've come from Kiran's college. Open the door.

1431
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,489
- Greetings.
- What happened to my daughter?

1432
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:35,646
Don't be scared. Nothing's happened
to her and she's fine.

1433
01:46:36,136 --> 01:46:37,486
My name is Prakash.

1434
01:46:37,686 --> 01:46:40,686
I study with her at the college
and want to marry her.

1435
01:46:41,775 --> 01:46:45,728
What? You... you want
to marry Kiran?

1436
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,493
Yes, and she also
wants to marry me.

1437
01:46:47,573 --> 01:46:50,626
You can ask her if you want.
Wait, I'll call her.

1438
01:46:50,706 --> 01:46:51,886
Kiran!

1439
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:55,248
No need to feel shy; I've told
your mother everything.

1440
01:46:55,453 --> 01:46:58,646
- Come.
- I won't come. - Come, dear.

1441
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:11,766
What is he saying, child?
I don't get this.

1442
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:18,381
- Speak, child.
- What do I say, mother?

1443
01:47:21,972 --> 01:47:24,141
Kiran is not going to
say any thing, auntie.

1444
01:47:24,573 --> 01:47:27,141
Hear this tape and you'll
get every thing.

1445
01:47:27,453 --> 01:47:29,941
Shall we eat something in the
meanwhile? We are hungry.

1446
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:34,261
Here, listen to it. Kiran, show
me the way to the kitchen.

1447
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:36,821
Who would accept her love
in front of her mother.

1448
01:47:37,338 --> 01:47:40,067
It is not shameful to tell one's
feelings to one's parents.

1449
01:47:40,748 --> 01:47:42,461
Rather it's shameful to hide.

1450
01:47:43,969 --> 01:47:45,509
What was the need to let
mother hear that tape?

1451
01:47:45,533 --> 01:47:47,277
Don't know what rubbish
might be stored in it.

1452
01:47:47,301 --> 01:47:49,434
Nothing stored in it except
our love story.

1453
01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:52,202
You're strange! What might
she think of us?

1454
01:47:52,346 --> 01:47:54,866
What might she think? Are we saying
something new to this world?

1455
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:57,002
We're doing what our ancestors
have already done.

1456
01:47:57,082 --> 01:47:58,962
Now I won't be able to look
into my mom's eyes.

1457
01:47:59,231 --> 01:48:01,282
Who is asking you to
look in her eyes?

1458
01:48:02,634 --> 01:48:04,682
Just walk behind your groom
like a shy bride...

1459
01:48:04,762 --> 01:48:07,882
with the drape on the head
and eyes facing down.

1460
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:11,882
- What did you say?
- Please, make tea for me.

1461
01:48:12,802 --> 01:48:15,875
Just as our Munshiji didn't
let his daughter progress.

1462
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:18,042
Munshi Dindayal?

1463
01:48:18,122 --> 01:48:20,922
But the son of Thakur Virendrasingh
does not want...

1464
01:48:21,082 --> 01:48:24,922
Thakur Virendrasingh? He is
Thakur Virendrasingh's son?

1465
01:48:26,444 --> 01:48:29,298
He is my son? My son!

1466
01:48:31,002 --> 01:48:33,722
No, no! What is this terrible
incident, Lord?

1467
01:48:34,686 --> 01:48:36,282
A brother wants to marry his sister?

1468
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:42,401
No, no! This cannot happen, God.

1469
01:48:43,101 --> 01:48:46,842
Tell me, O Lord, what do I do now?

1470
01:48:48,748 --> 01:48:50,548
You've heard the tape
recorder, auntie.

1471
01:48:50,628 --> 01:48:53,202
Now bless us quickly and
sweeten our mouths.

1472
01:48:55,806 --> 01:48:57,402
What is it, auntie?
Why are you silent?

1473
01:48:57,482 --> 01:48:59,962
- This marriage cannot take place.
- Auntie!

1474
01:49:03,762 --> 01:49:05,682
You are Thakur Virendrasingh's
son, right?

1475
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:09,242
- Yes, do you know him?
- Very well.

1476
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,482
He is a very rich and famous man.

1477
01:49:12,122 --> 01:49:15,962
I cannot let my daughter
marry his son.

1478
01:49:16,042 --> 01:49:17,962
Is his being rich a crime, auntie?

1479
01:49:18,522 --> 01:49:20,402
People have exaggerated his fame.

1480
01:49:20,962 --> 01:49:24,562
You are denying just as Munshiji
denied, scared of his fame.

1481
01:49:24,682 --> 01:49:26,802
He ruined the life of my brother
and his own daughter.

1482
01:49:27,245 --> 01:49:31,621
- Brother? Which brother?
- My elder bro, Surajprakash.

1483
01:49:32,105 --> 01:49:34,362
What did you say your name was?

1484
01:49:34,596 --> 01:49:36,082
I told you it's Chandraprakash.

1485
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:40,722
My brother is like an angel.
He accepted Mushiji's wish.

1486
01:49:41,177 --> 01:49:43,762
But I won't accept either
your denial or my parents'.

1487
01:49:44,442 --> 01:49:48,562
You will have to bless us. Please,
auntie, agree to us.

1488
01:49:48,882 --> 01:49:54,002
Now that you've decided,
how can I refuse?

1489
01:49:54,306 --> 01:49:55,353
Thank you, auntie.

1490
01:49:55,433 --> 01:49:58,282
Now get ready fast and come
with me to meet my parents.

1491
01:49:58,812 --> 01:50:02,608
Not now, child. I will
come to meet him soon.

1492
01:50:02,816 --> 01:50:06,002
- Really, auntie?
- Yes, I will surely come.

1493
01:50:06,215 --> 01:50:09,042
I will inform Kiran before coming.

1494
01:50:09,614 --> 01:50:14,082
Kiran, your mommy is great!

1495
01:50:15,538 --> 01:50:18,002
- Mother!
- My child!

1496
01:50:24,031 --> 01:50:25,351
We take your leave now, auntie.

1497
01:50:25,431 --> 01:50:27,831
We are to attend the college
next morning. Come, Kiran.

1498
01:50:28,287 --> 01:50:30,471
- Go, Kiran.
- Bye, mom.

1499
01:50:36,582 --> 01:50:38,871
May Lord always keep you happy!

1500
01:50:40,231 --> 01:50:43,191
You are lying, Raja. Prakash
can never do that.

1501
01:50:43,777 --> 01:50:46,406
If you think I'm accusing Prakash...

1502
01:50:46,778 --> 01:50:49,431
come with me and see for yourself.

1503
01:50:49,606 --> 01:50:51,791
Elder nephew, I will
also come with you.

1504
01:50:51,871 --> 01:50:54,711
Where are you planning
to go, brother in law?

1505
01:50:55,046 --> 01:50:56,365
Why don't you also come
with us, brother in law?

1506
01:50:56,389 --> 01:50:57,484
Where? What's the matter?

1507
01:50:57,564 --> 01:51:00,770
It's nothing, father. Raja wants
to take me to a program.

1508
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:03,111
Uncle is saying that he
will also come along.

1509
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:05,991
Brother, your hair is turning grey.

1510
01:51:06,071 --> 01:51:07,854
You are not at the age
of attending programs.

1511
01:51:08,027 --> 01:51:10,471
Your sister is going to
the temple; go with her.

1512
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:12,074
You might wash some of your sins.

1513
01:51:12,471 --> 01:51:14,687
You don't hear the whole matter,
and then keep scolding me.

1514
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:16,901
- Ok, tell me.
- I won't say any thing now.

1515
01:51:17,783 --> 01:51:19,631
Child, I've got rid of your uncle.

1516
01:51:19,711 --> 01:51:22,540
Now run off to the program,
or he'll be after you again.

1517
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:03,687
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1518
01:52:08,022 --> 01:52:12,439
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1519
01:52:12,519 --> 01:52:16,822
'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! '

1520
01:52:16,902 --> 01:52:21,117
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1521
01:52:21,197 --> 01:52:25,422
'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! '

1522
01:52:25,502 --> 01:52:29,582
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1523
01:52:51,982 --> 01:52:59,982
'That naughty guy looked very
handsome. How do I explain you? '

1524
01:53:00,784 --> 01:53:08,662
'He was as fearless
as you in fighting'

1525
01:53:09,222 --> 01:53:13,462
'Look at this dark night, dear'

1526
01:53:13,542 --> 01:53:17,302
'Look at this dark night, dear'

1527
01:53:17,382 --> 01:53:21,622
'It created such a tragedy, dear'

1528
01:53:21,702 --> 01:53:24,102
'He held my hand and hugged.'

1529
01:53:26,022 --> 01:53:30,262
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1530
01:53:30,513 --> 01:53:34,582
'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! '

1531
01:53:34,662 --> 01:53:39,062
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1532
01:54:09,942 --> 01:54:17,942
'Since that day, dear, some
lightening shines in my body'

1533
01:54:18,502 --> 01:54:26,182
'I am crazy. Why do I dress
up and come to meet you? '

1534
01:54:26,736 --> 01:54:30,779
'I left from home alone'

1535
01:54:30,859 --> 01:54:34,688
'I left from home alone'

1536
01:54:34,768 --> 01:54:38,929
'What a terrible thing I have done! '

1537
01:54:39,009 --> 01:54:40,982
'He held my hand and hugged.'

1538
01:54:43,222 --> 01:54:47,502
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1539
01:54:47,727 --> 01:54:51,782
'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! '

1540
01:54:51,862 --> 01:54:56,170
'He held my hand and hugged
me in the dark street'

1541
01:54:56,250 --> 01:55:00,382
'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! '

1542
01:55:00,928 --> 01:55:02,302
'O my God! '

1543
01:55:13,277 --> 01:55:17,062
Prakash, I will wash the
makeup and change. Ok?

1544
01:55:17,304 --> 01:55:19,304
- Perfectly all right.
- Then we'll leave together.

1545
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:27,622
I get it now. So it's you
who brought Suraj here?

1546
01:55:27,702 --> 01:55:28,874
You can take it that way, dear.

1547
01:55:28,898 --> 01:55:31,382
Ok, now tell me something, dear.

1548
01:55:31,462 --> 01:55:33,502
What will you gain by
making them quarrel?

1549
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,262
- I will get what I want.
- You mean?

1550
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:40,302
Kiran will not be able to meet
Prakash from today onwards.

1551
01:55:40,504 --> 01:55:44,222
- And start meeting you?!
- I hate her. - I see.

1552
01:55:44,877 --> 01:55:46,477
I will get her thrown
out of the college.

1553
01:55:47,672 --> 01:55:49,982
- I will insult her on every step.
- Very good.

1554
01:55:50,364 --> 01:55:52,222
She will cry, she will suffer...

1555
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:56,142
and will fall at my feet some
day to ask forgiveness.

1556
01:55:58,342 --> 01:56:00,462
Why are you coming with me? Go back.

1557
01:56:00,862 --> 01:56:02,742
Is it wrong if I walk a
few more steps with you?

1558
01:56:02,782 --> 01:56:05,142
Yes, the name of that badness
is Shashi, and she is awake.

1559
01:56:05,222 --> 01:56:08,062
She is awake, and also
hearing her insult.

1560
01:56:08,321 --> 01:56:09,766
I am going, dear.

1561
01:56:09,893 --> 01:56:14,702
Why such a hurry? Say some thing
to me; listen to some thing.

1562
01:56:15,262 --> 01:56:16,662
It's too late; go to sleep.

1563
01:56:16,742 --> 01:56:20,502
There's a letter from Janaki
auntie. She has a message for you.

1564
01:56:20,582 --> 01:56:21,902
For me? What does she write?

1565
01:56:22,193 --> 01:56:24,942
She writes that she will stay
at Munshi Dindayal's place.

1566
01:56:25,432 --> 01:56:29,742
- Tell that to Prakash. So I've told you.
- So I've heard.

1567
01:56:30,182 --> 01:56:31,600
Kiran, we will go to...

1568
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:32,878
Munshiji's place tomorrow
after the college.

1569
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:34,942
- Ok, good night.
- Good night.

1570
01:56:36,786 --> 01:56:38,222
Why did you read my letter?

1571
01:56:38,302 --> 01:56:40,662
It's a postcard. The postman
must have read it, too.

1572
01:56:40,742 --> 01:56:41,885
Don't blabber.

1573
01:56:41,965 --> 01:56:44,622
- Kiran, shall I tell you something?
- Tell me.

1574
01:56:45,282 --> 01:56:46,847
You will be going to your
matrimonial house tomorrow.

1575
01:56:46,871 --> 01:56:51,662
- Dress up nicely.
- Go in. Go!

1576
01:56:56,366 --> 01:56:58,942
Brother, you're still awake? Why
haven't you gone to sleep?

1577
01:56:59,708 --> 01:57:02,662
Who was the girl with whom you
were dancing at the hotel?

1578
01:57:03,471 --> 01:57:04,671
You had gone to the hotel?

1579
01:57:05,028 --> 01:57:07,159
I had to go to see your deeds.

1580
01:57:08,398 --> 01:57:10,135
When Raja told me I could
not believe, but...

1581
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:11,965
So you went there just
because Raja told you?

1582
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:15,514
- He's a big scoundrel.
- And you're worse than him.

1583
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,831
You're ready to defame...

1584
01:57:17,911 --> 01:57:20,524
the prestige of our family
for a mere dancer?

1585
01:57:21,361 --> 01:57:22,514
He is a very good girl, brother.

1586
01:57:22,538 --> 01:57:24,676
I wanted you to listen
to her voice that day.

1587
01:57:24,918 --> 01:57:27,533
I've listened to her voice
and also seen her face.

1588
01:57:28,204 --> 01:57:29,439
And also seen the glow on her face...

1589
01:57:29,463 --> 01:57:31,623
which was a show for the people.

1590
01:57:32,854 --> 01:57:37,427
And now she wants to trap
you and blot our prestige.

1591
01:57:39,503 --> 01:57:40,503
I won't let that happen.

1592
01:57:40,714 --> 01:57:41,887
The one you're calling a dancer...

1593
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:43,751
is a daughter of decent parents.

1594
01:57:44,028 --> 01:57:45,428
She studies with me at the college.

1595
01:57:45,529 --> 01:57:47,249
Studies at the college
and dances at hotels.

1596
01:57:47,909 --> 01:57:48,909
Is this her decency?

1597
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,831
One does not lose his decency
just by dancing at hotels.

1598
01:57:52,509 --> 01:57:54,631
She dances to help her poor mother.

1599
01:57:55,207 --> 01:57:57,431
She's found a good
excuse to fool you.

1600
01:57:57,892 --> 01:58:01,271
Your giving away your love to
please mother was sacrifice.

1601
01:58:01,815 --> 01:58:03,009
And if she dances at a hotel...

1602
01:58:03,033 --> 01:58:04,831
to help her mother,
that's an excuse?

1603
01:58:05,521 --> 01:58:07,641
Decency is not a private
property of any one.

1604
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,241
The rich ones have to take...

1605
01:58:09,321 --> 01:58:11,201
the help of money to
prove their decency.

1606
01:58:11,401 --> 01:58:13,361
While to the poor, decency
is their only property.

1607
01:58:13,494 --> 01:58:14,784
I don't believe in...

1608
01:58:14,864 --> 01:58:16,744
this segregation of the
rich and poor either.

1609
01:58:17,001 --> 01:58:18,766
But I do believe in
familial prestige.

1610
01:58:18,846 --> 01:58:20,881
I assure you of that, brother.

1611
01:58:21,132 --> 01:58:22,417
Kiran's mother is coming
here tomorrow.

1612
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:25,561
Meet her and you'll know how
good those people are.

1613
01:58:26,446 --> 01:58:28,121
If that is so, I promise you...

1614
01:58:28,909 --> 01:58:32,860
I won't let you sacrifice
your love as I did.

1615
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:34,841
Thank you, brother.

1616
01:58:35,361 --> 01:58:42,650
Raja, if you still have any
tricks left, use them, too.

1617
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:46,379
So that you won't regret
later. Get out!

1618
01:58:52,446 --> 01:58:53,961
That's fine, Janaki.

1619
01:58:55,001 --> 01:58:57,481
But marrying Kiran to
Prakash is impossible.

1620
01:58:58,321 --> 01:59:01,161
Why? Will Mr. Thakur refuse?

1621
01:59:01,961 --> 01:59:04,841
No, he won't refuse.
He is like an angel.

1622
01:59:06,131 --> 01:59:08,568
But, Janaki, your daughter
is not to be...

1623
01:59:08,648 --> 01:59:11,881
the daughter in law of Mr.
Thakur, but that of his family.

1624
01:59:13,422 --> 01:59:15,920
And daughters of lower
status families...

1625
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,920
cannot be the daughters
in law of that family.

1626
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:21,161
I had washed everything out
of my memory, Munshiji.

1627
01:59:22,281 --> 01:59:25,641
But destiny has brought me
again at this crossroad.

1628
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:29,161
Tell me what should I do.

1629
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:35,561
Janaki, if you want to save
your dignity like I did...

1630
01:59:36,005 --> 01:59:37,845
convince Kiran in any
way and take her back.

1631
01:59:39,161 --> 01:59:41,401
How will I be able to
convince her, Munshiji?

1632
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:46,081
I will do that. I will
tell her that...

1633
01:59:46,761 --> 01:59:49,601
for years of my loyalty
towards them...

1634
01:59:49,681 --> 01:59:55,041
I got the disappointment of
my dear daughter in return.

1635
01:59:57,191 --> 02:00:00,148
Tell me, Janaki, how
will you go there...

1636
02:00:00,228 --> 02:00:01,761
and propose for your daughter?

1637
02:00:02,429 --> 02:00:06,081
Father is right, auntie.
Don't go there.

1638
02:00:07,044 --> 02:00:10,401
No one gets anything except
insults from that family.

1639
02:00:13,955 --> 02:00:16,161
Kiran, your mother is going
to meet my mother today.

1640
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,640
I hope you won't feel shy.

1641
02:00:21,345 --> 02:00:23,185
Greetings, auntie. Greetings,
Munshiji.

1642
02:00:23,351 --> 02:00:25,676
Mother, you never told me
anything about Munshiji.

1643
02:00:25,939 --> 02:00:28,091
- Greetings, Munshiji.
- God bless you, child.

1644
02:00:28,285 --> 02:00:30,401
Come, auntie; I've come to take you.

1645
02:00:30,481 --> 02:00:32,161
Everyone's waiting for you.

1646
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:37,348
Kiran, we cannot go at
Mr. Thakur's place.

1647
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:40,161
- What are you saying?
- Why not, mother?

1648
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:43,850
I don't want you and
Janaki to go there.

1649
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,730
There has to be some reason
to deny, Munshiji.

1650
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:48,806
My status is not so...

1651
02:00:49,083 --> 02:00:51,802
that I can propose them
for your marriage.

1652
02:00:52,452 --> 02:00:55,123
And if you go, your mother
will be insulted so badly...

1653
02:00:55,687 --> 02:00:57,167
that you won't be able to bear it.

1654
02:00:57,221 --> 02:00:58,890
It is you who are insulting,
Munshiji.

1655
02:00:59,988 --> 02:01:02,554
My brother and father
are not so bad...

1656
02:01:02,634 --> 02:01:04,915
that they would call someone
home and then insult them.

1657
02:01:05,169 --> 02:01:08,114
Rest assured, auntie. You
will get the same respect...

1658
02:01:08,246 --> 02:01:10,090
in my house that a girl's
mother should get.

1659
02:01:10,727 --> 02:01:13,610
Mother, I swear on you...

1660
02:01:13,992 --> 02:01:15,850
that if you are insulted
in that house...

1661
02:01:16,494 --> 02:01:18,747
I will forget Prakash for good.

1662
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:21,028
Please, auntie...

1663
02:01:21,108 --> 02:01:23,516
don't decide anything
before meeting my family.

1664
02:01:23,596 --> 02:01:27,001
It is a matter of Kiran's and my
life. I will take you with me.

1665
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:29,290
- Please, come with me.
- Please come, mother.

1666
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:38,570
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing, child.

1667
02:01:39,725 --> 02:01:42,006
I was just thinking that Janaki's
going there is not good.

1668
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,250
Prakash and Kiran's stubbornness

1669
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:48,044
will ruin Janaki's old age. Do
this. Bring my umbrella and hat.

1670
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:50,034
Go fast.

1671
02:01:52,089 --> 02:01:54,810
- Did you get it clearly?
- Yes, sir. - Here.

1672
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:58,050
You will get what you ask
after the job's done.

1673
02:01:58,114 --> 02:02:00,890
This is a very simple task.
Will be done today.

1674
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:03,850
Good. That's what I want.

1675
02:02:04,914 --> 02:02:07,610
Brother, I've brought auntie
and Kiran with me.

1676
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:12,148
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

1677
02:02:12,228 --> 02:02:16,315
'Your son.'

1678
02:02:16,565 --> 02:02:21,050
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

1679
02:02:22,029 --> 02:02:24,852
'Your... your... your son.'

1680
02:02:24,932 --> 02:02:32,932
'Swings on the swing of my heart'

1681
02:02:34,332 --> 02:02:36,170
I am meeting you for
the first time today.

1682
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:39,890
But don't know why I feel as
if I've known you for years.

1683
02:02:40,504 --> 02:02:42,770
You both must have had some
relation in your past lives.

1684
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:48,530
Come; my mother is waiting
for you. Come.

1685
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:57,650
See, Kiran? Brother took auntie
with so much respect.

1686
02:03:03,546 --> 02:03:06,810
Mother, she is Kiran's mother.

1687
02:03:08,133 --> 02:03:11,570
- Greetings. Where is Kiran?
- Coming with Prakash.

1688
02:03:12,076 --> 02:03:16,690
Come, sister. Come. Sit down.

1689
02:03:22,143 --> 02:03:25,330
Mother! She is Kiran.

1690
02:03:34,715 --> 02:03:37,580
Dear, where did you find such
a good daughter in law for me?

1691
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,970
He didn't find her, mother.
He got her by good luck.

1692
02:03:42,589 --> 02:03:45,090
Child, what does your father do?

1693
02:03:45,336 --> 02:03:48,007
Mother, I've found out every thing
about their family from Prakash.

1694
02:03:48,249 --> 02:03:50,850
Their family is no less
in prestige than ours.

1695
02:03:51,272 --> 02:03:53,728
Then I don't need to ask any thing.

1696
02:03:54,012 --> 02:03:57,090
Sister, my Suraj is very mature.

1697
02:03:57,555 --> 02:03:59,970
He understands my feelings
even before I voice them.

1698
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:02,850
His father has handed
the business to him.

1699
02:04:03,982 --> 02:04:06,210
May God give a son like
him to everyone!

1700
02:04:07,774 --> 02:04:10,690
Strange, mother! You're
praising only brother.

1701
02:04:11,178 --> 02:04:12,930
Praise me sometimes.

1702
02:04:14,236 --> 02:04:16,810
Sister, he is very worthless.

1703
02:04:18,553 --> 02:04:21,090
Guys these days decide every
thing on themselves.

1704
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:24,010
We are just to fulfill the rituals.
So let's do it.

1705
02:04:24,966 --> 02:04:27,810
I've taken your daughter,
and given you my son.

1706
02:04:29,172 --> 02:04:33,170
You've honored me by
accepting my Kiran.

1707
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:38,920
Now sweeten everyone's
mouth quickly.

1708
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:42,250
We will do that, son. But
first call your uncle.

1709
02:04:42,435 --> 02:04:43,715
Let him see our daughter in law.

1710
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:45,930
- Meanwhile your father will also come.
- Ok.

1711
02:04:48,053 --> 02:04:50,930
Sister, relations are predestined.

1712
02:04:51,873 --> 02:04:54,130
My naive Suraj had chosen a girl...

1713
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:58,450
who was not appropriate
for our family.

1714
02:04:59,102 --> 02:05:02,450
Congratulations, sister!
Congratulations...

1715
02:05:12,089 --> 02:05:15,730
- Why are you looking that way?
- I am seeing God's miracle, sister.

1716
02:05:16,042 --> 02:05:19,090
She's become young again in
the form of her daughter.

1717
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:20,592
Do you know her?

1718
02:05:20,672 --> 02:05:25,010
Who doesn't know her, sis?
The whole city knows her.

1719
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:26,770
You know her, too.

1720
02:05:26,975 --> 02:05:32,010
She is the famous singer
of the city, Janakibai.

1721
02:05:35,744 --> 02:05:37,197
You're taken in by him, mother?

1722
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,420
You know uncle has the habit
of spreading poison.

1723
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:41,770
It is she who has come
to spread the poison.

1724
02:05:41,937 --> 02:05:44,010
I am just curing.

1725
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:49,011
Suraj, you had found out
about them, hadn't you?

1726
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:51,050
Uncle is mistaken, mother.

1727
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:54,570
They are poor, but they are
decent and good people.

1728
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:58,730
I will show you how decent they are.

1729
02:05:59,779 --> 02:06:01,656
Didn't you find anyone else except...

1730
02:06:01,863 --> 02:06:04,023
a prostitute's daughter to
make our daughter in law?

1731
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:08,490
No! For God's sake, don't
say such bad words to me.

1732
02:06:08,652 --> 02:06:12,410
Will you be able to hide your
reality by taking the help of God?

1733
02:06:12,578 --> 02:06:14,548
I will say it a thousand
times that...

1734
02:06:14,628 --> 02:06:17,290
Shut up! Or I will slap you.

1735
02:06:17,552 --> 02:06:22,010
Yes, your mother had punched
my heart; you can slap me.

1736
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:26,730
Uncle, if you will say even a word
about them, I won't spare you.

1737
02:06:26,927 --> 02:06:32,159
I knew, child, I had no status
to come to this house.

1738
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:35,370
But you both acted stubborn.

1739
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,210
I have done a mistake.

1740
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:41,850
I didn't know they would accuse
you so badly to refuse me.

1741
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:44,254
Come; let's go back.

1742
02:06:44,406 --> 02:06:48,570
Wait, Kiran. Prakash brought
you here on my instigation.

1743
02:06:48,827 --> 02:06:53,370
And I cannot tolerate your mother
being accused so badly.

1744
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:56,585
Uncle, you will have to prove
whatever you've said...

1745
02:06:56,665 --> 02:07:01,370
I will prove that. See this.
And this. And you see, too.

1746
02:07:02,453 --> 02:07:04,356
Ask your mother whether
she had come...

1747
02:07:04,436 --> 02:07:06,570
to sing on my Suraj's
naming ceremony or not?

1748
02:07:17,634 --> 02:07:20,490
Speak now, Janakibai.
Why are you silent?

1749
02:07:20,868 --> 02:07:23,130
Why are you hiding your face?

1750
02:07:26,377 --> 02:07:29,066
Now I get why you didn't
want to come here.

1751
02:07:29,498 --> 02:07:31,370
If you had told me earlier...

1752
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:33,050
why would I come here
to get insulted?

1753
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:37,330
- I would have drowned myself.
- Kiran! - Your Kiran is dead!

1754
02:07:38,173 --> 02:07:41,010
- Kiran, stop!
- Stop, Prakash.

1755
02:07:42,531 --> 02:07:44,261
You cannot stop me, brother.

1756
02:07:44,341 --> 02:07:46,571
Whoever or however she might be,
I will marry only her.

1757
02:07:46,735 --> 02:07:47,911
Keep quiet!

1758
02:07:47,991 --> 02:07:50,930
A daughter of a prostitute cannot
be our daughter in law.

1759
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:55,050
Brother, I will abandon
this world for Kiran.

1760
02:07:57,192 --> 02:07:58,790
Wait, Kiran!

1761
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:02,150
What happened, Prakash?
Why was Kiran crying?

1762
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:03,590
Parkar!

1763
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:05,470
What's happened to both of them?

1764
02:08:13,884 --> 02:08:15,110
Get out of here!

1765
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:17,310
- What are you doing?
- I am doing the right thing.

1766
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:20,390
- Let me go, Thakur.
- No, Janaki, you cannot go.

1767
02:08:20,558 --> 02:08:22,390
- Let her be thrown out...
- Shut up, Ratna.

1768
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:23,990
You don't know what you're saying.

1769
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:25,590
You don't know, father,
she had come...

1770
02:08:26,274 --> 02:08:28,274
to propose her daughter's
marriage with Prakash.

1771
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:31,104
She wanted to blot the family...

1772
02:08:31,374 --> 02:08:33,054
which has been spotless
for generations.

1773
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:36,150
- She's a prostitute...
- Idiot!

1774
02:08:36,597 --> 02:08:39,030
Who told you that she
is a prostitute?

1775
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:40,950
Sir Thakur!

1776
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:47,231
Forgive me, Janaki. It's the first
time I've beaten your son.

1777
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:48,653
I've done a mistake.

1778
02:08:49,107 --> 02:08:51,830
Her child? Suraj, her child?

1779
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:55,141
Yes, Ratna, Suraj is her
son and not yours.

1780
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:59,510
What? Suraj is not our child?
What are you saying?

1781
02:08:59,887 --> 02:09:02,070
That what I couldn't
say for 25 years.

1782
02:09:02,384 --> 02:09:04,428
Ratna, the one you're
calling a prostitute...

1783
02:09:04,508 --> 02:09:06,230
is as holy as the waters of Ganga.

1784
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:09,110
Thousands of decent women
can be sacrificed for her.

1785
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:12,672
She let go of her maternal love
and gave her child to you.

1786
02:09:12,831 --> 02:09:13,910
Because the child...

1787
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:16,790
you gave birth to 25 years
back was born dead.

1788
02:09:17,107 --> 02:09:18,390
What?

1789
02:09:18,594 --> 02:09:20,139
If you knew that as a result
to your prayers...

1790
02:09:20,163 --> 02:09:24,115
God had given you a dead child,
you would have died, Ratna.

1791
02:09:25,078 --> 02:09:28,350
This goddess not only gave you
her child, but also a new life.

1792
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:31,505
She is still silent after
such a bad insult...

1793
02:09:31,585 --> 02:09:33,830
because she had promised
that to keep silent.

1794
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:37,035
But what is surprising is that...

1795
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:39,870
why didn't her own
blood recognize her?

1796
02:09:39,950 --> 02:09:42,310
Wretched! Why didn't you
become dumb before...

1797
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:44,710
calling your own mother
a prostitute?

1798
02:09:45,932 --> 02:09:47,111
Come here, Janaki.

1799
02:09:47,511 --> 02:09:51,430
Ratna, ask her forgiveness right
now or I will never forgive you.

1800
02:09:51,998 --> 02:09:57,030
Sir, it's not madam's fault. She
knew nothing of this matter.

1801
02:09:57,619 --> 02:10:00,870
Do you hear this, Ratna?
This is called loyalty.

1802
02:10:01,392 --> 02:10:05,510
It was he who got the child from
her so that you might stay alive.

1803
02:10:05,834 --> 02:10:08,002
But you got provoked
by this low and...

1804
02:10:08,082 --> 02:10:11,510
worthless brother of yours and
called Munshiji a servant.

1805
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:13,990
You also ruined his daughter's life.

1806
02:10:14,150 --> 02:10:17,390
It is scoundrels like you who
ruin the life of decent girls.

1807
02:10:17,470 --> 02:10:20,390
Go away from here or I'll shoot you.

1808
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:22,950
Suraj, you also...

1809
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:27,488
Catch them! Take them from here.

1810
02:11:06,664 --> 02:11:08,718
- Hallo.
- Brother Suraj? - Yes, it's me.

1811
02:11:08,887 --> 02:11:11,021
Raja's men have caught
Prakash and Kiran.

1812
02:11:11,101 --> 02:11:13,097
- What?
- They've gone at the Ghost Bungalow.

1813
02:11:13,287 --> 02:11:15,832
- Their lives are in danger. Please, come soon.
- Okay.

1814
02:11:16,037 --> 02:11:18,447
Come soon. I'll meet you
outside the bungalow.

1815
02:11:25,215 --> 02:11:29,031
Let go of Kiran, Raja,
or I will kill you.

1816
02:11:29,111 --> 02:11:31,690
Kid, save your life first.

1817
02:11:31,866 --> 02:11:33,746
You cannot save yourself
from me, Kiran.

1818
02:11:34,361 --> 02:11:36,999
I will revenge for each
of my insults today.

1819
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:10,546
Parkar!

1820
02:12:14,036 --> 02:12:15,906
Scoundrel! I will break your head.

1821
02:13:00,997 --> 02:13:04,143
Let go of me! Leave, I said.

1822
02:13:47,626 --> 02:13:49,170
Leave me!

1823
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,246
What has happened, Suraj?

1824
02:15:36,241 --> 02:15:39,226
I got this moment after
so many years...

1825
02:15:39,787 --> 02:15:44,641
when I could call
my son as my son.

1826
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:50,641
Don't cry, mother. You
should be happy that...

1827
02:15:50,721 --> 02:15:55,226
your son killed a wicked
person to save his sister.

1828
02:15:56,317 --> 02:15:57,466
I have done no crime.

1829
02:15:57,658 --> 02:16:00,506
Brother, I am so unlucky.

1830
02:16:00,923 --> 02:16:05,746
I could not tie Rakhi on your
hands, but got handcuffs for you.

1831
02:16:06,021 --> 02:16:07,102
Your Honor...

1832
02:16:07,182 --> 02:16:10,466
the prosecution finishes its
procedure with this statement.

1833
02:16:10,546 --> 02:16:12,394
And requests the court
to sentence Suraj...

1834
02:16:12,474 --> 02:16:16,148
a deserving punishment
for killing Raja.

1835
02:16:16,228 --> 02:16:18,206
No, Lord, no!

1836
02:16:19,123 --> 02:16:23,085
I suffered all my life, but never
asked any thing from you.

1837
02:16:24,131 --> 02:16:27,506
Today I beg of you to
get my son released.

1838
02:16:28,837 --> 02:16:33,914
You will have to answer to an
aggrieved mother's prayers, God.

1839
02:16:34,154 --> 02:16:37,268
Taking all witnesses and
statements into account...

1840
02:16:37,348 --> 02:16:40,514
the court decides that murdered
Raja was a bad man.

1841
02:16:41,394 --> 02:16:43,714
He tried to rape the sister
of the accused.

1842
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:46,274
And so the accused tried
to save his sister.

1843
02:16:46,634 --> 02:16:49,154
In that fight, Raja lost his life.

1844
02:16:50,865 --> 02:16:52,834
This does not prove the
crime of the accused.

1845
02:16:54,584 --> 02:16:58,078
So this court releases
the accused man, Suraj.

1846
02:17:04,567 --> 02:17:05,307
Brother in law!

1847
02:17:05,388 --> 02:17:07,388
What's this? What is this
black thing on your face?

1848
02:17:07,504 --> 02:17:10,375
I've smeared my face...

1849
02:17:10,921 --> 02:17:12,721
with black color before
people would do it.

1850
02:17:13,205 --> 02:17:16,402
Till sister Janaki and Munshiji
don't forgive me...

1851
02:17:16,482 --> 02:17:18,248
my face will remain
black like this.

1852
02:17:19,111 --> 02:17:21,208
Sister Janaki, do you forgive me?

1853
02:17:22,077 --> 02:17:24,127
Thank you. Brother in law,
what about you?

1854
02:17:24,334 --> 02:17:25,527
Go and wash your face.

1855
02:17:27,888 --> 02:17:32,507
Now you guys forgive me, too.
Have you? Thank you. Thank you.
