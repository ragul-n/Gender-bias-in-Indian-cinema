00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,416
King Palace, Coimbatore

3
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,881
He's Raja Ravichandra Varma.

4
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:03,611
A good business man.

5
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:05,722
He believed in business
which not only earns profits

6
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,621
but also gives jobs
to the jobless.

7
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:11,261
His three sisters mean
everything to him.

8
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:14,864
And these three men are those
who married Raja's three sisters.

9
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,833
Raja loves his sisters whereas
these three men love Raja's wealth.

10
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,233
He is Raja's brother-in-law,
an absent minded man.

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,839
But he is a good man too.

12
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:27,308
After Raja's death, his children
became the point of attraction.

13
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:32,080
Bhagat Seth,
a criminal minded business man.

14
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,081
Earlier, he was a professional killer.

15
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,844
Now he is a business man.

16
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:37,479
You start.

17
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,351
No one has come from
King constructions.

18
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,187
After Raja's death, who's left
to represent the company.

19
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,066
Raja's elder son.

20
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,665
Has this kid entered the business?
- Yes sir.

21
00:01:58,043 --> 00:01:58,600
You can start.

22
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:00,210
Government's minimum bid
amount is Rs.10 lakhs.

23
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,572
Rs.10 lakhs & 10 thousand.

24
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:02,940
Rs.50 lakhs.

25
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:14,253
Bhagat construction bid
is Rs.2 crores 2 lakhs.

26
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:17,556
One moment King.

27
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,461
Business is not a ball game.

28
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,126
But for me, it is just a game.

29
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:25,392
Didn't get me?

30
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,697
This spinning mill which isn't
worth even Rs.50 lakhs,

31
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:31,069
l provoked you & made you
to bid for Rs.2 crores.

32
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,177
And l made workers to earn
a profit Rs.1 .5 crores.

33
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,404
A real King not only wins

34
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,979
but also one who
makes people win.

35
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,491
l won.

36
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:54,097
Well done.

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,133
Why do you congratulate your elder son
when the younger one had won it?

38
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:59,497
He lost to make him win.

39
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,165
A real King not only wins

40
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,398
but also one who
makes people win.

41
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,142
Have you lost the suitcases?
Tell me.

42
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,372
Please stop it.

43
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:11,514
Tell me where have you
hidden the suitcases?

44
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,513
Why are you beating him?

45
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:13,844
l should kill him.

46
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:18,581
Your brother trusted him so much
but he is trying to cheat us.

47
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,519
What did he do?

48
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:21,056
Tomorrow is Raja's birth anniversary.

49
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,820
He says that the money brought in boxes
to be given as bonus to the workers

50
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,587
have gone missing.

51
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:26,526
Don't get angry.

52
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:27,198
lf police interrogate...

53
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,263
Stop it, uncle.

54
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,570
Sir, l'm innocent.

55
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,999
Just leave this place.

56
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,299
Do you also suspect me?

57
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,873
l said leave this place.

58
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,870
Just leave this place l say.

59
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,979
When he mentioned about the police,
l really got scared.

60
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,657
l got much more scared.
Where did you keep the suitcases?

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,122
Don't worry.
They are safe in my room.

62
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:58,021
Did we steal it to be
hidden in your room?

63
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,460
Go, get it.
- l will.

64
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,006
l know about you all and
Ranga Rao's honest nature.

65
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,573
l kept my mouth shut
because of my sisters.

66
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:14,075
You don't have to worry about
any affairs of the palace.

67
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,908
Come with me & seek
forgiveness from Ranga Rao.

68
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:22,645
After his father's death, we thought
we could gain control of the wealth,

69
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,948
but he's an hurdle everything.

70
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:27,751
What do we do when someone
becomes a hurdle in our path?

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,688
We take another path.

72
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,657
You guys do that.

73
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:31,659
What about you?

74
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,593
We remove it from our path.

75
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:44,599
Team Tolly

76
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:46,200
Mother...

77
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,243
After my elder son's birth,

78
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:52,440
something inauspicious
happens every 3 years.

79
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:55,415
l called you here to
show his horoscope.

80
00:04:55,621 --> 00:05:00,957
This boy will lead a royal life
and will face some hurdles too.

81
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:06,187
ln the 2008, a danger awaits him.

82
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,628
Very dangerous.

83
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:12,395
lf he escapes from that,
he will live long.

84
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,700
What should we do as a remedy
to avoid that danger?

85
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:22,541
As humans, let's do all that we can.

86
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,350
2008, March 26

87
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,351
Move...

88
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,425
How did it happen?

89
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,664
The contract will be ours for sure.

90
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:50,569
Don't under estimate the King.

91
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:53,574
What will he do?
l've bribed everyone.

92
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:55,805
lt's Murthy...

93
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,182
Yes Murthy, tell me.

94
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,577
Sorry sir. A bad news.

95
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,510
King has won again.

96
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,283
What happened?

97
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:11,259
King has won again!

98
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:16,095
l'll even kill the King to win this time.

99
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,540
lt's wrong.

100
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,212
As his bodyguard,
you failed to save him.

101
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,041
You've no right to live.

102
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:36,884
My son, you wanted King to die
until your death.

103
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,388
Notjust the King,
l'll wipe out his entire clan.

104
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,620
Hello brother...

105
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:45,827
Only if you come to the airport
and give me a send off,

106
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,521
l'll board the flight to London.

107
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,064
lf you don't come, you know
about me, don't you?

108
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,627
l'll come back.

109
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:01,810
My name is Kittu, Coal Kittu.

110
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,974
This is my business.

111
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:09,415
And my side business
is to kill for money.

112
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:13,489
Now l took money to kill you.

113
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:14,784
Are you scared?

114
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:18,292
Notjust me, no one in
my family ever gets scared.

115
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:19,555
Do you know why?

116
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,765
Everyone believes in God,
who is unseen.

117
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,095
We believe in God we see.

118
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:26,396
God you see?

119
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,095
Who are you?
- King!

120
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,242
Let me see how King saves you now.

121
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:32,501
Kill him.

122
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:45,780
Team Tolly

123
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,379
Who are you?
- King

124
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:13,812
The way he spoke about you
made me anxious to see you.

125
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,112
Electricity gives light.

126
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,812
lf you try to touch it,
you will die.

127
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,492
You dared to warn me in my den,

128
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:24,457
do you know my gift to you for it?

129
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,654
Your brother's death as you watch.

130
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:30,665
lf anyone of you dare touch my brother,
l'll leave this place right away.

131
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:31,836
Try if you can.

132
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,252
Get up.

133
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,417
Get up.

134
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:56,917
Take this.

135
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:57,917
Touch him.

136
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,417
Touch him l say.

137
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,198
Who gave you money?

138
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,013
King knows to protect his people

139
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,376
and also knows how to
control men like you.

140
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,179
l'm not here to tell you
not to lock horns with me.

141
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,481
Lock horns with me
but not with my people.

142
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,626
lf you again think
about my people,

143
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,590
l'll be forced to think about you.

144
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:39,488
You can't stand before me.

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,673
Why are you so dull?

146
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,775
ls it because my brother
has gone to London?

147
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:52,807
No.

148
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,672
She doesn't want you to leave.

149
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,847
Yes.

150
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:59,342
The priest had predicted this year
is not good for you.

151
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,519
You don't have to travel now.

152
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,711
Munna called me just now, mother.

153
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:04,911
There's a small problem
in our factory.

154
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,147
l've to go there to solve it.

155
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,950
l'll be back in 2 days.

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,958
After our brother's death,
you're our only hope.

157
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:14,064
Nothing will happen to me when
l'm protected by your love.

158
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,233
Actually...

159
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,629
Gopi said that you're leaving.

160
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:22,204
Your aunt wants a golden girdle.

161
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,965
Gold prices have come
down by Rs.1000.

162
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:25,404
lf you give me Rs.5 lakhs...

163
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,703
You'll bet on Pakistan and
Australian cricket teams.

164
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:29,107
l've quit betting.

165
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,474
Tell him.

166
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:33,116
You don't trust lndia.
l don't trust you.

167
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,081
He hates lies.

168
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,051
Ask him money point blank.
He won't deny us, will he?

169
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,019
l won't.
l know about you all.

170
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,317
l spared you all because
of my aunts.

171
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,322
Go & do your work.

172
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,792
When he has made it so clear,
why stand here like dogs?

173
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,158
Let's go.
- Finish off all your work & come back.

174
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,458
Do you need a girdle?

175
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,762
lf l need anything
l would ask you not him.

176
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:55,166
He is lying.
Well said.

177
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:58,933
Hope you have not forgotten anything?

178
00:11:59,144 --> 00:11:59,803
You forgot.

179
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,205
Forgot what?

180
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,675
Forgot to wear your pant.

181
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,313
Sorry. l forgot to wear
my pant in hurry.

182
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,615
Anything message to your mother?
- Will you forget?

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,878
Why would l?

184
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,783
Tell my mother that
l'll come back safe & sound.

185
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,184
Okay.

186
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:20,390
He told me to tell his mother that
he will backsafe & sound.

187
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,361
Hubby...

188
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,965
Why did you shriek now?
- You didn't wear you pant.

189
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,262
Yes.

190
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,631
What did he say?
- How will l know?

191
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,034
Yes, you're right.

192
00:12:30,242 --> 00:12:31,004
What did he say?

193
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,574
He said something.

194
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,940
King has tightened the grip.

195
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:40,982
Das from whom we borrowed money
is threatening us if we don't repay.

196
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,448
What should we do now?

197
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:44,819
This phone keeps on ringing.

198
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:45,819
lt's Das.

199
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,286
He will live for 100 years.

200
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,390
Yes, he will live for 100 years.

201
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,493
lf you don't pay the loan,
this is your last year.

202
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,128
Stop scaring me.

203
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,895
lt's betting Shafi.

204
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:57,000
Shafi, l'll bet on Australia this time too.

205
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,693
Won't you answer my call,
you scoundrel?

206
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,432
Mr.Das, is it you?
How did you call from this number?

207
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:04,734
l'm in Delhi.

208
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,638
l thought of meeting you
in person once l reach there.

209
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:07,368
So, l cut the call.

210
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,140
Agra Peda is special sweet here,
can l get it for you?

211
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:16,245
lf you were in Delhi,
how did you hear the gun sound?

212
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,251
Where are you, Mr.Das?

213
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,254
Wherever l may be,
you're at my gun point.

214
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,484
What would you get if you kill me?

215
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,356
Give me some time.
l've made a foolproof sketch.

216
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:28,589
lf you miss, l won't shoot
the bulb this time.

217
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,427
lt'll be your brain.

218
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,502
What do you mean by foolproof sketch?

219
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:35,404
l won't tell you.

220
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,207
l'll put it in action.

221
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:40,606
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.

222
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:43,042
l'm hearing this from
the day l got married.

223
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:44,545
Will he finish the job?

224
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,444
lf not him...

225
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:47,750
Will you finish the job?

226
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,648
Have you made any master plan?

227
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:52,448
Date: March 26
Location:Dehardun Airport, Uttaranchal

228
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,522
This phone is disturbing me.

229
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:01,926
The flight landed just now.

230
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,191
You're new to the job.

231
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,197
Handle with care.

232
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:05,130
He's very smart.

233
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:06,770
Don't make me tensed.

234
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,200
l'll handle the situation.

235
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:32,857
What's the problem?

236
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:36,693
Local mafia threatened the workers
and are stopping from working.

237
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:40,064
They want to takeover the factory.

238
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:43,672
You don't need to run this
factory fighting those men.

239
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,901
We feel it's better to
shutdown the factory.

240
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:49,808
When 3000 families are affected
because of a few men,

241
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,451
we need to finish them off instead
of shutting down the factory.

242
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,655
They are very dangerous.

243
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:01,587
A soldier can fear war
but not a King.

244
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:27,241
Team Tolly

245
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,333

His shoe sound is shaking...

His speed is breath taking...

248
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:02,844
He knocks down men
with his powerful fists...

249
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:05,215
His enemies get shivers...

250
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,358
His punches are like
bursting crackers...

251
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,955
Even guns take a step back
on seeing him...

252
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:19,865
He comes like a cyclone
and breaks all records...

253
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:28,611
King is coming...

254
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:33,216
A king with brawn and
with a kind heart...

255
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:42,325
Even silence blows whistles
at the one & only King...

256
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:53,327
Team Tolly

257
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,673
When he enters the battlefield,
he over runs everyone...

258
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:37,610
When he tightens his fists,
he strikes hard...

259
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,885
He is a walking army...

260
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,420
Everything is a cakewalk to him...

261
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:51,459
When he starts to hunt the beasts,
there's no stepping back...

262
00:17:55,833 --> 00:18:00,167
He even electrifies
the electricity...

263
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:05,070
He is known for his adventures...
He is too hot...

264
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:16,410
Team Tolly

265
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:08,805
His eyes are like a cheetah,
always stalking...

266
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:13,808
When injustice is done,
he attacks ferociously...

267
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:22,485
He leads from the front, our king...

268
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:27,488
He caretakes everyone
single handedly...

269
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:36,196
Solves any problems he faces...

270
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:41,236
When such a hero is with people,
they all like him...

275
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:18,933
Graveyard...?

276
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:23,957
A day after King's death,
Victoria Hospital

277
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,228
You had lodged a complaint
about a missing man, right?

278
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:27,165
Yes sir.

279
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:31,571
Try to identify him.

280
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,776

00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,244

ls he the one?

284
00:22:58,936 --> 00:22:59,732
What?

285
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:01,029
Has he gone missing?

286
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,137
l searched everywhere.

287
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,205
l've lodged a complaint
in all police stations.

288
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,307
But no information about him.

289
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:10,440
How will you get information?

290
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:12,848
What do you mean?

291
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:16,812
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.

292
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:20,891
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.

293
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,957
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.

294
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,619
He is finished.

295
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,162
What is all this?

296
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,355
An evidence to your plot.

297
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,056
lnspector...

298
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,292
DCP!

299
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,331
Put him in jail and give
him a police treatment.

300
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,632
Truth will come out.

301
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:39,571
Mr. Appaji, you've to come to
the police station with us.

302
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:40,471
l will come.

303

l'll show you all.

305
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:44,546
Move.

306
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,182
He may really bring.

307
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:53,748
He has escaped.

308
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,892
How far can he run with
his big tummy?

309
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,458
Search. You'll find him.

310
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,034
l now understood the meaning
of your cunning smile.

311
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,828
You finished the King there

312
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,941
and trapped Appaji here.
Moreover a cunning smile too.

313
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:17,203
Let's ask your younger son
to come back.

314
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:18,676
No.

315
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,280
He can't tolerate it.

316
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:23,009
My son will be fine.

317
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,350
You don't have to worry.

318
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:31,220
l gave them hope.
But you are my hope.

319
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:35,890
Make sure my son is

320
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:37,562
Safe...?

321
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:39,735
Safe...?

322
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:46,073
Sister, your son told me that
he will come home safe

323
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,574

Greetings sir.

Why have you come back again?

329
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,118
Didn't l tell you that l'll not vacate?

330
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,445
Your lease period is over.

331
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,451
He has to perform his
daughter's marriage.

332
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,455
lf you vacate this bar,

333
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:35,726
he will sell this bar and
perform his daughter's marriage.

334
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:38,053
Who are you to say that?
- Bottu Seenu's man.

335
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:44,398
Who the hell is Bottu Seenu?
Get out. Get out.

336
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,730
Who are you?

337
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,294
East side, Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,

00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:30,666
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,

339
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,333
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?

340
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:35,307
What Bottu Seenu?

341
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:36,912
Do you know Charminar?
- Yes.

342
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,081
Golconda...?
- Yes.

343
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,249
Birla Mandir...?

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,077
Don't you know Bottu Seenu?

00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,087
Do you have any doubt?

348
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,926
lt's reeling.

349
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,325
l'm Bottu Seenu.

350
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,601
lf someone asks me who l am,
they will regret for asking so.

351
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:05,269
This building owner made a deal
with me to vacate this place.

352
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,871
lf you don't vacate he'll feel bad.

353
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,705
lf he feels bad, l'll get hurt.

354
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:12,041
What if you get hurt?

355
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:21,285
This will be the result.
Just vacate this place.

356
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,289
What's going on?

357
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:24,961
Look, he is hitting me badly.

358
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,288
l told you to vacate it.

359
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,964
How dare you say that
infront of the police?

360
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:29,232
l'll gun you down.

361
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,144
l'm sorry. Leave me.
- Go.

362
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,981
Let's go, boys.
Let's go.

363
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:56,149
Don't get scared.
lt was a drama.- Drama?

364
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,487
Everything was dummy.
- You're really great.

365
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,994
Enough of praising him.
Get me the money.

366
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:02,432
Rs.10000.

367
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:03,327
Rs.10000?

368
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,499
lt'll not even cover costumes & drinks.
- Give me more.

369
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:09,337
Don't be so money minded.
We helped in his daughter's marriage.

370
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,668
lf you hadn't done thatjob for free,
we all would've gone to touch.

371
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,242
Touch...?
- l mean Pub.

372
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,107
Pub is full of girls.
Drink & enjoy.

373
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:20,181
You forgot about my marriage
but want to enjoy in pub?

374
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,079
l'm trying my best.

375
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:22,775
ls it to ruin my marriage?

376
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:24,682
The profession we are in,

377
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,015
no one is coming forward
to give his daughter to you.

378
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,192
We can't change our profession.
But we can change our looks & styles.

379
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,521
There's a right time for everything.
- lt has started raining.

380
00:30:03,494 --> 00:30:06,327
Shravani, don't get wet in rain.
Come here.

381
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,567
Don't drag us out.

382
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:29,482
What happened?

383
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,377
l saw a girl in the rain.
l've gone mad.

384
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:32,753
Girl...? Where?

385
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:33,887
She went in the bus.

386
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,657
Let her go.
lf not her someone else.

387
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,157
l've decided, l want that girl.

388
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,421
lt's okay that you've decided.
Where can we find her?

389
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,923
lf Bottu Seenu decides, it's done.

390
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,441
Now take a look.

391
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:06,788
How is it?

392
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,288
l don't know what it is!

393
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,184
What?

394
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:10,519
lt's really wonderful.
lt looks like a real dog.

395
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:13,457
When l paint a dog,
it will look like a dog.

396
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,292
Will it look like you?
Show that to the dog?

397
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,192
lt'll feel happy.

398
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,135
How is your painting?

399
00:31:27,411 --> 00:31:29,641
You kept on moving.
Else it would've been better.

400
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,305
Master will be stunned to see this.
- Yes boss.

401
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,149
Why is it barking?

402
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,083
lt must be thinking that
another dog has come here.

403
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,984
Boss...stop it.

404
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,093
Khairtabad is going out of our hands.

405
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,997
You tell me.
How is the painting?

406
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,733
You tell me.
- Making fun of me? lt's a dog.

407
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:54,998
You call this a dog?

408
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,231
You scribbles some lines and
these fellows praise you.

409
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:01,502
Why should we try something
that we don't know?

410
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,170
To hell with painting of a dog, a fox!
Let's talk about Khairtabad.

411
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,512
l liked it.

412
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,694
lnsulting art?
l will crush your neck.

413
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,863
Forgive me, boss. Leave me.
l might die.

414
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:23,522
l spared you because you were
with me from childhood.

415
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:27,033
What's your problem?

416
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:31,865
Someone named Bottu Seenu
is into running kangaroo courts.

417
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,703
lf this goes on,
what will happen to our reputation?

418
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:38,541
How dare he runs kangaroo court
in my area?

419
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:39,875
Where can l find him?

420
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:44,484
Boss, you be here.
l will take care of him.

421
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:47,816
Who is Bottu Seenu here?

422
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,721
How dare you run kangaroo court
in our area?

423
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,396
l'll chop you into pieces.

424
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:11,871
Team Tolly

425
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:28,087
l heard that you run kangaroo courts.
Khairtabad is mine.

426
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,926
ls Nizam area your
grand mother's property?

427
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,766
Hello boss Gyan. You?

428
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,269
Narasimha..?
- Yes. He is my son.

429
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,107
Let's go inside & talk.

430
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,281
The twin cities must do what l say.

431
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,145
l threaten them and
l get protection money.

432
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,981
How could you dare step
into my business?

433
00:33:52,556 --> 00:33:53,955
lt means competition.

434
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,957
Just by hitting a few people
doesn't mean you're a big shot.

435
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,290
l've come across many guys like you.

436
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,465
Police wet their pants on seeing me.

437
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,727
Our boxer Ashok is being beaten
to pulp at SR Nagar police station.

438
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,302
Tell my name.

439
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,632
They are beating him badly
after telling your name.

440
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:12,200
Our boss will talk later.

441
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:13,800
What about you?

442
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:17,204
lf you do business here,
should l open a bangle shop for a living?

443
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,143
You do it knowingly or unknowingly.

444
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,374
lf you wish to be a goon,
work for me.

445
00:34:21,585 --> 00:34:22,984
l won't work for anyone.

446
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:24,484
What is he saying?

447
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,815
He is very arrogant.
He listens to no one.

448
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:30,323
l've dealt with many
such arrogant people.

449
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:35,321
You're Narasimha's son,
take Khairtabad & 100/0 commission.

450
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,159
Have l come top you or
you've come to me?

451
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,834
l came to your place.

452
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,163
Then the choice is mine.
- Yours?

453
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,668
You take that 100/0.

454
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,339
How dare he talks to me like that?

455
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,170
He is very arrogant.
Never listens to anyone.

456
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:53,179
What a son you've, Narasimha!
l'm quiet because of you.

457
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,510
As you say. But to the outside world,
be it the other way round.

458
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,185
Why?

459
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,014
They don't know about
our relationship.

460
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,851
They might feel that
l'm afraid of you. Tell him.

461
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,526
Yes.
- Okay.

462
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:06,019
Yadi, bring that here.

463
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,195
This is what l gave you, right?

464
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:14,196
l have brought you a gift.
- What gift?

465
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,865
Open it. You will know.

466
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,545
What is this?
- A painting.

467
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,872
You call this a painting?

468
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,379
lt's like a drunkard scribbling.

469
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,709
Who painted this?

470
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,720
l've never come across
a worst painting than this.

471
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,889
What are you doing?
My boss painted it.

472
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,389
Shut up. Take his comments positively.

473
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,719
Narasimha...
- Yes

474
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,725
Our building in Khairtabad
is really good.

475
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,899
You can shift there.
You too boys.

476
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,069
What shift?
That place is full of pigs & rats.

477
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,898
lf we clean it,
it will look wonderful.

478
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,740
Bye Narasimha.
- Bye.

479
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,068
Bye Seenu. Take care.

480
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,902
Bottu Narasimha fell on my feet
and embarrassed me.

481
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,749
l pitied him, told him to handle Khairtabad
and take 100/0 commission.

482
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,918
Why 100/0 commission?

483
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,746
He needs something to survive, right?

484
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,821
He does the crime and
we get the commission.

485
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:09,925
Did he agree for 100/0?
- Good question.

486
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,424
l've settle your account.

487
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,426
When l was threatening them,

488
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:19,693
you came & said our boys were being
beaten to pulp in SR police station.

489
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:21,928
l beg you. Don't beat me.

490
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:22,867
l won't beat you.
- Thank you.

491
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:24,438
l will break your bones.

492
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:27,000
You said there are pigs
in that building.

493
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,768
You must clean the entire building.

494
00:36:31,348 --> 00:36:34,442
From now, my boss has given powers
to Seenu to take care of Khairtabad.

495
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,175
He didn't give power.
We took it from him.

496
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,351
He is Mental Rajesh.
- Greetings.

497
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,124
He committed many crimes from
childhood, made a lot of money.

498
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,725
He set up a wine shop there.

499
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,459
The problems start there.

500
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:50,292
Women stage protests since their
husbands don't give them money.

501
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,967
ls he a fool to have invested
so much money in it?

502
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,960
Apart from your childhood crimes,
you have set up a wine shop.

503
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:56,967
lt's him not me.

504
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:01,474
You take their hard earned money
before it reaches their families.

505
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:07,981
You take their lives selling illicit liquor.
- Where are they?

506
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:10,377
Tell me.

507
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,319
lf you listen his story, you roll
on the ground & cry.- Really?

508
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,550
His father-in-law promised to give
him Rs.2 lakhs before marriage.

509
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,886
He gave him Rs.1 lakh only.
And is refusing to pay balance Rs.1 lakh.

510
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:24,089
He got angry & beat his wife and
smashed his wife's head to the wall.

511
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:27,599
Her father wants to file a case
against him. lt's injustice.

512
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,171
Do you need dowry for your dirty face?
- He married her not me.

513
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:36,836
Are you trying to ruin her life?
Where are they?

514
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,173
They are gone.

515
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:39,508
Do you have only such cases with you?

516
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,847
Only such things come up for settlement.

517
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,520
Settlement is not for us
to get settled in life.

518
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:49,450
lf you bring such stupid cases to me,
l'll kick your ass.

519
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,363
Why is everyone so tensed?
- Sir is coming.

520
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,365
The entire city is scared of our boss.
But our boss is scared of Sir.

521
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:19,889
ls our boss scared of him?
- Shut up.

522
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,557
Our boss fell in love
with his sister.

523
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:25,554
She said her's is a family of artists.
And his' family of killers.

524
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:30,062
She put a condition that only if he
learns to paint & satisfies her brother,

525
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,063
she'll agree to marry him.

526
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:36,172
Have you finished your home work?
- You have to see it.

527
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:39,236
l spent all night to paint this.

528
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:45,246
You spoke like a great artist.
What is this?

529
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,848
Merciful sky.

530
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,078
Caption of the painting.

531
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,351
The boy in the painting
is an orphan.

532
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:59,259
He has no food or water.
Not even clothes to wear.

533
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,757
lt's alright. Doesn't he have ears?
- He is deaf.

534
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,595
Won't the deaf have ears?

535
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,099
l can't convey in the painting
that he is deaf.

536
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,100
So, l removed his ears.

537
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,432
So, since you've no brains,
can l remove your head?

538
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,100
Go ahead.

539
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,943
When he feels hungry,
he looks down.

540
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:17,270
When he feels thirsty,
he looks at the sky.

541
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:19,208
Finally, the sky feels pity on him.

542
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,611
lt releases 3 drops of water.

543
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,184
Your creation has lot of shit in it.

544
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:26,446
lt's not enough if you alone
understand that shit.

545
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,953
The one who looks at it
must also understand.

546
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,284
lt's very clear in the painting.

547
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,790
What's clear?
- Boss...

548
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,792
What? Why are you disturbing us?
- lmportant matter, sir.

549
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,464
This is even more important.

550
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,293
You illiterate!
You say that this is very clear, right?

551
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,470
Yes master. lt's crystal clear.

552
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,037
Tell me the concept of this painting.
Tell me.

553
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:50,302
This boy came here to shit.
Forgot to bring water mug.

554
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:55,483
He's looking at those leaves
to wipe his shit.- That's all.

555
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,147
Don't feel bad.

556
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,984
You too have some shitty
thoughts in your brain.

557
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:05,720
When they come out,
they turn even worse.

558
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,489
What can l do?

559
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:10,664
When l paint, my hands shake.
- Stop drinking.

560
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,994
How is drinking related to painting?

561
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,502
Your hands will stop shaking
and you can paint well.

562
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,333
Try again.
Will see you tomorrow.

563
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:23,506
What did you say?

564
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:27,514
ls he waiting to wipe the shit
with those leaves?

565
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,684
l'm sorry, boss.

566
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,021
Tell me what's in your heart.
l'll tell him exactly as you say.

567
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:37,023
ls he a fool to ask you again?
- Leave it.

568
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:41,024
Bottu Seenu is spoiling
all our business.

569
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,699
He is conquering Khairtabad.
He is taking huge sums of money.

570
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,527
He is troubling us.

571
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,533
People trust banks & deposit
their money in banks.

572
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,037
lf people use credit cards & refuse to pay,
banks will be forced to shutdown.

573
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,210
lnnocent people will the final losers.

574
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:58,472
ln Khairtabad alone, more than
Rs.15 crores is due for our bank.

575
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:00,809
lf you recover that money,
l will give you 100/0.

576
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:03,383
More than the commission,
l like yourjob. Deal okay.

577
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,215
We will be on it from tomorrow.

578
00:41:13,697 --> 00:41:17,064
He gave me a wrong information
that you're spoiling the business.

579
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:20,226
l like your style of business.
Very happy.

580
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,905
There should be honesty
in the business l do.

581
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,074
My boss wants money notjustice.

582
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,078
lf we do wrong things for
the sake of money,

583
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,076
the affected people will
be angry with your boss.

584
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,407
That's dangerous for you.

585
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,744
lf we deal such cases,
we get money & a good image.

586
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,249
What do you say?
- Nothing to say.

587
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:41,350
We'll never interfere in your business.
Do business in your style.

588
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:42,820
Bye Narasimha.
- Bye sir.

589
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,091
Let's go.
You convey everything wrong.

590
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,032
There, you insulted me
in front of my master.

591
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:54,765
And here, you say that
l'm very greedy.

592
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:55,995
What shall we do with him?

593
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:58,436
l beg you. Treat me as
your brother. Leave me.

594
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:02,100
l won't leave you.
l will finish you off.

595
00:42:03,013 --> 00:42:06,210
Vehicle is very good.
- New model, boss.

596
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,950
Boys, have you understood?
The dealing must be very smooth.- Okay boss.

597
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:21,528
Don't say boss. Say okay bro.
Bro means brother, corporate style.

598
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,065
Who are you?

599
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,137
l'm coming from the bank.
- Have you brought it?

600
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,806
What?

601
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,975
l applied for the credit card.
Have you brought it?

602
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,145
l'm here to take not to give.
- Take what?

603
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,973
Credit card bill.
- Bill.

604
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:40,478
There is no outgoing
only incoming here.

605
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:42,311
Which means that l only take money.
l never give money.

606
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,646
l may have to take
legal action against you.

607
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,151
Legal action?

608
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,052
l'll complain to TV9 that you
brought goons to my house.

609
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:52,393
l'll lodge complaint in police station
that you misbehaved with women.

610
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,764
When a lender is so smart,
how smart a defaulter like would be?

611
00:42:58,702 --> 00:42:59,669
Do you need a credit card?

612
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,997
Yes. l need one.
My repayment record is very clean.

613
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:04,500
l do prompt payment.

614
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,505
You come here fast.
l am waiting for you.

615
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,337
Why are you taking my belongings?

616
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,172
Why are you taking my car?

617
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,608
Why are you hitting me?

618
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:14,010
First, l'll deal very smoothly
in a corporate style.

619
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,344
lf it doesn't work, Bottu Seenu will be out.
- Who is Bottu Seenu?

620
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:20,683
lf Bottu Seenu hits you,
your head will reel.- How?

621
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,693
How was it?

622
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,361
l feel the reeling.
You must be Bottu Seenu.- Got it?

623
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,031
Pay money & take your belongings.
Load everything.

624
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,529
l think l spoke a lot.

625
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:43,936
Team Tolly

626
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,543
Which floor is he in?
- 3rd floor.

627
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,217
Can't you see?
- My girl friend.

628
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,616
Girl friend for you?

629
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:57,384
Give me your goggles.
lt'll be nice on you. Get lost.

630
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:01,058
What's this noise?
- Today is Valentine's day.

631
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,562
Today, if girls accept flowers from boys,
it means she has accepted his love.

632
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,394
l don't believe all these.

633
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,968
These stuff is for those with
lot of money. Let's go.

634
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:11,402
Among the shoppers who did
shopping in our mall today,

635
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:15,806
first prize winner is token no. 153.

636
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,316
What are you looking at, boss?

637
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,646
The girl l saw in the bus stop.

638
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,258
Your name?
- Shravani.

639
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,926
Sister-in-law's name is Shravani.

640
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,424
Nice name, right?
- Yes boss.

641
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,598
What will you do with this Rs.25000?

642
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:40,660
l request you to donate it to any
orphanage on my behalf.- Wow!

643
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:42,762
She is too good.

644
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,770
On this valentine's day, you're giving
this money to an orphanage.

645
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,442
What are you going to give
to your boy friend?

646
00:44:47,877 --> 00:44:49,777
Sorry, l've no boy friend.

647
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,281
Boss...
- She has no boy friend.

648
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,780
Can you tell us the kind of
a man you're looking for?

649
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,787
He must be kind hearted.

650
00:44:58,988 --> 00:44:59,454
lt's okay.

651
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:05,286
Must be a follower of Gandhi.
- Boss.

652
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,122
Should make his dreams come true.

653
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,456
None of her expectations matches your.
- Forget about her.

654
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,968
She caught your balloon.

655
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:25,414
She holds your flower which means
your love will be a success.

656
00:45:25,615 --> 00:45:27,139
Shut up. He never believes
in all that stuff.

657
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,984
Now l do.
- Boss, she is leaving.

658
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:35,257
We thank you all for making
this program a grand success.

659
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,251
We missed her again.

660
00:45:39,796 --> 00:45:42,264
l didn't miss her.
She is in my heart.

661
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:59,238
Team Tolly

662
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:09,986
l searched all over AP...

663
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,488
l explored both Hollywood
and Bollywood...

664
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:16,832
l fell for an angel like you...

665
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:24,098
You're my sweetheart...

666
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:27,674
l'm looking for a boy friend
like Brad Pitt...

667
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:31,005
l need a man like Jet Li...

668
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:34,342
lf you prove that you're a man
with both qualities...

669
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:42,013
you'll be my Emperor...

670
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:49,028
O beauty! You're my love...
l'm mad at you...

671
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:56,138
To be my hero,
my heart should believe in you...

672
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:11,777
Team Tolly

673
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,661
We are a perfect match...

674
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,169
Like Amitabh & Jaya,
a made for each other couple...

675
00:47:31,374 --> 00:47:34,571
We are a perfect match
like Rajesh & Dimple...

676
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:38,076
lf you say Yes,
let's get married like Abhi & Ash...

677
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:41,739
The man who Jaya loves
was No: 1 ...

678
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:45,250
The man Dimple fell for was
a romantic hero...

679
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:48,419
Ash liked the qualities of Bachchan...

680
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:52,424
Do something to prove yourself
as someone special...

681
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:59,431
O my dear Trisha!
l'm a slave of your beauty...

682
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:06,268
Love is an intoxication...
One should be mad like you...

683
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:29,888
Team Tolly

684
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:48,144
Like Ambani,
l'll build a palace for you...

685
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:51,752
Like Shahjahan,
l'll gift you the Rose Mahal as a bonus.

686
00:48:51,954 --> 00:48:55,151
Like ANR, l'll build
a studio in your name...

687
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,816
lf you love me,
l'll make you the next CM...

688
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:02,327
Wearing a buttonless shirt,
you look like mass hero...

689
00:49:02,532 --> 00:49:05,831
On looking at your kind heart,
you proved to be a man of class...

690
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:09,163
Like Majnu,
you cast a spell on me...

691
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:12,830
You made my heart beat
to your tunes...

692
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:16,508
Darling, you're my dawn...

693
00:49:16,712 --> 00:49:20,170
what you said is the
sweetest thing of all...

694
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:27,255
O my darling! O handsome!
l like you...

695
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:06,284
Take rest for a few minutes.
We will get ready.

696
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:10,327
Hello...Record it.
- Okay.

697
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,237
How is it?
- As it is.

698
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:21,404
l mean to say that this is the
song we heard in our car.

699
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,579
lf we give the CD, our boys will
compose the tunes.- Shut up.

700
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:26,073
The tempo is different.
The tune is different.

701
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:27,078
The language is...

702
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:28,580
lt was in Hindi.
This is Telugu.

703
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:30,252
Greetings sir.

704
00:50:31,454 --> 00:50:33,081
Shravani, he is Jayasurya.

705
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,281
Greetings sir.

706
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:42,262
Ask that girl in blue dress
to come in.

707
00:50:42,532 --> 00:50:43,157
Let's give her a break.

708
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:48,099
Greetings sir.
- Sit down.

709
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:50,271
Your name?
- Shravani.

710
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:52,599
There is music in your name.

711
00:50:54,810 --> 00:51:00,180
See Shravani, to be frank,
l know nothing about music.

712
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:03,284
How is that possible?

713
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:04,953
By stealing other composers' tunes.

714
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:06,219
l heard it.

715
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:11,020
To come up in the industry,
all you need is a relationship.

716
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,955
Especially, the relationship
between a singer & musician

717
00:51:14,497 --> 00:51:15,725
must be like that of
a husband & wife.

718
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:17,298
You...

719
00:51:19,168 --> 00:51:21,295
l mean to say that we should've
a good understanding.

720
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:25,474
Let's forget about music
and stuff like that.

721
00:51:25,675 --> 00:51:26,699
Let's talk about life.

722
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,471
Book a guest house in the evening.

723
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,075
Send our car to her house.
She will come.- Okay sir.

724
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:32,975
Understood?

725
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:36,313
l understood very well.
l wish to beat you with slipper.

726
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,821
But l respect your age.
l trust my talent not you.

727
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,661
Shall l book the guest house?

728
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:48,655
Swaranjali

729
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:52,890
Greetings. Welcome to
Tata lndicom's Swaranjali.

730
00:51:53,102 --> 00:51:55,002
Among the selected semi-finalists,

731
00:51:55,204 --> 00:52:01,165
the great music director Jayasurya
has come to select the finalists.

732
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:12,187
Our 1st participant is Shruthi
from Srikakulam.

733
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,357
l'm going to sing the song from
film 'Saagara Sangamam'.

734
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,527
Om Nama Shivaya...

735
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:21,196
Written by Veturi,
music by llayaraja.

736
00:52:21,397 --> 00:52:22,193
Our Raja.

737
00:52:22,732 --> 00:52:26,361
When l worked under him,
l used to call him Rajaji.

738
00:52:26,836 --> 00:52:28,428
He too liked me very much.

739
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:33,198
He always use to say that if l was born earlier,
he wouldn't have survived in this field.

740
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:34,706
That's why you're copying his tunes.

741
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,706
l heard that.

742
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:56,188
Team Tolly

743
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:11,742
What tune did you sing?
- Hindolam raga.

744
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:18,576
Hindolam means Sa Ri Ga Ma.
How did you sing?

745
00:53:18,788 --> 00:53:20,255
Sa Ga Ma Da.
- Where is Ri?

746
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:21,923
There is no Ri in Hindolam.

747
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:27,423
Yes, there is no Ri.
But it's traces should be in the song.

748
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,255
That's magic.

749
00:53:29,465 --> 00:53:31,262
Such small mistakes do happen.

750
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:32,934
We too have committed such mistakes
before coming up in life.

751
00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:34,432
Correct it in the finals.

752
00:53:36,405 --> 00:53:39,431
Our next contestant is
Shravani from Hyderabad.

753
00:53:39,975 --> 00:53:42,773
l'm going to sing a song from
the film 'Shankarabharanam'.

754
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:46,173
Samaja Varagamana...
Written by Veturi, Thyagaraja Keerthana

755
00:53:46,382 --> 00:53:47,508
Music by K.V. Mahadevan.

756
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:48,615
My uncle's song.

757
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:52,283
l've a bond with this particular song.

758
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:54,952
Don't say that you composed
music for this song.

759
00:53:56,992 --> 00:54:00,951
We stayed in golden beach to
compose tunes for Shankarabharanam.

760
00:54:02,164 --> 00:54:03,631
You know about Vishwanath.

761
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,130
He never accepts anything in first go.

762
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:07,295
Sometimes we used to sit till 2 am.

763
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:12,638
Those days, we were so dedicated.
Uncle was humming like this...

764
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:20,638
l said that the tune is ready.
And he made the tune.

765
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,741
He values my judgement.

766
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:27,216
You must be very brave to
have selected that song.

767
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,338
Don't keep changing the channels.
Give me the remote.

768
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:53,515
Wait.
- What happened?

769
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:54,842
That's the girl whom l mentioned about.

770
00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:24,305
What are you singing?

771
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,310
What is the tempo of the
song you're singing?

772
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:34,451
Do you know the value of that song?

773
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:38,386
lt's a romantic song between
Chandramohan & Rajalakshmi.

774
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:39,561
Where is the romance?

775
00:55:43,732 --> 00:55:47,668
What l mean to say is that a man
who is hungry shouts differently

776
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,737
and the man who is hurt
shouts differently.

777
00:55:51,106 --> 00:55:55,668
Every thing has a unique tune.

778
00:55:56,178 --> 00:56:00,581
lnstead of concentrating on your clothes,
you could've concentrated on the song.

779
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,080
Sometimes, l fear that Telugu film
songs have come to an end.

780
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:11,252
Don't kill music director's creativity
with your half baked knowledge.

781
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,918
Don't disappoint us who want
to give you a good break.

782
00:56:18,467 --> 00:56:21,095
We want to take you to greater heights.
But you remain where you are.

783
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:22,031
You never come there.

784
00:56:22,972 --> 00:56:23,939
You mean guest house.

785
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:27,700
Atleast show some dedication
in the finals.

786
00:56:28,077 --> 00:56:29,374
l'm ready to give you a break.

787
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:34,273
Why did you get tensed?
l thought you might die.

788
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,109
Are you disappointed that l didn't die?

789
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:38,445
You were emotional and
spoke too much.

790
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:39,912
Wait for the reaction.

791
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:52,864
My heart is overjoyed
in your thoughts.

792
00:56:53,068 --> 00:56:59,974
My heart has crossed the boundaries
of love with your looks.

793
00:57:00,175 --> 00:57:00,869
Stop it.

794
00:57:01,076 --> 00:57:02,907
What's that language?

795
00:57:03,112 --> 00:57:04,909
Even l couldn't understand it.
How will people understand it?

796
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:06,741
People will understand.
- Shut up.

797
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:08,143
Making fun of me!

798
00:57:09,618 --> 00:57:12,212
Can we send those track singing girls?

799
00:57:12,421 --> 00:57:14,685
Aren't they taking money?
Are they singing for free?

800
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:17,390
lf they need any favour, they must ask me?
Who are you in the middle?

801
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:19,493
lf they ask you a favour,
they know what you will ask them.

802
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:21,219
Get lost.

803
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:24,032
Sing something in our style.
- Okay master.

804
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:24,995
Sing.

805
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:34,240
O girl! You opened the
doors of your heart.

806
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:36,573
Someone has come to see you.

807
00:57:37,046 --> 00:57:38,638
Let them in.
- Okay sir.

808
00:57:39,381 --> 00:57:41,212
lt must be that girl!
How is the reaction?

809
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,315
She came to me running.

810
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:43,416
O girl! You opened the
doors of your heart.

811
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:45,052
Girl...girl...

812
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,279
Replace girl with thatch...

813
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:53,051
O thatch! You unlocked your heart.

814
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:03,731
O thatch! You unlocked your heart.

815
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:09,733
ls this also a settlement case?
- No, a personal case.

816
00:58:16,685 --> 00:58:17,652
Greetings sir.

817
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:19,344
Who are you guys?

818
00:58:19,555 --> 00:58:21,147
Your fans.
- Fans?

819
00:58:21,357 --> 00:58:23,552
Khairtabad Jayasurya youth association.

820
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:26,027
When did you start this?
- Just now.

821
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,922
A few days back,
a group of people came here

822
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:30,395
and promised to throw flowers
when my name appears in the titles,

823
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:32,261
and took Rs.25000.
They didn't even clap.

824
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,368
We aren't like them.
- So, what are you then?

825
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,130
They took but didn't clap hands.
But we will clap without taking money.

826
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:39,170
Then okay.
Sit here.

827
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:41,405
What brings you here?
- l will tell you.

828
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,770
On your birthday...

829
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,878
Will you distribute free food?
- No. Blood donation.

830
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,638
All over Andhra Pradesh.

831
00:58:47,616 --> 00:58:50,449
My blessings are with you always.
- We need your blood not blessings.

832
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:52,211
Whose?
- Yours.

833
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:53,985
l will tell you.

834
00:58:54,523 --> 00:58:56,150
Close the doors.

835
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:58,223
We have decided to donate
your blood all over the state.

836
00:58:58,427 --> 00:58:59,621
Who are you to donate my blood?

837
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,194
Who are you to steal other's tunes?

838
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:05,922
Why are you hitting me?

839
00:59:06,402 --> 00:59:07,426
Why are you hitting me?

840
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:09,101
Why are you hitting me?

841
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,268
Understood?

842
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:12,940
lf you raise a question,
my answer will be this.

843
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:14,837
So, shut up & do as l say.

844
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:16,534
What should l do?
- Make a tune.

845
00:59:16,745 --> 00:59:19,213
Write lyrics to that tune,
sing that song & try to impress us.

846
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:20,109
Okay.

847
00:59:20,315 --> 00:59:21,680
Hey, B22.

848
00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:27,549
We must drink & breathe Telugu.

849
00:59:27,756 --> 00:59:32,523
Drink & enjoy.

850
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:40,362
The gardener's head should break...

851
00:59:40,569 --> 00:59:43,868
Trying to cheat me just like you
cheat producers & directors?

852
00:59:44,073 --> 00:59:45,165
What did l do?

853
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:47,236
Why are you in a hurry?
l will tell you.

854
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:49,035
Sing the original song of this tune.

855
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,016
Do you understand now,
why l slapped you?

856
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:56,946
Yes, l do.

857
00:59:57,152 --> 00:59:57,880
Understood what?

858
00:59:58,087 --> 00:59:59,748
You want something new from me.

859
00:59:59,955 --> 01:00:00,717
Start.

860
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:02,686
l didn't expect you to have
such good music knowledge.

861
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,052
Don't try to act smart.
Sing your own song.

862
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,161
By God's grace l didn't have to
make my own tune till now.

863
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:09,227
Now try.

864
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:10,261
l can't compose a tune suddenly.

865
01:00:10,466 --> 01:00:11,728
What are you talking?

866
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,724
Don't keep hitting me.

867
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,701
l composed a beautiful tune before
becoming a music director.

868
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:18,770
l never gave it to anyone.

869
01:00:18,974 --> 01:00:20,168
No one took that tune.

870
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:23,775
l'll dedicate it to you now.
- Go ahead.

871
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:38,850
Team Tolly

872
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:46,130
What happened sir?

873
01:00:46,702 --> 01:00:49,637
The tempo is different.
The tune is different.

874
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:50,930
What are you singing?

875
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,539
What is the tempo of the
song you're singing?

876
01:00:57,212 --> 01:01:00,010
At times, l fear that Telugu film
music is in its last days.

877
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:02,046
Your fans want to take
you to greater heights.

878
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:03,047
But you insist to stay here.

879
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:04,549
You never try to come there.

880
01:01:04,753 --> 01:01:05,617
l understood.

881
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:07,880
You're not my fans.
Her fans.

882
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,079
You're very sharp.

883
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,849
That's why you caught the point so late.

884
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,889
Did you understand?
- Yes sir.

885
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:14,460
That girl in the finals...

886
01:01:14,663 --> 01:01:15,687
You don't have to tell everything.

887
01:01:15,898 --> 01:01:17,058
Watch the remaining part on TV.

888
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:18,631
You will come up in life.

889
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,062
Hope my life doesn't end.

890
01:01:20,269 --> 01:01:22,237
lt depends on your behaviour.

891
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,004
l didn't expect so much reaction.

892
01:01:28,177 --> 01:01:29,371
Take your bank receipt.

893
01:01:29,578 --> 01:01:31,307
Seenu paid your credit card due.

894
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:33,572
He warned you not to
take any more loans.

895
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:34,646
Okay sir.

896
01:01:37,886 --> 01:01:38,853
Why is she here?

897
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:41,750
You must be Shravani who reached
the semifinal in Swaranjali.

898
01:01:42,357 --> 01:01:43,915
People know me.

899
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:44,784
Yes.

900
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,927
Finals will start in a few hours.
Why are you still here?

901
01:01:47,296 --> 01:01:49,093
l'm not participating in finals.

902
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:52,267
Boss, sister-in-law is not
going to the program.

903
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,328
ls it?
Where is she now?

904
01:02:03,312 --> 01:02:04,540
Are you blind?

905
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:05,940
Shravani...!

906
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:07,274
Yes.

907
01:02:07,482 --> 01:02:08,506
Are you also my fan?

908
01:02:08,717 --> 01:02:10,776
Notjust an ordinary fan.
A very big fan.

909
01:02:10,986 --> 01:02:12,544
l couldn't pay for the
SMS's l sent for you.

910
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:14,119
So, my outgoing got cut.

911
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,122
The program is being shot there.
Why are you still here?

912
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:18,350
Go immediately.

913
01:02:19,228 --> 01:02:21,492
l'm fed up explaining to all my fans.

914
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:24,291
l'm not participating
in that program.

915
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:25,295
That's all.

916
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:29,901
Boss, l'm Jayasurya speaking.

917
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:32,164
lt's getting late for the program.
That girl hasn't come.

918
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,432
What should l do now?

919
01:02:33,642 --> 01:02:34,973
Postpone the program.

920
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:37,476
lt's nice, ah?

921
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,874
Move...move...

922
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:43,482
Why are you in a hurry?

923
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:45,084
Can't you be careful enough?

924
01:02:45,287 --> 01:02:48,484
Shravani's program is about to
start on TV, so...

925
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,679
So, l was in a hurry.

926
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,360
Are you also her fan just like me?
- Yes sir.

927
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,462
As her fan, what are you doing here?

928
01:02:56,198 --> 01:02:58,166
A bad news for all her fans.
- What?

929
01:02:58,367 --> 01:02:59,766
She is not participating in it.

930
01:03:00,836 --> 01:03:02,201
l had so many dreams.

931
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:07,671
lf what you're saying is true,
l wish to lie on the railway tracks & die.

932
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,008
Take me to the railway tracks.
- You don't need to.

933
01:03:11,146 --> 01:03:12,613
She will sing.
You don't worry.

934
01:03:12,814 --> 01:03:14,179
She will sing for fans like us.

935
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:15,645
You don't worry.

936
01:03:15,851 --> 01:03:17,580
Go.
Make sure she sings.

937
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:24,354
Shravani, you shouldn't cry.

938
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,254
You must wipe out the tears
of your fans.

939
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:37,171
lt was you l first dreamed about.

940
01:03:37,372 --> 01:03:42,810
lt's you who is infront of my eyes.

941
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:48,574
O dreams! Tell me whether
you'll come true.

942
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:54,279
O heart! What is she?
A silence or a beautiful song?

943
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:59,984
So close yet so far.

944
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:05,531
Won't you be mine, O friend!

945
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,964
You call this a song?

946
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:16,372
What lyric is that?

947
01:04:16,611 --> 01:04:18,806
What we gave him wasn't
enough l think?

948
01:04:19,281 --> 01:04:21,909
lt was wonderful. Fantastic.

949
01:04:24,286 --> 01:04:25,878
She is very different from
the semi final presentation.

950
01:04:26,088 --> 01:04:28,113
She is like Goddess Saraswathi herself.

951
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:34,621
That's all.

952
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,297
lt's not my success.

953
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,932
lt belongs to my fans who gave
me courage & sent me here.

954
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:41,159
Do you think it's for your song?

955
01:04:42,304 --> 01:04:43,862
Fans! Don't waste time.

956
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:46,097
lf you want to do some good
things on behalf of me,

957
01:04:46,308 --> 01:04:48,742
like blood donation,

958
01:04:48,944 --> 01:04:50,639
l request them through
this program to do it.

959
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,746
Boss, don't entertain such things.
- Leave it.

960
01:04:52,948 --> 01:04:55,280
He is feeling shy.

961
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:59,312
Uncle, did you get all the details
of the person who comes now?

962
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,887
Secretariat Gopal Rao
recommended this boy.

963
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,490
You will find fault in everyone.

964
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:06,183
Just don't mind it.

965
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:13,565
Don't quarrel with anyone.

966
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,031
Deal carefully.
- Okay boss.

967
01:05:15,237 --> 01:05:17,467
To me, marriage is like betel leaves.

968
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:22,609
Life will turn colourful only if betel, nut
and calcium mix in right proportions.

969
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:24,244
lf not, your life will burn
like your mouth.

970
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:25,708
Right?
- Yes.

971
01:05:25,914 --> 01:05:28,474
Since you're very cautious,
l pit the one marrying you.

972
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:29,945
You don't have to fear.

973
01:05:30,152 --> 01:05:31,744
A Cupid will come for her.

974
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,422
l know. Come inside.

975
01:05:39,628 --> 01:05:41,493
Come in. Sit.

976
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:43,891
Settle it immediately.
How many more should've to come?

977
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,157
You won't have such problem.

978
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:47,301
You're being refereed by
Secretariat Gopal Rao.

979
01:05:47,502 --> 01:05:48,901
You will be my first preference.

980
01:05:49,104 --> 01:05:50,969
You & the girl must meet.
Both should agree.

981
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:53,573
And get married.

982
01:05:54,976 --> 01:05:56,068
Do you think l'm here for
bride seeing ceremony?

983
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,511
Yes, l think.

984
01:05:59,714 --> 01:06:00,339
You?

985
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:01,447
Yes, it's me.

986
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,810
Do you know him?

987
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:05,646
Yes, uncle.
He is my fan.

988
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:07,952
What's your name?

989
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:11,219
Didn't you tell her my details?

990
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:12,859
l did tell her.
But she might have forgotten.

991
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:14,528
His name is Sharat.

992
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,027
What's your occupation?

993
01:06:17,399 --> 01:06:18,593
Haven't you told her even this?

994
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:21,602
l did tell her.
Software engineer.

995
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:22,633
Where?

996
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:24,196
Haven't you told her even this?

997
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:25,896
l did tell her.
Don't get angry.

998
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:28,406
He is working as software engineer
in Tata lndicom.

999
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,703
Now l'll tell her everything in one shot.
- Okay.

1000
01:06:30,912 --> 01:06:32,539
As Secretariat Gopal Rao said,

1001
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:34,874
l'm working as Software Engineer
in Tata lndicom.

1002
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:35,674
My name is Sharat.

1003
01:06:35,884 --> 01:06:37,476
Let's be friends for sometime.

1004
01:06:37,686 --> 01:06:40,348
Only then l will know your
good & bad qualities.

1005
01:06:40,555 --> 01:06:42,887
And you will know about
my good & bad qualities.

1006
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,654
lt looks like a big process.

1007
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:49,991
Really?

1008
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,567
ls it?

1009
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:55,468
Okay. l will take care.

1010
01:06:57,072 --> 01:06:57,766
What happened, uncle?

1011
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,304
lt's about credit card people.

1012
01:06:59,508 --> 01:07:01,567
They will lure us with a sweet voice
to take credit card.

1013
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:03,368
Once taken, then they threaten us.

1014
01:07:03,578 --> 01:07:05,569
Moreover, they have hired
goons for collection.

1015
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,907
ls this fair?
- No.

1016
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,509
The real Sharat must have come.

1017
01:07:12,254 --> 01:07:12,743
lt must be them.

1018
01:07:12,954 --> 01:07:13,579
Shall l deal with them?

1019
01:07:13,788 --> 01:07:14,254
No thanks.

1020
01:07:14,456 --> 01:07:15,582
l will handle them.
l can manage them.

1021
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:16,654
l'll talk to them.

1022
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:18,086
Let me talk to them.

1023
01:07:18,293 --> 01:07:20,090
Sharat, leave him.

1024
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,024
lt's usual for him.

1025
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:24,728
You sit down.

1026
01:07:28,436 --> 01:07:29,095
l'm Sharat.

1027
01:07:29,304 --> 01:07:31,499
Who cares?

1028
01:07:33,074 --> 01:07:33,540
lt's me.

1029
01:07:33,742 --> 01:07:35,801
l know who you are & why you're here.
lt will not work out. Go away.

1030
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,069
You asked me to come here.

1031
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:40,112
You came because l invited you.
Now l'm telling you to go. Go.

1032
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:41,914
How could you address me
without any respect?

1033
01:07:42,117 --> 01:07:43,311
l'm like this.
l won't give you any respect.

1034
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,416
What can you do?

1035
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:47,019
Not here. l will inquire
in the secretariat.

1036
01:07:48,423 --> 01:07:49,321
Excuse me.

1037
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,219
Do you think l will get scared
on hearing the secretariat name?

1038
01:07:51,426 --> 01:07:53,018
Secretariat Gopal is my close friend.

1039
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:55,219
He might be your friend.
But he is my relative.

1040
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:56,556
Actually, Gopal Rao...

1041
01:07:56,765 --> 01:07:58,699
Will you ask him to put this man in jail?

1042
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:00,557
Won't you leave him even after that?

1043
01:08:00,769 --> 01:08:01,929
What are you talking?

1044
01:08:02,137 --> 01:08:02,728
Actually Gopal Rao...

1045
01:08:02,938 --> 01:08:04,496
There is no one called Gopal Rao here.

1046
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:05,764
You get inside.

1047
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:06,970
Come here.

1048
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:08,637
l would've died in suffocation.

1049
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:12,108
l should tell him that l'm the boy
whom Gopal Rao has sent.

1050
01:08:12,314 --> 01:08:13,406
You should not.
- Why?

1051
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:14,582
Have you ever fallen in love?

1052
01:08:14,783 --> 01:08:16,808
lf l really had, why would l come
here to see this girl?- l fell in love.

1053
01:08:17,018 --> 01:08:19,282
With whom?
The girl you came to see.

1054
01:08:19,487 --> 01:08:20,511
Does she love you?

1055
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,156
lf she loves me,
why would she agree to see you?

1056
01:08:23,491 --> 01:08:24,048
You're right.

1057
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:25,123
What should l do now?

1058
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:26,225
Sacrifice.

1059
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:27,486
Why should l do it and
for whom should l do it?

1060
01:08:27,696 --> 01:08:28,219
Do it for me.

1061
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,488
Who are you?

1062
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:30,990
They will tell you.

1063
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:32,895
Where is the money?

1064
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:34,532
What is he saying?

1065
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,067
While discussing about wedding cards,

1066
01:08:36,271 --> 01:08:38,466
l told him we shouldn't talk
about credit cards.

1067
01:08:38,673 --> 01:08:39,332
Thanks.

1068
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:40,735
No formalities between us.

1069
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,968
Don't get too close.
Ourjourney has just begun.

1070
01:08:44,179 --> 01:08:45,271
l've a small doubt.

1071
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,778
ls there anyone accompanying
you apart from me?

1072
01:08:47,983 --> 01:08:50,679
No. l go one by one.
That's all.

1073
01:08:50,885 --> 01:08:53,012
Only then, l can have
full concentration on him.

1074
01:08:54,556 --> 01:08:55,784
ls this enough?
lt was little more.

1075
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:57,583
Now do you understand?

1076
01:08:57,792 --> 01:08:59,157
Understood in detail.

1077
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:00,157
What did you understand?

1078
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,623
l came here to become her husband.
You became my demon.

1079
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:04,128
What a punch!

1080
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:05,959
l was punched so badly.

1081
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:07,461
When l heard about you,

1082
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:10,137
l thought you will have goons
and girls around you.

1083
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:13,933
But you look very simple.

1084
01:09:14,142 --> 01:09:17,236
Like in your films, do you want me
to kill someone all the time?

1085
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:18,537
Painting is my life.

1086
01:09:18,747 --> 01:09:22,080
lt's great to be both painter & goon.

1087
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:23,751
Tell me why you have come here.

1088
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,785
Nothing, brother.
l couldn't sleep for the past 3 days.

1089
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:28,717
Do you want me to massage your legs?

1090
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:33,885
l don't have to explain you
how soft an artist will be.

1091
01:09:34,095 --> 01:09:36,859
A goon, a third class fellow,

1092
01:09:37,065 --> 01:09:40,057
came to my studio and
hurt me infront of my staff.

1093
01:09:40,268 --> 01:09:43,897
Notjust hurt, he beat you
to pulp, right?

1094
01:09:44,105 --> 01:09:44,867
Stop staring at me.

1095
01:09:45,073 --> 01:09:46,734
We shouldn't hide anything
from doctor & goon.

1096
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:48,033
Tell him as it is.

1097
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:51,235
Have you finished talking?
Shall l tell him the rest or will you tell him?

1098
01:09:51,446 --> 01:09:52,413
This is it.

1099
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:57,016
This is what had happened.

1100
01:09:57,218 --> 01:09:58,276
What should l do for you?

1101
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,475
You must show your power.

1102
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:02,054
No obligation because
l'm the top music director.

1103
01:10:02,257 --> 01:10:04,088
Charge as per your market rate.

1104
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,760
He should be beaten so badly that...
l will tell him.

1105
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:09,593
You should beat him
the way he beat you.

1106
01:10:09,798 --> 01:10:12,494
How will l know the way he beat him?

1107
01:10:12,701 --> 01:10:13,895
l know.

1108
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:16,094
l've never seen anyone
beating like that.

1109
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:18,536
Like Sivamani beating Jazz.

1110
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:21,509
Like Zakir Hussain with Tabla.

1111
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,074
Like AR Rahman's music
in Shankar's film.

1112
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:26,770
He beat him & then asks him to sing.

1113
01:10:26,981 --> 01:10:28,141
ln one word...

1114
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,011
You said so many words.

1115
01:10:30,218 --> 01:10:33,676
ln short, he beat him like a dog.

1116
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,517
l understood.

1117
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:40,923
He beat him to pulp.
We should beat that guy to pulp, right?

1118
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:41,993
Yes.

1119
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:43,562
Who is he?

1120
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:44,789
Bottu Seenu.

1121
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:55,333
Team Tolly

1122
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,808
You look good. Like a top.

1123
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:02,505
Are you trying to make us
go for each other's neck?

1124
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,514
l had no such ideas.

1125
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,313
My hip is paining for standing
like this for the past 3 hours.

1126
01:11:07,522 --> 01:11:08,955
Let me relax for sometime.

1127
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:11,892
Don't move.
He might start afresh.

1128
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:14,084
You feel bad more than him.

1129
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:18,288
Just because l've a creative mind,

1130
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,991
l'm drawing your face & leaving you.
lf you repeat this again...

1131
01:11:21,202 --> 01:11:22,829
Will you draw my portrait again?

1132
01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:25,038
l'll garland your photo.

1133
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:27,834
lt's over.
Come down & see for yourself.

1134
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:28,940
You will be happy.

1135
01:11:32,313 --> 01:11:34,178
Look there not me.

1136
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,346
You look like a monkey.

1137
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,955
The entire gold shop is on you.
Won't you pay the credit card bill?

1138
01:11:43,158 --> 01:11:44,284
l don't even pay the current bill.

1139
01:11:44,492 --> 01:11:45,823
How can l pay credit card bill?

1140
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:50,088
lf you do anything, l will lodge
a complaint that you're threatening us.

1141
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:52,858
Will you lodge a complaint
to the police?

1142
01:11:53,201 --> 01:11:54,429
Take all the gold.

1143
01:11:54,636 --> 01:11:56,297
Stop beating me.

1144
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,302
Stop it.

1145
01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:02,373
Why are you beating him like this?

1146
01:12:02,577 --> 01:12:04,545
Stop it.

1147
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,371
lf he hasn't paid the bill,
will you hit him?

1148
01:12:06,581 --> 01:12:08,981
Beating a fellow man is not right.

1149
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:13,677
l will pay his bill if you want.

1150
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:15,185
Return him gold.

1151
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,324
You take the gold & go inside.

1152
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:21,328
Shravani...you?

1153
01:12:22,897 --> 01:12:24,159
What brings you here, Shravani?

1154
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:25,855
l was going to temple.
l saw you. l stopped.

1155
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:27,329
Really?

1156
01:12:27,535 --> 01:12:28,194
Even l was going to temple.

1157
01:12:28,403 --> 01:12:29,233
l saw them quarelling.
So, l stopped.

1158
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:30,995
l go to temple every Saturday.

1159
01:12:31,206 --> 01:12:31,934
Let's go.

1160
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:41,111
What happened?
He is beating my fans.

1161
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:45,010
Boss...

1162
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:47,714
Why is he calling you boss?

1163
01:12:47,922 --> 01:12:49,856
ln Hyderabad, if someone needs help,
they address others as boss.

1164
01:12:50,058 --> 01:12:51,025
You be here.

1165
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:54,022
Sir, stop beating him.

1166
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:56,459
Who are you man?
- l'm a fellow man.

1167
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,723
Then get lost.

1168
01:12:59,234 --> 01:13:00,030
Stop.

1169
01:13:01,069 --> 01:13:03,799
Your sister-in-law is watching us.
We can deal with him later.

1170
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:05,597
Go.
Please stop.

1171
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:08,640
You stop.
Leave him.

1172
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,708
lf l see you again in this area,
l will break your bones.

1173
01:13:10,912 --> 01:13:12,709
You want me to pay the bill...?

1174
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,943
Shravani...you?

1175
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,581
Did you get hurt?

1176
01:13:16,784 --> 01:13:17,978
When someone beats us,
we do get hurt.

1177
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,551
He came & saved us at the right time.

1178
01:13:19,754 --> 01:13:20,516
l did nothing.

1179
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:23,190
She pressed the brakes
on seeing you suddenly.

1180
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,889
Why were you quiet when he
was trying to beat you?

1181
01:13:29,163 --> 01:13:31,154
He will feel bad by tonight.

1182
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,560
What did Gandhi say?

1183
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:34,564
When someone slaps you on one cheek,
he told us to show the second cheek.

1184
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:35,736
That's something we can't do.

1185
01:13:35,937 --> 01:13:39,964
Atleast if we don't slap the guy who
beat us, Gandhi will feel happy.

1186
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:42,871
How dare you lay hands on Bottu Seenu!

1187
01:13:47,282 --> 01:13:49,079
Rs.10 lakhs. Total Rs.15 lakhs.
- Keep the money inside.

1188
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:50,012
Okay.

1189
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,612
Your men beat me all night.

1190
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:56,016
My boys haven't completed
boxing practice.

1191
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:57,589
l will leave you once their
practice session is over.

1192
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:59,453
l beg you.

1193
01:13:59,661 --> 01:14:00,423
Stop it.

1194
01:14:02,297 --> 01:14:03,628
lt's me Shravani.

1195
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,093
Hello Shravani, tell me.

1196
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,734
l wanted to talk to you.

1197
01:14:07,936 --> 01:14:09,267
Really? Where should l come?

1198
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,665
Why leave your office & come?

1199
01:14:11,873 --> 01:14:14,000
You be in your office.
l will come there.

1200
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:15,675
Thanks. Bye.

1201
01:14:16,377 --> 01:14:17,366
You seem to be very happy.

1202
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:18,375
Shravani is coming.

1203
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,046
ls she coming here?

1204
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:19,872
To office.

1205
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,343
When did you have an office?

1206
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:24,048
So, she is going to Sharat's office.

1207
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,119
Hey girl,

1208
01:14:29,324 --> 01:14:30,450
Where is Sharat?
- Which Sharat?

1209
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:32,353
The big guy like a buffalo.

1210
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,788
ln that cabin.

1211
01:14:34,162 --> 01:14:36,255
Hey, what are you doing?
- You?

1212
01:14:36,464 --> 01:14:37,795
Give me your coat.
- For what?

1213
01:14:37,999 --> 01:14:39,899
l said give it.
Give it l say.

1214
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:42,396
Did someone come here for me?

1215
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:43,730
Why would someone
come here for you?

1216
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,873
Didn't l tell you that l will use
you & your name at times?

1217
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:48,975
Don't press as you like.
They might get deleted.

1218
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,404
To hell with you.
l know everything.

1219
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:51,636
Now, l am Sharat.

1220
01:14:51,846 --> 01:14:52,710
Who am l then?

1221
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:55,575
Hi Sharat!
- Hi!

1222
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,450
Sharat, he is...

1223
01:15:04,092 --> 01:15:05,024
Guess who?

1224
01:15:05,226 --> 01:15:06,124
Your PA.

1225
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:09,458
What's yourjob here?

1226
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:10,561
Tell her.

1227
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,465
Do you have to tell her about my job?

1228
01:15:14,736 --> 01:15:16,829
l told you to order something
for her to drink.

1229
01:15:17,038 --> 01:15:18,062
You're very clever.

1230
01:15:18,272 --> 01:15:20,240
You change everything
to your convenience.

1231
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:25,739
l told you that there is virus
in my laptop two days back.

1232
01:15:25,947 --> 01:15:27,414
Clients are coming.

1233
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,175
Don't you have any sense that
l've to give them a presentation.

1234
01:15:31,552 --> 01:15:35,318
Sharat, why is he talking to your PA
instead of talking to you?

1235
01:15:35,523 --> 01:15:37,889
We don't talk to each other.
He is our mediator.

1236
01:15:38,092 --> 01:15:39,252
What's the problem?

1237
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,449
Ego problem.

1238
01:15:41,095 --> 01:15:43,689
Whenever l come to talk, you take
leave to meet prospective brides.

1239
01:15:44,432 --> 01:15:48,198
What's this meeting?
Who are they?

1240
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:51,534
Who are you say that?

1241
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,704
Did you say that too?

1242
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:55,835
l was wondering why you haven't
said that till now.

1243
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:57,238
Come on, go ahead.

1244
01:15:57,445 --> 01:16:00,608
Ask me who l am?
Ask me why l'm sitting in this office?

1245
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:02,544
Ask me who this girl is?

1246
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:04,676
Who is this girl?

1247
01:16:04,886 --> 01:16:06,683
lf there are any problems between us,
we must solve them.

1248
01:16:06,888 --> 01:16:09,049
How could you insult her
by asking who she is?

1249
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:13,694
ls asking an insult?
- Asking a celebrity who she is, is an insult?

1250
01:16:13,895 --> 01:16:16,796
ls she a celebrity?
What celebrity?

1251
01:16:17,598 --> 01:16:18,656
Shravani, a great singer.

1252
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:22,131
l've never heard her name.

1253
01:16:23,438 --> 01:16:26,566
Shravani, don't feel bad.
He has no manners.

1254
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,835
You can become the
CEO of this company.

1255
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,376
But you can never become a singer.

1256
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:35,105
l feel insulted to speak to
cultureless creatures like you.

1257
01:16:36,317 --> 01:16:36,976
What?

1258
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:39,585
Why are you shouting?
You mannersless.

1259
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:43,683
You don't get angry.
He is like that only.

1260
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:44,550
Shit!
- Worst behaviour. Let's go.

1261
01:16:44,759 --> 01:16:45,384
Shit...?

1262
01:16:49,497 --> 01:16:53,456
You brought strangers to office and
made them abuse me, ah?

1263
01:16:53,668 --> 01:16:54,896
l'm in no way related to them.

1264
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:58,664
Why did they come to your cabin
and sat in your chair?

1265
01:16:58,873 --> 01:17:00,864
Notjust in my chair,
but also in my life.

1266
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:01,973
Why should we quarrel with him?

1267
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:06,010
When he is so rude,
why were you so polite?

1268
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:08,014
l am not interested in fights.

1269
01:17:08,216 --> 01:17:10,275
But how could you be
so soft & polite?

1270
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:12,009
He will feel bad later.

1271
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,815
The other day, when someone hit you,
you said that he will feel bad later.

1272
01:17:16,023 --> 01:17:17,047
But did he feel bad?

1273
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,688
Forgive me, sir.

1274
01:17:19,894 --> 01:17:23,125
l couldn't sleep last night
after hitting you.

1275
01:17:23,564 --> 01:17:26,590
Now if you forgive me,
l will sleep peacefully.

1276
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:28,598
lf you feel bad for you acts,
it is the greatest regret.

1277
01:17:28,803 --> 01:17:30,134
There is a change in you
atleast now.

1278
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:33,307
That's enough for me.
Never hit anyone, Go.

1279
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:37,666
Shravani, my family members
are your fans.

1280
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:40,006
You must marry a good man like him.

1281
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:41,306
Bye.

1282
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,979
Unbelievable Sharat.

1283
01:17:44,185 --> 01:17:45,914
Your formula is really great.

1284
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,382
l did nothing.

1285
01:17:47,588 --> 01:17:49,783
Gandhiji laid the foundation,
l followed his foot steps.

1286
01:17:49,991 --> 01:17:51,788
You mentioned aboutjourney earlier.

1287
01:17:51,993 --> 01:17:54,086
Can l know how far we have
travelled in thatjourney?

1288
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,092
We are near the canopy.

1289
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:19,910
Team Tolly

1290
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:41,468
l'm your king,
you're my queen...

1291
01:18:41,876 --> 01:18:45,607
Shall we unite and
rule over Andhra Pradesh?

1292
01:18:48,249 --> 01:18:58,215
Team Tolly

1293
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:09,300
l was waiting eagerly to be yours...
Have a ball with me...

1294
01:19:09,503 --> 01:19:13,303
My heart is on rocks today...

1295
01:19:13,507 --> 01:19:16,806
Nobody ever moved me
like this till now...

1296
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:21,141
O girl, you're my beautiful
Cinderella...

1297
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:24,807
By God's grace,
l'm on cloud nine...

1298
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:29,149
You've created sensation
in my heart...

1299
01:19:29,357 --> 01:19:33,817
By God's grace,
l'm on cloud nine...

1300
01:19:57,451 --> 01:20:04,687
Up above the clouds
l'm touching the peak of love...

1301
01:20:09,397 --> 01:20:13,128
You're a star,
l'm near you...

1302
01:20:13,401 --> 01:20:16,859
Wiping out the distance between us,
l'm coming closer to you...

1303
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:25,211
l'm getting lighter and
floating in sky...

1304
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:28,871
As l share my love with you...

1305
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:32,780
l'm happy for getting you...

1306
01:20:32,987 --> 01:20:36,388
May l save this unexpected
bliss forever with me?

1307
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:59,803
Team Tolly

1308
01:21:17,465 --> 01:21:21,094
Though l love you for long time...

1309
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,938
l'm angry on my lips for
expressing it to you..

1310
01:21:28,642 --> 01:21:33,102
Though you're near,
though you've called me...

1311
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:36,939
But l got an opportunity
to meet you now...

1312
01:21:41,489 --> 01:21:45,289
Though l'm in your thoughts
and your breath...

1313
01:21:45,493 --> 01:21:48,951
Without me your loneliness
is unbearable...

1314
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:52,792
l've lost myself in dreams
losing my sleep...

1315
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,527
May l give you as gift my bliss?

1316
01:22:33,174 --> 01:22:35,335
lt seems there was an exhibition
of MF Hussain's paintings.

1317
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:36,902
And he got millions.

1318
01:22:37,211 --> 01:22:39,111
Let's also have an exhibition
of your paintings, boss.

1319
01:22:39,313 --> 01:22:43,010
We too can make millions.
- Shut up! Never sell art.

1320
01:22:43,217 --> 01:22:46,277
Even if you wish to sell
there are no takers.

1321
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:49,688
Without colouring it,
why are you making noise?

1322
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,188
Am l talking, Master?
My boys are doing it.

1323
01:22:52,393 --> 01:22:55,362
lf you don't concentrate you'll also
end up as fool like them.

1324
01:22:56,897 --> 01:22:58,660
Boys! Respect master!

1325
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:13,904
Team Tolly

1326
01:23:19,587 --> 01:23:21,452
l didn't like what you did.

1327
01:23:22,857 --> 01:23:26,816
You claimed it was your fans who
made you win the song competition.

1328
01:23:27,261 --> 01:23:29,286
You didn't say a word about me,
your brother.

1329
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:33,227
lf l had, people would come to know
l'm your sister, isn't it brother?

1330
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:36,559
How much foresight you've
regarding security?

1331
01:23:37,605 --> 01:23:38,572
l couldn't think about it.

1332
01:23:38,772 --> 01:23:41,400
lt's a surprize if you could,
what's so surprize if you couldn't.

1333
01:23:42,276 --> 01:23:44,710
My foot! Aunty...uncle...
- Yes son.

1334
01:23:45,079 --> 01:23:46,910
Are you taking good care of her?

1335
01:23:47,114 --> 01:23:50,982
We don't have children so we take
care of her as our own daughter.

1336
01:23:51,185 --> 01:23:53,813
That's okay, how far your
painting classes have come?

1337
01:23:54,455 --> 01:23:57,754
With master's guidance l'm now
into colouring from curvings.

1338
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:01,621
Even young boys take just 2 weeks
to reach this stage,

1339
01:24:01,862 --> 01:24:03,352
your brother took 2 years.

1340
01:24:03,564 --> 01:24:06,761
My sister has come and
my creative work is disturbed.

1341
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:08,764
So, please grant me leave
today from class.

1342
01:24:09,637 --> 01:24:11,537
Did you see the Hippocratic world?

1343
01:24:11,972 --> 01:24:16,773
They say l'm like God or their son
when they come for a settlement.

1344
01:24:17,144 --> 01:24:21,274
But nobody gave their daughter
in marriage to me.

1345
01:24:21,482 --> 01:24:23,109
They said l'm a goon's son.

1346
01:24:23,717 --> 01:24:25,207
Now l've crossed
the age of marriage.

1347
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:26,613
Forget about me.

1348
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,948
l sent to you to be with uncle to avoid
you also becoming like me.

1349
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:32,949
Did you find any good man?
- Yes, brother.

1350
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,787
Who is he?

1351
01:24:35,262 --> 01:24:39,460
l found a man l dreamed
about since my childhood.

1352
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,802
Moreover he's my fan, name's Sharat,
he's a software engineer.

1353
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:45,972
Why are you delaying it?
Bring him here and tie the knot.

1354
01:24:46,173 --> 01:24:47,800
Here? He'll die in shock.

1355
01:24:48,008 --> 01:24:51,307
ls he an heart patient?
- No, he's a coward.

1356
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:54,748
l've kept our background
secret to him.

1357
01:24:54,949 --> 01:24:56,644
lf he comes to know,
he'll ditch me.- ls it?

1358
01:24:58,118 --> 01:24:58,982
How?

1359
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:03,148
You don't worry, brother,
l've a plan for it.

1360
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:07,490
How come you're getting ready so early?
Where are you going?

1361
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:10,891
Shravani wants to introduce me
to her family. That's why!

1362
01:25:12,099 --> 01:25:14,499
Seenu sir, l'm Sharat.
- Who?

1363
01:25:15,135 --> 01:25:16,659
The identity you're using.

1364
01:25:17,037 --> 01:25:18,436
You?! Tell me.

1365
01:25:18,772 --> 01:25:21,070
What am l to tell?
- Then, hang up.

1366
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:25,835
Don't cut it sir, l used your identity
as you used mine.

1367
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:27,013
How's the result?

1368
01:25:28,882 --> 01:25:30,747
Sir, money.- Do you know who am l?
- No.

1369
01:25:31,051 --> 01:25:33,611
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,

1370
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:35,948
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,

1371
01:25:36,156 --> 01:25:39,182
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?

1372
01:25:39,393 --> 01:25:40,018
Are you Bottu Seenu?

1373
01:25:40,894 --> 01:25:42,020
Take anything you want sir.

1374
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,857
l'll come back if l want.
l used his name.

1375
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:47,431
l'm very happy,
use my name as you like.

1376
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:49,095
l tried that too.

1377
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:51,529
Money sir.

1378
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:52,865
Do you know who am l?
- No.

1379
01:25:53,173 --> 01:25:55,869
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,

1380
01:25:56,076 --> 01:25:58,374
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,

1381
01:25:58,579 --> 01:26:02,208
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?

1382
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:03,383
Are you Bottu Seenu?

1383
01:26:04,084 --> 01:26:04,550
Bloody!

1384
01:26:04,752 --> 01:26:05,776
Leave my vest, who are you?

1385
01:26:05,986 --> 01:26:07,044
Abids area Cl!

1386
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:11,382
How dare you threaten my brother-in-law
to settle credit card due? Come!

1387
01:26:13,827 --> 01:26:16,387
Along with favours you've to
face troubles too, enjoy it.

1388
01:26:16,697 --> 01:26:20,793
Well said, please do me a favour.
- What's it?

1389
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:25,233
They want to come to the station
everyday to sign.- Do it.

1390
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:28,234
They may arrest me again for forgery.

1391
01:26:28,442 --> 01:26:29,568
What do you want me to do then?

1392
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:34,073
Tell Sl that you're real Bottu Seenu.
No need to spend a rupee also.

1393
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:38,577
Line was clear till now.

1394
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:40,083
l can't hear it now. What can l do?

1395
01:26:41,855 --> 01:26:42,822
How could he accept it directly?

1396
01:26:43,023 --> 01:26:45,423
lf he's here, someday she may know
you're not the real Sharat.

1397
01:26:45,626 --> 01:26:46,422
Then, let's bump him off.

1398
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:48,754
Shut up! l'll tell her the truth
at an opportune time.

1399
01:26:48,962 --> 01:26:49,587
Okay brother.

1400
01:27:05,546 --> 01:27:07,537
What's this? lt's funny!

1401
01:27:07,748 --> 01:27:10,478
Why are we still revolving here only?

1402
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,549
How do we go inside?

1403
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:14,977
Sir, the way in is this side.

1404
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,020
l know, you go away.

1405
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,364
Who are you man?

1406
01:27:30,104 --> 01:27:31,799
Brother! ls it you?

1407
01:27:32,072 --> 01:27:33,300
Got deceived, right?

1408
01:27:33,974 --> 01:27:36,374
You look like a business man
to any stranger.

1409
01:27:36,577 --> 01:27:38,044
Even known people must
feel like that.

1410
01:27:38,245 --> 01:27:40,475
Otherwise, bones will crack up!
- Shut up! Useless!

1411
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:43,650
lf you say anything l'll burn your mouth.
Shut up!

1412
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,912
Or else our plan will fail.
- Do as she says.

1413
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:50,418
But where is Sharat?

1414
01:28:04,271 --> 01:28:07,968
Hey King!

1415
01:28:14,548 --> 01:28:15,344
Who are you?

1416
01:28:15,549 --> 01:28:16,675
Why are you getting into the vehicle?

1417
01:28:16,884 --> 01:28:18,010
Reverse the jeep.

1418
01:28:18,218 --> 01:28:19,242
Why should l?

1419
01:28:19,887 --> 01:28:22,014
No questions, just follow the orders.

1420
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,247
l'm on an important mission,
why are you troubling me?

1421
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,857
Don't act smart, King!

1422
01:28:26,059 --> 01:28:29,085
King? Who is he?
- Get going.

1423
01:28:47,014 --> 01:28:49,642
Why so many guns and Sumos
like in faction films?

1424
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:51,818
Leave me boys,
my girl is waiting for me.

1425
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:53,077
Don't talk.

1426
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,688
Brother...got him.

1427
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:24,071
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,

1428
01:30:24,278 --> 01:30:26,746
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,

1429
01:30:26,947 --> 01:30:31,782
all around Hyderabad,
l've a name 'Bottu' Seenu.

1430
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:33,450
Who is this King?

1431
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:38,020
Kill him!

1432
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,729
Why hasn't he come yet?
Did he pick up any fight on the way?

1433
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:27,429
Fight? Sharat is scared of fights.

1434
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:42,619
You know this? Sharat faints on
seeing blood.- Poor man!

1435
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:02,206
lf you make a wrong call,
you waste only a call.

1436
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:06,243
lf you disturb a wrong man,
wastage will be heavy like this.

1437
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:14,986
Where did he go away?
Why hasn't he come yet?

1438
01:32:15,756 --> 01:32:18,725
Why did get so late?
My brother is waiting.- Brother?

1439
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,558
l don't have anyone else
other than my brother.

1440
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:23,127
He sent me to live with
my paternal uncle.

1441
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,820
What does your brother do?

1442
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,827
Come, l'll introduce you to him.

1443
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,102
Brother!

1444
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:42,042
Brother!

1445
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:10,706
She gave me the shock of my life!

1446
01:33:12,646 --> 01:33:14,511
She made me believe she's pint size
Mother Teresa with her acting prowess,

1447
01:33:14,715 --> 01:33:15,875
but actually she's
king sized Phoolan Devi.

1448
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:18,017
That's okay, but how did you
manage to come out?

1449
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:19,647
l'll tell you.
- Brother!

1450
01:33:24,658 --> 01:33:29,027
Bottu Seenu, how dare you trap
my sister with fake identity!

1451
01:33:29,496 --> 01:33:31,123
Who are you talking to sir?
- Why are you turning back?

1452
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:32,320
l'm talking to you.
- Me?

1453
01:33:32,532 --> 01:33:33,965
Yes, Bottu Seenu!

1454
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:37,000
Brother! What's this?
His name is not Bottu Seenu.

1455
01:33:37,204 --> 01:33:40,935
l'll make him say he's not
Sharat but Bottu Seenu.- Brother!

1456
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:52,044
Why are you calling Bottu Seenu
as Sharat who works for me?

1457
01:33:52,419 --> 01:33:53,545
What are you saying, brother?

1458
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:56,484
He was referred by Secretariat
Gopal Rao, uncle's friend.

1459
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:59,056
l selected him after many tests,

1460
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:01,227
you spoiled entire the show
by brandishing a gun.

1461
01:34:01,528 --> 01:34:03,189
lf people know l'm your sister,

1462
01:34:03,396 --> 01:34:07,059
no educated man will ever marry me,
so l stayed with uncle,

1463
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:10,896
and made up a story that l hate goons,
and trapped this innocent man.

1464
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:12,002
you spoilt everything.

1465
01:34:12,205 --> 01:34:14,435
You acted as singer with
such a violent mob background.

1466
01:34:14,641 --> 01:34:17,405
Spill water and wake him up!

1467
01:34:23,049 --> 01:34:25,677
Hold it.- You said your brother
is into hardware business...?

1468
01:34:26,052 --> 01:34:27,679
What's that gun?
Who is this Bottu Seenu?

1469
01:34:27,888 --> 01:34:29,355
A dangerous goon.

1470
01:34:29,556 --> 01:34:31,387
He's a replica of you.
- Yes.

1471
01:34:31,591 --> 01:34:32,717
Why is he carrying gun then?

1472
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,060
Brother is a big business man,

1473
01:34:35,262 --> 01:34:37,196
he's facing a threat from him, that's why.

1474
01:34:37,397 --> 01:34:38,694
Carries a gun for self defense.

1475
01:34:38,899 --> 01:34:41,060
l don't understand what's all
these guns and threats?

1476
01:34:41,268 --> 01:34:44,704
You don't worry,
l've an urgent meeting,

1477
01:34:44,905 --> 01:34:46,930
you carry on with lunch.
Come on boys.

1478
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,210
Brother is no ordinary man.
- Always great!

1479
01:34:52,512 --> 01:34:54,104
Greetings sir.
- Greetings, where is Seenu?

1480
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:57,715
That is...that is...
- What's it? Where is he?

1481
01:34:57,918 --> 01:34:58,748
He's sleeping.
- Yes brother.

1482
01:34:58,952 --> 01:35:01,819
ls he any Nawab to sleep till now?
Wake him up.

1483
01:35:02,022 --> 01:35:04,957
No brother... - Get up...
- Please listen, he'll beat on waking up.

1484
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:06,819
Are you so weak?
Pull it with strength.

1485
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,819
Who is that disturbing me
early morning?

1486
01:35:11,932 --> 01:35:14,059
Partner! How come you're here?
For your commission?

1487
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:15,564
No, we came to confirm.

1488
01:35:15,769 --> 01:35:17,236
To confirm?
- You shut up.

1489
01:35:17,537 --> 01:35:20,506
Where were you at 10.30?

1490
01:35:20,807 --> 01:35:22,672
Abids police station.
- Police station?

1491
01:35:22,876 --> 01:35:25,902
l threatened Cl's brother-in-law
for credit card dues.

1492
01:35:26,112 --> 01:35:27,136
He locked me up all the night.

1493
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,475
ls it? Get me Cl Ramesh on phone.

1494
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:37,351
Brother! - Ramesh! Did you pick up anyone
by the name Bottu Seenu?

1495
01:35:37,557 --> 01:35:40,617
Notjust picked him up but
bashed him up all the night.

1496
01:35:41,895 --> 01:35:46,264
How dare you threaten my brother-in-law!
- Stop it.

1497
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:52,632
When did you free him?
- l freed him at 10.45.

1498
01:35:52,839 --> 01:35:54,500
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1499
01:35:55,842 --> 01:36:00,074
You say he locked you up,
he says he bashed you also,

1500
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,044
won't you tell him
that you're my man?

1501
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:06,117
Will he be there after basing me?
He's boasting with you.

1502
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:09,288
l'm confused who should l trust
and who l shouldn't.

1503
01:36:09,489 --> 01:36:10,979
Bye, let's go.

1504
01:36:11,858 --> 01:36:12,847
Bye Seenu.

1505
01:36:16,296 --> 01:36:20,528
Thank God!
- How can they look alike?

1506
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:22,634
l'll tell you brother.

1507
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:26,737
l saw an old Hindi film on TV recently,

1508
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,704
there's a big Nawab's family in it,

1509
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,401
they have twins after
years of marriage.

1510
01:36:32,612 --> 01:36:34,580
Twins?
- Twins!

1511
01:36:34,781 --> 01:36:37,045
Why did you say that in English?
Carry on.

1512
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:42,244
They celebrate it grandly and children get
washed away when a cyclone hits them.

1513
01:36:42,455 --> 01:36:44,013
l got you, enough.

1514
01:36:44,224 --> 01:36:47,853
One washed away son grows up as
Bottu Seenu with Bottu Narasimha.

1515
01:36:48,061 --> 01:36:50,655
Another reaches a good family and
grows up as our Sharat Babu.

1516
01:36:50,864 --> 01:36:52,422
That's all, isn't it?
- Yes, boss.

1517
01:36:53,133 --> 01:36:55,727
Tell me brother.
- Give me Sharat's address.

1518
01:36:55,936 --> 01:36:59,428
l behaved rough with Sharat
mistaking him for Bottu Seenu.

1519
01:36:59,806 --> 01:37:01,273
l'll say sorry to him personally.

1520
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:04,266
A guest at lunch time.

1521
01:37:06,346 --> 01:37:11,147
You?! No way, go away!
- Open it!

1522
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,483
Didn't you find anyone else
here other than me?

1523
01:37:13,687 --> 01:37:15,518
l beg you sir, please leave me
and my identity.

1524
01:37:15,722 --> 01:37:18,350
As if you gave your identity for free,
are you not using my name?

1525
01:37:18,558 --> 01:37:22,050
l used it without knowing your reputation,
so police are playing with me.

1526
01:37:22,262 --> 01:37:23,661
Looks like we have visitors.

1527
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:27,129
You've a family too?

1528
01:37:27,334 --> 01:37:30,030
They were here before
you came into my life.

1529
01:37:30,236 --> 01:37:32,534
How to manage them?
- You've a facility.

1530
01:37:32,739 --> 01:37:34,934
My grandma is blind and
my grandpa is deaf.

1531
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:36,403
l like your family.

1532
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:39,373
Your grandma is blind, your grandpa
is deaf and you're brainless.

1533
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,281
You're very lucky.

1534
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:46,145
Who are they?
- Friends.

1535
01:37:46,353 --> 01:37:47,445
My name is Sharat.

1536
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:50,282
You too have same name
like my foolish grandson.

1537
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,424
Why have you all come at a time?

1538
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:56,152
Bride's brother is coming
to meet Sharat.- ls it?

1539
01:37:56,396 --> 01:37:59,627
So you'll come here everytime
they come for you.

1540
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,994
Hey idiot!
- Granny, that side.

1541
01:38:02,202 --> 01:38:05,137
You don't say yes because
l'm blind and he's deaf.

1542
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:07,169
You're an average looking guy.

1543
01:38:07,374 --> 01:38:10,673
They may refuse seeing
so many handicaps here.

1544
01:38:10,877 --> 01:38:11,571
Right granny.

1545
01:38:11,778 --> 01:38:15,942
So sit straight before me
when l talk to them.

1546
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:17,810
Otherwise, my looks will not match.

1547
01:38:18,551 --> 01:38:22,078
l think they are here, come, let's go.
- What to do now?

1548
01:38:26,626 --> 01:38:28,218
You? What brings you here?

1549
01:38:28,428 --> 01:38:30,362
He's Sharat.
- Yes.

1550
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:33,098
l feel bad for what had happened.

1551
01:38:33,299 --> 01:38:34,266
You got confused little.

1552
01:38:34,467 --> 01:38:37,664
So l came to meet your family
and say sorry to you.

1553
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:38,667
Who is he?

1554
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:41,599
Sharat?
- He too is Sharat, my friend.

1555
01:38:41,808 --> 01:38:44,538
Confusion with identical people
and identical names.

1556
01:38:44,744 --> 01:38:46,769
lntroduce me to your family.
- Come.

1557
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:50,575
He's Gyaneshwar, Shravani's brother,
he came to say sorry for the incident.

1558
01:38:50,784 --> 01:38:52,809
Tell him to sit and say it,
it'll be clear.

1559
01:38:53,019 --> 01:38:54,714
Sharat, sit here.

1560
01:38:58,858 --> 01:39:01,725
l'm not saying because he's my grandson,
he's a thorough gentleman.

1561
01:39:01,928 --> 01:39:04,294
Devotee of Goddess.
- Yes, she's right.

1562
01:39:04,497 --> 01:39:06,488
Uncle!
Aunty!

1563
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:08,633
l brought a marriage proposal
for Sharat, didn't l?

1564
01:39:08,835 --> 01:39:10,200
lt's cancelled,

1565
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:14,464
it seems they abused our Sharat,
he told me unable to tell you.

1566
01:39:14,674 --> 01:39:16,733
Let it go, l'll get better ones.

1567
01:39:16,943 --> 01:39:19,138
Gopal Rao, you're short tempered,

1568
01:39:19,345 --> 01:39:21,336
bride's brother is here to say sorry.

1569
01:39:21,548 --> 01:39:25,678
Greetings Gopal Rao.
- Look before you say something.

1570
01:39:25,885 --> 01:39:27,477
What did l say now?

1571
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,480
By the way, who is he?

1572
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,151
ls he Sharat?
- He's also Sharat.

1573
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,920
Voice is different, where is he now?

1574
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:38,859
l must manage without
committing anything.

1575
01:39:39,065 --> 01:39:41,556
You got confused with
just identical names,

1576
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:45,829
l got shock of life with identical faces,
that's why l got it wrong.

1577
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:53,640
Sharat, l get an idea on seeing you.

1578
01:39:53,847 --> 01:39:56,441
lf you say yes, l'll find you
another good proposal.

1579
01:39:56,649 --> 01:39:59,641
What do you say?
ls it good on your part?

1580
01:39:59,853 --> 01:40:02,185
How can you talk about finding another
proposal when we are talking here?

1581
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:04,856
Shouldn't we see another proposal?
- You shouldn't.

1582
01:40:05,058 --> 01:40:06,025
Why not?

1583
01:40:06,226 --> 01:40:10,322
Come out, l'll tell you why not?
- Where are you taking me?

1584
01:40:10,563 --> 01:40:13,691
Can you bring a better proposal?
- Why are you pushing me?

1585
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:16,960
He's handsome and smart,
so l promised to get a better proposal.

1586
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:17,761
What's wrong in it?

1587
01:40:17,971 --> 01:40:21,532
Do you think we are software
engineers in suits?

1588
01:40:21,741 --> 01:40:24,710
What will you do?
- He's going overboard.

1589
01:40:24,911 --> 01:40:28,074
Take him and give him
a good thrashing.

1590
01:40:28,281 --> 01:40:30,215
He mustn't be seen
till marriage is over.

1591
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:32,618
What's happening here?

1592
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,579
Why are you sitting there
instead of here?

1593
01:40:35,788 --> 01:40:38,689
Change your positions.
- He's coming.

1594
01:40:39,759 --> 01:40:41,920
l talked and convinced Gopal uncle,

1595
01:40:42,128 --> 01:40:43,891
he asked us to fix the marriage.

1596
01:40:44,097 --> 01:40:46,224
What do you say, grandpa?
- As you say.

1597
01:40:46,432 --> 01:40:49,265
Do you always say it short?
- Yes.

1598
01:40:49,469 --> 01:40:50,595
Sharat, just a minute please.

1599
01:40:50,803 --> 01:40:52,634
Bye granny.
- Bye son.

1600
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:57,173
Why is your brother-in-law very close
with your friend than you?

1601
01:40:57,377 --> 01:41:01,905
Don't try to know everything at this age,
you may die in confusion.

1602
01:41:02,115 --> 01:41:03,309
That's right.

1603
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:05,417
What's this?

1604
01:41:05,652 --> 01:41:07,210
Open it, you'll know.

1605
01:41:11,124 --> 01:41:12,455
Who painted this?

1606
01:41:13,726 --> 01:41:14,715
MF Hussain?

1607
01:41:15,128 --> 01:41:16,060
Ravi Varma?

1608
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:18,627
Your brother-in-law.
- Who is he?

1609
01:41:18,831 --> 01:41:21,356
lt's me!
- You?!

1610
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,593
Unbelievable.

1611
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:29,432
See, he's an educated man,
so he knows the value of creation.

1612
01:41:29,642 --> 01:41:32,372
But that Bottu Seenu is
an uneducated goon.

1613
01:41:32,579 --> 01:41:34,137
You're talking a lot about Bottu Seenu,
who is that man?

1614
01:41:34,347 --> 01:41:36,372
He's not a man but manhole.

1615
01:41:37,317 --> 01:41:42,345
Bloody, cuts throats for money.
Obnoxious man!

1616
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:45,023
Please don't ask about that Satan
at this happy hour.

1617
01:41:45,225 --> 01:41:49,161
l must tell this to my sister, bye.
- Bye, be careful!

1618
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:56,635
See, both brother and sister
have played a trick on you,

1619
01:41:56,836 --> 01:41:57,632
and then dare to use
bad words also.

1620
01:41:57,837 --> 01:42:00,169
They started the drama
and l'll end it.

1621
01:42:00,373 --> 01:42:05,811
Both brother & sister must go mad
about identity confusion l'll create.

1622
01:42:06,512 --> 01:42:08,639
Bloody! How dare you lodge a
complaint with police against us.

1623
01:42:08,848 --> 01:42:11,840
Stake another 25 on Pakistan
also for safe side.

1624
01:42:12,685 --> 01:42:15,017
Do you want me to
settle the accounts?

1625
01:42:15,221 --> 01:42:17,382
Accounts?
Where will it go away?

1626
01:42:19,225 --> 01:42:21,659
Brother. Call his family, and ask them
to take him away. Go.

1627
01:42:21,861 --> 01:42:24,193
Give me Rs.50000.

1628
01:42:24,397 --> 01:42:27,059
You haven't settled old dues yet,
how can l lend you money everyday?

1629
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:28,666
Won't you?
- l won't!

1630
01:42:28,868 --> 01:42:32,668
Why should l live then?
l'll kill myself.

1631
01:42:32,872 --> 01:42:36,569
l'll give whatever you ask.
- l'm living to repay your loan.

1632
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:40,212
Take Rs.50000.
- l know you're generous, Das.

1633
01:42:40,413 --> 01:42:44,645
The day l find King,
l'll settle my entire loan.

1634
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:49,851
l'm sending Rs.50000,
stake 500/0 on each one.

1635
01:42:50,123 --> 01:42:52,023
How long should we have to bear him?

1636
01:42:52,225 --> 01:42:54,318
Can't avoid till we get back our money?

1637
01:42:58,965 --> 01:43:01,229
What happened?
- We found King!

1638
01:43:08,775 --> 01:43:12,370
What a great news!
ls my nephew in this city?

1639
01:43:12,578 --> 01:43:16,639
Find him quickly!
Das, take it as your loan is settled.

1640
01:43:16,849 --> 01:43:21,218
Let's celebrate it.
Have a party on my account.

1641
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:22,046
We must find him first.

1642
01:43:22,255 --> 01:43:26,555
Where will he go?
We'll surely find him.

1643
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,761
What's it, brother?
You're so happy.

1644
01:43:31,964 --> 01:43:33,829
How can l else be other than happy!

1645
01:43:34,267 --> 01:43:38,567
l thought Bottu Seenu was fooling
me with two identities.

1646
01:43:38,771 --> 01:43:40,762
Both are different people.

1647
01:43:40,973 --> 01:43:42,565
They are as different
as sky and earth.

1648
01:43:42,775 --> 01:43:45,437
l selected him to match our family.

1649
01:43:45,645 --> 01:43:52,448
So, let's fix marriage before he comes to
know about us. What do you say?

1650
01:43:52,652 --> 01:43:57,817
As you wish!
- Aunty, sister is feeling shy.

1651
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:16,165
Team Tolly

1652
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:23,774
Just a look is enough, O Adonis!

1653
01:44:23,983 --> 01:44:27,510
My pulse rate is racing...

1654
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:35,183
Know it, O handsome!
The desire of my heart...

1655
01:44:35,395 --> 01:44:38,922
Just a look is enough, O Aphrodite!

1656
01:44:39,132 --> 01:44:42,795
l can't hold it anymore...

1657
01:44:43,002 --> 01:44:50,773
l know it, O beauty!
The desire in your heart...

1658
01:44:50,977 --> 01:44:58,349
Unite me into you forever...

1659
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:06,151
Unite with me so that
we become as one...

1660
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:29,905
Team Tolly

1661
01:45:35,321 --> 01:45:42,750
What's the use of my youth
if it can't become yours?

1662
01:45:43,362 --> 01:45:50,234
Shall l write my name
with your lips?

1663
01:45:50,436 --> 01:45:53,963
lf clouds of love want
to shower on me...

1664
01:45:54,273 --> 01:45:58,175
How can l say no?

1665
01:45:58,544 --> 01:46:05,609
Shall l take this great beauty
into my arms?

1666
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:12,155
l wish to spend my life
with you...

1667
01:46:56,435 --> 01:47:06,401
Team Tolly

1668
01:47:12,585 --> 01:47:19,923
O beauty! l read your wishes...

1669
01:47:20,626 --> 01:47:26,496
Mischievous desires are gushing
and rushing towards you...

1670
01:47:27,867 --> 01:47:31,166
l've given myself to you...

1671
01:47:31,637 --> 01:47:35,164
Lost myself in you...

1672
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:42,346
Take everything from me,
l've opened myself to you...

1673
01:47:42,949 --> 01:47:50,014
May l explore the
unexplored in you...

1674
01:48:21,821 --> 01:48:24,119
Madam's horoscope is
like Goddess Seetha.

1675
01:48:25,091 --> 01:48:26,558
Sir's horoscope is
like Lord Rama.

1676
01:48:26,759 --> 01:48:29,057
Then, let's conduct their
marriage immediately.

1677
01:48:29,261 --> 01:48:31,729
The real problem is the auspicious
time is just an hour away only.

1678
01:48:31,931 --> 01:48:32,989
An hour only?

1679
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,724
ls marriage like going to
shop and buying sweets?

1680
01:48:35,935 --> 01:48:37,960
You asked suddenly and
l checked almanac immediately,

1681
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:38,966
auspicious time is fixed suddenly.

1682
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:41,969
How can l fix marriage in an hour?
Find another time.

1683
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,768
Then, fix another groom not this one.

1684
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:48,071
Have you gone mad? lf you say
anything l'll bash you up!

1685
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,078
Please madam don't get angry,
the problem is that,

1686
01:48:51,283 --> 01:48:54,309
if you don't get engaged now,
many a confusion will come,

1687
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:58,012
particularly to the groom and when
your sister delivers the first child,

1688
01:48:58,224 --> 01:48:59,486
it'll swallow the maternal uncle.

1689
01:48:59,692 --> 01:49:03,128
Am l any chocolate to swallow?

1690
01:49:03,929 --> 01:49:06,659
lt's bad omen to the uncle,
your life will be danger.

1691
01:49:06,866 --> 01:49:10,358
This man is aiming barrel at me!

1692
01:49:10,803 --> 01:49:12,498
Forget it, don't believe it.

1693
01:49:12,705 --> 01:49:14,570
l don't want to take chances,

1694
01:49:14,774 --> 01:49:16,503
shouldn't l be here to
take care of you?

1695
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:18,199
What's the time now?

1696
01:49:18,411 --> 01:49:19,708
You've already lost 5 minutes
in the countdown.

1697
01:49:19,912 --> 01:49:22,745
Already lost 5 minutes,
make arrangements quickly.- Yes boss.

1698
01:49:22,948 --> 01:49:25,508
You call Sharat here.
- Will he accept it?

1699
01:49:25,718 --> 01:49:29,415
lf you tell him the details,
he'll eat away the remaining time.

1700
01:49:29,622 --> 01:49:31,556
You call him here
narrating some tale,

1701
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:34,018
l'll take care of the rest.

1702
01:49:35,494 --> 01:49:39,863
Already 30 minutes over,
has that doubting Thomas left his office?

1703
01:49:40,066 --> 01:49:42,091
Why are you standing here
like a wall? Get lost!

1704
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:44,269
Brother, Sharat is here.

1705
01:49:45,805 --> 01:49:46,533
What's all this?

1706
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:48,604
He has started it,
give me your hand,

1707
01:49:48,808 --> 01:49:51,368
vow on Goddess, don't open your
mouth for next 30 minutes.

1708
01:49:51,577 --> 01:49:53,442
You've made a vow on Goddess.
Shut up!

1709
01:49:53,646 --> 01:49:55,011
Be silent, l'll tell you.

1710
01:49:55,414 --> 01:49:57,814
Priest saw your's and
my sister's horoscope,

1711
01:49:58,584 --> 01:50:00,677
he said if you both don't
get married in an hour,

1712
01:50:00,753 --> 01:50:04,120
you both will end in forest like
Lord Rama and Goddess Seetha.

1713
01:50:04,323 --> 01:50:05,950
Who is Satan here?

1714
01:50:06,525 --> 01:50:07,787
That Bottu Seenu.

1715
01:50:08,627 --> 01:50:13,758
l'm arranging this to keep that
bloody idiot out of our lives.

1716
01:50:15,267 --> 01:50:18,100
You're worried about
your family, right?

1717
01:50:18,304 --> 01:50:21,330
This is just for a formality,
let's invite all when we do it again.

1718
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:26,008
You've sworn on Goddess, you can't speak,
priest, groom is here.

1719
01:50:30,449 --> 01:50:31,381
Stop...

1720
01:50:34,186 --> 01:50:35,153
Come...come...

1721
01:50:35,354 --> 01:50:38,881
l've made him swear on Goddess
to keep silence,

1722
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:40,183
let's do it quickly.

1723
01:50:46,065 --> 01:50:46,997
Shut up!

1724
01:50:48,634 --> 01:50:51,501
Bride and groom say do
after finish the hymns.

1725
01:50:53,973 --> 01:50:56,168
Say do, not no.

1726
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,434
ls the groom deaf?

1727
01:50:58,878 --> 01:51:00,436
What would a deaf man do?

1728
01:51:00,646 --> 01:51:02,011
Saying yes in heart will do.

1729
01:51:02,214 --> 01:51:03,476
Then do it like that.
- As you say.

1730
01:51:04,984 --> 01:51:06,451
Say yes in your heart.

1731
01:51:07,486 --> 01:51:09,215
You can exchange rings now.

1732
01:51:09,989 --> 01:51:11,183
Give me.

1733
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:12,721
Wear it. Give me your hand.

1734
01:51:12,925 --> 01:51:16,861
Put the ring.
- lt's over.

1735
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:18,887
Put this ring to her.

1736
01:51:19,098 --> 01:51:21,566
Do it, auspicious time is elapsing.

1737
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:32,200
Team Tolly

1738
01:51:32,678 --> 01:51:34,942
lf he opens the mouth,
he'll kill me with his doubts.

1739
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:39,049
You both go out and enjoy.

1740
01:51:42,087 --> 01:51:43,748
lsn't she a Telugu girl?

1741
01:51:43,956 --> 01:51:47,585
Hindi girl who acts in Telugu films,
forget about girls and watch the film.

1742
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:51,661
He thinks we are software
company owners in suits.

1743
01:51:52,731 --> 01:51:54,596
No use in giving us
just a marriage feast,

1744
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,893
you must present us
with silk saris also.

1745
01:51:57,102 --> 01:51:59,434
You're ready to take
silk saris as gift,

1746
01:51:59,638 --> 01:52:02,266
but never bothered to find
a girl for me in 10 years.

1747
01:52:02,474 --> 01:52:05,910
What did l do?
- That Nizamabad girl was ravishing,

1748
01:52:06,111 --> 01:52:09,672
you said l'm a goon and marrying me
is like death and she refused me.

1749
01:52:09,882 --> 01:52:13,045
They wanted an intelligent boy,
you had brawn but no brains.

1750
01:52:13,252 --> 01:52:17,245
lf l had no brain,
would l've trapped Sharat easily?

1751
01:52:20,993 --> 01:52:22,255
Why did he come again?

1752
01:52:22,461 --> 01:52:24,691
Have you forgotten
anything to come back?

1753
01:52:24,897 --> 01:52:26,330
Coming again?
l'm coming now only.

1754
01:52:26,532 --> 01:52:27,897
Coming now? Where's Baby?

1755
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,533
Baby?
- My baby.

1756
01:52:29,735 --> 01:52:31,362
l'm coming now after getting
a call from your Baby.

1757
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:33,868
Who came earlier then?
- lt was Bottu Seenu.

1758
01:52:34,073 --> 01:52:36,439
His look alike, he was trying
to say something,

1759
01:52:36,642 --> 01:52:38,576
you played a trick and
made him shut up.

1760
01:52:39,078 --> 01:52:40,739
Sir, if you pay my fee,
l'll take leave.

1761
01:52:40,946 --> 01:52:44,347
l beg you, you come here,
you wait here.- Okay.

1762
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:46,881
l made a grave mistake.

1763
01:52:48,921 --> 01:52:52,152
You must get her married to the
man she's engaged now.

1764
01:52:52,358 --> 01:52:53,985
l'll strangle your neck.

1765
01:52:54,193 --> 01:52:56,252
He's just a henchman, should l get
my sister married to him?

1766
01:52:56,462 --> 01:52:58,726
l beg you, find a way out.
- There's a way out in the almanac.

1767
01:52:58,931 --> 01:52:59,454
What is it?

1768
01:52:59,665 --> 01:53:01,132
When the bride is not available,

1769
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:04,825
her brother can do it,
that means you can do it.

1770
01:53:05,037 --> 01:53:06,800
What are you doing here then?

1771
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:09,664
We both must get engaged quickly.

1772
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:12,503
l'm not like that.
- Am l like that then?

1773
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:13,643
According my family tradition,

1774
01:53:13,846 --> 01:53:15,370
l must get engaged
to my brother-in-law.

1775
01:53:15,581 --> 01:53:19,381
lf we don't do it in next 3 minutes,

1776
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:23,112
priest says you both will go to forest
like Lord Rama and Goddess Seetha.

1777
01:53:23,322 --> 01:53:24,414
Tell him l say.
- Yes...yes.

1778
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:26,280
Where is Shravani?
- Went to watch a film.

1779
01:53:26,492 --> 01:53:27,686
At this hour?

1780
01:53:27,893 --> 01:53:31,158
lt's a tradition that bride must watch a film
while engagement is going on.

1781
01:53:31,363 --> 01:53:33,160
You carry on.
- You sing a song.

1782
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:35,258
Leave me, what's this injustice?

1783
01:53:35,868 --> 01:53:36,596
lt's over...over...
- What's this?

1784
01:53:36,802 --> 01:53:37,826
What's this nasty?
A man putting a ring to another man?

1785
01:53:38,037 --> 01:53:40,198
This is our tradition, you put.

1786
01:53:40,406 --> 01:53:42,237
Okay, l'll.
- Put it.

1787
01:53:43,509 --> 01:53:44,669
Excellent!

1788
01:53:50,049 --> 01:53:53,450
Already 20 seconds past,
if l tell him l'll die.

1789
01:53:53,652 --> 01:53:55,643
lf l don't he'll die.
That's better!

1790
01:53:56,855 --> 01:54:01,417
l'm confused what's all this
nasty traditions and dancing?

1791
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:04,653
lt has just started,
you'll know it, don't worry.

1792
01:54:04,863 --> 01:54:07,388
Brother, Bottu Seenu is very cunning.

1793
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,430
l'm worried about Baby.
- Yes.

1794
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:13,230
Keep aside your doubts & go home,
we've to meet a person.

1795
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:15,737
Who?
- Satan!

1796
01:54:21,847 --> 01:54:25,214
Where did you go till now?
- l went out on an urgent work.

1797
01:54:25,851 --> 01:54:27,318
Sister mustn't know this.

1798
01:54:29,088 --> 01:54:30,453
Who are you man?

1799
01:54:31,857 --> 01:54:34,189
You? What are you doing here?
- Come out!

1800
01:54:35,794 --> 01:54:37,284
Come out...come out...

1801
01:54:39,665 --> 01:54:41,565
l'll come back in a minute.
- Where are you going again?

1802
01:54:42,868 --> 01:54:43,766
Come here.

1803
01:54:44,303 --> 01:54:48,171
Shouldn't you ask
what was happening there?

1804
01:54:48,374 --> 01:54:49,671
Shouldn't you reveal your identity?

1805
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:52,275
Wanted to use the situation
and trap my sister?

1806
01:54:52,478 --> 01:54:53,877
You never gave any chance to speak.

1807
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:55,011
You didn't brother.

1808
01:54:55,214 --> 01:54:55,942
l accept it was my mistake,

1809
01:54:56,148 --> 01:54:59,083
l got her engaged to you
instead of Sharat.

1810
01:54:59,284 --> 01:55:01,946
Engaged to me instead of him?
Are you drunk?

1811
01:55:02,554 --> 01:55:05,682
l don't drink in day time. lsn't it?
- Yes.

1812
01:55:05,891 --> 01:55:09,759
Sharat is your photocopy,
you know that?

1813
01:55:09,962 --> 01:55:11,930
With the exchange of rings,
our hearts too got exchanged,

1814
01:55:12,131 --> 01:55:13,223
l'm in love with your sister now,

1815
01:55:13,432 --> 01:55:16,367
can't change my heart as easily
as changing the ring?

1816
01:55:16,568 --> 01:55:20,060
l'll tell your sister that l'm Bottu Seenu,
problem will be over.

1817
01:55:20,272 --> 01:55:25,505
Don't do it, my sister is hard on surface
but very delicate on sensitive issues.

1818
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:28,874
Her heart will break if she comes
to know she's engaged to a goon.

1819
01:55:29,081 --> 01:55:31,914
l'll find a better bride for you
if you're interested.

1820
01:55:32,117 --> 01:55:34,051
You couldn't find one for yourself,
how can you find for me?

1821
01:55:34,253 --> 01:55:38,451
You promised 100/0 in Khairtabad,
l don't want that also.

1822
01:55:38,657 --> 01:55:40,955
Brother, what's this?
- You...

1823
01:55:41,427 --> 01:55:42,155
What do you say?

1824
01:55:42,361 --> 01:55:43,521
l'll say only one thing,

1825
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:46,755
engagement in Bottu family
is like half marriage over,

1826
01:55:46,965 --> 01:55:49,058
so l'll not leave your sister at any cost.

1827
01:55:49,968 --> 01:55:52,994
lf any Sharat comes to stop me,
l'll break his limbs,

1828
01:55:53,205 --> 01:55:56,038
make a biryani of it and
send it to your home.

1829
01:55:56,875 --> 01:56:00,072
Tell your sister to accept
Bottu Senu as her husband.

1830
01:56:05,884 --> 01:56:06,714
Brother!

1831
01:56:07,152 --> 01:56:07,948
What brings you here?

1832
01:56:08,153 --> 01:56:10,212
He's here because...
- l'll tell her.

1833
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:17,089
One of our aunt said newly engaged couple
mustn't go out, so l came for you.

1834
01:56:17,296 --> 01:56:18,854
What's this you've become
so superstitious?

1835
01:56:19,064 --> 01:56:20,929
We'll go out to shop and
come, you carry on.

1836
01:56:21,633 --> 01:56:22,600
No dear.

1837
01:56:24,002 --> 01:56:26,334
Calling you.
- Me?

1838
01:56:35,647 --> 01:56:38,673
lf Sharat comes to know this,
he may jump.

1839
01:56:39,318 --> 01:56:40,478
We must make an intelligent move.

1840
01:56:40,686 --> 01:56:43,120
No need of intelligence, boss.
Let's do it ordinarily.

1841
01:56:43,755 --> 01:56:47,953
You're straining yourself,
are you composing any tune, sir?

1842
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,457
l'm planning.
- What?

1843
01:56:49,661 --> 01:56:51,959
Planning to kill Bottu Seenu
and Gyaneshwar.

1844
01:56:52,164 --> 01:56:53,791
Looks like you're not satisfied
with what had happened,

1845
01:56:53,999 --> 01:56:55,466
no need to extend it.

1846
01:56:55,734 --> 01:56:56,962
You don't know what is revenge.

1847
01:56:57,169 --> 01:56:59,637
Why not? We saw it here recently.
- Shut up!

1848
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,638
My brain is filled with revenge,
l'm not able to create anything.

1849
01:57:04,843 --> 01:57:08,643
Why strain newly to create?
Let's buy CD's as usual.

1850
01:57:11,683 --> 01:57:12,650
l can understand your pain sir,

1851
01:57:12,851 --> 01:57:14,978
l know the pain of revenge as
a native of Rayalaseema,

1852
01:57:15,187 --> 01:57:17,655
l know few factionists
who are in the city now,

1853
01:57:17,856 --> 01:57:18,982
they will do it for you.

1854
01:57:19,191 --> 01:57:21,159
l don't want to waste your time
with my revenge story,

1855
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,327
what's your price to kill a man?

1856
01:57:22,528 --> 01:57:23,654
Price depends on the person.

1857
01:57:24,029 --> 01:57:24,927
He's the person.

1858
01:57:30,702 --> 01:57:31,999
Tell them it's my order.

1859
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:50,688
ls it any exhibition?
What do you want?

1860
01:57:52,224 --> 01:57:53,521
We want him.

1861
01:57:57,396 --> 01:57:59,364
ls it Bottu Seenu or Sharat?

1862
01:57:59,831 --> 01:58:00,957
Who is he?

1863
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:02,591
King!

1864
01:58:03,335 --> 01:58:03,858
King?

1865
01:58:05,003 --> 01:58:06,436
Where did he come from?

1866
01:58:06,805 --> 01:58:10,366
He came from Coimbatore.
Rajachandra Pratap Varma.

1867
01:58:10,676 --> 01:58:12,109
We came in search of him.

1868
01:58:20,752 --> 01:58:21,411
Brother.
- What?

1869
01:58:21,587 --> 01:58:24,055
Come aside for minute.
- Why are you taking me aside?

1870
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:28,386
Brother, in Nawab's family the mother
gave birth to triplets not twins.

1871
01:58:28,594 --> 01:58:30,619
This is the third...
- l got it, keep quiet.

1872
01:58:30,996 --> 01:58:33,396
Sharat, Seenu and King.

1873
01:58:33,832 --> 01:58:36,801
These fellows don't know there
are others here just like King.

1874
01:58:37,002 --> 01:58:40,733
Before they see Sharat,
if we handover Seenu to them,

1875
01:58:40,939 --> 01:58:44,397
my brother-in-law will be safe
and Seenu will die. Come on boys.

1876
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:47,078
Okay, if l give him to you,
yourjob is done,

1877
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:48,337
how would it benefit me?

1878
01:58:49,548 --> 01:58:52,346
He says Rs.1 lakh,
agree for Rs.2 lakhs, boss.

1879
01:58:52,718 --> 01:58:53,742
l'll pay Rs.100 lakhs.

1880
01:58:55,287 --> 01:58:58,154
Money isn't important,
you've come to me for the first time,

1881
01:58:58,357 --> 01:59:00,757
Yourjob will be done in 2 days.
Call me afterjob is done.

1882
01:59:00,959 --> 01:59:02,017
Bye. Come on boys.

1883
01:59:03,962 --> 01:59:06,590
Are they beasts?
No civic sense at all.

1884
01:59:07,299 --> 01:59:11,258
lf you promise to take it easy,
l'll tell you a shattering truth.

1885
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:11,936
Tell me brother.

1886
01:59:12,337 --> 01:59:17,274
By mistake l got you engaged to Bottu Seenu
who is a look alike of Sharat.

1887
01:59:17,476 --> 01:59:18,773
Brother?!
- Yes dear.

1888
01:59:19,411 --> 01:59:20,776
What actually had happened was...

1889
01:59:23,148 --> 01:59:25,446
Should l've to marry Bottu Seenu now?

1890
01:59:25,651 --> 01:59:28,848
Would l allow your life to ruin, dear?

1891
01:59:29,388 --> 01:59:31,788
lt's not a serious thing also,

1892
01:59:32,224 --> 01:59:35,455
it happened by mistake, priest says
it's not counted by almanac rules.

1893
01:59:35,827 --> 01:59:39,786
What should we do with Seenu?
- l've a plan for him.

1894
01:59:40,332 --> 01:59:42,527
You be alert, don't get drunk.

1895
01:59:42,768 --> 01:59:43,291
Sister.
- Brother.

1896
01:59:43,502 --> 01:59:46,960
You act like moving close with him.
We'll take care of the rest.

1897
01:59:49,174 --> 01:59:51,301
Brother-in-law is coming.
Come Seenu.

1898
01:59:51,576 --> 01:59:52,304
Why did you call me?

1899
01:59:52,511 --> 01:59:54,809
l and my sister have
come to a decision.

1900
01:59:55,013 --> 01:59:56,310
What are you looking at?
Tell him.

1901
01:59:56,515 --> 01:59:59,313
For good or bad,
l got engaged to you,

1902
01:59:59,685 --> 02:00:01,812
it's right to marry you.
- What about Sharat?

1903
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:05,148
l don't care about anyone
once my sister decides.

1904
02:00:05,357 --> 02:00:09,487
lt's our tradition to throw a feast for
brother-in-law after engagement.

1905
02:00:09,695 --> 02:00:11,663
What are you waiting for? Get it.
- Get it fast.

1906
02:00:11,863 --> 02:00:12,488
Get it.

1907
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:14,995
How neatly you've packed it!
- What is this?

1908
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,667
Drink it, you'll know it.
- You want me to?

1909
02:00:16,868 --> 02:00:17,493
lt's nectar.

1910
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:23,834
Drink it l say.

1911
02:00:29,147 --> 02:00:29,670

He gave me something to drink...

02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:46,790
l had few gulps...

1916
02:00:52,571 --> 02:00:58,976
Just for few pegs l'm going crazy...

1917
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:07,985
Just for few drops, stars from the
sky came down to earth...

1918
02:01:09,921 --> 02:01:19,887
Team Tolly

1919
02:01:22,868 --> 02:01:26,167
Charminar and Shah Alibanda

l wanted to enjoy but
my brain has gone bonkers...

1922
02:01:39,384 --> 02:01:45,516
What have you done to me?

1923
02:01:51,229 --> 02:01:54,130
You've made me crazy,
Yadagiri Narasimha...

02:04:54,679 --> 02:05:00,447
Let's go to Mumbai in a flight,

1936
02:05:00,652 --> 02:05:06,386
My brother fixed this marriage
floored by your valour...

1937
02:05:09,594 --> 02:05:11,221
He did a good job!

1938
02:05:51,369 --> 02:05:52,267
Look, they have brought him.

1939
02:05:52,904 --> 02:05:55,600
Das, your Rs.500 millions
are rolling in.

1940
02:05:56,474 --> 02:05:57,532
What's it you shorty?

1941
02:06:00,645 --> 02:06:03,443
Put him down.
- Open it.- Stop it.

1942
02:06:03,648 --> 02:06:06,116
l gave you information,
l've an obligation.

1943
02:06:06,317 --> 02:06:07,113
You want to open it.

1944
02:06:07,318 --> 02:06:09,786
No, l must take revenge
before he comes out.

1945
02:06:09,988 --> 02:06:12,957
How dare you beat me!
Who do you think l'm!

1946
02:06:13,158 --> 02:06:13,783
l'll stamp you out!

1947
02:06:13,992 --> 02:06:15,960
Enough! Why are you beating
a man in sack?

1948
02:06:16,161 --> 02:06:18,129
What are you watching?
Open it.

1949
02:06:28,339 --> 02:06:29,738
l would've died!

1950
02:06:29,941 --> 02:06:30,965
How come you're here?

1951
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:35,571
l told you to get him drunk and finish,
but you got drunk and tried to finish me?

1952
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:39,045
Who kicked me?
- That music director!

1953
02:06:40,118 --> 02:06:41,483
This short man?
- Yes brother.

1954
02:06:41,686 --> 02:06:43,813
You bloody rascal!

1955
02:06:44,022 --> 02:06:48,482
Please leave me brother!
- Nobody ever dared to touch me.

1956
02:06:49,527 --> 02:06:51,825
How dare you beat me!
- What's this drama? Where is King?

1957
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:55,158
Shut up! He's smart,
he escaped from us.

1958
02:06:55,533 --> 02:06:57,831
l'll personally get him,
come on boys.

1959
02:06:59,037 --> 02:07:00,834
You'll go out from here
only after he comes.

1960
02:07:01,973 --> 02:07:03,838
How dare you threaten me!

1961
02:07:06,144 --> 02:07:09,341
Have you drawn all your guns?
Are you crazy?

1962
02:07:09,647 --> 02:07:12,514
Would he come if you kill me?
Think over it using brain.

1963
02:07:13,585 --> 02:07:14,677
What are you saying?

1964
02:07:14,886 --> 02:07:16,353
l can't repeat it dear.

1965
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:19,522
l don't know how you do it,
bring him here.

1966
02:07:20,125 --> 02:07:23,720
Brother is in danger
for your lousy job.

1967
02:07:24,129 --> 02:07:27,360
When Bottu Seenu comes here,
l'll engage him with my talk,

1968
02:07:27,565 --> 02:07:29,931
one shot with this at an
opportune moment. That's it!

1969
02:07:30,568 --> 02:07:32,866
No blood or no death!
- Okay madam.

1970
02:07:33,071 --> 02:07:35,130
But the bloody idiot mustn't
get up for two hours.

1971
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:39,208
We don't know that technic, we'll beat him,
we don't mind if he lives or dies.

1972
02:07:39,410 --> 02:07:41,037
What else do you know then? Bloody!

1973
02:07:42,747 --> 02:07:46,205
He's coming, you all hide.
Run, huge like buffaloes.

1974
02:07:46,785 --> 02:07:48,548
Come fast...come fast.

1975
02:08:00,598 --> 02:08:03,066
Get him out, come.
- He's here!

1976
02:08:03,601 --> 02:08:04,568
You've come at the right time.

1977
02:08:04,769 --> 02:08:07,067
Brother, how dare they keep
you as hostage.

1978
02:08:07,338 --> 02:08:07,895
Let's settle it.

1979
02:08:08,106 --> 02:08:11,803
Settle? Are they humans to settle?
Beasts, l'll settle things with them.

1980
02:08:12,043 --> 02:08:13,442
You clam down.
Hey beard!

1981
02:08:15,847 --> 02:08:17,747
Here's your King,
do whatsoever you want to,

1982
02:08:17,949 --> 02:08:20,577
but l'm warning you, be careful,
he's very cunning and smart.

1983
02:08:20,785 --> 02:08:21,843
Give him to them.

1984
02:08:24,756 --> 02:08:27,748
With this ends trouble from Seenu.
- Yes brother.

1985
02:08:28,026 --> 02:08:30,927
Go, get the payment,
l want highest denomination only.

1986
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:35,929
Miss Shravani! Who are you guys?
Please leave me. What's this?

1987
02:08:36,134 --> 02:08:37,260
Miss Shravani?

1988
02:08:37,468 --> 02:08:39,868
Sir...where is the temple?
Where is the God?

1989
02:08:40,138 --> 02:08:40,604
Come!

1990
02:08:41,072 --> 02:08:42,767
Brother, l think he's Sharat.

1991
02:08:42,974 --> 02:08:44,942
Tell them to leave me,
l've to go to my office.

1992
02:08:45,143 --> 02:08:46,440
He says office,
it means he's Sharat.

1993
02:08:46,644 --> 02:08:47,611
What to do now?

1994
02:08:47,879 --> 02:08:53,044
Hey you stop!
- Miss Shravani!

1995
02:08:53,284 --> 02:08:55,479
Come without shouting.
- Stay here!

1996
02:08:55,987 --> 02:08:56,954
Aren't you satisfied with
what you gotjust now?

1997
02:08:57,655 --> 02:08:58,883
Who are you guys?

1998
02:09:01,226 --> 02:09:11,192
Team Tolly

1999
02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:14,128
Come King!

2000
02:09:14,772 --> 02:09:17,297
l beat your men for
calling me like that.

2001
02:09:17,508 --> 02:09:19,976
lf you call me King again,
l'll thrash you also.

2002
02:09:20,178 --> 02:09:23,909
l know you're not King.

2003
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:29,479
lf l place you in King's place
since you're his look alike.

2004
02:09:29,687 --> 02:09:31,655
All my problems will be solved.

2005
02:09:32,257 --> 02:09:35,886
So, you must impersonate
as King for few days.

2006
02:09:36,094 --> 02:09:36,992
Why should l?

2007
02:09:37,195 --> 02:09:38,719
l'll pay you Rs.100 millions.

2008
02:09:41,566 --> 02:09:43,591
l must like the job also
along with remuneration.

2009
02:09:44,035 --> 02:09:45,832
l'll support only if you're
on the justice side.

2010
02:09:46,037 --> 02:09:54,172
l'm on the justice side, l'm living
a dog's life amongst these wolves.

2011
02:09:55,013 --> 02:09:58,972
My nephew's money for good cause
has become noose to me now.

2012
02:09:59,384 --> 02:10:00,681
l can understand your dilemma,

2013
02:10:00,885 --> 02:10:03,854
what will happen to me
if King returns?

2014
02:10:04,055 --> 02:10:05,352
King's no more, he won't come.

2015
02:10:05,556 --> 02:10:07,285
Why will he not come?
- He's dead!

2016
02:10:07,725 --> 02:10:12,355
You promised to settle the loan after
finding King but now say he's dead.

2017
02:10:12,563 --> 02:10:13,860
Leave me.

2018
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:16,060
Will you spare me alive
if l say King is dead?

2019
02:10:16,267 --> 02:10:17,199
That's why l didn't tell you.

2020
02:10:17,735 --> 02:10:20,932
l got an opportunity with Seenu
to settle your loans.

2021
02:10:21,139 --> 02:10:21,798
That's why l'm telling you the truth.

2022
02:10:22,006 --> 02:10:24,201
What's the guarantee that
you're telling the truth?

2023
02:10:36,421 --> 02:10:38,981
He saw King die. Tell him.

2024
02:10:49,534 --> 02:10:55,404
l kept his death a secret
to keep his family safe.

2025
02:10:55,606 --> 02:11:00,669
lf you help us,
l'll catch King's killers also.

2026
02:11:01,479 --> 02:11:03,242
l liked your point as well
as your payment.

2027
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,254
Why did you come to the temple?

2028
02:11:11,456 --> 02:11:13,754
l told you l visit the temple
every Saturday.

2029
02:11:13,958 --> 02:11:16,586
As usual l came and some
bloody fool hit me from behind.

2030
02:11:16,961 --> 02:11:17,985
When l opened my eyes,
l'm here.

2031
02:11:18,196 --> 02:11:21,097
You're saying all that we know,
tell us what happened inside?

2032
02:11:21,299 --> 02:11:23,426
lt seems some King who
is my look alike,

2033
02:11:23,801 --> 02:11:25,769
they promise to pay Rs.100 millions
to impersonate him.

2034
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:26,937
l got scared.

2035
02:11:27,305 --> 02:11:28,431
You don't get scared, Sharat.

2036
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:32,097
Let's tell them he's Sharat not Seenu
and take him with us.

2037
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:35,507
Why are you also talking mad
like him? Use your brain.

2038
02:11:35,713 --> 02:11:38,614
They don't want Seenu or Sharat,
they want someone who looks like King.

2039
02:11:38,816 --> 02:11:39,441
What to do now?

2040
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:43,279
You act like King, l'll get Seenu
at right time to save you.

2041
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,785
Then l'll go to office
and apply for leave.

2042
02:11:44,989 --> 02:11:47,787
Stop! Have we come to watch a film?
They will not allows us to go.

2043
02:11:47,992 --> 02:11:48,959
Why not? What have we done?

2044
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:52,288
Explain to him.
- Actually, the problem is...

2045
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:57,460
Elderly man! Seenu is cunning man,
he'll cheat you & escape.

2046
02:11:57,668 --> 02:11:58,464
Why would he escape?

2047
02:11:58,669 --> 02:12:00,796
He loves my sister.
She's her weakness.

2048
02:12:01,005 --> 02:12:02,302
We'll take her also.

2049
02:12:02,507 --> 02:12:04,304
She too has a weakness.
- For her too? What is it?

2050
02:12:04,675 --> 02:12:06,142
My sister loves me very much.

2051
02:12:06,344 --> 02:12:07,402
She'll not go anywhere without me.

2052
02:12:07,845 --> 02:12:11,804
l'm worried about how to
fit him in Kings' place,

2053
02:12:12,016 --> 02:12:15,144
l'll give invitations and you can
come with an entourage.

2054
02:12:15,353 --> 02:12:19,221
You don't worry,
l've a great idea.

2055
02:12:45,316 --> 02:12:55,282
Team Tolly

2056
02:12:57,962 --> 02:12:59,827
Just by offering obsequies
to your dead father,

2057
02:13:00,131 --> 02:13:04,830
your father's soul will not rest in peace
who died in humiliation, Pooja.

2058
02:13:06,137 --> 02:13:09,436
There's another thing that you've to
do to make him rest in peace.

2059
02:13:10,141 --> 02:13:11,836
Only you can do it.

2060
02:13:21,219 --> 02:13:24,450
Deposit this Rs.20 lakhs cheque today.
- Yes madam.

2061
02:13:24,856 --> 02:13:29,452
Sister, we've searched
all the states for King,

2062
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,284
only three states remain
to be searched,

2063
02:13:31,496 --> 02:13:33,623
Haryana, Gujarat and
one more state with Ch...

2064
02:13:33,831 --> 02:13:35,298
Chattisgarh.
- Correct Chari.

2065
02:13:35,666 --> 02:13:39,124
l think giving newspaper ads
there will help us.

2066
02:13:39,504 --> 02:13:42,064
But it'll cost you Rs.2 lakhs.

2067
02:13:42,507 --> 02:13:43,974
Okay, do it.
- Thank God!

2068
02:13:44,175 --> 02:13:48,305
Chari, pay in cash to Kona.
- Okay madam.

2069
02:13:48,513 --> 02:13:51,641
l think God will be more helpful
than spending on media, sister,

2070
02:13:51,849 --> 02:13:57,412
so l've decided to offer free food
in all the temples of the state.

2071
02:13:57,855 --> 02:13:58,981
Sorry sister.
- Okay, do it.

2072
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:02,489
lt'll cost Rs.10 lakhs for doing it.

2073
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,158
Anybody would've second thoughts
for such big amount.

2074
02:14:05,696 --> 02:14:10,656
l'll not have it.
Because my King is priceless diamond.

2075
02:14:10,935 --> 02:14:15,497
Well said sister,
our King will come back definitely.

2076
02:14:21,979 --> 02:14:24,504
Appaji has come back!
- Father!

2077
02:14:24,715 --> 02:14:26,512
How dare of you to come back here!

2078
02:14:26,717 --> 02:14:30,175
Why are you silent?
How could you come after betraying sister?

2079
02:14:30,388 --> 02:14:36,725
Are you worried about missing King
or me coming back?

2080
02:14:36,928 --> 02:14:40,261
Don't trap us with your words,
we don't care if you live or die.

2081
02:14:40,498 --> 02:14:42,193
We are worried about missing King.

2082
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:45,961
Don't cry, l can feel your pain.

2083
02:14:55,413 --> 02:14:58,382
Nephew!
- What happened to you son?

2084
02:14:59,083 --> 02:15:00,948
What is this? Talk to me.

2085
02:15:01,185 --> 02:15:04,120
Sorry madam, he can't recognise anyone,

2086
02:15:04,522 --> 02:15:05,284
can't speak also.

2087
02:15:05,489 --> 02:15:06,319
What happened to my son?

2088
02:15:06,524 --> 02:15:08,048
Appaji would've done something.

2089
02:15:08,259 --> 02:15:10,386
Don't accuse him,

2090
02:15:10,595 --> 02:15:12,893
King met with an accident in Uttaranchal.

2091
02:15:13,931 --> 02:15:18,231
l'm Dr. Gyaneshwar Kale,
she's my sister Dr. Shravani Kale.

2092
02:15:18,436 --> 02:15:18,902
Greetings.

2093
02:15:19,103 --> 02:15:24,166
We were searching for herbs in the
forest when we heard human cries,

2094
02:15:24,342 --> 02:15:27,573
when we went to see,
we found your son on the verge of death,

2095
02:15:28,045 --> 02:15:31,913
we saved him with herbs and
were looking after him like an infant,

2096
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:36,409
suddenly this man recognised him
as nephew and brought us here.

2097
02:15:36,621 --> 02:15:42,253
l was worried about missing nephew,
another worry was living away from you all,

2098
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:46,760
l was searching in forest without
food or water, there l found him.

2099
02:15:46,964 --> 02:15:50,092
You don't look like a man fasting
but a gargantuan.

2100
02:15:50,301 --> 02:15:52,326
My body is like that.

2101
02:15:52,803 --> 02:15:56,933
Will my son become normal, doctor?

2102
02:15:57,141 --> 02:16:01,100
He'll definitely,
but he needs Art treatment.

2103
02:16:01,312 --> 02:16:02,609
Art treatment? What's that?

2104
02:16:02,813 --> 02:16:05,441
Yes, using tablets is English medicine,

2105
02:16:05,716 --> 02:16:07,445
Ayurveda is treating with natural herbs,

2106
02:16:07,652 --> 02:16:09,950
Art treatment is treating with arts.

2107
02:16:10,154 --> 02:16:15,717
You saved my son,
stay here till he's normal.

2108
02:16:15,926 --> 02:16:16,620
As you say madam.

2109
02:16:17,094 --> 02:16:19,790
We'll not go from here,
till your son moves.

2110
02:16:20,264 --> 02:16:23,358
Brother. Arrange for their stay.
- Okay, sister.

2111
02:16:24,068 --> 02:16:26,468
Come sir...come.
- Give way.

2112
02:16:27,672 --> 02:16:36,478
Trying to over ride me with your
Gudivada and Kakinada brains?

2113
02:16:36,681 --> 02:16:37,807
l'll rip out your skin.

2114
02:16:38,015 --> 02:16:41,974
Thanks Appaji, you saved Rs.12 lakhs
by bringing back King.

2115
02:16:42,186 --> 02:16:47,818
What you've seen now is nothing,
the real story begins from tomorrow.

2116

Team Tolly

2117
02:17:05,242 --> 02:17:14,776
Music has become my pulse
and beating as you in me...

2118
02:17:14,985 --> 02:17:25,623
Love is flowing out of me as music...

2119
02:17:25,996 --> 02:17:30,626
Kiss of love is seeding life into you...

2120
02:17:30,835 --> 02:17:35,295
Good times are upbeat
with great expectations...

2121
02:17:35,506 --> 02:17:39,966
Heart is blooming with divine music...

2122
02:17:40,411 --> 02:17:45,815
Music is blessing of God
creating sensation in heart...

Team Tolly

2124
02:18:08,973 --> 02:18:09,997
Tell me who is that?

2125
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:12,342
Mother!

2126
02:18:21,318 --> 02:18:22,512
Eldest uncle!

2127
02:18:24,889 --> 02:18:26,186
My sweet darling!

2128
02:18:27,825 --> 02:18:29,019
Who is this?

2129
02:18:30,895 --> 02:18:32,192
Gudivada uncle!

2130
02:18:37,334 --> 02:18:38,358
Kakinada uncle!

2131
02:18:53,017 --> 02:19:02,983
Team Tolly

2132
02:19:18,476 --> 02:19:23,038
l'll make them believe Seenu is the King
and settle your loans. Okay?

2133
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:23,837
This is your last chance.

2134
02:19:24,048 --> 02:19:26,915
You'll say like that only. Bye.

2135
02:19:27,184 --> 02:19:29,311
Appaji, l can't play this
drama anymore.

2136
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:31,249
l feel l may become invalid
sitting in that wheel chair

2137
02:19:31,455 --> 02:19:35,755
l can't bear Gyaneshwar's horrible paintings,
and his sister's terrible songs.

2138
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:39,288
No way, l'm leaving.

2139
02:19:39,864 --> 02:19:43,425
Don't do it, l'll see that you're
normal by tomorrow.

2140
02:19:43,634 --> 02:19:45,329
The last dose of Art treatment
begins today.

2141
02:19:45,736 --> 02:19:52,835
Do as l say closing your eyes to ward off
evil and any hitch in the treatment.

2142
02:19:55,579 --> 02:20:04,612
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Open your eyes now.

2143
02:20:10,661 --> 02:20:11,628
Who are you?

2144
02:20:11,829 --> 02:20:14,127
l'm Jayasurya,
creative music director,

2145
02:20:14,832 --> 02:20:17,801
l'm the chief of this art treatment.

2146
02:20:18,669 --> 02:20:19,567
Am l not?

2147
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:22,295
Yes madam, he's my Guru.
- Greetings.

2148
02:20:22,506 --> 02:20:24,804
What have l taught you and
what you're doing here?

2149
02:20:25,009 --> 02:20:26,977
Will you come to the climax
without following any order?

2150
02:20:27,177 --> 02:20:27,973
We did follow order.

2151
02:20:28,178 --> 02:20:29,975
Which order did you follow? Tell me.

2152
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:31,647
Kalyani raga must bring back legs,

2153
02:20:31,849 --> 02:20:32,816
Keeravani raga must bring back joints.

2154
02:20:33,017 --> 02:20:35,986
Which raga will cure diabetes?
ls it so powerful?

2155
02:20:36,086 --> 02:20:38,213
You're forgetting an important thing
with your half knowledge.

2156
02:20:38,522 --> 02:20:41,980
What is it, Guru?
- Sense of touch.

2157
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:45,685
The last raga must be tried only when
patient has lost sense of touch.

2158
02:20:46,297 --> 02:20:51,200
lf there's any trace of it, the treatment
may leave him invalid for life.

2159
02:20:51,402 --> 02:20:54,860
l don't have any sense of touch.
- l must test and decide it.

2160
02:20:55,072 --> 02:20:56,198
Where is going?

2161
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,047
You go back little.

2162
02:21:12,423 --> 02:21:13,151
Feel it?

2163
02:21:14,992 --> 02:21:16,550
You go back.
- Okay.

2164
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:20,563
Feel it?
- No.

2165
02:21:20,764 --> 02:21:21,389
No?

2166
02:21:27,204 --> 02:21:28,728
Feel it?
- No feeling at all!

2167
02:21:29,006 --> 02:21:31,167
l feel he's taking revenge
instead of treating him.

2168
02:21:37,047 --> 02:21:38,912
You're crying! That means
you can feel the touch.

2169
02:21:39,116 --> 02:21:43,576
Not crying Guru but tears ofjoy for
your attention and love for me.

2170
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:49,657
He says no feeling at all,
let's start the last treatment.

2171
02:21:51,028 --> 02:21:51,926
What's the time now?

2172
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:54,256
lnauspicious time!

2173
02:21:54,632 --> 02:21:56,759
lf you do good things at bad time,

2174
02:21:56,967 --> 02:21:59,094
patient will get well but
doctor will become a patient.

2175
02:21:59,303 --> 02:21:59,928
Have you forgotten it?

2176
02:22:00,137 --> 02:22:01,263
We forgot it in tension.

2177
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:03,269
Art treatment will not work in tension.

2178
02:22:03,641 --> 02:22:05,438
Let's start tomorrow at auspicious time.

2179
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:12,612
You must understand an artiste's anger.
l'll make you understand it.

2180
02:22:16,854 --> 02:22:18,788
l'm dead! Bloody bas...

2181
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:20,790
He beat me black and blue, mother f....

2182
02:22:21,325 --> 02:22:26,786
l must kick that son of a b...
He bashed me up.

2183
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:30,292
Only l know it's pain. Bloody f...
Stupid idiot!

2184
02:22:31,402 --> 02:22:32,960
Why are you talking like Bottu Seenu?

2185
02:22:34,104 --> 02:22:36,299
What can l do?
l don't know any bad words,

2186
02:22:36,507 --> 02:22:39,135
l heard it someone using
these bad words. l copied it.

2187
02:22:39,343 --> 02:22:43,473
You brother and sister watched the fun,
never tried to stop him also.

2188
02:22:43,681 --> 02:22:44,648
Look, how black it has turned.

2189
02:22:44,848 --> 02:22:45,974
l can understand your pain,

2190
02:22:46,183 --> 02:22:48,151
l'll tell my brother to cut that
short man to his size.

2191
02:22:48,352 --> 02:22:52,482
Just few slaps up and down and
he'll go to the dogs, bloody idiot!

2192
02:22:52,690 --> 02:22:53,816
Bloody street mongrel!

2193
02:22:54,024 --> 02:22:55,423
Why are you speaking in local lingo?

2194
02:22:55,626 --> 02:22:59,153
Cursing makes me lose
control over language.

2195
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:04,258
That's better. carry on.

2196
02:23:04,601 --> 02:23:07,331
l did re-recording for many
revenge films in my career,

2197
02:23:07,538 --> 02:23:10,336
the kick or punch we get after taking
revenge is something out of the world.

2198
02:23:10,541 --> 02:23:11,337
You got the revenge, let's go.

2199
02:23:11,542 --> 02:23:14,841
How can l? Still Gyaneshwar is there
who made me stand in hot sun to paint.

2200
02:23:15,045 --> 02:23:16,012
Then...
- Then?

2201
02:23:16,213 --> 02:23:17,510
That singer.
- Guru!

2202
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:23,683
Despite my busy schedule,
l'm here for Shravani.

2203
02:23:26,724 --> 02:23:27,691
What?
- There!

2204
02:23:29,393 --> 02:23:33,955
Oh Gyani! As fellow artiste
l'm giving you a chance.

2205
02:23:34,832 --> 02:23:37,699
lf you give your sister to me
and fall on my feet,

2206
02:23:38,168 --> 02:23:40,636
l'll leave this place,
think it over, the choice is yours.

2207
02:23:41,371 --> 02:23:51,337
Team Tolly

2208
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:54,718
How dare you think of my sister!

2209
02:23:54,918 --> 02:23:56,783
l beg you sir, please leave me.

2210
02:23:57,755 --> 02:24:00,053
Fold your hands, l'll spare your life.
- Okay sir.

2211
02:24:01,091 --> 02:24:01,989
Do it Guru.

2212
02:24:02,192 --> 02:24:05,320
Fold your hands, l'll spare your life.
- My hands are not moving.

2213
02:24:05,596 --> 02:24:08,326
He beat his legs,
why are you breaking his hands?

2214
02:24:08,532 --> 02:24:10,159
You keep quiet, don't fuel to fire.

2215
02:24:10,434 --> 02:24:11,560
He took revenge, right?

2216
02:24:11,769 --> 02:24:14,567
Why are you shouting?
Brother, break his legs.

2217
02:24:16,607 --> 02:24:17,574
Look how he has come.

2218
02:24:17,775 --> 02:24:21,074
You broke it simple like sugar cane,
what's the technic?

2219
02:24:21,278 --> 02:24:25,078
This is known as leg lock,
must use it very carefully,

2220
02:24:25,682 --> 02:24:28,014
or else he may become
impotent for life.

2221
02:24:28,786 --> 02:24:31,084
Brother-in-law, l'll try on this leg.
- Try it, it's all yours.

2222
02:24:31,288 --> 02:24:31,754
Thanks brother-in-law.

2223
02:24:31,955 --> 02:24:35,083
He says he's new, please you do it.

2224
02:24:35,292 --> 02:24:38,420
Can anyone become a doctor
without killing few patients?

2225
02:24:38,629 --> 02:24:40,096
He's very enthusiastic,
let him do it.

2226
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,595
You do it...
- Take rest now.

2227
02:24:42,966 --> 02:24:44,991
Good landing.
- Guru, are you still there?

2228
02:24:45,235 --> 02:24:45,758
l'm still there.

2229
02:24:45,969 --> 02:24:51,430
Great! You used the technic
perfectly the first time.

2230
02:24:51,642 --> 02:24:53,610
Why are you leaving me
in this condition?

2231
02:24:53,811 --> 02:24:55,438
Would l be in this condition all my life?

2232
02:24:55,646 --> 02:25:00,208
You'll be fine when you get the
shock of the life, till then enjoy it.

2233
02:25:00,751 --> 02:25:03,379
What's my position now?

2234
02:25:03,654 --> 02:25:07,613
You went for her and become an invalid.
- You stop it.

2235
02:25:08,292 --> 02:25:10,692
Like a snake charmer dies
from snake bite,

2236
02:25:11,228 --> 02:25:14,959
Art doctor has become
a patient of art treatment,

2237
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:22,862
After two pegs doctor tried the last
treatment on King and it backfired.

2238
02:25:23,073 --> 02:25:24,540
lt left him in this state.

2239
02:25:24,741 --> 02:25:27,972
Who is worried about him?
First see that King walks.

2240
02:25:28,178 --> 02:25:32,547
Auspicious time is also elapsing,
start the final treatment song.

2241
02:26:23,533 --> 02:26:25,831
Don't help him,
let him do it himself.

2242
02:26:26,370 --> 02:26:29,828
Son!
- Be careful!

2243
02:26:32,876 --> 02:26:34,343
Mother, l can walk.

2244
02:26:39,716 --> 02:26:44,085
Brother! What's this magic of losing legs and
getting it back like in mythological films?

2245
02:26:44,554 --> 02:26:46,351
l can't understand his looks.

2246
02:26:47,824 --> 02:26:48,449
Mother...

2247
02:26:49,493 --> 02:26:50,221
Brother...

2248
02:26:50,494 --> 02:26:51,961
Why has he come all of a sudden?

2249
02:26:52,162 --> 02:26:54,892
What should l do now?
- Who is he?

2250
02:26:55,098 --> 02:26:56,224
Your brother.
- My brother?

2251
02:26:56,833 --> 02:26:57,458
King's brother.

2252
02:26:57,668 --> 02:27:00,034
You have to handle the situation carefully.
- Keep watching.

2253
02:27:00,671 --> 02:27:01,137
Mother.

2254
02:27:02,839 --> 02:27:04,807
Why have you come here
all of a sudden?

2255
02:27:05,409 --> 02:27:07,240
l wanted to see you all.
So, l've come.

2256
02:27:07,444 --> 02:27:07,967
Where is my brother?

2257
02:27:08,178 --> 02:27:09,577
Chinna...
- Brother...

2258
02:27:10,013 --> 02:27:14,143
How are you?
- You must be very fine.

2259
02:27:14,351 --> 02:27:14,817
Yes master.

2260
02:27:15,018 --> 02:27:15,484
Go up.
- What?

2261
02:27:15,686 --> 02:27:16,311
Who are they?

2262
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:18,988
After you went to London,
your brother met with an accident.

2263
02:27:19,189 --> 02:27:20,816
They brought him home safe.
- Accident?

2264
02:27:21,024 --> 02:27:22,821
Why didn't you inform me?
- l'm very fine now.

2265
02:27:23,093 --> 02:27:24,321
Why have you landed here
all of a sudden?

2266
02:27:24,528 --> 02:27:25,495
l wanted to give you all a surprise.

2267
02:27:39,376 --> 02:27:42,345
Pooja, she is my mother.
- Greetings.

2268
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:45,347
My brother.
- Greetings.

2269
02:27:45,716 --> 02:27:47,741
Greetings.
Who is she?

2270
02:27:48,118 --> 02:27:49,517
l know her even before
going to London.

2271
02:27:49,886 --> 02:27:52,354
Mother, if you agree,
she will be your daughter-in-law.

2272
02:27:53,056 --> 02:27:55,024
You knew that we won't go
against your wish.

2273
02:27:55,225 --> 02:27:56,522
That's why you brought her home.

2274
02:27:57,828 --> 02:27:58,692
Lakshmi...
- Yes

2275
02:27:58,895 --> 02:28:01,523
Give her the traditional welcome.

2276
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:13,366
Team Tolly

2277
02:28:17,414 --> 02:28:18,210
Come in.

2278
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:30,819
We have no use of this dummy
who's acting like King.

2279
02:28:31,461 --> 02:28:35,056
We've to kill King's brother
soon and move out.

2280
02:28:46,476 --> 02:28:47,408
What can l do?

2281
02:28:47,611 --> 02:28:48,908
He's not able to move from here.

2282
02:28:49,112 --> 02:28:50,079
Find someone else.
Hang the phone.

2283
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:51,304
Sai Kishore...
- Yes.

2284
02:28:51,515 --> 02:28:52,914
Call Gopi Mohan.

2285
02:28:53,116 --> 02:28:55,744
Stop ordering me like this.
Do l look like an auto driver to you?

2286
02:28:55,952 --> 02:28:56,976
What do you have to do with him?

2287
02:28:57,187 --> 02:28:59,917
l've got an idea to finish
Gyaneshwar & his gang.

2288
02:29:00,123 --> 02:29:01,590
Even though he broke your limbs,
you haven't reformed.

2289
02:29:01,792 --> 02:29:04,590
So what? l have my mouth
to take revenge.

2290
02:29:04,795 --> 02:29:05,921
Do you want to lose that too?

2291
02:29:06,129 --> 02:29:09,758
You'll see whether l will lose my mouth
or will make you run away from here?

2292
02:29:09,966 --> 02:29:14,164
You said you made King vanish.

2293
02:29:14,371 --> 02:29:15,599
How did he come back?

2294
02:29:16,139 --> 02:29:17,436
l don't understand.

2295
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:19,165
l'll explain that to you.

2296
02:29:33,557 --> 02:29:34,546
Hey Appaji!

2297
02:29:34,891 --> 02:29:38,452
Have you replaced the King
with a fake man?

2298
02:29:38,662 --> 02:29:42,120
He has planned to usurp
all his wealth

2299
02:29:42,332 --> 02:29:45,460
l didn't tell you to memorise it.
Let's go & teach him a lesson.

2300
02:29:45,669 --> 02:29:48,137
Hey Bottu Seenu,
with the help of Appaji,

2301
02:29:48,338 --> 02:29:50,806
you became the King and fooled us.

2302
02:29:51,007 --> 02:29:52,975
Are you drunk?
l'm the King.

2303
02:29:53,176 --> 02:29:54,143
lf you were the King,

2304
02:29:54,344 --> 02:29:59,145
an unforgettable incident occurred between
you & me when you were 10.

2305
02:29:59,349 --> 02:30:00,213
Tell me what it is.

2306
02:30:02,519 --> 02:30:04,885
On your thread ceremony,
your father gave you a gift.

2307
02:30:05,088 --> 02:30:05,986
Tell me what was that.

2308
02:30:07,691 --> 02:30:10,319
Hey you guys, he is not King.

2309
02:30:10,527 --> 02:30:13,496
Call the police and
they will put them all in jail.

2310
02:30:36,153 --> 02:30:37,450
Why are you staring at us?

2311
02:30:48,698 --> 02:30:50,188
When l was 10 years old,

2312
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:54,200
you fell on my feet pleading me
not to expose your theft.

2313
02:30:55,972 --> 02:30:57,200
l still remember.

2314
02:31:00,076 --> 02:31:04,206
You asked me what was the gift
my father gave me on thread ceremony.

2315
02:31:11,588 --> 02:31:15,217
This knife.
- Slowly master.

2316
02:31:17,861 --> 02:31:19,294
Do you know why he gave me this?

2317
02:31:20,263 --> 02:31:22,891
To hunt down beasts like you.

2318
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,060
Why did you kill me? Tell me.

2319
02:31:27,604 --> 02:31:29,231
Why did you kill me?

2320
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:34,399
Gopi Mohan, you said you did
something. Tell him.

2321
02:31:36,346 --> 02:31:41,511
l'm not a murderer.
l said so to have control over him.

2322
02:31:44,955 --> 02:31:47,253
You're looking very dull.
Didn't you sleep last night?

2323
02:31:47,457 --> 02:31:50,255
l felt like someone sitting
on my chest.

2324
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:51,927
And since morning,
l have an headache.

2325
02:31:52,128 --> 02:31:53,595
lt happens in old buildings like this.

2326
02:31:53,797 --> 02:31:55,594
You will get used to it.
Don't worry.

2327
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:58,429
Please come & have breakfast.

2328
02:31:58,635 --> 02:32:00,762
No. We will eat later.
- l said come.

2329
02:32:02,806 --> 02:32:05,036
Today is the end of King's brother.

2330
02:32:06,876 --> 02:32:07,843
Have your breakfast, uncle.

2331
02:32:08,144 --> 02:32:09,611
lt's alright if l don't eat.

2332
02:32:09,813 --> 02:32:12,111
Das is sitting outside the gate.

2333
02:32:12,315 --> 02:32:13,612
lf l don't give him money, he'll kill me.

2334
02:32:13,817 --> 02:32:17,275
lf you could get me Rs.1 crore
from your mother,

2335
02:32:17,487 --> 02:32:20,285
l'll throw that on his face and
keep his mouth shut.

2336
02:32:20,590 --> 02:32:23,024
Good morning brother.
- Good morning. Sit.

2337
02:32:59,195 --> 02:33:01,493
Go inside & get me money.

2338
02:33:02,966 --> 02:33:03,898
Slowly...

2339
02:33:05,035 --> 02:33:08,334
Drink the juice.
- Why are you refusing?

2340
02:33:23,219 --> 02:33:23,844
Son...

2341
02:33:25,221 --> 02:33:27,951
Leave her.
- Brother, what are you doing?

2342
02:33:28,158 --> 02:33:34,688
Why did you come here?
- Tell me. Tell me.

2343
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:39,630
Leave her.
- Hey, what are you doing?

2344
02:33:39,836 --> 02:33:42,703
Tell me.
- Son...

2345
02:33:47,577 --> 02:33:49,875
What happened? Brother...
- What happened?

2346
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:50,876
What happened, mother?

2347
02:33:51,147 --> 02:33:56,050
Sometimes, the medicines
take control of his body.

2348
02:33:56,252 --> 02:33:57,879
This is just a result of that.
- Doctor, what's wrong with my son?

2349
02:33:58,088 --> 02:33:59,555
You don't have to worry.

2350
02:33:59,756 --> 02:34:02,122
Let him take rest and
everything will be fine.

2351
02:34:02,325 --> 02:34:03,383
Take him with you.

2352
02:34:04,027 --> 02:34:04,891
Come my son.

2353
02:34:05,428 --> 02:34:09,057
Gyaneshwar, he pushed me down,

2354
02:34:09,366 --> 02:34:12,824
lifted such a big table,
tried to crush her neck.

2355
02:34:13,002 --> 02:34:14,401
Has he gone mad?

2356
02:34:14,604 --> 02:34:17,573
lt wasn't him who did this.
- Did you do this?

2357
02:34:17,907 --> 02:34:22,003
l'll show you who does this tonight.

2358
02:34:25,115 --> 02:34:28,710
l know about you, Gyani.
You can't sleep without drinks.

2359
02:34:28,918 --> 02:34:31,853
So, you're spinning some ghost story
and keeping us for your company.

2360
02:34:32,055 --> 02:34:33,682
l too feel the same.

2361
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:35,585
You will understand.

2362
02:34:39,462 --> 02:34:43,091
Show me. You said something.
What's in there?

2363
02:34:43,299 --> 02:34:45,767
Don't make any noise.
Just see there.

2364
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:59,375
Listen to what l say.

2365
02:34:59,749 --> 02:35:01,808
The one you are seeing now
is not Bottu Seenu.

2366
02:35:02,018 --> 02:35:03,485
lt's the King who has possessed him.

2367
02:35:03,686 --> 02:35:05,881
There is no more King.
He is dead.

2368
02:35:07,524 --> 02:35:10,152
To take revenge on those
who killed him,

2369
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:12,487
the King's spirit which roams
round this palace

2370
02:35:12,695 --> 02:35:15,323
has possessed Bottu Seenu
who's his look alike.

2371
02:35:16,132 --> 02:35:19,829
ln the afternoon, when you were
busy eating on the dining table,

2372
02:35:20,036 --> 02:35:21,901
l was concentrating on Seenu.

2373
02:35:22,539 --> 02:35:27,772
When Swapna came,
l noticed a change in Seenu's behaviour.

2374
02:35:27,977 --> 02:35:31,743
What did you see?
- l saw his eyes turning red.

2375
02:35:31,948 --> 02:35:34,075
Why is King angry with the girl
who is going to marry his brother?

2376
02:35:34,284 --> 02:35:38,618
May be he is against inter caste marriage.
There could be other reasons also.

2377
02:35:39,222 --> 02:35:44,023
l made them believe that those were
the side effects of the treatment.

2378
02:35:44,327 --> 02:35:51,199
After referring to the books written
by Sigmund Freud on ghosts,

2379
02:35:51,401 --> 02:35:52,026
l got a clarity.

2380
02:35:52,235 --> 02:35:54,362
What you say is like the story
of the film Chandramukhi.

2381
02:35:56,406 --> 02:35:59,534
Even movies are made based
on real life stories.

2382
02:36:01,678 --> 02:36:05,045
Look, Bottu Seenu has fully
turned into King.

2383
02:36:05,982 --> 02:36:11,045
But Seenu is not aware that he is
being possessed by the spirit of King.

2384
02:36:11,254 --> 02:36:13,051
Should he have to come on
him only, that too now?

2385
02:36:13,256 --> 02:36:15,554
l've a treatment for this problem.

2386
02:36:16,759 --> 02:36:33,074
An amulet with blessings of Lord Hanuman
after years of penance.

2387
02:36:36,546 --> 02:36:40,573
As long as this is with him,
no evil spirits can touch him.

2388
02:36:43,453 --> 02:36:50,086
He must have this on him all the time.

2389
02:36:56,633 --> 02:36:57,827
According to his horoscope,

2390
02:36:58,034 --> 02:37:00,525
once he gets over his bad time,
his marriage is on the cards.

2391
02:37:01,070 --> 02:37:04,437
So, performing his marriage
soon is good for him.

2392
02:37:04,641 --> 02:37:08,338
Just tie the amulet & leave.
Why talk unnecessary things?

2393
02:37:08,645 --> 02:37:12,103
Where will he find a suitable
girl all of a sudden?

2394
02:37:12,315 --> 02:37:15,773
A suitable girl for him
is in this house.

2395
02:37:16,886 --> 02:37:19,116
Who is she?
- Shravani.

2396
02:37:22,992 --> 02:37:24,857
What do you say, doctor?

2397
02:37:25,061 --> 02:37:27,621
l've nothing to say.
lt's up to her.

2398
02:37:27,997 --> 02:37:29,055
What do you say?

2399
02:37:31,067 --> 02:37:32,125
l'm very happy.

2400
02:37:34,571 --> 02:37:35,538
Brother...
- Yes.

2401
02:37:35,738 --> 02:37:38,138
Find the auspicious day for
the engagement.- Okay.

2402
02:37:38,341 --> 02:37:42,141
lt is an auspicious function taking
place in this palace after a long time.

2403
02:37:42,512 --> 02:37:45,879
So, invite everyone to the function.

2404
02:38:02,732 --> 02:38:12,698
Team Tolly

2405
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:28,080
You're ready...l'm ready...
and the music band is also ready...

2406
02:38:28,291 --> 02:38:32,751
Date is fixed... place is ready...
let's marry happily...

2407
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:47,099
Crazy dreams in eyes are ready...
Desires in heart are ready...

2408
02:38:47,310 --> 02:38:51,770
My love, flowers are also ready...

2409
02:38:51,981 --> 02:38:56,441
Henna designs on hand are ready...
Sparkling cheeks are ready...

2410
02:38:56,653 --> 02:39:01,955
O moon! Place is ready
for you in my heart...

2411
02:39:30,253 --> 02:39:40,219
Team Tolly

2412
02:39:53,876 --> 02:39:58,279
You seem to be so near...
but you are far...

2413
02:39:58,548 --> 02:40:03,178
Don't run away from me
and tease me...

2414
02:40:03,386 --> 02:40:05,354
You come after me...

2415
02:40:05,555 --> 02:40:07,682
Asking me how long will you be away?

2416
02:40:07,890 --> 02:40:13,522
Look around, the distance between us
for few more days only...

2417
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:18,190
You weren't like this till yesterday...
Don't become indifferent suddenly...

2418
02:40:18,401 --> 02:40:22,861
Tie the knot and
l'm all yours...

2419
02:40:23,072 --> 02:40:25,199
Son-in-law, why are you rushing?

2420
02:40:25,408 --> 02:40:27,376
Don't fall prey to
pangs of separation...

2421
02:40:27,577 --> 02:40:32,378
When so many are around,
you can't romance in public...

2422
02:41:25,401 --> 02:41:35,367
Team Tolly

2423
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:46,778
When l see you draped in sari...
l'll ward off evil eye cast on you...

2424
02:41:46,989 --> 02:41:51,790
l'll desire and wish for you and
take you into my arms...

2425
02:41:51,994 --> 02:41:56,124
Tie the knot with me
and l'll shed my pride...

2426
02:41:56,332 --> 02:42:01,964
l'll give up myself to you
and enjoy life...

2427
02:42:02,171 --> 02:42:06,801
lf you say like that
l'll make every day a bliss...

2428
02:42:07,009 --> 02:42:11,469
l'm waiting...
l'll become a part of you...

2429
02:42:11,681 --> 02:42:15,981
We'll celebrate the event and
get you married in near future...

2430
02:42:16,185 --> 02:42:21,987
Play the marriage band,
ravel in festivities...

2431
02:43:36,666 --> 02:43:38,725
The impersonator is becoming
a hurdle for everything.

2432
02:43:39,335 --> 02:43:42,168
l'll take care of the impersonator.

2433
02:43:42,538 --> 02:43:44,403
King's brother must die tonight.

2434
02:43:46,442 --> 02:43:50,071
Baba, we can't trust girls fully.

2435
02:44:42,298 --> 02:44:44,095
Hey...who are you guys?

2436
02:46:26,402 --> 02:46:27,460
He fight too well.

2437
02:46:30,005 --> 02:46:33,907
Wow Sharat! You're beating them to pulp.

2438
02:46:34,110 --> 02:46:35,475
Sharat is not so brave.

2439
02:46:35,678 --> 02:46:37,475
Then, you are...- Bottu Seenu.

2440
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,808
Bottu Seenu...?
What happened to my Sharat?

2441
02:46:41,016 --> 02:46:42,984
He left once l came here.

2442
02:46:43,619 --> 02:46:47,146
Planning to fool me & get
your sister married to him.

2443
02:46:47,356 --> 02:46:49,984
lf you don't get your sister married
to me on the same day,

2444
02:46:50,259 --> 02:46:52,887
Sharat who escaped will die.

2445
02:46:56,265 --> 02:47:01,498
Shravani...get up.
- What's it brother?

2446
02:47:02,037 --> 02:47:03,504
Why did you disturb my good sleep?

2447
02:47:03,873 --> 02:47:07,502
You can sleep later.
But your life is about to get disturbed.

2448
02:47:07,710 --> 02:47:08,506
What happened?

2449
02:47:08,711 --> 02:47:12,841
Since Bottu Seenu has entered this house,
Sharat has left this place.

2450
02:47:13,048 --> 02:47:13,514
What now?

2451
02:47:13,716 --> 02:47:15,843
We have nothing to do with this guy.
All we need is Sharat.

2452
02:47:16,051 --> 02:47:19,020
Wait for the right time & let us
also escape. Pack our bags.

2453
02:47:19,221 --> 02:47:20,415
Okay brother.

2454
02:47:42,745 --> 02:47:46,112
My life is in danger but you're busy
in your marriage arrangements.

2455
02:47:46,315 --> 02:47:50,979
lf you don't get me money somehow,
Das will kill me.

2456
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:55,550
What are you staring at?
There is an amulet tied to your hand.

2457
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:59,557
Oh God!

2458
02:48:06,969 --> 02:48:16,435
Team Tolly

2459
02:48:25,221 --> 02:48:26,313
Why did you come here?

2460
02:48:26,956 --> 02:48:28,514
Why did you come again?

2461
02:48:29,358 --> 02:48:33,761
Why do you want to kill my brother?
Who are you?

2462
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:36,425
Tell me. Who are you?

2463
02:48:37,299 --> 02:48:39,426
Leave me.
- Tell me.

2464
02:48:40,970 --> 02:48:42,437
Leave her.
Have you gone mad?

2465
02:48:43,272 --> 02:48:46,105
Brother, she is here to
ruin our family.

2466
02:48:46,308 --> 02:48:51,439
l know that you're Bottu Seenu.
- No. l am king.

2467
02:48:54,149 --> 02:49:00,782
King died long back.
l got him killed.- Why?

2468
02:49:00,990 --> 02:49:02,457
To get rid of him.

2469
02:49:04,393 --> 02:49:06,725
People call me as King's brother.

2470
02:49:07,263 --> 02:49:09,288
The world doesn't know my name also.

2471
02:49:10,232 --> 02:49:12,564
Even if l win, the credit goes
to the King.

2472
02:49:13,002 --> 02:49:14,060
King is everything.

2473
02:49:14,937 --> 02:49:16,564
So, l wanted to be the king.

2474
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:19,307
So, l got him killed.

2475
02:49:19,675 --> 02:49:22,906
Now you've come here as King and
acting as king to mint money.

2476
02:49:23,545 --> 02:49:25,638
Tell me how much you want.
l will give you.

2477
02:49:26,248 --> 02:49:27,715
Just leave this place right now.

2478
02:49:38,027 --> 02:49:39,153
Who are you guys?

2479
02:49:39,361 --> 02:49:42,660
Before knowing who we are,
you need to know a lot of things.

2480
02:49:43,365 --> 02:49:46,493
Many tried to kill King.
None could succeed.

2481
02:49:46,969 --> 02:49:48,061
But you killed him.

2482
02:49:50,105 --> 02:49:52,005
You killed the faith king had in you.

2483
02:49:52,207 --> 02:49:56,507
You killed his affection for you.
But you couldn't kill the King.

2484
02:49:57,713 --> 02:50:00,739
Killing King is notjust tough
but impossible.

2485
02:50:02,051 --> 02:50:03,177
Don't you understand.

2486
02:50:03,385 --> 02:50:06,843
Knowing that his only brother whom he
loved so much had tried to kill him,

2487
02:50:07,056 --> 02:50:10,514
and one who is in
unbearable pain is King.

2488
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:15,363
Rajachandra Pratap Verma.

2489
02:50:17,533 --> 02:50:20,195
l know him very well.
He is Bottu Seenu & not King.

2490
02:50:20,469 --> 02:50:24,371
There can be men of same characteristics.
But a man like him is just one.

2491
02:50:26,742 --> 02:50:31,042
King's body guard Munna's real name
is Bottu Seenu. He is my son.

2492
02:50:32,181 --> 02:50:35,309
After knowing that a plot has been
planned in his house to kill him,

2493
02:50:35,517 --> 02:50:37,212
he made you all believe
that he is dead,

2494
02:50:37,619 --> 02:50:41,055
and came back here as Bottu Seenu
to find out the killer.

2495
02:50:43,826 --> 02:50:46,989
When he knew that it was you,
he is really dead.

2496
02:50:49,598 --> 02:50:55,230
Boss, Pooja is none other than the daughter
of our ex-employee Ranga Rao.

2497
02:51:02,845 --> 02:51:04,813
Bhagat Sait who couldn't destroy
your family directly,

2498
02:51:05,114 --> 02:51:07,742
used Pooja's revenge to
demolish this family.

2499
02:51:07,950 --> 02:51:09,918
So, Pooja trapped your
younger brother.

2500
02:51:12,721 --> 02:51:14,086
Why should l marry you?

2501
02:51:14,890 --> 02:51:17,154
You depend on your brother
for everything.

2502
02:51:18,627 --> 02:51:19,924
What if there is no King at all?

2503
02:51:20,129 --> 02:51:24,429
Pooja, if King hadn't come here on time,
you would've killed his younger brother.

2504
02:51:26,468 --> 02:51:28,595
He would've killed you too.
Tell her.

2505
02:51:29,638 --> 02:51:32,106
Yes, Bhagat Sait told me
to kill you too.

2506
02:51:33,876 --> 02:51:37,937
Pooja, to protect my family's honour,

2507
02:51:38,814 --> 02:51:42,443
l couldn't say anything on that
day regarding your father.

2508
02:51:43,385 --> 02:51:46,115
By the time l came to your house
to seek his forgiveness,

2509
02:51:46,822 --> 02:51:48,619
he had committed suicide.

2510
02:51:49,258 --> 02:51:54,389
l handed over the responsibility
to your aunt to bring you up

2511
02:51:54,830 --> 02:51:56,957
and made all the
necessary arrangements.

2512
02:51:57,566 --> 02:51:59,397
But l never let you know that.

2513
02:51:59,868 --> 02:52:03,395
Because l knew that
what l did wasn't a favour.

2514
02:52:04,339 --> 02:52:08,469
For the injustice done to you,
you've the right to kill me even now.

2515
02:52:09,578 --> 02:52:11,808
But Ajay is no way related
in this matter.

2516
02:52:14,183 --> 02:52:18,586
Father made me King and
what he gave me wasn't power.

2517
02:52:18,854 --> 02:52:19,752
lt was responsibility.

2518
02:52:20,289 --> 02:52:24,589
l wanted to give you all that l missed
in my life because of responsibility.

2519
02:52:25,694 --> 02:52:28,162
l treated your education as mine.

2520
02:52:28,697 --> 02:52:30,494
l treated your victory as mine.

2521
02:52:31,633 --> 02:52:34,659
l was never your brother.
l was like your father.

2522
02:52:35,704 --> 02:52:38,172
l thought that l was giving
all that you needed.

2523
02:52:39,374 --> 02:52:41,433
But l failed to know your wishes.

2524
02:52:45,547 --> 02:52:47,515
Ever since astrologer predicted
danger for me,

2525
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:50,280
mother never had a peaceful sleep.

2526
02:52:50,953 --> 02:52:52,853
lf she comes to know that
you are my danger,

2527
02:52:53,856 --> 02:52:55,118
she wouldn't bear that truth.

2528
02:53:00,062 --> 02:53:00,528
Brother...

2529
02:53:03,565 --> 02:53:05,863
Sorry brother.

2530
02:53:06,068 --> 02:53:09,526
What you did wasn't a small
mistake to be pardoned.

2531
02:53:16,845 --> 02:53:19,040
Father, l've completed all
my commitments.

2532
02:53:19,481 --> 02:53:21,381
But l couldn't keep all of them happy.

2533
02:53:21,917 --> 02:53:25,284
l've only one choice to make
them all happy.

2534
02:53:25,654 --> 02:53:27,383
l must go far away from here.

2535
02:54:17,139 --> 02:54:18,936
Your mother has left this house.

2536
02:54:19,141 --> 02:54:19,869
Uncle...?

2537
02:54:22,144 --> 02:54:24,544
She told you not to look out for her.

2538
02:54:25,581 --> 02:54:28,778
Here is the wealth, fame & everything.

2539
02:54:28,984 --> 02:54:31,452
From now on, you're the King
of this palace.

2540
02:54:34,323 --> 02:54:37,622
She also wanted to convey
something to you all.

2541
02:54:37,826 --> 02:54:40,624
She was strict towards you all not
because of any revenge.

2542
02:54:41,063 --> 02:54:42,860
But to protect you from
falling into difficulties.

2543
02:54:44,433 --> 02:54:49,132
To look after her sisters-in-law properly,
she has equally shared the wealth to you all.

2544
02:54:51,173 --> 02:54:52,231
Surprised?

2545
02:54:52,841 --> 02:54:55,071
l forget everything even if
a small glass breaks.

2546
02:54:55,277 --> 02:54:57,302
Are you surprised how l could
remember all these things?

2547
02:54:57,679 --> 02:54:59,078
We can forget if glass breaks.

2548
02:55:00,015 --> 02:55:01,573
lf heart breaks, we cannot forget.

2549
02:55:03,652 --> 02:55:06,280
Date: September 18, 2008
Location: Temple

2550
02:55:07,022 --> 02:55:09,490
l wonder where & how my Sharat is.

2551
02:55:09,791 --> 02:55:11,656
Make sure he comes back to us soon.

2552
02:55:15,864 --> 02:55:17,729
Prayers are answered immediately here.

2553
02:55:17,933 --> 02:55:20,493
Sharat...
- Brother-in-law...you?

2554
02:55:21,370 --> 02:55:22,837
Where did you go without
even informing us?

2555
02:55:23,038 --> 02:55:24,335
Bottu Seenu threatened me.

2556
02:55:24,539 --> 02:55:25,836
l got scared & went to
my grandma's place.

2557
02:55:26,041 --> 02:55:27,338
Your cowardice saved your life.

2558
02:55:27,542 --> 02:55:30,943
What coward? l won't spare him.
l'll file a complaint with police.

2559
02:55:31,146 --> 02:55:32,773
What complaint can you lodge
on someone who is gone?

2560
02:55:32,981 --> 02:55:34,505
Gone where?
- To hell.

2561
02:55:34,883 --> 02:55:36,407
Look, that's Bottu Seenu's father.

2562
02:55:36,885 --> 02:55:39,285
He'll not be able to bear the
news of his son's death.

2563
02:55:39,554 --> 02:55:43,854
Be kind hearted & whenever you've time,
meet him & act like Seenu.

2564
02:55:44,059 --> 02:55:45,526
l cannot.
- Why?

2565
02:55:45,827 --> 02:55:48,853
What can l say?
l saw King's mother in the train.

2566
02:55:49,064 --> 02:55:51,089
l thought like you and
acted like her son.

2567
02:55:51,299 --> 02:55:52,789
Now you want me to act like Seenu.

2568
02:55:53,001 --> 02:55:55,526
How many characters can a man do?
l'm not a movie star.

2569
02:55:55,737 --> 02:55:58,706
Nothing wrong in doing any number of
characters for a good thing to happen.

2570
02:55:58,907 --> 02:56:00,875
Then, l will ask Shravani.
Where is she?

2571
02:56:01,076 --> 02:56:04,534
Sharat, you went missing suddenly.
l really got tensed.

2572
02:56:04,746 --> 02:56:08,045
Shravani, l want to tell you a truth.
l'm not Sharat.

2573
02:56:08,583 --> 02:56:09,641
Then?
- King.

2574
02:56:12,821 --> 02:56:14,550
Kittu, do you know why l'm leaving you?

2575
02:56:14,756 --> 02:56:17,554
l must know every plan of Bhagat Sait.

2576
02:56:25,100 --> 02:56:28,228
Swapna's name, all other details are fake.

2577
02:56:28,437 --> 02:56:30,735
How did you appoint her in
our company so foolishly?

2578
02:56:30,939 --> 02:56:32,406
On seeing your recommendation letter.

2579
02:56:33,442 --> 02:56:36,411
l had signed these blank letter
heads & kept it in a safe.

2580
02:56:36,611 --> 02:56:39,239
Which means that there is
someone in my house...

2581
02:56:39,715 --> 02:56:41,512
The one who attacked you
is Bhagat Sait's man.

2582
02:56:41,717 --> 02:56:45,585
But l couldn't find out the details
of the girl who shot you.

2583
02:56:45,787 --> 02:56:48,255
Your day to day program details
are on Bhagat Sait's table.

2584
02:56:48,457 --> 02:56:49,583
Even your Uttaranchal Trip.

2585
02:56:49,791 --> 02:56:52,089
l doubt that someone in your house
is trying to help Bhagat Sait.

2586
02:56:53,128 --> 02:56:54,925
Munna, listen carefully.

2587
02:56:55,130 --> 02:56:57,360
l started this drama with
the help of Munna.

2588
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:03,867
Get inside fast.
Police are after you.

2589
02:57:04,673 --> 02:57:07,233
l found out that my eldest uncle is
not connected with this plot.

2590
02:57:07,476 --> 02:57:09,273
l entered into this palace
with his help.

2591
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:16,946
l also found out that other 2 uncles too
are also not connected to this plot.

2592
02:57:17,819 --> 02:57:27,785
Team Tolly

2593
02:57:29,664 --> 02:57:32,292
To give my brother his
most desired post,

2594
02:57:32,667 --> 02:57:35,636
l made everyone believe that l am dead,
and later came here.

2595
02:57:39,174 --> 02:57:40,471
What's it Kittu?
What is the matter?

2596
02:57:40,675 --> 02:57:43,143
Bhagat Sait gave me money to plant
a bomb in your brother's car.

2597
02:57:43,345 --> 02:57:45,905
What did you do?
- l planted it in his car.

2598
02:57:47,916 --> 02:57:49,315
Kittu, is the job done?

2599
02:57:49,518 --> 02:57:51,918
Bhagat Sait, l warned you before

2600
02:57:52,354 --> 02:57:55,323
that if you think about my family members,
l will be forced to think about you.

2601
02:57:55,524 --> 02:57:56,491
Who are you?
- King

2602
02:58:04,199 --> 02:58:04,665
l'm coming.

2603
02:58:04,866 --> 02:58:07,835
Since you were worried about
Sharat for the past 2 days,

2604
02:58:08,036 --> 02:58:09,663
l didn't tell you the good news.
- What is it?

2605
02:58:09,871 --> 02:58:13,068
You know that l love his
sister Parijatham, don't you?

2606
02:58:13,275 --> 02:58:14,003
Yes, l know.

2607
02:58:14,209 --> 02:58:16,336
You also know that she
put me to test, right?

2608
02:58:16,545 --> 02:58:17,170
Yes, l know.

2609
02:58:17,312 --> 02:58:20,873
He has passed me with full marks.

2610
02:58:21,149 --> 02:58:23,014
Brother...
- Don't be surprised.

2611
02:58:23,218 --> 02:58:25,015
l didn't pass him because
his painting was good.

2612
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:26,847
l couldn't see his paintings everyday.

2613
02:58:27,389 --> 02:58:29,016
Let me talk.

2614
02:58:29,291 --> 02:58:31,521
Let our marriages
be on the same day.

2615
02:58:31,726 --> 02:58:33,887
What do you say, Sharat?
- As you say.

2616
02:58:34,129 --> 02:58:37,223
When Gyaneshwar's sister is
getting married to Bottu Seenu,

2617
02:58:37,332 --> 02:58:40,529
how should the marriage be?
- Twin cities should celebrate.

2618
02:58:40,735 --> 02:58:44,865
He thinks you're Bottu Seenu.
lnnocent guy.- Yes.

2619
02:58:45,073 --> 02:58:48,873
Let's perform their marriage
as fixed earlier.

2620
02:58:49,411 --> 02:58:52,869
We have to buy saris & jewels for
my daughter-in-law.- Okay mother.

2621
02:58:53,181 --> 02:58:57,880
She thinks you're the King.
- She is innocent.

2622
02:58:58,086 --> 02:59:00,145
Hey Sharat...
- Why did you call me like that?

2623
02:59:00,355 --> 02:59:01,549
Not you. Him.

2624
02:59:02,090 --> 02:59:03,990
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

2625
02:59:04,192 --> 02:59:04,988
Why did you come here?

2626
02:59:05,193 --> 02:59:06,160
l didn't know that you'll be here.

2627
02:59:06,361 --> 02:59:07,623
Sharat...
- Yes.

2628
02:59:07,829 --> 02:59:08,887
He is calling me not you.

2629
02:59:09,097 --> 02:59:11,395
Tell me.
- lnvite your friend to the marriage.

2630
02:59:12,167 --> 02:59:14,226
Heard what he said.
l'll kill you if you come to the marriage.

2631
02:59:15,670 --> 02:59:19,401
My grandfather says l'm useless.
But l am of great use to you.

2632
02:59:20,375 --> 02:59:24,744
Sharat, hereafter you have to act
like 3 people & satisfy them.

2633
02:59:24,946 --> 02:59:25,913
l wonder how you're going
to do that.

2634
02:59:26,114 --> 02:59:27,741
You're telling him as
if he is very new to this.

2635
02:59:28,116 --> 02:59:29,242
He is used to all that.

2636
02:59:30,619 --> 02:59:32,587
Why does he say ''used''?
