00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,415
Who are you waiting for?

3
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:12,374
Go...go...go...
go pushing yourself....

4
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,874
It will be impossible forever,
if it's not possible now...

5
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,749
It will be similar to nothing
even if you are here...

6
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:11,749
Every day there is some
deficiency throughout the life...

7
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,165
And that is the place for success...

8
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:23,040
Every day there is some
deficiency throughout the life...

9
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,749
Without which there wilI
be no place for tomorrow...

10
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,040
Saying that this is not sufficient...

11
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,749
lt is achieving something here...

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,999
Witness the tomorrow
through today's dreams...

13
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:33,749
Fight and make yourself
efficient to win every day...

14
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:39,415
Put your indelible signature
on the time...

15
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:45,249
Saying that the time will stop
where you stop...

16
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:57,540
Start your story now itself
which studies earth...

17
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,749
Ramulu - Sircilla

18
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,499
Eggs develop and transform
into caterpillar.

19
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,374
Caterpillar will transform
into butterfly.

20
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,874
Eggs develop and transform
into caterpillar.

21
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,207
It's known as pupa stage.

22
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,957
PateI has called you,
why didn't you come, Ramulu?

23
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,874
I said I'd come.
- When wiIl you come?

24
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,082
Don't you know you
must repay the loan?

25
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,582
Patel said he'd not keep quiet
if you don't pay interest.

26
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,207
We repaid the principle, didn't we?

27
00:04:54,375 --> 00:05:00,499
Why are you opposing, Padma?
Tell whatever you want with PateI.

28
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:05,374
Hey old man! if you don't
come with money,

29
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,332
I'll come and drag you
myself, bIoody.

30
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,582
Come...come...long time no see.

31
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,624
I'm not here for self, Rathamma.
Tell her.

32
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,624
I want Saroja.

33
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,999
It seems he saw Saroja on terrace
while going this side.

34
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:31,624
He has been yearning for Saroja.
Stopped eating and studying.

35
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,499
Unable to bear it anymore,
his father sent him with me.

36
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,707
If anyone sees our girl,
he'll be Iike this only.

37
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,374
Saroja is attractive and in demand,
so will cost you Rs.5000.

38
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,207
I feel it's too much.
- Pay Rs.500, I'II come.

39
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,457
I want Saroja.

40
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,582
Keep quiet, the young bull
may get frightened.

41
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,707
Look Rathamma...
- Nothing less.

42
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,499
Rs.2000 for other girls
and Rs.5000 for Saroja.

43
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,874
Fixed prices.
- Okay.

44
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,207
Call Saroja.

45
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,707
What?

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,874
Saroja - Amalapuram

47
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,332
Don't get scare, boy.

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,374
Like warning is printed on
cigarette pack,

49
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,374
stiII they sell it,
this is also like that only.

50
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,624
This is not good for heaIth
but it's a business.

51
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,374
You start...

52
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:31,457
What do you know to like me...

53
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:37,249
What do you think about the human body...

54
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,874
It is after aIl pure leather...

55
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,749
That contains 9 doors...

56
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,374
Human body is heinous one...

57
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,249
And it is purely a temporary one...

58
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:53,124
What is the result for you
to desire this one...

59
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,874
Why did you desire the
company of this girl...

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,749
Poor boy!

61
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,249
How long will you sit Iike that?

62
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,332
Why did you come here then?

63
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,249
Who is it?
- It's me Karpooram.

64
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,999
Koti's phone, stilI not yet over?
- Not yet begun. Tell me.

65
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:48,499
Youth of Hyderabad have gone mad
seeing your body and shape.

66
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,499
Wait Koti. Hey, close your ears.
Tell me

67
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:57,124
For 31st night, two young men,

68
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:57,957
Good show.

69
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,207
New year...new business...

70
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,374
Can l vacate this place now?
- Then what? What will you do there?

00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,957
Pack your bags and come here.

00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,832
We'll leave tonight,

You give a slip to Rathamma.

74
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,832
New weapon.

75
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,999
This will be the last night here.

76
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,332
l think she has frightened him.
Frightened him?

77
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,457
How much did he pay?
- Why?

78
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,874
You've taken Rs.5000 and
pay me just Rs.1000 only.

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,749
You mean...?

80
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,957
Ra.1000 for getting crushed and
Rs.4000 for doing noting.

81
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,624
You've learnt to ask accounts.

82
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,124
We are not living on your hard work.

83
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,915
Many families depend on me.

84
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,790
Police, pleaders, goons,
l've to give them all a cut,

85
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,790
if not l can't run this company.

86
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,540
Isn't it my blood that you
distribute to others?

87
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,624
Why are you arguing with me?

88
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,790
lf I send few students,
they'll burn your face.

89
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,874
Send them Iet me see.
- Why will I not?

90
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,915
Why are you arguing with Rathamma?

91
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,124
Leave her sister.

92
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,790
She doesn't know anything,
I'Il expIain her.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,749
Tell her, I've invested in her since
her mother died, I'll take it back.

94
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,790
We are packing bags and leaving

But I can't stay in this country.

Let bygones be bygones,
past is over.

107
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,624
We must forget it.

108
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,124
Only few times in life
we forget the past.

109
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,624
Not always.

110
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,165

00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,165
Bloody life!
Didn't hear it, did she?

174
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,874
Where the hell did you come from?

175
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,165
Watch out, you may slip.

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,374
Listen to me.

177
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,249

Hey dude! I need your bike.

184
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,540
Last time you left the tank dry.

185
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,540
This time l'll fill up the tank,
l swear on you.

186
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,249
One can trust anyone in this worId but
not a friend who promises to fill petroI.

187
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,165
My specs!

188
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,624

189
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,540

190
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,624

Stop...stop for a minute.

193
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,124
Bloody beanpole!
You'll get bitten by a dog.

194
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,290
Why did they runaway
from me, cowards?

195
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,290
Not cowards but smart guys.
- How about you then?

196
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,874

00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,874

You get down.

201
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,124
Buddy, be carefuI, that's Masthan's bike.

202
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,040
Ifwe strike ofzeroes,

203
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,415
50 x 2 = 100,

204
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,915
100 x 10 = 1000,

205
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,290
...is equal to 1000.

206
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,790
Sir, the interest is 1000.

207
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:14,790
Sit down.

208
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,790
Did you see how easily he did it?

209
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,249
Now the sixth problem,
who will solve it now?

210
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,540
I'll do it sir.

211
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,415
Can't anyone else do it? Fools!

212
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,249
Lick his armpit, you'll get sense.

213
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,790
Who is Ramulu's grandson here?

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,999
Are you Ramulu's grandson?
Come!

215
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,540
Who are you?
What have you got to with him?

216
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,790
We don't have anything,
Butchi Reddy PateI wants him.

217
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:35,915
Will you also come with him?

218
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,540
Mother...mother...
- Don't shout.

219
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,665
Why is the work not going on fast?
Do it quickly.

220
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,374
The load must Ieave by evening.

221
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,040
Brother, RamuIu is coming.

222
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,624
Hey Ramulu! Why are you coming furiously?
To fight?

223
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,124
What's the matter?

224
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,874
Do l've guts to fight you, Patel?

225
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,624
You're talking too much.
Did you bring my money?

226
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,332
Will you settle the due?
Get the accounts.

227
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,957
Patel, I paid the principle amount fully.

228
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,999
Now I've to pay interest only,
if it's ten or twenty,

229
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,999
if you give me 6 months,

230
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,374
What ten or twenty?
The interest is Rs.50000 now.

231
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,832
Check the accounts.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,082
PIease listen to me, Patel.

233
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,374
Then, how would I get my money?
- Your mother.

234
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,749
Mother...mother....

235
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,374
My son Seenu!

236
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,999
Did you eat anything?
How have you become?

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,957
You had to face this
because of us, son.

238
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,582
Can this boy repay the loan, sir?

239
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,082
Please leave him, Patel.

240
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,457
Who will repay the loan then?

241
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,249
I told you to wait for 6 months, sir.

242
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,957
I'll not wait for 6 months or 3 months,

243
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,124

I'll send him to work in
city construction sites.

247
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,499
10 years...he'll be with us

248
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,999
Sir...he's a school going kid.

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,874
Take the boy away.

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,499
The more we cry,
the more they laugh at us.

252
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,707
Let's pay his money and
take back our boy.

253
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,499
Song is very good, who wrote it?

254
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,624
TilI now we used to perform

255
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,124

Fridge to keep people.

263
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,999
Would they keep peopIe in fridges too?

264
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,457
The dead are kept in it,
give me a hand.

265
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,499
A big shot is dead on Road No: 13,

266
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,207
they are going to keep it
for two days.

267

ln our coIony body cremated

268
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:46,332
But when weaIthy die, they keep
it fridges like this for days.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,124
You need money in death too.

270
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,624
Bloody life!

271
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,124

Recently bought it in Flamingo.

277
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,874
While the world is following me...

278
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,124
Why am I following you...

279
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:30,457
You did something to take me
to heaven in seconds...

280
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,499
How did you drown me...

281
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,374
l'm looking at you,
doing everything...

282
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,499
Never mind...

283
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,999
l'll put an end to your game...

284
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:24,832
I'Il take risk and
loot you completeIy...

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,499
I'm your property,
why would you wish to loot it, then?

286
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,749
Please listen to me.

287
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,249
He's coming from Canada to meet you.

288
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,957
Mom, I'm not coming.

289
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,374
You're coming to the party tomorrow.

290
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,957
Always like this, never consults me.

291
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,707
What happened?
- Some Siddarth is coming from Canada.

292
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,249
New Year party is in MI,
I must meet him there.

293
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,457
What shall we do?

294
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,124
Let's do one thing,
let's go to the party.

295
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,999
What if your mother dislikes me?

296
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,832
Why would she dislike you?

297
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,499
You're well educated.
You're very rich. What else?

298
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:30,832
You're right.

299
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,624
Mom has no one else other than me.
I'Il convince him.

300
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,957
What if he still rejects me?

301
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,332
l'll announce it.

302
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,624
What will you announce?

303
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,249
Then?

304
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,832
Then, you'll get locked. Even if you refuse,
she'll get me married to you.

305
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,832
Okay baby, as you wish.

306
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,457
We must get two passes for that party.

307
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:59,124
Passes only, right?
- If not passes will get exhausted.

308
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,957
I'll send my driver to get it.

309
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,249
Tomorrow is very important day for us.

310
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:31,874
My documents.

311
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,624
Mr.Qureishi, yourVisa is ready.

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,749
My guess was right.
You've twins.

313
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,499
I want a boy and a girl.

314
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,457
Agreed, take it.

315
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,874
Daughter will be named Zaara.
- Zaara?

316
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,707
Zaara, it means father's daughter.
Father's daughter.

317
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,999
Then for son?

318
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,374
No, let's name him as Shahrukh.

319
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:44,499
Let's name him as Sachin Tendulkar,
or Pavan Kalyan...

320
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,499
Hey what's this?

321
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,874
Don't be afraid. Playing mischief.

322
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,749
What are you saying?
Are we playing mischief?

323
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,124
Brother, get down.

324
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,124
What's your problem?

325
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,999
They put colour on her.

326
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,999
Put colour on her, right?

327
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:55,249
We are dancing in the God's procession,
you calI is as playing mischief?

328
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,707
Putting colour her is wrong, isn't it?

329
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,624
Get down, let's talk.

330
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,207
We are going.
- PIease forgive us.

331
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,499
Please forgive us.

332
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,082
Stop...stop...

333
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,124
Why are you beating him?
Go away!

334
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,499
He's abusing our God.

335
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,332
He says we are drunk
and playing mischief.

336
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,874
l said go away.
But he's fighting with us.

337
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,332
What is your name?

338
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,957
Are you here to create trouble?

339
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,624
No sir, they...

340
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,957
Are you alI Iike this only?

341
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,957
Go...go!

342
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:32,207
Real devotees will offer prayers only.
Go!

343
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,249
You guys are tarnishing the image
of real devotees of Lord Ganesha.

344
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:39,499
Go away!

345
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:47,624

You want us to go to the city?

How much would be the ticket?

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,749
Just for a night, at the most Rs.2000.

372
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,457
For two, Rs.4000!

Why are they like that, sir?

381
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,332
Rich never smile.

382
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,499
In our country the rich
are very fair.

383
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:06,332
Yes.

384
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,832
They are born and brought up

00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,499
Two rupees short Rs.40000.

386

Ifwe have a blast,
it'll cost Rs.10000, buddy.

388
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,957
BIoody! Rs.40000 for a night's drinks?

389
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:46,874
Lower your voice, if not they'll

00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,957
Buddy, if you talk your way to
make her buy the two tickets.

notjust 2,

392
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,957

393
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,374
oh no! You don't know...

394
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,749
How about this bike?
- Buddy, forget it. Masthan's bike.

395
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,790
You must be alive to
marry her, right?

396
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,290
Take your hands off it.

397
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,749
Bloody life!

398
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,415
Notjust one or two, Rs.40000!

399
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:20,540
Not Rs.40000, two rupees less.

400
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:43,540
Enchanting with beauty and
tying with charm...

401
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,290
Mesmerizing with romance...

402
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,249
Leave the heart's thoughts
to river Ganges...

403
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,540
Leave the thoughts at the threshold...

404
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,165
Leave the issue ofvillage
to village itself...

405
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,540
Leave the issue ofway
to way itseIf...

406
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,874
Leave the rights and wrongs
to ancestors...

407
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,249
Leave the shyness to darkness...

408
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,665
Remove the screen and drapes...

409
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,124
Leave the first feeIings of loneliness...

410
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,415
Leave the bunds and fields...

411
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,624
Leave the puzzles to wind...

412
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,290
How nice it would be to fly away?

413
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,374
The world is a market of colours...

414
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:24,165
Everything here is a wonder...

415
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,624
What is the price of beauty?

416
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,165
Only few could judge, that much...

417
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,665
Chastity...
- Fake virtue...

418
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,040
Love and sacrifice...
- Cheating...

419
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,415
Honour and virtue...
- is up for auction...

420
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,874
All our Iife is...
- IIlusion...

421
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:46,874
Attack, fight, plant, unite,
fighting and hastening...

422
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:51,665
How nice it would be to fly away?

423
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,915
It would be nice to fly away...

424
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:39,540
He always drops in at the wrong time...
Come in SI, sir.

425
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:40,790
Long time no see.

426
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,165
I'm a regular here,
what's this long time no see?

427
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,915
To heII with your brain.

428
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,165
Saroja is getting hotterwith
every passing day. Send her.

429
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:54,040
Saroja has great demand.
Forget her, we've 4 fresh parrots.

430
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,165
I'Il call them.

431
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:59,290
Keep your parrots in the cage.

432
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:02,165
Saroja is mine all the night.
- Difficult sir.

433
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,124
No policeman will come
here till tomorrow.

434
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,624
Your earnings are yours.

435
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,915
Okay. Can we do business refusing you?
Okay, come in.

436
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,165
Want me to massage you,
police brother-in-law.

437
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,249
Remove your hands.

438
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,665
Is Saroja ready?

439
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:19,665
She is but is it forfull night?
Why brother-in-law?

440
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,999
It seems you don't have
that much of potency.

441
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,499
I must take you to station
and give a good thrashing.

442
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:29,915
Forget about thrashing,
l've American tabIets,

443
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,415

l'll give you two tablets.

Move away.

Please call me if you need, brother-in-law.

446
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:42,040
How nice it would be to fly away?

447
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,499
You look like a cinema heroine.

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,499
You don't deserve to be here.

449
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,499
I know that.

450
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,540
lt seems you don't have that
much of potency for full night.

451
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,249
Who told you that?

452
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,624
I'm known as 'Dagger' Kantha Rao
in Kakinada company.

453
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:06,540
But here they say you're impotent.
- Really?

454
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,290
Nobody must say like that.

455
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,540
Just a minute, I'II be back.

456
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:16,415
What are you doing here?
- You want tables, brother-in-law.

457
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,415
For others it's Rs.1000,
but for you it's Rs.500 only.

458
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,999
I'Il pay you tomorrow.

00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,040
Only ifwe are here tomorrow.

460
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,624
Are you ready?

461
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,874
Can't avoid it, right?
FuIl night, right?

462
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,540
Watch out now! I'm not impotent but...

463
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,499
Oh lion!

464
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,249
One!

465
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,290
Romance!

466
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,249
Two!- What?

467
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,749
Three!
- What are you counting?

468
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,040
Four...

469
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:01,665
World is beautiful...
with myriad of colours...

470
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:04,749
AIl say this...

471
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,790
Raju, don't worry.
Let's manage it tomorrow.

472
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:11,540
Where were you all the day?
Masthan's men are combing foryou.

473
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,290
lt seems you took his bike.

474
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,624
They threatened to kill me
if you don't return the bike.

475
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:19,165
I begged them to spare me,
return their bike tomorrow.

476
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:25,749
Why don't you answer me? You collect
their money, can't you give them?

477
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,374
What are you doing with the money?

478
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:31,415
Your parents died leaving you to me,
and you're torturing me to death.

479
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,290
l'm struggling to meet the both ends and
you don't even bother to help an old lady.

480
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,415
You eat and roam Iike a wild bull.

481
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:44,040
I told mom l'll not come.
But we must make it at any cost.

482
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,415
Some guy is coming from Canada;
it's a kind of meeting the bride.

483
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,790
l'll introduce you to my mom.

484
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,415
We are going to the party.
We are meeting your mom.

485
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,290
What about the passes?

486
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,249
Passes? Just Ra.40000 only.
- Rs.40000?

487
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,749
Why do you need so much money?
Are you using drugs?

488
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:10,499
Who is Pooja?
ls she from our slum?

489
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,249
Slum...slum...I'll drown you old woman!

490
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,249
Do you want me to bury in this slum?

491
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,290
Her bungalow will be the
size of our slum.

492
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:22,999
She's a Princess!

493
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,290
Foryour face, you'll get a princess.

494
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,999
lf luck is in our favour,
she'll come here in a Benz car.

495
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,540
Tomorrow morning 7 am flight,
don't forget it.

496
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,374
Why are you telling me? Go to sleep.

497
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,124
You always come late.
- You always come late.

498
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,874
That's you.

499
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:54,374
That's also you.

500
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,540
Even that's also you.
- Go away!- Get lost!

501
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,415
Hi mom!

502
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,040
Major KuIkarni called on phone,

503
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,540
he has asked you to come
tomorrow to fill the applications.

504
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,040
What do you mean by that?

505
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,499
I don't like tojoin Army.

506
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,040
What wilI you do then?

507
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,290
What are you planning
to become in life?

508
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,790
I've started a music troupe, a Rock Band.

509
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:42,915
You mean playing guitar
in hotels and bars.

510
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:47,749
Traditionally our familyjoins
Army or Air force but you...

511
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:54,915
Your grandpa served in Army,
yourfather was in Army,

512
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,790
When dad died, Army got a hero,
but l lost my dad.

513
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:07,249
I'm not selfish, you're forcing
your dreams on me.

514
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:11,540
Is it my dream?
I'm telling you foryour career.

515
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,874
Tomorrow morning I'm going
to Hyderabad.

516
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,124
l don't know what should l tell about
you if anyone inquires.

517
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,915
You don't need to tell, mom.

518
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,540
Everyone wiII tell great
about me with you.

519
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,874
Hey dark man! We can't choose to
be born as son ofAmbani.

520
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:40,999
One must be fortunate.

521
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:44,290
But ifwe plan weIl,
we can become son-in-law.

522
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,165
We must have little talent and
he must have a daughter.

523
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,915
First you must have Rs.40000.

524
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:52,290
Let's do one thing,
let's ask Ra.1000 loan from 40 peopIe.

525
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,665
40 people? Tell mejust one name.

00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,624
l've become like this
lending you money.

527
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,374
Did you ever pay a penny in
the donation box oftempIe?

528
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,874
One who never repays money
lent to him is Cable Raju.

529
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,165
l'll beat you with slipper.

530
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:13,665
Bloody life! Not a soul in
world to Iend us Rs.1000.

531
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,249
You didn't leave anyone,
you've cheated all ofthem.

532
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:24,040
Dark man! Who will invest Rs.4000
trusting on us?

533
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,499
I've been trying your phone since
morning but it's switched off.

534
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,290
I forgot to charge it Iast night.

535
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,290
10 minutes since we missed the flight.

536
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:58,040
Always you're a problem,
how can you be so irresponsible?

537
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:01,624
When is the next flight?
- Not seat vacant.

538
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:06,374
Listen, its 500 kms from
Bangalore to Hyderabad.

539
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,290
Ifwe go by road, we can reach
in 8 hours by evening.

540
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,374
Great, come.

541
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,290
Rathamma used to send me
to bed even if I was sick.

542
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,874
Now we are on our own, sister.

543
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,415
We can take rest orwork as

Okay dear, get up.

545

I told you because I like you.

553

Look Saroja, you're beautiful,

Infact recently l gave 6 apples free to
be distributed among the patients.

00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:28,374
If it's necessary I toId them to cut

562
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,415
Why are you telling me
your boring tales?

570
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,165
Why are you popping in

571
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,124
I don't care about your past.

572
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,540

A rich man died on Road no: 13,

He has some plan, what about you?

611
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:37,874
If he becomes King,
I'm his Minister.

612
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,290

UncIe, you can do if you decide.

I'll sell if you want to buy it.

620
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:01,165
Already he's after my fingers for
non-payment of cable dues.

621
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:05,249

But you can't do it.

625
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:15,665
Uncle, we'll do it, we need money.
- Stop...stop...

626
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,290
Snatch chains.- Chains?

GoId chains worn by women snatch it.

628
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,665
Uncle, he's educated...
- Shut up.

629
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:30,249
Chain snatchers don't do it for mother
or sisters, but for personal...

630
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,665
Hey! What the hell are you saying?

631
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:38,749
We came seeking help but you're
advising him to steal...

632
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,749
Raju, come.
- I'll get a chain by evening.

633
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:44,790
You stop...
I'll get it sold in half an hour.

634
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,540

635
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,040
What's this, Raju?

636
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,624
Don't snatch heavy chains.
- Why?

637
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,290
It may be hard to snap.

638
00:52:56,666 --> 00:53:00,290
One more thing,
don't snatch thin chains too.

639
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:01,915
Why?
- Selling is difficult.

640
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,415
You too come with us.
- Why?

641
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,665
You can measure if it's heavy or thin.

642
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:15,040
Where will the kidneys be, father-in-Iaw?

643
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,874
How will they take it?

644
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:20,540
It's here.

645
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:27,790
You said an iron rod pierced
earlier when l asked.

646
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,249
Not an iron rod, doctor's knife.

647
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:36,124
l settled the principIe of PateI
the other day.

648
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,290
You shouldn't have done it, father-in-Iaw.

649
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,499
Children are the only property
ofthe poor man,

650
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,249
l was illiterate,

651
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,249
my son was illiterate,

652
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:49,040
you are aIso illiterate,
now your son must study,

653
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:53,499
educated will eat three square meals.

654
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,415
Okay, father-in-law.

655
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,040
Let's educate Seenu.

656
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:04,915
Let's anything we have
for him notjust kidneys.

657
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,874
Why are you dancing with a guitar?
Get inside.

658
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,040
Rich brats enjoy life with
their dad's money.

659
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,290
Sit inside.

660
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:01,290
Hey, you tomato head!
Why are you talking about my dad?

661
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,165
How dare you challenge me!
- Watch out, I'm coming.

662
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,790
Move...move...

663
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,999
That bear is finished today.

664
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,749
Bloody idiot!

665
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,290
Which side?

666
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,540
I think it's better to avoid
highway for sometime.

667
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:56,749
Actually we should've stopped
and helped them.

668
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,415
There were many peopIe,
they'll take care ofthem.

669
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:04,374
Help doesn't mean only we,
anyone can do it.

670
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:08,415
Yes, anyone can do it
but not we.

671
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,624
We'lI sing espousing that in songs.

672
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:22,624
Can't differentiate between gold
and fake gold?

673
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,624
What ifwe steal the temple bell?

674
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:32,790
Shall we steal sIippers in the temple?

675
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,415
Shall we steal change
from a beggar's bowl?

676
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:43,290
We need Rs.40000 notjust Ra.40.

677
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:44,999
Use brain.

678
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:48,999
Bloody life! Such a partner in crime.

679
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,999
Entire Rs.40000 is waiting
in the bus stop.

680
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,499
Looks like a street girI.

681
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:09,165
Greetings.
- Greetings.

682
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:12,790
Very happy.
- How is this sister-in-law?

683
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,665
Happy new year and congratulations
for going to Sharjah, sister.

684
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,915
Sister, if you go away to Sharjah,
who will give us money?

685
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:23,499
Your uncle Rahim.
- Where's uncle Rahim?

686
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,415
Think again, father.
You too come with us to Sharjah.

687
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:30,790
l'll stay back here only, son.
- What's in this country?

688
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:34,874
My childhood, my memories,
everything is here, son.

689
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:38,290
I can't leave my motherland.

690
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:42,040
l'm not running away.
l'm escaping.

691
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:47,665
Father, no peace in life here.

692
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,665
I fear to live here.

693
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,915
I fear.
- Fear?

694
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,415
Once man starts fearing,
it follows him wherever he goes, son.

695
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,249
lf there are 10 Hindus,
Muslims get scared,

696
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,415
ifthere are 10 Muslims,
Hindus get scared,

697
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,040
mob mentality.
- Mob mentality?

698
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,749
They kiIIed stillborn.

699
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:29,749
How would you know?

700
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:31,415
How painful it is!

701
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,124
Be ware Hyderabad!

702
00:59:59,125 --> 00:59:59,874
Chain?

703
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,124
I'll give later.

704
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:09,415
Come.

705
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:12,124
Saroja, he's after me.
- Hey Puli Raja!

706
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,415
They took my chain.

707
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,165
It's ringing but not picking it.

708
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,915
BIoody! Don't know where
the hell Koti is?

709
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,415
Try again.

710
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:35,165
Many shells get washed ashore on the
waves of desire with plenty of dreams...

711
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:38,415
Frothy laughs abound...

712
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,915
Madam, pIease connect
to this number.

713
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:46,790
Sister, aII are watching us only.

714
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,165
Let them see!

715
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:53,499
People stare at film stars and us.
- Indeed!

716
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:58,665
I'm Ramulu from Lingampalli.

717
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:03,999
l'll go near, you snatch the chain.

718
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:07,124
I'm scared, please Ieave me, buddy.

719
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:09,540
Coward! Come front.

720
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,374
Come and drive.

721
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:15,540
Be careful.

722
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:18,165
Cut from very near.
Go.

723
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:24,040
Go near...go near...

724
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:42,040
Chain snatching is very difficult,
you need practice for it.

725
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,540
Raju, you made three mistakes.

726
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:52,540
You were born in slum
instead ofJubilee Hills.

727
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,415
Educated but snatching chains.

728
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,665
Tried to snatch Pooja's mother's chain.

729
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,540
Do you love that girl?

730
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,249
Sister is very beautiful, brother-in-law.

731
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,540
l spent a Iot to get her.

732
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,540
What you spent for her is very little.
What did you spend on?

733
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,540
Is it necessary?
- I want to see once.

734
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:18,999
Dark man! There are only two castes
in this world.

735
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:20,790
Haves and have nots.

736
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,165
Theirs is one caste and
ours is one caste.

737
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:27,290
Anyway l don't have any caste feeling
only cash feeling.

738
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,415
Rupee!

739
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,290
Pooja!
- Pick it up.

740
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:39,915
Thief!

741
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,290
I came foryou only.

742
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,290
Anyway we are meeting
today evening, right?

743
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,790
l wanted to see you.

744
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:58,790
What's that kerchief around neck?
lt's very cheap.

745
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:02,915
That guy! He's my driver.

746
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,124
He almost hit your mother
unable to drive properly.

747
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:11,290
Okay, say sorry to mom
when you meet her evening.

748
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:15,124
Have you taken the passes?
- I'm on it...

749
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,749
You'Il meet today evening.

750
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:28,290
Rs.40000! Where should I steal it?

751
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:30,790
It's not wrong to do anything
for such a girl.

752
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:31,790
Isn't it?

753
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,290
Come, luck may change with area.

754
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,790
Sister, he's not picking the call.
- Try again.

755
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,874
Were you the one to calI me?
- Yes sir.

756
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,040
Are you Ramulu?
- Yes sir.

757
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,624
ls it her?- Yes sir.
- Come...come...

758
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:01,790
Sister, if he changes heart,
what would be our plight?

759
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:04,624
It won't happen, don't worry.

760
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:14,415
RamuIu, your name is not Ramulu,
Valigonda Raji Reddy,

761
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:18,415
she's now your daughter,
her name is Revathi,

762
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,165
your younger brother's name is
Valigonda Narasimha Reddy,

763
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:24,499
you're donating your kidney
to his son Pratap Reddy, right?

764
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:26,665
What? He's like your son.

765
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:29,540
Madam, you please remember
he's your eIder cousin brother.

766
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:32,040
Remember it?
Don't forget it.

767
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,040
Do you've a stepney?
- Yes, but that too is flat.

768
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,915
You didn't stop there and
God stopped your car here.

769
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:48,415
I'll never do such a mistake
again in Iife.

770
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,290
Problems are normal for us.

771
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:53,790
You say as if I did flatten
the stepney wantonIy.

772
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,124
Had you come early,
we wouIdn't have missed the flight,

773
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:56,999
we wouldn't be in trouble now.

774
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,790
Why are you heckling me
stiIl for morning incident?

775
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,040
Sop the fight and think
about what to do next?

776
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,749
Pitch a tent there, let's sleep here.

777
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:08,124
We must get the stepney tyre vulcanized.

778
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,040
Where's the vulcanizing shop here?

779
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,915
They are like that, they'll fight
only when we are there.

780
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,290
The story is completely different
in our absence.

781
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,040
Why do you always fight with me?

782
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:30,874
I don't fight it's you!

783
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,290
Okay, it's me.

784
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,665
Angry again!

785
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:37,915
What's that you don't like in me?

786
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:40,790
l hate your singing.
- What?

787
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:44,040
There's no soul in it.
Words don't come from heart.

788
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:47,165
My dad wrote the lyrics,
it sounded good, so l sang.

789
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,915
Who's bothered about lyrics now?

790
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:53,915
You mean?

791
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,915
A song is a lyric told musically.

792
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,915
What do you like in me?
- Your singing.

793
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,540
God has given you a good gift.

794
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,999
Good voice.
Good music sense.

795
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:18,999
Snatch it.

796
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,790
Men are there.
- Don't think too much. Snatch it.

797
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:29,499
Bloody, open your eyes and
snatch it...snatch it...

798
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:49,374
Hop on bike!

799
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:01,499
Bloody crap! Why do you keep a phone?

800
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:02,374
Can't you pick up the call?

801
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:04,124
Don't shout at me.
- Waiting here for haIf an hour.

Coming...
- Come bloody rogue.

806

He's coming, bloody idiot.

807
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:22,540
ln the tension I couldn't
pass urine, I'll go now.

808
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:36,124
Is it for men and women only?
Don't you've for others?

809
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,624
My people are here.
- Sit down.- Sir!

810

From which place?

819
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,415
Are you selling your kidney?

821
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:09,124
My brother.

991
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,332
Wish someone else could buy it
we'd be saved.

992
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:53,832
Where will we go and
whom will we ask?

993
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,832
Isn't selling kidney a crime?

994
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,124
Look, the bus has come.

995
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:11,124

01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:27,249
You weave clothes,
can't you wear good clothes?

1001
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,874
Does a labourer have
a house of his own?

1002
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,249
Does a cobbler own shoes?
Our lives too are similar, sir.

1003
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:40,374
Thinking of cheating a policeman
and surviving in this world?

1004
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:44,499
Cheating?
Did l fleece him or steal him?

1005
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:48,499
Shut up! You get sold for money
and arguing with me.

1006
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,707
Did you talk to Bullabbai?
- Yes, we do get soId for money.

1007
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:55,124
Because we're illiterates
and have nojobs.

1008
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,957
But what's wrong with you?

1009
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:57,999
What?

1010
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:04,499
You've education, you've a job,

1011
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:07,749
but still you get soId for money,

1012
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,582
Bloody bitch!
Are you and me same?

1013
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,874
Shameless creature!

1014
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,749
Why should we be ashamed?

1015
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:21,582
We strip to get sold,
you wear uniform to get sold.

1016
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:27,374
Bitch! How dare you teach
lesson to a policeman!

1017
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,249
Please leave her sir.

1018
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:31,832
You're her accomplice!
Bullabai told me about you also.

1019
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,374
Your name sounds strange, right?
What's your name?

1020
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:37,249
Karpooram (camphor) sir.

1021
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:43,624
Karpooram? What's that name?

1022
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,957
Lives that get extinguished sir.
So that name.

1023
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:54,124
Do you get extinguished
or extinguish others' lives?

1024
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:58,624
Beat and pack them to Bullabbai.
- Okay sir.

1025
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,957
lfyou send us to him,
what would BuIIabbai give you?

1026
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,457
He'II give a bottle of liquor
and a biryani.

1027
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:07,332
That's all, isn't it?
- What would you give me then?

1028
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,499
We're going to run business
newly here,

1029
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:14,207
we'll give your share of
25% every month.

1030
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,999
Please don't send us back
to Rathamma.

1031
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:21,249
Bloody woman! l thought you'd seek a
honest living running away from her,

1032
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:22,999
so you're going start new
business here.

1033
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,749
You'll sell this country.

1034
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,999
Keep this as advance sir.

1035
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,999
Are you giving me a tip?

1036
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:38,624
GoId sir.
- What about this gold?

1037
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:44,999
Hey peacock! Don't be proud
because you're beautiful!

1038
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,124
l'll cut your wings!

1039
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:55,124
Where are they staying?
With whom they're staying?

1040
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,124
Take detaiIs and release them.
- Okay sir.

1041
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,999
Like you ignored the victims
ofthe tractor accident,

1042
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:15,207
had that Sikh lorry driver ignored us
what wouId've happened?

1043
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,374
Vivek is wounded severely.

1044
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,249
Every man speaks about God.

1045
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:02,874
Why should there be
problem about God?

1046
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:04,582
Unable to understand the language

1047
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,582
What's this?

1048
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:13,582
In Telugu.
- Water!

1049
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:15,624
ln Hindi, it is called as water!
- So what?

1050
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,499
God too is like that!

1051
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:20,332
In one language he's called as Rama,
in another language Allah,

1052
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,582
and in another language
he's called as Jesus.

1053
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:25,332
People are not fighting for religion.

1054
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,749
They're fighting without knowing
what to caIl him!

1055
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,499
lfthe entire world had one language
and one culture,

1056
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:35,249
there wouId be one religion only.

1057
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:45,499
Every minute...thinking before
taking a step...

1058
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:51,249
Every minute...reining in the
flow ofthoughts...

1059
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:07,624
Every morning, though dreams melt away...

1060
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:14,332
I'm standing before the truth...

1061
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:27,707
lf humans live like humans and
Iet live humans as humans...

1062
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,332
Sacred Veda (knowledge)...

1063
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:14,207
You're escaping from this country.

1064
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,707
What have you pIanned along
with them before escaping?

1065
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,582
You're prejudiced and torturing us.

1066
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:22,207
We're not like that people.

1067
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,207
You aIl are same!

1068
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:30,374
Why are you accusing the entire
community for few waywards?

1069
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:35,374
Just few? l've evidence that
they've connections.

1070
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:39,249
Tell me...where did you go?
- We went to sister's house.

1071
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,582
We don't know anything sir.
- Who crossed the border with you?

1072
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,999
Don't know sir...don't know sir...

1073
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:48,124
My life got ruined because ofyou sir.

1074
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,832
I lost my forthcoming child.

1075
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,874
You could've stopped it,
but were a mute spectator,

1076
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,374
please don't let them aIso run
away from this country, sir.

1077
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:01,082
What have you planned on January 1st?

1078
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,582
Don't beat us, sir. I don't know sir.

1079
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,874
Please leave them sir.

1080
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,874
Hey you bloody f...,
not tomorrow but tonight!

1081
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:15,499
Today's the judgement day,
thousands will die!

1082
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:18,124
What are you saying, Siraj?

1083
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,374
Where have you planned to do it?

1084
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,624
He's frustrated and Iying, sir.

1085
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,332
Tell me, what have you planned?
Tell me...shall l fire?

1086
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,249
TeIl me else, l'll kilI you.

1087
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,999
KiII me...kill me I say!

1088
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:32,499
You can only kilI me, but
thousands will die tonight.

1089
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:37,707
Kill me...kill me...tonight thousands
will die, watch out!

1090
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,499
Shift them immediately to ATS,
and aIert the control.

1091
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,874
tonight something is going
to happen.

1092
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,124
Get complete information
in an hour.

1093
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,457
WilI you kill thousands of people?

1094
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:49,457
Why are they doing like this?
- I know everything.

1095
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:52,749
Do I look like a fool? Go...go...

1096
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,207
How Iong man!
- It's coming! Have tea till then.

1097
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,749
Hey, give him tea.

1098
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,082
To madam also.
- Okay.

1099
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,499
l'll pay for it.

1100
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,999
As if I owe them money!

1101
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,999
Already they took Rs.2000 inside, uncle.

1102
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:10,582
Like a man who went to police to report
missing son lost his wife too there.

1103
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,874
This is also like that.

1104
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:14,249
Would you like to have tea?
- No uncle.

1105
01:31:14,458 --> 01:31:18,624
We stole the chain neatly,
but bumped into poIice jeep blindly.

1106
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,499
Should've bumped an ambulance,
you'd have landed up in hospital.

1107
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:21,624
Good riddance!

1108
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:22,999
Bloody fooI!

1109
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:26,124
Please wait, let's go back immediately.
- Okay madam.

1110
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:29,499
Uncle, grandma...
- Who will give us money then?

1111
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:40,499
l've Ra.3000, do what so everyou
want to do with it.

1112
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:45,499
Why are you spoiling that girl's life?
You shameless creature!

1113
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,499
Let's go.

1114
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,707
We must know our place!

1115
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,957
Just because I can do devotionals well,

1116
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:59,457
Raghavendra Rao didn't make me music
director of devotional films he made.

1117
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:00,707
This is also same.

1118
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,957
You and that girl have
that much difference.

1119
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:04,832
One must have money for everything.

1120
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,999
Uncle, you didn't see the girl...
- Shut you!

1121
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,499
You're responsible for this situation.

1122
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,832
Don't get caught like this
and call me to get you out.

1123
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,374
Face the music on your own!
l'm getting late for my work.

1124
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,499
What shall we do now?

1125
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:30,124
Who are you calling?

1126
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,374
Where are you?
- I need to meet you urgently.

1127
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,082
I've to talk to you now.
- Now?- Right now.

1128
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:46,749
Coming.

1129
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,499
What is he saying?
- What will he say?

1130
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:52,582
Gold chain, 25%. share,
and Saroja whenever he wants.

1131
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:57,374
You don't worry, just few days
and you'll be the boss.

1132
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:59,124
Bloody! It was all because ofyou.

1133
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,832
Had you come little earIier,
we wouldn't have got caught?

1134
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,374
Boss...my foot boss...who gave
the chain the policeman took?

1135
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:08,499
While getting down from the train,
l stoIe it from that BapatIa short man.

1136
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:11,082
Now, my Lord Krishna has saved us.

1137
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,624
What has he done? There's no God!

1138
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:16,249
Ifthere had been,
why would our fate be like this? Get in.

1139
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:17,957
Who told you about me, sir?

1140
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,207
I've recognized you, sir, tell me.

1141
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:23,249
Yes sir, I do have a good item!

1142
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:26,874
Best one...family type.
Just now stepped in Hyderabad.

1143
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,499
Ours is very strange job, sister.

1144
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:32,457
Anyjob wouId fetch you more salary
the more experienced you are!

1145
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:36,499
Ours is the onlyjob that fetches more
money the less experienced one is!

1146
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:39,457
You'll get paid handsomely for
no experience at alI!

1147
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,332
Are they?- Yes doctor.
- I'll call you later.

1148
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:48,624
What's your name?- Revathi sir.
- Revathi?

1149
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,957
He's my fatherValigonda Raji Reddy,

1150
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,374
he's my paternal uncle
Valigonda Narasimha Reddy.

1151
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:57,124
I'm here to donate my kidney
to his son Pratap Reddy,

1152
01:33:57,333 --> 01:34:00,999
Okay...are you willing to donate kidney?

1153
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,832
I do sir.
- Sign here.

01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:07,332
Thumb impression sir.

1155
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,124
Take the thumb impression and
get her ready for the operation.

1156
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:15,499
Have you eaten anything?
- No.

1157
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:16,832
Okay come with me.

1158
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,999
You don't worry, Padma.

1159
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,749
Just a small cut and
they'II give you anesthesia.

1160
01:34:27,958 --> 01:34:30,249
Just think of Seenu,
you'Il not feel any pain.

1161
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:30,999
Okay father-in-Iaw.

1162
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:34,207
Revathi, pIease come.
- You go...go...

1163
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,999
l'll pay you as soon the
operation is over, Ramulu.

1164
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:39,999
Your grandson will go to the school.

1165
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:00,749
Why are you so tensed?

1166
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:03,874
I can't telI the truth looking
into her eyes.

1167
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:05,999
Shall we go return then?

1168
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,749
No, it's all over.

1169
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:13,749
Today I must tell her the
truth at any cost.

1170
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,874
But l'm scared.

1171
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,582
What shall we do?

1172
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:25,082
You tell her.
- To whom?

1173
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,582
To Pooja!
- Oh no!

1174
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:32,249
I beg you, leave me,
don't trouble me.

1175
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:37,582
It's my life...say it carefully!

1176
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:43,999
I loved her initially for money only,
but don't know when it started,

1177
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:47,249
l love her sincerely,

1178
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,749
but due to unavoidable circumstances,
- What's that?

1179
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,207
Due to unavoidable circumstances...

1180
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,374
Please don't use Hindi words in Telugu.

1181
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,124
lt's Telugu!

1182
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,749
Where is Raj?

1183
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:02,999
TeIl her few truths about me.
- l got it.

1184
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:06,374
Running away with Masthan's money,
snatching chains from women,

1185
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,707
getting bashed up in police station...

1186
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:11,374
Bloody! Not the bad truths, man!
TeIl her good truths.

1187
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:15,499
You mean we don't have money,
cable TV, lives in slum...

1188
01:36:15,708 --> 01:36:17,457
That's all isn't it?

1189
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,624
You're Raj's driver, aren't you?

1190
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:24,957
Where is Raj?

1191
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:27,957
Sir is there.
- Bloody life!

1192
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,332
You wanted to tell me something.

1193
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,499
Before I meet your mother...
I want to teIl you...

Buddy...buddy...

1196
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,249
What's this, buddy?
You said it's all over.

1197
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:26,624
Why this Rs.40000 again?

1198
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,707
Don't know who invented this kiss?

1199
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:30,207
Buddy, this is injustice.

1200
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,707
Must do something and
have that Rs.40000.

1201
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:46,457
Fell...fell...changed...changed...

1202
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:53,124
This is a paper that changes hands
and changes the fate...

1203
01:37:53,250 --> 01:38:01,249
lt's a rupee that keeps flying from
one pocket to another pocket...

1204
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:07,582
Rupee...it' a rupee...

To buiId castles or forts...
or to get cremated...

1206
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:27,624
To eat a morsel offood...
or to kill anyone...

1207
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:31,249
lt's a rupee...

1208
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:54,124
How many coIours this chameIeon has?
Black or white?

1209
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:59,707
The man who is devout of
this Goddess ofwealth...

1210
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:07,749
Even God needs it to fill
the charity box...

1211
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:14,499
Brother, man creates fake notes.

1212
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:18,999
But notes?
- It creates fake men!

1213
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:22,624
Wealth isn't there but here!

1214
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:26,332
Brother, you know this in your life!

1215
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:30,332
There's bread in toast,
but there's no dog in Hot Dog.

1216

I can tell like this philosophy easily.

Every man is ready to advice!

1218
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:56,207
To save a life or to win in a struggle...

1219
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,999
To keep moving the wheel of life...

1220
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:01,957
From birth till death...

1221
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:04,374
It's rupee...

1222
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,874

to peopIe like us.

Do I look like a terrorist?

1233
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:06,082

men always see the entire body

01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:58,832
Men are always mean.

1261
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:02,207
Yes, Koti doesn't even spare me.

1262
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:04,499

Not that but she!

Do you want me?

1269
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,207
What a beauty, Koti!

1270
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:35,499
Ravishing figure!

1271
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:42,957
Rathamma! l got those bitches!

1272
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:46,124
Yadagiri is the right man,

1273
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,874
I don't have anything to do with her.
Send my money.

1274
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:52,374
What's in money? l'll send it.

1275
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:54,249
The bird is dead.

1276
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:56,374
What's up Koti?

1277
01:44:57,125 --> 01:45:01,374
You were arranging beds for me.
Have you started new business?

1278
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:03,124
I didn't know she was your item, brother.

1279
01:45:03,333 --> 01:45:05,499
Bloody bastard! I'll kill you!

1280
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:06,499
Will you trespass into my business?

1281
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:08,832
Wait, l'm taIking to him, right?
- Tell him...

1282
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,124
What had happened was...
- What had happened?

1283
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,082
l beg you, l don't have any
connection with her...

1284
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:20,332
Ifthe deer wants to survive,
it must run very fast,

1285
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,124
or else will get eaten by the tiger.

1286
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:26,374
You keep quiet. Tiger, Koti brought
in few customers.

1287
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:31,499
We thought he was a man.
He ran away leaving the women.

1288
01:45:31,708 --> 01:45:33,874
Are you women? Bloody bitches!

1289
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,249
Look, Koti brought us here.
He ran away.

1290
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,499
Take it as I've come to you on my own.

1291
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:45,124
Let's do business together.
Keep Rathamma away from it.

1292
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:48,707
Take your 25% share.
- 25%?

1293
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:54,874
You're not a partner;
you're an item in the market.

1294
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:58,624
How do we buy pulses, salt, tamarind?

1295
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:01,374
Like that l've bought you from Rathamma.

1296
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,124
No...

1297
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:08,124
New girl...wouId've never seen
anyone like her in life.

1298
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,707
Sister, come.
- Catch them boys!

1299
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:20,582
top...- Leave me.
- Bring them.

1300
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:37,124
Elderly man! Aren't you Revathi's father?

1301
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,874
Is she doing fine sir?
- She's talking now, you can see her.

1302
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,124
Okay sir.

1303
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:04,874
Where are you?

1304
01:48:05,875 --> 01:48:08,624
I'm in shower, tell me.
- Have you taken the passes?

1305
01:48:09,333 --> 01:48:12,082
Why are you getting so worried?

1306
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:17,832
After aII just Rs.40000 only!
That's aII, I'm on it.

1307
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:40,999
CouIdn't you've asked
Rs.1000 extra, father-in-law?

1308
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:48,499
Seenu has no good cloths,
he has only a pair.

1309
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:58,624
He has been asking for slippers
for Iong time, father-in-law.

1310
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:07,457
He gave Ra.3000 short.

1311
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:12,207
Would Patel agree?
- Let's sign a promissory note.

1312
01:49:16,875 --> 01:49:19,999
Grandpa! There's some money
on the floor, is it yours?

1313
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:21,624
Money?

1314
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:29,124
Father-in-law, thief!

1315
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:36,124
My money...my money...

1316
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:42,082
Money is for a child's education!

1317
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,624
For my son!

1318
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,207
More dangerous than you.

1319
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:23,374
Be careful.

1320
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,249
Don't plan anything together.

1321
01:50:27,875 --> 01:50:31,207
Why are you staring at me?
I'lI pluck out your eyes.

1322
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:34,332
Be alert.

1323
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:45,582
This is the way every Muslim
is treated in this country.

1324
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:47,624
What's your name?

1325
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,624
Sister...you got stabbed...

1326
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:39,624
Stop...stop...

1327
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:47,457
That van driver hit me...

1328
01:51:55,625 --> 01:51:56,499
Be careful!

1329
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,207
Why do you want to take the trouble?
- Open the door I say!

1330
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:08,249
Don't argue, open the door.

1331
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,624
Go to hospital.

1332
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:47,249
StiIl not yet ready?

1333
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:49,457
Did you take the passes or not?

1334
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,749
Taken the passes or...

1335
01:53:52,083 --> 01:53:53,499
l don't have money.

1336
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,499
My name is Ananda Raju.

1337
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,374
PeopIe call me a Cable Raju.

1338
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:08,832
l live in the slum behind your house.

1339
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,082
Ever since I met you, what ever
I had said or done is blatant lie,

1340
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,374
I'm a hypocrite.

1341
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:28,624
My life is different from
what I'm living

1342
01:54:30,625 --> 01:54:34,957
Like a storm in the sea...
it raised to great height...

1343
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:40,999
A wish to wash the heart clean...

1344
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:47,999
Like a dying candIe's light,
it's flickering....

1345
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:54,624
The wishes to live like a true human...

1346
01:54:56,500 --> 01:55:00,624
It has become the beat ofthe heart...

1347
01:55:00,833 --> 01:55:05,082
It has become the life in eyes...

1348
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:10,707
Like the soul ofthe Iife...

1349
01:55:13,958 --> 01:55:21,499
Let the human take birth
again in me...

1350
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:52,999
Doctor has gone for the rounds,
please wait.

1351
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,374
How long?

1352
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,499
How much time has passed
since it happened?- An hour.

1353
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:09,874
Check her sir.
- What happened?

1354
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,374
Got stabbed, lost heavy blood.

1355
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,457
Stab? Did you lodge poIice complaint?

She doesn't have anyone else

malls only few people die,

This holy war for Allah!

1454
02:12:45,083 --> 02:12:45,749
Silence!

1455
02:12:51,583 --> 02:12:53,374
Which God has asked
to kill humans?

1456
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:55,499
This is for the holy war!

1457
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,624
God too trusts humans only.

1458
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:19,707
Are you a Muslim?
Are you really a Muslim?

1459
02:13:19,875 --> 02:13:23,832
What you are doing isn't
approved by Allah!

1460
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,749
Ifthis is holy war as you say,
kill all of us here!

1461
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:29,457

02:14:49,375 --> 02:14:51,707
What's your name, brother?

1465
02:15:07,583 --> 02:15:20,499
In this new life, where there is
no pIace for darkness...

1466
02:15:22,125 --> 02:15:34,249
Know there is still a battle
to be won...

1467
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:59,874
Can you recognise one of
your old friends?

1468
02:16:16,375 --> 02:16:17,749
Where are we going?

1469
02:16:17,875 --> 02:16:20,124
We'lI catch the first train
leaving the station,

1470
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:21,749
and go the place where it takes us.

1471
02:16:21,958 --> 02:16:23,707
How to make our livelihood?

1472
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:27,874
We've come back from death,
let's earn honestly, live honourably.

1473
02:16:28,083 --> 02:16:29,124
Don't want to continue
this damned life.

1474
02:16:29,625 --> 02:16:30,832
Just a smaII stomach, right?

1475
02:16:32,291 --> 02:16:35,290
Come, we'll not have any opposition.
Trust me.

1476
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,999
Saroja, your dream of own company.

1477
02:16:38,416 --> 02:16:42,415
Hey, neverwalk before a bull,
it'll butt you,

1478
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:45,915

it'll kick you,

1479
02:16:46,291 --> 02:16:48,874
never walk on any side
of a crook like you.

1480
02:17:15,291 --> 02:17:26,665
Lies...truth...
eyes will telI everything...

1481
02:17:26,791 --> 02:17:32,374
What did he say uncle?
IfVlP's die people come for 3 days.

1482
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:40,374
But people will come
a week for him, uncle.

1483
02:17:41,541 --> 02:17:45,040
He died like a hero, uncle!
- Who said he has died?

1484
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:51,499
Death has died!

1485
02:17:57,291 --> 02:17:59,999
Hail Ananda Raju!

1486
02:18:14,416 --> 02:18:15,290
Grandpa!

02:18:15,416 --> 02:18:18,665
Rs.35000?!
Who will pay the balance Rs.15000?

1488
02:18:18,875 --> 02:18:20,915
if you want the kid,
settle every penny.

1489
02:18:21,041 --> 02:18:23,540
Hey Patel! That's it!

1490
02:18:23,666 --> 02:18:27,165
Enough ofyour looting!

1491
02:18:27,375 --> 02:18:29,999
Check the accounts.

1492
02:18:30,166 --> 02:18:33,999
I don't know to calculate, PateI.
- Then pay Rs.15000 now.

1493
02:18:34,166 --> 02:18:37,415
Grandpa, I know to calculate,
can I calcuIate the interest on loan?

1494
02:18:37,625 --> 02:18:40,624
Calculate interest on Ra.50000
loan at 2%.

1495
02:18:40,791 --> 02:18:42,415
For Rs.50000, if you remove
the zero...zero...1000...

1496
02:18:42,541 --> 02:18:44,915
For 30 months...Rs.30000, grandpa.

1497
02:18:45,125 --> 02:18:47,374
Rs.30000, that's all!

1498
02:18:47,541 --> 02:18:48,624
Come Seenu!

1499
02:18:49,041 --> 02:18:50,790
Why did you let him go, Patel?

1500
02:18:51,375 --> 02:18:53,540
How quickly he calculated
the loan interest!

1501
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:55,790
Let him go,
let him go to the school!
