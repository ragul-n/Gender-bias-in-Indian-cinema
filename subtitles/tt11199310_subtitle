00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,041
<i>"Greatness is a quality.</i>

2
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,583
<i>It's neither acquired
through one's recognition…</i>

3
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,583
<i>nor lost because of being unacknowledged."</i>

4
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,625
<i>My grandfather told me
this when I was young.</i>

5
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,333
<i>But then, I was not mature enough
to understand what it meant.</i>

6
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,375
<i>And when I understood
what it meant, he was no more.</i>

7
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,166
<i>If you really want to know
the meaning of this statement,</i>

8
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,041
<i>you need to know my story.</i>

9
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,708
<i>My name is Manasa Samyuktha.</i>

10
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:02,416
<i>I come from a small
village called Lambasingi</i>

11
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,916
<i>near Visakhapatnam in
Andhra Pradesh, India.</i>

12
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,750
<i>I belong to a simple, middle-class family.</i>

13
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,666
Disgusting! What's with this dirt?

14
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,875
You are supposed to come straight
home when Dad leaves for the camp.

15
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,583
Don't say anything to her!
She fell into the gutter by accident.

16
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,166
Enough with the nonsense.

17
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,250
Do you think I am your teacher
to believe all your lies?

18
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,708
I am your mother.

19
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,791
What other things have
you done discreetly?

20
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,958
Did you eat something
on your way back home?

21
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,958
No, Mom. We didn't eat anything.

22
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,333
You ate something, didn't you?

23
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,208
No, Mom.

24
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:01,500
I know that you look at
your feet whenever you lie.

25
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,375
Don't look at your feet.
Look at me, and answer me.

26
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,875
You ate something, right?

27
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,916
Okay. Dad must be on his way.
Go and take a shower.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,416
Wear your nightclothes
and come back here in ten minutes.

29
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,000
- Kamala!
- Yes.

30
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,791
- Dad!
- Dad!

31
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,583
Dad… why do you look so dull?
How was the camp?

32
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,458
- It was okay, dear.
- Give it to me.

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,181
One's stress also increases when
there's an increase in the salary.

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,934
This is what a middle-class
man has to go through!

35
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,291
Dad, I had asked you to get me a watch.
Did you get it?

36
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,500
I forgot about it, dear.

37
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,291
You and your forgetfulness!

38
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,166
Last time, you forgot your watch.

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,791
And this time,
you forgot to get a watch for him.

40
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,041
What's happening?

41
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,458
I will get it next time.
Go and set the table. I am starving.

42
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,666
- Go.
- Come.

43
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,333
Arjun, Sahana, Samyuktha.
What's happening?

44
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,125
- Is everything okay at school?
- Yes, Dad.

45
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,875
Why hasn't Dad arrived yet?

46
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,375
There are experiments going
on with a new drug in the clinic.

47
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,000
I guess he would be back
only when those conclude.

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,583
Today, they got their
progress reports at school.

49
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,250
Arjun, is there any progress?
Or is it the usual regress?

50
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,333
I got a B, Dad.

51
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,541
Wow!

52
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,541
What about you, Sahana?

53
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,666
I got an A, Dad.

54
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
I topped the tests, Dad.

55
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,000
Remember, good grades are of no
use if you don't have any goal in life.

56
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,767
It's been six months since I asked
you what you would like to become.

57
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,458
By the time you get your next report
card, tell me what your goal is.

58
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,541
If you're unable to do that,
then your good grades wouldn't matter.

59
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,041
Samyuktha, what happened?
Are you not able to sleep?

60
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,041
- No, Dad. I have a stomachache.
- Oh.

61
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,791
I can't sleep.
I want to go to Grandpa.

62
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:11,375
Now? I will give you some medicine.
Take it and sleep. We shall go tomorrow.

63
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,958
No… I want to see Grandpa.

64
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,000
At this hour? Keep quiet and go to sleep.

65
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,083
No, I want to be with Grandpa.

66
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,958
If your mom wakes up,
you are going to be grounded.

67
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,125
Get up slowly, and come with me.

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,291
BHARAT AYURVEDA CLINIC

69
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,666
Dear, are you feeling better?

70
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,625
Now that I helped you feel better,
what are you going to give me in return?

71
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,791
A kiss.

72
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,125
I don't want it.

73
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,291
Then, what do you want?

74
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,333
I want my Samyuktha to become
as famous as the Queen.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,375
The entire nation should
sing your praises.

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,291
They should be proud of you.
They should like your work.

77
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,208
Promise me that you will do that.

78
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,458
Grandpa, I don't know about that,

79
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:12,041
but I promise you that I will show
the world what a great man you are!

80
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,541
There's nothing great about me, dear.

81
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,541
I love this country, so I worked
in the military for a few years.

82
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,000
And now, with my little
knowledge of medicine,

83
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,291
I am looking after
the people of the village.

84
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,416
This tea is enough to prove
what a great person you are!

85
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,208
And people should know about this tea.

86
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:41,666
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

87
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,750
<i>Happy birthday, dear Samyuktha!</i>

88
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,458
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

89
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,291
- How many students are there?
- I'd say approximately 500.

90
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,750
Samyuktha, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

91
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,791
I will finish my MBA,
and then I'll start a business.

92
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,458
Yeah, right! As if she is really
going to start a business!

93
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,875
No, dear. Men do business.
This field is not meant for women.

94
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,250
A girl should be educated,

95
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,541
and she should marry a guy chosen
by her parents and settle down.

96
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,916
No. I am not that kind of a girl.

97
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,208
I will do as I please,
and be whoever I want to be.

98
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,392
- Brother.
<i>- Yes, Samyuktha?</i>

99
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,000
I've finished my project research.

100
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,166
I'll be there in some time.

101
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,166
<i>Come. Everyone is waiting for you.</i>

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,125
If someone tries to scare you, you
should be scared, Mr. Siva Rama Krishna.

103
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,250
Who are you, dear?

104
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,375
I am from Blue Dart, sir. I've come
here to deliver your daughter to you.

105
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,541
- Kamala!
- Yes?

106
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,875
Someone is trying to prank us!

107
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,041
I was just acting,
but you are going overboard.

108
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,750
Samyuktha, come.

109
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,375
Hi, Mom! Not just Samyuktha,
it's Manasa Samyuktha.

110
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,291
Alright, come.

111
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,541
- Hello, lawyer!
- Hello.

112
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,708
- How is your practice going?
- Perfect.

113
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,666
- Dear!
- Grandpa!

114
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,625
Is all well with you?

115
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,833
Yes, Grandpa!

116
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,125
Hey…

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,041
Dear! What happened to you?

118
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,333
- Dad!
- What happened?

119
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,896
- What happened?
- What happened, Dad?

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,041
When Samyuktha came home after two
months, he couldn't recognize her, doctor.

121
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:53,125
Arjun… what I'm about to discuss
with you is a sensitive matter.

122
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,416
Your father has Alzheimer's.

123
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,583
Stage five!

124
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,333
There is a moderately severe decline.

125
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,500
It means that his brain
function is declining.

126
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,000
He's suffering from memory
loss, and that's why…

127
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,041
he is unable to recognize people.

128
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,333
So… please don't do anything
that may give him stress.

129
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,500
Make sure the people he loves are
beside him, and take care of him warmly.

130
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
Just like a kid.

131
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,250
I strongly feel that…

132
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,291
it would be better if he doesn't
work in a situation like this.

133
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,541
I understand what you're saying,

134
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,291
but the family's responsibility
is on his shoulders.

135
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,916
People of his age generally
do not get this disease.

136
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Maybe, he got it at such a young age
because of the stress at his work.

137
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,583
He's been continuously working
to provide for the family.

138
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,833
As his eldest son,

139
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,861
it's time for you to take
the responsibility of the family.

140
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,791
Both of you are mentally strong…

141
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,851
that's why, I am discussing this with you.

142
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,125
You need to subtly break this
news to your family members.

143
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,041
Grandpa, it's quite late.
Please, have your dinner.

144
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,833
No, dear. I am not hungry.

145
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,958
It's not advisable to go to bed
on an empty stomach at your age.

146
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,166
Please, have it.

147
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,916
Alright… I'll eat after some time.

148
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,583
Samyuktha, sit with me.

149
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:40,291
He lost his mother when…
he was just two years old.

150
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:47,208
Since then, I didn't pay attention
to him or this household.

151
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,375
He used to wake up
at five o'clock in the morning,

152
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:56,000
finish all the household work,
and go to school by himself.

153
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,750
In the evening, by the time I
came home from the hospital,

154
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,291
he would get the food ready.

155
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,291
I never urged him to study.

156
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,875
He studied hard on his own.

157
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,375
And he worked hard to get
to where he is now.

158
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,791
And now, he's suffering memory loss.

159
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,166
Samyuktha, fate is very strange.

160
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,458
So…

161
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:25,291
the amount of hard work you put in
life is not the most important thing.

162
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,541
How happy you are in life is
the most important thing.

163
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,291
Nothing matters if one is not
happy, Samyuktha.

164
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,958
Keep that in mind!

165
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,125
What happened, Mom?
Why do you look dull?

166
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,958
It's been more than a month
since he went to work.

167
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,666
We have to pay the fees.
There are education fees,

168
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:06,708
medical fees, etc.
They are increasing day by day.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,833
Kamala, don't worry. I am here.

170
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,958
I am going to take care of their
education fees and his medical fees.

171
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,291
Sahana is starting her practice as well.

172
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,750
That would help us in one way or another.

173
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,625
Arjun, I am going out.
Take care of the house.

174
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,416
Stop!

175
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,875
Sahana… what's this?

176
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,958
You didn't tell us anything about this.

177
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:57,833
How dare you marry some stranger
and come to us for blessings!

178
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,875
Please, let us explain...

179
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:04,125
Don't you dare speak!
I have no reason to speak to you.

180
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,708
Mom, he is my husband.
We've been in love since a long time.

181
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,684
We knew that you wouldn't agree. That's
why, we had to get married this way.

182
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,166
How could you do this despite being
fully aware of the situation at home?

183
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,125
Instead of being sensible…

184
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,000
you have just been selfish!

185
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,583
It's better to be childless…

186
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,125
than having a daughter like you!

187
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,375
Mom…

188
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,541
Perhaps, his memory loss is God's way

189
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,750
of shielding him from
seeing what you've done!

190
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,541
Had he seen what you have done,
he would have died of a heart attack.

191
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,208
Before he comes to know any of
this, get out of the house!

192
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,375
- Go away!
- Mom…

193
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,458
Sahana.

194
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,041
- Kamala...
- Dad, don't you have to go to the clinic?

195
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,708
I am ready.

196
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,708
I'm going to the bank.
Come, I will drop you off.

197
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,208
No, son. There's still some time left.
In the meanwhile, get some rest.

198
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,958
- Why should I get rest?
- Just do it!

199
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,476
- Arjun, take him inside.
- I am alright.

200
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,000
Dad, I spoke to you about my
semester results the other day…

201
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,458
Kamala, what happened?
Why is the house lit up?

202
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,875
Dad… it's Diwali today.

203
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,000
Diwali?

204
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,041
A lot of bad things have
happened in this house.

205
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,875
What's there to celebrate?

206
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,458
Diwali is celebrated
when good wins over evil.

207
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,434
Dad used to tell this
to us when we were kids.

208
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,916
Really? When did I ever say that?

209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Dad, brother has completed his studies.
Soon, he will get a good job.

210
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,083
After that, I'd also be done with my MBA.

211
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,000
I will start my business immediately.

212
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,125
We wouldn't have any
kind of stress or fear.

213
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,291
Ours is not the kind of household
that indulges in businesses.

214
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,750
It'd not be a right decision in
these circumstances, Samyuktha.

215
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,208
Be smart about it.
Finish your MBA, and get a good job.

216
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,458
Get rid of those thoughts of
starting a new business, Samyuktha.

217
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,666
When I wake up in the morning,
my tummy is all bloated

218
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,958
and my throat is entirely dry.

219
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,041
He gets irritated as soon
as he gets out of bed.

220
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,333
He gets impatient and agitated for
every single thing. Please, take a look.

221
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,083
Here's what is wrong with your husband.

222
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,041
Every night, he has alcohol with soda.

223
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,434
The gas in the soda gets trapped in his
stomach, so it's bloated because of that.

224
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,375
He is responsible for that!

225
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,583
Don't worry.
I will write you some medicine.

226
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,416
Hello, Doctor Viswanatha!

227
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,000
Please come in, Miss Manasa Samyuktha!

228
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,333
You came right on time.

229
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,666
Take this medicine,
and brew him a cup of tea with that.

230
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,708
- At your service, Grandpa!
- Thank you.

231
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,208
She's my granddaughter.
She loves me a lot.

232
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,541
She's got all of my qualities.

233
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,875
Wow! This tea tastes like ambrosia.

234
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,750
I've never had tea that tasted
this good in my entire life.

235
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,416
It looks like your granddaughter will be

236
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,291
your serious competition when it
comes to brewing such kind of tea.

237
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,625
I'd be the proudest person

238
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,833
if my granddaughter becomes
more successful than me!

239
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,166
Come on, Grandpa.
I learned all this from you.

240
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,541
You should thank my grandfather, not me.

241
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,125
Darling… make me a cup of tea every day

242
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:07,541
until my last breath.

243
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,625
I don't want anything more
from you in this life.

244
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,125
Grandpa, not just here…

245
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:17,541
but no matter where you go,
I will never leave you.

246
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,458
It's not so easy to escape from me.

247
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,125
M. Tech Mechanical engineering…

248
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,750
2020 batch…

249
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,666
third rank goes to Mr. Arjun Chaitanya.

250
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,208
Thank you, sir.

251
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,559
- I hope you get done with your MBA soon.
- Don't worry. It will be done.

252
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,250
- Arjun Chaitanya!
- Hello, Professor GK.

253
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,791
Congrats again, my boy!

254
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,333
Thank you but why, sir?

255
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,416
I saw your robotic design.
It has impressed me a lot.

256
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,541
My gut told me to send it
to American universities, so I sent it.

257
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,416
They are immensely impressed.

258
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,833
You know what?
They have offered you a job in America.

259
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,411
If you are interested,
you can go and join next month.

260
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,541
Sir, is this for real?
I cannot believe it.

261
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,541
Yes, you've made it.
I'm totally proud of you, my boy!

262
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,333
Thank you so much for your help. I am in
desperate need of such a job right now.

263
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,083
- I know. Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

264
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,125
Thank you, sir.

265
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,583
I need to immediately tell
this to Dad and Grandpa.

266
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,500
I am confused about how to tell
this news to father-in-law.

267
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,958
We sent the children from our village
to the town for their education.

268
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,708
For their higher education,
we sent them from towns to cities.

269
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,458
We made our peace…

270
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,666
with the fact that they're living
far from us in the same country.

271
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,458
And today…

272
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,916
they have to leave us behind
to pursue jobs abroad.

273
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:05,791
Our condition will improve…
if all of us relocate along with Arjun.

274
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,875
And that is what all of us feel.

275
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,708
My husband would get
a better treatment over there.

276
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,500
Samyuktha will have better
job options over there…

277
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,875
after she gets done with her education.

278
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
You've sacrificed a lot for us.

279
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,166
At your age, you need to rest more.

280
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,083
That is why, we think it would be
the best if you come there along with us.

281
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:35,750
Nothing's wrong with my age. I would
still be sturdy for another five years.

282
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,875
You all can go to America
as per your wish.

283
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,541
Don't think about me.

284
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,916
Grandpa, if you don't want to
go, I will stay here with you.

285
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,125
I am not going if you're not going.

286
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:04,125
I don't want to impede your
desires, dreams and opportunities.

287
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,833
It is up to you.
You can do whatever you feel like doing.

288
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,333
Grandpa!

289
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:29,375
Grandpa, here's your cup of tea. Once...

290
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,291
Grandpa.

291
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,291
Grandpa!

292
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,208
Get up, Grandpa.

293
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,708
The memories we have of
the person we love the most…

294
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,958
give us a great deal of happiness.

295
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,375
And when that person leaves us forever,

296
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,333
those very memories bring
us a lot of pain as well.

297
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,958
But this is life.

298
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,875
We cannot be sad forever.

299
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,208
We should not miss
the opportunities at hand.

300
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,833
We have to leave in two days.

301
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,125
Be ready.

302
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,625
<i>Greatness is neither acquired
through one's recognition…</i>

303
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,583
<i>nor lost because of being unacknowledged.</i>

304
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,791
<i>You always believed in that,</i>

305
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:14,250
<i>but I believe that everyone should
know what a great person you are.</i>

306
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,166
Samyuktha.

307
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,250
Come. Get in the car quickly!

308
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
We're getting late.

309
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,250
I hope you didn't forget any luggage.

310
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,958
- Let me help you.
- No, I got it.

311
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,208
I am feeling very proud.

312
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,666
Everyone in the village used to ask me

313
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,101
what my achievement in life
was other than working in a bank.

314
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,000
Look, it is with the same bank job that…

315
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,916
I have managed to get
you all here to the USA.

316
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:33,208
That's true.
We are all here because of you.

317
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,125
She is definitely an Indian.

318
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,791
Let's go talk to her.

319
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,208
Hey!

320
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,958
Are you from India?

322
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,791
I am Padma Nayana from India.

323
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,791
I am Preethi from India.

324
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:31,083
Hi. I am Manasa Samyuktha from Lambasingi.

325
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,166
- Wow!
- Oh, nice.

326
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,875
- I am pursuing an MBA in Marketing.
- I am pursuing an MBA in HR.

327
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,125
I'm in Finance.

328
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,958
- Nice.
- First day?

329
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,083
Oh, is it that clearly visible?

330
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,666
Chill! First day here is usually like
that. Let's go and have a cup of coffee!

331
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,833
- Yeah.
- Actually, I am a tea addict.

332
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,458
I've been looking for a good cup of
chai ever since I got here, but no luck.

333
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,291
Everyone here drinks coffee.

334
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,083
Forget chai.

335
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,625
Let's have a cup of coffee,
and KSK Coffee is the best.

336
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:57,958
You should definitely try it.

337
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:03,041
So, what are your plans
after completing your MBA?

338
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,708
I want to start my own business.
That's my dream.

339
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,750
But my mother and my
brother don't like the idea.

340
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,166
Let's see what happens.

341
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,166
- Hi, girls. What's up?
- What's up, Alex?

342
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,416
You do remember, right?
Be there at seven o'clock, sharp!

343
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:21,458
Even if we try to forget it,
I don't think you will ever let us.

344
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,916
Oh, you silly girl! If beautiful
girls like you don't come to the party,

345
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,416
what will happen to the beauty
of the party? See you there.

346
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,750
- Right.
- Bye!

347
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,833
Who was that? What was he talking about?

348
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,625
That is Alex, a local wannabe guy.

349
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,833
He arranges parties around.

350
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,125
So that Indians like us
can get to know each other.

351
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,250
If you come,
you would get to know a lot of people.

352
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:45,208
I don't like to go to parties.
You guys go ahead.

353
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,875
Samyuktha, this is America…

354
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,916
the most happening place on the planet.

355
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,541
Please, come.
You will realize why I am saying this.

356
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,583
- Anyway, we are in the final year.
- Yes.

357
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,166
We might not get a chance
to enjoy ourselves again in life.

358
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,666
So, enjoy it to the fullest.

359
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,333
- Alright, I'll think about it.
- Here.

360
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,708
Thank you.

361
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:15,916
Come on.

362
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,666
Four!

363
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Dad.

364
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,250
Samyuktha, come.

365
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,000
Kohli is doing a fantastic job
with the batting. Sit down.

366
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,208
His score is 56. He's going strong.
India is just 50 runs away from a win.

367
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,375
- Exciting!
- Dad, that was yesterday's match.

368
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,083
India lost the match.

369
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:38,000
What are you talking about?
They are playing really well. Watch it.

370
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:44,958
Damn!

371
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,333
- Let's go dance, Preethi.
- No, wait.

372
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,291
Hi.

373
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey! Look, Samyuktha is here!

374
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,666
- Hey! What a pleasant surprise!
- Hi.

375
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,750
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello! How are you?

376
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:11,833
Hello.

377
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,291
- Three tequila shots, please!
- Hey, I don't drink.

378
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,083
Oh, really? Then, why did you come
to the pub? To perform prayers?

379
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,511
"A life spent without tasting wine,
whiskey or vodka is a big waste."

380
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,291
That is what my grandma used to say.

381
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,583
I have a cup of chai when I am happy…

382
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,458
and a cup of coffee when I'm angry.

383
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,500
I don't know any other
beverages than these two.

384
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,434
Alright. The three of us are together
for the first time at a party,

385
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,000
so we should do something crazy.

386
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,101
Shall we play "Truth or Dare"?

387
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,166
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on.

388
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,916
- Truth or dare?
- Truth!

389
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,375
- Okay.
- How many times have you kissed until now?

390
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,625
- How was it?
- No, only one question.

391
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:01,708
- Okay.
- Come on.

392
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,583
Truth or dare?

393
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:10,833
Dare.

394
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,208
Look over there! Do you see that couple?
Create a rift between them.

395
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,708
What? They might hit me!

396
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,375
Rules are rules.

397
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,416
- Are you sure?
- Yes! You must do it.

398
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,583
Alright!

399
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,625
- Have you been to India?
- India?

400
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,416
No, Vijay. Never.

401
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,833
Hi. What's up?

402
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,750
- Hey, who are you?
- I'm Manasa Samyuktha.

403
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:42,166
- Samyuktha?
- Manasa Samyuktha!

404
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,833
Okay. Do I know you?

405
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,500
Hasn't he told you that we
are getting married next week?

406
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,208
Sorry, what did you say?

407
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:55,041
I said we both are
getting married next week.

408
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,291
Okay, Vijay! See you, bye.

409
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,166
Stella!

410
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,083
- Stella!
- Hey.

411
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,166
Stella!

412
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,666
Actually…

413
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,458
- This is your phone, right?
- I am so...

414
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:12,416
- Stella!
- Wait, Stella!

415
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:14,375
- Stella!
- Stella!

416
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,916
Oh, God!

417
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,333
- Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
- Why would you do something like that?

418
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, my friends had given me a dare.

419
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,541
They asked me to create
a rift between you guys.

420
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,958
That's all. I'm really sorry.

421
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,208
Please, give me my phone.

422
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Dinner?

423
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,208
No, it's not possible.

424
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,000
- Then, I cannot return your phone.
- Hey!

425
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,541
You're taking a disadvantage
of the opportunity.

426
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,916
Didn't you do the exact same thing
earlier, Miss Manasa Samyuktha?

427
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,541
What should I do now?

428
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:03,583
If you want your phone back,
come and have dinner with me.

429
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,166
<i>Going with him for dinner
doesn't make him my boyfriend…</i>

430
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,708
<i>and me his girlfriend.</i>

431
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,375
<i>- It's okay. I'll go.</i>
- It is alright.

432
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,291
It's just dinner.
I am not asking you to date me.

433
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,333
Let's go.

434
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:23,916
Oh, man!

435
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,375
Having dinner with you is just
like watching a silent movie.

436
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,958
I am here to have dinner.
I am not on a date.

437
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,708
I'll tell you something.

438
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,958
And if you don't want to
speak with me even after that,

439
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,250
I'll keep quiet.

440
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,250
I saw you at the pub earlier…
even before you saw me.

441
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,541
I found you very interesting
from the moment I saw you,

442
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:56,250
but I couldn't approach you as I
thought you might misunderstand me.

443
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,125
But look at my fate.
Amid all the people in that pub,

444
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,708
you came and spoke to me.

445
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:09,625
I've invited you to dinner so that we can
understand this situation.

446
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,458
I hope you're not uncomfortable.

447
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,625
If you don't mind, could you ask
them to pack the leftover food?

448
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,708
Why? Let's order something fresh.

449
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,750
Well, I don't like wasting food.

450
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,666
So, I will give it to someone else.

451
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,416
Oh, charity, right?

452
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,583
Not really. It's more like humanity.

453
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,166
Giving for the sake of giving is charity.

454
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,791
And sharing because we have
enough is humanity.

455
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,875
That's quite clear.

456
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:40,666
I know.

457
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,375
Yes, sir? Anything else?

458
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,333
Samyuktha?

459
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,625
Do you have chai?

460
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,041
Chai? Oh, no! Sorry, ma'am.

461
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:52,375
They don't serve chai.

462
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:56,000
Why do you look so sad as if
you've lost a million dollars?

463
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,500
I've lost something more
valuable than a million dollars.

464
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,333
But you don't need to know that.

465
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,416
You seem to have found something
in the water over there.

466
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,333
You've been observing it seriously.

467
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,041
Nope, not really.

468
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,458
You told me that you lost something
more precious than a million dollars.

469
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,625
May I know what it is?

470
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,333
My grandfather!

471
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:51,000
He left this world, and left me alone.

472
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,541
I have always adored him
ever since I can remember.

473
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:57,458
I am not at all feeling good…

474
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:03,166
about leaving the house I grew up
in, my village, and my country.

475
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,750
If everything happens as per our heart's
desire, why would we call it a "life"?

476
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:14,208
Anyway, nothing is permanent here.

477
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,875
Neither you nor me.

478
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,708
There is nothing much we can do
other than forgetting and moving on.

479
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,125
For someone like you who's
been away from his country,

480
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,625
forgetting someone
might not be such a big deal.

481
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:37,458
I remember every minute
detail about him even today.

482
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,333
You wouldn't understand.

483
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,000
Samyuktha, wait a minute!

484
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,625
I lost my mother when I was ten years old.

485
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,500
I stayed in my room for a month
after her death and cried.

486
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,666
My mother never came back.

487
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,625
But the pain always remained.

488
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,291
So, don't think that I don't
understand your pain.

489
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,625
I said that to console you.

490
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,458
I won't deny the beauty
and charm of India.

491
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,125
But America is beautiful as well.

492
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,750
If we could inculcate the simplicity

493
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,458
that we see in nature
into our thought process…

494
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,375
we would be at peace.

495
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,083
You are using your pain as an excuse

496
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:56,458
to stop yourself from enjoying the beauty
and happiness that exist in this country.

497
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,916
If you give it a chance, you will see it.

498
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,291
I have saved my name
as "Vijay" on your phone.

499
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:16,208
If you think I made any sense
today, call me.

500
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,250
I will be waiting.

501
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:51,708
<i>Hello!</i>

502
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:56,750
Thanks, Vijay! Ever since I started
seeing the beauty that surrounds me…

503
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,625
I started feeling better.

504
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,250
That's great!

505
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:05,625
- Are you free tomorrow evening?
<i>- Yes, I am.</i>

506
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,291
I have two tickets for a movie.

507
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,000
My friend has some work,
so he can't make it.

508
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,666
Would you like to join me?

509
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,875
<i>I was waiting for him to ask me out.</i>

510
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,458
<i>Now, he's asked me out just
like they show in the movies.</i>

511
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,208
Well… I'll think about it.

512
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,416
What do you mean?

513
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:23,375
Mr. Vijay, if a girl says she will not
come, it means she is thinking about it.

514
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:26,083
If she says she will think about it,
it means she will come.

515
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:29,250
If she blatantly tells you that she
will come, that means she isn't a woman!

516
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,708
Oh!

517
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,625
Which movie is it?

518
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,541
You will know if you come.

519
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,250
Okay, see you there.

520
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,500
In India, it didn't matter
how you used to dress up.

521
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:44,958
But this is America.

522
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,041
It's time you flaunt your
beauty to this country.

523
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,708
What do you mean?

524
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,625
Do you mean I don't look beautiful now?

525
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,998
- No, that's not what...
- Hi, miss. May I help you?

526
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,125
Wow! You look beautiful!

527
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,708
I like your style. Where are you from?

528
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,291
- India.
- Oh! Let me show you our collection.

529
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,666
Please!

530
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:22,458
Vijay.

531
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:25,833
No.

532
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:30,791
No.

533
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:33,750
No, Samyuktha.

534
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,291
Black doesn't suit you.

535
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:36,875
Let's go with Grey.

536
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,833
How do I look?

537
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,000
- Beautiful!
- Thank you.

538
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,458
I don't know how you would
look in a Grey dress,

539
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,625
but you look really gorgeous in black.

540
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,083
I'm happy.

541
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,083
The world is going to look
at you in a new way.

542
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:43,916
Thank you.

543
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,791
Manasa Samyuktha, shall we go?

544
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,458
<i>It's all quite new, these colors
Flow across the sky as a rainbow</i>

545
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:23,750
<i>Time is dragging its feet
Because it doesn't want to be shortened</i>

546
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:30,125
<i>You don't have to look back
On yesterday's tears</i>

547
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,541
<i>This endless unattainable happiness
Is all around you</i>

548
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:42,250
<i>Even if the paths have changed
The spring hasn't hidden itself</i>

549
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:47,708
<i>Let me explore this extension
Of friendship and try something new</i>

550
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:10,583
Thank you, Vijay.

551
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:15,791
I was very sad when I was
leaving India to come to the US.

552
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,291
But after knowing you,
I've become an entirely new person.

553
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,958
Thank you so much!

554
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,583
Coffee?

555
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,791
Coffee is not my cup of tea.

556
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,166
Thank you.

557
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,916
Will you at least say "cheers"?

558
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,375
Cheers!

559
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:55,250
<i>I am confused about
What I want to wish for</i>

560
00:42:55,833 --> 00:43:01,375
<i>When I am with you
I don't feel any kind of bitterness</i>

561
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,666
<i>I listen to the sweet music
Coming from the bamboo flute</i>

562
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,750
<i>I am looking at the corner of
My heart that houses immortality</i>

563
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:09,916
Wow!

564
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,400
This cup of tea tastes 100 times
better than a cup of coffee.

565
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:14,958
Superb!

566
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,833
<i>The darkness that's present in the east</i>

567
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,666
<i>Only dawn can make it disappear</i>

568
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,541
<i>This distance keeps shrinking
As we come together</i>

569
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:27,416
<i>I can feel the heat in this light</i>

570
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,625
How is it?

571
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,642
Do you remember?
When we'd met for the first time,

572
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,333
I had said that KSK Coffee is the best.

573
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,583
I was wrong.

574
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,083
- This is ten times better than that.
- True indeed!

575
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,041
Thank you.

576
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:44,541
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

577
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,625
Now, I'd like to announce
the topper of this trimester.

578
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,000
Miss Manasa Samyuktha!

579
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,916
<i>It's all quite new</i>

580
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Where are you off to?

581
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,875
Can't you see? I'm going for a jog.

582
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,083
Jog around the house!
Don't go elsewhere.

583
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:34,958
You will forget your way back.

584
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,875
Oh! Are you questioning my memory?

585
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,976
People used to say that I have
a very good memory and the knowledge of

586
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,809
each and every document in
all the cupboards of the bank,

587
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,434
the number of currency
notes in the locker,

588
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,666
and the amount of money in
each and everyone's account.

589
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,835
Just because I moved here, do you think
that will affect my memory, Vimala?

590
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,833
You remember all that,
but you forgot the most important thing.

591
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,291
- My name is not Vimala. It's Kamala.
- Oh!

592
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,575
So, you changed your name
after moving to a new country!

593
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,250
Don't hit yourself so hard.
You will suffer memory loss.

594
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,416
SWOT analysis is very important
before starting any business.

595
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:14,291
Listen.

596
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,958
This is important because of
the clear overview it provides.

597
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,625
What?

598
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,416
It is "SWOT."

599
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
"SWOT" means…

600
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,791
the strengths, the weaknesses,
the opportunities…

601
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,000
and the threats that exist in the market.

602
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:29,833
It's a self-analysis to understand
our situation.

603
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:33,208
Actually, this analysis is quite
useful in our lives as well.

604
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,583
How does that work?

605
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,000
Take my life as an example.

606
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,000
My decision to pursue my goal of
starting my business is my strength.

607
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,375
My inability to champion
my goals and dreams

608
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,416
in the company of my mother
and brother is my weakness.

609
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,333
The life that is ahead of me in the world
as big as ours, is my opportunity.

610
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,291
My insecurities about not
fulfilling my goals are my threats.

611
00:45:57,625 --> 00:46:00,958
Wow, Samyuktha! It'd have been great if
I had the same clarity of thoughts as you.

612
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:05,208
Despite the clarity I have,
nothing is ever in our control.

613
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,958
The toughest thing is to
put your ideas into action.

614
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,916
And that is what life is all about.

615
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,541
So, being positive is the best solution.

616
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,750
Samyuktha.

617
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,250
Yes, brother?

618
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,666
What's this?

619
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,916
Open it.

620
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:27,958
Wow, a watch!

621
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,625
I really wanted it.

622
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,208
Thank you, brother.

623
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,958
This is my favorite color.

624
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,958
Time is the most valuable
thing, Samyuktha.

625
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,291
This gift is to remind you the same.

626
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
How does it look?

627
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:42,458
It's very nice.

628
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:43,583
Thank you!

629
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,291
Here is your interview letter.

630
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,250
Go for this job interview tomorrow.

631
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:50,666
Alright?

632
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:54,916
Brother…

633
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:58,666
I know how important time is to you,
but I also value my time a lot.

634
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,208
I wouldn't like to waste my time on a job.

635
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:07,000
I have a goal in my life.

636
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,666
And you know that very well.

637
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,583
Samyuktha!

638
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,833
We enrolled you in an MBA course…

639
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,583
so that you can do what is
necessary for our family.

640
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,750
If you want to stay
with us in this house,

641
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,916
you must listen to me and do as I say.

642
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,250
It's your choice.

643
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,791
Mr. James Patrick… cabin one.

644
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,125
Mr. Peter Dillion… cabin two.

645
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,375
Mr. Goyal Gabeth… cabin three.

646
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:56,166
Miss Manasa Samyuktha,
please go to the cabin number four.

647
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,708
Excuse me, sir!

648
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,041
Hey, Samyuktha. What a sweet surprise!

649
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,916
Hey!

650
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,625
There won't be any interview for you.

651
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:16,958
You are selected!

652
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,000
Had you informed me earlier,
I'd have hired you right away.

653
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,958
Thanks…

654
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:27,458
but hire me only if you find me fit
for this job after interviewing me.

655
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,375
That would make me happy.

656
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,250
Well, Samyuktha.

657
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,541
I am well aware of your talent…

658
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,333
so I'll skip all the technical questions.

659
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:43,166
I will ask you only one general question.

660
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,184
There are three guys waiting outside to
crack this interview and get the job.

661
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:54,625
Why should I reject them and hire a woman
instead? Well… why should I hire you?

662
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,333
I am an MBA graduate.

663
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:05,416
I've been a topper right from my
nursery to my post-graduation.

664
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,416
That means… no guy ever surpassed me.

665
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,125
That means they did not surpass a woman.

666
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,708
Other than education,

667
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:16,583
there are many things that a girl
learns to do since her birth.

668
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:20,125
She does multitasking,
planning, organizing…

669
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,791
handling the house, protecting herself,

670
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:27,041
sharing love and affection, and whatnot!

671
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,708
No man can ever go through the pain that
a woman undergoes while giving birth.

672
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:34,833
According to a scientific research,

673
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:39,458
women are more mentally stable
than their male counterparts.

674
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:45,708
In business, men cannot surpass
the financial models put forth by women.

675
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:52,166
And when it comes to me,
I never waste my time.

676
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,166
That means I wouldn't
waste your time either.

677
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,416
If you hire me,

678
00:49:56,666 --> 00:50:01,000
I'll make sure that I perform better
than the best employee of this company.

679
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:06,958
So, hiring me is only advantageous
to you and you'll not regret it.

680
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,458
Wow!

681
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,125
Electrifying!

682
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,291
You are selected.

683
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,291
You can start working from tomorrow.

684
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,750
Make calls to all these people,

685
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:28,875
and close at least ten sales
by the end of the day. Okay?

686
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
Okay.

687
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,208
Okay.

688
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,583
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hi, I'm calling from Matrix Advertising.

689
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,750
- This is regarding an ad sale.
<i>- Okay.</i>

690
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:53,708
You can get the best space on the print,
web and digital media to place your ads.

691
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,416
Please, do let us know.

692
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:56,958
<i>Sorry, not interested.</i>

693
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,791
Thank you, have a nice day.

694
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,333
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hi, I'm calling from Matrix Advertising.

695
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,708
- This is...
<i>- Call me later.</i>

696
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,041
- Okay, thank you.
<i>- Hello.</i>

697
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,666
- Hi, I'm calling from...
<i>- Get lost.</i>

698
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,625
<i>Samyuktha, you need to impress
the customers by bluffing a little.</i>

699
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,017
<i>Samyuktha, we expect you
to perform nothing less than the best.</i>

700
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,801
<i>Good, Samyuktha.
I see that you are adapting.</i>

701
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,291
<i>Good job, Samyuktha. Keep going!</i>

702
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,791
<i>Great job, Samyuktha!
You are now the Employee of the Month.</i>

703
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:40,958
<i>Sitara…</i>

704
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:44,375
<i>those people from Vijayawada would like us
to give them our decision by tonight.</i>

705
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,000
Did I study hard since my
childhood, came to the USA…

706
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:52,208
and got a good job so that
I can quit it and get married, Mom?

707
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,708
<i>It is a very good match, Sitara.
Job is not a big deal.</i>

708
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:57,458
<i>Hurry up and come to India soon. See you.</i>

709
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,333
Sitara.

710
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,666
Is there any problem?

711
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,791
My mom had called me from India.

712
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,250
Apparently,
they've found a good guy for me.

713
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,708
But they don't want me to continue
my job after the marriage.

714
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:16,250
I don't know if I am supposed to feel
happy that they got me a good match…

715
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,125
or feel sad that I have
been told to quit my job.

716
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,416
How can that be a good wedding match

717
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,750
if they're asking you
to quit your job, Sitara?

718
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,083
They have so many conditions
even before you're married.

719
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,184
Imagine what's going to happen
after you get married.

720
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:32,541
Don't get swayed by what your mother says.
Consider what you want and then decide.

721
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,416
This is your life.

722
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:38,375
You are its owner,
founder and the sole proprietor.

723
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,708
Okay?

724
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:44,125
- Bye.
- Bye.

725
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,583
<i>You encourage others to live
their lives on their terms.</i>

726
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:53,375
<i>But are you really implementing that…</i>

727
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:55,500
<i>in your life?</i>

728
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:06,083
Grandpa, I don't know about that,

729
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:10,375
but I promise you that I will show
the world what a great man you are!

730
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,708
I will start my business, Dad.

731
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:31,541
The amount of hard work you put in
life is not the most important thing.

732
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,333
How happy you are in life is
the most important thing.

733
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,916
<i>Nothing matters if one is not
happy, Samyuktha.</i>

734
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,875
I am not happy with my job at all.

735
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:47,791
This is so sudden. Why, Samyuktha?

736
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:48,958
See.

737
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:53,333
A sale is a beautiful bond
between a customer and a seller.

738
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,625
I don't want to do it with the lies…

739
00:53:55,708 --> 00:54:00,250
adjustments and compromises.

740
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:01,875
Let's just lie and get it done.

741
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,934
I'll make sure that it'd seem
like an arranged marriage.

742
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:04,958
Okay.

743
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,458
We are just normal employees, Samyuktha.

744
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,833
We must work according to the policies
set down by the company.

745
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:17,375
Compromise is like a close friend
that pays us a visit every day.

746
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,458
A lie is like our neighbor.

747
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:24,208
And an adjustment is
a lover who never leaves us.

748
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,000
I hope you understand.

749
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Hey!

750
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,750
- Hey!
- How are you here so early today?

751
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,291
Is everything okay?

752
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,166
Yeah!

753
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,708
You've finished your targets, right?

754
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,291
Why don't your rest for a couple of days?

755
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,958
No, I am feeling better here.

756
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,166
Is there any problem at home?

757
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:16,375
My brother saw us together
at the restaurant.

758
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,583
And that has led to a ruckus at home.

759
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:26,291
Everything will go back
to normal in two days.

760
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,083
Don't overthink this.

761
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,291
My name is Vijay Anand.

762
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,375
I got acquainted with Miss Samyuktha
even before she joined our company.

763
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,333
Though I have everything in my life,

764
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,583
I got this feeling that I found
something that was missing in my life

765
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:05,125
since quite some time,
and that was because of her.

766
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:11,000
And when she joined our company,
every moment that I spent with her…

767
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,458
every single thing I got
to know about her,

768
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,125
has increased my liking
and respect toward her.

769
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,416
She also likes me…

770
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:25,125
but I don't think she will take
it further against your wishes.

771
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,458
That is why, she never said
anything about liking me.

772
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:32,500
If you approve… I would like to marry her.

773
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,666
I can understand your fears as a mother.

774
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,291
I grew up without a mother.

775
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,125
If you approve…

776
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,416
I promise to treat her as
the most important woman in my life.

777
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:54,416
I am sure I will take good care of her.

778
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,791
Trust me.

779
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:03,833
Samyuktha.

780
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:10,458
When Arjun said that
he saw you with a guy,

781
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,916
I was really anxious.

782
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:18,041
But after he spoke to us,
I understood that he is a decent guy.

783
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,208
Vijay had come here in the morning…

784
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,883
and he convinced us to
get you married to him.

785
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,750
Vijay is in love with you.

786
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:29,250
You are lucky to find a guy like him.

787
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:35,708
We have decided to look for an auspicious
day and get both of you married.

788
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,125
Samyuktha…

789
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,166
The Queen that is supposed to be
trapped has now checkmated the King.

790
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,833
<i>My little world</i>

791
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:57,333
<i>Has slipped through my fingers</i>

792
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Hello!

793
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,500
Why so serious?

794
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,666
You came to my home today
and talked about our marriage, right?

795
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,041
- I was just thinking about that.
- But why do you seem so serious?

796
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,833
You should be happy, right?

797
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,083
Vijay, I don't know what to tell
you or rather, how to tell you this.

798
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:19,500
To put it in a simple way,
I don't want to get married now.

799
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,041
Do you not want to get married?
Or do you not want to get married to me?

800
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,416
Vijay, let's not complicate things.
I just don't want to get married.

801
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:35,458
Samyuktha, do you know what
you are talking about?

802
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,291
It was so difficult for me to
convince your family members.

803
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,791
You can't do this now!

804
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,416
It'd have been better if you had spoken
to me first, before you spoke to them.

805
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,601
Just because you took the efforts
to convince them,

806
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,250
I cannot marry you against my wishes!

807
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:52,184
I was under the impression that
you'd abide your family's decision.

808
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,333
How can their wishes be mine?

809
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,625
This is my life.

810
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,791
At this moment,
I don't wish to get married.

811
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:58,916
But why?

812
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,500
Why, Samyuktha?

813
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,708
Marriage is a huge responsibility.

814
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,583
There is a difference between being
single and being with someone.

815
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:23,541
A lot of things and priorities change.

816
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:28,833
There are a lot of things that I need
to accomplish… before I get married.

817
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,166
What are those?

818
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,125
Everyone has a purpose in life.

819
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,208
And everyone is talented
in one way or another.

820
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:36,833
You, I… everyone!

821
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,916
I believe when a person understands
this, that is when his life truly begins.

822
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:47,583
I want to use my talents
and achieve something in my life.

823
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,875
Samyuktha!

824
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,208
I've been keeping a secret
from you since many days.

825
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,500
But I think it's time I tell you this.

826
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,541
The company that you've been
working for is my father's.

827
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:02,750
Which means, it is mine as well…
but I like to lead a simple life.

828
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:06,458
That is why, I've been working as
a manager instead of a managing director.

829
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:10,666
If you marry me,
you would also have a partnership in that.

830
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:17,041
In my opinion, I don't think you need
to achieve anything more than this.

831
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:21,000
Thanks… but I don't want all that!

832
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,250
I want to achieve things

833
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:25,013
by doing everything on my terms
and in the field I am interested in.

834
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:28,708
Money can only bring us happiness…

835
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,250
but when we pursue the things we like,
it leaves us with beautiful experiences.

836
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,750
You are not the same Samyuktha that I had
met months ago. You have changed a lot.

837
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,333
I've always been like this, Vijay.

838
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,666
It's just that you started
knowing me recently.

839
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:47,083
There are hundreds of girls who are
ready to get married to me happily.

840
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:49,416
But why I got attracted to you is because

841
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,458
I always wanted a simple
life and a simple wife.

842
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:56,250
But after knowing your plans today,
I understand that you aren't simple…

843
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,208
but a very complicated person.

844
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:03,291
I am going to end this right
here right now. Goodbye!

845
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,666
One minute, Vijay.

846
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:10,309
By the time you get to the office, you'll
find my resignation letter on your table.

847
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,625
<i>My little world</i>

848
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,000
<i>Has slipped through my fingers</i>

849
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:20,500
<i>The bright light</i>

850
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:25,083
<i>Of my dreams has disappeared</i>

851
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:30,833
Samyuktha, wait!

852
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,041
What is with your unreasonable behavior?

853
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:37,517
If you've already decided
that my behavior is unreasonable,

854
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,833
- anything I say would not matter.
- Correct!

855
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,958
Why did you say that you
don't want to marry Vijay?

856
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,208
Because I am not interested.

857
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,208
I am asking you the reason.

858
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,434
He told you that I'm not interested
in him, but didn't he tell you why?

859
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,583
Did you realize that after
dating for six months?

860
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,476
Or did you find someone
who is wealthier than him?

861
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,333
You might stoop so low for the sake
of money, but I won't do that.

862
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,416
- Hey!
- Samyuktha.

863
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:58,916
What's with that arrogance?
He is your elder brother.

864
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,250
And I am his sister. It would be better
if both of you realize that fact.

865
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:07,750
What does Vijay lack that you
felt he's not suitable for you?

866
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,583
Will we ever find a better guy than him?

867
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,333
Mom, I am your daughter!

868
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,416
How long will you consider the other
people better than your own children?

869
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,642
Stop thinking about getting
better guys for your daughter!

870
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,892
You should think they should be worthy
of getting married to your daughter!

871
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:20,958
I will be happy about it!

872
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,291
You're saying this very casually now.

873
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,625
But you'd know the burden
and responsibility of a daughter…

874
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:29,458
only when you give birth
to one and raise her.

875
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,166
Some people feel they're
lucky if they have a daughter.

876
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,416
And there are some,
who think of them as a burden.

877
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,125
And I am ashamed that
you are one of them.

878
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,583
Samyuktha, you are crossing the limits!

879
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:42,833
I wanted you to marry Vijay
so that you have an easy life!

880
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,583
If you have any sort of
respect for me, marry him.

881
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,333
I don't want to get married without
achieving something in my life.

882
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:55,583
You had a dream of becoming a doctor…

883
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:57,708
but you were pressured
into marriage by your family

884
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,708
and your dream remained unfulfilled.

885
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,000
And post marriage, your life has just
been about your husband and children!

886
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,125
What do you want to do?

887
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,125
Business.

888
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,208
Samyuktha…

889
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,958
I have told you numerous times…

890
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,559
to remove the thought of
starting a business from your mind.

891
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,041
All these days,
I just did the things as per your wish.

892
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,125
But from now on, I'll do what I want!
That's it!

893
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,625
Samyuktha…

894
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:24,666
you are living in a fantasy world,
and it is very far from reality.

895
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,916
You are a girl…
and we are living in the USA.

896
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,166
You come from a normal
middle-class family.

897
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:34,166
Unless you and your brother do
a job, we can't make our ends meet.

898
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,541
In such a case, doing a business...

899
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:38,500
Even if you start a business,

900
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,375
what is the guarantee
that you would succeed?

901
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,625
There isn't a guarantee for all the great
things that happen in this world.

902
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,434
They work because of the conviction.
That's it.

903
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,791
I don't have any faith in it.

904
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:49,875
I am least bothered about someone's
faith and belief. I'll do what I want.

905
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:54,416
It's alright if you don't want
to support me. Just don't get in my way.

906
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,666
I have been supporting
our family for long…

907
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,750
and now, you're telling me
not to get in your way.

908
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,583
If I leave this house,
I will never get in your way.

909
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,791
Why aren't you saying directly that
you want to move in with your girlfriend?

910
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:22,208
Stop!

911
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:25,333
Why are you accusing your brother

912
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:28,583
when you wanted to do something of
your own against everyone's wishes?

913
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:31,958
Yes! You'd never realize
the facts that I put forth.

914
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,041
He is about to get
married to his girlfriend

915
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,726
by making it seem like
an arranged marriage.

916
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,083
Ask him if this is a lie!

917
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,375
I need not stay at a place
where I am not respected.

918
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,375
There is no need for
anyone to go out of this house!

919
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,250
I was the one who caused this
problem, so I'll move out.

920
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:58,541
<i>Am I confronting the question?</i>

921
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:01,750
<i>Can I ignore it despite
Knowing the truth?</i>

922
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,541
The day you'd realize my worth…
I shall return to this house.

923
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,958
<i>I've been waiting for that</i>

924
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:12,250
<i>When you wait, your future calls you</i>

925
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,708
<i>What's yours will always be yours</i>

926
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:18,458
<i>It wouldn't go away</i>

927
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:28,416
Samyuktha… why did you ask
us to come here so suddenly?

928
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,916
I walked out of my house.

929
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:40,916
I quit my job and broke
up with Vijay as well.

930
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,291
What are you saying?

931
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,833
- Why?
- To start a business.

932
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:47,458
Business?

933
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,208
What business are you talking about?

934
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,708
Chai. Our Indian chai.

935
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,875
In India, chai is as important as petrol.

936
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:07,625
People don't spend a day
without having a cup of chai.

937
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:11,375
People drink chai when they're happy, sad,

938
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:16,541
angry, irritated and on other occasions.

939
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,916
And this place has been
accustomed to coffee.

940
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:23,041
They don't know the value
or the taste of chai.

941
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,416
And we must be the first ones
to introduce the taste of chai to them.

942
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,250
I need both of you to help me.

943
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,791
What? Do you want us to sell chai?

944
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:36,125
Coffee is sold at a very exorbitant
price in the entire country.

945
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,458
So, we should sell chai as well.

946
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,458
Come on, Samyuktha. Stop joking.

947
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:44,000
Establishing a business
requires a lot of planning.

948
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,958
Moreover, this is very risky, Samyuktha.

949
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:49,041
If this idea doesn't work out,

950
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,583
our time, effort and money
will be wasted.

951
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,208
Every successful business
has potential risks.

952
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,916
Success can't be achieved
without taking risks.

953
01:06:58,166 --> 01:06:59,934
And if it is achieved without
taking risks, it doesn't last long.

954
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,541
I know that this will
be a successful plan.

955
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,500
I am sorry, Samyuktha. I can't help you.

956
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,208
Chai? What is chai?

957
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,666
Chai is an Indian version of tea!

958
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,990
- A cup of chai makes everything better.
- No, thank you.

959
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:32,934
Would you like to have some chai?

960
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,375
- Not interested.
- It's Indian tea.

961
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,666
Hi. Would you like to have some chai?

962
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:37,750
You should try this.

963
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,916
Hey! Would you like to have some chai?

964
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,041
- No.
- It's delicious.

965
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,458
Hi! Would you like to have some chai?

966
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,708
What is chai?

967
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,375
Chai is an Indian version of tea!

968
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:48,500
You'll love it.

969
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:53,225
- Superb! I like it.
- Thank you so much.

970
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:55,875
Who gave you the permission
to put this here? Get out right now.

971
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,642
- Why are you…
- Sir, nobody made any mistake.

972
01:07:58,666 --> 01:07:59,851
- Remove it.
- I'm just making tea.

973
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,583
Sir, please understand. This is my life.

974
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,875
Sir, please!

975
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,041
Sir, please!

976
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,833
Sir, please understand!
I'm not making any mistake.

977
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:08,916
- Please!
- Move.

978
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:14,791
Let's go, Mom.

979
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,541
If you give me 25 yards of your space,

980
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:32,125
I can give you a 25 percent
cut from my profit.

981
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:33,666
No, I'm sorry.

982
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:36,625
- Thank you.
- Alright.

983
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:45,958
So, if you give me 30 yards
of space in your hotel,

984
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,791
I can give you a 30 percent
cut from my profit.

985
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,500
No, I'm sorry.

986
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,083
But why don't you meet Mr. Kailash?

987
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:57,250
He is the owner and founder of
KSK Coffee Chain and Group of Companies.

988
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:59,833
He is also an Indian.
Maybe, he can help you.

989
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:02,958
Thank you.

990
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,541
Yes. May I help you?

991
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:20,458
Hi, I would like to meet
the Managing Director, Mr. Kailash.

992
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,208
Do you have an appointment?

993
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,541
- No.
- Sorry, ma'am. It's not possible.

994
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:30,331
Just tell him that he might miss out on
an opportunity if he doesn't meet me.

995
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,583
Wait a second.

996
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:40,708
Sir, but she says you are going
to miss out on an opportunity

997
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,125
if you don't meet her.

998
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,416
I'll build an office
just like this someday.

999
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:45,833
Okay.

1000
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:56,875
Sure, sir.

1001
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,750
Please, wait in the hallway.

1002
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,291
Thank you.

1003
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:16,041
Hi.

1004
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
Hello.

1005
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,083
Whom do you want to meet?

1006
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:26,166
Wow! You are an Indian,
but you look like an American.

1007
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,625
Is that a compliment or a complaint?

1008
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,875
It's a compliment, sir.

1009
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,875
My grandfather always used to say,
"Be a Roman in Rome."

1010
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:35,916
Well, you didn't tell me
whom you want to meet.

1011
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:39,351
I am looking for Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar,
the Managing Director of this company.

1012
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,791
I heard that he is also an Indian.

1013
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,416
May I know the purpose of your visit?

1014
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,208
- I am here with a business proposal.
- Oh! Do you have an appointment?

1015
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:50,208
The receptionist asked
me the same question.

1016
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:53,250
There are way too many formalities
for a person to meet another person.

1017
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:59,291
Rolex watch, polished shoes,
smart dressing.

1018
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,833
Seems like you are here
to meet someone, as well.

1019
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:04,416
Do you have an appointment?

1020
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,541
Does Kailash need
an appointment to meet Kailash?

1021
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:14,708
The owner and founder of
KSK Coffee Chain and Group of Companies.

1022
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,416
The winner of three
"Business Man of the Year" awards.

1023
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,625
The one and only Indian to top
the American Entrepreneurs list.

1024
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:31,500
And he's above all the busiest persons you
must have come across in your life ever!

1025
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,583
Kailash Shiva Kumar.

1026
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,583
An appointment is a simple rule

1027
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:50,791
to ensure that a person spends
his valuable time wisely.

1028
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Well…

1029
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:54,625
I was told that I'd miss out on

1030
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,666
a wonderful opportunity
if you don't meet me.

1031
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:03,708
And after looking at your beauty…

1032
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,270
I felt I shouldn't miss out on
this opportunity and appointment.

1033
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,666
- Thanks for the compliment.
- Welcome.

1034
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,916
- Manasa Samyuktha.
- Nice name. Sit.

1035
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,375
Congratulations for
building such a huge empire.

1036
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,833
And thanks for being an example for
the people who aspire to become like you.

1037
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:22,916
Samyuktha…

1038
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:26,583
I've always wanted my life
to be a source of mystery.

1039
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,875
But I never thought of
becoming an example to others.

1040
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:35,375
How an Indian became so successful in
America should remain a mystery,

1041
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:39,208
but my life shouldn't
simply be an example…

1042
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,458
for the people to attain this position.

1043
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,291
Well, what is your business plan?

1044
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:49,958
Here.

1045
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:08,991
So, if you could lend me
some space in your coffee shop,

1046
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,666
it would benefit both you and me.

1047
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:13,833
I am more impressed by your
presentation rather than your product.

1048
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,375
Remember two things.

1049
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,625
Samyuktha and Kailash might go together…

1050
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,083
but coffee and tea
would never go together.

1051
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:31,875
Secondly… America is a land of coffee.

1052
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:33,833
So, tea has no place here.

1053
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,416
Creating that place is the opportunity
that I am looking for.

1054
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,583
One should look at

1055
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,750
the necessity of the product in the market
before looking at an opportunity.

1056
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,333
No one here even likes to taste tea.

1057
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,833
People here love my coffee.

1058
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,375
Here, my coffee gives them
the best form of relief.

1059
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:56,791
I am sorry to say this…

1060
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,833
but so far, the people
who have tasted my tea…

1061
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:04,375
have complimented me saying that it gives
them more relief than your coffee does.

1062
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,458
What?

1063
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,708
Did people really say that…

1064
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:10,875
the tea made by an Indian girl
tastes better than my KSK coffee?

1065
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:14,416
- Very funny!
- What's so funny about that, sir?

1066
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,000
They told me what they felt.

1067
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:20,791
If you want, I would like to prepare
tea for you right now!

1068
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:23,916
- Would you like to taste it?
- Sure, but not now.

1069
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:28,666
I'll taste it the day you attain my
stature after starting your business.

1070
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,750
Sure.

1071
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:31,916
It is not about attaining your stature…

1072
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,708
but I'll work hard to increase
the scale of my business.

1073
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:42,166
And in this process, my fate will decide
whether I would attain your stature…

1074
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:45,125
or I'd surpass it.

1075
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,083
All the best.

1076
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,875
I hope you don't have to face
any obstacles from my end.

1077
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,125
I'm writing you a check
for a thousand dollars.

1078
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,375
It's for miscellaneous expenses.

1079
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:07,791
I'll be waiting to taste your tea.

1080
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,041
Sure.

1081
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:16,541
A thousand dollars might
be a small amount to you…

1082
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:20,125
but I know what can be achieved with
this money, and I'll certainly show you.

1083
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,125
Hot!

1084
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,791
Move. A little more. Stay!

1085
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,125
Hey, Samyuktha.

1086
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,000
Hey, how are you?

1087
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,416
What's all this?

1088
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:35,625
I might not be able to start a business
with the little amount I have…

1089
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:39,791
but I can advertise about
it with that amount.

1090
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:43,166
That is why, I've decided
to perform a chai ceremony.

1091
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,708
Our tea culture is not a modern one.

1092
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,708
It dates back 5,000 years.

1093
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:51,666
Monks like Bodhidharma used to organize
a chai ceremony in those days.

1094
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,208
A great scholar used to invite…

1095
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:57,750
his students and other scholars
to his place for a cup of tea.

1096
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:01,333
The people gathered at his place used
to feel pleased to drink the tea,

1097
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,416
meditate and go back to their place.
After going back to their place,

1098
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,041
they used to spread the word
about the chai ceremony to others

1099
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:10,208
and bring them next time to the ceremony.

1100
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:15,375
Tomorrow, I am going to go around
and tell them about the chai ceremony

1101
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:17,458
and invite them to the ceremony.

1102
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:24,833
If we get to make the avid
chai drinkers taste our chai,

1103
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,000
they'll spread the word about it
to those who don't know about it.

1104
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,625
Hi.

1105
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,916
Please, do come to my chai ceremony.

1106
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,583
Chai? What is chai?

1107
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:40,500
Please, attend to know more about it.

1108
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,125
I will try.

1109
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,291
Thank you.

1110
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,583
- What's this?
- It is a chai ceremony.

1111
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,583
Oh, I'll be there for sure.

1112
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,750
Thank you.

1113
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:04,833
You possess the talent to earn
thousands of dollars.

1114
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:09,833
Why would you waste your life…
selling tea for ten dollars?

1115
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:15,250
You can see my hard work, but you can't
see the fact that my heart is in it.

1116
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,666
Our neighbor, Sujatha, saw you
selling your tea on the road.

1117
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,708
Disgusting! I've been
embarrassed by her behavior.

1118
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,708
Talking to her is of no use, Mom!

1119
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,458
Look, there's still time.

1120
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,208
You can still leave all
that behind and come home.

1121
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:36,291
Point number one.

1122
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,503
As long as we haven't done anything
wrong, there is no need to feel guilty

1123
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:41,583
or embarrassed about anything.

1124
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:42,666
Point number two.

1125
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,208
I wasn't shouting on the road…

1126
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:46,416
I was trying to sell my product.

1127
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:47,625
Point number three.

1128
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:50,958
Just because our neighbor
thinks it's wrong,

1129
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,250
I am not going to stop myself
from doing what I want.

1130
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,583
You might not understand
my words or deeds.

1131
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:01,166
But I will wait for the day when
you'd properly understand me.

1132
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:11,208
Hey… chai ceremony!

1133
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,416
Nice concept, dear!

1134
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,958
You are trying to introduce the concept
of chai to a foreign country.

1135
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:19,750
It's really great.

1136
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:21,500
I am proud of her.

1137
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Thank you.

1138
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,291
What's your name?

1139
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:25,791
Manasa Samyuktha.

1140
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,458
Nice! What does your father do?

1141
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,083
Go inside.

1142
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,125
Someone like our daughter
is trying to sell chai.

1143
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,767
- Okay. Get inside.
- Shouldn't we support her?

1144
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,125
I'll definitely come, dear.

1145
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:44,458
<i>Hello, folks.</i>

1146
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,226
<i>An Indian girl named
Manasa Samyuktha is organizing</i>

1147
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:50,333
<i>an event called "Chai ceremony" at
7:00 p.m. this Saturday at Royal Theater.</i>

1148
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,083
<i>Make sure you attend it.
It's going to be amazing.</i>

1149
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:54,708
<i>Meanwhile, enjoy the song.</i>

1150
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,666
Hello, everyone.

1151
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:16,375
Namaste.

1152
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:18,416
My name is Manasa Samyuktha.

1153
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,184
I welcome all those Indians who have come
here because they were specially invited,

1154
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:23,416
and all those Americans
who have come here…

1155
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,000
out of their interest.

1156
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:29,041
I don't intend to waste your time.

1157
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:31,458
I will finish the last line of my speech

1158
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:33,875
before you finish
the last sip of your tea.

1159
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,333
I have a very special
relationship with tea.

1160
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,833
Whenever I suffered from cold,
cough or fever during my childhood,

1161
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:47,208
I used to have tea made by my grandfather.

1162
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,166
He was an Ayurvedic doctor.

1163
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,708
He was a great intellectual
who believed that all ailments

1164
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:54,166
could be treated with tea.

1165
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,291
It's been a year since I moved to America.

1166
01:20:56,875 --> 01:21:02,083
People generally claim that America is
the most developed country in the world.

1167
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,666
The most surprising thing
about this country is that

1168
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,375
there is no Indian chai available here.

1169
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:09,708
You won't find it anywhere
even if you search for it.

1170
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:14,125
That is why, I have decided
to start my chai business here.

1171
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,791
But we have green tea here.

1172
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:19,458
That's green tea.
I'm talking about Indian chai.

1173
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,500
One of which you are tasting right now.

1174
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,041
Yeah. This is supreme!

1175
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,291
Nothing like it.

1176
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,291
Thank you! Coming back to the point…

1177
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:33,666
my intention is to introduce the greatness
of the Indian culture to America

1178
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,791
through the chai business
which I am going to start.

1179
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:42,208
That is why, I'd consider this as
a responsibility rather than a business.

1180
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:44,875
Very nice! My name is Krishna Murthy.

1181
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:48,416
Though I am an Indian,
I was born and raised here.

1182
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,375
So, I am not very familiar with the tea.

1183
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:54,083
Could you tell us what's
so great about that?

1184
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,500
Sure.

1185
01:21:56,666 --> 01:22:02,500
In India, most of the people can't
spend a day without having chai.

1186
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:04,601
Right from the working-class
people to the lawyers,

1187
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,500
from the students to the scientists,

1188
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,666
and from the children to the old folks…

1189
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:14,500
everyone has chai to get relief from
the work stress and tensions in life.

1190
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:19,166
Chai provides answers to many questions.
It provides solutions to many problems.

1191
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,208
That's its greatness.

1192
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:28,000
Don't you think it should
be available in America?

1193
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,250
Yes, it should be available.

1194
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:32,125
- Yes, it should be available.
- Yes, it should be available.

1195
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,059
- Yes, it should be available.
- Yes, it should be available.

1196
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,708
If you think it should be available,
I need your help.

1197
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:41,416
If you really liked my chai,
buy a packet which is over there.

1198
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,791
And those who would buy it,

1199
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,500
kindly share your experience
with your friends and relatives.

1200
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:47,500
That is the help which you could offer me.

1201
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,500
But Miss Samyuktha, what brand is it?

1202
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,458
Miss India!

1203
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:06,083
I am thankful that you have come this far
to see me and listened to me patiently.

1204
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,375
Thank you!

1205
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,250
Well, you didn't tell
me how my chai tasted.

1206
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,041
- Superb!
- Superb!

1207
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,083
Thank you.

1208
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:17,708
- That was a really great chai ceremony.
- Thank you.

1209
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,833
I've worked on a lot of businesses
and I've started quite a few as well.

1210
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,375
But you are the only person I saw

1211
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:25,791
who's publicizing a business in
an aesthetic and poetic way.

1212
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:28,958
- Thank you so much, sir.
- A big business always starts small.

1213
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,291
Good luck.

1214
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:31,958
- Can I get one?
- Sure, sir.

1215
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:36,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

1216
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,416
Here is my card.

1217
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,250
Just in case if you need any help.

1218
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,583
Sure. Thank you so much, sir.

1219
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,416
Oh! Please, call me Vikram!

1220
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,708
- Thank you, Vikram.
- Cool!

1221
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,666
- See you.
- Bye.

1222
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:46,750
Bye.

1223
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,875
<i>We really didn't know how serious
you were about your business</i>

1224
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:54,458
<i>until we saw the success
of your chai ceremony.</i>

1225
01:23:54,541 --> 01:23:56,833
<i>From now onward,
we will stand by you, Samyuktha.</i>

1226
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:57,916
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1227
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:02,125
America is the most
happening place in the world.

1228
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,416
We need a good spot to launch
our Miss India product.

1229
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,875
Nayana, could you tell me how much
it'd cost to launch this product?

1230
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:13,125
It would roughly cost half
a million dollars, Samyuktha!

1231
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,041
It'd cost three crores
as per our currency.

1232
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,166
We need a really good investor.

1233
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,750
Someone who trusts us.

1234
01:24:21,333 --> 01:24:23,500
Someone who has faith in our business.

1235
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:25,375
Vikram!

1236
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:28,833
Yes. Didn't you say that he was
impressed by your chai ceremony?

1237
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:31,791
He is the President of
the Indian Entrepreneurs Association.

1238
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,351
Before that, he was a venture capitalist.

1239
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:36,833
He has encouraged a lot of
people to start their business.

1240
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,791
If we ask him for help,
he might help us.

1241
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:39,875
Yeah.

1242
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:43,333
Miss Samyuktha is here to see you.

1243
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:54,500
Hey, Samyuktha! What a pleasant surprise!

1244
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,625
- Hello, Vikram.
- Please, sit down.

1245
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:01,125
By the way,
didn't my people serve you anything?

1246
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:04,375
Any soft drink or Miss India special chai?

1247
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:09,166
Actually, I don't think your
guys can offer me what I want.

1248
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,375
What is it?

1249
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,958
The investment for launching
Miss India will cost three crores.

1250
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:17,281
- If you could invest in our company…
- What would I get?

1251
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:20,958
We guarantee you a minimum of
25 percent profit per year.

1252
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:26,083
As per that, we'll return your money
along with the interest in four years.

1253
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,416
How are you so sure that…

1254
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,916
your brand-new product will be a success?

1255
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:35,916
You've tried it, so you should tell
us whether it will be a success or no.

1256
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,666
Do you know any such success story?

1257
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,208
No.

1258
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,541
You are not associated with
any other big brands,

1259
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:45,684
and there isn't a company that has
launched something similar to yours.

1260
01:25:45,708 --> 01:25:47,958
There isn't a necessity for
your product in the market.

1261
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:54,166
The possibility of your business
becoming a success is just 0,1 percent.

1262
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:59,416
I started with nothing, so I'd consider
0,1 percent possibility a good sign.

1263
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:03,083
Because… this is my dream.

1264
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,291
Forgive me, Samyuktha!

1265
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:08,875
Money should not be spent
on dreams and desires!

1266
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:17,791
But I saw your perseverance
and determination.

1267
01:26:18,416 --> 01:26:24,083
So, I'll set my business rules aside
and invest in your business.

1268
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,916
But there's one condition.

1269
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:30,916
If your year's profit is even one
percent less than what you have said,

1270
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,666
you must return all my money
along with the interest.

1271
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:38,208
And you must sell your company to me.

1272
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,083
If you agree,
we can start signing the agreement papers.

1273
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,791
Get the money ready for the investment.

1274
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:29,166
<i>Every morning stands as
A ramp for your success</i>

1275
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:34,250
<i>You can't reach your destination if you
Move in random directions like the wind</i>

1276
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:39,333
<i>Every minute doesn't reveal it
But the next moment is not a myth either</i>

1277
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:44,375
<i>When courage is your consort
There is no scope for defeat</i>

1278
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:47,666
- This is for you.
- Wow! This is fantastic, Preethi.

1279
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,166
A good poster creates a good
impression about a movie.

1280
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:54,375
Similarly, a good logo creates
a great impact for a business.

1281
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:59,333
<i>The dictionary doesn't explain
The meaning of unanswered aspirations</i>

1282
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:01,833
<i>The unwritten tomorrow is the only thing</i>

1283
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:05,833
<i>That stands in your way</i>

1284
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,708
<i>Appreciation for your courage would
Be given forever by every generation</i>

1285
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,666
<i>Won't the sunlight fight
And win over the darkness?</i>

1286
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:20,875
<i>Appreciation for your courage would
Be given forever by every generation</i>

1287
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:25,708
<i>Won't the sunlight fight
And win over the darkness?</i>

1288
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:29,250
<i>For the first time in
the history of America,</i>

1289
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:32,625
<i>an Indian woman starts a business
called "Miss India" with Indian chai.</i>

1290
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,458
<i>Let's wait and see what she can do.</i>

1291
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:42,458
<i>Every morning stands as
A ramp for your success</i>

1292
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:47,541
<i>You can't reach your destination if you
Move in random directions like the wind</i>

1293
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,208
So, the day has finally come.

1294
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:56,458
The beginning of a new era…
of chai in the United States of America.

1295
01:28:57,583 --> 01:28:58,625
Thank you, Vikram.

1296
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:00,250
You are the reason behind all this.

1297
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,642
We are launching Miss India
the day after tomorrow.

1298
01:29:02,666 --> 01:29:04,125
You are our chief guest.

1299
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,791
Me? What do you mean?

1300
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:10,791
Talent and willpower aren't
enough to achieve what we dream of.

1301
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:13,791
We also need the people who
believe in us and support us.

1302
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,000
And I understood that when I met you.

1303
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:21,208
You have turned my dream
of Miss India into a reality.

1304
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,291
So, who would make
a better chief guest than you?

1305
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:31,708
I struggled a lot for
the money in my life.

1306
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,916
I even helped a lot of
people with the money.

1307
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,333
Despite all that, I still suffered
from some dissatisfaction in life.

1308
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,083
But today…

1309
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:44,416
I am able to realize
the greatness of my work

1310
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,500
and the real purpose of my life.

1311
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,208
This is because of you.

1312
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:50,541
Thank you so much!

1313
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:52,333
I will be there.

1314
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,708
Don't worry.

1315
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,218
Not because I was
invited as the chief guest,

1316
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,833
but because my friend has invited me.

1317
01:29:58,958 --> 01:29:59,958
Thank you.

1318
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:48,208
Miss India…
I think we should taste the chai here.

1319
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:52,000
Chai? No, let's go to KSK please.

1320
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:28,375
Jingle!

1321
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,375
Oh.

1322
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,875
- Is she your pet?
- Yeah.

1323
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,166
So cute.

1324
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,833
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Is her name Jingle?

1325
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,375
- Jingle. Yes.
- Nice.

1326
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:40,666
Now that you are here,
would you like to taste our chai?

1327
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,416
- We just started today.
- Sure.

1328
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:44,958
- Okay.
- Yeah, please have a seat.

1329
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,041
Thank you.

1330
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:50,500
There you go.
This is our special Indian chai.

1331
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,125
Nice!

1332
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,333
- Amazing!
- Thank you.

1333
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:01,916
I'll keep coming from tomorrow.

1334
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,916
Thank you! It would be our pleasure.

1335
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,208
See you, Jingle.

1336
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,125
- Here is your tandoori chai.
- Thank you!

1337
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:29,291
- Hey.
- Give me five minutes.

1338
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:31,166
Okay.

1339
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:37,083
As usual… he's saying he needs
five minutes to flirt with her.

1340
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,750
Hey… if you don't mind me asking…

1341
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,000
you like her, don't you?

1342
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,791
What's stopping you from talking to her?

1343
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:07,166
My voice.

1344
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,708
Would you talk to her if
your voice gets better?

1345
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:14,333
Give me five minutes.

1346
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,791
Indian special!

1347
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,000
What is happening?

1348
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,666
What is this tea magic?

1349
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,625
Indian special magic!

1350
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:55,458
The credit goes to the great Indian
woman and her beautiful chai.

1351
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,125
Here is your love chai.

1352
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,333
- Thank you.
- You are welcome!

1353
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:36,791
Ladies and gentlemen,

1354
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:38,583
welcome to the Miss India family.

1355
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:42,083
We are very glad to conduct our
first board of directors meeting.

1356
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And now, please welcome our
Managing Director, Miss Manasa Samyuktha.

1357
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:04,875
<i>The silence will break when
Your struggle will make the sound</i>

1358
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,416
<i>The opposition will crumble</i>

1359
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:11,625
<i>When you'll fight the war
With your silence</i>

1360
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:36,541
<i>Every morning stands as
A ramp for your success</i>

1361
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:41,458
<i>Won't the sunlight fight
And win over the darkness?</i>

1362
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:46,541
<i>Every morning stands as
A ramp for your success</i>

1363
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:51,875
<i>Won't the sunlight fight
And win over the darkness?</i>

1364
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:56,333
It is a great privilege
to be a part of this family.

1365
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:58,500
We shall conquer the world soon.

1366
01:35:58,625 --> 01:35:59,625
Thank you.

1367
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,000
Coffee is our competition
in this business.

1368
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:04,041
We should take over them and crush them.

1369
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,125
I appreciate it…

1370
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:07,833
but we should be our only competitors.

1371
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,625
If we better ourselves
every second and move ahead…

1372
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:13,083
we shall be on the top eventually.

1373
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:15,041
You are truly a Miss India.

1374
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,891
You came from some remote part of India,

1375
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,541
and now, you are going to rule
the American business world.

1376
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:20,958
Simply great!

1377
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,375
I only have one goal.

1378
01:36:22,916 --> 01:36:25,208
Brands such as McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks

1379
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:28,125
started small in some remote areas,

1380
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:30,083
but today, they've become global brands.

1381
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,541
Miss India should become a brand as well.

1382
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:36,041
Everyone in America must know this brand.

1383
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:39,416
Miss India is not about me.

1384
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,458
Miss India is a brand.

1385
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,541
Samyuktha.

1386
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:26,791
This woman is the reason
for our today's meeting.

1387
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:30,583
She started a business with chai.

1388
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:34,958
It was a company that didn't
even have a dollar as a turnover.

1389
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,583
And now, it is at a stage
where it is competing with us.

1390
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:44,041
If we don't control Miss India,

1391
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:47,083
it will surpass the KSK brand someday.

1392
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:50,375
Any ideas?

1393
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,458
Seasonal sales offers?

1394
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,291
Celebrity brand ambassador?

1395
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,041
Cross promotions, sir?

1396
01:37:58,166 --> 01:37:59,166
Discounts?

1397
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:03,041
Offering discount means sabotaging
the value of our own product.

1398
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:05,666
Price fall of our product
means our downfall.

1399
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:08,208
And we can't afford to have the downfall.

1400
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,500
We should lure the customers.

1401
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,416
A woman should be taken
down by another woman.

1402
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:20,000
Make sure our KSK outlets
have hot girls every Saturday.

1403
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:23,791
Every coffee that's ordered should
be served by a bikini-clad woman.

1404
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,017
Put an offer stating that the one
who pays the highest bill

1405
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:28,750
would get a chance to take a selfie
with the woman of their choice.

1406
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,250
For every guy who works
hard the entire week…

1407
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:35,916
KSK outlets should become their
only form of weekend entertainment.

1408
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:38,833
That way, we can target the Americans…

1409
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:42,083
as well as the Indians who are
the prime base for Miss India.

1410
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,166
We'd target all of them
to lure them toward us.

1411
01:38:45,625 --> 01:38:48,250
Not only that, come up with a lucky draw.

1412
01:38:48,916 --> 01:38:50,458
Announce the prize money of…

1413
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:54,375
one million dollars to the lucky
winners who drink our coffee.

1414
01:38:54,666 --> 01:38:56,791
Wow! You are a genius, Kailash!

1415
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,083
So, it's not going to be
a Saturday from now on.

1416
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:02,375
It's going to be a KSK.

1417
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,333
- And here's your golden chai.
- Thank you.

1418
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:40,500
- You can give the KSK bill to her.
- Sure.

1419
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,833
- And this is your takeaway.
- Thank you.

1420
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:46,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

1421
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,375
Can you tell me about the offers?

1422
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:50,291
- So, do you have the KSK bill with you?
- No.

1423
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:51,541
Okay.

1424
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:54,291
If you give us the KSK bill,
you get the signature chai for free.

1425
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:57,666
And then, that's our masala chai,
tandoori chai and this is <i>dum</i> chai.

1426
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,125
- Okay. I'll come back with the KSK bill.
- Sure, thanks.

1427
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:03,583
Hi, guys! This is Manasa Samyuktha.

1428
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:05,291
And if you really like our chai,

1429
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:09,291
please visit Bloomberg and vote
for us in the ongoing competition.

1430
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:12,916
And I would love to know your
feedback, comments…

1431
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,041
anything that you would
want to share with us.

1432
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:17,541
So please, put it in the feedback box
which is right there.

1433
01:40:17,666 --> 01:40:20,041
So, are you guys enjoying our chai?

1434
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:21,125
- Yes!
- Yes!

1435
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:24,541
We have been working on our
new marketing strategies

1436
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:26,416
to counter our competition.

1437
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:29,000
We shall update you by tonight, sir.

1438
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:36,625
Sir, they have started something called…

1439
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,708
the "Miss India Day"
just like our KSK Day.

1440
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,226
It looks like we were the ones
who gave them the idea, sir.

1441
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,750
I think we need to stop this.

1442
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:46,536
These promotions aren't needed as we've
already been established in the market.

1443
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:52,875
I'd heard the adage that a fox burnt
itself in stripes to resemble a lion.

1444
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,916
But now, I actually got to witness it.

1445
01:40:55,708 --> 01:40:57,541
Miss India is just a start-up.

1446
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:00,666
If this dents us financially,
it's not such a big deal.

1447
01:41:01,083 --> 01:41:04,625
But they will not be able to handle the
loss they'll incur by giving free chai.

1448
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:07,041
And eventually,
they won't be able to compete with us.

1449
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:10,666
They'd unofficially accept the defeat by
realizing our popularity among the public.

1450
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:11,750
Forget it.

1451
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:15,875
By the way, keep continuing
this offer for one more week.

1452
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,583
Also, make grand arrangements
for the lucky draw contest

1453
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:21,291
on the day of our company's anniversary.

1454
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:22,750
- Sure, sir.
- Take care!

1455
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:26,833
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1456
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:29,500
Have some more.

1457
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:34,875
Okay. That's it.

1458
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:44,416
What are you thinking about?

1459
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:51,500
I forgot something.

1460
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:54,333
What did I forget?

1461
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:57,041
Do you have the KSK bill?

1462
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,625
- KSK bill?
- Yes.

1463
01:42:03,458 --> 01:42:04,458
This one, right?

1464
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:11,541
- Bijju!
- Yes, ma'am?

1465
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:13,791
- Please, serve special chai here.
- Okay, ma'am.

1466
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:22,793
This is the special chai
made exclusively for you.

1467
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,541
Taste it and tell me how it is.

1468
01:42:33,458 --> 01:42:34,791
Wonderful! Divine!

1469
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:37,791
Why have you come alone?

1470
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:40,726
I mean, why didn't anyone else
come along with you?

1471
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:43,166
- Who else were you expecting?
- Your wife and son.

1472
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:46,875
I don't know. Perhaps, they were busy.

1473
01:42:47,541 --> 01:42:49,166
What about your daughter?

1474
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:58,333
If you don't mind…
could you give me another cup of chai?

1475
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,500
I love it!

1476
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,541
Certainly!

1477
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:15,500
KSK and CO extends a warm
welcome to each and everyone here.

1478
01:43:15,708 --> 01:43:19,291
We all have gathered here to pick
the lucky draw winner from the pool.

1479
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:22,750
From several thousands of entries,
we have shortlisted a few.

1480
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:27,541
And now, I invite the Managing Director
of the company Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar.

1481
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:50,625
KSK Coffee has been and is
the best beverage company in the U.S.

1482
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:53,666
Some companies have come up
with some cheap beverages…

1483
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:57,041
but KSK remains in
the hearts of Americans.

1484
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:59,750
As a token of
appreciation for their loyalty,

1485
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,500
we are conducting this competition

1486
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:03,791
and giving away the lucky
prize to the lucky winner.

1487
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:16,875
And the number of the lucky winner is…

1488
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:20,750
9-1-1-2-3-3.

1489
01:44:21,583 --> 01:44:23,500
Can I see the lucky winner, please?

1490
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:10,250
So, Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar…

1491
01:45:10,458 --> 01:45:15,333
are you shocked…
to see me as the winner of your contest?

1492
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:18,166
The risk I took to compete
with you has made me the winner…

1493
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,791
and allowed me to stand
here on this stage with you.

1494
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:26,000
My dad was one of the members
who drank your coffee.

1495
01:45:26,166 --> 01:45:28,708
I inherited his luck.

1496
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:35,416
This will settle the expenses
of last month's free chai.

1497
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,500
On top of that, I made profits.

1498
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,375
I would consider this a donation.

1499
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,708
What did you say? "Chai is a cheap drink!"

1500
01:45:44,291 --> 01:45:45,666
Let me tell you something.

1501
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:51,125
Among the people who have tasted
KSK Coffee and Miss India chai,

1502
01:45:51,916 --> 01:45:55,375
90 percent of them have outrightly
voted for Miss India chai.

1503
01:45:56,958 --> 01:46:00,291
So, looks like chai has
a place in this coffee land.

1504
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:04,416
I am not just a lucky winner
of this lucky draw contest.

1505
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:07,875
I am also going to be
the winner of the competition

1506
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:09,638
between tea and coffee in the coming days.

1507
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:12,958
Remember that. Selfie, please.

1508
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:20,541
Thank you!

1509
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:36,458
<i>In the ongoing neck and neck competition
between KSK Coffee and Miss India chai,</i>

1510
01:46:36,791 --> 01:46:38,375
<i>Manasa Samyuktha has come out</i>

1511
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:41,583
<i>with flying colors putting
KSK in a big question mark.</i>

1512
01:46:41,666 --> 01:46:44,083
<i>It will be interesting to
see what his next move is.</i>

1513
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,833
<i>Keep watching for more updates.</i>

1514
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:41,291
Chai… the fastest growing business!

1515
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:43,708
Miss India!

1516
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:46,166
Fantastic!

1517
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:47,750
Truly fantastic!

1518
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:51,833
You know…
when I started my coffee business,

1519
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,333
it took me more than two
years to attain this position.

1520
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:57,583
But you did it within two months.

1521
01:47:58,291 --> 01:47:59,291
Wow!

1522
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:01,291
That's truly a great achievement!

1523
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:05,500
I had told you on that very day… my
tea is ten times better than your coffee.

1524
01:48:06,291 --> 01:48:09,666
I'm sorry. I couldn't properly
understand you that day.

1525
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:15,750
I don't think you even tried
to understand me that day.

1526
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,916
Look, past is like a dream.

1527
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:27,500
We should forget the past just
like we forget our dreams,

1528
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:28,916
but shouldn't linger around it.

1529
01:48:29,541 --> 01:48:31,625
That is when you achieve success in life.

1530
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:33,541
That is my philosophy.

1531
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:37,833
But what is the motive
behind approaching me…

1532
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,250
even when my business
is nowhere near yours?

1533
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:43,208
Excuse me.
Can I have a cup of chai, please?

1534
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,041
Samyuktha…

1535
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:54,625
it's difficult to manipulate
a sharp person like you.

1536
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:56,500
I'll come straight to the point.

1537
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:01,291
This is a blank check.

1538
01:49:02,458 --> 01:49:04,208
Write the amount you want.

1539
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:08,333
If that's not enough,
you'll get a partnership in the company.

1540
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:11,750
But make sure your business runs
under the name of my company.

1541
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:17,583
I want your brand, Miss India,
to be associated with my name.

1542
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:25,666
You were the one who told me that tea
and coffee cannot go together, right?

1543
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,166
Similarly, Samyuktha and Kailash
will never go together.

1544
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:33,625
How dare you offer me
a partnership in my own business!

1545
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:37,875
You have observed me closely,
and you know about me very well.

1546
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:40,458
Despite that,
you came here with such a proposal.

1547
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:44,083
I don't know if this is your
clever move or a foolish move.

1548
01:49:45,875 --> 01:49:48,750
The struggle is not an item…

1549
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,666
that you can purchase
from a store and own it.

1550
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:59,500
This is an empire which I have built by
working hard, Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar.

1551
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:02,083
It belongs only to me.

1552
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:11,083
I'm ready to become a villain of anyone's
life to become the hero of my life.

1553
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:16,958
That includes your life as well.
There won't be any compromise in this.

1554
01:50:17,708 --> 01:50:19,083
Remember something.

1555
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:22,000
You came this far by
being under the radar.

1556
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,916
But now, you've got my attention.
Let's see how far you can go!

1557
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,041
I came this far with my hard work.

1558
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:30,750
Not out of your mercy!

1559
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,375
You should remember that.

1560
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:39,666
I will see how long you can hold on
to that confidence and arrogance!

1561
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:53,625
- Hey, hi.
- Hi!

1562
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,750
Why had Kailash come to our cafe?

1563
01:50:57,458 --> 01:50:58,666
To buy Miss India.

1564
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:01,833
I told him it would never
happen and sent him away.

1565
01:51:03,916 --> 01:51:06,541
Kailash is a very… dangerous man.

1566
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:08,666
Even when we're not doing
anything wrong in life,

1567
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,791
there are a certain people
whom we should fear.

1568
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:13,166
And Kailash is the first
person among them.

1569
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,208
Anyway, from now on,

1570
01:51:15,291 --> 01:51:18,666
we have to think carefully
before taking any step.

1571
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:21,916
Okay. Forget it.

1572
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:24,041
Be ready tomorrow evening at six o'clock.

1573
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:26,041
I am going to give you
a special treat, okay?

1574
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:27,916
- Bye.
- Bye

1575
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,208
- Hi - Please, have a seat.

1576
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:41,833
Sweet.

1577
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:48,125
- Wow! It's beautiful, Vikram!
- Yeah.

1578
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,750
- Thank you.
- It truly looks like a special treat.

1579
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,500
So, is this your first?

1580
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:54,791
What?

1581
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:57,083
First candlelit dinner?

1582
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,333
Of course, it is.

1583
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:00,833
What about you?

1584
01:52:01,791 --> 01:52:04,166
This is my first
candlelit dinner with you.

1585
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:09,958
You didn't tell me the occasion.

1586
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:14,333
- It's my birthday.
- Happy birthday, Vikram!

1587
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:15,958
Thank you so much.

1588
01:52:16,666 --> 01:52:20,958
I make new resolution
on my every birthday.

1589
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,083
So, for this year,
I have made my resolution.

1590
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,125
What is it?

1591
01:52:25,208 --> 01:52:26,208
To get married.

1592
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:28,541
Congratulations! Who is that lucky girl?

1593
01:52:29,916 --> 01:52:32,875
I've always lived my life by
believing in logic and reasons.

1594
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:37,250
But ever since I met you, I've learned
to believe in the emotions. So, now…

1595
01:52:38,041 --> 01:52:42,333
I want to start a new life… with you.

1596
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:46,041
Only if you are interested.

1597
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:49,416
Vikram…

1598
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:53,041
you are a very special person in my life.

1599
01:52:55,458 --> 01:52:58,750
You believed in me and my business.
You have invested a lot of money in it.

1600
01:52:59,291 --> 01:53:02,750
What I am trying to say is…
this is all because of you.

1601
01:53:04,625 --> 01:53:08,166
But I don't have anything in
my heart except Miss India.

1602
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,166
This is my entire world right now.

1603
01:53:13,666 --> 01:53:16,125
I neither have time to think
about anything else…

1604
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,916
nor any interest.

1605
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:26,083
If I've hurt you…

1606
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:30,291
I am really sorry.

1607
01:53:43,083 --> 01:53:44,083
Six months!

1608
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:47,500
It's been a successful six-months
run for Miss India in America.

1609
01:53:47,583 --> 01:53:49,416
And the credit for all this goes to

1610
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,458
our founder and managing director,
Miss Manasa Samyuktha.

1611
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:54,250
Thank you.

1612
01:53:55,666 --> 01:53:57,500
Let's talk about our performance now.

1613
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:59,708
Though nine percent profit is a big number

1614
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:02,375
for our investment in
a span of six months,

1615
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:06,500
we are facing a deficit of 16 percent to
achieve the projected 25 percent profits.

1616
01:54:07,416 --> 01:54:09,916
So, there is a pretty good chance.

1617
01:54:10,125 --> 01:54:12,750
But even if we perform
extraordinarily from now on,

1618
01:54:12,916 --> 01:54:14,958
we might not achieve our year-end target.

1619
01:54:15,166 --> 01:54:18,166
Actually, even if we perform normally,

1620
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,267
we have a chance to achieve
our year-end target.

1621
01:54:20,291 --> 01:54:22,208
But there is a risk involved in it.

1622
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,250
Two days ago,
we got a mail on our company account.

1623
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:28,666
A business proposal from the BMC dealers.

1624
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:31,208
- What is the proposal?
- For the next six months,

1625
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:34,916
we'll have to deliver three
shipments of the material

1626
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:37,166
within a month to the BMC Solutions.

1627
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,625
But this is on the credit basis.

1628
01:54:39,708 --> 01:54:40,750
If we sign this deal,

1629
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:43,750
we would be getting 30 percent
of the profits from the BMC alone.

1630
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,666
Our company can't afford to deliver
the material on the credit basis.

1631
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:52,541
It is very risky. We cannot go against
the policies for the sake of profits.

1632
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:56,458
We all know that there is
a risk involved, Vikram.

1633
01:54:56,875 --> 01:55:00,875
If we continue to ignore these kinds of
proposals, we cannot grow this business.

1634
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:03,166
Let's do a background check once,

1635
01:55:03,375 --> 01:55:06,416
and if we think it's really
safe, I think we can go ahead.

1636
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,916
Okay, if you are convinced,
I don't have an issue.

1637
01:55:10,458 --> 01:55:11,833
But remember one thing,

1638
01:55:12,208 --> 01:55:14,291
one mistake and I'm out of this business.

1639
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:20,791
Nayana, go ahead and start
the process tomorrow.

1640
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:21,916
Sure.

1641
01:55:26,416 --> 01:55:27,916
- Hello, Samyuktha.
<i>- Yes, Nayana.</i>

1642
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,541
I've just finished the inquiry
about the BMC dealers' track record.

1643
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,416
<i>- What does it say?</i>
- The feedback is very positive.

1644
01:55:34,958 --> 01:55:35,958
I think it's safe.

1645
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,800
<i>- Great! Let's finalize the deal then.</i>
- Okay.

1646
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:47,625
Miss India is very happy and privileged
to be associated with the BMC.

1647
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:50,708
Same here. I hope our
association will last very long.

1648
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:51,916
Sure, it will.

1649
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:11,125
Yeah, Preethi?

1650
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:14,166
<i>Samyuktha, the first paycheck
given by Richard has bounced.</i>

1651
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:15,625
What?

1652
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:30,208
I had warned you about this deal, but you
didn't pay heed and took this decision.

1653
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,666
Three shipments! In these three shipments,

1654
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:35,583
we've shipped the material worth
eight lakh dollars to them.

1655
01:56:35,666 --> 01:56:37,666
The first paycheck given
by Richard has bounced.

1656
01:56:37,833 --> 01:56:41,708
That means… we need to consider that our
present running capital is almost zero.

1657
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,791
If we don't get out of this problem soon,

1658
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,125
we might need to wind up the business!

1659
01:56:58,916 --> 01:57:01,666
The employees have figured out
that the company is in trouble.

1660
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:03,791
We didn't even pay them
the last month's salary.

1661
01:57:03,916 --> 01:57:06,041
Many of them have already resigned.

1662
01:57:07,083 --> 01:57:09,791
But those employees who
still have faith in us

1663
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:11,625
said that they would
wait another ten days.

1664
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,208
If we don't settle their accounts in the
next ten days, they will leave as well.

1665
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,041
I just spoke to the credit
insurance company.

1666
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:27,000
They told me that they'd offer help in
returning the amount as soon as possible.

1667
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:28,916
But we didn't get it insured, right?

1668
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:33,208
We didn't get it insured… but I did.

1669
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,083
The money we would be getting
now isn't ours… it's mine!

1670
01:57:40,833 --> 01:57:42,750
When I give my money to you,

1671
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:46,083
I can't just afford to simply
watch whatever you do with that.

1672
01:57:46,166 --> 01:57:49,791
That is why, I took this precaution.

1673
01:57:51,416 --> 01:57:54,125
Vikram, please give me one last chance.

1674
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:57,083
The employees are starting
to leave the company.

1675
01:57:57,750 --> 01:58:00,375
I must uphold the trust
those people have in me.

1676
01:58:01,208 --> 01:58:03,333
I will ensure that I don't
repeat this mistake.

1677
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:04,416
I promise.

1678
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:05,583
Samyuktha…

1679
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:09,083
I never broke the rules I made for myself.

1680
01:58:09,666 --> 01:58:12,291
But I did that for the first
time, for you.

1681
01:58:12,416 --> 01:58:14,916
I didn't know who you were
and what your background was.

1682
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,125
And yet, I invested so much
money into your business.

1683
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,333
That was the first favor I did for you.

1684
01:58:19,666 --> 01:58:22,166
But you didn't uphold
that trust I placed in you.

1685
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:27,000
But now, you have to return my
money as per our agreement.

1686
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:30,125
And along with that, you must give
me your brand, Miss India, as well.

1687
01:58:30,625 --> 01:58:32,708
But I am not asking you to do that.

1688
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:35,250
This is the second favor
that I've done for you.

1689
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:39,125
But now, you are asking for
my help for the third time.

1690
01:58:40,125 --> 01:58:42,666
In fact, I do want to help you.

1691
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:44,000
Do you know why?

1692
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:46,041
Because I am very fond of you.

1693
01:58:47,041 --> 01:58:48,333
And you know that.

1694
01:58:49,583 --> 01:58:53,333
When a person offers help to someone
who is not at all associated with him,

1695
01:58:53,416 --> 01:58:57,458
you must understand how much love
he must have for that person.

1696
01:58:57,958 --> 01:58:59,416
If you can't understand,

1697
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:02,958
there is no use no matter
how many times I offer help.

1698
01:59:04,416 --> 01:59:05,416
Favor?

1699
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:08,250
Vikram…

1700
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:10,958
approaching you for the investment…

1701
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:14,083
is an opportunity that
I created for myself.

1702
01:59:14,208 --> 01:59:17,583
Investing in my business was your choice.

1703
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:20,500
It means, it was purely a business deal.

1704
01:59:20,958 --> 01:59:23,500
When it comes to the second
favor that you mentioned,

1705
01:59:23,666 --> 01:59:26,476
there are still three months left for
our agreement's validity to expire.

1706
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,500
It's not yet over.

1707
01:59:28,791 --> 01:59:31,083
If you help me in getting out
of the current situation…

1708
01:59:31,166 --> 01:59:33,875
then, yes.
That would also be called a "favor."

1709
01:59:35,458 --> 01:59:38,166
I will return your money
along with the interest, very soon.

1710
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:39,750
Goodbye.

1711
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:53,958
Ma'am…

1712
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:57,142
all these days, we made a living
out of the salary you gave us.

1713
01:59:57,166 --> 02:00:01,083
And we won't desert you just because
you are in a tough phase, ma'am.

1714
02:00:01,208 --> 02:00:03,708
They say that sharing the problems
relieves us from the sorrow.

1715
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:05,458
I've been with you in your good times.

1716
02:00:05,583 --> 02:00:07,434
Let me be with you in
these tough times as well.

1717
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:10,958
Whether you give me my salary or
no, I'll always be with you.

1718
02:00:55,333 --> 02:00:56,333
I heard about it.

1719
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:03,000
I am deeply saddened by
your state of affairs.

1720
02:01:06,708 --> 02:01:09,500
Had you sold your company to me that day,

1721
02:01:09,583 --> 02:01:11,541
you wouldn't have been
facing this problem today.

1722
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:16,000
Well, Miss Samyuktha…

1723
02:01:16,916 --> 02:01:19,083
business is not a game for women.

1724
02:01:20,208 --> 02:01:21,416
Business is war.

1725
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:25,291
Every minute, danger keeps stalking it.

1726
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:29,208
And half of our strength gets
wasted in warding off the dangers.

1727
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:33,708
You are a mere girl.
What do you know about this?

1728
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:37,875
You assumed that just because
I am a girl I wouldn't know!

1729
02:01:37,958 --> 02:01:40,500
Do you even know
what a girl is capable of?

1730
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,708
If you give her a house,
she will give you a family.

1731
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,500
If you give her groceries,
she will give you food.

1732
02:01:46,708 --> 02:01:49,208
If you give her happiness,
she will return it with love.

1733
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:53,625
If you give her love,
she will give you a new life.

1734
02:01:54,208 --> 02:01:56,750
Whatever you give her,
she always returns double of that.

1735
02:01:56,875 --> 02:01:58,666
Whether it's good or bad.

1736
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:04,333
You seem to be quiet now.

1737
02:02:06,666 --> 02:02:09,517
You've mocked me stating that a girl
doesn't know anything about business.

1738
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:11,166
Now, I'm telling you as that same girl.

1739
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:17,333
Be ready to face double the amount of
trouble you have given me, Mr. Kailash.

1740
02:02:23,875 --> 02:02:29,875
<i>The words of women don't make any sense</i>

1741
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,916
<i>They don't make any sense at all</i>

1742
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:41,291
I never expected that we
would have to face this day

1743
02:02:41,375 --> 02:02:43,791
after establishing Miss India
with so much effort, Samyuktha.

1744
02:02:45,458 --> 02:02:48,500
Signing the deal in which a huge
risk was involved is not a mistake…

1745
02:02:50,875 --> 02:02:53,500
but I'm sure there has been an error
somewhere in my calculations.

1746
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,541
Where is Nayana?

1747
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:01,083
I don't know, Samyuktha.
I haven't seen her since two days.

1748
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:03,958
And she isn't replying to my
calls and messages either.

1749
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:07,083
I didn't tell you because I didn't
want you to go through more stress.

1750
02:03:44,208 --> 02:03:46,500
Excuse me! Have you seen this person?

1751
02:03:47,375 --> 02:03:48,708
- No.
- Thank you.

1752
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:53,540
<i>Samyuktha, I checked Nayana's landline
call records as per your instructions.</i>

1753
02:03:53,583 --> 02:03:55,541
<i>The last call she made was
to Mandalay Bay Hotel.</i>

1754
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:18,041
Betrayal has been a practice
since the times of <i>Mahabharata.</i>

1755
02:04:20,416 --> 02:04:22,125
I won't ask you why you did this.

1756
02:04:23,083 --> 02:04:25,291
What is it that you have
gained from doing this to me?

1757
02:04:25,375 --> 02:04:26,583
It's simple, Samyuktha.

1758
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:28,708
Every person is greedy.

1759
02:04:29,125 --> 02:04:31,725
It is the greed to be more successful
than the people around them.

1760
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:33,666
But not everyone gets such an opportunity.

1761
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:35,958
I got that opportunity, and I used it.

1762
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:45,125
Your name is Padma Nayana.
Your place of birth is Hyderabad.

1763
02:04:45,208 --> 02:04:47,958
Your mother is a homemaker,
and your father is a mechanical engineer.

1764
02:04:51,291 --> 02:04:55,250
You have done an MBA, but you are doing
a petty job in your friend's company.

1765
02:04:55,875 --> 02:04:58,375
Your ambition is to become
a reporter in the BBC news channel.

1766
02:04:58,791 --> 02:04:59,791
Am I right?

1767
02:05:01,666 --> 02:05:04,791
Nayana, let me tell you something
that has benefited me…

1768
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:06,750
and that is going to benefit you now.

1769
02:05:08,208 --> 02:05:12,791
If you don't build your dreams, someone
will hire you to build their dreams.

1770
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:18,708
It means, if we don't work
hard to fulfill our dreams…

1771
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:21,875
we will end up working hard
to fulfill someone else's dream.

1772
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:25,791
I will give you an opportunity.

1773
02:05:27,875 --> 02:05:29,166
If you do as I say…

1774
02:05:30,208 --> 02:05:33,541
you will be paid an amount you would
have never imagined in your lifetime.

1775
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:36,541
I will fulfill…

1776
02:05:36,875 --> 02:05:39,708
your lifelong ambition of securing
a permanent job as a BBC reporter.

1777
02:05:43,166 --> 02:05:44,250
What do I need to do?

1778
02:05:47,083 --> 02:05:49,583
I am not hurt that you have betrayed me.

1779
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:53,208
I am feeling bad for the fact
that I can no longer trust you.

1780
02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:04,041
Miss Samyuktha, how did
your own friend betray you?

1781
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:08,000
Miss Samyuktha, is it due to your own
decision that you landed in trouble?

1782
02:06:08,375 --> 02:06:10,958
Miss Samyuktha, why haven't
you doubted Nayana before?

1783
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:14,666
Miss Samyuktha, could you tell
us what happened in detail?

1784
02:06:15,708 --> 02:06:19,916
A guy couldn't stand to see
a woman doing business.

1785
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:21,750
He tried to suppress her.

1786
02:06:21,833 --> 02:06:23,333
So, are you out of business?

1787
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:25,000
I am born to do business!

1788
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:27,166
Business is not a monopoly.

1789
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:28,708
It is my birthright.

1790
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:32,500
All these days, I've heard
people say business is war,

1791
02:06:32,583 --> 02:06:34,291
but I never took it seriously.

1792
02:06:34,791 --> 02:06:36,083
But I am telling you now…

1793
02:06:36,625 --> 02:06:37,875
business is war.

1794
02:06:39,083 --> 02:06:42,375
Here are the witnesses of the conspiracies
of Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar.

1795
02:06:42,458 --> 02:06:46,875
I demand the jurisdiction to give him
a deserved price for his criminal deeds.

1796
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,767
As the media, we'll do everything within
our capacity to bring this to justice.

1797
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:53,000
But how is your company doing?
Reports say that you are broke.

1798
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:57,000
With your permission,
I would like to make a special request.

1799
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,750
<i>Whoever recognizes
the struggles of a woman…</i>

1800
02:07:01,166 --> 02:07:03,791
<i>whoever desires the victory
of good over evil…</i>

1801
02:07:04,583 --> 02:07:06,375
<i>whoever loves the taste of chai…</i>

1802
02:07:07,125 --> 02:07:09,833
<i>whoever believes that there
is truth in my words…</i>

1803
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,166
I am requesting them to lend
their possible financial help.

1804
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,083
Each and every one who helps us shall
become a shareholder of Miss India.

1805
02:07:22,625 --> 02:07:25,333
And we will share our
profits in the future.

1806
02:07:29,125 --> 02:07:30,500
All that I can say is…

1807
02:07:32,166 --> 02:07:33,375
I need your help.

1808
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,250
Thank you.

1809
02:07:37,333 --> 02:07:38,208
<i>It's simple, Samyuktha.</i>

1810
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:40,208
<i>In a shocking revelation,</i>

1811
02:07:40,375 --> 02:07:42,833
<i>Manasa Samyuktha submits recorded evidence</i>

1812
02:07:42,916 --> 02:07:46,083
<i>against the conspiracy
done by Kailash and Nayana.</i>

1813
02:08:18,541 --> 02:08:21,302
You'd said that you'd return home
the day we truly realize your worth.

1814
02:08:21,375 --> 02:08:24,333
We have realized it now,
so we have come to you.

1815
02:08:33,541 --> 02:08:38,416
I didn't feel as much pain when I
realized that I can't be a doctor…

1816
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:43,625
as I am feeling today for not realizing…

1817
02:08:45,333 --> 02:08:47,083
the worth of my talented…

1818
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:51,041
and intelligent daughter.

1819
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:58,250
Mom, I left the house
to fulfill my dreams…

1820
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:00,875
not because I was mad at you.

1821
02:09:01,791 --> 02:09:06,041
If I have hurt you in any way…
I am really sorry.

1822
02:09:09,916 --> 02:09:11,916
All these days,
we couldn't share your problems.

1823
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:14,291
But at least now, we got that opportunity.

1824
02:09:18,416 --> 02:09:19,458
Miss India!

1825
02:09:20,333 --> 02:09:21,416
India.

1826
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:22,833
I really miss India.

1827
02:09:28,333 --> 02:09:29,666
Samyuktha, look here.

1828
02:09:29,958 --> 02:09:31,708
We have already begun to get funds.

1829
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:37,333
It's 60,000 and it's still counting.
Unbelievable!

1830
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:42,583
Ma'am… look over there.

1831
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,666
We are always with Miss India.

1832
02:09:54,625 --> 02:09:55,500
Thank you.

1833
02:09:55,583 --> 02:09:58,833
<i>I have taken a new step</i>

1834
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:02,166
<i>In my little world</i>

1835
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:05,500
<i>The bright light of my dreams</i>

1836
02:10:05,708 --> 02:10:10,291

<i>I have taken a new step</i>

1838
02:10:34,916 --> 02:10:38,208
<i>In my little world</i>

1839
02:10:38,291 --> 02:10:39,541
<i>The bright light…</i>

1840
02:10:39,625 --> 02:10:42,666
Excuse me, ma'am.
Can I have another cup of chai, please?

1841
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:45,250
<i>Shows me such miraculous wonders</i>

1842
02:11:13,416 --> 02:11:14,458
<i>Miss Samyuktha,</i>

1843
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:17,500
<i>as the Business Woman of the Year,
what is your message for today's youth?</i>

1844
02:11:17,791 --> 02:11:20,958
<i>The most valuable thing in
this world is your goal.</i>

1845
02:11:21,416 --> 02:11:24,875
<i>If you realize your goal, value and dream,</i>

1846
02:11:25,125 --> 02:11:26,125
<i>just get it.</i>

1847
02:11:26,208 --> 02:11:28,875
<i>If you don't realize it,
then your life is not worth living.</i>

1848
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:32,125
<i>We are not meant to fear God…</i>

1849
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:35,416
<i>or our college professors
or even the society.</i>

1850
02:11:35,666 --> 02:11:36,875
<i>We must fear the thought</i>

1851
02:11:36,958 --> 02:11:40,041
<i>that this world will never get
to know the hero within you.</i>

1852
02:11:40,958 --> 02:11:42,625
<i>Life is an opportunity.</i>

1853
02:11:42,875 --> 02:11:44,666
<i>It is a chance to prove yourself.</i>

1854
02:11:44,958 --> 02:11:46,000
<i>Just prove it.</i>

1855
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,750
<i>Awake, arise, and don't stop
until you achieve your goal.</i>

1856
02:11:51,625 --> 02:11:52,458
<i>Thank you.</i>

1857
02:11:52,541 --> 02:11:54,041
<i>There is no defeat
Tomorrow is mine</i>

1858
02:11:54,125 --> 02:11:57,500
<i>It's a short life
Spend it with freedom</i>

1859
02:11:57,583 --> 02:12:00,875
<i>Forget all your troubles</i>

1860
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,416
<i>There is someone within you that isn't you</i>

1861
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:07,500
<i>Leave it behind
Take a new step and never stop</i>

1862
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:14,291
Hey, brother! Serve me a cup of chai.

1863
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:30,958
<i>The words of women make sense</i>

1864
02:12:31,625 --> 02:12:34,291
<i>But you don't pay attention</i>

1865
02:12:34,833 --> 02:12:37,250
<i>Oh, my God! What should we do now?</i>

1866
02:12:40,875 --> 02:12:44,416
I had told you that a woman
will always increase your profits.

1867
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:48,041
I've added a thousand dollars to the
thousand dollar check that you gave me.

1868
02:12:48,208 --> 02:12:49,250
Enjoy it!

1869
02:12:55,583 --> 02:12:57,916
Thank you, Miss India.

1870
02:12:58,875 --> 02:12:59,875
Cheers.

1871
02:13:04,125 --> 02:13:05,125
Wow!

1872
02:13:05,458 --> 02:13:06,458
Thank you!

1873
02:13:06,958 --> 02:13:10,375
Now, do you know the difference
between my chai and your coffee?

1874
02:13:13,666 --> 02:13:17,875
Every cup of coffee in your
KSK outlet is made with money.

1875
02:13:19,916 --> 02:13:24,000
But here, at Miss India,
every cup of chai is made with love.

1876
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:31,458
Had I understood this before…

1877
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:33,625
I wouldn't have been in this situation.

1878
02:13:34,416 --> 02:13:36,750
You still have time, Mr. Kailash.

1879
02:13:37,458 --> 02:13:39,375
You had told me that business is war.

1880
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:41,500
Start the war again.

1881
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:44,583
With your luck.

1882
02:13:44,916 --> 02:13:45,916
That's the spirit!

1883
02:13:45,940 --> 02:13:47,940
