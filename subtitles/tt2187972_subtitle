lt's been so long
since Mrs. lndira died.

29
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,925
But this crazy man
still dreams of her.

30
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:33,135
My dear lndira,

31
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,135

00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:46,176
You're still going to
Russia with the wrong Feroze.

Wrong.

00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,283

Please remind Farhad.

00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,110
lt's a life altering moment.

50
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:25,121
Otherwise lndira will
just leave for Russia.

51
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,884
And my marriage will get on hold.

52
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:30,616

Yes, mama. Don't worry.

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,912
And drive carefully. Not above 40.

59
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,311
Mama, this vehicle

60
00:04:56,654 --> 00:04:58,178
Bye, mama.
- Bye Farhad.

61
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:03,358

00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:12,068
Hi Farhad.

00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,228
How is Nargis?
- She's fine.

74
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,395
Coomi's married now.

75
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,864
So she's very happy.

76
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,874
Now that Coomi is married,
it's your turn.

77
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:53,134
No more excuses.

78
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,839
From being the most
eligible bachelor...

79
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,381
... you've been now reduced to
being the most reliable bachelor.

80
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,911
Settle her bill.

81
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:03,412
Thank you.

82
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:07,287
Aunty, whenever you're here,
the day becomes so cheerful and bright.

83
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,819
Everybody tells me that.
- Sure.

84
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:12,152
Love you, baby.
- Bye

85
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,961
Bye, boys.
- Bye.

86
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:19,668
Oh, Mama.

87
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,333
Yes Mama.
- Farhad.

88
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,174
Meru aunty just called.

89
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,777
She was saying we've
to go see this girl.

90
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,203
Freny Mehta.

91
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,904
She's a nice girl.

92
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:34,046
Farhad, we'll meet at Tardeo circle.

93
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,109
Five o"clock. Don't be late.

94
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,155
Mama. How many times do
l have to tell you ...

95
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,951
... l can't skip work like this.

96
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,423
Why don't you understand?

97
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,320
Farhad, there are very
few Parsi girls left.

98
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,056
Otherwise, after this..

99
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,394
..we"ll only find
widows and divorcees.

100
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,930
Get ready.

101
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:54,436
l"ll go and get ready.

102
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,774
Actually, mamma is right.

103
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,304
Farhad just "loves" cricket.

104
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,976
He's crazy about cricket.
He spends the whole day on the field.

105
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:08,982
l see.

106
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,181
So what are you, batsman or bowler?
- 12th man.

107
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,022
He's very fond of sports.

108
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:19,858
You know, he's at
the Parsi Gymkhana every Sunday.

109
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,763
Oh, he should"ve
made the top 1 1 by now.

110
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,857
l"m a scorer now.

111
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,095
Top scorer, he means. Top scorer.

112
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,800
Farhad, son.
- Yes.

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,368
What do you do?

114
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:31,904
Let me tell you.

115
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,239
We are from a well to do family.

116
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,438
We have a farm at Navsari,
a nice big house ...

117
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,074
.. and Farhad has a garment business.

118
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,048
Just a minute.

119
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,516
Sorry, mama. Don't feel bad.

120
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:45,278
She's my mommy.
She really loves me a lot.

121
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,914
And wants to see me happy.

122
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:49,185
Just like every mommy
loves their child ...

123
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,090
... and she wants to see me happy.

124
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:51,458
Happily married, basically.

125
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,420
Let me be honest with you.

126
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:54,794
Don't feel bad, uncle.

127
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:59,262
We don't have a big
house or a farm at Navsari.

128
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,836
And more importantly...
l don't have any garment business.

129
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,011
Salesman.

130
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,049
Let me know if you
have any requirement.

131
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:15,816
Pass it on.

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,412
One for granny too.

133
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,322
Let me ma, please. Yeah..

134
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:25,486
From Parsi Dairy?

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,458
Mama, pass me a slice of cake.

136
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,134
Mama.

137
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,404
Don't be sad, mama.

138
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,465
l"m very sorry.
- No, Farhad.

139
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:41,170
l am not sad.

140
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,811
l"m so proud of you my son.

141
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,542
You've become so honest.

142
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,979
l would let go of a thousand
Freny"s for you to stay this way.

143
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,984
And anyway,
why do l need to get married?

144
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:53,913
You're there to look after me, right?

145
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,583
Don't talk like a fool.

146
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,856
You think l'm going to spend
the rest of my life..

147
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,828
..feeding you chicken and eggs?

148
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,828
Frankly, l think
it's a very good idea.

149
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,524
Farhad!

150
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:08,064
Farhad Pastakia!
- Yes.

151
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,930
Don't you recognise me?
- No. - Cyrus.

152
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,840
We were together
from the fifth standard.

153
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,240
Cyrus.
- Hi, Cyrus.

154
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,174
How are you?

155
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,179
Mama, don't you recognise Cyrus?

156
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,572
Remem ber, the guy
that was suspended ...

157
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,578
..for sneaking into the girl's toilet.

158
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,383
Farhad, meet my son Firdaus.

159
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,886
Hi, Firdaus. How are you, son?

160
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,319
Hello, aunty.
- Hello.

161
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,086
Where's your wife?
- Divorced.

162
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,193
And yours?

163
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:31,193
Still searching.

164
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,523
Please tell me if you
know any nice girls for him.

165
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:35,860
Okay.

166
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,465
And by the way, where"s your wife now?

167
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:41,404
See you.
- All the best.

168
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,599
See you, son. See you.

169
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,102
Bye. Bye.

170
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:47,042
Mama!

171
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,505
She's single now.

172
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,206
What's the harm in asking?

173
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,617
Mama, you"re too much.

174
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:02,384
Who"s come this late?

175
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,326
Surprise!

176
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,054
Really, it's a surprise.

177
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,062
How are you, aunty?
- Great, come come.

178
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:08,654
Please come in.
- Aunty, that's my girlfriend Anahita.

179
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,060
Hi, Anahita. Nice to see you.

180

You're looking like a bom b.

00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:30,147
Forget my bomb,

190
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:32,920
Hi, mama.

Consider the marriage, approved.

210
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,079
Feroze Uncle, how did you know?

211
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,216
lndira's a wonderful girl.

212
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:13,654
Uncle"s slightly ... cuckoo.

213
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:16,691
He's still living in
a 60 year flashback.

214
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:18,729
So cute.
- Farhad, son. - Tell me.

215
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:21,062
l just heard the
announcement over the radio.

216
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,136
lndira's coming to Mumbai.

217
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:26,474
And the secret is ...

218
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:29,535
... she"s not here for the meeting.
She's coming to see me.

219
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,275
So everyone please ...

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,640
lndira, you're here!

221
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,143
You didn"t even tell me.

222
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:38,312
Feroze uncle! Feroze uncle!

223
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:39,515
Feroze uncle!

224
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,055
lndira.

225
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,114
My lndira.
- Feroze uncle!

226
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:46,392
Feroze, leave her alone.

227
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:47,987
lndira.
- Feroze uncle. What are you doing?

228
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:48,997
Feroze uncle!

229
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,431
What are you doing?

230
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,230
Someone stop him.

231
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,634
My lndira. l am the real Feroze.
- Feroze uncle!

232
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:57,697
What are you doing?
- Feroze uncle.

233
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,402
l am the real Feroze.

234
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:01,603
What are you doing?

235
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,636
Stop it. Come on.

236
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,409
Sit down.

237
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,081
Come on.

238
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,078
lndira's coming tomorrow.

239
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,752
... that she married the wrong Feroze.

240
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:18,186
What Feroz Uncle.

241
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:22,132
Farhad. Tell me this,
when will you give us any good news?

242
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:27,266
We'd gone today, to see a girl.

243
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:28,463
But somehow, we didn't like her.

244
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,437
Come on, Nargis.

245
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:33,735
Farhad doesn"t have
the time to be choosy now.

246
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,540
l suggest that you grab
whomever you can find.

247
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:36,738
Stop it, mum my.

248
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,050
But, this is the right time.

249
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,412
Tomorrow, lndira
will go back to Delhi.

250
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:46,347
Beroze aunty, l know l'm 45 years old.

251
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:54,791
l"ll marry someone ...
that my heart calls out to.

252
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,724
l agree.

253
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,289
But do you know what your problem is?

254
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,466
Your problem is what
you do for a living.

255
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,603
Which girl these
days would ever marry...

256
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,573
... a bra and panty salesman?

257
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,438
Beroze aunty.

258
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,444
What's the problem with my job?

259
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,440
What's wrong with my job? Tell me.

260
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,712
Am l not doing an honest job?

261
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,416
ls that not enough for you?

262
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,722
Don't you people wear underwear?

263
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,557
Who are the ones at this
table wearing underwear?

264
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:24,685
Come on, put your hands up.
Come on, show me.

265
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:33,094
Beroze. Are you so
fond of 'going commando'?

266
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:34,597
Mama, stop it.

267
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:35,763
l"ve got them on.

268
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,170
See.

269
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,334
and the day Hormuz
sanctions my loan ...

270
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:44,405
Stop day-dreaming, Farhad ...

271
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:47,109
... and stop looking
for excuses to not marry.

272
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,842
You think l don"t want to get married?

273
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,885
You think l'm not trying?

274
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,854
You think l like getting
rejected by some girl each time.

275
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,590
Where are you going?

276
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,857
Friend or Boyfriend?

277
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,190
Beroze, stop it.

278
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,198
Stop, Farhad.

279
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:05,428
You know mom .

280
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,434
Come back now.

281
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:07,765
No, it's alright.

282
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:11,440
Finally, l've found the right lndira.
- Hormuz.

283
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,170
Feroze uncle. Feroze uncle.
Feroze uncle.

284
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,905
My lndira.

285
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,807
My lndira.
- Feroze, please stop it.

286
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:20,372
Please someone save me.

287
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,348
Leave me.

288
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:22,885
What is this crazy man doing?

289
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,145
Feroze uncle, leave her.
- What is he doing?

290
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:27,583
Sit down.

291
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:29,255
Enough. Enough.

292
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,384
Everybody!

293
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:32,920
Sorry, Beroze aunty.

294
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,234
''l say who! Who's there!""

295
00:15:16,607 --> 00:15:19,542
''She makes my heart go..''

296
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,845
''l say who! Who's there!""

297
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,942
''She makes my heart go..''

298

Look, ma'am.

Look, this is our silky item .

00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,006
Touch it, so soft.

319
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,373
Go on, touch it. Try.

320
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,410
Soft, right?

321
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,840
And this one's florescent.

322
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,485
Yes. That's that.

323
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,816
And this one comes
with extra padding ...

324
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,812
Ehhh ... you don"t need them.

00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,878
Yes, mama.
- l've been calling you for so long.

334
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:42,782
Why aren't you answering your phone?

335
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:43,842
lt was on silent.

336
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,046
Don't keep it on silent mode.

337
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,852
Those trustees have sent us a notice.

338
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:52,019
About our water tank.

339
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:53,858
They say the tank's illegal.

340
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:58,697
lt's the tank your father built,
our last memory of him.

341
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,794
Who does this secretary think she is?

342
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:03,831
l"ll show her who"s
who for messing with me.

343
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:07,468
Let"s see who has the guts
to break our tank.

344
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,804
Please do bring it
back if you find it loose.

345
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:12,809
l"m telling you, Farhad.

346
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,750
Go and knock some sense into them !

347
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:16,911
Later, mama.

348
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:19,813
Move aside.

349
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,619
Farhad. Farhad, are you there?

350
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:22,817

Enough with this long list of yours.

354
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,840
And the only reason l'm meeting you
is because Dhun Aunty said so. Ok?

355
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,904
Why don't you just
pick one and show me?

356
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,143
Look at this. He is Gayomard Sanjana.

357
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,752
Young, eligible,
47 year old Parsi boy.

358
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:56,057
Boy? - 'Boy" meaning,
young at heart, Shirin.

359
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,694
He just underwent a by-pass.

360
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,487
His heart is solid again.

361
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,823
Every evening, Parsi Gymkhana ...

362
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:06,962
Anyone else?

363
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,841
He's from Dahanu.

364
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,901
Dahanu's so far, Mrs. Mehta.

365
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,037
So what?

366
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,978
He owns 50 buffalos.

367
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,448
So? What will l do with them?

368
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:23,145
You think l'm going to get up
every morning at four to milk them?

369
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,814
Frankly, l'm not the milking type.

370
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:26,753
l get it.

371
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:27,983
You want the office types.

372
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:29,722
Here.

373
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,762
Young entrepreneur, Dara Karanjia.

374
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,590
l"ve seen him somewhere.

375
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,098
He used to come on T.V. a lot.

376
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,464
Actor?
- No.

377
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,566
He was sent to prison
for that 2G financial scam.

378
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:43,470
His family says he'll
be out on bail soon.

379
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:44,901
And if he doesn"t ...

380
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,704
... you'll get us
married behind bars, right?

381
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,801
Shirin, you are impossible.

382
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,571
This way you"ll never get married.

383
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,180
Mrs. Mehta, there is one left.

384
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,120
Perizad had an excellent suggestion.

385
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,254
What now?

386
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:11,627
Why don't you attend the
Parsi Trust"s Matrimonial Social?

387
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:12,998
Mama, you"ve started again.

388
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,765
You keep sending me to these
speed-dating gigs, then those clubs

389
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,206
and now you"re asking me to
attend this matrimonial social?

390
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:23,645
You know l get very
nervous in such situations.

391
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,676
Nervous?

392
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:27,273
This very nervousness and
shyness is the reason why ...

393
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,109
... our com munity is disappearing.

394
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,277
Take a look at the others.

395
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:32,681
See with what gusto
they get married ...

396
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,087
... and keep giving
birth to child after child.

397
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:36,751
And look at us,
there's hardly any left.

398
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,227
l feel in every street of our nation,
there should be a TATA, a WADlA ...

399
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,665
And even a PASTAKlA too.

400
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,937
Now we'd like to invite our
last candidate for today ...

401
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,996
Mr. Farhad Pastakia.
Please come on stage.

402
00:20:51,174 --> 00:20:52,835
Please give him a big hand.

403
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,243
Come on. Yeah.

404
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,706
My name is Farhad Pastakia.

405
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,934
And ... l'm 45 years old.

406
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:30,611
Thank you.

407
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,678
Farhad, what is it that you do?
Speak up!

408
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,877
Well choose only
you will say more.

409
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,322
l"m a salesman at
the Tem Tem"s bra and panty store.

410
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,745
Hello.

411
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:15,115
Now you tell me, is there anything
wrong in being a lingerie salesman?

412
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,023
You should be proud
that you spoke the truth.

413
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:19,288
l know better than anyone else that
the room's filled with..

414
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:23,989
Did you see how they were laughing?

415
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,235
l want to know ...

416
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:29,203
is there any man inside
not wearing bra and panty?

417
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:32,140
You mean ... l know men and
women wear different kinds.

418
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,368
l got it, l got it..
- Yes.

419
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,837
You know what l mean.

420
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:37,812
People think l'm just a bra salesman.

421
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:41,282
l"m an expert.
Big com panies consult me on ...

422
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,184
.. how to design special
bras for specific body types.

423
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:47,779
What's going on?

424
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:51,122
l saw her first. - So what,
does she belong to your father?

425
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:53,658
What did you just say?

426
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,164
Stop.

427
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,430
Oh, God.

428
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:01,034
Oh no, not again.

429
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:03,966
Shirin, don"t go.

430
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,031
Don't worry, these people
need to be taught a lesson.

431
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,836
What are you doing?

432
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:10,436
Move out of the way. Stop, stop it.

433
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,178
Mr. Wadia, Mr. Mehta.

434
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:13,442
Why are you two fighting?

435
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,317
Over her?
- Yes.

436
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:16,909
Oh no, stop.

437
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,086
Calm down.

438
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,383
Crackpots.

439
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:21,924
Bloody useless buggers.

440
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:26,225
Look who's talking.

441
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,691
Say that again.

442
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:28,991
Look who's talking.

443
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:32,262
Wadia, you foul mouthed rascal.

444
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:35,027
Take this.
- Hit him hard.

445
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,035
Go to hell.
- Don't hit me, please!

446
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:42,271
Enough now. Don't make me come in.

447
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:43,844
Let"s go.

448
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:46,041
Ok, l'll drop you home myself.

449
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:48,812
No, l have to go with
the other organizers.

450
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,853
Ok, so at least give me your number.

451
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,148
My number? You already have it.

452
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,281
Where do l have it?
- 36B.

453
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:57,017
Don't joke around.
Just give me your number.

454
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,027
Why do you need my num ber ?

455
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:02,292
lf it is in our destiny,
we"ll definitely meet again.

456
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,137
What a rocking social, nah!

457
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,838
So, did you like anyone?

458
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,744
So, did you like anyone?

459
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,344
Yes!

460
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:22,248
Really? Congratulations!

461
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:24,251
Who? Who is it? What's her name?

462
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:30,254
l forgot to ask her.
- Excellent!

463
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,298
Mama.
- What?

464
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,535
Mama.

465
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,277
Get up.
- What is it?

466
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:52,337
Farhad"s rooster is up and
awake after so many years!

467
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:53,814
What are you saying?

468
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,316
The rooster's up!

469
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:02,949
''l met a special girl this evening.''

470
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,425
''l met a special girl this evening.''

471
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:20,836
''My lips were sealed.''

472
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:25,412
''Such a fool, l was.''

473
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:31,180
''l didn't ask her name.''

474
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,327
''Dimwit.""

475
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,159
''ldiot.""

476
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:15,021
''Youthful hope has blown up

477
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:19,363
''ln just one meeting,
she has filled my heart""

478
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,429
''Youthful hope has blown up
like a balloon in my heart""

479
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,072
''ln just one meeting,
she has filled my heart""

480
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,010
''l threw away my chance with her''

481
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:37,484
''Such a duffer, l am.''

482
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:43,092
''l didn't even ask
what is it she does.''

483
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,491
''Dimwit.""

484
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,262

''ldiot.""

487
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:21,019
How can you just barge in like this?

488
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,121
Wait just a minute.

489
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:23,256
Allow us to do our job.

490
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,028
Farhad!
- Yes, mama.

491
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,591
Farhad!
- Yes, mama!

492
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,128
Mama, com ing!
- Farhad.

493
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:30,035
What's wrong? ...
- Please.

494
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,165
No, wait just a m inute.
My son's on his way.

495
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:33,503
Farhad, come quickly.

496
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,467
Mommy, who are they?

497
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,949
How can it be illegal?
My father built it 25 years ago.

498
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:43,417
Look, please don't interfere.

499
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:46,054
We have orders from
the secretary to break the tank.

500
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,989
l will teach that
Shirin Fuggawalla a lesson.

501
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:52,425
And you, break my tank and
see what l'll do to you.

502
00:27:52,495 --> 00:27:53,689
Aunty, this is my last warning.

503
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,430
Otherwise l'll have
to call the police.

504
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,227
l"m not scared of the police ...
- Police? ...

505
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,392
No, don't call the police.
- Then allow us do our job.

506
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,060
No, police.

507
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,535
Carefully.

508
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:03,427
Careful with that ladder.

509
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:05,497
Enough of this. Come on, get aside.

510
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:06,701
Move aside, you'll get hurt.

511
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,273
Move aside. You'll get hurt.

512
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:10,335
Move aside.
Why are you doing all this?

513
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:11,573
Something horrible might happen.

514
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,414
Watch it, be careful!

515
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:17,152
l"ll show that Shirin Fuggawalla.

516
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,388
Who does she think she is?

517
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:25,027
Your father built that
tank with so m uch love.

518
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:26,657
Don't worry.

519
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:30,662
l won't spare that Shirin Fuggawalla.

520
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
l will smash her.

521
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,601
l"ll go and burst that Shirin
Fuggawalla in her office right away.

522
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:39,268
So sweet my tiger.

523
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:42,772
Your father, Homi had done
only two good things in his time.

524
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,476
First, he built that tank.

525
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:46,638
And second, he gave me 'you'.

526
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,418
Don't worry, mama.

527
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:55,246
People think l'm a wim p.

528
00:28:56,292 --> 00:29:02,162
But at times, when it is necessary,
l can be vicious.

529
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:26,321
Yes. - l want to talk to
that Shirin Fuggawalla.

530
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,420
l"m sorry, but ma'am is busy.

531
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:29,651
You'll have to take an appointment.

532
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,657
No, l want to see her right now.

533
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,120
Just a minute.

534
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:38,560
Hello, ma'am . Mr. Farhad
Pastakia's here to see you.

539
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:02,557
Hi, Farhad.

00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,621

You found me, how?

542
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:09,562

00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,764
Farhad, you always surprise me.

546
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,235
At times, l surprise myself too!

547
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,270
Remem ber what you'd

548
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,507

You said the next time we meet ...

550
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,811
Oh yes, of course.

551
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:30,648
Can't go against destiny now, can we?

552
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,415
Take down my number.
- One minute please.

553
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:37,192

Save.

558
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,360
Oh, it's yours.

00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,163
l"ll be right back.

560
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,577
Mama ...
- What did she say?

561
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,506
l gave it to her left,
right and centre.

562
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,876
Well done my tiger, well done.

563
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:08,820
Don't spare her.

564
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:10,756
l"ll come home and
tell you everything.

565
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,316
Okay.

566
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:21,369
Hello.

567
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:23,933
Save it, okay.

568
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:25,362
Crack pot.

569
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:28,200
Coffee?
- Coffee?

570
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,569
Yes.
- Okay.

571
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,410
Nice place.
- Very nice.

572
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:34,380
You come here often.

573
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,543
l bring mommy here.
- Your mummy.

574
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,619
Here, for coffee?
- Yes.

575
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,484
How sweet.

576
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:42,788
... is an old acquaintance,
since when l was young.

577
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:43,847
How about some bread and butter?

578
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,292
The bread's fine, but no butter.
- Why?

579
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:47,722
l shouldn"t.

580
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:48,889
Health reasons?

581
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,325
Even l agree.

582
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,630
Our thoughts are so similar.
- Thoughts?

583
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:55,695
Now that we're friends.

584
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:59,669
We should know each
others' likes and dislikes.

585
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:02,343
What's your favourite colour?

586
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:03,736
Let me guess.

587
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:05,678
l think so, 100% it"s black.

588
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,982
Correct? What a coincidence.

589
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:12,352
What's your favourite...food?

590
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:14,254
Let me guess.

591
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:17,256
l"m sure it is... 'Salli boti".

592
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,554
Correct?

593
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,320
Me too. What a coincidence.

594
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:23,232
What's your favourite drink?

595
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:24,959
Let me guess.

596
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,534
100%. According to me,
has to be Mangola.

597
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:31,237
ls it Mangola?

598
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:32,501
Mangola? Yes?

599
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:33,740
See. Me too.

600
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:34,867
What a coincidence.

601
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:37,572
Who is your favourite actor?

602
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,010
Ranbir Roshan.

603
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,850
Me too.
- l see.

604
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:44,612
What a fine actor!

605
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:45,811
He dances well too, right?

606
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:46,946
Brilliant dancer.

607
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:49,852
There is no such actor.
- No?

608
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:52,894
l just made it up to test you.

609
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,361
Ranbir Roshan! Caught you.

610
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,289
Fine.

611
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:02,565
And so, what's the result on the test?

612
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,470
Positive.
- Positive?

613
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:13,505
Shirin. l want to ask
you a personal question.

614
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,918
Only if you let me answer.

615
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:23,714
Do you have a boyfriend?

616
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,785
No. Do you?

617
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:32,892
What nonsense, Shirin?

618
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,562
Let"s sit there.
- Yes.

619
00:33:37,907 --> 00:33:40,307
120 for a cafe laatee.

620
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:42,003
Not laatee, its latte.

621
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:43,036
Come.

622
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:50,507
Welcome, ma'am.
- Hello.

623
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:51,746
Welcome, sir.

00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,980
One ... coffee.
- l'll have another coffee.

625
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:55,785
Coffee ... and tea for me.

626
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:59,789
And a ... chocolate pastry.
One by two.

627
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,723
Two spoons.
- Thank you, sir.

628
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,396
Shirin.

629
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,664
You're a very nice person.
- Thank you.

630
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:07,965
Really. l mean it.
- Thank you.

631
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,601
And may all your dreams come true.

632
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:12,700
l have a dream too.

633
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,074
Underworld.
- Underworld!

634
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:17,469
You want to be a don?

635
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,575
Where do l work now?

636
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:21,910
Undergarments.

637
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:24,809
Under..
- Aah, very clever.

638
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:28,714
Actually, l wish to buy out Tem Tem's.

639
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,616
As it is, the boss
relies on me completely.

640
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,457
That' won't be a problem .

641
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,561
l"ve asked my cousin Hormuz..

642
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,122
... to get me a loan passed
from the Zoroastrian bank.

643
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,828
But he doesn"t take me seriously.

644
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:42,903
Thanks.

645
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:44,064
You think it"s a good idea?

646
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,869
Farhad, l think it"s a very good idea.

647
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,738
And you should do it.
- Really?

648
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,143
lf business is good, we'll expand
to a first floor, then a second.

649
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:55,743
And soon enough we will
have a departmental store.

650
00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:58,813
We?
- Yes, 'we" ...

651
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:02,551
... because you're the first
one who truly understands me.

652
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:18,168
Sorry, l got carried away
there for a moment. - lt's fine.

653
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:22,773
You know l like talking to you.

654
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:25,674
And you also listen to me.

655
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:28,078
l don't have a choice, Farhad.

656
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,907
You never let me speak.

657
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,682
Actually, l've been talking
about my own self the whole time ...

658
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,984
... and never asked about you.

659
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:37,117
Look at the time.

660
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,924
Oh my God, four hours!

661
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:44,792
l"ll drop you home.
- No need, we've arrived.

662
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,998
Wow, we"re here?

663
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:47,160
That's your house? Great.

664
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:51,196
l had a great time.

665
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,204
Frankly speaking, even
l had a wonderful time.

666
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:59,812
Okay, goodnight.

667
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:01,844
l really enjoyed.
- Goodnight.

668
00:36:02,051 --> 00:36:03,575
Really. Go, leave.

669
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:05,911
Goodnight.

670
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:08,486
Let go of me. Goodnight.

671
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:09,888
Call me.
- Okay.

672
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,926
Anytime.
- Okay.

673
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:12,119

- Okay.

00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:13,957
24-7.
- Really?

675
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:15,987
Not between 1 1 -7 though.

676
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:17,498
l sleep at that time.

677
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,965
My sleep is very important.

678
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:35,080
''Sweet and sour ...
just like a strawberry..''

679
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:50,488
''My desires, they happily soar.""

680
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:58,838
''My wishes, they seem mellow.''

681
00:36:59,108 --> 00:37:00,939

''Sweet and sour ...

''My heart was lying...''

690
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:08,141
''..in some drawer like an object.''

691
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:13,313
''Life was meaningless.''

692
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:18,179
''What else do l say?""

693
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:23,784
''The windows were closed.''

''My thoughts could never take flight.''

695

''My dreams were
lonely in a closed house.""

696
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:46,778
''Now there's a tingle in my heart ...''

697

''My feelings have taken on colour.''

698
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:52,013

''Sweet and sour ...

705
00:39:36,932 --> 00:39:38,331
Mama.

706
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:40,363
Mama.

707
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,001
What is it?

Love?

712
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:59,377
Boy or girl?
- What rubbish you say sometimes?

713
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:06,393
Have you told her you love her?
- No, mama, not yet.

714
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:08,294
No?
- No.

715
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:10,761
l will, l will. No problem.

716
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:15,361
But ... we've become
very close friends. - l see.

717
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,467
And what's your close friend's name?

718
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:24,110
Shirin.
- Shirin. Oh wow.

719
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,238
Shirin
- Farhad!

720
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:31,418
What does she do?

721
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:39,324
Mama ...
- Just say it, don't stretch it out.

722
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:41,123
Mama, she's ...

723
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:46,294
The Secretary at the Parsi Trust.

724
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:50,064
Her!

725
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,447
Farhad.

726
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:01,446
lm possible.

727
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:05,086
What are you two whispering on about?

728
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:08,380
Siloo mama's too funny.

729
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,225
Very funny.

730
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:15,259
Mama, don't make any
plans for this Sunday. - Why?

731
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,994
That's a surprise.

732
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:21,766
Wow. Surprise? l love surprises.

733
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:23,468
But l don't like suspense.

734
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,540
lt's definitely a surprise.

735
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,804
Mama.

736
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,910
Rubbish ...

737
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:38,043
What rubbish are you saying?

738
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,287
But why should we
pay more for security?

739
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:43,415
The security in our
society's already good enough.

740
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:45,323
Why would you be
worried about security?

741
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:48,124
Your wife roams around with
everyone in the colony as it is.

742
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:50,324
Why you ...

743
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,899
Leave me. Leave me.

744
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:57,338
Order! Order!

745
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:32,099
Rascal.

746
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,169
Scoundrel!

747
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:35,403
Silent.

748
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:40,545
Please, be seated everyone.

749
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:46,581
You are spoiling the arrangement.

750
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,557
Don't do that.

751
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,486
What is this?

752
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:58,363
What's going on?

753
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,367
Calm down!

754
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,504
Please! Calm down!

755
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:07,974
Stop it.

756
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:16,345
Here son, your flowers.
- Thank you.

757
00:43:17,352 --> 00:43:19,286
Don't you understand anything?

758
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:21,415
Calm down!

759
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,457
Stop it.

760
00:43:22,524 --> 00:43:24,082
Calm down, calm down.

761
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,319
Behave yourself.

762
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,157
Uncle, may l sit here?
- Sit, sit.

763
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,163
What's going on here? l don't like it.

764
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:32,290
What can l say?

765
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,096
They ruined the flowers l had brought.

766
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:35,329
Leave all that.

767
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,896
First tell me,
do you live in A-block or B-block?

768
00:43:38,974 --> 00:43:40,498
Uncle, l'm not from this colony.

769
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:42,668
What? You've come here
to watch the circus?

770
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:44,537
Get lost.

771
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,911
My stick. My stick.

772
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:51,375
Please. Calm down.

773
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:53,019
Maintain some decorum .

774
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:54,987
Dr. Driver is coming.

775
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:56,524
Sit down.

776
00:43:58,293 --> 00:44:01,490
Oh, God. Thank you, Lord.

777
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:12,606
Ladies and gentlemen.

778
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:19,039
l am of the opinion that we m ust
all agree to pay more for our safety.

779
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:25,119
l understand that 10 rupees
every month is not a small amount.

780
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:28,019
But we should also remember this ...

781
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:31,993
... that we live in dangerous times.

782
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:36,156
Last month ... there were two
crimes com mitted in the colony.

783
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:41,493
Someone stole Pesi's
half-drunk Rum bottle ...

784
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,003
... from his own balcony.

785
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,504
And the second crime ...

786
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,734
... to even speak of it, l am ashamed.

787
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:52,208
But someone was watching Temina
undress through her bedroom window.

788
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:57,147
Shocking!

789
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:03,217
Considering this serious situation,
l have just one request.

790
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:05,590
Our security guards ...

791
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,118
... should be given
machine guns and hand grenades.

792
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,428
Doctor!

793
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:14,994
You swine!

794
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,334
Try and put your hand on me now!

795
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:20,170
See what l'll do to you.

796
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:24,076
Rascal.
You got me beaten up by your men.

797
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:25,579
Me, Sohrab.

798
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:29,616
Doctor, where are you?

799
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:31,117
Where are you?

800
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:34,111
Mama.

801
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:44,358
Shirin. Shirin.

802
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,100
Beroze, just listen ...

803
00:45:47,169 --> 00:45:49,660
Silloo mama told me ...

804
00:45:49,738 --> 00:45:52,764
... that Farhad's bringing a
girl home for the first time.

805
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,668
Here, for lunch.

806
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,139
Farhad. What happened?

807
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,546
Later.

808
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:04,183
First, meet my friend.

809
00:46:04,252 --> 00:46:05,742
Shirin Fuggawala.

810
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:07,655
l see.

811
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:10,288
Hello, Shirin.
- Hello, aunty.

812
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:12,152
Welcome. Welcome.

813
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,661
Nargis.

814
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:18,098
Look, your surprise is here.

815
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,633
Coming, mama. They're here.

816
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:24,329
Hello, aunty.
- Hello.

817
00:46:24,439 --> 00:46:26,066
Wait, wait.

818
00:46:34,216 --> 00:46:35,581
She's a good girl.

819
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,387
Have it.
- Farhad, what are you doing?

820
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,223
Are both of you fine?

821
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,553
What happened to you'll?

822
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:48,187
Leave some fun for after marriage too.

823
00:46:48,363 --> 00:46:49,330
Mom..

824
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,623
Some more Salli ...

825
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,328
You know how these Trust meetings are.

826
00:46:55,337 --> 00:46:57,567
But l hope nothing
happened to you, Shirin.

827
00:46:57,806 --> 00:46:59,671
Aunty, l"ve been working in
the Trust for a while now.

828
00:46:59,741 --> 00:47:02,767
Dealing with these mad men on
a daily basis is part of my job.

829
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:05,245
Take your colony, Cusrow Baug,
for instance, ...

830
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:08,714
... an old hag's been
troubling me for a month now.

831
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:09,715
So irritating, l tell you.

832
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:11,775
Some more 'Salli Boti', darling.
- Enough.

833
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:13,582
Have some more "Salli Boti".
- Why?

834
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:16,522
lt's about some
illegal water tank of hers.

835
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:19,623
l had her tank torn down.

836
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,597
Mama ... Why don't you tell her ...

837
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:27,692
Forget all this.

838
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:29,760
... Tell her about the man
who beat me with that stick.

839
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:32,506
Had l gotten hold of that stick ...

840
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:37,244
..in places l don't want to mention.

841
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,607
This is very good.
- She's so funny.

842
00:47:40,682 --> 00:47:42,673
And you know what else happened, mama?

843
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:45,811
A man pulled out a gun and fired it
right in the middle of the meeting.

844
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:49,752
Oh, darling. You have no idea.
Had l gotten hold of that gun earlier...

845
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,622
...l would've blown
that old hag to pieces.

846
00:47:53,895 --> 00:47:55,590
Aunty?
- What happened, mama?

847
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:56,888
Mama.
- Oh, God. She's choking.

848
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,154
Help her.
- No, no.

849
00:47:58,233 --> 00:47:59,222
No, no.
- Yes, she's choking.

850
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:00,825
What are you doing? She's choking.

851
00:48:00,902 --> 00:48:01,926
Mama.
- Aunty, drink some water.

852
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,638
Mama. Mama.
- Drink some water.

853
00:48:04,873 --> 00:48:06,534
Drink some water. Please, drink water.

854
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,269
She is choking.
- Shirin.

855
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,605
Oh, God. She"s choking.

856
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,270
Aunty! Aunty!

857
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,782
Farhad, l think something"s
wrong with the prawn curry.

858
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,384
Shirin!

859
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:19,852
l knew something was wrong
as soon as l'd eaten it.

860
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:22,321
Aunty, these servants don't
cook well at all these days.

861
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:23,448
And to top that, the
prawns itself wasn't fresh.

862
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:24,456
See, she's choking.

863
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,356
Aunty! Aunty!

864
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:28,787
Aunty! l think a piece
is stuck in her throat.

865
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:32,266
lt's stuck.
- Shirin.

866
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,262
Farhad! Farhad!

867
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:38,432
Don't worry, son.

868
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,805
Everything will be fine.

869
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,971
But my judgement was right ...

870
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,374
... Nargis was 'blown to
bits' by your surprise.

871
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,439
l didn't know.

872
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:52,816
l didn't know my son would
turn out to be so useless.

873
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:56,451
Out of all the girls in the world,
you could find only this one? ...

874
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:57,923
... the one that
happens to be my enemy.

875
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:59,483
Mama, l've grown old now ...

876
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:02,495
... and for the first time
l"m in love.

877
00:49:02,597 --> 00:49:03,859
l"m in love. What can l do now?

878
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,399
Oh, shut up.

879
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:07,925
Let me make one thing
very clear with you.

880
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:11,567
Either it's that
Shirin of yours or me.

881
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,937
You have to make a choice.

882
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:16,833
But, mama. You're the one who asked me
to find a nice girl and get married.

883
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:20,369
Now, l'm the very same one
telling you, ""Don"t, Don't, Don"t!''

884
00:49:23,985 --> 00:49:26,852
He's out to make my enemy,
my daughter-in-law!

885
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:30,882
Looks like l raised you wrong ...

886
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:34,759
.. for you to have turned
into such a useless fool.

887
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:39,799
Homi Pastakia.

888
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:42,967
You flew away on
your plane for good ...

889
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:45,936
... leaving your idiot
son with me in this mess.

890
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:48,968
That tank you had so
affectionately built for me ...

891
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:51,902
... that Shirin
Fuggawala had it demolished.

892
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,813
And now your son, he is in
love with that very same woman ...

893
00:49:54,883 --> 00:49:56,612
... wants to marry her.

894
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:01,720
Be warned, Farhad Pastakia.
This marriage will never happen.

895
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,055
Shirin Fuggawala will never
become my daughter-in-law.

896
00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:07,318
Never! Never! Never!

897
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:21,364
Thank you.

898
00:50:21,443 --> 00:50:22,740
Aunty.

899
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,642
How are you?
- Fine.

900
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:26,613
How are you? Please eat well.

901
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:27,841
She's all grown up.

902
00:50:28,783 --> 00:50:30,614
You didn"t call me.

903
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:31,549
How are you?

904
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:32,415
All well.

905
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:39,457
Have food before leaving.
- Congratulations.

906
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:51,562
Hip Hip Hurray!

907
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,875
Congratulations to our
dearest Anahita and Farhad.

908
00:50:58,747 --> 00:51:00,510
He is mad.

909
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,441
Rascal.

910
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,577
He's saying that just to hurt Farhad.
- Forget it.

911
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,014
He's a nutcase.

912
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,121
Shirin!

913
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:12,920
Feroze uncle, that's not
lndira Gandhi. That's enough.

914
00:51:12,994 --> 00:51:14,985
Hi.
- What are you doing here?

915
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:17,561
Who"s the caterer?
- Godiwala.

916
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:19,962
So here l am . l don't need an invitation
when there's a good spread.

917
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:21,899
And are you here for the free alcohol?

918
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,665
l am on the welcoming com mittee.

919
00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:24,932
Hormuz is my cousin brother.

920
00:51:25,006 --> 00:51:27,474
Really? Anahita and l have
been friends for a long time!!

921
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,009
Farhad, you"re on the
welcoming committee, aren't you?

922
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:31,008
Won"t you welcome me?

923
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,016
Shall we.
- Come. - Come on.

924
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:37,551
Feroze Uncle, stay here.

925
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:38,950
Welcome the others.

926
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:44,681
Oh wow, your mommy"s
looking stunning today, Farhad.

927
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,552
Hi, Aunty ...

928
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:49,590
Let"s go meet her.
- No, later

929
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:56,531
What are you doing, Farhad?
- Let me think.

930
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:58,135
What's there to think?

931
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,471
Anahita and Horm uz ...

932
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,507
What are you saying?
- Listen to me.

933
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,773
On the count of three.

934
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:07,644
One, two, three ...

935
00:52:07,715 --> 00:52:09,080
Farhad!

936
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,848
Farhad, where are we going?

937
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:18,687
Bloody rascal ...

938
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,767
Nargis, look.

939
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,204
Farhad has finally found a girl.

940
00:52:32,507 --> 00:52:33,667
Take a look.

941
00:52:34,709 --> 00:52:35,903
l can see.

942
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:41,214
l think we should go on the stage..

943
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,609
Get him up with Hormuz on the stage.

944
00:52:44,686 --> 00:52:45,846
Are you crazy?

945
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:49,988
She's the one who broke my tank.

946
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:52,619
The one from the Trust?

947
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:58,230
Where did she go?
- Yeah.

948
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,899
Farhad, where are
you whisking me off to?

949
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,773
lt looks very bad, we shouldn't
have left the wedding like that.

950
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:14,508
lf we hadn"t left when we left,
there would've been a riot there.

951
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:15,879
Riot? Why?

952
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:17,049
l"m just kidding.

953
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:19,780
And by the way, my
granny really likes you.

954
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:23,551
Really? But just granny,
not your mommy?

955
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,820
Actually, mommy ...
- lt"s actually my fault.

956
00:53:25,894 --> 00:53:28,920
l shouldn"t have commented
on her prawn curry. - Right.

957
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,192
Really, l'm so stupid.

958
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:33,996
Fat people are so sensitive.

959
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:35,969
Don't keep saying 'fat'!

960
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:37,163
She'd feel bad.
- l know.

961
00:53:37,238 --> 00:53:38,671
Atleast, don"t say it to her face ...
- l know. Old people can be so ...

962
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,674
What old? Don't call her 'old' too.

963
00:53:40,742 --> 00:53:42,039
You're crazy.

964
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,610
Sarosh.
- Nargis aunty. How are you?

965
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,013
Where is Farhad?

966
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,550
Farhad?

967
00:53:50,818 --> 00:53:53,082
Did you see him?
- Don't know. l just arrived.

968
00:53:53,154 --> 00:53:54,712
l got late.

969
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,122
Nargis.

970
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:05,856
Wait.

971
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,162
He's disconnecting my calls.

972
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,636
Wonder where she took him.

973
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:10,762
They must be around.

974
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:12,567
Don't worry. Smile for the photo.

975
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,641
Nargis!

976
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:17,803
Smile please.

977
00:54:23,585 --> 00:54:24,779
Another call from mom.

978
00:54:26,187 --> 00:54:26,983
He just isn"t answering.

979
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,249
He keeps disconnecting my call.

980
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:29,654
l wonder where he is.

981
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:31,619
Let him come, l'll show him .

982
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:39,733
Nargis aunty, shall l drop you home.
- No, no.

983
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,801
We'll go with Farhad
when he gets here.

984
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:44,963
l"ll drop you.
- No, son. You can go.

985
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:47,106
Go.
- Okay. Goodnight.

986
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:48,335
Goodnight.

987
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,009
Farhad, it's really a beautiful place.

988
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,177
What is it?

989
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,118
lt's not just a beautiful place.

990
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:03,315
l come here when l'm sad.

991
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:06,152
And also when l'm happy.

992
00:55:06,794 --> 00:55:10,025
Because no one butts in,
questions me ...

993
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,259
... or judges me here.

994
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:14,734
lt's a very special
place for me, Shirin.

995
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:19,633
And you're the first
person l brought here.

996
00:55:19,907 --> 00:55:21,169
Me? Really?

997
00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:23,142
You know why?

998
00:55:26,648 --> 00:55:29,913
Because ... you"re special.

999
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,894
Farhad, it's raining.

1000
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,231
Let"s go to my place.

1001
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:25,235
l"ll make you some coffee.
- Coffee?

1002
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,866
Okay, come.
- Come on, come on.

1003
00:56:31,112 --> 00:56:33,740
Nargis, how long will we stand here?

1004
00:56:33,815 --> 00:56:36,045
lt's raining heavily now.

1005
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:38,413
Let"s hire a taxi and go home

1006
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:42,415
Oh god!

1007
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,418
Shirin, towel.
- Just a minute.

1008
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,459
Here.
- Thanks.

1009
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,164
Shirin, where are you going?

1010
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:55,168
l"ll just go change, Farhad.

1011
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:56,794
Just be comfortable.

1012
00:57:03,444 --> 00:57:05,776
Even this wiper
had to stop working now.

1013
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:08,145
Hello, Farhad.

1014
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,042
Where are you?

1015
00:57:10,118 --> 00:57:12,018
You left Nargis aunty alone out there.

1016
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:13,751
You know she's very upset.

1017
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:14,913
l"m at Shirin's house.

1018
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:16,854
She said, ""Let's go have coffee"".

1019
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,155
Oh! You're all set brother.

1020
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:23,026
Why?
- What do you mean 'why'?

1021
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:25,930
Do you know what it means when a
girl invites you home for coffee?

1022
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,899
What?
- Sex.

1023
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:31,862
What are you saying?

1024
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:33,236
Are you trying to fool me?

1025
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,933
So, how will l know?

1026
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,171
Will she give me a hint?
- Of course she will.

1027
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,346
lf she starts playing 'mood' m usic ...

1028
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:42,314
... then understand, that's a hint.

1029
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:44,880
What music ...

1030
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,223
l love this song.

1031
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:55,262
''l feel it. Wonderful feeling.""

1032
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:57,864
Farhad, you like this song?

1033
00:57:58,232 --> 00:58:03,033
''She's the reason for this feeling.''

1034
00:58:03,437 --> 00:58:05,997
''lt's rising.""

1035
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:07,404
''lt just keeps rising.""

1036
00:58:07,475 --> 00:58:09,807
l just love this song.

1037
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:12,946
She played music.

1038
00:58:13,014 --> 00:58:14,276
She played music!!
- Yes!

1039
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,881
Go on, what else? What other hints?

1040
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,179
What else would she do?

1041
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:19,947
She'll give you
other hints ... like ...

1042
00:58:20,254 --> 00:58:22,313
She'll offer you chocolate.
- Chocolate?

1043
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:23,421
Why chocolate?

1044
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:26,051
Chocolate means energy.

1045
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,060
Energy means aaahahahaha ...

1046
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,424
Farhad.

1047
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:33,033
Coffee or tea?

1049
00:58:36,337 --> 00:58:37,463
Chocolate?

1050
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:43,035
Hot chocolate. Give me two minutes.

1051
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:47,046
She offered me chocolate.

1052
00:58:47,114 --> 00:58:48,945
Hot chocolate.

1053
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,477
Hot chocolate !!

1054
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:53,520
''Be my bedroom girl.""

1055
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:58,121
''My pretty girl.""

1056
00:58:58,459 --> 00:58:59,949
Farhad.
- Yeah.

1057
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:01,324
Get comfortable.

1058
00:59:11,272 --> 00:59:14,867
Do me a big favour and
please don't disturb me.

1059
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:17,843
Because l'm going to be very busy.

1060
00:59:17,912 --> 00:59:19,539
Okay, okay, l won't.

1061
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:22,310
Listen, time to get in to action, bro.

1062
00:59:22,383 --> 00:59:23,441
All the best.

1063
00:59:23,517 --> 00:59:24,575
Bye.

1064
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:31,256
Oh no.

1065
00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:34,023
He's finally on a roll.

1066
00:59:53,614 --> 00:59:54,638
What are you doing?

1067
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,577
Shirin, my clothes
were com pletely drenched..

1068
00:59:56,651 --> 00:59:58,278
..so l took them off.

1069
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,484
l"m very sorry, Shirin.

1070
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,153
Bastard Sarosh.

1071
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,325
Shirin? Shirin.

1072
01:00:15,436 --> 01:00:18,337
Shirin, the towel's
completely drenched.

1073
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:19,464
lt needs to be dried.

1074
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:23,406
What happened was, see
the window was open..

1075
01:00:23,477 --> 01:00:27,573
..and the breeze was making
my clothes stick to my skin.

1076
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:30,108
And you said ""Get comfortable"".

1077
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:31,378
So l got comfortable.

1078
01:00:32,954 --> 01:00:34,387
l was feeling cold.
- Cold?

1079
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,114
l thought you were
feeling a little too hot.

1080
01:00:38,993 --> 01:00:40,460
Whose clothes are these?
- My papa's.

1081
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:41,927
Your papa's clothes?

1082
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:43,257
Do you want to meet him?

1083
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:46,031
ln his clothes?
- Farhad.

1084
01:00:46,233 --> 01:00:48,224
l really want you to meet my papa.

1085
01:00:48,502 --> 01:00:49,696
Come on.
- What are you saying?

1086
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:51,165
Just relax. Come on.

1087
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:52,469
Come. Come.

1088
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,201
ls he a nice guy?

1089
01:00:58,546 --> 01:00:59,376
Come.

1090
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,414
Okay.

1091
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:11,723
Farhad, he's my papa.

1092
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,084
He's been in a coma since many years.

1093
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:15,727
How did this happen?

1094
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:19,228
Years ago we had
thrown a party at home.

1095
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,460
lt was papa's birthday.

1096
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:22,532
He'd asked me to go get him Mangola.

1097
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:24,434
When l went into the
kitchen to get it ...

1098
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:26,336
... l heard a lot of
commotion out here ...

1099
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:28,534
And when l got back,
l found papa on the floor.

1100
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,274
We rushed him to the hospital.
Doctors, the whole nine yards.

1101
01:01:31,345 --> 01:01:34,508
But we still don"t know
how and why it happened.

1102
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:39,209
How did you take care
of him all these years?

1103
01:01:39,553 --> 01:01:42,249
You know, sometimes
when l think about it ...

1104
01:01:42,556 --> 01:01:44,114
l mean, it was impossible.

1105
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:45,749
But if it wasn"t for Dhun aunty.

1106
01:01:46,027 --> 01:01:47,756
Dhun aunty?
- Papa's sister.

1107
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:49,420
She's gone out tonight.

1108
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,589
Thank God.

1109
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,626
Dhun aunty left
everything and came here ...

1110
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:57,432
... and looked after papa and me both.

1111
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,665
She's an ...

1112
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,367
She's an angel.

1113
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,467
Now you know Mr. Pastakia
why l didn't marry?

1114
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,514
Who would be willing to take
on this added responsibility?

1115
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:14,146
Or stay with me here,
under my roof, after marriage?

1116
01:02:15,222 --> 01:02:16,519
lt's not going to happen.

1117
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,385
And l will never leave my papa.

1118
01:02:22,163 --> 01:02:24,529
Frankly Shirin, it's not a big deal.

1119
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,193
lt's not that
burdensome a responsibility.

1120
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,798
For example,

1121
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,772
l would do it happily.

1122
01:02:39,346 --> 01:02:40,278
Come here.

1123
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,450
Give me your hand.

1124
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:55,522
Papa.

1125
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,658
My boyfriend.

1126
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,092
Boyfriend?

1127
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:03,734
You just proposed indirectly ...

1128
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:06,238
... responsibility and all that,
and now you ask ""Boyfriend'' ?

1129
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:08,774
Yes or no?

1130
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:11,304
Okay, Boyfriend.

1131
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:17,374
Welcome to the family.

1132
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:19,381
Papa.

1133
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:21,415
Sorry.

1134
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:36,430
Shirin.

1135
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,668
Can l hug you?
- Yes.

1136
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:46,807
ls that too tight?

1137
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:48,476
No, hold me tighter.

1138
01:03:52,353 --> 01:03:54,583
Farhad, what are you doing?

1139
01:03:54,655 --> 01:03:55,849
What are you doing?
- Shirin.

1140
01:03:58,192 --> 01:03:59,489
Bugger, leave me.

1141
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,585
You just said l'm your boyfriend.

1142
01:04:01,762 --> 01:04:02,729
So you"ll do this.

1143
01:04:03,397 --> 01:04:04,694
Here, start again.

1144
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:37,394
''This friendship's...
become dearer than life.''

1145
01:04:38,299 --> 01:04:45,364
''This friendship's...
become dearer than life.''

1146
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,501
''Your love's..''

1147
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:56,413
''l've seen some beautiful dreams too.''

1148
01:04:58,419 --> 01:05:01,684
''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1149
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:06,754
''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1150
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,204
''After we met..''

1151
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:26,405
''l realized what my life was.""

1152
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:29,712
''My life.''

1153
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:37,348
''Smiles on my face,
but my heart was empty.""

1154
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,855
''My life.''

1155
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,422
''Your love's..''

1156
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:50,463
''l've plucked a few flowers too.""

1157
01:05:52,606 --> 01:05:56,007
''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1158
01:05:57,778 --> 01:06:00,906
''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1159
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:24,303
''You've filled my heart with desires.''

1160
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:25,770
''lt's wonderful.""

1161
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:28,675
''lt's wonderful.""

1162
01:06:29,643 --> 01:06:31,907
''l was out of tune.""

1163
01:06:31,979 --> 01:06:34,470
''But you turned it into melody.''

1164
01:06:34,548 --> 01:06:36,641
''lt's wonderful.""

1165
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,943

''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1169
01:06:57,371 --> 01:07:00,033
''Without your love...l'm so lonely.''

1170
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:03,876
Sarosh, handle the shop today.

1171
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,538
Tell the boss that l'm
unwell or something.

1172
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:09,777
l am going to Shirin's house.

1173
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,911
Dhun aunty?

1174
01:07:13,854 --> 01:07:16,687
Farhad, don't you think this
is going a little too fast?

1175
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:18,952
Of course, she'll
give the final approval.

1176
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,693
And then l"ll handle mom my.

1177
01:07:23,931 --> 01:07:25,421
Mama.

1178
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:27,990
Hi, mama. l'm talking to Sarosh.

1179
01:07:29,036 --> 01:07:30,094
Oh no!

1180
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:31,838
l think mama's heard everything.

1181
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,731
l"ve lost my son.

1182
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:39,745
How do l save him from her clutches?

1183
01:07:39,813 --> 01:07:42,509
Sarosh. Wish me luck.

1184
01:07:42,816 --> 01:07:44,875
Mama, Farhad has started lying.

1185
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,726
And all this is because of that girl.
- No, Nargis.

1186
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:55,825
Shirin"s a nice girl.

1187
01:07:55,896 --> 01:07:59,992
lf Shirin comes into this house,
she"ll throw us both out.

1188
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:01,466
What do l do now?

1189
01:08:01,668 --> 01:08:02,930
Walk straight.

1190
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,863
Believe me when l say this, mama ...

1191
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:11,669
... Shirin and Farhad
will never get married.

1192
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:24,113
Lord, now You please do something.

1193
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:35,459
Hello, aunty.

01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,095

01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:39,966
This is for you.

Hi, Farhad.
- Hi, Shirin.

1202
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:55,987
So late you've come.

1203
01:08:56,056 --> 01:08:58,115
So, the 38D was for her.

1204
01:08:58,192 --> 01:09:01,719
That day l was confused
why you were buying a 38D.

1205
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:03,057
Crackpot.

1206
01:09:12,473 --> 01:09:16,807
For years l"ve written
about myself in bio-datas ...

1207
01:09:16,877 --> 01:09:20,210
... for all these
matrimonial agencies.

1208
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:22,443
So, l'll tell you the same thing?

An over-loving mother and grandmother.

... 'Underworld'.

1215
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:07,126
First love, Shirin.

1216
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:11,028
And my last love, Shirin.

1217
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:14,498
That's all.

1218
01:10:19,873 --> 01:10:21,204
Go get the phone.
- Phone?

1219
01:10:21,942 --> 01:10:23,000
Stupid.

1220

Don't you want to book the spot
for your marriage? - Marriage?

Love you. Love you.

1223
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,175
Shirin, this is just like in films.

''The road is long.''

''Everyone on this journey...""

1236

''The road's long.''

1260
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:11,897

Shall we order?

lt isn't that expensive.

1264

Farhad, this is very expensive.

1265
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:26,318
Don't worry.
- Are you sure?

1266
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:28,754
Will we have to wash the dishes?

1267
01:14:28,822 --> 01:14:29,789
Hello, sir. Hello, ma"am.

1268

Don't eat yet, we'll eat together.

1275

Hello, mama.

call you for a while now.

1279
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:56,276
Listen, we're taking
Feroze uncle to the hospital.

1280

01:15:03,056 --> 01:15:04,114
He hasn't been able to fart.

1286
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:05,385
What do you mean?

1287
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:08,052
He can't fart. He can't fart.

1288

Yes. Ambulance.

1296
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,043
Why? - There was a
diamond ring in the cherry.

1297
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,214
What, Farhad?

1298
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,880
l wanted to surprise you.
- Diamond ring in the cherry.

1299
01:15:36,957 --> 01:15:38,219
l wanted to surprise you.

1300
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,849
l tell you, darling,

1301
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:40,984

Don't touch.

Shirin, nothing will happen
to you. Nothing. Lie down.

1310
01:15:54,274 --> 01:15:55,263
Shirin, what are you doing?

1311
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:56,603
Leave the doctor.

1312
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:59,601
Someone save the doctor.
Have you gone mad?

1313
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,472
Shirin, you've gone hysterical.

1314
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:03,448
Shirin, you've gone hysterical.

1315
01:16:03,617 --> 01:16:05,278
Tomorrow morning,
we"ll be drinking coffee ...

1316
01:16:05,886 --> 01:16:07,114
Easy.

1317
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,878
Easy.

1318
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:10,588
Don't touch.
- Easy, easy.

1319
01:16:10,924 --> 01:16:12,255
Look, it's simple.

1320
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:14,051
We'll have to just flush it out.

1321
01:16:14,127 --> 01:16:15,253
Flush!

1322
01:16:15,562 --> 01:16:17,052
lt's just a tube.

1323
01:16:17,297 --> 01:16:18,389
Tube!

1324
01:16:18,932 --> 01:16:20,365
Just soap water.

1325
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,300
Soap water? What is happening?

1326
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:23,426
Relax.

1327
01:16:24,437 --> 01:16:27,270
Nurse, get it done.
- Thank you.

1328
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,032
You'll be alright. Simple.

1329
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:30,303
You'll be alright.
- Farhad.

1330
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,344
No. No.

1331
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:33,606
Can you do anything normally?

1332
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,541
l never imagined my
engagement ring ...

1333
01:16:35,615 --> 01:16:37,242
... will be coming out of there.

1334
01:16:37,317 --> 01:16:40,252
Tomorrow morning we'll sit in
the balcony and have coffee.

1335
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,187
l will kill you Farhad if they put
a tube up my ... - lt will come out.

1336
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,627
lt hurts here.

1337
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:49,919
Did the air pass?

1338
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:52,590
Whenever l open the window
the air passes in and out.

1339
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,526
l meant to say, 'fart'.

1340
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:58,594
Usually, whenever l walk, talk,
sit and stand - l seem to fart healthy.

1341
01:16:58,672 --> 01:17:00,572
But l haven't been able
to for the past two days.

1342
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,576
Nurse, inform me as soon as he farts.
- Yes, doctor.

1343
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,405
l"ll be back soon, okay.

1344
01:17:08,181 --> 01:17:10,274
Nargis, inform
lndira of the situation.

1345
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,220
The entire nation's running on gas ...

1346
01:17:14,287 --> 01:17:16,448
..and here, l alone cannot pass air.

1347
01:17:21,361 --> 01:17:23,989
Nurse. Just a minute.
- What happened?

1348
01:17:24,297 --> 01:17:26,288
Don't put that in the pot.
- Why?

1349
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:27,663
You do know what this is, right?

1350
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:29,332
l know, aunty. l know.

1351
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:32,530
But the problem is
there's a diamond ring in it.

1352
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,470
Oh my, where have you put the ring!

1353
01:17:35,308 --> 01:17:36,639
lt's a very long story.

1354
01:17:37,544 --> 01:17:38,670
Don't put it in the pot yet.

1355
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,069
Give it to me, l'll keep it safe.

1356
01:17:40,146 --> 01:17:42,239
No, no, that's my job.
- l'll keep it.

1357
01:17:42,315 --> 01:17:43,612
Aunty.
- lt"s my job.

1358
01:17:43,683 --> 01:17:45,116
Leave it. What are you doing?

1359
01:17:45,185 --> 01:17:46,243
lt's my grandmother's.

1360
01:17:46,486 --> 01:17:48,454
So what? lt's my job.

1361
01:17:49,322 --> 01:17:50,448
Aunty.
- Please. lt's my job.

1362
01:17:58,064 --> 01:17:58,962
Have you passed gas yet?

1363
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:01,159
Why do you keep asking me that?

1364
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:03,663
Nargis, ask her to get a whistle ...

1365
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,500
... and put it behind there.

1366
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:10,406
Okay, l"ll be back.

1367
01:18:16,049 --> 01:18:17,141
Nothing in the X-ray.

1368
01:18:18,018 --> 01:18:19,110
So, where has the ring gone?

1369
01:18:19,185 --> 01:18:20,311
How do l know?

1370
01:18:20,387 --> 01:18:22,252
lt wasn't in the bedpan, or
the x-ray, or the cake ...

1371
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,085
... and not even in the box..

1372
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:28,617
Farhad, the ring's still in the box.

1373
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:30,660
All the best, son.

1374
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:34,598
You crazy man, what if l had
really swallowed the ring?

1375
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:36,032
You crazy woman.

1376
01:18:36,269 --> 01:18:38,100
You didn"t swallow the ring
and still put up this charade.

1377
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,230
Charade? There was
something stuck in my throat.

1378
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:42,206
What was it? Just a cherry seed.

1379
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:43,105
And you ...

1380
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,576
Farhad, don't ever try
to put that ring on me.

1381
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:47,408
Let me see.

1382
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:51,109
Here l come. Here l come. Here l come.

1383
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:53,612
Oh, God.

1384
01:18:53,686 --> 01:18:58,146
l say if we had given him
some eggs and potato ...

1385
01:18:58,425 --> 01:19:00,620
... he would've
passed air in 15 minutes.

1386
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,454
Farhad, it's beautiful.

1387
01:19:04,097 --> 01:19:05,223
Was it very expensive?

1388
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:08,791
Why are you peeping into
someone else's room? - Nargis.

1389
01:19:09,069 --> 01:19:10,434
You'll wear it always?
- Always.

1390
01:19:10,503 --> 01:19:13,028
Don't lose it.
- l'll try.

1391
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:18,668
Oh! lts so beautiful Farhad.

1392
01:19:18,745 --> 01:19:20,645
Fart came!!

1393
01:19:21,314 --> 01:19:23,043
What should l decide now, Beroze?

1394
01:19:23,249 --> 01:19:25,149
Farhad"s deciding
everything on his own.

1395
01:19:25,452 --> 01:19:27,818
He doesn't eat with us at home.

1396
01:19:28,088 --> 01:19:29,783
Doesn't talk to us.

1397
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:32,090
Doesn't watch television together.

1398
01:19:32,492 --> 01:19:34,357
And doesn"t even
visit the temple anymore.

1399
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,126
What do l say?

1400
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:38,560
Don't worry, l'm with you.

1401
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:41,097
Yes.

1402
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:43,829
You know, l feel better coming here.

1403
01:19:44,204 --> 01:19:45,603
Nice idea, it was.

1404
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,065
Come on, darling. Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,626
Beroze aunty.

1417
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:16,358
How are you?

1418
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:17,592
Shirin.

1419
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:18,762
Hello. Hi, aunty.

1420
01:20:18,838 --> 01:20:20,829
l know her, your 'late night'.

1421
01:20:22,308 --> 01:20:23,366
Come, sit.

1422
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,876
Hi mamma.

1423
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:30,509
Shirin, would you
like to have something.

1424
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,845
No, thanks.

1425
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:36,483
Shirin.

1426
01:20:36,823 --> 01:20:39,189
Who else stays with you at home?

1427
01:20:39,259 --> 01:20:41,659
Me, my aunty and my Papa.

1428
01:20:41,895 --> 01:20:43,829
But he"s been in a
coma for many years now.

1429
01:20:44,797 --> 01:20:47,664
You mean to say your papa will come
to live with you after your marriage?

1430
01:20:48,201 --> 01:20:52,137
Actually ... we haven't
decided anything yet ...

1431
01:20:52,205 --> 01:20:55,436
... whether we'll bring papa
along or Farhad will stay with us.

1432
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:58,444
Oh, God. She"s choking.

1433
01:20:58,511 --> 01:20:59,739
Mama.
- Farhad, should l?

1434
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:03,540
Aunty, we were going to
discuss this with you.

1435
01:21:04,918 --> 01:21:06,283
Oh, l'm honoured.

1436
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,687
The both of you got
engaged in the hospital ...

1437
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:10,154
... without informing any of us.

1438
01:21:11,357 --> 01:21:12,551
Cheers.

1439
01:21:12,725 --> 01:21:16,217
So, Farhad's going to be
a 'live-in' son-in-law.

1440
01:21:16,863 --> 01:21:18,558
What's wrong in that?

1441
01:21:18,798 --> 01:21:20,527
No, no, not at all.

1442
01:21:20,867 --> 01:21:22,425
Farhad, a 'live-in' son-in-law.

1443
01:21:22,735 --> 01:21:24,327
What do you say, Nargis?

1444
01:21:26,306 --> 01:21:27,568
Cheers.

1445
01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:33,940
Aunty, l actually
wanted to apologise. - Why?

1446
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:38,341
The other day
I criticized your prawn curry.

1447
01:21:38,418 --> 01:21:40,750
You think all this is
because of that prawn curry.

1448
01:21:41,721 --> 01:21:42,881
Then?

1449
01:21:43,957 --> 01:21:47,222
Remem ber that woman
you wanted to beat up?

1450
01:21:47,293 --> 01:21:49,227
That crazy old hag.
- Yes.

1451
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:50,455
Yes, what about her?

1452
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:54,793
Do you remem ber her address?

1453
01:21:54,867 --> 01:21:57,734
l can never forget
her flat num ber, aunty.

1454
01:21:57,804 --> 01:21:59,294
She m ust"ve called me
a thousand times ...

1455
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,203
... and written to me at a least
a hundred times by now.

1456
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,705
l know that address by-heart.

1457
01:22:03,443 --> 01:22:05,911
Flat no. 7, C-block, 2nd floor.

1458
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:10,541
Which block do we live in?
- C-block.

1459
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:15,315
And which floor?
- Let it be, mama.

1460
01:22:15,622 --> 01:22:17,214
Second. Second floor.

1461
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:22,358
Yes and do you remember when
you came over for lunch that day?

1462
01:22:22,595 --> 01:22:24,460
Which apartment did you come to?

1463
01:22:24,998 --> 01:22:26,431
Flat number ...

1464
01:22:28,668 --> 01:22:32,661
l am that old hag ...
the one you wanted to beat up ...

1465
01:22:33,473 --> 01:22:35,270
... shoot with a gun.

1466
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:38,807
My name is Nargis Pastakia.

1467
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:40,473
Farhad"s mom my.

1468
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:46,011
Excuse me.

1469
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:49,450
Mama. Mama. Mama.

1470
01:22:49,656 --> 01:22:51,624
Shirin. Shirin.

1471
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:53,485
Cheers!

1472
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:56,621
Shirin.
- Get lost, Farhad.

1473
01:22:56,996 --> 01:22:58,486
Shirin.
- Shut up, Farhad.

1474
01:22:58,564 --> 01:23:00,259
Listen to me ...
- l can't believe ...

1475
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:01,823
... that you didn't tell me..

1476
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:03,892
..all this while that your mother was
Nargis Pastakia.

1477
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,904
Since childhood,
her name's been Nargis Pastakia.

1478
01:23:05,972 --> 01:23:07,303
Very funny, Farhad.

1479
01:23:07,373 --> 01:23:08,863
And l was impressed for no reason ...

1480
01:23:08,941 --> 01:23:11,876
... that you found me
without knowing my name or number.

1481
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:16,812
You weren't there to see me ...

1482
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,280
... you'd come to fight with me.

1483
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:21,684
And on top of that, flattering yourself
saying, ""Destiny brought me here''.

1484
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,449
lf it wasn't Destiny
- What else was it? - What?

1485
01:23:23,523 --> 01:23:25,388
ln fact, you should thank my mommy.

1486
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:26,322
l see, really?

1487
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:28,326
lf my mother hadn't gotten
into this mess with you ...

1488
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:31,290
Then l would never have
come to your office ...

1489
01:23:31,364 --> 01:23:32,922
... and we would never have met again.

1490
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:34,965
lf it isn't 'Destiny',
then what is it?

1491
01:23:35,034 --> 01:23:37,628
But you should"ve told me,
at least once ...

1492
01:23:37,704 --> 01:23:39,729
... that that fatso was your mom my.
- l didn't.

1493
01:23:39,839 --> 01:23:42,307
Now you wait Mr. Farhad Pastakia..

1494
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:43,433
You want to break the tank again.
- You"re tank is gone.

1495
01:23:43,509 --> 01:23:44,498
You want to break the tank again.

1496
01:23:44,577 --> 01:23:46,340
l will break it.
- Go ahead, break it.

1497
01:23:48,414 --> 01:23:49,642
But please, make
sure of just one thing.

1498
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,315
Don't ever break my heart.

1499
01:23:58,591 --> 01:24:01,082
Melodramatic bugger, come here!

1500
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,372
Farhad. l wish to talk to you.

1501
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,439
Mama, please don't
start all over again.

1502
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,615
You never have time to
talk to your mother.

1503
01:24:24,984 --> 01:24:27,544
But so eager you are
always to talk to her.

1504
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:29,779
Answer it. Answer it.

1505
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:31,652
She m ust be dying to talk to you.

1506
01:24:33,793 --> 01:24:35,784
Come on, come on, come on, Farhad.

1507
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:37,362
Pick up the phone.

1508
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,531
Why don't you answer it?

1509
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:43,133
lt's obvious, she's more
im portant to you than us.

1510
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:46,503
Shirin.
- Aunty, l can't get through.

1511
01:24:46,572 --> 01:24:47,504
He isn't answering his phone.

1512
01:24:47,573 --> 01:24:49,598
Why are you wasting
time with the phone?

1513
01:24:55,114 --> 01:24:56,138
Hello, Farhad.

1514
01:24:56,582 --> 01:24:57,412
Farhad, why weren't you taking ...

1515
01:24:57,483 --> 01:24:58,711
Why are you calling
me again and again?

1516
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:00,613
l"ll call you back!

1517
01:25:02,989 --> 01:25:04,650
Come on. Where were you people?

1518
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:06,157
l"ve been calling on
you'll for so long.

1519
01:25:06,793 --> 01:25:08,727
What are you staring at? Hurry up.

1520
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:10,384
Move aside.
- Shirin, come on.

1521
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:11,755
Straight.

1522
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,465
Shirin.

1523
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:17,562
Come on.

1524
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:21,439
He got up on my bed.

1525
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:22,405
Be careful.

1526
01:25:22,475 --> 01:25:23,635
What are you doing?

1527
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,401
Mind his head.

1528
01:25:28,114 --> 01:25:29,809
He's my father, not yours.

1529
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:31,508
You'll have arrived so late.

1530
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,051
Ma"am, please. We"re doing it.

1531
01:25:33,986 --> 01:25:35,180
Hurry up.

1532
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:36,782
Shirin.

1533
01:25:38,191 --> 01:25:39,419
Papa.

1534
01:25:39,492 --> 01:25:41,722
Put the mask properly.
- Shirin.

1535
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:43,528
Shirin, take your bag.

1536
01:25:44,464 --> 01:25:46,125
Will you go alone,
isn't Farhad com ing along?

1537
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,926
Just forget Farhad.

1538
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:53,662
Shirin, take care.

1539
01:26:01,113 --> 01:26:03,877
Sorry Shirin. l really miss you.

1540
01:26:04,517 --> 01:26:05,779
l am sorry.

1541
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:08,147
Farhad.
- Aunty.

1542
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,047
l want to talk to Shirin.

1543
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:11,612
l"ve been calling her since
yesterday. She isn't answering.

1544
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:14,626
She tried calling you so
many times last night.

1545
01:26:14,694 --> 01:26:15,820
l"ve been very rude to her.

1546
01:26:15,895 --> 01:26:17,021
l want to apologise.

1547
01:26:17,096 --> 01:26:18,791
You're too late.
- What happened?

1548
01:26:18,865 --> 01:26:20,662
Her father had to be
taken to the hospital.

1549
01:26:20,733 --> 01:26:22,564
His condition became really serious.

1550
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:25,230
And we needed your help desperately.

1551
01:26:25,605 --> 01:26:27,004
But you didn't answer your phone?

1552
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:29,236
Which hospital?
- Parsi Trust.

1553
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:30,803
Don't worry, he's doing well.

1554
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:32,036
Sure, doctor.
- Yes, l"ll come tomorrow.

1555
01:26:32,111 --> 01:26:33,476
Thank you.

1556
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:46,484
l am so sorry, Shirin.

1557
01:26:46,559 --> 01:26:47,856
l am so sorry.

1558
01:26:48,628 --> 01:26:49,925
How is papa now?

1559
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,156
Farhad, l don't want
to hear anything now.

1560
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:53,562
Shirin, please ...
- No, really Farhad.

1561
01:26:53,633 --> 01:26:55,066
l really don't want to hear anything.

1562
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:57,191
Last night when you called ...

1563
01:26:58,538 --> 01:27:01,701
... mam ma and l were arguing.
- That's the point, Farhad.

1564
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:03,698
You're so scared of your mother ...

1565
01:27:03,776 --> 01:27:05,573
... how will you ever marry me?

1566
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:09,948
You know your mother hates me.

1567
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,281
She'll never like me. lt's impossible.

1568
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:16,619
Please go and take care of your mamma.

1569
01:27:17,089 --> 01:27:19,114
And leave me with my papa.

1570
01:27:26,966 --> 01:27:28,524
... And l reached out to you.

1571
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:29,932
And what did you do?

1572
01:27:30,836 --> 01:27:32,167
You insulted me.

1573
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:34,634
You didn"t stop to think even once ...

1574
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:36,971
... why is it that l was
calling you repeatedly.

1575
01:27:37,643 --> 01:27:39,975
l needed you when
papa was dying, Farhad.

1576
01:27:40,947 --> 01:27:42,642
You just disconnected me.

1577
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,710
You know what?

1578
01:27:45,785 --> 01:27:47,776
Now l disconnect you.

1579
01:27:51,657 --> 01:27:53,625
And about all those 'destiny'
and 'made for each other"..

1580
01:27:53,693 --> 01:27:55,854
..speeches that you'd made ...

1581
01:27:57,897 --> 01:28:00,627
My favourite colour is red, not black.

1582
01:28:02,134 --> 01:28:04,967
My favourite dish is 'Dhansak',
not 'Salli Boti'.

1583
01:28:06,005 --> 01:28:08,769
And l like tea much more than Mangola.

1584
01:28:10,309 --> 01:28:11,776
So you see, Mr. Pastakia.

1585
01:28:11,844 --> 01:28:14,210
Our likes and
dislikes don't match at all.

1586
01:28:16,716 --> 01:28:18,183
lt's over.

1587
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,052

What?

1696
01:35:52,404 --> 01:35:54,565
What is he saying? Has he gone mad?

1697

What kind of joke is this?

1698
01:36:01,513 --> 01:36:02,480
What is this?

1699
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:04,778

Beroze aunty, you stay out of it.

1709

Do you know what kind
of a girl Shirin is?

Do you have any idea?

1712

Do you know? Then just keep quiet.

1715
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,281
Okay, be quiet.

1716
01:36:43,355 --> 01:36:45,516
When you didn't know

l would like to say.

01:42:47,719 --> 01:42:52,486
Your daughter Shirin's

But what's the difference?

What difference does it make?

1829
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:27,618
The point is ...
that we love each other.

1830
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,621
Just think about it.

1831

Can't remember anything ...
everything's locked away inside my head.

1837
01:43:57,022 --> 01:43:58,614
... even then,

1838
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,619
l will always remem ber one thing ...

1839
01:44:06,131 --> 01:44:07,758
