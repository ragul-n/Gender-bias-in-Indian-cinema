1
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,135
The world that you see
will not remain the same.

2
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,145
Close your eyes for a moment...

3
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,350
...and it will soon be 2017.

4
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,624
The year when petrol
prices rocketed sky high.

5
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,058
People who used cars
reduced drastically.

6
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,923
It was a time when people
used their cars once a while.

7
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,696
When a group of drunkards walk around
with their hands around the other...

8
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,213
..when one of them stumbles,
all the others fall too.

9
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,762
Similarly, the nations dependant
on Petrol started to tumble.

10
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:12,193
Fist fights, Burglary, Kidnapping
and drug mafia were on the rise.

11
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,239
International ties were cut.

12
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:15,759
Think about this scenario.

13
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,257
Do you think anyone would
be fair in such a world?

14
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,280
Won't we go extremes,
just for money?

15
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,968
And so, such is the year...

16
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,416
2020.

17
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,133
Could be recession or whatever.

18
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,382
The time God failed
to save the world.

19
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,176
Back then, there were
only 2 types of stooges.

20
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,278
One, who took the hard
way to earn money.

21
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,344
And the other, who
earned money illegally.

22
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,536
Deivanayagam falls in the
second category.

23
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Don of drug smuggling.

24
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,862
He is the most important
among the most dreaded.

25
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,172
Don't you underestimate me!

26
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,319
The whole world knows that Deiva
is an international business man.

27
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,271
He made millions by smuggling
cocaine for 27 years.

28
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,681
And by his side is...

29
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,458
Kaali.

30
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,909
Deiva's driver.

31
00:04:59,072 --> 00:04:59,978
Trustworthy.

32
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,532
He worships and admires
Deiva Nayagam.

33
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,979
You ruled this business,
like a boss, for 27 years.

34
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:11,268
- I wonder who is going to be your successor?
- What?

35
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,269
Succeed me?

36
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,239
Then, Devia's right hand...

37
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,187
PAI. Pai is like
an angel to Deiva.

38
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,684
He is everything to Deiva.

39
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,389
Starting with money laundering..

40
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,692
Need to purchase groceries.

41
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,680
Even Deiva Nayagam couldn't
escape the curse of 2020.

42
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,468
His market started to shrink..

43
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,371
The police surveillance increased..

44
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,460
His recent smuggling
operation too was...

45
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,031
Police got them?

46
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,940
He could neither buy
nor sell drugs..

47
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:40,551
And so all the doors in his business
started closing one after the other.

48
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,242
Finally, he found himself
standing at the last door.

49
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,739
The last set of
Cocaine he possessed.

50
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,492
- 4 kilos
- If this is lost..

51
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll have to bid goodbye.

52
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,792
We shall deliver it
at any cost.

53
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,980
- How?
- And Pai says...

54
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:02,841
I know a guy..

55
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
His name is 'Marundhu'.

56
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,336
His thoughts are innovative..

57
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,120
- He will somehow deliver it.
- His name is 'Marundhu'.

58
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,058
I'm famous by the name 'Scientist'.

59
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,000
A name he acquired
with his academics.

60
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,795
A genius who has set up a laboratory inside
a pharmacy especially for the criminals.

61
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:22,503
Switching TV channels in
Africa, with a remote here...

62
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,889
that's his latest invention.

63
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,138
The only person he trusts
in this world is Pai.

64
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,933
I trust you on this. I'll hand
over the stuff to Marundhu.

65
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,125
Make sure he doesn't mess it up.

66
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,168
Yes, pull it further!

67
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:44,094
I have a bigger
deal in 2 months.

68
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,332
With the Chinese.

69
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,351
I'm left with just 4 kilos of cocaine.

70
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,174
You have to deliver it to the Chinese.

71
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,210
If the police lay their
hands on this...

72
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,052
I have to wind up
this business...

73
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,319
and look for an alternative.

74
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,656
How can I help it?

75
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,134
Do whatever you can.

76
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,216
The deal with the Chinese, is
a very important one for me.

77
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,262
I must have strong
hold in this field.

78
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:07,818
and I bet on you.

79
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:14,841
So, your innovative thought is to
smuggle the stuff in the car?

80
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,850
Nominate this guy
for Oscar award.

81
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,265
No

82
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,749
The idea is not to
smuggle using the car.

83
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,651
The car is the stuff.

84
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,802
Yes, the car is the stuff.

85
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:30,559
To increase the
demand for cocaine..

86
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,683
he mixed it with strawberry flavor
and painted the whole car with it.

87
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,378
In order to separate the
cocaine from the car's paint..

88
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,288
he invented a special
solution as well.

89
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:45,945
It's awesome.

90
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,113
He prepared it in a way that even
sniffer dogs couldn't trace it.

91
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,855
With this flashy candy colour...

92
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,105
Won't it attract
attention on the road?

93
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,696
It will draw unwanted attention

94
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,147
Very good question.

95
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,401
This Friday, the
Hyderabad highway...

96
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,442
...is hosting a Vintage car rally.

97
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,540
All you have to do is...

98
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:10,169
Ask the Chinese to collect
the car at the rally.

99
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,062
This won't look unique
amongst other cars.

100
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:16,009
You are a vintage scientist.

101
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,761
Tell Kaali to collect the car
from Marundhu on Wednesday.

102
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:21,840
No

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,995
- Kaali won't be doing it this time.
- Why? - Why?

104
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,070
Kaali is one amongst us.

105
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,765
He has completed many
tasks in a precise manner.

106
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,866
And on the top of it.
It's about a car.

107
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,701
Who is a better
driver than Kaali?

108
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:37,562
Not just Kaali.

109
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:41,044
All men who work under
us have a crime record.

110
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,454
The minute they find
out it's my men

111
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,413
they will even start
investigating the shit.

112
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:49,877
How shall we deal with it?

113
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:52,287
Guys with zero criminal record.

114
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,899
2 new guys.

115
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:57,061
One with the code name "Pechu"
and the other "Watch"

116
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,567
A guy who can handle any
situation is 'Pechu'.

117
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:06,248
One who can overcome any hurdle and
deliver the stuff on time is.. - 'Watch'.

118
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,526
I gave it a thought.
What you said is right.

119
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,587
New guys.

120
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,559
If they drive carefully, they can
even deceive the cops and...

121
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,524
deliever the stuff as well.

122
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:18,080
All that's fine but will
they drive down carefully?

123
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,265
Yes. One amongst them
can drive the car.

124
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,970
But how? This isn't a normal car.

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,507
It's a vintage car.

126
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:28,778
Manual system..

127
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,810
It's safe only if
driven by a pro.

128
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,163
If the car gets damaged..

129
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:36,299
- the stuff will go for a toss.
- So?

130
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,257
 Who is he?

131
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,793
Jaguar Jagan alias JUK. Well he is...

132
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:43,678
Forget it..

133
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:44,931
He is good at driving.

134
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:48,267
He has driven costlier car
than the ones in these photos.

135
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,229
Pai, immediately arrange 2 guys.

136
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,134
- 2 guys? I will take care.
- And..

137
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:56,615
- An acquaintance of Kaali will join.
- Why do you want to add more people?

138
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,179
With the guys I arrange..

139
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,906
Pai, do what I say.

140
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,795
Summon Mangalam.

141
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,702
I need to meet all three
guys by the end of the day.

142
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:05,864
A. Mangalam.

143
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:06,608
Proprietor.

144
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,041
R.Mangalam, Manager

145
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:09,328
Center of homicide.

146
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,717
An employment
exchange for goons.

147
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,744
If you murder 11 guys

148
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:18,084
We can send you to
America for a project.

149
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,651
Tell me Pai.

150
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:24,159
A witty guy?

151
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,281
and A skillful guy?

152
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:30,246
Jung is the watch.

153
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:31,629
Jangulingam.

154
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,818
He finishes all his task
in one hour advance.

155
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:36,974
Awesome!

156
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,716
In the remaining hour..

157
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:41,195
Plays with fire marbles.

158
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,072
I will tell you how
such stories kick-off.

159
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,744
To begin with..
The narrator of the story.

160
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:51,416
My name is Jil.

161
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,514
Naan'JIL' Shivaji.

162
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,687
I'm Pechu.

163
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,510
You don't need my past.

164
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,014
My future, even I
can't rely on it.

165
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:06,560
But I'm obliged to
narrate this story.

166
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,157
Situation may change in
accordance with obligation.

167
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,579
But obligation mustn't change
even if situation changes.

168
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,560
Who am I?
What's my obligation?

169
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,867
What's my current situation?

170
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,454
To explain all these to you..

171
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,082
That's amazing!

172
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:25,600
Wow! How did you do that?

173
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,232
Baby, shut up!

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,290
Hold on.

175
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,109
Teach me the trick.

176
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:41,489
It's a trade secret.
How can I share?

177
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:56,704
Rs.10,000.

178
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,274
Awesome, babe.

179
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,303
At the right time..

180
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,106
At the right place..

181
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:30,607
It's worth..

182
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,710
Millions.

183
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:43,443
Baby!

184
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,196
Get lost!

185
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,875
When?

186
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:55,635
Place?

187
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,353
Every round has a
minimum bet amount.

188
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,599
We are allowed only if we
meet the minimum criteria.

189
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,399
When I'm alone, I'll
go for the minimum.

190
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:07,660
Now I'm with you.

191
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,593
We can go for the maximum bet.

192
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,763
Maximum bet isn't as
easy as you presume.

193
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,229
It's a lion's den.

194
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,036
Too risky.

195
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,590
- So...
- What's the risk?

196
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,281
You'll play the trick
and I'll win the money.

197
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:23,498
Simple.

198
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:29,466
Shuffle the card properly.

199
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,633
All my dad's curse
is on your side.

200
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:35,749
It's not simple.

201
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,645
None should know that
we are partners.

202
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,777
If you win everytime I
shuffle, they will suspect us.

203
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,549
So, at times I'll throw
you useless cards.

204
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,882
Don't bet anything
and just forfeit.

205
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,081
You should raise the stakes only
when I tell you to. Got it?

206
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:57,798
and how are you going to do that?

207
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,868
Baby?
Get lost!

208
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,729
This is the signal.

209
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:27,604
Get done with it, step out
and share the money equally.

210
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,211
And most importantly..

211
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,901
Don't get emotional.

212
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:33,172
Stay calm, no matter
how much you win.

213
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,197
Okay?

214
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,476
You don't know me.
I'm a sophisticated posh gentleman.

215
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,369
You loser!

216
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:44,826
Are you done?

217
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:46,157
Everything went for a toss?

218
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,196
Mr. Mustache?

219
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,835
Why do you need to play
poker at this age?

220
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:53,763
Stop it.

221
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,415
It's annoying.

222
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,810
To hell with that song!

223
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:02,819
Yeah, buddy!

224
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,459
One last game.

225
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,084
- Play and then leave.
- Silly boy.

226
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,425
A bigger bet.

227
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:11,715
If you win..

228
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,329
Everything is yours.

229
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,897
No thanks. I'll think I'll pass.

230
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,539
Well there it is.

231
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:21,257
Guess I doubted right, that...
if you were a man enough?

232
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,337
Let me prove it then!

233
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,927
Bring it on!

234
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,946
This time, I will
shuffle the cards.

235
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,546
My Mercedes Benz.

236
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,114
S class.

237
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,501
Damn it! The song keeps
ringing in the mind!

238
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,770
Did you bet such a huge
amount on this card?

239
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,143
I risked my money trusting you.

240
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:28,821
- Why did you continue?
- I thought you whistled.

241
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:30,298
Lift your head and
see you doofus!

242
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,526
- I didn't. It was him.
- Why are you abusing me?

243
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,671
- I came because you asked me to.
- Yeah right!

244
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:37,755
- I curse myself for doing so!
- What about my loss?

245
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,316
- So was this all a set up to run away with the money?
- No sir.

246
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:52,917
- Don't ask me. Ask him.
- No uncle, he brought me here.

247
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:53,973
It's him..

248
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,748
Sir, I'm a small time gambler.

249
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,838
I have nothing.

250
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:03,184
Please spare me.

251
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,323
If I see you again
in this campus..

252
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,738
- Get lost!
- Thank you, uncle.. Bye..

253
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,758
Where are you running away?

254
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,999
Sir, please spare me..

255
00:18:13,098 --> 00:18:15,149
I'm a decent guy..
Please..

256
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,226
Baby!!

257
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,148
Get out!

258
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:35,384
Shall I take leave?

259
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:36,976
Bye.

260
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:40,530
How dare you betray me?
Start counting your days.

261
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:49,614
Dad!

262
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,418
Of late the blows are
getting heavier?

263
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,545
Didn't you see that coming?

264
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,140
How dare you doubt me?

265
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,833
Why did you mark the cards?

266
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,563
Don't get smart with me!

267
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,321
I'm your dad.

268
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,231
- Understand that!
- Daddy.

269
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,728
- Did I hurt you bad?
- No, dad.

270
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:12,252
"To complete a daunting task don't
hesitate to take care of the petty tasks"

271
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,347
You taught me that.

272
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,678
Don't you have to go somewhere?

273
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,233
To meet Deiva.

274
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:18,663
Bigger task?

275
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,490
See you, dad.

276
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:26,521
Jil.

277
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,799
Don't forget grandpa's words.

278
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:56,816
Start right away. Deiva
wants to meet you.

279
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,133
Deiva?!

280
00:19:58,732 --> 00:19:59,793
You mean Deiva sir?

281
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,029
Yes, the car is waiting.
Just start.

282
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,372
Give me 2 minutes.
I will get dressed.

283
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,306
No need. We don't have time.
Start immediately.

284
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:08,408
90 seconds?

285
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:10,369
Give me 90 seconds.
I'll get dressed.

286
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:15,285
It's my dad's shirt and so
mom got a bit emotional.

287
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,658
Deiva sir doesn't
compromise on punctuality.

288
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,164
If you continue this..

289
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:20,718
You won't last long.
Got it?

290
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,421
- Okay. Thanks..
- Come on.

291
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,328
- Pai, move aside.
- Like there is a lot of space in here.

292
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:29,504
Come, place him on my lap.
Get lost you moron.

293
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,675
Wait...

294
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,815
I'll take care of you later.

295
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:34,687
Go to the other side.

296
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:44,592
Is it so essential now?

297
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,549
Okay, I'll get it.
Don't shout.

298
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,912
Please understand.

299
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:51,901
All that matters to me is that the
devotional event should go well.

300
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:54,868
Greetings, sir. Mangalam sir
sent me to visit Deiva sir.

301
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,588
Wait aside.

302
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,765
Greetings, sir.
- What is the task?

303
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,575
Murder, kidnap..

304
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:01,518
Or land grabbing?

305
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,708
- I'm a pro.
- Shut up and wait there.

306
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,590
Wonder why he's so desperate!?

307
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,466
Don't stand there idle. Go fetch
the groceries from the car.

308
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,682
- Why do make us do these petty jobs?
- Aren't you working out?

309
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:17,880
Wait over there.

310
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,578
Call those dumbos to dispose
the consignment in the trunk.

311
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,261
Deiva,

312
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,531
I was waiting to say this.

313
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,154
Here, look at this flower vase.

314
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,476
I pretty much love the art work in it.

315
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,578
You are an art enthusiast.

316
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,205
This vase..

317
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,086
A girl gifted it
to me in Bangkok.

318
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:57,164
Forget it.

319
00:21:58,492 --> 00:21:59,552
Do you know something?

320
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,452
Out of all my favorite things..

321
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,826
I rank this flower vase...

322
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,026
at 8.

323
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,176
Really?

324
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:10,385
He is a good man.

325
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,762
Look how sweet he is.

326
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,577
We must be gifted to
work under him...

327
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:36,909
The thing I hate the most.

328
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,686
How dare you try to
sell my stuff ...

329
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,076
And that too to me!

330
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:45,768
Gaja!

331
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:50,630
I'll get the Rs.80,000
he cheated,from his house.

332
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,702
Go bring those boys.

333
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,617
Feel at home.

334
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:14,704
What's your name?
- Dead body.

335
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,183
What?

336
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,388
Jaguar Jagan.

337
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,701
So you are Juk?

338
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:24,112
Yes.

339
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,170
Are you good at driving?

340
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:26,891
Yes.

341
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,155
I'm sure you might not
know why you all are here.

342
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:33,205
But the task you are going
to do is very important.

343
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,218
Millions worth...

344
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:37,842
Flavored Cocaine has to be..

345
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,956
delivered to the Chinese
dealer in Hyderabad highway.

346
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:43,411
If you are scared

347
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,658
you can leave now.

348
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:47,096
I'll offer some compliments
for the visit.

349
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:49,738
Else if you are ready to do it.

350
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,288
I will share an address.

351
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:53,079
You'll have to go meet him...

352
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,238
and get the stuff.

353
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,612
He will furnish you
with further details.

354
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,542
Got it?

355
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:03,907
Vairam...

356
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:05,539
get those compliments.

357
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:06,584
No, wait.

358
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:08,960
We will do it.

359
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:10,875
Please tell the address.

360
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:15,504
You fools.

361
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,649
- What did I ask you to do?
- Boss!

362
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,664
- You just gestured.
- Yes.

363
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,571
What does this mean?

364
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:27,489
When Deiva gestures
you understand it...

365
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:29,749
Why don't you understand
when I gesture?

366
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:32,752
Come here.

367
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,678
What does it mean?

368
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,049
You want him to be dead.

369
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:40,084
See? He joined just today.

370
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:42,611
He got it. At least
now did you get it?

371
00:24:58,427 --> 00:24:59,427
Don't touch it.

372
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:00,887
Why?

373
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,159
Because, just now I have
painted it with the stuff.

374
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:05,728
Why?

375
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,976
That's where I did a demo
with the solution, for Deiva.

376
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,157
Why?

377
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,572
Why...Why..Why?

378
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:14,667
He is torturing me like a wife!

379
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,122
Look!

380
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:20,714
Your food, car fuel, filling
solution is in the car's trunk.

381
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,625
You need not drive in the night.

382
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:25,595
Without crashing it, without
any dent, if you safely..

383
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:27,602
Get away.

384
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,796
Deliver it to the Chinese guy.
Okay?

385
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:33,043
So..

386
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,191
Car is the stuff.

387
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:36,971
That's amazing science!

388
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,821
Car is the stuff.

389
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:41,860
That's amazing science!

390
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:43,765
Car is the stuff.

391
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,074
That's amazing science!

392
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:11,584
Doesn't it have a radio set?

393
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,225
What a blow?

394
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,073
He seemed to be nice guy.

395
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,287
He drastically transformed
into a monster.

396
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,136
I was literally scared to death.

397
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:30,111
One should be scared

398
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:31,761
One should be shit scared!

399
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,907
I'm disappointed.

400
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:37,162
I expected something big. But
he assigned a petty task.

401
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:38,545
Hello.

402
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:42,955
" To complete a daunting task don't
hesitate to take care of petty tasks "

403
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:46,364
Daunting task is delivering
Deiva's stuff worth millions.

404
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:48,229
What about the petty tasks?

405
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:50,409
Secret of success.

406
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,982
If I share it with you.
Won't you overtake me?

407
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:54,707
Okay.

408
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,216
- Hello.
- Yes, dad.

409
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,466
- Did you join yet?
- Yes.

410
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:06,703
- Where?
- With Deiva.

411
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:08,921
- Is it challenging?
- Yes, dad.

412
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,075
I am handling stuff worth millions.

413
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,256
- I'm on my way to deliver it.
- Everything safe?

414
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,584
Yes, everything is safe.

415
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:17,156
- Had your food?
- Yes, I did.

416
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:19,102
- Do you have it? The asset grandpa gave you?.
- What?

417
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:20,618
- Are you carrying it with you?
- Yes.

418
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,169
Use it when the need arises.

419
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:24,300
- I'll call after I reach.
- Safety first.

420
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,347
Despite growing up you still seemed
to be sacred of your father?

421
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,289
So all this is just a show off?

422
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:36,003
You don't know about
my dad, do you?

423
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,322
Those days, he used to
smuggle stuff using fruits.

424
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,249
He has a different tone to
sell only the fruits and...

425
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:46,579
and a unique tone to sell the
fruits containing the stuff.

426
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:48,603
Is that all?

427
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,883
Ever heard about my dad?

428
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,738
He used to sell ice creams

429
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:55,306
and while people are enjoying the
ice cream, he loots their houses.

430
00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:56,513
Hey, Mr.

431
00:27:56,878 --> 00:28:01,395
My dad smuggled alcohol
in stems like a pro!

432
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:05,186
And my dad kidnapped school kids...

433
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,324
for heavy ransoms.

434
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,848
Stop boasting about your
ice cream vendor dad!

435
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:14,933
- Don't you say that.Your dad is so cheap..
- Do you know what my dad is capable of?

436
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:16,240
- Stop exaggerating.
- Wait..

437
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,987
Hello brother...

438
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:21,066
I've been noticing for long...

439
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:22,295
You are very silent.

440
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:23,721
Say something.

441
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:25,647
Tell me about your dad.

442
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:26,621
Tell me...

443
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,888
Was your dad a Don?

444
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,411
Why are you silent?

445
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:32,902
What's your dad's name?

446
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:33,579
Answer dude.

447
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:34,844
Who is your dad?

448
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:38,475
Looks like he is an
international terrorist. Is he?

449
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:44,005
He is more dangerous than him.

450
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:47,006
My dad was...

451
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:47,934
... a bus driver.

452
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:55,787
A bus that carried 50 dumbos everyday,
from a waste land to another...

453
00:28:55,812 --> 00:28:57,812
shuttling 20 times across
both the waste land.

454
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,430
He did that for 17 years with no complaints.

455
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,270
A glimpse of his face is enough.

456
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:06,704
One can easily make out that he is
leading a boring and irritating life.

457
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:08,839
Every man will have a moment
that'll test his limit.

458
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:12,648
A moment where the person will regret
this boring life and break down.

459
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,206
But my dad was a bit different.

460
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:19,044
In this irritating and
never ending bus ride..

461
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,847
He wanted a thrilling
experience.

462
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,732
Did all the abusing from the
transport officer change my dad?

463
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:57,727
No.

464
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,367
He wasn't satisfied with it.

465
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,006
My dad joined as a
driver under Deiva.

466
00:30:02,664 --> 00:30:04,956
One day while he was
driving Deiva's car...

467
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,359
He noticed an abandoned
Vintage car.

468
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:09,782
But that wasn't a normal car.

469
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,631
A contemporary glamor actress
was kidnapped by Rolex Rawther.

470
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:16,072
The heroine was hid
in the car's trunk.

471
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:20,496
The heroine's manager dropped the
suitcase with money into the car.

472
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,867
Once Rawther's men
take the money

473
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,711
heroine's manager was supposed to
take home the car with the heroine.

474
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:26,601
This was the deal.

475
00:30:26,774 --> 00:30:27,876
But my dad..

476
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:31,903
Without knowing all these, my dad
stole the car which he loved dearly.

477
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:35,019
Money, car and heroine.

478
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,623
That fellow happily
absconded with all three.

479
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:38,821
A furious Rawther...

480
00:30:39,307 --> 00:30:43,823
On seeing Deiva's car, assumed
that Deiva had played spoilsport.

481
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,309
Then started the enmity
between Deiva and Rawther.

482
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:48,817
Oh my!

483
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:51,304
What a crook your dad is?

484
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:59,208
The famous affair with the then
leading heroine! Was it your dad?

485
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:00,981
My goodness.

486
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,155
Who is Rawther?

487
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,016
Correction.
Rolex Rawther.

488
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:11,435
Both used to be partners in crime.
Smuggling ivory.

489
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:14,645
They parted ways after
their Godfather's demise.

490
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,002
By gifting a Rolex
watch to Rawther.

491
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,891
Deiva is behind the name
of 'Rolex' Rawther.

492
00:31:21,117 --> 00:31:24,056
The deal was not to
breach other's business.

493
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:28,212
But Juk's dad's set a flame
in both their business.

494
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:31,226
King of kidnapping.
Don of petrol mafia.

495
00:31:31,837 --> 00:31:34,143
Most importantly..
Arch rival of Deiva.

496
00:31:58,069 --> 00:32:00,740
I know kidnapping.
What's petrol mafia?

497
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:05,063
There are 3 most valued
things in our country.

498
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:09,015
Land, gold and thirdly gas.

499
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:11,936
Rawther has a superb plan for it.

500
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,512
He illegally stocks gas.

501
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,280
Whenever there is a price hike..

502
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:18,433
he sells gas in the black market.

503
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,954
Sounds like an old detective
movie's story line.

504
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,191
- Old detective movie?!
- Yeah!

505
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm fond of two types of movies.

506
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:27,646
Detective action and the seductive action.

507
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:28,465
You continue.

508
00:32:29,688 --> 00:32:33,034
Rawther illegally taps the petrol pumps

509
00:32:33,204 --> 00:32:37,852
and hides outside the city in a silo
so that none can know it.

510
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,055
Silo?
What's it?

511
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:42,853
Similar to a water tank.

512
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:47,316
You seemed to be faking worse than the
ones in the seductive action movies.

513
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:48,936
Don't you believe me?

514
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:52,110
You said it's hidden so that no one can know.

515
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,346
Then how do you know it?

516
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:57,399
I've waiting for long
to work under Deiva.

517
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:01,773
To work under him, more
than knowing about him..

518
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:04,391
I have to know about his enemy.

519
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:07,745
Another dry day!

520
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,025
Head constable!

521
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,809
A pink car?

522
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:17,344
Something fishy.

523
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:24,932
A vintage car painted baby pink
passes inspector Ishwara Pandian.

524
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,693
It seeks his attention.

525
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,021
His adrenaline rushes..

526
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:31,272
Immediately he jumps
into his car...

527
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,528
He rushes like a Leopard.

528
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,723
Start the car.

529
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,796
Do you watch English movies?

530
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,167
I watch Japanese, Korean, African, Naughty
American and everything else.

531
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,007
What American?

532
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:06,355
Naughty American?

533
00:34:07,024 --> 00:34:08,100
Not bad.

534
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,551
You must be a movie buff.

535
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:11,676
Movie buff?

536
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:14,032
Kind of!

537
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,435
I watched an English movie.

538
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,837
Just for adult content?

539
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:19,064
Stupid.

540
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:22,206
Do you think that's why
people watch English movies?

541
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:23,927
Initially...

542
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,671
I did watch it for
the adult content.

543
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,935
But there was a good content in it.

544
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:29,947
About a butterfly.

545
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:32,846
Adult content about butterfly?

546
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:34,246
Dude!

547
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,700
I have seen dog, horse and even octopus.

548
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,476
but adult content
with butterfly?

549
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,705
This is not adult content.

550
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,005
So there's this movie
named "Butterfly Effect"

551
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:47,112
It says that...

552
00:34:47,756 --> 00:34:49,599
Juk, listen!

553
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,350
He has spoken
enough for the day.

554
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,204
Now his only attention
is on driving.

555
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:55,524
Then you listen.

556
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:57,559
A butterfly.

557
00:34:58,142 --> 00:35:00,180
If a butterfly flaps its
wings in one direction...

558
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,558
a chain of incidents follow.

559
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,478
and if it flaps the other way...

560
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:11,839
Juk!

561
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,460
Jil!
Police!

562
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,743
Is this how you drive?

563
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,869
Reckless

564
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:33,687
- Ishwara Pandian roars.
- Sir..

565
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:36,088
Nothing serious, sir.
A cat crossed our way.

566
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:38,734
When we tried to evade it, the
car skid and hit the tree.

567
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:41,794
Are you drunk?

568
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,844
- Blow.
- He is not drunk.

569
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,694
Blow, Juk.

570
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,631
What the hell?

571
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,211
He is sucking instead of blowing.

572
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:00,606
What kind of car is this?

573
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:02,643
- Why is it flashy and pink?
- Pink?

574
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:07,805
The furious inspector smells something
fishy and his facial muscles constrict..

575
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,915
Jil replies to calm him down.

576
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,546
"By the by, myself Jil"

577
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:15,046
Ishwara Pandian.

578
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:22,161
Suddenly the brave inspector Ishwara
Pandian feels that everything is clear.

579
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:25,883
- Are you going for the Hyderabad show?
- Yes, sir.

580
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,197
Okay, drive safe.

581
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,390
- Clear.. Move..
- Juk, change the gear.

582
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:31,213
Let's move..
Push..

583
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,334
Is this how you drive?

584
00:36:53,698 --> 00:36:55,101
Whose is it? Yours?

585
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:58,490
Do you the know the
value of this car?

586
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,210
Aren't you going to Hyderabad?
It's very obvious.

587
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:06,136
This is a long route.

588
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,871
Why is it colored pink?

589
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,392
Who are you?

590
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,050
I'm Narasimha from Chennai.

591
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,325
Glad to meet you.

592
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:16,841
So?

593
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:19,025
In case, you did not notice.

594
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,747
I too own a similar car.

595
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
See there.

596
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:27,297
Aren't you heading to the
Hyderabad vintage car rally?

597
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:28,332
Even I'm heading there.

598
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,255
Why don't we travel together?

599
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,552
Come on. Let's go.

600
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:36,136
What a coincidence.

601
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:37,836
Start the car.

602
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:41,759
- Move fast.
- We'll have a fun trip.

603
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,011
Start!
I'm ready.

604
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,875
Bro, do you know a fact?

605
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:58,155
Only 5 people own this model car.

606
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,526
- Increase the speed.
- We are so unique you know?

607
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:05,473
Let me tell you one more story.

608
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:09,315
Move fast!!

609
00:38:11,003 --> 00:38:12,911
Time to pee!

610
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,925
The sky is blue just
like your hair is!

611
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,326
Once again, what a coincidence!?

612
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:23,386
I'm not sure what
he would compare next?

613
00:38:24,105 --> 00:38:26,094
Moron! Where do they come from?

614
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:29,090
- Boss, please wait.
- We need to get rid of him.

615
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,153
Yes, dude. He has clutched
on to us like a parasite.

616
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:33,039
- We have to get rid of him.
- Boss.

617
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,649
- Juk
- Yes.

618
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:36,972
Hello, boss.

619
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:39,133
Do you booze?

620
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:52,437
Narasimhan, you'll have
to drink like a fish.

621
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:55,571
- Definitely.
- Boss...

622
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:57,423
Take your seat. A moment please.

623
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,774
- Okay..
- Narasimhan.

624
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,509
Narasimhan, Is your
father Vaanjinathan?

625
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,018
Hello!

626
00:39:04,118 --> 00:39:06,124
Suggest me a drink that will hit quickly.

627
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:08,024
Listen...

628
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:10,754
It must give an instant high.

629
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,127
It should make one walk like a 6 month old!

630
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,032
It's called the last day.

631
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,800
LAST DAY.

632
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,730
How much?

633
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:44,050
A toast for both
our flashy cars!

634
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,074
A red road. Two trucks on it.
One diverted.

635
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:37,827
Went out of control
And rammed into the White House’ Gate

636
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:42,232
A red road. Two trucks on it.
One diverted.

637
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:46,226
Went out of control
And rammed into the White House’ Gate

638
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:48,748
Seeing this broad-day light accident

639
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,581
Approached a stooge

640
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,024
Well known as the “Job-less Genie”,

641
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:55,187
He stood amused.

642
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,721
Amused, he forgot to notice
The fire approaching him

643
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,361
Suddenly, he felt something was burning.
His pants were on fire!

644
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:03,569
Losing his pants…
took off the jobless genie!

645
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,817
With his boxers on

646
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,377
He kept running

647
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,570
While crossing, a truck ran over
And he became history

648
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,025
With his boxers on

649
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,909
He kept running

650
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,732
While crossing, a truck ran over
And he became history

651
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,438
Every bottle of wine

652
00:42:47,544 --> 00:42:49,490
Holds a melody inside.

653
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,559
Open it up and...

654
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,012
Let them flow.

655
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:55,734
Every bottle Rum

656
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:57,767
Is full of rhymes

657
00:42:57,925 --> 00:43:00,061
Give it your best shot

658
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,549
But one mistake and
You’ll be wasted!

659
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,734
Let’s not disturb the music
Let it run in the background

660
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:09,568
Let’s change the topic
So what’s next?

661
00:43:10,513 --> 00:43:12,612
To know more about 'What next?'

662
00:43:12,678 --> 00:43:14,311
I came up with an answer

663
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,897
Give me the mic and
I shall recite the Ballad I came up with.

664
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,977
A ravishing white duck

665
00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:30,575
Takes a dip in the river

666
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,157
The raven, lost in the sight

667
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:34,810
It's now cupid’s latest victim!

668
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:38,825
A ravishing white duck
Takes a dip in the river

669
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:43,180
The raven, lost in the sight
It's now cupid’s latest victim!

670
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:32,441
The ultimate star!

671
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,430
Two trucks on the red road
The one that diverted

672
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:54,231
Went out of control
And rammed into the White House’ Gate

673
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:59,051
Two trucks on the red road
The one that diverted

674
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:03,450
Went out of control
And rammed into the White House’ Gate

675
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,606
Super, excellent, marvelous.

676
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,870
Terrific, Jil.

677
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:31,652
Tell me, what's the next word?

678
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:33,430
Say the next word.

679
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,405
- Is the pink car yours?
- Pink?

680
00:45:41,765 --> 00:45:42,765
Okay, sir.

681
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:44,489
- Who is he?

682
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,890
If you can tell which is your
car, I can get you the keys.

683
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:51,699
This one. Give me the keys.

684
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:55,882
Karma will take its turn.

685
00:46:25,204 --> 00:46:26,204
Jil

686
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,133
Where is the car?

687
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,674
I'm asking you.
Where is the car?

688
00:46:44,297 --> 00:46:45,837
Are you kidding?

689
00:46:46,528 --> 00:46:47,633
There. What's that?

690
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:49,555
What's this?

691
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:52,158
This is a Grey car.
Our's is a pink one.

692
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:53,908
Pink?

693
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,668
What does he mean?

694
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:00,336
- Pink?
- Yeah!

695
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,093
Come closer.

696
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:12,878
What color is this?

697
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,955
This one?

698
00:47:17,741 --> 00:47:18,695
Come on.

699
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:25,802
" It's the color of a dark cloud."

700
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,115
Stop it with your poem, you color blind!

701
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,741
How did you get the license?

702
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:34,043
License?

703
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:37,783
- Is that why you are scared of the
police? - What a time to discuss!

704
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,801
This is Narasimhan's car.
Where is our car?

705
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:41,794
Deiva is going to finish us!

706
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:44,624
Okay.

707
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:46,534
If this is Narasimhan's car..

708
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,379
Our car is with Narasimhan.

709
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:51,337
He must still be at the
bar for what he drank!

710
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:55,364
How much time do we have
to deliver the stuff?

711
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:58,101
10 hours, 20 minutes
and 40 seconds.

712
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,072
How much time to
the bar and back?

713
00:48:01,097 --> 00:48:02,592
45 minutes.
We have the time.

714
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:03,617
Let's start.

715
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:04,817
Yes, let's go.

716
00:48:05,373 --> 00:48:07,778
Touch the car and
I'll finish you!

717
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:01,156
Who allowed them to take my car?

718
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,661
You allowed them.

719
00:49:05,138 --> 00:49:06,138
Excuse me.

720
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:08,619
Who is the owner of the vintage
car that's parked outside?

721
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,620
It's mine.

722
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:14,189
Tomorrow we need
your car for a shoot.

723
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:15,023
No.

724
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:17,488
Please understand.
We'll pay you enough.

725
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,124
I can give you a
cheque right away.

726
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:20,278
Please tell me your name.

727
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:21,743
Narasimhan.

728
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,593
- Where are they?
- They are at the shooting spot.

729
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:27,839
The car is with them. Go get it.

730
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:28,470
Let's see.

731
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:30,409
We might meet him on the way.

732
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,446
Stop!!

733
00:49:36,365 --> 00:49:37,365
Movie shooting.

734
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,021
I think it's a big budget movie.

735
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:41,060
Let's watch it for sometime and then leave.

736
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:42,683
Are you kidding?

737
00:49:42,943 --> 00:49:44,158
We are all worried about
the missing car...

738
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,681
and he wants to watch the shoot!

739
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,562
It's a movie, man.

740
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:49,899
Nothing will change in 10 minutes.
Believe me.

741
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,642
Have you ever seen a
heroine in person?

742
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:52,886
Juk, tell me?

743
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:54,610
No.

744
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:56,306
Listen!
We shall leave

745
00:49:57,531 --> 00:50:01,750
Jil remember " To complete a daunting task
don't hesitate to take care of petty tasks "

746
00:50:01,776 --> 00:50:02,369
Stop it!

747
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:04,706
Both are irrelevant.

748
00:50:05,276 --> 00:50:06,509
Don't mix it up.

749
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,035
It's my principle.

750
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:11,003
Okay. Just 10 minutes.
We shall leave.

751
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,567
Just 10 minutes.

752
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,049
If you don't come back..

753
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:16,509
I'll leave with the car.
Okay?

754
00:50:16,538 --> 00:50:17,969
- Okay.. no problem.
- Go!

755
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:29,371
- Who is playing the lead?
- Sonu Sawant.

756
00:50:29,372 --> 00:50:30,372
- Sonu Sawant?!
- Yes.

757
00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:31,541
Dude,

758
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:32,498
It's Sonu Sawant.

759
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:35,439
Today, I'll have to....

760
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:50,036
- What happened?
- We can't go in. Cops.

761
00:50:50,935 --> 00:50:51,935
Cops?!

762
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:54,987
- I'll wait in the car.
- Wait!!

763
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:56,445
Why are you getting
into the car?

764
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,478
I left something inside.

765
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,156
- What did you leave?
- Car.

766
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,655
Stop being a chicken. Now come.

767
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:05,888
Jung...

768
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:08,332
Do you have your agency's ID card?

769
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,483
Yes, sir.

770
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,274
Nothing to worry.

771
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:15,704
I will deliver the car.

772
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,122
One second, sir.
What's this?

773
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:19,755
I'm a member from the
stunt association.

774
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,012
Can't you make out from
the hairstyle? Come on.

775
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:23,793
Sorry, sir.
You continue.

776
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:37,148
Make a move..
Our scene comes next.

777
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:38,852
We are a team.
Let them in.

778
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:40,913
They are waiting for me.

779
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,619
Are you happy?

780
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,028
- Dude isn't that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
- What?

781
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:52,952
In this movie too?

782
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:54,709
The location is awesome.

783
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:00,821
Sonu Sawant.

784
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:10,739
Yes.

785
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:13,874
Man! Look at her!

786
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:25,650
I'm running out of words.

787
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,077
We are your die hard fans.

788
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,090
Oh is it? Thanks!

789
00:52:31,007 --> 00:52:32,712
She is so graceful!

790
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:36,060
Myself Jil.

791
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,493
You look even prettier off screen.

792
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:40,933
So as planned...

793
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:44,162
Okay, sir..

794
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:46,178
Come closer.
Look here.

795
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,352
Everyone ready?

796
00:52:51,223 --> 00:52:52,989
I am waiting for this scene.

797
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:54,800
I'll be back in sometime.

798
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:55,883
Ready.

799
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:58,023
She speaks good Tamil.

800
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,338
- Start camera.
- Action.

801
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:23,426
Take, okay.

802
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:01,795
Deiva will finish us off!

803
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:02,712
Jil!

804
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,212
Where are you headed to?

805
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:06,837
There is a movie shoot
happening here.

806
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:09,128
We'll have to first find
out if it was our car.

807
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:10,462
Listen Jil...

808
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:13,045
These were the guys, who were
inquiring about our car at the bar.

809
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:19,107
Thank God that take was fine. Where will
we go for another car if it was not okay!

810
00:54:19,837 --> 00:54:20,337
Excuse me.

811
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:21,420
What?

812
00:54:21,462 --> 00:54:23,795
- The pink car that exploded...
- Yes.

813
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:24,878
That car...

814
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:26,545
Yes we got it from
the bar yesterday.

815
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:30,587
With whose permission?

816
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:32,503
We took it with the
owner's permission.

817
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:34,045
And we did agree to pay. No?

818
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:39,087
Which owner are you
talking about?

819
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,587
It was a short, fat person...

820
00:54:41,753 --> 00:54:43,128
His name...What was it?

821
00:54:43,503 --> 00:54:45,045
- Narasimhan.
- Yeah.

822
00:54:50,003 --> 00:54:51,878
Death is inevitable ...

823
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:55,087
but never expected it would
be for a pink colored car!

824
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:55,670
Pink?

825
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,253
Was it this place?

826
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,087
Look Narasimhan...

827
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:02,878
There is my car!

828
00:55:03,628 --> 00:55:05,212
My car!

829
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:09,087
How dare you sell our car
for your urge to get drunk?

830
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:11,628
Don't you dare
treat me this way!

831
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:14,503
Let's take care of him first...

832
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,170
Thrash him!

833
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:16,545
How could you sell the car?

834
00:55:16,753 --> 00:55:17,378
- Get him.
- Leave me

835
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,628
Bloody gluttons! I'm
here looking for my car.

836
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:20,795
"Why are you hitting me?"

837
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:24,087
Accent?

838
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:25,837
To hell with your accent!
Tell me now.

839
00:55:25,962 --> 00:55:27,170
I doubted you the
moment I saw you.

840
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,587
Who do you work for? Rawther?

841
00:55:29,545 --> 00:55:30,045
Catch him.

842
00:55:33,003 --> 00:55:35,795
Look at him taking off on hearing
Rawther's name. Something is fishy.

843
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,170
Listen

844
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:38,378
There's...

845
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:38,962
There's....

846
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,212
There's nothing like that.

847
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,670
Those movie guys got me
drunk and took away my car!

848
00:55:44,462 --> 00:55:45,295
Believe me.

849
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,712
"Please believe me"

850
00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:49,503
You sold our car and they destroyed it.
Don't try to fool us.

851
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,420
They destroyed the car?
What happened?

852
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:53,212
Do you know how much
that car is worth?

853
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:56,670
Why is he upset about it?

854
00:56:03,837 --> 00:56:05,573
Everyone has a need.

855
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:09,295
Now, Deiva's car...

856
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,253
Who needs it?

857
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:25,295
Take it.

858
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:26,212
- Pai?
- Pai?

859
00:56:27,378 --> 00:56:30,462
Why is that fatso
calling up this fool?

860
00:56:31,682 --> 00:56:32,534
Hello

861
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:34,337
What happening to the car?

862
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:36,795
Those guys aren't picking
the call either.

863
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:38,337
Is everything safe?

864
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:40,670
Reply you fool!

865
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:43,295
Did you steal the
pink car or not?

866
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:44,878
Hello...

867
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:45,587
Hello...

868
00:56:45,753 --> 00:56:47,087
Say something!

869
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:48,087
Hello...

870
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:02,420
Show me you hand.

871
00:57:08,503 --> 00:57:10,128
For the questions that
I'm about to ask you,

872
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12,462
I expect quick replies.

873
00:57:13,337 --> 00:57:14,878
Any reply barring truth and...

874
00:57:17,253 --> 00:57:18,587
your thumb will be thumped!

875
00:57:19,337 --> 00:57:19,837
Got it?

876
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:22,878
Wasn't it Pai who sent you?

877
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:26,378
Why did he set you
to steal the car?

878
00:57:30,587 --> 00:57:31,545
I'll tell...I'll tell...

879
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:38,003
Drugs are my life.

880
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:40,670
I've known Marundhu for long.

881
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:43,003
Two days back he called me.

882
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:46,795
There was a guy named Pai along with him.

883
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:48,962
He told me to follow you guys

884
00:57:49,087 --> 00:57:52,170
and wanted to get you guys
drunk and steal your pink car.

885
00:57:52,337 --> 00:57:54,378
He wanted me to give the
car to a third party.

886
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:57,337
When the deal is done, Deiva
would be out of business

887
00:57:57,462 --> 00:58:01,962
And Pai would be the king and
offerred me as much drugs I wanted.

888
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:04,420
I came to the bar to
get you guys drunk.

889
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:08,087
But you guys got me drunk and took my car.

890
00:58:08,253 --> 00:58:11,462
Pai is the one behind all this.
Please spare me.

891
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:13,045
"Shall we take the car with us?"

892
00:58:15,878 --> 00:58:17,545
So, he planned to
fool us using you!

893
00:58:18,837 --> 00:58:20,212
Do we appear to be freaks?

894
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:21,045
Jil...

895
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,378
We are freaks indeed.

896
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:25,670
All these days I thought you were
a brat who obeys his father.

897
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,712
Look at you now! You are terrific.

898
00:58:28,415 --> 00:58:30,206
You change as the
situations orders you to.

899
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:33,337
Juk

900
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:36,878
Let his phone be with you.
Put him in the trunk.

901
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:40,420
Jil..

902
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:42,576
Let's surrender
ourselves to Deiva.

903
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,517
Are you nuts?

904
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,503
What else do you expect?

905
00:58:45,503 --> 00:58:49,670
The best way out for us is to tell Deiva
the truth and that he is being cheated.

906
00:58:50,128 --> 00:58:53,045
He would ask "Were you guys mute
spectators when they destroyed the car?"

907
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:55,795
He'll bury us alive.
Is that fine?

908
00:58:56,682 --> 00:58:59,391
He ripped that jeweller
for a mere 80,000 bucks.

909
00:58:59,854 --> 00:59:00,896
He will rip our nuts out!

910
00:59:02,217 --> 00:59:04,050
Fine, let's escape.

911
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:06,419
And do that forever?

912
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,837
Of course! Think about it.

913
00:59:08,763 --> 00:59:09,555
Deiva is a shark.

914
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:10,900
We are small fishes.

915
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:14,422
It's better for the small fishes to
be in the aquarium than the sea.

916
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:19,378
Do you know the problem
with fishes in the aquarium?

917
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,224
You can be easily spotted.

918
00:59:30,562 --> 00:59:32,395
Why aren't these guys
attending the call?

919
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,406
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

920
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:37,085
I told you, back
then, repeatedly...

921
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,437
"Do not trust the newbies!"

922
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,492
But you...

923
00:59:41,975 --> 00:59:43,100
Don't talk about the past.

924
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:44,642
Look into what's next.

925
00:59:44,683 --> 00:59:46,183
I tried a lot...

926
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,863
..but none of them
are picking up my call.

927
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:50,433
I'll investigate.

928
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
So what's the plan now?

929
00:59:56,475 --> 00:59:57,558
Where are we headed to?

930
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,350
Only 8 hours to go.

931
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:02,433
So now, this is what
we are going to do...

932
01:00:03,052 --> 01:00:03,719
Greetings!

933
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:07,329
These are the ingredients required
to make a chinese car delivery.

934
01:00:07,642 --> 01:00:09,100
Grey car - 1 No.

935
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:11,308
Pink paint - as required.

936
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:14,557
Cocaine - 1 teaspoon.

937
01:00:15,298 --> 01:00:17,214
Strawberry flavour
- as required.

938
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:18,850
Methodology

939
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,808
First, find a paint shop.

940
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:29,183
Paint the grey car with the pink paint.

941
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:29,771
Then...

942
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:32,975
The cocaine that you hunted...

943
01:00:34,058 --> 01:00:37,517
...and the strawberry essence...

944
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:40,892
...shall be mixed nicely...

945
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:45,100
...and stirred till the
white color changes.

946
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,100
Apply it on the pink car.

947
01:00:51,142 --> 01:00:52,475
What if we don't get anything?

948
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:56,683
Deivanayagam will fry
you in boiling oil.

949
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:00,183
All that is good.

950
01:01:00,558 --> 01:01:02,058
We don't have any of the stuff...

951
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:03,642
nor the pink paint.

952
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:05,767
We don't have the strawberry
essence either.

953
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:06,558
Why not?

954
01:01:06,725 --> 01:01:07,392
I've got it.

955
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:09,600
Where did you get this?

956
01:01:09,642 --> 01:01:11,225
I snitched it when
we took the car.

957
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,683
I tasted it a little. Hope
that wouldn't be an issue?

958
01:01:16,128 --> 01:01:17,420
OK....

959
01:01:18,225 --> 01:01:19,017
Stuff?

960
01:01:19,392 --> 01:01:20,517
There is a plan.

961
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:29,550
What is it?

962
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,800
I think the car just
ran out of gas...

963
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:34,383
Oh! oh!

964
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:35,842
That's not good!

965
01:01:36,258 --> 01:01:37,425
It's already late.

966
01:01:37,633 --> 01:01:38,717
Now what?

967
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:41,717
Well you spent all
the money on booze.

968
01:01:42,717 --> 01:01:44,425
Now how are we
going to fill gas?

969
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:00,550
How further are we
going to keep pushing?

970
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,758
There seems to be no signs
of any gas stations.

971
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,425
Burn your idea!

972
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:06,300
We don't have gas
to burn it though.

973
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:08,092
Do you have a better idea?

974
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:08,883
Tell me.

975
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,258
Didn't you bluff yesterday...

976
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:12,925
...that Rawther has a gas reserve?

977
01:02:13,217 --> 01:02:15,467
How about fetching
from that well?

978
01:02:15,508 --> 01:02:16,883
Hello brother, firstly...

979
01:02:17,258 --> 01:02:18,050
I wasn't bluffing.

980
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:19,133
It is true.

981
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:20,633
Secondly...

982
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:21,925
It's not a well.

983
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:22,925
It's a Silo

984
01:02:23,258 --> 01:02:25,008
Its just like a big water tank.

985
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:26,550
How?

986
01:02:26,717 --> 01:02:27,883
Like the one over there?

987
01:02:33,508 --> 01:02:34,133
Thank GOD!

988
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:54,592
Sir Rawther...

989
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:56,633
I don't know how to
put this across.

990
01:02:56,675 --> 01:02:59,467
Only after the full body scan...

991
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:01,425
...we could diagnose.

992
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:05,758
How many bones does the
human body consists of?

993
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:07,569
Bones?

994
01:03:11,258 --> 01:03:12,467
It's 206.

995
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,217
Sir Rawther...

996
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:17,300
I am very sorry to tell you this.

997
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:19,633
I don't know how to put it across.

998
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:21,258
I've crushed many heads,

999
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:22,550
all the ten fingers.

1000
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:23,883
Jaws..

1001
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,633
Hands & legs...

1002
01:03:26,758 --> 01:03:28,133
What other parts?

1003
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:31,995
We have spared no bones.
From toe to neck...

1004
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:35,717
We aren't supposed to lie
to doctors and lawyers.

1005
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:36,717
Shut up.

1006
01:03:39,758 --> 01:03:43,425
So in all I've broken all the 206 bones.
What do you say doctor?

1007
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:45,467
Might be.

1008
01:03:45,883 --> 01:03:46,758
What do you mean?

1009
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:49,217
There are tiny bones
inside our ears...

1010
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,383
...and there is no guarantee
that those might have broken.

1011
01:03:51,383 --> 01:03:52,592
So the count is 205...

1012
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,592
Sir....

1013
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:55,717
Let me tell you
what I had to say.

1014
01:03:56,342 --> 01:03:57,175
You...

1015
01:03:57,717 --> 01:03:59,050
You've been diagnosed
with cancer.

1016
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,217
Cancer?

1017
01:04:07,425 --> 01:04:08,383
What type of cancer?

1018
01:04:10,008 --> 01:04:11,217
Well that...

1019
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:12,050
Prostate cancer.

1020
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:15,175
Prosti...

1021
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:15,800
tute...

1022
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,425
No that's on your...

1023
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,425
"B....A"?

1024
01:04:24,842 --> 01:04:25,383
"A....L"?

1025
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:26,925
"A....L"?

1026
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:28,217
"L....S"?

1027
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:29,925
Above the legs?

1028
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,800
If you don't treat it properly....

1029
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:42,217
Then may be 4 months...

1030
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,050
Si..

1031
01:04:43,383 --> 01:04:44,258
May be six months.

1032
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,592
By then, I'll have to
enjoy all my wealth!

1033
01:04:53,758 --> 01:04:55,342
How do we take Petrol out of it?

1034
01:04:56,717 --> 01:04:57,508
I've an idea.

1035
01:04:57,883 --> 01:04:59,675
You have an ID right?

1036
01:05:00,175 --> 01:05:00,675
Take that.

1037
01:05:01,342 --> 01:05:04,967
He is always like the TTE who checks Tatkal
tickets. Always asking for the ID card!

1038
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,092
Take. What are you
going to tell him?

1039
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:29,550
"I am Narasimhan"

1040
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:31,383
"From All India Petrol Gas Association"

1041
01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:33,217
Well, fine...

1042
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,967
But I can't let you in.

1043
01:05:35,508 --> 01:05:37,508
Who are you to say so?

1044
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:40,925
We have received information on
illegal gas being produced here.

1045
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:42,758
You have got wrong information.

1046
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,092
There is nothing of that
sort happening here.

1047
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:46,633
Well. I get to decide that.

1048
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:48,467
"I want sample"

1049
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:49,717
"Petrol sample"

1050
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:53,925
Let me call and
check with my boss.

1051
01:05:59,717 --> 01:06:00,758
Mr. Rawther?

1052
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:02,342
Go ahead, call him.

1053
01:06:02,675 --> 01:06:04,092
Do you know him?

1054
01:06:04,092 --> 01:06:05,383
Yes. Call him.

1055
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,383
Hello sir...

1056
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:13,467
Hello

1057
01:06:13,925 --> 01:06:15,381
The security is calling up Rawther.

1058
01:06:16,008 --> 01:06:17,408
Get ready to trace the call.

1059
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,133
Today, we'll catch hold
of Rawther red handed!

1060
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:20,717
What?

1061
01:06:21,217 --> 01:06:22,675
Red handed?

1062
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,050
Just fill the gas and come!

1063
01:06:25,508 --> 01:06:28,258
What else we could do sir?
We have no other option.

1064
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:29,577
I don't understand any
of what he is blabbering!

1065
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:31,608
Under the charges of
non co-operation,

1066
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:33,733
let's arrest the security
under grade 10 section c.

1067
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:34,942
Yes sir.

1068
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:35,958
Sir?

1069
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,208
Sure sir.

1070
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,000
Rawther will be here
and we'll arrest him.

1071
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:39,708
Yes sir.

1072
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:40,958
Sir?

1073
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:44,542
Ok, so we'll tell Rawther that
his security was the spy.

1074
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,292
Sounds good.

1075
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:46,542
Good.

1076
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:47,675
Jai Hind Sir.

1077
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,892
Your name?

1078
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:52,475
Se..Se..Sendhan.

1079
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:54,475
Mr. Sendhan you are
at the wrong place.

1080
01:06:54,475 --> 01:06:56,308
Since you aren't providing
us any information...

1081
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:57,767
You'll have to report
at our office tomorrow.

1082
01:06:57,767 --> 01:06:58,392
Please come.

1083
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:00,975
Sir, all you wanted was little sample.
Please take it.

1084
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,058
No. Thank you.

1085
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:03,267
Call up Mr. Rawther.

1086
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,770
Please go ahead in taking
as much sample as you want.

1087
01:07:06,992 --> 01:07:07,742
Fine. Come on.

1088
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:09,867
As Jil goes to fetch sample..

1089
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,575
Rawther's men play cards.

1090
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,781
Rawther decides to sell all his
property and settle in Switzerland.

1091
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:18,700
Narasimhan keeps
pulling the rope.

1092
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:24,158
Meanwhile, Juk and Jung were
whiling away their time.

1093
01:09:28,117 --> 01:09:28,867
Looks awesome!

1094
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,033
Clicked?

1095
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,033
- Ok.
- Super.

1096
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,908
- It's mind blowing.
- Ok.

1097
01:09:44,242 --> 01:09:45,450
- Ok?
- It's terrific!

1098
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:26,742
What the...

1099
01:10:36,367 --> 01:10:38,367
Juk!!!

1100
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:40,226
Juk!!!

1101
01:10:41,664 --> 01:10:44,539
One more, with the explosion
as the backdrop.

1102
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:46,739
How did it explode?

1103
01:10:47,087 --> 01:10:48,421
The fire marble.

1104
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,625
Stop posing. This is no
camera mobile you fool!

1105
01:10:53,445 --> 01:10:54,736
What? Not a camera mobile?

1106
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:56,606
Why is he running towards us?

1107
01:10:58,117 --> 01:11:00,450
Run! They are coming for us.

1108
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:01,867
Coming for us?

1109
01:11:01,908 --> 01:11:02,575
Coming for us?

1110
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,158
Now come...

1111
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,783
Coming for us. They
are coming for us!!!

1112
01:11:24,033 --> 01:11:24,700
Get up. Come on.

1113
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:26,158
Stop it and come!

1114
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,575
Swear to me. Is it really
not a mobile camera?

1115
01:11:40,658 --> 01:11:41,117
Get lost!

1116
01:11:47,992 --> 01:11:49,325
It won't start...

1117
01:11:49,876 --> 01:11:50,530
it'll need a push.

1118
01:11:50,658 --> 01:11:51,992
Now get in!

1119
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:52,617
Put it on neutral!

1120
01:11:52,658 --> 01:11:54,158
Push! Put it on neutral!

1121
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:56,867
- Push!
- Push!

1122
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:00,658
Push. And you move!

1123
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,700
Get in! Come on!

1124
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:08,533
How did it explode?

1125
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:09,492
- You tell him.
- You tell him.

1126
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:11,744
Damn it! One of you tell me!

1127
01:12:12,075 --> 01:12:15,158
We were playing marbles
with fire marble.

1128
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:15,950
Guess what I won!

1129
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:17,950
Get lost!

1130
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,450
Go fast!

1131
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:28,742
Drive fast. They are chasing us.

1132
01:12:30,867 --> 01:12:31,450
Fast!

1133
01:13:39,617 --> 01:13:40,908
Why did you throw it away?

1134
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:42,408
It's Rawther men's gun.

1135
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:43,950
It's risky to carry with us.

1136
01:13:44,204 --> 01:13:45,704
Moreover there are
no bullets in it.

1137
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:52,434
There are some who just for
the sake of it, spend a lot...

1138
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:54,553
just to enjoy their life.

1139
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:55,279
Chief!

1140
01:13:56,836 --> 01:13:58,454
Your gas Silo exploded!

1141
01:13:59,867 --> 01:14:00,961
It's gone.

1142
01:14:06,231 --> 01:14:07,263
5 minutes...

1143
01:14:08,723 --> 01:14:11,862
5 minutes ago I was
observing this skeleton...

1144
01:14:11,888 --> 01:14:15,229
and was recollecting about the
good times of my life.

1145
01:14:17,096 --> 01:14:17,760
But now?

1146
01:14:18,728 --> 01:14:20,538
My immovable property is destructed.

1147
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:22,624
and my health is disrupted.

1148
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,226
Doctor, you said I've Cancer...

1149
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:29,855
You set up a date with death
for me, Rolex Rawther.

1150
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:33,912
You even elaborate about the
disease in front of all my men.

1151
01:14:34,988 --> 01:14:38,556
You ask me to dispose off all my
wealth and go on a pilgrimage.

1152
01:14:42,095 --> 01:14:43,275
But apart from all these...

1153
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,549
Do you know what
was bothering me?

1154
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:53,570
205...

1155
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:08,917
& that's 206!

1156
01:15:15,155 --> 01:15:16,733
I hope the cheer girls
are waiting in the car.

1157
01:15:16,764 --> 01:15:17,451
Yes chief.

1158
01:15:19,288 --> 01:15:20,403
Ok so let's make
a mutual deal...

1159
01:15:20,943 --> 01:15:21,482
3 hours.

1160
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:24,583
This ain't about
money to bargain!

1161
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:25,802
The paint has to dry.

1162
01:15:26,287 --> 01:15:27,494
It'll take 4 hours.

1163
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,814
- Where do such people come from!
- Ok...

1164
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:31,080
Three and half hours.

1165
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:33,139
Don't you understand?

1166
01:15:34,376 --> 01:15:35,032
So let us...

1167
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:36,192
make a...

1168
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:37,129
mutual deal!

1169
01:15:38,904 --> 01:15:40,020
2.5 hours.

1170
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,250
Let's strike the deal.

1171
01:15:42,373 --> 01:15:43,160
What do you say?

1172
01:15:43,443 --> 01:15:44,971
You guys better leave.

1173
01:15:45,429 --> 01:15:47,827
- I guess they find me and irritate.
- Listen to me brother.

1174
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:48,855
- What?
- Well...

1175
01:15:54,548 --> 01:15:55,587
It's for a movie shoot.

1176
01:15:55,947 --> 01:15:56,634
Movie shoot?

1177
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:57,555
Which one?

1178
01:15:57,738 --> 01:15:58,808
The one with Sonu Sawant.

1179
01:15:58,813 --> 01:15:59,844
Sonu Sawant's movie.

1180
01:15:59,962 --> 01:16:00,553
Is it?

1181
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:02,209
You got to be kidding me.

1182
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,421
Sonu Sawant?!

1183
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,381
Looks like he is also
a Sonu Sawant fan!

1184
01:16:06,577 --> 01:16:10,090
Listen, if you can pause
all you other works...

1185
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,137
and finish this work for me...

1186
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,582
I'll ensure you a snap
with Sonu Sawant.

1187
01:16:16,082 --> 01:16:17,785
Are you serious?

1188
01:16:18,873 --> 01:16:20,444
Looks like he doesn't trust.

1189
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:25,606
Look who is this.

1190
01:16:25,973 --> 01:16:26,960
Sonu Sawant?

1191
01:16:27,348 --> 01:16:28,285
Llook who is beside her?

1192
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:29,105
That's me.

1193
01:16:29,512 --> 01:16:30,222
And now it's your turn.

1194
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:32,113
2.5 hours.

1195
01:16:32,543 --> 01:16:33,420
I'll finish the work.

1196
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:34,400
- Deal?
- Deal.

1197
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:35,483
- Deal?
- Deal.

1198
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:38,827
- Don't forget about the snap.
- Ok.

1199
01:16:46,272 --> 01:16:49,061
Ok, the painting is taken care.
Now where do we head for cocaine?

1200
01:16:51,933 --> 01:16:52,909
Where did this come from?

1201
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:54,409
Were you carrying
it all this time?

1202
01:16:54,871 --> 01:16:55,917
Let's not plan murder.

1203
01:16:56,206 --> 01:16:56,858
Shut up.

1204
01:17:03,739 --> 01:17:05,631
Mangalam, I'm by
the Andhra border.

1205
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,674
I'm in urgent need
of some Cocaine.

1206
01:17:07,713 --> 01:17:09,504
If you are looking for
Cocaine in Andhra...

1207
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:12,629
...there is only one
name to look for...

1208
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:13,758
ATTACK.

1209
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:16,892
Have you ever met anyone who...

1210
01:17:17,474 --> 01:17:20,521
..gives you the thought of
staying away from them?

1211
01:17:21,033 --> 01:17:22,478
He is such a guy.

1212
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:23,772
ATTACK

1213
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,193
Gun Shot King.

1214
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:30,889
Most importantly he is
Deiva's arch rival.

1215
01:17:32,941 --> 01:17:34,371
Mangalam, you there?

1216
01:17:35,355 --> 01:17:37,113
Ok convey exactly
what I say to Attack.

1217
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:42,294
Yes Jil...

1218
01:17:42,506 --> 01:17:44,178
I've conveyed what
you said to Attack.

1219
01:17:44,303 --> 01:17:47,077
You and the Uganda client,
meet him at his house at 4.30

1220
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,622
I've been dry for some time...

1221
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,919
Can you reacharge me with the
jolly internet pack for Rs.30?

1222
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:57,102
He gave as a treasure
and begs for peanuts!

1223
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:57,808
But Uganda?

1224
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:01,186
Are you kidding me?

1225
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:03,954
Where are we going to
find a black?

1226
01:18:32,998 --> 01:18:34,222
Ah! Come one my dear!

1227
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:35,152
Fine...

1228
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,690
What if Attack talks to him?

1229
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,941
He doesn't speak Ugandese.

1230
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,019
Ugandese?

1231
01:18:40,892 --> 01:18:41,711
Totally forgot about that.

1232
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:45,462
Listen you  movie buff...

1233
01:18:45,572 --> 01:18:47,140
Don't you watch African movies?

1234
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,867
Teach him few words from that.

1235
01:18:50,398 --> 01:18:50,976
Jil...

1236
01:18:51,789 --> 01:18:55,115
The Chinese, Korean and African
movies that I watched...

1237
01:18:55,389 --> 01:18:57,229
...aren't the ones that
you are talking about.

1238
01:18:57,615 --> 01:18:59,276
They hardly have any
dialogues in them.

1239
01:19:00,264 --> 01:19:01,324
Do what I say!

1240
01:19:01,349 --> 01:19:01,799
Move.

1241
01:19:18,867 --> 01:19:19,925
All ok.

1242
01:19:20,805 --> 01:19:21,992
Listen Narsi Mandela...

1243
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:24,705
Memorize everything
that he teaches you.

1244
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:27,257
I'll have this gun pointed
at you all the time.

1245
01:19:27,469 --> 01:19:28,961
You should reply accordingly.

1246
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:31,518
Make one mistake.....

1247
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:33,382
Remember the gun is pointed at you.

1248
01:19:33,891 --> 01:19:36,964
I blow off your belly!

1249
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:39,344
Yes and I'll blow off your ears.

1250
01:19:40,837 --> 01:19:42,125
Now who is giving you a gun?!

1251
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:43,047
Waster!

1252
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:52,826
Jil...

1253
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:56,234
Jil, buddy listen to me.

1254
01:19:56,303 --> 01:19:56,824
WHAT?!

1255
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,616
Think over it again,
one last time!

1256
01:19:58,984 --> 01:19:59,896
He is very dangerous.

1257
01:20:00,122 --> 01:20:01,185
We are defenseless.

1258
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,396
I don't think this
will workout for good.

1259
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,614
This is my Grandpa's gun...

1260
01:20:14,285 --> 01:20:15,667
When he gave this to me...

1261
01:20:15,886 --> 01:20:17,074
Do you know what he said?

1262
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:26,005
Where did you say the stuff is from?

1263
01:20:27,117 --> 01:20:28,014
From You-Ganged- a?

1264
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,141
Uganda chief.

1265
01:20:35,061 --> 01:20:36,529
I need to ask you guys something.

1266
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,738
What is the capital of Uganda?

1267
01:21:01,834 --> 01:21:02,521
Chill...

1268
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,498
Chill. I was just kidding.

1269
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:07,782
Don't get nervous...

1270
01:21:20,613 --> 01:21:22,137
But tell me, this
stuff from Uganda...

1271
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:23,800
Why did you bring it here?

1272
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:25,136
Do you know anything about me?

1273
01:21:25,137 --> 01:21:25,863
Oh yeah!

1274
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:27,082
BABY!

1275
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,524
What does he mean?

1276
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:32,875
Why is he calling me baby?

1277
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:35,086
Well that...

1278
01:21:35,164 --> 01:21:38,841
He meant that your business
compared to his is pretty small.

1279
01:21:40,404 --> 01:21:41,545
"I baby you"

1280
01:21:43,339 --> 01:21:44,378
"But here..."

1281
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:47,684
Just leave it chief.

1282
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:49,106
Do you think so?

1283
01:21:49,846 --> 01:21:50,991
Let's talk about the deal.

1284
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:51,716
Let's talk.

1285
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,094
Let's talk about the deal.

1286
01:21:56,574 --> 01:21:59,295
We've a new type of Cocaine.

1287
01:21:59,712 --> 01:22:00,742
It's a flavored one.

1288
01:22:02,164 --> 01:22:04,679
Smuggling it every time from Brazil...

1289
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:06,414
...is a daunting task.

1290
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,154
Lot of hassles.

1291
01:22:08,978 --> 01:22:11,007
That is why we need
a local dealer.

1292
01:22:11,804 --> 01:22:13,804
If you become our partner...

1293
01:22:14,124 --> 01:22:15,322
It'll be a huge profit.

1294
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:19,221
Usually everyone starts
a line with a dot...

1295
01:22:21,596 --> 01:22:23,002
But if you join our line...

1296
01:22:23,432 --> 01:22:25,291
There won't be a full
stop and you can rule!

1297
01:22:30,141 --> 01:22:30,945
Let it be...

1298
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:33,633
How did you smuggle the
stuff from Uganda?

1299
01:22:34,751 --> 01:22:36,153
I would like to hear that first.

1300
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:42,409
So... first the best quality of Cocaine is
collected from the forests of South America.

1301
01:22:45,946 --> 01:22:47,438
Get up!

1302
01:22:47,616 --> 01:22:49,326
Shut your mouth!

1303
01:22:49,592 --> 01:22:50,592
Hands up!

1304
01:22:50,952 --> 01:22:51,834
Legs up!

1305
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,256
Then it's dried up.

1306
01:22:58,282 --> 01:23:01,648
Then it is sent to Europe for refining.

1307
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:03,211
Get me some ant powder.

1308
01:23:03,348 --> 01:23:04,433
I said ant powder.

1309
01:23:06,957 --> 01:23:07,762
Quick.

1310
01:23:10,306 --> 01:23:12,166
It is then soaked
in some sweeteners.

1311
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:15,499
The rose water.

1312
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:16,692
Then...

1313
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:17,554
Dude Juice powder.

1314
01:23:17,624 --> 01:23:18,429
Dude Juice powder.

1315
01:23:18,507 --> 01:23:19,490
What?

1316
01:23:19,614 --> 01:23:20,778
Juice powder?

1317
01:23:21,278 --> 01:23:24,997
Not Juice, Rus...Russia's
best quality oranges.

1318
01:23:25,278 --> 01:23:27,278
They are dried up and powdered.

1319
01:23:27,442 --> 01:23:28,191
Mix it all.

1320
01:23:28,514 --> 01:23:29,090
I said mix it.

1321
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:32,085
Do it properly.

1322
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:35,252
MIX IT!

1323
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:38,744
Now leave it.

1324
01:23:39,346 --> 01:23:41,049
And finally processed to...

1325
01:23:45,463 --> 01:23:46,142
How much?

1326
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:54,170
Why the heck do you think I'm
threatening him with the gun?

1327
01:23:54,171 --> 01:23:55,509
...and you want to pay him?

1328
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,134
Fine, get some water too.

1329
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:02,073
Well it sounds really nice...

1330
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:04,174
I am pretty eager to taste it.

1331
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:07,072
Oh god!

1332
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:09,023
Now what?

1333
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:10,586
Nothing chief.

1334
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:11,278
That's...

1335
01:24:11,518 --> 01:24:12,492
...not to be licked.

1336
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:13,679
It is to be sniffed.

1337
01:24:16,328 --> 01:24:17,305
Oh! Stuff to be sniffed.

1338
01:24:24,485 --> 01:24:24,935
Hold on...

1339
01:24:27,684 --> 01:24:28,566
Before sniffing it...

1340
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:29,981
Confirm the deal.

1341
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:31,403
Partners?

1342
01:24:34,059 --> 01:24:34,927
Yes, partners.

1343
01:24:36,217 --> 01:24:37,162
One more thing...

1344
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:39,612
What?

1345
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,611
Can you show us sample of your stuff?

1346
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,590
So that we can check
it's quality.

1347
01:24:50,535 --> 01:24:51,887
High class Cocaine.

1348
01:24:52,747 --> 01:24:53,536
Sounds good?

1349
01:24:59,923 --> 01:25:01,232
Ant powder...

1350
01:25:02,216 --> 01:25:03,106
He'll sniff it.

1351
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:04,686
It'll hit him.

1352
01:25:05,374 --> 01:25:06,576
His ears will start ringing...

1353
01:25:08,607 --> 01:25:10,269
Take the Cocaine and gun him down.

1354
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,605
The gun and the gown! All mine.

1355
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:31,816
Just a moment.

1356
01:25:33,887 --> 01:25:34,837
Tell me Pai.

1357
01:25:34,908 --> 01:25:37,736
Attack, did Narasimhan turn up?

1358
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,473
Narasimhan who?

1359
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,065
What do you mean by who?

1360
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:44,484
He is the one supposed to steal Deiva's
stuff from those 3 fellows...

1361
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:47,609
...and hand it over to you.
That Narasimhan.

1362
01:25:47,782 --> 01:25:50,813
He looks like a bear
dressed up as a witch!

1363
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,312
No Pai...

1364
01:25:53,385 --> 01:25:54,852
No one like that turned up.

1365
01:25:55,493 --> 01:25:57,742
Well, then you won't
know what I mean.

1366
01:25:58,087 --> 01:26:02,101
Oh my, I'm worried if he
is stuck somewhere.

1367
01:26:02,436 --> 01:26:05,215
If Deiva finds out about this...

1368
01:26:05,262 --> 01:26:06,746
Don't worry Pai.

1369
01:26:08,092 --> 01:26:09,614
To get rid of Deiva...

1370
01:26:09,856 --> 01:26:11,262
I've got many other ways.

1371
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:14,089
He is not attending my call.

1372
01:26:14,137 --> 01:26:16,394
Why don't you try calling him?

1373
01:26:16,418 --> 01:26:17,093
Fine.

1374
01:26:18,543 --> 01:26:18,993
Faster.

1375
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:19,688
Faster.

1376
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:21,558
Coming. Coming.

1377
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:23,767
How did he know the dialogue?

1378
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:37,341
Party?

1379
01:26:41,342 --> 01:26:41,792
Hello.

1380
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:42,737
Hello.

1381
01:26:43,318 --> 01:26:43,849
Hello.

1382
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,665
Hello.

1383
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:49,866
Hello.

1384
01:26:50,283 --> 01:26:50,876
Hello!

1385
01:26:53,518 --> 01:26:54,188
What the...!

1386
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,141
Shut up!

1387
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:03,995
Hands up!

1388
01:27:05,756 --> 01:27:06,928
One more step...

1389
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:07,893
I'll...

1390
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:08,948
I'll shoot you.

1391
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,538
One more step...

1392
01:27:22,657 --> 01:27:23,445
I'll fire.

1393
01:27:40,031 --> 01:27:41,077
Listen to me...

1394
01:27:42,826 --> 01:27:45,617
The stuff you have....Give
us the stuff you have.

1395
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:47,279
and we'll leave.

1396
01:27:47,748 --> 01:27:49,658
Ever played snakes & ladder?

1397
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,502
I asked.. Have you ever
played snakes & ladder?

1398
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:54,306
I have...

1399
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,548
What about it?

1400
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:59,130
Everyone climbs up with
the help of ladders.

1401
01:27:59,413 --> 01:28:00,255
But me.

1402
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:05,429
I climb clinging on to the snakes.

1403
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:08,770
And you are threatening me?

1404
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:10,403
I'll fire.

1405
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,764
Do you what my grandpa said
when he gave me this gun?

1406
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,586
Tell me where is the
pink car Deiva gave you?

1407
01:28:17,027 --> 01:28:17,964
Boss!

1408
01:28:18,144 --> 01:28:19,105
My Lord!

1409
01:28:19,247 --> 01:28:21,636
Are you the party Pai was talking about?

1410
01:28:21,661 --> 01:28:23,661
Save me from these fellows.

1411
01:28:24,687 --> 01:28:26,687
Shoot them down!

1412
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:31,653
So you are Narasimhan?

1413
01:28:35,371 --> 01:28:36,264
Where is the stuff?

1414
01:28:40,124 --> 01:28:42,635
Until now, no one in my family
has ever fired this gun.

1415
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,975
Because the need never arose.

1416
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,249
This is the last warning...

1417
01:28:46,795 --> 01:28:47,888
Please listen to me...

1418
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,109
Give us the stuff.

1419
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:51,491
We'll leave.

1420
01:28:51,789 --> 01:28:52,239
Or else...

1421
01:28:53,445 --> 01:28:54,281
I'll fire.

1422
01:28:55,195 --> 01:28:56,375
Go ahead. Fire.

1423
01:28:57,235 --> 01:28:58,717
And when the time comes...

1424
01:28:59,302 --> 01:29:00,961
He said look straight into
the enemy's eye and shoot.

1425
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:04,647
You better fire...

1426
01:29:05,553 --> 01:29:08,398
He said plant all the bullets
on your enemy's chest!

1427
01:29:09,326 --> 01:29:11,052
Before you pull the trigger...

1428
01:29:11,851 --> 01:29:13,014
With this gun, I will...

1429
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,849
...shoot the four of you thrice.

1430
01:29:16,723 --> 01:29:17,515
How about that?

1431
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:18,575
I'll fire.

1432
01:29:18,763 --> 01:29:20,309
Now shoot!

1433
01:29:20,482 --> 01:29:21,216
Fire!

1434
01:29:24,911 --> 01:29:27,381
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

1435
01:29:45,675 --> 01:29:46,534
Tata! Bye!

1436
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:49,073
Oh screw me!

1437
01:29:57,359 --> 01:29:59,312
There's this movie named
"Butterfly Effect"

1438
01:29:59,904 --> 01:30:01,162
It is said that...

1439
01:30:01,427 --> 01:30:04,795
If a butterfly flaps its
wings in one direction...

1440
01:30:04,888 --> 01:30:06,100
a chain of incidents follow.

1441
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:07,936
And if it flaps the other way...

1442
01:30:08,093 --> 01:30:09,491
...another chain of
incidents follow.

1443
01:30:09,689 --> 01:30:10,569
So that means...

1444
01:30:10,842 --> 01:30:13,506
events that turns fate...

1445
01:30:14,301 --> 01:30:18,340
...are totally remote
and unrelated to it.

1446
01:30:18,721 --> 01:30:20,150
That's the Butterfly effect!

1447
01:30:31,031 --> 01:30:33,664
Attack has tumbled.

1448
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,145
Dead are these, if
Jil uses no brains!

1449
01:30:42,419 --> 01:30:44,885
Attack has tumbled.

1450
01:31:13,504 --> 01:31:15,595
Deiva won't finish us off...

1451
01:31:15,722 --> 01:31:17,948
We will betray
and finish him off.

1452
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,900
You sound good with all
such philosophies.

1453
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:23,871
There is no news on the
car as well as on Attack.

1454
01:31:24,582 --> 01:31:25,793
What now?

1455
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:32,021
Rawther?

1456
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:33,113
What are you doing here?

1457
01:31:33,707 --> 01:31:34,729
Stopped by to check on you.

1458
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,277
How've you been?

1459
01:31:38,716 --> 01:31:39,793
Well, there, I asked you.

1460
01:31:40,254 --> 01:31:41,420
Won't you return the favour?

1461
01:31:43,116 --> 01:31:44,257
I hope...

1462
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:45,297
you are doing well?

1463
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:48,008
No I'm not well.

1464
01:31:55,173 --> 01:31:55,623
Hello!

1465
01:31:56,564 --> 01:31:57,887
One pineapple juice.

1466
01:31:58,619 --> 01:31:59,314
One!

1467
01:31:59,984 --> 01:32:01,631
I didn't mean tea!

1468
01:32:01,656 --> 01:32:02,082
Only 1.

1469
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,577
One! One!

1470
01:32:04,851 --> 01:32:05,301
Buddy...

1471
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,005
I'm trembling with fear.

1472
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:10,568
We are stuck between the 3
most deadliest criminals!

1473
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:13,238
Added to them,
are the Chinese!

1474
01:32:13,543 --> 01:32:16,441
Only if that gun had fired and Attack
would've been out of that list.

1475
01:32:16,501 --> 01:32:17,855
Don't you talk about that gun!

1476
01:32:23,475 --> 01:32:24,272
What color is this?

1477
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:27,023
Looks to me like the color of my granny's

1478
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:29,623
hair.

1479
01:32:29,865 --> 01:32:30,521
Looks like!

1480
01:32:31,187 --> 01:32:32,898
Do you know what
upsets me the most?

1481
01:32:33,427 --> 01:32:34,693
All your orders are here...

1482
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:36,535
but mine isn't here yet!

1483
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:38,661
- Hey, where is the juice?
- I've given it a good thought

1484
01:32:38,935 --> 01:32:40,529
There seems to be no
escape from this.

1485
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,278
I can see death approaching us!

1486
01:32:42,427 --> 01:32:44,599
It's good thay you see
death approaching.

1487
01:32:47,216 --> 01:32:48,567
Only when you have the
near death experience...

1488
01:32:49,453 --> 01:32:51,080
You'll find the purpose of life.

1489
01:32:51,105 --> 01:32:51,987
Listen to me Jil...

1490
01:33:26,346 --> 01:33:26,796
PLAN!

1491
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,179
How long before the
car is painted?

1492
01:33:34,788 --> 01:33:35,467
20 mins.

1493
01:33:37,928 --> 01:33:38,552
Call up Deiva.

1494
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:40,995
Are you kidding me?

1495
01:33:41,636 --> 01:33:42,519
Are you kidding me?

1496
01:33:43,111 --> 01:33:45,121
All I ordered was a
pineapple juice.

1497
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:45,837
Make the call.

1498
01:33:45,919 --> 01:33:47,403
And? What will I tell him?

1499
01:33:48,017 --> 01:33:49,570
Tell him what he wants to hear.

1500
01:33:54,142 --> 01:33:54,592
Hello.

1501
01:33:55,853 --> 01:33:56,491
Deiva sir!

1502
01:33:57,453 --> 01:33:59,585
If killing was possible
through phones...

1503
01:33:59,788 --> 01:34:02,475
there would have been grasses
growing on your tomb!

1504
01:34:02,944 --> 01:34:04,129
I'm coming for you.

1505
01:34:04,879 --> 01:34:06,419
We are dead! Deiva
is coming for us.

1506
01:34:06,589 --> 01:34:07,839
That makes it easy. Continue...

1507
01:34:08,084 --> 01:34:08,622
Easy?

1508
01:34:10,865 --> 01:34:12,667
I understand your anger.

1509
01:34:12,738 --> 01:34:14,730
We had to encounter a lot
of hassles with the car.

1510
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:17,081
The engine broke down
and we were stranded.

1511
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:19,235
We didn't want to bother
you with all this.

1512
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:20,768
Your pressure will go high.

1513
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:23,259
Handing over the stuff
alone isn't our duty...

1514
01:34:23,587 --> 01:34:25,587
ensuring your well
being too is our duty.

1515
01:34:26,147 --> 01:34:28,100
Then why didn't you
attend any calls?

1516
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:29,788
Believe me, the car is safe.

1517
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,658
We have solved all the problems.

1518
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:35,285
It cost us 2 hours and 15 mins.

1519
01:34:35,731 --> 01:34:37,355
Still, we'll figure out a way...

1520
01:34:37,582 --> 01:34:40,543
and ensure the stuff is
delivered before time.

1521
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,676
Listen, if the stuff is
delivered on time...

1522
01:34:44,105 --> 01:34:45,238
I'll skin you...

1523
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:48,207
and use the skin to hang you up
and then thrash the hell out of you!

1524
01:34:49,121 --> 01:34:49,712
Careful!

1525
01:34:55,964 --> 01:34:56,940
Who'll win this match?

1526
01:34:57,282 --> 01:34:58,211
Either team can win.

1527
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,672
Why do you ask?

1528
01:35:02,056 --> 01:35:03,977
India and Pakistan are arch rivals.

1529
01:35:04,676 --> 01:35:06,676
Every time they come
face to face...

1530
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:10,158
It sets off a wildfire.

1531
01:35:10,275 --> 01:35:11,212
Isn't it?

1532
01:35:12,057 --> 01:35:12,650
Indeed.

1533
01:35:13,096 --> 01:35:13,914
So what about it?

1534
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,773
So, during an India
- Pakistan match...

1535
01:35:19,499 --> 01:35:20,496
One loses...

1536
01:35:21,256 --> 01:35:22,153
and one wins.

1537
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:24,435
One will head to the finals...

1538
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:26,403
One will head back home.

1539
01:35:26,935 --> 01:35:28,635
So what does that mean?

1540
01:35:28,877 --> 01:35:31,658
You mean, we'll leave
once the match is done.

1541
01:35:31,957 --> 01:35:32,911
You go ahead, tell me.

1542
01:35:34,744 --> 01:35:37,145
We will fix the match
between India and Pakistan.

1543
01:35:39,664 --> 01:35:40,600
Don't you get it?

1544
01:35:42,172 --> 01:35:44,172
If Deiva is India...

1545
01:35:45,379 --> 01:35:46,997
...then that means
Rawther is Pakistan.

1546
01:35:52,218 --> 01:35:53,739
We came in search of food...

1547
01:35:54,271 --> 01:35:56,356
but looks like we've
stumbled on to a feast.

1548
01:35:59,059 --> 01:36:01,036
Yuck, what is this?

1549
01:36:02,802 --> 01:36:04,185
You have spilled the juice.

1550
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:06,633
Do you know what this invites?

1551
01:36:11,115 --> 01:36:12,147
Don't you hear me?

1552
01:36:16,793 --> 01:36:18,819
Ants. It invites ants.

1553
01:36:19,317 --> 01:36:20,442
Correct.

1554
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:24,166
Do you know what else
invite ants?

1555
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:27,609
A rivalry with me.

1556
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:30,015
The thought of betraying me.

1557
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:34,102
The lie you said that the
gas silo would never explode...

1558
01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:35,040
...has invited ants.

1559
01:36:35,065 --> 01:36:36,470
And along with it, me.

1560
01:36:36,547 --> 01:36:40,196
I swear Rawther, I built
it with utmost care.

1561
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:42,083
There is no way
it could explode.

1562
01:36:42,108 --> 01:36:44,108
My soul will haun.....

1563
01:36:47,714 --> 01:36:50,222
You built it but it has exploded.

1564
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,220
So on whom do I
take out my anger?

1565
01:36:59,384 --> 01:37:02,532
That's my personal call.

1566
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:07,654
Who could it be?

1567
01:37:08,696 --> 01:37:10,029
Could it be Deiva?

1568
01:37:10,655 --> 01:37:12,154
He is a very old friend.

1569
01:37:12,967 --> 01:37:14,308
A little old enemy.

1570
01:37:17,093 --> 01:37:18,066
Attack?

1571
01:37:20,983 --> 01:37:21,973
Pai...

1572
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,379
You fatso!

1573
01:37:25,425 --> 01:37:27,334
How dare you betray me?

1574
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:30,843
You plan to rob Deiva of his
stuff worth millions...

1575
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:34,210
...and promised to move him
out of the business.

1576
01:37:35,342 --> 01:37:36,706
Instead you rob me of my stuff?

1577
01:37:38,683 --> 01:37:40,373
I'm not going to let you
away with this, Pai.

1578
01:37:40,508 --> 01:37:42,678
Listen, Attack.

1579
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:44,448
Recognize me?

1580
01:37:46,567 --> 01:37:47,217
Rawther?

1581
01:37:54,545 --> 01:37:55,480
Deiva,

1582
01:37:55,706 --> 01:37:56,402
Millions,

1583
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:57,610
stuff,

1584
01:37:58,232 --> 01:37:59,378
out of business.

1585
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:01,370
Pai

1586
01:38:01,738 --> 01:38:04,107
Combine these and make
me a story out of it.

1587
01:38:04,387 --> 01:38:06,833
Rawther, he must be blabbering.

1588
01:38:07,388 --> 01:38:09,638
I don't know what he is talking about.

1589
01:38:11,365 --> 01:38:12,395
- Is it?
- Yes.

1590
01:38:13,309 --> 01:38:15,340
- This ant is called...
- What?

1591
01:38:15,561 --> 01:38:16,816
Bullet ant.

1592
01:38:17,082 --> 01:38:18,488
- Do you know why?
- Why?

1593
01:38:18,761 --> 01:38:21,571
- One ant and one bite
- What happens?

1594
01:38:21,644 --> 01:38:23,416
That spot in your body...

1595
01:38:23,948 --> 01:38:26,158
...would feel the pain
inflicted by 4 bullets.

1596
01:38:27,607 --> 01:38:28,615
No Rawther...

1597
01:38:28,876 --> 01:38:30,204
No Rawther, please let me go.

1598
01:38:30,763 --> 01:38:32,382
The spot on your body will swell...

1599
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,243
and the pain will last for 12 hours.

1600
01:38:36,946 --> 01:38:37,696
Ready?

1601
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,223
No. I'll tell you.

1602
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:40,094
I’ll confess.

1603
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,586
Please don't. I'll tell you.

1604
01:38:42,173 --> 01:38:43,219
I’ll confess.

1605
01:38:53,171 --> 01:38:54,561
Now tell me, where the car is.

1606
01:38:59,485 --> 01:39:00,219
Deiva...

1607
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:01,685
Rawther?

1608
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:04,298
Hope you are fine?

1609
01:39:05,205 --> 01:39:06,601
Well until now, I am.

1610
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:10,265
I have nothing to discuss with you.

1611
01:39:10,476 --> 01:39:11,280
Nor do I like it.

1612
01:39:11,703 --> 01:39:13,195
But I've to tell you something.

1613
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:15,067
That last very dear...

1614
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,927
...pink colored bird of yours.

1615
01:39:18,265 --> 01:39:18,966
Remember?

1616
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:20,605
Rawther...

1617
01:39:21,324 --> 01:39:22,333
This isn't a good time.

1618
01:39:23,977 --> 01:39:24,797
Hear me out.

1619
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:27,250
You set that bird to fly.

1620
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,688
Though it is on it's way
to it's destination...

1621
01:39:30,407 --> 01:39:32,799
...the energy for it to fly
is right now with me.

1622
01:39:36,134 --> 01:39:37,540
Marunthu is in my custody...

1623
01:39:38,197 --> 01:39:39,885
and so is the solution.

1624
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:42,439
So come down quickly
to my Andhra house.

1625
01:39:42,734 --> 01:39:44,609
Heard that it's worth millions.

1626
01:39:44,961 --> 01:39:46,164
I guess, a part of that...

1627
01:39:46,789 --> 01:39:49,079
...will now belong to me.

1628
01:39:49,254 --> 01:39:49,961
Sounds good?

1629
01:39:50,696 --> 01:39:51,547
Furious?

1630
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,928
What next?

1631
01:40:18,233 --> 01:40:19,360
Are we playing dumb charades?

1632
01:40:19,726 --> 01:40:21,382
Are you going to tell
us the plan or not?

1633
01:40:36,636 --> 01:40:38,636
A dot, a comma and an exclamation.

1634
01:40:39,824 --> 01:40:40,631
What does this mean?

1635
01:40:43,242 --> 01:40:45,953
The car is painted and ready but
why are you heading to the silo?

1636
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:48,648
Only 3 of us know that
Deiva's car has exploded.

1637
01:40:49,117 --> 01:40:50,949
Rawther doesn't know about the car at all.

1638
01:40:51,498 --> 01:40:54,554
We'll handover this car to Rawther saying
that it has Deiva's stuff and escape.

1639
01:40:57,215 --> 01:40:58,939
Where are you?

1640
01:40:58,994 --> 01:40:59,962
Near the Silo.

1641
01:41:01,005 --> 01:41:03,922
Why is it destroyed? and why
is our men's car is toppled.

1642
01:41:03,947 --> 01:41:05,351
Well, that's the past.

1643
01:41:05,406 --> 01:41:06,147
Fine.

1644
01:41:06,187 --> 01:41:09,773
After long time I've got the
chance to tackle Deiva.

1645
01:41:09,819 --> 01:41:10,780
That's awesome.

1646
01:41:10,828 --> 01:41:12,828
There are 3 fellows going
around in a pink car.

1647
01:41:13,326 --> 01:41:13,833
Ok...

1648
01:41:13,858 --> 01:41:16,874
Nab them and come to my Andhra house.

1649
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:18,198
I'll take care of it.

1650
01:41:26,988 --> 01:41:28,254
We'll surrender.

1651
01:41:29,221 --> 01:41:33,086
You can tell Rawther that
you toiled hard to nab us.

1652
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:33,704
Why?

1653
01:41:33,813 --> 01:41:36,212
What would you get if you said
you nabbed us easily?

1654
01:41:37,906 --> 01:41:40,766
If Rawther finds out that you risked
your life to catch hold of us...

1655
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,622
You can go to next level. Isn't it?

1656
01:41:55,014 --> 01:41:57,014
Fools!

1657
01:41:57,039 --> 01:41:58,626
Where do they find
species like you?

1658
01:41:58,653 --> 01:42:00,348
Why did you put him in this car's trunk?

1659
01:42:00,622 --> 01:42:02,317
Wasn't it you, who asked
us to kidnap him?

1660
01:42:02,395 --> 01:42:03,229
So we kidnapped him..

1661
01:42:03,255 --> 01:42:05,885
We didn't know where to lock him up.
So we locked him up here.

1662
01:42:07,893 --> 01:42:09,478
What if I don't agree?

1663
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:11,812
Isn't the gun in my hand?

1664
01:42:12,046 --> 01:42:14,406
6 bullets, I'll plant it on
your head and walk away.

1665
01:42:21,994 --> 01:42:23,095
He is Rawther's man.

1666
01:42:23,376 --> 01:42:25,634
Remember he was the spy amongst
us and you ordered to kill him.

1667
01:42:25,659 --> 01:42:26,711
Ramalingam?

1668
01:42:26,756 --> 01:42:27,780
Not much...

1669
01:42:28,163 --> 01:42:29,881
Whatever happens at
Rawther's house...

1670
01:42:30,202 --> 01:42:33,545
...just guarantee the 3 of us our lives.
That's it.

1671
01:42:36,102 --> 01:42:37,653
Fine. Let's move.

1672
01:42:44,634 --> 01:42:46,071
If I happen to see you again...

1673
01:42:46,385 --> 01:42:47,111
I'll slit you.

1674
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:47,915
Now run.

1675
01:42:58,317 --> 01:42:59,278
- Chief.
- Tell me.

1676
01:42:59,537 --> 01:43:01,443
I've nabbed those guys and the pink car.

1677
01:43:03,503 --> 01:43:04,269
Well done!

1678
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,449
- How did you do it?
- They tried to escape.

1679
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,527
It was an heavy chase.

1680
01:43:09,417 --> 01:43:10,805
But finally caught them.

1681
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:14,423
You are one among my men
who makes me happy!

1682
01:43:14,977 --> 01:43:16,423
Come on chief.

1683
01:43:16,586 --> 01:43:17,644
It's my duty.

1684
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:19,059
Ok now come.

1685
01:43:19,154 --> 01:43:20,458
Ok chief. I'll be there.

1686
01:43:21,085 --> 01:43:21,747
Starting now.

1687
01:43:24,787 --> 01:43:25,364
Let's start.

1688
01:43:28,192 --> 01:43:29,840
Wow! There comes out the Mouse!

1689
01:43:30,995 --> 01:43:32,995
It's been long since I used it.

1690
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:45,894
Listen Deiva...

1691
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,316
your fellows...

1692
01:43:47,952 --> 01:43:48,677
The 3 of them.

1693
01:43:49,773 --> 01:43:52,645
They tried to escape from my men.
But my men are masters!

1694
01:43:53,834 --> 01:43:54,534
Got them.

1695
01:43:54,841 --> 01:43:56,088
The pink car is with me.

1696
01:43:56,113 --> 01:43:57,417
The solution too is with me.

1697
01:43:57,608 --> 01:43:58,417
Do one thing...

1698
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:01,017
Go back to your home.

1699
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:02,477
Rawther...

1700
01:44:02,722 --> 01:44:04,446
Don't step in without
knowing the depth.

1701
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:05,884
The pond is mine.

1702
01:44:06,252 --> 01:44:07,657
I know it's depth...

1703
01:44:07,682 --> 01:44:09,015
and pretty much know
where to step in.

1704
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:09,729
Rawther.

1705
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:12,570
As proposed, I'll meet you.

1706
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:14,755
For the sake of old times...

1707
01:44:15,243 --> 01:44:16,029
Let's talk.

1708
01:44:17,521 --> 01:44:17,971
Let's talk.

1709
01:44:35,004 --> 01:44:35,823
Stop!

1710
01:44:37,706 --> 01:44:38,796
Bring them.

1711
01:44:40,509 --> 01:44:41,519
Chief, but how?

1712
01:44:41,544 --> 01:44:42,638
Now we are at Madras.

1713
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:46,226
Even at a good speed, it'll take
6 hours for us to reach Andhra.

1714
01:44:46,672 --> 01:44:48,185
It's already 3.

1715
01:44:48,264 --> 01:44:50,709
As per Marundhu, the meeting
with the Chinese is at 6

1716
01:44:51,072 --> 01:44:52,288
Dear...

1717
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:55,489
Don't you teach me
time management.

1718
01:45:01,405 --> 01:45:02,895
Ramalingam?

1719
01:45:03,356 --> 01:45:04,144
He has...

1720
01:45:04,871 --> 01:45:06,215
...abducted our guys.

1721
01:45:07,286 --> 01:45:08,656
The car too is with him...

1722
01:45:09,294 --> 01:45:10,666
and so is the solution.

1723
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,510
I've no idea on how
to deal with him.

1724
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,917
At least this douche bag is
something I've against him.

1725
01:45:15,948 --> 01:45:17,026
Will Rawther agree?

1726
01:45:17,075 --> 01:45:17,901
He must!

1727
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,432
Or else he must perish.

1728
01:45:22,097 --> 01:45:23,495
Stop at some garment shop.

1729
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:26,871
We'll get him some
decent clothes to wear.

1730
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:30,026
Stay there.

1731
01:45:31,576 --> 01:45:32,181
I said stay.

1732
01:45:32,214 --> 01:45:33,206
Don't run.

1733
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,250
Juk!

1734
01:45:44,106 --> 01:45:45,183
Dear...

1735
01:45:45,778 --> 01:45:46,965
my dear son.

1736
01:45:47,528 --> 01:45:48,605
Hope you are fine?

1737
01:45:49,527 --> 01:45:52,895
I have a small wish...

1738
01:45:53,316 --> 01:45:54,324
Will you fulfill it?

1739
01:46:14,486 --> 01:46:15,103
Doctor...

1740
01:46:16,577 --> 01:46:18,156
Hope Sendhan is alive.

1741
01:46:18,671 --> 01:46:20,642
- Sendhan...
- It's a mild cerebral concussion.

1742
01:46:20,789 --> 01:46:21,755
Nothing major.

1743
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:25,610
He fainted out of shock.
Let him rest for a while.

1744
01:46:26,816 --> 01:46:27,777
Your name?

1745
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:30,874
- Se..Se..Sendhan.
- Mr. Sendhan you are at the wrong place.

1746
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:32,209
He'll be back to his
senses in sometime.

1747
01:46:32,492 --> 01:46:33,273
Nothing to worry.

1748
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:34,779
Rawther.

1749
01:46:35,382 --> 01:46:37,382
Business should always be justified.

1750
01:46:37,717 --> 01:46:41,366
- Is it correct to hold my stuff against me?
- Sendhan, the petrol silo security.

1751
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:42,450
Why so Deiva?

1752
01:46:42,925 --> 01:46:46,776
- If he wakes up we are done.
- When your man took everything and fled with the heroine,

1753
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:50,453
He took the money along with the car...

1754
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:52,261
What happened to your
justification then?

1755
01:46:52,954 --> 01:46:54,954
That's something I
was unaware of.

1756
01:46:55,143 --> 01:46:58,174
So consider this happened
without my knowledge.

1757
01:47:02,148 --> 01:47:04,130
In the war between
Deiva and Rawther...

1758
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,607
What if Rawther dies?

1759
01:47:06,739 --> 01:47:08,739
Deiva will avoid all the risk and...

1760
01:47:09,029 --> 01:47:11,007
take the car and head
straight to meet the Chinese.

1761
01:47:11,974 --> 01:47:13,974
We'll escape.

1762
01:47:14,426 --> 01:47:16,931
We'll get out of all
this mess and head back.

1763
01:47:17,356 --> 01:47:18,215
That's the "Dot"

1764
01:47:18,715 --> 01:47:20,715
My entire wealth depends
on the Gas Silo.

1765
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:22,259
That too exploded today.

1766
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:25,672
And I still have no
idea how it happened.

1767
01:47:31,003 --> 01:47:33,512
 Rawther, let's avoid
any problem between us.

1768
01:47:34,525 --> 01:47:35,878
I'll move out of this business.

1769
01:47:36,327 --> 01:47:37,529
Give me 50 percent.

1770
01:47:38,475 --> 01:47:40,280
I'll mind my own
business and walk away.

1771
01:47:42,037 --> 01:47:44,230
What if Rawther and
Deiva join hands?

1772
01:47:44,644 --> 01:47:45,308
What then?

1773
01:47:46,441 --> 01:47:47,285
That won't happen.

1774
01:47:48,496 --> 01:47:49,394
I'll ensure that.

1775
01:47:50,316 --> 01:47:51,644
You took good care of the situation!

1776
01:47:52,237 --> 01:47:53,229
Terrific!

1777
01:47:53,555 --> 01:47:54,072
Look there

1778
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:55,743
Your spy, Ramalingam.

1779
01:47:55,903 --> 01:47:56,989
I didn't harm him at all.

1780
01:47:57,389 --> 01:47:58,504
Why don't you ask him.

1781
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:00,079
He'll let you know.

1782
01:48:00,589 --> 01:48:01,463
Tell him Ramalingam.

1783
01:48:01,839 --> 01:48:02,502
Won't you?

1784
01:48:02,758 --> 01:48:03,774
Get lost!

1785
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:05,895
Oh my!

1786
01:48:06,267 --> 01:48:08,194
Rawther, these 2 goons here...

1787
01:48:08,402 --> 01:48:10,707
They tied me up and dumped
me in the car trunk.

1788
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:12,536
They tortured me for 4 days.

1789
01:48:13,356 --> 01:48:14,535
What's all this Deiva?

1790
01:48:14,817 --> 01:48:16,137
So what's the solution?

1791
01:48:16,502 --> 01:48:18,337
That was unexpected!

1792
01:48:18,362 --> 01:48:21,318
Don't you worry. Deiva will
take care of everything.

1793
01:48:21,735 --> 01:48:24,782
Don't underestimate Rawther. He
is even more dreadful than Deiva.

1794
01:48:25,136 --> 01:48:26,721
Do you see that skeleton?

1795
01:48:27,844 --> 01:48:28,769
Yes I do.

1796
01:48:28,929 --> 01:48:33,826
- Rawther is a monster, he'll
skin you alive... - Wait..

1797
01:48:33,944 --> 01:48:36,694
and hang you up!

1798
01:48:38,504 --> 01:48:42,318
I guess he tattoos his victims'
name and number on their skeleton.

1799
01:48:42,381 --> 01:48:46,429
- Fool, that's victim's own tattoo.
- Is it?

1800
01:48:46,673 --> 01:48:48,051
Yes.

1801
01:48:50,512 --> 01:48:52,621
Do you want to negotiate or not?

1802
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:53,690
We shall.

1803
01:48:54,575 --> 01:48:57,434
To begin with, ask your
men to fall at my feet.

1804
01:48:57,973 --> 01:48:58,973
Rawther!

1805
01:48:59,445 --> 01:49:00,445
You know it well.

1806
01:49:01,145 --> 01:49:03,096
Making my men fall
at one's feet...

1807
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,286
...is the same as I doing it.

1808
01:49:05,312 --> 01:49:05,831
I know.

1809
01:49:06,567 --> 01:49:07,668
Let's come to that later.

1810
01:49:08,528 --> 01:49:10,107
Do you have any other option?

1811
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:18,601
Attention everyone. Who would
like to see Deiva dead?

1812
01:49:18,692 --> 01:49:19,596
Raise your hands.

1813
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,680
See for yourself.

1814
01:49:29,983 --> 01:49:30,983
Look at them.

1815
01:49:31,294 --> 01:49:32,066
Pai?

1816
01:49:35,389 --> 01:49:36,040
You too?

1817
01:49:53,093 --> 01:49:54,421
What did you say?

1818
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:58,096
Later, you'll make
me fall at you feet?

1819
01:49:58,304 --> 01:49:59,051
Why not?

1820
01:49:59,522 --> 01:50:00,552
Will you disdain?

1821
01:50:01,581 --> 01:50:02,967
"Deiva has a reputation"

1822
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:04,532
"and will not fall at my feet"

1823
01:50:04,711 --> 01:50:05,711
Isn't it?

1824
01:50:06,853 --> 01:50:08,692
Do you want half of
the share or not?

1825
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:11,086
I'm offering you alms.

1826
01:50:12,259 --> 01:50:13,554
Deiva of course...

1827
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:14,660
...has a reputation.

1828
01:50:15,276 --> 01:50:16,276
And it is...

1829
01:50:16,745 --> 01:50:18,477
...hard earned.

1830
01:50:18,692 --> 01:50:19,692
A genuine one.

1831
01:50:20,555 --> 01:50:21,555
But.. 'Rawther'?

1832
01:50:22,551 --> 01:50:23,551
'Rolex' Rawther!

1833
01:50:29,254 --> 01:50:30,254
Brother...

1834
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:32,383
Your boss is gesturing.

1835
01:50:33,381 --> 01:50:35,819
Grasp it and act accordingly.

1836
01:50:39,139 --> 01:50:40,637
I gifted you the watch.

1837
01:50:41,436 --> 01:50:42,885
Hence the tag name.

1838
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:44,470
Can you guess what it is?

1839
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:48,987
Until now you aren't
aware of a fact.

1840
01:50:50,232 --> 01:50:51,961
So you see Rawther?

1841
01:50:53,017 --> 01:50:54,173
The fact that the watch...

1842
01:50:55,662 --> 01:50:56,662
Next to him..

1843
01:50:58,092 --> 01:50:59,287
Isn't the original  'Rolex'.

1844
01:51:00,449 --> 01:51:02,451
It's from an imposter
company called 'Roxel'.

1845
01:51:08,837 --> 01:51:10,244
Can you see a jar of ants?

1846
01:51:12,782 --> 01:51:14,160
All your reputation...

1847
01:51:15,108 --> 01:51:16,753
The ant jar..

1848
01:51:17,077 --> 01:51:18,077
..is one big...

1849
01:51:19,163 --> 01:51:21,153
LIE

1850
01:51:22,879 --> 01:51:23,879
Kaali...

1851
01:51:24,437 --> 01:51:25,863
...is ordering you
to shoot it.

1852
01:51:45,696 --> 01:51:48,009
I meant, fall at his feet!

1853
01:54:35,837 --> 01:54:37,869
Who are you and why
are you attacking me?

1854
01:54:38,223 --> 01:54:39,223
Don't you remember us.
We burst...

1855
01:54:39,368 --> 01:54:40,960
Shut up.!

1856
01:54:43,494 --> 01:54:44,494
Don't you recognize me?

1857
01:54:44,721 --> 01:54:45,721
No.

1858
01:54:48,838 --> 01:54:51,349
The rest of of your life...

1859
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:53,042
...is my alms to you.

1860
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:17,746
Move.

1861
01:55:24,644 --> 01:55:25,644
You rat!

1862
01:55:27,923 --> 01:55:29,795
You are a rare blue rat!

1863
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
One word.

1864
01:55:32,717 --> 01:55:34,039
Answer me in one single word.

1865
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,782
Why shouldn't I burst open
your head with this bullet?

1866
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:39,562
We have got the
ant-repellent powder.

1867
01:55:42,309 --> 01:55:43,309
Answer me.

1868
01:55:44,728 --> 01:55:45,728
I saw.

1869
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,893
When they tried shooting Rawther...

1870
01:55:56,476 --> 01:55:57,721
...he diverted their attention.

1871
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:01,089
Is it?

1872
01:56:03,303 --> 01:56:05,516
Guna, come here.

1873
01:56:05,869 --> 01:56:06,921
Lift me.

1874
01:56:18,386 --> 01:56:20,141
We are even now.

1875
01:56:32,369 --> 01:56:33,239
Ok, I understand the dot.

1876
01:56:34,478 --> 01:56:35,277
Comma?

1877
01:56:36,876 --> 01:56:37,876
Here, you rat.

1878
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:40,100
Where are you going?

1879
01:56:41,848 --> 01:56:43,251
We are done with our tasks.

1880
01:56:44,082 --> 01:56:45,082
You got the car.

1881
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:46,965
We are obsolete.

1882
01:56:47,598 --> 01:56:49,112
Why did you steal cocaine from me?

1883
01:56:49,965 --> 01:56:51,306
Forget about them.

1884
01:56:51,676 --> 01:56:54,007
He stole cocaine, Rawther.

1885
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:56,350
Why did you steal?

1886
01:56:57,723 --> 01:56:58,723
In case..

1887
01:56:58,933 --> 01:56:59,933
Our misfortune..

1888
01:57:00,536 --> 01:57:02,406
- If we mess it up.
- What if we do?

1889
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:04,689
That was for Narasimhan.

1890
01:57:05,858 --> 01:57:06,987
Narasimhan..

1891
01:57:08,113 --> 01:57:09,363
You can confirm with Marundhu..

1892
01:57:09,554 --> 01:57:10,687
Marundhu?

1893
01:57:13,193 --> 01:57:15,203
Narasimhan will take
any risk for cocaine.

1894
01:57:16,343 --> 01:57:18,233
He was already dead by then.

1895
01:57:18,708 --> 01:57:19,985
Why did you steal after that?

1896
01:57:20,548 --> 01:57:22,350
We panicked and
became clueless.

1897
01:57:28,286 --> 01:57:29,915
How dare you try cheating me?

1898
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,576
These fellows will come with us.

1899
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:34,985
Jung...

1900
01:57:35,367 --> 01:57:38,249
What if we are back to square one
and have to meet the Chinese?

1901
01:57:39,173 --> 01:57:40,680
So, comma denotes this?

1902
01:57:42,856 --> 01:57:45,156
I'll have an eye on them.

1903
01:57:50,661 --> 01:57:52,811
I thought these three
denoted the ways to escape.

1904
01:57:52,896 --> 01:57:55,064
If plan A(dot) fails,
we are gone.

1905
01:57:57,163 --> 01:58:00,254
Attack, the Chinese
deal is very important.

1906
01:58:00,671 --> 01:58:03,302
There shouldn't be
any room for errors.

1907
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:06,124
Fetch everything that
is necessary for it.

1908
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:11,331
This one is called "The Disguise"

1909
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:13,203
This is 'Super Star'.

1910
01:58:13,242 --> 01:58:14,242
Once triggered

1911
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,337
...it'll fire up the whole place.

1912
01:58:19,813 --> 01:58:20,813
This is called "The Hand"

1913
01:58:21,291 --> 01:58:23,757
Until your hands are strong the bullets
will keep coming. It won't cease.

1914
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:26,426
4000 years ago..

1915
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:28,374
Irrespective of
geographical barriers..

1916
01:58:28,962 --> 01:58:30,694
Even if a battalion of
40 millions attack..

1917
01:58:31,548 --> 01:58:35,129
They would have been
done and dusted.

1918
01:58:36,278 --> 01:58:37,412
Battle of Mahabharata..

1919
01:58:37,628 --> 01:58:39,280
Would have been just 4 lines.

1920
01:58:40,348 --> 01:58:42,730
If I were alive in
the dinosaur era

1921
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:44,334
The reason for it's extinction

1922
01:58:44,415 --> 01:58:45,575
...would've been me.

1923
01:58:47,051 --> 01:58:51,770
It is named "Cyclo- Trampoline"

1924
01:58:51,949 --> 01:58:53,025
But I call it...

1925
01:58:55,214 --> 01:58:56,162
"Wife"

1926
01:59:07,486 --> 01:59:09,156
Are you blaming me
for everything?

1927
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:10,824
Yes, indeed.

1928
01:59:11,886 --> 01:59:12,886
Don't you...

1929
01:59:13,084 --> 01:59:14,084
I will smash your face.

1930
01:59:14,394 --> 01:59:16,052
Try doing that and
I'll finish you off!

1931
01:59:16,495 --> 01:59:18,619
Finish me off? Get
lost you Moron!

1932
01:59:18,764 --> 01:59:19,940
How dare you?

1933
01:59:21,123 --> 01:59:22,483
I could have been free by now.

1934
01:59:23,419 --> 01:59:24,561
You are to be blamed.

1935
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,405
- Now, the only place left to go is hell!
- Stop it.

1936
01:59:29,192 --> 01:59:30,192
Amateurs!

1937
01:59:31,783 --> 01:59:32,593
Get into the car.

1938
01:59:32,681 --> 01:59:33,681
Guna.

1939
01:59:34,381 --> 01:59:35,135
I'm coming.

1940
01:59:47,137 --> 01:59:48,591
I'm very sure.

1941
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:51,053
This is not the car that I made.

1942
01:59:52,355 --> 01:59:55,255
How much time would it take for
me to disclose it to Rawther?

1943
01:59:58,237 --> 01:59:59,237
10 seconds?

1944
02:00:00,253 --> 02:00:01,753
You will be dead by the 11th second.

1945
02:00:02,807 --> 02:00:04,380
- Is that fine?
- Why?

1946
02:00:07,093 --> 02:00:08,093
Forget Rawther.

1947
02:00:08,467 --> 02:00:09,489
Chinese?

1948
02:00:09,763 --> 02:00:11,239
They are heavily armed.

1949
02:00:11,973 --> 02:00:13,933
If they find out that
the stuff is missing?

1950
02:00:14,438 --> 02:00:16,470
Their bullets will pierce
every part of your body.

1951
02:00:18,663 --> 02:00:19,663
Even ears?

1952
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:24,881
Belly button?

1953
02:00:38,029 --> 02:00:40,383
We are marching towards
death and you laugh!!

1954
02:00:42,025 --> 02:00:43,540
Death..

1955
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:46,619
...is not a guest Marundhu.

1956
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:50,762
He's a thief.

1957
02:00:51,873 --> 02:00:54,381
He is an exclamatory mark.

1958
02:01:04,061 --> 02:01:06,242
Element of surprise!

1959
02:01:13,768 --> 02:01:14,768
My son!

1960
02:01:18,307 --> 02:01:19,974
Daddy!

1961
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:21,711
I'm here, son.

1962
02:01:54,468 --> 02:01:55,468
Rawther!

1963
02:01:56,152 --> 02:01:57,667
Hope you've said
your final prayers.

1964
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,890
What now?

1965
02:02:06,661 --> 02:02:07,661
Fight.

1966
02:02:30,496 --> 02:02:33,215
Off late, carrying a gun along
seems to be the trend!

1967
02:02:34,326 --> 02:02:35,430
I've no idea...

1968
02:02:45,356 --> 02:02:46,790
Sorry, grandpa.

1969
02:02:53,733 --> 02:02:54,733
Run!

1970
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:24,335
- What are you doing, Jung?
- For one last time..

1971
02:03:26,312 --> 02:03:28,341
Not yet Jung!

1972
02:03:32,265 --> 02:03:33,265
Round them up.

1973
02:03:55,741 --> 02:03:56,741
7 o' clock.

1974
02:04:05,128 --> 02:04:06,508
Jill!

1975
02:04:08,645 --> 02:04:10,211
Two!

1976
02:04:18,999 --> 02:04:21,937
Eleven!

1977
02:04:31,566 --> 02:04:33,081
Five!

1978
02:04:40,792 --> 02:04:42,079
Six

1979
02:04:50,019 --> 02:04:51,019
No!

1980
02:05:23,485 --> 02:05:24,485
You rat!

1981
02:05:26,017 --> 02:05:27,517
Running out of bullets?

1982
02:05:31,618 --> 02:05:32,618
No,

1983
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,120
I have one left.

1984
02:05:34,473 --> 02:05:35,473
I did count.

1985
02:05:41,304 --> 02:05:42,081
Shoot!

1986
02:05:42,393 --> 02:05:43,393
You go first.

1987
02:05:45,331 --> 02:05:46,509
No. You go first.

1988
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:57,941
Over confident?

1989
02:06:04,219 --> 02:06:06,335
How dare you insult my wife?

1990
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:08,540
Your wife

1991
02:06:09,043 --> 02:06:10,507
won't cross her limits.

1992
02:06:12,889 --> 02:06:13,562
Come on.

1993
02:06:34,384 --> 02:06:35,017
Fire

1994
02:06:42,935 --> 02:06:47,096
" To complete a daunting task don't
hesitate to take care of petty tasks "

1995
02:07:00,893 --> 02:07:02,028
I could have been free by now.

1996
02:07:06,604 --> 02:07:07,842
Let's quit.

1997
02:07:07,962 --> 02:07:08,962
Let's abscond.

1998
02:07:09,467 --> 02:07:11,209
Don't be like the rabbit in the race.

1999
02:07:18,389 --> 02:07:20,656
Be the rabbit that appears
from the magician's hat.

2000
02:07:24,065 --> 02:07:25,982
Element of..

2001
02:07:29,416 --> 02:07:30,416
Surprise!

2002
02:07:40,370 --> 02:07:41,370
I'm here, son.

2003
02:07:56,526 --> 02:07:58,198
I did warn you, Attack.

2004
02:07:58,761 --> 02:07:59,761
I have one, left.

2005
02:08:36,219 --> 02:08:40,333
These guys never
turn up on time!

2006
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:44,982
Slipper me if I do
business with them again.

2007
02:08:45,712 --> 02:08:48,006
I'll do it on your face!

2008
02:08:54,848 --> 02:08:56,821
Pasupathi, start the vehicle.
