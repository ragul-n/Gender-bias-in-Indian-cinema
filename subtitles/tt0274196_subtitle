1
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:50,532
Hey Bholaram, why don't you polish?
- But where should I polish?

2
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:54,106
My face. Take these
shoes and hurry up.

3
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:59,511
Dada, please repair my shoe.
- Give. I'll repair it.

4
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,152
What's wrong Chandu?
- Nothing, a nail had come out.

5
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,854
Which standard do you study in?
- First - English medium. And you?

6
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,196
I left studies after the fourth standard
- Hindi medium.

7
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,828
Why did you leave your studies?
- Just like that.

8
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:27,805
How could I have supported his studies?
They too have become so very...

9
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,070
...expensive along with other things
in the world.

10
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:34,747
Take Babuji.

11
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:41,150
Did you see beti: He paid for polishing
a single shoe instead of the pair?

12
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,222
Take, the shoe is ready.

13
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,863
Shambhu Dada, give him four paise.

14
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,938
Vidya, four paise for putting one nail?
One is enough.

15
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,934
Everything in the world has become
expensive. Give him four paise.

16
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,538
Have the studies become
less expensive now?

17
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,751
Why not? If I have customers like this
child, studies will become affordable.

18
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,421
Now will you support his studies?
- Yes, but you will have to come

19
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,014
Qeveryday to get your shoe repaired.

20
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:22,854
Take these four paise.
- No, beti, I was just joking.

21
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,290
Take. Eat some sweets from my side.

22
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:31,605
Hey, why did you take the money back?
Give it to me. - Take.

23
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:35,071
Take it please.

24
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,416
What a sweet child she is.

25
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,922
Praise the Lord. God,
this cobbler has thought of...

26
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:04,268
getting his son educated so that
he becomes somebody in life.

27
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:09,734
I have spoken too much.
It is not me but you who will educate him.

28
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:15,007
God, please make Chandu such
a person that he can also be among

29
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:22,285
the elite and reputed.
This is my only prayer.

30
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,233
Hey, so you didn't learn your lesson?
- Sir, I'll definitely learn it tomorrow.

31
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:40,597
You will learn it tomorrow. You naughty
fellow! - Namaste Sir. - Namaste

32
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:56,020
Chandrashekhar, father's name Bhola,
caste Hindu. Are you Bhola's son?

33
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:06,991
Where is Bhola? - Sir, Chandu is like
your own son. I trust him to you. Bye.

34
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:16,567
Chandu is a cobbler's son.
Chandu, go and sit there.

35
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:50,736
Babuji, Chandu has gone to an English
medium school for the first time.

36
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,604
That is very good, Bholaram.
What is your name, son?

37
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:59,343
Chandu. - Chandu? Very good.
Till where will you study?

38
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:07,153
From A to Z. - From A to Z? Very good.
Keep it up my son. I'll give you a reward.

39
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:20,635
This is a book and this is an organ.
A book to read and an organ to play.

40
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:25,744
One should study when it's time to study and
play when it's time to play.

41
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:39,492
Bholaram, your son appears to be very intelligent.
Educate him well.

42
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,153
We need your blessings and good wishes, Babuji.

43
00:07:53,842 --> 00:08:00,975
Bhabhi. - So you have come Bhaiya?
Why are you so late?

44
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:08,615
I'll tell you. Where is Vidya? Vidya, beti.
- Chachaji. Chachaji has come.

45
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,191
Come, my child, I've brought some sweets for you.

46
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:21,762
Mom has already fed me.
- She must have given you food, not sweets.

47
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:26,398
Come on you eat. - Do you think I won't eat?

48
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:30,639
Bhabhi, I'm so hungry today that
you will get tired of feeding me.

49
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:37,474
Don't joke, Bhaiya.
Shambhu Dada, give her water and put her to sleep.

50
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,446
Will this butterfly sleep now? - Butterfly?

51
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,956
What else? The moment you called her name
she flew away like a butterfly.

52
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,992
Come Bhaiya eat your food now.

53
00:08:56,104 --> 00:09:02,532
Bhabhi, hasn't brother come as yet?
- No must have been held up with some work.

54
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:15,252
- Okay, I lose. Take this and enjoy.
I'll move now.

55
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,014
Why are you blocking my way? Move aside!

56
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:44,956
Vidya's Babuji? - Why are you still awake?
Why have you not slept as yet?

57
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:47,762
Shall I bring food for you in the room?

58
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:54,637
I have already eaten.
I have repeatedly told you not to wait for me.

59
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:34,909
Bholaram, your son appears to be very intelligent.
Educate him well.

60
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,431
Who played the organ? Tell me who played it?

61
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,874
Sir, Chandu blew the organ.

62
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:10,148
Do you come here to study or play the organ?
Why don't you speak?

63
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:15,255
No Sir, Chandu did not play the organ.
It was Harish.

64
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,901
Will you eat, Vidya?
- No. Yeah, you will eat with that cobbler.

65
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,213
Yes, I'll eat with him. Why are you bothered?

66
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:46,352
What are you eating, Chandu? - Grams.

67
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:52,182
Won't you share it with me? - Will you eat my grams?

68
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,185
But will you share my sweets?

69
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,209
Are you blind? - No, you are blind.

70
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:28,555
Hey, leave him!

71
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:37,196
Sir, I am telling the truth I am innocent.
- Innocent? You have hurt

72
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:39,738
...him badly and you still say
that you are innocent?

73
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,238
You rascal, you must have definitely beaten him.
Put your hand forward.

74
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:47,073
No Sir, I was there. Chandu is innocent.

75
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:51,775
You shut up!
Will Raisaheb Bhagwandas' son ever lie?

76
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,752
So you have come here to study leaving
your shoe repair shop?

77
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:58,057
Put your hands forward!

78
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:14,765
Baba. - My son, try to sleep.
Everything will be fine by morning.

79
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:18,441
The poor always commit mistakes.

80
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,777
You made a mistake by beating Raisaheb's son.

81
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:26,578
But Baba, it was he who initiated the fight.
You can ask Vidya about it.

82
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:32,450
Yes. He can do whatever he likes because he is
the son of a rich person.

83
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:38,597
Can he even kill us?
I will not study in such a school.

84
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:45,804
I will not study in such a school, Maa.
Chandu was beaten badly by Sir.

85
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,705
He did not say anything to Harish,
though it was Harish's fault.

86
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,948
If Harish was at fault then why didn't you tell
Sir that Chandu was innocent?

87
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:59,645
You should have told him the truth.
- He asked me to shut up when I tried

88
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:03,747
...to tell him the truth.
Raisaheb's son will never lie.

89
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:10,255
Maa, is my father less influential
than Harish's father? Tell me!

90
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,426
You always tell me that my
Babuji is a very reputed man.

91
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,094
I'll definitely ask him when he comes home.

92
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,709
Maa, when will Babuji come home?
- He will come soon, Beti. Sleep now.

93
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,112
I will not be able to sleep until
Babuji comes home.

94
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:15,367
I see. So Sir beat Chandu very badly.
- But why?

95
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:20,914
He got into a fight with the
son of some Raisaheb Bhagwandas.

96
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:29,453
But Babuji, Chandu is not that sort.
- It's good that the sir beat Chandu.

97
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:36,293
What are you saying Babuji?
- Yes, Bholaram. He will not forget this...

98
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:41,560
Qthrashing for the rest of his life.
Sir has not beaten him but instead has

99
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,739
aroused an emotion in him that will
make him a great man someday.

100
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:51,569
Holaram, beware!
Affection for you son should not become an obstacle

101
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,242
in the path of your ideals.
- This will never happen, Babuji.

102
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,620
Very good!

103
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:57,302
Shambhu, pay the taxi driver outside.

104
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:07,017
Leave me.
- Brother, bhabhi has not eaten anything as yet.

105
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:11,724
Ometimes she doesn't eat for
eight days at a stretch. Be a little considerate.

106
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:20,657
I see, so you are also awake.
Who else will feel for Bhabhi but you?

107
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,903
Explain to her that she shouldn't wait for me.

108
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:34,946
Brother...Ram brother.
-Leave me, Bhabhi.

109
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,410
You also push me aside. Strangle me.
But as long as I'm alive I won't let you
say anything to him.

110
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:45,959
-Bhabhi.
I beg of you Ram Bhaiya go to sleep.

111
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,695
Please freshen up. The food is getting cold.
- I've already eaten.

112
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:52,822
I've heard that consumption of liquor
burns the liver.

113
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,889
How does it matter to you if my liver burns?

114
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:11,805
Get up, son. Won't you go to school?
- Namaste, Baba!

115
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:15,173
God bless you, my son. Have a bath
and get ready fast.

116
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:24,049
Baba? - Yes, my son? - Will Sir beat me again?

117
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:28,785
No, my child;
he is your guru, and gurus are very compassionate.

118
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,060
Come, Professor.

119
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:45,173
Hello Sir. - Hello. Is he Chandu's teacher? - Yes.

120
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,681
Professor, meet Mr. Ram Singh. M.A. D. Litt.

121
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:54,481
He is the President of the Education Board.
- Namaste, Sir.

122
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:58,016
Namaste. Please sit.

123
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:24,977
Master Sahib, you are very fit.
- Yes Sir. One has to take care.

124
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,522
Can I ask why you keep yourself so fit and healthy?

125
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:35,124
To protect the body.
- To protect the body? -Yes.

126
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,797
Or to show your strength on small
and delicate children?

127
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,460
Professor, knowledge should be bestowed with love, not force.

128
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:47,305
These children are the torchbearers of our country. They'll show the path...

129
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:51,172
...of knowledge to those who are
ignorant and suffering.

130
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,012
You thrashed Chandu only because
he is the son of a poor cobbler?

131
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:03,851
One should always remember that
all the students are equal.

132
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,723
Everybody should be same for the teacher.

133
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,266
Mr. Headmaster,
now the stick should be done away with in school.

134
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:19,335
People have trusted us with their dear wards
so that we can give them a

135
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,376
new and more meaningful life.
To inspire them and make them such...

136
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:27,206
beautiful people that when they go out
in the world people respect them.

137
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,377
Master Sahib,
Chandu is also one among those dear children.

138
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:38,917
I hope that you people have understood
what I wanted to say. Namaste.

139
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,660
Did you understand? 
-Yes.

140
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:10,085
You foolish person: Is knowledge kept under shoes?

141
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:16,789
The papers were flying because of the wind
that is why I kept the shoe on them.

142
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:19,633
Pick the shoe and put it to your forehead.

143
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,266
Hey, not the shoe, but the books!

144
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:33,037
Good, my son. Knowledge belongs to the mind
it's not to be kept under shoes.

145
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:36,313
I'll never repeat this mistake.
- Good! May God bless you.

146
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:39,351
Now go to sleep. You have to go to 
the school early in the morning.

147
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,179
Namaste Baba
-God bless you
-Namaste Maa.

148
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:54,666
Did you see that Chandu's Maa?
I asked Chandu to revere knowledge

149
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:59,262
...instead, he revered the shoe. 
He is so crazy.

150
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:05,207
Now he has revered knowledge,
he will surely become a great person one-day.

151
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:25,294
Why are you holding me like this?
Do you think I am drunk?

152
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:30,729
No, I think you are not feeling well.
- Hey, move away!

153
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:34,702
Brother.
- What's the matter?
- What is this, brother?

154
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:37,373
Why do you convert the house into hell
as soon as you enter?

155
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:41,004
What rubbish are you talking?
- I am not talking rubbish. I am stating a fact.

156
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:44,584
Please keep quiet, Ram Bhaiya.
- There's a limit to silence Bhabhi.

157
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,954
He will have to take a decision today.

158
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,452
What decision? Whose decision?

159
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:58,061
Bhabhi's decision: About Vidya,
and the entire house.

160
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,426
Ram Bhaiya, for God's sake
- Wait Bhabhi, I cannot tolerate this any more.

161
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:10,934
Ram Singh.
- Brother, can I ask where you are till 
2 o'clock every night?

162
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:15,948
Who are you to ask me this?
This is my house and I can come at any time.

163
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:20,353
It is regretful that you do not consider
this to be your house.

164
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:25,224
You come here late at night,
Bhabhi waits for you with the food

165
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:28,159
without eating or drinking anything herself.
And you, in your drunken...

166
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:31,925
state say any damn thing to her.
Did you ever ask her whether she has...

167
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:38,437
eaten anything or not?
Brother, this goddess puts up with

168
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,736
this trauma and insult for the whole night.

169
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,275
And you are restless the entire night
because your bed gets empty

170
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,974
the minute I return home.
- Brother!

171
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:52,750
You think that just because I drink
I can't see or understand anything?

172
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,580
I am aware of the love affair between
you and this goddess.

173
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,685
She's a whore!
- Swami!
Shut up!

174
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,618
- Bhabhi, please be silent.

175
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,833
He is so drowned in sin that he sees
his own reflection in everybody else.

176
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,899
He can't even distinguish between
a chaste woman and a whore.

177
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,173
Brother, had any other person spoken
such words for Bhabhi, I'd have...

178
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,577
What would you have done?
- I would have pulled his tongue out!

179
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,445
And I warn you not to use such language for Bhabhi.

180
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,586
She's like my mother.
- Mother?

181
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,389
You scoundrel, you're not my brother, but my enemy.

182
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,927
Get out of my house!
- Swami!
- Shut up!

183
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:51,635
I want peace.
- Peace? You'll never get it...

184
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:55,078
in the company of rogues, loafers and crooks.
You will get peace only at...

185
00:31:55,182 --> 00:32:01,746
the feet of this virtuous woman.
Bhabhi, I'll leave now.

186
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:07,386
Ram Bhaiya, will you leave Vidya and go?

187
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:20,298
Leave her and go to hell!

188
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,244
Where are you going, Chachaji?

189
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:28,544
To procure peace for your Babuji, my child.

190
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:53,128
Who's there?
- It's me, Ram Singh.

191
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,687
Welcome. Come in Babuji.

192
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,696
Be seated, Babuji.

193
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:28,064
Why do you work so late at night?
- To get Chandu educated.

194
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:32,438
I can work now,
who knows what will happen later?

195
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:41,351
Very good, Bholaram.
You are putting in so much effort in educating

196
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:48,854
Chandu. Your house is so peaceful.

197
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:02,535
Chandu's mother. I salute you Bholaram.

198
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:13,743
Babuji, you seem to be troubled;
what's the matter?

199
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:18,924
There has to be some reason for you to have
come to my house so late at night.

200
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:26,826
Please tell me.
- Bholaram, I...

201
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:30,960
I understand, Babuji.
Just wait for a minute.

202
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,411
Just wait for a minute.

203
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:57,194
Bholaram, what is this?
- Babuji, if you are hungry, then eat this

204
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:03,700
chutney and roti. And if you are in need
of money, then this poor

205
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:07,433
fellow is willing to sacrifice whatever
he has earned in his entire life.

206
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:13,039
And if anybody has insulted you,
then I'll break his head with this stick.

207
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:19,818
If I can't do even this much for you,
then the world should not have poor people.

208
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:29,124
Very good, Bholaram.
But neither am I hungry nor...

209
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:36,763
do I need money. And humiliation
cannot even touch a person who...

210
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,804
...has put his life in the service
of the poor and downtrodden.

211
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:50,249
I have already got what I wanted.
- Babuji, I have nothing but poverty.

212
00:35:53,020 --> 00:36:00,119
For the first time in my life I have
experienced sympathy, love and truth.

213
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:06,730
Bholaram, if the same resolve with which
you are educating Chandu becomes...

214
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:12,669
...the resolve of all our countrymen,
this nation will become a paradise.

215
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:19,110
Bholaram, I want to make my nation
paradise. I want to start...

216
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:22,010
...an organization whose
name will be Vidya Bhavan.

217
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,346
Do you know what will be in
Vidya Bhavan? It will have

218
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:32,618
...knowledge, wisdom, science,
and lovers of knowledge like you.

219
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:37,395
Bholaram, only with the cooperation of
people like you, can Vidya Bhavan...

220
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:39,895
...be started. Will you support me?

221
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,369
Babuji, I don't know anything else.
But I can sacrifice my life for you.

222
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:49,798
Very good Bholaram. Now Vidya Bhavan
will definitely materialize.

223
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:31,142
Ram Singh and Bholaram started spreading
the message of Reverend

224
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:35,244
...Mahatma Gandhi to each
and every house.

225
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:43,890
Children were given physical training so
that their lives don't get scattered.

226
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:47,994
Poor Vidya's mother passed her dark days
reading religious scriptures.

227
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:51,436
Her husband Hari Singh continued
considering the darkness to be light.

228
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:56,940
Vidya Bhavan was taking shape.
Ram Singh and Bholaram were full of hope.

229
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:03,813
Chandu and Vidya were also building the
foundations of their lives.

230
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,686
Vidya Bhavan got ready.

231
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:36,822
Vidya, do you know the end of this story?
You had started the story, now

232
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,957
you will end it.
- And what if it doesn't end?

233
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,267
Then your knowledge will
remain incomplete.

234
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,606
God, please see that Chandu's
education is completed.

235
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:53,904
Your Chandu has put in a lot of effort.
Please reward him.

236
00:41:55,515 --> 00:42:00,282
The results of his exams are coming
out today. It is not only his exams.

237
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:03,751
But also the test of an old
father's hopes.

238
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,863
His Roll No. Is ninety-six.
Please don't forget.

239
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:27,540
Oh, made in India! Absolutely Indian?
Wow, very good! What a piece!

240
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:34,183
Did you see? It's marvelous! Oh no
- this racket is too heavy.

241
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:36,222
My wrist has started aching.

242
00:42:37,257 --> 00:42:41,057
When God gives beauty,
delicacy comes automatically.

243
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:44,262
Take it, she finds it too heavy.
And Suman. Football.

244
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:49,298
Football? Rubbish! Okay Sir,
even this is not needed.

245
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,906
Newspaper: Free Press.
Times of India. Two annas.

246
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:05,545
Which do you want, Sir? Free Press?

247
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,348
Give me one fast.

248
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:19,393
Oh. Bhola Baba. It's me, Harish.
- Harish? Jai Hind!

249
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:22,299
Just check what has happened to
Ninety-six? - Ninety-six?

250
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:25,969
Chandu appeared for B.A. Exams.
- Yes, I am aware.

251
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:31,905
Ninety-six. Tell me. - Ninety-six.

252
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:39,347
Baba. Chandu has failed. Failed?
- Yes Baba.

253
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:46,087
No. This is not possible. Chandu
cannot fail. Just check it in this.

254
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:49,589
Just check. His number
might have appeared in this.

255
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:55,734
Both are alike, Baba. I feel really
sorry about Chandu's failure.

256
00:43:56,903 --> 00:44:00,464
After all, he's my childhood friend.
- Your childhood friend has failed.

257
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,605
But my entire world of hopes is ruined.

258
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:09,111
Baba, Chandu put in a lot of effort,
but that daughter of Hari Singh.

259
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:14,019
Vidya? What about her?
- She managed to pass, but Chandu

260
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:17,715
failed because of her. She passed?
This is good news!

261
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:24,387
But how did Chandu fail because of her?
- See Baba. I don't want to talk ill...

262
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:30,697
...about anyone. But being a friend of
Chandu, I would definitely say that

263
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:37,504
Vidya talks so sweetly that the other
person forgets his work & gets

264
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:43,405
smeared in the sweetness. Chandu studied a
lot he put in a lot of effort but...

265
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:49,079
forgot everything in front of Vidya's
innocent face. - Chandu is not like this.

266
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:53,989
Vidya is also a very nice girl.
This can't be the reason for his failure.

267
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:58,089
You should ask the reasons for failures
from those who have succeeded.

268
00:44:58,431 --> 00:45:05,098
Just look at me. I never ever think of girls,
that's why I passed easily.

269
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,633
Baba, where is Chandu?
- I don't know.

270
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:14,608
He must have gone to congratulate Vidya.

271
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,153
You will pass in the examination.
- What else, Mr. Astrologer?

272
00:45:28,328 --> 00:45:35,029
Should I tell you more? Your marriage.
You will get married

273
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:41,664
...to a person who loves you a lot.
- I don't like such talk.
- Okay.

274
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:50,213
I will inform that guy that the girls of
Vidya Bhavan don't like Love.

275
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:54,112
So he should not keep any hopes.
- Let him hope, Chandu.

276
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,821
Maybe this trash from Mr. Astrologer
turns out to be true.

277
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:03,294
Vidya, will we always keep
smiling all our lives?

278
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,031
Why not, Chandu?
 - Your father might want you to become...

279
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:12,093
...something after passing B.A.
Doctor, Lawyer, Professor?

280
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:15,066
I cannot become anybody without you.

281
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:18,500
You have already become somebody.
Just ask my heart.

282
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,338
What is the need to ask your heart?
I also know this.

283
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:25,907
What do you know?
- That I have grown up.

284
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,283
That is the just the problem that both of
us have grown up and are now in the

285
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:34,018
eyes of the world.
 - Neither me nor you can you close the...

286
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:38,063
...eyes of the world.
Let them be troubled. Why should we bother?

287
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:41,625
People remove and throw away
anything that enters the eye.

288
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,260
We are never going to get thrown out
of the eyes of the world.

289
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:49,234
The more they try the more
we will trouble them.

290
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,745
And just see. One day the world
will go blind.

291
00:46:53,413 --> 00:46:56,780
We have to open the eyes of the world,
Vidya. Babuji and Baba have made...

292
00:46:56,883 --> 00:47:00,216
Vidya Bhavan with the sole purpose of
spreading the light of knowledge to

293
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,288
...the entire world.

294
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:06,685
No doubt. It should glitter so much
that everybody's eyes close.

295
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,625
Nobody should be able to see anything,
and light should turn into darkness.

296
00:47:11,397 --> 00:47:14,730
Your eyes are always fond of darkness,
Harish Babu. Come.

297
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:19,030
Congratulations, Vidya!

298
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:22,630
For what?
 - Even if there's nothing, he has always...

299
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:25,176
...congratulated you ever since we were kids.

300
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:29,913
Vidya, we both have passed.
-But Chandu?

301
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:41,619
I have to state with great pain that our
childhood companion, our dear

302
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:45,425
friend Mr. Chandrashekhar,
who has always passed every examination

303
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:48,500
without a hitch; but in B.A...

304
00:47:48,601 --> 00:47:52,970
Why did you stop? Say it and soothe
your heartburn. Say that Chandu

305
00:47:53,072 --> 00:47:57,771
-I've failed?
- My heart comes to my mouth to say that Chandu has failed.

306
00:47:58,144 --> 00:48:04,777
This is impossible! The world and
I can fail, but not Chandu.

307
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:07,746
It's true. Chandu should never have failed.

308
00:48:08,654 --> 00:48:11,521
But don't worry,
examinations come every year.

309
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:30,707
Strange...you're consoling yourself with stones!

310
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:36,241
No. I am throwing away those stones
that are not worth consoling.

311
00:48:37,116 --> 00:48:40,415
I see. So you have thrown
us away just like these stones.

312
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:45,955
No, Rekha. You are like a rose flower.
Isn't it Leela?

313
00:48:46,192 --> 00:48:50,356
Rekha is telling the truth.
You promised her a party and disappeared.

314
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:56,459
Forget it. First tell me, when did you arrive?
- Today.

315
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:03,732
You invited Rekha, Suman & everybody else to
the party, but left me out.

316
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:12,050
No, Leela; your name is first on the list,
you will get your treat today

317
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:15,643
and the rest some other time.
-And what about our other friends?

318
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,790
Let them go to hell!

319
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:30,391
Chandu's mother. Chandu's education
remained incomplete. He has...

320
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,977
...failed for the first time. But it's my fault, I had once told him to pursue Vidya.

321
00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:47,416
His young eyes were deceived.
Instead of pursuing Vidya...

322
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:55,256
...he embraced her...And he failed.

323
00:49:55,728 --> 00:50:03,225
Baba, I have not failed I cannot fail.
- Everything that has happened...

324
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:10,105
is for the good, son.
Now you know the value of knowledge.

325
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:18,273
It is not an easy job to attain knowledge.
Even the moon has black spots.

326
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:33,665
I assure you that your
Chandu will never get stained.

327
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:37,259
He will not bring disgrace to
the name of Vidya Bhavan.

328
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:42,501
And if this ever happens, Chandu will
never show his face to anybody.

329
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:47,568
Will the son of a person who has always
kept his head high, even when

330
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,514
he's was cobbler by profession, hide
his face from the world?

331
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:56,948
Chandu, I had hoped that someday when
the name Bhola was called

332
00:50:57,056 --> 00:51:02,517
people would ask "which Bhola?" &
the reply would be

333
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:08,760
"Mr. Chandrashekhar's father Bholaram"
& you want to hide your face...

334
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:15,833
from the world? Will you ruin all
my hopes? If this happens, I will

335
00:51:15,975 --> 00:51:19,467
assume that there is no difference between
the sons of the rich and poor.

336
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:27,417
Baba, when you used to stitch shoes all
through the night, I used to feel like

337
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:34,517
those stitches were being put onto my heart.
Will I forget that?

338
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:41,028
You have done so much for me, gone
through so much. I will remain...

339
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:47,971
indebted to you for a million lives.
I know what is troubling you.

340
00:51:49,475 --> 00:51:53,878
But I have complete faith in myself.

341
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:57,207
After every night,
the dawn always arrives, my child.

342
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:04,111
This moon, which soothes the
entire world, is burning my heart.

343
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,926
The world will be on fire
if the sun rises, Maa.

344
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:24,042
Since years the moon has been emitting fire.
The sun has lit many fires.

345
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:32,614
But this world never got burnt.
Why are you troubling yourself, my child?

346
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,955
Bhola Baba's hopes are shattered Maa.
Chandu would be in real pain.

347
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,596
Must have been thinking that Vidya has
passed while he has failed.

348
00:52:45,731 --> 00:52:50,896
But mother, somebody should say that Chandu
has passed and Vidya has failed

349
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:55,497
Chandu's Vidya remained incomplete, Maa.

350
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:59,807
Everything will be all right, my child.
- Very good.

351
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:04,548
You are crying for somebody else's failures.

352
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:13,052
Namaste, Chachi! - God Bless you, son.
Jai Hind Vidya - Jai Hind.

353
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:19,191
How come you are here?
-Vidya has cleared her examination.

354
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:25,835
So I thought of giving her a present.
I have been searching jewellery shops...

355
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:29,396
...since morning & finally
I found this necklace for Vidya.

356
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,671
Isn't it good Chachi?
It is worth Rs.10000.

357
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:41,148
You keep the necklace with yourself.
Might be useful in time of your need.

358
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:47,890
If it isn't useful now then of what
use is it to me later?

359
00:53:49,495 --> 00:53:53,955
I mean when these actions of yours will
make you completely bankrupt.

360
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:58,093
Put the necklace in your own neck.
Say Jai Hind and get lost.

361
00:54:03,976 --> 00:54:09,175
Did you see Chachi? Shall I rip my heart
and prove myself to Vidya?

362
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:14,413
She never tries to understand me.
You should also try to understand her.

363
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:20,191
She is very upset over Chandu's failure.
I had advised him so many times.

364
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:26,231
...to study. But both of them used
to consider me to be a fool.

365
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:32,497
Anyway, it is good.
Both Vidya and I have passed.

366
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:36,339
Nobody becomes intelligent by
just passing an examination.

367
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:40,974
I know all your stupidities.
There is no use in pestering Maa.

368
00:55:00,232 --> 00:55:05,693
Vidya has passed.
-Vidya has passed? That's great.

369
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,009
Get her something good for this
achievement. It will make her happy.

370
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:17,938
What should I bring for her?
Okay I'll bring something very good for her.

371
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:21,051
Where is Vidya?
-She is still asleep.

372
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:26,082
Asleep? Till so late?
-She could not sleep the whole night.

373
00:55:26,592 --> 00:55:32,963
-Why?
She is very upset because Chandu has failed.

374
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:38,929
Chandu? Oh. That cobbler's son.
Vidya is so foolish.

375
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:41,670
Both of them get along very well.

376
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:48,109
Yes, the tea has a lot of sugar.
What were you saying? Get along well?

377
00:55:48,347 --> 00:55:51,316
Who get along well? You mother
and daughter have made me mad.

378
00:55:56,088 --> 00:56:00,752
It is getting awfully late.
I'll take your leave now.

379
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,893
Hey wait for some time.
It's a long time since we have met.

380
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:06,690
No. I have to go to the club.

381
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:13,500
We have still not discussed
important matters.

382
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:15,867
Important matters?
What do you mean?

383
00:56:17,743 --> 00:56:22,578
Wherever you are going,
you are going for some purpose.

384
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:26,677
Suppose I fulfill all your needs?

385
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:38,163
-But how?
Ms. Leela. You need a telescope of money to...

386
00:56:42,268 --> 00:56:49,970
...see the colors of the world. Suppose I
put that telescope on your eyes?

387
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:55,479
No. No obligation. I don't want
to get obliged to anybody.

388
00:56:56,115 --> 00:57:01,109
I also don't donate money to anybody.
I take work worth the money I give.

389
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:04,152
I have some work for you.

390
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:12,129
So you mean business. Want to make
a deal? Go ahead.

391
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:16,064
Say.

392
00:57:16,235 --> 00:57:20,433
You must have heard the name
of Vidya Bhavan? - Yeah.

393
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:27,067
You will have to stay there as an
assistant and get friendly to Chandu.

394
00:57:28,414 --> 00:57:33,408
You will have to separate Vidya and
Chandrashekhar from each other.

395
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:40,322
Very dirty work. - But this is a question
of life and death for me Ms. Leela.

396
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,951
If you wish you can save a person
from certain death.

397
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,748
This is just an advance.

398
00:58:20,866 --> 00:58:27,237
Maa. Maa. Chandu has passed in the
merit list. I am going to Vidya Bhavan.

399
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:30,439
Okay. Then bring Chandu along with you.

400
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:41,877
It is not in this Baba. Not there?
Just see it might be in this.

401
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:47,782
It is not even in this.
Not even here? Must be there in this.

402
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:50,921
Number ninety-six. Baba these are
all yesterday's papers.

403
00:58:58,237 --> 00:59:04,972
Baba. I have passed. You have passed?
Chandu has passed.

404
00:59:06,245 --> 00:59:09,737
I had full faith in God my son
that you will definitely pass.

405
00:59:10,916 --> 00:59:14,852
Chandu's mother.
Your Chandu has passed.

406
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:22,322
Your son has made us proud and is
asking for your blessings.

407
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:25,525
At least bless him.

408
00:59:28,534 --> 00:59:31,128
See this crazy girl has come.

409
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:36,340
Chandu, Baba, Chandu has passed.

410
00:59:36,642 --> 00:59:42,740
My child. Come Chandu. Come near me.
Embrace me or else I'll go mad.

411
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:50,113
Very good. Very good Bholaram.
Go mad. And in such a way that your...

412
00:59:50,222 --> 00:59:52,850
...madness should do away with
the entire nation's madness.

413
00:59:53,325 --> 00:59:56,055
Chachaji we have passed.
-May God bless you my child.

414
00:59:58,597 --> 01:00:01,862
And keep on bringing glory
to Vidya Bhavan.

415
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:06,964
Now the responsibility of Vidya Bhavan
would be on your young shoulders.

416
01:00:07,573 --> 01:00:10,838
Babuji you have made my old age.

417
01:00:11,743 --> 01:00:16,703
If you had not helped me, Vidya
Bhavan would not have materialized.

418
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:18,945
And the world would have forgotten
the name of Ram Singh.

419
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:27,315
Chachaji...
-What is the matter my child?
-Maa has called Chandu home.

420
01:00:29,895 --> 01:00:34,059
Bhabhi has called him home.
Then take him. Go Chandu.

421
01:00:35,067 --> 01:00:37,968
Beti, give my regards to Bhabhi.
-Okay.

422
01:00:45,911 --> 01:00:47,845
Congratulations Chandu Babu.
Congratulations Vidya Didi.

423
01:00:48,013 --> 01:00:51,676
Thanks. - Thanks.
- Bade Babu has arranged
for a lot of sweets for you all.

424
01:00:52,317 --> 01:00:54,649
Won't you eat them?
- We will eat from your hands.

425
01:00:55,154 --> 01:00:58,214
Okay. I will come in some time
and give sweets to everybody.

426
01:00:58,657 --> 01:01:01,421
All of you go to Bhola
Baba he will give you toys.

427
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,797
Congratulations Mr. Chandrashekhar.
Congratulations Ms. Vidya.

428
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:17,368
Thank you. Jai Hind Mataji.
- May God bless you. May you grow more.

429
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,978
Have a seat.

430
01:01:21,046 --> 01:01:24,573
Hey, you have passed but still
there is no treat or sweets for us?

431
01:01:25,117 --> 01:01:28,018
She has actually passed today.
Yesterday she had failed.

432
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:33,824
Hey. Just wait.
Let me put it in the plates.

433
01:01:34,393 --> 01:01:36,554
You bring the plates.
We will manage everything else.

434
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:47,097
Hey. Give some sweets to Chandu too.
- We have not stopped him.

435
01:01:47,673 --> 01:01:49,868
Here, Mr. Chandrashekhar.
B.A. Fail.

436
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:04,648
Take it back. Take this too.

437
01:02:07,926 --> 01:02:11,555
You finished all the sweets?
Didn't leave anything for Chandu?

438
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,931
I am enjoying their laughter
more than the sweets.

439
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:22,106
Hear this. - Hey Leave me.
- Maa ask them to leave me.

440
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:24,332
We can leave you only on one condition.

441
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,347
No. No way.

442
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:35,580
I don't want to say anything against
anybody Chachaji. But you know

443
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:40,181
...that while dying my father had
left my responsibility on your shoulders.

444
01:02:41,326 --> 01:02:46,491
What did you say? - What should I say.
You don't listen to anything.

445
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:51,067
You may go now.

446
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:59,874
Now say what you want to say.
- So what work have you decided to give me?

447
01:03:00,946 --> 01:03:03,710
So many times I have asked you to take up
the work of the landlords.

448
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:10,622
But you don't want to leave the city.
-Chachaji, if I leave the city, the house...

449
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:15,182
...will be burnt in a single day.
-Why? Why will the house be burnt?

450
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,553
What to tell you Chachaji? I have to play
with fire day and night.

451
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:24,425
Flames of fire have reached
my heart through my eyes.

452
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,498
You have now become poetic.
Why don't you talk clearly?

453
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,672
You know Chandu.
He is setting fire to our house.

454
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:34,072
I saw Vidya with him again today.
- And you were a mere spectator?

455
01:03:34,446 --> 01:03:36,414
Why didn't you shoot that rascal?

456
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:40,007
Why should I bother? Who am I to Vidya?
She is your daughter.

457
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:42,817
She can stay in Vidya Bhavan,
with Chandu or anybody else.

458
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:45,123
Why should I go and kill anybody?

459
01:03:45,257 --> 01:03:48,226
Where is that Cobbler's son?
Vidya has taken him home with her.

460
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,751
Taken him home? - Yes.

461
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:54,472
What is going on here?

462
01:06:55,113 --> 01:07:01,712
Chandu!
- Yes. Tell me.
- Tell me? Why have you come here?

463
01:07:02,354 --> 01:07:05,915
To meet Mataji and take her blessings.
-You are lying. Harish has told me everything.

464
01:07:06,057 --> 01:07:10,187
Harish is a liar Babuji.
He has simply misguided you.

465
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:14,195
Shut up you shameless girl.
You have brought disrepute to the family.

466
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:17,429
Chandu. I want to know from you.
Why have you come here?

467
01:07:18,637 --> 01:07:23,574
Why are you getting angry with him?
I had asked Chandu to come here.

468
01:07:23,942 --> 01:07:28,140
I see. So you too are also involved in this.
Wait, first let me deal with this cobbler's son.

469
01:07:28,246 --> 01:07:32,080
Don't get upset Babuji. I'll go.

470
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:37,682
I will never forget for the rest of my life that Mataji considered me to be her child.

471
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:40,157
I will make you forget that just now.

472
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:44,295
Babuji !
- Move away, you fool.

473
01:07:44,396 --> 01:07:50,824
Babuji. I am a student of Vidya Bhavan.
I know how to respond to an attack.

474
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,504
Keep the stick away. You are elder to me.

475
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:58,707
You rascal. You cobbler. Leave my house.
If ever I see you again...

476
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:01,608
...with this girl I will shoot you.

477
01:08:12,857 --> 01:08:16,850
Both of you understand properly.
You will have to live in this house itself.

478
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:19,553
If any of you try to go out,
I will cut your feet.

479
01:08:20,565 --> 01:08:24,331
Why do you want to lock her up in the house?
She is a guest just for a few days.

480
01:08:25,437 --> 01:08:29,271
Let her play and enjoy. If something happens, we won't be able to see her face.

481
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:34,244
You want her to go
around town with a cobbler's son?

482
01:08:34,946 --> 01:08:37,039
And the world makes a joke of me after
seeing all the drama?

483
01:08:37,482 --> 01:08:39,712
I will strangle her to death before
the world laughs at me.

484
01:08:40,952 --> 01:08:45,582
If you can stop the world from laughing just
by strangling me, then strangle me.

485
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:51,025
Why didn't you kill Vidya when she was born?
Why did you let her grow?

486
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:54,324
Shut up. I don't want to hear a single word.

487
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,866
It's your fate you want to live or die.

488
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:07,207
God will take care of everything. Don't cry.

489
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:17,411
Very good. Yes. Now tell me. How can
I help you?

490
01:09:18,723 --> 01:09:23,456
I have heard a lot about Vidya Bhavan.
I want to serve Vidya Bhavan.

491
01:09:24,663 --> 01:09:28,656
I want to dedicate my life to Vidya Bhavan.

492
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:33,230
Very good. What were you doing before this?

493
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:39,376
I was studying. I have passed my B.A. &
was planning to go to England.

494
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:44,939
But then thought of doing something
in India only. That is why I have...

495
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,248
Okay. Meet Mr. Chandrashekhar in this regard.

496
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:58,121
Sitaram, take her to Chandu Babu.

497
01:09:59,164 --> 01:10:02,031
Come. Jai Hind.

498
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:20,874
Have a seat. Tell me. How can I help you?

499
01:10:25,557 --> 01:10:27,718
Do you know Hindi?

500
01:10:29,994 --> 01:10:31,962
Then please speak in Hindi.

501
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:40,396
I am sorry. My name is Leela.
I want to serve Vidya Bhavan.

502
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:45,441
You will have to make a big sacrifice
if you want to serve.

503
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:55,743
I have already... I am sorry.
I have already sacrificed for Vidya Bhavan.

504
01:10:56,955 --> 01:11:00,550
I was going for my higher studies to England
after completing my B.A.

505
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:04,585
After hearing about this place,
I dropped the idea of going England.

506
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,233
You should have gone abroad.
Vidya Bhavan is not a foreign place.

507
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:15,806
No Mr. Chandrashekhar. Every child in the
town knows about the services

508
01:11:15,907 --> 01:11:20,742
...that Vidya Bhavan offers. A feeling
of service arouse in my heart.

509
01:11:21,012 --> 01:11:24,607
So I came here...
- You thoughts are beautiful...

510
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:28,885
...But your appearance is very dreadful.
- Dreadful?

511
01:11:33,558 --> 01:11:40,259
Yes. The red lipstick, this red nail paint
this glittering sari. No way.

512
01:11:42,467 --> 01:11:45,265
People who want to serve others
never appreciate such things.

513
01:11:57,982 --> 01:12:05,354
I am sorry. Again I spoke in English.
You will definitely like me tomorrow.

514
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:09,251
Then tomorrow?- Yes.
- The doors of Vidya Bhavan are...

515
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,227
...open for everybody all the time.
Jai Hind. - Jai Hind.

516
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:26,333
You want her to go around
town with a cobbler's son?

517
01:12:26,945 --> 01:12:28,913
And the world makes a joke of me
after seeing all the drama?

518
01:12:29,414 --> 01:12:33,748
I will strangle her to death before
the world laughs at me.

519
01:12:39,023 --> 01:12:40,991
Congratulations Chandu Babu.
Congratulations Vidya Didi.

520
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:44,817
Thanks. Bade Babu has arranged
for a lot of sweets for you.

521
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:47,790
Won't you eat?
- We will eat from your hands.

522
01:12:48,099 --> 01:12:51,296
Okay. I will come in some
time and give everybody sweets.

523
01:16:21,646 --> 01:16:23,614
Leela till where have you reached?

524
01:16:24,148 --> 01:16:27,311
Just near the moon.

525
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:38,784
Hey what are you doing Leela?
This red lipstick. This red nail polish.

526
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:48,468
This glittering sari. A big No. Won't work.
- You have to play the entire drama.

527
01:16:50,675 --> 01:16:57,137
If you play your part successfully,
then you'll send me to the mental asylum

528
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:06,681
Do you consider me to be dishonest?
You and dishonest? Never.

529
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:14,421
Suman used to praise you.
Urvashi liked your honesty so much that she

530
01:17:14,532 --> 01:17:19,492
rewarded herself with death.
And Rekha. - Shut up.

531
01:17:23,441 --> 01:17:27,775
See Leela, whosoever deceives me, I too...

532
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:33,340
Well said. Okay now take out some money.

533
01:17:33,885 --> 01:17:35,853
Money?

534
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:48,291
Hey I will envelop you with money.
Hey, what are you doing?

535
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:54,668
Vidya. Will we always keep smiling
throughout our lives?

536
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:58,900
Why not Chandu? Your father might
want you to become...

537
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:03,879
...something after passing B.A.
- I cannot become any body without you.

538
01:18:04,515 --> 01:18:07,245
You have already become some body.
Just ask my heart.

539
01:18:07,919 --> 01:18:11,184
What is the need to ask your heart?
I also know it.

540
01:18:11,422 --> 01:18:14,823
What do you know? That I have grown up.

541
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:19,389
That is the just the problem that both
of us have grown up and are now in the

542
01:18:19,497 --> 01:18:23,126
eyes of the world. Neither you nor
me can close the eyes of the world.

543
01:18:23,234 --> 01:18:26,965
Let them be troubled.
Why should we bother?

544
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:30,404
People remove and throw away anything
that enters the eye.

545
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:34,400
We are never going to get thrown out
of the eyes of the world.

546
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:38,446
The more they try the more
we will trouble them.

547
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:41,844
And just see. One day the world will go blind.

548
01:22:24,508 --> 01:22:27,443
Rest my child.

549
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:36,912
Vidya doesn't seem to be well Chachi.

550
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:41,816
Yes, she has a bad cough since many days.

551
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,186
It is not good to have a cough.
Have you given her any medicine?

552
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:50,366
Thanks for your concern. You don't worry.
I will take the medicine.

553
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:54,299
Don't speak Vidya. The cough gets more
intense with a lot of speaking.

554
01:22:54,939 --> 01:23:00,343
Yes. So whatever you want to say,
say it once and please go away.

555
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:07,383
Harish, for God's sake, please do
not talk to Vidya too much.

556
01:23:07,918 --> 01:23:13,686
Well, I had just come to see her.
Okay. I will go. - Go !!

557
01:23:23,234 --> 01:23:25,202
Shambhu?

558
01:23:35,246 --> 01:23:39,842
Why have you come here? Why don't you speak? You son of a rascal.

559
01:23:43,387 --> 01:23:50,884
Babuji, Vidya is very sick. Madam has called you home.

560
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:53,559
Then take the doctor with you.
- Won't you come?

561
01:23:53,998 --> 01:23:57,559
Didn't I say take the doctor with you.
Who'll give the medicine? Doctor or me?

562
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:11,704
Take this money. 
- I have money. I'll take the doctor.

563
01:24:12,016 --> 01:24:17,579
Hey, I am giving it to you fool.
- To me? I get my salary every month.

564
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:20,690
I don't need this money.

565
01:24:21,559 --> 01:24:24,392
Go to hell.

566
01:24:45,716 --> 01:24:47,684
He did not come?

567
01:24:49,086 --> 01:24:55,855
Maa where has Chandu gone? He was just
here next to me. Where has he gone?

568
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:01,691
Lie down my child. Doctor sahib has come.

569
01:25:14,445 --> 01:25:19,212
Chandu. You are still awake my son.
You have to get up early in the morning.

570
01:25:19,617 --> 01:25:24,611
I'll get up early Baba. - How will you
get up early if you don't sleep early?

571
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:34,557
Hey, you are watching the moon?
You will go crazy my son. Come.

572
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:50,511
See, you have already gone crazy.
Come. Sit here.

573
01:25:55,953 --> 01:26:01,721
See Chandu. That Laila Bai... Baba,
her name is Leela.

574
01:26:02,526 --> 01:26:07,725
Yes Leela. Babuji has thought that
she will teach those children whom...

575
01:26:07,831 --> 01:26:09,856
...Vidya used to teach.

576
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:12,697
She won't be able to teach those
children whom Vidya used to teach.

577
01:26:13,704 --> 01:26:18,437
Hey, if she can't she will learn
gradually. Now go and sleep.

578
01:26:20,177 --> 01:26:22,577
We will send somebody tomorrow
to get news about Vidya.

579
01:26:24,782 --> 01:26:30,880
Vidya's Babuji?
- What is the matter?

580
01:26:34,391 --> 01:26:38,452
Vidya's condition is deteriorating.
No medicine is suiting her.

581
01:26:38,696 --> 01:26:41,756
So what can I do?
Call some other doctor.

582
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,425
No doctor has the treatment for
the disease of the heart.

583
01:26:46,336 --> 01:26:49,464
Disease of the heart?
What do you want to say?

584
01:26:50,874 --> 01:26:56,278
Call Chandu. He will also see her.
Our daughter will be saved.

585
01:26:56,714 --> 01:27:01,344
This can never happen. Let Vidya die today
if she is to die tomorrow.

586
01:27:01,785 --> 01:27:03,776
I'll not let my reputation be put to dust.

587
01:27:05,389 --> 01:27:07,914
Please don't put out the candle of
our house with our own hands.

588
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:12,691
Your reputation will be of no use
in a house without light.

589
01:27:13,597 --> 01:27:17,192
And the world will laugh at you.
Nobody can stop people from laughing.

590
01:27:18,202 --> 01:27:22,434
Please agree to what I am saying.
Call Chandu. Vidya will be saved.

591
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:27,942
Don't bother me. Do whatever you like. Go.
Get lost. Let me sleep.

592
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:45,923
This is a letter from the head
of the village Bhavanipur.

593
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:51,267
They need a person who can go to every
village and spread knowledge.

594
01:27:52,603 --> 01:27:55,367
They want to create an institution like
Vidya Bhavan in Bhavanipur.

595
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,803
They need our help for that.
- We should help them Babuji.

596
01:28:00,577 --> 01:28:06,675
Spreading knowledge is our duty.
But whom will we send Babuji?

597
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:12,518
That is what I am also thinking.
- That Laila Bai is there. Send her.

598
01:28:13,257 --> 01:28:16,886
Not Laila Bai. Leela Bai Bholaram. Leela Bai.

599
01:28:17,995 --> 01:28:21,863
Let us also see how capable she is.
She was supposed to go abroad.

600
01:28:22,866 --> 01:28:28,065
Let us see what she does in India.
- That is okay Bholaram. But she is a...

601
01:28:28,172 --> 01:28:31,335
...woman. It is not good to send her alone.

602
01:28:32,543 --> 01:28:36,639
Other than this, she is new to our work.
We should send somebody responsible.

603
01:28:37,047 --> 01:28:41,006
Send Chandu with her.
Let us see his approach too.

604
01:28:41,518 --> 01:28:47,150
No Bholaram. Chandu avoids Leela.
He is always critical about her behavior.

605
01:28:48,826 --> 01:28:51,090
Knowledge can be spread with a
feeling of team spirit.

606
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:56,161
Alas! Had Vidya been here,
it would have been so good.

607
01:28:57,568 --> 01:29:00,731
What to think about something
which is not here Babuji.

608
01:29:02,272 --> 01:29:06,003
Send Chandu with Laila Bai.
It would be a test for both of them.

609
01:29:06,877 --> 01:29:12,144
You are too innocent Bholaram. Can't you
understand your own son's heart?

610
01:29:14,284 --> 01:29:18,186
Chandu loves Vidya and Vidya has
been snatched away from him.

611
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:23,982
It is only his courage that despite
such turmoil in the heart he is doing the...

612
01:29:24,094 --> 01:29:26,494
...work of Vidya Bhavan with a
smile on his face.

613
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:30,466
Last night he was watching the moon.
I understood that he was remembering...

614
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:36,767
...Vidya. I want to know Babuji,
can anybody touch the moon no matter...

615
01:29:36,874 --> 01:29:43,871
...how hard he tries? Babuji make him just
like you, let him lead a life of austerity

616
01:29:43,981 --> 01:29:45,949
Send him with Laila.

617
01:29:48,919 --> 01:29:53,583
Shambhu Dada. How is Vidya?
Vidya's condition is not good Ram Babu.

618
01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:57,422
No medicine seems to help.

619
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:04,932
Ram Babu. Sir is not at all concerned.
Please do something for Vidya.

620
01:30:05,903 --> 01:30:09,464
Babuji, you must go to see Vidya.

621
01:30:10,774 --> 01:30:15,802
Okay. I will come in the evening
Shambhu Dada. Inform Bhabhi.

622
01:30:21,885 --> 01:30:28,313
Vidya's condition is bad. She only
remembers you even when unconscious.

623
01:30:31,028 --> 01:30:35,055
What did Babuji say?
-He is coming to see Vidya in the evening.

624
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:37,598
It would be good if you come as well.

625
01:34:10,013 --> 01:34:14,507
Have patience Bhabhi. God is testing us.

626
01:34:15,652 --> 01:34:18,883
Let him do his work and let us do ours.

627
01:34:19,389 --> 01:34:25,419
One little soul has taken to bed with
pain and grief. Won't you even cure her?

628
01:34:25,962 --> 01:34:29,523
- Doctor must be coming.
You brother also says this.

629
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:35,604
But nobody understands her ailment
and which doctor can cure her?

630
01:34:36,973 --> 01:34:40,306
All right. I will send the big
doctor from Vidya Bhavan.

631
01:34:40,677 --> 01:34:46,377
There is no greater doctor than Chandu
in Vidya Bhavan. Send him here.

632
01:34:46,917 --> 01:34:49,943
Vidya will be all right. Chandu has
gone to Bhavanipur Bhabhi.

633
01:34:51,054 --> 01:34:56,151
He will be back only in a month.
-In one month? It will be all Over Bhaiya.

634
01:34:56,693 --> 01:35:01,187
Please save Vidya. - Don't worry Bhabhi.
God will take care of everything.

635
01:35:02,032 --> 01:35:04,057
Let me meet Vidya.

636
01:35:22,385 --> 01:35:25,013
Now it's enough. Close it.
It's very late in the night.

637
01:35:25,455 --> 01:35:31,155
You can go to sleep.
- Even if I'm not sleepy?

638
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:37,627
You will get sleep if you try. Chandu Babu,
why does something...

639
01:35:37,734 --> 01:35:43,070
...strange happens in my heart
when you smile?

640
01:35:43,306 --> 01:35:46,707
Maybe because one of your brothers
has a similar smile.

641
01:35:50,647 --> 01:35:56,381
Are you missing your people? - Who is there
to call my own in this world?

642
01:35:58,021 --> 01:36:01,354
Have this milk. - Please don't burden me
with your favors Leela Devi.

643
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:05,587
Why do you take all these troubles?
I would have heated the milk myself.

644
01:36:06,496 --> 01:36:09,363
You will not do any work till
I am here. Why?

645
01:36:12,669 --> 01:36:19,541
Because, you...with you...
to you... nothing.

646
01:39:45,715 --> 01:39:51,312
Tears should never fall from the eyes.
- Are you crying Leela?

647
01:39:53,223 --> 01:39:55,851
What is the difference between the
tears and the smile of a woman?

648
01:39:55,992 --> 01:40:00,827
Have I done something wrong? - No, not
at all. In fact I have made a mistake.

649
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:03,429
I don't think you have made a mistake.

650
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,495
Even if you have made a mistake you
should try to amend it.

651
01:40:08,338 --> 01:40:13,071
Chandu Babu, you work hard day and night.
You don't take care...

652
01:40:13,176 --> 01:40:16,668
to rest even when you are tired.
- But what is there to cry about?

653
01:40:18,681 --> 01:40:23,516
It pains that I am not fortunate
enough to be of help to you despite

654
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:27,386
your taking care of all
my comforts.
- I didn't get you.

655
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,818
Didn't you understand?
- Leela! - Chandu!

656
01:40:31,327 --> 01:40:34,194
What is this Leela?
- Please try to understand me.

657
01:40:38,034 --> 01:40:41,492
The solitude of the night has affected you.
You are forgetting that you...

658
01:40:41,604 --> 01:40:43,572
...are an attendant at Vidya Bhavan.

659
01:40:44,307 --> 01:40:46,434
An attendant prevents others
from the path of destruction.

660
01:40:46,676 --> 01:40:48,906
But you are ruining yourself.

661
01:40:50,046 --> 01:40:53,038
We are here to campaign for Vidya and
not to show our immorality.

662
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:58,510
I love you. Is loving someone immoral?

663
01:40:58,755 --> 01:41:02,816
There is lust and passion in your eyes,
not love.

664
01:41:04,127 --> 01:41:07,255
Your breath doesn't carry the fragrance
of love but stench of lust.

665
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:11,032
Do you want to kill the ideals of Vidya
Bhavan in the loneliness of the night?

666
01:41:14,437 --> 01:41:23,311
Ideals? Chandu Babu you don't have
a place for me in your heart.

667
01:41:23,813 --> 01:41:27,408
Chandu doesn't hate anybody.
Then why won't he have place for you in...

668
01:41:27,517 --> 01:41:32,545
...his heart. But I realize that
you want to fall from your place.

669
01:41:32,822 --> 01:41:35,689
No, please don't remove me from your heart.

670
01:41:36,326 --> 01:41:39,557
Since childhood I had a place in
my heart for a sister. You filled it when you...

671
01:41:39,662 --> 01:41:43,723
came to Vidya Bhavan.
Even now that place is yours.

672
01:41:44,067 --> 01:41:46,228
Chandu!
- Get up Leela.

673
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:51,568
Smile. C'mon smile.

674
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:55,544
Ram Babu.
- Who is there?
- It's me Shambhu.

675
01:42:02,986 --> 01:42:05,477
Shambhu Babu? What are you
doing here at this hour?

676
01:42:05,688 --> 01:42:08,953
What has happened?
- Vidya's condition has deteriorated Babuji.

677
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:12,157
Please call Chandu at once
otherwise we might lose Vidya.

678
01:42:13,129 --> 01:42:16,860
Vidya's condition has deteriorated.
I got it Babuji. Just send a telegram...

679
01:42:16,966 --> 01:42:19,127
to Chandu asking to come immediately.

680
01:42:20,003 --> 01:42:21,971
Please go Babuji. Hurry up.

681
01:42:22,505 --> 01:42:25,941
Okay. Don't you worry.
I'll send a telegram to Chandu.

682
01:42:58,174 --> 01:43:06,707
Vidya, Vidya, Shambhu Dada,
Doctor, Doctor, my child.

683
01:43:08,518 --> 01:43:15,424
- Mataji - Who is there?
It's me Mataji. Chandu.

684
01:43:21,297 --> 01:43:24,095
Vidya, Chandu has come.

685
01:43:31,474 --> 01:43:38,141
Vidya. Vidya. It's me Chandu.
I am here Vidya.

686
01:43:42,919 --> 01:43:46,946
I am here Vidya. Your Chandu is back.

687
01:47:32,181 --> 01:47:38,984
Mister how come you are alone today?
Where did you leave Leela?

688
01:47:39,188 --> 01:47:42,885
Must be in Vidya Bhavan.
She was singing your praises.

689
01:47:43,426 --> 01:47:47,556
She was saying that with you she
didn't even realize how the days passed.

690
01:47:49,165 --> 01:47:51,326
She was saying Chandu
Babu takes special care of me.

691
01:47:51,434 --> 01:47:53,402
Yes, she is a nice girl.

692
01:47:53,803 --> 01:47:56,795
Vidya just wait. I have to have
something important to talk to you about.

693
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,665
I don't have the time.
- You will have to take the time out.

694
01:48:01,444 --> 01:48:04,277
After a few days this house would be mine.
And even you will be mine.

695
01:48:05,548 --> 01:48:07,413
Your father is getting you married to me.

696
01:48:14,724 --> 01:48:19,821
Congratulations Harish Babu.
- Thank you. Take care of Leela.

697
01:48:20,563 --> 01:48:22,622
She is alone in this world. - Thank You.

698
01:48:32,475 --> 01:48:34,443
Babuji. What's the matter?

699
01:48:34,577 --> 01:48:37,671
Babuji please tell Harish that
he should not talk nonsense to me.

700
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:44,648
What did he say?
- He was saying that he would marry me.

701
01:48:45,221 --> 01:48:47,985
If he ever says any such thing,
I will break his face.

702
01:48:48,257 --> 01:48:51,351
He was right. You will be married to him.

703
01:48:52,194 --> 01:48:54,856
I hope you did not insult him.
-If he wants to save his honor...

704
01:48:54,964 --> 01:48:57,159
...then he should stop talking
such nonsense to me.

705
01:48:57,666 --> 01:49:01,033
If you are worried about his honor
then you change your decision.

706
01:49:01,537 --> 01:49:04,802
Vidya how dare you argue
with your father?

707
01:49:05,841 --> 01:49:09,800
I don't want to ruin my life like
my mother by getting married to Harish.

708
01:49:10,246 --> 01:49:13,238
Who has spoiled your mind?
Tell me and I'll kill him.

709
01:49:13,549 --> 01:49:16,382
That clock on the wall.
When it strikes two o'clock in the night.

710
01:49:17,186 --> 01:49:21,589
And when you come home drunk
and beat mother. - Shut up.

711
01:49:21,957 --> 01:49:26,053
I have heard a lot of rubbish. You are a girl
and you should behave like one.

712
01:49:26,796 --> 01:49:28,320
Back answering and arguing
do not suit girls.

713
01:49:28,898 --> 01:49:32,026
This is a question of my life Babuji.
If being educated I can't take care...

714
01:49:32,134 --> 01:49:35,262
...of my own life then millions of
uneducated women of India...

715
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:38,807
...will spit on my face. And they will
say that we could not stand for our...

716
01:49:38,941 --> 01:49:41,910
...rights because of our illiteracy
but what have you achieved by being...

717
01:49:42,244 --> 01:49:45,543
...educated and literate?
- I'm not pushing you in a well.

718
01:49:46,315 --> 01:49:48,806
Harish is the son of my friend whose
background is far superior to that...

719
01:49:48,918 --> 01:49:50,385
...of that cobbler's son.

720
01:49:50,953 --> 01:49:54,116
But Chandu is a man of integrity.
Your friend's son is a rogue and a person...

721
01:49:54,223 --> 01:49:58,353
...of immoral character. He has ruined
the lives of so many innocent girls.

722
01:49:58,828 --> 01:50:01,888
This is all nonsense.
I know Harish very well.

723
01:50:02,565 --> 01:50:05,898
I too know Harish very well.
I can never marry Harish.

724
01:50:06,335 --> 01:50:09,793
Vidya, you will be married only to Harish.
- This will never happen.

725
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:14,637
Will this never happen? Never?

726
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,748
Listen. My word is supreme in this house.

727
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:25,213
Both your mother and you are a nuisance to me.

728
01:50:41,137 --> 01:50:46,200
Poor guy. Why is Harish being thrown out?

729
01:50:50,513 --> 01:50:54,506
What a change? A revolution.

730
01:51:19,975 --> 01:51:26,608
Very good. Very, very good.
So a sinner is becoming a saint now?

731
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:38,216
Oh. I see. So my own cat is
now meowing at me?

732
01:51:38,661 --> 01:51:44,861
I say shut up. I can't tolerate these
cheap talks of yours anymore.

733
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:52,898
Is this Ms. Leela speaking
or Harish's money?

734
01:51:55,277 --> 01:52:00,112
Leela is speaking to express gratitude
for Harish's money.

735
01:52:05,688 --> 01:52:10,318
Gratitude for my money?
- Yes I'll always be grateful to you for...

736
01:52:11,393 --> 01:52:15,124
...your money which had turned my
life from sand to gold.

737
01:52:24,406 --> 01:52:29,309
Take your money back and give it
to some other girl to spoil her.

738
01:52:30,512 --> 01:52:37,315
You are betraying me.
You are betraying the country.

739
01:52:38,487 --> 01:52:42,821
The nation needs an industrious person
like Chandu and you are out...

740
01:52:42,925 --> 01:52:48,488
...to ruin his life. That too through me
who worships him like an elder brother.

741
01:52:50,866 --> 01:52:53,426
Chandu your brother?

742
01:52:58,674 --> 01:53:00,801
You can go away.
And take your money back with you.

743
01:53:02,144 --> 01:53:04,112
Harish doesn't lick back after spitting.

744
01:53:08,284 --> 01:53:11,720
I swear on your milk Maa. Till the time
I make Babuji realize and repent for...

745
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:15,256
...his misdeeds, I'll not show you my face.

746
01:53:15,858 --> 01:53:18,122
Where will you go after
leaving the house?

747
01:53:18,494 --> 01:53:21,520
To Chachaji. Vidya Bhavan.
And I'm leaving now.

748
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,601
Vidya this house will
be desolated. Just think.

749
01:53:30,506 --> 01:53:36,069
This house will never become
happy unless I fulfil my vow.

750
01:56:33,288 --> 01:56:37,452
You look very happy Leela?
Which sister will not feel happy...

751
01:56:37,559 --> 01:56:41,552
after slapping her brother's enemy?
Whom did you slap?

752
01:56:42,598 --> 01:56:46,557
Harish Babu, your childhood friend.
- Harish? Why?

753
01:56:48,103 --> 01:56:54,064
It's a long story. But now since you
have changed my life, I won't hide...

754
01:56:54,142 --> 01:56:56,269
...anything from you.

755
01:57:01,216 --> 01:57:03,707
Vidya, why did you come out from there?

756
01:57:04,286 --> 01:57:09,986
Because I entered without asking.
- I see. Do you know who she is?

757
01:57:10,726 --> 01:57:15,186
Must be some sister of mine.
- Are you crying? You're crazy.

758
01:57:16,965 --> 01:57:20,765
Come with me. She is not your sister
but mine. Leela. Come I'll introduce you.

759
01:57:24,606 --> 01:57:28,007
Leela, do you know Vidya?

760
01:57:32,814 --> 01:57:41,347
I knew, but was not acquainted with her.
Now I know her properly.

761
01:57:41,623 --> 01:57:45,024
What did you know?
- Should I say? - Yes.

762
01:57:46,061 --> 01:57:50,498
Should I say? - Yes.
- She is my would-be sister-in-law.

763
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:02,141
Chandu, where have Baba
and Chachaji gone?

764
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:04,302
They have gone to open a new school
in the cobblers' area.

765
01:58:05,447 --> 01:58:08,041
But why have you come here
despite your weakness?

766
01:58:09,284 --> 01:58:12,344
I had a fight with Babuji
and now I'll stay here.

767
01:58:12,521 --> 01:58:14,489
And will your mother stay there alone?

768
01:58:14,856 --> 01:58:19,520
I know Maa would be in distress over there.
But I have pledged that till...

769
01:58:19,628 --> 01:58:25,931
...I make Babuji repent, I will not show her my face.

770
01:58:27,869 --> 01:58:29,962
Now it is your responsibility
to show me the way.

771
01:58:30,806 --> 01:58:34,435
I'll give my life to make Mataji happy.

772
01:58:51,827 --> 01:58:58,596
You? Why have you come here?
- You are never at home. I went to the...

773
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:02,659
...office but did not find you.
So I had no other option but to come here.

774
01:59:03,071 --> 01:59:05,596
Don't talk rubbish.
Tell me what you want and go away.

775
01:59:09,978 --> 01:59:12,811
See Chachaji. I don't like
Vidya's conduct towards me.

776
01:59:13,448 --> 01:59:15,814
You are such a strange fellow.
Is this the time for such talks?

777
01:59:16,351 --> 01:59:18,080
Come to my place in the morning.
Right now go away.

778
01:59:19,121 --> 01:59:21,919
I have come here to decide.
And will go only after knowing your decision.

779
01:59:23,025 --> 01:59:25,653
I don't have time to waste.
- Then sit at your place.

780
01:59:26,194 --> 01:59:28,719
How can you come to bother me without
seeing what time and place it is

781
01:59:29,131 --> 01:59:32,100
I cannot tolerate all this anymore.
- You will have to tell me clearly whether...

782
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,464
you are going to get Vidya married
to me or not?

783
01:59:34,836 --> 01:59:38,294
Do you want to marry Vidya or me?
Is it my fault that you couldn't win...

784
01:59:38,407 --> 01:59:40,568
...Vidya's consent till now? Lf she is not
willing to marry you it only shows that...

785
01:59:40,676 --> 01:59:46,546
...you are good for nothing.
This is my decision.

786
01:59:47,549 --> 01:59:52,418
Okay Chachaji, now I will show you
how capable I am. - Okay, go. Go.

787
02:00:11,807 --> 02:00:18,576
Nanhe, why do you look so worried?
- What to tell you brother?

788
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:25,378
I am fed up with Sir.
- Why? What happened?

789
02:00:27,289 --> 02:00:30,053
What will happen?
Everyday it's the same story.

790
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:34,558
He is eccentric and whimsical.
He wants a new girl every time.

791
02:00:34,763 --> 02:00:36,731
Now you only tell what to do
Harish Bhaiya.

792
02:00:37,532 --> 02:00:40,228
Okay then. Listen.
There is this place Vidya Bhavan.

793
02:00:40,335 --> 02:00:44,738
No. Don't even mention the
name of that place.

794
02:01:50,872 --> 02:01:54,467
How dare you even think of the girls
of Vidya Bhavan? Speak?

795
02:01:57,045 --> 02:02:04,417
Who is responsible for sending you here?
- Why don't you answer? Speak.

796
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:10,119
Nobody. Nobody? You say.

797
02:02:13,328 --> 02:02:19,289
You? You tell.

798
02:02:24,906 --> 02:02:27,397
They won't disclose like this. All of
you give these guys a good thrashing.

799
02:02:27,542 --> 02:02:29,510
Then they will divulge everything.

800
02:02:29,611 --> 02:02:34,571
Please don't beat us. We will tell
you everything. - Okay. Stop.

801
02:02:34,683 --> 02:02:36,651
Now tell.
Who has sent you here?

802
02:02:36,852 --> 02:02:41,619
Nanhe Sahib. Who is this Nanhe Sahib?

803
02:02:42,357 --> 02:02:44,348
Our bread and butter depend on him sir.

804
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:47,722
Where does he stay?
- Don't know. Again the same thing?

805
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:52,366
Really. We don't know his residence.
We speak to him over the phone.

806
02:02:53,068 --> 02:02:55,662
So you talk to him over the phone.
But then where were you supposed to...

807
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:57,738
take the girl after abducting her?

808
02:03:01,109 --> 02:03:03,168
Why are you dumb?
Answer what is being asked.

809
02:03:03,612 --> 02:03:05,705
To Zamindar Hari Singh's house.

810
02:03:13,121 --> 02:03:15,419
To Zamindar Hari Singh' house? Why?

811
02:03:17,759 --> 02:03:21,490
I understood everything Chandu.
I know Nanhe very well.

812
02:03:22,397 --> 02:03:25,195
Come with me and call up Nanhe
that you have left the girl

813
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:27,734
...at the destined place.
What are you doing Vidya?

814
02:03:28,403 --> 02:03:31,600
First let them make the call then
I'll tell you. Come with me.

815
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:39,947
Make the call.

816
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:52,651
Is this Mr. Nanhe? Yes.
This is Nanhe speaking.

817
02:03:53,328 --> 02:03:56,058
Sir, the work has been done as
per your instructions.

818
02:03:56,164 --> 02:03:59,964
You have done the work.
Well done. Very good.

819
02:04:00,068 --> 02:04:02,593
Will we get our reward sir? Yes.
I will compensate you there.

820
02:04:02,704 --> 02:04:04,672
I am coming there.

821
02:04:13,148 --> 02:04:16,515
Leela, keep them under your
vigil for some time.

822
02:04:17,185 --> 02:04:19,585
Their decision will be taken once
Chachaji and Baba are back.

823
02:04:20,188 --> 02:04:23,783
Sisters now you can go.
Jai Hind. Jai Hind.

824
02:04:27,829 --> 02:04:35,235
Come with me. - Vidya such rogues
should be handed over to the police.

825
02:04:37,205 --> 02:04:39,173
What is the use of keeping them here?

826
02:04:39,274 --> 02:04:45,975
If what I have thought happens,
my pledge will be fulfilled.

827
02:04:46,748 --> 02:04:49,308
And I would be able to set such an example
for the helpless sisters of our

828
02:04:49,451 --> 02:04:53,182
...country which will save them from
the troubles of the world.

829
02:04:53,555 --> 02:04:56,251
I didn't understand. Whatever
has happened today is...

830
02:04:56,358 --> 02:05:00,055
...indicative of some very cunning
mind behind the conspiracy.

831
02:05:00,228 --> 02:05:03,629
He wants to kill two birds with the
same stone. To ruin my father...

832
02:05:03,732 --> 02:05:07,600
...and malign Vidya Bhavan.
I'll go and explain it to father

833
02:05:07,702 --> 02:05:11,297
And he will hear it from one ear
and throw it out from another.

834
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:15,865
There is one way.
- Chachaji, Chachaji...

835
02:05:19,881 --> 02:05:24,750
Vidya, Chandu, where is Chachaji?
Some rogues have kidnapped Leela.

836
02:05:25,086 --> 02:05:27,782
Leela? Wait Vidya. Yes Harish.

837
02:05:27,889 --> 02:05:30,949
I tried to save her. But one person
was not sufficient for four.

838
02:05:31,292 --> 02:05:33,385
I struggled with all my might but finally
they succeeded in abducting her.

839
02:05:33,762 --> 02:05:36,458
Harish. Oh, Leela.

840
02:05:37,499 --> 02:05:39,433
You must have taken a lot of trouble for me.

841
02:05:41,069 --> 02:05:43,902
Wait brother. Don't come in between.

842
02:06:08,530 --> 02:06:14,162
Well done son. Well done. Now stop.
- Chachaji, he came to fool us.

843
02:06:14,936 --> 02:06:16,904
We are aware of everything my child.

844
02:06:24,245 --> 02:06:30,047
Nanhe, why are my legs trembling?
Did sir drink too much?

845
02:06:30,685 --> 02:06:35,554
No. Not at all.
See my heart is also pounding.

846
02:06:35,957 --> 02:06:42,192
Hold your heart sir. One doesn't get
sleep in a new house on the first day.

847
02:06:44,099 --> 02:06:48,229
You are great pal. Really great.

848
02:06:48,937 --> 02:06:51,929
Go sir. Go. Should I go? - Yes.

849
02:07:16,931 --> 02:07:23,461
Wow. It feels as if a fairy
has descended from heaven.

850
02:07:24,939 --> 02:07:31,435
Just look this way and pierce my heart.

851
02:07:34,949 --> 02:07:38,942
What good poetry for such an occasion?

852
02:07:42,624 --> 02:07:49,587
Just come to me. You won't come?
Okay, the thirsty will come to the well.

853
02:07:50,632 --> 02:07:58,266
A veil cannot hide beauty.
Clouds cannot hide the lightning.

854
02:08:14,522 --> 02:08:18,117
Yes, Vidya of Vidya Bhavan.
Not the daughter of Zamindar Hari Singh.

855
02:08:32,907 --> 02:08:36,274
Why are you running away?
It is still not 2 O'clock.

856
02:08:37,712 --> 02:08:41,113
Show these walls the same drama
which they see everyday.

857
02:08:42,283 --> 02:08:46,447
Forget Vidya and reward these people
who had gone to Vidya Bhavan...

858
02:08:46,554 --> 02:08:49,546
to abduct a daughter for the father.

859
02:08:51,092 --> 02:08:54,084
God. - Not God. But recall all those friends...

860
02:08:54,195 --> 02:08:57,494
who have made a demon out of
a human being.

861
02:08:58,233 --> 02:08:59,928
And who now want to make a devil
out of that demon.

862
02:09:00,868 --> 02:09:04,235
Drink more liquor. Forget the world
and its creator. And forget the...

863
02:09:04,339 --> 02:09:08,969
...pious relation of Father and Daughter.
Move ahead.

864
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:24,251
O God. - Babuji. Babuji. - O God.

865
02:09:27,061 --> 02:09:31,225
Am I still alive? Why didn't I die?
Babuji.

866
02:09:31,499 --> 02:09:33,990
Don't let her come near me.
Don't let Vidya come near me.

867
02:09:40,074 --> 02:09:43,737
I am a sinner. I can't show my face
to anybody.

868
02:09:44,512 --> 02:09:51,611
Vidya, my child. Please forgive me. Babuji.

869
02:09:52,687 --> 02:09:57,351
Vidya committed a big folly.
Please forgive her.

870
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:02,425
Should I forgive? No. No.
I have harassed you people a lot.

871
02:10:02,864 --> 02:10:05,890
All of you please forgive me.
Please don't say like this.

872
02:10:06,434 --> 02:10:08,959
No. No. Don't touch the feet
of a sinner like me.

873
02:10:10,138 --> 02:10:12,629
Babuji. Please lie down.

874
02:10:20,181 --> 02:10:24,880
Brother, Chandu and his father
Bholaram have come to see you.

875
02:10:26,988 --> 02:10:31,755
Chandu's father Bholaram.
I am his culprit too.

876
02:10:32,193 --> 02:10:36,095
Please don't say that Zamindar Sahib.
You are very fortunate.

877
02:10:37,532 --> 02:10:41,468
You have a daughter like Vidya
and a Goddess for a wife.

878
02:10:42,136 --> 02:10:44,104
Come Chandu.

879
02:10:55,583 --> 02:11:00,577
Chandu and Vidya are both my eyes.
I could see the light in the world...

880
02:11:00,688 --> 02:11:04,351
...only because of them.
Come here my children.
