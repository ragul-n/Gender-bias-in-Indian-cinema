1
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,196
Life is a big mystery understood by none.

2
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,840
Let's see if one such mystery coming up in our hero's life
would give an answer to the question haunting him down.

3
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,036
Come on Tyson

4
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,196
Tyson... Tyson... Stop Tyson

5
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,436
Hey, let us see

6
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,680
On this beach always peaceful, public coming for morning
jogging seeing this incident at once are shocked with fear

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
But the Police are yet to still identify
about whose is this dead body

8
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,000
Stop that public first

9
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,280
Are you the one who called?
- Yes Sir

10
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,800
Come once to the station
- Ok sir

11
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,916
Sir
- Sir, you think this is suicide or a murder?

12
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,476
See, don’t make any assumptions.
We too just got the information

13
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:49,120
Once our investigation is over and we get clarity,
we shall inform you. Thank you

14
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:09,040
Paddu... Paddu

15
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:11,920
Hello boss

16
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,276
Will you try this? It’s a good material

17
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:15,240
No habit, move aside

18
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,040
Mine too was the same dialogue
for the first time

19
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,316
Looks like you are in some tension.
You’ll get relaxed, try

20
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,560
Don’t force anyone ever

21
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Paddu... Paddu stop

22
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,756
Nobody here... Nothing...
Come on let’s party...

23
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,876
Paddu stop

24
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,516
Satya, Come...
- Paddu, where?

25
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,956
Paddu, it’s already late

26
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,316
Satya, I love this place. You too come

27
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,560
Come on, we will go home

28
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,396
Paddu, waves are high. Listen to me.
We shall go home

29
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,436
Hey, who is this?

30
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:49,360
Paddu, what is this like a small girl?

31
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,920
Hey, are you mad? Where are you going?

32
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
You wish to die or what?

33
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,160
My wife
- What?

34
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:56,516
Paddu please, come

35
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,836
No

36
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,360
I’m saying you. Come on, we will go please

37
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
Hey, did you drink high?
There isn’t anyone there

38
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,680
Move, move on... Move from here

39
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,516
My wife Paddu is there. My wife...

40
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,120
Paddu...

41
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:29,560
I put aside the truth that she isn’t with me now,
I’m living in a lie that she’s always with me

42
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
Hello
- Will you give the phone to baby once?

43
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,196
Ok Sir...

44
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Swecha, daddy’s phone

45
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,160
Hello daddy, when are you coming? Saturday is
my birthday, are you coming or forgot?

46
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,076
I won’t talk to you if you don’t come

47
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,276
I’m coming. I’m coming for you dear
- Ok

48
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,196
Bye Swecha
- Bye daddy

49
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Rishi, are you ready? Take the lunch box
- Yes, I took

50
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,636
Sir... Good morning Sir

51
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,600
Sorry Sir, I’m slowly recovering Sir

52
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:35,320
I’m sorry sir. Because of me like this

53
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh no, what Sir? Be seated Sir, please.

54
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,796
Sir, my lost confidence is back because of you Sir

55
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:47,080
Though worked with you for just few days,
I’ve the satisfaction to have worked very sincere

56
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,080
There are many as me in the department Sir

57
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,556
No problem even if I’m down.
People like you are very less

58
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:54,720
Department has a need of you Sir

59
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,916
Daddy
- Swecha

60
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:01,320
How are you?
- Fine

61
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,036
Are you going to school?
- Yes

62
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Where are you taking me, dad?

63
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
Surprise
- Oh

64
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,636
You go to school
- Ok

65
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,756
Sravani, take baby out
- I’ll come tomorrow and take you out

66
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
Sure?
- Sure

67
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:18,756
SMS from an unknown this morning to
the Government officials is become a sensation

68
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,960
Going into the details, the Police concluded that
death of Phoenix Pharmaceuticals owner Srinivas

69
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,600
two months back is a suicide and closed the case

70
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
But that stranger requested in SMS that
a complete investigation needs to be carried out

71
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,876
stating that this isn’t suicide but a cold blooded murder

72
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,556
My brain is getting heated up. You must have
seen in the morning news, right?

73
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:53,080
I investigated that close myself and closed it

74
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:58,120
And now as someone messaged, District Judge got
serious and called our Commissioner it seems

75
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,676
And he asks to reinvestigate and submit
the whole report in two days. What’s this?

76
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,636
Hello... Satya...

77
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,396
When I’m shouting here,
why are you thinking elsewhere?

78
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,396
Ok, bring two glasses

79
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,756
What’s this dude, how many days more?

80
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,320
Paddu isn’t there. Start another fresh life

81
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,360
Even if not for you, start for Swecha

82
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,320
How far has your investigation come?
- Which investigation?

83
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Hey, this is closed long back.
There’s nothing to investigate

84
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,320
He texted to be committing suicide
and then died

85
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:56,320
What more investigation, it’s closed

86
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,796
Closed... The case is closed

87
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:14,876
Morning Satya
- Say Ravi

88
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:18,516
I mean, my kid needs to be dropped right?
To school... I’m here

89
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,396
You didn’t get up even when I woke you up
- Ok, see you

90
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,636
Hey...
- Say

91
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,080
Nothing, is there the file on the table?

92
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,756
Yes, it’s there

93
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,600
Thank God,
I searched whole house thinking it’s lost

94
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,276
I should submit that file tomorrow. I’ll come
and take in the evening - Ok

95
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,036
Ok, see you
- Bye

96
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,120
Company worth Crores...
Died in a very small age...

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,916
Is Phoenix Pharma owner
Srinivas Kakarla’s a suicide or murder?

98
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,516
It’s yet to be known.
Police have completed enquiry.

99
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,080
Information is that they’re going to submit
their report tomorrow to the Commissioner

100
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:17,556
Let’s hope the shades of doubt around
that case get cleared by tomorrow

101
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:19,240
Now, we will take a small break

102
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,556
Same stamp... same club

103
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,840
File is ready sir, morning submit...
Sorry

104
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,080
March 23rd...

105
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,556
March 23rd, dates are matching

106
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:44,796
So, is there any link in between
Paddu’s suicide and Srinivas’s death ?

107
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,440
Sir...

108
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:47,916
Hey...

109
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,480
Ravi, gather the team and I’m coming
- Ok

110
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:53,916
Satya
- What happened?

111
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,676
Shall we go?
- What?

112
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,080
I said we shall go to
Sravya’s birthday party, right?

113
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes
- I’m Satya, ACP

114
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,396
Ok
- Are you Srinivas’s wife?

115
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:38,320
Yes - I came to talk about
your husband’s suicide case. Can I?

116
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,036
Please come

117
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,120
Be seated
- Yeah, thanks

118
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:03,156
Can I get a glass of water please?
- Yeah sure - Yeah

119
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,876
Thank you... Please

120
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,080
So, do you mind if I ask you few questions?
- Sure

121
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,916
Did Srinivas have any financial issues?
- No

122
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,320
For you both... Any disturbances as such?

123
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,516
Nothing so, Sir

124
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,960
Where was Srinivas on March 22nd evening?

125
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Actually, we both went for a party

126
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,556
How was his attitude? Everything normal?

127
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,440
Yeah, I mean he was pretty casual

128
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,036
In fact, he reserved the table for us

129
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,600
After a long time,
he got some time to spend with me

130
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:55,480
In real, we were at the beach for
a long time after the party

131
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,276
He went aside saying he got some call

132
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,036
I waited for long, he didn’t come

133
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,360
I tried his phone too, didn’t connect

134
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,240
That’s very common for him.
He doesn’t care anyone when he’s into work

135
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,840
I thought the same and came back home

136
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:19,200
But, by the time I woke up and saw in the morning,
I had a message from Srinivas

137
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,720
I’m fed up... I quit

138
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,676
I never expected Srinivas to do so

139
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:35,636
I’m so sorry

140
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,200
This is my number. If you want to say something
about the case, you can call me - Ok

141
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,240
See to that there isn’t any problem
- Ok Sir

142
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,676
Hello

143
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,480
Who are you?
- ACP

144
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,440
What are you doing in our flats?

145
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,920
I spoke to wife of 403 Suicide victim
Srinivas and returning

146
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,480
Oh, what? Did you speak to 403 Srinivas’s wife
and coming back? - Yes

147
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:17,920
You know who I am?
General Secretary to these flats, Janardhan

148
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:22,356
Not even a fly gets in or even grass flies out
without my orders, understand?

149
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Hello, which zone are you from?
- West zone

150
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,440
West zone? Your Commissioner Dalvi
is my friend, shall I talk?

151
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,516
That isn’t it Sir, what I want to say is
- Ok

152
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,556
You want a clarification, right? Ok

153
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,596
Venkatrao
- Sir

154
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,276
Bring 403 keys
- Ok Sir

155
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,160
It’s locked, come let’s see. Come on

156
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:43,076
Come on man, you too come

157
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,720
Srinivas Rao isn’t married at all
and a wife again

158
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,960
He doesn’t understand when said that house
is locked after he died. Open the lock

159
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,116
It’s locked... yes

160
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,920
Come on...

161
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:06,036
Where Sir, where is his wife?
- Excuse me madam

162
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,756
Excuse me

163
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:15,276
Hello

164
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,720
What happened? Aah!

165
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,880
Hello, didn’t you see the girl?

166
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,316
I sat there and the girl sat here.
I even drank water

167
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,960
What, you sat here and drank water?
Where is the water and where is the person?

168
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,240
I even wrote my number
- Is it?

169
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh number... Where did you write?
On this mirror?

170
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,516
Then you had food and slept for a while...

171
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,356
Look, it is so if you drink and do your duty

172
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,316
Go man, don’t create a nuisance
- Sir...

173
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:41,920
He’s come

174
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:45,596
Hello Sir, myself Oilve Green.
I sell clean and original Olive oil products

175
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:47,556
Hey Olive oil, what’s your work here? Get out
- You stop Sir

176
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,316
I should tell you a matter.
Did you really speak to that girl?

177
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:51,756
I spoke
- Oh no

178
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:56,160
I’ll tell you a secret, come here.
There’s a ghost in this flat

179
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:58,596
Ghost
- Yes

180
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:00,756
Ghost, did he say there’s a ghost in this flat?

181
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,920
Hey Olive oil, get out from here
- Sir, believe me. I promise on my Olive oil

182
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,960
It’s true Sir
- Get out, I’ll beat you up

183
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,400
Wait Sir, I’m not saying about your wife
- Why about my wife?

184
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,680
Don’t believe the words of this idiot Sir
- You get out first

185
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,356
There’s already a mad idiot in our flats
and you too don’t behave like a mad guy

186
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,596
Girl is there, gave water, signed
and wrote number...

187
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,516
Get away man, don’t talk too much
- Hey...

188
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:26,440
He called me as he was my friend. If it was
any other, he’d have filed a nuisance case

189
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:32,036
Satya, you’re already in suspension
and you’re going to rejoin in 4 months

190
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,960
Why are you complicating this?

191
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,356
Sir, there is some link with Srinivas’s case
and my wife Paddu’s suicide

192
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:41,316
I thus went there
- Satya, please

193
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:43,920
Ravi already did reinvestigation

194
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:47,200
Sir, the dates are matching and...
- Please

195
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:49,596
Ravi
- Yes Sir

196
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:50,920
Give me the file

197
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:58,480
It’s a suicide Satya

198
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:01,116
And the case is closed

199
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:12,116
I have none to say as my own except Paddu

200
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,640
After finishing the training,
I came to Vizag for her

201
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:20,556
'Few days Ago'
Why is the entire room like this? Take those boxes and put here

202
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,240
Keep the room neat
- Oh no

203
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,596
Satya, it’ll be so when you do works
which you never do

204
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,160
Where is the first aid kit?

205
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:29,640
Where is the first aid kit?

206
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,480
There’s nothing as such Paddu,
you come here

207
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,036
Satya, you know how careless you be?
Don’t keep in water for much long

208
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,756
Hey, what’s this? No!
- Don’t move

209
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,036
Paddu
- Yes

210
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,720
What’ve you done about the matter I said in phone?
- Hah

211
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:55,796
Not hah, but waiting for your reply

212
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,720
Is it? What did you exactly say?

213
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,960
I was in office that day, right?
I didn’t listen properly

214
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,680
Really Satya, what did you say?

215
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:07,720
Madam, it’s time

216
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,756
Auto is waiting down, I’m leaving.
Be careful

217
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
Paddu, I love you

218
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,160
Paddu, if you say Ok,
I’ll marry you right today

219
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,756
Officer Sir, you came just today right?

220
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,516
There are so many works we got to do

221
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:37,356
We shall go to some peaceful place.
Only you and I should be there

222
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,796
We shall chat so much and
we both shall fight

223
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:45,880
I should feel bad then and
you shall come and say me sorry

224
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,440
It’s a long process officer, takes time.
Bye

225
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,680
What to do?

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
What to do, what shall I do?

227
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,316
I can’t speak up seeing that smile,
what shall I do?

228
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:38,680
When I’m going like a dove,
he waited my way as the blue cloud

229
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:47,680
When I’m slipping as a honey drop,
he turned into a honey bee

230
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:57,516
Oh my dear... Oh my dear...

231
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,920
What to do, he’s so naughty

232
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:05,200
What to do, he’s become my own

233
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,756
When did he enter into the heart
without information?

234
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,160
It’s him before me
when I came into the age

235
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,516
No idea, when is the bonding made

236
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Hey friend, my life

237
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,356
I’m here for you as you’ll be mine

238
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,160
I’ll become a cool breeze
to relieve your tiredness

239
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,720
What to do?

240
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,076
Oh my dear...

241
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,076
What to do, he’s so naughty

242
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,440
Who gave, say who gave rascal?
- No, I don’t know Sir

243
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:15,596
Sir, please look into it Sir
- Hey, go and sit on the side

244
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,160
What about you idiot?
Why did you come late?

245
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Sign here

246
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,036
I’m coming daily right?
What’s gone if I’m late by 10 minutes?

247
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,796
Who gave?
- I don’t know Sir

248
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:29,556
Say, where did you buy?
- I don’t know anything Sir

249
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
Good morning Sir
- Morning

250
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:45,356
Where’s Ravi?
- He’s inside Sir

251
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
Who?
- ACP, who came newly

252
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Ravi

253
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,400
I just took charge and came directly to see you
- Won’t you change at all?

254
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,036
I changed the style, right?

255
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,756
I mean, you do if you think?
Satya IPS, I’m so proud of you

256
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,756
Still, keep that all aside. You said some business
and all, why did you come into the department?

257
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:22,000
My brother in law gave a hand saying
to give money now and then

258
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,880
Feeling that I was roaming around very free, here
my dad gave this job with a recommendation

259
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:31,720
I don’t have so much passion as you.
You worked hard and became IPS now

260
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,440
How’s your family?
- Family... Huh!

261
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:40,836
Husband like me... World’s number 1 father.
They’re very luxurious

262
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:49,240
Police
- Down down

263
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,920
Mr. Rajaram, you come out first.

264
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Are you Police or animals?
Beating a small kid like an animal

265
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:58,200
On what basis have you arrested him?
I’ll drag all you people into the court

266
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,640
Please, please leave.
Thank you, thank you very much

267
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,556
Are you saying rules to us?
You know who I am?

268
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:05,516
I’m a human rights activist.
Human will have few rights

269
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,836
Do you know that there’ll be
a society to safeguard them?

270
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,000
What happened?
- Sir, that is a boy of Intermediate

271
00:26:16,356 --> 00:26:20,796
As he was blocking the whole traffic being high,
I brought him Sir - Yes

272
00:26:22,356 --> 00:26:23,516
When searched in the pockets,
I found this Sir

273
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
Mandrax pill Sir. They’re circulating
maximum in the whole city Sir

274
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,116
Small kids Sir, they’re getting
attracted a lot Sir

275
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:31,720
You’d have kept in his pocket
- Why me Sir?

276
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:32,796
Who doesn’t know about you?

277
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,720
Give the bail paper and leave that boy

278
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,356
Sir, I’m gathering information
- Rajaram, leave that fellow

279
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,440
Sir, not like that
- Rajaram, leave him

280
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,920
File this

281
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,400
Rajaram...
- Sorry Sir

282
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,960
How long have you been in the department?
- 15 Years Sir

283
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:04,480
15 Years?
- Yes Sir

284
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,880
Most frustrated soul in the department

285
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,356
As you had no case found, you thought a student
and wished to push him inside, Rajaram?

286
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:14,316
If human rights people involve,
total station has to stand on the roads

287
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:21,036
And our personal grudges,
we shouldn’t push over the public Rajaram

288
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:22,836
Hope you get it

289
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,240
Sir

290
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,000
Are you trying to justify the act you did?
- No Sir, believe my words Sir, please

291
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,836
2 Crores worth material is changing hands
this night at 2. Please Sir, believe me

292
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,276
Don’t support yourself. You hit
as you like and he spoke as he liked

293
00:27:39,516 --> 00:27:41,796
Not so Sir, please trust me Sir
- Oh no! Satya

294
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,160
He’s blabbering something Satya. Sir, please
- Let’s give it a try

295
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
At what time in the night?
- 2’o Clock in the night Sir, matter of few hours

296
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,356
He’s given genuine information after so long

297
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,880
What shall we do?
- Let’s go

298
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,960
Where? See how many are there. We have
no need to take so much risk, Satya

299
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,720
We get a backup calling the Control room

300
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,076
Ravi, it takes 30 minutes for them to come
if we call control room and we’ll miss them

301
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:16,680
Come on, let’s go
- It isn’t safe and we can’t do this

302
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:18,480
Sir, I’ll come

303
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,276
Stay here
- Yes Sir

304
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:20,160
Hey, who are you? Where is George?
Why don’t you talk?

305
00:30:09,756 --> 00:30:13,356
Yes, all went well. I’ll be coming.
Did son sleep?

306
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,076
Don’t take tension, I’ll take care

307
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:18,640
Rajaram
- Sir

308
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,720
Good job

309
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:25,596
Thank you Sir

310
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:31,920
Good morning Sir
- Morning

311
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:35,440
Sir
- Yes

312
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,720
Satya, right?
- Yes Sir

313
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,556
Congrats young man, you’ve done a great job
- Thank you

314
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,836
But nothing will work out if risk
is taken every time

315
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:51,116
Be careful
- Sure Sir

316
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:53,400
All the best

317
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,200
Thanks Satya, for dropping

318
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:16,076
Paddu
- Yes

319
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,516
Shall we marry?

320
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,720
Two minutes

321
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:19,076
No idea whether we’ll live together for
thousand years but will take great care of you

322
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,200
Ok for you, right?

323
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:27,756
He’s turned as a tattoo

324
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,836
He’s mixed in me warmly

325
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,440
He hugged me like ring on my feet figure

326
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,796
He walked with me as my companion

327
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,756
You met as mom in this life,
I’ll be with you forever

328
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,276
And won’t go away even in death

329
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,440
When you’re filled in heart will
we be different as you and me?

330
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:02,680
What to do? What shall I do?

331
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:07,440
I don’t get to talk seeing that smile, what to do?

332
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,076
What?
- I’m applying leave today

333
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,920
Hey, go

334
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:27,880
Sir, my son came first in running race
- Oh

335
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:29,680
Have sweet Sir - Congrats
- Thank you Sir

336
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,960
Come for lunch with your family once. My wife
is learning cooking videos from YouTube

337
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,480
Madam is doing experiments on you

338
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:39,640
One second - Yes Sir

339
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,316
Satya
- Paddu

340
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Come once to the hostel Satya
- What happened?

341
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,920
Poor warden Ramayya
- Hey, what happened?

342
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:52,720
Come once Satya
- Ok, ok

343
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,960
What happened, Sir?
- Go urgently to Seethammadhara

344
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,836
Paddu, what happened?

345
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,716
Ramayya died with heart attack, Satya.
They just took the body

346
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:16,360
Poor Swecha, they called orphanage
and they’re coming

347
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,116
Satya, I never asked you anything right?
- Yes

348
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,440
I’m asking now,
Shall we take Swecha with us?

349
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
We both know well as to how it feels
without having mom and dad

350
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,440
We both waited for someone
to come and take us

351
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:40,000
I don’t feel like leaving Swecha like that

352
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:44,800
I wish to give her a new world Satya, please

353
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,156
Yes

354
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,556
Come on

355
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:08,156
Happy birthday Paddu
- Happy birthday mom

356
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Swecha, put with this
- Come on, I know dad

357
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:40,480
Huh - Dad, look here
- Paddu

358
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,236
Satya, will you be for
thousand years with me?

359
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
Thousand years, are they enough?

360
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,840
Say

361
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:49,116
I thought you were very happy with me, Paddu.
But why did you do so?

362
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,920
Salutes Sir

363
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,000
No, no... You don’t worry Sir

364
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,156
We’ll take care of that

365
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,036
Material will be delivered tonight

366
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,116
Sir, he’s caught Sir

367
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,716
Hey, what are you seeing so idiot?

368
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,000
You kill him sir, kill him

369
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,676
Put safety on
- Don’t kill

370
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:55,236
Hey look, I’m surrendering

371
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:20,880
Stop...

372
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:32,920
Sir... Sir, where are you going Sir?

373
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,320
Sir...

374
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,840
Sir, shoot Sir

375
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:57,516
Satya...

376
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:24,036
He’s a most wanted criminal. How did you
lead without saying anyone?

377
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:30,036
Rajaram got paralysed and lost
his job just because of you

378
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,000
Satya, I said you inadvance not to take
risk as it won’t always work out

379
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:44,556
We know you’re an extreme talent but your
mental state isn’t good after your wife’s death

380
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,196
You need some rest

381
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:52,116
So, we’ve decided to suspend you for six months

382
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,236
'Back to Present'

383
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:03,880
Department isn’t believing in me.
It’s seeing me like a mad guy.

384
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,636
I’ve to prove them wrong

385
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,440
Dad, today you know? While playing .
with Kishore, he pushed me

386
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,880
When I said my dad is Police,
he immediately feared and said sorry

387
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,676
Ok, it’s late now. You go in and sleep. I and
uncle will talk - Ok, good night

388
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,596
Ok, go

389
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:48,516
Sir, you say to have spoken to that girl and
they say there’s none. What’s this Sir?

390
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:50,920
I too don’t understand that

391
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,556
They are saying flat is
closed from one month

392
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,280
But that girl is inside and
is saying very clearly about Srinivas

393
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,236
For sure, there’s some link to her
and Srinivas’s suicide

394
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,000
I’ve to catch her at any cost

395
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:42,516
Yes, ok sir

396
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,036
What would you like to have Sir?

397
00:41:58,076 --> 00:42:01,000
I need your guest records
- Guest list? Who are you?

398
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,596
Sir, my boss will be here
in the next 10 to 15 minutes

399
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,760
If they see you watching the records,
they’ll take me off the job Sir

400
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,760
Is CCTV footage there?
- There’ll be a folder named CCTV just beside Sir

401
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:20,440
What’s happening, who’s he?

402
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
Sir, ACP it seems and
asked should see CCTV footage.

403
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:25,556
When I said to wait for 10 minutes
as my boss would come, he isn’t stopping Sir

404
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,840
Excuse me, get up
- What?

405
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,196
What’s happening?

406
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
I came for the case information
- You have a search warrant?

407
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:38,156
No, but I need the CCTV footage

408
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,236
Huh, DGP is my friend. I’ll talk to him

409
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,636
Thank you

410
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:23,196
Hello Sir - Yes

411
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,596
I’m coming from department

412
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,400
I need few details about Srinivas suicide

413
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:29,440
Be seated
- Thank you

414
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,440
How was Srinivas with you before suicide?

415
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:37,716
He was very normal

416
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,320
If you know any more details...

417
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:57,036
Call on this number
- Ok

418
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,440
Oh no, is it needed to go into that flat now?

419
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I somehow managed that security guard and
brought the key Sir. Just 10 minutes, ok?

420
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,236
Ok! Come on

421
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:08,676
Sir, 2 minutes 20 seconds is over.
Client is waiting there, Sir

422
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,880
Where again, man?

423
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:20,076
Mr Olive
- Sir, Olive Green Sir

424
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:24,760
Who are all these? - These...
There’s Zumba center up and they come there Sir

425
00:46:28,196 --> 00:46:30,280
Let’s go
- Sir

426
00:46:32,076 --> 00:46:35,556
Ok and the hands... 1, 2 clockwise,
anti clockwise...

427
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,036
Now the head... 1,2,3
- She’s the instructor Sir

428
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:42,760
1,2... What am I doing and what’re you doing?
- Vani

429
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:45,000
Hi
- We’re doing fine, right madam?

430
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:49,116
Have you come again? How many times did
I say not to come holding those oil cans?

431
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:52,116
You and your oily face... Don’t you have
any shame? - Hello

432
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,400
Give respect, not me but he brought me

433
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:58,920
Hello, who are you?
- ACP

434
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:05,800
More than 100 come every day. There are 3 batches,
one in the morning and two in the evening

435
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,800
How many do I remember Sir?
- Attendance log...

436
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,156
Are you maintaining any attendance log?

437
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,840
Attendance... Yes, just a second

438
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:18,000
There’d be all in and out details in this
- Sure

439
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,880
Vani... Hi...
- Huh!

440
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:51,036
This Christina...
Who is Christina?

441
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:55,196
This girl isn’t coming now.
Even before, she used to come very irregular

442
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:00,516
If I hit you...

443
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,360
Sir, 9 minutes 40 seconds is over.
I need to go Sir

444
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,036
Thank you
- It’s ok Sir

445
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:10,076
My bottles
- Take them

446
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,596
Excuse me
- Yes

447
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,920
Christina, did she come in
the morning batch yesterday?

448
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,196
Let me check

449
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:28,196
Yes, she came.
Oh, I remembered now

450
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,480
Yesterday when she came I asked
why she wasn’t coming regularly

451
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:34,000
She said health wasn’t good
- Sir, I should go

452
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Can I get the details
- Sir, I’m talking to you

453
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,440
One second
- Yes

454
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:43,960
Oh sorry Sir, all my team are oily faces
- What?

455
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:47,036
They won’t even repair when the system is spoilt.
You give the number and I’ll send details

456
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:55,000
Go, dirty rascal

457
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:02,280
Christina...

458
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,480
Hello
- I’m Mohan Rao speaking

459
00:49:16,116 --> 00:49:19,236
Which Mohan Rao? - You came
to office in the morning and spoke, right?

460
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,076
Yes, say
- I called to share one thing with you

461
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,236
I’ve got 25 years of bonding with this company.
I took care of Srinivas like my own son

462
00:49:28,236 --> 00:49:33,000
And when heard he committed suicide,
I somehow couldn’t believe

463
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,636
I doubted something for sure has happened

464
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,076
Thus I went few times to complaint
at the Police station.

465
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,920
But there, they said case is already
closed and why do I care

466
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,880
None cared and I couldn’t
just stay still watching so

467
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,400
And thus I sent message to Police Commissioner,
media, Judge and district Collector

468
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:58,596
I don’t know how far would the information I give
help you, but recently I saw our guy with a girl many times

469
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,440
With the closeness I had, I asked him one day

470
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:07,360
Our revenue is very good in this quarter. Even that
Japan contract is like coming to us.

471
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:08,800
I’m sure about it
- Nice

472
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:12,116
Thank you

473
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,480
Son, one small thing... You won’t
mistake me, right? - Yes

474
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:20,196
I saw you recently with a girl many times.
Any good news?

475
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,840
You’re elders in age

476
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,556
You know your limits well,
I don’t think should say you

477
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,716
I felt his behavior somehow strange

478
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,116
Thus I’m saying it with you

479
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:35,556
Where did you see that girl?

480
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,556
Thank you

481
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,960
Hey... Hey...

482
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,960
Your body looks great to see.
This sets correctly for massage

483
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:06,840
Will the hair come? Go man

484
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,840
Oh no, our ACP...
Sir, what are you doing here?

485
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,636
I saw that girl
- Girl...

486
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,196
Which girl Sir?
- That girl I saw in the flat

487
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,760
What, you saw our ghost? Where Sir?

488
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,636
Hey come to a side, what in the traffic?

489
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:33,840
You’ve seen right? This is the deed
by a suspended Police Officer

490
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,236
He made a mess saying
to have seen ghost in the auto

491
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,716
Common public is questioning how when Police
to safeguard peace and safety does so?

492
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,440
Let’s wait and see how our
Police department responds on this

493
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:49,076
I really saw that girl Sir,
she’s escaping and moving around

494
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:52,840
And Sir, Srinivas’s isn’t a suicide
- Satya, I’ve already warned you

495
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,556
That case is closed.
You are making an issue unnecessarily

496
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,360
Now TV people repeatedly plays
that clip and say Police are a waste

497
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:07,196
Sir, there’s CCTV footage to show Srinivas
was with that girl in party that day

498
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,156
And if you give permission, I will
- Stop it Satya

499
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:17,320
This is my last and final warning. If this topic comes
before me once again, I‘ll take serious action on you

500
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:19,320
You may leave now

501
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,760
Yes - Are you srinivas’s wife?
- Yes

502
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:39,000
Where did you write, on this mirror?

503
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,516
I asked her yesterday when she came as to why
she isn’t coming regularly. She said health isn’t fine

504
00:53:48,636 --> 00:53:52,320
When I heard he committed suicide,
I somehow couldn’t believe

505
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:58,116
It’s a suicide Satya and the case is closed

506
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:05,400
Let anyone believe me or not,
I’ll somehow solve this mystery

507
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:15,360
Who do you want Sir?

508
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:23,676
Yesterday at about 11, a girl with a black scarf
got into an auto, who is she?

509
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,156
She used to live in the penthouse
and left vacating this morning

510
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,596
Did she vacate?
- Yes Sir

511
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,400
You know where is she now?
- How will we know, Sir?

512
00:54:36,116 --> 00:54:37,676
Can I see the flat?
- Not possible Sir

513
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:40,480
It’ll be a problem if our people
see, not possible Sir.

514
00:54:40,716 --> 00:54:41,676
No sir...

515
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:23,280
What’s this dude?
- I said, right Ravi? Still, none of you are believing

516
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,440
What’s there in this? There’s Romeo, Juliet.
I don’t understand anything

517
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:32,400
Ravi, she’s trying to communicate something.
She says me as Romeo and she’s Juliet

518
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:34,000
Damn! Isn’t it any Laila Majnu?

519
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:37,000
Did you call me so urgently to say this?

520
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,156
Sandhya is waiting at home and
I need to take her out

521
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:42,716
Boss Satya... It’s you

522
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,440
I’ll prove you. One second

523
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:09,760
Ravi, see this.
This is my 7th class photograph

524
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:12,516
She’s Paddu and we both
are from the same class

525
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,880
Listen Ravi, now it gets interesting.
Look at her

526
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,800
Only this girl used to call me Romeo.
She’s Juliet, Ravi

527
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,556
I just remembered. That annual day we played
Romeo Juliet. I was Romeo and she was Juliet

528
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,800
And exactly that same day night, she went missing.
None knows where she went, Ravi

529
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,156
Ravi, the girl I’m searching for
and this girl are the same

530
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,960
Stop it, just stop it

531
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:39,360
Ravi - What 7th class,
what is Romeo Juliet play and what’s that girl?

532
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,116
What’s her relation to this case?
Won’t you leave this case? Damn!

533
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:51,116
Satya, I know. You can’t forget
Paddu so easily. It’ll take time

534
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,400
You’d been to Goa for forty days right? Go elsewhere
in the same way. Try to forget her

535
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,516
I know it’s tough, please.
Be peaceful and let me be peaceful

536
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:08,516
Yeah, starting. Bye dude, bye

537
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,516
I’m coming

538
00:58:37,036 --> 00:58:40,000
Only this girl used to call me Romeo
- Romeo

539
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:21,036
Excuse me madam
- Yes

540
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:25,400
Please say
- Did you identify madam? Satya

541
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,676
Which Satya?

542
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:35,800
Satya Dev, studied here till 10th. I didn’t have interest in
Mathematics and you made me take up that subject.

543
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,440
Yes, Satya come. Sit down, be seated

544
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,596
Thank you madam

545
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,960
So, how are you Satya?
- I’m good

546
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:47,116
What are you doing now?
- ACP

547
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,400
Oh, Police? Good

548
00:59:50,236 --> 00:59:52,760
So, would you like to have anything?
Coffee, Tea...

549
00:59:53,196 --> 00:59:54,880
No, I’m fine. Thank you
- Ok

550
00:59:55,156 --> 00:59:59,716
Your batch often come and visits.
You haven’t attended any Alumni meetings.

551
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,400
Did you identify this girl madam?

552
01:00:09,036 --> 01:00:14,000
15 years back, she had to play Juliet in Romeo-Juliet play.
But, in the last minute she was replaced with Paddu

553
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,596
She was never again seen in
the school and said she ran away

554
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,076
What exactly happened to her?
Do you have any clue?

555
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:31,156
Students, topic being given to your class
this time for annual day is Shakespeare

556
01:00:31,516 --> 01:00:35,000
So, let’s do the Romeo-Juliet play.
Who’ll be the Romeo?

557
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,116
Satya, you play the Romeo role
- Ok madam

558
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,960
And, who is the Juliet
- Ma’am

559
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,920
Paddu, not you.

560
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:53,960
Let’s give a chance to...
That girl... You do the Juliet

561
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:00,636
Look into that line carefully, next is you
- Ok

562
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,716
Madam
- Yes

563
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,480
You got a call - Is it?
- Yes - Ok

564
01:01:28,636 --> 01:01:33,880
Thinking school reputation gets damaged if
that matter is out, we managed at the Police

565
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:38,196
In my entire career,
that’s the only bad experience I had

566
01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:39,400
Thank you madam

567
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,480
Who’s that girl?

568
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,076
Who’s she?

569
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,636
She comes across

570
01:01:55,636 --> 01:01:56,480
As a mystery

571
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,760
Who’s that?

572
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:25,280
The girl shaking

573
01:02:26,116 --> 01:02:30,320
Is she the remembrance of
past or answer of future?

574
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,760
Curtains raised and seen

575
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,280
Like a lightening, where did she vanish?

576
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,840
Heart beat fast and confusion on, time is gone

577
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:47,196
It’s hard enough

578
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,156
Heart beat fast and life shivered,
didn't identify

579
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,440
Heart is swinging

580
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,036
Satya, I’ve been trying from two days
and no response. Where did you go?

581
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,116
You went searching for that Juliet, right?

582
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,236
Satya, you are going mad

583
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:44,116
You are unnecessarily trying to
connect two random dots

584
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:47,596
I don’t know what’s the link in
between Srinivas’s murder and Juliet

585
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:51,556
And to Paddu’s death,
there is no relation at all

586
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,156
It’s just an incident.
May have fallen slipping by leg, right?

587
01:03:56,076 --> 01:03:58,400
I think, you are trying to prove
something by connecting these two

588
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:01,236
It just doesn’t work that way, trust me

589
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,116
Satya, when our loved ones die before our eyes...
I think I can understand that pain

590
01:04:15,076 --> 01:04:18,076
It’s time you move on,
you have a bright future

591
01:04:18,636 --> 01:04:21,636
What did you say Ravi?
You can understand my pain?

592
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,400
When the girl I loved more than
my life died in front of my eyes...

593
01:04:29,596 --> 01:04:32,840
How that pain is...
I’m sure you can’t understand, Ravi

594
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,716
I don’t know about my bright future

595
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:42,556
I promised her, Ravi

596
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,556
To safeguard her very carefully

597
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,196
I gave a word

598
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,196
I’m a loser now

599
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:03,760
What did you just say, Ravi?
It is just an accident?

600
01:05:05,236 --> 01:05:08,116
Maybe even I’d thought the same
if I hadn’t touched Srinivas’s case

601
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,920
Either you support as a friend or leave it

602
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,156
But never, ever call that an accidental death

603
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,116
Please... Never...

604
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,716
What are you thinking to do now?

605
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,636
See this

606
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,480
So, are you meeting Juliet
tomorrow at the mosque?

607
01:07:35,236 --> 01:07:36,196
Paddu

608
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:41,840
She spoke to you at March 22nd party.
Do you remember?

609
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:46,156
She was on very high that day in party.
She asked rest room directions

610
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,000
When a person arrived, she left with him

611
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:52,400
What? Do you remember who it was?

612
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:55,880
I don’t exactly remember.
But, I can recognize seeing him

613
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,036
Why, what happened?

614
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,676
What exactly is your name?

615
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,480
You say Juliet and move
in the burkha (Black dress)

616
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,076
And when went to school,
wardens said you ran away

617
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,236
Who exactly are you?

618
01:08:08,716 --> 01:08:11,236
I’ll say Satya, I’ll say everything

619
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:18,436
I was most happy that day than all

620
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,036
After getting ready,
while I was coming from hostel...

621
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:32,680
Why are you so beautiful today, dear?

622
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,520
Sir, what’s it Sir?

623
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,076
No...

624
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,236
I did to save myself but not wantedly

625
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,356
None cared though I was saying

626
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,436
When said to call the Police,
I got frightened and ran away

627
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:24,800
When you ran away
why did you return back again?

628
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,156
You were in Srinivas’s flat that day. What exactly
is the relation between you and Srinivas?

629
01:09:34,276 --> 01:09:37,880
It isn’t in anyone’s hands about when
and where would the life lead

630
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,196
Similarly I too entered unexpectedly
into Srinivas’s life

631
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,760
Excuse me
- Yes

632
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,276
Are you Christina?

633
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,600
Huh!

634
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,800
So, why are you messaging me?

635
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:08,840
I saw your interview recently in
Times of India. I liked it very much

636
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,476
Innovations you are doing in
Pharma industry are just amazing

637
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,476
So, I fixed to do a job just in your company

638
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,560
I’m texting to know if
there are any job openings

639
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,760
What, you texted me for job?
- Yeah

640
01:10:27,316 --> 01:10:29,680
If there are any openings,
we mention on our website

641
01:10:30,316 --> 01:10:33,436
If your qualifications match us,
you get a call from HR team

642
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,600
I found

643
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,356
Can you keep up?

644
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,436
It’s ok

645
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,560
Yeah

646
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,116
Baby, I always wish to be like this

647
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,116
Shall we get married?
- Marriage? - Yes

648
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:46,156
Why so fast? I have some professional goals

649
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,316
I should take business to a range.
I should see my name in the top businessmen list of India

650
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,680
It’ll take some time.
It may take at least 4 to 5 years

651
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:03,036
Why so much anger?
- I said right, I want to be just with you

652
01:13:04,036 --> 01:13:11,436
Not like that, if I say marriage now, my uncles
will think I’ve no interest on business and lost focus

653
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,036
They’ll try to take my position
and I don’t like that

654
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,600
But... I have an idea

655
01:13:23,476 --> 01:13:24,196
What?

656
01:13:26,196 --> 01:13:28,396
Like that I said Christina and joined in Zumba

657
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,640
We started a secret relationship without
anyone from the flats knowing that

658
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,196
We both were very happy

659
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:27,920
He even planned dinner on March 22nd night.
I too thought to give him a surprise

660
01:14:28,396 --> 01:14:32,116
But that day...
I came to know what he really was

661
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:41,840
Srinivas along with a few big shots, basing on his
Pharmaceutical Company in city is manufacturing Mandrax pills

662
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,640
They’re exporting to foreign countries.
Crores of business is running

663
01:14:47,356 --> 01:14:50,000
I asked the same matter that day after the party

664
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,476
Come out

665
01:15:13,356 --> 01:15:15,640
What happened to you, why are you like that?

666
01:15:19,396 --> 01:15:22,236
See baby, ask me right away
if there is anything to be asked

667
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,000
But don’t be serious like this
- You know what, it’s my mistake

668
01:15:27,076 --> 01:15:32,960
Continuing my feeling from childhood,
I came till here searching for you, I was a fool

669
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,760
I thought you were a good guy. But I just came
to know that you’re running a dark empire in mask

670
01:15:42,196 --> 01:15:45,036
I wished to give you a surprise
- What is that?

671
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,000
My name isn’t Christina
- What?

672
01:15:50,236 --> 01:15:56,720
Do you remember? Romeo-Juliet play in childhood
in 7th class, you were Romeo and I was Juliet

673
01:15:57,436 --> 01:15:59,680
What Romeo and what Juliet?
What are you talking?

674
01:16:00,316 --> 01:16:06,920
Didn’t you still remember? St. Anns School, when all
were teasing me as I came newly, you blocked them all

675
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:16,960
Hold on, wait a minute! Let me think.
My name is Srinivas, Satya Srinivas Kakrla

676
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:20,560
What? - I don’t understand
at all about what you’re talking

677
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:41,000
Ok! Wait, wait a minute. There was a guy named
Satya in school and was very active in cultural activities

678
01:16:43,276 --> 01:16:45,560
A girl ran away those days from school,
was that you?

679
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Satya Dev! You came to me, mistaking for him

680
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,356
This is classic, man. I mean, this is crazy.
Oh poor girl!

681
01:17:08,436 --> 01:17:11,316
Listen to me darling, let me make
one thing clear to you

682
01:17:12,076 --> 01:17:18,316
My name is Srinivas and I’m definitely
not your Romeo. Understood?

683
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,920
What? You got close to Srinivas
mistaking for me?

684
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:36,680
He took you so casual. Then what was the need
for Srinivas to commit suicide that day?

685
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,560
Hey, babe
- Just leave my hand

686
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,520
You came in touch with me
- Leave me

687
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:47,356
You got closer and going away now in anger
- Leave

688
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,116
Is it all, your wish?
- I said leave

689
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:52,036
We anyways came close
and we’re having fun

690
01:17:53,116 --> 01:17:54,076
Do you think I am a slut?

691
01:17:56,356 --> 01:17:59,600
Damn!
- This is the problem with you girls

692
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,840
Mellow drama for every small thing
- Leave... Just leave me

693
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,196
Come on
- Just go away

694
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,800
No...

695
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,680
I killed Srinivas like that accidentally

696
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:31,276
I thought to surrender myself to the Police

697
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,600
But after two days I saw in News
that it was suicide

698
01:18:37,236 --> 01:18:38,356
And then I too let that go

699
01:18:39,076 --> 01:18:41,196
But, I came to know that
the case got reopened

700
01:18:41,476 --> 01:18:45,316
I thought there were no evidences left behind
to show I and Srinivas had a relation

701
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,356
Suddenly I remembered that there was a photo
of me and Srinivas in his cupboard

702
01:18:51,276 --> 01:18:54,920
I came again to Srinivas’s flat
in a fear that it may fall out

703
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,760
You came for investigation
at the same time and I met you

704
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:17,720
I thought to meet you and give this

705
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,920
What is this?
- No idea, I don’t exactly know

706
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,760
I came to know that it was very important
for Srinivas, in that day’s party

707
01:19:30,036 --> 01:19:33,396
Thus after I hit Srinivas and ran away,
I brought this with me

708
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,236
I understood that all behind this
will definitely fall out

709
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,076
They are following me knowing
that this is with me

710
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,880
Thus I got frightened and shifted my flat

711
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,356
I’ll keep this

712
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,640
Come, let’s go
- No, I can’t

713
01:20:38,356 --> 01:20:39,800
Bullet hit and we got to take to hospital

714
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:45,436
Satya

715
01:20:48,316 --> 01:20:49,276
Give your phone.

716
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,396
Join in care hospital beside
- Ok Sir

717
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,520
I’ll call
- Go, go

718
01:21:18,436 --> 01:21:19,236
Shafi

719
01:21:35,076 --> 01:21:35,920
Ravi
- Hey Satya

720
01:21:36,076 --> 01:21:38,116
Where is Dalvi Sir?
- Why, what happened?

721
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:41,960
Where Ravi? - Oh, he is inside on some
important call and asked not to disturb for one hour

722
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,800
Hey Satya - Ok, I’ll take care of it,
No problem - Sir

723
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,880
Satya, I’m in an important call
- Sir, I need to talk for two minutes

724
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,560
Sir, it’s an emergency. Can I call you later?
- Yeah, sure

725
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,520
Sir, they shot Juliet
- Who is Juliet?

726
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:01,880
The girl I’m searching for
- Who shot her?

727
01:22:02,236 --> 01:22:03,316
Gangster Shafi

728
01:22:04,276 --> 01:22:06,920
Why did that gangster Shafi shoot that girl?

729
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,960
Sir, it’s all connected to a drug syndicate

730
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,076
And Juliet said all big shots like
Srinivas are into that

731
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,680
Srinivas means that Phoenix Company owner, right?
- Yes Sir

732
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,196
And Sir, Srinivas’s isn’t a suicide
but murder by Juliet in self defense

733
01:22:21,156 --> 01:22:24,436
Satya, I already gave you a warning
to leave this case

734
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,800
Now, you are saying a new story as drug syndicate.
You think I’m a fool?

735
01:22:28,036 --> 01:22:33,196
Sir, believe me. Give me one last chance.
Juliet is in hospital Sir

736
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:37,276
Satya, this is your last chance.
Ravi, come on - Sir

737
01:22:48,436 --> 01:22:49,236
Please come Sir

738
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,720
Excuse me
- Yes Sir

739
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,036
Yesterday, a girl was brought to hospital
with bullet wound. In which ward is she?

740
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:59,720
Sorry Sir - In black dress, a girl
was brought here with bullet wound on shoulder

741
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,276
In which ward is she?
- No Sir, I’m here from the morning shift

742
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:04,600
No girl as such has came Sir

743
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:13,880
Sir, one second Sir

744
01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:20,000
What happened? - I just
had spoken Sir. It’s coming as switched off now

745
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,560
It isn’t your mistake Satya. It’s my mistake
to have come here giving you importance

746
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,236
Sir, believe me Sir
- Sir

747
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,276
Ravi
- Mental

748
01:23:34,036 --> 01:23:34,760
Damn!

749
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,236
Not just in personal life Rajaram,
I failed even in profession

750
01:23:46,236 --> 01:23:47,600
She missed out in front of my eyes, Rajaram

751
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:54,920
I can’t show up my face again to the Commissioner

752
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,680
I’m a loser now. But still I won’t leave

753
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,036
I will pull out every idiot into this.
I won’t leave

754
01:24:05,076 --> 01:24:07,396
Sir, did that girl give you any lead?

755
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,316
She gave this
- What’s that Sir?

756
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,840
Some waste, waste rubbish

757
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,000
Waste, damn!

758
01:24:25,156 --> 01:24:32,116
Sir, if you really treat me as your friend,
I’ll say you one thing Sir

759
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,680
See baby there for once Sir

760
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,116
Baby has slept so happily and peaceful Sir

761
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:47,116
It’s a small assurance that you are there, Sir

762
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,196
She’s been waiting that
you’d come and take her

763
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,276
Listen to me and leave with this Sir

764
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:13,000
Hey, it’s closed long back and there
isn’t anything to investigate

765
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,720
He texted to have committed suicide
and died

766
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:25,236
I killed Srinivas, but saw it as suicide
in news after two days

767
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:43,520
Satya, what at this time?

768
01:25:45,316 --> 01:25:46,156
What happened, dude?

769
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,560
Hey, I’m asking you dude

770
01:26:03,436 --> 01:26:05,600
What dude, is everything ok?

771
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,600
Satya - Juliet said to have
hit Srinivas on the head with bottle

772
01:26:17,116 --> 01:26:18,640
But the reports...

773
01:26:23,356 --> 01:26:27,316
It’s as he cut the wrist and
committed suicide

774
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,680
What dude? Do you doubt me?

775
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,640
None other than me and
you know that I was meeting Juliet

776
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,520
You won’t understand even if I say now.
We shall talk tomorrow

777
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,196
How much did you take? What’s your
link with Srinivas’s business?

778
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,760
Are you mad, idiot? Isn’t it down yet?

779
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:02,316
Nothing, I and Satya are talking.
You go and sleep

780
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:14,000
Yes man, yes. I spoke with that Doctor and changed
the postmortem report. I created it as suicide.

781
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,196
But there isn’t any link to me and
that Srinivas’s business as you think

782
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:24,316
I did all this for my son. They kidnapped him and
threatened to kill if I don’t close the case as suicide

783
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,076
But, I’m not sold out as you think

784
01:27:33,436 --> 01:27:36,640
Satya... Satya... Satya...

785
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:55,760
Hey Police, are you surprised thinking that the girl
vanished in front of your eyes? - Satya

786
01:27:57,436 --> 01:27:59,840
No time, just one hour

787
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,680
If the bullet from the girl’s shoulder
isn’t taken out, girl is dead - Satya

788
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,840
Give back the slip which this girl gave you

789
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:12,880
Hey, that isn’t with me. I tore it away

790
01:28:13,236 --> 01:28:16,880
What? You tore it. Super!

791
01:28:18,036 --> 01:28:23,116
Hey, stop playing tricks and come to
the factory at container yard with that slip

792
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:45,640
Welcome
- Where is Juliet? - Juliet?

793
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,396
That is a Juliet and you are
a Romeo and what am I, idiot?

794
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:58,840
Am I Alibaba? Hey Police, you know
one thing? I too am a small Doctor

795
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,600
I tied a cloth to the girl’s hand
for stopping the blood loss

796
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,640
I tied the cloth and kept her
in a drum from these

797
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,520
Half an hour... Maximum. Give me
my slip and take your Juliet away

798
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,356
I don’t have that slip and where is Juliet?

799
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:31,036
Daddy..
- Rajaram

800
01:29:31,476 --> 01:29:34,396
I shot him thinking
that fellow is shooting you, Sir

801
01:29:39,196 --> 01:29:40,640
Swecha, come here
- Hey...

802
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:44,076
I’ll shoot her if you come close
- Don’t harm her

803
01:29:44,476 --> 01:29:47,356
Say the number. Say the number
and take her and this girl

804
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,760
Which number Rajaram?
- Hey, are you playing dramas?

805
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,356
You just tore down the number
into pieces, right?

806
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,116
Say the number and take her
- Swecha, come here

807
01:30:04,396 --> 01:30:05,476
Leave... Daddy...

808
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,276
You play games, right?
- Yes

809
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,000
I’ll shoot your daddy if you move from here

810
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,236
You be right here, I’ll go talk to your dad
and come. Ok? - Ok

811
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,356
Did it burn? It burnt the same even for me

812
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,076
No way out Satya Sir, I’m sorry.
There was no way out

813
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,640
There are three letters in your name,
ACP... Assistant Commissioner of Police

814
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:44,000
You get respect automatically. I too have the same
three letters, ASI... Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police

815
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:47,356
That means a person like dog in the department.
Don’t you understand?

816
01:30:48,036 --> 01:30:52,156
I’ve been in the same position from 15 years.
I wished to do some miracles in the department

817
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,396
I worked hard like a dog. I couldn’t close
any case properly at least for once. Why, why?

818
01:31:00,436 --> 01:31:04,116
I caught the criminal, wrote case, arrested and filed report.

819
01:31:04,356 --> 01:31:08,076
But, with pressure from higher official or
politician or with some pressure, I let him go

820
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:11,316
Srinivas idiot, that drug dealer...
What happened in his matter? The same

821
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:16,000
I wrote case, filed FIR and when I thought to arrest, you know
what did that Commissioner of Police said?

822
01:31:16,236 --> 01:31:17,680
Is it you, who asked for appointment?

823
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,436
Yes Sir, I’ve been trying from one month Sir.
- Come on sit - Thank you Sir

824
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,196
What is the matter?

825
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:32,600
Manufacturing Mandrax pills in unexpected quantity in our city
and are not just supplying in local but are exporting them Sir

826
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,476
This is about 1500 to 2000 Crores business yearly Sir

827
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,196
It’s influence is very high on our city youth, Sir

828
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:43,520
It is easily available from high school students
to the PG students, Sir. Poor kids Sir

829
01:31:44,236 --> 01:31:46,476
And thus, I personally investigated Sir

830
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:52,640
Sir, his name is Srinivas Kakarla.
This is the main person behind the business Sir

831
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,800
If you give permission, I’ll directly raid
and get him caught red handed Sir

832
01:31:58,116 --> 01:32:00,076
What name did you say?
- Srinivas Kakarla, Sir

833
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:01,840
Your name
- Rajaram Sir

834
01:32:02,196 --> 01:32:04,396
How long are you in the department from?
- I’m there from 15 years Sir

835
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,800
If you’re so exactly, you’ll be the same
even for the next 10 years

836
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,436
Who is your CI?
- Sir, Ravi Sir

837
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,476
Call him

838
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,800
Hello
- Sir, I’m Rajaram

839
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,920
Ok, say
- Sir, it seems Commissioner Sir will talk

840
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,196
Your ASI has come to talk regarding a case
- That fellow is a joker Sir

841
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,076
He brings in something in emotion and when
we go and look into, there’d be nothing in it

842
01:32:33,316 --> 01:32:35,196
I’ll take care Sir, you leave that
- Ok

843
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,436
Joker!

844
01:32:42,196 --> 01:32:45,920
Every human needs another extra thing along
with the basic necessities, what is that?

845
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,396
Self-respect... Self-respect

846
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:52,760
Every day when I stood before the mirror,
I used to feel ashamed of myself

847
01:32:53,076 --> 01:32:55,000
I used to feel what the hell this life is

848
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,920
Almost I gave up

849
01:33:05,196 --> 01:33:09,316
Hello - Rajaram, sincere guy
never has a value in this world

850
01:33:10,396 --> 01:33:14,840
You made a report against me.
But I don’t have any anger on you

851
01:33:15,196 --> 01:33:19,000
So, I’ll come straight to the point. We worked
so long without any links with department

852
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,196
But now, if a guy joins hands with us from
the same department, we’ll rule the market

853
01:33:26,116 --> 01:33:29,316
We’ll give you an identity which you don’t
have there, along with the money

854
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,436
Are you ready to work with us?
- I got another chance in life again

855
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,760
I joined with Srinivas

856
01:33:45,396 --> 01:33:48,920
I didn’t have in the department,
but here I have an identity for myself

857
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,076
How many containers?
20 containers? Ready

858
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,036
Whenever you want,
I will... Shipment immediately...

859
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:00,076
What money man... Money...
You give it later. No problem... Done

860
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,476
Did you inform Srinivas?
- Who is Srinivas, man?

861
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,076
My foot Srinivas! Does that idiot know business?
Business grew after I came, right?

862
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,840
Just follow me and that’s enough

863
01:34:14,236 --> 01:34:20,076
But in that day’s party, I set deal with Harry idiot.
I said to give him that shipment number

864
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,960
Srinivas asked you for 200 Crores
- Yes

865
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,356
Give me 50, I’ll give you the shipment number
- Ok man

866
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,520
Deal
- Deal

867
01:34:46,156 --> 01:34:51,316
Your consignment is ready, my friend. Whenever you transfer
me the money, I’ll give you the shipment number

868
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:56,000
I’ll wire you the money in two days

869
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,520
Ok then, I too will give you
this number after two days

870
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,316
What’re you seeing so? You too need it?

871
01:35:09,316 --> 01:35:10,396
I’m observing you from so long

872
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,960
What, are you doing a setting with Harry?

873
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:20,196
Ok, it seems you are saying to our boys that Srinivas is
now a waste and you are doing the whole show?

874
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,560
Srinivas, you are drunk and
we shall talk tomorrow in the morning

875
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,760
Hey, what Srinivas? Call me with respect Mr. Srinivas

876
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,680
Still, it isn’t your mistake, idiot.

877
01:35:31,116 --> 01:35:37,396
I brought a street dog. I forgot that dog
does have a tail which always is curved

878
01:35:39,156 --> 01:35:43,960
I never expected that Dog one day
would try to loot away my position

879
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,000
Does he say Dog?

880
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:54,560
Then I decided to somehow finish
that Srinivas idiot

881
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,000
I saw Srinivas and his girlfriend talking there

882
01:36:10,156 --> 01:36:12,520
Suddenly, his girlfriend hit with bottle
on his head and ran away

883
01:36:13,276 --> 01:36:14,076
I went to him

884
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,560
I threatened Ravi, kidnapped his son

885
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,680
I threatened him and closed it as suicide case

886
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,000
I thought how to give up this bloody job.
It then struck to me

887
01:36:50,196 --> 01:36:52,600
I asked Shafi in that day’s operation to shoot me

888
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,720
Shoot me...

889
01:36:57,316 --> 01:36:59,960
You returned from Goa at that same time

890
01:37:00,316 --> 01:37:03,880
You started the investigation. You said
the good news to have seen Srinivas’s girlfriend

891
01:37:04,156 --> 01:37:08,840
Not knowing the container number, that same
bloody ship is waiting in Nigeria port from a month

892
01:37:09,036 --> 01:37:14,000
That Harry is been waiting for that.
Shafi is been following you

893
01:37:14,356 --> 01:37:16,396
You said, the girl missed out at the signal.
You remember?

894
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:21,316
That night, Shafi had to close her
and brought that till here

895
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,000
Hey, tell that shipment number idiot

896
01:37:53,196 --> 01:37:54,076
Help

897
01:39:06,076 --> 01:39:07,640
Satya... Satya...

898
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:14,116
It was this fellow who took Paddu
that day at the party

899
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,720
What are you saying? Are you sure?

900
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,840
I saw with my eyes and this was that fellow

901
01:39:46,156 --> 01:39:47,116
What did you do to my Paddu?

902
01:39:53,316 --> 01:39:56,476
Nice party
- Yeah...

903
01:39:57,076 --> 01:40:01,396
Hey man, I need an Indian girl tonight

904
01:40:02,236 --> 01:40:03,196
Yeah?
- Yeah

905
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,236
Say, whom do you want?

906
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,600
Which girl?
- Girl in cream dress

907
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,236
Paddu, let’s dance
- No, no you go and I’ll stay back

908
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,640
Done

909
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,036
You go, I’ll come
- Ok, you stay. I’ll go

910
01:41:45,036 --> 01:41:47,600
He got the answer needed in 47 days.

911
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,640
But there are still many more questions.

912
01:41:50,116 --> 01:41:51,760
But he wishes to keep all those questions aside...

913
01:41:52,236 --> 01:41:55,276
and want to live with his daughter
along with Paddu's memories.

914
01:42:00,196 --> 01:42:02,356
Say Ravi
- What dude, didn’t inform to be going?

915
01:42:03,196 --> 01:42:05,316
Isn’t the anger on me still gone down?
- Nothing Ravi

916
01:42:06,276 --> 01:42:09,196
This place and this house are
reminding me of Paddu

917
01:42:11,236 --> 01:42:18,396
I couldn’t bear... And thus I,
baby are leaving to Mumbai

918
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:24,196
Ok dude, be careful. I’m happy
that you’re moving on. Take care

919
01:42:28,116 --> 01:42:29,680
Baby, pack your stuff

920
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:41,720
Satya, I wish you’d read this letter sometime.

921
01:42:42,276 --> 01:42:46,036
I don’t understand the incident
from yesterday night at party

922
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:54,760
Maybe you’d understand if I say.
But I don’t feel would be happy lifelong by sharing that with you

923
01:42:55,236 --> 01:42:56,960
Take care of Swecha, love you

924
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,520
Daddy

925
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,720
Yeah

926
01:43:08,316 --> 01:43:09,076
Love you
