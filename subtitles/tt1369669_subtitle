1
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,007
You don't listen
to one thing I say.

2
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,235
You told me you'll take
me to Dubai for shopping.

3
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,367
And you took your wife with you.

4
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:05,835
Darling, that is my
social responsibility.

5
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,335
What about me?
- You are my love.

6
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,267
Car parking.
- Sir, your keys.

7
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,836
Yes. No. Look, don't damage the car.

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,269
Don't drive fast. There
shouldn't be a scratch.

9
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,834
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,967
Here.

11
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,300
Hey.

12
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,001
Thief. Thief. Thief. Thief.

13
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,567
He ran away with my car.

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,236
Yes, Alex. Yes, your
car is red in colour.

15
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,968
Am I doing it for the first time?
Just keep the money ready.

16
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,502
And yes, this time I don't
want a deduction of Rs.5000.

17
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,100
I'm at my usual place.

18
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,034
I'll be there in two hours.
Hang up now.

19
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,167
Hey come on.

20
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,436
Natasha. Hi, Natasha.
Where have you been?

21
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,567
Excuse me.

22
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,967
Natasha?
- No.

23
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,836
Oh, yeah. Natasha
doesn't look so good.

24
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,568
Anyway, I am Veeru.
What's your name?

25
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,567
Balwinder.

26
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,967
Balwinder.

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,401
Your papa must
have named you, right?

28
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,200
How do you know?

29
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,568
Anyway. Can I offer you a drink?

30
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,234
No, thanks. I don't drink.

31
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,902
I don't drink either.
Our habits are so similar.

32
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,502
Just as well. Drinking
isn't good for health, anyway.

33
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,301
Yes, but dancing is good for health.

34
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,135
Shall we? Come on. Let's
go and dance. Come on.

35
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,567
Come on. Come on.

36
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,900
Sorry. Come on.

37
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,435
Where are you going?
- I'm going to dance with this girl.

38
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,100
You'll dance.

39
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:33,967
You are a hero.

40
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,901
You're pushing me in
front of this girl.

41
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,367
You!

42
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,900
Brother.

43
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,367
Brother?

44
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,400
All four are your brothers?

45
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,333
Why didn't you tell me before?

46
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,034
We could have all
danced together. We...

47
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,567
You dropped my drink.

48
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,503
Yes. You dropped his drink.
You dropped his drink.

49
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,934
They all three of them did.

50
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,167
Come on. Let's leave.

51
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,937
Super. Thanks. I know
they dropped your drink.

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,067
Let me buy you one.

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,835
Sure.
- By the way, I'm Veeru.

54
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,569
Jai.
- Jai. Veeru. Jai. Veeru.

55
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,907
My darling smeared colours on me.

56
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:08,375
The dressmaker adorned
my attire with diamonds.

57
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:16,240
My skirt became
famous among lovers.

58
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:25,174
The skirt from Agra.

59
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,902
Come, check it.

60
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:58,508

64
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:15,437
The skirt from Agra.

65
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,902
Your eyelashes are beautiful.

66
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,934
Your eyes are kohl.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,001
Your breath is fragrant.

68
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,168
Your fragrance is tantalising.

69
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:48,236
My skirt. My skirt. My skirt.

70
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,368
Your eyelashes are beautiful.

71
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,501

Your fragrance is tantalizing.

74
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,301
Your face is marvellous.

75
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,334
Your youth is torturous.

76
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,270
Your charm is treacherous.

77
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,837
Your silk handkerchief.

78
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,837
You wore your silk
handkerchief around your neck.

79
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:21,970

00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:26,303

You are a smoldering furnace.

88

89
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,435
Your gait is mesmerising.

90
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,902
You are a smoldering furnace.

91
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,101
You've come from heaven.

92
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,167
You've brought merriment along.

93
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:39,270
You've enwrapped my thoughts.

94
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:43,437
Your silk handkerchief.

110
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,900
Come on. You want to
get something to eat?

111
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,534
Do you have a car?
- Yes. Lady in red.

112
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,836
Sir, he is the man who stole my car.

113
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,568
Jai, run. Police. Run.

114
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:01,900
Constable, follow him.

115
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,102
Did you steal that red car?
- No. I borrowed it.

116
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,233
What are you doing?

117
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,901
Now I'm stealing a car.

118
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,901
Hurry up. You don't have much time.

119
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,367
Get down.

120
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,500
Check there.

121
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:24,534
If I had the key, it
would have saved us time.

122
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,900
What do you mean?

123
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,033
This is the first time you're
stealing a car without a key?

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,302
Don't make me nervous.
The police are after me.

125
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,433
And you're asking me questions.

126
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,567
Why? Would you
rather answer the police?

127
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,900
Move.

128
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,567
Come on. Hurry up.

129
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:49,902
Pandu. Come here quickly.
He is there.

130
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,500
Come on. Come on.

131
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,234
Yes.
- Do you also steal cars?

132
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,567
I'm a mechanic.

133
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,567
Cheers.
- Cheers.

134
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:10,533
Partner.

135
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:15,169
You're still an amateur in
the business of stealing cars.

136
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,969
That's because earlier
I used to fly planes.

137
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,333
Plane?

138
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,234
But where did you sell it?

139
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:33,905
Sell? I mean, I really used to
fly it. I was a pilot trainee.

140
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,568
Oh.
- Yes.

141
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,868
Pilot trainee?

142
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:43,234
So how come you're in this field?

143
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:45,834
Because of romance.

144
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,367
I don't understand.

145
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,901
The girl's father
turned out to be my boss.

146
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,438
He found out. I lost
the girl and my job too.

147
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:00,102
Very, very, very sad.

148
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,569
But I think you're a professional.

149
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,234
My family is no more.

150
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,934
I am all alone.

151
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:17,967
Very sad.

152
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,938
But Jai, don't worry.
Now I'm your family.

153
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't understand.

154
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,467
What is there to understand?

155
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,569
I mean, now you are my brother.

156
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,302
No, no, no.
- No?

157
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,335
You are my brother.

158
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,835
I said it, so you are my brother.

159
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,869
You are my brother.
- You are my brother.

160
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,467
Shall I call Balwinder's brother?

161
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,903
Don't call him.
Fine. I'm your brother.

162
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,236
Not because I'm scared
of Balwinder's brothers.

163
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:58,036
I will catch them and
throw them in the gutter...

164
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,167
Veeru.

165
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,268
Veeru, are you fine?

166
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:07,068
Brother, my head is spinning.

167
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,034
Hold on to the ground.

168
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,900
Brother.
- What?

169
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,501
The ground is
spinning as well, Brother.

170
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,102
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It happens. It happens. - Okay.

171
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:26,102
Splash some cold water on
your face. It'll sober you up.

172
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,234
Okay. Okay.

173
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,134
Fine, Jai.
- Good.

174
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:34,535
Shall I tell you something, Jai?
Liquor is really bad.

175
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,901
I'll never drink again.

176
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,034
If you won't drink,
then I will also...

177
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,167
All right, you won't
drink from tomorrow.

178
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,936
I swear. I won't
even look at liquor.

179
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,535
I won't even sniff it.

180
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,900
Brother.
- Yes.

181
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,400
There are two more beers here.

182
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:57,934
Let's put them in the gutter too.
- Yes.

183
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,533
Catch it, Brother.

184
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,233
Cheers, Jai.

185
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,367
Cheers, Veeru.

186
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,901
Veeru, where did you go?

187
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,033
In the gutter.

188
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,301
What's up, mechanic?

189
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,900
What are you doing here?

190
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:18,967
Strange.

191
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:25,238
Scoundrel... Who took the
beer from my fridge? Tell me.

192
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,569
Tell me honestly.
Peter. Who drank the beer?

193
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,135
Mohan, tell me. Who
drank it? Tell me.

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,201
Jai. Take this.

195
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,900
What is this?

196
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,234
I sold the car that
we stole yesterday.

197
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,534
50 per cent is your cut.

198
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,368
No. I won't take it.
You've earned it.

199
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:49,500
Are you mad?

200
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:50,967
I wouldn't have been able
to steal it without you.

201
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:56,536
I don't want to get into
this mess. I'm just a mechanic.

202
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,900
When did I say you are not?

203
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,567
Take your share and
open your own garage.

204
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,135
Otherwise, all your life
you'll work for others.

205
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,835
Jai. Scoundrel, is
it your dad's garage...

206
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,103
...that you think you
can sit and chat here.

207
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,467
Saw that?

208
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,334
I'm talking to my brother.

209
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,900
He is your brother?

210
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,368
Did your father give
birth to him overnight?

211
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,835
You must have drunk my beer.

212
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,835
Veeru, give me a note.

213
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,569
That's what you get
for abusing my dad.

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,135
And this money is for your beer.

215
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,037
Shall we become partners?
- Let's start by stealing his car.

216
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,568
It's futile. All
of them are useless.

217
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,836
I talk about you day and night.

218
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,137
I talk about you day and night.

219
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,837
I talk about you day and night.

220
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,170
I talk about you day and night.

221
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,003
It makes me crave.
How do I tell you?

222
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,902
Your love is aroused in my heart.

223
00:17:56,966 --> 00:18:00,936
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,503
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

225
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:08,303
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

226
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:12,103
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

227
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,903
I talk about you day and night.

228
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:20,103
I talk about you day and night.

229
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,503
My saga revolves around you.

230
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:35,970
I think only about you.

231
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,570
My saga revolves around you.

232
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,303
I think only about you.

233
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,102
I don't like it without you.

234
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,903
I can't see anything without you.

235
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,503
I become fervent when I see you.

236
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:00,902
My loneliness has been alleviated.

237
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:04,502
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

238
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:08,336
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

239
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,003
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

240
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:16,103
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

241
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,203
I spend my time
reminiscing about you.

242
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:45,936
Your love dwells in my soul.

243
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,270
I spend my time
reminiscing about you.

244
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,003
Your love dwells in my soul.

245
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:00,903
I am alive because of you.

246
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,569
Now my life is just for you.

247
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,369
Whether I'm asleep or awake,
I'm lost in you.

248
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,335
My heart is yours.

249
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,337
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

250
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,003
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

251
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:22,903
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

252
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:26,969
I'm smitten by you.
I'm smitten by you.

253
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:51,367
By the way, do you know, Jai...

254
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:53,167
...I have only one dream.

255
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,300
What is it?

256
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:58,302
I dream of owning a shack on a
beautiful beach like this one.

257
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,903
And all day I sit around
looking at bikini-clad women.

258
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,301
Even I have a
somewhat similar dream.

259
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,833
But I prefer the mountains.

260
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,501
I'd like to own a
cottage in the mountains.

261
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,900
A small family.

262
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,433
That's what I want.

263
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,434
It's a great combination.

264
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,034
My mother was of the same opinion.

265
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,835
She'd say, Veeru,
there's nothing better...

266
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,835
...than a sunrise
among the mountains...

267
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,167
...and a sunset at the seashore.

268
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,367
Mother wanted me to be a pilot.

269
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,100
But mother is no more...

270
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,900
...and I'm not pilot either.

271
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,100
The only thing that's here,
is me and my dream.

272
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,901
Veeru, why don't you get
out of this line of work?

273
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:46,169
Sooner or later,
people like us get caught.

274
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,168
Despite knowing, you...
- I know.

275
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,501
I'm not interested in pursuing
a PhD in this line of work.

276
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:51,967
I don't like it anymore than you do.

277
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,968
But you're aware that
this is where the money is.

278
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,501
And I'm almost there, Jai.

279
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,901
Just a little more risk.

280
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,567
After then, it'll be
me and my beach house.

281
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,968
But for now Peter.
- Yes?

282
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,500
Two more beers.
- Okay.

283
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,434
Looks like you're beach
house is within your grasp.

284
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,834
But it seems like I'll
need another lifetime...

285
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,301
...to build my cottage.

286
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,900
Why?

287
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:15,301
We're equal partners, right?
- Yes.

288
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:18,169
But you always have
more cash than I do.

289
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,967
It's not what you think, Jai.

290
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,033
Cheers, pal.
- Cheers.

291
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,167
Take this.

292
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,101
Hey, Peter.
- Yes?

293
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,569
Try and slip this counterfeit
Rs.500 to someone else not Veeru.

294
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:36,834
What are you saying?
- Come on. Change it.

295
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,967
It's not phoney.

296
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:39,100
Change it otherwise, the bruises
you'll get after we beat you up...

297
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:40,500
...won't be a phoney either.

298
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:41,833
Understood?
- Okay.

299
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:44,500
I love this man.

300
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:45,833
Jai, you know, I have no worries...

301
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,501
...when you're with me.

302
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,367
I feel like I'm
with my elder brother.

303
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,901
I mean, my big brother.

304
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,301
How do you know that note was fake?

305
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:55,834
This one? It was because of the ink.

306
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,967
Ink? What do you mean?

307
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,836
It means, I'll explain the
details to you some other time.

308
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,835
It's one of Veeru's
special talents, my brother.

309
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,834
That's why I always have
more cash than you do.

310
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,967
I don't get it.

311
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:08,900
I'll explain it to you.

312
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,101
Listen, actually, I...

313
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,368
Hi. Hi, Jai.

314
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,900
Excuse me.

315
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:12,103
Hi. My name is nervous and
I'm not always this Veeru.

316
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,233
What?

317
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,369
I mean, my name is Veeru and
I'm not always this nervous.

318
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,834
Hi, I'm Veeru.
- Divya.

319
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,367
Actually, I'm a pilot.

320
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,900
Oh.

321
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:24,567
I'm from Mumbai. Where are you from?

322
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,900
Mumbai.

323
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,367
Oh, so you're from Mumbai as well?
- Yes. - That's great.

324
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,435
I'm here with a friend.

325
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,901
When I saw you
coming out of the water...

326
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:33,367
...I just couldn't stop myself.

327
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:34,834
And I came to you to tell you...

328
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,901
...that that you're very beautiful.

329
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:38,833
Thank you.

330
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,368
That's why I came
here to talk to you.

331
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,369
Oh, so you only talk
to beautiful girls?

332
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,434
What about the ones
who're not beautiful?

333
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,300
No, it's not like that.

334
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,567
I ask those girls...

335
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:52,834
...to tie me a 'Rakhi' (A thread
tied around a brother's wrist).

336
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,369
You see, even they need
someone to protect them, right?

337
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,900
So, you like to fly things?

338
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,834
No, I don't fly anything.

339
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,501
I'm a simple guy.

340
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,301
I thought you said you're a pilot?

341
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,834
You don't fly planes?

342
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,568
Oh, that way? That's funny.

343
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:11,501
Yes, I do fly them.

344
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,902
Along with planes, I fly
away with some girl's hearts.

345
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,233
That's what my friends tell me.

346
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,836
Okay. But I think that
you need some new friends...

347
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,234
...who are honest with you.

348
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:23,901
That's why I want to be your friend.

349
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:25,900
Divya.

350
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,300
Sorry, I got to go.

351
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,967
Divya.

352
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,300
Your phone number?

353
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,235
I think that I need
a new friend too.

356
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,233
Why are you so stressed?

357
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,367
Call her up.

358
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,301
No, Jai. I can't do it.

359
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,900
What if I mess it up?

360
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:11,502
Come on. Relax, buddy.

361
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:12,833
I'm here with you.

362
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,967

363
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:19,567

Remember, you were
coming out of the sea?

372
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,300
You were looking so hot.

373
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,501
Sweet sweet. You were looking sweet.

374
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,900
Divya, you were looking sweet.

375
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,300

00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,233
It's a very nice place.

403
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:50,501
They serve really good coffee.

404
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:51,833
Okay.

405
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:53,500

406
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,834

407
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,233

00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,300
Drinks cancelled.

409
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm having coffee.

410
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,834
But you don't even like coffee?

411
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,370
So what? Toffee will
be there with coffee.

412
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,234
I love coffee.
- Isn't it good?

413
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:19,502
It's amazing, isn't it?
I mean, you love coffee.

414
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,367
I love coffee. Both
of us love coffee.

415
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,103
Don't you think that
we're made for each other?

416
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:27,367
Maybe?

417
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,100
But I think so.

418
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,368
The third wheel is here.

419
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:38,368
What? - Nothing. Look
over there. Over there.

420
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,035
I really like sunset at this place.

421
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,434
At 2 o'clock?
- No, in the evening.

422
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,835
Over there. It's all orange
when the sun is about to set.

423
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,967
It's really a sight worth seeing.

424
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,100
Very funny. It's very...
- Hey, Veeru.

425
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,834
Jai? What're you doing here?

426
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,367
You asked me to come.

427
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,901
What? I did?

428
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:58,033
Why would I ask you to come?

429
00:28:58,099 --> 00:28:59,367
No, I didn't.

430
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,036
Try to remember. Until then,
I'll have some coffee.

431
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,501
I'm Jai. We met in Goa.
- Good. And you...

432
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:09,834
Yes. We met in Goa. He was with me.

433
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,301
He He's like a brother to me.
- I know.

434
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,234
Do you like coffee, too?

435
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:14,900
A lot.

436
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,033
Even Veeru likes it a lot.

437
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:18,902
Really? That's a first.

438
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,833
By the way, do you know, Veeru...

439
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,235
Hey. It's nothing.
He likes coffee a lot.

440
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,035
Just have your coffee. We've
had six cups. It's really good.

441
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,568
Did I say anything, Aniali?

442
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,033
My name's Divya.

443
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,834
Yes. It's Divya. She told you.

444
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,967
Who's Aniali? This is Divya.

445
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,434
I told you that I met
her in Goa. She's Divya.

446
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,968
It's hard to keep track of
all the girls he hits on.

447
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,367
I forget names sometimes.

448
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,901
I'm so sorry.
- What the?

449
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,835
He's just kidding. He has
a weird sense of humour.

450
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,834
Last night when I found you
lying drunk in the sewer...

451
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,301
...you mentioned Aniali.

452
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:51,234
Why would I be lying
drunk in the sewer?

453
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,367
Who's this Aniali?

454
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,902
Aniali Sewer Aniali? Who's Aniali?

455
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,302
Why would I mention Aniali's
name while lying in the sewer?

456
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,968
You know Aniali is
like my little sister.

457
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,502
She's so sweet. - So you were
lying drunk in the sewer, right?

458
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,834
It's an everyday thing No, I...

459
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,101
What What's this, Brother Jai?

460
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,835
Why are you hell-bent to
make my first date the last?

461
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,567
Okay, I'll leave.

462
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,501
Let me know if you remember.
- Thank you.

463
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:19,235
Divya, you're a very
nice girl to like him.

464
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,901
Otherwise, he'd have died
a bachelor's death. - What?

465
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,367
Bye.

466
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,101
Does he always pull your leg?

467
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,367
He? Yes, always.

468
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,901
His been like this since childhood.

469
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,967
I'm younger than him
that's why he does it.

470
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,101
Actually, we're thinking of
starting a business together.

471
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,834
His Oh?

472
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,035
Maybe, that's what he
was here for? I forgot.

473
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,301
Can I talk to him for a couple of
minutes otherwise, he'll feel bad

474
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,301
Just give me two minutes,
okay? I'll be back in a flash.

475
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:45,834
Order another 5 to 6 cups of
coffee. We'll have it together.

476
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,234
Veeru.

477
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,101
Jai. Jai. Wait.

478
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,233
What happened?

479
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,567
Why the hell were you stripping
me bare in front of Divya?

480
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:56,035
Okay, listen. I remember
why I'd called you here.

481
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:59,502
In Goa you asked how I
generate a little extra income.

482
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,235
I work part-time for Tejpal.

483
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,367
Tejpal?
- Yes.

484
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,967
The businessman?
- Yes.

485
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,901
And you're meeting
with him next week.

486
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,901
I heard that he's very dangerous.

487
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,500
Why do we care?

488
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,101
Listen, I do small jobs
and get paid well for them.

489
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,834
Why don't you start. Make some cash.

490
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,968
Once we've made enough, we'll ignore
him. We won't even recognise him.

491
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,967
Okay, fine.

492
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:24,833
Okay.
- Yes.

493
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,101
You should go. Aniali
must be waiting for you.

494
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,233
Yes.

495
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:29,301
Darn it. Who the hell's Aniali?

496
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,100
Okay...

497
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,033
That's right

498
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,033
Pump it up.

499
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,500
You...

500
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,902
...got something.

501
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:58,103
There's something about you, girl.

502
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,968
My heart...

503
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,235
...saw something.

504
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:07,837
Whenever you're around,
my world goes upside down.

505
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:17,109
I'll take you with me.

506
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:26,442
I can't live
without my love this year.

507
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:31,170
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become distant.

508
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:34,903
The heart is
beleaguered with restlessness.

509
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,033
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become distant.

510
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:40,504
The heart is
beleaguered with restlessness.

511
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:46,905
Sleep has become a distant memory.
The heart is beleaguered.

512
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,303
You got something.

513
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,569
Girl my senses...

514
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,504
...have become a bit over-drained.

515
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,435
Your face...

516
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,969
...is buzzing around.

517
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,235
And, girl, when you're around...

518
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,434
...my world's upside down.

519
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:41,842
I'll take you with me.

520
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:51,175
I can't live
without my love this year.

521
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:56,038
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become a distant.

522
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:58,836
The heart is beleaguered
with restlessness.

523
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,835
The heart is beleaguered.

524
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,437
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become a distant.

525
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,835
The heart is beleaguered
with restlessness.

526
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,570
The heart is beleaguered.

527
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:19,437
There's something about you, girl.

528
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,238
There's something about you, girl.

529
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:42,508
Please colour my life
with your presence, my love.

530
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:52,375
Have mercy on me. I'm
in pieces without you.

531
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:59,306
I'll take you with me.

532
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:11,242
I can't live
without my love this year.

533
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,971
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become a distant.

534
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:18,835
The heart is beleaguered
with restlessness.

535
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,835
The heart is beleaguered.

536
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,304
Sleep has become a distant memory.
- Sleep has become a distant.

537
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:27,835
The heart is beleaguered
with restlessness.

538
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,168
The heart is beleaguered.

539
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:36,906
I'll take you with me.

540
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:48,975
I can't live
without my love this year.

541
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,835
I just wanted to make sure...

542
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,901
...you are as agile as you
were before Inspector Jai.

543
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,501
After all, you trained me, sir.

544
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,836
According to the
information I've received...

545
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,236
...you've been having too good
a time for the past few months.

546
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,900
It's apparent as well.

547
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,434
Sir, it's part of my duty.

548
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,835
To steal a vehicle
worth Rs.20 million...

549
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,967
...is not a part of your duty.

550
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:38,435
To steal a car worthy
Rs.20 million is not your duty.

551
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,101
Your duty is to get close to Tejpal.

552
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,367
His businesses.

553
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,837
Money-laundering,
counterfeit money and arms deals.

554
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,968
It's your job to gather
evidence and bring it to me.

555
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,834
No one in the department knows...

556
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,835
...that you're working undercover.

557
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,434
Sir, Veeru will...
- Veeru?

558
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,567
Veeru?

559
00:36:58,099 --> 00:36:59,167
Can you tell me...

560
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,368
...how's Veeru going to get
you in touch with Tejpal?

561
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,567
By stealing cars...

562
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,235
...for someone other than Tejpal?

563
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,101
You've made a big
mistake by opting for Veeru.

564
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,901
He's a small-time thief.

565
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,167
Sir, Veeru will...
- Just shut up.

566
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,833
Shut up. Shut up.

567
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:24,371
Jai, this operation can prove
to be more than I can handle.

568
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:28,036
That's why I'm aborting it.

569
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,967
Sir.

570
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,902
Veeru is introducing me to
Tejpal in the next few days.

571
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,902
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

572
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:45,967
Sir, you were very upset.

573
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:49,502
When and where?

574
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,900
Sir, I don't know that yet.

575
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,835
As soon as you know...

576
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,901
...intimate me.

577
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,033
Okay?
- Yes, sir.

578
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,503
You'll be wearing a microphone.

579
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,434
Sir, what if they search me?

580
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,567
Do you have a better option?

581
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,300
No, sir.

582
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,367
Okay.

583
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,100
Sir.

584
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,233
I have a request.

585
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,033
Tell me.

586
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,835
Irrespective of the
outcome of this case...

587
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,901
...I want to help Veeru.

588
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,967
I'd like him to start afresh.

589
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:27,035
Just don't get confused, Jai.

590
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:32,036
Our priority is getting to Tejpal.

591
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,167
Understand?

592
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,901
We've already lost many able
officers in our attempt to nab him.

593
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,903
And nobody knows it better than you.

594
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:51,967
How did you come here?

595
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,534
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

596
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,367
Don't shake it so hard.

597
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:57,500
It can wake the dead.

598
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,900
Why don't you buy a new watch?

599
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,401
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

600
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,303
Sir, this is my friend Jai. I
told you about him last week.

601
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:14,201
Sir, he didn't let us search him.

602
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:21,035
You didn't let them
search you at the gate.

603
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,500
Sir, I...

604
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,334
You broke my rules.

605
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,134
Rules are meant to be broken.

606
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,836
But no one breaks my rules,
not even me.

607
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,567
Deepu.

608
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,867
Sir, he's like my brother.

609
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,203
Sir, I can even lay down
my life for him. - Really!

610
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:57,335
Can you really lay
down your life for him?

611
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:10,035
I can.
- And you?

612
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:12,569
I can kill anyone for him.

613
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,967
Search him.

614
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,900
Clean.

615
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,468
Veeru.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,068
Next week our shipment
is arriving from Malaysia.

617
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,567
Keep him with you.

618
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,367
Sir.
- Ready.

619
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,835
Yes, sir.
- Listen carefully.

620
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:18,168
We won't find a better
chance to catch them red-handed.

621
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,835
We have lost many officers...

622
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,102
...in our efforts to catch him, so...

623
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,573
Be alert. Jai will signal
us once he meets Tejpal.

624
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,834
There will be no
activity from our side...

625
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,434
...until Jai does not signal us.

626
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,401
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

627
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:43,836
No one shoots at Veeru.
I will arrest him myself.

628
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,267
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

629
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,038
I think, you are getting
too emotional with Veeru...

630
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:56,167
Sir, Veeru is just a boy.

631
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,903
He doesn't even know
the danger he is in.

632
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:05,103
Criminals are never innocent.

633
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,033
Yes, sir.

634
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,102
Team One, in position.
- In position, sir.

635
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,468
Deepu, would you like a chewing gum?

636
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,967
Have groundnuts.

637
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,333
Give him a contract to kill.

638
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,834
That's what he's used to.

639
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,300
Go get some fresh air.

640
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,234
There are big windows here.

641
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,534
Windows on the first floor.

642
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,834
The fifteen men
standing here quietly.

643
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,967
So why are you so restless?
- Get that.

644
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:08,002
Straighten your tie,
and take a stroll.

645
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,902
What's in these drums?
- This? Let me show you.

646
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:22,170
This is Veeru's artistry.
- Mangoes.

647
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:26,236
Mangoes. The real
stuff is under the mangoes.

648
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,133
This is perfect.

649
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:43,236
Kasim, you make very realistic.

650
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:51,035
I praised you for nothing.

651
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,567
Look at this.

652
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,568
The silver thread isn't done right.

653
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,133
This won't do.

654
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,568
This is what you are
going to send Tejpal?

655
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,101
I will change it if the boss asks.

656
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,234
You boss will
definitely ask you to change it.

657
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,836
When will your boss arrive?
- Soon.

658
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,903
Look, this Rs.500 note is not right.

659
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:12,900
What have you brought?

660
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:15,501
My consignment has
always been the best.

661
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,834
You do, but...

662
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:25,434
I will signal you
when Tejpal arrives.

663
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:29,500
What are you saying?

664
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,901
Whom are you talking to?
Whom are you talking to?

665
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:34,034
To a chicken leg.
- Something's wrong.

666
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,901
Something's definitely wrong.
- You are a police official.

667
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,402
You are wired. - I will
break your hands if you touch me.

668
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:41,568
Deepu, have you gone mad.

669
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,434
Did you just watch James Bond?

670
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,302
He's with the police.
- What police?

671
00:44:46,366 --> 00:44:47,834
He's with the police, he's wired...

672
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,434
...and I have brought him here.

673
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,567
Let me see what kind of...

674
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,333
Charge in.

675
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:58,900
Move, move.

676
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:24,433
Veeru.

677
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:30,834
Hold fire! Hold fire!

678
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,967
Stop it.

679
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,868
No one will shoot at Veeru,
and that's an order.

680
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,902
And Jai turned out to
be a police officer.

681
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:23,900
Veeru.

682
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,233
Come out my friend.

683
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,267
It's okay.

684
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,470
Jai. Don't come ahead.

685
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,367
Don't be a fool, Veeru.

686
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,835
This was a plan to catch Tejpal.

687
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,300
I am your friend, Veeru.

688
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,402
Friend! You are a backstabber.

689
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:48,167
Come on, Veeru.

690
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,467
Don't come ahead. Don't come ahead.

691
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,401
You have shattered my faith.

692
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,467
Veeru, you are not in danger.

693
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,901
You were never our target.

694
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,834
You wanted to stab me in the back...

695
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,968
...and get a medal for it.

696
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,001
Today you will die.

697
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:06,967
You will shoot at me.

698
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,901
Veeru, throw down your gun.

699
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:13,368
I promise you won't be harmed.

700
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,967
Trust me please.

701
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,100
Please trust me.

702
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,200
Jai.

703
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:00,233
Jai.

704
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:02,900
Stop you...

705
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,200
Catch him.

706
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:14,433
Stop him.

707
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,100
You brought that
police officer to us.

708
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,368
I can lay down my life for him.

709
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,534
That's what you said, didn't you?

710
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:41,033
Now lay down your life.

711
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:45,333
Not today.

712
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:11,636
Close your eyes. And
go to sleep. I'm here.

713
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:53,436
What are you doing? Calm down.

714
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:55,700
Please calm down.

715
00:50:59,033 --> 00:51:00,801
My hands and legs are not working.

716
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:03,033
What has happened to me?

717
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,036
It's okay. It's just a
temporary condition. You'll be fine.

718
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:12,538
I can't even move my fingers.
I have no control.

719
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:18,702
Tell me the truth.
What has happened to me?

720
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:24,404
I won't lie to you. The
truth is that you are very lucky.

721
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,370
Very few people survive after
hurting their head so severely.

722
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,635
A metal plate has been
inserted in your brain.

723
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,436
Because of which your body and
brain co-ordination is not working.

724
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:40,903
But don't worry. Very soon
you'll learn to walk like a child.

725
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,701
But when?

726
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,834
Well, that depends...

727
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,036
...on your willpower,
your hard work...

728
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:52,468
...and your trust in me.

729
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,035
Come on. Get some rest.

730
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:59,401
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

731
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,733
Boss.

732
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:06,301
Boss, if Veeru handed the
black book to the police...

733
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:08,801
...you could get into trouble.

734
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:16,304
You're a fortune-teller. Use
your skills to find Veeru.

735
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,803
If my enemies got hold of the
black book, then I'll be ruined.

736
00:52:23,866 --> 00:52:24,933
Get me Veeru.

737
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,733
One minute please.

738
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,967
Hello.

739
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:52,533
Hello, Divya.

740
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:53,901
Veeru, where have you disappeared?

741
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:55,634
Where are you?

742
00:52:55,866 --> 00:53:01,571
Divya, actually I'm in
Bangkok for an aviation seminar.

743
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:04,868
I'll try to be back soon.

744
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,000
Are you fine?

745
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,367
Missing you.

746
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,967
I miss you too.

747
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:13,833
I love you, Veeru.

748
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:17,402
Love you too, Divya.
- Bye.

749
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,401
Hello, Divya.
- Yes.

750
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,668
Jai wants to meet you.

751
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:35,868
I will take care of everything.
Don't worry.

752
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:37,633
Jai.

753
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:40,600
What is all this?

754
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,801
How did it happen? Are you okay?

755
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,370
Divya, where is Veeru?
- Veeru?

756
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:53,834
How did all this happen?

757
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,367
Sir.

758
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,302
Veeru works for the
underworld don Tejpal.

759
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:05,936
What!
- And Jai is a police inspector.

760
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,536
When we raided Tejpal's
warehouse to arrest him...

761
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,369
...Veeru shot Jai.

762
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:18,734
He's a convict on the run.

763
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:23,469
The police as well as
Tejpal pose a threat to him.

764
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:32,371
But I can save him, if
you tell me where he is.

765
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:36,503
After all that happened,
you still want to save him?

766
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,900
Yes.

767
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:43,868
Veeru... I don't know where he is.

768
00:54:43,933 --> 00:54:47,970
But if I find out,
I'll keep you informed.

769
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,434
I'm leaving.

770
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,868
This is for you. Take care. Bye.

771
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:56,000
Thank you.
- Bye.

772
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:00,767
Sir.

773
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:06,404
Keep a close eye on her.
She will take you to Veeru.

774
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:25,635
'When you are with me,
I have no worries#

775
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:27,568
'It feels as if my
elder brother is with me#

776
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,667
'Today you'll die#

777
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,301
The scar won't be seen.

778
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,601
You had the same dream?

779
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,035
I don't know what I would
have done without you, Anna.

780
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:16,300
If you weren't here...

781
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:18,935
...I'd probably still
be lying on that bed.

782
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,367
You are fine now.

783
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,368
Nothing will happen
to you. I promise.

784
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,303
So... back to work. How does it feel?

785
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,601
I feel like staying with you.

786
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,371
Is that so? Who will go to work?
- I'll take a holiday.

787
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,701
You've haven't started work yet
and you're already taking a holiday.

788
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,868
Your friends in the
police will arrest me.

789
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,936
If you don't listen to me,
I'll arrest you.

790
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:01,434
Try to touch me.

791
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:14,472
I arrest you under the charge
of targeting a police officer.

792
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,803
What will I have to do to free
myself from these handcuffs, Officer?

793
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:02,371
Your memories torment me.

794
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:04,601
It makes me crave.

795
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:11,671
Darling, it makes my heart beat.

796
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,836
It tempts me.

797
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:24,309
Don't ever belong to anybody else.

798
00:58:24,366 --> 00:58:33,508
Your love has cast
such a spell on me.

799
00:58:33,766 --> 00:58:41,306
I became a Sufi in your love.

800
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:52,909
I became a Sufi in your love.

801
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:24,941
You are my love, my solace,
my passion.
