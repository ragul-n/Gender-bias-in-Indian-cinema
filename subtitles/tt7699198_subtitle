I saved that money to take
my child to hospital.

17
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:12,542
He doesn't care to respond.

18
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:23,128
Why are you hitting me?

19
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:32,957
Dear, you are a fool.

20
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:42,018
You have a long life in front of you.

21
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,814
It will all look like ajoke.

22
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,222
I had to take my child to hospital.

What?

31
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,579
So dumb.

32
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,036
You are the one spreading that news.

33
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,035

Are you in good terms with Ajayan?

39
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,851
He is a nice lovable guy.

40
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:37,679
Even my Uma tricked him a lot.

41
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:48,348
It will take only some care
to bring him back to track.

42
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:34,242
You come with me.

43
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:53,536
Do you have phone?

00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,477
Hello Police station?

45
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,176
Does she live alone here?

46
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:55,881
Her relatives were informed from this,

47
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,118
Brother, do you know if she had
any issues with anyone?

48
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,963
Ajaya, did you see if anyone
came running this way?

49
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:49,549
You also check.

50
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:51,002
Bhas karetta, com e.

51

I am not scared.

53
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:45,503
Nowadays, he goes there to collect those.

54
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:54,638
Usually when 
 go there, the food
vessels will be there outside.

55
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:05,718
Few days before when I went there,

56
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:15,857
I looked inside...

57
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,380
I'm not catering today.

58
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,331
Chembakamma, Anwar brother will
scold me ifl go without food.

59
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:53,280
This is my house.

60
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,259
Next day, I had told that
I couldn't go there to collect food.

61
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,389
No.

62
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,921
Shejust wanted someone to listen to her.

63
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:51,236
Later, she started talking about
childhood stories.

64
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:57,920
That was much tastierthan howl make.

65
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:08,111
She used to feel sad while
talking about her hometown.

66
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,597
They were fighting each other.

67
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:49,536
Finally, she was at peace
once she came here.

68
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:04,549
Everyone...

69
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,373
All the love and care showered on me
was lost due to a small wish.

70
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,339
Awish to live with the person I loved.

71
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,687
Dear, I shall tell you one thing.

72
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,575
You should not leave your love
even ifthe whole world is against you.

73
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:54,021
If you do that, you will have to
bear the pain forthe whole life

74
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:18,862
Get inside man.

75
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:56,499
Atear drop

76
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,589
A laughter

77
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:11,451
Aren't the mind and the sky similar?

78
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:20,490
Atear drop

79
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:29,831
And aslight sob

80
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,409
There's a dew drop.

81
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,400
The summer is scorching

82
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,494
Through changing seasons.

83
00:31:26,862 --> 00:31:29,046
Sir, we are enquiring about it.

84
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:36,224
Huge pressure is there to
hand over the case to Crime branch.

85
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,634
We want justice from Police!

86
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:02,561
Arrest the killers of Chembakammal!

87
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:23,234
So, you have to clear the mess
as early as possible.

88
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:31,646
Nowadays everything is
decided by social media.

89
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,231
Whatever it may be,
we won't leave without meeting Sir.

90
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,633
I got this present from the police men.

91
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,476
You should rememberthat.

92
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:24,109
You may have many relatives in your house.

93
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:32,855
Sister, what is your name?

94
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:40,287
Don't start shouting now itself.

95
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,443
If needed, I am ready to
break this hand also for that.

96
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:18,951
Rajeev!
- Sir!

97
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,648
Rajeev,
- Sir,

98
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,699
because my Dad fell ill,
I was asked to stay at home.

99
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:04,167
But you told everyone
that you got a newjob.

100
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,307
I haven't told anyone like that.

101
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,073
Chembaka sister was worried
about something recently.

102
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,179
The killer can't be caught
even by the police,

103
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:54,844
This incident happened
14 days after she said that.

104
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,310
Sir, it is true that she came to me.

105
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:12,901
I said thatl saw some
bad things on the horoscope.

106
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:17,309
Sir, would he have understood anything
like that from the horoscope?

107
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,344
Sir, it is truethatl had a fight
with her on the street.

108
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,486
She had lent me some money.

109
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:39,486
l have called her in between
to clear the accounts.

110
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:43,046
Else I haven't called ortroubled her.

111
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,705
Sir, that night I didn't even
get out of the restaurant.

112
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,503
That's because I only have that to
wear while cleaning the restaurant.

113
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,885
But he says that he saw you going out
with a knife through the backdoor.

114
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,501
I will believe that he is lying.

115
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:31,694
I didn't do anything, he is lying.

116
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,207
- If you ask like that...
- Then?

117
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,113
Can't you afford her?

118
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,416
Not that.

119
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:18,322
We get only those like dead fish,

120
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,849
If you are not getting that,
does anyone else come there?

121
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:36,939
Whatever you offer, I won't say like that.

122
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:44,042
And we start complaining about that,

123
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,027
People will say that I'm jealous.

124
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:53,872
It's because I sawwith my own eyes.

125
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,360
Who knows when he comes or leaves.

126
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:12,410
Everyone knows what he's doing there.

127
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,538
lfl say about it, people think
it's because ofjealousy.

128
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:03,579
How was she?

129
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:13,259
Sir, he is getting angry
when I told the truth.

130
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:37,731
3 weeks before Chembakammal died,

131
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,260
Where did you take her?

132
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:56,522
She asked me ifl could accompany
her to the temple festival.

133
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:04,310
I went with her after requesting
Ashraf brother to permit me leave.

134
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:13,755
And she wanted to meet him.

135
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,508
You should close it in 15 days.

136
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:45,920
You must corner the most convenient fit
but the catch should be perfect.

137
00:41:58,926 --> 00:41:59,711
No,

138
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:09,572
Don't you know Pavithrettan
who runs the grocery shop?

139
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,804
Don't you have a fearwhen you
stand alone at the tip of hill?

140
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:35,689
Forget about that.

141
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,329
We all are there with you.

142
00:43:37,224 --> 00:43:38,919
Don't you feel brave, nouf?

143
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:16,750
Anurse brought him up.
He was very indecent.

144
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:23,625
Also sometime back,
he had stabbed someone.

145
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,847
No case has been charged yet.

146
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:33,807
He is the guy.

147
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:52,888
Friend of Ajayan.

148
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,795
Come here.

149
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:03,694
He used to come, Sir.

150
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,792
Someone took him to
juvenile home when he left his home.

151
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:30,449
He also deals with drugs.

152
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,996
Do you think that police would believe,

153
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:48,594
you will be answerable when
your friends are involved.

154
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:58,901
You will be co-accused.

155
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:17,297
Tell me.

156
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:53,256
ls Tajuddin here?

157
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,000
No Sir, he will be at home.

158
00:47:01,395 --> 00:47:02,965
Is there any issue?

159
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:18,915
Did they take Samir also?

160
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,182
They asked me the route,
And I told them that.

161
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,036
Then? Is it serious?

162
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:46,300
Who?
- The police men.

163
00:47:55,549 --> 00:48:01,556
Tomorrow morning, go to market
and wait nearfish-seller Kunjikka,

164
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:06,800
Shabeer is there in Rajakkat,
we will take you there safely.

165
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:07,027
She will take care of you.

166
00:49:57,771 --> 00:49:59,727
Hiding? From who?

167
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:01,735
- From the police.
- Police?

168
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:07,863
Didn't you steal money from there?

169
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:16,983
It's not for stealing, for killing.

170
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:24,104
And questioning everyone here?

171
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:32,350
Couldn't you at least considerthat?

172
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:48,390
Don't hold me like this.

173
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:54,931
Ajaya, don't run.

174
00:51:35,335 --> 00:51:36,848
Sir, why are you taking that poor guy?

175
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:36,532
We have proofthat you did that.

176
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,639
Just tell us how it was done.

177
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:36,287
Hey! Stand still!

178
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:20,891
Please let me live working
in that restaurant.

179
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:32,939
Crime branch arrested the accused who
stabbed and killed a lady at Vaikom.

180
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:37,820
Crime branch arrested the accused who
stabbed and killed a lady at Vaikom.

181
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:46,845
Ajmal? Has he got that name too?

182
00:55:53,627 --> 00:55:56,460
Ajayan was working in a hotel where
Chembakkamal was supplying food.

183
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,134
It was 'Ragam', in the
old market, isn't it?

184
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:51,555
Don't the children knowthe reason
oftheirfather's imprisonment?

185
00:56:59,025 --> 00:57:02,210
There was no Kashmir in the map of India
displayed at the hotel.

186
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:09,508
Sir, those are old things.

187
00:57:19,012 --> 00:57:22,231
I won't do anything.
But you should not pave way for it.

188
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:38,701
It won't take much to revive old ghosts.

189
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,779
After that come to the office tomorrow
with your brother and sign an affidavit.

190
00:58:19,673 --> 00:58:23,450
Stay there. Stay there.

191
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:06,631
Sir, it's Manoj.

192
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:25,696
Everyone get out from here.

193
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:01,286
Even though, my mother discarded me,

194
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:08,387
Though you guys beat me this much,

195
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:16,846
He is seeing everything
and looking after me.

196
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,293
(Multiple news channels,
reporting the murder case)

197
01:03:40,293 --> 01:03:58,440
(Multiple news channels,
reporting the murder case)

198
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:09,663
Here is the sweet.

199
01:04:17,564 --> 01:04:19,612
I am not even getting a commission.

200
01:04:28,842 --> 01:04:30,264
What did you tell home?

201
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:40,102
And walking around saying you are a lawyer?

202
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:02,504
Advocate Santhosh Narayan
is the special prosecutor.

203
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:12,800
So many like you are behind him
to become his juniors.

204
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:21,553
I don't want to be a lawyer like that.

205
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:45,234
Chembakkamal Murder case.

206
01:05:57,363 --> 01:05:59,672
Is it Chembakkammal case?
-Yes, your honour.

207
01:06:15,248 --> 01:06:16,442
Don't you knowyour age?

208
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:25,485
Everything will be fine
before 10th ofthis month.

209
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:33,487
Yes, your honour.

210
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:43,279
Those who have done that are still outside.

211
01:06:47,547 --> 01:06:49,822
Com e, com e.

212
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:07,836
When you go to court next time,

213
01:07:24,017 --> 01:07:28,613
Sc case No:41/17, Ajayan alias Ajmal.

214
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:33,820
Where is Marrar?

215
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,101
Yes sir.

216
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,116
Sir, I haven't done anything.

217
01:07:50,676 --> 01:07:51,836
Get that please.

218
01:08:07,727 --> 01:08:08,591
Don't you have an advocate?

219
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,783
This court appoints Advocate Hanna
Elizabeth as Legal Aid Counsel,

220
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:49,414
lam not confident, Sir.

221
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:03,131
It's a notorious murder case, that's why.

222
01:09:06,552 --> 01:09:10,739
In my court, no advocate appears
on time other than you.

223
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:18,909
But, it's him who had killed...

224
01:09:31,944 --> 01:09:36,825
I thought that you could
do thatjob very well.

225
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:39,801
I didn't do any favourfor you.

226
01:09:42,321 --> 01:10:11,317
Yes.

227
01:10:11,317 --> 01:10:15,208
At midnight 12:30 on 2015 June 18th,

228
01:10:15,821 --> 01:10:22,704
the accused Ajayan alias Ajmal climbed
on the tiled roof ofthe house where

229
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:29,463
a lady called Chembakam,
who runs Muruga Catering lived alone,

230
01:11:18,684 --> 01:11:20,663
- Been trying to reach you since
long, Bharatetta! - Forwhat?

231
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,197
Well, why did you call me?

232
01:11:47,713 --> 01:11:49,044
Was it to tell me this you came here?

233
01:12:07,767 --> 01:12:12,978
He is building a foundation for a
wicket taking ball that is yet to come

234
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:18,674
That is, this will be your maiden ball

235
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:27,340
The world will know your
style, vigour and dedication.

236
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:06,011
I've no money to pay your fees

237
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,408
Then wouldn't you have to adhere to the
instructions of the Court?

238
01:13:38,124 --> 01:13:41,309
And that is now my greatest suffering.

239
01:14:17,096 --> 01:14:18,461
That is a hell

240
01:14:26,872 --> 01:14:29,739
Crime branch has a strong case against you

241
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:36,287
l have not committed any crime

242
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:48,071
Even if you deny that,

243
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:58,396
I don't know howthe purse
and shirt came there!

244
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,540
l knewwhere that was lying

245
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:24,361
Remember the spot
where you are throwing!

246
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,031
The way I was being thrashed,

247
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:11,558
Didn't he say that it was the police who had
him throwthe weapon used forthe Crime?

248
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:20,879
Do you know something

249
01:16:35,834 --> 01:16:37,882
Instead, we travel on our created ways

250
01:16:38,237 --> 01:16:41,195
And with ourfindings, we create our story

251
01:16:45,244 --> 01:16:46,814
That must be the ethics of a Lawyer!

252
01:16:53,018 --> 01:16:55,760
In the event of he having
committed the crime,

253
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:04,864
You are creating a story
based on truths you discover

254
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:30,753
Sir, I would like to meet Ajay

255
01:17:38,797 --> 01:17:39,661
What is in this?

256
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:40,877
AShirt and dhothi

257
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:49,954
Come back quickly. Don't put us in trouble

258
01:18:24,143 --> 01:18:25,280
It was not me who did that.

259
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:53,748
When the fingertips kiss

260
01:18:58,744 --> 01:19:01,929
The fluttering of its wings.

261
01:19:10,022 --> 01:19:15,551
Silence crashes as waves.

262
01:19:16,929 --> 01:19:23,277
What sound can break this silence?

263
01:19:39,218 --> 01:19:42,312
But if Police asks whether
he was the one who killed her,

264
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,628
Anyhow ain't I going back to that hell?

265
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,318
then you may not see me later

266
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,868
Any guess who could've done that?

267
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:41,050
Any person inimicaltowards her
met or contacted her...?

268
01:20:55,627 --> 01:20:57,788
She took me as a companion

269
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:04,839
-What happened? What is the issue?
- Hey, nothing.

270
01:21:10,509 --> 01:21:12,318
Would you dial this?

271
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:13,975

 forgot to get my specs

272
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:29,438
The way she was talking,
I sensed there is some problem

273
01:21:35,234 --> 01:21:37,805
But I can give you the number! dialed

274
01:21:45,611 --> 01:21:49,035
But! remember all the
numbers l have dialed,

275
01:21:52,517 --> 01:22:01,630
08122992328

276
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:33,955
Hmm okay

277
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:17,738
Sorry sir, I didn't notice you

278
01:23:25,577 --> 01:23:26,908
Wait.. Wait

279
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,535
Sindri Bank's Criminal Justice Ethics!

280
01:23:42,794 --> 01:23:47,072
Stop..Dear, that Book
costs around Rs. 6000!

281
01:23:51,303 --> 01:23:55,490
But ajunior at my office
showing such a stealing behavior

282
01:24:02,047 --> 01:24:03,776
Wasn't itjust a book stolen?
Doesn't matter

283
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:25,476
After defending, don't end up
living with him!

284
01:24:47,192 --> 01:24:48,932
I will only tell the truth to the court!

285
01:25:13,318 --> 01:25:16,333
Sir, on 12th June 2015

286
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:18,278
12th or 18th?

287
01:25:25,797 --> 01:25:27,936
Must be around 12 -12.30 am

288
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:32,056
No Sir, I don't have a question for him

289
01:26:57,222 --> 01:26:59,326
I will only speak the truth to the court

290
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:08,868
Please tell the honourable
Court what you witnessed!

291
01:27:14,306 --> 01:27:17,400
The day that lady was hacked,
around 12 '0 ' clock midnight,

292
01:27:21,546 --> 01:27:25,698
When I was returning and
had reached Palam shop,

293
01:27:32,824 --> 01:27:34,963
I've been screwed nicely at this midnight!

294
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:44,732
Need to repair some Cable!

295
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,856
See you, bro

296
01:27:53,245 --> 01:27:54,166
Okay Okay

297
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:03,628
That midnight his behavior
did appear a bit strange

298
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:12,265
No, your honour

299
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:21,408
I will only speak the truth to the court

300
01:28:28,313 --> 01:28:30,918
You and accused go to your room to sleep

301
01:28:36,988 --> 01:28:40,378
I closed the Hotel around
3.45 am that day,

302
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:48,458
Butl didn't see him before that

303
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,994
I saw him walking out between 11 - 11.30

304
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:09,675
came to the counter with the news
that she had been hacked

305
01:29:13,858 --> 01:29:16,656
It was he who told me about her murder

306
01:29:32,844 --> 01:29:35,620
That is recorded in your
statement in Police records!

307
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:46,393
Or did the Police frame
it to their imaginations?

308
01:29:54,366 --> 01:29:55,412
Yes, he did

309
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:24,335
must be evaluated as a psychological move.

310
01:30:41,946 --> 01:30:45,336
Stealing was his primary intention!

311
01:30:49,053 --> 01:30:50,532
His foster mom confirms that.

312
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:03,187
And Ashraf, Hotel Owner, testify.

313
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:11,301
l..Yes Your Honour

314
01:31:19,717 --> 01:31:20,729
Look Ashraf,

315
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:44,364
Freshened up, hid the shirt in his room
and appeared before you, isn't it?

316
01:31:55,587 --> 01:31:58,158
Or was he on the same working clothes?

317
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:09,336
Because it was he who served
me black tea that time

318
01:32:35,693 --> 01:32:36,534
Make it quick

319
01:32:54,078 --> 01:32:54,806
Let's stand away

320
01:33:01,953 --> 01:33:04,501
Still...you did it?

321
01:33:30,315 --> 01:33:32,499
Police threatened to book me too.

322
01:33:40,758 --> 01:33:43,818
Not listening to them could have you too..

323
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:50,195
That's enough, man

324
01:34:32,977 --> 01:34:34,899
Give me a call tomorrow afternoon.
I will keep it ready

325
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:04,319
CW 8 Dr. Renuka Subramanyam

326
01:35:10,715 --> 01:35:12,637
Shall speak only the truth

327
01:35:21,693 --> 01:35:25,322
The Face and Skull itself
had 15 deep wounds,

328
01:35:31,169 --> 01:35:32,716
Knife, please

329
01:35:36,808 --> 01:35:45,011
Postmortem report says the skull had cuts
about 8cm deep

330
01:35:50,722 --> 01:35:53,816
lt's maxim um length is 50cms

331
01:36:17,882 --> 01:36:22,296
How can a man cause wounds
larger than the dimensions ofthis Knife?

332
01:36:37,068 --> 01:36:38,808
May kindly be noted, Your Honour

333
01:36:43,341 --> 01:36:47,903
Postmortem report says there were
4 L shaped wounds on Chembakkammal's body

334
01:37:15,139 --> 01:37:16,242
Proceed..Proceed

335
01:37:20,845 --> 01:37:25,498
It's a chemical test to identify
presence of blood on the weapon

336
01:37:31,989 --> 01:37:35,584
lfthis was the knife used
for causing 29 cuts and murder,

337
01:37:43,134 --> 01:37:45,238
That this was not the knife used
forthe Murder, isn't it?

338
01:37:53,077 --> 01:37:54,180
Your Honour!

339
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:04,896
lay for such a long period

340
01:38:11,662 --> 01:38:12,765
Your Honour!

341
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:16,797
Prosecution is challenging
an internationally accepted method

342
01:38:21,372 --> 01:38:23,647
This knife is highly rusted

343
01:38:31,415 --> 01:38:33,371
Sir, please do advise,
my old assistant Hanna

344
01:38:41,559 --> 01:38:43,129
You heard that Hanna!

345
01:39:37,415 --> 01:39:38,074
Yes, what do you need?

346
01:40:08,579 --> 01:40:09,807
Are you that concerned for Ajayan?

347
01:40:17,488 --> 01:40:19,820
I know him ..

SC Case no.41/2017 CW 11 - Cl Praveen Kumar

349
01:40:44,815 --> 01:40:47,704

350
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:55,956
Yes!

351
01:41:00,197 --> 01:41:05,521
This Purse was found from
Ajayan's Almirah by the Crime branch

352
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:14,985
And the Purse which Crime branch
found from Accused's house and presented,

353
01:41:20,384 --> 01:41:23,342
This purse that you recovered
from the deceased's house,

354
01:41:39,437 --> 01:41:45,228
Do you have any idea of what you should do
with the evidence found at the Crime scene?

355
01:41:50,414 --> 01:41:52,871
Sir, when Crime branch took
overthe investigation,

356
01:41:58,522 --> 01:42:03,676
This is the list ofthings Local Police
handed over to Crime branch!

357
01:42:08,466 --> 01:42:10,331
And no where it mentions about this Purse!

358
01:42:43,801 --> 01:42:46,861
Were interrogated by you on the
immediate days of the murder

359
01:43:04,388 --> 01:43:05,343
Do you need anything else?

360
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:55,993
May that fortune be yours! Best wishes!

361
01:45:25,696 --> 01:45:29,700
Has any theft happened in this house
before Ammal's death?

362
01:45:34,705 --> 01:45:38,175
Did she ever share any worries..

363
01:45:43,947 --> 01:45:47,917
Be careful! If you don't listen to us,
you will regret later

364
01:45:54,758 --> 01:45:57,067

'

 killyou..

365
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:04,599
What is the Problem, Ammal?

366
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,901
No idea whether reservation charts
before 2 years can be retrieved?

367
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,460
Details of all the passengers who
boarded that train are in this!

368
01:47:00,924 --> 01:47:03,142
Ramanadan Potty, the in-charge there,

369
01:47:11,935 --> 01:47:12,981
Don't butter me

370
01:47:28,786 --> 01:47:31,710
We can sort out your ego problems later!

371
01:48:04,555 --> 01:48:05,567
Hey Ajayan

372
01:48:12,696 --> 01:48:14,835
How does that bother me?

373
01:48:23,173 --> 01:48:24,401
Got it?

374
01:48:42,559 --> 01:48:44,015
If you get one from me..

375
01:51:06,169 --> 01:51:08,387
Amidst that, Let's not try to worsen it!

376
01:51:13,276 --> 01:51:16,404
This Ajayan is been given a name -Ajmal

377
01:51:24,655 --> 01:51:27,715
is hoisted on my Client
with some other intentions!

378
01:51:30,861 --> 01:51:34,661
Sir, on June 14, 2014

379
01:51:42,406 --> 01:51:44,886
Forjust being Muslims or Dalits,

380
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:54,585
If a Hindu named person is given an
additional Muslim identity,

381
01:52:01,224 --> 01:52:04,614
That thought caused forAjay
to be named Ajmal too

382
01:52:09,132 --> 01:52:13,819
to bring in communalism
and win the case by my once junior,

383
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:25,537
Based on which investigation did you
come to know he has a name Ajmal also?

384
01:52:30,454 --> 01:52:32,934
A Man called Mehruddin All from Hyderabad,

385
01:52:46,536 --> 01:52:52,236
The Ajmal who was staying forthe Period of
April 2000 to August 2004

386
01:53:07,557 --> 01:53:08,717
Yes, Sir

387
01:53:11,128 --> 01:53:16,077
The sandal that was found by the Local Police
belowthe Stairs at the incident spot,

388
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:27,093
and mentioned about the weapon
used for murder thrown into the pond,

389
01:53:34,084 --> 01:53:35,722
After reaching Parakulam Temple,

390
01:53:41,925 --> 01:53:43,995
we sent for someone and recovered the knife

391
01:54:03,313 --> 01:54:04,917
We sent for someone else to dive
and recover the knife

392
01:54:13,056 --> 01:54:15,570
Didn't he say, the accused
didn't know swimming,

393
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:28,480
Mr. Simon, when did you come to knowthat
Ajay couldn't swim?

394
01:54:32,442 --> 01:54:35,047
When did you realize Ajay
didn't know swimming?

395
01:54:42,853 --> 01:54:44,582
No more questions, Your Honour

396
01:54:52,028 --> 01:54:54,167
The Court disperses now

397
01:55:19,656 --> 01:55:22,284
I don't remember anyone
addressing me by that name

398
01:55:30,533 --> 01:55:31,898
Boss over there said,

399
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:40,072
The Man whom I met in the train then,

400
01:55:58,094 --> 01:55:58,549
"Aymmunni"

401
01:56:34,564 --> 01:56:36,020
To the court only the truth shall be said

402
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:43,861
Mr. Manoj, Who had asked you to come to
Parakulam temple pond?

403
01:56:51,381 --> 01:56:52,541
At Cherai Beach

404
01:57:01,191 --> 01:57:03,375
S.
 Sir had called me asking
me to take leave that day

405
01:57:08,098 --> 01:57:11,750
By about 10-10.30 the Crime Branch would
be coming to the Pond with the accused

406
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:21,279
Objection Your Honour

407
01:57:30,053 --> 01:57:31,509
Please don't permit this

408
01:57:48,438 --> 01:57:50,326
On the night before the
knife was recovered!

409
01:57:56,713 --> 01:58:01,491
That the Crime branch had engaged
a trained diver in advance

410
01:58:05,555 --> 01:58:11,733
So the statement given in this court by
Investigating
Officer Simon George is totally contrary to facts,

411
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,252
I had requested permission
for cross examining a Witness!

412
01:58:26,509 --> 01:58:27,373
Objection Your Honour!

413
01:58:34,184 --> 01:58:39,099
Then when my friend, learned counsel
expressed her stupidities in the court

414
01:58:43,393 --> 01:58:46,635
l have a request to not let her repeat
those stupid ities and waste time

415
01:59:04,314 --> 01:59:06,054
Proceed!

416
01:59:40,884 --> 01:59:45,480
Is it impossible to identify the
presence of blood in Precipitin test?

417
01:59:46,589 --> 01:59:47,157
No

418
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:54,594
lf rust is put through Micro analysis Test,
presence of blood could be found

419
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:04,818
Then, wasn't the result that
there was no blood present.

420
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:13,831
You said Micro analysis
test was done on the rust

421
02:00:21,824 --> 02:00:23,598
but Spectroscopy analysis has to be done

422
02:00:40,476 --> 02:00:42,023
What is so specific in this report?

423
02:00:57,493 --> 02:01:02,817
97% ofthe rust formed
is in the reaction with Air

424
02:01:17,547 --> 02:01:20,937
No! Rust forms faster in Water

425
02:01:28,558 --> 02:01:29,456
That is all Your Honour

426
02:01:37,066 --> 02:01:38,954
The Knife presented here by Crime Branch,

427
02:01:56,019 --> 02:01:57,714
Don't believe it

428
02:02:14,604 --> 02:02:16,708
The weapon said to be used for the Murder

429
02:02:17,073 --> 02:02:18,813
was thrown into the Pond by the Accused

430
02:02:25,381 --> 02:02:27,451
My humble submission before
the Honourable Court that,

431
02:02:43,466 --> 02:02:46,208
Sir, please don't bearthis report
with any integrity

432
02:02:52,575 --> 02:02:54,384
my colleague here is
presenting new evidences

433
02:03:02,585 --> 02:03:04,803
How can that be termed as Fabrication...?

434
02:03:11,994 --> 02:03:14,622
The trial of witnesses
in this Case is closed

435
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:23,327
I shall hearyour summary tomorrow morning.

436
02:03:37,086 --> 02:03:40,863
With the awareness that the
boy's life is in your hands!

437
02:04:04,013 --> 02:04:07,847
The numberyou are trying to call
is presently switched off

438
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:42,038
Move away

439
02:06:36,599 --> 02:06:37,202
What?

440
02:06:45,908 --> 02:06:49,617
When Bharathettan takes on something
it will come as a surprise.

441
02:06:54,850 --> 02:06:56,158
On the way, I will tell you
everything in detail

442
02:06:56,586 --> 02:06:57,427
Get ready soon

443
02:07:04,126 --> 02:07:05,548
Your honour

444
02:07:14,236 --> 02:07:16,887
Then to prove that an accused is discovered

445
02:07:21,077 --> 02:07:24,410
Crime Branch set out to
fabricate evidences and witnesses

446
02:07:32,054 --> 02:07:33,658
Was seen by Witness No. 1 Bhaskaran

447
02:07:41,030 --> 02:07:43,715
Later he told this to the
Crime Branch is a mystery.

448
02:07:49,238 --> 02:07:54,426
Kindly permit me to point
an element missed out in the case

449
02:08:03,686 --> 02:08:09,511
It is the facebook account of one of the
witnesses ofthis case, Uma Sundaram

450
02:08:18,034 --> 02:08:19,865
From the date that can be known

451
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:30,005
by the police, is the other one.

452
02:08:36,318 --> 02:08:40,436
Months before the murder, that
ladder had been there

453
02:08:45,294 --> 02:08:48,627
Even that has not been torn or displaced

454
02:08:55,137 --> 02:08:58,413
So the statement that he saw the
accused walking away with the ladder

455
02:09:04,346 --> 02:09:07,975
Why is the easiest way being avoided
by the Crime Branch?

456
02:09:13,055 --> 02:09:14,625
Entry can be without force

457
02:09:21,097 --> 02:09:23,554
Sir, the evidence forthat
theory is along with that..

458
02:09:25,468 --> 02:09:33,261
This is the list of calls that came to
9847413144, Chembakkammal's number

459
02:09:39,782 --> 02:09:42,910
Those three were from her cousin Anandam

460
02:09:47,556 --> 02:09:51,333
08122992328

461
02:10:08,978 --> 02:10:11,082
Who happens to be Chembakkammmal's native.

462
02:10:27,129 --> 02:10:29,017
For his travel from Shertallai to Karwar

463
02:10:35,571 --> 02:10:38,119
Her name is C P Chembakkam

464
02:10:42,545 --> 02:10:48,654
Your Honour, Udayavani paper
Mangalore edition dated 21st June 2015

465
02:10:52,588 --> 02:10:56,922
The news is about the murder of M .Palani
Murugan in Sri Vishwanatha Lodge in Gokarna

466
02:10:58,227 --> 02:11:04,462
As in the case of Chembakkammal, he too had
cuts all over his face, skull and body

467
02:11:09,905 --> 02:11:14,558
The relationship between them was
not only overlooked

468
02:11:32,294 --> 02:11:33,625
And with the intention to
alter the direction of the case,

469
02:11:40,369 --> 02:11:43,588
The theories ofthe prosecution may not be

470
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,771
According to the prosecution the
motive ofthe murderer was burglary

471
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:06,787
However some other reasons for the
murder existed.

472
02:12:09,198 --> 02:12:15,137
Chembakkammal leaving Pandipuram village
in Thirunelveli, 30 years before,

473
02:12:16,038 --> 02:12:18,996
Was the outcome of herfalling in
love outside her caste

474
02:12:26,015 --> 02:12:30,293
The revenge sequences still
continue even afterthree decades

475
02:12:32,087 --> 02:12:36,865
There is a greater possibility ofthis
murder falling into that murder series.

476
02:12:44,733 --> 02:12:48,203
is what! intended
to remind by presenting these evidences.

477
02:12:53,409 --> 02:12:54,740
My old Assistant...

478
02:13:03,018 --> 02:13:04,474
She knows there is no chance

479
02:13:08,724 --> 02:13:14,697
The accused, under lPC
sections 450, 397, 302 and 201

480
02:13:37,586 --> 02:13:41,920
Just to satisfy the ego of
the police orthe politician

481
02:13:58,107 --> 02:14:00,655
An innocent young man was
trapped by the Police

482
02:14:07,483 --> 02:14:08,211
Please..

483
02:14:24,733 --> 02:14:26,951
lfthe accused wishes to
say anything, he may.

484
02:14:33,709 --> 02:14:35,483
I didn't murder Chembakkammal.

485
02:14:53,495 --> 02:14:57,591
This case is posted to 28th
ofthis month for orders

486
02:15:11,547 --> 02:15:15,756
Hanna, I realize that you are good at
creating stories,

487
02:15:17,519 --> 02:15:20,909
But all that will not
work with Judge Jayadevan

488
02:15:28,797 --> 02:15:30,606
Forthat first thing needed is
veneration for teacher

489
02:16:06,235 --> 02:16:08,920
Don't think like that, Ajayan

490
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:18,491
Even ifl lose, at least
someone spoke for me.

491
02:16:51,313 --> 02:16:52,781
Moving to another news

492
02:16:52,781 --> 02:16:56,057
2015 June in Vaikkom, a lady staying
alone was murdered in the night

493
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:04,480
After the failure for over an year of the
local police to arrest the culprit

494
02:17:10,832 --> 02:17:15,212
Crime branch created an elaborate and scientific
investigation in the Chembakkammal case

495
02:17:22,744 --> 02:17:26,896
The arrest of the accused in the
Chembakkammal murder is a win for the people

496
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:34,225
Crime branch took on the case
and arrested the accused.

497
02:19:06,348 --> 02:19:14,494
Under lPC Section 450, 397, 302, 201
the court is convinced that

498
02:19:15,691 --> 02:19:20,435
the accused has not committed any crime

499
02:19:21,330 --> 02:19:27,508
Hence under Cr PC 235 Clause 1
the accused has been acquitted

500
02:19:43,785 --> 02:19:48,199
12th Witness Cl Simon George has
committed serious human rights violation

501
02:19:54,963 --> 02:19:57,238
To find out the actual
killers of Chem bakkammal

502
02:20:02,037 --> 02:20:06,133
And ifthat is not possible, this Court recommends
it may be handed over to any other agency.

503
02:20:18,954 --> 02:20:23,402
The 11th witness Cl Praveen
Kumar's criminal negligence

504
02:20:29,865 --> 02:20:30,854
has been established

505
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:20,115
Because they must be trained to
face the worst situations

506
02:21:22,484 --> 02:21:26,022
Hanna's win is logically my win too

507
02:21:34,996 --> 02:21:38,966
Whenl leftyour office,
I had only one desire

508
02:21:52,113 --> 02:21:53,978
I will be a better human being

509
02:22:14,069 --> 02:22:23,478
2018 OCTOBER

510
02:22:29,918 --> 02:22:31,431
You must forgive me..

511
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:39,811
that l was here at that time

512
02:23:39,187 --> 02:23:46,013
"When fingertips and finger
tips kiss each other"

513
02:23:47,162 --> 02:23:53,897
"The flapping of wings is silent"

514
02:23:55,036 --> 02:24:01,384
"In the stream when a
heart flows into a heart"

515
02:24:09,184 --> 02:24:15,737
"Which sound can win over this silence.."

516
02:24:16,891 --> 02:24:22,215
"The great sound of the sky"
