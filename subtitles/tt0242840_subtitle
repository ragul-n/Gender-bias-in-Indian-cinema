1
02:30:02,144 --> 02:30:07,741
"With great faith and humbleness,
we present "Sampurna Ramayan"... "

2
02:30:07,849 --> 02:30:12,752
"... at your service, but with this
plea, that the greatness of... "

3
02:30:12,854 --> 02:30:17,154
...Lord Rama is impossible
to convey in many movies...

4
02:30:17,259 --> 02:30:19,921
let alone one!

5
02:30:29,104 --> 02:30:32,870
We begin the film with
The marriage of Sita

6
02:30:33,375 --> 02:30:37,106
My dear invited valiant knights...

7
02:30:37,879 --> 02:30:44,114
your fortune and strength
will be tested here today.

8
02:30:45,387 --> 02:30:49,118
I've vowed that whoever
breaks this bow of Shiva here...

9
02:30:50,258 --> 02:30:53,887
...will be wed to my
dear daughter Sita

10
02:30:54,229 --> 02:30:59,132
Anyone amongst you can try
his luck and strength

11
02:31:59,127 --> 02:32:02,722
"Lord of the three worlds,
Lord of the Lords... "

12
02:32:02,898 --> 02:32:04,729
"Most powerful of all,
a devotee of Lord Shiva... "

13
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:06,891
King of Lanka, Ravana. "

14
02:33:10,132 --> 02:33:13,898
- What do you say?
- Even if we all try together...

15
02:33:14,136 --> 02:33:16,127
...this bow will not budge an inch!

16
02:33:17,739 --> 02:33:22,335
I realise my mistake.
I invited cowards instead of heroes

17
02:33:23,345 --> 02:33:27,338
The weak instead of the powerful
and made a fool of myself!

18
02:33:28,350 --> 02:33:32,844
"Let alone breaking it, couldn't
one of you even budge it an inch?"

19
02:33:33,688 --> 02:33:37,852
"Today I've realised, the world
is lacking in valiant heroes"

20
02:33:38,693 --> 02:33:43,187
You may all go home now.
Let Sita remain unmarried

21
02:33:43,698 --> 02:33:48,863
"And from today, don't consider
yourselves to be brave soldiers"

22
02:33:49,104 --> 02:33:52,096
"O' King of Mithila,
take your words back. "

23
02:33:52,374 --> 02:33:54,706
Why?
- You don't know how profound...

24
02:33:54,809 --> 02:33:56,800
...a man Lord Ram is

25
02:33:57,379 --> 02:34:02,214
"With his Guru's blessings, he can
toss the universe like a ball"

26
02:34:02,717 --> 02:34:05,379
Reduce mountains to rubble
with just one blow

27
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:10,384
And this bow... he can snap it
to pieces like a lotus-stalk!

28
02:34:11,126 --> 02:34:13,117
Laxman...

29
02:34:14,129 --> 02:34:17,724
"Ram, King Janak is
very disappointed"

30
02:34:18,733 --> 02:34:25,332
- Break this bow and make him happy.
- As you wish O' Guru. But...

31
02:34:26,074 --> 02:34:28,065
I wasn't invited here

32
02:34:29,678 --> 02:34:34,081
I invite you now Lord Rama.
Try your luck too

33
02:34:59,207 --> 02:35:00,868
Dear Holy Mother...

34
02:35:14,723 --> 02:35:17,715
Long live Lord Rama

35
02:36:07,709 --> 02:36:09,700
Wait!

36
02:36:10,211 --> 02:36:11,701
Parshuram?

37
02:36:16,384 --> 02:36:18,375
"- Greetings, O' great one.
- All that later... "

38
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:22,816
"First tell me, who broke this Bow?
- Your slave, O' Lord"

39
02:36:23,058 --> 02:36:27,654
"He's no slave, but an enemy!
- You're asking for trouble!"

40
02:36:27,896 --> 02:36:32,663
"- Vishwamitra, who's this boy?
- My disciple. "

41
02:36:33,068 --> 02:36:38,665
"Son of King Dasharatha, Laxman.
And this is his elder brother, Rama"

42
02:36:39,074 --> 02:36:44,068
- But I can see no virtues in him.
- How can you?

43
02:36:44,346 --> 02:36:46,837
Man becomes blind when angry.
- Listen boy!

44
02:36:47,182 --> 02:36:52,085
Sorry!
- This boy talks too much!

45
02:36:52,687 --> 02:36:56,851
Sound him about my nature.
- You made it obvious when you entered

46
02:36:57,092 --> 02:36:58,684
You may not know this...

47
02:36:58,793 --> 02:37:02,854
"But with this very axe, I've
destroyed your warrior race 21 times"

48
02:37:03,098 --> 02:37:05,191
Then you couldn't have
encountered Rama and Laxman!

49
02:37:05,367 --> 02:37:09,201
Laxman! Why are you bent
on dying at my hands?

50
02:37:09,704 --> 02:37:13,697
Want to bite more than you can chew?
Do you think we're so cheap?

51
02:37:14,042 --> 02:37:18,376
- I think you're a fool.
- It takes one to recognise another.

52
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:20,711
- Laxman!
- Please...

53
02:37:20,815 --> 02:37:22,646
He doesn't know your wisdom and power

54
02:37:22,817 --> 02:37:26,309
Then explain it to him.
I'm bad tempered and merciless

55
02:37:26,821 --> 02:37:31,315
- No wonder you beheaded your mother!
- And now I'll behead you!

56
02:37:31,659 --> 02:37:37,325
Wait! Behead me instead.
He's innocent. I broke the Bow

57
02:37:38,066 --> 02:37:41,058
"You did, eh?
Then, I'll severe your head"

58
02:37:41,336 --> 02:37:46,069
There cannot be two Ram's on earth.
It'll be either Ram or Parshuram

59
02:38:17,105 --> 02:38:22,042
Why doesn't my axe lift?
Who has snatched all my power?

60
02:38:34,656 --> 02:38:39,150
"Rama, pull the string of this bow,
and remove my doubt"

61
02:38:47,068 --> 02:38:50,333
Enough! My work is done

62
02:38:51,072 --> 02:38:54,667
"O' Rama of Parshuram,
hosanna to you"

63
02:38:55,343 --> 02:38:59,837
"Now I neither want this bow,
nor this axe!"

64
02:39:28,109 --> 02:39:30,100
Your Majesty...

65
02:39:31,112 --> 02:39:37,210
I've some good news for you.
- That's why I'm so smitten with you.

66
02:39:37,719 --> 02:39:41,883
"You'll be happy to hear it.
- Then tell me quickly, O' Queen. "

67
02:39:42,724 --> 02:39:44,885
I've just fixed an auspicious day
with the Royal astrologer

68
02:39:46,127 --> 02:39:48,721
To get the boys married once again?
- No

69
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:52,389
For the accession of our
Rama to the throne!

70
02:39:54,402 --> 02:39:56,393
My dear!

71
02:39:59,741 --> 02:40:02,403
- But...
- No buts and if's.

72
02:40:03,144 --> 02:40:05,135
People want him to be the king

73
02:40:05,413 --> 02:40:09,907
I wish him to be the king too.
You'll have to respect everyone's wish

74
02:40:11,419 --> 02:40:14,149
I'll think about it.
- We don't have the time

75
02:40:14,422 --> 02:40:17,414
Make arrangements for his accession
quickly. The Astrologer said...

76
02:40:17,926 --> 02:40:22,090
...we have fourteen days from today.
The 15th day will make him King

77
02:40:22,363 --> 02:40:25,355
"He'll become the King, not only
of Ayodhya, but the world"

78
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:30,364
This way there was celebration
all over Ayodhya

79
02:40:30,705 --> 02:40:32,866
Today is the 14th day
of the celebrations

80
02:40:46,721 --> 02:40:50,384
"In the presence of King Dasharatha,
the Royal performers... "

81
02:40:50,725 --> 02:40:52,716
...performed the "Story of Madan"

82
02:41:12,914 --> 02:41:15,246
To disturb Lord Shiva from
his deep meditation...

83
02:41:15,850 --> 02:41:18,751
"Kamadev, invoked the
Lord of the Seasons, the spring. "

84
02:41:50,385 --> 02:41:54,219
"Kamadev's wife, Rati, also joined
her husband in the dance"

85
02:44:49,864 --> 02:44:55,200
"When all their efforts failed,
Kamadev shot the cupid arrow... "

86
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:57,861
And Lord Shiva's meditation
was broken!

87
02:45:36,177 --> 02:45:38,168
Shiva's third eye opened

88
02:45:41,082 --> 02:45:44,347
"And in the fire from it,
Kamadev was burnt to ashes"

89
02:45:48,890 --> 02:45:51,188
Poor Rati, fell at Lord Shiva's feet"

90
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:57,854
In the end Shiva calmed down
and blessed Rati

91
02:45:58,366 --> 02:46:03,360
"That she'll get her husband back
as Aniruddha, Krishna's grandson"

92
02:46:23,324 --> 02:46:25,315
Wait!

93
02:46:27,061 --> 02:46:31,657
My darling Queen Sita will
wear this crown? Throw it!

94
02:46:32,066 --> 02:46:34,830
See this one here.
No! That one

95
02:46:35,336 --> 02:46:41,172
Let me see that. No...
There! This is better

96
02:46:41,676 --> 02:46:46,340
"- Your Majesty, they're all nice.
- True. They are all nice"

97
02:46:47,682 --> 02:46:53,848
You wear them all.
- I'll bear all the weight?

98
02:46:54,689 --> 02:46:59,353
"Leave some for him too.
- Ofcourse, I had forgotten"

99
02:46:59,694 --> 02:47:04,358
"Dress up my daughter-in-law,
while I see to my Rama"

100
02:47:22,049 --> 02:47:26,645
"Manthara, one should watch
one's step on such auspicious events"

101
02:47:28,823 --> 02:47:31,155
"She gets night blindness
during the day too, your Majesty"

102
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:38,321
Shut up!

103
02:47:45,172 --> 02:47:47,163
Listen Manthara...
Wait!

104
02:48:01,088 --> 02:48:05,354
What's wrong with you?
Why are you crying? Tell me!

105
02:48:07,695 --> 02:48:12,689
I'm crying over your misfortune.
I'm crying over your son's future

106
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:15,364
What did you say?
- I'm watching since 14 days...

107
02:48:17,872 --> 02:48:21,137
Thought you'd see some sense.
But you didn't

108
02:48:21,642 --> 02:48:24,805
What are you suggesting?
- You've gone blind with joy...

109
02:48:25,813 --> 02:48:28,646
And somebody's paving
your path with embers

110
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:32,816
Who?
- Kaushalya

111
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:35,311
"What nonsense, you talk.
You home-breaker!"

112
02:48:39,326 --> 02:48:44,821
This house will remain as it is.
But you'll have no say in this house

113
02:48:46,067 --> 02:48:49,161
"- Why not? - From tomorrow,
Kaushalya will rule the roost"

114
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:52,161
I'll be very happy.
- Rama will be the King

115
02:48:52,673 --> 02:48:54,664
That'll be fortunate
for everybody

116
02:48:55,342 --> 02:48:58,834
"- But for you, it's unfortunate.
- Manthara!"

117
02:49:00,848 --> 02:49:02,839
Kaikayi...

118
02:49:05,686 --> 02:49:12,182
"The King loves you more than his
other wives, Kaushalya and Sumitra"

119
02:49:14,095 --> 02:49:17,087
That's why Kaushalya
is jealous of you

120
02:49:22,369 --> 02:49:26,863
"When Rama becomes the King,
she'll take her revenge"

121
02:49:28,709 --> 02:49:31,701
And then your smile shall turn
into tears when you...

122
02:49:32,379 --> 02:49:39,376
...and your son Bharat will be
thrown out on the streets!

123
02:49:41,722 --> 02:49:44,714
This is what truth
rewards you with!

124
02:49:44,825 --> 02:49:48,386
"Shut up!
- No, I won't. "

125
02:49:49,130 --> 02:49:51,394
Because I'm loyal to you

126
02:49:52,233 --> 02:49:55,725
O' Queen whether Rama becomes
the King or Bharat becomes the king...

127
02:49:56,137 --> 02:49:58,128
"I'll always be a slave,
won't I?"

128
02:50:02,409 --> 02:50:04,400
But whatever I heard
with my own ears...

129
02:50:06,147 --> 02:50:11,915
...I've to tell you as my duty.
- What did you hear?

130
02:50:13,154 --> 02:50:16,749
As I was passing Kaushalya's
quarters last night...

131
02:50:16,924 --> 02:50:18,915
I heard her grind her teeth
and say...

132
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:20,855
What?

133
02:50:21,095 --> 02:50:25,191
"Let Rama become the King,
I'll then set that Kaikayi straight"

134
02:50:25,699 --> 02:50:27,690
Did you hear this yourself
or from somebody else?

135
02:50:28,702 --> 02:50:30,863
Such things aren't said in the open

136
02:50:31,705 --> 02:50:34,367
Have I ever told you
such things before?

137
02:50:34,875 --> 02:50:37,366
"No
- Then, why would I start now?"

138
02:50:38,112 --> 02:50:42,105
The King and Kaushalya have
planned all this on the sly

139
02:50:42,716 --> 02:50:45,378
They sent your son to your parents
and are crowning Rama as the King

140
02:50:45,886 --> 02:50:49,219
I myself asked the King
to Crown Rama

141
02:50:49,723 --> 02:50:51,884
But I see through it all

142
02:50:53,727 --> 02:50:56,890
Why do you think Kaushalya
loves you as a younger sister?

143
02:50:57,731 --> 02:51:00,222
"Because she knows, your son
will one day become the King"

144
02:51:01,135 --> 02:51:04,901
That's why she taught Rama
to love you more

145
02:51:05,739 --> 02:51:10,733
She's great!
What didn't she try to make...

146
02:51:10,844 --> 02:51:14,746
...her son's life happy?
What games she didn't play?

147
02:51:15,149 --> 02:51:20,143
And there's you! A mother who
spoilt her own son's future

148
02:51:20,754 --> 02:51:23,848
"Who's out to make him
a beggar, like an idiot!"

149
02:51:24,692 --> 02:51:30,187
"You're not Bharat's mother.
You're heartless, sinful, murderess!"

150
02:51:30,364 --> 02:51:33,697
"Stop it, Manthara!
Let it be for now... "

151
02:51:34,702 --> 02:51:37,865
Let it be? How can I?

152
02:51:39,707 --> 02:51:44,701
Bharat has played in my lap

153
02:51:46,714 --> 02:51:51,879
"I've sung lullabies to him.
Caressed him, cajoled him"

154
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:58,886
How can I see him beg
from door to door? I can't!

155
02:52:00,728 --> 02:52:05,893
Before that I'll bang my head
against a wall and kill myself!

156
02:52:06,133 --> 02:52:08,727
Bharat... dear Bharat

157
02:52:19,913 --> 02:52:24,179
I've given birth to Bharat.
But you're his true mother

158
02:52:24,685 --> 02:52:26,676
You're willing to die for him

159
02:52:28,088 --> 02:52:31,683
But I can't do anything now

160
02:52:33,694 --> 02:52:35,685
What can happen now anyway?

161
02:52:36,196 --> 02:52:41,691
"If you wish, anything can happen.
- How?"

162
02:52:57,718 --> 02:53:01,119
"- Manthara...
- Yes, your Majesty?"

163
02:53:02,723 --> 02:53:05,385
- Where's Kaikayi?
- She's angry!

164
02:53:06,393 --> 02:53:11,228
"Angry? Why? What's the matter?
- I don't know, Sire"

165
02:53:37,358 --> 02:53:42,352
My dear Queen...
you and in this mood?

166
02:53:43,864 --> 02:53:47,356
"- Come on, get up now.
- Don't touch me!"

167
02:53:47,701 --> 02:53:54,368
Not touch you? But why?
- You've always cheated me

168
02:53:54,708 --> 02:53:57,108
You've taken advantage of
my naivety

169
02:53:58,112 --> 02:54:01,707
Somebody has been
poisoning your ears!

170
02:54:02,116 --> 02:54:04,107
No, opening them!"

171
02:54:04,718 --> 02:54:07,118
"What are you saying, my love?
- Love?"

172
02:54:08,122 --> 02:54:11,888
"You claim, I'm your favorite
and love somebody else?"

173
02:54:22,336 --> 02:54:24,668
But when have I not
given in to your wishes?

174
02:54:25,172 --> 02:54:28,335
What of those 2 promises you gave?
- When did you ask?

175
02:54:29,676 --> 02:54:32,338
I'll ask now.
- Why just two? Ask for four!

176
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:36,080
What if you back out?
- Kaikayi!

177
02:54:36,683 --> 02:54:39,675
I'm a Raghuvanshi.
- That's what I mean

178
02:54:39,853 --> 02:54:42,845
Think it over again.
- I've thought it over

179
02:54:43,090 --> 02:54:47,686
"If you don't believe it,
I'll swear on my beloved Rama... "

180
02:54:47,795 --> 02:54:49,695
Today I'll give you
whatever you ask for

181
02:54:49,863 --> 02:54:53,094
My first wish is...
I want Bharat to be the King

182
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:58,194
Bharat to be the King?
- Why? Got scared?

183
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:04,708
I had planned to do the same.
But...

184
02:55:04,878 --> 02:55:08,211
...you only forced me to
name Rama as my heir

185
02:55:09,116 --> 02:55:12,711
And now these preparations...
these celebrations...

186
02:55:12,886 --> 02:55:16,219
Let them go on. Call Bharat
and proclaim him the King

187
02:55:16,723 --> 02:55:19,214
Or are you breaking the promise?
- Not at all

188
02:55:20,394 --> 02:55:23,830
Bharat shall be the King.
- And what about my second promise?

189
02:55:25,065 --> 02:55:27,056
I'll fulfill that too

190
02:55:28,669 --> 02:55:32,833
Send Rama in exile for 14 years.

191
02:55:35,843 --> 02:55:37,834
In exile for 14 years?!

192
02:56:11,378 --> 02:56:13,369
Mother!

193
02:56:17,718 --> 02:56:22,052
"Mother, what's all this?
What's wrong with you?"

194
02:56:23,056 --> 02:56:26,321
Have I offended you?
Has anyone insulted you?

195
02:56:26,827 --> 02:56:30,319
"Why this silence, mother?
Tell me. Say something, mother"

196
02:56:30,664 --> 02:56:33,326
Rama...
Rama...

197
02:56:37,337 --> 02:56:39,328
Father!

198
02:56:45,679 --> 02:56:48,170
"What's ailing him, mother?
What's wrong?"

199
02:56:52,352 --> 02:56:56,345
"Tell me, mother. Tell me!
- That's why you're called here"

200
02:57:01,695 --> 02:57:05,859
Then tell me quickly.
- I've taken two promises from him

201
02:57:06,366 --> 02:57:08,857
Promises?
- Yes. My first promise is...

202
02:57:09,703 --> 02:57:11,694
Bharat be crowned as the King.

203
02:57:12,372 --> 02:57:16,103
What can be more wonderful.
By relieving me of this burden...

204
02:57:16,209 --> 02:57:19,110
"... you've done me a
great favour, mother"

205
02:57:19,713 --> 02:57:21,647
He's unhappy with my second promise.
- What's it?

206
02:57:23,317 --> 02:57:26,047
"It's very severe.
- Tell me, mother. "

207
02:57:26,420 --> 02:57:30,049
You're to be exiled for 14 years

208
02:57:30,390 --> 02:57:35,327
Is that all? He's in a shock
over such a small matter?

209
02:57:40,334 --> 02:57:44,828
"Father, 14 years are hardly anything.
- No son, no. "

210
02:57:45,672 --> 02:57:49,665
"I can't live without you
even for a moment, son"

211
02:57:51,678 --> 02:57:55,079
"Don't leave me, my son.
Don't go... please"

212
02:57:57,851 --> 02:58:02,686
"Life is useless without an ideal.
Being your son, if I can't... "

213
02:58:02,789 --> 02:58:06,850
"... keep a promise given by you,
and fulfill mother's wish... "

214
02:58:07,694 --> 02:58:09,685
...then I'm not worthy
to be your son

215
02:58:09,863 --> 02:58:11,854
Rama...

216
02:58:12,699 --> 02:58:16,100
"... the earlier you leave,
the better for him"

217
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:25,801
Don't go, son... "

218
02:58:35,055 --> 02:58:37,148
Rama, you and here?"

219
02:58:38,825 --> 02:58:43,819
Your father must be waiting
for you and Kaikayi must be...

220
02:58:44,665 --> 02:58:47,657
...dying to see the
crown on your head

221
02:58:48,068 --> 02:58:52,664
True. She has crowned me
as the King of the whole world

222
02:58:53,073 --> 02:58:57,840
And why not? She's responsible
for this auspicious moment

223
02:58:58,345 --> 02:59:02,179
Really. Today is certainly
the most auspicious day for me

224
02:59:03,684 --> 02:59:05,675
Bless me, dear mother"

225
02:59:09,356 --> 02:59:13,087
The burden that will be put
on your shoulders today...

226
02:59:14,094 --> 02:59:19,361
May God assist you to bear it.
And may you achieve your world fame

227
02:59:20,701 --> 02:59:22,862
Hey! Forgotten your way
because you're so happy?

228
02:59:26,707 --> 02:59:29,107
"No, mother.
I'm going in the right direction"

229
02:59:30,711 --> 02:59:35,114
"Then, why are you going that way?
- To remove these clothes, ofcourse"

230
02:59:39,386 --> 02:59:42,719
What for?
- To rule this world...

231
02:59:43,123 --> 02:59:45,387
"one doesn't need these clothes,
nor these ornaments"

232
02:59:45,892 --> 02:59:48,122
Neither power nor the army

233
02:59:48,395 --> 02:59:52,729
"Rama, what nonsense is this?
- It's the truth"

234
02:59:52,899 --> 02:59:57,893
I'm going to do penance for 14 years.
- What! Where?

235
02:59:58,405 --> 03:00:01,738
In the forest.
- Forest?

236
03:00:03,410 --> 03:00:06,743
Have you gone mad?
What are you saying?

237
03:00:06,913 --> 03:00:11,145
Where are you going?
- I'm obeying father's orders...

238
03:00:11,251 --> 03:00:13,242
...and going in exile for 14 years

239
03:00:22,863 --> 03:00:29,860
"Rama, why this exile for you
instead of the crown?"

240
03:00:30,704 --> 03:00:34,367
I didn't ask him that.
And why should I?

241
03:00:35,375 --> 03:00:38,105
To obey him is my duty

242
03:00:39,713 --> 03:00:45,208
It's your duty to obey me too.
I order you not to go to the exile

243
03:00:47,387 --> 03:00:51,881
A mother has more right on
her son than the father

244
03:00:52,392 --> 03:00:57,728
Kaikayi is my mother too.
She too wishes the same

245
03:00:58,732 --> 03:01:00,723
That I go in exile
for 14 years!

246
03:01:25,859 --> 03:01:29,852
"- Sita...
- Dear husband, I'll also go with you"

247
03:01:31,097 --> 03:01:33,361
You'll not be able to bear
the hard life in the jungle

248
03:01:33,867 --> 03:01:38,361
"I'll bear it all, but I won't be
able to bear our separation"

249
03:01:40,707 --> 03:01:44,700
You'll learn as time goes by.
- That's what I mean

250
03:01:45,712 --> 03:01:51,207
Your sweet smile will help me
to forget all my hardships

251
03:01:52,385 --> 03:01:56,719
I'll sit at your feet
and find my heaven there

252
03:01:57,123 --> 03:02:00,718
But... Kaikayi will
not accept this

253
03:02:02,729 --> 03:02:07,393
"Suppose she says, your going with me
breaks father's promise to her... "

254
03:02:09,135 --> 03:02:13,902
"Then what do I say to her?
- In that case, you must take me"

255
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:19,407
Else the promise will be broken.
- Really? How?

256
03:02:20,146 --> 03:02:22,341
A wife is a husband's better half

257
03:02:27,854 --> 03:02:32,689
I'm your better-half too.
Will you obey your mother...

258
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:45,364
Rama took Sita with him
to lessen his own sorrows

259
03:02:45,705 --> 03:02:50,108
"If you don't take me along,
the same people will say... "

260
03:02:50,710 --> 03:02:56,376
"Sita stood by him in his good
times, but when he went in exile... "

261
03:02:56,716 --> 03:02:58,877
...she didn't go with him

262
03:02:59,719 --> 03:03:05,715
Will you let me be abused like this?
- Never

263
03:03:07,127 --> 03:03:10,392
- Dear husband...
- Sita...

264
03:03:24,344 --> 03:03:27,677
Hurry and get Rama.
We'll miss the auspicious hour

265
03:03:51,371 --> 03:03:55,705
"Why has the earth
become so hard... "

266
03:03:56,710 --> 03:04:00,703
And the sky so misty

267
03:04:02,716 --> 03:04:07,380
One moment back it was the crown

268
03:04:07,887 --> 03:04:12,119
And the next, the exile"

269
03:04:18,131 --> 03:04:23,068
On one hand it was father's word

270
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:28,334
And a victorious step-mom's trick

271
03:04:29,342 --> 03:04:34,075
And on the other, there was... "

272
03:04:34,681 --> 03:04:38,845
the huge kingdom of Ayodhya

273
03:04:40,353 --> 03:04:45,689
Rama, history will never forget... "

274
03:04:47,093 --> 03:04:52,087
...your eternal sacrifice

275
03:04:53,366 --> 03:04:59,100
You left the edens of palaces

276
03:05:00,106 --> 03:05:04,873
and accepted exile ion a jungle

277
03:05:13,453 --> 03:05:18,891
"Please stop...
My dear Rama"

278
03:05:29,836 --> 03:05:34,830
"My yearning eyes...
call out to you"

279
03:05:43,083 --> 03:05:47,850
Please wait, dear Rama"

280
03:05:49,089 --> 03:05:53,685
Let me see you for a moment

281
03:05:54,360 --> 03:05:58,353
and have an eyeful of you

282
03:05:59,365 --> 03:06:06,362
"So wait...
Wait, dear Rama"

283
03:06:07,707 --> 03:06:12,201
"Wait...
- My dear Rama"

284
03:06:20,820 --> 03:06:25,655
Life was going on happily

285
03:06:26,326 --> 03:06:30,660
We lit lamps in every house

286
03:06:34,167 --> 03:06:37,659
Who struck this fatal blow...

287
03:06:37,770 --> 03:06:44,073
...and shattered our dreams thus?

288
03:06:44,844 --> 03:06:49,679
Our songs of hope...

289
03:06:52,685 --> 03:06:57,349
By walking away like this...

290
03:06:57,690 --> 03:07:02,684
"you've put a full-stop
on our songs of hope"

291
03:07:03,096 --> 03:07:10,195
"Wait...
So wait, dear exiled Rama"

292
03:07:11,104 --> 03:07:15,700
"- Please wait.
- My dear Rama"

293
03:07:24,317 --> 03:07:29,050
"You're taking away the grandeur
of Raghuvansh lineage"

294
03:07:29,656 --> 03:07:34,320
"And also the smile from
everybody's lips here"

295
03:07:37,664 --> 03:07:42,328
You're not just leaving Ayodhya

296
03:07:42,669 --> 03:07:47,333
"you're taking her
very life with you"

297
03:07:48,074 --> 03:07:52,670
Does hope hide disappointment...

298
03:07:53,079 --> 03:07:57,675
Is joy another name for sorrow?

299
03:07:58,184 --> 03:08:05,181
"Wait...
Wait, dear exiled Rama"

300
03:08:06,192 --> 03:08:10,686
"Wait...
- My dear Rama"

301
03:08:41,828 --> 03:08:43,819
Stop the chariot!

302
03:08:57,844 --> 03:08:59,675
You may take the chariot back

303
03:08:59,846 --> 03:09:04,010
How can I leave you like this?
If the people of Ayodhya...

304
03:09:04,117 --> 03:09:07,348
"... and the King ask me,
Where is our Rama?"

305
03:09:07,687 --> 03:09:12,351
What do I tell them?
Lord Rama... Please...

306
03:09:17,697 --> 03:09:20,860
Kevatraj...
- There they go again!

307
03:09:21,100 --> 03:09:24,092
What is it?
- Lord Rama is here

308
03:09:24,704 --> 03:09:28,367
What! My Lord Rama is here?
Rama...

309
03:09:33,112 --> 03:09:35,376
"Did you hear that, my dear?
- Yes, I did"

310
03:09:35,715 --> 03:09:38,878
My Lord Rama is here.
Let's go... come on

311
03:09:45,391 --> 03:09:48,224
Long live Lord Rama

312
03:09:48,895 --> 03:09:50,886
Hosanna to Lord Rama

313
03:10:01,908 --> 03:10:04,900
"My Lord, please come and
stay in my humble home"

314
03:10:05,144 --> 03:10:09,137
No. We cannot reside in any town
or a village for 14 years now

315
03:10:09,415 --> 03:10:14,250
14 years? As you wish.
But have something to eat atleast

316
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:16,752
"Sweet, fresh fruits.
Please come"

317
03:10:17,924 --> 03:10:19,915
Hurry woman!

318
03:10:55,395 --> 03:10:59,388
"Our heart is singing.
We feel really blessed today"

319
03:10:59,732 --> 03:11:04,396
"So why shouldn't we celebrate?
God has come to our humble home"

320
03:11:04,904 --> 03:11:08,135
He has come home...

321
03:11:08,741 --> 03:11:11,904
"God has come to
our humble home"

322
03:11:31,097 --> 03:11:34,362
"Our heart is beating
like a drum"

323
03:11:35,101 --> 03:11:38,696
"And our bodies feel
like dancing"

324
03:11:39,105 --> 03:11:42,871
In gay abandon...

325
03:11:43,376 --> 03:11:46,709
"Today is really
an auspicious moment"

326
03:11:51,384 --> 03:11:55,115
The waters of the river sway...

327
03:11:55,388 --> 03:11:59,222
As do the playful waves

328
03:11:59,725 --> 03:12:03,388
And the boat too

329
03:12:03,896 --> 03:12:11,393
This hour seems so joyous

330
03:12:12,738 --> 03:12:15,901
The earth is welcoming you

331
03:12:20,413 --> 03:12:23,075
"And the heavens are
showering flowers"

332
03:12:23,182 --> 03:12:26,674
To our house...

333
03:12:27,086 --> 03:12:30,351
"God has come to
our humble home"

334
03:12:49,709 --> 03:12:53,201
"We're very humble.
- We know no know-how"

335
03:12:53,713 --> 03:12:59,208
We know no religion.
- Nor how to offer prayers

336
03:13:04,123 --> 03:13:07,889
"Where do we put the flowers,
where to light the lamps"

337
03:13:08,127 --> 03:13:12,120
"Or where to apply
the sandal wood paste"

338
03:13:12,398 --> 03:13:15,731
"We really know
nothing about the rites"

339
03:13:16,402 --> 03:13:19,894
"We're very naive.
- We know no know-how"

340
03:13:20,406 --> 03:13:26,072
"We know no religion.
- Nor how to worship you"

341
03:13:27,079 --> 03:13:30,344
"We just stand before you
with folded hands"

342
03:13:34,687 --> 03:13:37,679
"So please accept us
O' merciful one"

343
03:13:37,857 --> 03:13:44,695
"God has come to our
humble home"

344
03:13:46,432 --> 03:13:49,868
"Our heart is singing.
We really feel blessed today"

345
03:13:50,102 --> 03:13:54,869
"So why not celebrate?
For God has come to our humble home"

346
03:13:55,207 --> 03:14:02,113
"God has really come
to our humble home"

347
03:14:36,182 --> 03:14:44,089
Ram...
You've returned Sumant?

348
03:14:46,859 --> 03:14:51,091
Have the Prince's come?
Where are my children?

349
03:14:52,865 --> 03:14:55,698
They didn't come.
- They didn't come?

350
03:14:56,369 --> 03:15:03,104
They'll not come.
They'll never come

351
03:15:04,710 --> 03:15:06,871
Okay...

352
03:15:11,117 --> 03:15:15,110
I'll go for my son...
I'll get him back

353
03:15:17,390 --> 03:15:19,381
Ram...

354
03:15:33,673 --> 03:15:36,073
Long live Lord Rama
and Laxman

355
03:16:19,719 --> 03:16:22,654
You're crying? Why?
Tell me

356
03:16:23,656 --> 03:16:26,819
Your mother Kaikayi took two
promises from your father

357
03:16:27,159 --> 03:16:32,654
"One, your accession to the throne
and 14 years in exile for Rama"

358
03:16:32,832 --> 03:16:34,823
Exile?
What do you mean?

359
03:16:35,067 --> 03:16:39,663
"And after Rama left, your father,
the King... died!"

360
03:16:39,839 --> 03:16:41,830
What!

361
03:16:46,345 --> 03:16:50,338
O' Father...
Mother! Mother!

362
03:16:55,688 --> 03:16:57,679
What are you so happy about?

363
03:16:59,358 --> 03:17:02,691
That you've become the King now.
- You witch!

364
03:17:05,364 --> 03:17:08,856
Bharat! What's this?
With this poor woman's help...

365
03:17:09,101 --> 03:17:12,366
"... you ended your marital-bliss
and wished me to be the King, right?"

366
03:17:13,706 --> 03:17:17,870
The King died when he was
destined to. Why blame anybody else?

367
03:17:18,377 --> 03:17:23,144
"She's the root of all this evil.
- Kaikayi... save me, please"

368
03:17:23,649 --> 03:17:27,050
Shatrughan! What are you doing?
Let go of her!

369
03:17:27,319 --> 03:17:29,310
Bharat!
Shatrughan!

370
03:17:43,903 --> 03:17:46,667
Save her son.
- Save that evil woman?

371
03:17:46,839 --> 03:17:49,069
On whose advice
you killed my father?

372
03:17:49,675 --> 03:17:50,664
Bharat!

373
03:17:50,843 --> 03:17:54,074
You... you're saying this?
- Today I'm saying it

374
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:59,174
"Tomorrow the world will say it,
future will say it... "

375
03:17:59,351 --> 03:18:02,684
"As per the advice of this witch,
you've killed her husband!"

376
03:18:03,856 --> 03:18:09,852
Killed the peace in our family.
Killed the mirth of this city!

377
03:18:10,095 --> 03:18:14,361
I did it all for your happiness.
- A woman who kills her husband...

378
03:18:14,466 --> 03:18:17,367
"... for the sake of her son,
is no mother. She's a vampire!"

379
03:18:18,103 --> 03:18:23,040
I've always prayed for your welfare
and today you abuse me?

380
03:18:24,310 --> 03:18:29,805
Your actions are abusing you.
Demanding explanation from you

381
03:18:30,649 --> 03:18:33,049
Every mother wants her son
to be crowned a king!

382
03:18:33,319 --> 03:18:38,814
You asked a kingdom for me.
But why send Rama in exile?

383
03:18:39,325 --> 03:18:41,316
So you could rule
without any hindrance

384
03:18:41,660 --> 03:18:44,151
You've made a mess
of my life now

385
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:46,821
You looked at Rama
as a third person

386
03:18:47,066 --> 03:18:49,057
But why did you differentiate
Rama from Bharat?

387
03:18:49,335 --> 03:18:52,327
Why didn't you throttle me at birth?
- Bharat!

388
03:18:52,838 --> 03:18:56,069
"Think calmly, son.
- Don't call me "son"!"

389
03:18:56,675 --> 03:19:00,167
I'm the son of King Dasharatha
who gave his life for his family name

390
03:19:01,080 --> 03:19:04,345
Brother of Rama and Laxman
who obeyed their father's order...

391
03:19:04,450 --> 03:19:06,680
...and accepted exile happily.
- Bharat!

392
03:19:06,852 --> 03:19:09,844
"Brother-in-law of Sita, who gave up
royal comforts to serve her husband"

393
03:19:10,689 --> 03:19:12,850
But...
You mean nothing to me

394
03:19:13,092 --> 03:19:15,185
From today Bharat is dead for you!
- Bharat!

395
03:19:15,694 --> 03:19:17,685
Wait! Listen to me...

396
03:19:25,104 --> 03:19:27,095
Bharat!
My son

397
03:19:31,710 --> 03:19:33,871
Mother!
O' Mother!

398
03:19:36,715 --> 03:19:40,708
Mother!
- Bharat! Dear son...

399
03:19:42,721 --> 03:19:44,712
O' mother!

400
03:19:50,129 --> 03:19:55,726
"You've come, darling boy?
You've brought back life in my eyes. "

401
03:19:56,135 --> 03:20:00,231
"No, no! Because of me
you're living in darkness"

402
03:20:00,739 --> 03:20:02,900
"No, dear boy.
Don't say such things"

403
03:20:03,409 --> 03:20:09,245
Whatever happened was God's will.
- God's will?

404
03:20:09,748 --> 03:20:14,913
But why didn't you stop Rama
from going in exile? Why?

405
03:20:16,155 --> 03:20:20,751
"I did, Bharat. I did!
But I couldn't stop him... "

406
03:20:20,793 --> 03:20:23,853
...from obeying his
father and mother

407
03:20:27,099 --> 03:20:28,691
You're great mother!

408
03:20:28,867 --> 03:20:32,359
It's mothers like you who
give birth to sons like Rama

409
03:20:33,372 --> 03:20:36,205
You didn't stop him from
doing his duty as a son...

410
03:20:36,875 --> 03:20:40,208
...but accepted widowhood and
separation from your son in silence

411
03:20:41,880 --> 03:20:47,216
"Now that you're here Bharat,
I'll not miss Rama too much"

412
03:20:48,721 --> 03:20:53,385
What I'll miss however
is the absence of my husband...

413
03:20:53,726 --> 03:20:56,718
"Father! Because of me,
you lost your life. "

414
03:20:57,129 --> 03:20:59,723
"Because of me, Rama, Laxman
and Sita went in exile"

415
03:21:00,132 --> 03:21:03,124
And here I am still alive
for the royal comforts?

416
03:21:03,402 --> 03:21:06,132
Shame on me!
Shame on my life!

417
03:21:06,472 --> 03:21:11,409
"What are you doing, son?
You are our only support now"

418
03:21:12,411 --> 03:21:16,142
"No! I'm a destitute myself
without my brother, Rama"

419
03:21:16,415 --> 03:21:20,408
"I'm incomplete, incapable.
- Don't say that, son"

420
03:21:20,853 --> 03:21:26,086
"No, mother. I'll go right now
and meet him in the jungle"

421
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:32,353
He's so merciful.
He won't reject my plea

422
03:21:33,699 --> 03:21:36,862
"I'll go and get him, mother.
Just see"

423
03:21:37,102 --> 03:21:39,696
Bharat!

424
03:21:49,114 --> 03:21:52,106
Look! A fruit name after you

425
03:21:54,720 --> 03:21:58,713
"My dear, because of your company,
this jungle is like home to me"

426
03:21:59,124 --> 03:22:03,891
Brother... Brother...

427
03:22:05,731 --> 03:22:08,393
"- Brother...
- What is it, Laxman?"

428
03:22:08,901 --> 03:22:10,732
Bharat is coming to fight
a war with us

429
03:22:10,836 --> 03:22:12,895
A war?
What for?

430
03:22:13,138 --> 03:22:15,732
Greed of throne makes
foes of brothers

431
03:22:16,408 --> 03:22:19,400
"Then for his sake,
I'll stay exiled all my life"

432
03:22:20,412 --> 03:22:22,073
He'll never have to fight.

433
03:22:22,347 --> 03:22:25,839
"Even if we're forced to...
I swear by you, O' brother... "

434
03:22:26,085 --> 03:22:32,081
"... that even if Gods come to their
aid, Bharat and Shatrughan will die!"

435
03:22:32,191 --> 03:22:35,854
"Laxman! At times,
anger leads to regret!"

436
03:22:36,095 --> 03:22:39,189
Lord Rama...

437
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:43,091
Rama...

438
03:22:43,702 --> 03:22:45,693
Bharat!

439
03:22:59,384 --> 03:23:01,716
O' brother...
- Bharat!

440
03:23:07,126 --> 03:23:09,117
Bharat...
- Dear Rama...

441
03:23:17,736 --> 03:23:21,832
"Had I not been born, you wouldn't
be in exile like this. "

442
03:23:22,074 --> 03:23:27,341
It's all God's will.
- But there's a stigma against my name

443
03:23:27,679 --> 03:23:34,175
You're wrong. Your name will
mean love and sacrifice

444
03:23:34,353 --> 03:23:36,344
Dear brother...

445
03:23:44,196 --> 03:23:46,187
O' ocean of mercy

446
03:23:48,700 --> 03:23:54,366
"- Sita! Accept my respects.
- Be happy, Bharat"

447
03:23:55,374 --> 03:23:57,365
Laxman!

448
03:23:58,710 --> 03:24:00,701
Brother Bharat!
- Laxman...

449
03:24:01,713 --> 03:24:06,116
You're very lucky to be in the
shadow of Rama and Sita

450
03:24:06,718 --> 03:24:09,881
"I've spoken very badly about
you in anger, Bharat"

451
03:24:10,122 --> 03:24:11,714
I deserve it

452
03:24:11,890 --> 03:24:16,122
"Don't embarrass me, please.
Punish me severely"

453
03:24:16,395 --> 03:24:23,062
"- I'm a lowly sinner.
- No, no. You're my dear brother"

454
03:24:23,335 --> 03:24:25,326
- O' brother...
- Laxman

455
03:24:35,681 --> 03:24:40,675
Sir! You've come here too?
Who'll advice my father now?

456
03:24:43,689 --> 03:24:46,351
And who'll be his well-wisher
if not you?

457
03:24:46,692 --> 03:24:51,186
The King's not around.
He died Lord Rama

458
03:24:52,097 --> 03:24:54,088
What!

459
03:24:55,701 --> 03:24:57,692
Dear father

460
03:25:00,372 --> 03:25:05,708
"Brother, the city's desolate.
The people are orphaned"

461
03:25:06,378 --> 03:25:09,211
Our mothers are refusing food
because of your absence

462
03:25:10,382 --> 03:25:14,716
The Palace is empty...
There's despair all around

463
03:25:15,387 --> 03:25:19,118
"Only you can save Ayodhya
from ruin. So come, brother"

464
03:25:19,725 --> 03:25:21,659
Come back to Ayodhya.
Please come

465
03:25:22,661 --> 03:25:26,654
"Bharat, before this exile
duty was in my hands"

466
03:25:27,666 --> 03:25:29,657
Now I'm in the hands
of duty

467
03:25:30,669 --> 03:25:33,160
The ideals for which
father laid down his life...

468
03:25:33,672 --> 03:25:39,668
"How can I break them?
Go Bharat, rule Ayodhya"

469
03:25:40,679 --> 03:25:46,845
"No! I'll not go without you.
- Don't be adamant, Bharat"

470
03:25:47,352 --> 03:25:51,846
Let me do my duty and you go
and serve the people of Ayodhya

471
03:25:53,358 --> 03:25:58,853
That's my order.
- Order?

472
03:26:01,099 --> 03:26:06,093
Okay. I accept it.
But without your inspiration...

473
03:26:07,372 --> 03:26:11,103
I won't be able to do anything.
Nothing at all.

474
03:26:11,710 --> 03:26:15,874
"What kind of inspiration?
- In the form of your feet, my Lord"

475
03:26:16,114 --> 03:26:20,813
"From the seat of Ayodhya, your
wooden sandals will inspire me"

476
03:26:21,053 --> 03:26:24,147
- Give these my Lord
- If that's what you want...

477
03:26:25,324 --> 03:26:27,315
...then, take them"

478
03:26:45,344 --> 03:26:52,841
"Raghupati Raghav, O King Rama,
Holy couple, Sita-Rama"

479
03:26:56,088 --> 03:26:58,079
Long live Lord Rama

480
03:28:20,372 --> 03:28:24,638
"It's not every day that
a cuckoo calls in the garden"

481
03:28:29,047 --> 03:28:32,312
One doesn't repeat one's mistake

482
03:28:33,318 --> 03:28:41,054
"Spring too comes once in a while.
Just as a flower blooms but once"

483
03:29:05,684 --> 03:29:09,848
"These unruly tresses...
set aside your veil"

484
03:29:10,088 --> 03:29:14,081
"They kiss the beauty
of your face"

485
03:29:19,097 --> 03:29:27,095
"This sensuous cool breeze...
come closer to me"

486
03:29:27,706 --> 03:29:31,699
"It says, love me.
Don't go away from me"

487
03:29:36,381 --> 03:29:40,215
So come, let's love"

488
03:29:41,119 --> 03:29:45,385
"It's not every day that
a cuckoo sings in the garden"

489
03:30:00,138 --> 03:30:04,234
"My eyes full of mischief,
lined with kohl"

490
03:30:04,743 --> 03:30:08,736
"They flirt with an
ascetic on the sly"

491
03:30:13,151 --> 03:30:19,420
The buds beautify their faces...

492
03:30:19,925 --> 03:30:21,859
and love tinkles the anklets

493
03:30:22,093 --> 03:30:26,086
"My heart dances with joy.
And I lose all my senses"

494
03:30:30,702 --> 03:30:34,695
So come, let's fall in love"

495
03:30:35,874 --> 03:30:39,708
"It's not every day that
a cuckoo calls in the garden"

496
03:30:39,878 --> 03:30:42,711
"One also doesn't repeat
one's mistake"

497
03:30:44,115 --> 03:30:51,214
"Spring too comes once in a while.
Just as a flower blooms, just once"

498
03:30:57,262 --> 03:31:01,130
"It's not every day that
the cuckoo sings in the garden"

499
03:31:06,137 --> 03:31:08,401
"Be frank, Madam.
What do you want?"

500
03:31:09,474 --> 03:31:10,736
You

501
03:31:11,142 --> 03:31:13,406
- I'm married.
- So what?

502
03:31:13,745 --> 03:31:15,736
A man can marry many times

503
03:31:16,314 --> 03:31:19,147
I've vowed to be wedded
to just one woman

504
03:31:25,690 --> 03:31:27,681
Very cruel!

505
03:31:34,199 --> 03:31:36,360
Beautiful!
So very beautiful

506
03:31:43,708 --> 03:31:47,200
Marry me please.
- I'm already married

507
03:31:47,712 --> 03:31:50,704
"If you don't believe me,
ask that lady over there"

508
03:32:05,397 --> 03:32:08,230
I see.
She's in my way

509
03:32:15,740 --> 03:32:21,178
"I'm the sister of the King of Lanka,
Shurpanakha. I'll chew you up!"

510
03:32:37,095 --> 03:32:38,084
Ravana!

511
03:32:38,697 --> 03:32:40,858
How dare they do this!

512
03:32:41,099 --> 03:32:44,364
They not only cut off your nose
but humiliated the whole Lanka

513
03:32:44,703 --> 03:32:47,103
And you're still calm about it?
- Ofcourse not

514
03:32:47,706 --> 03:32:51,699
I'll not rest till I take
revenge on Rama and Laxman

515
03:32:51,876 --> 03:32:54,709
I'll also humiliate Ayodhya
along with those two ascetics!

516
03:32:55,380 --> 03:32:57,371
- I'll tell you how.
- How?

517
03:32:57,716 --> 03:32:59,707
Abduct Sita!

518
03:33:01,119 --> 03:33:05,215
So be it.
I'll make her my queen.

519
03:33:10,395 --> 03:33:12,386
Mareech-Uncle!

520
03:33:16,901 --> 03:33:21,167
Lankesh! Why are you here?
- I want your help

521
03:33:21,673 --> 03:33:22,662
Anytime.

522
03:33:23,074 --> 03:33:25,065
You'll have to become
a golden deer for that

523
03:33:25,677 --> 03:33:30,341
I intend to abduct Sita.
- I can't help you in this vile act

524
03:33:30,782 --> 03:33:34,684
"Then, I'll kill you!
- Instead of dying at your hands... "

525
03:33:35,186 --> 03:33:37,848
...better I die at Lord Rama's!
I'll get salvation then!

526
03:33:38,089 --> 03:33:40,683
Go! Obey my command.
Hurry...

527
03:33:42,694 --> 03:33:47,358
Sita... you look so beautiful
in these ornaments

528
03:33:48,700 --> 03:33:52,864
Holy Mother Anusaya's gift has
brought a glow to your beauty

529
03:33:53,705 --> 03:33:57,698
"Today, along with your beauty
their fate has come to light too!"

530
03:33:58,109 --> 03:34:02,876
You're not really praising these
ornaments. You're praising me

531
03:34:04,382 --> 03:34:08,716
"Well, you are the sweetness
of my life, Sita"

532
03:34:10,121 --> 03:34:13,113
And what is the name of
the bitterness in your life?

533
03:34:14,392 --> 03:34:17,725
Separation from Sita.
Even if it is for a moment

534
03:34:29,073 --> 03:34:31,337
Look! A golden deer

535
03:34:34,179 --> 03:34:37,842
"Surprising! Never read about it,
nor heard about it"

536
03:34:38,683 --> 03:34:42,676
So see it with your eyes.
How beautiful it is!

537
03:34:45,089 --> 03:34:48,081
There are many things that
look beautiful from afar

538
03:34:48,693 --> 03:34:52,857
"Bring me his skin, my Lord.
I'll stitch a blouse from it"

539
03:34:53,364 --> 03:34:57,095
It's a sin to destroy somebody
else's beauty to enhance one's own

540
03:34:58,102 --> 03:35:03,096
It's not a sin to enhance beauty.
- But it can invite trouble

541
03:35:04,375 --> 03:35:06,707
So! You won't fulfill
my wish then!

542
03:35:10,715 --> 03:35:12,706
Ofcourse, I will!"

543
03:35:16,387 --> 03:35:19,879
"- Laxman!
- Yes, brother?"

544
03:35:20,124 --> 03:35:24,652
"Protect Sita.
And till I return, don't leave the hut"

545
03:35:24,829 --> 03:35:26,820
As you wish

546
03:36:01,366 --> 03:36:03,357
Sita!

547
03:36:08,873 --> 03:36:10,864
Laxman!

548
03:36:17,115 --> 03:36:21,814
- Mareech!
- My Lord!

549
03:36:23,388 --> 03:36:27,825
"Laxman, my husband is calling
out to you for help... "

550
03:36:28,059 --> 03:36:33,326
...and you're still here?
Go and see what trouble he is in.

551
03:36:33,831 --> 03:36:38,666
"He, whose very name obliterates
calamities, how can he be in trouble?"

552
03:36:38,836 --> 03:36:43,830
If the time is bad anything
can happen. Go and help him

553
03:36:44,075 --> 03:36:47,841
He ordered me...
- Don't make excuses.

554
03:36:47,946 --> 03:36:52,076
Forget your duty.
- But it's my duty to protect you

555
03:36:53,084 --> 03:36:56,850
Behind this excuse there lies
an evil selfish motive

556
03:36:57,021 --> 03:36:59,353
Oh no!

557
03:37:00,091 --> 03:37:04,687
"Without Rama, Sita cannot
walk on this earth, Laxman"

558
03:37:04,862 --> 03:37:09,094
"Before that happens,
Laxman's body will become lifeless"

559
03:37:09,367 --> 03:37:13,360
"If you look upon me as
a mother, then obey me!"

560
03:37:14,105 --> 03:37:17,700
"If that's your command,
then I'll go"

561
03:37:32,323 --> 03:37:35,156
You'll remain safe behind
this line drawn by me

562
03:38:11,362 --> 03:38:14,092
Alms to the poor

563
03:38:17,101 --> 03:38:19,092
Alms to the poor

564
03:38:28,046 --> 03:38:31,038
"My respects, O' wise one.
- Bless you"

565
03:38:39,657 --> 03:38:41,648
I won't accept alms from a
person in bindings.

566
03:38:44,195 --> 03:38:48,655
"And I can't cross the line.
- Then, I'll go away hungry"

567
03:38:48,833 --> 03:38:53,065
Wait! Nobody goes hungry
from Lord Rama's door

568
03:38:58,242 --> 03:39:01,075
- Who are you?
- You will soon find out!

569
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:06,673
"- Laxman, you left Sita alone?
- You only called out to me"

570
03:39:06,784 --> 03:39:09,344
That wasn't my voice!
There's something fishy in this

571
03:39:09,687 --> 03:39:11,177
Let's go.
- Yes.

572
03:39:11,689 --> 03:39:13,680
Sita

573
03:39:24,368 --> 03:39:28,862
"Janaki isn't here, Laxman
- Brother, I have my doubts"

574
03:39:30,708 --> 03:39:32,699
Look at this

575
03:39:35,713 --> 03:39:39,376
- Sita...
- Mother...

576
03:39:41,119 --> 03:39:43,110
Sita...

577
03:39:43,721 --> 03:39:48,715
Sita...

578
03:39:52,730 --> 03:39:59,727
"Sita, because they can't see you
two eyes are so very void today"

579
03:40:00,404 --> 03:40:03,896
"Sita...
My dear Sita... "

580
03:40:07,145 --> 03:40:11,138
"O' water, O' dry lands...
O' directions... "

581
03:40:13,417 --> 03:40:17,410
"O' woods and groves...
O' trees and creepers... "

582
03:40:19,757 --> 03:40:23,853
"Tell me the whereabouts
of my love... "

583
03:40:25,863 --> 03:40:30,357
"Show me where my beloved
is hiding"

584
03:40:32,703 --> 03:40:40,109
"How these moments have passed
without breath in life"

585
03:40:46,384 --> 03:40:50,218
"The exiled Ram
is heartbroken"

586
03:40:50,388 --> 03:40:54,119
"His voice is heavy
with infinite sorrow"

587
03:40:55,893 --> 03:41:03,732
"While Ravana takes Sita
to Lanka by air... "

588
03:41:06,137 --> 03:41:13,908
"When she got a chance,
Sita jumped off the plane"

589
03:41:14,245 --> 03:41:17,908
Sita jumped off the plane

590
03:41:18,416 --> 03:41:22,352
"Jatayu, a vulture
took her on his wings"

591
03:41:28,693 --> 03:41:32,185
And landed that very moment

592
03:41:33,097 --> 03:41:38,694
"Jatayu, the devotee of Lord Rama
fought with all his might with Ravana"

593
03:41:40,104 --> 03:41:44,871
"But Ravana cut Jatayu's
wings with his sword"

594
03:41:46,110 --> 03:41:50,206
"While Jatayu lay wounded
on the ground... "

595
03:41:50,715 --> 03:41:53,878
"Ravana carried off Sita
once again"

596
03:41:54,719 --> 03:41:58,712
"Just then Lord Rama comes
to Jatayu... "

597
03:41:58,823 --> 03:42:01,724
"... who was calling out
to him in his mind"

598
03:42:01,892 --> 03:42:07,387
"O' Lord Rama, said Jatayu.
A terrible thing has happened"

599
03:42:21,679 --> 03:42:26,173
"Then Rama and Laxman, both
set out to look for Sita"

600
03:42:26,684 --> 03:42:31,849
"But from behind,
a demon creeps up to them"

601
03:42:32,089 --> 03:42:37,686
"And hurls Laxman
up in the air"

602
03:42:38,095 --> 03:42:44,091
"Seeing this, Lord Rama
kills the demon"

603
03:42:46,704 --> 03:42:52,370
"Laxman goes into orbit
in the blue sky... "

604
03:42:53,110 --> 03:42:59,106
"But Ram-devotee Hanuman
comes and saves him"

605
03:43:09,126 --> 03:43:15,122
"Hanuman was an eternal
devotee of Lord Rama"

606
03:43:15,733 --> 03:43:21,330
He approaches Rama
to quench his life long thirst

607
03:43:22,340 --> 03:43:30,076
"O' Rama...
Lord Rama"

608
03:43:32,083 --> 03:43:35,075
"Taking Rama and Laxman
on his shoulders... "

609
03:43:35,186 --> 03:43:37,677
Hanuman lands on a mountain

610
03:43:38,356 --> 03:43:43,851
"He introduces them to Sugriv
who was fed up with Vali"

611
03:43:48,265 --> 03:43:54,101
"Because of Hanuman,
Sugriv gained"

612
03:44:00,711 --> 03:44:03,874
"When the trees were felled
with one single arrow... "

613
03:44:03,981 --> 03:44:09,715
...Vali was killed

614
03:44:10,121 --> 03:44:12,715
Long live Lord Rama

615
03:44:13,724 --> 03:44:19,128
"They all thought and realised
the greatness of Lord Rama"

616
03:44:19,730 --> 03:44:25,327
"Hanuman then asked Rama
to give him a personal token"

617
03:44:26,070 --> 03:44:31,838
"Rama gave him his ring
and bid them goodbye"

618
03:44:47,858 --> 03:44:54,354
The whole world is sleeping
peacefully and you're still awake?

619
03:44:56,100 --> 03:45:01,868
How can these eyes give in to sleep
when they're dying to see Rama?

620
03:45:02,873 --> 03:45:08,709
"Sleep...
Even I can't sleep, Janaki"

621
03:45:09,713 --> 03:45:13,376
"A sinner like you,
can never sleep peacefully"

622
03:45:13,818 --> 03:45:16,719
"I'm not a sinner.
I'm your ardent lover, Sita"

623
03:45:17,121 --> 03:45:19,112
I can give you
every comfort available

624
03:45:20,391 --> 03:45:22,655
The happiness I got
at the feet of Lord Rama...

625
03:45:24,662 --> 03:45:27,825
"... can't be compared
to any other joy, anywhere"

626
03:45:28,065 --> 03:45:30,329
Sita!
Ram is in exile!

627
03:45:31,335 --> 03:45:34,327
- He's still my heartbeat.
- I'm the conqueror of the 3 worlds

628
03:45:35,072 --> 03:45:40,669
That's why you abducted me
I suppose. You rascal! A sinner...

629
03:45:41,178 --> 03:45:45,842
"Sita! You won't give in, eh?
Then, I'll force myself on you!"

630
03:45:46,083 --> 03:45:48,074
Ravana! Ravana!

631
03:45:51,188 --> 03:45:53,679
Forgotten my curse? Remember...

632
03:46:12,710 --> 03:46:15,702
"If you don't change your mind,
I'll have my own way!"

633
03:46:37,067 --> 03:46:41,163
But...
... how did this ring get here?

634
03:46:44,675 --> 03:46:46,666
"- Can it be that he...
- Don't worry, mother. "

635
03:46:53,083 --> 03:46:56,075
"- Who are you?
- Lord Rama's messenger, Hanuman"

636
03:46:57,087 --> 03:47:01,854
Lord Rama's messenger?
A monkey?

637
03:47:02,693 --> 03:47:05,355
This ring is it's proof

638
03:47:12,369 --> 03:47:14,360
Dear husband...

639
03:47:18,108 --> 03:47:20,099
"My husband...
He's well, isn't he?"

640
03:47:20,811 --> 03:47:22,039
Yes, M'lady"

641
03:47:22,146 --> 03:47:24,808
- And dear Laxman?
- He too

642
03:47:25,649 --> 03:47:32,316
"Does my husband ever think
about me, Hanuman?"

643
03:47:32,823 --> 03:47:37,055
"M'Lady, if you're missing
him so very much... "

644
03:47:37,661 --> 03:47:41,825
he's missing you
many times more!

645
03:47:42,066 --> 03:47:43,055
Dear Lord...

646
03:47:43,334 --> 03:47:46,326
"Take courage, M'Lady.
When I go back to him... "

647
03:47:46,670 --> 03:47:50,834
...Lord Rama's Army of Apes
will attack this Lanka

648
03:47:51,675 --> 03:47:53,666
In that army...

649
03:47:56,680 --> 03:47:59,843
...are all the monkeys like you?
- Yes M'Lady

650
03:48:01,085 --> 03:48:05,681
- Then I've no hopes of freedom.
- Do you have a doubt?

651
03:48:06,357 --> 03:48:12,091
"Hanuman, Ravana's army
has great warriors. "

652
03:48:12,696 --> 03:48:15,358
So has M'Lord's

653
03:48:15,699 --> 03:48:18,862
"If you don't believe me,
see this"

654
03:48:20,371 --> 03:48:22,305
Praise to Lord Rama

655
03:48:30,047 --> 03:48:36,043
"M'Lady, now are you satisfied?
Saw Lord Rama's glory?"

656
03:48:36,654 --> 03:48:38,645
Bless you, Hanuman"

657
03:48:54,838 --> 03:48:56,829
Hanuman?

658
03:49:04,081 --> 03:49:08,347
"M'Lady, seeing all those luscious
fruits on those trees there... "

659
03:49:08,852 --> 03:49:14,188
...my mouth is watering.
May I eat some with your permission?

660
03:49:16,694 --> 03:49:18,685
Long live Lord Rama!

661
03:49:56,734 --> 03:49:58,895
- Where's that destructive monkey?
- Meghnad...

662
03:49:59,737 --> 03:50:02,399
Why do you want to
play with your life?

663
03:50:02,740 --> 03:50:04,731
It's not a joke to catch me!

664
03:50:06,744 --> 03:50:09,406
"Let's see how you escape
my "Brahma's noose"!"

665
03:50:10,914 --> 03:50:12,905
Indeed!

666
03:50:38,041 --> 03:50:40,032
Catch him!

667
03:50:49,720 --> 03:50:55,124
"Father, he's the same monkey,
who has destroyed Ashoka forest"

668
03:50:55,726 --> 03:50:58,889
Hey you! Where have you come from?
Who are you?

669
03:51:01,732 --> 03:51:05,395
"- Meghnad, can't he see properly?
- Shut up!"

670
03:51:06,136 --> 03:51:09,401
I want to know your name
- I'm a messenger of Lord Rama

671
03:51:11,141 --> 03:51:16,135
What! Really?
- My name's Hanuman

672
03:51:16,747 --> 03:51:20,843
And both you and your son
have witnessed my deeds

673
03:51:21,084 --> 03:51:23,678
"Hey you, monkey!
Don't chatter so!"

674
03:51:23,854 --> 03:51:25,845
Remember, you're our captive"

675
03:51:26,857 --> 03:51:28,848
Your captive?

676
03:51:29,693 --> 03:51:32,685
I got myself tied like this
out of respect for Lord Brahma

677
03:51:33,197 --> 03:51:35,188
Else, see this"

678
03:51:39,703 --> 03:51:41,694
Hosanna to Lord Rama

679
03:51:44,875 --> 03:51:50,108
"- Saw Lord Rama's glory?
- Yes, I did. "

680
03:51:50,714 --> 03:51:53,376
But your father's turning a blind
eye to it even after seeing it

681
03:51:53,884 --> 03:51:56,114
Because it's the beginning
of his end

682
03:51:59,122 --> 03:52:03,889
I made a mistake in asking
my son to bring you alive!

683
03:52:04,394 --> 03:52:06,885
It's one of many
you've committed Ravana

684
03:52:07,397 --> 03:52:12,733
You listened to your sister
and locked horns with Lord Rama

685
03:52:12,903 --> 03:52:14,894
This is your first folly

686
03:52:15,239 --> 03:52:19,733
You then abducted M'Lady Sita.
This is your second mistake

687
03:52:20,143 --> 03:52:25,843
"And by not offering a seat to a
guest like me, is your third folly!"

688
03:52:26,083 --> 03:52:30,179
A seat is offered to an equal.
Not a lowly monkey like you!

689
03:52:31,855 --> 03:52:36,189
"That's your fourth mistake!
By nature, I'm used to a lofty perch"

690
03:52:36,360 --> 03:52:40,854
Because I'm a monkey.
You didn't offer me a seat

691
03:52:41,098 --> 03:52:44,363
Never mind.
I'll make a seat for myself!

692
03:52:45,102 --> 03:52:47,093
Long live Lord Rama...

693
03:53:28,345 --> 03:53:33,339
Now listen to me carefully.
Better mend your ways soon

694
03:53:33,850 --> 03:53:37,183
Else you'll regret it.
- I don't need advice from you

695
03:53:38,689 --> 03:53:42,682
"Today I've come to know,
you're a scholar only in name"

696
03:53:42,859 --> 03:53:46,090
But actually you're an egoist
and a stupid fool!

697
03:53:46,196 --> 03:53:49,859
"- Mind your tongue, you monkey.
- And you mind your senses"

698
03:53:50,701 --> 03:53:56,367
Take M'Lady to Lord Rama.
He's very merciful

699
03:53:56,873 --> 03:54:00,365
- He'll forgive you at once!
- I should seek mercy?

700
03:54:00,711 --> 03:54:03,202
That too from Rama?
The winner of the three worlds...

701
03:54:03,313 --> 03:54:06,214
A ten headed being...
I should bow to an exiled one?!

702
03:54:06,717 --> 03:54:11,381
"The whole world bows to him.
And you call him an "exiled one"?"

703
03:54:12,122 --> 03:54:16,889
"Hear me loud and clear, Ravana.
Mend your way when there's still time"

704
03:54:17,394 --> 03:54:20,386
"Else, you'll die at the hands
of those very exiled one's!"

705
03:54:20,731 --> 03:54:23,063
And this island of gold
will turn into rubble!

706
03:54:23,333 --> 03:54:25,324
My son! Severe his head!

707
03:54:30,073 --> 03:54:32,064
Wait!
- Vibhishan!

708
03:54:33,844 --> 03:54:38,338
"What are you doing, brother?
By killing a messenger... "

709
03:54:39,082 --> 03:54:42,848
"... you want to defame yourself?
- He's right, father"

710
03:54:43,687 --> 03:54:45,348
But I still want to punish him!

711
03:54:45,689 --> 03:54:51,855
Monkeys are very proud of their
tails. Let's set it on fire!

712
03:54:52,696 --> 03:54:54,687
Then set it on fire!

713
03:56:41,071 --> 03:56:45,064
M'Lady! Ravan's Lanka
is being ruined. See that

714
03:56:51,081 --> 03:56:54,346
"- Did you set Lanka on fire?
- Physically, Yes I did"

715
03:56:54,684 --> 03:56:58,347
"- But it was My Lord's doing.
- Bless you, O' brave one"

716
03:56:59,356 --> 03:57:03,349
"Seeing your devotion to my Lord,
I'll give you a blessing"

717
03:57:04,694 --> 03:57:08,858
From today whoever applies
the vermilion and prays to you...

718
03:57:10,100 --> 03:57:12,694
...shall have his wishes fulfilled

719
03:57:13,370 --> 03:57:16,862
- Do me one favour M'Lady.
- Are you hungry again?

720
03:57:16,973 --> 03:57:22,309
No M'Lady. I want some proof
that I've really met you

721
03:57:29,653 --> 03:57:36,058
Take this hair-pin and tell
My Lord to liberate me soon

722
03:57:40,830 --> 03:57:43,060
M'Lady has given this, My Lord"

723
03:58:00,850 --> 03:58:02,841
My dear...

724
03:58:10,694 --> 03:58:17,862
"Hanuman, how does she stay there?
What does she do?"

725
03:58:18,168 --> 03:58:23,629
She just thinks of you. But...
- But what?

726
03:58:24,040 --> 03:58:30,036
I'm scared that she may lose
her patience and kill herself!

727
03:58:30,814 --> 03:58:33,806
"If that happens then without Sita,
Rama can't survive either"

728
03:58:34,050 --> 03:58:38,146
Then hurry and end her turmoil.
- It will end

729
03:58:38,655 --> 03:58:42,147
"- Who says so, you idiot?
- Lord Rama's valour"

730
03:58:43,326 --> 03:58:45,317
"Don't think him an
ordinary mortal, brother"

731
03:58:46,329 --> 03:58:48,320
For your own good and
that of Lanka...

732
03:58:49,065 --> 03:58:52,831
"... better you take Sita back
to Lord Rama, and seek his mercy"

733
03:58:53,670 --> 03:58:57,663
"I beg you, dear brother.
Ask Lord Rama's forgiveness"

734
03:58:57,841 --> 03:59:02,175
You cur! You eat at my door
and sing praise of my enemy?

735
03:59:02,345 --> 03:59:04,336
Get lost from here!

736
03:59:09,085 --> 03:59:12,851
"When ruin is on cards,
sense deserts you"

737
03:59:13,423 --> 03:59:20,352
True. We'll win no doubt.
But how do we cross the ocean?

738
03:59:21,097 --> 03:59:26,364
We have talented youngsters here.
They just need an order from you...

739
03:59:26,703 --> 03:59:30,696
...to build a bridge
- Wait!

740
03:59:34,110 --> 03:59:38,376
- Vibhishan? You and here?
- I've come to serve Lord Rama

741
03:59:39,115 --> 03:59:41,106
Then come and meet him

742
03:59:43,720 --> 03:59:46,382
"My Lord, this is Vibhishan.
Your ardent devotee"

743
03:59:47,724 --> 03:59:49,715
Welcome Lankesh, King of Lanka"

744
03:59:54,731 --> 03:59:56,892
- Be victorious.
- My Lord...

745
04:00:17,938 --> 04:00:20,202
Long live Lord Rama!

746
04:00:34,221 --> 04:00:38,715
"Everybody say Long live Rama.
And our work will be done"

747
04:00:40,961 --> 04:00:45,557
"All the other names are untrue.
This is the only true one"

748
04:00:51,972 --> 04:00:56,739
"So take Lord Rama's name
and our work will be done"

749
04:01:10,924 --> 04:01:13,916
"If there's faith
in the strong one's... "

750
04:01:14,194 --> 04:01:16,526
Then even the weakest are boosted

751
04:01:21,701 --> 04:01:26,035
"See the magic of this name.
Even rocks float on water"

752
04:01:31,711 --> 04:01:36,205
"Troubles vanish in a jiffy and
one cuts the stormy seas smoothly"

753
04:01:40,954 --> 04:01:47,951
"And by the grace of Lord Rama
even a lamp burns in a tempest"

754
04:01:56,970 --> 04:02:02,499
"Ra... Ra... Ra...
'Ra' has a lot of power"

755
04:02:02,676 --> 04:02:08,512
"Ma... Ma... Ma...
'Ma' has salvation in it"

756
04:02:13,687 --> 04:02:18,021
"This is the way to sail
through the ocean of life"

757
04:02:23,530 --> 04:02:28,024
"Mere particle transformed into
the sun, in the form of a poet"

758
04:02:32,939 --> 04:02:37,933
"Ruminating on the word
MaRa, MaRa-Ma... RaMa... "

759
04:02:38,211 --> 04:02:40,202
"Even a robber
turned into a poet"

760
04:02:42,716 --> 04:02:46,948
"So everybody take Rama's name
and your work will be done"

761
04:02:50,557 --> 04:02:54,550
"All the other names are untrue.
Only this one is the truth"

762
04:03:01,167 --> 04:03:05,001
"So hosanna to Lord Rama
and your work will be done"

763
04:03:36,536 --> 04:03:38,527
Shall I fight Rama?

764
04:03:42,542 --> 04:03:44,533
Or shall I return Sita?

765
04:03:47,948 --> 04:03:49,939
I don't know what to do

766
04:03:54,220 --> 04:03:58,987
- Compromise with Lord Rama.
- Who are you?

767
04:03:59,492 --> 04:04:01,153
I'm wisdom.

768
04:04:01,261 --> 04:04:04,662
I'm a scholar myself.
I don't need your advice!

769
04:04:10,503 --> 04:04:16,499
"Rightly said, Lankesh.
Nobody is as wise as you"

770
04:04:17,510 --> 04:04:20,673
"- Who are you?
- Your companion, Ego!"

771
04:04:24,684 --> 04:04:28,017
"An egoist falls hard, Ravana.
- Who are you?"

772
04:04:28,521 --> 04:04:31,012
Your guide, subuddhi"

773
04:04:34,928 --> 04:04:40,696
Keeper of the weak!
Can you ever guide me properly?

774
04:04:40,934 --> 04:04:45,928
"Had it not been for me, you'd
have made Ravana into Rama's slave"

775
04:04:50,210 --> 04:04:55,204
Ill-advisor! You all will send
Ravana to his ruin one day

776
04:04:56,216 --> 04:05:00,482
"Ravana, beware of this lot.
I pardon you"

777
04:05:04,491 --> 04:05:10,487
Love! Ravana don't be led by him.
Fight a war with Rama

778
04:05:10,897 --> 04:05:13,889
You will win!
Sita will be yours too!

779
04:05:14,501 --> 04:05:19,996
"- But, who are you?
- Your well-wisher, Greed"

780
04:05:23,176 --> 04:05:27,510
- Greed is correct.
- Who are you?

781
04:05:27,680 --> 04:05:31,673
Lust.
Who inspired you to abduct Sita

782
04:05:32,519 --> 04:05:36,182
"If you return her,
people will call you a coward"

783
04:05:41,528 --> 04:05:45,191
- Lankesh!
- Who are you?

784
04:05:46,032 --> 04:05:49,695
Mercy. Don't listen to others.

785
04:05:50,537 --> 04:05:56,203
"Lust, Anger, Ego, Greed
will ruin your reputation"

786
04:05:56,709 --> 04:06:00,645
Listen to me. Return Sita
and seek Rama's mercy

787
04:06:05,485 --> 04:06:08,147
"- Shut up, you coward!
- Who are you?"

788
04:06:09,155 --> 04:06:10,144
Anger!

789
04:06:10,490 --> 04:06:13,482
"Ravana, you're the conqueror
of Heaven, Earth and Hell"

790
04:06:13,893 --> 04:06:17,158
"Who isn't afraid of you?
Fight Rama, I say!"

791
04:06:17,897 --> 04:06:20,161
"Battle it out with Rama,
and he'll be victorious"

792
04:06:20,500 --> 04:06:26,905
Hear! Hear!

793
04:06:27,173 --> 04:06:29,164
Quiet!

794
04:06:38,518 --> 04:06:41,919
"Laxman, you're taking me on?
Good!"

795
04:07:27,901 --> 04:07:31,166
Save Laxman, please"

796
04:07:33,673 --> 04:07:36,904
"- Very difficult.
- Don't say that, sir"

797
04:07:37,911 --> 04:07:44,908
"I'm willing to die in his place.
Save him somehow, sir"

798
04:07:45,919 --> 04:07:52,688
There's but one way.
If anyone brings Sanjivani herb...

799
04:07:53,526 --> 04:07:55,517
...then I can save him

800
04:07:57,197 --> 04:08:00,462
"Let me go, My Lord.
I'll get the herb"

801
04:08:00,867 --> 04:08:04,860
- Before the sunrise however.
- How do I recognise it?

802
04:08:05,471 --> 04:08:08,872
It emits light...
That's Sanjivani's identity

803
04:08:09,475 --> 04:08:11,466
Bless me, My Lord"

804
04:08:13,646 --> 04:08:17,138
- Praise to Lord Rama.
- But hurry back

805
04:09:00,860 --> 04:09:08,460
Every bush emits light here.
Can't make out the real one

806
04:09:13,640 --> 04:09:18,134
I'll carry the whole mountain.
He can pick the herb himself!

807
04:09:39,165 --> 04:09:44,501
Brother Laxman...
Open your eyes... Laxman...

808
04:09:45,905 --> 04:09:51,502
"Wake up, Laxman...
How will I face mother Sumitra?"

809
04:09:54,180 --> 04:09:56,171
Wake up, brother"

810
04:10:02,522 --> 04:10:04,513
Hanuman has come

811
04:10:21,207 --> 04:10:23,198
Better hurry, sir"

812
04:10:27,046 --> 04:10:30,709
I had asked you to bring the herb.
You brought the whole hillock?

813
04:10:30,950 --> 04:10:34,716
What could I do? I saw
light in every herb and bush

814
04:10:34,954 --> 04:10:39,220
So I got confused.
Thought I'd take the whole hillock

815
04:10:39,559 --> 04:10:41,720
So you can pick what you want

816
04:11:36,549 --> 04:11:38,540
- Where's Meghnad?
- Laxman!

817
04:11:38,951 --> 04:11:40,942
Brother, you?"

818
04:11:58,671 --> 04:12:01,902
"Coward! Hearing my challenge,
you're folding your hands?"

819
04:12:04,177 --> 04:12:08,170
"I'm not bowing to the warrior,
but the scholar in you!"

820
04:12:09,182 --> 04:12:12,015
War is fought with
a scholarly-warrior

821
04:12:12,185 --> 04:12:14,517
Then arm yourself!
- Take guard!

822
04:13:25,191 --> 04:13:28,183
His naval contains ambrosia.
That's why he doesn't die

823
04:13:28,528 --> 04:13:30,519
"Shoot an arrow in
his naval, O' Lord"

824
04:13:45,044 --> 04:13:47,205
Long live Lord Rama

825
04:13:50,283 --> 04:13:54,219
"Laxman, Ravana isn't just a scholar
of our vedas"

826
04:13:54,954 --> 04:13:56,945
He's a great politician too

827
04:13:57,223 --> 04:13:59,657
"Before he dies, go and learn
politics from him"

828
04:14:06,499 --> 04:14:14,497
"- O' renowned scholar, Ravana.
- Who is it? Laxman?"

829
04:14:16,509 --> 04:14:20,172
- What do you want?
- I've come to learn politics from you

830
04:14:22,915 --> 04:14:27,011
What did you say?
Learn politics from me?

831
04:14:28,521 --> 04:14:37,691
"- Who sent you?
- I did. My respects, sir"

832
04:14:38,531 --> 04:14:40,522
A long life to you

833
04:14:42,702 --> 04:14:48,698
See Laxman? See how you
and Lord Rama differ

834
04:14:50,710 --> 04:14:55,943
Knowledge is procured sitting
at the feet. Not on the head!

835
04:15:08,494 --> 04:15:12,658
Listen carefully, Laxman... "

836
04:15:15,901 --> 04:15:21,498
"Harmony, cost, punishment
and division. "

837
04:15:23,175 --> 04:15:26,667
One who uses these qualities
fairly as per the circumstances...

838
04:15:27,913 --> 04:15:30,507
...is a true politician

839
04:15:33,686 --> 04:15:39,921
Teacher, minister, doctor... "

840
04:15:41,193 --> 04:15:46,529
watchman, neighbour... "

841
04:15:49,035 --> 04:15:52,937
...and brother. One should
never have enmity with them.

842
04:15:57,543 --> 04:16:01,479
"Knowing this, you locked
horns with Lord Rama?"

843
04:16:03,482 --> 04:16:08,476
Had I not done that...
how would I have won?

844
04:16:09,155 --> 04:16:11,988
Won? What do you mean?

845
04:16:13,492 --> 04:16:19,658
"Lord Rama, I didn't let you come
in Lanka, while I lived"

846
04:16:21,167 --> 04:16:27,003
"But today, I'm going to
Heaven in your presence"

847
04:16:28,674 --> 04:16:30,665
Lord Rama...

848
04:17:04,477 --> 04:17:06,468
Lord Rama...

849
04:17:11,650 --> 04:17:16,144
"Sita is pure. With her touch,
I too have been purified"

850
04:17:16,489 --> 04:17:18,480
Accept her, Rama"

851
04:17:22,495 --> 04:17:24,895
- Dear husband...
- Dear Sita...

852
04:17:25,498 --> 04:17:30,902
Praise Lord Rama.
And mother Sita too...

853
04:17:55,928 --> 04:17:58,863
"Hanuman, what do you
want as a reward?"

854
04:17:59,465 --> 04:18:06,633
- An eternal place at your feet.
- We'll never be away from you

855
04:18:06,872 --> 04:18:09,864
My Lord!
I want nothing else now.

856
04:18:10,476 --> 04:18:14,879
"Hanuman, you risked your life
to reunite me with my husband"

857
04:18:14,980 --> 04:18:19,474
And you should go unrewarded?
In form of a gift...

858
04:18:20,653 --> 04:18:22,644
...take these necklace of beads

859
04:19:03,462 --> 04:19:06,454
"Hanuman, why are you
biting those beads?"

860
04:19:06,866 --> 04:19:10,632
- I'm looking for Rama in them.
- Surprising!

861
04:19:11,871 --> 04:19:16,137
"An intelligent devotee like you,
searches for Rama in these?"

862
04:19:16,642 --> 04:19:20,635
"If there's no "Ram" in them,
they mean nothing to me!"

863
04:19:26,886 --> 04:19:28,877
- Then your body's useless too.
- Why?

864
04:19:29,221 --> 04:19:30,483
Because it has no Rama

865
04:19:30,656 --> 04:19:33,989
"O' learned one,
my body has no life in it"

866
04:19:34,894 --> 04:19:38,489
- But it has Rama and Sita in it.
- Any proof?

867
04:19:39,164 --> 04:19:41,155
Proof?

868
04:19:43,168 --> 04:19:47,502
"A devotee's reputation
is in your hands, My Lord!"

869
04:19:50,509 --> 04:19:51,999
Praise Lord Rama!

870
04:19:52,177 --> 04:19:58,912
"Raghupati, Raghav, King Rama.
Holy two-some, Sita-Rama"

871
04:20:21,206 --> 04:20:25,199
"Forgive me, husband.
I'm innocent"

872
04:20:25,711 --> 04:20:27,702
- Have mercy.
- Show mercy?

873
04:20:27,947 --> 04:20:29,938
To a slut like you? Get going!

874
04:20:30,549 --> 04:20:33,541
Why are you hitting her?
What has she done?

875
04:20:33,719 --> 04:20:37,052
I'll tell you. She was away
two nights without my permission

876
04:20:37,222 --> 04:20:39,213
- I had gone to my father's...
- Lies!

877
04:20:39,558 --> 04:20:41,549
I won't repeat this mistake

878
04:20:41,660 --> 04:20:43,958
You may or may not.
But I can't forgive you

879
04:20:44,229 --> 04:20:48,962
"A spoken word, a woman's foot...
Once it's out, it's out forever"

880
04:20:49,134 --> 04:20:51,125
>From today you're dead to me!

881
04:20:51,737 --> 04:20:55,229
I beg you dear husband.
Don't discard me like this

882
04:20:55,574 --> 04:20:57,064
Get lost!

883
04:20:57,977 --> 04:20:59,911
I'm no Rama to keep
you in the house!

884
04:21:00,012 --> 04:21:03,914
"Shut up! You talk like this
about the great glorious, Rama?"

885
04:21:04,183 --> 04:21:07,914
"Not just me, but every child
in Ayodhya is saying it"

886
04:21:08,187 --> 04:21:11,918
Ram accepted Sita even after
staying with Ravana for months!

887
04:21:12,024 --> 04:21:14,015
But I'll not accept her!

888
04:21:15,527 --> 04:21:19,190
What a joyous day!
Mother has asked me to tell you...

889
04:21:19,932 --> 04:21:22,924
"- What?
- Well, just that... "

890
04:21:23,202 --> 04:21:26,694
Come on, tell me"

891
04:21:27,206 --> 04:21:30,937
- You're not to eat spicy things.
- Put your step carefully

892
04:21:31,543 --> 04:21:35,707
And what about you?
- What will she advice us?

893
04:21:36,215 --> 04:21:40,709
The usual. Not to lift
heavy things. Not to eat mud!

894
04:21:41,553 --> 04:21:43,544
Your Majesty!
His Majesty is here

895
04:21:53,565 --> 04:21:59,162
"- Welcome, your Majesty.
- I've come to congratulate you"

896
04:22:02,508 --> 04:22:07,912
"Sita, this is a very happy
moment in a woman's life"

897
04:22:08,514 --> 04:22:16,011
- And isn't it so in a man's life?
- Why not? Your joy is my joy too

898
04:22:21,693 --> 04:22:23,684
And...

899
04:22:26,532 --> 04:22:29,695
- Sita's desires?
- Are my desires too

900
04:22:30,702 --> 04:22:34,934
"- Tell me, what do you desire?
- Don't know why, but... "

901
04:22:36,208 --> 04:22:40,804
...I feel like visiting groves
and wives of the ascetics

902
04:22:40,946 --> 04:22:44,040
That's a very pious desire.
I'll make arrangements right away

903
04:22:52,724 --> 04:22:56,717
- What's your complaint Lady?
- My husband has discarded me

904
04:22:56,962 --> 04:22:59,988
- I want justice My Lord.
- You'll get it in the royal court.

905
04:23:00,899 --> 04:23:04,494
Take her respectfully
to the guest house

906
04:23:06,171 --> 04:23:12,007
Dear husband... are you worried?
- No.

907
04:23:13,512 --> 04:23:17,676
How cruel are those husbands
who throw their wives out

908
04:23:18,517 --> 04:23:23,011
They're heartless.
They aren't fit to be humans!

909
04:23:23,922 --> 04:23:26,186
I can't stand injustice to woman

910
04:23:30,195 --> 04:23:32,527
Long live the King!

911
04:23:42,541 --> 04:23:46,204
"O washerman, what you said then,
you'll have to say it here"

912
04:23:46,545 --> 04:23:50,037
I... I...
I just...

913
04:23:50,215 --> 04:23:54,549
You needn't be scared.
Say what you want to frankly

914
04:23:54,953 --> 04:23:57,717
I've been humiliated by this
woman in my community

915
04:23:58,223 --> 04:23:59,155
How?

916
04:23:59,491 --> 04:24:02,153
She stayed out two nights
without my permission

917
04:24:03,162 --> 04:24:06,996
"Dear lady, you should apologise
to your husband for this folly"

918
04:24:07,499 --> 04:24:12,994
- I'll never forgive her!
- Oh! Why not?

919
04:24:13,238 --> 04:24:16,503
"Not just me, but the
whole community has doubts"

920
04:24:16,842 --> 04:24:21,506
Doubt without proof is futile.
And to doubt a woman's character...

921
04:24:21,613 --> 04:24:24,514
...without proof is a heinous
crime in my eyes

922
04:24:24,917 --> 04:24:28,910
Isn't it sin to accept her back
having proof of her folly?

923
04:24:29,021 --> 04:24:31,182
He's slinging mud at
the dignity of the King!

924
04:24:31,523 --> 04:24:34,515
My job is to clean mud
not to sling it!

925
04:24:34,860 --> 04:24:38,694
- You're crossing your limits!
- But I'm telling the truth

926
04:24:42,534 --> 04:24:49,201
Quiet! In my realm everyone's
equal and free to voice his opinion

927
04:24:49,875 --> 04:24:54,539
"You can lynch me if you like,
but I ask you this"

928
04:24:54,713 --> 04:24:56,943
How many amongst you will
take back a wife...

929
04:24:57,049 --> 04:25:00,883
...who has stayed in the house
of your enemy? Tell me

930
04:25:03,222 --> 04:25:05,213
Answer me

931
04:25:07,492 --> 04:25:10,154
"Today, the King and his people
both shall get justice"

932
04:25:12,497 --> 04:25:14,897
Sita has been tested-by-fire
in Lanka.

933
04:25:15,500 --> 04:25:17,491
We didn't see it.

934
04:25:18,170 --> 04:25:21,662
Do the people of Ayodhya
doubt Sita's innocence?

935
04:25:54,206 --> 04:25:58,040
"Tears, and in your eyes?
But why?"

936
04:25:59,144 --> 04:26:05,640
I have to abandon Queen Sita.
- Abandon the Queen?

937
04:26:08,487 --> 04:26:13,151
- What's her crime?
- That she's innocent

938
04:26:13,492 --> 04:26:15,483
And even then you'll abandon her?

939
04:26:15,994 --> 04:26:20,658
"The people doubt Sita,
who stayed with Ravana"

940
04:26:20,899 --> 04:26:25,495
Doubt! What right do
they have to doubt her?

941
04:26:27,172 --> 04:26:31,905
"If a King has a right over his
people, they too have a right on him"

942
04:26:32,911 --> 04:26:37,177
I'll have to abandon Sita
to support the people

943
04:26:38,517 --> 04:26:41,680
"Laxman, take her to
the grove tomorrow"

944
04:26:41,920 --> 04:26:43,911
No!
No brother!

945
04:26:44,523 --> 04:26:47,515
I'll never obey this order from you

946
04:26:50,696 --> 04:26:57,693
"Laxman, this is an acid-test.
Be firm like a rock. "

947
04:26:57,969 --> 04:27:01,871
No... I can never do this.
I just can't.

948
04:27:02,074 --> 04:27:07,637
Then shall I accept that
Laxman will not obey Rama henceforth?

949
04:27:08,146 --> 04:27:10,137
O brother!

950
04:27:12,651 --> 04:27:15,142
Then leave Sita
in the grove tomorrow morning

951
04:27:18,156 --> 04:27:20,647
Life without ideals is useless

952
04:27:22,494 --> 04:27:25,486
At times, an ideal life is futile"

953
04:27:53,191 --> 04:27:57,184
"Excuse me, Your Majesty, but
nobody can meet His Majesty today"

954
04:27:57,596 --> 04:28:00,121
- Why not?
- Because those are his orders

955
04:28:01,133 --> 04:28:03,124
Can't even I meet him?

956
04:28:05,137 --> 04:28:10,131
A devotee can't see her Lord?
Why? What's the matter?

957
04:28:10,642 --> 04:28:15,136
- Nobody can meet His Majesty.
- You don't know it...

958
04:28:15,480 --> 04:28:19,143
...but he has arranged
for me to go to the grove

959
04:28:20,152 --> 04:28:24,987
May be he has forgotten it.
Just sound him and he'll run here

960
04:28:25,657 --> 04:28:29,650
"- Go on. Go and tell him.
- How, your Majesty?"

961
04:28:29,895 --> 04:28:33,991
"- He has locked the door.
- Not of his heart, I hope!"

962
04:28:37,502 --> 04:28:40,994
Dear husband...
Open the door

963
04:28:42,908 --> 04:28:45,172
Open the door, please"

964
04:28:50,916 --> 04:28:52,907
He really has shut the door.

965
04:28:54,019 --> 04:28:57,011
He's so busy with the
welfare of his people...

966
04:28:57,522 --> 04:28:59,615
...he can't even hear me!

967
04:29:01,126 --> 04:29:03,117
This royal duty sure is queer

968
04:29:05,630 --> 04:29:11,466
"Our life in exile was much better.
There, he was only mine"

969
04:29:12,471 --> 04:29:14,462
"Here, I've to share
him with everybody"

970
04:29:16,875 --> 04:29:19,639
Your Majesty, the chariot is ready"

971
04:30:09,528 --> 04:30:13,521
Laxman, your brother's so good"

972
04:30:13,698 --> 04:30:19,193
I just said I wanted to see
the sacred grove and he arranged it

973
04:30:24,543 --> 04:30:29,708
"Laxman, why don't you talk?
Are you angry with me?"

974
04:30:31,216 --> 04:30:34,947
- No.
- You're crying? What's the matter?

975
04:30:35,053 --> 04:30:39,547
"Stop the chariot at once!
Stop, I say! Laxman! Stop!"

976
04:30:49,968 --> 04:30:53,563
"Tell me, why are you crying?
Answer me"

977
04:30:58,577 --> 04:31:00,511
For my sake, Laxman"

978
04:31:02,514 --> 04:31:07,679
"Because you stayed in Lanka,
the people here criticize you"

979
04:31:09,187 --> 04:31:14,022
- And you're crying for that?
- No.

980
04:31:14,926 --> 04:31:19,920
I'm crying because even after
knowing you're innocent...

981
04:31:20,532 --> 04:31:23,023
...Lord Rama has decided
to abandon you!

982
04:31:27,539 --> 04:31:34,707
Lord Rama has abandoned me?
O Lord...

983
04:31:56,735 --> 04:32:01,502
"Mother Ganges, hide me
in your lap of waves"

984
04:32:03,241 --> 04:32:06,005
"My husband, Lord Rama
has discarded me"

985
04:32:06,911 --> 04:32:10,904
A mother's door is always
open for her daughter

986
04:32:11,683 --> 04:32:14,914
Even a father has a special place
in his heart for his daughter

987
04:32:15,520 --> 04:32:18,683
"- Who are you?
- Your father, Valmiki"

988
04:32:20,191 --> 04:32:23,922
"- Please let me die, O sage.
- You alone don't have a right... "

989
04:32:24,029 --> 04:32:28,022
"... over your life, my dear.
You'll have to live for Rama's heirs"

990
04:32:28,533 --> 04:32:31,195
How can I? Where will I go?
Where will I stay?

991
04:32:31,536 --> 04:32:35,939
- In my hermitage.
- What if the wives of the sages ask...

992
04:32:36,541 --> 04:32:38,532
why did your husband discard you?

993
04:32:38,943 --> 04:32:43,209
"I'll answer for you.
Come, my dear"

994
04:32:55,560 --> 04:32:57,551
This is your hermitage

995
04:33:06,671 --> 04:33:10,903
- Gautami...
- Master...

996
04:33:22,020 --> 04:33:24,011
Yes, Master?"

997
04:33:25,690 --> 04:33:28,682
- This is...
- She's my daughter.

998
04:33:28,927 --> 04:33:31,521
Really?
Her name?

999
04:33:31,930 --> 04:33:37,027
Name?
Her name is... Vandevi

1000
04:33:37,936 --> 04:33:42,703
Where has she come from?
- From her in-law's place

1001
04:33:42,941 --> 04:33:48,538
She has now come to me.
- Will she stay here for some time?

1002
04:33:48,646 --> 04:33:51,547
Ofcourse.
- How nice!

1003
04:33:51,950 --> 04:33:53,941
Come, my dear. "

1004
04:34:00,158 --> 04:34:06,154
Sita! Sita!

1005
04:34:14,506 --> 04:34:16,497
My Lord...

1006
04:35:03,888 --> 04:35:08,154
"Master, what shall we name them?
- Name?"

1007
04:35:12,497 --> 04:35:16,991
He will be Luv.
And this will be Kush

1008
04:35:19,504 --> 04:35:24,498
One who is invincible is Luv.
And the one who purifies...

1009
04:35:24,609 --> 04:35:29,512
...the atmosphere is Kush.
Luv and Kush

1010
04:35:35,687 --> 04:35:39,680
Twelve years have gone.
I abandoned Sita for my people

1011
04:35:41,526 --> 04:35:43,687
"Sometimes I wonder, why didn't
I abdicate instead?"

1012
04:35:48,199 --> 04:35:51,691
"Master, what do the people
want from me?"

1013
04:35:51,936 --> 04:35:56,930
"They want you to be an emperor
and wish you to perform "Ashwamedh"

1014
04:35:57,208 --> 04:36:00,871
Really? And who will sit
beside me when I do it?

1015
04:36:01,145 --> 04:36:08,142
- Your wife.
- Sita?

1016
04:36:09,153 --> 04:36:12,145
- You've abandoned her.
- Then?

1017
04:36:12,891 --> 04:36:14,882
You'll have to remarry

1018
04:36:18,496 --> 04:36:24,992
"Sir, can a woman marry another
man when her husband's alive?"

1019
04:36:25,670 --> 04:36:26,659
No.

1020
04:36:26,905 --> 04:36:30,170
Then how can a man remarry
when his first wife is still alive?

1021
04:36:33,177 --> 04:36:39,514
"I'll not do this injustice.
Sorry, but I refuse to marry again"

1022
04:36:39,918 --> 04:36:42,182
I'll never marry again.
Never!

1023
04:36:47,191 --> 04:36:52,185
"- What are you doing, boys?
- Punishing this washerman. "

1024
04:36:52,530 --> 04:36:54,521
He's the cause of
mother Sita's sorrow

1025
04:36:54,699 --> 04:36:59,636
- So we'll punish Rama too.
- To us they're both equally guilty.

1026
04:36:59,871 --> 04:37:03,466
"Don't say that, boys.
Rama is people's guardian"

1027
04:37:03,875 --> 04:37:07,971
- Very law abiding and just.
- In Ramayan you blamed Kaikayi

1028
04:37:08,146 --> 04:37:12,640
"And you call Rama, the one who
abandoned Sita, a just King?"

1029
04:37:12,884 --> 04:37:18,652
"No boys, Rama didn't abandon her.
He forsaked his own wishes... "

1030
04:37:18,756 --> 04:37:23,489
...for the sake of his people.
He taught the world...

1031
04:37:23,661 --> 04:37:26,653
...the kinds of sacrifices a King
has to do for his people

1032
04:37:27,165 --> 04:37:30,896
- Rama is the best.
- Then are we anything less?

1033
04:37:31,169 --> 04:37:35,902
How can you be? You're also
the progeny of a great person

1034
04:37:37,508 --> 04:37:40,170
Now go and study.
Go on

1035
04:37:42,180 --> 04:37:45,911
And who's your father?
- Didn't Master say...

1036
04:37:46,017 --> 04:37:49,680
we're the son's of a great man.
- And what's his name?

1037
04:37:50,088 --> 04:37:57,517
- His name?
- Tell us... come on

1038
04:37:57,929 --> 04:38:01,865
They'll tell only if they knew it!
- The poor things have no father...

1039
04:38:01,966 --> 04:38:04,867
So how will they know his name?
- Shut up!

1040
04:38:07,138 --> 04:38:11,131
Mother!
Mother!

1041
04:38:14,479 --> 04:38:19,143
Why? What's the matter?
Why are you so upset?

1042
04:38:19,484 --> 04:38:21,884
- Boys insult us.
- They make fun of us.

1043
04:38:22,887 --> 04:38:23,876
Why?

1044
04:38:23,988 --> 04:38:26,479
Because we can't tell them
our father's name

1045
04:38:29,660 --> 04:38:31,890
"Tell us Mom,
who is our father?"

1046
04:38:34,665 --> 04:38:38,658
You boys didn't ask till now.
- So we're asking you today. Tell us

1047
04:38:40,505 --> 04:38:43,906
Your father's name is...
- Yes Mom? Hurry up

1048
04:38:44,108 --> 04:38:46,099
How can I?

1049
04:38:46,511 --> 04:38:48,672
Do you have any difficulty
in telling us?

1050
04:38:48,913 --> 04:38:50,904
"- Is he sinful?
- No, no... "

1051
04:38:51,015 --> 04:38:53,006
Is he a demon then?
- No

1052
04:38:53,117 --> 04:38:56,018
Is he cruel or a killer then?
- No! No! No!

1053
04:39:08,466 --> 04:39:12,869
O' clouds...

1054
04:39:12,970 --> 04:39:17,964
"pour out as a proxy
to the tears in my eyes"

1055
04:39:19,477 --> 04:39:26,144
"O' lightning, represent my feelings
with a thunderbolt"

1056
04:39:29,887 --> 04:39:36,656
"O' clouds, pour out as a proxy
to the tears in my eyes"

1057
04:39:53,678 --> 04:40:00,516
"O' shroud of mist,
hold back the thunder within. "

1058
04:40:09,527 --> 04:40:16,194
"Today make do with
my compassionate voice"

1059
04:40:33,050 --> 04:40:39,956
"My eyes are one
with the rainy season"

1060
04:40:40,958 --> 04:40:45,224
O' clouds...

1061
04:40:45,563 --> 04:40:50,557
pour rain as tears through my eyes

1062
04:41:07,018 --> 04:41:14,015
"I'm swallowing poison
thinking it to be nectar"

1063
04:41:22,934 --> 04:41:29,703
"Like a fish helplessly striving
for life without water"

1064
04:41:30,708 --> 04:41:37,705
"I am being restless
with the jolts of fate"

1065
04:41:38,716 --> 04:41:42,948
O' clouds...

1066
04:41:43,054 --> 04:41:47,957
"pour out as a proxy
to the tears in my eyes"

1067
04:41:48,960 --> 04:41:55,957
"O' lightning, convey my heartfelt
with a thunderbolt"

1068
04:41:59,503 --> 04:42:06,170
"O' clouds, pour out like
the tears in my eyes"

1069
04:42:10,514 --> 04:42:12,914
My dear...

1070
04:42:15,519 --> 04:42:17,510
O Sage...

1071
04:42:21,525 --> 04:42:24,688
Master...
- I understand your problem

1072
04:42:25,529 --> 04:42:29,192
How long will I hide their
father's name from my sons?

1073
04:42:29,533 --> 04:42:33,025
The time is ripe. Your sons
will know their father's name

1074
04:42:33,537 --> 04:42:36,938
And the world will know
their lineage

1075
04:42:37,942 --> 04:42:42,208
Long live the King of Ayodhya
Lord Rama...

1076
04:42:56,560 --> 04:43:01,657
- Mom! Mom!
- What is it children?

1077
04:43:03,501 --> 04:43:08,666
- Please let us go with Master.
- Where is he going?

1078
04:43:08,773 --> 04:43:10,900
Ayodhya.
- Ayodhya!

1079
04:43:11,909 --> 04:43:14,673
"Yes. There we'll see
the Master's ideal... "

1080
04:43:15,179 --> 04:43:18,671
"the hero of his epic "Ramayan",
Lord Rama!"

1081
04:43:18,916 --> 04:43:20,508
See the cruel people there!

1082
04:43:20,918 --> 04:43:25,184
Children!
Then why go to such a place?

1083
04:43:25,523 --> 04:43:33,191
"We'll apply the dust on which Sita
has trend to our forehead, mother"

1084
04:43:33,531 --> 04:43:35,931
"What's the matter, Mom?
What's wrong?"

1085
04:43:36,534 --> 04:43:41,699
"- What is it, Mom? Tell us.
- It's nothing, son. Nothing"

1086
04:43:43,708 --> 04:43:47,200
Any idea why the Master
is going to Ayodhya

1087
04:43:47,712 --> 04:43:49,703
I'll tell you.

1088
04:43:54,218 --> 04:43:58,655
Go and study boys. Go on

1089
04:44:04,495 --> 04:44:11,663
I've been invited to Ayodhya.
- An invitation? From Ayodhya?

1090
04:44:12,169 --> 04:44:14,899
"Yes. Lord Rama is performing
the "Ashwamedh" ritual. "

1091
04:44:16,907 --> 04:44:21,003
He's performing "Ashwamedh"?"

1092
04:44:21,512 --> 04:44:25,846
Yes. He's truly a rare king

1093
04:44:26,016 --> 04:44:28,507
How can he do that ritual
without a wife beside him?

1094
04:44:29,687 --> 04:44:36,024
"He had abandoned me physically.
Today, I'm no longer in his heart. "

1095
04:44:37,528 --> 04:44:42,693
"You tell me, O Sage.
How do I live? On what hope?"

1096
04:44:44,535 --> 04:44:47,936
Take courage. I'll go to
Ayodhya and see for myself

1097
04:44:48,205 --> 04:44:54,041
"If Lord Rama has remarried,
then he's not the hero of my epic... "

1098
04:44:54,211 --> 04:44:55,542
...but some other Rama.

1099
04:44:55,713 --> 04:45:00,650
"My devotion, my faith and even
my epic poem Ramayan is untrue!"

1100
04:45:39,523 --> 04:45:44,517
We can see dents even...

1101
04:45:44,628 --> 04:45:49,531
...in the glory of Rama

1102
04:45:51,535 --> 04:45:56,529
And recite Ramayan to you...

1103
04:45:56,707 --> 04:46:01,644
"... written with the
the tears of a woman"

1104
04:46:03,147 --> 04:46:08,141
We'll have the stars
convey it to you...

1105
04:46:08,486 --> 04:46:13,480
...the new resonance of the embers

1106
04:46:14,492 --> 04:46:17,154
We're not reciting the hymns...

1107
04:46:17,495 --> 04:46:25,493
but a song of atrocity

1108
04:46:32,510 --> 04:46:41,179
"Till the sorrows of the Sitas'
of this country aren't crushed... "

1109
04:46:41,685 --> 04:46:43,676
O' Ram...

1110
04:46:43,921 --> 04:46:52,693
"your Ramayan will
never be complete"

1111
04:46:53,197 --> 04:46:55,188
It will never be complete

1112
04:46:55,533 --> 04:47:01,961
"The sorrow of
the Sitas' of India... "

1113
04:47:18,489 --> 04:47:27,488
"Till a man tests a woman...
- And find faults in her"

1114
04:47:27,898 --> 04:47:36,499
"As long as he doesn't trust her.
- He'll test her by fire"

1115
04:47:41,178 --> 04:47:46,172
Until this stigma on womanhood...

1116
04:47:46,517 --> 04:47:50,180
"these flames will not accept
this act of sacrifice"

1117
04:47:50,521 --> 04:47:52,512
O' Ram...

1118
04:47:52,690 --> 04:48:01,120
"... your Ramayan will
never be complete till then"

1119
04:48:01,865 --> 04:48:03,856
It will never be complete

1120
04:48:04,134 --> 04:48:10,130
The sorrows of Sitas' in India...

1121
04:48:26,657 --> 04:48:31,151
When the Ruler of Rama's Raj...

1122
04:48:31,495 --> 04:48:35,659
Listens to a washerman...

1123
04:48:46,910 --> 04:48:51,176
The mother of India's future...

1124
04:48:51,515 --> 04:48:55,679
Will be abandoned in a grove...

1125
04:49:02,459 --> 04:49:04,450
The poet Valmiki...

1126
04:49:06,864 --> 04:49:15,465
"Till the quill of poet Valmiki
is filled to the brim to write... "

1127
04:49:15,873 --> 04:49:17,864
O' Ram...

1128
04:49:18,075 --> 04:49:26,642
"your Ramayan will not
be complete till then"

1129
04:49:26,884 --> 04:49:28,875
It will never be complete

1130
04:49:29,153 --> 04:49:38,152
"Till the sorrows of Sitas'
of this country aren't crushed"

1131
04:49:38,495 --> 04:49:40,486
O' Ram...

1132
04:49:40,597 --> 04:49:48,902
"... your Ramayan will
never be complete"

1133
04:49:49,506 --> 04:49:51,497
It will never be complete

1134
04:49:51,675 --> 04:49:57,170
The sorrows of the Sitas' of India

1135
04:49:59,183 --> 04:50:02,516
When moral becomes immoral...

1136
04:50:03,520 --> 04:50:06,921
"And torments
a woman's pious life... "

1137
04:50:07,524 --> 04:50:11,187
"Then the sun sets on the
decency of a chaste woman"

1138
04:50:12,196 --> 04:50:15,927
"When Goddess Jagadamba
Herself burns in the flames... "

1139
04:50:16,700 --> 04:50:19,931
"The Goddess burns
in the flames... "

1140
04:50:28,946 --> 04:50:34,213
- See Luv? Lord Rama has gone.
- He's as bad as his subjects!

1141
04:50:34,551 --> 04:50:36,542
Let's go, Kush"

1142
04:50:37,554 --> 04:50:42,548
Heard what those boys said?
Even after seeing Rama's sorrow...

1143
04:50:42,726 --> 04:50:46,719
"And hearing Sita's story,
don't your hearts ache?"

1144
04:50:46,964 --> 04:50:49,728
The story doesn't erase the
stigma from Sita's head!

1145
04:50:50,734 --> 04:50:55,068
Let Sita always be pure.
But remember...

1146
04:50:55,572 --> 04:50:59,508
The stigma on the people of
Ayodhya will never be erased!

1147
04:51:00,177 --> 04:51:04,511
He's right. Till this wicked
washerman is living...

1148
04:51:04,615 --> 04:51:06,606
...the stigma on Ayodhya
will never be erased

1149
04:51:10,187 --> 04:51:14,920
Mom!
Mom!

1150
04:51:15,926 --> 04:51:19,191
Dear children, Luv and Kush"

1151
04:51:20,531 --> 04:51:23,022
"Tell me, what did you
see in Ayodhya?"

1152
04:51:23,534 --> 04:51:29,530
"We saw the cruel people there.
- And their puppet, King Rama"

1153
04:51:30,274 --> 04:51:33,710
Saw the cunning man who killed
Ravana with Vibhishan's help

1154
04:51:33,944 --> 04:51:37,038
Saw that coward who killed
Vali from behind a tree

1155
04:51:37,548 --> 04:51:38,947
Kush!

1156
04:51:39,550 --> 04:51:42,212
Saw that sinner who threw
Sita out of his house!

1157
04:51:42,953 --> 04:51:46,218
"Had I not been scared of Master,
I'd have killed Rama there and then!"

1158
04:52:04,508 --> 04:52:06,499
My dear...

1159
04:52:13,016 --> 04:52:16,918
You shouldn't have hit the boys.
- O wise one...

1160
04:52:22,192 --> 04:52:29,189
They were mocking Lord Rama.
- I had given them the right to do so

1161
04:52:29,933 --> 04:52:33,699
Let them judge Lord Rama
from their own experience

1162
04:52:34,705 --> 04:52:38,698
- You mean Lord Rama...
- hasn't married again

1163
04:52:40,711 --> 04:52:43,703
O' Master...

1164
04:52:47,217 --> 04:52:53,952
"Dear Lord, I doubted my husband.
I'm guilty. "

1165
04:52:55,959 --> 04:52:59,156
Please forgive me Lord Rama.
Have mercy

1166
04:53:02,900 --> 04:53:05,664
Luv-Kush!

1167
04:53:35,933 --> 04:53:38,925
Boys...
- O' Mom! Mom!

1168
04:53:42,539 --> 04:53:46,703
I'll not hit you again.
I'll never raise my hand on you

1169
04:53:48,545 --> 04:53:50,706
- Don't cry...
- O Mom!

1170
04:53:54,952 --> 04:53:57,716
Luv-Kush!
- What is it?

1171
04:53:57,955 --> 04:54:01,482
A beautiful horse has
come in the grove

1172
04:54:01,658 --> 04:54:03,990
Really? Let's go

1173
04:54:22,012 --> 04:54:26,915
"Let go of the horse boys.
- No, we won't"

1174
04:54:27,017 --> 04:54:29,008
- You won't?
- No!

1175
04:54:33,690 --> 04:54:39,526
"The King of Ayodhya, Lord Rama...
Lord Rama, eh?"

1176
04:54:42,532 --> 04:54:49,938
"After the ritual of "Ashwamedh"
this horse is let loose"

1177
04:54:50,207 --> 04:54:54,541
Whoever stops this steed
will have to fight the King!

1178
04:54:54,711 --> 04:54:59,478
"- Boys, let this horse go.
- It belongs to Lord Rama"

1179
04:54:59,583 --> 04:55:01,574
We know

1180
04:55:05,889 --> 04:55:09,484
"Your Majesty, those ascetic boys
have wounded Laxman"

1181
04:55:10,160 --> 04:55:11,889
Surprising!

1182
04:55:12,162 --> 04:55:15,654
Get my chariot.
I'll test those boys myself

1183
04:55:25,675 --> 04:55:27,666
Stop right there!

1184
04:55:49,699 --> 04:55:52,930
- Who are your parents?
- We don't want to name our father

1185
04:55:53,203 --> 04:55:56,934
And our mother is Sati Vandevi.
- Vandevi?

1186
04:55:57,207 --> 04:55:58,868
And we are Luv-Kush

1187
04:55:59,142 --> 04:56:04,136
- Why did you stop my horse?
- To fight you!

1188
04:56:04,481 --> 04:56:06,472
We defeated your brother
and send them packing

1189
04:56:06,583 --> 04:56:07,982
Luv-Kush!

1190
04:56:08,151 --> 04:56:10,881
"Don't scold, Sire.
Take your bow and arrow"

1191
04:56:11,154 --> 04:56:12,883
That arrow with which
you killed Vali from behind

1192
04:56:12,989 --> 04:56:16,481
That arrow with which you
killed Ravana with Vibhishan's help

1193
04:56:16,893 --> 04:56:20,488
"- Such pride?
- Not pride, but confidence"

1194
04:56:20,897 --> 04:56:22,888
Then shoot!
- Stay guard

1195
04:56:23,166 --> 04:56:25,157
- Hosanna to Master.
- To our Mother...

1196
04:56:26,503 --> 04:56:28,494
Stop!

1197
04:56:31,508 --> 04:56:34,500
"Sita!
- Stop it, boys"

1198
04:56:38,181 --> 04:56:40,172
Sita...

1199
04:56:47,190 --> 04:56:48,179
Get aside, Mom. "

1200
04:56:48,525 --> 04:56:51,187
Step aside and
watch Lord Rama's defeat

1201
04:56:51,528 --> 04:56:53,928
Whom you praise night and day.
- Take your bow!

1202
04:56:54,197 --> 04:56:57,030
No...
- Wait boys... wait!

1203
04:56:57,934 --> 04:57:00,960
This conflict between father
and sons will create havoc!

1204
04:57:06,476 --> 04:57:08,467
Raghav...

1205
04:57:12,482 --> 04:57:16,475
"Great Sage, Valmiki...
My respects, sir. "

1206
04:57:16,653 --> 04:57:18,644
Bless you

1207
04:57:18,889 --> 04:57:26,660
Luv-Kush are your own sons.
Sita's blood runs in their veins

1208
04:57:30,667 --> 04:57:33,659
- O' great one!
- Yes

1209
04:57:35,505 --> 04:57:40,169
"Luv-Kush, fall at your
father's feet and seek forgiveness"

1210
04:57:46,183 --> 04:57:50,244
"- Go on, pay your respects.
- On Master's orders... "

1211
04:57:50,520 --> 04:57:52,511
we bow to you, father"

1212
04:57:55,525 --> 04:58:01,122
- My dear sons! Luv-Kush.
- Father...

1213
04:58:11,141 --> 04:58:13,132
Dear Sita...

1214
04:58:16,479 --> 04:58:18,470
Dear husband...

1215
04:58:41,004 --> 04:58:47,170
My Lord...
Tears in your eyes?

1216
04:58:49,079 --> 04:58:53,675
His eyes never dried of tears
after separation from his Sita

1217
04:58:54,684 --> 04:58:58,518
"Dear Rama, your people
have no doubt"

1218
04:59:00,624 --> 04:59:04,116
O Wise one!
Sita...

1219
04:59:10,467 --> 04:59:13,459
- Dear husband...
- Sita...

1220
04:59:20,644 --> 04:59:27,140
Today all my wishes are fulfilled.
The boys got their father's love...

1221
04:59:29,653 --> 04:59:32,645
I got my rightful place
in your heart

1222
04:59:34,491 --> 04:59:39,485
"Master got the fruit of his penance.
His epic "Ramayan" is complete now"

1223
04:59:41,498 --> 04:59:43,659
O Mother Earth...

1224
04:59:44,901 --> 04:59:48,667
"By giving birth to me,
you made my life worthy"

1225
04:59:53,510 --> 04:59:57,173
Today which other woman
is luckier than me?

1226
05:00:02,185 --> 05:00:08,920
"Take Sita in your lap, Mother.
Take me, Mother"

1227
05:00:21,938 --> 05:00:23,530
Sita...

1228
05:01:05,014 --> 05:01:08,677
"Make me one with you, Mother.
O' Mother... "

1229
05:01:09,519 --> 05:01:14,183
"Give me a place in
your heart, Mother"

1230
05:01:22,932 --> 05:01:24,524
Sita!

1231
05:01:32,542 --> 05:01:33,941
Mom!

1232
05:01:36,946 --> 05:01:40,040
Mother Earth!
Give me back my Sita

1233
05:01:41,551 --> 05:01:48,548
"Lord Rama is ordering you!
Be quick, else I'll send you to Hell!"

1234
05:01:55,231 --> 05:01:58,894
No, Mother Earth... No... "

1235
05:02:00,503 --> 05:02:04,496
I beg you for my Sita...

1236
05:02:05,508 --> 05:02:10,172
"Please return my
beloved Sita to me, Mother"

1237
05:02:28,198 --> 05:02:32,532
Blessed are you, O Sita. "

1238
05:02:34,537 --> 05:02:41,534
Holy as the water of the Ganges

1239
05:02:43,213 --> 05:02:47,047
In the history of virtuous woman,"

1240
05:02:47,951 --> 05:02:53,719
your name will be at the top

1241
05:02:56,960 --> 05:03:04,492
The saga of Valmiki's epic
poem is now complete

1242
05:03:05,168 --> 05:03:12,665
"Sita became one with Mother Earth.
And "Ramayan" was completed. "
