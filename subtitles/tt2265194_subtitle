1
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,901
Soldier of Vellimala

2
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,580
This is Vellimala village

3
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,186
There were chaos since day one

4
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,905
Water is overflowing
Call the kids

5
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,272
To prevent the frequent floods
and loss that occurred here...

6
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,679
...made the Government
decide to construct a dam

7
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,086
MATHRUBHOOMl
Construction of Vellimala Dam to begin soon

8
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,958
Attempts to sabotage the project led
to strong agitations by the people

9
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,931
Allow construction of Vellimala Dam
People's agitation committee

10
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:23,632
The agitation that even cost a life
resulted in Vellimala dam becoming a reality

11
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:30,401
Today the dam is responsible
for our houses getting power supply

12
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:50,694
Another facility this dam provides is
an ideal spot for people to commit suicide!

13
00:03:55,768 --> 00:04:00,034
The strong undercurrents and
the rocky bed beneath makes it...

14
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,839
...possible to retrieve the bodies
only after 1-2 days and sometimes never

15
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,212
lt was on one of those hot
summer days at the dam...

16
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,945
...when electricity shut-down
and load shedding was frequent...

17
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,213
Hello?

18
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,715
Yes, it's me Rafi
Who are you?

19
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,925
Seven Arts Mohan?
Oh really!

20
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,796
Why stop with 7 Arts Mohan?
(Production manager)

21
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,387
You could've said
director Joshy or Priyadarshan

22
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:30,560
Can't l recognize your voice?
Disconnect and get lost, you junky!

23
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,433
Must be some mischief maker!

24
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,531
He insists on hearing me swear!
Aiyo! Mohan sir!

25
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,670
Mohan sir, greetings sir!
l just thought of you now

26
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,908
Some fellow called me now claiming
he was you and tried to fool me, sir

27
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,180
What? Was it you, sir?

28
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,488
Your new number? Sorry, sir!

29
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:57,287
Yes, tell me sir, l'll be there
right away, l'll come tonight itself!

30
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,664
l hope at least this movie
has a dialog for my role

31
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:07,439
God! Finally a chance to act!
l'll simply excel in this film!

32
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,104
Hey! Beautiful one, come in all your finery
For it's our wedding day tomorrow...

33
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,009
Jacob sir, l'm off to
Ottapalam for a film shoot

34
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,678
- Then who will be on night duty?
- Gopi or Xavier'chetan

35
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,656
Doesn't he have betterthings to do?
Madness! That's what l call it

36
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,787
Suku! l'm off for a shoot

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,631
lmutti'ka
Where's Gopi?

38
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,430
l saw him on his bike
along with those youngsters

39
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,299
Why?

40
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,998
Must be exhibiting
his army stunts somewhere

41
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,541
Oh, he and his blessed army!

42
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:40,094
Hey Kanchi! Oh my dear Kanchi
My love is forever true

43
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,829
Stop, don't go away
breaking my heart

44
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:49,601
Hey Kanchi! Oh my dear Kanchi
My love is forever true

45
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:54,772
Stop, don't go away
breaking my heart

46
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,183
Gopi!

47
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,645
There he goes!

48
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,889
Why is he glaring at me?

49
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,518
Why do you yell out my name
from behind when l'm singing?

50
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,722
lf you'll fall off when l call
you shouldn't have turned to look

51
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,128
People like you should learn
to drive their bike steadily forward

52
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,790
Look, no time for dialogs

53
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,801
l must reach Ottapalam
early morning for a shoot

54
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,837
lt's a fantastic role!
See you, okay?

55
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,838
Hey! Rafi, dude!

56
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,738
Don't call me from behind
lt is inauspicious

57
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,080
He and his blessed film!

58
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,414
This bike isn't starting!?

59
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,782
Hey Rafi! Wait, dude!

60
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,550
- George, l'm off for a shoot
- Go wherever you want!

61
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,753
Rafi! Stop for a second

62
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,156
- There he comes again
- Stop! Stop!

63
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,757
Gopi! l have to go right now
l get a chance once in a blue moon

64
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,131
Who will do the night duty?

65
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,001
Don't l do it every day?
You or Xavier take overtonight

66
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,631
l've always made it clear
l won't work during the night

67
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,905
My dear Xavier'chaya, how can
you distrust your wife like this?

68
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,105
No one will run off
with her in a single night

69
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,979
Moreover, aren't we all here?

70
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
Of course! lsn't that bad enough?

71
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,780
What are you standing there for?
Go inside, woman!

72
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,255
Saviors to support!

73
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,054
What a specimen!
Aiyo! Mohan's call!

74
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,324
- Rafi! Don't go, stop
- Won't you leave me alone?

75
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,992
Look, if l don't reach on time
someone else will get that role

76
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,398
l'm not a great actor
that they'll wait for me

77
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,472
- You've proved that already
- You dare not talk about my acting skills

78
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,733
How can l have an opinion
on something you don't have?

79
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,468
Get lost, you!

80
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,873
- Don't go
- Let me go

81
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,946
l should kick myself
for even talking to you

82
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,539
100s to find fault! lf he's so
smart, why not get me a role?

83
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,675
But no!

84
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,613
Hey! Pack my clothes

85
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:48,560
A brave soldier during the day and
at night cowering and fearing ghosts

86
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,357
Go for night duty instead of
bringing dishonorto the male species!

87
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,761
Fear, eh? That too me?

88
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,230
Hey! Look there!!

89
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,766
See! Didn't l say so?

90
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,513
What is this, Gopi'aetta?
All of us go around at night

91
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,981
Why is it, only you
see these ghosts?

92
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,314
Only l know
what it is to see ghosts

93
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,384
They are ghosts not humans, l can't use
military tactics to destroy them, can l?

94
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,983
They are all a part of yourfears
Didn't that psychiatrist advice you?

95
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,858
Walk around during the night
normally instead of hiding

96
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,522
Only then your problem
will be solved

97
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,462
Anita?

98
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,190
Call for you

99
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,204
- Rafi!
- What?

100
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,936
- My bullet (bike) is wrecked
- So?

101
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,138
- Drop me off before you leave
- Okay, your majesty

102
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:50,488
The journey is so beautiful
and the weather so wonderful

103
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,425
l'm afraid l'll lose myself
here somewhere

104
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,291
Hey! The power is gone again
in spite of the usual shut down

105
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,297
- Stop! Stop!
- What a menace you are!

106
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,432
- l can't sit behind anymore
- Gopi, l must leave forthe shoot

107
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
- Shoot is only tomorrow, right?
- Where are you squeezing in?

108
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,369
Now go
Stop! Stop!

109
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,499
There's a dog jumping

110
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,907
Dog? Where?

111
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,908
- l must have imagined it
- You must be really paranoid

112
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,881
- Who, me?
- Do you call this shyness then?

113
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,281
Let's go

114
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,186
Rafi, do you know
Lal Chowk Marg in Kashmir?

115
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,849
- No
- lt's a focal point of terrorists

116
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,985
On a night like this,
l've attacked and caught 11 terrorists

117
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,588
Rajagopalan sir was there with us
But l was the one who led the attack

118
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,224
After going through all that
do you think l fear darkness?

119
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,132
No use talking to you anymore

120
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,465
Why are you riding faster?

121
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,800
Are you excited
hearing my narration?

122
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,273
No, to drop you off before
you begin your next army story

123
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,141
l'll listen to the rest later
Now get off, we've reached

124
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,476
- Get off, dude!
- Okay

125
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,086
- Come back tomorrow, okay?
- Sure, l'll return right now!

126
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,686
Well, here comes the soldier

127
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,490
Oh, l see! Darkness falls
and you start boozing, eh?

128
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:08,931
Why are you so surprised?
Aren't you a citizen of Kerala, my pal?

129
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,698
You've been assigned the duty
to be 'on alert' of terrorist attacks

130
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,773
Not to drink and lie
unconscious here

131
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,105
All existing terrorists have been
killed when you were in the army

132
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,838
Bin laden the last 1
was killed by the Americans

133
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,937
There are no more
terrorists left, are there?

134
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,180
We've been waiting for you
We want to go in and sleep

135
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,513
Retiring already?

136
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,646
Can't you rest here awhile
before you go in?

137
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,783
Why do you need us?
Powerful ghosts will keep you company

138
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,489
My wife claims, if l don't sleep well
my behavior becomes really ugly

139
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:43,466
Please don't disturb us with
ghosts and goblins, okay? Goodnight

140
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,552
Don't you know smoking is
injurious to health, Thomas'etta?

141
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,957
Can't you stop it
at least after death?

142
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,839
Ow! Stop your attack!

143
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,074
l've rebuked you once
for passing comments on Anita

144
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,206
You should've had the guts
to get even with me then

145
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,444
Not scare me now
after you are dead

146
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,049
Who can this be now?

147
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,790
Who are you?

148
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,274
Who are you?
Can't you hear me?

149
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,206
Aren't you Alice?
John'ettan's daughter?

150
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,249
Stop there!
Don't go further! Alice!

151
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,753
PUMPHOUSE

152
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,620
Stop

153
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,096
The dam, a symbol of pride to us
under the auspices of our Panchayat

154
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,835
celebrated its 20th anniversary

155
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:12,942
The income-expenditure as well as
cash balance, l, lttisir, will now read out

156
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:17,250
To build the stage with cheapest
bamboo, trip to Thodupuzha

157
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,847
did not get bamboo
Expenses, Rs 1000

158
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,386
The same happened at
Kothamangalam, expense Rs 2000

159
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,863
The same at Cheruthoni
expenses were Rs 5000

160
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,958
Tell us, did you finally get
the bamboo, Mr president?

161
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,967
What?

162
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,470
ls it him?

163
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:38,874
When a Panchayat has its own dam
many such expenses have to be borne

164
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,605
What have you got
to do with all this?

165
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,409
Am l not the son, of a simple man
who died, shot down by the police

166
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,313
while leading a protest
on behalf of this dam?

167
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:52,220
Let us, common people also know
how much funds you've swallowed

168
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,891
Let me deal with him 1stcome

169
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,893
Oh, you seem to have bought
herbal medicine for your phobia

170
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,663
What are you out to prove?
That you are not a coward, right?

171
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,570
So you go around
enacting such dramas, isn't it?

172
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,633
No, as a person with
a social responsibility

173
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,509
What was that again?
Social responsibility?

174
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,047
Ah! Secretary sir, you are new here
You won't know, he was once in the army

175
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:31,118
After the Kargil war, dead soldiers
were brought home across the river

176
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,994
Those days when this news
flashed across on TV and papers

177
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,000
and many Panchayats
got their share of fame

178
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,866
We expected this fellow
also to return dead

179
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,408
So that we could get
our moments of glory too

180
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:49,209
But hejust ran away!
A petrified coward!

181
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,876
- l didn't run away from the war, sir
- Then?

182
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,424
l was in hospital with an eye injury,
after a bomb blast

183
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,425
When there were doubts that
my sight was seriously affected

184
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,223
Major Rajagopalan
insisted that l return home

185
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,764
There seems to be nothing
wrong with your eye-sight now!

186
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,766
Bomb blast, my foot!
Have you even seen a bomb?

187
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,699
Sir, what l'm saying is true

188
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,238
l'm a soldier who has got
a medal for bravery

189
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,499
l will tell you
how he got that medal

190
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,705
One day, Rajagopalan sir
ordered them to attack terrorists

191
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:26,444
Everybody got ready, except
this fellow, who said, 'sir, l won't go'

192
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,385
Hearing this Rajagopalan sir
went up to him and said

193
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,922
...since you had the guts to say this
to my face, you are indeed brave

194
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,390
What a brave fellow!

195
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,326
What an ordeal to finish
these morning ablutions

196
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:48,737
Oh Lord! By the time l climb
all the way up, l'll be dead!

197
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,938
-Achaya!
- What, dude?

198
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,606
Newspaper says, tribal people will
get water supply from the Vellimala Dam

199
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,014
Look, the camp officer's photo

200
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:08,021
Camp officer recognized
What's so great about such things?

201
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:13,064
Wasn't she forced to give up
that irrigation project after 5 to 6 years?

202
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,634
Hello?

203
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,164
Have you come out?

204
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,298
Oh, l'll call you back

205
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,173
Achaya, the new
executive engineer is coming

206
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,976
- Get ready quickly
- But it's only 9:00 AM

207
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:36,521
Shibu says he's punctual, strict
so on and so forth, get ready quickly

208
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,787
Oh, what the hell!
People like him make life miserable

209
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:50,663
- Well, there he comes, now stop! Stop!
- What the heck are you up to?

210
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:55,604
lf this vehicle had touched me
l'd have seen this new exexlc

211
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,800
You seem to be totally
drunk early in the morning

212
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,344
The local paper mill closed down
due to power load shedding

213
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,142
Bhasi was one of its employees
who celebrates losing his job like this

214
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,615
Keep quiet dude, let me
tell this new execleexclu

215
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,347
You won't get it right
however much you try

216
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,287
Says who?

217
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,883
After drinking, l find it hard
to say only these words

218
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,985
Enough! Stop pouring

219
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:25,903
This is our own dam, but my mill
alone has no power supply

220
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,565
To find a solution
to this power deficiency

221
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,270
l want to know, what you
as the new engineer intend doing

222
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,508
l'll find a good generator
bury it under the soil and nurture it

223
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,382
When it grows into a tree
and bears fruits of good generators

224
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:47,119
l'll pluck and distribute them to
whoever needs power, is it okay?

225
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,758
Switch off the engine
without wasting diesel

226
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,058
Sir, will you manure it after burying it?

227
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,066
Good morning, sir

228
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,203
People always chase me away

229
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,205
Are you getting ready
for duty only now?

230
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,242
- There wasn't power this morning, so
- Give your excuses in writing

231
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,575
So that, it can be torn away
Be on time from tomorrow

232
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,544
Where is the operator?

233
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,139
Gopi is on duty
He's not yet here

234
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, the soldier has come finally

235
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:31,300
The new executive engineer is here
You'll get a dose now for being late

236
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,169
Come on, go and take it
without further delay

237
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,269
Sir, l am Gopi Krishnan

238
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,848
Not only operator
but ex-military too

239
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,851
Besides daily exercise, l go for drill
on Mondays at the navy camp

240
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:48,977
That's why l'm late

241
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,521
An army man should
always be prepared for battle

242
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,957
Sure, today between 11:00-11 :30 AM
there's news of lndo-Chinese war

243
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,153
will break out

244
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,923
Shouldn't you be there
taking the next available bus?

245
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,465
So you needn't be
on duty here today

246
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,398
Don't waste time, learn to say
in Chinese 'l accept defeat'

247
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,030
and then go fight, okay?!

248
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:16,942
Sir, what you did was perfectly right
Gopi is most arrogant and irresponsible

249
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,011
lf you have to say this about him
he must have some good in him!

250
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,385
Get ready for your duty, dude

251
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,854
l recommended

252
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,459
- Well, it was my words that prompted you
- Let's go!

253
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,223
Gopi'aetta?

254
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,890
Anita'chechi asked for
the water level reading

255
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:54,045
Da! All this flirting is fine, remember
women of the hills are like monitors

256
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:58,213
Don't allow them to cling to your body
Besides, don't ruin our police reputation

257
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,425
Children, watch your steps

258
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,789
Look! Sir is also here

259
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,266
Tribal leaderwhat's happening?
Why are you all here?

260
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,097
We are all fine, all happy

261
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,368
lt was your efforts alone
that brought waterto us farmers

262
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,635
Why have you brought all this?

263
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,611
We've come to tell you something
Didn't want to come empty hand-

264
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,011
Anita'chechi, call for you

265
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,545
Yes, this is camp officer

266
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,686
Oh my girl, hidden behind the veil

267
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,428
l was watching how those people
treat Anita with such love and affection

268
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,526
- Do you really have to pretend to me?
-About what?

269
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,265
- Don't l know what you feel?
- What's there for me to feel?

270
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,467
- Why get angry?
- You are talking nonsense, that's why

271
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:57,242
Nonsense? Remember you once swore
you'd marry only her, after your army days?

272
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,753
That was then, today l don't know
whether l'll end up mad or commit suicide

273
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,346
Why link her with me
and ruin her life also?

274
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,677
People are harassed
without power supply

275
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,681
Electricity generated is deficit
compared to its capacity

276
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,045
Why wasn't anything
done about this?

277
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:37,520
Assistant executive engineer
Narendran sir was in charge here

278
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,783
l reported all this to him

279
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,391
Arrange for an inspection
at the tunnel immediately

280
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,586
Okay, sir

281
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,660
Narendran here

282
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:55,805
Sir, Varghese is stirring up
issues soon after taking charge

283
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,740
l'll call you back

284
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,809
We shifted only yesterday
2nd Saturday, no?

285
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,347
Yes, they are all here
Merin and Priya have left

286
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,283
They are immersed in Facebook

287
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,721
That wasn't for you
lt was for my mummy

288
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:21,026
They'll be back today
lt is tough putting up with them

289
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,963
l'll come only tomorrow

290
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,504
Aiyo! Papa!
l'll call you later

291
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:32,305
Papa is here! Switch off all extra fans
and lights! He'll kill me today

292
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,073
l'm fed up with these girls
Every switch is on

293
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,974
Why didn't you listen?
Papa'll come, we are all dead!

294
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,449
Anita, get up
Oh! Power has gone!

295
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,180
Phew! Saved forthe time being!

296
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,917
You know my papa well, we must
switch off all unnecessary gadgets

297
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,989
Papa has come

298
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,726
lt is so calm and silent here
Looks like you are all bored

299
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,461
Yes, very true, we've been sitting
without electricity for a long time

300
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:01,335
- So we just
- No powerfor a long time, eh?

301
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
But l switched off
the mains only now!

302
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,081
- Shibu, switch it on and you can leave
- Okay, sir

303
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,485
Aiyo! Who has done this?

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,632
Chey! You handle this
l'll be right back

305
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,106
Papa! Sorry, papa

306
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:49,051
What sorry! The reason why
l ask you to save electricity

307
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,523
is not for me to pack it up
and take it along when l die

308
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,856
Electricity shortage is
becoming crucial year after year

309
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:01,729
l just want you and your future
generation to not suffer from power deficit

310
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,997
How can l ask my guests
not to switch on gadgets?

311
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,197
l'll get you something to drink

312
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,274
A cup of tea without
switching on the light in the kitchen

313
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,010
Hey! What are they up to?

314
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,553
Ah! An accidentno?

315
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,885
Greetings!

316
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,517
Ah! That's lttichan sir,
our Panchayat president

317
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,763
l thought you'd come to
see mebut you didn't

318
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,959
l thought let's introduce
ourselves wherever we meet

319
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,298
Must introductions
be forced in mid road?

320
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,632
lthat is

321
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,408
l don't think
you realize who l am

322
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,571
The dam here was not built
because of people's agitation alone

323
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,649
l was also a Panchayat memberthen

324
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,245
That's why today you are
executive engineer here

325
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,555
This dam is like
my own daughter

326
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,120
Will you marry her off
to the Malampuzha dam?!

327
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,861
Today, we must organize
inspection of the tunnel, let's go

328
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,770
Shall l take leave, sir?

329
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,211
Executive engineer? My foot!

330
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,680
Why this sudden inspection?

331
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,751
ls there something
wrong with our dam?

332
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,810
No, we are not getting
the electricity expected out of it

333
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,321
That's why the inspection

334
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,448
Gopi?

335
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,686
- Josukutty, have some tea
- We get better tea at our guest house

336
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,825
Chief Engineer Chacko sir has arrived
at the guest house for the tunnel inspection

337
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,804
After his bout of drinks, he wants to hear
some songs, you mustjoin us tonight

338
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,205
Singing for a drunk audience?

339
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,506
He's here for the sake
of our damplease?

340
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,845
He's notjust a plain drunkard
He's a blessed drunkard

341
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:08,086
Oh my dear uncle moon
What have you filled in your lotus bowl?

342
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,922
What have you...?

343
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:14,658
Are you sitting, on the elephant
looking down from the heavens

344
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,725
Oh my dear uncle moon
What have you filled in your lotus bowl?

345
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:19,895
What have you...?

346
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,701
See how this shoulder moves?

347
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,966
Well done sir, excellent!

348
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:28,136
This is a dance, handed down
from generations in our family

349
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,679
Shoulder dance!

350
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,476
lsn't Chacko sir here?

351
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:37,453
Stop! Someone is coming in
under suspicious circumstances

352
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,854
Of course, we are best of friends!

353
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,085
Hands up!

354
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,160
Are you from vigilance?

355
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,751
- No, from the Panchayat
- Panchayat?

356
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,697
- Hands up, once again
- Sir, my dhoti, you can shoot it

357
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,358
- No! Not there!
- Don't move!

358
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,459
Sir, Chacko sir
He's our Panchayat president

359
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,663
- ls that true?
- Yes, for last 10 years

360
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,070
Why are you here
at this hour?

361
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,439
l heard Chief engineer is here
So l came to renew my acquaintance

362
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:04,447
Remember me sir, l was member
when you were building the dam here

363
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,211
l neither remember, nor do l
have time forjogging my memory

364
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,684
You seem to be tensed?

365
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:14,350
lf it's to do with lncome Tax
l can suggest solutions

366
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,122
You went to Madras to buy this gun
You didn't get but expenses Rs 10000

367
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,857
Went to Bombay, did not get
Expenses were Rs 20000

368
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,660
Narendra!

369
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,767
lttisir, please sit
Sir, please come with me

370
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,569
Come here, sir
Listen to me, if

371
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,872
How do they know we are
watching their cable network?

372
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,275
Are there any cameras hidden here?

373
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,405
My dear sir, that is what
they usually announce

374
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,777
When l'm already mad, she's-

375
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,907
Sir?

376
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,982
- Who is that?
- Chacko sir?

377
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,248
- Hands up!
- Sir, l'm Josekutty

378
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,051
Didn't l promise to bring
someone to sing for you?

379
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,284
He is the one

380
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,563
- Do we have to verify his records?
- No sir, he's harmless

381
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,394
- Do you sing, dude?
- Sir, he sings very well

382
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,524
Do you?

383
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,192
- Then come
- Go

384
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,870
You can start

385
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:16,283
My life a carbon paper
remained a carbon paper only

386
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:23,188
Whatever was written was
washed away along with tears

387
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,164
Stop! Stop!
This will not do

388
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,759
Not a Hindi song
l'm reminded of my wife

389
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,895
Why? ls she from the north?

390
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:38,669
No! But like a Hindi song
l still haven't understood her

391
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,075
Dude! Sing a Malayalam song

392
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,203
Come on, sing!

393
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,988
A dark night overwhelming and profuse
Full blown, mellowed and mysterious

394
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,027
Like a beautiful and voluptuous woman
sculpted and chiseled out of black stone

395
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,531
A young woman whose glances at me
are compellingly sharp in intensity

396
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,127
Her sparkling nose pin, a jewel too
Like the orb of a crescent moon new

397
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:12,642
Clouds of tresses, jasmine in array
blossoms like stars, shine to wane away

398
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,204
A dark night overwhelming and profuse
Full blown, mellowed and mysterious

399
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:22,150
Like a beautiful and voluptuous woman
sculpted and chiseled out of black stone

400
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:26,690
A young woman whose glances at me
are compellingly sharp in intensity

401
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:24,348
Draped in a half sari woven fragile
with precious stones of blue sapphire

402
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,545
Beads of clear crystals glow
strung one by one in a row

403
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:33,454
As new moon lined her eyes with kohl
Full moon adorned with gold jewel

404
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,756
ln search of the elusive door of love
that led to her nuptial alcove

405
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,422
A girl pure
Shy and demure

406
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:21,529
Like an adopted daughter facing me
with palms hiding her eyes in mystery

407
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,803
Caressing in profusion,
a body of magical illusion

408
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,677
Tunes you sing, the night birds hum
Your anklets tinkle, a symphony to strum

409
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,946
This beautiful girl, as hours tick
Fades away, before our very eyes quick

410
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,613
This girl so shy,
the night sky!

411
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:50,959
A dark night overwhelming and profuse
Full blown, mellowed and mysterious

412
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:55,938
Like a beautiful and voluptuous woman
sculpted and chiseled out of black stone

413
00:32:56,074 --> 00:33:00,636
A young woman whose glances at me
are compellingly sharp in intensity

414
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,126
Ha! Greetings to you

415
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,633
Bro, isn't this the office
of the Executive Engineer?

416
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,637
- Yes
- Thank you

417
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,394
Now don't l look
a typical contractor?

418
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,326
Sure you do

419
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,831
On the phone he sounded tough
Be careful while dealing with him

420
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,994
What are you saying, man?
Just watch my performance

421
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:05,274
Brother? This ex
Brother?

422
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,671
- Koshy?
- Eh?

423
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,746
Looka mountain swan!

424
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,951
Where can l meet
executive engineer Varghese sir?

425
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,624
That man in the corner
wearing glasses

426
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,827
You mean that black shorty?

427
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,997
Dude! Obviously
a hard core crook

428
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,694
Do you work here?

429
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,827
- No
- Thank goodness!

430
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:38,432
Such fellows have better names
A cunning crocodile, kumki, demon

431
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,170
Let me go meet him

432
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,986
Sir, l am Padathil Contractors owner
Oomen Koshy's son, Koshy Oomen

433
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,026
l called you yesterday

434
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,932
- Ah! Please sit
- Dad died 4 months back

435
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:09,063
l know the right method
to get this bill passed!

436
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,197
That's why l was
late getting in touch

437
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,799
lt was your ignorance
for which you are forgiven

438
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,140
Have you brought the Rs 3 lakh
you offered over the phone?

439
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,213
Sure

440
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,014
Let me not waste time
l'll call the police

441
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,814
l've made separate
arrangements forthe police

442
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,480
That won't be necessary
Before that, they'll arrest you

443
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,887
Why?

444
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,824
For bribing me
to get your work done

445
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,355
What did you think of me?

446
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:38,424
Pretending to clear slush
your dad smuggled out sand

447
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,299
That's why l stopped
your bill from being passed

448
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,032
Don't talk nonsense about
my dad who is no more!

449
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:48,035
l have accounts of the loads
gone from here while under contract

450
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,137
He has smuggled out
sand worth millions

451
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,183
Sir, my dad never resorted
to such underhand activities

452
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,583
He rotated cash from many people
to get this tender worth 5 crores

453
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,177
l can return that,
only if this bill is passed-

454
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,985
Corrupt people can
dole out many explanations

455
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,459
Sand lost from the dam
is a danger to its safety

456
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,360
lt is something that will
affect 1000s of people

457
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:14,528
l'll not only refuse to pass the bill
but also file a case and order an enquiry

458
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:24,209
Why don't you give up this house
instead of retaining it empty like this?

459
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,551
My parents once lived there
Let it remain as it is

460
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,144
Why don't you
start living there?

461
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,018
Do you want to be
a bachelorforever?

462
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,872
Who are you?
Where did you die?

463
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,036
Die? lf l hadn't moved,
l'd be dead now

464
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,010
Who are you?

465
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:03,485
l am Padathil contractor
Oomen Koshy's son Koshy Oomen

466
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,916
Are you the son of contractor
Oomen sir who worked at the dam?

467
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,718
Yes

468
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,386
l attended his funeral
Why here at this time of the night?

469
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:16,398
Dad has told us many times
how you'd saved him from an abyss

470
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,127
l am in a similar abyss now

471
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,000
-Abyss?
- Yes, an abyss of problems

472
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,801
You've got to save me
from this somehow

473
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:28,538
Oomen sir was a regular
contractor here, an honest soul

474
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:32,480
Lorries belonging to Parimalam
were used during the contract

475
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,450
lt must have been Parimalam
who smuggled out sand

476
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,147
He also dealt
with stolen sand

477
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,257
Sir, didn't l tell you
my dad was innocent?

478
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,590
You can't make statements
without fool proof evidence

479
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,424
Parimalam's house is in Theni

480
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,555
When we called, we were
told he is in Malaysia

481
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:54,502
The minute he returns, l'll pick him up,
bring him here and make him confess

482
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,166
That'sjust wishful thinking
All that will never happen, l th-

483
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,766
lt will happen

484
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:04,175
l am a soldier, l'll get him
After that you can believe me

485
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,249
What do you say, sir?

486
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,477
l only want
the guilty to be punished

487
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,646
lf Oomen Koshy
is innocent, l'll pass the bill

488
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,089
Sir, l'm lucky my case is
with an honest officer like you-

489
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:20,755
My dear, was your mobile
switched off? Suma called

490
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,629
The range is very poor inside
the library, maybe that's why

491
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,598
Why are you switching on
the light in broad daylight?

492
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,105
What?
Light?

493
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:35,078
lf there was
a sudden power cut

494
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:40,116
Weren't you the one
who called my papa, a black shorty?

495
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,283
Me? Of course not

496
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,654
How can a fair
tall man like you

497
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:57,126
ln that situationl didn't know
she was your daughter

498
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,964
lf she wasn't my daughter
would you have called me that?

499
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,206
Look at his white shirt,
dhoti and cooling glass!

500
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,867
Your looks show
what a crook you are

501
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,604
Sir, l'm an innocent fellow

502
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:12,672
Check out Fb comments about me
You'll realize my innocence

503
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,513
-Are you on Face book?
- Sowhat if l am?

504
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,750
Crocodile, demon, elephant trainer
Didn't you call my papa by these names?

505
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,186
All that was before l knew

506
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,922
Sir, you can call me
all these names in revenge!

507
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,228
Why must l get my revenge
calling you names that suit you so well?

508
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,235
Let me see
what Parimalam has to say

509
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,172
We'll decide, if l'm crocodile
or demon after that

510
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,107
lf the bill is not passed
the creditors will hound me

511
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,146
My sister's wedding is nearing

512
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,408
- l can't bear to think-
- Don't think at all

513
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,781
The minute Parimalam
returns, l will abduct him

514
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,583
Like Anita'chechi says, Parimalam
has 100s of tipper lorries, how can we

515
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,591
abduct someone like him
and that too from Tamil Nadu?

516
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,789
ls this a biggertask than
catching terrorists in Kashmir?

517
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,196
These tipper lorries are worse than
terrorists when it comes to killing people

518
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,824
Are you making fun of me?

519
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,697
Not like that

520
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,034
Let Parimalam come
We'll do what's necessary

521
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,071
Now go

522
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,244
Anita, you may be
a good social worker

523
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,323
But your way of insulting me
in front of others!

524
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:31,384
My dear Gopi'aetta, it was just
an involuntary reaction, forget it

525
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,522
How can l? At least 1 person
should realize l have guts

526
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:41,902
Agreedyou have guts, l'll even
sign a stamp paper and register it

527
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:42,904
Are you also ridiculing me?

528
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,807
Sure, if that'll remove your complex

529
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,369
- What complex?
- That you are a coward

530
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,473
lsn't that why you narrate
such stories of bravado

531
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,553
Hello, Ram'aetta, what happened?
Wasn't it serviced just 2 days ago?

532
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,348
Finish the work quickly

533
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,493
How could you
think that of me!

534
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,396
What the hell
are you up to?!

535
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,702
l saw

536
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,297
- lt wasn't deliberate
- Then?

537
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,071
Bhairavan has been after me
l was just avoiding him-

538
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,636
Which Bhairavan?
l can't see anyone

539
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,381
Watch that!

540
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,975
Didn't l explain?
Why don't you believe me?

541
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,848
There are millions
of people in this world

542
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,253
Why is it only you
can see ghosts?

543
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,053
Today l realize
what is in your mind, chey!

544
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,771
Haven't you done enough?
Ruining my life like this!

545
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,210
What Anita says is true

546
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,183
Among the millions
in this world, why pick on me?

547
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,549
What have l done
to deserve this fate?

548
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,259
For heaven's sake?!
What the dunce is this?

549
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:25,464
Oh! lt's Alice! Why did she write
she won't trouble anyone?

550
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,696
Jacob sir?
Vinu sir?

551
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,029
Whatwhy at this time
of the night?

552
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,230
-Alice's ghost is out for my blood
- Ghost?

553
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,237
Let me sit here

554
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,004
- Why did you come here?
- Don't be so hard hearted, sir

555
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:04,376
Shouldn't we be united
against these ghosts?

556
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,181
Sir, be brave
l'm here with you

557
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,017
Alice!

558
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,550
Jacob sir?

559
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,817
l thought it was Chandran who died
of heart attack on his nuptial night

560
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,016
Sit down, sir

561
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,592
Why are you here?

562
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,355
l was just

563
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,129
Why is he here?

564
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,393
lf Gopi'atten ever comes
to know, l will-

565
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,264
Don't worry
No one will know

566
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,099
My father will soon
start looking for me

567
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,374
You said you'd send her and she's still here
Don't make me swear at you!

568
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,604
- Now what the hell can we do?
- lt was a mistake

569
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,045
Achaya, just a minute

570
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:48,189
Look, perfectly distilled alcohol
Just 1 swig, all your fears will go

571
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,190
While on duty?

572
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,888
Distilled using battery,
can do your duty fully charged!

573
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,625
l refused my military quota
to avoid this habit

574
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,165
Foolishness

575
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,030
But when you witness life
what's the use of not drinking?

576
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,434
- Here, take this
- What about water?

577
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,938
ln distilled alcohol?
Just swallow it

578
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,746
- Oh! My chest is burning
- Don't worry, it's original

579
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:13,476
Now, just try this pickle
Let that burn into you

580
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,950
How does it feel now?
Are you feeling braver?

581
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,715
l'm worried
l'll get addicted

582
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:23,452
Not at all! l've been doing
this for the last 25 years

583
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,755
l still have not got into a habit

584
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,463
Here, drink this also

585
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:36,237
Oh! You poured a little more, isn't it?
lt was as if a burning torch went in

586
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,433
Didn't l tell you
it is real good stuff?!

587
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,566
Nowpickle

588
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,304
- Why?
- For the next drink

589
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,307
Don't worry, he's totally
drunkcome

590
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,215
Go, don't worry
l'll call you

591
00:44:54,491 --> 00:45:00,361
- Now drink 1 more
- No, l feel funny now

592
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,490
- l feel both of you are very good
- Yes, that's why

593
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,126
lsn't there a limit
to being senseless?

594
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,063
There's a lady out there

595
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,003
- There she goes!
- Where?

596
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,312
Will it be a mess?

597
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,642
- Look there she goes
- Where?

598
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,985
- We don't see anything
- Look at where my hand points

599
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:23,951
That's a lamp post

600
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,352
Look below the post,
in a white sari

601
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:30,791
That must be a ghost or witch
How can we see her?

602
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,199
You are definitely wicked fellows

603
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,838
Look at the 2 of you immovable
even in front of ghosts?

604
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,307
l really appreciate your courage

605
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,237
Oh! There's a pit

606
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:53,573
Pit?

607
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,447
Your eyes are also
drunk with alcohol

608
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,417
lt's not the alcohol
Happens very often

609
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,220
So good night
Sleep well without worrying

610
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:06,159
No terrorist will step in here

611
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,160
They know you are fit
(drunk) police officers!

612
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,533
Thank God!
Escaped!

613
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:09,690
As l come wafting, in a whiff and swirl
A lovely cloud over the slopes of silver-hill

614
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:18,724
With smoldering embers in my heart's hearth
Like streaks of lightning that smite the earth

615
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:27,801
As l flow on, as a dream with the breeze
Like melancholic notes of sad melodies

616
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:42,759
Oh black night, l tread
where your darkness led

617
00:47:46,196 --> 00:48:00,941
Oh inky night, l tread
where your darkness led

618
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:33,104
As my soul ran in search of bell,
from anklets, that shattered and fell

619
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:40,180
My breath craved to adorn its psyche
With rhythms of my love's soul, my key

620
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,714
As my soul ran in search of bell
From anklets, that shattered and fell

621
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:50,316
My breath craved to adorn its psyche
With rhythms of my love's soul, my life's key

622
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,887
Blossoms of Paala, intoxicating delight
Swaying to the breeze in lanes of the night

623
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:59,935
Awaiting with an enchanting, dazzling smile
Yearning for my love to be mine, worthwhile

624
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:23,482
Oh raven night, l tread
where your darkness led

625
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:41,667
Oh black night, l tread
within your darkness dead

626
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,092
Ah! Where is Alice?

627
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,830
Alice has gone to Saudi Arabia
to join the nunnery

628
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:16,478
Drunk and senseless
lying here, dreaming of women, eh?

629
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,605
Rain water is surging
down from the mountain top

630
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,205
Who will open the shutter?

631
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,410
Don't ever let me
see you here again

632
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,004
Yes, Koshy?

633
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,506
Brother, has Paraimalam come?

634
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,008
He will, l'll call him now

635
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,179
l've come here to meet
the executive engineer

636
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,475
No, not forthat
l'll call you back

637
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,285
Why are you here?

638
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,763
We don't sell booze here

639
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:12,858
Outside the gate2 Kms away
you'll get itgogo!

640
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:20,470
- Sir, please listen to me
- Not a word! Soldiermy foot!

641
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,673
You are a hypocrite
You won't get yourjob back

642
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,740
- l didn't come for that
- No more explanations needed

643
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,649
The news headlines

644
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,889
The power cut in the state
has been withdrawn completely

645
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:45,798
The decision was taken this morning
when the cabinet of ministers met today

646
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,268
Widespread protests
against increase in diesel prices

647
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,398
Tomorrow the Left parties have
called for a state wide agitation

648
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,376
lf the increase in prices are not...

649
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,544
l heard you were
leaving for Delhi tomorrow

650
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,014
That's why l'm here now

651
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,679
Did l not ask you

652
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,549
l've not come back for my job

653
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,985
Let it go

654
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,388
But an engineer like you
should know the truth

655
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,223
Please listen to
what l need to say

656
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,629
They just announced
power cut was withdrawn

657
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:19,225
Maybe another drunkard like you
doing his duty and unaware of-

658
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,632
Oh, so it's an attack
in darkness, eh?

659
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,990
Sir, he's not alone
There's a body guard here

660
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,570
Who are these fellows?

661
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,675
Call the police, sir
What nonsense is this?

662
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:35,108
Not necessary
Go switch on the mains

663
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,110
Where is your daughter?

664
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,748
Gone for a college study tour

665
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,952
So you are really a soldier, eh?

666
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,537
Take him away

667
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:18,086
lt was my greatest desire
to join the army and serve the nation

668
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,985
So l ran away from here

669
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:25,825
This is the 1st time, in this town
someone is recognizing me as a real soldier

670
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:35,334
l am not a drunkard, sir
lt was those ghosts who got me drunk

671
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,896
Ghosts? Have they started
selling brandy to kill people?

672
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:44,036
No sir, l don't know
what my affliction is

673
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:54,716
l see Alice, Thomas chetan and
many other dead people, persistently

674
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:59,022
Thomas'chetan, you mean Thomas Kurian
who was killed during this dam's construction?

675
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,153
Yes, sir

676
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:04,834
l used to buy Panama cigarettes
for him regularly, when l worked here

677
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:08,131
What do l do, when he comes
in front of me smoking the same Panama?

678
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,603
How long have you
been seeing this illusion?

679
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,573
A long time, l did meet
a psychiatrist, but no use

680
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,886
You can rejoin your old job

681
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:30,693
Go meet Dr Shivaprasad
at Lotus hospital, tomorrow

682
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,756
l'll call him and
fix an appointment

683
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,794
Okay, sir

684
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,200
Was that you?

685
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,910
Where were you? You aren't
reachable on your mobile

686
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,813
lt's switched off
fearing creditors' calls

687
00:55:55,385 --> 00:56:01,585
Since everybody knows the situation
my friends have stopped calling me

688
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:09,322
Since l have no hope on earth now
l thought let me fly in the sky

689
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,100
- Are you high on drugs?
- No

690
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,697
My would-be-brother-in-law's dad

691
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:18,501
Avaran, the business tycoon
came home today

692
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,940
l came hearing that
the bill will not be passed

693
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,673
And that an enquiry
has begun against your father

694
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:29,548
l am not prepared to allow my son
to be burdened with your liabilities

695
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,849
We'll forget this wedding

696
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:40,960
l walked out of my house, saying
l will find a solution to the bill issue

697
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,395
ls consuming dope
your solution?

698
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,161
Well, that's what gave
me this brilliant brainwave

699
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,101
l came to discuss this
with you, my brother

700
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,637
Not now, come sleep

701
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:56,804
Hey! l'm seriously talking
and youwhat was l saying?

702
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,543
Mom's brother in
Bangalore, lsaac uncle

703
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,784
He and l always
are at loggerheads

704
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:10,690
He could have easily
saved mom from this debt

705
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,628
l thought l'd send a mail
to uncle but couldn't

706
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:19,566
So l have written on this paper
all that's in my mind

707
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,072
Love letterto uncle
Brother, read it

708
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:28,275
Bro, open my heart
and see what's in it

709
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,881
Dear uncle
This is my suicide note

710
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:49,759
Koshy! Where are you going?
Don't take a hasty decision, Koshy!

711
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,225
Stop there
We'll find a solution

712
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,669
Don'tjump, Koshy!

713
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,260
Look on the other side, a little away

714
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,741
How the hell
can they find him?

715
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,082
Why did he do this?

716
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,156
lsn't his life more important?

717
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,500
The chief engineer is here

718
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:07,565
This blighted hill and
a carthat's rotten!

719
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,441
- Did they find that boy's body?
- No, sir

720
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:14,677
- Where are those geologists from Pune?
- Waiting inside for you, sir

721
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,511
Good morning, sir

722
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,352
Chief Engineer

723
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,521
Narayanan, l am a Malayali

724
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:32,033
Madhu Chopra
Vijay Singh

725
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,032
Please sit

726
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,195
Executive engineer
Varghese sent us a note

727
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,331
requesting a geological
study be conducted here

728
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:45,244
l too got a copy of it
ls it actually necessary now?

729
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,317
The executive engineer
has told us a few points

730
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,784
lt needs some urgent attention

731
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,915
Dude, do whatever it is they want

732
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,650
Thank you, sir

733
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,826
Darn this lousy rain!

734
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:05,394
Don't look forthat body any more
Must be trapped amongst rocks

735
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,969
Even afterthe rain stops, the body
will still be down only

736
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,831
No need for any
celebrations today

737
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,440
Let's have 5-6 rounds
and sleep soundly

738
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,497
Varghese sir is in danger
He has to be...

739
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:53,562
What are you saying?
Varghese sir is in Delhi, isn't he?

740
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:57,002
A ghost came and wrote, it seems!!
Have you become so muddled?

741
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:02,100
l do see ghosts, it is true
But Koshy was not a ghost

742
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,838
Who else could have
written that there?

743
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:08,610
Gopi, go to Errady mutt and
get a sanctified thread tied

744
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,386
We've all lost sleep
Try and get some sleep

745
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,388
Sending us all in a tizzy!

746
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,457
Come, woman!

747
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:37,204
Don't take Anita's words seriously
We are a 100% literate state

748
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,771
Even ghosts read and write
Nothing surprising!

749
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,502
Hello? Who is it?
Siddique, eh?

750
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,340
Director Siddique sir has no time for
Hindi films, imagine Malayalam?!

751
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:14,473
lnstead of trying to fool me, try reading
some movie magazines before calling

752
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:20,150
What nuisance, answering such calls!
Can't make out real from make-believe

753
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:24,756
Hey! Lal Jose is starting
a new film, l'll call him

754
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,662
Rafi! Those geologists have
found serious flaws in the dam

755
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,364
What flaws?

756
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,497
No idea, but they have
gone to the quarters

757
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,166
- Come with me
- Sure, let's go quickly

758
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:50,847
lt's clear, from the studies
we've conducted here so far

759
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,986
that there could be a land slide
on these hills, at any moment

760
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,552
l don't get it
Shouldn't your conclusions be

761
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,060
based on the lab reports,
which we've not yet got?

762
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:04,462
That is just a formality, sir
There is serious seepage within the hill

763
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:09,936
Age has eroded the rocky terrain
A land slide will occur, l'm very sure!

764
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,540
Oh my God, Jesus!
ls this true?

765
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:17,544
Let's begin collecting money towards
Relief funds of land-slide victims

766
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,510
We do need money in cash, don't we?

767
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,674
Tell us more
my geologist brother

768
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:28,552
A land slide here will be disastrous
and there's only 1 way to avoid it

769
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:32,194
Stop the functioning of
the dam and power-house

770
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,291
Abandon Vellimala Dam!

771
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,931
This is our decision

772
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,299
You can't take
decisions on your own

773
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:44,999
This dam has an officer in charge
Varghese sir, let him return

774
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,167
We did this study based on
Mr Varghese's suggestion

775
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,710
We've already called him in Delhi
and informed him our decision

776
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:52,803
What did he say?

777
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:57,079
ln the face of such impending disaster
what can he do but agree?!

778
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,885
What disaster
are you talking about?

779
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:04,753
Doesn't the tunnel from the dam to
the power house go through this hill?

780
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,790
Water is rushing with
great force through the tunnel

781
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,365
lf there is a land slide
the tunnel will be destroyed

782
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,232
lf the valve is not shut on time

783
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,666
not a single human will survive

784
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,671
And this entire area will
sink for many kilometers

785
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,240
We know the draw backs
if the dam is shut down

786
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,274
But aren't human lives
more valuable than electricity?

787
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,445
You and your Govt
must admit this

788
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:40,324
You must abandon this dam and
it should be with immediate effect

789
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,872
You must go back
to the police camp, isn't it?

790
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,212
Vellimala dam will only be a memory

791
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,317
You are not only Home Minister, but our
Member of the Legislative Assembly too

792
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,253
Sir, if you directly-

793
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,524
This dam was completed
when l was the Minister for Electricity

794
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,998
What can the Govt do when
it becomes a threat to 1000s of lives?

795
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:33,301
Sir, can't we verify
if a land slide will actually occur?

796
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,802
Won't your Ministry be able to?

797
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,211
Do you think l'll forsake Vellimala?
l am there, with all of you

798
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:44,080
Look, why don't you
organize a public protest?

799
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,216
People's emotions
have to be provoked

800
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,283
l'll do the needful after that

801
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,286
Brother!

802
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,439
Gopi! What are you doing?

803
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,443
lnothing

804
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:18,382
See you at the Agitation
committee meeting tomorrow

805
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,662
Brother!

806
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:11,572
Brother, it's me
Brother?

807
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,908
lt's me, Koshy
Brother, l'm not dead

808
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,170
Brother!

809
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,308
Look at me

810
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,517
How did you escape?

811
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,271
As l sank deep into the water
and started suffocating

812
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:48,134
since l knew to swim
l just swam out automatically

813
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:57,183
ln those moments of near death
desperate and directionless

814
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,048
l found myself in a forest

815
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:03,886
When the effects of dope wore off
l didn't have the guts to kill myself

816
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,797
On my way back, in the forest

817
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:23,843
Ah! Mari, on your way
take right turn at the bridge

818
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:27,382
Parimalam sir
will be waiting there

819
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:54,938
- l have to meet Parimalam sir
- He's in there

820
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,204
- ln here?
- Yes

821
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:01,949
- You may leave
- Yes sir

822
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,296
Sir, accounts of loads of sand

823
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,776
Chey! We aren't getting
the actual share of the kickback

824
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,818
from the loads of sand
Parimalam is smuggling out

825
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:43,049
Don't worry, sir
l'm rejoicing Koshy's death

826
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,352
We'll see the accounts later

827
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,792
Sir, he is conscious now

828
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,324
Oh, l wish he becomes
enlightened, come

829
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,651
ln spite of the blows
you refuse to learn, hmm?

830
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,489
Try to realize at least now
what l'm trying to say

831
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,731
Whether you agree or not
geologists will be brought

832
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:29,634
from Pune and we'll see
that this dam is destroyed

833
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,474
Then why the heck are you
putting up with this torture?

834
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,171
Whatever you do
even if you kill me

835
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:46,215
l'll not abet you to destroy a dam
that gives water and power to people

836
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,692
You bloody son of a gun!
Did your father get this dam as dowry?

837
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:53,595
A tile just fell down

838
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,130
Shukur, Parimalam, Johnny
Someone is on the roof

839
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:59,564
Go, catch him red handed

840
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,069
He is Koshy

841
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,704
Koshyisn't he dead?

842
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,214
Go and catch him

843
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:23,315
The whole of next day
l had to spend in hiding

844
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,155
When l came to
meet you that night

845
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,353
Brother!

846
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:44,244
Varghese sir is in danger

847
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,613
Hiding and lying low, l tried
for many days to meet you alone

848
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,086
Brother, please
help me go back home

849
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,586
They will keep
a close watch on your house

850
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,427
lt's a risk to even
make a call to your place

851
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,566
This was where Varghese sir

852
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,652
This belongs to Varghese sir

853
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,287
All those stories about
landslides were pure lies

854
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:38,292
Only if we rescue Varghese sir
we'll know the inside story of this plot

855
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,632
And only then
we can save the dam

856
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:05,656
-Are you sure no one saw you?
- Of course not

857
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,694
Jenny?
What's this?

858
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,503
Mom used to tell dad before she died
that while he fought the world

859
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:18,502
he must remember
he has a daughter

860
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,372
Papa always replied
'she's MY daughter'

861
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:27,473
lf papa is also gone
who is there for me?

862
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,710
lf that was their intention
he'd be dead by now

863
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:34,047
lf he doesn't co operate
they'll use you to threaten him

864
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,349
l brought you here
to avoid that

865
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:39,951
Don't switch on your phone
or computer, they may trace you

866
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:46,432
l assure you l'll find him
After all, l am a soldier

867
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:47,524
Just a minute

868
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,532
Don't worry

869
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,711
Come here
What is it?

870
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,378
What the heck
are you saying, bro?

871
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:01,548
lf you pursue Varghese sir,
you are buying trouble

872
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:05,184
We must try to escape from this
Otherwise life will be a mess

873
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:09,250
Dude, when someone is in
trouble and a dam in peril!

874
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:12,059
Don't you have any
sense of social responsibility?

875
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,455
Social commitment?
Of course l do

876
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:15,894
For the Mulla Periyar Dam issue

877
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:19,593
all of us friends on Face book,
lit candles on Marine Drive

878
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:23,262
But we mustn't take decisions
that will harm us physically, it's risky

879
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,598
You and your friends
are wonderful indeed!

880
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,574
Then why am l protecting
you in spite of its dangers?

881
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,905
- That's because
- Jenny

882
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35,279
We were discussing ways
of saving your father

883
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:36,875
lsn't it, brother?

884
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,218
What were you planning?

885
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:43,688
A Chacko or a Narendan
can't make us abandon a dam

886
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,221
Such things will not happen

887
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,089
There are many others behind this

888
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,289
lf we discover who they are
we can rescue Varghese sir

889
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,627
l will do all that

890
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:54,895
Please don't be impulsive
and mess up things

891
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:58,500
l want papa back alive

892
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,479
The Chief lnspector has come
a couple of times to meet papa

893
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,376
May be he will help us

894
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,986
Oh! Police are not
stronger than the army

895
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,781
We'll think about itawww!

896
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,362
Ghostthat's why
l was unnerved

897
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,602
We'll meet the Cl, right?

898
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,477
- ls the Chief lnspector in?
- He has a guest, wait outside

899
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,086
Dear citizens of Vellimala

900
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,987
Pleading not to abandon the dam
and as a sign of protest...

901
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:55,286
...by the people of Vellimala,
the inauguration of a hunger strike

902
01:18:55,430 --> 01:19:01,335
lt'll be held today at 4:00 P.M
at Patriot pavilion

903
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:05,667
Our honorable Panchayat president
ltti sir will grace this function

904
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:11,173
All of you must join hands to make it
a symbol of people's progress

905
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,678
lt is a request and an entreaty

906
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,552
Anwar, come
Let's go in my vehicle

907
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:29,690
What do those geologists
in Pune know about our hill?

908
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:35,665
To bring them here in a hurry
and stir up an issue like this is...

909
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:42,538
...is a strong conspiracy headed by
executive engineer Varghese sir

910
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:49,375
When such serious issues are happening
why must executive engineer be in Delhi?

911
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:56,224
As the president of this Panchayat
for the last 10 years, l can only say...

912
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,456
The decision to abandon this dam

913
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,924
Are you unwell?

914
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:10,468
l want to be in the forefront of this
But my body refuses to co operate

915
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:14,071
Who is it, who's trying
to eliminate our dam?

916
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,740
Your father Krishnan
gave up his life forthis

917
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,310
We have carried plenty
of stones and mud to build it

918
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,453
What we see around
is our livelihood

919
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:27,854
This dam belongs
to the people of Vellimala

920
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,386
Don't let them abandon it

921
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,088
On a mountain strange,
a single range...

922
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,389
On those mountain slopes free
was planted seedling of a Devil tree

923
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,963
The Pala grew covered
leaves, fruits flowered

924
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,297
Oh girl, it is constant,
isn't it the only fact?

925
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,977
On a mountain strange,
a single range...

926
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,945
On those mountain slopes free
was planted seedling of a Devil tree

927
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,983
The Pala grew covered
leaves, fruits flowered

928
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,313
Oh girl, it is constant,
isn't it the only fact?

929
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:18,638
Okay, let me leave now

930
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,470
lf you don't finish up all this
l must do it myself

931
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:24,443
Dude, an opened bottle and
a marriageable daughter are alike

932
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,342
- Why?
- Both are very stressful

933
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,979
Have one more peg, dude

934
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:34,712
Cheers! Knock it, dude
Leave the unopened bottle here

935
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:37,620
- Okay see you, sir
- Okay, good night

936
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,462
Hey! Don't kill me
What is it, dude?

937
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,123
This gun has to be
kept safely away

938
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,666
Give it to me
Scaring people like this!

939
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,030
l thought you were
from the vigilance

940
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:49,698
Okay, now go!

941
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:57,634
Aiyo! Alice!

942
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:02,179
Aiyo! Go away!

943
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:03,948
Who's it?
What's happening?

944
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:04,676
Alice!

945
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:08,119
-Alice?
- Where is Alice?

946
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,554
-Alice, her ghost
- Ghost?

947
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:10,090
There behind you

948
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:12,989
Aiyo! Shukur, Johnny
Find out what it is

949
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,025
Where?

950
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,288
- Gone
- Gone where?

951
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,724
l keep seeing them
every now and then

952
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,828
Now l can't go home alone

953
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:27,201
- Where did you pick up this retard?
- Let him sleep here tonight, sir

954
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,782
Hello?

955
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,818
Who the heck is calling, without
allowing me to sleep in peace?

956
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,149
Hello?

957
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,387
To abduct the executive engineer
and keep him hidden

958
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:59,661
how many pegs did you need
to forget that stress and sleep?

959
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:00,664
Who are you?

960
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,629
l am from a TV news channel

961
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,807
News Channel?
But my TV is switched off

962
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,343
This is from the channel office

963
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:17,182
How much did you pay
the geologists for their landslide theory?

964
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,511
Tell me truth, who are you?

965
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:25,582
l know all details of the drama
you are scripting to destroy Vellimala Dam

966
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,625
Da! Who the hell are you?

967
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:33,495
We'll serve it to the public
garnished with spice, soon

968
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:34,291
Da!

969
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,301
This is the age of
hidden cameras

970
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:40,538
All that you blurted this evening
in a stupor is solid evidence

971
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:42,007
Don't say l didn't warn you

972
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:44,035
Who are you?

973
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,975
Aiyo! Shukur, Johnny

974
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,227
There are hidden cameras in my room
Find and smash every 1 of them

975
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:07,993
lsn't there a camera in it?

976
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,698
- Sir, may be in here
- Break it

977
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,137
Nothing in this either

978
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:19,338
- Stop gaping and break that TV
- Please! What are you doing?

979
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,608
These hidden cameras
are difficult to locate

980
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:22,909
This is the only way
Smash it to bits

981
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:26,350
This is a Sony TV
Johnny's club will break it now

982
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,684
Chacko sir, l'll have
to answer for all this

983
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:31,618
- No camera here
- What else is remaining?

984
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,054
May be it's inside
the Air conditioner

985
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:37,790
Oh my God!

986
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,231
Playing with me, eh?

987
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,028
All cameras will be
in smithereens now

988
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,339
lf you got a call
it must be in your call list, sir?

989
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:54,904
Mobile company claims
you didn't get such a call

990
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:56,243
Booze must have
touched your head

991
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:57,941
Did you dream that call?

992
01:25:58,052 --> 01:26:00,782
lt's only the Bishop
who touches heads, not booze!

993
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:02,384
Call and explain to
that Superintendent of police

994
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,287
- l called him
- Call again, let me talk

995
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:10,795
- Hello?
- Joshi? Where are you?

996
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,528
l'm very sure about that call
lt was a trick to know our secrets

997
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,192
Who could he be?

998
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:21,401
lt's surely not from the channels
They don't ask permission to kill

999
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,806
Has camp officer Anita
revealed it to someone?

1000
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:29,747
Not Anita, she'll never do it
l am very sure about that

1001
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:33,977
- Who else can it be?
- l am really tensed

1002
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,317
Can you come here, please?

1003
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:57,635
When l saw you at the meeting
l couldn't talk to you properly

1004
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:02,976
l didn't know then, that your
participation in the protest meet

1005
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:06,913
was after secretly supporting
the fellows who wanted to demolish it

1006
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,116
Whylost for an answer, eh?

1007
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,193
l want to know why
you are aiding and abetting this

1008
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,223
l've found out everything

1009
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,198
l'm leaving only after
l get all info from you

1010
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:31,679
Sorry

1011
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,352
Gopi'etta

1012
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,282
Come inside

1013
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:50,891
Father got this gift from Chacko & co,
to make sure that l help them

1014
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,861
What else do you want to know?

1015
01:27:57,672 --> 01:27:58,696
What actually happened?

1016
01:27:58,973 --> 01:27:59,905
My dear!

1017
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,108
Let him know, father
Why must he also misjudge?

1018
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:07,240
Remember the inspection
we conducted in the tunnel

1019
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:10,509
suspecting enough current
was not being generated?

1020
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,711
l don't think
you realize who l am

1021
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:15,879
Today we are inspecting
the tunnel, let's go

1022
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,387
We went inside
the tunnel for inspection

1023
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:29,630
We found a big fissure
during that inspection

1024
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,874
-Anita, shoot that
- Okay, sir

1025
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,739
Weren't you in charge
of dam construction those days?

1026
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:43,180
You didn't bother to use
steel pipes before concreting, right?

1027
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:45,912
l am the Chief Engineer
How dare you question me?

1028
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,915
l know what to do

1029
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,957
Enough of this,
switch it off, my girl

1030
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,651
Video filemy foot!

1031
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:55,959
But Varghese sir didn't give in

1032
01:28:56,631 --> 01:29:01,000
Due to the crack in the tunnel
water can't be sent with greater force

1033
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,093
That's why the power
generated is lessening

1034
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:04,902
The fissure will continue to widen

1035
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:09,373
With lesser and lesser force in water
power generation will gradually become nil

1036
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,775
That can't be allowed, right?
So l intend reporting this

1037
01:29:13,147 --> 01:29:16,810
And we'll move forward with
plans to rebuild the tunnel

1038
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:20,283
Piley Pilla, the contractor
who built this dam is dead

1039
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:24,885
lf irregularities are exposed
1st person to be trapped

1040
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:29,792
will be the corrupt
Electricity minister

1041
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,326
He is C K Dinakaran,
present Home minister

1042
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:51,041
l've committed some blunders
in the beginning of my political career

1043
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:56,079
l will soon be celebrating
25 years of being an MLA

1044
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:01,557
Now my good name and
my reputation is in your hands

1045
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:05,990
We will abandon the dam

1046
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:14,505
The tunnel and its leaks will stop
Just tell us what you want?

1047
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:21,537
lf you plan to oppose it
then your life will be at stake

1048
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:27,386
This may have been a blunder
committed in the zeal of your career

1049
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:32,720
But the supervisor Thomas Kurien
who pointed flaws in the tunnel

1050
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:38,028
whom you killed
was my father!

1051
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:45,262
Thomas chetan is
Varghese sir's father?

1052
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,743
My intention is not revenge
like in the movies

1053
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:57,077
l won't allow the dam to be abandoned
to hide the corruption of a handful of people

1054
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:02,253
Don't think you can buy me
Nor will your threats affect me

1055
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:10,159
That video file is safe and
well guarded by someone he trusts

1056
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:12,558
That's why they won't harm him

1057
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:17,664
But once they get the video file
they'll finish him off!

1058
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,400
Where is that file?

1059
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:22,303
l don't know

1060
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,069
You don't, eh?
Come on, tell me

1061
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,413
What the hell are you doing?

1062
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:32,150
Do you think he'll entrust me
with such a valuable evidence?

1063
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,446
l don't have it

1064
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:35,249
Neither do l know
where it is

1065
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,123
Where could he have?

1066
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,384
l don't know

1067
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,427
l'll find out

1068
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:45,258
l won't allow the dam
to be abandoned

1069
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,923
Why are you getting
involved in all this?

1070
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:50,001
Remember that night
you claimed you saw Koshy?

1071
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,603
l knew you were right

1072
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:56,436
l blindly opposed it
to stop you from getting involved

1073
01:31:56,611 --> 01:32:00,547
Have you become so muddled?

1074
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:07,109
An innocent man like you
can't tackle them

1075
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:08,779
Agitation will not help

1076
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:12,487
Once Varghese sir is gone
the dam will be abandoned

1077
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:18,290
You, me and everybody else will leave
looking for new means of livelihood

1078
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,961
The Vellimala village
will become a cemetery

1079
01:33:03,544 --> 01:33:08,538
Koshy?

1080
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,676
Jenny?!

1081
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:32,301
Brother

1082
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:34,440
We read a news item about
a cultural fest on green arts

1083
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,270
A fund raising program
in Mankulam

1084
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,777
The president, Mercy teacher
is our family friend

1085
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,748
While Home Minister Dinakaran
is the Chief Guest

1086
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,908
...if the Home Minister supports us
we can rescue Varghese sir easily

1087
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:48,715
We plan to meet the Minister
with the help of Mercy teacher

1088
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:06,066
Trees stand to provide
for others their shade and fruits

1089
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:13,511
Good people on earth are like the trees;
serving others while they suffer

1090
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:18,551
Will all this fade away forever?

1091
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:23,586
Will they never reappear?.

1092
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:26,784
Flower gardens and glades
Cool breeze, fields to graze

1093
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:31,957
Will fields and forests perish in fires
as mounds of ashes like funeral pyres

1094
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:40,169
Forward or backward distraught
Lost, directionless and misguided oft

1095
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:49,481
Surging forward with screams, aimlessly
This world turns unrecognizable, totally

1096
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:54,111
Black acid rains and burning embers red
fall on earth ceaselessly, heralding dread

1097
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:57,782
Do we have another valley
to go and repose silently

1098
01:34:58,325 --> 01:35:02,853
Black acid rains and burning embers red
fall on earth ceaselessly, heralding dread

1099
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:06,729
Do we have another valley
to go and repose silently

1100
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:11,794
Will all this fade away forever?

1101
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:25,803
Will there be a dawn?

1102
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:34,376
ls there a dawn, a new morn
Will a new age here, be born

1103
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:39,318
Bees hover over flowers,
fishes swim in rippling rivers

1104
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:42,928
Where the sky mirrors
myriad of colors

1105
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:51,804
When songs of birds trills
with honeyed sweetness fills

1106
01:36:52,173 --> 01:37:00,512
Mother earth, like a Goddess gratified
Times when mind was serenely satisfied

1107
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:05,210
As light of a new dawn shines brightly
rain on earth falls in showers of mercy

1108
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:09,255
Will we find a valley more lovely
A haven to live life contentedly?

1109
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:13,918
As light of a new dawn shines brightly
rain on earth falls in showers of mercy

1110
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:17,964
Will we find a valley more lovely
A haven to live life contentedly?

1111
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:23,098
Will all this fade away forever?

1112
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:31,134
Will they never reappear?.

1113
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,572
Flower gardens and glades
Cool breeze, fields to graze

1114
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:40,086
Will fields and forests perish in fires
as mounds of ashes like funeral pyres

1115
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:47,992
Forward or backward distraught
Lost, directionless and misguided oft

1116
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:57,166
Surging forward with screams, aimlessly
This world turns unrecognizable, totally

1117
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:01,966
Black acid rains and burning embers red
fall on earth ceaselessly, heralding dread

1118
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:05,637
Do we have another valley
to go and repose silently

1119
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:10,708
Black acid rains and burning embers red
fall on earth ceaselessly, heralding dread

1120
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:14,811
Do we have another valley
to go and repose silently

1121
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:20,115
Will all this fade away forever?

1122
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:40,674
Come inside

1123
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:44,878
lt's sheer luck
we met you, sir

1124
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:49,686
How can you discuss such
a sensitive issue in a public place?

1125
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:55,751
Come in

1126
01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:59,295
Wait here
l'll be back with the minister

1127
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,689
Okay, sir

1128
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:28,992
You've come to meet
the Home minister, eh?

1129
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:33,662
Now the Minister is
in need of your service

1130
01:39:36,837 --> 01:39:40,534
Shukur, get this girl into our vehicle
We must take herto her father

1131
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:47,443
Let me go

1132
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:52,050
- Let me go
- Move away

1133
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,415
Get them

1134
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:57,955
Come

1135
01:39:58,158 --> 01:39:59,216
Catch him

1136
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:09,031
You?

1137
01:40:09,136 --> 01:40:11,297
The TV channel representative!

1138
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:16,233
You get away from here

1139
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,772
Go quickly

1140
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,274
Shukur

1141
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:26,316
Johnny

1142
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:28,979
Narendra

1143
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:31,389
Nodon't

1144
01:40:58,485 --> 01:41:00,476
Go after those kids
and get them

1145
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:03,522
You stupid fellow!
You think you are a ClD?

1146
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,015
Shukur?

1147
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,206
Go and get him

1148
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,979
Brother, come

1149
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:37,849
Gogoquick!

1150
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:55,806
What is it?

1151
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:07,643
What Jenny says is true
l'm not capable of anything

1152
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:13,420
lf l decide to take action, Varghese sir
and everybody else's life will be in danger

1153
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:15,154
l should apologize
You promised you'd find

1154
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:19,391
my papa's kidnappers
and you did

1155
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,258
Didn't you save our lives?

1156
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:24,236
lf you hadn't come,
we'd be dead by now

1157
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:27,739
Home Minister is with them,
how will you manage?

1158
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:41,054
Whoeverthe kidnappers might be
l'm bravel know what to do

1159
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:53,122
What kind of black magic is this?!
Why must l alone suffer this?

1160
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:00,402
Let's go, l need
to do something

1161
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:03,937
Good evening
Lotus Hospital

1162
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:07,614
Dr Ravindranath is available
after 10:00 AM for consultation

1163
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:10,939
l want to meet Dr Shivaprasad

1164
01:43:11,084 --> 01:43:13,518
Now? He can see you
only tomorrow

1165
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:16,482
lt's urgent, why don't you
call him, he knows my case?

1166
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:21,723
Good evening, Doctor
Please hold on

1167
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:28,901
Remember Varghese sir
referring a case from Vellimala dam?

1168
01:43:29,136 --> 01:43:32,594
That's me, l must
meet you urgently, doctor

1169
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,268
Yes, doctor

1170
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,546
Put 3 drops in each eye
Now and in the morning

1171
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:52,557
The other tests will be
done tomorrow morning

1172
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,925
ls Dr Shivaprasad
an eye doctor?

1173
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:22,552
Gopi Krishnan, right?

1174
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:24,281
- Yes
- Sit down

1175
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:30,191
You returned from the army
due to problems in eyesight, right?

1176
01:44:30,297 --> 01:44:31,525
That's what they told me

1177
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:36,466
Was your eye injured any time?

1178
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:17,506
When we fight for the country
we don't think of our eyes or nose

1179
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:21,511
You see clear and
moving images, hmm?

1180
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:22,274
Yes

1181
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:29,050
Those images remain from
a few seconds to a minute, right?

1182
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,020
Yes

1183
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:34,119
Do you see only human forms
Or birds or animals also?

1184
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:38,958
Sometimes l see a dog
Suddenly a pit appears on the road

1185
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:53,012
Explosion you faced has
damaged your optical nerve

1186
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:56,375
That damage has increased now

1187
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:02,451
These optical nerves carry signals
of images from the eyes to the brain

1188
01:46:03,423 --> 01:46:09,089
When these signals fail to reach the brain
the brain itself begins to creates images

1189
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:11,459
leading to a rare disease

1190
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:21,234
CBS or Charles Bonnet Syndrome

1191
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:27,480
Recently a common friend
was diagnosed with CBS

1192
01:46:28,348 --> 01:46:31,715
There are many like this
who share your predicament

1193
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:37,780
People who have lived amidst
unnatural deaths tend to think about it

1194
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:42,988
The illusionary visions that occur
are people whom you have known

1195
01:46:43,196 --> 01:46:45,357
How can l be cured?

1196
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:47,658
CBS cannot be cured

1197
01:46:48,168 --> 01:46:54,505
lt usually lasts for
a year or 2, sometimes more

1198
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:58,172
What's important
is your mental strength

1199
01:46:58,445 --> 01:47:04,645
You must firmly believe these images
are caused purely by a defect of your vision

1200
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:06,615
You can overcome this

1201
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,751
lt has another major risk

1202
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:13,419
There's no point
hiding it from you

1203
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:15,657
This is also an indicator

1204
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:19,855
you might lose
your eyesight in future

1205
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,172
Why are you dumbfounded like this?

1206
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,707
When l was told
l was imagining!

1207
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:33,870
Goodness! What torture
l went through

1208
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:35,737
But your eyesight in future?

1209
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:40,080
All that is to be dealt with later
lt is my personal problem

1210
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:43,220
Now l can handle anything

1211
01:47:43,423 --> 01:47:45,721
Forthe sake of the dam
For Varghese sir

1212
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,288
l'll bring him from where ever he is
l will definitely be able to

1213
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:51,055
You must believe me

1214
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:03,839
Hello?

1215
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:06,504
lt's me, Chacko
Gopi Krishnan

1216
01:48:07,948 --> 01:48:08,744
lt's him

1217
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:11,580
Gopi, l knew you'd call

1218
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:15,777
Just come here with the kids
l'll save you from this mess

1219
01:48:16,089 --> 01:48:18,922
Don't worry Gopi,
l'll influence the Minister

1220
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:21,423
Did you think l called because
l was shivering with fright?

1221
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:25,122
Gopi, don't play
with the Home Minister

1222
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:27,097
- Your life can be ruined
- l know it, dude

1223
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,268
l have neither support
nor people to back me

1224
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:33,402
But l'll do what
a man with guts will do

1225
01:48:34,107 --> 01:48:36,337
You can catch me, give me up
to the police or anything else

1226
01:48:36,476 --> 01:48:40,242
You want to know our plans
lsn't that why you are calling us?

1227
01:48:40,347 --> 01:48:44,283
Your life now will be eventful
beyond your wildest imagination

1228
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:48,111
Where did you trace the call to?

1229
01:48:48,221 --> 01:48:49,882
He called from
Vandanmedu tower

1230
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:53,323
Great, call the boys
We'll get him immediately

1231
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,836
Go fast, l say

1232
01:49:19,352 --> 01:49:22,082
Stopstop
Reverse

1233
01:49:23,156 --> 01:49:26,216
Look! There he is
Go, catch him

1234
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:29,052
- Where is Gopi?
- l don't know

1235
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:31,858
- Give him a blow or 2
- You don't know, eh?

1236
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:33,825
Give him 1 more

1237
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:35,832
You fool, tell us where he is

1238
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:39,003
l tell you, l don't know
He left saying he'd find her dad

1239
01:49:39,105 --> 01:49:41,039
High hopes he'll find us
Drag him into the car

1240
01:49:41,174 --> 01:49:43,074
Get in

1241
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:44,504
Now go

1242
01:49:48,548 --> 01:49:49,344
Hello?

1243
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:52,685
Minister, we've got the kids

1244
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:55,684
They'll never see
the outside world again

1245
01:49:55,822 --> 01:49:56,948
What about Gopi?

1246
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,216
Since we have these 2
we'll soon get him also

1247
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:03,157
We are taking them to Varghese

1248
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,491
Do you need additional forces?

1249
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:09,167
Not necessary, our boys are
quite capable of handling this

1250
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:12,794
Sure, once he sees his daughter
he will talk about the video file

1251
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:15,898
Everything will end today
l'll call you back later

1252
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,436
Where are you taking us?

1253
01:50:19,913 --> 01:50:21,972
Don't be in a hurry,
Narendra, they are kids

1254
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:25,108
After all we are taking them
where their screams won't be heard

1255
01:50:25,218 --> 01:50:26,708
We'll deal with them there

1256
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:34,322
- Sir?
- Don't utter a word

1257
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:41,796
Sir, please don't hurt me
l'm innocent, l got trapped

1258
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:52,602
She's also innocent
l'll listen to all you say

1259
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:59,208
lf l die, my family will suffer
Don't harm me sir, please

1260
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:01,415
Let's think about it

1261
01:51:08,962 --> 01:51:11,795
- Then shall l get out here
- Get out?

1262
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:14,866
From Mamalakandam bus stop
l can take a bus back home

1263
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:18,469
We'll decide whether to send you
by bus or plane after reaching there

1264
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:41,152
Get out

1265
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:43,220
l told Chacko sir everything?

1266
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:45,520
Sir, should l come in?

1267
01:51:45,665 --> 01:51:47,860
Simpson Bungalow!
The name itself is so terrifying

1268
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:49,594
Walk in

1269
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:52,295
Let me go

1270
01:52:05,018 --> 01:52:06,212
Let me go

1271
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:09,219
Papa!

1272
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:16,356
Now tell us, where is
the video file you shot?

1273
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:23,968
We don't intend
troubling you any more

1274
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:26,269
Hey you!

1275
01:52:28,942 --> 01:52:31,809
You will witness today
what a father should not see

1276
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:36,842
Jenny

1277
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,791
Varghese just tell us
where the video file is

1278
01:52:58,404 --> 01:53:00,269
Shukur, Johnny

1279
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:09,405
Don't move!

1280
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,413
What did you say?
High hopes he'll find us!

1281
01:53:14,954 --> 01:53:21,086
l set up those kids as a ploy
to find this place, rascal

1282
01:53:49,689 --> 01:53:53,181
From Mamalakandam bus stop
l can take a bus back home

1283
01:53:58,464 --> 01:54:01,524
Simpson Bungalow...!
The name itself is so terrifying

1284
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:09,463
Varghese sir

1285
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:13,604
- Papa!
- My dear

1286
01:54:18,952 --> 01:54:25,118
- Stop there l say!
- Let me go

1287
01:54:26,092 --> 01:54:27,286
Kill him, da!

1288
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:44,473
Shukur, Johnny
Come quickly

1289
01:55:29,656 --> 01:55:32,284
Hands up! Don't move
l'll kill you!

1290
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:18,734
Koshy! Go!
Take them away

1291
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:30,605
Jennyleave

1292
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:37,621
Come on, quickly

1293
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:44,588
Don't let them go
Catch them, da!

1294
01:57:16,429 --> 01:57:18,124
PapaAnita chechi?

1295
01:57:18,264 --> 01:57:19,288
She would have come by now

1296
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:36,076
This video file is equal
to the cost of his life

1297
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:43,855
l kept it safe and sound
without giving in to any threat!

1298
01:57:49,362 --> 01:57:54,026
Electricity shortage looms large
as a great disaster before our eyes

1299
01:57:55,034 --> 01:57:59,664
Every unit of electricity
is precious and must be preserved

1300
01:57:59,872 --> 01:58:02,033
Hence this struggle

1301
01:58:02,608 --> 01:58:06,271
An ordinary but very brave man
Gopi Krishnan's involvement

1302
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:09,404
made it possible for me
to bring these truths out

1303
01:58:09,715 --> 01:58:12,878
Shocking news behind decisions
to abandon Vellimala dam revealed

1304
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:17,187
Visuals of leakages in the tunnel

1305
01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:24,051
Strong evidence that
can't be ignored has toppled...

1306
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:29,123
...positions of top officials
as well as the Home minister

1307
01:58:50,156 --> 01:58:51,214
What happened?

1308
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:03,097
Catch him
Don't let him go, da

1309
01:59:08,541 --> 01:59:10,509
Let's go
Quick

1310
01:59:36,536 --> 01:59:37,901
Faster!

1311
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:53,151
Gogo!

1312
01:59:57,924 --> 01:59:58,913
Go

1313
02:00:12,271 --> 02:00:14,671
Take this route
Only then we can catch him

1314
02:00:15,308 --> 02:00:16,332
Go fast

1315
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,818
Brother!

1316
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:11,961
They won't be able to
hurt Varghese sir anymore

1317
02:01:12,732 --> 02:01:14,359
Brother?

1318
02:01:14,467 --> 02:01:17,231
No, it's nothing
Nothing

1319
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:21,233
Come sit, brother

1320
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:35,044
Soldiers live only
for their motherland

1321
02:01:36,188 --> 02:01:39,589
The issues of the dam will be
looked after by Varghese sir

1322
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:41,392
Your problems also

1323
02:01:45,965 --> 02:01:49,230
When my people realize
that l was responsible

1324
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:52,769
seeing their happiness
is my greatestjoy!

1325
02:01:53,806 --> 02:01:58,800
1st l must tell Anita
it was a problem with my vision

1326
02:01:59,011 --> 02:02:00,808
l must tell her everything

1327
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:17,028
Anybody belonging
to Gopi Krishnan's family?

1328
02:02:18,664 --> 02:02:20,461
You can go in
and see if you want

1329
02:03:24,363 --> 02:03:27,196
To take part in this memorial service
dedicated to this brave soldier

1330
02:03:27,299 --> 02:03:30,700
his colleague and Chief
Major Lt Col Rajagopalan is also here

1331
02:03:33,272 --> 02:03:36,366
Gopi's own land but
without his existence!

1332
02:03:41,647 --> 02:03:50,851
l have many memories of that smart soldier
and the many struggles we faced together

1333
02:03:51,924 --> 02:03:58,352
His great desire to fight for
his Motherland often stunned me

1334
02:03:59,265 --> 02:04:03,395
lt was in one such incident
his eyesight was affected

1335
02:04:03,636 --> 02:04:06,400
And he started seeing
imaginary images

1336
02:04:08,507 --> 02:04:13,410
He was upset when he learned
he had to quit the army

1337
02:04:14,413 --> 02:04:17,678
He burst out crying telling me

1338
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:22,249
A soldier's duty is to fight
the enemies for his country...

1339
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:26,649
lt need not be on the war front

1340
02:04:28,627 --> 02:04:33,087
Till his last breath,
Gopi was a true soldier!

1341
02:04:36,802 --> 02:04:40,704
Vellimala dam, once doomed to be abandoned
is very much alive and functioning today
