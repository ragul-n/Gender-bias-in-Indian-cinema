00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,370
'One cannot hide the truth
by presenting fake flowers...

4
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,720
for, false principles
emit no fragrance!'

5
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
Speak your lines properly.

6
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,430
Hurry up, the play
is about to begin.

7
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,850
Attention everyone.

8
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,110
The emperor is arriving
in his court.

9
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,130
I am in the court.
Present the prince.

10
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,380
Princess Meera and prince Ratan,
please appear in the court!

11
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,750
Princess Meera and prince Ratan,
are summoned to the court!

12
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,170
Minister, start the proceedings.

13
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,880
Your majesty, the princess and the prince
have been in love since childhood.

14
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,720
They want to get married.

15
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,200
Oh! So, does anyone have any objections?

16
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
The law doesn't permit it, your majesty.

17
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,390
As per the will made
by princess Meera's father...

18
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,270
she should be marrying prince
Ratan's elder brother, prince Chaman.

19
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,650
Prince Ratan and
prince Chaman are twin brothers.

20
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,290
If they are twins then how can
one be elder to the other?

21
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,600
Prince Chaman was born
fifteen minutes earlier.

22
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,990
This is why, in the eyes of law,
he is the elder brother.

23
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,040
Present prince Chaman in the court!

24
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,380
Prince Chaman, please
appear in the court!

25
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,460
This really is a miracle of nature!

26
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,810
It indeed is difficult to tell them apart.
What do you think?

27
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,520
You are right, your majesty.

28
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,540
Prince Ratan's birth mark
can help you to identify them.

29
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,410
- Princess Meera.
- Yes, your majesty?

30
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,470
If they both look alike, why do you
object to marrying the elder one?

31
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,610
Pardon me, your highness, but
I love his heart and not his face.

32
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,400
You fall in love with the heart
and not with the face.

33
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,830
You cannot fall
in love with anyone!

34
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,540
When they are identical, then how can
you distinguish between their hearts?

35
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,110
Your majesty, the eyes can make
a mistake but not the heart.

36
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,190
My eyes can make a mistake
but not my heart.

37
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,080
Doesn't a blind man find
his way even in the dark?

38
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,780
That was nice! Princess, I am
very pleased with your answers!

39
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,210
I respect your sentiments.

40
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,970
But, unfortunately, I am constrained
by the shackles of law.

41
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,590
That is why I'm compelled to say
you can't marry prince Ratan.

42
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Your highness, I am compelled
at the hands of my love.

43
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,020
But I am compelled at
the hands of law, princess!

44
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,060
What noise was that?

45
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,320
A rider is coming
this way, your majesty!

46
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,840
Wait! Princess Meera
cannot marry prince Chaman!

47
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,730
Ask me why?

48
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,380
Who are you to voice your
opinion against my verdict?

49
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,550
I beg your pardon, your highness.
I havn't raised my voice...

50
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,710
against your verdict.
I've expressed my views!

51
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,320
Don't you know that prince Chaman
was born fifteen minutes earlier?

52
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,090
That is why he is younger.
Give me a chance to prove it.

53
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,200
- Go ahead.
- And if you cannot prove it, you'll be beheaded.

54
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,940
I agree to it. Your majesty,
this is a glass pipe...

55
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,300
and these are two marbles.
One is white, the other black.

56
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,010
I'm putting both the marbles
inside this pipe.

57
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,820
Now see yourself
which marble comes out first.

58
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,420
It's obvious, the one which was put
in last, which means the black one.

59
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,220
Thus, prince Chaman, who was
born fifteen minutes earlier...

60
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,540
is actually fifteen minutes
younger. Ask me why?

61
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,140
Very good, young man! You have
presented the case in a new light...

62
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,640
and compelled me
to change my decision.

63
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,040
Princess Meera should
get married to prince Ratan.

64
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,320
Ask me why?

65
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,810
- Chaman, where is Ratan?
- He's playing with Meera.

66
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,050
With Meera around,
he forgets the entire world.

67
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,870
You sit here.
I'll go and get him.

68
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,480
Eat the food.

69
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,666
Eat it now or it will get cold.

70
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,610
Wait, let me finish
reading the newspaper.

71
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,380
Damned be this newspaper!
It's like another woman in my life!

72
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,220
- You want to read all the time!
- Alright. I stopped. Is it okay now?

73
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,120
- You also eat.
- No, first the husband eats and then the wife.

74
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,290
Times have changed, my dear.
These days, husband and wife eat together!

75
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,860
Come, eat with me. Without you
I won't enjoy my meal.

76
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,010
You brats! You are imitating us?

77
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,076
- Don't you want to go to the fair?
- Of course father, I want to!

78
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,400
Then let's go. Chaman is
waiting for us in the car.

79
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,350
- Can Meera also come?
- Yes, she may, but she has to ask her father.

80
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,620
Or, the poor blind man
will keep looking for her.

81
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,050
- Go child and come back soon!
- I'll be back in a jiffy!

82
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,160
What's the matter child?
You seem very excited.

83
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,490
Father, can I go
to the fair with Ratan?

84
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,700
No child, strong winds
are blowing today.

85
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,750
Your blind father's intuition says
there will be a storm today.

86
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,800
No father, I will go!

87
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,470
- Ratan is with me.
- Alright child, you can go.

88
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,600
Wait, are your hair
and clothes alright?

89
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,380
- My daughter is very pretty!
- But... you are...

90
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:08,360
Even I don't understand how
I can see you when I am blind?

91
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,970
- They're calling me.
- Okay child, you can go.

92
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,460
Be careful, Meera.

93
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
Hello, so you've come
to see the fair?

94
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,120
I've brought the children to see
the fair. Our days have gone!

95
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,920
Ratan, don't go very far.

96
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,530
Life is a story, my friend

97
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:28,700
Everyone narrates their
own tales. This life is a story

98
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,300
In this carnival, there are
many princes and princesses

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,880
There is victory and defeat and
togetherness in this carnival

100
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,230
There are giant wheels,
merry-go-rounds and toy trains

101
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,660
There are performances
of many acts here

102
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:22,170
Life also keeps moving like
the pace of this fair, my friend

103
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,670
Take these colorful balloons
of different shapes and sizes

104
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:55,870
Come here Chunnu, Munnu,
take these fancy balloons

105
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,220
My dear little child,
tell me what is your name?

106
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:11,340
Hold the string tightly,
don't let it loose

107
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,640
This string will bind
your love to you

108
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,730
Wonder where our fate
will take us in future

109
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:59,230
Who knows who has to cry
at the hands of fate?

110
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:08,370
True love once ingrained,
never dies

111
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,950
Don't wander or stray from your path.
Life keeps moving, my friend

112
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Life is a story, my friend

113
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,690
Who is speaking?
From the police station?

114
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,450
You have no information about Ratan?

115
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,610
Child, where were you? Chaman has
been waiting to play with you.

116
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,600
- I don't want to play.
- Father said Ratan will never return.

117
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,210
He'll surely come back! He promised
that he would never leave me!

118
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,569
- Won't he come back, father?
- He will surely come back, child.

119
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,010
But, now you play with Chaman.

120
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,120
No father, I don't feel like
playing with anyone!

121
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:29,080
My childhood has passed
in thoughts of you

122
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Now, my youth calls out to you

123
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,300
Where are you,
oh prince of my dreams?

124
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,770
My youth has arrived.
You, too, must return

125
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,640
For the sake of my love...

126
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,360
for the sake of the affection
we shared in our childhood

127
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,790
Come and narrate
those same stories to me

128
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:27,270
These sparkling stars
call out to you

129
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,970
The weather is hinting
something to you

130
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,900
Come and teach me
the meaning of all this

131
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,250
I have expressed my feelings

132
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:26,040
These endless nights
are tormenting me

133
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,970
Come and brighten up my nights

134
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,730
Child, I heard that a good play
is running in Chaman's theater.

135
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,950
Must be. But, you cannot see.

136
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,670
I can't see with my eyes,
but your eyes can definitely see it.

137
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,400
I have told you many times, I'm not
interested in Chaman or his theater.

138
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,650
Child...

139
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,100
you have to learn a very
important lesson in life.

140
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,260
The present is your life,
not your past.

141
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,030
That's why you should
get out of your dream world.

142
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,750
Many years have passed
since Ratan was lost.

143
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,940
His father also died
with that sorrow.

144
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,170
There's no proof Ratan is still alive.

145
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,590
Holding on to your past memories
is injustice towards life.

146
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,760
But father, you told me
Ratan would come back.

147
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,370
You were the one who sowed
the seed of his memory in my mind.

148
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,450
Now this seed has grown with me.
How can I cut it off?

149
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,320
By saying that, I was trying
to console your childhood.

150
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,080
I always believed in that,
and now you ask me to forget him?

151
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,190
I can't do that, father!

152
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,160
In the journey of life,
if you lose one support...

153
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,720
you have to resort to another.

154
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,300
I've heard Chaman is waiting for you.

155
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,780
When I see him,
I can't forget Ratan.

156
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,830
As you wish, child.
Actually, Chaman is also a nice boy.

157
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,410
What's this? Why have
you put the bucket here?

158
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,460
Is this the way to work?

159
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,650
Get out of my way! Useless men!

160
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,560
Yes, this is Dewan Chaman speaking.

161
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,780
How much did you say it cost?
Okay, buy it for me!

162
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,510
Yes, buy 500 Rupees worth.

163
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,700
- Who is it?
- Your maid.

164
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,060
Oh, Rassilybai, how did
the lamp think of the moth today?

165
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,610
Without the moth, who would
think about the lamp?

166
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,280
You seem to be in a great mood!
From which drama are these lines?

167
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,030
The one in which
you play with my heart.

168
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,690
Excellent! I like
your presence of mind.

169
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,100
After all, you're
the heroine of our theater.

170
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,150
Thanks for the appreciation.

171
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,670
I'm introducing a new dance today.
I hope you'll attend.

172
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,490
How can I not come
when you invite me?

173
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,970
My master will get pulled
towards you! Ask me why?

174
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,450
Who could it be other than Chatpat?

175
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,490
- What did Rassilybai say?
- She says I have spoiled you.

176
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,030
Tell her I'm your close confidant.
She should mind her own business.

177
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,980
Okay, stop this nonsense
and let's go.

178
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,240
Chatpat, did you invite
Meera for the new play?

179
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,560
Meera? Have you asked Rassily?

180
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,240
How is Rassily connected
with Meera?

181
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,930
Think again. Rassilybai isn't
in such a good mood these days.

182
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,080
Seth Sampatlal of Model Theater
is wooing your actress these days.

183
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,690
How dare he?
I'll wring his neck!

184
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,500
It's a crime to wring
someone's neck. Ask me why?

185
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,250
Seth Sampatlal, you scoot
before Chaman arrives here.

186
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,990
He's quite hot tempered.
I hope that he doesn't...

187
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,260
Wring my neck? Never mind,
I'll die for your sake.

188
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,370
You may want to die,
but I haven't begun hating my life.

189
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,530
- What do you want from me?
- Why does a thirsty man go to the well?

190
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,760
- To drown!
- Why are you so attached to Chaman's theater?

191
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:18,060
If you join my theater, I swear,
the world will be at your feet!

192
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,990
He's been harassing me
for a long time.

193
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,930
He won't do it anymore.

194
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,890
I hope he's not dying.
He's a heart patient.

195
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,890
Heart patient. ls someone
around? Throw him out!

196
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,570
The poor man has a weak heart.

197
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,300
Before worrying about his heart,
why don't you think about me?

198
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,650
Why should I cure you
if someone else injured you?

199
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,090
You have injured me.
Only you can cure me!

200
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,870
Ask me why?
You are romancing here...

201
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,930
and there, Meera has
come to the theater.

202
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,820
Rassily, let the performance
be extraordinary today.

203
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,000
Just because Meera is here?

204
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,350
Her name has caused you excitement.
Now you have injured. Can you cure me?

205
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,490
Don't you understand? The disease
is the same. The doctors have changed.

206
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,240
Sometimes, glass can look
more beautiful than a diamond.

207
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,040
But, one shouldn't try to
be a diamond to prove that.

208
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,280
Then let the diamond become glass!

209
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:08,390
Forget him. Only a person
like me understands your value.

210
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,610
But, you never look at me.

211
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,610
Oh! So you're the one
I've been looking for?

212
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,430
- Ask me why?
- Now you ask me why!

213
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,370
Don't ask me this way.

214
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,420
I can't believe my good
fortune at seeing you here.

215
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,630
Father insisted I should come.

216
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,560
How I wish your father
would force you everyday.

217
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,100
The show's started.

218
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,360
Yesterday, my eyes met
your gaze at Chowpatty

219
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,470
I was stunned and I forgot
what I was eating

220
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,500
Romeos like you roam around with
their hearts on their sleeves

221
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:50,286
Seeing a girl, they give out
their heart and fall in love

222
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,700
I am not one of them

223
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,980
Unfortunately, I met your gaze

224
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,320
Your name is etched out on
every drop of my blood, my dear

225
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,540
No my beloved, don't do that.
Know that I believe

226
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,010
I belong to you
and you belong to me

227
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,360
I'm glad that
my eyes met your gaze

228
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,586
In the moonlit nights,
let our passions rise

229
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,960
During balmy weather,
let us be together

230
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,320
If this comes true then life
will have the color of spring

231
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:42,370
Let us walk hand in hand,
with our youth and romance alive

232
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,470
Let there be faith and
love in our hearts

233
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,430
You came for a walk with me.
Why did you fall in love?

234
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,220
Didn't you feel ashamed?

235
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,150
Answer me Shilu. With whom
have your eyes met?

236
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:36,650
Yes mother, I have
fallen in love with him

237
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,300
Since you have left,
my heart is not at peace

238
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:52,680
Our love story has
turned topsy turvy

239
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,130
Yesterday, my eyes met
your gaze at Chowpatty

240
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,090
- Did you like the dance, Meera?
- It wasn't bad.

241
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,080
Why don't you take
an interest in my theater?

242
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,759
You were very interested
in theater when you were small.

243
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,990
I have lost something in my
childhood which was dear to me.

244
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,050
You will never find it again!
Meera, this world is of live people.

245
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,580
It is better to forget the dead.

246
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,620
Meera, the way you love
Ratan's memories...

247
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,680
you can make me your slave
with even half of that love!

248
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,450
Love cannot be traded, Mr. Chaman.

249
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,940
I promised Ratan that
I would always belong to him.

250
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,920
I have not been able to
forget that promise.

251
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,820
I have forgotten
all my childhood memories.

252
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,670
After being injured ten years ago,
I was brought to this orphanage.

253
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,130
Due to a blow to my head,
I have forgotten my past.

254
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,580
Since then, this orphanage
has been my home.

255
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,260
The children here are my siblings...

256
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,780
and the administrators
are my parents!

257
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,240
They named me Ashok
and gave me a new life.

258
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,320
I was given the education of
responsibility and justice.

259
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,000
Because of this education,
at this young age...

260
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,270
I am a magistrate in Gorakhpur.

261
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,100
And I have earned
respect in your hearts.

262
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,320
The only message I have for
the children here is that...

263
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,220
they should follow the same
footsteps and progress in life!

264
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,930
Finally, I'd like to say something
about my dear friend, Mr. Mohan.

265
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,750
It's due to his charity that
this orphanage is still running.

266
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:28,640
You all know him as a well known
industrialist and wealthy man.

267
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,660
But I've had the good fortune
to gain his friendship too.

268
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,640
Therefore, I can say with confidence,
that under his guidance...

269
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,290
this orphanage will progress further.

270
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,660
On behalf of you all and me...

271
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,570
I would like to thank my friend,
Judge Ashok Kumar...

272
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:56,680
and his wife Mrs. Leela Devi...

273
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,500
for honoring us and participating
in our annual function.

274
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,330
Ashok, you speak so well that...

275
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,090
I feel like erecting a statue
of you for the whole town.

276
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,270
You can fulfill your
desire after I die.

277
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,950
This desire can be fulfilled
even while you're alive...

278
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,410
if, Leela Devi supports me.

279
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,310
You are such a fool!

280
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,550
- Are we meeting this evening?
- Ashok is coming this way.

281
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,910
Ashok is really
a very good friend.

282
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,530
Do I dare to put
this garland around your wife?

283
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,190
This mark is my only childhood
memory. I remember nothing else.

284
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,700
If you don't remember, then why do
you always talk about your childhood?

285
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,570
You're right.
My condition is like the man...

286
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,350
who has put his treasure
somewhere and forgotten it.

287
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,610
I can't remember and
I cannot even forget it.

288
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,650
Forget it. What do you care
about your childhood?

289
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,540
- By God's grace, you have position, respect...
- And I have you.

290
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,130
There, the bell has rung
for you to go to the court.

291
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,290
Okay, let me go and
hand out my verdicts.

292
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,370
You touch me as if
you are punishing a criminal.

293
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,690
Your conversation enchants me.

294
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,010
I have to go to work or I'd be sitting
in front of you all the time.

295
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:06,340
You always say such things.

296
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,270
Listen, please come back soon.

297
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,050
- Why?
- I want to buy a necklace.

298
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,550
I don't have a single piece
of useful jewelry.

299
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,360
I have a hearing of a special case,
I won't be able to return early.

300
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,910
I'll call up Mohan.
He'll go to the bazaar with you.

301
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,740
I don't like it when
you send Mohan with me.

302
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,910
Leela, don't ever say that.

303
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,860
It is a sin to think like that
about a friend like Mohan.

304
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,300
I'm sorry, your honor.

305
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,680
If you appear in
my court as a criminal...

306
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,920
then I'll never
pass a just verdict.

307
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,390
Wait. Let me straighten your tie.
I like it this way.

308
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,480
No, I can't take you to court.

309
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,790
A man should learn from a dog
how to be faithful.

310
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,240
- He is such a great animal.
- But he tries to bite me.

311
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,390
It's said that dogs can differentiate
between good and bad.

312
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,030
You mean I should get a character
certificate from your dog?

313
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,400
You're late again! I wish you
could know how restless I am.

314
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,000
And I wish you could
know my difficulties.

315
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,090
This means the judge
was late leaving for court?

316
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,550
What was he talking about?

317
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,040
The usual romantic talk
a husband and wife share.

318
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,290
Leela, I've told you not
to make me feel jealous.

319
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,400
Hello Mohan, this is Ashok.

320
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,430
- Why are you scared hearing me?
- No! Why should I be scared?

321
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,040
- Tell me?
- My wife wants to go shopping today.

322
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,830
- Please go with her.
- No Ashok, I'm very busy today.

323
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,580
Yes, I'm sorry. I won't
be able to go today.

324
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,360
- What, you won't be able to come?
- I'll be there right away, my dear.

325
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,050
- Don't forget the necklace.
- I'll bring it along.

326
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,070
Your honor, this is
the same necklace...

327
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,780
given to the accused's wife by her lover.

328
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,930
And with this, the accused
strangled his wife.

329
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,150
The accused's wife's lover
was his best friend.

330
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:30,050
For five years, they had an illicit
relationship and fooled the accused.

331
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:38,900
But, how did a smart man not know
of this illicit relationship?

332
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,570
Your honor, when the left hand
tries to harm the right hand...

333
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,460
when our own people
try to betray us...

334
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,270
then the smartest ones
can also be duped.

335
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,870
The accused loved
his wife immensely.

336
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,350
And his friend
was very dear to him.

337
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,600
Your honor, when your own
people betray you...

338
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,440
then how can an intelligent
man not be cheated?

339
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,460
I would also get cheated, and,
I beg your pardon, even you.

340
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:34,650
Celebrate life and
sing the song of love

341
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:41,020
For the sake of our youth,
douse the fire in my heart

342
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,950
Sparkle my world, oh my beloved,
come close to me

343
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,120
I still am young

344
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,660
Don't bother about the defamation
levied by the world

345
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:26,960
Being cheerful is the
true essence of living

346
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,800
You keep smiling,
keep singing and dancing

347
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,190
And these are the letters written
by the accused's wife to her lover.

348
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,790
Excuse me, but
the court has to be adjourned.

349
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:06,050
I have to go on an official trip
to Mussorie tomorrow morning.

350
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,220
You can send the other documents
to my residence.

351
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,380
- Greetings, sir!
- Hello.

352
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:33,240
- Everyone is talking about you.
- Why, what have I done?

353
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,900
The Assembly elections are nearing
and we want you to enter.

354
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,950
No, I would like to serve you
through the means of law and justice.

355
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,550
Please excuse me.

356
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,280
He is a very noble man.

357
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,510
Lalaji, I need
a necklace for my wife.

358
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,970
Sure, have a look.

359
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,140
- See this one too!
- What is the price?

360
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,190
I want to charge you more.
I acquired it for three thousand.

361
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,690
That's too much. I don't
earn an extra income.

362
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,520
- Show me something cheaper.
- Something cheaper...

363
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,150
A cheap gift won't be appreciated, sir.

364
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:33,850
Of course not. It's the love in
the gift which is appreciated.

365
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,380
It's worth ten thousand.
Just for you.

366
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,330
It is indeed very beautiful!

367
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,780
Love is measured with
the value of the gift.

368
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:54,100
Forget it. Ashok never
returns before 5 o'clock.

369
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,060
Oh Mohan, it's you!
No wonder Jackie was barking.

370
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,720
Why are you looking like that?

371
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,630
Seeing you together, I remembered
the hearing of today's case.

372
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:42,340
One man's wife and his friend
duped him for 5 years...

373
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,710
and had illicit relations.

374
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,700
Tell me, how can anyone believe it?

375
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,070
Darling, why do you
talk about such things?

376
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,430
- I felt as though...
- I was doubting you?

377
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,190
You are so naive, and silly!

378
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,500
How can I doubt you?
Or for that matter, Mohan?

379
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,830
You both mean the world to me.

380
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,410
Oh, Leela! I have
bought a necklace for you.

381
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,790
Here it is.
It's not very expensive.

382
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,940
It's the love that counts.
Right, Mohan?

383
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,990
It's the love that counts,
not the money spent.

384
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,380
That's exactly what I told the shopkeeper,
but he was a fool.

385
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,060
Mohan, you dropped your handkerchief.

386
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,850
What will you do here alone?
Mussorie is a lovely place.

387
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,990
Seeing the snow there,
you'll feel extremely happy.

388
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,350
Mohan, you convince Leela.

389
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:04,570
I'm telling her to come to Mussorie,
but she doesn't want to.

390
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:08,250
Go with him Leela.
He really wants you to go along.

391
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,940
You think I like staying
here without Ashok?

392
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,370
But the fact is,
a long journey makes me sick.

393
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,520
Alright, I'm resigned to my fate.

394
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,840
But my friend, take care
of her in my absence.

395
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,980
If she complains then
you'll be severely punished.

396
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,930
That's what you get
for befriending a judge.

397
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,310
You are right!

398
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,420
Oh, Chaman! When did you come?

399
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,090
Even the Gods will come down
listening to your enchanting music.

400
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,330
I'm just a mere human.

401
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,830
I wonder where my God is
that he cannot hear me.

402
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:17,040
That's strange. The one I consider
my God, is looking for another God.

403
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,690
How long will you
keep waiting for someone?

404
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:26,300
How long will you burn your beauty
and youth for someone's memory?

405
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,870
Until I have completely perished.

406
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,710
Meera, don't be foolish.
Your life means the world to me.

407
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,340
Ask me why?

408
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,730
Have you no sense of timing, Chatpat?

409
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,810
First listen to me.
Then you'll understand.

410
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,080
Rassily has gone to Sampatlal.

411
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,800
What? This is impossible!
Where are they now?

412
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,240
I want Chaman to burn in
the same fire he has burned me!

413
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,290
When he finds me with you...

414
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:08,580
You with me! Rassily, my heart
cannot take this excitement.

415
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,460
Sir!

416
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,470
How dare you?

417
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,070
- Is he dead?
- What have you done, Chaman?

418
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,510
Now run away from here quickly!

419
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,950
Today's headlines,
Seth Sampatlal was murdered.

420
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,080
The killer escaped in a car!
Today's headlines!

421
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,570
Sir!

422
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,870
Your headlights are on.

423
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,540
- I need a room.
- Yes sir.

424
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:22,400
Are you speaking from Gorakhpur?
Oh, give the phone to madam.

425
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,100
Hello Leela,
this is Ashok speaking.

426
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,390
Yes, I am fine but, how are you?

427
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,060
Does Mohan keep visiting?
I'll return in three or four days.

428
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,590
He is a judge in Gorakhpur,
a very nice man!

429
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,420
Take him to room number 10.

430
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:57,310
Come, sir.

431
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,760
I can't sleep at night, doctor.
I've tried many medicines.

432
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,190
There's no medical problem.
Perhaps you can't sleep due to stress.

433
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:10,210
Anyway, take two tablets
before you sleep.

434
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,380
You'll be able to sleep well,
but don't take more than two.

435
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,730
Is it very strong, doctor?

436
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,760
They are strong. A person can die
if he consumes four tablets.

437
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,920
A person can die?

438
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,730
Yes, that's why
you should be careful.

439
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,600
- I think I've seen you somewhere before.
- Perhaps.

440
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,010
My name is Ashok Kumar.
I'm a magistrate in Gorakhpur.

441
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,680
- Are you staying in this hotel?
- Yes, room number 11.

442
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,020
This means you're my neighbor,
I'm in room number 10.

443
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,530
That's nice.

444
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:32,470
- Send two cups of coffee to my room.
- Alright, sir.

445
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:55,940
Sir, it's only 10 P.M. Why don't
you come and play cards with me?

446
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,550
Alright.

447
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,530
I have to take sleeping pills.

448
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,380
But, do these pills really work?

449
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,540
Yes, I do get sleep.

450
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:49,240
I'm sure. I'm getting sleepy
just seeing you drink that.

451
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:03,190
Okay. I will take your leave now.

452
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,970
What's the hurry? It's only 11 P.M.

453
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,980
I'm very tired.
I've traveled all day.

454
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,960
Sir, what's the matter?
You look very frightened.

455
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,430
Of course not.

456
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,270
Sir, your car is here.

457
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,190
This is your car.

458
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,700
The famous judge, Ashok Kumar
from Gorakhpur passed away...

459
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,120
in a car accident.

460
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:19,570
He'll survive, but the medicine
has had a bad effect on him.

461
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,350
He might even lose his memory.

462
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,280
I warned him not to have
more than two tablets.

463
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,700
But, I think he's had more.

464
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:33,590
Manager, he is Dewan Chaman,
the murderer of Seth Sampatlal.

465
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,980
Murderer?

466
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,700
I think he tried to commit suicide.

467
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,710
Anyway, take him to the hospital.

468
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,990
I recognized him the minute
he entered the hotel.

469
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,100
He had the eyes of a murderer.

470
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:14,700
Friends, the cruel hands of fate have
suddenly snatched Ashok from us...

471
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:21,310
and given us an irreparable shock.

472
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:28,550
There's no one in the city
who's not grieving his death.

473
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:35,300
It's not sufficient to just shed
tears for a personality like Ashok.

474
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,540
In fact, we should keep
his memory alive forever.

475
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,670
Ashok's wife and I feel that...

476
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,210
a statue should
be built in his memory.

477
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:53,430
And I hope that you all will
sincerely help us in this endeavor.

478
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:54,680
Surely!

479
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,060
Why did you think of a statue?

480
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:12,770
Remember, I promised Ashok during
the annual function of the orphanage.

481
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,140
- You're so naughty.
- Really?

482
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,949
You're not in a hotel.
You're in a hospital, Mr. Chaman.

483
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,959
Chaman? My name isn't Chaman.

484
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:42,659
Mr. Chaman, don't try to hide yourself.

485
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,230
The police told us everything.

486
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:49,570
Police? But, I came
here on an official trip.

487
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:54,540
Your mind has gone on a trip.

488
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:03,069
I don't understand.
What's the matter?

489
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:09,199
Nurse, how did I come here?

490
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,270
What we feared has happened.
His mind has been affected.

491
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,650
Anyway, we have to be extra careful.

492
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:33,449
Your honor, accused
number one, Dewan Chaman...

493
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,860
is admitted in Mussorie
hospital for treatment...

494
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:40,840
and accused number two, Rassilybai,
is present in the court.

495
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,470
But, before starting
the proceedings of the court...

496
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,960
I would like you to see
the doctor's report.

497
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:53,740
It is evident that Sampatlal
didn't die from Chaman's attack...

498
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:57,790
but due to a massive heart attack.

499
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,650
After reading the report...

500
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:04,590
there is no point in continuing
the case against the accused.

501
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,660
Therefore, I appeal to the court...

502
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,540
that both the accused
should be set free.

503
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:19,030
Congratulations Mr. Chaman.
You've been acquitted of the murder charge.

504
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:24,690
I knew it the minute I saw him,
that he was innocent.

505
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,890
Doctor, I've told you I'm not Chaman.
My name is Ashok.

506
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,940
- You mean Judge Ashok?
- Yes, I'm the same person.

507
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,910
- Listen to him.
- It's been many days since Judge Ashok passed away.

508
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,170
Read this article.

509
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,190
We'll have to send him
to a mental asylum.

510
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:03,200
I knew it the minute I saw him
that he is a mad man!

511
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,630
Ask me why?

512
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,190
My name is Chatpat. Ask me why?

513
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,690
I have come here. Ask me why?

514
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,230
Why should I ask?

515
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:34,760
I mean doctor, how is Mr. Chaman?

516
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:43,070
Chaman? Oh yes.
He ran off from here last night night.

517
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,390
He's gone mad.

518
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,950
He calls himself
the Judge of Gorakhpur.

519
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,890
Judge of Gorakhpur?

520
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,490
Ask me why?

521
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:08,060
Ask me why? Why should I ask?

522
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,340
- Hello, Lalaji.
- Hello.

523
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,180
- Hey, Munshiji.
- Excuse me.

524
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,230
Nobody recognizes me.

525
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:50,650
Gorakhpur's famous judge,
died suddenly...

526
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,150
Please donate something.

527
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,610
- Donation for what?
- You seem to be new here.

528
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,710
Yes, you might think that.

529
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,640
Mr. Ashok was a very famous
personality of this town.

530
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:11,740
Every child of this town knew him.
He suddenly died...

531
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,330
and now his wife Leela
and friend Mohan...

532
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,030
wish to commission a statue in his memory.

533
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,740
Please donate for
this generous cause.

534
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,980
I should surely give something
for such a noble man!

535
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:37,740
This is a picture of Mr. Ashok
and his wife given to all donors.

536
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,970
Thank you very much.

537
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,360
They want me to donate
for my own statue?

538
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,440
This really is great!

539
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:56,200
Very soon I'll change your tears
of sorrows into happiness.

540
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:02,380
Perhaps fate wanted me to give
you proof of my love.

541
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:06,250
I'm coming to you, Leela.

542
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,140
Everything around looks so gloomy.

543
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,030
No, I shouldn't go this way.

544
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,680
I'll go very easily and lovingly.

545
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,070
I'll walk up stealthily
and cover Leela's eyes...

546
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:13,600
and I'll ask her who I am.
Let me see if she recognizes me.

547
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,400
- It's not Mohan.
- Then who is it? - A lover.

548
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,800
- Whose lover?
- A beautiful maiden's.

549
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,160
- Who is she?
- She's the queen of my heart.

550
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,670
- I know who she is.
- Tell me her name?

551
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,240
I won't.

552
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,760
Wow! It is so beautiful.

553
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:51,380
Only you know how to woo a woman.

554
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,610
In spite of being with me,
your husband never learned how.

555
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:58,690
Remember that day, when he
got you a cheap necklace?

556
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,540
Oh yes, that day
we managed to escape.

557
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:06,130
How well I managed to hide
the necklace you gave me.

558
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,910
You've also hidden well
the heart I gave you.

559
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,890
- Where is this noise coming from?
- Must be a stray dog.

560
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,980
Sometimes I fear that
Ashok is seeing us!

561
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,280
Silly woman, the one who could
not see us when he was alive...

562
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,660
how will he see us when he's dead?

563
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,190
My fate is doomed,
my world has crashed

564
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:54,150
No one belongs to anyone

565
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:59,080
Oh world, please tell me the truth

566
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:04,040
ls love also a fallacy?

567
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:27,150
When fate turns against you,
your shadow leaves your side

568
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:39,450
The beloved who is close to the
heart is the one who injures it

569
01:19:55,930 --> 01:20:03,930
Loyalty has no meaning,
no value in this world

570
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:16,190
The thing which is called love
is actually a myth

571
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:40,380
The boat managed to evade the storm
but broke down at the shore

572
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:52,520
Oh God, this is your world, where injustice
is doled out to the innocent

573
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:03,190
What are you doing?
Hey! Ask me why?

574
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:09,330
Chaman, I have been
looking for you everywhere.

575
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:15,120
And look at you. You're enjoying
watching people around you?

576
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,950
Oh! So now you don't
even recognize me?

577
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:30,580
Alright chief, I agree.
Stop playing this act with me.

578
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,850
You've been acquitted
of the charge of murder.

579
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:37,450
Come on, let's go back home.

580
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,730
He's gone mad. He thinks
he's a judge in Gorakhpur.

581
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,930
Now I understand.
The doctor wasn't wrong.

582
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,580
Anyway, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

583
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:04,320
We'll get you treated.
Everything can be bought with money.

584
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,930
'Life is to live.
Don't cross the railway tracks.'

585
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,750
That's what even I feel.
Life is to live.

586
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,800
A flourishing business has come
to a standstill without you...

587
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,090
and you're wandering around here?

588
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,650
Everyone thinks I'm Chaman.

589
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,830
I've seen this side of the world.

590
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,190
Now, let me see that side too.

591
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:40,060
Hey, everyone!

592
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:56,030
Welcome sir. By the grace
of God, you've returned.

593
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,680
- Who is he?
- He is our cook.

594
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:06,900
- Oh, yes. Budhwa.
- No, that's my wife's name.

595
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:12,370
That's his wife's name.
Ask me why? Go away now.

596
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,860
Come.

597
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:47,270
- Take it, Chaman.
- Oh yes, Chaman.

598
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:08,730
Okay, you sit here. I'll go and
make arrangements for tea.

599
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:40,440
He doesn't seem to
be Chaman, does he?

600
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,580
- Who are you?
- Don't you recognize me?

601
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:53,960
Actually, the thing is, I...

602
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,900
- I hope you recognized her.
- Is she my wife?

603
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:26,850
Ask me why? She wasn't
your wife. That was Meeradevi.

604
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:29,620
- She lives in the neighborhood.
- Neighborhood?

605
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:42,080
His arrival has brought spring
in my life and music to my ears

606
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,760
At last, I will meet my beloved

607
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:16,110
My heart skips a beat. There's
a feeling of exhilaration around

608
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:25,380
He has aroused my desires.
My eyes sparkle with joy

609
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,590
The night is lovely with
the moon shining bright

610
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:03,340
The stars are sparkling.
The flowers sway with joy

611
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:12,610
Finally, my love life has blossomed

612
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,640
Feelings in my heart are stirred

613
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:50,060
There is brightness everywhere.
My life is vibrant with colors

614
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,430
With one gaze, someone has
fulfilled all my desires

615
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:03,470
I am left blushing in my veil

616
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,490
Now I understand!

617
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:44,450
Ashok is dead forever.

618
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,540
Yes, this is Chaman speaking.

619
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,590
You aren't Chaman.

620
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:37,660
Yes, you're not Chaman.

621
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:42,160
That's what I say, too,
but nobody believes me.

622
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:47,140
Everyone calls me Chaman,
and now even I believe it!

623
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,090
- But, if you object then...
- Not at all.

624
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,950
The world has misunderstood
you by your face...

625
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:56,150
but they haven't
been unjust to you.

626
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,350
This house belongs to you.

627
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,160
That's really funny! Please sit.

628
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,410
You think I'm mad? I'm not Chaman,
and yet this house belongs to me?

629
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,070
That's right, you aren't Chaman,
and yet this house belongs to you.

630
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:34,580
Don't you remember anything
about your childhood days?

631
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,530
I don't remember anything.

632
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:43,270
And I wish to forget
whatever I remember.

633
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:50,180
Don't you remember two
small boys and their friend...

634
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,630
and for years,
she waited for someone.

635
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,930
Waited for years?

636
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:05,520
Nobody waits for anyone, Meeradevi.

637
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,430
Waiting is a poetic expression
which is written in books.

638
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:18,840
You tell me. Could you wait
for someone for years?

639
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,860
Ask me why?

640
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,760
Mister, Rassilybai is waiting
for you in the theater.

641
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:35,670
You're right my friend. Everyone
seems to be waiting for someone.

642
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,290
Did you hear that, Meeradevi?

643
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,700
Chatpat, tell me one more thing.

644
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:59,730
Did I love Rassily
or did she love me?

645
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:03,240
That was never decided. Ask me why?

646
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:08,020
Ask me why?

647
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:32,220
- Oh, hello!
- Hello! Sit.

648
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:40,550
I have come back.

649
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,660
- Your love brought me back.
- What?

650
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,460
Why do you look at me
like that? I'm Chaman.

651
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,260
- I love you.
- What?

652
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:55,590
Even you love me, Chatpat told me.

653
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,020
- Rassily, I...
- Chaman, you're back!

654
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:10,170
I was very worried about you.
I missed you a lot!

655
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,960
I used to dream about you.
I'm glad you're back.

656
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,910
Now we both will...

657
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:21,790
- Yes!
- Chatpat, what about the rehearsal?

658
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,010
Isn't that happening here?

659
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:32,090
Meera, you have come here, too?

660
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:34,520
I came here to learn acting.

661
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:38,300
I can go if you have a problem.

662
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:43,040
No, why do you want to go? Let's
go watch Rassily's dance rehearsal.

663
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,590
Our hearts are captivated in love...

664
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:40,320
but neither of us is aware of it

665
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,910
The days are full of desires.
The nights are youthful

666
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:15,860
We speak with our eyes

667
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:20,660
The fire of love is
burning at both ends

668
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:47,000
Since the day he arrived
as a guest in my heart...

669
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:02,550
he has aroused my desires

670
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:07,540
The first look of love is intense

671
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:35,970
My dreams of love
are yet unfulfilled

672
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:47,920
Hold my hands in your hands

673
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:52,800
Our destination is far,
the journey difficult

674
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:08,000
Our hearts are captivated by love...

675
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:17,990
but neither of us is aware of it

676
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,440
I'm not aware, either.
Ask me why?

677
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,500
Chaman used to applaud and go
crazy at my dance performance.

678
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:36,250
And today, he just
turned away and left?

679
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:41,390
You always talk about me. Why don't
you say something about yourself?

680
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:47,650
What is there to say about me?
I'm your shadow, nothing more.

681
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:54,100
The pain in your voice reveals that
someone close to you is dead or lost.

682
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:58,880
I wish I could tell you
what I gained and lost.

683
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:03,550
Someone in my childhood made a
promise of love and forgot...

684
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,610
and I kept waiting.

685
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,750
Don't talk about love.

686
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,130
I hate that word.

687
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:36,860
What happened, child?
Did you find Ratan?

688
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,920
Father, he's forgotten me.

689
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:51,440
Child, don't lose hope when
close to your destination.

690
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,940
If he's forgotten, then you have
to rekindle his memories.

691
01:40:56,470 --> 01:41:00,150
But father, the memories of childhood
are erased from his mind.

692
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:03,070
Then you have to get back
his childhood days.

693
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,370
Child, which day is it today?

694
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:17,080
The fair where Ratan was
lost is coming again.

695
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,890
Take him there.
His memory may return.

696
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:32,320
In spite of being close,
he is not close to me

697
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:38,380
Being far away,
I am not far from him

698
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:54,890
Fate, too, doesn't wish two
estranged hearts should unite

699
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:21,370
I could not express
the true feelings of my heart

700
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:40,730
Why does he stay away from me...

701
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:52,900
the one who is close to my heart?

702
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:31,980
Oh my doomed fate, please tell me...

703
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:42,800
how have I wronged?

704
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:52,940
My life should find its destination

705
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:05,020
Don't you wish that,
oh merciless fate?

706
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:27,580
'Greetings, Mrs. Leeladevi...

707
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:31,670
your late husband, Mr. Ashok,
was my childhood friend.

708
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,760
His sudden death has been
a great shock to me.

709
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:38,400
I regret that I did not have
the fortune of meeting you.

710
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:42,980
But, Ashok always spoke
about your love towards him.

711
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:48,150
I've heard that you're commissioning
a statue in his memory.

712
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:53,920
Please accept a small token of
twenty five thousand on my behalf...

713
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:56,970
and give me the opportunity to do
something for this good cause.

714
01:46:57,430 --> 01:47:01,170
Your well wisher,
Dewan Chaman Kumar.'

715
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,420
Twenty five thousand.
Seems to be a very rich man.

716
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:16,500
- Who is he?
- I am hearing his name for the first time.

717
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,340
Must be one of Ashok's friends.

718
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,110
He should be trapped.
Reply to him.

719
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:31,190
'Greetings, Mr. Dewan...

720
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:36,210
I received your letter and
the check for twenty five thousand.

721
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:42,210
My world has crashed
after Ashok's death.

722
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:49,230
I'm wandering like a lost traveler
in the darkness of my life.

723
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:55,500
My husband often
spoke very highly of you.

724
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:04,710
You have set a unique example of
friendship by sending this money.

725
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:08,890
Now, very soon
his statue will be completed.

726
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:16,340
I request you to personally come
and unveil the statue.

727
01:48:17,550 --> 01:48:19,850
I hope you will not disappoint me.

728
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:23,240
Your well wisher, Leeladevi.'

729
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:46,090
- Who is speaking?
- This is Begum Rassily. Ask me why?

730
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:49,910
Rassily, should I call Chaman?

731
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:53,230
No, I'm not interested
in Chaman anymore.

732
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:57,990
Now I intend making Chatpat
my groom as soon as possible.

733
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,970
That's not possible. Listen...

734
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:07,150
I'm going to the fair with Meera.
I'll return by evening.

735
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:10,630
Alright. Ask me why?

736
01:50:17,990 --> 01:50:19,390
All fairs are alike.

737
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,860
I feel I've seen this fair before.

738
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:25,780
Let's go and take a picture.

739
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,960
Life is a story, my friend

740
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:08,030
Everyone narrates their own tales.
This life is a story

741
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:14,570
In this carnival, there are
many princes and princesses

742
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:41,930
A bird migrates
from distant skies...

743
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:50,140
but he does not find a home

744
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:57,170
His eyes are yet under
a spell of darkness

745
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:04,020
A storm has created
a tumult in his life

746
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:10,890
Now his memories have
become an old tale

747
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:40,510
Wait Ashok, don't be silly!

748
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:44,510
You're a married man.

749
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:53,090
Ratan, didn't you call out to me?
Do you remember everything?

750
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:57,660
What do I remember? Who is Ratan?

751
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:03,670
- Didn't you call me?
- I thought you were lost.

752
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:07,430
And I thought, I found you, Ratan!

753
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:43,980
The love of my childhood,
why don't you recognize yourself?

754
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:41,800
Meera, you have come here
late in the night?

755
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:45,170
It's already morning.

756
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:57,180
- What are you writing?
- The script for a drama.

757
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:02,020
- What's the title?
- 'A Tale'.

758
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,480
What's it about?

759
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:13,030
It is a tale of someone's life.

760
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:18,910
Meera, will you help me to act it out?

761
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:22,820
Of course I'll help you.

762
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,650
Life is also a strange game of fate.

763
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:32,360
A man cannot express
what he feels...

764
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:36,420
and whatever he says,
he cannot do it.

765
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:41,560
Is this part of the dialog?

766
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:46,340
Yes, this is a line from my play.

767
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,690
Ask me why?

768
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,740
Chaman, there's a letter for you.

769
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,190
Ask me why?

770
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:56,880
Make your tie this way. I like it.

771
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:00,200
Your speech enchants me.

772
01:59:01,450 --> 01:59:04,040
Leela, wasn't Dewan Chaman
expected to come today?

773
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,500
Here he comes.

774
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,760
The fish has been hooked.
The car is also costly.

775
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:22,190
It must cost twenty thousand.
I'm going. You go and change.

776
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:05,160
Jackie, speechless animals are better
than the ones who can talk.

777
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:10,790
The ones who claimed their love
have become inhumane.

778
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:12,780
Hello.

779
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:16,930
Hello Leeladevi, I am Dewan Chaman.

780
02:00:17,690 --> 02:00:20,200
- Your voice...
- Sounds like Ashok's?

781
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:22,040
Our friends also felt the same.

782
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:38,990
Ashok spoke quite often about you.

783
02:00:40,110 --> 02:00:44,500
He used to say that you and he
were like two hearts and one soul.

784
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,660
You can say we were
one heart and one soul!

785
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:52,850
That's strange. This dog doesn't
let anyone sit close to me...

786
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:55,780
and he's sitting quietly with you.

787
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:59,360
A dog can differentiate
between the good and bad.

788
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:03,250
- My husband also used to say the same.
- Really?

789
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:29,600
The injustice fate has dealt to me
by snatching Ashok from me...

790
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:34,610
will never be known
to you or anyone else.

791
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,720
You are right...

792
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:42,440
but wasting your beauty
and your youth in grief...

793
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:46,050
would be an injustice towards life.

794
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:48,270
Madam, the tea is ready.

795
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:51,470
Let's go.

796
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,300
I'm glad to know that
you share my grief.

797
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:32,860
You're right.
I have the right over my own life.

798
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:37,490
Of course, as long as you were his wife,
you loved him with devotion.

799
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:40,730
Now that you're independent,
you should live your life fully.

800
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:44,220
But, our society won't accept it.

801
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:48,040
How can I defy society all alone?

802
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:52,280
For this you need
a brave companion.

803
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:59,450
- Will you be my companion?
- Who wouldn't want to?

804
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:07,860
I introduce you to Dewan Chaman.

805
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:13,850
He's donated twenty five thousand
to build a memorial for Ashok.

806
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:17,520
This is Mr. Mohan,
Ashok's very close friend.

807
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:21,510
After Ashok's death,
I have only his support.

808
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:26,470
Of course, people like you set
examples of love and devotion.

809
02:03:26,910 --> 02:03:28,560
Thanks for the compliments.

810
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:36,690
Perhaps you're a businessman.

811
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:42,650
Yes, I speculate.
If I'm lucky I win or else I lose.

812
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:46,430
But by your grace, until now,
I've never lost a penny.

813
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:48,590
I am sure it's a matter
of experience.

814
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,680
The prices of stocks have fallen.
Why don't you invest some?

815
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,690
- I've bought five hundreds worth.
- Five hundred?!

816
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:59,010
Yes, if you wish,
I can call up for you.

817
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:02,380
Please go ahead. He is
really a very nice man.

818
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,280
I wish I had met you before.

819
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:10,500
I have the same regret.
I wish I had known you before.

820
02:04:12,110 --> 02:04:16,760
Leela, I came to tell you
the statue is ready to be unveiled.

821
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:56,670
Friends, I knew Judge Ashok
as well as I know myself.

822
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:04,200
In his heart, he had a fondness
for his friend and love for his wife.

823
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:09,110
But, before being a good friend
and a nice husband...

824
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:11,140
he was a justice abiding judge.

825
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:16,070
Therefore, I can say with confidence
that in whichever world he is...

826
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,950
he is looking at you all.

827
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:25,360
Whatever you've done for him
is not hidden from his eyes.

828
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:30,260
It won't be surprising if
such a man is born again...

829
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:32,990
to dispense justice.

830
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:52,680
By making this statue, you've set a
new example of love for your husband.

831
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:59,210
But you cannot spend the rest of
your youth with a lifeless statue.

832
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:06,790
Why do you always hide your
eyes behind those glasses?

833
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:14,190
Leela, these eyes have seen such
cruelty in the world...

834
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,000
that they are ashamed
of being left uncovered.

835
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:22,880
- What is this mystery?
- You won't understand.

836
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:25,870
I won't understand?

837
02:06:34,690 --> 02:06:37,560
- Then who is it?
- A lover.

838
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:40,960
- Whose lover?
- A beautiful maiden's.

839
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:44,120
- Who is she?
- She's the queen of my heart.

840
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:46,970
- I know who.
- Tell me her name.

841
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:51,940
I won't! Wow!
This is so beautiful!

842
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:56,870
Its beauty will be enhanced
when you wear it.

843
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:00,240
- What would be the cost?
- Around twenty thousand.

844
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:05,100
- Twenty thousand?
- This is nothing.

845
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:08,990
I can even get the stars from
the skies to make you happy.

846
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,630
Only you know how to woo a woman.

847
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:20,740
Listen, why don't you come along
with me for a few days?

848
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:24,420
I want to take you away
from this world of sorrows.

849
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:28,680
I would love to come along
but Mohan...

850
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:34,470
- Why should Mohan object?
- He may, because he was Ashok's friend.

851
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:41,520
I was Ashok's friend and, believe me,
I was closer to him...

852
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:43,320
than anyone else, ever.

853
02:07:46,510 --> 02:07:49,950
Keep your tie this way, I like it.

854
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:57,120
Dewan, I feel like
kissing your hand!

855
02:07:57,490 --> 02:08:00,080
I had a profit of fifty thousand.

856
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:05,810
Don't embarrass me.
I didn't do anything great.

857
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:08,550
The more you invest,
the more you'll make.

858
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:11,550
I've invested all my wealth.
If you do the same...

859
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:13,960
- you'll become a millionaire.
- A millionare?

860
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,110
Then I'll also invest everything!

861
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:21,470
Mohan, I'm taking Leela
along with me for a few days.

862
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:22,960
She'll get a change.

863
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:25,390
Please take her.
It's a very good idea!

864
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:28,720
If I didn't have to manage my
business, I'd also come along.

865
02:08:29,370 --> 02:08:31,700
Someday, you'll have to
come with me, Mohan.

866
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:33,100
I'll surely come.

867
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:40,060
'A Tale'. Chaman has created
a very good name for his new drama.

868
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:42,790
But, I have no role
in this play. Ask me why?

869
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:44,980
Then why don't you find
a part for yourself?

870
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:48,970
What's the use of a play wherein
I don't have to ask 'why' even once?

871
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:52,540
Tell me, will you enjoy
watching a play without me?

872
02:08:52,990 --> 02:08:57,030
Meeradevi, 'ask me why'
fits in every line.

873
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,700
Let me explain.

874
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:08,360
The heroine very coyly
asks her hero...

875
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:12,660
'why do you love me'?
What should the hero answer?

876
02:09:12,900 --> 02:09:16,470
- Ask me why?
- That's right!

877
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:19,470
Now, when the villain
abducts the heroine...

878
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:23,980
at that time, what should
the comedian tell his wife?

879
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:28,270
- Ask me why?
- You said it.

880
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:33,020
This a phrase without which Kalidas's
and Shakespeare's plays are incomplete.

881
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:35,910
Then how can Chaman's
play be successful?

882
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:37,240
Ask me why?

883
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,890
Meera, this is Leeladevi.

884
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:57,990
- And she?
- She is Meeradevi, my neighbor.

885
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:01,580
You seem to have quite
an interesting neighborhood.

886
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:07,910
Let's go.

887
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:19,890
The injury has broken
my fragile heart

888
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:32,210
There's no one in this world
who'll listen to my tale of woe

889
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:58,270
The one whom I have remembered
and spent my days...

890
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:26,570
today he has spurned
the love of my heart

891
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:04,750
I cannot lament and complain,
for I've seen the result of love

892
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:32,820
My love has perished
in the fire burning within me

893
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:01,220
I'm sorry I had to leave
suddenly the other day.

894
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:05,540
- I couldn't even meet you.
- I didn't complain.

895
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:09,670
But, I should have
informed you before leaving.

896
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:20,530
- Your Leeladevi is calling you.
- I came here to talk about her.

897
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:24,160
I've written that play
to perform it before Leeladevi.

898
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:27,800
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

899
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:31,870
Whenever she's ready, the play
will be presented for her.

900
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:38,150
Alright, I'll see you later.

901
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:04,210
This is Dewan Chaman speaking.
What's the price of silver?

902
02:15:04,970 --> 02:15:07,930
It's fallen?
Alright, sell off all I have.

903
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:09,740
Yes, sell everything.

904
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:13,720
So what if the market crashes?
Do as I say.

905
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:18,140
I want the market to crash.
Everyone should be doomed.

906
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:23,290
I don't mind if I suffer a loss.
You sell it.

907
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:31,530
I have stopped business
and started speculation.

908
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:34,830
If I am lucky I gain,
or else I lose everything.

909
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:39,980
But, by your grace,
I haven't suffered any losses yet.

910
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:43,670
I invested twenty thousand and
I'm ahead by fifty thousand now.

911
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:50,810
I've invested everything and by
evening, I'll become a millionaire.

912
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:01,700
Yes, Sir Mohanlal speaking.

913
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:05,820
What's the price?
The market's crashed?

914
02:16:06,910 --> 02:16:10,750
What are you saying?
Everyone's taken losses?

915
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:14,070
Dewan Chaman sold off everything?

916
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:21,260
But, Dewan Chaman, I am destroyed!

917
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:25,830
This is how speculation is.

918
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:40,390
Dewan Chaman sold everything?

919
02:17:39,559 --> 02:17:43,539
- Leela speaking.
- Leela, where's that rascal, Chaman?

920
02:17:44,059 --> 02:17:46,129
What is the matter, Mohan?

921
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:49,340
That rascal has ruined me!

922
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:51,650
He's destroyed me completely.

923
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:56,150
I've become a pauper.
That rogue cheated me!

924
02:17:56,740 --> 02:18:00,950
He ruined me in speculation and
has even taken you away from me.

925
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,850
He took me away?

926
02:18:05,459 --> 02:18:09,489
- I never belonged to you!
- Wretched woman! Is this your love?

927
02:18:09,990 --> 02:18:17,950
You're teaching fidelity to
a woman who was never faithful?

928
02:18:18,459 --> 02:18:22,929
Don't rub salt on my wounds or
you'll be responsible for my death!

929
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:26,320
Go ahead.
I'll raise a statue in your memory, too!

930
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:33,990
How I wish I seen
your true colors earlier.

931
02:18:56,900 --> 02:19:00,250
Mohan always thought
that I loved him.

932
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:04,240
But, I...

933
02:19:07,889 --> 02:19:10,419
Aren't we going
to the theater today?

934
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:14,850
No Leela, you go. I have to
attend something important today.

935
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:41,910
Welcome Mohan.
I've been waiting for you.

936
02:19:44,209 --> 02:19:47,969
Didn't I say someday
you'd have to come here?

937
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:53,180
Let me see how long you can
laugh after destroying me.

938
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:59,110
You can't laugh anymore!
You cheat, cad, rogue!

939
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:02,820
You called me your friend and
swindled me, tried to crush me?

940
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:10,120
You scoundrel. You destroyed me
and even snatched my girlfriend?

941
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:13,340
But, you don't know me very well.

942
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:20,280
And you don't know me well,
either, Mohan.

943
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:26,380
I just snatched your girlfriend,
but you snatched my life.

944
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,340
Stop this nonsense!

945
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:39,870
Yes Ashok! Cheat, cad, rogue.

946
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:46,340
I'm the one who destroyed you.
I'm the one who tried to crush you.

947
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,110
And you?
You were honest and faithful.

948
02:20:53,070 --> 02:20:56,580
Shameless friend? If you came
here to kill me then go ahead.

949
02:20:58,100 --> 02:21:03,990
- No, Ashok!
- You're disloyal and a coward too!

950
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,890
Get out of here!

951
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:16,290
Please forgive me, Ashok. I have
committed an unpardonable sin!

952
02:21:17,830 --> 02:21:20,340
My life is a blot on humanity.

953
02:21:21,190 --> 02:21:27,200
Please wipe out this stigma, Ashok.
Only my death can atone for my sins.

954
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:43,650
Punishing you would be piling
injustice upon injustice.

955
02:21:44,770 --> 02:21:47,270
Go away, I forgive you.

956
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:53,310
Your crime is your punishment.

957
02:22:42,450 --> 02:22:44,690
Conferring justice is
a difficult task, oh God.

958
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:48,910
I leave his verdict in your hands.

959
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,300
You are here?

960
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:31,800
Why are you fond
of this place, Meera?

961
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:38,550
I spent my childhood days here.
Now I come here and think of those days.

962
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:43,020
But, who is the prince
of your dreams?

963
02:23:44,020 --> 02:23:47,610
He is someone who, like you,
has forgotten his past.

964
02:23:48,490 --> 02:23:54,690
I spent my childhood with him.
Now only momeries of him remain.

965
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,840
- Did he leave you?
- No.

966
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:03,000
The course of destiny separated
him from me in our childhood.

967
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:05,820
Didn't he ever return?

968
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:10,620
A fresh whiff of destiny
did bring him back...

969
02:24:11,710 --> 02:24:13,280
but he couldn't belong to me.

970
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,480
Why?

971
02:24:16,830 --> 02:24:22,370
Sometimes, when you're close to your
destination, it goes far from you.

972
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:24,710
Don't give up hope, Meera.

973
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:28,870
One should never
give up on hope. I...

974
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:34,340
Unfortunately, along with
the childhood memories...

975
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:37,930
he has entrusted his love
to someone else.

976
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:42,070
- He really is merciless.
- You are very merciless.

977
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:45,220
I've been looking for you everywhere
and you're standing here?

978
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,970
It's time for the play.
Aren't we going?

979
02:24:53,770 --> 02:24:58,040
Meeradevi, why don't you come along?
You're going there anyway.

980
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:01,990
Yes Leeladevi, I'll be there.

981
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:44,330
Friends, today we present
a new dance drama, 'A Tale'.

982
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:49,560
This drama has been written
by the owner of this theater.

983
02:25:50,810 --> 02:25:57,230
The writer says this tale
is based on a true story.

984
02:25:58,410 --> 02:26:01,440
We hope that you all
will like this play.

985
02:31:36,870 --> 02:31:40,410
No, Ratan, your Ratan.

986
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:43,040
Your childhood companion.

987
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:55,640
My Ratan, finally you've
remembered everything.

988
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:04,080
- Thanks for taking me to the fair.
- You remembered everything there?

989
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:06,200
But, you said you weren't Ratan.

990
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:12,790
- I was helpless, Meera.
- Ratan, you've remembered your Meera.

991
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:15,640
Oh Ratan, my life is complete
now you're back.

992
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:22,010
- Not yet, Meera.
- Why not? I won't let you go.

993
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:32,770
- Oh! It's because of Leela?
- Yes, Leela is my wife.

994
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:37,720
- Wife?
- This play is my life's story.

995
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:43,740
- You still didn't understand?
- I did. You performed the drama.

996
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:46,030
- The play was performed for Leela.
- And now?

997
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,100
Now I'll have to hope for justice.

998
02:32:54,350 --> 02:32:56,580
These capsules will decide
between truth and deceit.

999
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:59,910
One contains poison
and the other is empty.

1000
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:03,070
One she will consume
and the other, I will.

1001
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:08,280
God will confer justice.
If I live, I'll return to you.

1002
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:13,880
- And if I die...
- No Ratan, I won't let you go.

1003
02:33:14,630 --> 02:33:18,010
I've waited for a long time.
You owe some justice to me, too.

1004
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:21,350
Forget your past life.

1005
02:33:22,190 --> 02:33:26,230
How can I, Meera? A husband can
forget his wife's mistakes...

1006
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,370
but how can a judge pardon
a criminal's offense?

1007
02:33:30,620 --> 02:33:36,870
Justice will be served,
not for me but for society.

1008
02:33:39,530 --> 02:33:44,250
Don't go Ratan, We'll begin
a new life away from society.

1009
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:46,690
We aren't concerned
with this world.

1010
02:33:48,170 --> 02:33:52,500
We may not be concerned,
but this world is concerned with us.

1011
02:33:53,450 --> 02:33:55,470
The wheel of justice
has to keep moving.

1012
02:33:56,450 --> 02:34:00,690
Smile and allow me to go
and fulfill my duties, Meera.

1013
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:05,140
If this is what you want,
then go, Ratan..

1014
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:09,770
I waited long enough for you.
I'll wait some more.

1015
02:35:08,990 --> 02:35:12,130
Come Ashok.
Why did you return late?

1016
02:35:15,030 --> 02:35:18,380
You recognized me. That's nice.

1017
02:35:20,220 --> 02:35:21,730
It'll make my work easier.

1018
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:26,980
I saw the drama.

1019
02:35:28,970 --> 02:35:34,510
- Did you like it?
- I liked it a lot.

1020
02:35:36,150 --> 02:35:40,310
Now announce a punishment
for me too.

1021
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:49,490
I am nobody to punish you.
God will decide our fate.

1022
02:35:54,970 --> 02:36:00,760
One of these two capsules contains
poison. The other is empty.

1023
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:07,090
One you eat, the other I'll eat.
God will decide our destiny.

1024
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:13,230
But, why should you take one?
You're being lenient towards me?

1025
02:36:14,890 --> 02:36:16,490
This is no justice, your honor.

1026
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:21,740
At this moment I'm not a judge.
I'm a petitioner in the court of God.

1027
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,450
He will confer justice today.

1028
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:52,960
Leela, what have you done??

1029
02:36:59,690 --> 02:37:01,190
Why did you do that, Leela?

1030
02:37:02,030 --> 02:37:06,050
I should have done this long ago.

1031
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:09,100
I had already...

1032
02:37:12,590 --> 02:37:15,190
- Leela, you had...
- Say no more, Ashok.

1033
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:17,970
Please let me talk.

1034
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:22,070
I will not apologize to you.

1035
02:37:22,970 --> 02:37:25,260
My offense can't be erased
by your forgiveness.

1036
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:29,940
I should be apologizing to
the women of my country...

1037
02:37:30,820 --> 02:37:35,080
who are known to be
very devoted to their husbands.

1038
02:37:36,090 --> 02:37:40,830
I have tainted
the image of that love.

1039
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:44,760
My death, too,
can't atone for this sin!

1040
02:37:48,330 --> 02:37:52,320
I wonder how many ill-fated
women like me exist...

1041
02:37:53,370 --> 02:38:01,370
who, for a few rupees and some gold,
spurn the love of their husband?

1042
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:10,790
If my painful end can bring any one
such strayed woman back on her path...

1043
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:16,990
then I will think that
my death was not a waste.

1044
02:38:19,410 --> 02:38:22,730
Ashok, you're not a mere
human being. You are like God.

1045
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:30,990
I'm fortunate that in spite of being
so vile, I am dying at your feet.

1046
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:36,300
If possible, please pardon me.

1047
02:39:21,910 --> 02:39:27,230
Should I consider this as
God's justice or a man's vengeance?

1048
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:59,340
The result of a good deed
is always good...

1049
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:04,750
and the result of
a bad deed is bad

1050
02:40:07,050 --> 02:40:15,050
This is the law of nature.
No one can change the course of fate
