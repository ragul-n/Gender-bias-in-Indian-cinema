'Trisha'

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,120
Move aside

'Anjali'

11
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,760
What's the matter, sir?

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
2 of you go in there and check

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
See if he is inside

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
An 'accused' is locked inside
and refusing to open, sir

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,640
Move, man

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
Give it to me

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Hold this

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,920
Follow me

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
In my service, I have never
seen such a forgery case

20
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,760
He'll be behind bars
minimum 3 to 5 years

21
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,760
He has been charged
of kidnap and rape also

22
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,440
He'll serve jail time
at least 7 years

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Not only that

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
Attempted murder also

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,280
That's another 10 years in prison

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
Plus he has 12 cases against him

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,920
If he is prosecuted
for all these cases...

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
...he'll be in for life

29
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,600
Head constable,
to adjudge his cases...

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,640
...a special court may be set up

31
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,880
Higher officials
are debating on it

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,160
'This is our hero'

- Good morning

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
Please take a seat

39
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,000
In the wine shop
near our temple...

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,080
...I believe boys are getting drunk
and misbehaving with girls

41
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Our folks have complained
about them creating a ruckus

42
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,000
I've already complained
5-6 times about this to you

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
You haven't taken
any action so far

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,880
Now I'm submitting
this complaint once more

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
If you don't take action on this...

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
...I'll be forced to
complain to the collector

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm meeting the collector
in the next few days

48
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,320
I will definitely
discuss this with him

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,840
Once he okays it...

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,600
...the concerned officers
will shut down the wine shop

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,520
It's only because I still have
faith in you, I'm talking to you

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
Please do the needful

53
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,560
Sir, so you intend talking
to the collector about this?

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Yov! This is the only wine shop
that hits a lottery in our town

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
If we shut this down,
who will answer the Govt?!

56
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
Politicians will keep complaining
to be in the good books of the people

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,960
How can we waste
our time over all that?

(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,120
Who is he?

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,440
Piss drunk near the temple
and fighting with passers-by

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Ask him to clear out

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Move out of the way

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
Drunk and making trouble?

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Tahsildar is in the car
Behave yourself

66
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,280
Get lost!

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
How dare you-

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,480
You said Tahsildar is inside

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,360
I can see only a tutti-fruity!

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
- Get out, di
- Hey! Back off

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,800
- Get out of the car
- Let go of her

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,120
Listen to me

73
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Let go of me

74
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,560
Keep quiet and come along

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,400
How dare you mess
with my own daughter?

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
If I set my mind to it
I'll make you count bars now

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
If I make up my mind
I'll take her right now

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,040
Get lost!

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Let me go

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,320
Hey! Don't try to resist

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Adjust and give in

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,560
I'm telling you
not to fight

83
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
Don't you understand?

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,080
Sir, when it comes to your daughter
you don't think twice to kill, right?

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,440
Ditto with me

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,360
If my father has a problem, I can't
sit quiet and twiddle my thumbs

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,200
My father has complained thrice
to close the wine shop

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
And even protested 4 times

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
You don't want to
take any action

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll go any extent to
fulfill my father's wishes

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Now it's your call

92
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,480
Whether this wine shop
should be open or closed

93
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,680
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560

shifted to Venkateswara Nagar'

...only you can carry off
this khadi shirt so well

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,280
More than this pot of cold water
your words refresh me a lot, dear

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
My name is not 'dear'

101
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
I am Chellamma

102
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,120
That's what I said
in an endearing way!

103
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,480
Cheer up, dear

"Over brimming with sin
in angel's domain"

105
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,640
Useless fellow! Thinks
he's God's gift to mankind

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,240
Stupid thing! Forever loud
and bringing the roof down

107
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,240
Kick the tape recorder
to your foot's content!

108
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,160
But you can't break my record

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,200
He and his silly shorts!

110
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,200
Disgrace to our family

111
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Get my 'veshti'

112
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
Serve tea for everybody here

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,920
Boss, you're selling tea and
fritters next to our party office

114
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,080
The opposition camp
is taking a dig at us happily

115
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
Shall we run a brothel instead?

116
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
- Soooper idea!
- You'll get it from my slipper!

117
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,480
Hey! Is running a tea shop
beneath your dignity?

118
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,440
Boss...boss

119
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Why is our fighter running
like his pants on fire?

120
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
Boss, you're sitting jobless
and cracking nuts here

121
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,680
He has shut down
the wine shop near the temple

122
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,920
And buttering up the public

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
We should think and decide
what we should close down

124
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
Party office maybe

125
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
What?

126
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,840
You keep asking us
to think always

127
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
You should also
use your gray cells

128
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,680
One who thinks and voices
his opinion is not a leader

129
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,200
One who voices the thought
of another is a leader

130
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,160
My dear chap is thinking
on a real large scale

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,120
He'll go places for sure
in the near future

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Yes, boss

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Hey! Gym-body!
What are you thinking?

134
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,320
If 'vadas' are left over
we make 'vadacurry' with it

135
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,000
If 'bhajjis' are left over
what can we do?

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,080
What can we do?

137
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Shall I pack them home?

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,600
You weren't thinking of my party

139
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,120
But how to take away
left over fritters from my shop

140
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,920
Eating like a hog and bloating
like the collection box in Tirupati

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,400
All I ask is an idea for
developing my party-

142
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
I have an idea, boss

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
What?

144
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
He earned a good name
closing that wine shop

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,440
Close the wine shop
next to the school

146
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,520
- You get your votes
- Very good idea

147
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
Now that you've told me this
wait and watch my next move

148
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Students, come this side

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
Don't go over there

150
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,120
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
Boss, this is the shop

152
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,280
These coolers confused me

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
Bro...?

154
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,160
- Me?
- Come here

155
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,360
How will school kids pass with
a wine shop facing their class?

156
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
You had better close down

157
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Is this some bunk shop?

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,520
You take turns in
asking me to close shop

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
I've just now shifted from
the temple to this venue

160
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,960
If any of you open your mouth
once more, I'll skin you alive

161
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,480
- Clear out now
- Yes, sir

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank God, boss
Your glasses are intact

163
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960
My cheek is red and swollen

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,920
And you're bothered
about my coolers

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,680
If he says, they agree

166
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
If I say the same
they get angry

167
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,440
Why should we fight
with the Govt directly?

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,400
There shouldn't be a wine shop
next to the school, right?

169
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,040
We'll close down the school!

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,080
Wonderful idea

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
Votes from drunkards
are increasing day by day

172
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Boss, shall I throw
each kid outside?

173
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
It will take one week,
is that okay?

174
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
Brawn like an elephant
Brain less than a cat

175
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,920
I'll bring out all the kids
in a minute, just watch

176
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
Give it to me

177
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
- Come on, boys
- Okay, boss

178
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Hey! Stop

179
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Think you can come in a group
and close down the school?

180
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,120
Why did you ring the school bell?

181
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,600
You're running a school
opposite a wine shop

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,440
How can drunkards
drink in peace?

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Isn't this a disturbance?
That's why I rang the bell

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,720
Close down the school
and go home soon

185
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
You'll support drunkards
and close down our school

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
You got any brains?

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,040
Beat him to a pulp

188
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
Call the police

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,120
You'll escape promptly
when I am being hit!

190
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,160
How did you enter
on the dot after their exit?

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
We have gun timing sense

192
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
Your sense of timing is none!

193
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,840
'Dear friends, for my sake
if you resort to vandalizing shops...'

194
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
'...none of you should steal'

195
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
Take care, boss

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,160
Till our boss gets back
I will rule the roost

197
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,240
He ate, sir

198
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Ate, huh?

199
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,640
Give him food

200
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Your turn now

201
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
What?

202
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,840
Chairman's son is here to see you

203
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,000
Good afternoon, sir

204
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Good afternoon

205
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,960
What is it?

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
You've been transferred
to our area now, right?

207
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
My father asked me to greet you,
garland you and hand over a petition

208
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
Why all this formality?

209
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
Our pleasure, sir

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Hold this

211
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
Give me the petition

212
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
My profession takes
priority over garlands

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,400
Rowdies rule the market

214
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
Please keep an eye on them

215
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,480
That's our request

216
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Don't worry
I'm here now

217
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,240
I'll take care of every single
scumbag and rowdy

218
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,600
If you know any jobless jerks
plus their useless factions...

219
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,320
...tell me, I'll shoot them down

220
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,240
They are the ones
who are trouble makers

221
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Disturbing the public
And the police too

222
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,320
Don't get stressed

223
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
Even if you have
a bald spot, it's okay

224
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
But you're completely bald

225
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,400
It's okay if everyone
is responsible like you

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
But they are unruly rowdies

227
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,760
He has also eaten, sir

228
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,800
I have a small job to do

229
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll be back soon

230
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
- What?
- Come here

231
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Why does this inspector
get so hyper?

232
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,680
That's why every 6 months
he is transferred to a different area

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,720
1 hour since he took charge
and he has beaten up 20 men

234
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
If he removes his false moustache
he'll beat everyone black and blue

235
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,040
You leave now, bro

236
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,560
This is for your tea expenses

237
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,440
Let's go

238
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,440
What?

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,880
Did you come to garland
the inspector and grease his palm?

240
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
I came to hand over my petition

241
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
A good politician...

242
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
...should stop the rail
and break the jail

243
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
Instead you hand over petitions

244
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
I feel ashamed to
call you my enemy

245
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
I feel the same, ditto

246
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,880
To encounter your counter
I don't have a date now

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,840
I have a meeting
with the inspector

248
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,840
Bye, enemy

249
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,600
What?

250
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Hey-

251
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,600
Why is this nutcase
calling me his enemy?

252
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,920
This is what he is going
around telling everyone

253
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Is that so?

254
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
Shouldn't I show him
true colors of his enemy?

255
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,240
Who is this?

256
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,880
Who I am is not important

257
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,760
How dare you detain
our leader in your police station?

258
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,320
Who is your party leader?

259
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,160
The one sitting in front of you

260
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,920
Dark skinned and clad
in white head to toe

261
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,920
He's a fierce lion
And a frenzied cheetah

262
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,760
An enraged elephant
who cannot be controlled

263
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,720
In the same tip top
condition he entered...

264
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
...send him out
the same way

265
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,840
If you lay your hand on him-

266
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
1 minute

267
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Tell me

268
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,440
You had the audacity to lay
your hand on our party leader

269
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,320
1 minute, da

270
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I'll wait, da

271
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
'No, I will not'

272
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
Come here

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,760
'God knows what
he'll do to me now'

274
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
Now I even kicked him
with my foot

275
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
What will you do?

276
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,760
If we see even 1 drop
of blood from his body...

277
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
...a bloody river will
flow in your station

278
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
Not just 1 drop

279
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll make him shed
1 liter of blood

280
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,720
Hold on

281
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Don't...don't...don't
do anything to him

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,440
It will take an hour
for us to get the body

283
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,920
Let's drink a glass of hot tea

284
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,360
How about something cooler?

285
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,240
Will do

286
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,520
'Gawd! Monkey!'

287
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Don't...don't...don't

288
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,960
'What did I do for him to go
hammer and tongs at me?'

289
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,080
If you roam around in the name of
party, faction, I'll shoot you down

290
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
I swear!

291
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,640
'What party did I lead?'

292
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,760
Bro, here's your shirt

293
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,200
This isn't mine

294
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,200
I wore a white shirt

295
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,040
Bring mine

296
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
This was white

297
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,480
It turned red when
you got beaten up

298
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,200
'Looks like the yesteryear hero
Ramarajan's vivid red shirt!'

299
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,920
Where is my 'veshti'?

300
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,240
Sorry, we couldn't save it

301
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
You wasted my 'veshti'

302
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,400
And whacked me too

303
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
What's that egghead called?

304
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,320
Why get into further trouble?

305
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
Get los-

306
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I don't know
why he thrashed me

307
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
If I don't even know his name
it's a total disgrace

308
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,040
You don't know
about our leader

309
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,680
By now he would have made
all the cops quiver and shiver!

310
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,760
We should erect a huge banner
'Lion-king who went to prison'

311
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,400
They're talking with no idea of
the tornado of blows that hit me

312
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,200
Then people will know
our leader's worth!

313
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,480
Boss...?

314
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,800
Did you ditch us and celebrate
'holi' festival with the inspector?

315
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,480
He butchered me
into this unholy mess

316
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,880
And you think I sprayed
'holi' colors on that chap!

317
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,120
Did the inspector hit you?

318
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,200
We won't let him go scot-free

319
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,200
If you go inside
he won't let you go scot-free

320
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,120
He isn't our enemy

321
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,960
Then who?

322
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,960
He got a call from someone

323
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,480
Only after that phone call...

324
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
...he saw red and pounced
covering me in blood red

325
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,320
I was the caller, dumbbell

326
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Look how 1 call from me is ample
to get your limbs broken multiple!

327
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,320
In politics, we can
compete and win

328
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,280
But not blow the whistle
like a weasel!

329
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Don't stab an enemy on his back

330
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,120
Face him and fight

331
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,520
If you have the guts...

332
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,800
...use your fist
on our leader's face

333
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,680
Your brother's a bloody big shot!

334
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,560
Enough?

335
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,440
Enough, bro

336
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,360
Why did you ask him
to hit me face to face?

337
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,360
How can I alone not speak
any punch-line dialog?!

338
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Should I be punched
for your punch line?

339
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,040
You're hitting me
while I'm talking to you?

340
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,840
You have no guts
to confront me

341
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,240
You call yourself my enemy!

342
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
I think of you as my enemy

343
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
I'll contest against you
in the coming election

344
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,840
First stand upright

345
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then you can contest me

346
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,920
Let's go

347
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,520
He has damaged
your public image

348
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
My image may be damaged

349
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,440
I know how to set it right

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,360
I'll call the siren
Shakeela tomorrow-

351
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,320
Call us for a binge-

352
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,440
You won't even
come up to her hip!

353
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll call Shakeela and arrange
a variety entertainment for all

354
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,520
I'll make it a rip roaring success

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
What dress do you think
Shakeela will be wearing?

356
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
She looks good
only in her birthday suit

357
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,720
What can you do hand-cuffed?

358
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,920
Mother, I don't want a sword

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
Your words will do

360
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,520
I don't want an army

361
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,560
If you don't object
that's enough for me

362
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,560
Freedom for you, me, everyone

363
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,480
My dearest son,
to aid your father...

364
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,280
...I tied your brave wrists

365
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
Manohara, don't be
patient any longer

366
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
Rise and shine

367
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,320
Mother...!

368
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,120
Stop it

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
You bloody blockheads!

370
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,600
Shakeela looks lovely
in her skimpy dress only

371
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,240
You've covered her
from head to toe

372
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,240
Discarded debris!

373
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,160
Aiyo!

374
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Look over there

375
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
There's a soooper
glam-doll dancing

376
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,560
Let's go watch that

377
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,800
Come back all of you

378
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,760
I spent a lot to bring
Shakeela all the way here

379
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,240
Didn't I tell you, my fans
like me only if I do a skin-show!

380
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
I don't like covering myself like this

381
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,360
Neither do my fans

382
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,360
"Beloved beau! Listen
I've been to parties zillion"

383
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,040
"I've danced, center of attraction"

384
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,160
"But I haven't seen
such a party scene"

385
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,280
"No one can dance like me
Ever so gracefully"

386
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,000
"This is a hit song's prelude
A hit song to hum, dude"

387
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,840
"Love, join me
Let's jive joyously"

388
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,560
"I'm worth more, I say
than 5 or 10 paise"

389
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,000
"Like a crow
heave me ho!"

390
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,800
"You will be mine
for 24 hours time"

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
"Sing a rhyme, ask the moon
to land on earth soon"

392
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
"We'll follow you
wherever you go"

393
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,000
"Let's all zero in
on a honeymoon"

394
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,680
"Like India's map, look at my shape
you'll fall too with your mouth agape"

395
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,400
"Like a foreigner, you'll do your job
You'll also make our jaw line drop"

396
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,440
"Like a red sanders tree
you stand firm and sturdy"

397
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,720
"You broke all hearts in a jiffy"

398
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,680
"Hit song's interlude, sweet
A hit song to tap your feet"

399
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,840
"Sweetheart, step in with me
To swing, sway or shimmy"

400
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,560
"Hit song interlude, lover boy
A hit song to dance and enjoy"

401
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,720
"Love, dance with me
Let's make a rhapsody"

402
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,960
"I'm worth more, I say
than 5 or 10 paise"

403
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,440
"Like a crow peck me
lift me effortlessly"

404
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,400
"You'll be mine
24 hours time"

405
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,680
"Girl, your beauty
ravishes me totally"

406
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,560
"Crime rate I understand
has gone out of hand"

407
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
"For giving birth to
a Miss world new"

408
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,880
"My parents are to blame
is the name of this game"

409
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,040
"I'm trying to spread like a mat
your 'dupatta' to sleep on that"

410
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,400
"I felt so giddy
seeing your gym-body"

411
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
"My wish and prayer
to be your pair"

412
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,240
"Your body like glass
I saw, shining it was"

413
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,600
"In that small gap
I fell into your trap"

414
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,440
"Like a red sanders tree
you stand hale and hearty"

415
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,880
"You broke all hearts in a jiffy"

416
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,600
"Hit song postlude, darling
A hit song for dancing"

417
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,360
"Love, shake your body
Let's make a rhapsody"

418
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,640
"Hit song's postlude, glam doll
A hit song to enthrall all"

419
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,400
"Temptress, sensuous steamy
Twist, twirl and hit on me"

420
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,240
"My beloved"

421
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,720
"My betrothed"

422
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,080
"A-b-c-d is a baby's raga"

423
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,800
"This babe has an aura
Bid her bye, sayonara"

424
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,680
"Wave tata, alweda"

425
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,400
"A-b-c-d
Rhyme for a baby"

426
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,040
"This babe has attitude
Wave goodbye, dude"

427
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
"Wave tata to this temptress"

428
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,600
"Namaste, Miss Gorgeous"

429
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,160
"A-b-c-d
Tiny tots' poetry"

430
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,640
"This girl's a charmer
Bid her au revoir"

431
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,800
"Tata, velli vostanu"

432
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
"pOitu varaen, see you"

433
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Swami, I want my new scooter
sanctified, please come soon

434
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,040
Please wait

435
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,280
I'll finish my prayer and come

436
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,800
You pray to God daily anyway

437
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,280
Come and sanctify my vehicle

438
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,120
Auspicious time lasts
only for 5 more minutes

439
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,760
If we offer our prayers
5 minutes later...

440
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,120
...will someone steal your bike?

441
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,800
Wait

442
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,040
'Someone is snooping
around your scooter'

443
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,840
Thief...thief!

444
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,760
May your jinxed tongue
be burnt with camphor!

445
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,840
He hardly said it out loud

446
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,280
And this thief stole my scooty

447
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,120
Someone catch him

448
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,440
My new scooty

449
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,760
Write down model and
the number of your vehicle

450
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Sir, I haven't got
the number as yet

451
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,160
I got it only today
from the showroom

452
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,400
It's a new scooty

453
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,160
It's tough to find a stolen vehicle
even if we know the number

454
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,680
How will we find a scooty
without a number?

455
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,800
We'll do our best

456
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Sir...?

457
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,760
There's no sugar in this tea

458
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,640
You drank the tea meant for me

459
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,560
And you're complaining
about the sugar!

460
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,240
Sir, solve your tea problem later

461
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,600
First find my scooty for me

462
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,440
Oh! Is it that urgent?

463
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,600
Lodge a complaint and
you also go and look for it

464
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,600
If you see it somewhere,
inform me and I'll get it for you

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,280
Go and search

466
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,000
Let's go

467
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
Change the seat cover

468
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
Also the handgrip

469
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,280
Hey! Look at that mechanic shop

470
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,200
Bro, give it a whole new look

471
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,800
Okay, bro

472
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,840
Also change the horn
I want it to be unique

473
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,520
Done, bro

474
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,240
Isn't that your bike?

475
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes, you're right

476
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Go and check

477
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Also put my name Seenu
Bold and fancy letters

478
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,560
- Take a good look
- Do you know her?

479
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
After the extra fittings
it will be even better

480
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,600
Who are you to add
extra fitting to my scooty?

481
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
Hello, it's mine

482
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,640
Do you have any proof
it belongs to you?

483
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
It has sandalwood paste
and vermilion on it

484
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,760
So does that make it yours?

485
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,760
Move aside

486
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,000
You stole my vehicle and
speaking with such arrogance

487
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,920
How dare you
try to hit a girl?

488
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,480
When she hit me
nobody came to defend me

489
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Now you'll come to her rescue

490
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,160
Aren't you ashamed to
show off your guts to a girl?

491
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
All of you will support a girl

492
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,040
My brother-in-law will come to
my aid too, I'll call him

493
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,240
Hey dude, they hit me
and also took my bike

494
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,640
- Where?
- Market

495
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,200
I'll be there in 5 minutes

496
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,040
Move aside

497
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Check if all the parts are intact

498
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
Who hit you?

499
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
Wipe your eyes...tell me

500
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Should I make the chap
who hit you sob nonstop?

501
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
Or should I make him
fall at your feet?

502
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Tell me
Who is it?

503
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,200
- Check if it can be started
- That's what I'm doing

504
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,000
Where?

505
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,000
Punch, dude...punch

506
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,000
If I ask you to punch her
why are you hitting me?

507
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,400
Beautiful girls should only
be admired, not punched

508
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,880
Sir, you seem to be
a very nice person

509
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Go on

510
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,680
This 'Kumki' elephant stole
my scooty yesterday from the temple

511
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,520
Make him return it, sir

512
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,680
What is your name?

513
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,480
Anjali

514
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
All yours, please take it

515
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,800
Sir, he grabbed the key

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,480
Hey! Give her the key

517
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,720
I can't give
my bike to anyone

518
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,000
Listen to me

519
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,400
Bloody thief!

520
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,560
Here you are
You can go

521
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,320
Disperse...go about your work

522
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,280
You got away now

523
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,560
But wherever you go
I'll take back my bike for sure

524
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,920
When I'm right here,
you got the audacity to retort?

525
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,720
Anjali, if he creates
any trouble for you...

526
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,560
...note down
my phone number

527
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,720
I've saved it

528
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,640
See you

529
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,640
My phone will be
switched on all the time

530
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,480
You can call me anytime

531
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,520
Sir, please let go of me

532
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,040
Sir, don't thrash me

533
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,840
I believe you wanted to see me

534
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Yes, I did

535
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,800
He's the one
who stole your bike

536
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,360
He isn't the chap

537
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,280
I found the person
who stole my scooty

538
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
And I got it back

539
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,920
Then whose vehicle
did you steal?

540
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,160
I stole it from her

541
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,720
Hey madcap! I stole the bike
from right under your nose

542
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,040
I stole it and
I'm accepting it

543
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,440
And you're trying to get me
into trouble with the police?

544
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,240
Don't lie

545
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,680
If you have any doubt, show her
the bike you seized from me

546
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,640
Is this your scooty?

547
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
Hey! This is your bike

548
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,600
You can even see
the sanctified thread

549
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
Yes, you're right

550
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
Hello, this is Anjali here

551
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
'I'll be right there'

552
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,760
Because you called, I dropped
all my work and came at once

553
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,520
Minor confusion

554
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,760
It is your friend's bike

555
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,360
The police found mine

556
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,400
I believe your lost bike
has been found!

557
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
When did my bike go missing?

558
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,960
You grabbed it from me
and gave it to her

559
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,840
Take it in writing from them
that her bike has been found

560
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,480
Thanks a lot

561
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,680
As soon as I asked, you gave
your friend's bike to me readily

562
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,360
If you ask something
why just this bike?

563
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,720
I can give you my life

564
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,320
What?

565
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,000
I said I would've taken risks
in life and retrieved your bike

566
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,360
'This is love for sure'

567
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Bro, your girl is buying
fruits in that shop

568
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,480
Let's also buy some fruits

569
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,160
Shouldn't go fruit shopping
and get dumped by her!

570
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,440
First watch your target
without her knowledge

571
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,120
And then bravely make it obvious

572
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
If you watch her from here
she'll go miles away from you

573
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,280
How much is the apple?

574
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,520
An apple wants to know
an apple's price?

575
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
It isn't funny at all

576
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,360
How much is 1kg orange?

577
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Rs 120

578
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,720
50 kg orange is asking for
the price of 1 kg orange, dude

579
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,320
You black pig, don't bug me
with your cliched poetry!

580
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,440
Alright, I'm a swine
For this dream girl I pine

581
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,440
Get her

582
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Let go of my hand

583
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Better come with me

584
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
Boys will generally create
a scene before falling in love

585
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,880
Stage is already set for you

586
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,720
Just do the action alone

587
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,360
Let go of my hand, you swine

588
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,280
I'll hit you...leave me

589
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,800
Shall I pledge all this?

590
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,760
Let go of me!

591
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,000
Watch me in action now

592
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,560
'Can't believe it!'

593
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,600
If I have a problem, how do you
appear out of the blue?

594
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
If something happens to India
the army will rush

595
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,080
If a town needs help
cops will show up

596
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,520
If you are in trouble
I'll be there for you!

597
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Take a step back
and watch my game

598
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,480
Don't go there
A body might land

599
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
Stand further behind

600
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,000
"Something somehow..."

601
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,200
"...thoughts flood my dreams"

602
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,280
"Kaleidoscopic hues
in my memory streams"

603
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,720
'He repulses me'

604
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,640
Better cooperate with me

605
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,800
Get up

606
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,920
If I catch anyone in the market
acting funny with my cousin...

607
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,880
...he will have his limbs, nose,
eyes in his body, I can assure you

608
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,240
But no breath for sure!

609
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,800
Matted haired fellow

610
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
Let's go, my dear

611
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,720
This absolute swindler is stealing
'ultimate star' Ajith's dialog

612
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,080
You look like a gym master

613
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,920
And you get beaten up
by that tea maker

614
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
Aren't you ashamed?

615
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,360
He's our boss

616
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,360
We work for him
on a monthly salary

617
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,360
We'll tease that girl
wherever she goes

618
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,640
He'll come and save her

619
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
We've come in
different disguises

620
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,720
But that girl doesn't
seem to care one bit

621
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
His love will be set
if he comes in various outfits

622
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
How will it benefit you?

623
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,480
It's work ethics, boss

624
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,120
Until now, gym boys helped
only to separate lovers

625
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,160
But 1st time you are
actually uniting them

626
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,760
I like you, dude

627
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,440
Bless you

628
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,440
Are you in love with the same
girl as that worthless fellow?

629
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,240
Plus she's also
your enemy's daughter

630
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,000
If the enemy is a villain, then
we can take the action route

631
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,720
But he happens
to be a comedian

632
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,160
Let's take the comedy route

633
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,720
Burst all the crackers

634
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,720
- Live it up
- Start the music

635
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Someone from the enemy camp
is approaching us

636
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,120
Keep your weapons handy

637
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,640
Why are you here
with fruits as offering?

638
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm here with fruits
to fuel our old feud

639
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,960
It isn't some antique
jewelry to renew

640
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
It's a feud extending
for 30 long years

641
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Take it out...do it

642
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
No need for knife

643
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,680
Keep quiet

644
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,680
Take the orange
from the plate

645
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,680
Your menacing tone
was for this?

646
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,320
He might take it
back with him, da

647
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,120
I'll punch your mouth, da

648
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Cheap fellow!

649
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
You are looking at me
like I'm the son of your enemy

650
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,760
'Definitely'

651
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,040
But I wish only to be
your neighbor's son

652
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,520
Many years ago
both our families...

653
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,920
...lived happily
without any feud

654
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,600
The hand that was
disabled for 5 years...

655
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,760
...wants to shake hands
for an orange you handed

656
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,680
Shameless man!

657
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,640
The moment the election
was announced...

658
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,440
...from being family friends
we became hard core enemies!

659
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
This feud has lasted
for 2 generations

660
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,680
Now the 3rd generation
is at loggerheads

661
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,320
To put a full stop to
this age old friction...

662
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
...I've taken the 1st step
and come into this house

663
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,760
Grandpa, you used to show me
the moon and tell me a story daily

664
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,960
One new moon night...

665
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,680
...do you remember
the story you told me?

666
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
You said the moon got married

667
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,680
And has gone on a honeymoon

668
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,440
Remember?

669
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,120
Do you still remember that, my boy?

670
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,840
Honeymoon for the moon?

671
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,560
You've told such randy stories
to a 3 year old, you crazy coot

672
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,920
From that night onwards
whenever I see the moon...

673
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,880
...I think only of you

674
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,720
Please don't cry

675
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,400
I don't want anyone
to cry because of me

676
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,040
Why are you all shedding tears
competing with the crocodiles?!

677
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,520
He didn't narrate
that serious a story

678
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,680
If you keep sobbing like this...

679
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,440
...what will he think of our family?

680
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,800
Wipe your eyes

681
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,160
Stop crying
you beardy bandicoot

682
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,680
Wipe your eyes now

683
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,520
My family may flip
for your silly sentiments

684
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,640
But I won't

685
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,720
I expect a settlement
along with sentiment!

686
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,840
You can visit this place
as and when you please

687
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
You can adopt my grandpa

688
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,920
And learn music
from my grandma

689
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
Okay

690
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,320
But in the coming election...

691
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,040
...you won't contest me

692
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,880
Promise me

693
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,360
Are you scared?

694
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,720
Locked!

695
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
Not only in this election...

696
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,280
...but in any election
I won't stand against you

697
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,560
It is a promise

698
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,200
'He actually promised'

699
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I've seen people sacrifice
their love for a friend

700
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,720
But 1st time I'm seeing
someone giving up an election

701
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
You're my friend

702
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,720
Did you see my commander?

703
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,680
Aunt, did you see?

704
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,840
Hey beardy, did you see?

705
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,680
Grandpa, did you see?

706
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,080
My young commander?

707
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,840
Did you all witness
this bonding scene?

708
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,840
Give me that bat

709
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,080
Wait for me

710
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,480
Don't run

711
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,720
Wait, da

712
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,360
You can't catch me

713
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
It doesn't look like
you came to befriend me

714
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Who's that, dude?

715
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,040
Sister

716
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,800
Your sister?

717
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,720
No, for you

718
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,680
My cousin whom
I intend marrying

719
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,680
She isn't some crappy carp
to fall into the net of any chap

720
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,720
She is as slippery as an eel

721
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,160
I don't go for nets

722
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,320
I'll hook her with a bait

723
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,120
What?

724
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm very happy to
have renewed our bond

725
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,920
If I can look
around the house...

726
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,040
...I'll be even more happy

727
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,360
Of course, go ahead

728
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,200
Thank you, grandpa

729
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,640
Move aside
you swine-mouth!

730
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,240
You bandicoot! Can't you see
he has a hidden agenda?

731
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
Got you

732
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,440
Let go of her

733
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,080
If I take my hands off
she might fall

734
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
That's why
I'm holding her

735
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,160
Is she Taj Mahal for you
to hold and behold!

736
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,880
I can even put up
with her falling

737
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,520
But I can't bear to see you
put your hands on her shoulder

738
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,160
Take your hands off

739
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,600
What's happening here?

740
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,040
It slipped

741
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,000
Legs?

742
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,200
Lip

743
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
I've seen bleeding knees

744
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,160
But 1st time in my life
I'm seeing bleeding lips

745
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
Your lip is bleeding

746
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,920
You're making me blush

747
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,160
He's saying 'lip is bleeding'

748
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
She says she's blushing

749
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,560
And I'm mourning and grieving

750
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,960
Why are you going there?

751
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
At least keep your
hands off my grandma!

752
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,400
Why did he ask me
to come here?

753
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,360
Where is he?

754
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,440
Boss, he is here

755
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
Why did you ask him to come?

756
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,320
The other day he played
the violin on my cousin's lips

757
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,240
If we let him be, he will
play veena in my house

758
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,080
If he plays veena,
you play the drum, boss

759
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,160
Am I conducting
a music concert?

760
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,440
Do you let me talk?

761
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,920
Dude, you're here

762
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
I'll join you
in a moment

763
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,560
'Is it you?'

764
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
'Come...come'

765
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,840
Where are you?

766
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,200
I'll catch you
Here I come

767
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Caught you!

768
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,880
Before you pack up,
he'll pick up your cousin

769
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,480
Turn around, boss

770
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,400
Wretched female!

771
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,640
She is tarnishing
the dignity of our family

772
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,160
Let go of him

773
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,760
Is he a cricket ball or what?

774
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,680
As if he's the catch of the year!

775
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
You...huh?

776
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,440
Sorry, I thought
he was Arun

777
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
Is that so?

778
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
Arun, come here

779
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,120
This is Arun

780
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,800
Arun is 2 feet short
and he's 6 feet tall

781
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,200
Don't you know
the difference?

782
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,600
You should hold him tight

783
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,640
And hold him light

784
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,080
So you're accusing me
of hugging him deliberately?

785
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,360
Not like that, dear

786
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,560
Deliberate or otherwise,
won't people read more into it?

787
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,200
Won't they think
it's a bad habit?

788
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
Arun, go there

789
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,320
You go this way

790
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,000
See you

791
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,440
Come here

792
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,280
She was blindfolded and
hugged you by mistake

793
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,280
With your eyes wide open
why were you silent?

794
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,560
Because she's a hottie
I zipped my lips firmly

795
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,160
My God!

796
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,160
Did you mistake me?

797
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,240
Of course I mistook you

798
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,640
If you want our friendship
to continue further...

799
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,960
...you must talk only to me

800
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,920
You shouldn't see me
in my house or the fields

801
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,840
If you still need my help...

802
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,120
...come to the party office

803
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,800
Will your cousin
come to your office?

804
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,240
She'll be there
10 to 12 noon

805
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,520
I'll smash you to pieces

806
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,360
Did he ask you?

807
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,840
Don't come to
the party office

808
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,480
We can meet in
the middle of the road

809
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
And go our different ways

810
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,560
Is it okay?

811
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,040
Oh gawd!

812
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,640
My son has fallen
into the well

813
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,240
Swear on me

814
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Please save my son

815
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,000
Someone please help

816
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,320
Hurry up

817
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,360
My son has
fallen into the well

818
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,000
Someone please help

819
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,760
Don't worry

820
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,960
Even if it's 1000 feet deep...

821
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,880
...I'll save your son

822
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,720
Don't worry
I got you

823
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
I am here for you

824
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,360
Even if I was late
by a second...

825
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,400
...this young kid
would've lost his life

826
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Let go of me, da

827
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,240
What disrespect!

828
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
Can't you hear me?

829
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,400
Why did you bring me
out of the well, da?

830
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,560
I'll hit you hard

831
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,480
You fell down
and almost died

832
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,920
I saved your life

833
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,440
Did I fall willingly?

834
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,040
Then?

835
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,160
I can hold my breath under
the water for a whole day

836
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,120
Don't try your tricks with me

837
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,640
You are such a good swimmer?

838
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,000
Don't tell anyone

839
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,600
Just say I saved you

840
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,720
I'm sparing you
only for this money

841
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
If I see you again
near the well...

842
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,920
...I will skin you alive

843
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,600
Nutcase!

844
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,960
Sister, your son is safe

845
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,200
He witnessed
the whole drama

846
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,320
This scene fell in place
of its own accord

847
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,280
Don't snitch

848
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,760
It will be a disgrace

849
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,960
She has eyes only for him

850
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,160
You came running first, right?

851
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,560
Why didn't you jump into
the well and save that boy?

852
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,600
Why did you hesitate?

853
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,400
I came running
on the spur of the moment

854
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,560
Only after seeing the water...

855
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,280
...I realized I can't swim

856
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't you know to swim?

857
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,240
No

858
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,520
You don't have to learn
swimming to save others

859
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,960
But you should know at least
to save yourself, right?

860
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,160
I should've learnt it
when I was a kid

861
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,920
Who will teach me now?

862
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,120
I can teach you

863
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,400
"You didn't see
the girl I saw clearly"

864
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,000
(Smoking causes cancer
smoking kills)

865
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,720
"The girl you saw clearly
I didn't see, you see"

866
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,840
"Your glance and mine differ really"

867
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,360
"The sight I saw apparently
you didn't get to see"

868
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,720
Have I learned to swim?

869
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,240
That's all there is to it

870
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,160
He isn't holding
the rope properly

871
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,960
Hold the rope tight
Otherwise it will be risky

872
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,440
I've sent you alone
with him in the water

873
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Can this be riskier than that?

874
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,320
Boss, I don't know
to swim either

875
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,280
So what?

876
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,080
Can you ask your cousin
to teach me as well?

877
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,560
The cost is not a criteria

878
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
You look like a rhino

879
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
And you're ready
to pounce on a calf

880
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,360
Bad enough his swimming lesson
is making my stomach somersault!

881
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,080
And you're adding
fuel to the fire

882
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,000
Boss, why are you flustered?
Don't you trust your cousin?

883
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,000
I trust her

884
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,960
But not her age

885
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,000
Her age is bound to graze

886
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,640
He's in the age
to gaze and raze

887
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm terrified
he'll pounce on her

888
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,280
Come here

889
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,520
(indistinct mumbling)

890
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,360
He is in a tearing hurry

891
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,360
Why are you in a hurry?

892
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
How long do I swim
on the surface?

893
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I want to dive in now

894
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,880
Do you intend
joining the Olympics?

895
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,840
Swim on the surface
and come out quickly

896
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
It's crowded here

897
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,240
Shall we learn to
swim underwater?

898
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,120
Boss, he has taken her down
giving some silly excuse

899
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,120
Stop gaping, boss
and pull the rope

900
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,520
Cousin's fate is sealed!

901
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
Even when he's outside
his behavior is bad

902
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,360
Imagine the limits
he will cross down under

903
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,440
Why are you on this river bank
tugging at a rope?

904
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,360
I'm testing the level of water
for farming in summer

905
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,720
You are the only politician
to think of the farmers 24x7x365

906
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,000
'He has seen them'

907
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll pay you even if it is
a little more than I can afford

908
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,400
But bring her everyday

909
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,520
Underwater swimming
is refreshing

910
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,720
I've heard of men
who pander at night

911
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,160
This is the 1st time I'm seeing
someone procure during the day

912
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
A man should make money
by working his butt out

913
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,640
Not earn by butting in
and lining his pocket

914
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,360
How dare you accuse me?

915
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,480
You, bloody flesh-peddler!

916
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,840
He'll tom-tom all over

917
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,680
- Shall we go?
- Don't be so loud

918
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,560
Is it a crime
to talk to you?

919
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,720
God help me

920
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
I'm a weak student

921
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,200
So even if I take 10-15 days,
please teach me patiently

922
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,880
I nearly died
just in one day

923
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,840
And you want 10 or 15 days?

924
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,520
Come here, dude

925
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,720
You really don't know to swim?

926
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,560
Of course I know!

927
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,240
Then why are you pretending?

928
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,360
Dude, girls prefer boys
who say they don't know

929
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,720
That's the technique
I'm using with your cousin

930
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,360
'How do I save my Nayantara
from this Simbu?'

931
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,080
Have you eaten?

932
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,120
Generally we as hosts
ask this question to a guest

933
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,920
You are the guest here
and you're asking her!

934
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,560
Uncle, how come
you are at home today?

935
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,120
I am busy
if I am outside

936
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,600
When I'm at home
it means I am hungry

937
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,680
Do you know how
to ride a cycle?

938
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,000
'Dude, girls prefer boys
who say they don't know'

939
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,080
What?

940
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,760
I don't...know

941
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,440
I don't even know
where the pedal is

942
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,480
Or the bell
I have no clue

943
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,280
Do you know how
to ride a cycle?

944
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,600
- Yes, I do
- Will you teach me?

945
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,360
It is my duty

946
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,760
You get the cycle ready

947
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,920
I'll get you ready

948
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,280
You told me girls prefer boys
who say they don't know

949
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,840
Sometimes girls prefer boys
who say they know

950
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,320
That's the technique
I used here

951
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,680
He keeps confusing me

952
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,560
Slowly

953
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Yes, gently

954
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,560
Yes, you almost got it

955
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,800
Watch your step?

956
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,120
Like this?

957
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,200
Yes

958
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,800
Now step by step
I'll teach you

959
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,520
Okay

960
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,040
This is the handle bar

961
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,040
You take this hand and
place it on this handle bar

962
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,600
And hold it tight

963
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,480
Boss

964
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,480
He didn't touch the handle bar

965
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,560
He stroked your cousin's hand!

966
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,600
This is the pedal

967
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,840
Take your foot
and place it firmly-

968
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,120
What are you doing?

969
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,440
You must pedal
with your foot like this

970
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,320
Boss, he's stroking

971
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,320
- Only the pedal?
- No...her leg

972
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,520
Main point to remember
you must not bend your waist

973
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,240
Why?

974
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Then you will fall

975
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,080
Won't you catch me if I fall?

976
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,160
Of course I will

977
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,040
To make sure
you don't bend...

978
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,720
...I'll hold your waist

979
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,080
Boss, he's holding
your cousin's waist

980
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,000
Why yell as if you burnt
your hand on a stove?

981
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,600
Dude, I'll hold her waist
Will you hold the cycle?

982
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,120
'He's torturing me deeply'

983
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,120
Okay, you look very tensed

984
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,400
I'll hold both

985
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,040
It's crowded here

986
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,600
Shall we go learn alone?

987
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,480
I had peace of mind
when he was my enemy

988
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,360
As a friend, he is
torturing me to death

989
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,200
Sir, just say the word
and I'll deflate the tires

990
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,520
Enough of your ideas

991
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,520
Just the 6 of us seem
like a crowd to him, huh?

992
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,120
She asked you first
if you knew to ride a cycle

993
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,000
Instead of saying yes
and having a field day...

994
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,640
...you let her loose
in the field with him

995
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,280
Okay, let it go
It's just a cycle

996
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,560
That's what you think

997
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,840
But he used that as
an excuse to sideline you

998
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,880
And cycled away with her

999
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,320
It's not like that, friend

1000
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,080
You know how
in a crowded bus...

1001
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,120
...we accidentally touch
the female passengers

1002
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,280
Let's take it that way

1003
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,320
Stop it, boss

1004
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,280
They get so angry
even if it is an accident

1005
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,320
This incident is intentional

1006
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,320
She's co-operating happily
instead of getting angry

1007
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,240
That isn't the point

1008
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,440
Even if you use 101 excuses
he got away with his ruses

1009
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,680
He got away with 2 dialogs
'I know I don't know'

1010
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,640
And he took your cousin
from under your chin

1011
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,720
That isn't the point, my dear chap

1012
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,720
This is just an ordinary cycle?

1013
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,400
I'll buy her a car
and bait her tomorrow

1014
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,920
Even if you buy a car,
he'll only drive it

1015
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,120
You blockhead bloke

1016
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,120
I'm already in a state of
confusion worse confounded

1017
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,240
And you're rubbing
salt on to my wound

1018
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,480
That's the way

1019
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,720
Soooper

1020
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,480
Little bit of balance

1021
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,600
Watch out

1022
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,520
Now I'll take my hand off

1023
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,520
I'll let go
I have let go

1024
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,080
You need some balance!

1025
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,960
Sorry

1026
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,840
I told you I'll teach you
how to ride a cycle

1027
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,320
And I pushed you down

1028
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,160
I fell on purpose

1029
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
When I can ride a scooty
won't I know how to ride a cycle?

1030
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,160
I wanted to get to
know you better

1031
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,040
So I acted
as if I didn't know

1032
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,280
I also know
how to swim

1033
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,120
I lied to get to
know you better

1034
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,800
I stepped into your house
only to fall in love with you

1035
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,720
I love you too

1036
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,800
Now that we are in love
shall we sing a song?

1037
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,120
"Your style is your power"

1038
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,080
"I am a public figure"

1039
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,600
"I intend chatting-dating
with you, my darling"

1040
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,160
"Enchantress, temptress tipsy
You (s)tumbled and fell on me"

1041
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,440
"And you got into my mind easily"

1042
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,440
"My throat feels clammed
My love explodes with a bang"

1043
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,440
"Prince, kiss me
In gallons plenty"

1044
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,840
"Kisses you drink up
with gulps nonstop"

1045
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,160
"My heart misses a beat
Adrenalin races indeed"

1046
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,560
"You ride me like a cycle with expertise"

1047
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,480
"You show me paradise in your eyes"

1048
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,680
"You gallivant fancy-free
thru' vales and dales with me"

1049
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,160
"You scream into my ear loudly
to take you to Love-city"

1050
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,160
"Miss Love-demoness hoity-toity"

1051
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:03,120
"Siren, seductress dizzily
You (s)tumbled and fell on me"

1052
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,400
"And you got into my soul breezily"

1053
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,640
"My throat feels clammed
My love explodes with a bang"

1054
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,000
"Prince, kiss me
In gallons plenty"

1055
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,680
"Touch me bravely"

1056
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,120
"Look at me again, sweetie"

1057
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
"My jasmine beauty"

1058
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
"Come to me readily"

1059
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,400
"Love happened in a blink"

1060
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,520
"Didn't sleep even a wink"

1061
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,880
"Now we rock and roll"

1062
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,960
"In foreign soil"

1063
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,320
"No flight to handle
Nor a visa hassle"

1064
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,840
"No laws to abide
for this love-ride"

1065
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,960
"When you spoke, dear"

1066
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,320
"Nothing else I wanted to hear"

1067
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,000
"The moment my eyes saw you"

1068
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,760
"No one else could be my beau"

1069
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,520
"Like a coin flipped in mid-air
my mind flies with a fillip share"

1070
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,200
"Love gathered in gallons
wants to test its skill at once"

1071
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,520
"Miss Love-incubus"

1072
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:40,280
"Miss Chanakya, smooth operator
(s)tumbled on me, schemer you are"

1073
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,160
"You entered my heart's chamber"

1074
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,560
"My throat feels clammed
My love explodes with a bang"

1075
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,920
"Prince, kiss me
In gallons plenty"

1076
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,880
"Style goes for a toss"

1077
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,320
Son...?

1078
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,720
Can you call a mechanic
if there's one nearby?

1079
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,240
Call him yourself
if your car has stopped

1080
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,720
Why are you asking me?

1081
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,240
Am I your servant?

1082
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Get lost, man

1083
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,400
Our car broke down

1084
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Can you send us a mechanic?

1085
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,360
I'm a mechanic myself

1086
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,520
I can take apart any car from
Audi to lorry and repair them

1087
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,040
Who is this man?
Your driver?

1088
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,040
Father

1089
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,000
I'll hook it in 5 minutes

1090
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
- Which?
- The car

1091
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,600
Go, man

1092
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,720
Actually the engine
shouldn't be here

1093
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,160
Which company is this?

1094
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,600
Oh! This car, huh?

1095
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,280
Looks like a big party

1096
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,840
Should fix the car

1097
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,880
Repair her mind

1098
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,600
And get settled in life

1099
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,680
I'll pretend to repair it

1100
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,480
Sir, start the car

1101
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,440
Why are you honking?

1102
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,040
Where are they?

1103
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,920
Mechanic, fix the car
and bring it to his house

1104
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,720
I'll give you 5 or 10 bucks
so you can buy a cup of tea

1105
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,760
You know his house?

1106
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,760
As if he won't know!

1107
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,080
Get it ready double quick
and bring it home

1108
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,440
You know who this is?

1109
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,240
My uncle

1110
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,920
Come here from Chennai

1111
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,960
Do you know English,
country brute?

1112
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
What a funny face he has

1113
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,960
He locked my cousin

1114
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,880
I'll do the same to his cousin

1115
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,120
All of you please sit

1116
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,480
My brother-in-law
wanted to see you all

1117
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,680
That's why I called you here

1118
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,480
Kadiresa, even though
you settled down in Chennai...

1119
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,160
...you haven't forgotten us
in all these years

1120
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,360
How can you say that?
Who are you?

1121
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,520
My kith and kin

1122
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,440
My partners

1123
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,120
I've fixed my daughter's wedding

1124
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,680
The groom is my friend's son

1125
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,000
He holds a very prestigious post

1126
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,840
In Chennai

1127
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,560
I thought I should come
and invite all of you personally

1128
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,360
You've invited us,
coming all the way here

1129
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,520
How will we not come?

1130
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,040
Our entire village will be present
and make it a festival!

1131
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,080
'She likes dogs'

1132
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,640
'I like her'

1133
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,960
'Let me befriend the dog
and then become her boyfriend'

1134
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,360
Hello...hello?

1135
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,680
- Is this your baby?
- Yes, what happened?

1136
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,440
It escaped onto
the streets on its own

1137
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,200
Street dogs were
chasing it ferociously

1138
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,880
I jumped in the middle of the road
somersaulted and saved this little pup

1139
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,640
It escaped from the street dog
And got caught with this mongrel

1140
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,080
You've been of great help

1141
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,640
Will you drink tea or coffee?

1142
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,800
I'll drink anything you give me

1143
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,720
Will you drink the water
kept for our cows?

1144
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,520
Here you go
I'll bring coffee

1145
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,560
Foreign biscuit

1146
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,560
You got my cousin
wooing her for a week

1147
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,360
I hooked your cousin in one day
Did you notice that?

1148
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,320
She offered me a biscuit
the 1st time she set eyes on me

1149
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,000
Next meet, I'll give her
a mango as aphrodisiac!

1150
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,480
Okay, give me a biscuit

1151
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,960
No, this is a love gift
I won't give anyone

1152
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,200
Why are you
eating this biscuit?

1153
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,760
You gave it to me

1154
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,120
Gawd! It's for the dog

1155
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,920
Dog biscuit?

1156
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,680
That will make him froth
at the mouth, right?

1157
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,800
He'll pee near an electric pole!

1158
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,360
Oh no...grandma!

1159
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,800
Why did you call me?

1160
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,440
I've fallen in love

1161
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,000
With whom?

1162
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,480
Your cousin

1163
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,840
My bloody fate!

1164
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,800
A rooster can wish
to eat wheat

1165
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,440
But not gold biscuits

1166
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,480
How can a rooster
eat gold biscuits?

1167
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,800
Don't think you're clever
and make me lose my temper

1168
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,680
Same way, how do you
think she will love you?

1169
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,200
She's as fair as a foreigner

1170
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,760
You are dark like
a cucumber seller

1171
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,800
How will it match?

1172
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,200
When whites in America
can elect a colored president...

1173
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,800
...can't I be the husband
of your fair cousin?

1174
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,080
Don't try to use color
to break up my love

1175
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,920
If she doesn't become my wife...

1176
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,480
...I'll sacrifice my life

1177
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,840
She'll die if she knows
you're thinking of her you know

1178
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,000
She is already engaged

1179
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,680
Even if she gets married,
I won't let her go

1180
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,040
Don't you feel ashamed to buy
the records of someone else's bike?

1181
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,520
I ward off evil for stolen cars

1182
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,840
- Hey!
- What?

1183
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,640
Why do you keep going
from pillar to post?

1184
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,960
Can't you be
in one place and talk?

1185
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,680
She's getting married
in Chennai next week

1186
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,160
What will you do in one week?

1187
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,760
We're going to Chennai tomorrow,
meeting her fiance, kidnapping him

1188
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,920
...and threatening him

1189
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,360
If he doesn't respond-

1190
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,960
This seems risky

1191
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,760
I'm not game for-

1192
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,600
If I don't get your cousin,
I won't let you marry mine

1193
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,600
I'll even sacrifice my life
to ensure you both break up

1194
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,560
I'll split you

1195
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,400
Break it up

1196
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,680
I'll break the bond

1197
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,160
That's what I'll say

1198
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,320
Don't I have the right?

1199
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,640
You're getting angry

1200
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,200
Okay, we'll go to
Chennai tomorrow

1201
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,080
We'll see the fiance
and kidnap him

1202
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,240
Okay?

1203
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,800
Bro, can I hug you
just one time?

1204
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,880
Come, dude

1205
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,120
Praise be to Lord Muruga!

1206
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,680
He is the groom, dude

1207
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
- Hey! Wait
- What?

1208
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
What will you achieve
by going empty-handed?

1209
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,920
Take this with you

1210
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,680
Idiot! How can I take
a knife into the temple?

1211
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,560
If you swing it along
it looks like a weapon

1212
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,080
If you add this lemon
it is devotion

1213
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,720
I like your dialogs
with gun-timing

1214
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,760
Don't waste time with
your rhyme, do your crime!

1215
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,000
'He looks comical whatever
I do to change him'

1216
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,640
Hey...come here

1217
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,640
Why call me back
when I want to hack?

1218
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,280
If someone sneaks to the cops
about your fast and furious act?

1219
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,680
So...what do we do?

1220
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,200
Sis, hold this bag

1221
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,400
Be still

1222
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,640
What are you up to?

1223
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,520
Praise be to Kali
Goddess of fury

1224
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,800
Now you resemble
hero Vijay in 'Thirupaachi'

1225
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,720
Anyone who hears this
will have a hearty laugh

1226
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,520
Don't be silly
This is serious business

1227
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,880
Furious
More fury

1228
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,840
He has gone into that crowd

1229
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,760
In that same crowd
I'll slice him to pieces

1230
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,640
Come back victorious

1231
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,000
I'll make that 'curd rice' bleed
to death as red as 'tomato rice'

1232
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
Move aside

1233
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,840
Where is he?

1234
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,320
Next?

1235
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,280
Like a hotelier pierces the bill
he stuck this right in

1236
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,040
- Where did he disappear?
- Praise be to Lord Muruga

1237
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,080
Missing for so long, moron!

1238
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,040
They are feeding the needy
on the other side, go there

1239
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,360
Good lord!
What is this?

1240
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,920
Can't understand a word...wait

1241
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,800
You went in
to slice that groom

1242
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,800
And you got your tongue
almost sliced into two

1243
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,920
As if I'll torture myself
That God-man pierced it

1244
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,680
Why did you stick
your tongue out at him?

1245
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,840
Why would I?

1246
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,640
He pounced on me, pierced me
and packed me away

1247
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,360
You're not even
fit to be pickled!

1248
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,680
Come with me

1249
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,600
Hey...wait

1250
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,640
He is going...gone

1251
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,560
He escaped?

1252
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,480
I won't spare him

1253
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,800
You find an auto
I'll change and join you

1254
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,400
That's him

1255
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,160
Follow him

1256
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,640
1st murder

1257
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,920
Do a thorough job

1258
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,480
Shall I kill him?

1259
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,840
Patience!

1260
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,920
- Shall I kill him?
- Be patient!

1261
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,440
Shall I kill him?

1262
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
Do it, sir

1263
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,600
You keep asking
simply for effect?

1264
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,000
Why are you getting tensed?

1265
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,400
How many murders we would
have witnessed in an auto?

1266
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,360
Do it before the police hound you

1267
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,560
This is a metro city

1268
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,200
There will be cameras
all over the place

1269
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,080
You shouldn't act in haste
and repent later

1270
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,760
Dude, he has got himself
cornered in a dead end

1271
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,080
Can't get a better chance than this

1272
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,000
Before he finishes peeing
you finish him off

1273
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,680
You think so?

1274
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,600
I won't spare you

1275
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,120
Is he going for a walk?

1276
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,280
By just following him
he has made my bones weary

1277
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,640
You come here from Bihar

1278
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,920
Kidnap children and
hold them to ransom

1279
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,040
Kidnap college girls
and rape them

1280
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,080
Throw that body
in Andhra border

1281
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,960
We can close the case claiming
we shot them when they escaped

1282
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,280
Dude, what happened?

1283
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,200
You went in like superstar Rajini
And you come out like Ghajini!

1284
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,160
Did you leave me and drink
tender coconut water?

1285
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,920
I didn't drink any damn thing

1286
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,200
- I pissed in fear
- Yuck!

1287
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,200
Instead of him pissing
he made me pee!

1288
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,400
He's a police officer from
the encounter department

1289
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,440
- What?
- He counts and kills

1290
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,160
He made 4 thugs kneel down and
shot them dead in that dead end

1291
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,520
Why are you scared?

1292
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,360
Are we from a family
that can be scared by a gun?

1293
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,680
Even a stone can scare me!

1294
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,400
You've seen me fall in love

1295
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,040
You've seen me
excel in comedy

1296
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,200
Have you seen me in action?

1297
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,040
No

1298
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,480
You'll see it now

1299
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,480
Come along

1300
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,760
If you won't take a complaint
what does it mean, sir?

1301
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,440
You claim 'the police is your friend'

1302
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,200
First you answer
my friend's query

1303
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,840
Who is this bringing the roof down?

1304
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,400
They have come to
lodge a complaint

1305
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,760
Take it and send him

1306
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,520
Complaint is against you, sir

1307
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,600
Against me?

1308
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,160
If you don't accept
this complaint...

1309
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,040
...we'll protest in front of
the commissioner's office

1310
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,080
Let's go in, dude

1311
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,000
Why are you sweating
when it is so cool in here?

1312
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,640
It's not AC as in air conditioner

1313
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,080
But that Assistant Commissioner
sends shivers down my spine

1314
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,560
You shouldn't be flustered now

1315
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,680
But a bull seeing red

1316
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,560
He is the one who
should be flustered

1317
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,520
Take all this off

1318
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,880
Hey! Now why are you
unbuttoning my shirt?

1319
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,680
To frighten your enemy
you should be fit as a fiddle

1320
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,080
Or the perfect body language!

1321
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,360
You are too scrawny

1322
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,160
But make him pee in his pants
with your body language

1323
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,280
Go, get him

1324
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,120
'Now watch my body language'

1325
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,280
Look at my friend's performance

1326
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,920
He'll be in shock
looking at my walk

1327
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,960
What a stride!

1328
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,160
You think you are some don

1329
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,360
Walking in to this office
with your shirt unbuttoned

1330
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,200
Look how decently dressed
this gentleman is

1331
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,280
'I am unable to understand
his body language!'

1332
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,960
Button up your shirt, rascal

1333
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,880
Let's go, dude

1334
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,320
No tears, don't cry

1335
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,240
Steady, watch your step

1336
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,640
Tell me

1337
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,200
Sir...I want-

1338
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,720
Can I drink some water?

1339
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,280
Why is he behaving so weirdly?

1340
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,720
Sir, he is hopping mad at you

1341
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,520
What's wrong, buddy?

1342
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,880
He has a gun in his hand

1343
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,440
Do you want him
to be trigger happy?

1344
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,160
Don't worry
I'm here for you

1345
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,840
Come to the point

1346
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,040
Sir, I am in love
with his cousin

1347
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,840
Okay

1348
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,920
He is in love
with my cousin

1349
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,120
Hmmm...okay

1350
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,720
You're marrying his cousin

1351
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,720
If you do so, whose cousin
will I marry then?

1352
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,840
'I spoke correctly
He is confused now'

1353
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,600
Who are you?

1354
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,240
He doesn't seem to know us

1355
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,920
This man...?

1356
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,400
'Are they planning
for the next encounter?'

1357
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,920
Get the jeep ready

1358
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,360
Let's talk on the way
Come along with me

1359
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,720
No problem

1360
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,360
Where is he taking us?

1361
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,880
Lunch time, right?

1362
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,440
He wants to take us to a hotel
enjoy 'biriyani' and talk leisurely

1363
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,400
Let's go

1364
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,040
Tell him to choose a good
non vegetarian hotel

1365
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,000
I thought he was taking
us to a hotel

1366
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,760
I thought so too

1367
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,000
We are in a bus stand now

1368
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,440
Sir, tickets you asked

1369
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,880
Maybe he wants us
to watch a movie

1370
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,080
Here are 2 tickets

1371
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,920
Which film, sir?

1372
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,840
I shouldn't set my eyes
on you in this lifetime

1373
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,520
Go back to your home town

1374
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,360
We are talking serious
business with you

1375
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,800
And you're packing us off
back home like school kids?

1376
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,600
I'm being very decent because
you're in the department

1377
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,440
He's a thug after
becoming a cop

1378
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,440
My friend is a thug
right from school days

1379
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,960
When did I ever
step inside a school?

1380
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,720
'He is booking my death in advance'

1381
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,640
Hey wait!

1382
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:51,080
'My lord Jesus, save me
from the hands of this Satan'

1383
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,360
'Thank God I'm safe'

1384
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,240
'He is also alive?'

1385
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,720
'How come he is alive?'

1386
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,720
'Who was the victim then?'

1387
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,400
Who is this?

1388
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,560
I told you to surrender

1389
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,760
And you're trying to
escape to Andhra?

1390
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,960
Drag him away

1391
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,240
You were saying
something to me

1392
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,160
What was it about?

1393
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,280
Listening to all that you said
clearly and precisely...

1394
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,960
...we decided to go back
to our home town

1395
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,360
Let's go, buddy

1396
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,760
Whaat?

1397
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,880
Sir, a small request

1398
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,880
Let's flip a coin

1399
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
If it is tails
you can tail her

1400
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,880
If it's heads
I go ahead marrying her

1401
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,400
Heads

1402
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,080
She is mine

1403
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,960
'Why is he screwing up his face?'

1404
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,960
Is this a cricket match
to play 'heads or tails'?

1405
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,800
I'll smash you-

1406
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,440
What?

1407
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,400
Get this straight into your mind

1408
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,160
What, da?

1409
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,360
Only 5 minutes left
for the bus to start

1410
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,640
Before that finish all your
unfinished business

1411
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,880
I'll reserve
a seat for you

1412
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Sir, he's a bit short tempered

1413
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,400
Punch you on your face
You're short tempered, huh?

1414
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,160
My friend has a heart of gold

1415
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,320
I'll sacrifice even my life for him

1416
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,040
Stop begging inside the bus

1417
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:24,960
Don't sit next to me

1418
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,360
Move aside
Don't touch me

1419
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,760
Hey...you?

1420
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,360
He has ripped you apart?

1421
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,960
Didn't you retaliate?

1422
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,520
Did you?

1423
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,040
I would have thrashed him

1424
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,240
But he was in his uniform
So I spared his life

1425
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,400
You've learnt to talk

1426
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,640
He isn't even human

1427
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,040
He beat me up without
any qualms in a public place

1428
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,400
Why are you crying?

1429
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,800
I'm telling you even now

1430
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,760
- This wedding won't happen
- How are you so sure?

1431
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,400
We kidnap the groom

1432
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,080
We stop the wedding

1433
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,640
Again, huh?

1434
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,840
(indistinct chatter)

1435
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,400
Come...welcome

1436
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,560
'Glutton'

1437
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,400
'Come to hog'

1438
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,560
Hey Anju darling!

1439
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,160
How are you?

1440
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,080
Seeing this wedding
I'm in the marriage-mood

1441
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,160
I'm in the mood
for honeymoon now

1442
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,600
Do your lovey-dovey talk
in the kitchen...go

1443
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,360
Forever disturbing us

1444
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,640
Get lost, you kumki!

1445
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,360
Go in and take care
of the guests

1446
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,440
See you

1447
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,960
'He's making an ass of himself'

1448
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,160
Spread the leaves fast

1449
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,360
Bro, they are looking for you

1450
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,040
Why are you dressed up
all fancy, like the groom?

1451
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,120
You planned to kidnap the groom
and stop the wedding, didn't you?

1452
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,760
I believed you and
I'm here in this attire

1453
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,120
Your speech is at a tangent

1454
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,600
Oh! That plan, huh?

1455
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,720
You were hurting and in tears

1456
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,440
So I said that to console you

1457
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,120
You took that seriously?

1458
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,360
I can never be
her husband then?

1459
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,520
You can't even be
the best man, da

1460
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,920
You won't be able
to handle this

1461
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,040
Hey! Come here

1462
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,400
Drink this raw in 1 gulp
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1463
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,080
Stand in a corner and
watch the function

1464
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,760
I have a lot of work to do

1465
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,800
Let me empty this into me

1466
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,280
Bring the bride

1467
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,480
Bring the groom

1468
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,920
Shakthi

1469
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,080
Come

1470
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,560
'29 minutes earlier'

1471
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,640
(Holy chants)

1472
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,800
There is an important
enquiry to be made

1473
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,520
Come outside
Just for 5 minutes

1474
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,080
Dad...?

1475
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,600
Be calm

1476
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,200
I'm right here

1477
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,680
Why are they taking
our groom outside?

1478
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,280
Sir, why are you taking him
with you on his wedding day?

1479
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:59,040
He allowed the real bank robbers
to escape by taking a bribe from them

1480
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,880
He got college students from Bihar
caught in a false encounter case

1481
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,200
We've got orders to arrest him
from the Human rights commission

1482
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:08,800
Brother-in-law

1483
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,960
Be calm

1484
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,640
Let me see what I can do

1485
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,120
What a disaster!

1486
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,440
Did they fall for the groom...

1487
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,760
...because of his prestigious
job and high connections?

1488
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,560
That's why a thorough
investigation is a must

1489
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,680
As if they wouldn't
have done that?

1490
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,840
Bro...?

1491
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,800
Bro-in-law?

1492
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,640
Dad?

1493
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,000
What's wrong?

1494
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,000
What happened?

1495
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,720
Think about
our bride's future

1496
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,840
Let us discuss this
after the wedding

1497
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,240
Sir, there is a chance he will
be locked up for 10-15 years

1498
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,440
The bride's life will be ruined

1499
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,360
Sir-

1500
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:48,920
Brother...?

1501
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,480
Don't worry
It will all be fine

1502
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
Brother-in-law

1503
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,240
My daughter's life
is ruined because of me

1504
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,680
I only saw if the groom was
educated and had a good job

1505
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,320
I overlooked his character!

1506
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,720
Why are you crying?

1507
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,240
You've called the entire village

1508
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,960
Will we abandon you
in your time of need?

1509
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,840
Point out a good boy
you like from our village

1510
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,200
We will finalize it right now

1511
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,720
Where will I go looking for
a good groom at this point?

1512
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,840
Why should you hunt
for a good boy?

1513
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,920
Our brother-in-law's son
Shakthi is a perfect choice

1514
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,400
Just ask your brother-in-law...

1515
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,080
...if he is okay
with this alliance

1516
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,240
As if he will say no?

1517
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,080
That's not fair

1518
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,440
If I had asked him earlier
for this alliance, then it is okay

1519
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,800
Now to say, 'please let your son marry
my daughter because of this situation'

1520
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,600
How can I face him and
ask him such a favor?

1521
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,520
Bro-in-law!

1522
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,400
How can you separate
my family and yours?

1523
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,920
Divya is my sister's daughter

1524
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,880
I can't keep quiet
seeing her suffer

1525
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,880
Let me announce this

1526
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,720
In front of all of you now

1527
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,680
This wedding will
be performed today

1528
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,920
On this same stage, my son
will marry your daughter

1529
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,360
Have faith in me

1530
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,120
To be on the safe side
ask your son, bro

1531
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,440
My son will never defy me

1532
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,600
Shakthi...?

1533
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,720
Beat the drums

1534
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,720
'A month later'

1535
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,040
I have to go to Thiruvanmiyur

1536
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,840
Okay, sir

1537
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,120
Vincent's duty is over

1538
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,600
I'll take care of this gate

1539
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,960
Stop, bro

1540
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,480
Here is your fare

1541
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,320
You called me repeatedly and
here you are sitting so relaxed

1542
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,080
And happily watching
some silly cartoon

1543
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,880
Why did you ask me to come?

1544
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,520
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1545
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,720
One who calls you when
he's bored is your friend

1546
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,920
One who treats you for a beer
is your 'best' friend!

1547
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,840
You are my best friend

1548
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,680
That's why I need
a favor from you

1549
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,520
Shoot

1550
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,640
Is love marriage ideal?

1551
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,320
Or a marriage
arranged formally?

1552
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,120
If one has decided to
commit suicide...

1553
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,840
...what does it matter
if it's a noose or sleeping pills?

1554
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,320
Bang on, dude

1555
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,680
A man can easily be
a bachelor and happy

1556
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,920
A girl can also be
foot loose and fancy free

1557
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,840
But I swear a man and a woman can
never live under the same roof happily

1558
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,640
Why are you telling this to me?
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1559
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,320
I'm planning to divorce my wife

1560
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,160
Whaaat?

1561
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,240
Not even a month
since you got married?

1562
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,800
What's made you come to
such a drastic conclusion?

1563
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,280
Tell me every single detail,
except your wedding night!

1564
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
I'll tell you from
my wedding night

1565
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,960
'I went to my bedroom
at the stroke of 9'

1566
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,840
'She didn't come in
when the clock struck 10'

1567
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,320
'11:00 p.m and
still no sign of her'

1568
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,240
'At 12 midnight-'

1569
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,120
Did she come?

1570
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,560
The maid came in

1571
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,200
Madam is busy
with her project work

1572
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,880
She'll be free
only in the morning

1573
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,160
She asked you to
shut the door and go to bed

1574
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,680
She didn't ask me to
shut just the door, dude
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1575
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,640
Then...?

1576
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,960
My tender heart also

1577
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,480
'Instead of coming in the previous
night with a glass of milk...'

1578
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,640
'...she came in the morning
with a cup of coffee'

1579
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,440
We've just got married

1580
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,280
We need time to
understand each other

1581
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,440
Only then we can
lead a happy life

1582
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,360
Let's maintain our distance
till we get to know each other

1583
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,720
She said she would switch off the light
only when you understand each other
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1584
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,360
Even that is okay

1585
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,240
You know what
happened on that day?

1586
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,120
What happened?

1587
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,000
Get up

1588
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:28,960
Careful

1589
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,200
Slowly

1590
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,240
Who spilt so much water here?

1591
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,080
I did

1592
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,520
I peed and washed my feet

1593
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,120
Will anyone spill water
on the floor of a restroom?

1594
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,280
Why not?

1595
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,480
In my village, we have to
wash our feet after peeing

1596
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,880
Only then can we step inside

1597
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,000
Your bathroom in the city
is inside the house

1598
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,160
So I followed
my usual routine

1599
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,440
Is this a public toilet?

1600
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,080
To wash your feet?

1601
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,560
This is a western toilet

1602
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,600
Don't stare blankly

1603
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,840
1st learn how to
use this properly

1604
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,560
Put the lid up, pee and
press the flush button

1605
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,240
It will clean automatically

1606
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,280
Understood?

1607
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,240
It's okay if she teaches me 1-2-3

1608
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,200
She even coaches me how to pee!

1609
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,960
You know how good
I was in 1st grade...

1610
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
...when I used to
piss on the wall

1611
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,360
When you were 6, you used to be
the Olympic champion in peeing

1612
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,360
It's okay if she teaches
her husband to kiss

1613
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,160
Instead she taught him to piss

1614
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,120
Shakthi, give the burger to Rahul

1615
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,960
He can't tolerate hunger

1616
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,960
Evening warm up the milk
and give it to him

1617
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,120
He hates being
cooped up at home

1618
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,840
Take him out shopping

1619
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,440
Just clean this comb also

1620
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,840
Who is this Rahul?

1621
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,320
Her nephew?

1622
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,960
Her pet doggy!

1623
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,040
She wanted Rahul to be given
burger and milk at the right time

1624
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,560
Did she say she has cooked for me?

1625
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Leave it, dude

1626
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,160
Your wife is at least
asking you to feed her dog

1627
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,720
Some wives treat
their husbands like dogs

1628
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,480
Village girls get
possessed by ghosts

1629
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,120
City girls get obsessed with dogs

1630
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,960
You must not take
all this to heart

1631
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,680
Come on

1632
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,320
I was playing a game of cards
with my friends happily, dude

1633
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,040
At that time-

1634
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,200
(clears throat)

1635
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,000
Okay, bro

1636
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,000
We'll continue tomorrow

1637
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,840
- Enough
- Bro...?

1638
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,240
Time to switch on the motor
for water, see you

1639
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,080
Peter, sit

1640
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,720
Time for me to
water the plants

1641
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,600
Why, da?

1642
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,320
Go

1643
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,560
Give me 5 minutes
I'll dish up something

1644
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,960
We can both eat dinner together

1645
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,760
You go ahead

1646
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,240
I already cooked
and ate fish for dinner

1647
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,480
You went to the market
and bought fish?

1648
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,800
You had that huge fish
in your fish tank

1649
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,040
I fished it out, cleaned,
chopped, fried it and ate

1650
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,240
You ate my 'vastu' fish?

1651
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,240
Was that your good luck fish?

1652
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,120
I thought it was king fish?

1653
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,680
Do you know
the price of that fish?

1654
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,640
Rs 150000

1655
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,680
1 fish costs 1.5 lakhs?

1656
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,880
It wasn't that tasty

1657
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,240
The shopkeeper has
taken you for a royal ride

1658
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
Even if we auctioned
the fishes in our village pond...

1659
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,800
...they will fetch
the same price

1660
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,760
You've been duped

1661
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,920
Don't you know to differentiate
a vastu fish and a king fish?

1662
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,560
Poor you!

1663
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,280
Not knowing English
you're being humiliated

1664
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,720
Born in Tamil Nadu and
not knowing English isn't a dishonor

1665
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,560
Only if you don't know Tamil
it is a disgrace

1666
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,600
Then what happened?

1667
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,400
I lost my cool

1668
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,640
Where are you taking me?

1669
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,920
'You know what I did-'

1670
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,000
See for yourself

1671
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,240
You brought the roof down
for eating 1 fish of yours

1672
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,360
I've filled your tank
with 1 kg of fish

1673
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,720
Happy now?

1674
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,080
Not only did you digest
my expensive fish

1675
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,000
You filled this with some
random ribbon fish

1676
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,320
And converted my house
into a smelly fish market

1677
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,320
You want to know
if I am happy?

1678
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,800
Aiyo! It cost me 500 bucks

1679
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,120
Down the drain!

1680
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,920
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1681
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,480
I'm getting rebuked by her
day in and day out, dude

1682
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,880
These are all trivial problems

1683
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,760
I can make it alright
with my friendship

1684
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,480
Okay?

1685
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,360
Go ahead, drink

1686
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,520
Only alcohol won't do
for this situation

1687
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,200
Then?

1688
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,600
I need a song to cheer me up

1689
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,320
That's an easy request to fulfill

1690
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,160
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1691
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,040
Dude?

1692
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:24,640
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1693
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,000
Let's go join

1694
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,280
"Silly fool...dumbass"

1695
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,800
"Imbecile...jackass"

1696
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,360
"I was embarrassed, dude
Felt ashamed I goofed"

1697
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,920
"Nose cut and disgrace
It was a slap in my face"

1698
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,960
"I was so distraught
Like a chicken with head cut off"

1699
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,960
"After marrying her
I became a tattered underwear"

1700
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,520
"On her toe I slid the ring
on the day of my wedding"

1701
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,960
"I went on my bended knees
knowingly to appease"

1702
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,240
"I wore shirts made of snake leather
No more torture can I stand from her"

1703
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,960
"No need of wife
in my life"

1704
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,120
"What rubbish I say
She chased me away"

1705
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,840
"Like a shirt, casually
she discarded me"

1706
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,120
"What nonsense I say
She sent me away"

1707
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,880
"Like a shirt, indifferently
she dumped me"

1708
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:33,760
"Come and get the water ready
Pour the quarter real steady"

1709
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:40,720
"False, humbug of a life
All lies, hypocrite for a wife"

1710
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,160
"I was put to shame, dude
Felt awkward I goofed"

1711
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,920
"I brought myself disgrace
It was a slap in my face"

1712
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,880
"I was so overwrought
Like a chicken with head cut off"

1713
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,840
"After marrying her
I ended up as a tattered underwear"

1714
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,680
"I was embarrassed, dude
Felt humiliated I goofed"

1715
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,120
"I felt stupid, dude
Such a dumb thing to do"

1716
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,760
"I was put to shame, dude
Felt awkward I goofed"

1717
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,200

She'll bother you deep and steep"

1723
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,560
"She'll burst crackers
in heart's chambers"

1724
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,080

"She dumped me

1729
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,520
Divya...?

1730
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,560
Look who is here

1731
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,880
Chee!

1732
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,480
Why did she ignore me?

1733
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,560
I'll be back

1734
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,800
Divya, can't you say
a friendly hello to a guest?

1735
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,160
Why did you bring him here?

1736
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,400
I can't stand him

1737
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,400
Ask him to leave

1738
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,560
I didn't call him
He came of his own accord

1739
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,400
How can I ask
a guest to leave?

1740
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,800
That's your problem

1741
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,480
I want him out in 10 minutes

1742
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,960
One look at him
and I feel like puking

1743
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,000
He's here on some
important work

1744
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,000
He will stay just for
a week and then leave

1745
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,200
Let him be here till then

1746
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,320
His face, dress and
the way he speaks

1747
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,680
We have only 2 bedrooms here

1748
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,280
You are in one
I am in one

1749
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,760
He can sleep in the hall

1750
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,120
Rahul sleeps in the hall

1751
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,000
If he sleeps there and
Rahul gets all his diseases?

1752
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,520
Okay, I'll come up
with some excuse

1753
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,360
She was asking me
where I could buy meat-

1754
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,040
I'll add lots of ghee
and cook for-

1755
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,400
You heard her?

1756
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,680
You overheard everything?

1757
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,200
I'll try to convince-

1758
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,960
Am I some pig
that has got bird flu?

1759
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,040
For your dog to get
my contagious diseases

1760
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,840
One look at me and it seems
she feels like vomiting?

1761
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,040
Am I some public toilet
for her to puke with just one look?

1762
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,880
I'll talk and convince-

1763
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,720
Even if you ask me to stay
I won't stay in this place-

1764
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,000
Wait, I'll talk to her

1765
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,480
Dude, listen to me

1766
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,440
Don't get offended

1767
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,520
Bro...?

1768
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,560
She has had a change of heart, dude

1769
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,240
Yes, dear?

1770
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,640
Take your bag with you

1771
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:56,160
Even that may be contagious
and Rahul may fall sick

1772
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,320
You might as well give me
some poison and kill me

1773
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,000
Why are you upset?

1774
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,760
So what if she doesn't
let you stay here?

1775
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,720
I will make you stay
in this same place

1776
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,120
I don't have any objections
to you staying in my room

1777
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,960
But only after 12:30 at night
Viswam Iyer will come here after work

1778
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,600
You can come only after that

1779
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,600
That's okay

1780
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,160
Sait will get up at 3:00 a.m
to go for his early morning walk

1781
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,520
You must get up before that

1782
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,280
That's okay

1783
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,440
In between you can sleep
however long you want

1784
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,760
There is hardly an hour in between

1785
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,160
You have 1 whole hour, right?

1786
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,040
Hey Anjalai!

1787
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,200
Coming, dear

1788
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,560
That's his wife
Get into her good books
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1789
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,840
'Only stuff available
free for the asking is liquor'

1790
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,200
'Our friendship is like that'

1791
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,560
Will your father get
the snacks for the liquor?

1792
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,600
I'll bring it now

1793
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:40,320
Go and get it

1794
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,240
A watchman hits his wife
and has her under his thumb
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1795
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,920
Have you ever hit your wife?

1796
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,920
Not at all

1797
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,520
Some girls can be tamed
with love and hugs

1798
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,240
Some fall in line
only with blows

1799
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,160
Your wife falls into
the 2nd category

1800
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,760
Isn't it wrong
to hit your wife?

1801
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,320
A teacher hits the student
when he or she is wrong?

1802
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,880
Think of it that way

1803
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,520
Hit your wife

1804
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,320
Only then she will
come to heel

1805
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,560
After the way I strike her...

1806
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,000
...she should become
my eternal slave

1807
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,280
Here I come

1808
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,000
I'll show you who I am

1809
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,160
Oh! You are here

1810
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,640
Dog is in the place
meant for me

1811
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,760
Get lost!

1812
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,520
Don't you know how to
behave towards Rahul?

1813
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,160
Don't you know how to
behave towards your husband?

1814
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,720
You eat, watch TV
and sleep with this dog

1815
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,600
You might as well
have got married to a dog

1816
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,080
- Don't call him 'dog'
- Then what?

1817
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,120
His name is Rahul

1818
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,640
If you utter the word 'dog'
once more, I will kill you

1819
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,680
You'll kill me?

1820
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,040
I'll kill your bloody dog

1821
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,760
You had the guts
to hit my Rahul?

1822
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,160
Yes, so what?

1823
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,440
How dare you
hit your husband?

1824
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,440
'You thought I was a wimp?'

1825
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,120
'Where is she?'

1826
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,640
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

1827
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,400
Tell me

1828
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,960
I hit her
just as you told me to

1829
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,440
Daily morning 2 slaps
4 blows at noon

1830
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,120
6 hard knocks at night

1831
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,320
She'll come under your control

1832
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,600
You and your timetable!

1833
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,560
She has fainted with
1 single slap of mine

1834
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,680
She isn't opening her eyes

1835
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,080
I checked and she isn't breathing

1836
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,200
Her limbs are cold
and my heartbeat is on hold

1837
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,800
I think she may be dead

1838
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,920
'I told him to take my tips
as just an appetizer'

1839
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,600
'He took it like a buffet!'

1840
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,640
'Where the hell is he?'

1841
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,320
'Looks like he chased her
all over the place and hit her'

1842
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,200
'This place is in
a topsy-turvy mess'

1843
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,960
'How did he bottle up so much
anger and appear so calm?'

1844
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,040
'Where is he?'

1845
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,200
'What happened?'

1846
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,760
Good lord...dude

1847
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,800
Get up

1848
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:56,440
What's wrong?

1849
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,040
Hey! My best friend!

1850
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,360
Don't cry

1851
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,640
1st time murder
is always difficult

1852
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,160
We have this gunny bag and saw

1853
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
Let's chop the body into bits

1854
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,760
Tie the bag and dump it
into the river Cooum

1855
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,040
No one can find out

1856
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,160
Where is the body?

1857
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,320
Why?

1858
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,480
After I called you...

1859
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,480
...one last time I came
to check if she was alive

1860
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,760
I splashed a handful of water

1861
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,400
Like a tsunami
she lashed out at me

1862
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,360
She swirled and
twirled me all around

1863
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,560
My scalp...hair

1864
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,280
It hurts

1865
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,920
Don't

1866
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,680
So she is the one
who hit you

1867
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,040
Why?

1868
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,840
What did I tell you
all this while?

1869
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,120
You should be
careful only now

1870
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,920
If a wife starts
hitting her husband...

1871
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,720
...it will become a habit

1872
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,840
We shouldn't give room for that

1873
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,720
Hereafter make sure you wear
a helmet when you are at home

1874
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,840
Pad for your knees

1875
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,120
Gloves for your hands

1876
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,880
Preferably abdomen guard too

1877
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:18,880
She will attack at
all vulnerable spots

1878
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,640
Wipe your eyes

1879
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,960
We go to the police station

1880
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,360
We file a complaint against her
and we walk out immediately

1881
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,800
- Okay
- Let's go

1882
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,920
I think she is here

1883
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,680
Go...go

1884
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,200
You go
I'll follow

1885
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,000
You want me to go?

1886
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,440
Okay, I'll go

1887
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,320
Wait...wait

1888
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,000
Keep this for safety

1889
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,840
If I kill your wife
you won't feel sad

1890
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,320
Not one bit

1891
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,240
Let me see who wins

1892
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,520
What happened?

1893
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,600
They seem to be generous
with their blows, dude

1894
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,240
Why should you be scared?

1895
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,520
Hitting a female
isn't even a big crime

1896
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,240
It isn't as if we killed her

1897
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,840
We meet the inspector

1898
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,040
Tell him what happened
in a crystal clear manner

1899
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,240
And then walk out
in quick strides

1900
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,080
As if we don't know the law

1901
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:11,920
Very true

1902
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,200
Watch your step, sir

1903
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,800
Why are you tensed now?

1904
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,520
Sir, you are wanted inside

1905
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,040
Come, show him
what a big shot you are

1906
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,120
'Bad penny again!'

1907
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,520
Come in, bird brained Chinnasami

1908
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,680
You are also with him

1909
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,840
We are both good friends now, sir

1910
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,720
He gave the idea to hit you?

1911
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,720
Yes

1912
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,840
'She snitched'

1913
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,240
Did you hit your wife?

1914
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,720
Sir, I am not to blame at all

1915
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,360
She is the one
who hits me

1916
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,920
She stamps me
when she is angry

1917
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,360
- Then?
- Bites me often

1918
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,680
If a wife hits the husband
that isn't a case

1919
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:08,280
But the opposite
holds good as a case

1920
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,760
Your wife says you
were only arguing

1921
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,640
And it ballooned to blows
only because of him

1922
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,480
If he is the reason
for all this uproar...

1923
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,400
...you'll be freed and
he will be locked up

1924
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,160
But if you are
the reason for all this...

1925
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,440
...I'll file a case against you

1926
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,640
What do you say?

1927
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,360
Where's his hand?

1928
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,320
Between a husband and wife
there may be 101 differences

1929
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,800
A 3rd person stepping into
that space is wrong, no?

1930
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,400
Of course

1931
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,800
What you did was wrong, dude

1932
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:37,920
If I must choose between law and
friendship, law takes the upper hand

1933
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,400
According to your rules...

1934
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,320
...take whatever action
you want to take, sir

1935
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,040
What?

1936
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,480
Your husband has agreed
Shall I let him off the hook?

1937
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,480
No way

1938
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,720
Thinks he can get away?

1939
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,200
He has hit his wife

1940
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,360
He'll reform only if he spends
at least 1 night here

1941
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,240
If you don't register a case
I'll be forced to complain against you

1942
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,400
'She's the right fire
for this dragon of a cop'

1943
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,360
What arrogance!

1944
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,920
Sonny, your wife's case is very strong

1945
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,080
I have no other go but to
lock you up in our cell

1946
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,280
Sub inspector, take him to cell #1

1947
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,400
Come with me

1948
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,240
Don't forget my friend

1949
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,920
Where are you off to?

1950
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,720
Wait here

1951
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,280
'Started his act'

1952
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,280
'Time for me to unbutton my shirt!'

1953
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,440
Why are you taking off your shirt?

1954
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,280
If you remove your false moustache
I know you'll rip my shirt off me

1955
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,520
That's why I decided to
make it easy for you

1956
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,120
'He has got up'

1957
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,120
Why are you scared?

1958
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,000
'He'll enjoy bouncing me like a ball'

1959
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,360
I am not like how I was before

1960
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,200
If I fly in mid-air
I feel dizzy

1961
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,920
If I circle and hit
my sugar level rises

1962
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,680
If I stretch and hit
my knee goes for a toss

1963
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,320
My blood pressure is so high
I can't enjoy even a cup of coffee

1964
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,760
With all this
how can I hit you?

1965
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,480
Sub inspector?

1966
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,160
'All because of the sins
you accumulated'

1967
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,040
Take him to cell #2

1968
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:42,760
Come with me

1969
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:55,760
"Happiness unlimited
In my heart escalated"

1970
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,760
"Rainbows zillion altogether
flash and change in my favor"

1971
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,280
"New age man...!"

1972
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,240
He said I can watch TV
in there in cool comfort

1973
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,520
I just saw a ghost

1974
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,280
There's a silver colored
replica of you inside, sir

1975
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,440
That isn't a man
It's a robot

1976
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,600
I'm unable to hit
like I used to, right?

1977
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,040
I've loaded a program into it

1978
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,560
Don't worry

1979
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,360
He'll do the needful on my behalf
every step of the way just as I did

1980
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,920
Take him to the robot

1981
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,520
It will hit me ditto like you?!

1982
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,000
Let go of me

1983
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,640
Let go of me please

1984
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,200
I am robot

1985
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,200
Inspector Muthukaruppan is my boss

1986
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,560
My speed is 1 terahertz

1987
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,640
My memory is 1 terabytes

1988
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:45,600
You would have seen a robot
on TV, in the theatre, even on YouTube

1989
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,160
Have you ever seen one
face to face?

1990
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:47,680
Look now

1991
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,320
1 swift blow from me
1.5 tonne weight

1992
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,000
Watch me in action

1993
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,520
Egghead Siva is a wicked one

1994
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,360
I can't even bear
that cop's blows

1995
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,120
Imagine a robot-attack

1996
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,520
Not this

1997
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,720
Bring the robbery file

1998
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,120
Come in, sir

1999
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:39,840
Please sit down

2000
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,200
What brings you
all the way here?

2001
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,720
Just 1 call and
I would've come over

2002
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,040
You'll keep my son-in-law
and his friend under lock and key

2003
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,920
Who will come here
if not me?

2004
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,120
If my daughter registered
a complaint impulsively...

2005
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,800
...won't you make
proper enquiries?

2006
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,680
I wasn't even aware
he is your son-in-law, sir

2007
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,960
He didn't tell me either

2008
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,480
Advocate, look into
the case and do the needful

2009
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,920
Where is my son-in-law?

2010
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,920
Yov! Bring the boy

2011
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,000
Let go of me

2012
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,400
I'm just helping you

2013
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,200
Sorry, son-in-law

2014
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,080
If only you had told him
of our relationship...

2015
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,800
...he would have let you go

2016
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,280
Your daughter was the one
who pushed us in

2017
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,680
Let's talk this over at home

2018
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,080
No, I don't want to come, uncle

2019
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:17,760
For my sake

2020
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,120
Should my client
sign this report?

2021
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,160
Not necessary

2022
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,040
Dude, I'll take you
to the hospital

2023
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,520
Take your hands off me

2024
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,160
I didn't feel bad even when
your wife betrayed us

2025
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,680
But you snitched to the police

2026
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,200
My blood is boiling within me

2027
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,240
You've only seen me as
your friend Chinnasami

2028
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,520
You haven't seen me
as your enemy, right?

2029
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,440
You'll see from now on

2030
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,960
Hereafter you are my traitor
And I'm your enemy

2031
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,920
Going back to your village?

2032
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,480
Yes

2033
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,040
Go wherever you want

2034
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,240
But grant me a divorce
before you leave from here

2035
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:09,360
Instead of 2 people who
hate each other living like this...

2036
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,080
...we can get a proper divorce
and lead our lives happily alone

2037
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,760
Let us apply for divorce

2038
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:19,800
Girls in the city think divorce is as easy
as applying for a driver's license, right?

2039
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,120
It is not just a problem
between you and me alone

2040
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,200
It involves the prestige
of our respective parents

2041
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,840
And self respect of
both our families

2042
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,640
I can't live with you based on
self respect and prestige

2043
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,120
I am independent

2044
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,240
I will live according
to my wish only

2045
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:36,600
I need a divorce from you

2046
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,640
Now that you have initiated
this demand for a divorce...

2047
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,000
...I'll grant it

2048
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,840
But 1 condition

2049
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,880
Like how I stayed in
your house for a month...

2050
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,920
...you must stay in my house
for the same 30 days

2051
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,440
Why should I?

2052
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,520
When your wedding was stopped...

2053
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,280
...I agreed to marry you
to uphold my father's promise

2054
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,280
If I go back home alone now...

2055
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,400
...looking at my plight,
my parents will blame themselves

2056
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,800
They will be totally shattered

2057
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,840
If not for my happiness...

2058
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,400
...at least to please them

2059
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,840
...stay with us for 30 days
as a model daughter-in-law

2060
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:21,320
On the 31st day, I will myself
sign the papers for you

2061
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,680
1 month?

2062
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,760
I can't even stay
in your house for 1 day!

2063
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,480
Then I can't grant you divorce

2064
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,040
Do what you want

2065
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,640
1 minute

2066
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,200
If I do as you say...

2067
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,800
...will you grant me divorce?

2068
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,600
100%

2069
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,240
I'll come then

2070
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:56,680
But no one should know
about this problem between us

2071
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,920
Welcome home both of you

2072
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,680
Stand next to each other

2073
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,000
Bless you, dear

2074
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,640
May you always be happy

2075
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,960
Shakthi, you both go

2076
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,120
Father, you come with us

2077
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,120
Let's all go together

2078
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,840
Your mother and I visit our
family deity's temple every month

2079
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,360
It is a special function at the temple

2080
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,320
You both go

2081
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,080
Tell them, dear

2082
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,640
Please go happily together

2083
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,240
Take care

2084
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,240
Go, my dear

2085
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,520
(holy chant)

2086
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,400
Give me the plate
with your offering

2087
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,480
Anjali, wait

2088
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,040
My intention was
not to deceive you

2089
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,360
I was caught in a situation where
I could not defy my father's words

2090
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,840
The day you dumped me
for another girl...

2091
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,720
...I erased you from my heart

2092
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,280
Who is that girl?

2093
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,920
Shakthi was in love with her

2094
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,920
He married you because
of his father's decision

2095
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,880
That's why she is angry

2096
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,280
Hey! Let go of her
Who the hell are you?

2097
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,280
Let go of me

2098
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,160
Better get into the car

2099
01:41:56,120 --> 01:42:00,920
Vettaiya's henchmen have kidnapped
your son and daughter-in-law

2100
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,040
Vettaiya, come outside

2101
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:19,120
Thrash him and bring him out

2102
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,440
'Friendly appearance
VIVEK'

2103
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:41,560
Uncle, I'm not an egg fritter
to handle henchmen with kid's gloves

2104
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:46,720
I'm an anaconda that can
swallow even 1000 men at a time

2105
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:54,240
You're a scarey cat
who gets scared of a cat!

2106
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:55,840
You are quoting
punch lines on bravery!

2107
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,400
Why did you bring
my son here by force?

2108
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,760
Because I can't carry you

2109
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,360
You should have invited me
formally for your son's wedding

2110
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,120
You didn't and still without
holding a grudge against you...

2111
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,120
...I've brought him home
for the customary family feast

2112
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,000
What bloody custom?

2113
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,880
When my sister is still alive
the day you married another lady...

2114
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,880
...I severed all my connections

2115
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:19,800
I'll even give away my vest
if someone asks

2116
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:21,480
But I won't let go
of my family bond

2117
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,760
Vettaiya, you should have invited them
as per our custom for a family feast

2118
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,320
But not use force

2119
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:28,760
I used force even on
my wedding night

2120
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,400
So what do you expect from me?

2121
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,840
He won't listen to reason

2122
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,720
He needs to-

2123
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,760
Father, don't

2124
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,480
After all just a tradition
uncle is following

2125
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,400
We'll stay here for
a few days and come back

2126
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,560
How can you support him?

2127
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,040
Listen to me, please

2128
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm agreeing only because
my son wishes it

2129
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,840
In another 2 days
bring them back safe

2130
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,600
I will

2131
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,640
See you, uncle

2132
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,880
Shakthi, I will show you
our ancestral pride

2133
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,360
This is my grandfather Settaiyan

2134
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,160
He died while he was peeing

2135
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,600
How is that possible?

2136
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,600
He pissed on a railway track

2137
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,000
Hit and run by train

2138
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,720
How did he die?

2139
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,160
He isn't dead, dear

2140
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,320
This is him in the photo

2141
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,000
That was taken when
I had lots of hair

2142
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,520
This is your aunt senior

2143
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:15,720
Her name is Thangam

2144
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,560
This is your aunt junior

2145
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:18,760
She is Pushpam

2146
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,080
When I was touring China
I got this China doll for a low price

2147
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,080
Without her father's knowledge
I brought this chick back home

2148
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,080
I must introduce
one more person to you

2149
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:30,480
Hey! Pasupathy

2150
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,320
Coming, bro

2151
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,320
Look at my lion cub

2152
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:41,600
Bro?

2153
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,040
Who is this elderly gentleman?

2154
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,680
Don't call him 'elderly'

2155
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,920
He's my younger brother

2156
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,280
He's still a bachelor

2157
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:49,640
We are looking for a bride

2158
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:52,600
According to his horoscope
he will get a beautiful bride

2159
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:55,360
He lost his youth in this eternal
search for the perfect bride

2160
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,040
Doesn't matter
if he loses his youth

2161
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,040
Looks like he will
lose his old age also

2162
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,720
Uncle, how old is he?

2163
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,280
Come September
he completes 52 only

2164
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,880
Wait for another 8 years

2165
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,200
We can directly perform
what we call as '60th wedding'

2166
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,480
How can you ridicule him?

2167
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,480
Pasupathy, like a bullet
searing out of a gun...

2168
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,400
...show them how fast you can walk

2169
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,280
Why are you pushing
your tongue out, boss?

2170
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,280
It is pushing itself out

2171
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,240
How can a man who can't
even walk run a marathon?

2172
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,200
Not knowing
my body's condition...

2173
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,640
...my brother delivers
some punch line

2174
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,520
I am the sufferer in the end

2175
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,240
Instead of this wretched life
you might as well-

2176
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,800
Walk out of this house

2177
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,520
The money is all in his name

2178
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,560
That's true

2179
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,280
For 3 square meals a day...

2180
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:46,000
...I have to act more than
Kamal Haasan in 'Moondram pirai'

2181
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,760
Is someone there?

2182
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,720
Can anyone hear me?

2183
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,000
What happened?

2184
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,720
I can't open this door

2185
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,040
Pull from inside

2186
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:09,320
I'm not able to

2187
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,440
Even in the bathroom, huh?

2188
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,880
What 'in the bathroom'?

2189
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,400
When there's a youngster
who is a bachelor in this house...

2190
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,360
...why do you indulge
in youthful romancing?

2191
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,360
Who is that youngster?

2192
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,120
He is talking about himself

2193
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,520
Hair is now salt and pepper

2194
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,280
Body had added flab and kilos

2195
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,720
What can you do
if you get married now?

2196
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,320
I want to listen to
my son call me 'pa'

2197
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,320
If you have a son
he won't call you 'pa'

2198
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,040
He will only call you 'grandpa'

2199
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,560
He's calling me grandpa
when I am so full of youth

2200
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,960
He only said 'grandpa'

2201
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,200
Not anything else derogatory

2202
01:46:59,240 --> 01:46:59,920
Oldie

2203
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,920
She is calling you

2204
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,320
Not me

2205
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,040
I'm calling only you, oldie

2206
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,120
Can't you hear me?

2207
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:08,200
She's even implying I am deaf

2208
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:11,280
Turn back before
she asks if you are blind?

2209
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:12,960
What?

2210
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,280
You are jobless, right?

2211
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,240
You can repair that door

2212
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,640
Am I a carpenter?

2213
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,080
Looks like she will also say
'pipe has rusted, repair that too'

2214
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:27,040
Pipe is already rusted!

2215
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:31,640
Chicken, mutton, fish,
prawns, shark, crab

2216
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,120
What a spread!

2217
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,880
When you have the chance
eat to your tummy's content

2218
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,360
'Come, all of you'

2219
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,520
Shakthi, Divya, come

2220
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,160
My dear wives
serve everyone

2221
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,360
Pasupathy, how come
you are here?

2222
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,760
I came to eat

2223
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,640
What is on your leaf?

2224
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,360
Mutton

2225
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,960
You have high cholesterol

2226
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:56,440
You shouldn't even touch it

2227
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,160
What is that in your hand?

2228
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,200
Chicken, bro

2229
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:05,080
Only last week, doctor said,
your piles is lit up like a bulb

2230
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,000
How can you eat that?

2231
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,960
Now what is that?

2232
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,240
Sweet porridge

2233
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,320
'Payasam'

2234
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,440
Poor thing! Let him
taste at least that

2235
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,640
Shut up, you tamarind sack!

2236
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,800
His sugar is as high as 300

2237
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,560
If he eats all this, he will die
on the spot here, my beloved brother

2238
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:24,440
'Broadcast my ailments
to the whole town...'

2239
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:27,080
'...you made me a confirmed
bachelor, you bald monkey'

2240
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,000
Look, one look at the spice
and his eyes are watering

2241
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,920
Wretched body

2242
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,440
Unable to eat spicy food

2243
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,640
He has made you put
1 foot in the grave with his dialogs

2244
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,080
Why are you shaking?

2245
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:42,360
Hunger...I'm fainting

2246
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,440
Serve more gravy

2247
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,760
Eat some more, bro

2248
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,640
Serve him some mutton curry

2249
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:48,280
Okay

2250
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,560
Tender piece of
chicken for her

2251
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,560
She is so scrawny

2252
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:51,480
Serve her generously

2253
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,080
Did you serve them snail curry

2254
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,760
- Snail is only for you
- Is that so?

2255
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,840
Why only me?
Serve them too

2256
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,640
Why are you both
pecking at your food?

2257
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:06,000
My dear nephew, make a big
rice ball and feed your wife

2258
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,000
I'm telling you
to feed her, right?

2259
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,920
It's okay, uncle

2260
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,840
Don't hesitate

2261
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,120
Listen to your uncle

2262
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,520
Do as I say

2263
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,000
- Okay
- Do it now

2264
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,920
Yes, like that

2265
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,560
Some more

2266
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:22,640
My dear, why are you keeping quiet?

2267
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,320
Give him a big ball of rice

2268
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,600
He's your husband, right?

2269
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,400
Feed him

2270
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,160
No need, uncle

2271
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:28,640
Why are you defending her?

2272
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,600
Listen to your uncle
Feed him now

2273
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,640
That's it, right

2274
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,400
Feed properly

2275
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,280
You saw how romantic that is

2276
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:41,640
'Husband and wife
should feed each other'

2277
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,480
'Only then love will flow
and the family will bond'

2278
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,200
As if I did it deliberately

2279
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,760
Yes, it was deliberate

2280
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,720
He said so, fine
but why did you feed me?

2281
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,680
How can I say no to
an elderly gentleman?

2282
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,160
Does he behave like
an elderly man?

2283
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,440
He's a madcap of the 1st order

2284
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,360
Don't talk loudly
That egghead will walk in

2285
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,000
Didn't they serve you egg today?

2286
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,000
Don't worry, I'll ask them
to serve it for dinner

2287
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,600
Thangam, Pushpam

2288
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:03,960
Coming, dear

2289
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:08,880
No one in Tamil Nadu can beat me
in following family traditions

2290
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,200
Thangam, take Divya
and get her ready

2291
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,760
Sari and jewellery
are in that box

2292
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,760
Come, my dear

2293
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,040
Shall I get your nephew ready?

2294
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,040
She's made in China

2295
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,400
She may go in for a dual sim!

2296
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:20,120
My nephew can manage

2297
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,000
You don't have to

2298
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,600
- Take the dress
- Very important!

2299
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,440
Get ready

2300
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,040
- Pasupathy?
- Bro...?

2301
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,360
They are giving polio drops

2302
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,760
Go and get a dose

2303
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,360
Polio drops?

2304
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,640
What should be given at 5...

2305
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,400
...he wants you to take at 50!

2306
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:40,160
At this rate I doubt if you will
ever get married in this lifetime

2307
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,480
Are you suffering
from tuberculosis also?

2308
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,080
Is this epilepsy?

2309
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,480
This cot was bought
for my wedding night

2310
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,320
But others have rolled
and revelled in it

2311
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,720
'Others' means?

2312
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,560
I have myself had a go
with the maid on this cot

2313
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,640
Forget it

2314
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,400
If not today, at least
someday in the future...

2315
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:02,080
...I'll decorate this cot
with flowers and I'll lie on it

2316
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,360
No chance at all

2317
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,760
They might decorate you with flowers
and make your body lie on this cot

2318
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,920
Are you saying
I'll die a bachelor?

2319
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,040
Pasupathy?

2320
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,440
Bro?

2321
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,800
Decorated the cot
with flowers?

2322
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,840
Yes, bro

2323
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,960
Get my room also ready

2324
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,440
Why your room, bro?

2325
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:21,680
I ate mutton today
I am all fired up

2326
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,800
Ask your sister-in-law
to come to my room

2327
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,240
Which one...junior or senior?

2328
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,640
Why bug me
with questions?

2329
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,600
Both, naturally

2330
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,600
You are a youngster
You won't understand all this

2331
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,480
Calling you 'youngster'
a dime a dozen...

2332
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:34,240
...he has made you
the oldest member of this house

2333
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,600
1 minute
What is this?

2334
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,160
Almond milk
For your husband

2335
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,200
Enough

2336
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,400
Isn't it 'that' kind of pill?

2337
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,160
Yes

2338
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,640
Drink?

2339
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,360
- What?
- Milk

2340
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,600
Cow's milk

2341
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,800
Almond milk

2342
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,040
Almond milkshake

2343
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,200
Mixed with cashew

2344
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,280
Your wife asked me
to give this to you

2345
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,640
My wife?

2346
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:16,640
The fiery way he is walking away
after drinking this almond milk...

2347
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,280
...looks like he will definitely
dance a folk song with extra vigor

2348
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:29,640
"Little one, buttercup, bambino
Your lover wants to make out with you"

2349
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,160
"Get ready to dip your wick"

2350
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,600
"Bridge the gap double quick"

2351
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:46,760
"My 2 plaited endearing darling
Let's have twins in one go, coming?"

2352
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:50,840
"Do you feel shy, aiyo
to ask me to kiss you?"

2353
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,840
"Have a ball and skrog"

2354
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:58,920
"Bridge the gap and hog"

2355
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:04,360
"My 2 plaited endearing darling
Want twins in one go, willing?"

2356
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,400
"I am your cousin cum wifey dear
Loaded with love I'm waiting here"

2357
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:13,880
"Where your moustache pricks
kindly stitch up my lips"

2358
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,400
"Say bye bye to your shyness
Hug me tight all over, princess"

2359
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,440
"Let's burst raw fire crackers"

2360
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:24,040
"Angel face, papoose, sweetie
Your lover wants a quickie"

2361
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,760
"Shake the sheets with her"

2362
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:36,800
"Bridge the gap even if a millimeter"

2363
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:16,000
"Ready to sail a boat in your lip?
My lips are eager to take the dip"

2364
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:20,400
"Let's not be naughty, you minx
So say in angst my innocent lips"

2365
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:24,680
"If a girl says 'no' it means 'yes'
Now I won't miss to kiss my miss"

2366
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:29,320
"Kabadi game breathtaking fine
Holding breath, let's touch the line?"

2367
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:33,840
"This is a new typhoon, darling
To break it, shall we send a boat in?"

2368
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,480
"I waved my flag colored green
Go the whole way, Prince Charming"

2369
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,400
"On my eyes, nose, lips
you shower warm kisses"

2370
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,400
"I'm wet to the skin
and all the way within"

2371
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,120
"Precious, poppet, poopsie
Your lover wants to make babies"

2372
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:58,680
"Sweet heart, honey bunch, sugar bun,
Your lover wants to hit a home run"

2373
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,280
"Take me!"

2374
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,280
I didn't think you would
change your mind so soo-

2375
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:14,040
Enough of acting like we are
a happy, newlywed couple

2376
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,760
Go and sleep on the floor

2377
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:20,040
Why should I?
I'll sleep up here only

2378
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,240
If you want
you sleep on the floor

2379
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,840
You think you can sleep
in the same bed with me?

2380
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,120
You dare push me down?

2381
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,240
I will-

2382
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,280
One minute

2383
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,200
What happened, boss?

2384
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:22,480
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

2385
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,040
If he was playing cricket...

2386
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,200
...just by running he'll score
a century and make India win

2387
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,320
As if this is important!

2388
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,240
Let's go and see
what's happening inside

2389
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,840
Isn't it wrong to
be a Peeping Tom?

2390
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,600
After a certain age
all you can do is only watch

2391
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,120
Get up

2392
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,360
Come on, get up

2393
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,800
Only if you lift me
can I get up

2394
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,040
You need help for this?

2395
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,200
What is this?
Something is spinning

2396
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,520
- That's a fan
- Really?

2397
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:00,120
He's coming

2398
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,320
My chest!

2399
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,720
- How many times?
- 30

2400
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:28,040
He hasn't even pissed
that many times

2401
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,120
Did he ask you
all these details?

2402
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:35,120
Is that why your wife mixed
'that' tablet in the milkshake?

2403
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,200
She added a tablet?

2404
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,040
Why did you pour
water all over me?

2405
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,680
You're happily sleeping
after doing this to me?

2406
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,000
Why did you mix
laxative in my milk?

2407
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:52,280
Your nutcase uncle
prepared a feast

2408
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:54,760
Gave almond milkshake
and decorated our room

2409
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:57,720
I did it for my safety
thinking you might rape me

2410
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,640
As if I can't rape you
if I drink this milk

2411
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:02,000
I'll rape you right now

2412
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,360
Let me go

2413
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:05,360
Pah!

2414
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:08,520
You think I'll be quiet
while you rape me?

2415
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,240
I'll murder you!

2416
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,200
You want to stab
your own husband?

2417
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,440
I'll stab you
What will you do?

2418
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,680
Stab me
Let's see

2419
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:16,480
Don't!

2420
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,760
I caught it

2421
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,840
Don't throw that

2422
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,800
What is this sound?

2423
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:32,880
'Oh no...uncle'!

2424
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:45,360
Husbands and wives can fight

2425
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:48,000
But not to the extent of
breaking another man's head!

2426
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,880
Whoever made the mistake
apologize to each other now

2427
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:58,480
What is this?

2428
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:01,120
You're saying it
like you are strangers

2429
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,280
Hug each other
and apologize

2430
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,920
Uncle, this won't work

2431
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:10,920
He is hesitant

2432
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,720
Obey your uncle's words
Hug him and apologize

2433
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,800
I'm your father's brother
Better listen to me

2434
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,320
What is this?

2435
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,080
You're refusing to hug her
like she's some third person

2436
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,640
She's yelling at me
and walking away in a huff

2437
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,320
Your life together
hasn't even begun

2438
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,080
What is the problem?

2439
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:46,160
Uncle, we didn't come here
to start our lives together

2440
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,280
Our married life
is a closed chapter now

2441
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:53,880
We are a couple
for just another month

2442
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,600
After that, we go
our different ways

2443
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:59,200
Without knowing this,
you played Cupid with your feast

2444
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:02,200
My parents don't know
we intend breaking up

2445
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,360
Please don't tell them

2446
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,880
Adjust with your husband
and make him happy, dear

2447
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:15,040
- We'll see you, uncle
- Okay, my dear nephew

2448
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,400
1 minute

2449
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,520
Everyone wants a husband
like Lord Rama and a wife like Sita

2450
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,680
But even Rama and Sita were
united after plenty of hassles

2451
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,680
It's hard to live with a husband

2452
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:33,040
But it's harder to live without one

2453
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,360
You thought so much
about breaking up

2454
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:37,960
Why don't you think just once
of getting back together?

2455
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,400
There's nothing more
for me to add

2456
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,280
Both of you try to
understand each other

2457
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,840
Think of living happily together

2458
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,480
Divya, after my father it was me

2459
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,160
After me, you'll be standing
in our town election

2460
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,760
Why are you thinking?
Aren't you okay with it?

2461
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,640
Father?

2462
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,920
Why are you forcing her to stand?

2463
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:13,520
Shakthi, our municipality has
become a ladies' constituency

2464
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,000
That's why I want Divya to stand

2465
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,840
You can ask my aunt
or sister to contest, right?

2466
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,920
What are you saying?

2467
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,160
My sister and yours are
married into another family

2468
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,400
Divya is part of our family

2469
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,720
Isn't she our next in line?

2470
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,720
That's why I asked her

2471
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,280
Not that-

2472
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,440
Will you be quiet?

2473
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,520
Divya, you tell me

2474
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,600
What, my dear?
Are you okay with it?

2475
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,760
Yes, uncle

2476
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:41,920
Wow!

2477
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:44,120
I'm so thrilled

2478
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:47,280
Shakthi, your responsibility
to make her win

2479
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,000
Here, give it

2480
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:54,680
Dude, are you still angry?

2481
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,880
We just went and
filed our nomination

2482
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,520
How is our combination?

2483
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,440
Are you rubbing it in my face?

2484
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:04,720
What did you tell me
the other day?

2485
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,520
You wouldn't stand against me?

2486
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,720
- Now why are you doing it?
- Get lost!

2487
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,880
Even now, I'm not doing it

2488
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,880
My wife is standing

2489
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:16,600
In Mahabarata war, Arjuna
did not stand against Karna

2490
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,960
Krishna made him do so

2491
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:20,280
That's what you've done

2492
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,400
Maybe Karna lost the war

2493
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,640
But in this battlefield
Chinnasami won't lose

2494
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:28,000
If Chinnsami smiles
it is quite insignificant

2495
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,800
If he explodes, it is
like a jumbo elephant

2496
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:31,800
- If you don't burst?
- Mew like a cat!

2497
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,760
Who was that?

2498
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,560
'Let me cut down
your food for 2 days'

2499
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,040
'Already starving for 4 days'

2500
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:38,920
Who is qualified in your house
to oppose my wife?

2501
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,800
Most of your family is illiterate

2502
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,320
The rest can't see

2503
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:47,120
Your grandma who studied up to 2nd grade
and chews betel leaves all the time?

2504
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,760
Not that party
Your beauty

2505
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:08,080
Uncle, why should we
talk to useless fellows?

2506
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:10,480
I like that, my precious

2507
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,680
Come, let's file
our nomination

2508
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,600
Chinnasami 'anna'

2509
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,160
Won't you talk to me also?

2510
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:28,000
I don't talk to those who are
too drunk or too educated!

2511
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,600
Because both are dangerous

2512
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,680
'My dear voters'

2513
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,680
'I bring you good news'

2514
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,360
'Our party's symbol
is a cell phone'

2515
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,800
'Please vote for
cell phone symbol'

2516
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:46,800
'Our symbol
is cell phone'

2517
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:48,360
Silence

2518
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:52,680
To solve your problems
vote for my wife Divya

2519
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,680
Please ensure she wins

2520
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,880
Thank them

2521
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:56,960
Your vote

2522
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,160
Only for Divya Shakthi

2523
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,320
Dear voters
young and old

2524
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:08,280
Our party's symbol
is a slipper

2525
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,240
If you vote for this slipper...

2526
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:12,200
...groceries will be
delivered at your door

2527
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,520
I vouch for it
sure and proper

2528
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,400
Name my baby to
make a worldwide impact

2529
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:22,800
Name him Aircel
for a worldwide reach

2530
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:24,960
Girl baby, bless her
with an ethnic Tamil name

2531
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,240
Aircelvi

2532
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,280
Unusual name

2533
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,960
Keep this without anyone knowing

2534
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,120
Thank you very much

2535
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:30,960
Move...move

2536
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,920
Long live!

2537
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:32,920
Did you see that?

2538
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,440
He's naming the baby
and bribing the daddy

2539
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:39,320
By making his symbol popular
he's making you a dummy figure

2540
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,520
Really?

2541
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:42,200
Get a baby ready

2542
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:45,880
It'll take 10 months
and need a girl as well

2543
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:47,720
What about the bedroom?

2544
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:48,840
Thank you, leader

2545
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,920
Have I come here to campaign
or to be your hustler?

2546
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,600
I'll bite your ear
and rip it apart

2547
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,800
Go and get me a baby

2548
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,880
Give me your baby

2549
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,080
- Why are you grabbing my baby?
- To name the baby

2550
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,400
We've named our baby already

2551
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:01,520
You'll be paid for it

2552
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,200
Then okay

2553
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,680
- Money...?
- Take it on the stage

2554
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,480
This baby has to be
named by you it seems

2555
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,160
It is the mother's wish

2556
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,240
Is that so?

2557
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:13,360
Where is the mother?

2558
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:14,000
There

2559
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:15,080
Oh! She's here

2560
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,160
Why are you carrying her?

2561
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:18,600
He carried the baby

2562
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,840
She was alone
So I brought her

2563
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:22,880
Shouldn't separate
mother and son, right?

2564
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:25,320
See how strong I am
even at this age

2565
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:26,120
Put her down

2566
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,440
You go and stand there

2567
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,480
Your face irritates me

2568
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:31,560
Go now

2569
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:35,240
'He won't let me be happy
even for a minute!'

2570
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:37,560
A mother wants her-

2571
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,160
- Darling?
- Hey, behave!

2572
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,520
- Girl or boy?
- Boy

2573
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,960
I name him Paragon

2574
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,760
That's a slipper brand

2575
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:51,760
If you can accept Shahrukh Khan
why can't you agree to Paragon?

2576
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,160
Try this name and he'll be
more famous than Shahrukh Khan

2577
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,960
Thank you so much
for opening my hotel

2578
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:07,320
You must be the first to eat here

2579
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:07,920
Sure

2580
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,960
Come in, bro

2581
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,120
We call more people than this

2582
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:15,120
And tomorrow you will
open it with the same fanfare!

2583
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:18,120
We welcome our honorable
chief guest Chinnasami...

2584
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:21,480
...with open arms
and warm hearts

2585
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,400
Come, leader

2586
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,440
Cut the ribbon, leader

2587
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:32,840
Here you go

2588
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,840
- What is this?
- It's a dummy

2589
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,280
- Open it
- Cheapo!

2590
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,360
'New paid public toilet'

2591
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:51,400
You called me
to open a toilet?

2592
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:53,160
Yes, he opened a hotel

2593
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,960
We've opened a toilet
opposite that hotel

2594
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,880
Everyone who eats there
will come here to crap

2595
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,120
We'll collect the votes here

2596
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:00,160
We'll post in Facebook
our leader crapping

2597
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,280
Silence

2598
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:02,960
Leader has to go first

2599
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,760
- You do your job
- My job?

2600
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,120
Yes, he opened the hotel
He was the 1st customer to eat

2601
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:10,360
You opened the toilet
So you 1st go do your big job

2602
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,440
I already did my job,
1st thing in the morning

2603
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,760
You've opened it
At least go pee

2604
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,640
You're saying it like
'having come, drink some tea'

2605
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:18,760
Are you human?

2606
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,840
He won't listen to us

2607
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,280
Just make him sit in there

2608
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:24,600
Only symbol to get
endorsed by the people

2609
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,520
Cell phone

2610
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:27,800
Only symbol to be
supported by beggars

2611
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:28,840
Slipper!

2612
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,680
I'm cautioning the Central Govt

2613
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:32,520
If he warns Delhi...

2614
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:35,600
...I challenge American
autocracy and monopoly

2615
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,160
We are standing for
a local election

2616
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,200
Why are you bringing
in America into this?

2617
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,080
You are new to politics

2618
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:45,080
The minute you join, you must
condemn America, China and Pakistan

2619
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:47,120
Only then we'll rise
in their estimation

2620
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,720
There is enough for everybody
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

2621
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,520
Be patient

2622
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,080
Get a quarter and
a packet of 'biriyani'

2623
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:53,240
And vote for us

2624
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:57,920
Look at how his party members
are squabbling for food

2625
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:00,520
They are not his party members

2626
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:02,080
They are ours

2627
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:07,200
(Liquor drinking is injurious to health)

2628
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:19,360
We ask for 'biriyani'
even at funerals

2629
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,480
As if we will spare
the electoral candidate?

2630
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:22,400
Get it

2631
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:27,680
They're disrespecting the party flag
we have safeguarded for 25 years

2632
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:30,080
Look at your father

2633
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,680
Making an ass of himself

2634
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,840
'Aiyo! He saw'

2635
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,400
- Leader
- Dance!

2636
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,600
That's our symbol

2637
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,960
Don't demean it

2638
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,840
Why are they eating
in his stall?

2639
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,240
We are also serving food here

2640
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,720
You're serving
curd rice and pickle

2641
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,400
He's giving a quarter and 'biriyani'

2642
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:51,880
Fat hopes!

2643
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
As if he will distribute free 'biriyani'

2644
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:57,080
He's hiding an egg in tamarind rice
and fooling everybody

2645
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,640
Each plate has a leg piece, boss

2646
02:08:58,720 --> 02:08:59,680
I won't believe it

2647
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,160
I'm telling you I ate it
and you won't believe me?

2648
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,560
You were with me
the whole time

2649
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:05,800
When did you go eat?

2650
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,280
When I went to pee,
I sampled just for taste

2651
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,160
Son of a glutton!

2652
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,440
Go there now and-

2653
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:13,520
I'll bring our men back?

2654
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:15,240
No, get me a parcel of 'biriyani'

2655
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:15,920
Boss...!

2656
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,920
If it tastes good,
we'll hire the same cook!

2657
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,840
You keep talking like this
and we'll have to disband the party

2658
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,160
It will automatically disband

2659
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,120
What?

2660
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:26,520
On election result day

2661
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:27,400
Tell me, boss

2662
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,640
We'll see who wins

2663
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:29,800
Okay, fine

2664
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:44,720
'Counting for Tenkasi election
has commenced now'

2665
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,560
You won't even
get back your deposit

2666
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:57,600
You've come to
find out the results, huh?

2667
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:02,720
I've paid Rs 200 a house
to prevent that from happening

2668
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,320
I gave each vote Rs 500, moron

2669
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,320
500 bucks a vote?

2670
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,280
It's true, son

2671
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,840
How can you be so sure?

2672
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,200
Even I accepted it

2673
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,320
Who did you vote for?

2674
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,440
You wasted wastrel!

2675
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,360
'In the 1st round of counting,...'

2676
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:29,080
'Divya Shakthi with cell phone
as symbol is leading by 1500 votes'

2677
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:35,080
This is why I told you right then
not to select slipper as a symbol

2678
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,080
Did you listen to me?

2679
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:37,440
Hasn't your slipper hit you?

2680
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:40,200
You talk so much, now you know
the way to your grave

2681
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:40,880
Wait

2682
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:44,880
'At the end of 13th round of counting
Divya Shakthi is leading by 5000 votes'

2683
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,840
We are lagging by 5000 votes

2684
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,080
He'll obviously lead in his area

2685
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,960
Similarly we will lead
in our area for sure

2686
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,320
He is leading in
our area as well

2687
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,480
Shut up, rascal

2688
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:56,480
You're talking too much

2689
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,240
Stand in my shoes
Then you'll know

2690
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:00,560
You're irritating me

2691
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:02,880
Get up and go!

2692
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,520
- I'm your father
- What bull!

2693
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,880
You took his money and
you call yourself my father?

2694
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,240
You cheap fellow!

2695
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,800
'In the local election
held at Tenkasi...'

2696
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,480
'...contesting Divya Shakthi
with cell phone as symbol'

2697
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:19,440
'...Anjali with slipper as symbol
has won by 7432 votes'

2698
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:27,920
Burst the crackers!

2699
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,520
Votes from his caste
made him win at last

2700
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:37,240
"Will this victory do
Do you want more, dude?"

2701
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:38,120
Wait

2702
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:41,200
Let's celebrate in style

2703
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,600
- Stop!
- Don't

2704
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,480
Keep quiet, dude

2705
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,880
Don't act too big for your boots...

2706
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:47,000
...just because you won

2707
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,120
You didn't win

2708
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,760
He made you win

2709
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,520
'Last night at 10:00 p.m'

2710
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:11,240
We are anyway
on a winning spree

2711
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,600
Why are you changing it?

2712
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:14,200
It isn't for us to win

2713
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,640
This is to make Anjali win

2714
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:16,960
What are you saying?

2715
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,880
She lost in love

2716
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:21,680
Let her at least
win the election

2717
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,360
What will you
tell your father?

2718
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,280
Let him not know

2719
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:26,200
Go

2720
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:27,520
He lost and made you win

2721
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,240
Are you trying to
add insult to injury?

2722
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,120
This family has been
winning for 25 years

2723
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:42,040
And you made us lose, rascal

2724
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,760
She came into our family
trusting you totally

2725
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:47,120
How did you have
the heart to make her lose?

2726
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,840
Answer me

2727
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,280
How dare you do this?

2728
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:56,880
Did you think how upset
she would feel?

2729
02:12:57,880 --> 02:12:59,000
Don't interfere

2730
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:02,680
You didn't make your wife lose

2731
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,280
Me...my self-respect

2732
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,840
And my family's prestige

2733
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:08,360
Our people had faith in us
for all these years

2734
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:09,960
And you made us lose it

2735
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:14,360
You're bothered about
losing the election

2736
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:17,400
I have lost my whole life, father

2737
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,280
What are you saying?

2738
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:27,240
We didn't come here as
a made for each other couple

2739
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:29,200
We came here
after constant fights

2740
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,360
She's here only to get
my signature for a divorce

2741
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,760
God help us!

2742
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:34,880
What's this, dear?

2743
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:45,000
I married her only to preserve our
family's prestige and your self-respect

2744
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:50,240
But from that moment onwards
I wanted to live happily with her

2745
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:53,280
If she doesn't like
something about me...

2746
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:54,440
...I can change myself

2747
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:57,600
But she doesn't like me one bit

2748
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:03,440
You asked me to marry her
so her life won't be in shambles

2749
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:06,920
But because I married her
she thinks her life is ruined

2750
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,680
Instead of winning the election
and living here unhappily...

2751
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:15,800
...she is better off living alone
and happy in the city of her choice

2752
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:17,800
That's why I rigged the votes

2753
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,440
A husband and wife should
live with harmony intact

2754
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,680
Not pretend and act, father

2755
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:26,240
That's why

2756
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,560
I have decided to
grant her divorce

2757
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,680
What are you saying?

2758
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,800
I'm shocked hearing this, my dear

2759
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:38,040
Please don't take
any hasty decisions

2760
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,600
Stay here for some more days

2761
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:41,040
He's a good boy

2762
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,840
You'll understand him
very well, I'm sure

2763
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:46,040
If you still don't like him
we'll ourselves send you home

2764
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:47,280
Mother...?

2765
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:49,840
She is already here for
a month under duress

2766
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,000
Listen to me

2767
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,320
When you are newly married...

2768
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,040
...it's normal to have
difference of opinion

2769
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,880
The creases will get
ironed out gradually

2770
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,520
Better to free her from
the ties of being my wife

2771
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,920
And let her lead a life
of her own choice

2772
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,800
After all this, if you force us
to live together...

2773
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:06,440
...neither of us will be happy

2774
02:15:07,120 --> 02:15:09,560
Why don't you convince them?

2775
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:13,280
Meenatchi, our decision was wrong

2776
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:15,920
It is their life

2777
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,440
Let them decide
how to lead their lives

2778
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:23,040
You do what you feel is right, dear

2779
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,280
You came here and stayed for
a month because I asked you to

2780
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:57,480
This is the paper you wanted

2781
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:23,120
Oh my God!

2782
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:25,440
How could you do this to us?

2783
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:39,200
'I never even dreamt this boy
would do something like this'

2784
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,200
'We don't know what happens
behind closed doors of the wealthy'

2785
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:44,480
'This boy was too impulsive'

2786
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,080
What happened?

2787
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,360
I don't know how to
break the news to you

2788
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,320
What has happened?

2789
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,680
What can I say?

2790
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,680
You go in and see

2791
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:02,920
Meenatchi, what happened?

2792
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,600
If I had known
he would do this...

2793
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:07,560
...I would've somehow
begged her to stay

2794
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:09,760
But he chose this way out

2795
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:18,720
Hey! What is this disguise?

2796
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,960
I didn't get the girl
I fell in love with

2797
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:26,240
Nor the girl I got married to

2798
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,280
So I decided to
renounce life

2799
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:36,960
'Till now'

2800
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:41,400
'Today'

2801
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:44,160
A new assistant commissioner
has come to interrogate you

2802
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:46,240
Who is that?

2803
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:49,320
"A lion with momentum
He is Duraisingam"

2804
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:54,840
You...?

2805
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:58,360
Wherever I go, you come
with a bag of problems

2806
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,480
Your wife has lodged
12 cases against you

2807
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:07,400
In what way did you torture her
for her to retaliate like this?

2808
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:09,600
I granted her divorce
because she wanted it, sir

2809
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:11,720
You'll immediately grant it, huh?

2810
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,560
Instead of advising me against it

2811
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,240
Trying to become a martyr?

2812
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:16,360
I love you

2813
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,480
I want to live with you

2814
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:19,680
But I won't fall at your feet
and beg forgiveness

2815
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:21,080
That's why I lodged a complaint

2816
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:22,920
Will you live with me
or go to jail?

2817
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
She has registered
a false complaint

2818
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:26,040
First lock her up, sir

2819
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,840
Let's see who goes to jail
You or me?

2820
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:28,840
Sir, lock him up

2821
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,040
When she has gone to this extent
I'll also see where this ends, sir

2822
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:33,520
I don't mind the expense

2823
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,000
When you've come
to this conclusion-

2824
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,000
I'll also see this through
one way or the other

2825
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,320
If you don't lock her up
I'll go up to High court

2826
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,920
I'll go to the Supreme court

2827
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,400
Go, let me see
what you can do

2828
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:43,680
Silence...!

2829
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:47,080
Bro, sit down

2830
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,840
You take a seat too, madam

2831
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:53,080
Your arguments are very trivial

2832
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,760
You blew it out of proportion
by over reacting

2833
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:59,680
If you have a problem with him
don't fight with him

2834
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:00,800
Call me

2835
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,880
Whatever the problem
I'll solve it for you

2836
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:04,760
Both of you
note down my number

2837
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:10,080
You can call me anytime

2838
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:11,960
Now go home
without fighting

2839
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:15,280
Inspector, drop them
at their residence

2840
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:20,240
I have done my best
and acted as mediator

2841
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:22,400
Let us see how
happily they live

2842
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:28,040
Shall we take a selfie?

2843
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:34,120
Why did you take it off?

2844
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:35,120
Don't you know...

2845
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,360
...when I'm angry and feeling
very romantic, I take it off

2846
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:38,360
I know

2847
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:40,320
Today is our 25th
wedding anniversary

2848
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:42,560
Let's have a night
to remember

2849
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:46,040
Who is calling
at this time of the night?

2850
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:48,160
I'm Divya speaking

2851
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:50,240
He raises his hand at me
if the 'dosa' isn't cooked

2852
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:52,040
Will someone hit
for such a silly reason?

2853
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:53,400
Let me talk to him

2854
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:55,720
How can you do this, son?

2855
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,200
That wasn't 'dosa'
But 'idli'

2856
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,160
Sir, she's making 'idli' on
a frying pan meant for 'dosa'

2857
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:01,600
Give the phone to her

2858
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:04,240
How can you do this, ma?

2859
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:06,760
Sir, he is just lying
through his teeth to you

2860
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:08,360
Let me talk to him

2861
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,520
How can you mistake
a 'dosa' for an 'idli'?

2862
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,840
Don't I know the difference
between a 'dosa' and an 'idli'?

2863
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,520
She's throwing the phone, sir

2864
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,400
Now she's flinging a plate, sir

2865
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:20,320
I will definitely hit her, sir

2866
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:22,960
Don't be in a rush

2867
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,440
A wife is like the idol
inside a temple

2868
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,480
Look who is talking!

2869
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,800
Husband is like the priest

2870
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:31,200
Husband should pray to the idol
Not indulge in idle fights

2871
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:33,000
I'm praying correctly

2872
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,440
She's pillow-fighting with me!

2873
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:36,000
Give her the phone

2874
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,120
Here you are, I will-

2875
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:43,360
A wife is like a lamp

2876
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:45,520
The husband is like the wick

2877
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:47,880
You must light the wick
only after adding oil to the lamp

2878
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:49,880
Plain wick if lit
will burn to bits

2879
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,120
Should not fight

2880
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,080
I won't spare him
He is hitting me now

2881
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,240
He hit you?

2882
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:55,680
Let me talk to him

2883
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:00,280
Sir, she's hitting me like WWF

2884
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:03,600
In all these 25 years
of married life...

2885
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,600
...my wife and I haven't
fought even 1 day

2886
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:10,280
We believe in 'give and take'
And so the light in our love shin-

2887
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:16,240
Talking to you, just now dawned
on me it is dawn now!

2888
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,800
Disconnect the damn phone

2889
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:24,760
Don't touch me

2890
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,760
I'll tear you to pieces

2891
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,160
You and your goddamn
new groom look

2892
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:30,440
Don't...I will kill you

2893
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,160
My Manju has trampled my heart

2894
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:36,960
This is Mohammed Ali
Plus 3 more terrorists with him

2895
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,880
Muthukaruppan, I believe
your wife left you and ran away

2896
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,760
She got a divorce from me

2897
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:47,120
We should terrorize
the terrorists and nab them

2898
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:50,040
That's why we convened
this special meeting

2899
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,640
Mr Muthukaruppan,
switch on your phone

2900
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:58,080
Just inform you're in
a meeting and switch it off

2901
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,240
I'm Divya here

2902
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,440
I'm in an important meeti-

2903
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,360
Give it to me

2904
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:09,800
Sir, I'm Shakthi here

2905
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:12,920
Bro, I'm in an important meet-

2906
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,880
More important than that is
she didn't add salt in my breakfast

2907
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:23,240
Is that a crime?

2908
02:22:23,320 --> 02:22:26,440
I'm saying something so important
and you are being so irresponsible

2909
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:27,880
You call yourself a cop?

2910
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,320
I'm not a police officer

2911
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:30,320
I am a rowdy

2912
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,600
Rowdy

2913
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,000
I'm trying my best
to be patient

2914
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:34,880
And you're torturing me
with tonnes of calls?

2915
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,360
Am I a pickle
for your love-play?

2916
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:38,120
She's trying to stab me
with a knife, sir

2917
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,520
I'll myself stab you with a knife

2918
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:41,440
And kill her also

2919
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,360
She is throwing
tomatoes at me

2920
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:45,360
I'll throw a bomb in your house

2921
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,520
She's trying to kill me
with the 'dosa' ladle, sir

2922
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:49,960
Why should she kill you?

2923
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:53,320
I'll myself shoot you

2924
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:55,160
I'll shoot you

2925
02:22:55,240 --> 02:22:57,320
I'll shoot you!

2926
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:58,720
I'll rain bullets on you!!

2927
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:00,960
I've emptied the whole magazine

2928
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,440
If you call me once more
I'll come in person and stamp you

2929
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:05,560
Stamp you

2930
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:06,560
Trample all over you

2931
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:29,880
I can't tolerate
your bad behavior

2932
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,680
I'll meet Muthukaruppan sir
and complain about you to him

2933
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:34,000
Who are you to complain?

2934
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,200
I'll complain
Come with me

2935
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:36,080
Get lost

2936
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:37,920
Come what may
I need a solution

2937
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:42,040
Muthukaruppan has become
as black as coal

2938
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:44,440
We were on our way to see you

2939
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,680
You know what she did-

2940
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,400
You shut up

2941
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,520
You know what he did

2942
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:48,440
Shut up

2943
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:49,600
Stop it!

2944
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,680
You know what you both did

2945
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,360
What harm did I do to you?

2946
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:55,880
I wanted to unite you

2947
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:57,280
My wife left me

2948
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,600
I consoled myself thinking
my police job was intact

2949
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:04,640
Usually they transfer me

2950
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,320
Now you made them dismiss me

2951
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:10,160
Not one assistant commissioner

2952
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:14,080
Even if 100 of them come
they can't reach a compromise

2953
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,120
Come, my little prince

2954
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:22,240
Why did you stop?

2955
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:25,200
You would have seen a lion
in the forest, a photo

2956
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:26,920
Or Discovery channel on TV

2957
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:30,280
You might have even seen a furious
avatar in the film directed by Hari

2958
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:34,120
Have you seen a lion go begging
for a single glass of tea?

2959
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:35,720
Look over there

2960
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,280
"Wonder who is your mother?"

2961
02:24:38,360 --> 02:24:41,000
"Wonder who is your father?"

2962
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:46,360
"He is a family deity
Townsfolk bow with piety"

2963
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:48,080
Give me money

2964
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:49,160
Give me alms

2965
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,120
Don't interfere in
a husband and wife's affairs

2966
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,840
They will make your life hell

2967
02:24:55,720 --> 02:24:57,840
Why is he on reverse mode?

2968
02:24:58,640 --> 02:24:59,960
Give me money, da

2969
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,720
Give me...give

2970
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:03,880
Why are you hitting me?

2971
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:05,240
I don't have any coins

2972
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:06,640
Come back tomorrow

2973
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:09,960
Bloody beggar! You don't
even know beg-ethics!

2974
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:10,880
Get lost

2975
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:12,720
Give me alms

2976
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:14,080
However loony he may be...

2977
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,000
...he doesn't forget to hit me

2978
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:19,040
Looks like he has really become mad

2979
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,440
You made him a lunatic

2980
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,560
You both fought and he lost it

2981
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,360
But how did you get these 2 kids
in the midst of all your fighting?

2982
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:30,480
1st time we fought
and he mediated

2983
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:32,560
And his wife left him

2984
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:34,040
That's when he was born

2985
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:36,720
17th time we fought
and he mediated

2986
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,120
When he lost his job

2987
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:39,800
That's when she was born

2988
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:41,600
That wasn't 17th
it was our 20th fight

2989
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:42,880
No, dear
It was the 17th time

2990
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:44,400
No, I know
20th fight

2991
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:46,440
'They are ready
for the next baby'

2992
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:47,680
Whom will you listen to, dude?

2993
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:48,600
Me or her?

2994
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:49,840
Whom will you listen to, bro?

2995
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:50,640
Me or him?

2996
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:51,760
Dude, listen to me

2997
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,160
Bro, hear me out

2998
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,240
A deer that trotted
in front of a tiger

2999
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:00,360
A man who interfered
when a couple fought...

3000
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:02,560
...have not lived happily
in the history of the world

3001
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:04,840
Example is that egghead

3002
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:05,640
Get lost!

3003
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:09,560
Fighting between a couple is a game

3004
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:11,200
We shouldn't step into that space

3005
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,920
Only watch the fun from outside

3006
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,200
That is life

3007
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:22,280
