1
02:38:35,036 --> 02:38:36,928
Scream more,

2
02:38:36,938 --> 02:38:39,531
No matter how many patients
will escape from this hospital,

3
02:38:39,541 --> 02:38:43,768
just because you're screaming,
I'll merge their bill in your account.

4
02:38:43,778 --> 02:38:45,704
This is Dr. Ghunghroo.

5
02:38:45,714 --> 02:38:50,875
A huge hospital belongs to him, But
still today he can't cure of his neck.

6
02:38:50,885 --> 02:38:53,180
Exactly,
It is his sickness,

7
02:38:53,255 --> 02:38:57,182
Automatically his neck's turning
around, like it changes its meaning.

8
02:38:57,192 --> 02:38:58,850
Look at this,

9
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:00,619
Good Morning, Sir!
Good Morning,

10
02:39:00,629 --> 02:39:04,369
I came here for your personal
secretary' job.

11
02:39:07,702 --> 02:39:09,702
Bastard!

12
02:39:11,506 --> 02:39:14,165
She is such a strange and
stupid girl.

13
02:39:14,175 --> 02:39:16,468
Not stupid, she is a decent girl.

14
02:39:16,478 --> 02:39:18,970
Ghunghroo, Whenever some
girl slaps you, then you must

15
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:21,473
she belongs to a good and
decent family.

16
02:39:21,483 --> 02:39:23,483
Shall we go, now!

17
02:39:24,619 --> 02:39:29,414
Dr. Ghunghroo is going to meet a
girl for his nephew name Rajeev.

18
02:39:29,424 --> 02:39:32,917
Even, until today he rejects more
then 500 proposals,

19
02:39:32,927 --> 02:39:36,588
Because he's looking for a nice
and decent family.

20
02:39:36,598 --> 02:39:38,923
And how much that family is decent,

21
02:39:38,933 --> 02:39:42,333
He have his own style to know
this truth.

22
02:39:42,771 --> 02:39:45,997
Look, It doesn't matter that
you want to be our relatives but...

23
02:39:46,007 --> 02:39:48,767
I can't deceive a good people
like you,

24
02:39:48,777 --> 02:39:52,570
Actually, I am a doctor but I'm
involved in bad business too, and

25
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:55,378
my nephew is such a bad guy.

26
02:39:56,918 --> 02:40:02,953
Drinking, Gambling, Racing, Drugs,
Truly we're not able for your family.

27
02:40:05,293 --> 02:40:07,185
Are you shocked?

28
02:40:07,195 --> 02:40:11,022
Just to show you some decency,
I wear a Jodhpuri coat,

29
02:40:11,032 --> 02:40:14,225
I can't breathe just because
of this coat.

30
02:40:14,235 --> 02:40:17,062
And what you talking about
bad business,

31
02:40:17,072 --> 02:40:19,537
We had done more than enough.

32
02:40:21,543 --> 02:40:23,768
There is not another bad guy
better than us.

33
02:40:23,778 --> 02:40:27,093
Amazing, Pandit Jee.
That is not enough.

34
02:40:27,449 --> 02:40:29,874
My father is in jail since
last 5-6 years.

35
02:40:29,884 --> 02:40:32,143
That Minister's son,
What's his name?

36
02:40:32,153 --> 02:40:34,873
Whatever, He supplied him drugs.

37
02:40:35,056 --> 02:40:37,549
Mr. Harilal, you recognize us
very fine.

38
02:40:37,559 --> 02:40:40,194
Wow,
It's a real talk, Tell him.

39
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:46,224
Amazing, Pandit Jee.
You found us a good family.

40
02:40:46,234 --> 02:40:50,462
And if you're talking about parties,
My girl is always on Page 3.

41
02:40:50,472 --> 02:40:52,468
I like that.

42
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:56,044
Nowadays, It is the culture.
Mr. Ghunghroo.

43
02:40:57,345 --> 02:41:02,874
If some girl don't have a boyfriend,
then people don't call her HOT.

44
02:41:02,884 --> 02:41:06,010
You're right, but she doesn't look
HOT.

45
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:10,270
Don't Insult me like this Uncle Jee,
You wanna see?

46
02:41:11,259 --> 02:41:13,259
See!

47
02:41:14,062 --> 02:41:16,521
Did you see?
She is hot, isn't it?

48
02:41:16,531 --> 02:41:18,390
Mother!

49
02:41:18,400 --> 02:41:22,560
Why you slap the pandit?
Because we that family which...

50
02:41:22,570 --> 02:41:27,337
members haven't seen prison
nor a police station's face.

51
02:41:30,578 --> 02:41:35,707
He needs a family who didn't have a
single black spot on their character.

52
02:41:35,717 --> 02:41:38,543
That's why his nephew (Rajeev)
Is still virgin.

53
02:41:38,553 --> 02:41:42,751
OK, OK.
Try it again, Try it.

54
02:41:45,794 --> 02:41:48,262
Very nice, baby.
Very nice.

55
02:41:49,564 --> 02:41:51,689
You did well,
I was trying since last 2 hours.

56
02:41:51,699 --> 02:41:53,224
And you done in 2 minutes.

57
02:41:53,234 --> 02:41:56,861
A girl who marry with him, She
will live a happily married life.

58
02:41:56,871 --> 02:42:01,032
He's roaming to carrying a bat,
But he didn't find a baller yet.

59
02:42:01,042 --> 02:42:04,335
He found a lot of ballers,
But his Uncle Dr. Ghunghroo...

60
02:42:04,345 --> 02:42:08,473
He's such a strange empire,
Every ball is no ball, dead ball...

61
02:42:08,483 --> 02:42:10,642
Why you're embarrassing Rajeev?

62
02:42:10,652 --> 02:42:12,977
Come over here,
It's time to cut a cake.

63
02:42:12,987 --> 02:42:15,112
Come on.
Lets go, Lets go.

64
02:42:22,297 --> 02:42:26,391
Son, This rocket isn't straight,
It could enter anywhere,

65
02:42:26,401 --> 02:42:29,971
Let it fly straight,
Uncle, It's my rocket,

66
02:42:30,171 --> 02:42:32,197
If I will fly it curve shape,
then it will fly straight.

67
02:42:32,207 --> 02:42:36,882
Look, If you will keep it straight,
It will go straight,

68
02:42:36,978 --> 02:42:40,548
All right, Keep fixing them.
Get back Gopi.

69
02:42:40,748 --> 02:42:42,748
Uncle!

70
02:43:02,604 --> 02:43:06,174
Uncle, What you've done?
You burn them all.

71
02:43:19,687 --> 02:43:21,687
Save her,

72
02:43:22,023 --> 02:43:23,348
What happened?
Somebody is inside?

73
02:43:23,358 --> 02:43:25,350
Our friend, Sanjana,
Please help her.

74
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:29,695
Uncle, you go inside, It's
happening because of you.

75
02:43:33,902 --> 02:43:35,902
I am going,
I am going,

76
02:44:17,445 --> 02:44:20,675
It's too late,
Why she didn't come yet?

77
02:44:47,542 --> 02:44:49,542
Sanjana, what happen?

78
02:44:49,677 --> 02:44:51,887
Poor guy,
Come on, Lets go.

79
02:44:53,514 --> 02:44:55,974
Why so much smile on uncle face?

80
02:44:55,984 --> 02:44:57,984
What happened inside?

81
02:45:15,103 --> 02:45:16,661
Fire!

82
02:45:16,671 --> 02:45:18,671
What?
Fire! Fire!

83
02:45:48,002 --> 02:45:49,293
Come Aunt!

84
02:45:49,303 --> 02:45:52,964
I'm watching you since two days
you are thinking of that girl.

85
02:45:52,974 --> 02:45:54,974
You are in love.

86
02:45:55,643 --> 02:45:57,535
Yes!

87
02:45:57,545 --> 02:46:00,705
I feel first time in my life
when I saw a girl that

88
02:46:00,715 --> 02:46:02,715
she just made for me.

89
02:46:03,584 --> 02:46:06,644
When I close my eyes,
I only see her,

90
02:46:07,588 --> 02:46:10,308
When I open them,
I only see her,

91
02:46:11,292 --> 02:46:14,182
I feel, I just thinking about her.

92
02:46:15,363 --> 02:46:20,123
Aunt, Just prey for me, that
I meet her again, just once.

93
02:46:21,069 --> 02:46:23,194
She will definitely meet you,

94
02:46:23,204 --> 02:46:28,219
But we have to prey that her
family don't have a black spot.

95
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:41,780
Bhai, everything is clear,
Just come.

96
02:46:49,263 --> 02:46:51,263
This is Uday Shetty,

97
02:46:51,799 --> 02:46:53,799
Brother of Sanjana,

98
02:46:54,302 --> 02:46:58,196
He wants to be an Actor,
But he became a Gangster.

99
02:46:58,206 --> 02:47:02,796
But when he saw in the mirror
His inside actor woke up.

100
02:47:07,381 --> 02:47:09,381
He have only one dream.

101
02:47:09,550 --> 02:47:13,120
His sister should marry in a
decent family.

102
02:47:13,554 --> 02:47:17,804
But why any decent girl
would marry a Don's sister?

103
02:47:18,059 --> 02:47:22,787
That's why to talk with decent
people, He have his own style,

104
02:47:22,797 --> 02:47:25,189
Look, We have everything,
A god has given us.

105
02:47:25,199 --> 02:47:27,919
We have money, fame,
and respect.

106
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:35,433
I have a kind of respect, If I
wants to relate any family who

107
02:47:35,443 --> 02:47:37,268
could not deny me.

108
02:47:37,278 --> 02:47:40,838
I need only a good family,
I need a decent guy.

109
02:47:40,848 --> 02:47:44,342
But Pandit Jee couldn't tell us
about your business briefly.

110
02:47:44,352 --> 02:47:47,412
You didn't tell them about business.

111
02:47:48,022 --> 02:47:50,572
What should I?
Sanjana Airbase?

112
02:47:51,492 --> 02:47:55,292
Yes! Yes! Sanjana Airlines,
Sanjana Textiles,

113
02:47:56,931 --> 02:48:00,501

We have a large business.

114
02:48:01,502 --> 02:48:05,196
It's establish, now it's
all running on phone.

115
02:48:05,206 --> 02:48:08,175
Sir!
I bring you a very good news.

116
02:48:09,143 --> 02:48:14,328
Not a single but two news, If you

117
02:48:14,715 --> 02:48:16,541
Sir, It a very big good news.

That Dhansukh's murder case
was running on you, that's finish.

120
02:48:24,025 --> 02:48:27,652
Witness knows that, If he will
give vouch against you then

121
02:48:27,662 --> 02:48:30,154
you will finish his entire family.

122
02:48:30,164 --> 02:48:32,723
And builder took his
police complain back.

123
02:48:32,733 --> 02:48:34,733
He wants settlement.

124
02:48:34,769 --> 02:48:40,209
He gave 2 crores and he will pay
you remaining 3 crores in court.

125
02:48:47,548 --> 02:48:50,608
Who were those people?
Who walk away.

126
02:48:50,985 --> 02:48:52,985
Go and ask them,

127
02:48:55,590 --> 02:48:57,815
They bring the proposal for
Sanjana,

128
02:48:57,825 --> 02:48:59,950
But where they came from?

129
02:49:00,127 --> 02:49:04,292
We call them from Mumbai,
Also force you lie them.

130
02:49:06,534 --> 02:49:09,694
Now which decent family
remains in this city...

Sorry! Sorry! Sir,

Where I am sited? From whom

134
02:49:20,248 --> 02:49:24,742
Don't understand...
Control, Control Uday.

135
02:49:25,786 --> 02:49:29,951
Hey Ballu, tell him, What I do

Come outside,

145
02:54:21,415 --> 02:54:23,415
Nobody will move,

146
02:54:24,118 --> 02:54:26,118
Come outside,

147
02:54:27,288 --> 02:54:29,583
Freeze! Freeze!

148
02:54:34,962 --> 02:54:37,555
Nobody will move from his side,
Freeze!

149
02:54:37,565 --> 02:54:39,890
Brother! What's going on?
Don't you see Brother is making

150
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:41,900
a picture,
Bhai?

151
02:54:44,605 --> 02:54:49,110
Is this the way to make painting?
Who's your mad Bhai?

152
02:54:56,483 --> 02:55:00,053
He's the Majnu Bhai!
Who Majnu? He's a Don.

153
02:55:07,728 --> 02:55:09,728
You are so lucky,

154
02:55:10,764 --> 02:55:14,759
If I carry a brush some day,
Didn't carry a gun,

155
02:55:15,436 --> 02:55:18,662
Otherwise you should dead,
I was saying that...

156
02:55:18,672 --> 02:55:21,799
You don't need to make this
accident. Even painting is a

157
02:55:21,809 --> 02:55:26,144
work of Imagination.
They must be a stupid Painters,

158
02:55:27,047 --> 02:55:29,512
I am painting directly, live.

159
02:55:31,018 --> 02:55:34,418
If you call it in English,
Live Painting,

160
02:55:34,822 --> 02:55:37,514
Last week, He was asking to
people on the bridge that

161
02:55:37,524 --> 02:55:39,516
did they know how to swim,
Whoever say Yes, he threw

162
02:55:39,526 --> 02:55:41,018
him from the bridge,

163
02:55:41,028 --> 02:55:44,428
He wants to make painting a
swimming man.

164
02:55:44,932 --> 02:55:48,058
Hey, Don't count,
Otherwise It will be less,

165
02:55:48,068 --> 02:55:51,762
If you didn't make it well then
your family member would cry,

166
02:55:51,772 --> 02:55:53,772
He don't have a family.

167
02:55:56,877 --> 02:55:58,877
He didn't marry yet,

168
02:56:00,214 --> 02:56:02,406
Is he wants to marry or not?

169
02:56:02,416 --> 02:56:06,110

175
02:56:26,373 --> 02:56:29,366
Uday Bhai, I am calling you
from a long time, and

176
02:56:29,376 --> 02:56:31,376
You turn Umbani off,

177
02:56:31,945 --> 02:56:34,638
Today, I finish F.M. Hussain's game,

178
02:56:34,648 --> 02:56:37,116
What?

179
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:45,816

180
02:56:45,826 --> 02:56:47,484
Bhai!
Yes!

181
02:56:47,494 --> 02:56:50,020
May I ask you a question?
Go on,

182
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:53,324
Sanjana is your real sister?
More than real,

183
02:56:53,334 --> 02:56:55,768
Yes, but,
Is she real?

184
02:56:57,204 --> 02:57:00,764
I'm so black and she's white,
That's why you're asking,

185
02:57:00,774 --> 02:57:03,133
Shankar Shetty married twice,
My father (Shankar Shetty).

186
02:57:03,143 --> 02:57:05,502
Yes He married two times,
But...

187
02:57:05,512 --> 02:57:07,304
our sanjana's can't marry once,
What do you mean once?

188
02:57:07,314 --> 02:57:10,474
We wants to marry her once,
But that's not happening,

189
02:57:10,484 --> 02:57:12,524
But It would happen now,

190
02:57:13,187 --> 02:57:17,012
Your problem's solve in that
painting of mine,

191
02:57:19,293 --> 02:57:22,438
Do you see that guy?
Where is the guy?

192
02:57:23,464 --> 02:57:25,844
That guy sits on the bonnet,

193
02:57:27,401 --> 02:57:29,401
Where is the bonnet?

194
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:32,170
Under the guy,

195
02:57:33,807 --> 02:57:36,537
Yes!
He is such a decent guy,

196
02:57:37,578 --> 02:57:40,871
These decent guys are so bad,
They don't understand decency,

197
02:57:40,881 --> 02:57:44,475
For that reason,
I'll solve this matter by myself,

198
02:57:44,485 --> 02:57:48,679
I'll get his Kundli tomorrow and
I'll talk to his family in my style,

199
02:57:48,689 --> 02:57:52,916
And you don't interfere,
Then marriage must happen, Go.

200
02:57:52,926 --> 02:57:55,586
Since you start the boutique, you
didn't show me the accounts,

201
02:57:55,596 --> 02:57:57,976
I'm going to beauty parlour,

202
02:57:58,198 --> 02:58:03,293
Go, when I'm talking about account,
you start missing your parlour,

203
02:58:03,303 --> 02:58:05,303
Waste my money,

204
02:58:07,508 --> 02:58:10,313
Hello!
Ghunghroo, how's your work?

205
02:58:11,278 --> 02:58:15,698
Business is going well and there
is raining of money,

206
02:58:15,816 --> 02:58:18,609
And you don't want to fall
some drops on us,

207
02:58:18,619 --> 02:58:20,577
I need 4 khokha (crores)

208
02:58:20,587 --> 02:58:25,315
Listen, this is boutique and we
sell ladies dresses not khokha,

209
02:58:25,325 --> 02:58:27,790
You idiot,
Khokha means Crore,

210
02:58:28,429 --> 02:58:31,023
Oh! Crore and you want 4,

211
02:58:32,466 --> 02:58:36,291
Did your father left them here
or your Mother?

212
02:58:38,138 --> 02:58:41,793
Heh! Diwali's cracker,
I'll burn you up now,

213
02:58:42,142 --> 02:58:46,137
Do you know, who you are
talking to? Majnu Bhai,

214
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:49,506
Have you heard my name?
Sure, you told me twice,

215
02:58:49,516 --> 02:58:51,175
Majnu Bhai speaking,
Majnu Bhai,

216
02:58:51,185 --> 02:58:53,905
What should I do?
Are you insane?

217
02:58:55,022 --> 02:58:58,449
I think, I have to finish you,
I'm asking you extortion money,

218
02:58:58,459 --> 02:59:00,839
In English,
Protection money,

219
02:59:00,894 --> 02:59:03,104
Oh!
So you need protection?

220
02:59:04,064 --> 02:59:08,125
Do one thing, you bring me 4 crore
and I'll give you protection,

221
02:59:08,135 --> 02:59:10,861
And if you want 4 shoes to eat
then call me again,

222
02:59:10,871 --> 02:59:14,832
If I didn't turn you Laila from Majnu
then I'm not Ghunghroo anymore,

223
02:59:14,842 --> 02:59:17,817
Put the phone down,
He's abusing me,

224
02:59:27,788 --> 02:59:31,528
Hey! Come outside,
Shop is closed from today,

225
02:59:33,927 --> 02:59:36,052
Get away,
What's going on?

226
02:59:41,268 --> 02:59:44,061
You will turn our Majnu Bhai

227
02:59:44,071 --> 02:59:47,726
Get Ghaghra from there,

231
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:15,893
If I knew that you're on phone,
Should I say that?

232
03:00:15,903 --> 03:00:17,943
Then what would you say?

233
03:00:22,175 --> 03:00:25,035

Otherwise they must be 6 Crores,

03:05:44,464 --> 03:05:46,464
Ghunghroo Jee!
Jee?

305
03:05:46,833 --> 03:05:49,092
Please don't call me Jee,
Don't say a word,

306
03:05:49,102 --> 03:05:53,196
Nowadays biscuit calls Parley Jee,
And you are a doctor,

307
03:05:53,206 --> 03:05:55,131
You know, I attend poor people
without any charges, that's why

Look at him,

Shetty, I didn't know that
he's your guy,

311
03:06:04,684 --> 03:06:07,983
He's my friend,

312
03:06:11,424 --> 03:06:15,164
Then he's like my elder,
That was my mistake,

313
03:06:15,662 --> 03:06:19,742
What's going on here?
Your work has done, you go.

314
03:06:20,500 --> 03:06:23,900
Sir, should I give him a slap,
I want to,

315
03:06:25,438 --> 03:06:28,431
I'll never forget your debt,
No, It's not like that,

03:06:28,441 --> 03:06:30,500
Yes, It is,
You are such an angel.

Decency is still in this world,
No, I am nothing,

318
03:06:33,713 --> 03:06:37,368

We have money, fame,

333
03:07:17,590 --> 03:07:20,216

03:07:20,226 --> 03:07:22,419

03:07:22,429 --> 03:07:25,489
You're agreed,
Then, I am also agree,

03:07:25,765 --> 03:07:28,325
Look, you gave me a word
I won't take them back,

337
03:07:28,335 --> 03:07:31,650
We are respected people,
And we mean it.

338
03:07:34,808 --> 03:07:37,103
Mr. Ghunghroo,
Listen to me,

339
03:07:38,178 --> 03:07:40,570
I want to tell you about
Mr. Shetty,

340
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:43,725
What you would tell me?
I've seen him,

341
03:07:44,084 --> 03:07:46,379
He's not human but Bhagwan.

342
03:07:50,190 --> 03:07:53,420
Come on Pandit,
Today is the lucky day,

343
03:07:53,660 --> 03:07:56,286
I am telling you, It's not
your lucky day.

344
03:07:56,296 --> 03:07:59,055
What happen Uncle?
You are smiling today,

345
03:07:59,065 --> 03:08:02,459
I fixed your marriage in a nice
people, If you heard them you

346
03:08:02,469 --> 03:08:06,124
will loose your senses,
Tell him Pandit Jee,

347
03:08:08,541 --> 03:08:11,533
Truly, He is such a decent man,

348
03:08:12,912 --> 03:08:15,717
He's not a decent but a murderer,

349
03:08:16,616 --> 03:08:19,676
His morning starts with the bullets,

350
03:08:20,253 --> 03:08:24,014
And Until If he didn't kill 10-12
people his night did not over,

351
03:08:24,024 --> 03:08:26,024
What rubbish?
I Swear,

352
03:08:26,126 --> 03:08:28,126
Shetty is a Don,
Don?

353
03:08:30,663 --> 03:08:35,508
Majnu and Shetty traps you
together, you don't understand,

354
03:08:39,672 --> 03:08:43,157
I have a bad luck,
You broke the steering,

355
03:14:14,307 --> 03:14:16,432
Don't look at them like that,

356
03:14:16,442 --> 03:14:19,669
These all people came here to
enjoy, to play, to laugh,

357
03:14:19,679 --> 03:14:23,072
But not like us to think how
to get rid of those bad guys,

358
03:14:23,082 --> 03:14:25,887
Blame to me,
You also blame to me,

359
03:14:26,586 --> 03:14:30,780
If you were there, May be we
should finish or your marriage

360
03:14:30,790 --> 03:14:32,515
was happened on gun point,

361
03:14:32,525 --> 03:14:35,840
You didn't think about before,
Now what?

362
03:14:36,095 --> 03:14:40,175
You can't judge people,
You are absolutely right,

363
03:14:41,100 --> 03:14:43,480
If I do, Should I marry her,

364
03:14:43,936 --> 03:14:48,066
Stop it, I am dying and
you guys start fighting,

365
03:14:49,642 --> 03:14:52,957
Just think, what will happen to me,
How?

366
03:14:53,613 --> 03:14:58,574
I can't think to the front of her,
I have go away from here,

367
03:14:58,584 --> 03:15:02,579
My money is wasting?
And my mind is not working,

368
03:15:37,890 --> 03:15:40,525
These half naked people,
Rajeev!

369
03:15:43,563 --> 03:15:47,089
I got an Idea, and they
can't do nothing of us,

370
03:15:47,099 --> 03:15:51,179
I met a girl, whom I was
looking for a long time,

371
03:15:53,506 --> 03:15:55,898
You found a new trouble
for me,

372
03:15:55,908 --> 03:15:59,168
She is not trouble,
she is the solution of trouble,

373
03:15:59,178 --> 03:16:00,837
Do one thing,

374
03:16:00,847 --> 03:16:04,574
Just try to make her falls in
love with you then marry her,

375
03:16:04,584 --> 03:16:06,879
Then I'll excuse to Shetty,

376
03:16:07,553 --> 03:16:11,147
I want my nephew to marry
with your sister but...

377
03:16:11,157 --> 03:16:14,982
He was a scoundrel,
He married 3 months before

378
03:16:14,994 --> 03:16:16,994
without my permission.

379
03:16:17,763 --> 03:16:20,256
Now no matter what,
He is the big Don,

380
03:16:20,266 --> 03:16:23,893
Will he marry his sister with
someone who's already married,

381
03:16:23,903 --> 03:16:27,473
Look at the girl,
Uncle, I don't wanna see,

382
03:16:27,874 --> 03:16:30,533
You know why I don't want to
Please explain him,

383
03:16:30,543 --> 03:16:34,028
How do I?
I don't want to listen anything,

384
03:16:48,895 --> 03:16:53,995
And one of the big reason is
that she belongs to good family,

385
03:17:02,842 --> 03:17:06,102
Majnu Bhai!
If Sanjana will see this picture

386
03:17:06,112 --> 03:17:09,852
then your character would be
naked like this,

387
03:17:10,016 --> 03:17:13,841
Don't think about her,
I came here for change,

388
03:17:36,242 --> 03:17:41,441
We got a news that some terrorists
had planted a bomb here,

389
03:17:45,952 --> 03:17:48,417
Stop, stop,
please don't move,

390
03:17:48,588 --> 03:17:50,913
We really don't know that
where is the bomb,

391
03:17:50,923 --> 03:17:54,918
May be under that table,
maybe inside that ball,

392
03:17:56,295 --> 03:17:59,610
and it will blast because
of your panic,

393
03:18:59,692 --> 03:19:03,093
Look, We make you April fool
very easily,

394
03:19:08,701 --> 03:19:11,494

398
03:19:39,699 --> 03:19:42,892
Sanjana, I think you didn't
recognize me,

399
03:19:42,902 --> 03:19:47,577
Why not? You are the same guy
who save me from the fire,

400
03:19:51,777 --> 03:19:55,171
Even you save me, I was
unconscious and carry me.

401
03:19:55,181 --> 03:20:00,026
It's not my fault, Any body can
go out of mind to see you,

402
03:20:00,252 --> 03:20:02,632
What's a date today?
1 April,

403
03:20:03,522 --> 03:20:08,452
Are you making me April fool?
No, I am not, May I help you,

404
03:20:08,694 --> 03:20:12,349
My height is larger than you,
I'll help you,

405
03:20:34,253 --> 03:20:38,280
Whenever I go near to her,
Don't know where this air come from,

406
03:20:38,290 --> 03:20:42,115
It's girl's scarf, you can't get it
so easily.

407
03:20:44,997 --> 03:20:48,907
Now I didn't get relief until
I got this scarf.

408
03:20:56,308 --> 03:20:58,308
It's nothing,

409
03:21:16,362 --> 03:21:19,082
Sanjana, Dropati's Saree's here,

410
03:21:30,643 --> 03:21:32,168
Enough...

411
03:21:32,178 --> 03:21:34,178
You're just...

412
03:21:57,036 --> 03:21:59,586
You're nephew can't set
a girl.

413
03:21:59,738 --> 03:22:02,998
And this Udhay Shakti is
calling constantly.

414
03:22:03,008 --> 03:22:05,467
I don't understand.
What should I do?

415
03:22:05,477 --> 03:22:08,137
What else can we do?
Besides praying to God.

416
03:22:08,147 --> 03:22:10,147
Oh Lord help me.

417
03:22:16,689 --> 03:22:18,899
What kind of help is this?

418
03:22:22,595 --> 03:22:24,486
Where did he go?

419
03:22:24,496 --> 03:22:26,496
Listen.

420
03:23:33,265 --> 03:23:35,265
What a place. Right?

421
03:23:35,734 --> 03:23:37,626
Udhay Brother.

422
03:23:37,636 --> 03:23:38,594
Yes Majnu.

423
03:23:38,604 --> 03:23:39,728
Everything alright?

424
03:23:39,738 --> 03:23:41,897
Upstairs death angel
and downstairs too.

425
03:23:41,907 --> 03:23:45,567
That Ghungroo is missing.
I've been looking everywhere.

426
03:23:45,577 --> 03:23:48,297
And he's not answering his
phone.

427
03:23:50,983 --> 03:23:52,908
I tensed.
You come back quick.

428
03:23:52,918 --> 03:23:54,276
How can I come Udhay Brother?

429
03:23:54,286 --> 03:23:56,145
Who is going to take care
of Sanjana Madam?

430
03:23:56,155 --> 03:23:59,748
Don't worry about Sanjana.
She has her friends with her.

431
03:23:59,758 --> 03:24:03,052
They'll take care of her.
You come back quick.

432
03:24:03,062 --> 03:24:05,062
That Ghungroo Saith...

433
03:24:08,634 --> 03:24:10,634
You had this shoe...

434
03:24:19,745 --> 03:24:21,745
Who is it?

435
03:24:22,348 --> 03:24:24,340
Hey fruit without a tree.

436
03:24:24,350 --> 03:24:25,708
If you want to suicide.
Then fall straight.

437
03:24:25,718 --> 03:24:27,042
Or shall I make you fall?

438
03:24:27,052 --> 03:24:29,778
Are you measuring the length
by throwing a shoe?

439
03:24:29,788 --> 03:24:33,783
Why are you holding it?
Through it in the water.

440
03:24:55,347 --> 03:24:56,772
Where?

441
03:24:56,782 --> 03:24:58,782
Oh behind me!

442
03:25:03,722 --> 03:25:05,847
Not the April fool again.

443
03:25:07,092 --> 03:25:09,897
Oh blind folded...
I'll sneak out.

444
03:25:24,676 --> 03:25:26,676
Got you!

445
03:25:28,213 --> 03:25:29,505
Oh You...

446
03:25:29,515 --> 03:25:31,640
Actually we were playing.

447
03:25:31,984 --> 03:25:33,409
It's okay.

448
03:25:33,419 --> 03:25:34,676
Are you upset with me?

449
03:25:34,686 --> 03:25:35,944
No...
Not at all.

450
03:25:35,954 --> 03:25:38,347
I think I can see it on your
face.

451
03:25:38,357 --> 03:25:39,948
Why wouldn't you be upset?

452
03:25:39,958 --> 03:25:42,117
Because we made April fool.

453
03:25:42,127 --> 03:25:43,719
No...
It's nothing like that.

454
03:25:43,729 --> 03:25:45,387
I also like pranks.

455
03:25:45,397 --> 03:25:48,797
I can also prank you.
But I didn't do it.

456
03:25:49,034 --> 03:25:51,244
Then we'll get along fine.

457
03:25:52,604 --> 03:25:54,129
Come...
Let's have coffee.

458
03:25:54,139 --> 03:25:56,264
No...
Coffee with you! No.

459
03:25:57,042 --> 03:26:00,782
You made me April fool already.
I can't come.

460
03:26:01,914 --> 03:26:02,938
Where is your necklace?

461
03:26:02,948 --> 03:26:04,773
Where did it go?

462
03:26:04,783 --> 03:26:05,774
It was on my neck just now.

463
03:26:05,784 --> 03:26:07,576
Was it expensive?

464
03:26:07,586 --> 03:26:09,211
It must be at least 3 million.

465
03:26:09,221 --> 03:26:11,261
Find it.
Look over there.

466
03:26:19,398 --> 03:26:21,398
Look over there.

467
03:26:24,303 --> 03:26:27,278
Sanjana, Look there's your
necklace.

468
03:26:29,441 --> 03:26:31,441
Thank God.
I found it.

469
03:26:32,778 --> 03:26:34,778
I'll get it.

470
03:26:52,898 --> 03:26:54,123
Where did he go?

471
03:26:54,133 --> 03:26:56,133
Did he drown?

472
03:27:20,993 --> 03:27:22,551
What are you looking for?

473
03:27:22,561 --> 03:27:25,621
You! Did you
lose the necklace again?

474
03:30:28,380 --> 03:30:30,380
Okay Uncle.
I'm leaving.

475
03:30:31,883 --> 03:30:33,475
You're going out!
Do you want me dead?

476
03:30:33,485 --> 03:30:34,409
Why?
What happened?

477
03:30:34,419 --> 03:30:37,579
Nobody should know that
we've come back.

478
03:30:37,589 --> 03:30:39,314
Stay in.

479
03:30:39,324 --> 03:30:41,583
Uncle I'm going to meet
Sanjana's brother.

480
03:30:41,593 --> 03:30:46,353
You said it yourself that
engagement should happen quick.

481
03:30:49,134 --> 03:30:51,626
Sanjana's friends were telling
me that...

482
03:30:51,636 --> 03:30:55,036
...her brother is a big man
of this city.

483
03:30:55,340 --> 03:30:58,905
And if once...
We're in relation with them.

484
03:30:58,915 --> 03:31:01,670
Then her brother will handle
Majnu and Shetty.

485
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:03,138
Why should we handle them?

486
03:31:03,148 --> 03:31:05,188
Go on son.
Go from there.

487
03:31:06,952 --> 03:31:09,332
God has given me everything.

488
03:31:09,755 --> 03:31:12,220
I have money, fame...
Respect.

489
03:31:12,257 --> 03:31:14,552
I just wanted a decent guy.

490
03:31:14,926 --> 03:31:17,391
Today that search is over
too.

491
03:31:17,729 --> 03:31:19,321
I like you very much.

492
03:31:19,331 --> 03:31:21,541
Your family likes Sanjana.

493
03:31:22,434 --> 03:31:25,494
What could be more happier
than this?

494
03:31:26,471 --> 03:31:30,699
Sanjana's birthday is on 13th.
I was thinking that...

495
03:31:30,709 --> 03:31:33,174
...lf engagement on same day.

496
03:31:33,712 --> 03:31:35,971
How could we prepare so
fast?

497
03:31:35,981 --> 03:31:38,940
What about preparations?
Just need to print 4 cards...

498
03:31:38,950 --> 03:31:43,030
Need to invite 4 people
and two rings. That's it.

499
03:31:44,423 --> 03:31:46,815
I think you're in hurry,
more than me.

500
03:31:46,825 --> 03:31:48,683
If there's a problem...

501
03:31:48,693 --> 03:31:50,693
There's no problem.

502
03:31:53,198 --> 03:31:56,091
Now there can't be a problem
at all.

503
03:31:56,101 --> 03:31:58,560
Today I have brought you
3 good news.

504
03:31:58,570 --> 03:31:59,961
Tell your good new later.

505
03:31:59,971 --> 03:32:04,136
First meet him. He's Sanjana's
going to be Fiancé.

506
03:32:04,409 --> 03:32:06,301
Greetings.
Greetings.

507
03:32:06,311 --> 03:32:08,670
Come see me before you
leave.

508
03:32:08,680 --> 03:32:09,638
Understood?

509
03:32:09,648 --> 03:32:11,648
Understood.

510
03:32:15,954 --> 03:32:17,412
What happened?

511
03:32:17,422 --> 03:32:19,422
It's strange...

512
03:32:19,691 --> 03:32:23,518
In our time family would
do the talking. But...

513
03:32:23,528 --> 03:32:24,419
But it's alright.

514
03:32:24,429 --> 03:32:27,255
Whenever you say I'll bring
my family to meet you.

515
03:32:27,265 --> 03:32:30,666
My new hotel is opening after
two days.

516
03:32:31,069 --> 03:32:32,594
It's a small party.
Bring them.

517
03:32:32,604 --> 03:32:34,604
Sure, I'll bring them.

518
03:32:41,112 --> 03:32:43,112
Because of business.

519
03:32:48,386 --> 03:32:51,079
If something bad comes at you.
Then they'll...

520
03:32:51,089 --> 03:32:53,048
They'll give there life for me.

521
03:32:53,058 --> 03:32:55,058
They'll also take life.

522
03:32:55,193 --> 03:32:56,818
Why are you asking?

523
03:32:56,828 --> 03:32:59,661
Nothing serious.
Actually a man...

524
03:33:00,131 --> 03:33:02,257
Actually he's not one man.
They're two.

525
03:33:02,267 --> 03:33:03,725
They've bothered me so much.

526
03:33:03,735 --> 03:33:05,193
Who are they?

527
03:33:05,203 --> 03:33:07,295
They're from the higher level.

528
03:33:07,305 --> 03:33:09,631
Tell me.
I'll bring them to right level.

529
03:33:09,641 --> 03:33:12,367
Now we're related.
Your problem is my problem.

530
03:33:12,377 --> 03:33:14,803
God willing nobody can
bother us in this city.

531
03:33:14,813 --> 03:33:16,171
Tell me.
Who is it?

532
03:33:16,181 --> 03:33:17,906
It's enough that you
said this much.

533
03:33:17,916 --> 03:33:20,041
I'll talk to them myself.

534
03:33:20,652 --> 03:33:22,210
Okay talk to them.

535
03:33:22,220 --> 03:33:24,312
Or let them talk to me.
I'll handle it on the phone.

536
03:33:24,322 --> 03:33:26,322
Okay.

537
03:33:35,133 --> 03:33:38,533
You're 2 seconds late.
The guy just left.

538
03:33:39,571 --> 03:33:40,595
Which guy?

539
03:33:40,605 --> 03:33:42,163
The one Sanjana loves.

540
03:33:42,173 --> 03:33:44,978
I've fixed the engagement
on 13th.

541
03:33:45,911 --> 03:33:47,636
Then what about my
painter guy?

542
03:33:47,646 --> 03:33:50,539
Take him out of the painting.
Make a building there.

543
03:33:50,549 --> 03:33:52,173
What are you saying
Udhay Bhai?

544
03:33:52,183 --> 03:33:54,242
I worked so hard to get
him inside.

545
03:33:54,252 --> 03:33:55,477
Now you're saying,
Make a building.

546
03:33:55,487 --> 03:33:57,245
You've worked hard that
doesn't mean that...

547
03:33:57,255 --> 03:33:59,281
...I should give my sister's
hand to anyone.

548
03:33:59,291 --> 03:34:00,415
You don't understand
Udhay Bhai.

549
03:34:00,425 --> 03:34:03,184
I couldn't paint his decency
right in hurry.

550
03:34:03,194 --> 03:34:04,986
Look Sanjana loves this guy.

551
03:34:04,996 --> 03:34:08,056
And his family also likes
Sanjana very much.

552
03:34:08,066 --> 03:34:10,066
It's fixed itself.

553
03:34:10,468 --> 03:34:11,960
Let go of your guy.

554
03:34:11,970 --> 03:34:14,775
Sir I can't control my
excitement.

555
03:34:15,574 --> 03:34:18,033
I don't want to ask
but I can't be, without asking.

556
03:34:18,043 --> 03:34:18,867
That's alright too.

557
03:34:18,877 --> 03:34:19,901
I don't understand that...

558
03:34:19,911 --> 03:34:21,970
...who are you selecting and
who are you rejecting?

559
03:34:21,980 --> 03:34:23,238
Come, I'll tell you.

560
03:34:23,248 --> 03:34:25,840
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?

561
03:34:25,850 --> 03:34:27,850
Doctor GHUNGROO.

562
03:34:28,053 --> 03:34:29,578
Relationship cancel.

563
03:34:29,588 --> 03:34:31,446
What are you saying!?

564
03:34:31,456 --> 03:34:34,616
What are you saying?
Relationship cancel.

565
03:34:34,626 --> 03:34:37,452
You disappeared after meeting,
hugging and fixing relationship...

566
03:34:37,462 --> 03:34:39,587
...with my Udhay brother.

567
03:34:39,965 --> 03:34:42,958
No, I went to prepare for
engagement and wedding so...

568
03:34:42,968 --> 03:34:44,192
...I got a little late.

569
03:34:44,202 --> 03:34:45,760
Too late.

570
03:34:45,770 --> 03:34:48,263
Now our sister is in love
with someone else.

571
03:34:48,273 --> 03:34:49,898
Sorry from Udhay brother.

572
03:34:49,908 --> 03:34:52,604
What sorry!?

573
03:34:53,178 --> 03:34:55,178
My nephew will die.

574
03:35:01,252 --> 03:35:04,579
Can I ask, Why did you
bring my uncle here like this?

575
03:35:04,589 --> 03:35:07,649
People who don't pickup our
calls, we pick them up like this.

576
03:35:07,659 --> 03:35:09,659
What do you think?

577
03:35:10,161 --> 03:35:13,051
They've canceled the relationship.

578
03:35:13,064 --> 03:35:15,457
They brought me here to
tell me that.

579
03:35:15,467 --> 03:35:17,025
Cancel?

580
03:35:17,035 --> 03:35:18,159
Try to understand.

581
03:35:18,169 --> 03:35:22,249
But still uncle they could've
done this politely.

582
03:35:23,408 --> 03:35:25,408
Hey let him speak.

583
03:35:25,543 --> 03:35:27,168
He was bothered.

584
03:35:27,178 --> 03:35:28,603
Speak.

585
03:35:28,613 --> 03:35:30,805
It's good that you've canceled
the relationship otherwise...

586
03:35:30,815 --> 03:35:33,365
...we were going to cancel it.

587
03:35:33,685 --> 03:35:35,844
Because I love someone else.

588
03:35:35,854 --> 03:35:37,979
And soon I'll be engaged.

589
03:35:38,690 --> 03:35:40,148
One minute uncle.

590
03:35:40,158 --> 03:35:41,483
Do you know who
are those people?

591
03:35:41,493 --> 03:35:43,051
Who are they?

592
03:35:43,061 --> 03:35:44,886
They're very big people.

593
03:35:44,896 --> 03:35:47,756
They can buy you and your...
What's his name?

594
03:35:47,766 --> 03:35:49,766
Shetty?
Yes Mr. Shetty.

595
03:35:50,101 --> 03:35:52,481
...10 people just like that.

596
03:35:57,876 --> 03:36:00,602
Do you understand?
Mr. Majnu Bhai.

597
03:36:00,612 --> 03:36:02,822
That's why we disappeared.

598
03:36:03,081 --> 03:36:07,076
To think about how to get
rid of thugs like you?

599
03:36:08,153 --> 03:36:12,414
If the brother is like that.
What would his sister be?

600
03:36:12,424 --> 03:36:15,229
And their parents...
I don't know.

601
03:36:15,293 --> 03:36:19,458
I never would've made this
relation even if I die.

602
03:36:20,131 --> 03:36:23,124
Majnu Bhai! You pick up whoever
you like...

603
03:36:23,134 --> 03:36:26,027
...remember that someone can
pick you up too.

604
03:36:26,037 --> 03:36:30,032
Hey enough of you.
Nobody can touch our brother.

605
03:36:30,275 --> 03:36:32,275
Not even touch him!?

606
03:36:33,278 --> 03:36:35,278
Here I touched him.

607
03:36:35,814 --> 03:36:38,773
If someone tries to even touch
me, you can't even imagine...

608
03:36:38,783 --> 03:36:41,163
...what could happen to you?

609
03:36:41,619 --> 03:36:44,646
Here, I touched him again.
What are you going to do?

610
03:36:44,656 --> 03:36:46,656
Hey who's behind you?

611
03:36:47,258 --> 03:36:49,918
You want to know.
Do you want to talk to him?

612
03:36:49,928 --> 03:36:53,328
Take this phone.
Shall I dial it for you?

613
03:36:53,565 --> 03:36:55,056
Would you like to talk?

614
03:36:55,066 --> 03:36:56,324
Can you handle it?

615
03:36:56,334 --> 03:36:58,226
What happened?
You're quiet suddenly.

616
03:36:58,236 --> 03:37:00,829
Hey look here.
I touched him third time.

617
03:37:00,839 --> 03:37:04,834
Rajiv, Don't touch him.
You'll create a problem.

618
03:37:17,055 --> 03:37:19,095
Here I'm touching again.

619
03:37:20,258 --> 03:37:23,785
Seems like he's got a
very big hand behind him.

620
03:37:23,795 --> 03:37:26,321
But who could be bigger than
Majnu Bhai and Udhay Bhai?

621
03:37:26,331 --> 03:37:28,189
Only one man.

622
03:37:28,199 --> 03:37:29,124
George Bush.

623
03:37:29,134 --> 03:37:30,125
Right.

624
03:37:30,135 --> 03:37:32,135
How are you Mr. Mayor?

625
03:37:34,739 --> 03:37:35,930
Mr. Shetty you've build a very
nice hotel.

626
03:37:35,940 --> 03:37:38,233
Just because of your prayers.

627
03:37:38,243 --> 03:37:40,769
Brother I see all decent
people in the party.

628
03:37:40,779 --> 03:37:42,837
Only White Collar people
are invited.

629
03:37:42,847 --> 03:37:46,674
So Me and Udhay Bhai could
also look decent among them.

630
03:37:46,684 --> 03:37:50,934
You think you look decent
after shaving your beard!

631
03:37:53,992 --> 03:37:56,384
I received the invitation but
where's Rajiv and his family?

632
03:37:56,394 --> 03:37:58,604
They must be on their way.

633
03:38:01,432 --> 03:38:04,237
See uncle...
Do you see the crowd?

634
03:38:05,436 --> 03:38:09,297
I'm laughing on the guy who
is in love with Shetty's sister.

635
03:38:09,307 --> 03:38:10,865
Uncle it's not nice.

636
03:38:10,875 --> 03:38:13,601
You shouldn't laugh like
this on someone's ruins.

637
03:38:13,611 --> 03:38:17,069
But I feel sorry for his family.

638
03:38:18,416 --> 03:38:19,841
They'll have to cry all
their life.

639
03:38:19,851 --> 03:38:21,576
You're right.

640
03:38:21,586 --> 03:38:25,156
They're the ones whom
proposal we rejected.

641
03:38:31,896 --> 03:38:34,088
What are you doing
in this party?

642
03:38:34,098 --> 03:38:37,826
The person who owns this
hotel and threw this party...

643
03:38:37,836 --> 03:38:42,086
...my nephew's engagement
is fixed with his sister.

644
03:38:42,740 --> 03:38:44,950
Mr. Ghungroo.
It's amazing.

645
03:38:45,543 --> 03:38:47,068
You've found a very decent
family.

646
03:38:47,078 --> 03:38:47,969
Absolutely.

647
03:38:47,979 --> 03:38:50,238
By the way if you wanted to
make relation with them.

648
03:38:50,248 --> 03:38:52,173
Then what was wrong with
our family?

649
03:38:52,183 --> 03:38:54,183
Come on.

650
03:38:55,253 --> 03:38:57,253
What did he say?
What?

651
03:39:07,866 --> 03:39:10,841
Brother, Rajiv's family has
arrived.

652
03:39:17,041 --> 03:39:18,800
Bhai Saheb, This is my
Uncle and...

653
03:39:18,810 --> 03:39:21,275
And Uncle this is my brother.

654
03:39:40,899 --> 03:39:42,056
Aunty, Why isn't he getting
conscious?

655
03:39:42,066 --> 03:39:44,066
I don't know son.

656
03:39:44,769 --> 03:39:46,769
What shall I do?

657
03:39:46,938 --> 03:39:50,253
What shall I do after
getting conscious?

658
03:39:50,742 --> 03:39:53,717
The proposal we were running
from...

659
03:39:54,012 --> 03:39:59,027
How could I knew that the same
proposal is running after us.

660
03:39:59,984 --> 03:40:04,318
Sanjana is the sister of
Don Udhay Shetty.

661
03:40:07,759 --> 03:40:09,759
Again?

662
03:40:14,832 --> 03:40:16,832
Doctor, please check.

663
03:40:19,570 --> 03:40:24,330
100 Udhay and Majnu will die
and 1 Ghungroo will be born.

664
03:40:27,378 --> 03:40:29,037
He had to get unconscious.

665
03:40:29,047 --> 03:40:32,740
Do you know what he said
when I called him to cancel.

666
03:40:32,750 --> 03:40:36,915
I never would've made this
relation even if I die.

667
03:40:38,222 --> 03:40:42,050
If the brother is like that.
What would his sister be?

668
03:40:42,060 --> 03:40:44,285
And their parents...
What would they be?

669
03:40:44,295 --> 03:40:46,505
That's why we disappeared.

670
03:40:46,898 --> 03:40:50,893
To think about how to get
rid of thugs like you?

671
03:40:51,169 --> 03:40:54,762
He ran off to get rid of
the criminal family.

672
03:40:54,772 --> 03:40:56,772
I'll grant his wish.

673
03:40:56,908 --> 03:40:58,908
Bring the car.
Come on.

674
03:41:03,214 --> 03:41:06,107
Don't forget that it's about
our sister's life.

675
03:41:06,117 --> 03:41:08,117
She loves that guy.

676
03:41:08,453 --> 03:41:11,045
If you kill his uncle,
so there will be no wedding.

677
03:41:11,055 --> 03:41:12,613
She's not marrying the Uncle.

678
03:41:12,623 --> 03:41:15,383
You don't understand what
you're saying in anger.

679
03:41:15,393 --> 03:41:18,419
It'll be a family relation.
You're going to be In-Laws.

680
03:41:18,429 --> 03:41:20,188
Who am I?
No one.

681
03:41:20,198 --> 03:41:22,493
I can do anything.
Anything.

682
03:41:22,834 --> 03:41:24,874
Yes you can do anything.

683
03:41:24,936 --> 03:41:26,194
Go, do anything.

684
03:41:26,204 --> 03:41:28,796
But make him understand
that who's Udhay Shetty.

685
03:41:28,806 --> 03:41:30,064
And what's his reality.

686
03:41:30,074 --> 03:41:32,967
And what will he do
if he's out of his mind.

687
03:41:32,977 --> 03:41:36,838
Here take this. Shoot right
near his ear like this.

688
03:41:36,848 --> 03:41:38,873
I have the weapon.
I'll shoot so right that...

689
03:41:38,883 --> 03:41:43,845
...He'll himself will bring his
nephew to us for the wedding.

690
03:41:43,855 --> 03:41:47,170
You don't worry.
I'm going to handle it.

691
03:41:50,328 --> 03:41:55,428
Majnu's not a less of a swine.
He'll make everything alright.

692
03:42:09,347 --> 03:42:11,747
Hey genius.
Come on get up.

693
03:42:14,552 --> 03:42:17,272
Give me the piece.
Hold the coat.

694
03:42:17,822 --> 03:42:19,847
Look I'm telling you for the
last time.

695
03:42:19,857 --> 03:42:21,616
Get up or you'll be sent up
forever.

696
03:42:21,626 --> 03:42:23,051
I didn't get unconscious
to get conscious.

697
03:42:23,061 --> 03:42:25,061
You won't get up!?

698
03:42:28,866 --> 03:42:31,416
Where's the ammo?
Other pocket.

699
03:42:31,636 --> 03:42:32,894
And the piece in the other
pocket!

700
03:42:32,904 --> 03:42:35,329
Have you taken my bounty
or what?

701
03:42:35,339 --> 03:42:38,533
If something happens someday
then you'll be filling the gun...

702
03:42:38,543 --> 03:42:40,301
...and someone will shoot me
down. Understood?

703
03:42:40,311 --> 03:42:42,503
Bhai, Who could shoot you
down?

704
03:42:42,513 --> 03:42:44,639
But if I put the gun and ammo
in the same pocket...

705
03:42:44,649 --> 03:42:46,741
...I don't how many people
you'll shoot then.

706
03:42:46,751 --> 03:42:48,751
Here's the ammo.

707
03:42:49,387 --> 03:42:51,179
Bhai has filled the gun.

708
03:42:51,189 --> 03:42:54,589
There's still time.
Get up Ghungroo or...

709
03:43:07,171 --> 03:43:09,197
Bhai, He's not responding at all.

710
03:43:09,207 --> 03:43:12,467
But we have the responsibility
to get him up.

711
03:43:12,477 --> 03:43:14,477
Take his pants off.

712
03:43:14,712 --> 03:43:16,304
Naked.

713
03:43:16,314 --> 03:43:18,306
Everybody gets naked in front
of the doctor.

714
03:43:18,316 --> 03:43:20,696
So the doctor himself today.

715
03:43:23,554 --> 03:43:26,274
Bhai, He's already very nude
man.

716
03:43:28,826 --> 03:43:34,011
Bhai, Let go of the middle one.
Let's speak to the main party.

717
03:44:04,028 --> 03:44:06,258
We're thugs, don...

718
03:44:06,731 --> 03:44:10,625
So what? Our sisters
and daughter can't get married.

719
03:44:10,635 --> 03:44:13,015
You love our Sanjana. Right?

720
03:44:13,838 --> 03:44:16,728
Are you going to leave
her hanging?

721
03:44:18,042 --> 03:44:20,762
Look genius.
Invitations are out.

722
03:44:21,779 --> 03:44:23,779
Whole city knows.

723
03:44:24,048 --> 03:44:25,806
If this engagement doesn't go
as planed.

724
03:44:25,816 --> 03:44:28,876
What'll happen to Udhay Bhai's
image?

725
03:44:41,966 --> 03:44:43,966
Tell me.

726
03:44:44,001 --> 03:44:48,301
Now are you going to wake up
your uncle or shall I?

727
03:44:51,075 --> 03:44:55,236
Look you make him sniff
cocaine, heroine whatever...

728
03:44:55,246 --> 03:44:57,966
Just bring him to the
engagement.

729
03:44:58,216 --> 03:45:00,912
Or I'll kill your whole family.

730
03:45:03,087 --> 03:45:07,387
You'll kill us!
How can you?

731
03:45:14,632 --> 03:45:16,632
Look up.

732
03:45:16,968 --> 03:45:19,603
You, your uncle and your aunty.

733
03:45:19,770 --> 03:45:22,915
All of you will be like
those pigeons.

734
03:45:41,826 --> 03:45:44,291
What am I hearing?
Hey Hungry.

735
03:45:45,029 --> 03:45:47,029
You shot at his uncle!

736
03:45:47,732 --> 03:45:49,490
What was I suppose to
do?

737
03:45:49,500 --> 03:45:52,260
He was acting unconscious.
Old man.

738
03:45:52,270 --> 03:45:55,329
Calling him old man.
He don't have manners.

739
03:45:55,339 --> 03:45:57,889
You'll call his uncle old man!

740
03:45:59,010 --> 03:46:01,702
Don't forget that the old man
is my going to be relative.

741
03:46:01,712 --> 03:46:03,604
I'm asking.
Why did you have to shoot?

742
03:46:03,614 --> 03:46:06,407
I thought it'll bring his
conscious back.

743
03:46:06,417 --> 03:46:10,111
Ask him. What if a bullet would
have gone through him?

744
03:46:10,121 --> 03:46:12,121
I made a mistake.
Sorry.

745
03:46:13,090 --> 03:46:16,150
How long will I bare your
mistakes?

746
03:46:17,094 --> 03:46:20,054
Did I tell you to go shoot?
Did I? No. Right?

747
03:46:20,064 --> 03:46:22,064
Why did you shoot?

748
03:46:22,233 --> 03:46:25,226
And Bhai Saheb that thing
I told about waking uncle up.

749
03:46:25,236 --> 03:46:27,446
And those ugly hand signs.

750
03:46:28,039 --> 03:46:31,799
What does he mean?
How were you waking him up?

751
03:46:31,809 --> 03:46:33,567
Swine, How hard was it
to make this relation?

752
03:46:33,577 --> 03:46:35,670
We have found such a decent
and intelligent guy.

753
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:37,838
You're trying to mess up the
relationship. Swine, I'll kill you.

754
03:46:37,848 --> 03:46:39,573
Kill me.

755
03:46:39,583 --> 03:46:44,173
But whoever gives you tension
I wont spear that person.

756
03:46:44,755 --> 03:46:47,280
What shall I do of him?

757
03:46:49,193 --> 03:46:52,119
I can't even kill him.
Because he loves me.

758
03:46:52,129 --> 03:46:54,849
Ballu tell him...
What did he do?

759
03:47:06,677 --> 03:47:08,469
Did you hear that?

760
03:47:08,479 --> 03:47:10,371
He's not bad at heart.

761
03:47:10,381 --> 03:47:11,939
He can't see me in tension.

762
03:47:11,949 --> 03:47:13,674
Why do you worry so much?

763
03:47:13,684 --> 03:47:16,610
Sanjana's engagement will be
on 13th.

764
03:47:16,620 --> 03:47:18,846
Rajiv's very understanding.

765
03:47:18,856 --> 03:47:21,449
He'll bring his uncle to his mind.

766
03:47:21,459 --> 03:47:23,317
Don't you worry?

767
03:47:23,327 --> 03:47:24,785
Then ask him yourself.

768
03:47:24,795 --> 03:47:28,055
Will he bring his uncle to
engagement or Shall I?

769
03:47:28,065 --> 03:47:30,445
Now you bring him.
Mr. Majnu.

770
03:47:32,103 --> 03:47:34,028
My uncle is like my parents.

771
03:47:34,038 --> 03:47:37,863
I can't bare If someone
disrespects my parent.

772
03:47:38,342 --> 03:47:40,833
I love your sister very much.

773
03:47:41,545 --> 03:47:43,545
And I will always.

774
03:47:43,748 --> 03:47:46,553
But I won't get married over
guns.

775
03:47:50,254 --> 03:47:51,812
I'm leaving.

776
03:47:51,822 --> 03:47:55,562
If you want to stop me.
Shoot me in the back.

777
03:48:10,007 --> 03:48:12,472
I'll apologize on his behalf.

778
03:48:13,677 --> 03:48:15,677
What are you doing?

779
03:48:16,781 --> 03:48:20,307
Today a brother is begging
for his sister's happiness.

780
03:48:20,317 --> 03:48:24,447
I apologize for what
I've done.

781
03:48:25,790 --> 03:48:30,380
Being in the bad business
I forgot the value of people.

782
03:49:44,201 --> 03:49:47,176
Now only you can stop
what's coming.

783
03:49:51,275 --> 03:49:55,950
Our brother has flew from Italy
to be in the engagement.

784
03:49:57,381 --> 03:49:59,381
Who's that new brother?

785
03:49:59,483 --> 03:50:01,483
Our elder brother.

786
03:51:19,797 --> 03:51:23,452
I've brought this gift for
both of my lions.

787
03:51:41,585 --> 03:51:43,710
Not half.
He's full crack.

788
03:51:47,391 --> 03:51:49,391
Hey go with Lucky.

789
03:51:51,161 --> 03:51:54,221
After all your sister's marriage
is fixed.

790
03:51:54,231 --> 03:51:56,227
Your tension is over.

791
03:51:56,237 --> 03:51:58,358
Means my tension is over.

792
03:51:59,069 --> 03:52:01,959
There will be dance in
party today.

793
03:52:02,906 --> 03:52:06,051
But there's arrangement for
that, Sir.

794
03:52:07,244 --> 03:52:09,244
I'm still alive.

795
03:56:19,062 --> 03:56:21,062
Stop

796
03:56:27,671 --> 03:56:30,606
I'm ruined.
I'm destroyed.

797
03:56:41,652 --> 03:56:43,977
I'm asking.
What did I do to you?

798
03:56:43,987 --> 03:56:46,615
That you did this to me.

799
03:56:47,257 --> 03:56:49,257
Such a big scandal.

800
03:56:50,160 --> 03:56:52,160
Hey sister.
Please don't

801
03:56:54,131 --> 03:56:57,616
Swine, I'm not your sister.
I'm your wife.

802
03:57:01,605 --> 03:57:04,765
I don't even know you.
When did we get married?

803
03:57:04,775 --> 03:57:09,110
And by the way we got
married while Uncle is around.

804
03:57:09,313 --> 03:57:14,107
So uncle. What did you promise
in front of the whole village?

805
03:57:14,117 --> 03:57:18,011
That, Girl once you grow up.
We'll come to get you.

806
03:57:18,021 --> 03:57:21,166
I grew that old while waiting
for you.

807
03:57:22,893 --> 03:57:25,103
How more old should I get?

808
03:57:25,228 --> 03:57:27,228
Ishika!

809
03:57:28,598 --> 03:57:30,057
Is she telling the truth?

810
03:57:30,067 --> 03:57:32,359
What will this lair tell you?

811
03:57:32,369 --> 03:57:36,619
I have brought the truth and
evidence both with me.

812
03:57:37,307 --> 03:57:40,877
Me, That's my husband
and that's the uncle.

813
03:57:45,749 --> 03:57:49,042
Bhai It's no mistake of mine.
My sister got them married.

814
03:57:49,052 --> 03:57:52,612
I didn't know that she would
come here after all these years.

815
03:57:52,622 --> 03:57:55,482
I think that God also wants
this be.

816
03:57:55,492 --> 03:57:59,653
Did God came down to say that?
Or did God called you up there?

817
03:57:59,663 --> 03:58:04,678
Down here it's our territory
And we make the decisions here.

818
03:58:05,635 --> 03:58:08,695
Is there someone to bring
me justice?

819
03:58:09,339 --> 03:58:14,184
Only they can bring you justice.
They're the biggest here.

820
03:58:45,776 --> 03:58:48,336
I don't have a choice.

821
03:58:49,079 --> 03:58:51,079
Stop.

822
03:58:51,515 --> 03:58:53,515
There will be justice.

823
03:58:54,785 --> 03:58:56,410
I'll do the justice.

824
03:58:56,420 --> 03:58:57,677
Bhai justice has already been
decided.

825
03:58:57,687 --> 03:58:59,982
We have to through her out.

826
03:59:00,223 --> 03:59:03,028
Don't forget that I'm still
alive.

827
03:59:06,396 --> 03:59:10,136
On one side is your sister
and her happiness.

828
03:59:10,834 --> 03:59:14,319
And on the other side
is this girls tears.

829
04:00:24,774 --> 04:00:28,802
Majnu, My father used to take
me temple in my childhood.

830
04:00:28,812 --> 04:00:32,005
There was something written
on temple wall.

831
04:00:32,015 --> 04:00:37,285
A person has to bare what he's
done wrong in the same lifetime.

832
04:00:38,622 --> 04:00:44,487
Everything is blurred from my childhood
accept that thing on the wall.

833
04:00:45,695 --> 04:00:50,200
I think what I did wrong
is coming in my sister's way.

834
04:00:59,509 --> 04:01:03,537
You're not just his sister in law.
You're also a good friend of Rajiv.

835
04:01:03,547 --> 04:01:05,547
What did you do?

836
04:01:06,116 --> 04:01:10,177
Sister, I was told that this
relationship was building by force.

837
04:01:10,187 --> 04:01:12,397
Brother in law lied to me.

838
04:01:25,268 --> 04:01:28,760
I'm compelled.
It's not a drama.

839
04:01:29,706 --> 04:01:31,706
I promised you mother.

840
04:01:34,444 --> 04:01:36,739
My sister made one mistake.

841
04:01:37,414 --> 04:01:40,219
She married in a criminal family.

842
04:01:43,753 --> 04:01:46,473
And she bared that all her life.

843
04:01:54,531 --> 04:01:57,676
She told me when she handed
you to me.

844
04:01:57,934 --> 04:02:02,997
That brother, don't even let the
shadow of crime on my son.

845
04:02:04,374 --> 04:02:08,539
I don't have any objection
with this relationship.

846
04:02:08,745 --> 04:02:11,465
I have objection with relatives.

847
04:02:24,928 --> 04:02:30,453
What if Sanjana's brother leave
the criminal life and become wise.

848
04:02:38,074 --> 04:02:43,429
If that happens. Then I'll happily
accept Sanjana as your bride.

849
04:02:44,014 --> 04:02:46,649
And I'll dance in your wedding.

850
04:02:47,884 --> 04:02:51,149
But if you couldn't change him.

851
04:02:53,189 --> 04:02:56,316
Then the girl you choose
for Rajiv, I'll give Rajiv's hand...

852
04:02:56,326 --> 04:02:59,261
...in her hand with my
own hand.

853
04:03:00,897 --> 04:03:04,389
I'll dance in his wedding.

854
04:03:08,371 --> 04:03:11,097
Are you mad?
I won't be the film director.

855
04:03:11,107 --> 04:03:12,399
I have small kids.

856
04:03:12,409 --> 04:03:14,734
You want my wife to
be an orphan.

857
04:03:14,744 --> 04:03:16,869
Sir please say something.

858
04:03:17,514 --> 04:03:19,639
I won't become the producer
either.

859
04:03:19,649 --> 04:03:21,908
Underworld Don Udhay Shetty.

860
04:03:21,918 --> 04:03:23,958
Hero!
Fake film shooting.

861
04:03:23,987 --> 04:03:26,877
If he finds out bullets will real.

862
04:03:27,357 --> 04:03:29,783
Uncle I'll try my best not
let it come to this.

863
04:03:29,793 --> 04:03:31,793
Try!

864
04:03:34,331 --> 04:03:36,331
Try mean guarantee.

865
04:03:36,766 --> 04:03:38,725
And sir all preparations have
been made.

866
04:03:38,735 --> 04:03:40,026
Sunil Shetty has also agreed.

867
04:03:40,036 --> 04:03:40,794
Sunil Shetty!

868
04:03:40,804 --> 04:03:44,884
Yes. Mr. Sunil Shetty.
Staying in the same hotel.

869
04:03:53,616 --> 04:03:55,375
But you're married in Udhay's
knowledge.

870
04:03:55,385 --> 04:03:56,042
What will you do about
that?

871
04:03:56,052 --> 04:04:00,642
I'll explain it to him that
it was Rajiv's uncles game.

872
04:04:09,432 --> 04:04:11,624
Sunil Shetty?
Yes, He's the lead.

873
04:04:11,634 --> 04:04:16,819
Rajiv, tell your director friend
to ask Sunil Shetty to Udhay.

874
04:04:37,560 --> 04:04:41,045
No Sir,
You're a genius, a great director.

875
04:04:42,599 --> 04:04:47,761
From tomorrow you're shooting
with me or else your out of the film.

876
04:04:47,771 --> 04:04:49,771
Okay Sir.
As you wish.

877
04:04:53,009 --> 04:04:56,636
You think if you won't work with
me, I'll come to streets.

878
04:04:56,646 --> 04:04:59,372
Now film we'll be shot
without you.

879
04:04:59,382 --> 04:05:03,632
What have you done?
What's a film without the star.

880
04:05:04,087 --> 04:05:08,677
I'll bring someone from the
street and make him a star.

881
04:05:27,043 --> 04:05:29,043
I found him sir.

882
04:05:29,279 --> 04:05:31,671
What are you doing?
He can't work.

883
04:05:31,681 --> 04:05:32,605
Why?

884
04:05:32,615 --> 04:05:33,973
He doesn't know acting.

885
04:05:33,983 --> 04:05:36,376
He just runs his bussiness...

886
04:05:36,386 --> 04:05:42,506
These aren't eyes, it's a camera and
it has recognized the talent in you.

887
04:05:45,061 --> 04:05:48,546
Udhay always wanted to work
in the movies.

888
04:05:50,834 --> 04:05:52,692
You can't bare this person.

889
04:05:52,702 --> 04:05:53,359
Why?

890
04:05:53,369 --> 04:05:56,629
He's mad. They way he was
talking to Mr. Sunil Shetty.

891
04:05:56,639 --> 04:05:59,529
But not with me...
I'll bare a bit.

892
04:06:01,311 --> 04:06:03,169
Do you have the time
for all this?

893
04:06:03,179 --> 04:06:05,644
There's always time for this.

894
04:06:30,273 --> 04:06:32,273
Who's Udday among you?

895
04:06:36,045 --> 04:06:38,045
Hello Mr. Udday!
Pappu!

896
04:06:40,149 --> 04:06:42,308

897
04:06:42,318 --> 04:06:44,318
New one!

898
04:06:44,621 --> 04:06:48,446
Don't you guys know that this
house is illegal

899
04:06:48,791 --> 04:06:50,783
But don't you know
whose this house is?

04:06:50,793 --> 04:06:52,452

04:06:52,462 --> 04:06:54,927
and who that is, I also know!

902
04:06:56,966 --> 04:06:59,261
Isn't anything namely, Law?

903
04:07:00,837 --> 04:07:02,128
No don't worry!

904
04:07:02,138 --> 04:07:03,530
I'm just horrible by looks,

905
04:07:03,540 --> 04:07:05,098
instead I'm a good guy!

906
04:07:05,108 --> 04:07:07,108
I just work under Law!

907
04:07:08,611 --> 04:07:11,437
If you guys have any valuable
things put that out!

908
04:07:11,447 --> 04:07:12,772
I'm going to break this house!

909
04:07:12,782 --> 04:07:15,162
Go help him break the house!

910
04:07:16,953 --> 04:07:18,211
Ok brother!

911

Quite good Udday Bhai,

913
04:07:24,561 --> 04:07:27,111
Was it a complex by film star?

914
04:07:28,197 --> 04:07:29,122
Ballu!

915
04:07:29,132 --> 04:07:31,024
Tell him!

916
04:07:31,034 --> 04:07:33,960
I have one fake leg,
and I'm a star of Hockey!!

917
04:07:33,970 --> 04:07:36,195
Not this! Tell him what
happened at Mahurat!

918
04:07:36,205 --> 04:07:37,530
Oho!!

919
04:07:37,540 --> 04:07:39,540
It was fantastic!

920
04:07:40,076 --> 04:07:44,270
They take Bhai as hero,
while take Sunil sheety out of the film!

921
04:07:44,280 --> 04:07:47,425
He said to take anyone from roadside,

922
04:07:47,650 --> 04:07:49,976
no no, he said I'm not taking anyone from
roadside,

923
04:07:49,986 --> 04:07:52,912
while I'm taking a big actor in this film

924
04:07:52,922 --> 04:07:54,747

929
04:08:14,978 --> 04:08:16,302
What's burning!

930
04:08:16,312 --> 04:08:17,804
Is something yours burning?

931
04:08:17,814 --> 04:08:19,272
But I'm smelling!

932
04:08:19,282 --> 04:08:21,908
Hey Majnu, stand up,

is illegal,

935
04:08:37,000 --> 04:08:38,558

936
04:08:38,568 --> 04:08:40,778

Let's get ready for next shot!

945
04:09:18,374 --> 04:09:20,374
That was great,

946
04:09:20,410 --> 04:09:22,410
you are quite talented!

947
04:09:22,478 --> 04:09:24,478
Amazing!

948
04:09:24,781 --> 04:09:26,305
Sanjana, won't you say anything?

949
04:09:26,315 --> 04:09:29,575
I was thinking, It was much difficult,
for you

950
04:09:29,585 --> 04:09:32,475
but you done it well quite easily!

951
04:09:34,323 --> 04:09:38,384
I have written a fantastic dialogue,
Please tell me!

952
04:09:38,394 --> 04:09:41,487
Not a single potatoes sold out
out till this morning!

953
04:09:41,497 --> 04:09:43,497
Nor a half Kandha!

954
04:09:48,638 --> 04:09:50,163
Till morning, not a single potatoes
sold out,

955
04:09:50,173 --> 04:09:52,468
nor sold out a half Kandha!

956
04:09:53,009 --> 04:09:54,133
In which line you are in now?

957
04:09:54,143 --> 04:09:56,143
It's film line!

958
04:10:01,284 --> 04:10:03,749
You are just only for acting!

959
04:10:04,520 --> 04:10:08,260
Till morning, not a single potatoes
sold out,

960
04:10:12,061 --> 04:10:13,786
Madam wants to meet you!

961
04:10:13,796 --> 04:10:14,654
Who Madam?

962
04:10:14,664 --> 04:10:16,664
Actress of this film!

963
04:10:28,745 --> 04:10:30,745
She is Miss Esha!

964
04:10:31,280 --> 04:10:32,238
Mind blowing!

965
04:10:32,248 --> 04:10:34,248
Fantastic!

966
04:10:34,417 --> 04:10:37,243
No one can think, that
this is your first film

967
04:10:37,253 --> 04:10:39,512
and this is first day of your shooting!

968
04:10:39,522 --> 04:10:41,013
I'm glad to meet you Udday!

969
04:10:41,023 --> 04:10:43,023
Same here!

970
04:10:44,627 --> 04:10:46,819
I hope you don't mind me
calling you Udday!

971
04:10:46,829 --> 04:10:48,020
No!
Madam your shot is ready!

972
04:10:48,030 --> 04:10:50,030
She's coming,
wait!

973
04:10:52,034 --> 04:10:54,074
Udday please don't mind,

974
04:10:54,537 --> 04:10:56,229
I was here to sign out this film,

975
04:10:56,239 --> 04:11:00,032
Because as I come to know,
that director has changed the actor,

976
04:11:00,042 --> 04:11:01,968
I wasn't very comfortable

977
04:11:01,978 --> 04:11:03,102
you know!

978
04:11:03,112 --> 04:11:04,937
But when I see your acting,

979
04:11:04,947 --> 04:11:06,305
Oh my God!

980
04:11:06,315 --> 04:11:08,950
The way you said that dialogue!

981
04:11:09,018 --> 04:11:11,611
Take out Potato,
take out Kanda!

982
04:11:11,621 --> 04:11:13,621
You made me your fan

983
04:11:14,123 --> 04:11:17,778
I just tried to act,
keeping actors in mind,

984
04:11:17,927 --> 04:11:19,819
I want your autograph!

985
04:11:19,829 --> 04:11:21,829
Oh yes!

986
04:11:32,542 --> 04:11:33,699
Welcome!

987
04:11:33,709 --> 04:11:37,194
It'll be now much fun
to do work together!

988
04:11:38,447 --> 04:11:40,447
Bye!

989
04:11:44,320 --> 04:11:45,745
Brother!
What?

990
04:11:45,755 --> 04:11:48,414
Seems this actress have
fallen for your love!

991
04:11:48,424 --> 04:11:50,424
Shut up!

992
04:11:57,066 --> 04:12:00,399
I love your daughter very much!

993
04:12:00,837 --> 04:12:04,830
Now nothing can make us separated!

994
04:12:08,611 --> 04:12:10,136
What a look brother!

995
04:12:10,146 --> 04:12:11,404
Looking nice?

996
04:12:11,414 --> 04:12:12,638
Very much!

997
04:12:12,648 --> 04:12:14,674
What are you doing on my shooting?

998
04:12:14,684 --> 04:12:16,684
Brother!
Yes

999
04:12:16,819 --> 04:12:18,978
today meeting is fixed with D'Silva!

1000
04:12:18,988 --> 04:12:20,980
I also called Samuel from Singapore!

1001
04:12:20,990 --> 04:12:22,849
It's quite necessary
for you to come!

1002
04:12:22,859 --> 04:12:25,151
This is the last shot,
just going to Pack up!

1003
04:12:25,161 --> 04:12:29,689
Than we'll go meet them, if agreed
than ok otherwise we'll kill him!

1004
04:12:29,699 --> 04:12:32,458
Looks like we two
can't get married! Rajeev!

1005
04:12:32,468 --> 04:12:37,530
As the Shot here ends,
there Brother's crime scene will start!

1006
04:12:37,540 --> 04:12:42,201
Sanjana once you told me,
your brother is afraid of horses!

1007
04:12:42,211 --> 04:12:44,211
Yes why?

1008
04:12:47,783 --> 04:12:49,993
Why these horses here for?

1009
04:12:50,086 --> 04:12:51,811
Because director
changed the shot!

1010
04:12:51,821 --> 04:12:53,479
First you were coming,
on legs,

1011
04:12:53,489 --> 04:12:55,047
to ask girl's hand from her father,

1012
04:12:55,057 --> 04:12:57,250
but now you'll come
with 25 men on horses!

1013
04:12:57,260 --> 04:12:58,184
On horses!

1014
04:12:58,194 --> 04:12:59,685
How can he ask for her hand,

1015
04:12:59,695 --> 04:13:01,287
he don't know how to ride the horse!

1016
04:13:01,297 --> 04:13:04,757
We can ride our horse, but these
horses are difficult to ride!

1017
04:13:04,767 --> 04:13:05,725
Brother,

1018
04:13:05,735 --> 04:13:08,227
just sit on the horse,
it'll go by itself!

1019
04:13:08,237 --> 04:13:12,665
But first shot was good,
I came walking and ask for hand!

1020
04:13:12,675 --> 04:13:16,769
Brother you know, if I go to make
him understand, he could pack up this movie,

1021
04:13:16,779 --> 04:13:17,937
do you want to close this picture?

1022
04:13:17,947 --> 04:13:19,947
No
than!

1023
04:13:20,082 --> 04:13:23,142
Tell me which horse
you want to ride!

1024
04:13:23,819 --> 04:13:25,859
Give me anyone you like!

1025
04:13:46,375 --> 04:13:48,375
Cut

Aren't you seeing such big man?

1029
04:13:56,686 --> 04:13:59,245
You have to stop the horse here,

1030
04:13:59,255 --> 04:14:00,713
then walk towards him
and ask for hand!

1031
04:14:00,723 --> 04:14:02,081
It's quite simple!

1032
04:14:02,091 --> 04:14:03,516

1035
04:14:05,695 --> 04:14:06,686
You have to pull his belt

1036
04:14:06,696 --> 04:14:08,821
Let's try it one
more time

1037
04:14:11,033 --> 04:14:12,425

1044
04:14:31,587 --> 04:14:33,587
Where are you?

1045
04:14:33,789 --> 04:14:35,789
I'm here!

1046
04:14:35,925 --> 04:14:37,883
What are you doing in the middle?

1047
04:14:37,893 --> 04:14:39,151
The girl's father is here!

1048
04:14:39,161 --> 04:14:41,454
Horse is not doing as I want,

1049
04:14:41,464 --> 04:14:42,655
what can I do?

1050
04:14:42,665 --> 04:14:45,980
So what we should do?
Should we pack up?

1051
04:14:46,369 --> 04:14:48,369
Take away the horses!

1052
04:14:50,840 --> 04:14:53,299
We are coming, I told you,
we are coming in half hour!

1053
04:14:53,309 --> 04:14:55,309
Why are you bothering?

1054
04:14:55,678 --> 04:14:58,637
Now look, how their
meeting will cancel

1055
04:14:58,647 --> 04:15:00,573
Udday Bhai, still stuck
in the shooting!

1056
04:15:00,583 --> 04:15:02,583
Why you let D'Silva go?

1057
04:15:02,852 --> 04:15:05,244
Can't you make him wait
for half hour?

1058
04:15:05,254 --> 04:15:08,229
Who is this Non-sense
shouting here?

1059
04:15:12,128 --> 04:15:13,185
Director Sir,

1060
04:15:13,195 --> 04:15:14,920

Our Shot is stuck,
and they are talking non-sense over phone!

1063
04:15:17,500 --> 04:15:19,795
You please just keep quiet!

1064
04:15:30,413 --> 04:15:32,413
Action!

1065
04:15:33,315 --> 04:15:35,315

1067
04:15:45,995 --> 04:15:47,253

1069
04:15:49,031 --> 04:15:50,056
What are you doing?

1070
04:15:50,066 --> 04:15:53,092
What, I was perfect, walked on my knees,

1071
04:15:53,102 --> 04:15:54,593
this way you are going to ask for her hand!

1072
04:15:54,603 --> 04:15:56,162
By falling here and there,

1073
04:15:56,172 --> 04:15:57,630
will he give you her daughter,
in such way?

1074
04:15:57,640 --> 04:16:00,232
Not on us, but at least have some
mercy on horses!

1075
04:16:00,242 --> 04:16:01,200
Please

1076
04:16:01,210 --> 04:16:03,210
Oh common!

1077
04:16:07,016 --> 04:16:10,161
What actor have I signed for my film!

1078
04:16:10,286 --> 04:16:14,113
Poor horse must be thinking,
which donkey is riding me?

1079
04:16:14,123 --> 04:16:16,123
Non sense Donkey!

1080
04:16:23,466 --> 04:16:24,523
Hey whom you say Donkey!

1081
04:16:24,533 --> 04:16:25,491
You Said Udday a donkey?

1082
04:16:25,501 --> 04:16:28,561
Shut it down this
all shooting drama!

1083
04:16:31,340 --> 04:16:33,466
You are going to make
Udday brother beg?

1084
04:16:33,476 --> 04:16:36,068
People beg in front
of Udday brother!

1085
04:16:36,078 --> 04:16:37,069
What if Udday's horse
go front or left behind,

1086
04:16:37,079 --> 04:16:40,139
can't he come towards Udday brother!

1087
04:16:40,883 --> 04:16:42,675
Where's that oldie?

1088
04:16:42,685 --> 04:16:43,876
Majnu Bhai!

1089
04:16:43,886 --> 04:16:45,886
What are you doing?

1090
04:17:00,269 --> 04:17:01,527
Who has done all this?

1091
04:17:01,537 --> 04:17:03,028
Majnu Bhai did this!

1092
04:17:03,038 --> 04:17:05,370
He beat up director,

1093
04:17:05,741 --> 04:17:07,399
he beat up producer

1094
04:17:07,409 --> 04:17:08,767
he broke someone's nose,

1095
04:17:08,777 --> 04:17:10,777
he broke someone's jaw

1096
04:17:11,313 --> 04:17:13,372
look there, he broke everything!

1097
04:17:13,382 --> 04:17:16,642
He also broke your
dream of being an actor!

1098
04:17:16,652 --> 04:17:19,032
Say something, Director Sir!

1099
04:17:19,822 --> 04:17:21,822

1100
04:17:22,958 --> 04:17:23,816

1102
04:17:25,127 --> 04:17:27,127
Pack up!

1103
04:17:27,363 --> 04:17:29,488
He's jealous of me,
Majnu!

1104
04:17:38,040 --> 04:17:39,698
Nothing matter, how much you wash
charcoal!

1105
04:17:39,708 --> 04:17:41,918
With surf, Nirma, Vim etc,

1106
04:17:42,244 --> 04:17:44,624
it will always remain black!

1107
04:17:45,181 --> 04:17:47,986
Same as these can't never change!

1108
04:17:48,551 --> 04:17:50,551
Sanjana,

1109
04:17:50,686 --> 04:17:53,066
I like these all five girls,

1110
04:17:53,789 --> 04:17:56,509
now whose is capable for Rajeev,

1111
04:17:56,525 --> 04:17:58,905
I leave it on you to decide!

1112
04:18:07,069 --> 04:18:09,619
Once my brother could be good,

1113
04:18:09,638 --> 04:18:11,638
but this Majnu just...

1114
04:18:11,974 --> 04:18:15,289
Sanjana, these guys
are just like crabs!

1115
04:18:15,945 --> 04:18:21,207
If one wants to be good,
the other, let him down by pulling his leg,

1116
04:18:21,217 --> 04:18:23,217
maybe this is our fate!

1117
04:18:24,119 --> 04:18:26,119
No Sanajana!

1118
04:18:26,455 --> 04:18:31,017
Now Majnu Bhai won't decide
for our luck!

1119
04:18:33,362 --> 04:18:37,059
But we'll decide his luck now!

1120
04:18:40,135 --> 04:18:42,430
You name is false Majnu Ji!

1121
04:18:42,938 --> 04:18:48,899
While your name must begin with "S"

1122
04:18:50,946 --> 04:18:53,666
well yes my real name is Saagar!

1123
04:18:54,783 --> 04:18:59,118
Saagar Ji, please bring some
scars on your forehead!

1124
04:19:00,256 --> 04:19:04,251
You have an affair with a girl
when you were 18!

1125
04:19:06,095 --> 04:19:06,919
Don't be shy,

1126
04:19:06,929 --> 04:19:08,520
look up!

1127
04:19:08,530 --> 04:19:10,530
Make it deep!

1128
04:19:14,870 --> 04:19:17,930
That girl name begin with "l"

1129
04:19:19,174 --> 04:19:20,399
you remember?

1130
04:19:20,409 --> 04:19:21,734
Iravati!

1131
04:19:21,744 --> 04:19:23,744
Iravati!

1132
04:19:25,114 --> 04:19:26,305
Sanjana!

1133
04:19:26,315 --> 04:19:28,440
The girl he fall in love with,

1134
04:19:28,450 --> 04:19:30,943
Once her brother broke down
his hands and legs,

1135
04:19:30,953 --> 04:19:32,845
Am I right?

1136
04:19:32,855 --> 04:19:35,581
They just broke my hands,
my Leg broke while falling in the drain!

1137
04:19:35,591 --> 04:19:37,591
That's honesty!

1138
04:19:37,660 --> 04:19:39,818
Because of Iravati, you came into
crime world!

1139
04:19:39,828 --> 04:19:41,787
Yes!

1140
04:19:41,797 --> 04:19:44,690
Because her father, told him to make
fame, money!

1141
04:19:44,700 --> 04:19:47,626
You murdered someone
for sake of money!

1142
04:19:47,636 --> 04:19:49,895
And you are here,
keep running from than!

1143
04:19:49,905 --> 04:19:52,831
But this all are old talkies
Rajeev!

1144
04:19:52,841 --> 04:19:54,533
What will happen afterward?

1145
04:19:54,543 --> 04:19:57,773
That love will came back to your life,

1146
04:19:59,348 --> 04:20:01,473
but what become of children?

1147
04:20:01,483 --> 04:20:03,483
What children?

1148
04:20:03,686 --> 04:20:05,682
She has four kids!

1149
04:20:05,692 --> 04:20:07,613
If she comes in my life!

1150
04:20:07,623 --> 04:20:09,982
What will become of her children?

1151
04:20:09,992 --> 04:20:12,542
Children will remain with her,

1152
04:20:12,795 --> 04:20:15,387
and Iravati is not coming
in your life again,

1153
04:20:15,397 --> 04:20:18,857
A girl like Iravati will
come in your life!

1154
04:20:18,867 --> 04:20:21,417
Whose name will begin with "l"

1155
04:20:22,705 --> 04:20:24,463

1156
04:20:24,473 --> 04:20:27,618
Don't make me scare,

1204
04:22:45,214 --> 04:22:47,840
That great artist is between us right now,

1205
04:22:47,850 --> 04:22:49,850

04:23:09,404 --> 04:23:11,263
No, it's good!

1214
04:23:11,273 --> 04:23:12,431
Why would he mind?

1215
04:23:12,441 --> 04:23:15,000
I have bought many painting of
several big artists,

1217

1219
04:23:20,282 --> 04:23:21,807

Hey do you have pen?

1222
04:23:25,821 --> 04:23:28,541
Sorry I forget it today brother!

1223
04:23:35,531 --> 04:23:39,725
Looking to this painting, I thought this
painting is of some matured artist,

1224
04:23:39,735 --> 04:23:42,115
but you are quite young guy!

1225
04:23:46,341 --> 04:23:48,341

1226
04:23:52,281 --> 04:23:55,001
Seems she fall in love with you!

1227
04:23:57,252 --> 04:24:00,227
This is quite good painting by you!

1228
04:24:00,722 --> 04:24:03,527
Just remaining is to get married!

1229
04:24:09,398 --> 04:24:11,398
Hello!

1230
04:24:12,701 --> 04:24:14,126

1244
04:24:58,780 --> 04:25:00,405
Saagar,

1246
04:25:02,985 --> 04:25:04,743
Tomorrow, is my birthday!

1247
04:25:04,753 --> 04:25:07,112
Why don't we spend evening together,

1248
04:25:07,122 --> 04:25:09,122
just you and me!

1249
04:25:12,594 --> 04:25:14,486
Ishiqa!

1250
04:25:14,496 --> 04:25:16,989
What's happening, you start
dancing from now!

1251
04:25:16,999 --> 04:25:19,191
At least let yourself
in Italy tomorrow!

1252
04:25:19,201 --> 04:25:20,792
Italy?
Yes!

1253
04:25:20,802 --> 04:25:24,117
Udday and your
meeting is fixed with RDX

1254
04:25:24,640 --> 04:25:25,497
what happened?

1255
04:25:25,507 --> 04:25:26,298
Aren't you happy?

1256
04:25:26,308 --> 04:25:28,000
Is there any tension?

1257
04:25:28,010 --> 04:25:29,968
There is a big tension!

1258
04:25:29,978 --> 04:25:32,528
Tomorrow is Ishiqa's birthday!

1259
04:25:32,714 --> 04:25:36,114
We have planned to
spend evening together

1260
04:25:36,551 --> 04:25:40,178
so matter is this much hot, and
I don't even know,

1261
04:25:40,188 --> 04:25:41,713
everything is going on very quietly!

1262
04:25:41,723 --> 04:25:42,981
Very Good!

1263
04:25:42,991 --> 04:25:44,916
Hey Rajeev do me a favor!

1264
04:25:44,926 --> 04:25:48,520
Look to Udday's hand and tell him
that your meeting is cancel,

1265
04:25:48,530 --> 04:25:49,287
no,

1266
04:25:49,297 --> 04:25:50,522
tell him his life is in danger!

1267
04:25:50,532 --> 04:25:52,257
Sagar Ji, please don't mind,

1268
04:25:52,267 --> 04:25:54,732
tell you what, I can not lie!

1269
04:25:54,803 --> 04:25:59,164
By the way, this problem is
created by your own self!

1270
04:25:59,174 --> 04:26:03,235
Shooting was going quite smoothly,
you beat that director for no reason

1271
04:26:03,245 --> 04:26:06,271
If shooting was still going,
Udday Bhai won't ever cancel this shooting!

1272
04:26:06,281 --> 04:26:07,472
Would he ever go to Italy?

1273
04:26:07,482 --> 04:26:09,141
No no way!

1274
04:26:09,151 --> 04:26:12,344
Rajeev Bhai, but that
director is your friend!

1275
04:26:12,354 --> 04:26:13,845
Please begin that shooting again,

1276
04:26:13,855 --> 04:26:15,981
you remember you slapped him,

1277
04:26:15,991 --> 04:26:17,949
besides he's so stubborn,
he won't agree,

1278
04:26:17,959 --> 04:26:20,385
how won't he agree, I'll see him,

1279
04:26:20,395 --> 04:26:21,653
this is the thing I don't like about you,

1280
04:26:21,663 --> 04:26:23,422
why you go over families on such
small talks!

1281
04:26:23,432 --> 04:26:25,157
Why you get ready to fight every time!

1282
04:26:25,167 --> 04:26:27,207
You can say this by love

1283
04:26:27,602 --> 04:26:29,294
Rajeev Bhai, you just don't get mad,

1284
04:26:29,304 --> 04:26:31,229
you want me to make him understand,
very politely!

1285
04:26:31,239 --> 04:26:35,335
Besides, this love is quite lovely thing!

1286
04:30:09,691 --> 04:30:11,691
Sanjana weds Rajeev!

1287
04:30:12,827 --> 04:30:16,855
I can't believe yet, how this impossible
can be possible!

1288
04:30:16,865 --> 04:30:19,257
But I have total faith in you,

1289
04:30:19,267 --> 04:30:23,428
that to get your love, you definitely,
will win this fight!

1290
04:30:23,438 --> 04:30:24,596
Lucky Please!
Get up!

1291
04:30:24,606 --> 04:30:25,530
Lucky!

1292
04:30:25,540 --> 04:30:27,933
What do you think of yourself?

1293
04:30:27,943 --> 04:30:31,853
How dare you to change path
of Majnu and Udday?

1294
04:30:32,180 --> 04:30:34,390
Lucky listen to me!
Please!

1295
04:30:36,818 --> 04:30:38,818
Lucky Sorry Sorry!

1296
04:30:40,789 --> 04:30:42,213
You beat me!

1297
04:30:42,223 --> 04:30:43,949
Son of RDX

1298
04:30:43,959 --> 04:30:45,750
I'm going to kill you!

1299
04:30:45,760 --> 04:30:46,484
Sanjana you get aside!

1300
04:30:46,494 --> 04:30:47,919
I'm going to finish you!

1301
04:30:47,929 --> 04:30:49,888
Sanjana you get aside!

1302
04:30:49,898 --> 04:30:51,890
You'll close down our business!

1303
04:30:51,900 --> 04:30:54,300
No lucky!

1304
04:30:54,869 --> 04:30:57,235
You are rotting our people!

1305
04:30:57,772 --> 04:30:59,431
Lucky leave Rajeev!

1306
04:30:59,441 --> 04:31:01,399
What will you do??

1307
04:31:01,409 --> 04:31:02,367
I'll shoot
you will shoot me!

1308
04:31:02,377 --> 04:31:04,102
You'll shoot me!
Go on shoot me!

1309
04:31:04,112 --> 04:31:06,004
I won't leave him!

1310
04:31:06,014 --> 04:31:08,014
Lucky stop it!

1311
04:31:26,267 --> 04:31:31,102
I was just firing upside!

1312
04:31:38,246 --> 04:31:40,626
This bullet is shot from me,

1313
04:31:41,883 --> 04:31:43,883
I killed Lucky!

1314
04:31:44,452 --> 04:31:46,452
Did you hear me?

1315
04:31:48,623 --> 04:31:50,448
Let's go!

1316
04:31:50,458 --> 04:31:52,458
He's still alive!

1317
04:31:55,497 --> 04:31:57,497
Brother!!

1318
04:32:00,969 --> 04:32:02,969
Hey!!

1319
04:32:03,571 --> 04:32:05,869
Don't worry
I'm here!

1320
04:32:06,174 --> 04:32:07,532
Where's the party?

1321
04:32:07,542 --> 04:32:11,877
Rajeev Bhai, don't worry,
I'll make everything fine!

1322
04:32:12,447 --> 04:32:14,447
Sorry!

1323
04:32:16,918 --> 04:32:18,918
Sorry!!!

1324
04:32:32,434 --> 04:32:33,925
To whom you shot at?

1325
04:32:33,935 --> 04:32:35,393
Bhaiya!

1326
04:32:35,403 --> 04:32:36,461
I'm telling...

1327
04:32:36,471 --> 04:32:38,471
I'm telling...

1328
04:32:38,606 --> 04:32:40,365
you keep quiet!

1329
04:32:40,375 --> 04:32:42,375
It was a mistake by me!

1330
04:32:43,511 --> 04:32:45,203
I made a mistake!

1331
04:32:45,213 --> 04:32:47,213
Control!

1332
04:32:48,116 --> 04:32:49,774
Udday Bhai,

1333
04:32:49,784 --> 04:32:51,109
we all can get killed,

1334
04:32:51,119 --> 04:32:52,944
how can we tell RDX sir,

1335
04:32:52,954 --> 04:32:55,613
Sir you don't worry about RDX sir!

1336
04:32:55,623 --> 04:32:57,148
I have solved that problem!

1337
04:32:57,158 --> 04:32:59,789
I told him that his son is shot

1338
04:32:59,799 --> 04:33:02,004
and he's in hospital here!

1339
04:33:03,565 --> 04:33:06,424
What was the need to tell him that!

1340
04:33:06,434 --> 04:33:07,692
What was the need?

1341
04:33:07,702 --> 04:33:09,494
Why did you tell him?

1342
04:33:09,504 --> 04:33:10,795
I'll kill you bastard!

1343
04:33:10,805 --> 04:33:13,950
He's saying me bastard, and kill you!

1344
04:33:16,177 --> 04:33:17,035
What do you mean?

1345
04:33:17,045 --> 04:33:20,275
Means that he's not
going to last much!

1346
04:33:20,482 --> 04:33:22,482
He can be dead anytime!

1347
04:33:23,318 --> 04:33:27,278
Mean RDX sir couldn't get the chance
to talk to his son,

1348
04:33:27,288 --> 04:33:30,178
and we can tell him
any fake story!

1349
04:33:30,492 --> 04:33:32,450
Whatever you say Udday Bhai,

1350
04:33:32,460 --> 04:33:34,953
but the girl is quite intelligent!

1351
04:33:34,963 --> 04:33:36,963
Thank you!

1352
04:33:37,732 --> 04:33:40,825
But Doctor, are you sure
he'll be dead?

1353
04:33:40,835 --> 04:33:42,660
I can guarantee!

1354
04:33:42,670 --> 04:33:47,600
So should I call to graveyard, and
ask for his reservation?

1355
04:33:49,344 --> 04:33:51,344
Dad!
Let my dad come!

1356
04:34:03,424 --> 04:34:04,949
Udday and Majnu,

1357
04:34:04,959 --> 04:34:06,959
don't ever your eyes

1358
04:34:07,028 --> 04:34:09,028
tell me how is lucky?

1359
04:34:09,797 --> 04:34:11,656
Not is... say was!

1360
04:34:11,666 --> 04:34:13,224
No!

1361
04:34:13,234 --> 04:34:15,230
No!

1362
04:34:15,240 --> 04:34:17,236
This can't be happened!

1363
04:34:23,511 --> 04:34:25,511
Sir!

1364
04:34:27,215 --> 04:34:29,707
Sir, you too left us in this world?

1365
04:34:29,717 --> 04:34:31,717
I'm not going anywhere!

1366
04:34:33,555 --> 04:34:35,555
I'm alive!

1367
04:34:36,157 --> 04:34:38,157
Come, take me to Lucky!

1368
04:34:43,131 --> 04:34:45,423
RDX can come in any minute,
everything is ready?

1369
04:34:45,433 --> 04:34:46,791
Uncle!

1370
04:34:46,801 --> 04:34:48,801
Uncle! Everything Okay?

1371
04:34:49,003 --> 04:34:49,761
Yeah!

1372
04:34:49,771 --> 04:34:50,929
Lucky finished?

1373
04:34:50,939 --> 04:34:52,939
Completely!

1374
04:34:59,781 --> 04:35:00,905
I'm still alive you scoundrels!

1375
04:35:00,915 --> 04:35:02,207
I'm not dead yet!

1376
04:35:02,217 --> 04:35:05,192
I'll kill each and everyone of you!

1377
04:35:09,857 --> 04:35:11,449
I'm a hockey player,
my leg is fake,

1378
04:35:11,459 --> 04:35:12,450
he can run uncle!

1379
04:35:12,460 --> 04:35:14,460
You also run!

1380
04:35:18,099 --> 04:35:19,958
You were one legged!

1381
04:35:19,968 --> 04:35:21,893
How you recover?

1382
04:35:21,903 --> 04:35:25,597
Udday Bhai, made me kind of
Visiting card of whole gang!

1383
04:35:25,607 --> 04:35:27,465
Whomever he want to scare,

1384
04:35:27,475 --> 04:35:28,600
he make me stand and
say speak Ballu!

1385
04:35:28,610 --> 04:35:30,610
Now run Ballu!

1386
04:35:31,446 --> 04:35:32,704
Why are you running taking these woods,

1387
04:35:32,714 --> 04:35:36,624
wherever I find him, I'll burn him
right there!

1388
04:35:44,726 --> 04:35:46,722
Lucky can kill anyone!

1389
04:35:46,732 --> 04:35:48,620
Someone can kill lucky,

1390
04:35:48,630 --> 04:35:50,822
he can never commit suicide!

1391
04:35:50,832 --> 04:35:52,832
Stop lucky!

1392
04:35:53,001 --> 04:35:55,041
Sir, will we lie to you?

1393
04:35:56,104 --> 04:35:58,314
Sir you don't believe us!!

1394
04:36:01,976 --> 04:36:04,356
Why Lucky committed suicide?

1395
04:36:04,879 --> 04:36:09,299
This thing only one person know,
whose Lucky himself!

1396
04:36:18,226 --> 04:36:20,184
Lucky run away from graveyard!

1397
04:36:20,194 --> 04:36:22,020
Run away!!

1398
04:36:22,030 --> 04:36:23,254
Who run away?

1399
04:36:23,264 --> 04:36:27,259
The Pandit run away, as he
come to knew you name

1400
04:36:27,302 --> 04:36:29,463
Get that bastard!

1401

You hearted what's Sir saying...

1402
04:36:32,140 --> 04:36:34,265
Get that bastard... Okay!

1403
04:36:39,347 --> 04:36:40,638
Daddy... Daddy!

1404
04:36:40,648 --> 04:36:41,673
Daddy!

1405
04:36:41,683 --> 04:36:42,940
How come he's your daddy?

1406
04:36:42,950 --> 04:36:44,375
Not mine, he's Lucky's Daddy!

1407
04:36:44,385 --> 04:36:45,643
He's going over there!

1408
04:36:45,653 --> 04:36:47,045
Dad! I'm here!

1409
04:36:47,055 --> 04:36:48,913
Dad, I'm in here dad!

1410
04:36:48,923 --> 04:36:54,703
I told him thousand times, why is he
still bringing RDX to graveyard!

1411
04:36:55,596 --> 04:36:56,354
Rajeev Bhai, now what should we do?

1412
04:36:56,364 --> 04:36:57,822
Come let's go to graveyard!

1413
04:36:57,832 --> 04:36:59,023
Common let's go!

1414
04:36:59,033 --> 04:37:00,625
Who says Lucky is not here!

1415
04:37:00,635 --> 04:37:02,026
Huh!

1416
04:37:02,036 --> 04:37:03,928
But I can't see him!
Where is he?

1417
04:37:03,938 --> 04:37:05,363
He's standing right in front of me!

1418
04:37:05,373 --> 04:37:07,466
No no!

1419
04:37:07,842 --> 04:37:09,033
I don't want to be caught in this!

1420
04:37:09,043 --> 04:37:11,508
I could have lay besides you,

1421
04:37:11,979 --> 04:37:15,039
but RDX's son is dead, not daughter,

1422
04:37:15,950 --> 04:37:19,520
his father will cry and fall on his chest,

1423
04:37:21,222 --> 04:37:23,222
no no!

1424
04:37:24,192 --> 04:37:26,192
Not me!

1425
04:37:33,368 --> 04:37:34,625
This has to happen!

1426
04:37:34,635 --> 04:37:37,270
He was connected to underworld!

1427
04:37:40,842 --> 04:37:43,307
But where is Rajeev and Mami!

1428
04:37:46,881 --> 04:37:48,606
Maybe they didn't even know yet!

1429
04:37:48,616 --> 04:37:51,846
Ghungroo Mama! Is not anymore with us!

1430
04:38:05,900 --> 04:38:07,900
Lucky!

1431
04:38:17,311 --> 04:38:19,311
Lucky!

1432
04:38:19,781 --> 04:38:21,781
Lucky talk to me!

1433
04:38:22,617 --> 04:38:24,617
Lucky! Talk to me!

1434
04:38:25,253 --> 04:38:27,619
Lucky please talk to me!

1435
04:38:28,356 --> 04:38:30,821
What was missing in our love?

1436
04:38:32,560 --> 04:38:34,560
Lucky my son!

1437
04:38:48,342 --> 04:38:49,434
Uncle!

1438
04:38:49,444 --> 04:38:50,668
You can't see him!

1439
04:38:50,678 --> 04:38:52,678
Why can't I see him?

1440
04:38:53,314 --> 04:38:56,909
Because this was Lucky's last wish!

1441
04:38:57,718 --> 04:38:59,718
Last wish!

1442
04:39:00,555 --> 04:39:02,313
But why he said like that?

1443
04:39:02,323 --> 04:39:04,323
Sir I tell you,

1444
04:39:04,358 --> 04:39:08,686
only a person can answer this question,
who was lucky himself!

1445
04:39:08,696 --> 04:39:10,588
Sir can we lie to you?

1446
04:39:10,598 --> 04:39:12,723
Sir don't you believe us?

1447
04:39:27,849 --> 04:39:29,849
He's here!

1448
04:39:41,629 --> 04:39:43,054
You uncle is very great!

1449
04:39:43,064 --> 04:39:46,124
He took all our troubles to himself!

1450
04:39:46,300 --> 04:39:48,300
Look there!

1451
04:39:50,004 --> 04:39:52,004
Uncle!

1452
04:39:53,174 --> 04:39:55,174
Uncle!

1453
04:39:56,310 --> 04:39:58,269
Control!

1454
04:39:58,279 --> 04:40:01,112
Why is he calling my son Uncle?

1455
04:40:01,549 --> 04:40:03,759
No he's calling you Uncle!

1456
04:40:07,455 --> 04:40:08,713
And why is he crying this much?

1457
04:40:08,723 --> 04:40:11,148
Because he became a (Biru)good friend
of Lucky

1458
04:40:11,158 --> 04:40:12,316
Biru?

1459
04:40:12,326 --> 04:40:13,451
You can call it Best friends!

1460
04:40:13,461 --> 04:40:14,252
I just make him understand!

1461
04:40:14,262 --> 04:40:15,920
I just make him understand!

1462
04:40:15,930 --> 04:40:17,088
Rajeev!

1463
04:40:17,098 --> 04:40:19,098
No no!

1464
04:40:19,300 --> 04:40:21,192
He's alive!

1465
04:40:21,202 --> 04:40:22,760
Who's alive?

1466
04:40:22,770 --> 04:40:24,770
Lucky is alive!

1467
04:40:25,907 --> 04:40:28,372
Lucky is alive in our hearts!

1468
04:40:36,350 --> 04:40:38,350
You uncle is alive!

1469
04:40:38,486 --> 04:40:40,486
Lucky!!
Where is he?

1470
04:40:42,056 --> 04:40:44,351
He's hiding somewhere here!

1471
04:40:44,425 --> 04:40:46,425
Who?
Lucky!

1472
04:41:02,710 --> 04:41:04,710
Uddday!!
Yes sir!

1473
04:41:05,746 --> 04:41:07,871
Why is this logs falling?

1474
04:41:09,584 --> 04:41:12,644
Now the wood is
asking for dead body!

1475
04:41:13,821 --> 04:41:14,812
Hey Ram!

1476
04:41:14,822 --> 04:41:16,714
Control!

1477
04:41:16,724 --> 04:41:18,724
Side please!

1478
04:41:20,394 --> 04:41:22,394
Mami please careful!

1479
04:41:37,745 --> 04:41:39,745
Don't you feel ashamed?

1480
04:41:40,247 --> 04:41:45,517
You were going to perform his funeral,
without even telling me!

1481
04:41:49,757 --> 04:41:52,351
At least today let me cry!

1482
04:41:53,361 --> 04:41:56,489
My life got ruined!

1483
04:41:56,797 --> 04:41:59,517
Why is she breaking her bangles?

1484
04:42:00,935 --> 04:42:02,026
Who is she?

1485
04:42:02,036 --> 04:42:04,095
She is the wife of dead body!

1486
04:42:04,105 --> 04:42:05,296
Wife of dead body!

1487
04:42:05,306 --> 04:42:06,831
But when did Lucky got married?

1488
04:42:06,841 --> 04:42:07,965
And why didn't he tell me!

1489
04:42:07,975 --> 04:42:10,468
Maybe this secret also gone
away with Lucky!

1490
04:42:10,478 --> 04:42:13,878
But I think Rajeev must know about this!

1491
04:42:14,248 --> 04:42:15,539
Rajeev now you tell him,

1492
04:42:15,549 --> 04:42:17,549
what should I tell him?

1493
04:42:19,487 --> 04:42:20,678
What should I tell...

1494
04:42:20,688 --> 04:42:22,179
what should I tell...

1495
04:42:22,189 --> 04:42:25,955
that... this girl is from good background!

1496
04:42:28,062 --> 04:42:31,037
And lucky and her both got married,

1497
04:42:31,098 --> 04:42:35,159
and the girl's parent asked for one condition,

1498
04:42:35,736 --> 04:42:39,430
that the boys' father, means you have to leave,
job for the underworld,

1499
04:42:39,440 --> 04:42:43,860
or else they both can't meet after the marriage too,

1500
04:42:44,045 --> 04:42:46,170
what more good I can say?

1501
04:42:46,347 --> 04:42:48,347
Alright that's good!

1502
04:42:49,083 --> 04:42:51,083
Come let's go,

1503
04:42:51,118 --> 04:42:53,313

1504
04:43:03,698 --> 04:43:05,738
Where are you taking me?

1505
04:43:06,834 --> 04:43:08,834

I was the first one came here!

1508
04:43:34,962 --> 04:43:37,597
You were crying, over my chest,

1509
04:43:37,631 --> 04:43:39,631
over your chest!

1510
04:43:40,101 --> 04:43:41,559
No one can remember, in grief,

1511
04:43:41,569 --> 04:43:44,544
that whose crying over whose chest?

1512
04:43:51,078 --> 04:43:53,078
He's alive!

1513
04:43:55,116 --> 04:43:57,116
Look Ishiqa!
He's alive!

1514
04:44:01,756 --> 04:44:03,756
It's called true love!

1515

She gone mad, in Lucky's love!

1516

1517
04:44:13,934 --> 04:44:15,426

Welcome!

1531
04:45:39,186 --> 04:45:41,245
RDX

1532
04:45:42,122 --> 04:45:45,319
Ranveer Dhanraj Xaka!

1533
04:45:46,393 --> 04:45:49,198
Second name for terror and death!

1534
04:45:49,897 --> 04:45:53,128
You tried to burn my son alive!

1535
04:45:53,767 --> 04:45:55,092
Sir we didn't knew, that

1537
04:45:57,204 --> 04:45:59,263

1538
04:46:02,476 --> 04:46:04,368
Sir would we lie to you?

1539
04:46:04,378 --> 04:46:06,758
Sir don't you believe in us?

1540
04:46:14,154 --> 04:46:20,104
Don't you even take out the
words, believe and faith from your mouth...

04:46:20,461 --> 04:46:23,587
this all happened due to me,

04:46:23,597 --> 04:46:25,422
I'm the one to be punished!

1543
04:46:25,432 --> 04:46:26,590
They don't deserve that!

1544
04:46:26,600 --> 04:46:28,810
Punish is already decided,

1545
04:46:29,803 --> 04:46:32,438
you guys played a game with us,

1546
04:46:32,806 --> 04:46:35,766
now we are going to
play game with you,

1547
04:46:35,776 --> 04:46:37,776
Passing the parcel,

1548
04:46:38,212 --> 04:46:41,038
One have to sing a song on
which hands the parcel is

1549
04:46:41,048 --> 04:46:43,974
...being held after music is
off. Isn't it the same game?

1550
04:46:43,984 --> 04:46:46,243
Yes... same... same... same...

1551
04:46:46,253 --> 04:46:49,880
Err! RDX brother me and your
Bhabhi... Oh! Sorry... Sorry...

1552
04:46:49,890 --> 04:46:51,515
- Say Namaste to him.
- Namsete.

1553
04:46:51,525 --> 04:46:53,717
- You are an expert.
- But we aren't.

1554
04:46:53,727 --> 04:46:58,188
- A rule has been changed in it.
- Have to dance along with the song.

1555
04:46:58,198 --> 04:47:01,558
- We know the variation.
- When the music goes off

1556
04:47:01,568 --> 04:47:07,773
Whoever hold this parcel he'll be drop
off in this 1000 miles deep trench.

1557
04:47:33,968 --> 04:47:36,265
Sir, your man sir.

1558
04:47:36,275 --> 04:47:38,270
Your man black panther.

1559
04:47:38,939 --> 04:47:41,574
Who told you to play this game?

1560
04:47:41,775 --> 04:47:43,300
- This monk.
- No... No...

1561
04:47:43,310 --> 04:47:44,168
Shut up.

1562
04:47:44,178 --> 04:47:48,343
- Sorry... Sorry sir.
- Rules are Rules my friend.

1563
04:47:49,149 --> 04:47:51,242
I can't give my words.

1564
04:47:53,187 --> 04:47:56,077
You'll have you give up your life.

1565
04:48:15,409 --> 04:48:18,469
Err! According to your
information nobody had been here.

1566
04:48:18,479 --> 04:48:20,689
But party is on over here.

1567
04:48:23,550 --> 04:48:25,009
Sir now what can we do?

1568
04:48:25,019 --> 04:48:28,379
- We'll do for what we are here?
- But sir there are so many people up there.

1569
04:48:28,389 --> 04:48:31,215
Err! All of them are criminals
and rewards is on everybody.

1570
04:48:31,225 --> 04:48:34,251
Do one thing push this
house in the trench.

1571
04:48:34,261 --> 04:48:37,661
Then we'll see how
much reward we'll win.

1572
04:49:19,406 --> 04:49:21,738
- Sir.
- Lucky.

1573
04:49:22,242 --> 04:49:23,600
Are you crazy?

1574
04:49:23,610 --> 04:49:27,805
He wasn't passing it over to save his
love that's why I snatch it from his hand.

1575
04:49:27,815 --> 04:49:30,808
But you switch off the
music at the same time Dad.

1576
04:49:30,818 --> 04:49:32,818
This isn't not fare.

1577
04:49:32,986 --> 04:49:35,679
Ghungroo-Ji now what
RDX-Saab will do?

1578
04:49:35,689 --> 04:49:38,582
No what else he would do? He
said that rules are rules?

1579
04:49:38,592 --> 04:49:39,283
- Isn't it.
- Yes... Yes... Yes...

1580
04:49:39,293 --> 04:49:44,655
Correct Ghungroo-saith. RDX-Saab is known in all
over the underworld just because of his justice.

1581
04:49:44,665 --> 04:49:45,956
The justice has been done then done.

1582
04:49:45,966 --> 04:49:48,859
Do you know that RDX-Saab never
changed his words till today.

1583
04:49:48,869 --> 04:49:50,127
He wouldn't change even today.

1584
04:49:50,137 --> 04:49:52,463
But consider that changed
because of the child then

1585
04:49:52,473 --> 04:49:54,665
...how much disgrace would be
faced in the underworld?

1586
04:49:54,675 --> 04:49:58,836
Any world brother but all the
life has been passed to earn the name.

1587
04:49:58,846 --> 04:50:01,638
But a instance is
enough to lose the name.

1588
04:50:01,648 --> 04:50:05,008
And the parcel which is in Lucky's
hand, this is the same instance.

1589
04:50:05,018 --> 04:50:07,483
Parcel... Parcel... Parcel...

1590
04:50:09,857 --> 04:50:12,449
Sir if you want to change
your decision then change

1591
04:50:12,459 --> 04:50:16,487
...it, we can understand he's
your son. He's your blood.

1592
04:50:16,497 --> 04:50:18,755
Bhai nobody will tell
anything to anybody.

1593
04:50:18,765 --> 04:50:20,657
Don't tell, means?

1594
04:50:20,667 --> 04:50:22,726
No... No... Nobody tell or
don't tell, such like that

1595
04:50:22,736 --> 04:50:24,828
...cheating is being started
in the game so I'll not play.

1596
04:50:24,838 --> 04:50:27,983
- I'm leaving.
- Justice will be done.

1597
04:50:30,344 --> 04:50:32,344
I'll do the justice.

1598
04:50:33,547 --> 04:50:41,112
I know if I'll forgive the life of my son
then I'll be disgraced very badly in underworld.

1599
04:50:44,324 --> 04:50:50,189
But infamy would then occur, when
a person will live among you people?

1600
04:51:10,984 --> 04:51:13,877
How do you cut it? It's half collapse.

1601
04:51:13,887 --> 04:51:16,513
- It'll collapse.
- If it'll not then?

1602
04:51:16,523 --> 04:51:19,158
- Err! Run.
- Err! Run... Run...

1603
04:51:21,261 --> 04:51:24,359
- Babloo.
- Help.

1604
04:51:24,369 --> 04:51:26,364
Help.

1605
04:51:27,234 --> 04:51:29,234
Help me.

1606
04:51:29,369 --> 04:51:31,369
Help.

1607
04:51:49,056 --> 04:51:50,547
Err! That side.

1608
04:51:50,557 --> 04:51:52,416
Go that side.

1609
04:51:52,426 --> 04:51:54,284
Oh God!

1610
04:51:54,294 --> 04:51:56,419
- Hemeash.
- What is this?

1611
04:52:06,139 --> 04:52:07,097
Leave my hand.

1612
04:52:07,107 --> 04:52:08,732
Leave my hand.

1613
04:52:08,742 --> 04:52:10,742
Leave my hand.

1614
04:52:11,912 --> 04:52:14,802
It's collapsing towards this side.

1615
04:52:19,319 --> 04:52:24,759
Err! Don't run here and there you
people will collapse the house.

1616
04:52:25,525 --> 04:52:28,385
Brother thank you,
take care of your Bhabhi.

1617
04:52:28,395 --> 04:52:30,395
Don't worry.

1618
04:52:34,201 --> 04:52:36,241
Err! Come in the center.

1619
04:52:44,978 --> 04:52:46,978
Being bitten.

1620
04:52:52,586 --> 04:52:54,711
This side... This side...

1621
04:52:57,658 --> 04:52:59,658
Come to my arms.

1622
04:53:00,127 --> 04:53:04,887
- Majnoo take care of your Bhabhi.
- Yes... Yes... Yes...

1623
04:53:07,901 --> 04:53:10,327
Come here, I'll do something.

1624
04:53:10,337 --> 04:53:13,335
I'll hit. I'll hit you.

1625
04:53:13,345 --> 04:53:17,140
- Majnoo.
- I was just breaking the bowl sir.

1626
04:53:17,644 --> 04:53:22,372
- I'll kill you if you touch her.
- Come in to the center.

1627
04:53:22,382 --> 04:53:26,377
All of you come in to
the center. In the center.

1628
04:53:27,554 --> 04:53:29,246
Lucky I'm coming.

1629
04:53:29,256 --> 04:53:32,282
Mamaji don't go back,
come in the center.

1630
04:53:32,292 --> 04:53:33,984
Sanjana that side, go towards that side.

1631
04:53:33,994 --> 04:53:36,374
- I'm unable to move.
- Stop.

1632
04:53:37,531 --> 04:53:39,531
Take care of your head.

1633
04:53:41,401 --> 04:53:44,302
Dad, he rips my head off.

1634
04:53:50,344 --> 04:53:52,874
All stand in the center.

1635
04:53:52,884 --> 04:53:54,919
All stand in the center.

1636
04:54:46,633 --> 04:54:49,098
What are you doing you idiot?

1637
04:54:51,938 --> 04:54:54,331
Are you gonna be mad? Are you mad?

1638
04:54:54,341 --> 04:54:56,341
Oh my God.

1639
04:54:57,277 --> 04:55:00,576
Found it, I found to kill the bees.

1640
04:55:03,383 --> 04:55:05,383
Spray on me too.

1641
04:55:07,454 --> 04:55:09,454
Here, here, here.

1642
04:55:11,425 --> 04:55:15,259
Oh God. I can't see, I'm blind.

1643
04:55:15,495 --> 04:55:17,495
What you spray on me?

1644
04:55:19,933 --> 04:55:21,324
My eyes are burning.

1645
04:55:21,334 --> 04:55:22,325
Wear this.

1646
04:55:22,335 --> 04:55:23,860
Wear this then you will feel good.

1647
04:55:23,870 --> 04:55:27,950
If you cover your eyes
then how you will see him?

1648
04:55:34,247 --> 04:55:35,572
Uday Bro.

1649
04:55:35,582 --> 04:55:39,776
Listen to me, destroy this
RDX or throw it in valley.

1650
04:55:39,786 --> 04:55:42,078
If he gets saved then we will not.

1651
04:55:42,088 --> 04:55:44,088
Who is speaking?

1652
04:55:45,859 --> 04:55:47,484
I'm Bajro Bahi speaking.

1653
04:55:47,494 --> 04:55:48,652
You are lying.

1654
04:55:48,662 --> 04:55:51,212
Sir, your Bajro is here, here.

1655
04:55:54,167 --> 04:55:56,431
What is happening here?

1656
04:55:56,870 --> 04:56:00,135
No one will survive.
We all are ruined

1657
04:56:06,446 --> 04:56:08,472
- Sanjna, let's go, hurry up.
- But Rajiv you.

1658
04:56:08,482 --> 04:56:10,907
You don't worry about me.
Just let's go. Go forward.

1659
04:56:10,917 --> 04:56:12,108
Nephew.

1660
04:56:12,118 --> 04:56:15,645
I'm your blood relative.
When will be my number?

1661
04:56:15,655 --> 04:56:17,113
Sanjna slowly.

1662
04:56:17,123 --> 04:56:19,749
Where are you?
- In matter of Ishika, we all will die.

1663
04:56:19,759 --> 04:56:22,252
If everyone dies, okay with me but...

1664
04:56:22,262 --> 04:56:24,262
Kill everyone.

1665
04:56:24,631 --> 04:56:27,023
Does my number will come?
After falling of the house?

1666
04:56:27,033 --> 04:56:29,033
Get aside.

1667
04:56:33,073 --> 04:56:35,073
Easy.

1668
04:56:44,551 --> 04:56:46,551
Easy.

1669
04:56:58,832 --> 04:57:03,735
Daddy. Daddy save me daddy.

1670
04:57:04,137 --> 04:57:06,137
Somebody save my son.

1671
04:57:09,910 --> 04:57:15,171
- Somebody save my brother please.
- Someone Please save my son.

1672
04:57:15,181 --> 04:57:17,181
Rajiv?

1673
04:57:19,252 --> 04:57:20,810
Rajiv. Stop.

1674
04:57:20,820 --> 04:57:22,820
Rajiv, come back.

1675
04:57:26,793 --> 04:57:28,793
- Rajiv?
- Stop him.

1676
04:57:33,366 --> 04:57:35,091
Rajiv.

1677
04:57:35,101 --> 04:57:36,893
Rajiv, don't do the madness.

1678
04:57:36,903 --> 04:57:42,088
You have everything from God
like, money and fame. Rajiv stop.

1679
04:57:44,010 --> 04:57:45,635
Help me dad.

1680
04:57:45,645 --> 04:57:47,645
Daddy.

1681
04:58:13,239 --> 04:58:18,468
If he will get punish of my sins
then I'll never forgive myself.

1682
04:58:18,478 --> 04:58:19,269
What you mean?

1683
04:58:19,279 --> 04:58:23,113
I shoot the bullet for him.

1684
04:58:24,117 --> 04:58:26,776
But he took this crime on his head.

1685
04:58:26,786 --> 04:58:29,251
So I'll not face any problem.

1686
04:58:39,966 --> 04:58:41,966
Towards the door.

1687
04:59:14,768 --> 04:59:18,135
No, no Sanjna no.

1688
04:59:29,382 --> 04:59:31,382
I want to die.

1689
04:59:31,785 --> 04:59:32,709
Sanjna.

1690
04:59:32,719 --> 04:59:34,678
Rajiv you cheated me.
- Sanjna

1691
04:59:34,688 --> 04:59:36,813
You betrayed me.
- Sanjna.

1692
04:59:36,956 --> 04:59:40,949
I never believe you and
I'll never forgive you.

1693
04:59:50,804 --> 04:59:52,804
What Happen?

1694
04:59:59,212 --> 05:00:01,212
Sanjna, why you hit me?

1695
05:00:11,624 --> 05:00:19,963
Rajiv, Evil is always
small in front of good.

1696
05:00:22,068 --> 05:00:23,993
You win the heart of RDX.

1697
05:00:24,003 --> 05:00:26,003
Ask, what you want?

1698
05:00:26,039 --> 05:00:29,014
You also leave this world of crime.

1699
05:00:29,075 --> 05:00:31,071
Their is nothing in it.

1700
05:00:31,081 --> 05:00:33,077
World need love.

1701
05:00:33,346 --> 05:00:34,571
Not hate.

1702
05:00:34,581 --> 05:00:37,846
Decorate this whole city like bride.

1703
05:00:38,284 --> 05:00:39,976
For what?

1704
05:00:39,986 --> 05:00:46,619
For this that I'll arrange the
marriage of Rajiv and Sanjna.

1705
05:00:49,662 --> 05:00:51,662
Is your leg okay sir?

1706
05:00:53,900 --> 05:00:59,236
- Do the same for us.
- We lost in love.

1707
05:01:00,240 --> 05:01:04,405
That's ok but first
introduce your brides with me.

1708
05:01:07,147 --> 05:01:09,782
What? Buy one and get one free.

1709
05:01:09,916 --> 05:01:11,916
Hey, lover.

1710
05:01:12,552 --> 05:01:14,644
Why you are holding
the hand of your Bhabhi.

1711
05:01:14,654 --> 05:01:19,582
I don't like this kind of jokes Uday
Bahi. Leave the hand of your Bhabhi.

1712
05:01:19,592 --> 05:01:20,683
What? I'm bullshitting.

1713
05:01:20,693 --> 05:01:22,786
- You are holding hand of your Bhabhi.
- She is my Ishika.

1714
05:01:22,796 --> 05:01:23,953
She is my Ishika.

1715
05:01:23,963 --> 05:01:25,288
Hey Ishika, tell him.

1716
05:01:25,298 --> 05:01:26,156
Ishika, tell me?

1717
05:01:26,166 --> 05:01:27,757
- You tell me.
- I'm telling you.

1718
05:01:27,767 --> 05:01:29,659
Rajiv, tell them.

1719
05:01:29,669 --> 05:01:32,061
Actually what ever
happen... wait a minute.

1720
05:01:32,071 --> 05:01:36,735
These both sir...
Sanjan run, Sanjna run from here.

1721
05:01:37,410 --> 05:01:38,601
Why they run away?

1722
05:01:38,611 --> 05:01:40,611
I'll come back.

1723
05:01:41,314 --> 05:01:44,034
Uday Bahi, why they are running?

1724
05:01:53,226 --> 05:01:54,784
Such big game.

1725
05:01:54,794 --> 05:01:56,286
With us.

1726
05:01:56,296 --> 05:01:59,322
I'm now a good person but
I'll not forgive Rajiv.

1727
05:01:59,332 --> 05:02:01,357
If you forgive him then
I'll not forgive you.

1728
05:02:01,367 --> 05:02:07,062
You have everything from God like,
money, respect and fame. Rajiv...
