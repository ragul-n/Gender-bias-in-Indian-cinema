1
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:31,193
Hurry up- Come on, girls-fast!
Becareful-

2
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:37,206
I wonder where Raju guide went?

3
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:43,046
Hello, excuse me-
What is it,madam?

4
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:46,879
Who is Raju guide here?
Raju is sitting and talking right

5
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:48,577
before you-

6
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,781
Very good morning,madam-And now
he is standing-

7
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,917
Everybody is waiting for you at
the station and

8
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:56,892
you are sitting here? Come on,
hurry up!

9
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,232
This is the station area,madam-
It is the train that is standing

10
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,900
behind-

11
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:15,404
Look that's Patal Ganga the tallest
mountain in the area

12
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:32,329
Listen, the bus will stop here
only for ten minutes-

13
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,000
Whoever wants to refresh
themselves, can do so-Don't

14
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:37,262
tell me later that you were not
given time-

15
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,268
I will go fill water and come-

16
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,578
I will never come to
this area again-

17
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,677
Liquor here is so expensive
it makes no sense coming here-

18
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,276
What are you doing?
Where are you sitting?

19
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:51,279
Can't you people see?
If the bottle had broken,

20
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,951
who would pay for it, your father?

21
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:58,015
Suraj, where have you been?
I didn'tsee you since two days

22
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,213
Where were you?

23
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:03,192
Since two days? You are strange!
Why?

24
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,953
You got totally drunk at the bar
yesterday-

25
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,429
I had to carry you home-

26
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,635
It was you who took me home?
Ofcourse-

27
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:11,633
I was wondering why you looked
familiar-

28
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:14,306
You have carried me home several
times before-

29
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:16,475
Don't worry, I am fine now-

30
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,336
You look fine- Have you found a
big client?

31
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:24,313
A group of girls has come from
Mumbai- I have got the contract to

32
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,314
show them around-

33
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,117
By the way, where are you going?
I was going to the city,

34
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,314
but my bike broke down-
I don't know what is wrong with it-

35
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,486
I am taking the girls to show
them around- I will take them to

36
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:36,992
a place which they will hate-
They will always remember Raju

37
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:40,856
guide for it-
Coming! See you!

38
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,995
Bye!
We'll meet again-

39
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,673
Has everyone come?
Stop the bus!

40
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:54,339
Please stop the bus-
Look she missed her bus

41
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:12,358
Help me! I came from Mumbai

42
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,496
Look, I would like to help you,
but my bike-----

43
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:23,035
Do anything, but help me
Catch that bus-

44
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:25,210
You want to catch this bus?
Yes-

45
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,903
Hundred percent?
Don't blame me later-

46
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,758
Kiran, where were you?
Lets go

47
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,817
Hey mister where are you sending
the girls

48
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:48,544
Madam that's a popular spot its name is Yahaan Giri falls

49
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:55,294
She fell down that's why its name is
Yahaan Giri

50
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,158
Idiot you don't know where you are
taking us

51
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,492
We will go and see by ourselves

52
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,767
Kiran where are you going?
I am coming

53
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:15,211
Are you alright? I hope you didn't
miss your bus

54
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:21,551
Help is ready .No thanks but your
style of helping is good

55
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:25,951
Why your saying thanks I had fun too

56
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:32,763
By the way this place is very beautiful
Yes that's true

57
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:38,200
I call it heaven
Yes but to show this heaven Raju guide

58
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:39,871
doesn't have sense

59
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,972
Why are you blaming him ? poor guy he
is earning for living

60
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:49,237
By the way if you want to see this
beautiful place I can take you around

61
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:59,382
Really, are you guide
No but I know all the places

62
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,695
What are you going to show me?
Here Goddess temple is veryfamous

63
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,894
Would you like to see that
Yes wanna go

64
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:14,896
Not today
See at the bottom of that mountain

65
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:17,905
there is the Goddess temple
Its one dayjourney if you want to

66
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:25,350
Can we go tomorrow
What am I doing tomorrow?

67
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,778
Yes,
I am free-

68
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:30,286
Be ready at 5:30, okay?
Okay-

69
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:37,426
By the way, I am Suraj-
Kiran-

70
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:41,653
When did you come?
I came just now-

71
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:46,654
I was ready before time-
I thought of waiting outside for

72
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,993
you- Let'sgo-

73
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:57,508
Suraj, this is a dangerous place-
You are scared?

74
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,013
I am not! I don't get scared-

75
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:06,010
But you are lucky that
you have been blessed to live in

76
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,845
such a lovely place-

77
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:13,347
Yes, I have been blessed-
You look very happy-

78
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:20,397
I am happy-Aren't you happy?
I am very very----

79
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:15,079
What happened?
You said you don't get scared-

80
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,108
You played a prank!
Don't you feel ashamed

81
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:46,113
to play such a dirty prank?

82
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:49,314
I don't want to go anywhere with you

83
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,858
Kiran, don't you want to see the
Goddess's temple?

84
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:57,588
No-
Alright, I am going-

85
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,798
Now you come behind me-

86
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,725
This is for you

87
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,219
Do you know what I asked for?
Don't tell me- The people here

88
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,220
believe that if you reveal
what you have asked for, your

89
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:32,216
wish doesn't get fulfilled-
Oh-

90
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,228
What are you thinking?
Just that what you must have

91
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:38,225
asked for-

92
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,233
Not to take back what he's given
me-

93
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,230
But you revealed what you asked
for!

94
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,573
This is not my wish,it is my
ardent prayer-

95
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:58,508
Then what was that what I asked
for? A wish?

96
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:43,287
Take your jacket, I don'twant
it-

97
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,623
Keep it, you still have to go
home- You will feel cold-

98
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,961
Okay, I am going-

99
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:53,972
What is the hurry, have coffee
and go-

100
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:59,835
Coffee? Actually, it is late-
My family must be worried-

101
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:04,308
Some other time-
There should be time for another

102
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:08,316
time- We are all going back
tomorrow morning-

103
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:22,324
You are going and
you did not even tell me?

104
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,339
If you talk about leaving before
you leave, it hurts-

105
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:35,245
Then why did you tellmenow?

106
00:24:38,283 --> 00:24:42,686
Because I want to meet you,
before leaving-

107
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:54,029
Let us have the coffee-

108
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:15,387
Where were you?
Where are mom and dad

109
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,635
Go and have dinner
by now must be cold

110
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,409
I had gone to Goddess temple

111
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:44,746
You go anywhere- have we ever
stopped you going anywhere

112
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:50,081
Whole day we are busy in our work

113
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:57,418
I feel that we should have our dinner
together and share our thoughts

114
00:26:04,203 --> 00:26:06,103
Do you know how much you worried
your mom?

115
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:13,434
You could have called to say you
would be late so we wouldn't worry

116
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,450
Since morning you have gone now
look at the time

117
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:21,445
Various kinds of thought occurred to us

118
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:28,786
It wont happen again-
fine go eat

119
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:34,462
You also come-
I already ate-

120
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,129
I know nobody ate-

121
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,143
Lets go

122
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:54,945
Suraj, comeon get  up- Yourfather is
not feeling well

123
00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:08,527
Call Doctor
Lets take him to the hospital

124
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,650
They left by the morning train-

125
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:56,657
Come on get up
Hey,my bottle!

126
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:05,610
If the girls have stayed in the hotel
I would have got address from him

127
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:10,214
But they stayed in a private bungalow-
How can I get their address now?

128
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:13,044
There must be some manager or owner
who must be knowing theiraddress-

129
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,516
This is weird-
You don'tunderstand-

130
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,689
The owner lives in America and the
keys are with someone

131
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,356
who lives in Mumbai-
When people come here to stay, he

132
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:21,685
sends thekeysalong with them, and
asks them to bring back thekeys-

133
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,521
And the servants?
You are saying the same thing

134
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,699
Why don't you understand?
The servants come with the party

135
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:31,699
and return with them-
Tell me what I should do-

136
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:39,711
Whatisit?
Suraj, you don'tunderstand-

137
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,715
You are a handsome man,
And are also smart- There is no

138
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:45,712
dearth for girls for you-
You can get any number of girls-

139
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:51,712
Do you know,50girlsarearriving
from Delhi in theevening-

140
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:15,736
Oh my God, what I have done
I should stop drinking

141
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:21,750
Oh my God what is this
It's Kiran's letter

142
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:46,444
Sorry friend, it flew away-

143
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:02,718
Suraj, come up,
father is calling you-

144
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:13,225
father, you called me?
Yes son, come, sit and have tea-

145
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:22,874
I have received transfer orders-
I have to chose between

146
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,539
Delhi and Mumbai-

147
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,875
A group of girls has come from
Mumbai- I have got the

148
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:30,874
contract to show them around-
Mumbai-

149
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:35,879
Why Mumbai? Why not Delhi?
We have many relatives in Delhi,

150
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:39,887
and even the groom we have selected
for Asha lives in Delhi-

151
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:42,560
That way, even Asha will not be far
away from us-

152
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,457
Look, to maintain relationships,
you mustkeep a distance

153
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:52,665
Alright son, tell me, why do you
want to go to Mumbai?

154
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:57,705
I will get admission in a college
in Mumbai-

155
00:33:57,943 --> 00:33:59,911
That will be good for my career-

156
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:04,245
Why didn't you say that before?
I would have got you admitted there

157
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:05,916
last year it self-

158
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:08,920
You are aware that I cannot live
without you-Do whatever

159
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:12,389
you deem right-

160
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,929
If that's the case, we will go to
Mumbai-

161
00:35:01,006 --> 00:35:05,966
You area fresher- This is your
first day in college-

162
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,987
You will have to do what we say-
Right-

163
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:32,003
You can escape us,but how will you
escape these girls?

164
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:35,002
You will have to come to us,right?

165
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:11,702
What do you want?

166
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:24,055
Just put the ball in the basket
and leave-

167
00:37:39,164 --> 00:37:43,123
Time please---just a minute-
What is it?

168
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:16,227
Wait, friend---Come on,
Why are you annoyed?

169
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:19,230
All this was just a joke-
Even we have suffered all this-

170
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:25,225
I had even broken my leg-
and this guy was in hospital for

171
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:29,232
a month-

172
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:35,076
But we are all good friends today-
Yes man-

173
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:41,252
Will you make friends with us?
Hey, come on!

174
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:16,636
You are not ready yet? Our team is
going to be selected and you are

175
00:46:17,014 --> 00:46:19,642
still home? Come on, get ready!
Where are Sam and Billy?

176
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:21,644
We have to pick them up on our way-
At least you come down-

177
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,486
You proceed ! I'm coming-

178
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:26,657
Hurry up, I am waiting for you-
Come soon-

179
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:29,990
Yes, you'll proceed! I'm coming-

180
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:39,670
Everybody here, please! All of you
come here- Who is in the shower?

181
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:47,678
The team for this year has been
selected-Has everybody come

182
00:46:50,715 --> 00:46:52,342
Allright--here is the team--

183
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:30,380
I knew it while playing the match
itself that we all will get selected

184
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:32,715
Suraj, you have given very good
choice- Simply great-

185
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:35,726
That was a great pass- If he had
not done that, we would not have

186
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:38,394
gotselected in the team today-
Greatpass, Suraj-

187
00:47:40,765 --> 00:47:42,733
Yes, you turned outto bea true
friend- Thanks-

188
00:47:43,768 --> 00:47:45,736
No thanks in friendship-

189
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:49,735
Aaj to party honi chahiye--

190
00:47:57,782 --> 00:48:02,412
What is available in your hotel?
Lots of things are available in our

191
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,747
hotel- I will read out the menu-

192
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:20,703
Sam, you are always reciting
poetry-Recite something on him-

193
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:25,173
I will recite a nice couplet for
you today-

194
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:28,779
Look, the sky is kissing the earth-
And the earth,looking at the sky,

195
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:33,776
is feeling euphoric
Waw

196
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:25,825
I didn't have any way I could find
out about you-

197
00:49:57,568 --> 00:50:00,537
Papa received transfer orders
and we came to Mumbai-

198
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:02,873
I was sure I will meet you here-

199
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,543
After you left Dalhousie,
There was a kind of emptiness in my

200
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:20,880
life- I kept looking for  you
in those places where we had spent

201
00:50:21,258 --> 00:50:26,890
wonderful moments together-
But I always felt your presence

202
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:32,896
around me-
You had become my life'smisison,

203
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:38,902
my goal-
I had so much to tell you when you

204
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,912
were not around-And now that you
are here, I want to tell you that

205
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:57,920
I love you- I love you very much-

206
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:12,932
How much do you know aboutme,
Suraj?

207
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:15,946
Who am I?
What kind of a person am I?

208
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:20,940
Which family I belong to?
You know nothing-

209
00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:26,355
Without knowing someone, without
giving it a thought,

210
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,959
you are making a decision-
I have not made a decision-

211
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:31,787
I have loved-

212
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:38,958
If you think I don't deserve your
love,

213
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:46,306
I don't have the courage to
hearNo-

214
00:51:51,015 --> 00:51:53,984
Kiran, if you like---

215
00:54:38,182 --> 00:54:41,151
Then we fix the 18th of this month-
Yes-

216
00:54:42,186 --> 00:54:44,154
Please have something-
You did not have anything-

217
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:46,148
You don'thave to be formal-
We have stayed long enough,

218
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:48,881
We should be leaving now-

219
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:50,922
Wait for some more time,
Suraj must be on his way home-

220
00:54:59,203 --> 00:55:00,500
There! Even Suraj has come-

221
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:02,934
Where are you going?
Please sit down-

222
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:07,471
You made us wait so long-
Sorry uncle, I got late in college-

223
00:55:07,878 --> 00:55:10,176
It's alright, son-
All the marriage issues have been

224
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:12,515
finalised-Asha is going to come to
our house in Delhi as a bride

225
00:55:12,716 --> 00:55:14,183
on the 18th of this month-

226
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:19,788
That's great news-
Please sit down-

227
00:55:20,057 --> 00:55:23,049
No, we will leave now,
it is late already-

228
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:25,855
We came from Delhi today and are
leaving tomorrow- We have to meet

229
00:55:26,063 --> 00:55:28,190
our relatives who live here or they
will feel offended-

230
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:43,213
You are still not married, and you
arealready getting annoyed with me

231
00:55:44,248 --> 00:55:45,943
Where were you until now?

232
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,708
Papa had told you thatwe
are expecting guests at home today-

233
00:55:52,256 --> 00:55:54,224
Don't show me your teeth, or I will
knock them out!

234
00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:58,228
But I am very happy today-
But why are you happy?

235
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,899
Why I am happy? Because you are
going to get married-

236
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:07,466
You will finally leave this house
forever-

237
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:10,467
Then there will be peace in this
house and we will be able to

238
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:12,238
breath easy-

239
00:56:19,283 --> 00:56:20,910
What did you say?

240
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:35,926
You aregrown to getmarried
You don't need to butter me-

241
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:43,273
There will be peace at
home after I leave?

242
00:56:43,974 --> 00:56:50,277
Alright, I will go and will never
come again-

243
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,288
You feel like crying? Then cry-
Alright,beat me- Okay?

244
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:06,296
Did it hurt?
I will not tell you anything-

245
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:10,300
You were going to tell me
something-Alright, tell me,

246
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:13,629
please!

247
00:57:15,339 --> 00:57:16,966
Okay you can beat me

248
00:57:48,372 --> 00:57:51,341
Do you know, I had even
made dad run like this in my

249
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:58,345
childhood-My dad is so lovable-

250
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:02,344
And your mummy?
She is no more-

251
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:10,349
What I regret is that I did not get
much time to spend with her-

252
00:58:13,397 --> 00:58:17,766
But Dad fulfilled that gap
Never reminded I was alone

253
00:58:24,408 --> 00:58:27,377
Tell me, when are you coming to my
house? Asha wants to meet you-

254
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:29,374
Whenever you say-

255
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:34,376
On Asha's engagement day-
Asha says that until she sees

256
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:38,380
the bride who is going to come to
our house, she will not get married

257
00:58:38,755 --> 00:58:43,385
She wants to see your face
first on that day-

258
00:58:44,428 --> 00:58:47,056
Is that so? Then I will definitely
come-

259
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:54,393
Now tell me how much you love me?

260
00:58:59,443 --> 00:59:01,070
I love you a lot

261
01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:31,576
Come son, we will go upstairs-
You proceed, I'm coming-

262
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:53,933
Suraj, are you alright? Please leave
me alone

263
01:08:10,994 --> 01:08:13,963
Put him in the car-

264
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:39,989
Why have you forcibly brought me
here?

265
01:08:41,024 --> 01:08:44,653
To introduce you to all these
people-

266
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:53,992
He is Mr-S-K Khanna, The biggest
businessman of this city

267
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,998
He can buy anything and sell anything-

268
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:03,001
And do you know him?
He is Mr-Kelkar,

269
01:09:04,047 --> 01:09:07,016
the municipal commissioner-
The city's water supply can be shut

270
01:09:07,383 --> 01:09:10,011
down on his word-People will not
get even a drop of water-

271
01:09:13,689 --> 01:09:16,021
And he is Mr-Raut, the police
Commissioner-

272
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:19,357
He can order anyone outof the city
or put any one behind bars-

273
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:29,027
And if he likes,he can also ruin
anybody-

274
01:09:31,074 --> 01:09:33,042
He is Mr-Patil, the Home Minister-

275
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,415
He is Mr-Gokhale, the most renowned
lawyer of the city- It doesn't take

276
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:42,043
him him long to prove true as
untrue and the untrue as the true-

277
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:51,049
And he is the ChiefMinister, a
very distinguished man-People are

278
01:09:51,427 --> 01:09:55,056
afraid to meet his eyes-
I don't need to say anything more

279
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:58,059
than this about him-

280
01:09:59,102 --> 01:10:00,899
Whatever you told me was also not
necessary-

281
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:04,073
Why have I been forcibly brought
here?

282
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:10,079
So that you realise how
inconsequent you are and how high

283
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:12,073
our status is-

284
01:10:14,117 --> 01:10:16,745
Do you know who Chaudhary is?
Who Chaudhary?

285
01:10:54,157 --> 01:10:55,784
Greetings,Mr-CM-

286
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,138
Mr-Cm, you begin the meeting-
Mr-Chaudhary is on his way-

287
01:11:29,192 --> 01:11:31,160
What is your relationship with
Kiran?

288
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:36,157
My relationship with Kiran? That is
a personal matter-

289
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:40,169
When other people's name begins to
get connected with my name, the

290
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:41,996
matter does not remain their
personal matter but becomes my

291
01:11:42,138 --> 01:11:43,105
personal matter-

292
01:11:44,207 --> 01:11:47,176
Because Kiran Choudhary is the only
child of Ranvir Choudhary-

293
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:58,176
I did not know that Kiran was your
daughter-

294
01:11:58,554 --> 01:11:59,851
Stay there!

295
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:10,188
Actually,Mr-Choudhary,Kiran and
I----

296
01:12:10,566 --> 01:12:12,193
If you want to live, leave this
city-

297
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:19,197
The crime you have committed, you
can even be punished with death for it

298
01:12:20,243 --> 01:12:26,204
I very well know ruffians like you-
Trapping an innocent girl from a

299
01:12:26,582 --> 01:12:32,214
rich family is like a gamefor
people like you-

300
01:12:34,257 --> 01:12:38,216
Love is not a game, Mr-Choudhary-
It's a bond

301
01:12:38,928 --> 01:12:44,230
Leave the city or I will make your
life miserable-

302
01:12:45,268 --> 01:12:49,227
Why just the city, I am ready to
leave even this world

303
01:12:49,605 --> 01:12:51,232
if Kiran likes-

304
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,907
Stop your nonsense!

305
01:12:59,415 --> 01:13:05,047
30 days, you alone will be
responsible for what you and your

306
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:08,049
family suffer-

307
01:13:10,092 --> 01:13:17,055
I have seen how powerful you are, I
have heard your threats, and have

308
01:13:17,767 --> 01:13:22,067
understood your status intentions-
You will yourself hand me your

309
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:33,080
daughter within 30 days-

310
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:43,080
You must have  heard oflove but
must not be aware of how

311
01:13:43,793 --> 01:13:49,095
undaunted it is- Love rules the
heart,not power or status

312
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:58,096
You are very foolish- You are not
aware of what I can do- Consider

313
01:13:59,141 --> 01:14:05,102
yourself fortunate that I have
given you 30 days time-

314
01:14:12,154 --> 01:14:13,781
30 days? Alright-

315
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:12,180
Love is strange-
The more I meet you, the more I

316
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:15,176
feel distant from you-

317
01:15:19,221 --> 01:15:23,180
Love is like that-
When the heart says something, the

318
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:30,192
brain is not ready to accept,
and when the brain says something,

319
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:33,194
you fear you'll break your heart-

320
01:15:40,242 --> 01:15:44,872
Mummy and Asha like you very much-
Really?

321
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:48,216
What did they tell you?
Nothing-

322
01:15:49,251 --> 01:15:52,220
They like what I like-
Their happiness lies in mine-

323
01:15:55,257 --> 01:15:56,884
Are you happy?

324
01:15:57,259 --> 01:16:04,222
You know Kiran, since you have come
into my life, you have made my life

325
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,060
bautiful-
When ever you meet me, I am lost in

326
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:09,237
your sweet talks-

327
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:13,234
Really?

328
01:16:19,281 --> 01:16:23,240
Do you know, you and my dad
arealike-

329
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:33,254
I don'tunderstand-
You both lovememore than

330
01:16:33,462 --> 01:16:35,589
yourself-Dad even fears
the thoughtofmy marriage-

331
01:16:35,798 --> 01:16:38,266
Why?
Becauseaftermarriage, I will

332
01:16:38,634 --> 01:16:40,261
leavehim and go away-

333
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:45,266
Butoneday, you have to----
I know, I have to getmarried and

334
01:16:46,308 --> 01:16:52,269
go away- I am hislifeline-
And mine too-

335
01:16:55,317 --> 01:16:57,285
Come, I will takeyou to meetmy
dad today-

336
01:16:59,822 --> 01:17:03,280
Today?
Not today, some other time-

337
01:17:06,328 --> 01:17:12,289
I find him worried these days-
It is strange, butI see the

338
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:18,300
Same expression on his
face that I see on yours-

339
01:17:18,674 --> 01:17:22,633
You two are truly alike-

340
01:17:26,348 --> 01:17:28,976
Well Kiran, you have put
Yourself in a problem-

341
01:17:30,352 --> 01:17:36,313
What will you do with two same
people in your life?

342
01:17:40,362 --> 01:17:45,322
Simple! I will love them
Wholeheartedly-

343
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:38,626
Shanker,is the tea ready?
Yes-

344
01:22:42,664 --> 01:22:44,632
Kiran had gone to meet Suraj again
today-

345
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:59,647
I don't think he has any intention
to leave the city-

346
01:23:04,686 --> 01:23:11,649
I don'tcare about that man- I just
have to get my daughter

347
01:23:12,027 --> 01:23:16,657
out of his clutches-Deshpande,
create a situation where

348
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:23,665
he is forced to leave the city-

349
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,689
How much do the lady fingers cost
Rs-20 for a kilo-

350
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:47,695
Give me a kilo-Here is Rs-20-
for you, the cost is Rs-200 a kilo-

351
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,358
No, it costs Rs-20 a kilo,right?
Madam, I made a mistake- The cost

352
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:55,692
of lady finger
has risen to Rs-200 a kilo-

353
01:23:56,071 --> 01:23:58,699
Have you gone crazy? You just said
it costs Rs-20 a kilo-

354
01:23:59,074 --> 01:24:01,702
Now you tell me it costs Rs-200 a
kilo-Don't youfeel ashamed?

355
01:24:02,077 --> 01:24:04,705
Alright,how much for the
cauliflower? Rs 400 a kilo

356
01:24:05,747 --> 01:24:07,715
You stay quiet! Who is asking you?
Why are you interfering?

357
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:11,712
My job in this city is to ensure
that whatever you purchase should

358
01:24:12,087 --> 01:24:14,715
cost at least 10 times more-

359
01:24:17,759 --> 01:24:19,659
Alright, I will buyfrom another
shop-

360
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:26,723
Go to any shop you like- The cost
will go on increasing by

361
01:24:27,102 --> 01:24:33,735
Rs-200-Mumbai is an expensive city,
madam- If you want things cheap,

362
01:24:34,109 --> 01:24:40,742
leave this city-Mr-Choudhary will
send you rations not just cheap,

363
01:24:41,116 --> 01:24:44,745
but for free-

364
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:47,414
Mr-Choudhary? What do you mean?

365
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:50,758
Ask your son who Mr-Choudhary is

366
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,132
Rock, I am telling you----Do you
know what our families are saying?

367
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:04,439
That there is no need to go to
college-

368
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,437
What could be the problem between
Suraj and Choudhary?

369
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:10,778
Whatever it may be, Suraj is our
friend- If anyone dares to touch

370
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:13,774
him, we will deal with him-

371
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:18,779
Ronny, use yourbrains,not your
heart- Who can dare to mess with

372
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:28,790
Choudhary? Rock, why don'tyou say
something?

373
01:25:30,832 --> 01:25:38,796
I've heard enough from you all! You
all have spoken enough! I am sick

374
01:25:39,508 --> 01:25:45,811
of hearing your nonsense since so
long-Don't come if you'll don't

375
01:25:46,515 --> 01:25:51,817
want to, I will go to my friend-
You call yourselves friends?

376
01:26:12,874 --> 01:26:13,841
How much? What is it? Who are you?
What is the matter? Who are you?

377
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:21,838
I am your well wisher-Mr-Choudhary
has specially appointed me to

378
01:26:22,217 --> 01:26:25,846
trouble you-

379
01:26:26,221 --> 01:26:30,851
But why? What have we done to him?
You have troubled his daughter-

380
01:26:31,226 --> 01:26:35,856
Mr-Choudhary can never
tolerate that-

381
01:26:36,898 --> 01:26:38,866
Mr-Choudhary's daughter? I don't
even know him- What nonsense

382
01:26:39,234 --> 01:26:42,397
are you talking?

383
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:44,198
Suraj does, who is dreaming of
marrying Kiran-

384
01:26:44,906 --> 01:26:48,205
Kiran is Mr-Choudhary'sdaughter?

385
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:52,869
By messing with Mr-Choudhary, you
are inviting your death-

386
01:26:54,483 --> 01:26:55,882
What happened, father?
Nothing, son-

387
01:26:57,919 --> 01:27:02,879
It is in your best interest that
you leave the city and it

388
01:27:03,258 --> 01:27:07,888
is also your only option- You will
meet well wishers like

389
01:27:08,263 --> 01:27:12,893
us often, you understand?

390
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:19,907
Suraj,listen to me-
father,let me go, I'll just be

391
01:27:20,275 --> 01:27:22,903
back-
Listen to me, son- Come upstairs,

392
01:27:23,278 --> 01:27:25,906
it's dinnertime- I am feeling very
hungry-

393
01:27:41,963 --> 01:27:45,922
Come Suraj, the food isready-

394
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:53,930
Suraj, the food is served-

395
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:04,941
Your favorite dishes have been
cooked even today-

396
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:10,958
Last month, I cooked your favorite
dishes-Now don't

397
01:28:11,326 --> 01:28:12,953
complain for two months-
Two months!

398
01:28:13,328 --> 01:28:14,625
You eat, son-
At least the bread is of my choice-

399
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:36,043
Suraj, where are you going?

400
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:42,743
I will be back soon

401
01:29:43,084 --> 01:29:46,713
You should not leave your dinner
midway-

402
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:23,090
Come- Let us have candle
light dinner today-

403
01:32:18,322 --> 01:32:20,290
Hey milkman!

404
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:12,273
Suraj, call up the dairy and order
some milk-

405
01:33:19,383 --> 01:33:21,010
The phone is dead-

406
01:33:27,058 --> 01:33:29,026
Suraj, what is this! You haven't
changed yet?

407
01:33:29,227 --> 01:33:32,355
The match is about to begin-
What is the matter?

408
01:33:34,398 --> 01:33:39,358
Sir,ifI play today,half the team
will not play because of me-

409
01:33:41,405 --> 01:33:44,374
Who will play in the team and who
will not, I will decide that not they

410
01:33:44,742 --> 01:33:48,178
You go and change-
But sir----

411
01:33:48,746 --> 01:33:50,373
I don't want to hear anything! You
are changing and coming

412
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:52,306
out in two minutes-

413
01:35:49,533 --> 01:35:52,161
I will break both your legs by the
time the game iso ver-

414
01:39:58,115 --> 01:40:01,744
It would be fun if you had just
played on the ground-

415
01:40:02,119 --> 01:40:06,749
But you didn't intend to play
there, and I don't intend to

416
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:10,753
play here- You wanted to break my
legs, didn't you? Now

417
01:40:11,128 --> 01:40:16,760
onewho hashisleysfunctioning
will leave from here- Come on!

418
01:48:49,446 --> 01:48:55,407
Dad, take- Vncle, you also have
sweets-Dad,have sweets-

419
01:48:59,456 --> 01:49:02,425
Wow, you've brought sweets-
This tastes good-

420
01:49:02,793 --> 01:49:04,420
It tastes good, doesn't it?
But you did not tell me why you are

421
01:49:04,795 --> 01:49:07,423
distributing sweets-

422
01:49:08,465 --> 01:49:14,426
My friend won the football match
today-He played so well- If you

423
01:49:14,805 --> 01:49:19,435
had watched him, you'd be
surprised- The opposition was after

424
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:24,440
his life, but he continued to play-
It was real fun, dad- I really

425
01:49:24,815 --> 01:49:29,445
enjoyed it- Why aren't
you'll eating  the sweets? Have it,

426
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:34,457
dad- I'm really happy-
I am going to throw a big party for

427
01:49:34,825 --> 01:49:36,952
my friend-
Okay,bye!

428
01:50:27,544 --> 01:50:31,503
There is nothing left- You had said
you will set everything right-

429
01:50:31,882 --> 01:50:34,510
You only tell me how I run the
house now-

430
01:50:34,885 --> 01:50:37,513
I have just two fistfuls of rice
left-

431
01:50:37,888 --> 01:50:40,516
Yes, I know we have a problem-
Wherever I go, Choudhary's men

432
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:44,520
follow me like a shadow-
Whenever I am about to buy

433
01:50:45,562 --> 01:50:50,192
something, they snatch my purse
and give all themoney to the

434
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:57,529
shopkeeper- I am fed up!
I don't know what to do-

435
01:51:01,578 --> 01:51:05,537
We will have to do something-
If Suraj comes to know,he

436
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:09,552
will lose courage-

437
01:51:19,596 --> 01:51:22,565
Roch, You at this time? Come---

438
01:51:35,612 --> 01:51:37,239
What is all this?

439
01:51:41,618 --> 01:51:43,245
Give him-

440
01:51:47,624 --> 01:51:51,253
See how happy Suraj is to see you
here?

441
01:51:51,628 --> 01:51:54,597
Rock, I will go and recite a
couplet to him- That will bring a

442
01:51:54,965 --> 01:51:56,432
smile on his face-

443
01:51:56,633 --> 01:51:59,602
Sam, try to understand sometimes
at least-

444
01:52:09,646 --> 01:52:11,273
Rock, what is all this?

445
01:52:12,649 --> 01:52:17,609
Choudhary's men can stop you from
buying rations,not the entire city

446
01:52:50,687 --> 01:52:54,646
Amrita, these boys have  come as
angels and proved that goodness can

447
01:52:55,025 --> 01:53:00,657
never cease to exist n this world-

448
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:05,657
I am overwhelmed when I realise
that there are parents better than

449
01:53:06,036 --> 01:53:08,664
us who imbue such culture in their
children which

450
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:12,668
preserves the hope of humanity in
mankind-

451
01:53:31,728 --> 01:53:33,696
Come with us, sir has called you-

452
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:45,708
On what charge?

453
01:53:46,076 --> 01:53:48,704
You are being arrested on charge
Of selling secret documents of

454
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:50,706
our country to another country-

455
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,709
You are mistaken, sir- I--

456
01:53:54,751 --> 01:53:56,719
Who are you trying to compete
with? If you had made your son see

457
01:53:57,087 --> 01:53:59,055
sense, you would probably have
saved yourself-Now rot in jail

458
01:53:59,255 --> 01:54:02,053
like a criminal-

459
01:54:02,759 --> 01:54:04,727
But sir, I have done no such thing-

460
01:54:05,095 --> 01:54:07,723
I know Prakash Sexena that a middle
classman can never earn lots of

461
01:54:08,098 --> 01:54:10,726
money, he can only earn respect-

462
01:54:11,101 --> 01:54:15,561
You have earned enough respect,now
you'll earn disgrace-

463
01:55:22,839 --> 01:55:29,802
father, what have I done! A son
becomes successful only when his

464
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:36,813
father begins to be recognised by
his son's name- That is what you

465
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:44,821
taught me- But I have brought you
shame- You are being punished for

466
01:55:45,195 --> 01:55:49,825
what I have done-

467
01:55:54,871 --> 01:55:58,830
If Choudhary thinks it is a crime
to love, then I have committed that

468
01:55:59,209 --> 01:56:02,178
crime- I should be punished for it,
not you,not myfamily-

469
01:56:02,879 --> 01:56:09,842
Your son is right- You have neither
committed a crime nor a sin- Though

470
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:16,853
you have made one mistake-
You are the father of that arrogant

471
01:56:17,227 --> 01:56:23,860
son who did not do my bidding-But
this is not the end, Saxena, it is

472
01:56:24,234 --> 01:56:30,867
just the begining-

473
01:56:31,908 --> 01:56:36,868
You cannot even imagine what the
end is going to be-

474
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:41,877
You could havemade your son see
sense, but you did not do that-

475
01:56:42,252 --> 01:56:46,882
Perhaps your golden dreams made you
stay quiet-

476
01:56:50,927 --> 01:56:54,886
Your son kept crossing his limits
and you kept encouraging him- I

477
01:56:55,265 --> 01:57:01,898
snatched everything from you today,
your job, yourself respect, your

478
01:57:02,272 --> 01:57:09,906
honour, everything! But there is
still time, Saxena-

479
01:57:10,947 --> 01:57:13,916
If you can makeyour
impudent son see sense, do it-Ask

480
01:57:14,284 --> 01:57:16,912
him to go far away from my daughter
and this city- I will return

481
01:57:17,287 --> 01:57:20,916
everything to you,

482
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:27,930
Just one word from me and your
entire family will be allowed to

483
01:57:28,298 --> 01:57:30,596
live in peace-

484
01:57:31,968 --> 01:57:35,927
I had heard about God, and seen him
in idols until today-But I am

485
01:57:36,306 --> 01:57:39,935
seeing God in actual form today-

486
01:57:40,977 --> 01:57:45,937
You will allow us to live? That is
your misconception,

487
01:57:46,316 --> 01:57:48,944
You are under a misconception that
I have lost something and you can

488
01:57:49,319 --> 01:57:50,616
return it-
What have I lost?

489
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:53,948
I have lost nothing in the eyes of
my family or myself-No one can

490
01:57:54,324 --> 01:57:57,953
snatch your selfrespect from you-
I am not ashamed of what my son has

491
01:57:58,328 --> 01:58:00,956
done-

492
01:58:01,331 --> 01:58:04,630
He has loved-He has faith in his
love-

493
01:58:05,001 --> 01:58:08,960
And he has the courage to fight a
man like you who is against love- I

494
01:58:09,339 --> 01:58:12,968
am proud ofSuraj- If you were also
fortunate to have a son like Suraj,

495
01:58:13,343 --> 01:58:18,645
even you would be proud of him-

496
01:58:25,021 --> 01:58:27,649
I think his entire family has gone
mad-

497
01:58:30,026 --> 01:58:32,995
Saxena, a poorman's pride cannot
act as his shield , but can bring

498
01:58:33,363 --> 01:58:34,990
his death-

499
01:58:35,365 --> 01:58:37,993
And you are not aware ofRanvir
Choudhary's power-

500
01:58:46,042 --> 01:58:49,011
Enough Mr-Choudhary! We know how
powerful you are-

501
01:58:52,048 --> 01:58:57,008
We are not proud, we are courageous
And courage can move even

502
01:58:57,387 --> 01:59:02,017
mountains, then you arej usta
small hill in comparison- You

503
01:59:02,392 --> 01:59:08,024
cannot break us-

504
01:59:14,070 --> 01:59:18,029
Kiran is neither a misson,nor an
achievement for me- She is my

505
01:59:18,408 --> 01:59:21,036
prayer,my worship,

506
01:59:21,411 --> 01:59:27,043
and no onec an stop me from
worshipping her-No one!

507
01:59:36,092 --> 01:59:42,053
Saxena, once I lose my temper, I'll
bring about your ruin-before time

508
01:59:42,432 --> 01:59:48,064
is lost, try to make your son see
sense, or you will regret it-

509
02:00:30,146 --> 02:00:32,114
You give me the bail papers-

510
02:00:45,161 --> 02:00:47,129
Release Saxena-
Yes sir-

511
02:01:01,177 --> 02:01:05,136
Papa,please forgive me-

512
02:01:05,515 --> 02:01:07,142
No dear, you are not to be blamed
for this-

513
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:07,198
Are you  angry?
Don't talk to me! Who do you think

514
02:02:08,244 --> 02:02:16,208
you are! Do you think you can fight
the world alone? What do you want

515
02:02:16,586 --> 02:02:23,219
to prove? That you are  great? That
you are powerful?

516
02:02:38,274 --> 02:02:45,237
Dad was so unfair to you and you
quietly tolerated everything? You

517
02:02:45,615 --> 02:02:52,248
have so much patience, Suraj- You
had to suffer so much because of me

518
02:02:52,622 --> 02:02:58,254
and you did not even let me know
about it- You felt I didn't deserve

519
02:02:58,628 --> 02:03:01,256
to know-
I tried to tell you many times-But

520
02:03:01,964 --> 02:03:11,271
when I saw how much you loved your
dad,how could I tell you? I know

521
02:03:12,308 --> 02:03:19,271
there is a strong bond between you
and your dad-

522
02:03:21,317 --> 02:03:25,276
What kind of a bond is this, Suraj?
I cannot believe he is doing this

523
02:03:25,655 --> 02:03:28,818
to us- I will never meet him-

524
02:03:31,327 --> 02:03:36,287
Do you have faith in me? Do you
have faith in our love?

525
02:03:36,666 --> 02:03:40,295
Then you should also respect your
father's feelings

526
02:03:41,337 --> 02:03:49,301
I am scared, Suraj- I will not be
able to live without you-

527
02:03:50,346 --> 02:03:54,305
Stupid girl, I will never let that
happen-

528
02:03:55,351 --> 02:04:01,312
You don't know him, Suraj-
I know him very well now-He loves

529
02:04:09,699 --> 02:04:15,331
you very much-And a man who can
feel that kind oflove, cannot hate

530
02:04:15,705 --> 02:04:24,340
anyone forlong- Come it is late,
I'll drop you home-

531
02:04:46,402 --> 02:04:53,365
You were only two and a half when I
took this picture- It was your

532
02:04:53,743 --> 02:05:00,376
first day at school and you were
crying-Deshpande said itis

533
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:07,383
normal, every child cries on his
first day to school-Because it is

534
02:05:07,757 --> 02:05:14,390
the first time he is separated from
his parents-But I could not bear

535
02:05:14,764 --> 02:05:21,397
to see tears in my daughter's eyes-
I decided that I will start a

536
02:05:21,771 --> 02:05:28,404
school in my house- I stayed with
you in school everyday, until I saw

537
02:05:28,778 --> 02:05:35,411
a smile on yourface- Whenever I
was faced with some major problem,

538
02:05:35,785 --> 02:05:42,418
I would
look at your face- It evoked such

539
02:05:42,792 --> 02:05:49,425
inspiration in me you, that
I could face the whole world then-

540
02:05:49,799 --> 02:05:54,429
Yet, why do I not see that
same face today? Why do I not see

541
02:05:54,804 --> 02:05:59,434
the face that made Ranvir,Ranvir
Choudhary?

542
02:06:01,477 --> 02:06:04,446
Dad, I am what I was before-

543
02:06:04,814 --> 02:06:06,441
Then why can'tyou evoke the same
courage in me?

544
02:06:11,487 --> 02:06:15,446
Kiran, you have never kept any
secrets from me until today-

545
02:06:15,825 --> 02:06:18,453
Because you have never done
anything thatc an put me to shame-

546
02:06:22,498 --> 02:06:29,461
But you are standing with your eyes
lowered in my presence today- Suraj

547
02:06:31,507 --> 02:06:35,466
is a wrong which I can forgive even
today-

548
02:06:37,513 --> 02:06:39,140
Love can never be wrong-

549
02:06:39,515 --> 02:06:43,474
But man can be wrong-

550
02:06:45,521 --> 02:06:51,153
I have
suffered bitter truths of life-

551
02:06:51,527 --> 02:06:55,486
I have gone through the worst-
I have come across all kinds of

552
02:06:55,865 --> 02:07:00,495
people- I know what is right and
wrong better than you-

553
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:05,500
What you call love does not exist
in real life-

554
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:10,505
I know you can never behappy with
Suraj- I will never be able to

555
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:15,510
firgive myself if I see you
unhappy,

556
02:07:15,885 --> 02:07:20,515
Child I have always thought in your
interest, and always will-

557
02:07:21,557 --> 02:07:30,522
Then why am I scared, dad? Suraj
respects you a lot-He believes

558
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:37,533
that one who loves, cannot hate a
anyone for long-

559
02:07:38,574 --> 02:07:44,535
He sheds his selfishness,because
he wants to retain that love- And I

560
02:07:44,914 --> 02:07:49,544
know my dad is not selfish-

561
02:08:08,604 --> 02:08:11,573
I am the same as I was earlier-

562
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:38,589
Today's day was real good,
Everybody supported you

563
02:08:38,968 --> 02:08:41,596
No one even dared to blink until
you were speaking-

564
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:46,608
Actually, I had become very
emotional-

565
02:08:46,976 --> 02:08:49,604
I cannot express how much
destruction the Gujarat earthquake

566
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:51,606
has brought-
And whatI am happy about is that

567
02:08:51,981 --> 02:08:53,608
everyone has been very generous
with contributions-

568
02:08:53,983 --> 02:08:55,610
We have collected 200 million-

569
02:09:01,657 --> 02:09:04,626
Suraj is leaving the city-
Are you telling me this or are you

570
02:09:04,994 --> 02:09:06,621
asking me?

571
02:09:07,663 --> 02:09:10,632
Pardon me, Mr-Choudhary,butI read
it in the newspaper, that is why I

572
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,627
am asking you-

573
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:15,630
In which newspaper?
What was reported?

574
02:09:16,005 --> 02:09:19,634
It was reported that when you came
to know that

575
02:09:20,009 --> 02:09:22,637
Prakash Saxena had been charged
with treachery, you personally

576
02:09:23,012 --> 02:09:25,640
went to meet him in jail and said
that a patriot like him can even

577
02:09:26,015 --> 02:09:28,643
sacrifice his life for the country-
And that he can never dream of

578
02:09:29,018 --> 02:09:30,849
betrayal- Look-

579
02:09:37,693 --> 02:09:39,320
Yes sir?

580
02:09:41,697 --> 02:09:43,665
Who owns LokJagran?

581
02:09:46,035 --> 02:09:48,663
I have told you several times that
my name should not

582
02:09:49,038 --> 02:09:50,665
appear in any newspaper as a
controversy- Then how come

583
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,667
my name was published by this
newspaper? And that too,

584
02:09:53,042 --> 02:09:55,340
in Saxena's case?

585
02:09:55,711 --> 02:09:57,406
Sir, I don'tunderstand how this
happened-

586
02:09:57,613 --> 02:09:59,672
Deshpande, people have begun to
raise questions-

587
02:10:00,049 --> 02:10:02,677
Their voices will be supresssed,

588
02:10:08,724 --> 02:10:10,692
Where are you since morning? I have
been calling your residence- The

589
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:13,028
bell is ringing but noone is
answering the call-

590
02:10:15,731 --> 02:10:18,700
The house is locked since morning-
I don'tknow where father and

591
02:10:19,068 --> 02:10:22,697
mother are- Rock, this has never
happened-

592
02:10:23,072 --> 02:10:25,700
I am afraid that-----
That Choudhary----

593
02:10:33,749 --> 02:10:37,708
What nonsense are you talking? Yes,
I am coming- I am leaving right away

594
02:10:38,754 --> 02:10:41,090
What happened?
Choudhary's men beatup Billy-

595
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:43,183
Billy? Where is he?
In hospital-

596
02:10:43,759 --> 02:10:46,728
Let's go-
No, you wait here- It is possible

597
02:10:47,096 --> 02:10:49,724
that your parents return- I will
and see Billy and call you up from

598
02:10:50,099 --> 02:10:51,726
there- But you also stay in touch-

599
02:12:03,839 --> 02:12:07,798
Tell me where my parents are!

600
02:14:23,979 --> 02:14:32,944
Suraj, leave him-He will die-

601
02:14:39,995 --> 02:14:42,964
I will kill everybody! I will not
spare anybody-

602
02:14:43,332 --> 02:14:46,961
Suraj, your parents are with me-
They are safe- What do

603
02:15:33,448 --> 02:15:37,009
I searched the entire city-Kiran,
come home-

604
02:16:42,117 --> 02:16:46,076
Mr-Choudhary,hadn't I told you
that love is not a deception-

605
02:16:47,456 --> 02:16:50,084
Mr-Choudhary,Kiran belongs to you,
and today she will go with you-But you

606
02:16:50,459 --> 02:16:53,087
will one day give her in marriage
to me with your blessings-

607
02:18:12,207 --> 02:18:14,175
What happened, Suraj? What are you
thinking?

608
02:18:18,213 --> 02:18:21,182
There is so much difference between
life's truth and ideals-

609
02:18:24,219 --> 02:18:29,851
I was confident that Mr-Choudhary
will gradually understand our feelings

610
02:18:33,228 --> 02:18:35,526
But what happened today was not
right-

611
02:18:41,236 --> 02:18:42,863
What will happen now, Suraj?

612
02:18:44,239 --> 02:18:51,202
I only ignited this bomb-Now it
will blast, what else?

613
02:23:23,518 --> 02:23:28,478
Deshpande, today onwards I should
never see Suraj

614
02:24:10,565 --> 02:24:12,192
Go upstairs and find him-

615
02:24:21,576 --> 02:24:23,544
This place is locked-

616
02:24:37,592 --> 02:24:39,219
Where is Suraj?
I don't know, sir-

617
02:24:39,427 --> 02:24:40,553
You don'tknow where Suraj is?

618
02:24:51,606 --> 02:24:57,567
I don't know,but his bike is parked
here- Maybe he is somewhere here

619
02:25:11,626 --> 02:25:13,253
Why are you smashing
Suraj's bike?

620
02:25:17,632 --> 02:25:19,259
Where is Suraj?

621
02:25:53,668 --> 02:25:56,637
Suraj, Choudhary's men are looking
for you-

622
02:25:57,005 --> 02:25:58,632
When Rock and Sam did not reveal
anything, they started beating them-

623
02:25:59,007 --> 02:26:00,634
You run away, Suraj-
Come with me!

624
02:26:13,688 --> 02:26:17,647
You took long coming, and he took
long in telling you-

625
02:26:33,708 --> 02:26:40,671
No Deshpande, I took long in coming,
and you took long in leavingfrom here

626
02:26:43,718 --> 02:26:45,345
Beat the rogue!

627
02:30:49,297 --> 02:30:50,924
Deshpande, what happened about Suraj
Enough, Mr-Choudhary, I cannot

628
02:30:51,299 --> 02:31:00,935
tolerate it any more-
You have won, I am defeated-

629
02:31:02,977 --> 02:31:09,940
You want me to leave this
city, don't you? I am leaving-But

630
02:31:10,318 --> 02:31:15,278
not alone, I am taking
your daughter along-

631
02:31:45,019 --> 02:31:50,980
Come, Mr-Choudhary- I knew you
would definetly come-

632
02:31:57,031 --> 02:32:01,991
Where is Kiran? I ask you where is
Kiran!

633
02:32:07,041 --> 02:32:11,000
What do you think? That Kiran is
with me?

634
02:32:11,379 --> 02:32:17,011
If I had to do this with Kiran,
I would have left the city

635
02:32:17,385 --> 02:32:24,018
Long ago- You tell me where my
Kiran is-

636
02:32:49,083 --> 02:32:55,044
You do not own Kiran- She can never
belong to you-

637
02:33:29,123 --> 02:33:32,092
Because you are not worthy of her-
There is so much difference

638
02:33:35,129 --> 02:33:38,098
between your status and hers-

639
02:35:02,216 --> 02:35:09,179
My son is notdefeated,
Mr-choudhary-

640
02:35:09,557 --> 02:35:13,186
But it is the principles I have
taught him that are stopping him-

641
02:35:13,561 --> 02:35:17,190
My son can never be defeated-

642
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:19,250
Mr-Choudhary,Kiran is my prayer,my
faith-My love, my Madness No one

643
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:31,269
can separate herfrom me
Not even you-

644
02:36:34,308 --> 02:36:40,269
You can't do anything-

645
02:36:53,327 --> 02:36:57,286
You will give me Kiran or death?

646
02:38:02,396 --> 02:38:08,357
This is stupidity! It is madness!
I would never believe that anyone

647
02:38:08,736 --> 02:38:16,370
can love my daughter more than me-
I don'thave any more courage to

648
02:38:16,744 --> 02:38:21,374
fight your love-
Suraj Loves you a lot- GO---
