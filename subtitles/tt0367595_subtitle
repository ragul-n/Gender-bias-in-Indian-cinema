1
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,225
Rex, my friend.

2
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,705
I am almost there. I almost
reached my destination.

3
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:13,739
My formula will change
the face of life.

4
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,708
Come, Peter. Come.

5
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,115
I will come, but on one condition.

6
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:26,523
You won't talk about formulas,
medicines, experiments.

7
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,928
..and all that. I am really
fed up of all these.

8
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,993
You shut up, Rex.

9
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,063
Thank you, Peter.
- You are most welcome, sir.

10
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,265
I know that you are a very busy man.

11
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,033
You have only 20 minutes,
but I need just 5 minutes.

12
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,938
Since how many years are you
working in this lab day and night!

13
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,574
You are confined to this
lab like a prisoner.

14
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,553
All the times you just
shake the flask..

15
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,090
..stir some solution in a beaker.

16
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,149
You are awake at night
and you sleep during daytime.

17
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,496
You eat dinner at morning
and at dinnertime you eat lunch.

18
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,227
I feel like running
away from this place.

19
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,092
Oh no, Peter. Don't talk like that.

20
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,234
Who do I have in this world
other than you and Rex?

21
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,203
Do not lie. Don't you
have Miss. Diana?

22
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,509
She loves you so much. When
you don't care for her..

23
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,540
..you will never care for us!
- Peter.

24
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,914
You know how much I am caught
up with these things.

25
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,715
Why are you caught up with
these things! Go out.

26
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,060
You shut up, Rex. You
always back like a dog.

27
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,532
There are some other doctors
as well in this world..

28
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,262
..but no one is mad like
you. Everyone works.

29
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:49,937
They fall in love. They get
married. They have kids.

30
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,670
But you on the other
hand only make drugs.

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,272
What have you done to yourself!

32
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,209
If your mother was alive today..
God bless her soul.

33
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,684
Imagine how bad she would've felt.

34
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,882
And if your father was alive then..
God bless his soul too.

35
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:13,221
Then he would've thrown
out all this scrap.

36
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,898
What a great speech!

37
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,628
Peter, you should've
been a politician.

38
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,603
Forget about me, there's
your speech this evening.

39
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,508
It seems that Dr. Wilson
is coming up..

40
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,242
..with some new idea.
- So what's new in it!

41
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,517
Dr. Wilson has consistently
been coming up with..

42
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,847
..something new in the
world of science.

43
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,251
Let's see what he is
coming up with today.

44
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,112
He is not a magician,
he's a scientist.

45
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,248
He backs his theories with
substantial reasons.

46
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,559
His theories are right only
till they are proven wrong.

47
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,991
And that will happen
sooner than later.

48
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,064
What happened to the lights!
Switch on the lights. Lights.

49
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,793
Why did you make the room dark?

50
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,237
You are afraid of darkness. Right.

51
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,669
Darkness is a dangerous thing.

52
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,079
We feel suffocated.

53
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,515
We feel like dying.

54
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,885
But this is the darkness that
is visible to the naked eye.

55
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,226
There is another darkness
that is there inside us.

56
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,231
The darkness of ignorance..

57
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,503
..which should be looked
at by the men of science.

58
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,234
..and we should be curious
to explore it.

59
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,704
But first of all we need to know
what constitutes human being.

60
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,978
A human being constitutes
of two things.

61
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,912
Goodness and evilness.
Angel and the devil.

62
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:47,123
And these two are caged inside
the four walls of soul.

63
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:52,124
Both are attached with the soul.

64
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,134
And for moment these two
try to kill each other.

65
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:03,469
The person in whom the
evil is strongen.

66
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:10,209
..he wants to steal, rob, kill,
and create mayhem.

67
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,746
And the person in whose
good side is strongen.

68
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,489
..he wants to do things
with love, affection.

69
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,890
..and with justice and respects
the law of the land.

70
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,496
The day human being will be
able to detach the evil..

71
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,499
..from his soul and get
rid of it forever..

72
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,229
..the soul will purify forever.

73
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,731
Then human being will be
left only with goodness.

74
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,939
Then human being will
become an angel.

75
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:46,244
And then there will be only
peace in the world.

76
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,555
No atom bomb will be thrown
on Nagasaki or Hiroshima.

77
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,721
No country will be turned
into Vietnam.

78
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,917
No Gandhi or Lincoln
will be assassinated.

79
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,989
Friends, after innumerable
experiments.

80
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,462
..after days of sweat and toil
I am trying to prepare..

81
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,663
..those chemicals that will
touch the soul through the body.

82
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,202
They will detach the
evil from the soul.

83
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,875
And they will destroy
the evil in us forever.

84
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,943
Dr. Wilson has really gone mad.

85
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,010
Now he will operate upon the soul.

86
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,479
Before he could find out what
is good and what is evi
..

87
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,543
..the patient will die.
- It's great in a way.

88
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,214
At least India's population
will reduce.

89
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,953
Two parts of a human being?
Impossible.

90
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,029
I don't believe it. Mend
your ways, friend.

91
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,226
By God's grace I got a friend,
but he's half mad.

92
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,694
There's a party at Diana's
place this evening.

93
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,827
You remember it, don't you?

94
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,236
Why do you treat me as
a forgetful person?

95
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,503
I remember it very well.
There's Christmas party..

96
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,010
..at Diana's place this evening.
Do you believe me now!

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,508
First I will go to the hospital.
There are a couple of..

98
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,515
..important cases to attend.
From there I will come..

99
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,983
..straight to the party
at 8:30, ok? - Ok.

100
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,737
I made so many plans for this day..

101
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,080
I thought when Wilson comes
here first I will snub him..

102
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,483
...I won't talk to him and
when he apologizes to me..

103
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,212
...I would forgive him immediately.

104
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,545
..and then I would dance with him.

105
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,749
..and then I would be
lost in his arms.

106
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,756
But I am destined for that.
Whom do I complain?

107
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,632
Are you the only one who works..

108
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,731
..or do these people work as well?

109
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,244
Good evening.
- Good evening.

110
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,844
Come.

111
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,982
Shall we?

112
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,652
Are you upset with me?

113
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,655
I might be late, but I
made it here, right?

114
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,858
Now smile.

115
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,794
I see.

116
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,206
Come. - What are you doing!
Father might get upset.

117
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,968
He is always upset. Well,
he's busy for the time being.

118
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,009
He's making someone parade.
Look there.

119
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,813
You don't feel sorry for what
you have done? - No, I don't.

120
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,023
You don't?
- Listen.

121
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,087
If I wasn't late you wouldn't
have been mad at me.

122
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,032
If you weren't mad at me you
wouldn't have looked so pretty.

123
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,905
If you weren't pretty I might
not have loved you as much.

124
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,532
And if I wasn't in love with you
I might not have been late.

125
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,902
And if I wasn't.

126
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:08,918
Friends, now there will be
a Portuguese folk dance.

127
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,278
Diana, let's get married.

128
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,151
I'm not going to marry you.
- Why?

129
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,086
Why? Because you will
be late there as well.

130
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,957
Then let's do one thing.

131
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,968
Let's get married right
now, right here?

132
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:04,542
Right now, right here?
- Yes, right now, right here.

133
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,575
But father won't give
his approval so easily.

134
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,049
I want to marry you,
not your father.

135
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,987
Wow! You look so beautiful
when you laugh.

136
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,784
This the first time I am witnessing
such sort of thing.

137
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,250
A girl looks beautiful
when she's laughing..

138
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,656
..and she's beautiful
even when he's angry.

139
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,739
I wish the time stands still.
- It can stand still, Diana.

140
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:48,279
It can stand still, only
if you wish. - Me?

141
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:55,090
Yes, you. Always be with me.
- Always?

142
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,753
Yes, always.

143
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,907
Marriage.

144
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,512
My dear, marriage is not
such a simple matter..

145
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,054
..that you can take a decision
about in a single day.

146
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:28,118
But Colonel, we have been
engaged since a longtime.

147
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,120
But you gave us nothing except
grief all these days.

148
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,534
And I never felt like the
person I am getting.

149
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,561
..my daughter married to
is apt for her. - Daddy.

150
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,175
Colonel, I am a doctor.

151
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,734
You are saying that to me?
To a military officer?

152
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,144
A military man's life
doesn't belong to him.

153
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,150
It belongs to other. It
belongs to the nation.

154
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,279
But still I maintained
discipline in life.

155
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,749
I always met people at the
time I committed to meet.

156
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,489
I never remember a time
when I gave someone.

157
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,222
..an appointment and
I was ever late.

158
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,495
Colonel, how can there
be any comparison..

159
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,502
...between you and me? You
have never been late..

160
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,505
..after taking an appointment
and I on the other hand..

161
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,702
..am always late even if there
is not an appointment.

162
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,045
There's a small request, colonel.

163
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,516
Treat our wedding
as an appointment.

164
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,051
..and don't let it happen on time.

165
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,252
Please, daddy.
- Alright.

166
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,795
The day after your birthday
you will get married.

167
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,124
But Diana's birthday is in June.
It's after ten long months.

168
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,531
So what! Marriage is
not child's play..

169
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,571
..that it can happen
any time you wish.

170
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,771
We can argue about this
matter late on. - Argue?

171
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,134
I mean we will talk about it.

172
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,278
Goodnight.
- Listen.

173
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,948
Don't repeat what you
have done today.

174
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,617
Daddy.

175
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,488
Why have you immersed yourself
so much in work..

176
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,900
..that you don't get time to go
anywhere? - But I enjoy it.

177
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,735
I have fun working. I know
how manage my time.

178
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,502
I know when to spend
time with my love..

179
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,172
..with my patients and
with my experiments.

180
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,640
Your love, your patients
are all fine.

181
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,709
But your experiments will put
you into deep trouble some day.

182
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,978
And why would that happen!

183
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,520
Whenever a scientist said something
new in this wor
d..

184
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,118
...people said the same things
that you are saying now.

185
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,129
But every scientist knows
his limits, his boundaries.

186
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,931
And you are crossing your lines.

187
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,564
Lines? What lines are
you talking about?

188
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,929
Wilson, I am talking
about the 
ines..

189
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,063
..that a human being cannot cross.
Those are drawn by Him.

190
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,674
Look, David, I told this earlier
and I am telling you again.

191
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,006
I don't believe in God.
I am an atheist.

192
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:10,486
These religions and Gods are the
creation of timid people..

193
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,491
..with weak mind who don't
have faith in themselves.

194
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,494
..who can't take life head on.
Such type of peop
e..

195
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,497
..start believing in such
type of illusions..

196
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,090
..and you start worshiping them.

197
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,967
Say whatever you want to say today..

198
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,038
..because there's an invisible
blindfold on your eyes.

199
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,102
You can neither see the truth..

200
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,606
..nor will you understand
what I am saying..

201
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,777
..but one day you will definitely
realize your mistake.

202
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,238
Only if it is a mistake.
- I am not joking, Wilson.

203
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,249
Do remember this day and
this conversation.

204
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,544
Come. Come with me. - Leave me.

205
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,856
Come on, come with me.
You leave me alone everyday.

206
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,064
What's going on over there!
- Idiot.

207
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,263
What happened?
- That idiot beats me.

208
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,661
How dare you raise
your hand on a woman!

209
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,204
I will see you. I will see you.

210
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,908
Come. I will drop you to your home.

211
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,740
Where do you live?
- There.

212
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,006
What's all this!
- I haven't done anything, man.

213
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,083
It must be Daisy's lover.
- Keep quiet, man. I'll tell you.

214
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:17,211
It's an everyday affair for us.
- Yes. Daisy beautiful!

215
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,547
Shut up!

216
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,623
Idiot! He twisted my jaw.

217
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,502
Check if my teeth are in place
or some have fallen..

218
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,696
..into stomach. See.

219
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,038
Your teeth are in place.
- Thank God.

220
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,008
But still I won't leave you.

221
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,703
If I don't kill him I
will change my name.

222
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:51,646
See where that idiot
has beaten me. See this.

223
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,649
He has beaten me here.

224
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,198
It's not a wound. It's
just a scratch.

225
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,598
It will heal in a couple of days.

226
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,472
You are so nice. There were
so many people downstairs.

227
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,207
..but you are the only one who
brought me here. - It's ok.

228
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,883
What is this you are wearing?
- This? It's a rubber-band.

229
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,212
Don't wear that.
- Why?

230
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,616
It affects the blood-circulation.

231
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,217
You talk so sweetly.

232
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:35,227
For a man like you I am even
ready to sacrifice my life.

233
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,233
You need not sacrifice your life.

234
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:42,229
Just take good care of your life.
Take rest. Goodnight.

235
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,644
Man, where are you doing now?
Sit here for a while.

236
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,107
Don't talk too much. You need rest.

237
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,241
So stay quiet and lie on the bed.

238
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,850
You want me to lie on the bed?

239
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:02,583
Because I think bed is the best
place to take rest on. - Ok, fine.

240
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,585
But close your eyes first.

241
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,856
Close your eyes.

242
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,203
Now open them.

243
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,616
How are you feeling now?

244
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,522
I'm feeling a lot better.

245
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,544
Are you coming or do you
want me to leave alone?

246
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,243
Miss. Daisy.
- Yes, darling.

247
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,482
I'm not darling. I'm a doctor.

248
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,487
Then doctor, check me once.

249
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,187
I already got one. Bye.

250
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,939
Doctor, come soon.

251
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,944
Come soon. Come soon.

252
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:37,521
Ok? You will come, won't you?
I will be waiting for you.

253
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,884
Sorry. Goodnight.

254
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,688
You are a shameless person.
- Why? What happened?

255
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,223
What were you doing with that girl?

256
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,694
She came into my arms and
I took her into my arms.

257
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,236
And you forgot that you are
getting married to Diana.

258
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,504
You think I forgot Diana?
How can a thirsty man..

259
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,240
..forget the well! But why are
you mixing these things?

260
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,647
Diana is my girlfriend
and she is a patient.

261
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,115
Listen, I am a doctor. If
my touch heals a patient.

262
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,924
..then why shouldn't I help them?
- Oh! Shut up!

263
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:20,562
And yes, don't forget the 8:30
appointment tomorrow. - No.

264
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:21,791
I won't forget. Promise.

265
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,144
Yes, sister, it's me.
- Mrs. Pai has vomited blood.

266
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,019
What! Mrs. Pai has vomited
blood? But..

267
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,817
You take her to the OT and
make the arrangements.

268
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,290
..for an operation. I will
be there right now.

269
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,690
Let's go, David. He won't come.

270
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,161
Oh no!

271
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,887
Peter. Put hot water
in the bathroom.

272
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,560
David.

273
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,532
What are you really up to?
- A bath.

274
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,106
I don't care if you will take
a bath or not. I don't care.

275
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,204
I have been waiting here
for you since four hours.

276
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,904
Why? What happened?

277
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,244
By God, Wilson, there's
a limit to shamelessness.

278
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,045
You promised to meet Diana and
me this morning, didn't you?

279
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,991
This morning..
- I don't want that acting.

280
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,183
Tell me why you didn't come.

281
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,922
David, this morning..

282
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,794
Dear, I am really very
tired right now.

283
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,730
I don't even have enough strength
to talk right now.

284
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,834
Do one thing. You go
to bed right now.

285
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,575
We can talk tomorrow morning.

286
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,270
I can't wait for tomorrow.
I want an answer right now.

287
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,748
I attended three operations
and I'm absolutely fagged up.

288
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,813
That's why it would be better if you
don't say anything to me right now.

289
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,220
What do you think of me!
I am not your servant.

290
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,227
I left my work and my business
and came here for..

291
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,621
..your problems and you don't
even have time to talk to me?

292
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,096
David. David. David.

293
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,497
Right now even if you scold
me, even if get upset.

294
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,232
...I won't get anything.
- Right. You won't get it.

295
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,508
Because you are playing with
an innocent girl's life..

296
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,509
..whose only mistake is
that she loved you..

297
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,705
..and that she has given
you her heart.

298
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,177
You operate upon your
patients' hearts.

299
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,909
Look into her heart once. You
will find your portrait in it.

300
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,512
But you are a stone-hearted person..

301
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,645
..who don't have anything
called love in him.

302
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,121
David, you are talking too much.

303
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,991
I haven't even started, Wilson.

304
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,525
You never cared for Diana. You're
insulting her every time..

305
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,528
..because you might be thinking..

306
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,530
..that you are too good for her,
but the truth is that..

307
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,259
..she is too good for you.

308
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:46,559
You are treating her as if
she a roadside lousy woman.

309
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,033
Sorry, David. Sorry.

310
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,271
I slapped you? I'm sorry.

311
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:05,484
You said something about Diana..

312
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,616
..that I couldn't bear it.

313
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,953
David, Diana is everything for me.

314
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,957
She's my life.

315
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,503
I accept my mistakes, but
whenever I promise..

316
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,500
..to meet Diana some problem
or other arises..

317
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,546
..and I am unable to meet her.

318
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,577
Today three of my patients
were dying with pain.

319
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,583
You should've seen
their eyes, David.

320
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:44,522
Their eyes were saying, 'doctor,
our lives are..

321
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:50,932
...in your hand, only you can save
our lives, please save us.'

322
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,670
How could I have left them
in such a condition!

323
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,509
Sol had to attend the operation.

324
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:08,211
And David, one of them passed away.

325
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,754
I'm really sorry. Please
forgive me, my friend.

326
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,224
I will go to Diana tomorrow
morning and tell her that.

327
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:23,967
She went to Bombay along
with her daddy.

328
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:36,703
"Today I decided to.."

329
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:44,513
"Today I decided to forget
your memories..

330
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:50,925
..and regret falling
in love with you."

331
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,790
"Today I decided to.."

332
00:25:54,253 --> 00:26:00,534
"Today I decided to forget
your memories..

333
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,010
"Today I decided to.."

334
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:34,500
"My heart is broken into
so many pieces..

335
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,528
..that it will never heal again."

336
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,504
"You forgot me..

337
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,979
..as if you never knew me."

338
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:49,550
"
f hurting me was your objective.

339
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:55,782
..you should have never loved me."

340
00:26:56,048 --> 00:27:05,935
"Let me pick the pieces
of our broken dreams."

341
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,696
"Today I have decided to.."

342
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:34,630
"You get hurt by someone
only if you love him."

343
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,896
"
f there is no love,
there are no fights."

344
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:47,535
"You are my ray of hope
and I am your beloved."

345
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:53,706
"What more can I pray for?"

346
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,910
"Let's forget our mistakes."

347
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:03,482
"Let's forget our mistakes
and realize our dreams."

348
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,661
"Today I have decided to.."

349
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,792
Diana.

350
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:17,906
Diana. - Yes, daddy. - What
are you thinking about?

351
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,471
Are you thinking about the
person who doesn't even..

352
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,602
..care for you?

353
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,655
I have done it.

354
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:15,987
I have done it.

355
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,552
Grand successful.

356
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,546
Dear Diana, today I have achieved
what I have been..

357
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,951
...toiling for all these days
and which have kept us apart.

358
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,951
My experiments have succeeded.

359
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,955
I am testing this drug
on myself first.

360
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,158
God forbid if something
happens to me..

361
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,296
I am dedicating this drug and
this formula to my love.

362
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:56,824
Yours, Wilson.

363
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,925
I have done it.

364
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,925
I have done it.

365
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,734
Colonel, you think I
am mad, don't you?

366
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,735
David, you used to think
that my experiments.

367
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,537
..are of no use, right?
You used to say that.

368
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,739
...I should not cross the
lines drawn by God.

369
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:01,746
Now call your God and
show this to him.

370
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,881
All of you see this.

371
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:09,216
Dr. Wilson changed the face of life.

372
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,621
See this. See this.
All of you see me.

373
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:21,237
Now tell me who's mad.
It's me or you?

374
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,905
It's you. All of you. All of you.

375
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,922
Handsome.

376
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,930
The prince of good looks.

377
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,933
So prince, what shall be your name?

378
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,945
Blackstone. Mr. Blackstone.

379
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:22,288
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

380
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,324
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

381
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:29,388
“My beauty has willed..“

382
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:36,097
"My beauty has willed
this night to you."

383
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,300
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

384
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,603
"Take your drink."

385
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:05,496
"My hair has got a fortune
of fragrance."

386
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:12,165
"You are here to solve this enigma."

387
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:16,205
"These merciless desires!"

388
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,215
"These merciless desires.."

389
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:26,516
"Don't confine these merciless
desires to your heart."

390
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:33,685
"My beauty has willed
this night to you."

391
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,958
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

392
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,090
"Take your drink."

393
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:05,859
"You might not believe it,
but I believe it."

394
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:13,527
"The entire world says that
I came from heaven..

395
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:23,603
..except the person
whom I die for."

396
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:30,209
"Except the person
whom I die for."

397
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:37,221
"My beauty has willed
this night to you."

398
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:41,019
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

399
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,225
"Take your drink. Take it."

400
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:04,051
"These beautiful moments
will never return."

401
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:13,590
"These beautiful moments
will never return."

402
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:20,703
"These moments hotter
than a female body."

403
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,864
"This night is.."

404
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:34,611
"This night is God's gift to you."

405
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:41,946
"My beauty has willed
this night to you."

406
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,550
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

407
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:48,893
"Take your drink."

408
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:56,029
"My beauty has willed
this night to you."

409
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,504
"Take your drink. Hold your drink."

410
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,836
"Take your drink. Take it."

411
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,726
Daisy darling, my sweetheart!
Tell me what you want.

412
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,121
What will you drink today?

413
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,795
What I drink everyday. Wine.

414
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,730
Captain. Hurry up.

415
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,532
Cheers, darling!
- Cheers!

416
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:37,135
Waiter. You. Come here.
- Yes, sir.

417
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,950
Daisy, you look so beautiful today.
- Thank you.

418
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,749
Come with me, baby.
- Cheers! - Cheers!

419
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,290
Yes, sir.
- One wine.

420
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,288
What are you staring at!
- Yes, sir.

421
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,225
O man!

422
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,777
You know that Daisy girl, don't
you? - Yes, sir. - Call her here.

423
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,981
Tell her that I will buy her wine.
- Yes. Yes.

424
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,249
What 'yes!' Out! Quick!
- Yes, sir.

425
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,516
First class. Lovely.
- Miss. Daisy, that sir wants to..

426
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,256
..drink with you.

427
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,261
Tell him that I am
engaged right now.

428
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:36,127
Madam, if you want to stay alive,
go there immediately.

429
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:41,874
He's not an ordinary person.
- Is that so! Sound interesting.

430
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:46,943
I will disconnect this line
for the time being. - Ok.

431
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,952
And I will see what that man
is made of. - Ok, baby.

432
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,279
So wonderful.

433
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:54,951
Oh! Shut up.

434
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,218
Hello!

435
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,090
My girl.

436
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,695
Beautiful.

437
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,729
Gorgeous.

438
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,568
What a great song! We
should celebrate.

439
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,104
Take this.

440
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:24,715
A girl like you is in such a
place and with such a person?

441
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,986
Shame.

442
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:34,255
In the name of the most beautiful
girl in Goa. Cheers!

443
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,134
Ok, then, I shall go now, man.

444
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,733
Where are you going?
- To my house.

445
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,233
Do you call that stable a house?

446
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,804
What rubbish are you talking man!
- I'm not talking rubbish.

447
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:55,809
A beautiful girl like you
shouldn't be living there.

448
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,280
I should be living
in a palace, right?

449
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,889
Correct.

450
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:12,501
You should be living in a place
which would do justice..

451
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,696
..to your beautiful body.

452
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,938
Your shiny hair.

453
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,246
Your juicy lips.

454
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,519
You should be wearing sparkling
diamond rings..

455
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,989
..on these beautiful fingers.

456
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,252
And in this hand you should
be holding champagne.

457
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:45,931
But how will I get these things
from? - With money.

458
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:50,539
Money. Money.
- And where will I get money from?

459
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,537
You will get it with the
help of your beauty.

460
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,769
..with those intoxicating eyes.

461
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:55,936
Don't be surprised.

462
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:02,483
I might not appear as
a good person to you..

463
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:07,683
..but I have a lot of money.
- Is that so!

464
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,621
You don't believe me, do you?

465
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,894
You might not have liked my face.

466
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:21,230
You are right, man.
- I am right? Right.

467
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,199
You like those people who
want to touch your body..

468
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,570
...but are scared of the world.
They are 'good fellows.'

469
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:36,643
Idiot. Fool. Rogue.
- What do you want to say, man!

470
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:37,911
Hey, you!

471
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,556
You want to elope with my girl?

472
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,724
I will slap you so hard that you
will jump out of the window.

473
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,135
Leave me, man. What are you
doing! You're hurting me.

474
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,263
Call the manager.
- Ok.

475
00:44:56,561 --> 00:45:00,941
Manager! Is anyone there! Help!
- Leave the girl.

476
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,204
What did you say!

477
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,252
What the hell is going on!

478
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,777
Today is the most precious
day of my life.

479
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,586
My dreams of many years
have come true.

480
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:56,553
My experiments have succeeded.

481
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:02,464
Today I could fulfill
the promises that.

482
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,659
...I made to myself.

483
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:13,467
I don't have words to explain
the pain that I went through..

484
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:19,470
..after I took that drug.
I felt like someone set..

485
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:24,748
..my each and every vein on fire.

486
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,681
As if someone was crushing
my bones with a hammer.

487
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,554
I could've even died.

488
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,222
But it was worth it.

489
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:41,498
The success of this experiment.

490
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,903
..was far more valuable than death.

491
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,502
Now with the help of this drug..

492
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:53,174
...I will kill the evil in each
and every person on earth.

493
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:56,051
I can destroy the evil forever.

494
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:04,923
Peter, a friend of mine
has come to Panaji.

495
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,189
His name is Mr. Blackstone.

496
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,489
Whenever he comes here, give
him a good reception.

497
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:13,658
He must not face any
sort of trouble.

498
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:18,867
Doctor.

499
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:23,675
Doctor, there's no use in it.

500
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:29,683
Even if you walk on your palms
you won't escape me.

501
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,218
I was not trying to escape, Carlos.
I was just testing you.

502
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,214
Your focus was on watering
the plants, right?

503
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,482
And you thought that since
I am a blind man..

504
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,528
..you could escape me easily, right?

505
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,964
Doctor, this blind man can see far
better than people with eyes.

506
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:48,230
Now come. Come upstairs. Come
and have a tea. - Ok.

507
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:55,234
But Carlos, I can't stay here
for more than ten minutes.

508
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,636
Alright. Fine.

509
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,174
Not there. Not there. Sit here.
Sit on this chair.

510
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,510
Sit on the chair.

511
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,457
Carlos, sometimes I doubt if
you are just pretending..

512
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,983
..to be blind. You can see
everything, can't you?

513
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,990
When did I say that I am blind?

514
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,462
The only difference is that
others see with their eyes..

515
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,696
..and I see with my ears.

516
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,163
Doctor, did I ever tell you
an anecdote of my childhood?

517
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:30,070
That fishing tale? - No, not that
one. This is another one.

518
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,015
When we were kids we used to
stay there at Deewar island.

519
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,883
There's a church on the hills.

520
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,212
Do you know what the name
of that church is?

521
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,883
T. A. Baag church.
- Yes.

522
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,487
I took get on the uppermost
part of the church..

523
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,222
..a
ong with my gun.
- With your gun?

524
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:52,891
My toy gun. - And there I used
to wait for pigeons' sound.

525
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,500
And as soon as I used
to hear their sound..

526
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:56,630
...I used to shoot them.

527
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:01,500
I never felt blind. I fulfilled
the limitation of my eyes..

528
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,567
..with my ears.

529
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,241
You can say I am surviving
with the help of my ears.

530
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,652
I can identify everyone's footsteps.

531
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,519
Whenever someone crosses this 
ane..

532
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,851
...I identify them very easily.

533
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,991
Now see, my sister
is coming this way.

534
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,922
Wow, Carlos! You are really great.

535
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,122
What a surprise! Did you forget
the way to our house?

536
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,257
I am not to be blamed. I don't
have time at my disposal.

537
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,534
Now look at yourself. You
are just 12 inches tall..

538
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,868
..but you work 24 hours a day.
- I work for my dear brother.

539
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:31,968
But there is one problem though.

540
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:36,534
He praises me too much.
- One day you will miss..

541
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,548
..this brother. The day you
will have a family and kids..

542
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,552
..and when your in-laws
will trouble you..

543
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,680
..you will miss your brother.
- As if you won't miss me.

544
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,149
Me? I can't even think about
the day you would leave me.

545
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,893
I can't even live without you.

546
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,564
Today I can't see. After you
leave I might not be able..

547
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:02,229
..to hear as well. Your brother
will become a lifeless stone.

548
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:04,700
Stop that nonsense.

549
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,772
Hello! Sinha speaking.

550
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:14,715
Hi, Wilson! Where are you, bro?

551
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:20,252
What! You need an appointment
to meet friends?

552
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,915
You can come here whenever
you want, but do come here.

553
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,186
Bye-bye.

554
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:33,958
What nonsense! Friend, have
you gone mad or what!

555
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,537
You met me after months
and that too with these..

556
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,132
..waste papers? - These are
not ordinary papers, Sinha.

557
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,270
That's my will.
- And as per this will..

558
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,546
...if something happens to you
then your entire wealth..

559
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:50,746
...should be given to your
friend Mr. Blackstone?

560
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,011
That's what you want?

561
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,884
Do you know what that means?

562
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,156
Read further. There's something
else written in it.

563
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:04,499
And if Dr. Wilson disappears
and if he doesn't return..

564
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:08,503
..for three months then his
friend Mr. Blackstone.

565
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:12,497
..must be given the place
that Dr. Wilson has..

566
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:17,104
..assuming him to be Dr. Wilson.
Are you crazy, Wilson!

567
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,239
Don't get excited, Sinha.

568
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,712
Get my will prepare immediately.
It's urgent.

569
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,520
Because of your such sort
of eccentricities.

570
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:28,250
...I feel like writing a book
on you. - Not a bad idea.

571
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:32,050
But get this will prepared
before that.

572
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:36,664
Wilson, I am not just your lawyer,
but also your friend.

573
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,125
At least tell me who
this Blackstone is.

574
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,598
Excuse me, sir!

575
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,103
Whom do you want to meet?

576
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,910
My name is Mr. Blackstone.
I am your master's friend.

577
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,245
You are Peter?

578
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,118
Glad to meet you.

579
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,722
What's there to eat?
What's there to eat?

580
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,219
Peter, come here.

581
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,952
Thanks for the good food.

582
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,885
I will come again. I will be back.

583
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,899
May God save this house!

584
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:25,999
Come in.

585
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,108
You lousy!

586
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,110
Where is he?

587
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,552
Where is he?
- Who?

588
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,719
My beautiful bird Daisy.

589
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,253
She's not here anymore.
- Since when?

590
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,261
Ever since that day, sir.

591
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,564
She got scared.

592
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,528
You are not lying, are you?
- No, sir.

593
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,571
“L am a fairy..“

594
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:38,513
“I am a fairy with full of life.“

595
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,175
"You won't get me so easily."

596
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,912
"Sometimes I'm here, sometimes
I'm there..

597
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,978
..you can't keep pace with me."

598
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,524
“I am a fairy with full of life.“

599
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,117
"You won't get me so easily."

600
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,788
"Sometimes I'm here, sometimes
I'm there..

601
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,594
..you can't keep pace with me."

602
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:40,141
“I mesmerize everyone.
I entertain everyone.“

603
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:45,579
“I mesmerize everyone.
I entertain everyone.“

604
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:51,052
“I walk with a dazzling
spirit of night.“

605
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:55,989
“I walk with a dazzling
spirit of night.“

606
00:56:56,046 --> 00:57:00,517
"Stay at your place.
Never ever ask.."

607
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:06,991
"Stay at your place. Never
ever ask me to stop."

608
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,503
“I am a fairy with full of life.“

609
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,096
"You won't get me so easily."

610
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,733
"Sometimes I'm here, sometimes
I'm there..

611
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,802
..you can't keep pace with me."

612
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,803
“I am the queen of colours.“

613
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,611
“I am an attractive, young lady.“

614
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,482
“I am the queen of colours.“

615
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,612
“I am an attractive, young lady.“

616
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:39,093
“I am a story that keeps on moving.“

617
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:44,155
“I am a story that keeps on moving.“

618
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:48,897
"This electric current
doesn't stop anywhere."

619
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,500
"This electric current
doesn't stop anywhere."

620
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,100
"Lakhs of admirers
are following me."

621
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,645
“I am a fairy with full of life.“

622
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,181
"You won't get me so easily."

623
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,717
"Sometimes I'm here, sometimes
I'm there..

624
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:05,777
..you can't keep pace with me."

625
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,875
Come, my darling. Let's go.

626
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:33,812
Such things are not
permissible here.

627
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,940
Leave the girl.

628
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:40,488
Why did you leave the
job at that club?

629
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:44,492
Did you think you would
get rid of me..

630
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,619
..if you quit job at that club?

631
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:53,700
But my darling, I am a
pretty dangerous thing.

632
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:57,500
The woman I set my eyes on
can never escape from me..

633
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,838
...till the last moment of her life.

634
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,838
Tell me why you quitted that club.

635
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,640
I didn't quit that club on my own.

636
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,508
That day you created
a scene over there..

637
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,645
..and the club's manager fired
me the very next day. Yes.

638
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,779
You are lying.

639
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:17,115
I swear I am not lying.
I swear on myself.

640
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,531
Always keep one thing
in mind, sweetheart.

641
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:32,735
If I ever catch you lying
do you know what I will do?

642
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,137
Come closer.

643
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,881
'Oh God! You are so ugly!'

644
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:45,945
Say it aloud.

645
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:47,880
Say it aloud!

646
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,683
But I didn't even utter a word.

647
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:56,554
I can hear what you think about me.

648
01:00:57,554 --> 01:01:01,900
You are scolding me inside.
You hate me.

649
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,537
You hate my face.

650
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:09,172
Then when will you love me?
- Love? - Yes.

651
01:01:10,634 --> 01:01:14,172
Love. There are only two
things in this world.

652
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:19,186
Hatred and love. You
love me, don't you?

653
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,518
Don't you love me?
- Yes, I do.

654
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,521
I do.
- Then love me.

655
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,121
Love me.

656
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,200
My sweetheart. My darling.

657
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:46,213
I am dying for you.

658
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:51,141
You will die crying if you hear it.

659
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:57,080
I am leaving this place
for a few days.

660
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,958
You didn't say anything.
Aren't you upset?

661
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:07,530
Yes. Yes, I'm upset about it.
- You are lying.

662
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,103
You are happy. You are happy.

663
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:14,498
Look, my dear, happiness doesn't
stay in this world..

664
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,511
..for too long.

665
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:22,907
And I don't know anything
about your happiness.

666
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,848
Did you get me?

667
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,967
Are you leaving today itself?

668
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,203
Today? Why?

669
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,803
You want me to leave today itself?
- No.

670
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:53,875
I asked you just like that.
- Why did you ask me?

671
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:59,210
Why did you ask me?
- I would feel bad.

672
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:01,817
You would feel bad?

673
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:07,887
Ok, then, I won't leave
if you would feel bad.

674
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:13,023
I will stay here tonight
in your arms.

675
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,897
You like it, don't you? This
is what you want, right?

676
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,734
This is what you want, right?

677
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:25,644
Yes. I like it.
- I can never break your heart.

678
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,116
Ok, I won't leave.

679
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,043
Are you happy now?

680
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,181
Are you happy now!
- Yes, I'm very happy.

681
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:38,584
Then sing. Dance.

682
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,525
Sing.

683
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:47,663
“L am a fairy..“
- “I am a fairy..“

684
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:27,131
I think that idiot Blackstone
will kill you some day.

685
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,508
I will be happy if he
kills me at once.

686
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:33,571
I would rather die at once
than dying every day.

687
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,651
Listen to me. Run away from
this place for daytime.

688
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,520
Where will I go? No matter
wherever I go..

689
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,924
..that idiot will hunt me down.

690
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,518
Why don't you file a report
in police station?

691
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:52,857
If I file a report in police
station that idiot will..

692
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,959
Who's there, man? Come in.

693
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,763
What?
- Miss. Daisy. - Yes, it's me.

694
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,137
Dr. Wilson sent this envelope
for you. - Dr. Wilson?

695
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,479
The same Dr. Wilson who works
in municipal hospital?

696
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:10,876
Yes, ma'am.

697
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:17,621
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Good day, ma'am.

698
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,492
Good day, Miss. Daisy.
- Good day.

699
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,898
500 rupees? But why did
he send me 500 rupees?

700
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,837
I don't even know him.
- You are a very lucky girl.

701
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:38,641
He's a very nice man. He
helps poor people a lot.

702
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,841
He must have come to know about you.

703
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:45,509
I think he is interested in you.

704
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:51,187
Listen to me. Go to him and
thank him and befriend him.

705
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:57,523
I think only he can get you
rid that evil Blackstone.

706
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:58,657
He will mend his ways.

707
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:00,657
Excuse me, sir!

708
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,104
Sir, Miss. Daisy came to meet you.

709
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:17,147
Doctor, it's you? You
are Dr. Wilson? Oh God!

710
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,481
I wouldn't have thought
it even in my dreams..

711
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,615
..that I would get such
a reputed doctor.

712
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:27,160
You sent me so much money?

713
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,496
When I saw you for the first time
I understood it right then..

714
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:35,127
..that you are a nice fellow.

715
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,703
But why did you send
me so much money?

716
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:45,771
Someone told me that
you needed money.

717
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,840
Who told you so, sir?

718
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:56,524
That's not important. What
is important is that..

719
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:01,790
..you got the money.
- But sir, I can't take this money.

720
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,529
Why?
- I need help, doctor.

721
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:09,061
See this. They are such deep wounds.

722
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,664
They are the scars
of physical abuse.

723
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,141
You will get such scars
on my entire body.

724
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,015
You sit here. I will apply the
medicine. It will be fine.

725
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:26,611
No, doctor. Medicine is of no use.
I can't bear it anymore.

726
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:31,823
But what's the matter?
- Blackstone did all this, doctor.

727
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,019
Blackstone did this to me.

728
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,826
He's an animal. He's a devil.

729
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,962
I can't escape from him.

730
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:43,494
No matter wherever I'll go he'll
reach there and he'll kill me.

731
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,502
Please save me from
that devil, doctor..

732
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,907
..or else give me some poison.

733
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:50,501
Give me some poison, doctor.

734
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:54,647
Why didn't you file a complaint
in police station? - No, doctor.

735
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,113
I can't do that. You don't know him.

736
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:00,981
I can also hear what
we are thinking.

737
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:04,454
And I feel like he's somewhere
around even now..

738
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:07,654
..and listening to us.

739
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,793
And when I will go home
he will come there..

740
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:14,062
..and kill me, doctor.
He will kill me.

741
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:19,103
Save me from him, doctor.
Save me, doctor.

742
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,001
Save me.

743
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,080
You are a very nice person, sir.

744
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:32,017
Please don't send me
back from this place.

745
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:37,889
I will work for you. I will clean
your shoes. I will love you.

746
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,154
I am ready to do anything
for you, sir.

747
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:45,699
Please save me. I am not a bad
girl, sir. I'm not a bad girl.

748
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:53,736
Daisy, Blackstone won't
trouble you again. - No.

749
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,977
He will definitely come here.
He will kill me.

750
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,104
I told you he won't come here.

751
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,917
I will stop him, Daisy.
I will stop him.

752
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,456
Have faith in me. Believe me.

753
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:13,852
I believe you, sir.

754
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,057
I have complete faith in you.
- Good.

755
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:25,670
<i>Go. Now go home.
- OK, sh. OK.</i>

756
01:09:56,626 --> 01:10:01,626
“I want to tell you that I don't
want to live without you.“

757
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:14,706
“I want to tell you, but
you never came to me.“

758
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:45,218
“I want to tell you that I don't
want to live without you.“

759
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:55,626
“I want to tell you, but
you never came to me.“

760
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,825
“I want to tell you..“

761
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:09,636
“I want to tell you that I don't
want to live without you.“

762
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:19,644
“I want to tell you, but
you never came to me.“

763
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,914
“I want to tell you..“

764
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:53,951
"You might not remember
the days gone by."

765
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:59,557
“But the moments we
spent together..

766
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:04,087
...are the best moments of my life.“

767
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,532
"With the hope.."

768
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:14,498
"With the hope that some day..

769
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:18,774
..you will definitely
come back to me."

770
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:28,853
“I have adorned the flowers
at the doors of my house.“

771
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:32,587
“I want to tell you..“

772
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:13,158
“I don't want my faith
in you to shatter.“

773
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:23,777
“I hope you will come back to me.“

774
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:27,110
“Is this the test of my love..“

775
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:38,516
“Is this the test of my love
or you are just hurting me?“

776
01:13:38,715 --> 01:13:48,534
"Answer just one question of mine."

777
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,971
“I want to tell you..“

778
01:13:53,563 --> 01:14:02,745
“I want to tell you that I don't
want to live without you.“

779
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:12,888
“I want to tell you, but
you never came to me.“

780
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:16,619
“I want to tell you..“

781
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,927
“I want to tell you..“

782
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:28,501
Listen, I will tell you an
anecdote from my childhood.

783
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,505
The pigeon hunting story?
- I told you not to interrupt me.

784
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,706
Don't disturb me. - Ok, tell me.
- Now hear what happened.

785
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,976
Dr. Wilson. Dr. Wilson!

786
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,583
Carlos.

787
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:49,996
Dr. Wilson, didn't I tell you
that you can't escape me?

788
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:58,728
You have a bad cough.
Come with me. Come in.

789
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:01,071
No, Carlos. I am going to
meet Diana. I'm a bit late.

790
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:04,737
You are going to meet Diana. You
will talk about love and all.

791
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,474
Just imagine how it would look
if you cough in the middle.

792
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:08,482
Come in. Come in.
- It's ok. - No, come in.

793
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,477
There must be someone to look
after you as well, right!

794
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:15,479
Sit in the hall. I will
prepare such a remedy..

795
01:15:15,545 --> 01:15:18,025
..that you will never forget.

796
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,151
I will tell you everything.
I will explain everything.

797
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:22,025
Carlos, your house is pretty good.

798
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:25,555
No one listens to me. People
keep on coughing.

799
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,492
My mother taught me how
to prepare this drug.

800
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,596
Just drink it once. You
will never forget me.

801
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:40,508
Till now I remember, when
Marta was a kid..

802
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:44,574
..she had a bad cold cough.
You treated her then.

803
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,517
You're the one who saved
her life, doctor.

804
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:50,114
Would you mind if treat
your cough now?

805
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:51,916
Would you mind, doctor?

806
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:54,652
Marta.

807
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:57,862
Come downstairs. Dr. Wilson is here.

808
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,045
Where's doctor?

809
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,842
In the hall.
- I see.

810
01:18:03,446 --> 01:18:04,516
Doctor.

811
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,852
Brother.

812
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,857
Marta. Marta, what happened?

813
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:17,565
I saw a devil.
- Devil?

814
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:24,475
He looks as dangerous as
a devil. He attacked me.

815
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,074
Come on, Marta. Come on.

816
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:29,139
If any such thing was there doctor
would've seen it first.

817
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,884
But doctor's not there.
- He's not there?

818
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:40,491
Dr. Wilson.

819
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,492
Doctor.

820
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,498
Dr. Wilson.

821
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,795
Dr. Wilson.

822
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,507
Dr. Wilson.

823
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,906
Dr. Wilson!

824
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:03,446
It's surprising. He sat on this
chair and I went to prepare..

825
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:07,511
..the ginger-tea.

826
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:11,523
He was coughing..
- He was coughing? - Yes.

827
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,121
Even I too heard the
sound of coughing.

828
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,456
But doctor wasn't there.
A devil was there.

829
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:21,457
Then where did Dr. Wilson disappear!

830
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,607
My cycle!
- Leave me.

831
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:38,618
O my God!
- I won't leave you.

832
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:42,486
Mummy. Mummy.
- Fool, why did you beat my girl?

833
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:44,081
Get out of my way.
- Hey!

834
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,958
You slapped a girl.
You broke her cycle.

835
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:49,826
And now you are threatening them?
- Who are you?

836
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,832
Whoever I am I will hand
you over to the police.

837
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:56,102
Cycle. - If I broke the
cycle take money from me.

838
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,502
What's the need to go to police!

839
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:58,732
Pay the money. Pay the money.

840
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:00,903
I don't have any money right now.

841
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,573
You come with me. I will
give you the money.

842
01:20:07,703 --> 01:20:10,183
Both of you stay here.
I will bring the money.

843
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,188
It's Dr. Wilson's house.

844
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,588
Come here. Take your money.
- Thank you.

845
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,935
Today's incident scared me a lot.

846
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,540
Today I became Blackstone.

847
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:39,944
..without taking that drug.

848
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,546
Till now I used to think that
I would become Blackstone.

849
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:47,747
“Only after taking that drug.

850
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,559
And if I don't take that
drug I will be fine.

851
01:20:55,618 --> 01:21:00,567
But today, on watching
two cocks fight.

852
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:10,509
I became Blackstone even
without taking any drug..

853
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:14,844
..without any chemical.

854
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:23,521
That means whenever I will
see some sin or crime..

855
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:28,653
...I will turn into
Blackstone against my wish.

856
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,588
Blackstone.

857
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,614
Sir, he had Dr. Wilson's
house's keys.

858
01:21:50,873 --> 01:21:52,546
He opened the door and
and went inside.

859
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,212
..and after a while he came
out and gave me a chit.

860
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:58,552
What's most surprising is that
I found your friend Wi
son's..

861
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:01,754
..signature on that chit.
- Wilson's signature? - Yes.

862
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:05,492
Sir, is it possible
that this person is..

863
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:08,034
..b
ackmai
ing Dr. Wilson?

864
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:12,729
Who is this person?
- I don't know..

865
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:16,038
..but going by his face
he looks like a demon.

866
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,574
One can't keep looking at
his face for too long.

867
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:22,912
It repels you.
- What's his name? - His name!

868
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:24,508
From Dr. Wilson's servant,
I came to know..

869
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:26,917
..that his name is Blackstone.

870
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:30,521
What!
- Blackstone.

871
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:35,059
You stay here for a while.

872
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,531
Dr. Wi
son..

873
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:53,205
...all his wealth be passed on
to his friend, Mr. Blackstone.

874
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,547
Blackstone.
- What happened, sir?

875
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:03,146
Nothing. I thought that

876
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:12,662
Hello, Sinha!
- Hi!

877
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,995
How come you got time to
come to my factory today?

878
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:18,864
Buddy, I came to ask you
something about Wilson.

879
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:21,597
Doesn't he appear a bit different
to you these days!

880
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:23,334
I don't know.

881
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,003
I didn't meet him after
that day's argument.

882
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,641
What argument are you talking about!

883
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:35,713
The day he slapped you in anger.

884
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:40,885
But friendship is an iron-wall.

885
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:43,354
It can't break with a slap.

886
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:48,695
Tell me something, David.
Who is Blackstone?

887
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,361
Blackstone?

888
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:53,304
I am hearing that name
for the first time.

889
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:07,877
What have you done!

890
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:17,595
I did what a devil
is supposed to do.

891
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:24,861
I will destroy everything in this
world that's good and beautiful.

892
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:28,407
Don't talk rubbish. I
won't let you do that.

893
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:32,007
I will destroy you before you
could destroy anything good.

894
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:35,005
No one can destroy me now.

895
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:36,776
Not even you.

896
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:39,710
You unleashed me from the shackles..

897
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,912
..that I tied me down since ages.

898
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,916
I am free now. I'm free!

899
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:30,869
Peter, the key of the backdoor
of my lab is in my coat-pocket.

900
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,330
Bring it here.

901
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:39,337
Sir.

902
01:25:55,017 --> 01:25:56,291
What have you done, sir!

903
01:25:57,853 --> 01:26:00,299
We don't need that key any longer.

904
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,829
Are you alright, sir?

905
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:13,304
Look, Peter, if that Black
Stone ever comes here..

906
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:17,248
..don't let him enter the house.

907
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,310
Throw him out of this place.

908
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:23,548
I was also thinking of
doing the same, sir.

909
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:29,654
Goodnight, sir.

910
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:35,326
'My invention is proving
to be curse for me.'

911
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:39,671
'Now Blackstone is dominating me.'

912
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:44,876
'I need to stay away from
Blackstone and my invention.'

913
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:48,940
'There's only one way
for that. Diana.'

914
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:51,478
I lost my path, Diana.

915
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:57,684
I reached a stage where
there is no return.

916
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,553
Please bring me back, Diana.

917
01:27:01,283 --> 01:27:02,887
Or else I will be lost forever
in this darkness.

918
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:04,689
I will suffocate.

919
01:27:06,622 --> 01:27:10,695
Wilson, Diana will
give you her 
ife..

920
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:13,569
..but she won't let anything
happen to you.

921
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:15,639
Just ask me once.

922
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:22,445
I am sick, Diana. Very sick.

923
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:30,280
Not physically, but my soul is sick.

924
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:35,717
It's such a sickness which
only I can understand.

925
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,662
I can't explain it to anyone.

926
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,259
Each and every moment of my life
is passing in such a way..

927
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,601
..as it is approaching death.

928
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:51,401
I am unable to bear this pain.

929
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:56,278
My soul is injured.

930
01:27:57,339 --> 01:28:00,013
I feel like its bleeding.

931
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:03,288
Diana, save me.

932
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,681
Please save me, Diana.
- Wilson.

933
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:08,419
Diana.

934
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:11,956
Daddy's here.

935
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:16,425
How come you are here today?
- I came to meet you.

936
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,499
Regarding what?
- To apologize for my mistakes.

937
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:22,240
I don't have any respect for a man..

938
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,368
..who breaks his promises
every time..

939
01:28:24,433 --> 01:28:25,912
..and apologizes every time.

940
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:27,914
I know you are very upset with me.

941
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:32,643
I have let you down big time.

942
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:36,256
I never fulfilled my commitments.

943
01:28:37,946 --> 01:28:42,258
But I was busy with my experiments.

944
01:28:44,253 --> 01:28:49,327
I was so immersed in them
that I forgot the world.

945
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:53,664
Colonel, I need your help.

946
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:59,336
I need it badly. Please forgive me.

947
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:07,617
Today I am asking you for
Diana's hand one more time.

948
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,919
Please don't say 'n0' today,
daddy. Please say 'yes.'

949
01:29:12,648 --> 01:29:16,221
Wilson needs me right
now. Please, daddy.

950
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:18,754
Please say 'yes' for your
daughter's happiness.

951
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,358
Please say 'yes', daddy.
Please say 'yes.'

952
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,562
Do not cry, dear. Do not cry.
- Please say 'yes', daddy.

953
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:29,237
Wilson, I don't have anyone
in this wor
d..

954
01:29:29,298 --> 01:29:32,643
..other than my daughter.

955
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:37,308
I faced bullets in battlefield,
I bore deadly wounds..

956
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:41,843
..but I can't see tears
on my daughter's face.

957
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:47,586
Take care of her.
Never make her cry.

958
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:52,329
Dear, there's your show on 24th
of this month, right! - Yes.

959
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:56,326
On that evening
I will throw a grand party..

960
01:29:56,391 --> 01:30:00,806
..and after that
I will get you both married.

961
01:30:01,596 --> 01:30:03,007
Now cheer up.

962
01:30:07,469 --> 01:30:09,949
Peter. Peter.

963
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:12,543
Peter.

964
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,413
O Peter.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:17,820
Peter. Today I'm very happy.
I'm very happy.

966
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,349
Sir, if you are happy
I am also happy.

967
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,953
First of all ask me why.
- Peter, I'm getting married.

968
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:25,459
I am marrying Diana.

969
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:29,299
Yes, Peter. Just imagine.
Picture this.

970
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,234
Diana will be my wife. She
will be my wife, Peter.

971
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:34,433
She will be my wife. Picture
this. Picture this.

972
01:30:34,563 --> 01:30:38,238
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Congratulations, sir.

973
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,247
Thank you. Thank you. You
must celebrate, sir.

974
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,714
Of course. Of course.
Go, get some wine.

975
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:23,221
"Come, let's do something
on this wonderful night."

976
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:31,663
"Come, let's do something
on this wonderful night."

977
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:38,569
"Come, let's do something
on this wonderful night."

978
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:48,372
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

979
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:56,752
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

980
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:20,409
"Let me take you into my arms."

981
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:29,354
"You kiss the fragrance of my hair."

982
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:37,229
"Let me hear the melody
of your heartbeat."

983
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:45,602
"And you adorn my beauty
with you company."

984
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:55,375
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

985
01:32:55,504 --> 01:33:03,855
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

986
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:35,713
“Under the fountain
of colour and light..

987
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:44,355
...let our wishes celebrate.“

988
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:53,433
"You always keep my
hand at your heart."

989
01:33:53,495 --> 01:34:00,777
"l shall always be by your side."

990
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:10,346
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

991
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:18,863
"Come, today there's joy
and bliss with us."

992
01:34:40,775 --> 01:34:43,278
Today after a longtime you
are laughing in this way.

993
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:46,950
Just because of you I am very happy.

994
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:48,887
Today evening, there will be a party.

995
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:50,762
After the party we will get married.

996
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:55,027
And then I will become
yours forever.

997
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:59,437
And yes, today evening..
- Yes, I remember it.

998
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:00,973
This evening there's
your ballet program.

999
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,770
And I will reach there on time.

1000
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:20,257
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1001
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,252
The ballet that we are about
to present today..

1002
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:25,320
...is named 'VVolf Boy.'

1003
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:30,267
This is the story of a boy
whose mother left him..

1004
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:34,467
..in a jungle due to the
fear of law and society.

1005
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:38,335
That child was an
illegitimate child.

1006
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:57,423
A male wolf saw that child
and it took him home.

1007
01:35:57,785 --> 01:35:59,355
It reared that child
like one of its cubs.

1008
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,030
And he too became like them
slowly and gradually.

1009
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:03,961
He became a 'VVolf boy.'

1010
01:36:57,912 --> 01:37:00,290
After many years some villagers
saw that ‘Wolf boy..

1011
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:03,557
...while they went for hunting.

1012
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:31,347
They injured him and caged him.

1013
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,852
People from far away places
were coming to see him.

1014
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:42,266
A human child became an object
of wonder for humans.

1015
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,006
There was starvation in that
village that particular year.

1016
01:38:06,281 --> 01:38:09,819
In the times of crisis villagers
went to the temple-priest.

1017
01:38:10,919 --> 01:38:14,230
The priest told them that the
villagers faced this crisis..

1018
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:18,362
...due to the 'VVolf boy' and
that this phase will pass..

1019
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:21,430
“Only with his sacrifice.

1020
01:39:33,568 --> 01:39:34,774
Cheers to my darling doctor.

1021
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:40,982
Cheers to the person who loves
me, who saved my life.

1022
01:39:53,855 --> 01:39:54,925
No.

1023
01:40:10,205 --> 01:40:11,275
No.

1024
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,442
You look very happy.

1025
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:19,582
Just because that foolish
doctor promised you..

1026
01:40:19,648 --> 01:40:21,889
..that I will never come again?

1027
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:28,227
You fell in love with him
and trusted his words..

1028
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:31,702
..whom I hate most?

1029
01:40:34,295 --> 01:40:37,572
You went to cry on his shoulders?

1030
01:40:37,966 --> 01:40:40,469
He wiped your tears?

1031
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:42,976
You complained about me?

1032
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:45,709
You showed him your wounds?

1033
01:40:48,243 --> 01:40:50,951
You are ready to do
everything for him?

1034
01:40:51,246 --> 01:40:52,691
You will become his maid?

1035
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:54,588
You will clean his shoes?

1036
01:40:55,316 --> 01:40:58,388
Just because he promised you
that he would remove me..

1037
01:40:58,453 --> 01:41:00,797
..from your path forever?

1038
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:07,465
Shall I tell you a secret?

1039
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:14,408
Dr. Wilson and I are not different.

1040
01:41:16,204 --> 01:41:17,615
We are one.

1041
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:22,421
I am Dr. Wilson.

1042
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:27,415
And I am Blackstone.

1043
01:41:29,717 --> 01:41:35,360
I swear on you. Only
you know this secret.

1044
01:41:35,957 --> 01:41:41,600
That's why you will
have to pay for this.

1045
01:41:54,742 --> 01:41:55,777
What's that noise!

1046
01:41:56,744 --> 01:42:00,988
Help!
- Go upstairs and see. Go.

1047
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,710
Daisy.

1048
01:42:27,441 --> 01:42:28,545
Daisy.

1049
01:42:29,344 --> 01:42:30,414
Daisy.

1050
01:42:31,846 --> 01:42:32,916
Daisy.

1051
01:42:33,715 --> 01:42:34,785
Daisy.

1052
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:36,887
Where are you?

1053
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:40,290
Daisy.

1054
01:42:54,235 --> 01:42:55,305
Help!

1055
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,320
Help!

1056
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:15,859
Marta.

1057
01:43:16,257 --> 01:43:17,327
Marta.

1058
01:43:26,934 --> 01:43:28,004
Gudgaon police station.

1059
01:43:29,604 --> 01:43:31,447
What! Someone's killed.

1060
01:43:33,474 --> 01:43:34,509
Marta.

1061
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:36,980
Marta.

1062
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,421
No. Leave me alone.

1063
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:00,470
These people don't let us
sleep even at night time.

1064
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:02,639
Get out of here.

1065
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:05,377
There's no place in
this house for you.

1066
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,284
Listen, it's your sir's order..
- Go away. - Peter.

1067
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:09,746
Open the door, Peter.

1068
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:11,946
Open the door, you idiot.

1069
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:21,797
What nonsense! How long will
we have to wait for him!

1070
01:44:22,557 --> 01:44:24,332
I invited so many big people of
this city to introduce him..

1071
01:44:24,391 --> 01:44:26,462
..and he is not there like before.

1072
01:44:27,528 --> 01:44:30,407
What does he think of himself!
What does he think!

1073
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:33,605
This is too much.

1074
01:44:34,735 --> 01:44:37,272
Diana, I want to talk.
- Please, daddy.

1075
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:40,285
Dr. David, there's a call for
you. It's very urgent, sir.

1076
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:42,779
Excuse me, sir.

1077
01:44:46,747 --> 01:44:48,488
Hello!
- David, I am Wilson speaking.

1078
01:44:48,549 --> 01:44:51,291
Where the hell are you!
- Listen to me carefully, David.

1079
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:53,623
I am in the middle of
a huge mess right now.

1080
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:57,561
I need your help.
- But, Wi
son..

1081
01:44:57,625 --> 01:45:00,697
Listen to me carefully. Go
to my house immediately.

1082
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:04,299
..and tell Peter that there
is a brown colour box..

1083
01:45:04,365 --> 01:45:05,503
..in one of the drawers
in my laboratory.

1084
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:06,974
There is the 'danger' label on it.

1085
01:45:07,502 --> 01:45:09,607
Go to your house with that box.

1086
01:45:09,904 --> 01:45:12,646
I will send one of my friends
there and you give it to him.

1087
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,253
Listen, don't tell anyone about
this, especially to my Diana.

1088
01:45:16,878 --> 01:45:19,484
It's very urgent. Go
there immediately.

1089
01:45:20,848 --> 01:45:21,918
Hello!

1090
01:45:25,887 --> 01:45:28,993
Control your anger, daddy. We
will know soon what happened.

1091
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:33,405
Excuse me, sir. I shall go now.
- What happened, David?

1092
01:45:34,262 --> 01:45:36,868
Nothing. Goodnight.
- David.

1093
01:45:38,766 --> 01:45:43,408
What's the matter? Please tell me.
- There's nothing.

1094
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:45,414
David. David, tell me.
- Some other time.

1095
01:45:58,452 --> 01:45:59,954
Yes, Peter. I think that's the box.

1096
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:04,027
Yes. Where's that box?

1097
01:46:05,993 --> 01:46:08,405
Who are you? - I told you
I am Dr. Wilson's friend.

1098
01:46:08,563 --> 01:46:09,701
Tell me now where that box is.

1099
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:19,876
Here's the box.

1100
01:46:21,676 --> 01:46:23,849
Stop. Where's Wilson?

1101
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:26,583
I can't tell you.
- Why can't you?

1102
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:30,258
I don't have enough time to
tell that. Give me this box.

1103
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:33,396
Tell me where Wilson is.
Or take me to him.

1104
01:46:33,821 --> 01:46:36,995
David, don't be stubborn.
- I want to know if Wilson is fine.

1105
01:46:39,927 --> 01:46:40,997
Stop there.

1106
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:44,936
Now tell me where Wilson is.
He must be in some trouble.

1107
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:48,879
You know everything. And I think
you are responsible for it.

1108
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:53,307
David, I am telling you for
the last time. Let me go.

1109
01:46:53,674 --> 01:46:55,415
And I am asking you
for the last time.

1110
01:46:55,476 --> 01:46:58,320
Tell me where Wilson is. Tell
me or else I will shoot you.

1111
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:04,425
Alright. If that's what you
want to know then alright.

1112
01:47:15,229 --> 01:47:21,976
See this. David, you see
this. See it's magic.

1113
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:48,866
I can't believe it.

1114
01:47:51,999 --> 01:47:54,946
Oh God!
- I need your help, David.

1115
01:47:55,603 --> 01:47:57,742
Help me! Please help me!
- Help?

1116
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:02,513
No, Wilson. Neither I nor anyone
else can help me now.

1117
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:05,284
For you I can apologize to someone..

1118
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:07,349
...I can beg the court
for forgiveness“.

1119
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:10,486
..but I can't apologize to someone..

1120
01:48:10,551 --> 01:48:13,498
..whose unbreakable rules
of nature you have broken.

1121
01:48:13,554 --> 01:48:15,898
..who is supreme.

1122
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:20,236
I told you again and again that
these experiments of yours..

1123
01:48:20,294 --> 01:48:24,902
..are wrong, but you
didn't listen to me.

1124
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:28,240
You were too stubborn, and
the result is that.

1125
01:48:28,302 --> 01:48:29,975
..today your became a victim
of your own stubbornness.

1126
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,843
Today headlines! Two girls killed.
Murderer absconding.

1127
01:48:32,907 --> 01:48:35,581
Today headlines! Two girls killed.
Murderer absconding.

1128
01:48:35,643 --> 01:48:37,953
Today headlines! Two girls killed.
Murderer absconding.

1129
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:40,987
Today headlines! Two girls killed.
Murderer absconding.

1130
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:48,264
My God!

1131
01:48:48,822 --> 01:48:50,733
There's mayhem all over the city.

1132
01:48:51,559 --> 01:48:53,402
Commissioner is bombarded
with phone calls.

1133
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:55,670
The media is pointing fingers
at the police department.

1134
01:48:55,997 --> 01:48:57,601
Who is this Blackstone?

1135
01:48:58,766 --> 01:49:01,269
I don't know, sir. I have
been working here..

1136
01:49:01,335 --> 01:49:05,875
..since so many years, but I
have never seen him before.

1137
01:49:06,273 --> 01:49:07,616
And sir says that he's his friend.

1138
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:11,418
If he's his friend then you
must have known him, right?

1139
01:49:11,845 --> 01:49:13,222
Didn't you ever ask
your boss who he is!

1140
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:18,397
What can I ask, sir! I am just..
- Alright. Alright.

1141
01:49:18,752 --> 01:49:20,698
And if Wilson returns
tell him to meet me.

1142
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:21,958
Tell him that it's an urgent matter.

1143
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,974
Carlos. I am sorry, my son.

1144
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:42,243
I am sorry for whatever
happened to Marta.

1145
01:50:42,703 --> 01:50:45,513
But you are still here..
- Where can I go, father!

1146
01:50:46,641 --> 01:50:47,676
Whom shall I go to?

1147
01:50:48,876 --> 01:50:50,355
Who do I have in this world?

1148
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,991
I had a sister. Now
she has also left me.

1149
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:58,525
Where can I go away
from her, father?

1150
01:50:59,253 --> 01:51:01,665
That was God's wish, Carlos.

1151
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:05,402
What sort of wish is that, father!
What sort of wish is that!

1152
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:09,541
Innocent people are being killed.
Is that what his wish is!

1153
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:14,611
The murderer doesn't get punished.
Is that what his wish is!

1154
01:51:15,936 --> 01:51:18,678
He gets away without a scratch!
Is that what his wish is!

1155
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,310
If that's what his wish is I don't
accept it. - No, Carlos.

1156
01:51:24,912 --> 01:51:28,485
Those are good fortunate
people who die young.

1157
01:51:29,216 --> 01:51:34,290
Because God first takes away
the person from the world..

1158
01:51:34,355 --> 01:51:39,236
..whom he loves most. Have faith,
Carlos. Be brave, my son.

1159
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:41,432
Have faith.

1160
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:50,540
You look very tired.
- Yes.

1161
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:54,775
What brought you here?

1162
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:03,326
Do you know two girls were
killed yesterday? - Yes.

1163
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:09,360
And I heard that police already
found out who the murderer is.

1164
01:52:14,261 --> 01:52:15,934
Why are you telling
me all these things?

1165
01:52:16,197 --> 01:52:21,943
Because the murder is your friend.
Mr. Blackstone.

1166
01:52:22,269 --> 01:52:24,545
What can I do then!
- Wilson, 
..

1167
01:52:25,472 --> 01:52:26,951
I already asked you about
it a number of times.

1168
01:52:27,341 --> 01:52:29,412
I am asking you again. Why did
you will your property..

1169
01:52:29,443 --> 01:52:30,922
..on his name?

1170
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,223
Tell me, Wilson. Answer me.

1171
01:52:37,784 --> 01:52:40,287
Wilson, I'm your friend.
I can help you.

1172
01:52:40,955 --> 01:52:44,562
Has he forced you to will
your property on your name?

1173
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:47,233
Did you sign those papers because..

1174
01:52:47,294 --> 01:52:49,570
..he threatened to kill
you or something?

1175
01:52:49,696 --> 01:52:52,870
Ok, go and burn that will.
- You want me to burn it?

1176
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:55,709
Yes, just burn it.
- What's all this, Wilson!

1177
01:52:57,638 --> 01:53:01,484
Wilson, still it's not
too late. Tell me.

1178
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:04,650
He's a murderer Wilson. He can
even kill you in future.

1179
01:53:04,945 --> 01:53:06,515
Wilson, for God's sake..

1180
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:16,323
Excuse me, sir. - Is Dr. Wilson
at home? - Yes, but..

1181
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:26,335
Dr. Wilson, please.
- Yes, I'm Dr. Wilson.

1182
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,005
Inspector Wagle from CID branch.

1183
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:31,943
We came in search
of Mr. Blackstone.

1184
01:53:32,673 --> 01:53:34,414
But there's no one called
Blackstone lives here.

1185
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:36,320
We came to search your house.

1186
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:41,958
I am Dr. Wilson's lawyer.
- Here's the search warrant.

1187
01:53:50,291 --> 01:53:53,568
Peter, let them search the house.
- Yes, sir.

1188
01:53:54,862 --> 01:53:58,469
Inspector, both of you go inside.
You come with me.

1189
01:54:01,902 --> 01:54:03,006
Blackstone is a murder.

1190
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:06,779
Hiding a murderer or helping
a murderer is a crime.

1191
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:07,875
Stop it, Sinha. Stop it.

1192
01:54:08,576 --> 01:54:11,352
It seems you know everything,
but you don't want to tell me.

1193
01:54:12,546 --> 01:54:14,583
What have I done? What happened?

1194
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,988
Nothing, Diana. Nothing. You
haven't done anything wrong.

1195
01:54:18,952 --> 01:54:22,331
I am just worried about Wilson.
- For Wilson?

1196
01:54:22,823 --> 01:54:25,929
What happened to Wilson?
Tell me, David. Tell me.

1197
01:54:26,961 --> 01:54:28,463
I am unable to understand it, Diana.

1198
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:29,599
How would I make you
understand anything!

1199
01:54:29,663 --> 01:54:31,768
But still say something,
David. Say something.

1200
01:54:34,001 --> 01:54:41,419
Diana, Wi
son.. Wilson
is sick. Very sick.

1201
01:54:42,609 --> 01:54:46,284
We need to take care of him or
else he might be in trouble.

1202
01:54:47,281 --> 01:54:48,351
What sickness are you talking about?

1203
01:54:49,016 --> 01:54:51,292
I am ready to take him to the
biggest doctors in the world.

1204
01:54:51,352 --> 01:54:55,027
No, Diana. It's not something
that doctors can treat.

1205
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:57,824
If that was the case, then
Wilson himself is a doctor.

1206
01:54:59,526 --> 01:55:00,596
We need to treat him.

1207
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:04,040
Diana. Diana, he needs us right now.

1208
01:55:04,698 --> 01:55:06,974
We can treat him. We
can make him well.

1209
01:55:08,535 --> 01:55:10,981
Will you help me in this?

1210
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,245
You are asking me for help. I
am even ready to sacrifice..

1211
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:17,483
..my life for Wilson.

1212
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:23,592
I.. I love him. I love
him. I love him.

1213
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,258
'I think for some reason VVilson..

1214
01:55:30,323 --> 01:55:34,396
...is under Blackstone's control.'

1215
01:55:35,996 --> 01:55:40,274
'But why is he trying to
hide him even after..

1216
01:55:40,334 --> 01:55:44,339
...knowing that Blackstone
is a dangerous murderer.'

1217
01:55:45,539 --> 01:55:46,813
'What's this mystery!'

1218
01:55:47,975 --> 01:55:54,756
If I had eyes I would've never
sent you to Daisy's home.

1219
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,826
And you wouldn't have had to die.

1220
01:56:00,921 --> 01:56:02,298
Forgive me, sister.

1221
01:56:03,757 --> 01:56:06,294
Forgive me. I couldn't save you.

1222
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:11,836
I couldn't save you.
I couldn't save you.

1223
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:13,970
Forgive me, sister.

1224
01:56:23,377 --> 01:56:25,357
But Carlos makes you
a promise, sister..

1225
01:56:28,849 --> 01:56:31,989
I won't let your murder
get away so easily.

1226
01:56:35,322 --> 01:56:36,801
Boy.
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:40,329
Give me one more.

1228
01:56:41,929 --> 01:56:44,466
Doctor, you already have
one too many drinks.

1229
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:47,410
Come on. Give me one more.
- Right, sir.

1230
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:52,348
I have been living in this
city for so many years..

1231
01:56:52,406 --> 01:56:56,513
..but I have seen or heard
of such a brutal murder.

1232
01:56:56,677 --> 01:57:00,625
But what's surprising is that
police hasn't caught him yet.

1233
01:57:00,881 --> 01:57:02,690
That's the reason people
are a bit scared.

1234
01:57:03,283 --> 01:57:06,287
He's the same idiot
who broke the furniture..

1235
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:09,425
..the Panaji Club.
- He's the same person..

1236
01:57:09,489 --> 01:57:13,562
..who bashed up some people
in Leo bar and ran away.

1237
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:19,903
They were cowards. They
should've bashed him up.

1238
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:23,305
Who can beat him! According
to those who were..

1239
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:26,249
..present there he wasn't a human,
but he was a devil.

1240
01:57:26,573 --> 01:57:28,280
He was a strong man.

1241
01:57:28,642 --> 01:57:31,680
Police can't catch him. Now
we'll do whatever needs..

1242
01:57:31,745 --> 01:57:33,656
..to be done. We will catch him.

1243
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,852
And then we will tie him down
in the middle of some street.

1244
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:39,261
..and ask people to
throw stones at him.

1245
01:57:39,319 --> 01:57:41,993
We will lynch him on the street.

1246
01:57:49,663 --> 01:57:52,405
'But one day you will
realize your mistake.'

1247
01:57:52,866 --> 01:57:56,814
'I need help, doctor. Save me
from that demon, doctor.'

1248
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:58,281
'Are you crazy, VVilson?'

1249
01:58:47,254 --> 01:58:54,672
Jesus, I saw a ray and followed it.

1250
01:58:56,663 --> 01:59:01,408
I never knew where that
ray will lead me to.

1251
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:07,546
I left the path of truth
and I faltered.

1252
01:59:08,842 --> 01:59:11,220
I forgot a human's province..

1253
01:59:11,244 --> 01:59:14,225
..and dared to enter your horizon.

1254
01:59:15,949 --> 01:59:17,553
I was competing with you.

1255
01:59:19,419 --> 01:59:24,892
Jesus, today that ray of
light is torturing me.

1256
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:31,231
My soul is also burning
along with my body.

1257
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:34,310
Forgive me, Jesus.

1258
01:59:35,635 --> 01:59:36,705
Please forgive me.

1259
01:59:37,570 --> 01:59:38,640
Please forgive me.

1260
01:59:42,776 --> 01:59:46,246
Father. Help me, father. Help me.

1261
01:59:47,314 --> 01:59:50,625
There's darkness all over.
I can't see anything.

1262
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:55,932
Father, please show me a path.
Please show me a path.

1263
01:59:59,693 --> 02:00:03,334
Yes, my son. There's
only one way out.

1264
02:00:03,931 --> 02:00:07,879
Penance. Salvation. Remorse.

1265
02:00:09,937 --> 02:00:13,441
God forgives a person even
if he breaks His house.

1266
02:00:14,241 --> 02:00:17,711
But if he breaks someone's heart
he never forgives him.

1267
02:00:18,645 --> 02:00:21,626
Every religion of this world
says the same thing.

1268
02:00:22,349 --> 02:00:23,555
Bible says the same thing.

1269
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:26,221
The same is written
in Koran and Geeta.

1270
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:32,902
So go and apologize to the
people whom you have hurt.

1271
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:37,969
If they forgive you, God
will also forgive you.

1272
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:58,859
I am your murderer. I killed you.

1273
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,263
I never thought that
the demon inside me..

1274
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:06,736
..can do such a thing.

1275
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,696
I am your murderer.

1276
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:19,214
I came here to beg you
both for forgiveness.

1277
02:01:21,208 --> 02:01:22,243
Please forgive me.

1278
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:25,414
Please forgive me.

1279
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:47,503
I hurt all you people
a lot, especially you.

1280
02:01:49,569 --> 02:01:52,573
I came here to apologize
to you for that.

1281
02:01:55,876 --> 02:01:58,288
And I came here to tell you..

1282
02:01:58,345 --> 02:02:04,489
..that you are free from me.

1283
02:02:05,986 --> 02:02:09,934
You can marry anyone you want.

1284
02:02:10,190 --> 02:02:13,399
Wilson, do you really know
what you are saying?

1285
02:02:15,762 --> 02:02:17,332
Yes, I know what I am saying, Diana.

1286
02:02:18,264 --> 02:02:20,403
And I don't know how long
I would be in this state.

1287
02:02:22,636 --> 02:02:23,876
I am not good enough for you, Diana.

1288
02:02:24,905 --> 02:02:28,546
Dr. Wilson is destroyed. He's over.
- Wilson.

1289
02:02:29,809 --> 02:02:32,517
Diana, I love you.

1290
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:35,553
I can't see you suffering.

1291
02:02:36,716 --> 02:02:37,956
That's why I am separating from you.

1292
02:02:39,552 --> 02:02:41,225
That's what my penance is.

1293
02:02:41,888 --> 02:02:43,697
Look into my eyes, Wilson.

1294
02:02:44,624 --> 02:02:48,231
You can't see anything except
my love, my affection.

1295
02:02:48,295 --> 02:02:51,504
..my fondness, my affinity
for you in my eyes.

1296
02:02:52,732 --> 02:02:55,713
Wilson, separation can't
be the answer to my love.

1297
02:02:56,636 --> 02:02:58,445
You can't leave me like this.

1298
02:02:58,972 --> 02:03:00,974
I can't bear the pain
of your separation.

1299
02:03:02,242 --> 02:03:05,553
Wilson, I wish I could take you
into the depth of my heart.

1300
02:03:06,279 --> 02:03:08,259
I might not be married to you..

1301
02:03:08,315 --> 02:03:11,455
..but I always treated
you as my husband.

1302
02:03:12,619 --> 02:03:16,999
If you go out of my I can
never forgive myself.

1303
02:03:17,757 --> 02:03:19,259
I will punish myself in such a way..

1304
02:03:19,325 --> 02:03:22,465
..that every person who is in
love will get scared of love.

1305
02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:29,809
Wilson, I just want to know what
you are punishing me for.

1306
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:33,308
What have I done wrong!
Tell me, Wilson.

1307
02:03:33,607 --> 02:03:38,283
I will keep on asking you this
question till you answer me..

1308
02:03:38,311 --> 02:03:40,348
...even if I die asking you.

1309
02:03:40,713 --> 02:03:42,624
Tell me, Wilson. Answer me.

1310
02:03:42,749 --> 02:03:46,822
Answer me, Wilson. Answer
me. Answer me, Wilson.

1311
02:03:49,890 --> 02:03:52,496
Oh God! What have you done, Wilson!

1312
02:03:52,893 --> 02:03:54,839
I will bring some
medicine right now.

1313
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:09,276
Wilson.

1314
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:14,786
Where have you gone?

1315
02:04:39,606 --> 02:04:40,710
Wilson.

1316
02:04:44,277 --> 02:04:45,312
Leave me.

1317
02:04:45,678 --> 02:04:47,715
Help! Help!

1318
02:04:55,788 --> 02:04:56,858
Leave me!

1319
02:04:59,292 --> 02:05:00,362
Help!

1320
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:46,306
Who is that?

1321
02:05:50,277 --> 02:05:53,554
Who is that?
- Dr. Wilson.

1322
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:03,897
Dr. Wilson. Come in, Dr. Wilson.

1323
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,701
I want to talk to you
about something.

1324
02:06:12,298 --> 02:06:13,834
I am happy that you
are here, Dr. Wilson.

1325
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:16,236
I have been waiting for you.

1326
02:06:17,237 --> 02:06:18,773
This is my sister's
room, Dr. Wilson.

1327
02:06:20,339 --> 02:06:25,345
My sister whom I brought up like
a doll and whom you killed.

1328
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:28,555
Tell me, idiot, why
you killed my sister.

1329
02:06:28,848 --> 02:06:33,297
How did she harm you! Tell
me. Tell me. Tell me.

1330
02:06:54,808 --> 02:06:56,014
I'll get you, Dr. Wilson.

1331
02:06:56,576 --> 02:06:57,714
I'll get you.

1332
02:07:00,513 --> 02:07:02,754
Yes, come in mobile 9,
control speaking.

1333
02:07:02,882 --> 02:07:05,294
A murder has been committed in
Station road, bungalow no. 5.

1334
02:07:05,418 --> 02:07:06,488
The murderer is absconding. Over.

1335
02:07:21,501 --> 02:07:23,708
Diana. - Nothing can happen
now. - Don't cry.

1336
02:07:23,837 --> 02:07:28,877
Please don't cry. It won't help.
Please. - No. No. - Come on. - No.

1337
02:07:30,443 --> 02:07:31,581
Diana.

1338
02:07:40,286 --> 02:07:41,458
The murder has been committed
with this stick.

1339
02:07:44,924 --> 02:07:48,872
This is the same stick that I
gifted Wilson on his birthday.

1340
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:53,667
Oh God! One more murder.

1341
02:07:55,268 --> 02:07:57,544
He's committing so many murders.

1342
02:07:59,405 --> 02:08:00,907
There is only one way to save him.

1343
02:08:01,908 --> 02:08:03,615
He should be handed over to police.

1344
02:08:31,971 --> 02:08:36,943
There's the murderer. - But Mr.
David, how's that possible!

1345
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:39,614
He's Dr. Wilson.
- I know that.

1346
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,551
But inspector, he's the murderer
you are searching.

1347
02:08:43,583 --> 02:08:46,564
I'm sorry, but how can we
trust you? - Look there.

1348
02:08:46,753 --> 02:08:48,790
Look into his eyes.

1349
02:08:52,758 --> 02:08:53,862
Look into his eyes.

1350
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,942
Arrest Dr. Wilson!

1351
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:12,313
I want to inform the headquarters.

1352
02:09:15,214 --> 02:09:16,284
Constable, handcuff him.

1353
02:10:32,225 --> 02:10:34,865
John! Anthony! Catch him.
Don't let him escape.

1354
02:10:35,461 --> 02:10:37,964
But what was the need
to take police there!

1355
02:10:38,764 --> 02:10:40,835
You could've informed me.
You could've called me.

1356
02:10:40,967 --> 02:10:43,243
I took the police over there
because I didn't want him..

1357
02:10:43,303 --> 02:10:44,373
..to commit another murder.

1358
02:10:45,538 --> 02:10:48,246
I talked to him about
it so many times..

1359
02:10:48,274 --> 02:10:51,255
..but he never listened
to me. He was mad about.

1360
02:10:51,277 --> 02:10:53,553
..his experiments. I told him
not to.. - I'm sorry, David.

1361
02:10:54,547 --> 02:10:56,458
You were silent even after
knowing everything.

1362
02:10:56,916 --> 02:10:58,452
You had hidden the truth
from everyone.

1363
02:11:44,597 --> 02:11:48,568
Yes. Ok. Yes, I got it.

1364
02:11:49,669 --> 02:11:52,513
Mr. Wagle, if you think it's
necessary you can shoot him.

1365
02:11:52,638 --> 02:11:55,244
Sir, but I told you that.
- Mr. Sinha, you are not talking.

1366
02:11:55,274 --> 02:11:57,880
..about an ordinary person. You
are talking about a killer.

1367
02:11:58,544 --> 02:12:00,251
Don't forget that he
had already killed..

1368
02:12:00,312 --> 02:12:01,382
..3 innocent people.

1369
02:12:02,281 --> 02:12:03,783
'There's an important announcement.'

1370
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,197
‘According to the news
received just now..

1371
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:10,359
...police identified the killer
of the two innocent girls.'

1372
02:12:10,656 --> 02:12:13,193
'The listeners are warned
not to let any strangen.

1373
02:12:13,259 --> 02:12:16,206
..enter their homes. The murderer
is running towards.

1374
02:12:16,262 --> 02:12:19,607
...T. A. Baag church
on Deewar islands.'

1375
02:12:20,766 --> 02:12:22,939
Don't cry, Diana. Please don't cry.

1376
02:12:23,536 --> 02:12:26,312
We will find him out.
We will save him.

1377
02:13:21,728 --> 02:13:23,264
Sir, the murderer is
inside the church..

1378
02:13:23,329 --> 02:13:24,899
..and our men has surrounded

1379
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:27,407
Send some of your men inside.
- Ok, sir.

1380
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:32,809
And if there is any danger you
can shoot him. - Right, sir.

1381
02:13:32,938 --> 02:13:35,384
Commissioner, take your orders back.

1382
02:13:35,574 --> 02:13:38,282
Give me some time. I will go
inside and hand you over..

1383
02:13:38,311 --> 02:13:40,917
..Dr. Wilson.
- Do not interfere in our work.

1384
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:46,293
If anything happens to Dr. Wi
son..

1385
02:13:46,352 --> 02:13:51,597
..then the kids and old people
alike will be your enemies.

1386
02:13:54,393 --> 02:13:57,306
Ok. I am giving you
five minutes time..

1387
02:13:57,363 --> 02:14:00,310
..and if you are unable
to bring out Dr. Wi
son..

1388
02:14:00,366 --> 02:14:04,872
..then police will do their duty.
- Yes, I can understand that.

Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you very much.

1390
02:14:20,987 --> 02:14:23,831

Why the hell did you do it!

1412
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:39,393
No. I haven't killed Dr. Wilson.

Maria's murderers.
