1
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,985
Mogambo.. is pleased.

2
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,964
Daaga. Teja.

3
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:38,028
Use this money to spread
terror and devastation.

4
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:44,642
If terrorism,
devastation, destruction, riots..

5
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,776
..continue occurring
in India, then soon..

6
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:09,331
Next time, do your
homework on time!

7
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,283
''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''

8
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:31,850
''..seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven.. twelve, thirteen.''

9
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,861
''One, two, three.. four,
five, six..''

10
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,396
If you love movies so much..

11
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,566
.. then learn this.

12
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:48,708
The Business of movies.

13
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,969
Once you learn this..

14
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,412
.. you can watch
them and screen them.

15
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,256
One day I'm going to be an actress.

16
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,785
And my movies will be
shown in your theatre.

17
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,732
Look! Someone got
your first autograph.

18
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:21,928
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over..

19
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,772
With love.. waiting.

20
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:35,879
How should I be, o' restless heart?

21
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,785
My restless heart, please tell me.

22
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:48,692
I'm drunk.. I'm hung-over.

23
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:03,869
How could I have known?
You simply disappeared.

24
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:06,709
I changed my house.

25
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,715
Did you change your
relationships too?

26
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:14,718
You weren't around
when I needed a friend.

27
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:21,286
You didn't get married again?

28
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,857
I couldn't find you. Or
I would've married you.

29
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,461
Rahul. - Anjali.

30
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,471
We live once, die once..

31
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,634
..even marry once.

32
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,774
And we fall in love..
- just once.

33
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,390
Congratulations Kamal!

34
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,860
Your daughter's getting married.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,768
Quiet.

36
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,278
Stop this nonsense.

37
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,415
She isn't dead.
She's getting married.

38
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,615
''Tandoori Nights''. Play that one.

39
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,325
Why haven't you put the
flowers in Abhays room.

40
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,834
Come on, do it fast.

41
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:46,278
Aaliya!

42
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:49,673
I know you hate sentimental stuff.

43
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,478
Too bad.

44
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:55,582
Here goes..

45
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:58,650
Grandma gave me this ring..

46
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,287
For her daughter-in-law..

47
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:04,726
For you!

48
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,301
What a crappy dialogue, Gulati!

49
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,267
'Grandma's ring'? You serious?

50
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,900
Aaliya, grandma and grandpa eloped..

51
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,977
.. Even though no one had a
problem with their relationship.

52
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:21,909
The history of this
ring is very dramatic.

53
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,283
Al.. I love you.

54
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,716
So? Does that mean
we should get married?

55
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,017
Why are love and
marriage the same thing?

56
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,023
I mean, here's a
perfectly nice thing. Love.

57
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,490
Now let's destroy it..
Piece by piece.

58
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,430
Because if we don't get married..

59
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,866
.. what will PEOPLE say?

60
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:45,762
Al, you think I wanna marry
you 'cos of social pressure?

61
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,608
I want to get married for us.

62
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,309
For you and me.

63
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,872
I know what's gotten into you.

64
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,405
Your sister's wedding trumpets
have crawled under your skin.

65
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,852
Sorry, that can't convince me.

66
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,480
How about this?

67
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,586
I love how my mornings
begin with your voice.

68
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,622
'Cos you call for
something important like..

69
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,484
.. ''How do I
switch on the computer?''

70
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,723
And I love how passionately
you do all four of your jobs.

71
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,427
How you come to see me for an hour..

72
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,968
.. after tormenting me for fifteen..

73
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,702
.. just to say ''Gulati,
you're an idiot. Now kiss me.''

74
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,733
And I love the way
you shut your eyes..

75
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:28,579
.. and enjoy every
single bite.. from my plate.

76
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,309
And when my clothes smell of you.

77
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:35,445
Your hands on mine..
- Shut up, you idiot.

78
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,551
Let's elope right now.

79
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,357
And now we would've kissed.

80
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:45,294
But that would be weird..

81
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,799
.. 'cos I'd be kissing myself.

82
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,903
But, God, I am good.

83
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,816
Drag?

84
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:48,261
No! Smoking is bad for girls

85
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,854
Really? I thought
it's bad for anyone.

86
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,535
Men don't get pregnant.
- You're pregnant?

87
00:09:54,969 --> 00:10:00,532
No. But.. I plan to.

88
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:02,832
Marriage at twenty two.

89
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,535
First kid at twenty three.

90
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,978
Second kid, three years later.

91
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,274
My plan was simpler.

92
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,510
Turn twenty and lose my virginity!

93
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,545
Thanks for tomorrow's headlines.

94
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,423
It's a wedding, Al.

95
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,050
Please take your 'chimney' away.

96
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,386
So your wedding smoke is
'devotion'.. And mine is pollution?

97
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:22,861
Hypocrite!
- Come on, Al.

98
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,661
And spare me your lecture
the cigar is for my play.

99
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,961
I have to look convincing!

100
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:29,026
But why are you
rehearsing when you are a smoker?

101
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:33,565
Hang on! A play?
- Street play.

102
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:36,076
Which means aunty Ayesha
definitely doesn't know about it.

103
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,504
Nope, 'cos she'll freak out..

104
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,035
.. the minute she
hears the word 'acting'.

105
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,941
It's just one show.
At Pragati Maidan.

106
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,607
No one will ever know.

107
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,049
But you do.

108
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,843
Just tell aunty and end the lies.

109
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,444
Stop compromising.

110
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,047
The amount you act in real life..
- Less than you.

111
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:51,949
'Born in his Papa's theatre..

112
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,722
.. and numbed to
death by it's boredom.'

113
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,956
Thanks for your
wisdom and sensitivity.

114
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,363
Screw sensitivity!

115
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,800
Uncle Jeet's theatre
business will be fine without you.

116
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,361
This is the Nth time.
- What?

117
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,741
Whenever I point out your problem..

118
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,710
.. you turn the spotlight on me.

119
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,405
But you started.. - But..

120
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,947
Since you won't
focus on your problem..

121
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:17,712
.. without discussing mine,
let's focus on me.

122
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:22,554
Let's say I tell dad I'm not
interested in his business.

123
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:27,019
Let's say he doesn't get multiple
cardiac arrests from this news.

124
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,793
What will I do then?
- That's the best part.

125
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:31,761
You'll find out, Gulati.

126
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,628
Let's travel. Let's be nomads.

127
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:38,564
Is this honeymoon ever
going to end? - Aunt Pammi.

128
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,340
When are you getting married?

129
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,636
We're thinking about it.
- Not thought about it.

130
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,809
Tell your babe that if
she continues like this..

131
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,610
..she'll stay single
like me. - Don't beat her.

132
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:51,584
If you're so desperate,
why don't you marry? - Rude!

133
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,379
I'm ahead of you by three divorces.

134
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,714
Can't help a quirky destiny.

135
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,759
Destiny is never quirky.
People are.

136
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,488
But aren't quirky
people the most fun?

137
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,991
Cigarette packets come
with a warning, people don't.

138
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,296
Doesn't stop you
from smoking, does it?

139
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,394
Wow.

140
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,462
So put your money where your
mouth is the altar's ready.

141
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,837
Get married.

142
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:15,942
Look, Ayesha is here as well.

143
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,013
Your mother still looks stunning.

144
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,508
See how she still affects people.

145
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:26,009
Here comes the superstar!

146
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,519
Still thinks she's a superstar.

147
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,424
See how their tails start wagging.

148
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,023
She still looks a million bucks.

149
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,026
Hi, Aunty.
- Hi, dear.

150
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,464
I love your sari.

151
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:41,866
But where is Aaliya?

152
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,999
Must be up to her
usual tricks somewhere.

153
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:46,801
Oh no!

154
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,841
What's the rush?
- Can't you smell it?

155
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,850
This henna smells so bad
it's affecting my brains.

156
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,454
Girls look happy with
henna on their hands..

157
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,750
.. 'cos they're
actually high on this dung.

158
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:08,820
Yonks ago if a lassie had not
this shite in her fair hands..

159
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,725
.. a laddie could carry her away.

160
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,759
Henna marked a woman betrothed.

161
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,304
What say thee?

162
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,301
Shall I abduct ye?

163
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:23,041
Who's stopping you?

164
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,369
Or will ye need steroids?

165
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,723
You've got competition.

166
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,500
The maiden is mine.

167
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:49,866
Lower ye eyes.

168
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,769
She's your sister.

169
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,302
Sis left.

170
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,420
They could've done a court-marriage.

171
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,388
Why are weddings such a circus?

172
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,553
Dumped another thing on her.

173
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,957
She looks like a clothes shop.

174
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:14,358
She's smiling.

175
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,591
''She's smiling.''

176
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,564
Some coma patients
also smile, stupid..

177
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:19,964
.. doesn't mean they're happy.

178
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,767
She's smiling 'cos no one
knows Jai is holding her hands.

179
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,871
They are celebrating the
biggest day of their lives..

180
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,637
..with the most
important people in their lives.

181
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,813
I can't see anyone important here.

182
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,371
I'm here for the free food.

183
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,314
The men are here
for the free whiskey.

184
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,353
And the women are
missing their TV serials.

185
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,948
Stupid.

186
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:44,317
There won't be a repeat
telecast of my sister's wedding.

187
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,889
And happiness grows
only when you share it.

188
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,590
Say that dialogue again.

189
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,299
Happiness grows only
when you share it.

190
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:18,651
Like a wild river..

191
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:24,260
.. she ripples without a care.

192
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,663
Like a gentle stream ..

193
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:33,537
.. he lets his silences sing.

194
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,840
Her fiery sands sting his feet..

195
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,410
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.

196
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,777
You, my dear, are lost without me..

197
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,018
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

198
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:56,654
You, my dear, are lost without me..

199
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,723
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

200
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,736
'I love you, Gelato.'
- Hello, 'baby'.

201
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,436
Another fight?

202
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:11,570
Another slap?

203
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:14,547
'Sorry, baby.'
- 'Kiss me, baby'.

204
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,675
'Sorry, baby! Kiss me, baby!'

205
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,276
Buzz off!

206
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,013
Bye.

207
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,555
There are many ways to die, Al.

208
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:29,591
Then let's try this.
We'll die together.

209
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,933
She melts clouds in her hands..

210
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:49,405
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.

211
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,310
She melts clouds in her hands..

212
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:58,516
.. and fills still
nights with laughter.

213
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:03,291
So fearless, carefree
and thirsty for life..

214
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:07,858
.. I'm helpless
with her and without.

215
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:10,233
Are you a character from Saas-Bahu
(a popular genre on TV) serials?

216
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:13,530
It's sign of respect Al..
that comes from the heart.

217
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,802
Then I should take the
blessings of any elder.

218
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:17,571
Hello, Uncle.
- Bless you.

219
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,772
I hope you two get married soon.

220
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:21,981
Happy Diwali, sir!

221
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,376
So don't do it. It's
not an obligation.

222
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,554
I do it 'cos it makes ma and
papa happy. And that makes me happy.

223
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,485
If it made someone happy,
wouldn't you.. - Suffer spondylitis?

224
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:31,718
No way!

225
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,419
What's wrong with your family?

226
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,519
One cigarette, please.

227
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,792
I'm sorry we're so normal.
And not as 'cool' as you!

228
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,994
Perhaps we should all start
smoking 'cos that's so 'rebellious'.

229
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,461
That's it.

230
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,299
Al..
- Screw you, Gulati.

231
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,295
Superb idea!

232
00:17:52,947 --> 00:18:01,651
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..

233
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:06,292
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.

234
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,592
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores

235
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:15,565
He opens vials of
perfumes in her heart..

236
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,729
''I've searched for
love high and low.''.

237
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,932
.. and looks for
love-filled shells on sandy shores

238
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:24,341
He fills his world with love..

239
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,707
''The closeness of hearts,
the streams of desires.''

240
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:28,908
.. as she fills hers with dreams.

241
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,873
He was not flirting with me.

242
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,475
Yes, he was.

243
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,453
Trust me, I am a guy.
- You're jealous.

244
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:35,921
You're blind.
- What?

245
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,587
Can't a boy and a girl..

246
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:41,294
A boy and a girl can't
be 'just good friends'.

247
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,893
So if we break-up
we can't be friends.

248
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:49,629
Nope.

249
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,630
God, you're such an old-fashioned..

250
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,368
.. almost chauvinistic..
- You're an idiot.

251
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,708
I can't believe I am with you.

252
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:58,870
I am sexy.

253
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,980
You, my dear, are lost without me..

254
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:12,420
.. and I'm incomplete without you.

255
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:15,726
Like a wild river..

256
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:20,924
.. she ripples without a care.

257
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,532
Like a gentle stream ..

258
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,300
.. he lets his silences sing.

259
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:35,514
Her fiery sands sting his feet..

260
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,477
.. like sunshine tickles rainy days.

261
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:44,581
You, my dear, are lost without me..

262
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:47,718
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

263
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:53,524
You, my dear, are lost without me..

264
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:56,764
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

265
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,432
You, my dear, are lost without me..

266
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,968
.. like I'm incomplete without you.

267
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,576
I am Shah Rukh Khan.

268
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:19,292
This is probably the most disturbing
thing you ever said to me.

269
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:25,290
I am a star in
every scene of my life.

270
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,896
Okay.

271
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,009
What if you fail to
become an actor?

272
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,310
Lying to your mother..

273
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,542
Everything's going
to change Gelati.

274
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:43,877
Gulato?

275
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,353
What's your name?
- Sunita.

276
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,085
Sunita!

277
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,524
I have a sexy plan, Sunita.

278
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:55,659
But I'll tell you later 'cos I
don't want to lose the high.

279
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,354
Oh God! Another plan!

280
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,699
Sunita, you're so cute..
- What?

281
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,729
Stress makes you look cuter.

282
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,037
'Oh God! Another plan!'

283
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:12,444
I'm okay.

284
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:17,049
You're my stud, Sunita.

285
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,485
You can handle anything.

286
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,953
And you take advantage of that.

287
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,789
Don't say that.

288
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,018
You know I'm 'nonsense person'.

289
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:30,328
Understand, Sunita.
- Why?

290
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,523
Why should I understand?

291
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,635
Who argues?
- Me.

292
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,399
Who is stupid?
- Me.

293
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:41,737
Who is impulsive?
- Me, Your Honour, me.

294
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,438
Then why should I understand?

295
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,613
Who is older? You!

296
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,006
Who is mature? You!

297
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,543
Who is understanding? You!

298
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:54,318
Who is sensible? You.

299
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,619
So it's all up to you, Sunita.

300
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,089
You've to handle everything.

301
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:59,622
Because if you let go..

302
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:03,623
You complete me.

303
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,398
Shah Rukh, please!

304
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:10,369
I am the kite and you're my bread.
- Thread.

305
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:13,372
I fly and you let me go higher..

306
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,700
But as soon as you sense danger..

307
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:18,001
.. you pull me back.

308
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,974
What if the thread breaks?

309
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,605
Don't say that.

310
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:24,515
Ask the Thread Maintenance
Department to look after it.

311
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,452
It can't break, it can't break.
- I'll talk to them.

312
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:31,681
Promise?
- I promise.

313
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,385
'Cos I love flying a lot..

314
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:38,287
I can't help it. - I've noticed.

315
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,361
You know, I'm a USA.

316
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,461
UFO. - I know. Same thing.

317
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,067
So you'll stick around, right?

318
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,075
You won't let us drift apart.

319
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:52,072
Say it.. !

320
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,646
Sunita, where are you taking me?
- To bed.

321
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,042
I will never let us break.

322
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,574
I promise.

323
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,359
Hello. - Ayesha has started
her classic emotional blackmail.

324
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,496
So much melodrama..

325
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,404
It was a long shot. !
Didn't think I'd get in.

326
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,965
Al, calm down

327
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:57,340
She's so unreasonable.

328
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:59,777
She's been gone into
sentimental Overdrive.

329
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:01,610
Al, are you nuts? This is an office.

330
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,741
If she wasn't my mother,
I would've left home.

331
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,444
Shut up!

332
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,580
This is an office. People work here!

333
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,988
It's a loo actually.

334
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:13,518
What happened?

335
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,963
Good news, I've got admission here.

336
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,832
Bad news, Ayesha has flatly
refused my going to Gold Coast.

337
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:21,894
Just a sec! You're
going to Australia?

338
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:25,336
Obviously not. I want to,
but Ayesha won't let me go.

339
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:26,565
When did you apply?

340
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,937
Three months ago.

341
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,766
It was a long shot.
Didn't think I'd get in.

342
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,574
Thought I'd tell you both
about it.. - From the airport?

343
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,908
Abhay, I am already quite tense
I don't need your senti-crap now!

344
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:38,349
And I don't need two moms.

345
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,509
I am getting sentimental?

346
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,384
It's a one year course..

347
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:47,452
.. in another country
without telling anyone..

348
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,961
.. and this is your good news?

349
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:50,823
You're unbelievable.

350
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,765
I didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you would react like this..

351
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,434
There's a difference
between a plan and a decision.

352
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,698
If this was so important for you
why didn't you tell me before?

353
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:00,866
Why are you all so bloody emotional?

354
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,401
Gelato, understand!

355
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:05,639
Thought I'd surprise you guys
once the scholarship comes in.

356
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,408
I didn't think mom would react
badly to a Communications course.

357
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:09,877
And me?

358
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,910
I shouldn't react either?

359
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,980
I know. I'm sorry.

360
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:19,685
I knew you'd freak out, and so..

361
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,352
I freak out 'cos I'm always..

362
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,555
.. competing with
your lists and plans.

363
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:26,390
Where do I fit in your life, Aaliya?

364
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,434
Where do you fit in your own life?

365
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,833
Don't like what you're doing.

366
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,564
Don't know what you want to do.

367
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,539
And you've the nerve to tell me
that I shouldn't follow my dreams.

368
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,371
You're doing it again!

369
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,635
Instead of pointing out my flaws..

370
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,542
.. focus on your actions,
for a change.

371
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:40,739
I'm trying to.

372
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:43,681
You wouldn't be angry if
you understood 'focus'!

373
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,477
You're a boring
executive in your dad's office..

374
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:47,815
..who doesn't even know himself..

375
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,355
..and you're okay with it!

376
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,353
Where is the fire,
Abhay? What do you want?

377
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,756
I don't know.

378
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:55,557
But I'm not scared to
admit this truth. Unlike you.

379
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,597
Who's only solution
to problems is lying!

380
00:25:57,664 --> 00:26:00,360
Because you can't hear the truth,
Abhay. You're too scared!

381
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,627
Try me, Al.
- Fine.

382
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,395
You don't have a life.
I am your life.

383
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:10,009
Your life shouldn't be disturbed,
and to hell with mine!

384
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,704
I'm not your 'love'. I'm your habit!

385
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,576
You're actually defending this?

386
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,807
You're lying and telling
me I don't really love you?

387
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,614
You're pathetic.
- And you're delusional!

388
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,483
You've decided to go to Australia..

389
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,887
So your mom and I
should just 'deal with it'!

390
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,323
To hell with our feelings.
- What about my feelings?

391
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,724
You don't have any.

392
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,955
You're just a
selfish programmed robot.

393
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,759
You couldn't
communicate with two people..

394
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:33,459
.. and you want to do
'Mass' Communications.

395
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:52,008
So you think he's unambitious,
unhappy..

396
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,319
.. and lacks focus.

397
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,549
And his problem is that you're..

398
00:26:56,623 --> 00:27:00,252
.. over-ambitious, you
focus on everything..

399
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,622
.. except him.

400
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,656
And you know what?

401
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,959
I see his point.

402
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,697
You two should
seriously get married!

403
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,929
What a pair!

404
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:14,667
You're casually joking
about this 'cos you know..

405
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:16,470
.. how committed he is towards you.

406
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:19,976
No matter what, he
will still love you.

407
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:24,243
I need some space from that love.
- Bravo.

408
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,416
Spoken like your dad's daughter!

409
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:29,252
Dad cheated on you, ma!

410
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,787
And what did you do?

411
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,460
Lied to me, as usual.

412
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,524
For what, Aunty?

413
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,632
A silly course. A year long course.

414
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,530
Stop whining!

415
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,900
Telling you late is not lying!

416
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:49,537
She's no saint but
she's independent.

417
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:54,306
So let her be. Why
does it bother you?

418
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:57,414
Why cook for an army over this?

419
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,349
Aaliya is independent, adventurous..

420
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,287
.. wants to experience everything.

421
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:03,718
And I love that about her.

422
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:06,722
But that's what's
throwing me out of her life.

423
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,293
And she's okay with that.

424
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:09,693
What's wrong with that?

425
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:12,425
I want to travel. See the world.

426
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,625
Live on my own, free as a bird.

427
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,500
Are we threatening your freedom?

428
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,696
Buddy boy, go or not..

429
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,999
If she's even thinking about going..

430
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,765
.. one thing's for sure.

431
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:25,571
Are you breaking up with him?

432
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,370
She wants to act!

433
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,731
And Acting is the most
popular course of that college.

434
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,602
I'm sure you noticed that.

435
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:06,743
This is just an
excuse to get out of here.

436
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,908
When Aaliya was six..

437
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:16,616
.. she convinced her teacher
that she couldn't do homework

438
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,926
As her actress mom
couldn't pack her lunch-box..

439
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:24,392
.. and Aaliya had to do
all her chores herself.

440
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,562
Just to escape homework!

441
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:30,334
You know what?

442
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,971
If I was Aaliya's teacher..

443
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,341
.. I'd have bought
the story as well.

444
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,033
Aaliya is that good.

445
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:42,705
These small lies are just a
rehearsal to become an actress.

446
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,578
She thinks it's fun.

447
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:57,463
Who knows what she
might do in Australia?

448
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:03,394
She hasn't seen the real,
ugly side of this world..

449
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:06,599
.. which I have.

450
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,403
I was married to it.

451
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:13,946
There are all sorts of
people in this world..

452
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:16,411
.. notjust one's like Al's dad.

453
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,342
She will make mistakes.

454
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,344
And she has a right to.

455
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,419
How else will your
stubborn daughter learn?

456
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,694
The blemish is inside, not on it.

457
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,299
Let it be.

458
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,405
That's what makes it unique!

459
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:40,657
Aunty has one condition.

460
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,828
Only Communications. No acting.

461
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:07,658
Al. I'm doing a boring
job in my dad's office..

462
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,854
But I'm not lying to myself.

463
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,492
I know. I'm sorry.

464
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,329
But..
- I know.

465
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:18,964
I don't want to lose myself either.

466
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,569
Take a risk, Gulati.

467
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,573
You're the smartest guy I know.

468
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,578
If you stay so safe..
- You balance that..

469
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:27,939
.. Risk-taker!

470
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,611
You're even risking us.

471
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:32,982
Are you mad? What risk!

472
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,355
Aren't we still together after
yesterday's record-breaking fight.

473
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:38,948
A year's break won't
make any difference.

474
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,551
What 'break'?

475
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,423
Don't be an idiot.

476
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:47,022
Being apart for a year
is an obvious break!

477
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,331
Al, one doesn't apply for
'casual leave' in a relationship!

478
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,001
Are you breaking up with me?

479
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:56,969
No, you sentimental freak!
Don't complicate it.

480
00:33:57,377 --> 00:34:00,574
This is not a break-up,
this is just a little.. break.

481
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,711
What does a 'little break' mean, Al?

482
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,445
Think before you answer.

483
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,654
Do you know what a
'little break' is?

484
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,625
No, but I know that we need it.

485
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,889
We need to find ourselves.

486
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,928
I just hope we don't lose each
other while finding ourselves.

487
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,797
We won't.

488
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,437
You won't let it happen.

489
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,404
Don't lose hope, Gulati.

490
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:35,942
What are you thinking?

491
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,946
It's time to fax the
'Thread Maintenance Dept.'

492
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:25,496
Don't lie, I know
you're missing no one.

493
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,724
Met your aunt yet? - No, but
she's lived in Oz for twenty years.

494
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,032
Besides, mom's sister
is bound to be cool.

495
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:49,649
Ayesha first spoiled you
and now she's regretting it.

496
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,453
Had you come to me earlier
she wouldn't be ruing this day.

497
00:35:54,928 --> 00:35:57,453
What's wrong with this day?

498
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:58,824
You don't like Tuesdays?

499
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:02,367
No boys, no late-nights.

500
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,630
And no phone calls after eleven.

501
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,497
What?

502
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:10,008
I need to pee. Shall I hold or wait?

503
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:22,377
And finally a whiff of fresh air..

504
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:29,693
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.

505
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,497
My heart wants to hum..

506
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:39,331
While he wants to sing..

507
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:43,033
I smile, he giggles..

508
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:47,435
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.

509
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:53,546
Distances are important too.

510
00:36:54,387 --> 00:37:02,419
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

511
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:08,801
Distances are important too.

512
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:17,773
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

513
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:24,547
Distances are important too.

514
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:33,590
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

515
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,789
She said my skirt's
too short! Change it.

516
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,329
Imagine! Even Ayesha
never said this to me!

517
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,492
But why are we discussing her?
- Thank you.

518
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,794
The kids were
missing you today. -Who?

519
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,930
The kids we meet at the signal, Al!

520
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:49,872
You've forgotten them already?
- Don't be silly.

521
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,742
Hey, if I murder my aunt..

522
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,610
.. where should I hide
her body? -Al, please.

523
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:57,841
Can we please talk
about something else?

524
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:01,409
I have to live with her,
Gulati! -So do I.

525
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,852
Gelato, guess what?

526
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,286
Your aunt is wearing a bikini
and head banging in the campus.

527
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,350
I was not talking about her.

528
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,687
Sometimes you're more
irritating than my aunt!

529
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,629
And we're back to your aunt!

530
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:16,265
Alright. We'll talk about aunt only.

531
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:21,399
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..

532
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,246
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.

533
00:38:30,717 --> 00:38:34,585
Look but don't touch; its fire..

534
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:38,454
..just watch it shimmer from afar..

535
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,858
..any closer and you could burn..

536
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,922
..powerless against this crazy whim.

537
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,734
Distances are important too.

538
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:58,710
Sometimes you gotta
chase space. - Hi, guys.

539
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:01,747
Hi, I'm Rishabh.
- Hi, Aaliya.

540
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,543
You were really good today.
- Thanks.

541
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,453
God, my aunt.

542
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:12,554
Gotta go, guys.

543
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,789
It's 10 O' clock.
She could've called me.

544
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,226
I don't know what to do with her.

545
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,762
She just walked in.

546
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:26,669
Ayesha, I agreed to house my niece,
not to become part of local gossip!

547
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,569
She thinks it's ok to be
wild 'cos this is Australia!

548
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,641
Has no respect for elders.

549
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,296
It's called survival, Gelato.

550
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,759
So what?

551
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:30,666
This isn't India, it's Australia.

552
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:32,432
It's a bench in Australia.

553
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,300
Sounds really adventurous.

554
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:38,408
Look, dad has a
partner in Melbourne..

555
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,309
Ah! So I should leave
one dictatorship and..

556
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:42,074
..enter another rulebook!

557
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:44,612
Know what? Why don't I
just come back home?

558
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,675
Why explore the world, right?

559
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:48,311
Please don't do that.

560
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,785
Who will do the other
courses in the world?

561
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,620
Like the one in Switzerland,
on Snow Management.

562
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:54,023
Screw you!

563
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,823
We've been arguing for over two
months! I'm sick of this shit!

564
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,903
I'm.. sorry, I don't want to fight.

565
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,404
I just want to help you.

566
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,438
Let's not talk for a few days, ok?

567
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:14,609
How will that help, Al?

568
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,608
If we don't hear
each other's voices..

569
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,309
..we'll have very little left?

570
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:20,546
No, Gulati.

571
00:41:22,955 --> 00:41:24,388
It'll make us stronger.

572
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,532
Ok. Let's try this as well.

573
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,873
But you're a 'nonsense person'.

574
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:45,439
Bye, sweety.

575
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,376
I love you, sweety.

576
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,285
I've never felt so
pathetically poor.

577
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,256
Who can afford 200 dollars a month?

578
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:04,724
I'm screwed, man.

579
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,366
Hey, I have an idea!

580
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:12,867
You can stay where I live
if you pay advance rent.

581
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,896
Six hundred for six months.

582
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,833
Sorted!

583
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:18,535
What?
- Yup.

584
00:42:18,611 --> 00:42:20,738
That's awesome. Thank you.

585
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,788
Did you leave this pink
toothbrush in my bathroom?

586
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:40,329
What?
- I did.

587
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,424
Good. Come.

588
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:49,999
Last night was sensational.
- Deja vouz!

589
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:51,703
That's yours.

590
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:54,573
That's the way. Don't call.

591
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,842
I'll call or not.

592
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,842
Were there the two of
you last night? - No, I'm..

593
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,410
No one cares who you are.

594
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:03,955
Get out.
- Excuse me?

595
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,423
Are you dumb and deaf? No
one gives a shit who you are!

596
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:07,857
She needs to take a shit!

597
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,326
But.. -Why aren't you at the shack?

598
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,487
I wasn't in the mood.

599
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:11,894
I'm in the mood to cut
your wage. -Just a sec..

600
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,454
You can't cut your
elder brother's pay.

601
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:14,932
Bite me!

602
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,764
You work for me. I own that shack!

603
00:43:16,836 --> 00:43:18,497
Don't make me angry, Cyrus.

604
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,933
You're Cyrus? Is this your house?

605
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,275
Wow! Ms. India has brains too.

606
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,401
She's not your type.

607
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,774
And you
- that's called a door..

608
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,780
.. and if you lift those two,
you might discover walking.

609
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:29,974
Excuse me.

610
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:32,576
Or we can do something
else with them. - What?

611
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,381
This is not a freaking motel, Cy!

612
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:38,753
Thanks, that was butt ugly.

613
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:39,916
Freaks, I'm Aaliya..

614
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,289
Rishabh sent me here.
- Aaliya.

615
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,520
Why didn't you say that earlier?

616
00:43:42,595 --> 00:43:43,857
He finally got a hot babe.

617
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,830
We were expecting you..
- I'm not his babe.

618
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:48,526
Sorry about the confusion..
got the rent?

619
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:51,567
600 dollars.
- Are you single?

620
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:54,673
What? - You'll need to
learn to ignore my brother.

621
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,398
Can I feel that butt?

622
00:43:56,876 --> 00:44:01,245
I've handled bigger sleazes in
Delhi buses. You're nothing.

623
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:03,445
Nads.
- Yes.

624
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,983
What's a 'sleazoid'?

625
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:08,313
Oh, by the way. I am Nadia.

626
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:10,378
Hi.
- This feels good.

627
00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:12,321
Spank me while you're at it.

628
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:17,524
Our house.

629
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:19,831
The beach bed.

630
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,290
Our beach shack.

631
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:27,704
Where we rent out surfboards. Cyrus!

632
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:30,969
My real talents emerge at the bar!

633
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,575
Nadia likes pain.

634
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:37,907
And your room.

635
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,909
If you need anything..
don't tell me.

636
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,852
It's perfect.

637
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:51,625
Distances are important too..

638
00:44:51,998 --> 00:44:57,959
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

639
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:06,877
Distances are important too..

640
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,444
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

641
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:22,484
Distances are important too..

642
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:28,895
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

643
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,536
Let me see.

644
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:43,272
Why don't you just tell your parents
you don't want to get married.

645
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,747
You don't know them.

646
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,753
It's easier to get married.

647
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,583
No, it's easier to get laid.

648
00:45:52,658 --> 00:45:55,650
Let's Party, you losers!
- Party!

649
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,384
Gelato! !
- How are you?

650
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,855
Thirty days and thirty hours.
Not bad, huh!

651
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:06,659
Can't hear a thing, hang on..

652
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:08,290
Move your ass!

653
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,700
I'd love to, but..
who's dying behind you?

654
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:15,699
It's Cyrus. He's nuts!

655
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:20,507
I'm in an amazing place.
My room is sea-facing!

656
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,004
I'm living in a private island..
for just six hundred dollars!

657
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:28,819
That's.. cheap, right?
-Super cheap. And for six months.

658
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,719
Six hundred for six months?

659
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,282
Sounds too good to be true, Al.

660
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:34,619
You doubt so much, Gelato.

661
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:36,923
Why so serious?

662
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,968
Why's everyone screaming,
What kind of a party is this?

663
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:46,835
It's unbelievably crazy!
We've been partying for two days.

664
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:49,636
It's Rishab's farewell
party and everyone's smashed!

665
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,733
Enough about me. How are you?

666
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,845
Same shit, different day!

667
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,510
Who's Rishab?

668
00:47:56,982 --> 00:47:58,711
A sexy stud! Happy?

669
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:00,876
We're all friends and live together.

670
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:03,387
Chill, Al. I haven't
heard your voice for a month.

671
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:05,456
You've made new friends.

672
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,686
Let's get naked!

673
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,522
Who.. hate their clothes,

674
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,357
New place, new friends.

675
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,660
It's natural, Gulati.

676
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:17,793
Don't assume what
you can't see is shady!

677
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,831
Know what? I don't want to argue.

678
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,503
You want me to understand your
life after you throw me out of it?

679
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,837
What are you doing, Al?
Why are you fighting ?

680
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,744
I'm taking a break.

681
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:30,907
Hello?

682
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,777
Damn!

683
00:48:51,737 --> 00:48:53,830
Look, fighting will
not help anything..

684
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:55,032
Buddy..

685
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,536
You're in a long queue here!

686
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,907
You're in queue!

687
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:05,777
I just need.. a break.

688
00:49:15,728 --> 00:49:17,389
Six in the evening?

689
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,498
What the..

690
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,799
Thank God for small mercies!

691
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,246
O' what a beautiful.. Hello! !

692
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:39,774
Congratulations!
- On?

693
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:42,345
On finally getting some action.
- What?

694
00:49:42,588 --> 00:49:43,919
Look at her, dude.

695
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:45,547
She has more
facial hair than Rishab.

696
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,383
Why do you think
he brought you here?

697
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,893
For some 'lurve'.

698
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,796
Just wanted a piece of heaven..

699
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:55,493
.. before he spent the
rest of his life in hell!

700
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:57,398
You asshole! Get up.

701
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,330
I thought you were a friend..

702
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,531
I'll cut your..

703
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:01,903
Into so many pieces..

704
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:05,375
.. you'll never be able to have sex

705
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:07,001
Hang on.
- Shut up.

706
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,012
Listen..
- How could you even think about..

707
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,649
I'm going to kill you.. !
- What happened?

708
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,383
Gulati, what the
hell are you doing here?

709
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,755
Looked cute, so I let him in.
- What!

710
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,827
Did you touch her?
- He's your boyfriend?

711
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:25,827
Abhay, stop it. Spank him harder.

712
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,423
Did you touch her?
- I don't remember.

713
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,663
What?
- You asshole. 'Don't remember'!

714
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:34,565
There's nothing to remember.
- What did he do?

715
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,403
Gulati, nothing happened.

716
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,575
What's a 'Gulati'?
- I knew something was wrong.

717
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:39,872
Now he would be able
to touch any girl again.

718
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,469
He's running away.

719
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:46,082
Stop recording, man!
- Come in.

720
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:48,047
This is so going on You Tube.

721
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,519
How'd you get here so soon?

722
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,889
We just spoke today.

723
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,393
We spoke yesterday, Al.

724
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:58,453
And five minutes later, a
drunk man picked up your phone ..

725
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,656
.. and told me to ''get in line''.

726
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:01,029
But I told you to back-off.

727
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,325
Why call in the first place?

728
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:05,603
Why can't you deal with this break?

729
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:07,332
Break doesn't mean..

730
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,002
And what the hell does
a 'break' mean anyway?

731
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,407
It means she's dumped you! !

732
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,476
I was so hoping you
wouldn't feel insecure.

733
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:18,277
''Don't help me. Don't
discuss my problems.Don't call me.''

734
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,612
You have a problem with everything.

735
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:20,777
Your only response is fear.

736
00:51:20,853 --> 00:51:22,582
You do that to people, Al.

737
00:51:22,654 --> 00:51:24,815
Your mom found out two days
later that you're not at your aunt's.

738
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,324
She was so freaked out.
- Don't drag Ayesha into this.

739
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:28,724
She didn't come running here.

740
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,762
'Cos I keep
telling her to trust you.

741
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:32,729
Since you got here..
- Don't start.

742
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,356
You're here 'cos you've got issues.

743
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:35,593
We have issues, Al.

744
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,725
You're so blinded by your dreams..

745
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,430
I don't want to deal
with your problems.

746
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:43,463
This is it. - You don't want
to deal with our problems.

747
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:45,442
You're not taking a break,
you're running away.

748
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:47,434
I am breaking up with you.

749
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:53,645
You don't mean that.

750
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,411
I do.

751
00:51:58,957 --> 00:52:00,447
I can't do this anymore.

752
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,491
One little problem and
you throw it all away?

753
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:06,659
That's your quick fix?

754
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,526
And so easy for you to do?

755
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,559
It's become so complicated
that nothing else can be done.

756
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:15,501
It's not complicated, it's
just inconvenient for you.

757
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:17,735
You don't want it, right? Fine.

758
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,502
But I won't accept it.

759
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:20,806
We're not over just
because you say it's over.

760
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:22,369
Just let it go, Abhay!

761
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:33,816
We can't be over when
you snap your fingers.

762
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,360
Relationships are built by
togetherness, not space!

763
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,987
Your priorities have changed,
not mine.

764
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,332
We will fix this.

765
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:45,032
Until you come back to your senses..

766
00:52:45,604 --> 00:52:48,004
.. and listen carefully
for I mean every word..

767
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,030
I'm NOT going anywhere!

768
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:51,870
I'm staying right here.

769
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:54,842
You've lost it, Abhay.

770
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,038
And what do you mean by ''here''?

771
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,407
Where will you stay?
- Stay here, dude.

772
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:00,910
What?
- What?

773
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,476
I like you.
- Really?

774
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,580
Nads, I got here first,
I've paid advance rent.

775
00:53:05,657 --> 00:53:07,648
Not in a man-love way.

776
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,761
I just.. 'like' you!,

777
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,557
He ain't leavingjust
'cos you say so. So chill.

778
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:16,294
When's your flight?
- Tomorrow.

779
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,297
And we don't want you to miss it.

780
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,270
So you can spend the
night at the airport.

781
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,431
But..
- What?

782
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:23,600
Advance rent.. ?
- Six months, I know.

783
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:25,006
I'm Abhay.
- Nadia.

784
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:26,767
And I am the retard.

785
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:29,674
No. No, no, no.

786
00:53:29,715 --> 00:53:32,275
One second. You and I can't
live under the same roof..

787
00:53:32,351 --> 00:53:34,876
Why not? - Because.. - I'm
your EX-boyfriend, right?

788
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,689
Know what? You're right.

789
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:40,552
Please stay here.

790
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:41,991
But we're so through.

791
00:53:44,496 --> 00:53:45,724
My stuff?

792
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,398
I'll take it later.

793
00:53:57,743 --> 00:53:59,233
Lose unwanted weight.

794
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:00,801
Make your body look attractive.

795
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:02,870
Pick up the phone and order now.

796
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,575
Telemall's Home Jogger.

797
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:08,942
Either you're really
stupid or really blind.

798
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:11,687
''Gulati, what the hell
are you doing here?''

799
00:54:13,692 --> 00:54:15,626
One day, I gave a girl my word..

800
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,560
.. that I will never
let us break apart.

801
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,293
And I intend to keep my word.

802
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,368
Say goodbye to obesity, but not us.

803
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,633
We will return with
this unique invention..

804
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:34,941
.. after a short break!

805
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,871
You're up early!
What's the time there?

806
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:03,252
Eight in the morning.

807
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,878
That's funny, even here..

808
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:10,651
My neighbour's a strange girl..

809
00:55:11,695 --> 00:55:15,756
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

810
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,602
My neighbour's a strange girl..

811
00:55:21,705 --> 00:55:25,766
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

812
00:55:26,877 --> 00:55:30,938
My life's in a strange phase..

813
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:36,245
..And teases in strange ways.

814
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:40,981
My life's in a strange phase..

815
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:46,188
..And teases in strange ways.

816
00:55:46,664 --> 00:55:50,600
My neighbour's a strange girl..

817
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:55,730
.. with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

818
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,232
Shit!

819
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,141
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

820
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,306
How about some breakfast?

821
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:16,816
Not your credit cards! !
Have you lost it?

822
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:18,120
It's not worth it, dude.

823
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:19,786
Not for a girl.

824
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,022
Go on, Abhay, do it.

825
00:56:21,231 --> 00:56:22,596
Don't listen to her.

826
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,826
She doesn't even believe in love.

827
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:26,059
I believe in respect. Screw love.

828
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:30,102
Well done!.

829
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,868
Last one.

830
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:37,610
Dude!

831
00:56:46,957 --> 00:56:56,025
Such a cruel thirst, I see
but not sip this water..

832
00:56:56,967 --> 00:57:05,932
..I live my dreams in
such a cruel reality.

833
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:10,611
A strange possibilities,
they open a window..

834
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:13,844
..only to cast a stranger view!

835
00:57:14,284 --> 00:57:16,775
Yes, he's 'sweet'! Should
I make a candy out of him?

836
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:19,085
This drama has gone
on for two months!

837
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,813
Breaking up was easier.

838
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,290
Nothing's difficult,
aunty. She's just a bit miffed.

839
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,355
But I have a plan.

840
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:27,730
See each other's point of
view instead of fighting.

841
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:28,924
I'm trying to do that.

842
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,967
That's what I'm doing,
- No, not you, son.

843
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:32,634
Stop yelling, Aaliya.

844
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:33,761
I'm not yelling.

845
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:36,704
I'm trying to make him see..
- That's it..

846
00:57:36,774 --> 00:57:38,241
..it's a pointless fight.

847
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:40,906
I don't know what he wants.
- I know what she wants.

848
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:46,949
Get off the phone.

849
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:48,948
What's your problem,

850
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,281
Why're you calling Ayesha?

851
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:52,613
She's my mom.

852
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,791
My mom, my life, my house, my..

853
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,252
..and your room too.

854
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:58,920
Hello!

855
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,688
What are you doing here?

856
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,025
I'm taking a RISK.

857
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:05,300
Didn't you say people could
never be friends after a break-up?

858
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:10,198
Correct. But this is a
break-up only for you.

859
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:11,938
For me it's..
- A challenge!

860
00:58:12,676 --> 00:58:14,007
''How can this happen to me?''

861
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:16,840
''I've even chosen our kids' names!''

862
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:18,072
Babies?

863
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:19,907
Nonsense!

864
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,747
I know the
responsibility of world population..

865
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:23,081
..lies on your delicate shoulders.

866
00:58:23,854 --> 00:58:24,946
We'll plant trees!

867
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,226
And now she walks away
to lead her secret life..

868
00:58:30,294 --> 00:58:31,659
..so don't forget your script!

869
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:37,291
Al..
- Don't.

870
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,635
Extra rent for babies and trees!

871
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:51,737
The ocean has
erased our footprints..

872
00:58:52,783 --> 00:59:01,714
..and a stray breeze
sprinkles nostalgia over me.

873
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,886
Strangeness is all around..

874
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,556
..it's raining moon and stars.

875
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:11,294
My neighbour's a strange girl..

876
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:16,205
My neighbour's a strange girl..

877
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:21,801
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

878
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:26,271
My neighbour's a strange girl..

879
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:31,686
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

880
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:40,921
This month's rent.

881
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:43,726
Have you seen your face?

882
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:45,893
Actually, no.

883
00:59:46,236 --> 00:59:47,294
You look like crap.

884
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:49,666
Nads, nothing you
say can make me feel..

885
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,139
She doesn't love you.

886
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:54,141
Round one to Nads.

887
00:59:56,213 --> 01:00:00,172
So we should love people
only till they love us back?

888
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:06,048
No, Nads. You can't marry him.

889
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:09,024
Nad's dude cheated on
her and since then..

890
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:10,150
Butt out, Cy!

891
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:13,559
Just take it.

892
01:00:14,998 --> 01:00:17,330
Just get some real clothes.

893
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:23,564
She really likes you, bro,
'cos she never refuses money!

894
01:00:23,774 --> 01:00:26,242
She loves money.
- Our dead parents' money.

895
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,607
And I own half of it.

896
01:00:27,678 --> 01:00:29,646
You will, once you get
out of this beer can..

897
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,178
So how long were you
guys together for?

898
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:35,009
Ten years.

899
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:38,851
Ten! One girl! One girl! Disgusting!

900
01:00:44,995 --> 01:00:48,931
My neighbour's a strange girl..

901
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,096
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

902
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:58,931
My neighbour's a strange girl..

903
01:00:59,977 --> 01:01:04,038
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

904
01:01:05,215 --> 01:01:09,584
My life's in a strange phase..

905
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:14,756
..And teases in strange ways.

906
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:19,286
My life's in a strange phase..

907
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:24,765
..And teases in strange ways.

908
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:28,937
My neighbour's a strange girl.

909
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,204
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

910
01:01:35,045 --> 01:01:38,913
My neighbour's a strange girl.

911
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:44,114
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

912
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:48,891
My neighbour's a strange girl.

913
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:55,058
..with strange signs,
can't read her mind.

914
01:02:20,557 --> 01:02:21,649
Brother Javed.

915
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,758
What's the menu today?

916
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:25,856
Mutton curry and bread.

917
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,298
Very funny!

918
01:02:34,738 --> 01:02:35,830
Try some!

919
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,697
Come on. Come on.

920
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,648
Thanks.

921
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:28,916
Come on.

922
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:35,323
Hey.
- Hi.

923
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:48,869
Two.

924
01:03:49,212 --> 01:03:50,543
Thank you.

925
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:54,813
Hey.
- Hi.

926
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:56,113
Nads, want one?
- Sure.

927
01:04:05,595 --> 01:04:06,619
No.

928
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,981
Last month's debt, this and
the next two months' rent.

929
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,210
Slow down, Mr. Gates.

930
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:30,678
Thanks, guys.

931
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,714
Keep it!

932
01:04:33,924 --> 01:04:35,892
What? Enough of this shit!

933
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,956
Who made you the
decision maker on the rent?

934
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:39,560
Is he in love or are you?

935
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:40,789
It's business, Cy.

936
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:43,689
I keep the shack deposit.

937
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:45,694
The rest is the
start-up cost for you two.

938
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:47,694
Who two?

939
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,568
You two.

940
01:04:49,906 --> 01:04:51,237
That's your kitchen
area from tomorrow.

941
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:53,606
Your talent, your investment,
my place.

942
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,002
Cy's the manger.
Profit splits three ways.

943
01:04:56,646 --> 01:04:57,704
Deal?

944
01:04:58,181 --> 01:04:59,273
I need a beer.

945
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:01,648
I won't ask again. You in?

946
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:08,147
Yes. Yes.

947
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,323
Why are you doing it?

948
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,123
'Cos she loves money.

949
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,827
And she hates me.

950
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:21,204
This is not business, Nads.

951
01:05:22,906 --> 01:05:25,636
Someone should have a happy ending.

952
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:53,260
Congratulations.

953
01:05:59,743 --> 01:06:02,303
Hi.
- Aaliya Khan.

954
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,772
Yes?

955
01:06:04,814 --> 01:06:07,282
Daniel Trip. I'm the
casting director on a film.

956
01:06:07,684 --> 01:06:08,810
We need an Asian actor.

957
01:06:09,686 --> 01:06:10,710
And you're good.

958
01:06:11,087 --> 01:06:14,352
Auditions have begun
and are on for two weeks.

959
01:06:17,827 --> 01:06:20,193
Congratulations
for tonight. Call me!

960
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:27,064
Come on, girl, smile.

961
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:28,195
You gonna call him?

962
01:06:58,835 --> 01:07:00,769
Surprise!

963
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:03,630
Happy birthday, Al.

964
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:13,646
How can you forget
your own birthday?

965
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:15,048
It's called old age.

966
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:16,616
Your momma's old!

967
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,921
I love dirty talk in Hindi.

968
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,954
You guys baked me a cake? How sweet!

969
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,251
Aunty made it.

970
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,095
He's the cook, I'm the manager!
That's the deal.

971
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,326
Happy birthday to you!

972
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,294
Happy birthday to you!

973
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,764
Happy birthday, dear Aaliya!

974
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,238
Happy birthday to you!

975
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,046
Come on.

976
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:53,883
Hey! Stop it!

977
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:24,753
Good night, see you tomorrow.
- See you.

978
01:08:51,815 --> 01:08:52,907
Thanks.

979
01:08:55,285 --> 01:08:56,718
I completely forgot my birthday.

980
01:09:02,025 --> 01:09:03,083
You're welcome.

981
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:08,922
What's up?

982
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,759
Nothing.

983
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:14,165
Al, something's wrong.

984
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:21,041
I'm.. Nothing.

985
01:09:22,178 --> 01:09:23,270
Come on.

986
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:27,739
Abhay, can you forget
everything for five minutes?

987
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:30,713
We were never dating,
we never broke up..

988
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:32,685
..we're just Abhay
and Aaliya. Friends.

989
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:34,857
No expectations, no complications?

990
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:40,187
What happened?

991
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:42,730
I met a casting agent today..

992
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:44,024
..he's offered me a film.

993
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,590
It's big.
- That's great.

994
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:47,759
Oh, no.
- I know.

995
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:50,831
Your mom.. Most actors
don't get this chance.

996
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,268
And I don't know when I
would get such a chance again..

997
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:54,576
You're not sure
what's more important.

998
01:09:54,644 --> 01:09:55,702
Acting or your promise to your mom.

999
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:57,268
I'm a jackass!

1000
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:58,841
Why did I make that promise?

1001
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:00,241
I thought I am getting to do a play,

1002
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,716
Ayesha will never know
- it's perfect!

1003
01:10:02,986 --> 01:10:05,750
And now I get a damn International
film in Oz of all the places.

1004
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:07,816
This doesn't even happen in films.

1005
01:10:08,725 --> 01:10:09,817
What do I do now?

1006
01:10:12,562 --> 01:10:13,654
Speak, Gelato.

1007
01:10:14,831 --> 01:10:16,822
Follow the beat of your heart!
- Meaning?

1008
01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:23,071
Why are love and happiness
different things for people?

1009
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:29,607
You were right, you were my life.

1010
01:10:30,346 --> 01:10:31,870
Not that again..

1011
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:33,575
Hear me out, Al.

1012
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,016
I was insecure 'cos I didn't
know how someone could be..

1013
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:42,557
..so passionate about their dreams.

1014
01:10:44,093 --> 01:10:45,185
But I do now.

1015
01:10:47,263 --> 01:10:49,288
I stood between you and your dream.

1016
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:51,059
I made you choose.

1017
01:10:52,835 --> 01:10:53,961
That's not love.

1018
01:10:55,838 --> 01:10:56,930
That's selfishness.

1019
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:01,675
Aunty Ayesha will understand.

1020
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,139
Like me.

1021
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:16,150
I didn't celebrate
your admission, did I?

1022
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:18,658
Let's do it now.

1023
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:20,954
Let's get a beer.

1024
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:24,157
Actually..

1025
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:26,762
Let's celebrate you first.

1026
01:11:27,737 --> 01:11:28,829
Why?

1027
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:31,040
'Cos you found your dream, Gulati.

1028
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:33,599
For the first time
you look happy working.

1029
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:36,843
You always looked good in an apron!

1030
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:40,943
Did you tell your dad?

1031
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:47,784
I'm following the beat of my heart.

1032
01:11:49,525 --> 01:11:50,583
He'll understand too.

1033
01:11:53,997 --> 01:11:55,123
Chef Ramsay!

1034
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:11,071
I missed you.

1035
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,044
My only friend in the world!

1036
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:09,599
So the vixen is softening.

1037
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:11,031
She's bound to.

1038
01:13:11,107 --> 01:13:15,203
If a boy crosses seven seas to
woo her, any girl would melt!

1039
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:19,044
It's too loose!
- Get her some boobs!

1040
01:13:19,182 --> 01:13:20,672
When are you coming back?

1041
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,976
I don't know, Aunty.

1042
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:25,118
But I will return with Aaliya.

1043
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,719
No, Nads, we're just friends.

1044
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:29,618
Finally we are un-complicated.

1045
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,293
Love, relationships, hurt..

1046
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:33,888
..one should leave
these for old-age.

1047
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,089
It's too much.

1048
01:13:35,798 --> 01:13:37,231
Shut up, Cyrus.

1049
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:41,096
Actually, you're a genius.

1050
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:42,931
It's simple.

1051
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:44,939
Love was getting complicated,
so you broke up.

1052
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,735
Then you felt all alone..

1053
01:13:46,876 --> 01:13:48,673
..and became friends again.
Perfect! - Exactly.

1054
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:50,940
And Abhay thinks he's..
- An ATM machine.

1055
01:13:51,581 --> 01:13:53,572
He gets no deposits, you
get to make withdrawals..

1056
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:56,908
..of his heart, mind or time..

1057
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,280
And the best part?

1058
01:13:58,888 --> 01:14:00,082
Machines don't expect anything back.

1059
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:03,052
You're being sarcastic, right?

1060
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,151
And this is why you're a genius.

1061
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:12,164
''I love you.''

1062
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:17,135
''It's so difficult to
spend days and nights.''

1063
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:20,767
''There's just one thing
I want to say to you.''

1064
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:22,743
She's smoking!

1065
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,147
Gulati wanted to marry
her when he grew up.

1066
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:29,579
I was ten, guys.

1067
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:32,581
Hey, are you coming on
the 10th for my graduation?

1068
01:14:33,623 --> 01:14:35,921
Okay, good news! My new restaurant..

1069
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,118
Our restaurant!

1070
01:14:37,994 --> 01:14:40,588
Our new restaurant
has found an investor!

1071
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:44,298
Bad news! Meeting's on the 10th.
- Gulati.

1072
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,967
Didn't tell you 'cos I
knew you'd freak out!

1073
01:14:47,203 --> 01:14:50,104
Don't friends fit
into your plans anymore?

1074
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,573
Not fair!

1075
01:14:52,975 --> 01:14:54,704
You used to make
time for me earlier.

1076
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:56,069
Not fair!

1077
01:14:58,981 --> 01:15:00,346
Yes, I've packed the pickles.

1078
01:15:00,616 --> 01:15:02,083
Hang up and save your money.

1079
01:15:02,251 --> 01:15:04,651
You're arrivingjust a
day before my graduation.

1080
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,880
Abhay and Cyrus have a meeting.

1081
01:15:05,955 --> 01:15:07,286
Nadia has to manage the Shack.

1082
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,052
Nobody loves me.

1083
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:11,587
Why couldn't you come earlier?

1084
01:15:12,895 --> 01:15:14,192
I need to discuss
an important thing.

1085
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:15,722
What happened?

1086
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:18,096
We'll talk face to face.

1087
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:23,130
It's kind of big.

1088
01:15:23,206 --> 01:15:26,107
Your ''big'' is usually a ''big bomb''.

1089
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:28,267
You know I don't like surprises.

1090
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:29,803
But..
- Aaliya Khan.

1091
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:31,204
Just a second.

1092
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:32,873
Gotta run, ma. Bye.

1093
01:15:37,019 --> 01:15:39,010
Nervous?
- Not at all.

1094
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:40,917
Good, 'cos you can nail it.

1095
01:15:42,024 --> 01:15:43,787
That's what I'm nervous about.

1096
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,893
And now we've reached the
end of another academic year

1097
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:52,964
Congratulations, class of 2009.
You are all now graduates.

1098
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:58,596
That's it Ayesha. No more courses.

1099
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,103
I'm fed up of studying.

1100
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:02,107
Thank God!

1101
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:06,672
So what's your big surprise?

1102
01:16:07,116 --> 01:16:08,777
You've kept me in
suspense since yesterday.

1103
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:11,613
Yes, I..

1104
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:15,783
Gulati!

1105
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:21,856
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1106
01:16:23,766 --> 01:16:24,824
Have you told her yet?

1107
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:26,093
I'm shitting bricks!

1108
01:16:26,802 --> 01:16:27,860
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1109
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:30,332
You know how she is.. -Yes.

1110
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,669
Don't give her less
credit than she deserves.

1111
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,102
Hey..

1112
01:16:36,212 --> 01:16:37,270
''I'll be right
here waiting for you!''

1113
01:16:38,948 --> 01:16:40,779
Chill! It's just an offer..

1114
01:16:41,183 --> 01:16:42,741
..it's not like
you've signed a contract.

1115
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:48,688
Al..!
- So that's your big surprise.

1116
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,251
Congratulations, aunty.

1117
01:16:50,626 --> 01:16:52,025
Congratulations to you too.

1118
01:16:52,728 --> 01:16:56,926
I'm happier about this
than your graduation.

1119
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:00,135
I knew it. This
break-up wouldn't last long.

1120
01:17:00,202 --> 01:17:01,328
But how did this happen?

1121
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:04,135
And please don't
take an eternity again..

1122
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:05,867
..get married soon.

1123
01:17:07,944 --> 01:17:10,879
Marriage? Where did that come from?

1124
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,009
Even Abhay's managed to move on.

1125
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,142
Aaliya.

1126
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:18,085
Abhay, tell her that
we're just friends.

1127
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,280
We're just friends.

1128
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:22,783
Gelato, are you..?

1129
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:25,719
We're just friends.

1130
01:17:29,098 --> 01:17:31,760
So what was your news?

1131
01:17:33,302 --> 01:17:34,633
What was the surprise?

1132
01:17:37,673 --> 01:17:38,799
Mother, I..

1133
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:45,977
Promises, commitments, feelings..

1134
01:17:46,282 --> 01:17:48,648
..these things mean nothing to you.

1135
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:51,845
Don't pretend to ask after
you've signed the contract.

1136
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:55,948
I don't mind your having dreams..

1137
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:03,257
..but I mind that our feelings are
nothing but hurdles in your path.

1138
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:07,795
People don't love you
because you're special Aaliya.

1139
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,805
You're special because a few people
in this world love you immensely.

1140
01:18:13,075 --> 01:18:15,202
Sometimes, despite the way you are.

1141
01:18:16,212 --> 01:18:19,841
And today you proved
how foolish they are!

1142
01:18:40,236 --> 01:18:41,635
I didn't want this.

1143
01:18:43,873 --> 01:18:45,306
I just..
- You can't expect everything..

1144
01:18:46,108 --> 01:18:47,666
.. and not expect to get hurt.

1145
01:18:50,713 --> 01:18:51,771
I'm sorry.

1146
01:18:54,183 --> 01:18:55,741
I didn't want to hurt you.

1147
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:03,692
When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.

1148
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,052
I didn't believe you.

1149
01:19:08,097 --> 01:19:09,257
That was my fault.

1150
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:11,631
You did move on.

1151
01:19:13,803 --> 01:19:14,929
You're lucky you can.

1152
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:23,745
Goodbye!
- Gulati?

1153
01:19:24,647 --> 01:19:25,705
I'm off.

1154
01:19:43,299 --> 01:19:48,601
Rain.. It will wash it all away.

1155
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:55,602
Lit up, you'll see it,
a whole new way.

1156
01:19:56,145 --> 01:20:02,709
Slowly, yesterday will ebb away..

1157
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:10,753
Slowly, making way for a new day.

1158
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:14,754
Like a roof of sunlight..

1159
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:18,061
Like a slip-sliding road..

1160
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:23,094
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1161
01:20:24,974 --> 01:20:28,910
Like a roof of sunlight..

1162
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:32,311
Like a slip-sliding road..

1163
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,574
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1164
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:40,611
''If you believe, sun is shining,
love is lighting your way.''

1165
01:20:55,538 --> 01:20:58,234
I'm sorry. And
thanks for everything.

1166
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:12,949
Drops of realisation
trickle down on me..

1167
01:21:14,857 --> 01:21:20,318
I'm haunted by a
thirst from before..

1168
01:21:21,564 --> 01:21:28,026
But I see new clouds dancing above..

1169
01:21:28,904 --> 01:21:35,275
..kissing my forehead,
with drops of love.

1170
01:21:35,878 --> 01:21:39,211
Letting go.. it is time, I know.

1171
01:21:39,582 --> 01:21:42,779
Seasons have changed in a burst.

1172
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:48,718
I take a small step,
perhaps my first.

1173
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:53,587
Like a roof of sunlight..

1174
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:56,961
Like a slip-sliding road..

1175
01:21:57,132 --> 01:22:02,764
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1176
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:10,271
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1177
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:13,574
I didn't choose my dream, ma..

1178
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,910
..it chose me.

1179
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:19,211
But I will not lose you for it.

1180
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:22,855
I will walk towards but
only with you beside me..

1181
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:25,723
And if you aren't
ready to stand by my side..

1182
01:22:25,794 --> 01:22:26,852
..then I'll wait.

1183
01:22:28,297 --> 01:22:29,696
But I won't do this without you.

1184
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,931
I won't leave you alone like dad.

1185
01:22:37,573 --> 01:22:38,767
I am so sorry, Aaliya.

1186
01:22:40,576 --> 01:22:42,203
Your dream wasn't wrong, dear.

1187
01:22:43,512 --> 01:22:47,710
Your means were callous.

1188
01:23:03,666 --> 01:23:07,102
How much dough do you need
for the kitchen expansion?

1189
01:23:07,169 --> 01:23:09,535
Wow, did we make a profit?
- Buzz off.

1190
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:10,997
Nice.

1191
01:23:11,173 --> 01:23:12,902
Now Cyrus will go on a holiday..

1192
01:23:12,975 --> 01:23:15,773
.. after which you
will expand the kitchen.

1193
01:23:15,844 --> 01:23:17,175
No one will touch this money.

1194
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,640
We're going to
open a new restaurant.

1195
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:22,742
The Investors loved
our restaurant plan.

1196
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:23,876
The paperwork will be done tomorrow.

1197
01:23:23,952 --> 01:23:26,147
Are you serious? We got funding?

1198
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:29,156
Does that mean I can now..
- No, Cy.

1199
01:23:29,325 --> 01:23:30,758
I hate you guys.

1200
01:23:38,267 --> 01:23:39,894
Absolutely.

1201
01:23:39,968 --> 01:23:41,936
It was my idea to open an
Indian restaurant. - Hi, Cy.

1202
01:23:42,004 --> 01:23:44,097
Here is my partner. Gelato Gulati.

1203
01:23:44,173 --> 01:23:46,198
Congratulations, man!

1204
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:48,209
Houseful on the first
day itself. - Thanks, man.

1205
01:23:48,277 --> 01:23:49,608
No free drinks.

1206
01:24:00,689 --> 01:24:02,122
Abhay.

1207
01:24:06,795 --> 01:24:07,887
Nice place.

1208
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:14,226
Abhay, had I known
you're so talented..

1209
01:24:14,837 --> 01:24:17,829
..I'd have thrown you out years ago.

1210
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:21,768
I'm sorry, Papa.

1211
01:24:23,112 --> 01:24:28,982
I didn't tell you earlier
'cos even I didn't know..

1212
01:24:30,185 --> 01:24:34,918
Abhay, my dream wasn't that
you'll learn to manage my theatre..

1213
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:38,149
..but that you'll
learn to manage your life.

1214
01:24:39,328 --> 01:24:40,625
My dream's come true.

1215
01:24:44,133 --> 01:24:45,600
You're finally on your feet..

1216
01:24:47,569 --> 01:24:48,763
..earning as well.

1217
01:24:49,772 --> 01:24:52,240
So you and Aaliya..

1218
01:24:52,307 --> 01:24:53,604
No, Papa.

1219
01:24:54,777 --> 01:24:56,005
We won't discuss that.

1220
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:58,738
That topic is closed, please.

1221
01:24:59,915 --> 01:25:02,782
Fine, let's talk
about something else.

1222
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,947
Why.. don't you get married?

1223
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:14,223
She's cute.

1224
01:25:14,296 --> 01:25:16,787
And she'll turn eighteen soon.

1225
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:23,330
Happiness hung from
a branch so elusive..

1226
01:25:25,274 --> 01:25:30,712
..but I leaped and
caught its fragrance.

1227
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:38,217
So fragile, but we
inevitably slipped..

1228
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:45,284
..but I will heal, I
will rewrite my script!

1229
01:25:46,328 --> 01:25:53,234
I can see the shore,
I see the light..

1230
01:25:53,602 --> 01:25:58,938
..new stars wink at me from the sky!

1231
01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:05,940
The flight's day after tomorrow.

1232
01:26:06,315 --> 01:26:07,782
Next Monday flight to Gold Coast.

1233
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:15,086
By the time I realized
that my parents are right..

1234
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:22,186
..my own daughter was standing in
front of me telling me I was wrong!

1235
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:29,327
I was trying to protect you from
making the mistakes I had made.

1236
01:26:31,206 --> 01:26:35,267
But I forgot.. you're not like me.

1237
01:26:36,845 --> 01:26:37,869
You're much stronger.

1238
01:26:41,049 --> 01:26:42,311
Still have a knack for dialogues!

1239
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:44,110
Why'd you quit acting?

1240
01:26:46,588 --> 01:26:47,748
Go back, Aaliya.

1241
01:26:48,056 --> 01:26:49,148
Follow your heart.

1242
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:57,096
Like a roof of sunlight..

1243
01:26:57,165 --> 01:27:00,692
Like a slip-sliding road..

1244
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:05,866
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1245
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,177
Like a roof of sunlight..

1246
01:27:11,246 --> 01:27:14,807
Like a slip-sliding road..

1247
01:27:14,883 --> 01:27:20,082
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1248
01:27:21,857 --> 01:27:25,315
Like a roof of sunlight..

1249
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:28,961
Like a slip-sliding road..

1250
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:33,900
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1251
01:27:36,004 --> 01:27:39,531
Like a roof of sunlight..

1252
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:42,975
Like a slip-sliding road..

1253
01:27:43,045 --> 01:27:47,744
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1254
01:27:50,052 --> 01:27:53,647
Like a roof of sunlight..

1255
01:27:53,722 --> 01:27:57,123
Like a slip-sliding road..

1256
01:27:57,192 --> 01:28:03,791
This is but a
gentle detour on my way.

1257
01:28:19,681 --> 01:28:20,773
Come on, Aunt Pammi.

1258
01:28:21,283 --> 01:28:23,717
You know I'm not
interested in marriage.

1259
01:28:24,252 --> 01:28:25,913
So why should I meet any more girls?

1260
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:27,615
'Cos that's the only way!

1261
01:28:27,889 --> 01:28:32,155
Just meet them, then say 'no'!

1262
01:28:32,828 --> 01:28:33,920
Oh, please..

1263
01:28:34,696 --> 01:28:35,822
Is this seat taken?

1264
01:28:36,898 --> 01:28:37,922
Are you meeting a girl?

1265
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,031
A beautiful babe.

1266
01:28:40,268 --> 01:28:42,168
Can I go now?
- Don't ever call me that.

1267
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:45,129
She sounds like a vixen too.

1268
01:28:46,008 --> 01:28:47,066
Bye aunty!

1269
01:28:47,275 --> 01:28:50,142
I can't believe the
restaurant's completed a year.

1270
01:28:50,679 --> 01:28:53,011
Happy anniversary.
- Yes, whatever.

1271
01:28:53,882 --> 01:28:56,646
Everything began in
this shack. Thanks..

1272
01:28:56,985 --> 01:28:59,783
I owe you guys everything, or I'd
still be rotting at the taxi stand..

1273
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:01,948
..and Cyrus would be
rotting in a beer can.

1274
01:29:02,624 --> 01:29:03,682
We're even!

1275
01:29:03,725 --> 01:29:05,693
No one owes shit!

1276
01:29:05,961 --> 01:29:07,053
A toast..!

1277
01:29:10,065 --> 01:29:11,191
To Cyrus..!

1278
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,994
Who achieved nothing
in life, till today!

1279
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:18,035
This restaurant is my first..
- And sole!

1280
01:29:19,074 --> 01:29:21,235
And soul milestone.

1281
01:29:21,777 --> 01:29:23,005
Well done, Cyrus.

1282
01:29:23,245 --> 01:29:24,337
Cheers!

1283
01:29:26,948 --> 01:29:28,074
What's a 'soul'?

1284
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:31,013
What you can only hope for.

1285
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:42,896
Surprise!
- Surprise!

1286
01:29:43,632 --> 01:29:44,997
She's shooting a film here.

1287
01:29:45,634 --> 01:29:46,726
Aunty Ayesha agreed.

1288
01:29:50,605 --> 01:29:52,300
Why dredge up what's over..
- Just a minute.

1289
01:29:52,841 --> 01:29:54,706
Have you been on a single
date after your break-up?

1290
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:00,246
This isn't over yet.

1291
01:30:02,084 --> 01:30:03,176
Hi.

1292
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:04,712
Hey.

1293
01:30:10,192 --> 01:30:13,059
I told Nads that maybe I
shouldn't.. - It's fine.

1294
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:19,125
How are you?

1295
01:30:20,135 --> 01:30:21,193
I'm good.

1296
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,132
Thank you.

1297
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,605
Let's end this awkwardness,
I'm not good at it.

1298
01:30:33,648 --> 01:30:36,048
I just came to say..
- Al, it's fine.

1299
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:37,210
No, let me say it.

1300
01:30:37,285 --> 01:30:38,912
I just came to say that..
- Al, chill.

1301
01:30:39,654 --> 01:30:40,712
I'm glad you're here.

1302
01:30:40,789 --> 01:30:41,881
Gulati, I need to say this!

1303
01:30:42,224 --> 01:30:44,590
I just want to say that
I'm really happy for you..

1304
01:30:44,659 --> 01:30:46,149
I'm very proud of you and..

1305
01:30:48,663 --> 01:30:49,755
..I'm sorry.

1306
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:53,996
I'm really very sorry.

1307
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:56,765
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1308
01:30:59,674 --> 01:31:01,039
So how many
restaurants do you own now?

1309
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:02,736
Two and a half!

1310
01:31:03,545 --> 01:31:05,672
Two in Gold Coast and
one in papa's theatre.

1311
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:08,006
Wow!

1312
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,912
So you finally told him.

1313
01:31:10,819 --> 01:31:12,047
He must be so proud of you.

1314
01:31:14,589 --> 01:31:17,581
Last year's been so hectic..
- One year and forty days!

1315
01:31:19,728 --> 01:31:20,956
When did your memory improve?

1316
01:31:21,263 --> 01:31:23,629
I remember everything.
- Really?

1317
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:26,828
I was thinking on the flight..

1318
01:31:27,235 --> 01:31:29,999
..when we first met in class..
- In the theatre.

1319
01:31:30,338 --> 01:31:33,739
Who would've imagined that we
would kiss while watching DDLJ

1320
01:31:33,809 --> 01:31:34,867
Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

1321
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:36,308
And then date for eight years.

1322
01:31:36,645 --> 01:31:37,703
Eight years and nine months.

1323
01:31:37,879 --> 01:31:40,677
Thanks for shitting on my nostalgia!

1324
01:31:42,184 --> 01:31:43,845
We were watching Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

1325
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:46,984
In fact, for the third time.

1326
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,748
We had memorized the dialogues..

1327
01:31:49,825 --> 01:31:51,884
..but you were saying
them with all your heart.

1328
01:31:52,694 --> 01:31:54,252
While Shahrukh's
monologues kept going..

1329
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:57,129
.. your horrific
impersonation got scarier.

1330
01:32:00,001 --> 01:32:01,935
I had a thumping headache!

1331
01:32:02,804 --> 01:32:04,669
But I kept saying them dialogues..

1332
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:08,140
..so you wouldn't notice
that I was only watching you!

1333
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:12,177
And your perfume
was driving me wild.

1334
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:15,845
Maybe that caused the headache.

1335
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:18,650
I think it was Lily.

1336
01:32:20,255 --> 01:32:22,587
To end your blabbering,
I suggested going home..

1337
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:24,147
..and watching some
more Shahrukh films.

1338
01:32:25,894 --> 01:32:27,225
And something happened to you.

1339
01:32:29,664 --> 01:32:32,292
You just leaned over
and kissed me, and said..

1340
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:37,569
'No one I know has
endured so much pain for me!'

1341
01:32:44,813 --> 01:32:45,905
Lavender!

1342
01:32:47,582 --> 01:32:48,947
The perfume was lavender.

1343
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:56,713
Nice place, Gulati.

1344
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,861
If you hadn't come here I'd
still be decaying in Delhi!

1345
01:33:02,097 --> 01:33:03,792
I would've never dared to step out.

1346
01:33:05,567 --> 01:33:07,091
So.. thank you.

1347
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:11,996
I came here to look for you..
and found myself.

1348
01:33:13,141 --> 01:33:14,267
Say that dialogue again!

1349
01:33:21,149 --> 01:33:23,310
Seeing anyone?
- Yes.

1350
01:33:24,019 --> 01:33:25,281
Mr. Kunzru's daughter.

1351
01:33:26,087 --> 01:33:27,952
Mr. Agarwal's niece from New York.

1352
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:30,555
Mrs. Srivastav's
''almost legal'' niece.

1353
01:33:31,593 --> 01:33:34,153
Preeti's gynecologist's
neighbor's step-daughter..

1354
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:36,891
..who is also a gynecologist.

1355
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:38,690
And both daughters of Mr. Wanchoo!

1356
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:41,827
Don't ask, Al.

1357
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:44,231
I'm going to India
tomorrow for Preeti's baby shower.

1358
01:33:44,606 --> 01:33:47,040
They're going to pounce on me
like a pack of hungry wolves!

1359
01:33:47,242 --> 01:33:49,039
Preeti's preggers?
- Don't start.

1360
01:33:49,644 --> 01:33:53,705
No. That's.. great!

1361
01:33:57,886 --> 01:33:58,978
What happened?

1362
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:03,748
Don't resist it, Gulati.

1363
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,086
Resist what?

1364
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:07,753
Marriage.

1365
01:34:08,797 --> 01:34:10,662
Any girl would be
lucky to get your love.

1366
01:34:14,602 --> 01:34:15,694
And you?

1367
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:18,062
Are you happy?

1368
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:21,766
I am learning to be 'happy'.

1369
01:34:27,015 --> 01:34:28,607
You got what you wanted.

1370
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:31,176
Yes, but..

1371
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:34,956
Breaking things comes
easily to me, Gulati.

1372
01:34:37,792 --> 01:34:39,225
I nearly lost my mom as well.

1373
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:43,754
All my life I
wanted to be like her..

1374
01:34:44,866 --> 01:34:46,197
..but turned out
exactly like my dad!

1375
01:34:50,205 --> 01:34:51,638
I even broke us!

1376
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:01,648
Maybe.. I'm not meant for love.

1377
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,274
'I don't want to deal
with your problems, Abhay.'

1378
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:30,904
'This is it, I'm
breaking up with you.'

1379
01:35:31,379 --> 01:35:33,176
'Ayesha, even Abhay
has managed to move on.'

1380
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:37,941
' When we broke up, I refused
to accept it as a possibility.'

1381
01:35:39,587 --> 01:35:42,988
'I didn't believe you.
That was my mistake.'

1382
01:35:44,926 --> 01:35:46,223
'Don't resist it, Gulati.'

1383
01:35:46,995 --> 01:35:49,190
'Resist what?
- Marriage.'

1384
01:35:50,131 --> 01:35:52,031
'Breaking things comes easily to me.

1385
01:35:53,068 --> 01:35:54,228
'I even broke us.'

1386
01:35:55,336 --> 01:35:56,826
'Maybe I'm not meant for love.'

1387
01:36:08,049 --> 01:36:09,744
I thought that I understood love.

1388
01:36:12,687 --> 01:36:13,779
But now..

1389
01:36:17,025 --> 01:36:18,151
I don't know anything.

1390
01:36:30,905 --> 01:36:32,065
I don't know what love is.

1391
01:36:37,779 --> 01:36:39,713
If you don't take
her off your wall..

1392
01:36:40,081 --> 01:36:41,708
..how will you get
her out of your heart?

1393
01:36:43,685 --> 01:36:46,313
The girl you eventually marry..
- I can't fall in love again!

1394
01:36:47,689 --> 01:36:54,185
These damn Bollywood remakes of
Devdas have ruined children's minds!

1395
01:36:54,896 --> 01:36:56,864
'Alas! She dumped me!'

1396
01:36:57,298 --> 01:37:01,166
'I dedicate my life to
scuba diving in cheap whiskey!'

1397
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:03,967
Nothing sexy about that guy!

1398
01:37:05,073 --> 01:37:07,667
Aunty, I am not like you.
- That's the problem.

1399
01:37:11,179 --> 01:37:15,013
What if one was to leap from here?

1400
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:20,110
They'd risk a few fractures,
brain hemorrhage and..

1401
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:21,951
And that's the
difference between you and me,

1402
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:24,284
I married thrice.

1403
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:27,220
I broke my head,
suffered fractures..

1404
01:37:27,662 --> 01:37:29,687
..survived brain hemorrhage as well.

1405
01:37:30,832 --> 01:37:34,199
And I'm ready to leap again!

1406
01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:35,734
Why?

1407
01:37:36,004 --> 01:37:38,268
Because no matter how much it hurt..

1408
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,870
..I never let myself be scared.

1409
01:37:41,709 --> 01:37:43,643
You have to be fearless, Abhay.

1410
01:37:44,879 --> 01:37:48,610
Or you'll end up sharing other's
happiness, in their weddings.

1411
01:37:50,251 --> 01:37:52,651
Love is inside you, dear.

1412
01:37:53,221 --> 01:37:55,917
Take your heart out of it's
shock-proof padding..

1413
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,855
..and let it do it's job!

1414
01:37:58,593 --> 01:38:01,721
These tiny shocks can't hurt it!

1415
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:04,725
And if you wanted to play so safe..

1416
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,895
..why'd you fall in
love even the first time?

1417
01:38:10,705 --> 01:38:11,831
You kids..

1418
01:38:12,006 --> 01:38:16,204
..you can't want everything and
expect to not get a little hurt!

1419
01:38:37,865 --> 01:38:43,531
''It's drizzling in my thoughts..
Everything will be washed.''

1420
01:38:44,906 --> 01:38:50,003
''There will be a new ray of hope.''

1421
01:38:50,678 --> 01:38:57,049
''All the painful
memories will flow away.''

1422
01:38:57,685 --> 01:39:05,251
''There will be a new destination.
Let's go.''

1423
01:39:11,165 --> 01:39:12,996
Papa.
- Yes?

1424
01:39:14,302 --> 01:39:15,564
What?

1425
01:39:16,037 --> 01:39:17,265
Have you lost it?

1426
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,264
Cy, keep it down.
You're on a film set!

1427
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:21,072
What about me and our business?

1428
01:39:21,309 --> 01:39:23,834
We're discussing two more
restaurants with the investors.

1429
01:39:24,012 --> 01:39:26,276
I can't believe I'm
the responsible one here.

1430
01:39:26,614 --> 01:39:28,104
I get to behave like this, not you.

1431
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,708
Abhay's getting married.

1432
01:39:30,018 --> 01:39:31,076
What?

1433
01:39:33,721 --> 01:39:34,847
Wow.

1434
01:39:35,323 --> 01:39:37,052
'Wow'? That's it?

1435
01:39:37,125 --> 01:39:39,753
I can't buy my Porsche 'cos of you.

1436
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:41,660
Yeah, whatever.

1437
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:45,188
Congratulations.. loser!

1438
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,034
He told you first?

1439
01:39:49,737 --> 01:39:50,931
He didn't even call me.

1440
01:39:51,205 --> 01:39:53,298
And you're upset about that?

1441
01:39:54,842 --> 01:40:00,246
Yes, I told him to get married,
but.. he didn't tell me?

1442
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,724
Why's he not answering?

1443
01:40:12,327 --> 01:40:13,624
Chicks are weird.

1444
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:18,189
I hope the girl's a
voluptuous North Indian babe!

1445
01:40:18,566 --> 01:40:21,296
Not Abhay's type.
- Cy was talking about himself.

1446
01:40:21,936 --> 01:40:24,666
I can't believe he's getting
married. - And he didn't tell me!

1447
01:40:24,739 --> 01:40:27,105
Why? After all he's just marrying!

1448
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:28,708
But, Ayesha, he didn't even tell me.

1449
01:40:28,876 --> 01:40:31,106
He will tell you. He must be busy.

1450
01:40:31,713 --> 01:40:32,805
Why?

1451
01:40:33,881 --> 01:40:35,348
What's the point in worrying now?

1452
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:37,081
I'm not worried.

1453
01:40:37,352 --> 01:40:38,546
I'm happy for him.

1454
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,948
But he could've called me.

1455
01:40:40,688 --> 01:40:42,087
But you broke up with him.

1456
01:40:42,223 --> 01:40:44,123
So?
- So he's moved on.

1457
01:40:44,559 --> 01:40:46,026
Not to another planet.

1458
01:40:47,662 --> 01:40:48,754
What the hell..!

1459
01:40:56,304 --> 01:40:58,738
Are you alright?
- Yes.

1460
01:40:58,873 --> 01:41:00,204
Are you sure?
- Are you deaf?

1461
01:41:00,742 --> 01:41:02,539
No, just rich and single.

1462
01:41:02,677 --> 01:41:03,769
Al..

1463
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:05,278
I'm fine, okay!

1464
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:06,945
No, you're in love with Abhay.

1465
01:41:18,793 --> 01:41:21,694
Ladies and gentleman, the
flight from Gold Coast to Delhi..

1466
01:41:21,763 --> 01:41:23,025
..will be now ready for boarding.

1467
01:41:23,097 --> 01:41:24,155
What will you do after going there?

1468
01:41:24,232 --> 01:41:25,324
I don't know.

1469
01:41:25,733 --> 01:41:27,257
You broke up with him.
- I know.

1470
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:29,760
You think..
- I don't know.

1471
01:41:30,271 --> 01:41:32,865
Isn't it a little too late?
- No.

1472
01:41:34,909 --> 01:41:36,706
Maybe. I don't know.

1473
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:37,935
Just shut up.

1474
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:40,612
Chicks are weird.

1475
01:41:43,551 --> 01:41:45,178
Aaliya, please relax.

1476
01:41:45,553 --> 01:41:46,781
He's not answering his phone.

1477
01:41:46,854 --> 01:41:48,845
Obviously, he's
getting married today.

1478
01:41:49,056 --> 01:41:51,115
Did you try his residence number?

1479
01:42:01,736 --> 01:42:04,204
So loose?

1480
01:42:04,772 --> 01:42:06,137
Is this a blouse or a jacket?

1481
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,168
I'm very high.

1482
01:42:12,246 --> 01:42:13,907
Mummy, butter chicken!

1483
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:15,846
Why're there such few lights?

1484
01:42:15,917 --> 01:42:17,179
I've put three thousand already.

1485
01:42:17,251 --> 01:42:19,651
So double that! Where's Abhay?

1486
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,914
There's no place left.

1487
01:42:21,055 --> 01:42:22,613
Put them up on my head.

1488
01:42:23,658 --> 01:42:25,853
Pick up, Pick up.. please pick up.

1489
01:42:26,327 --> 01:42:28,557
They must've booked the
honeymoon suite by now.

1490
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:36,662
Goal!

1491
01:42:38,039 --> 01:42:40,166
Hi, Aaliya.
- Isn't that Abhay's ex?

1492
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:41,503
Shh.. quiet!

1493
01:42:44,912 --> 01:42:46,038
Aaliya?

1494
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:50,608
Uncle, where's Abhay?

1495
01:42:50,685 --> 01:42:51,777
He must be upstairs..

1496
01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:56,121
The vixen cometh!
- Where's Abhay?

1497
01:42:56,624 --> 01:42:58,854
Counting the last
moments of bliss in his room.

1498
01:43:01,229 --> 01:43:02,526
Aaliya..!

1499
01:43:05,066 --> 01:43:06,158
What are you doing?

1500
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:07,531
Look at this!

1501
01:43:08,035 --> 01:43:09,127
What did I tell you?

1502
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:10,935
But it isn't shiny, sir.

1503
01:43:11,005 --> 01:43:12,734
No, it's a damn tubelight.
- What?

1504
01:43:13,574 --> 01:43:14,700
Leave it.

1505
01:43:14,775 --> 01:43:15,833
But, ma'am, the wedding..

1506
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,968
Drop it..

1507
01:43:17,044 --> 01:43:18,272
..or should I use
your scissors on you?

1508
01:43:21,949 --> 01:43:23,007
Abhay, listen..

1509
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:26,582
God, I look like shit!

1510
01:43:26,787 --> 01:43:27,913
So do I.

1511
01:43:34,695 --> 01:43:36,128
Al..
- Shhh!

1512
01:43:41,602 --> 01:43:42,660
Abhay Gulati.

1513
01:43:43,771 --> 01:43:44,829
I love you.

1514
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:48,536
Your grandma gave you this ring..

1515
01:43:48,609 --> 01:43:49,837
..for your wife.

1516
01:43:50,611 --> 01:43:52,135
For years it was meant for me.

1517
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:54,840
And I ruined it with
much effort and diligence..

1518
01:43:54,916 --> 01:43:56,042
..with a little help from you.

1519
01:43:56,117 --> 01:43:57,744
But that's a minor technicality.

1520
01:43:57,818 --> 01:43:59,149
You were lost, I was immature..

1521
01:43:59,687 --> 01:44:00,813
But the point is that..

1522
01:44:00,888 --> 01:44:04,688
..the girl you're going to marry must
be a intelligent, mature person..

1523
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:06,624
She has to be, 'cos
she's marrying you.

1524
01:44:06,894 --> 01:44:08,919
And I'm a crazy,
immature, stupid, fool..

1525
01:44:09,163 --> 01:44:10,721
..I have to be, for losing you.

1526
01:44:10,865 --> 01:44:13,197
But I've always loved
you and I always will..

1527
01:44:13,267 --> 01:44:15,201
..even if marry this girl,
who you don't even know.

1528
01:44:15,269 --> 01:44:16,634
But anyway the point is..

1529
01:44:16,938 --> 01:44:20,237
..even for a second, if you
still think you have a choice..

1530
01:44:23,044 --> 01:44:24,102
..then please..

1531
01:44:25,246 --> 01:44:26,543
..choose me.

1532
01:44:27,982 --> 01:44:29,074
Please.

1533
01:44:31,686 --> 01:44:32,812
Why?

1534
01:44:34,589 --> 01:44:37,319
'Cos you haven't watched Mr.
India twenty times with that girl.

1535
01:44:37,592 --> 01:44:40,026
She doesn't know how awfully you
bray when you sing in the loo.

1536
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,857
How you know the name of every
kid on every traffic signal..

1537
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,261
..even though they think you're '

1538
01:44:44,632 --> 01:44:47,123
And.. I don't have any other reason.

1539
01:44:50,938 --> 01:44:52,132
I've made up my mind, Al.

1540
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:57,204
Is this marriage or vengeance?

1541
01:44:59,347 --> 01:45:01,042
We spent almost ten years together..

1542
01:45:03,751 --> 01:45:06,652
And were friends for
ten years before that!

1543
01:45:07,054 --> 01:45:08,146
Exactly.

1544
01:45:08,889 --> 01:45:09,947
Really?

1545
01:45:10,758 --> 01:45:13,318
Just because I turned
out to be a total moron..

1546
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:16,222
..you'll marry any random girl?

1547
01:45:16,297 --> 01:45:17,594
She's not random.

1548
01:45:17,665 --> 01:45:19,030
Yes, she is. Who is this..

1549
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:21,225
..Aaliya?

1550
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:25,902
You're marrying me?

1551
01:45:27,074 --> 01:45:28,132
It's a typo!

1552
01:45:28,843 --> 01:45:30,640
No, look! It says 'Aaliya'..

1553
01:45:30,878 --> 01:45:32,004
Al..!

1554
01:45:33,981 --> 01:45:36,040
I don't need a reason to marry you.

1555
01:45:37,652 --> 01:45:40,780
I promised you no matter how..

1556
01:45:40,988 --> 01:45:45,550
..stupid, immature, mind-blowingly
moronically you behave..

1557
01:45:47,628 --> 01:45:48,925
..I won't let go.

1558
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,098
How could the one who
pushed me to be brave..

1559
01:45:55,002 --> 01:45:56,128
..boldly took risks..

1560
01:45:57,571 --> 01:45:59,300
..was the 'star in her own life'..

1561
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,937
..be afraid of herself today?

1562
01:46:06,347 --> 01:46:07,974
You taught me to be fearless, Al.

1563
01:46:09,183 --> 01:46:10,650
You can't give up!

1564
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:12,683
You made us stronger.

1565
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:17,648
And you're not like your dad..

1566
01:46:18,592 --> 01:46:19,854
.. or you wouldn't be here today.

1567
01:46:22,129 --> 01:46:23,619
You are meant for love!

1568
01:46:34,175 --> 01:46:35,301
By the way..

1569
01:46:36,343 --> 01:46:39,073
..the 'Thread
Maintenance Department' has quit!

1570
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:43,744
I'm into spinning tops now.

1571
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:45,778
The suckers stay on the ground!

1572
01:46:53,127 --> 01:46:54,185
Are you sure?

1573
01:46:54,261 --> 01:46:55,990
Al.

1574
01:46:56,197 --> 01:46:57,323
Eighteen years and nine months!

1575
01:46:57,598 --> 01:46:59,122
For the love of God, yes.

1576
01:47:00,267 --> 01:47:01,757
Then why are we getting married?

1577
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:03,662
Excellent point.

1578
01:47:04,038 --> 01:47:06,006
We were married in a way!

1579
01:47:06,807 --> 01:47:08,866
When two people are together
for so long, it's a marriage!

1580
01:47:09,143 --> 01:47:10,974
This is pointless!
- Exactly.

1581
01:47:11,045 --> 01:47:12,842
'Cos here's a perfectly good thing
- Love.

1582
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:14,312
Now let's destroy it,
piece by piece.

1583
01:47:14,582 --> 01:47:17,915
'Cos if we don't get
married Scandal! ! !

1584
01:47:17,985 --> 01:47:21,113
Just for a piece of paper that'll
tell us what we already know.

1585
01:47:21,188 --> 01:47:23,349
That we love each other.
- Exactly.

1586
01:47:24,191 --> 01:47:26,887
Or I wouldn't be spending our
honeymoon catering on your set!

1587
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:28,153
See, true love.

1588
01:47:28,195 --> 01:47:30,060
This is not sin!

1589
01:47:30,131 --> 01:47:32,929
So please don't call
our kids weird names!

1590
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,763
What? Hang on.
- But we won't have any kids.

1591
01:47:34,835 --> 01:47:36,803
Exactly..
- We will adopt puppies.

1592
01:47:37,071 --> 01:47:38,060
Then why didn't we?

1593
01:47:38,139 --> 01:47:39,629
I hate you, it's all your fault.

1594
01:47:39,707 --> 01:47:42,676
Al, breathe in, breathe out!
- I hate you.

1595
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,104
I know. I love you.

1596
01:47:44,645 --> 01:47:45,873
I hate this guy.

1597
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,645
Who the hell are you?

1598
01:47:47,715 --> 01:47:48,807
He's our doctor.

1599
01:47:48,949 --> 01:47:50,007
Don't touch me!

1600
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:51,244
How else will he do the delivery?

1601
01:47:51,318 --> 01:47:52,615
I'm talking about you.

1602
01:47:52,653 --> 01:47:53,950
Please get this thing out of her.

1603
01:47:54,955 --> 01:47:56,047
Let's do it again.

1604
01:47:57,792 --> 01:47:59,191
I don't think I can
go through the trauma

1605
01:47:59,794 --> 01:48:02,228
What shit! I endured the trauma.

1606
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:03,922
Come on.

1607
01:48:04,565 --> 01:48:05,691
No.

1608
01:48:07,101 --> 01:48:09,194
Sarah, mom is leaving you now, okay?

1609
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:12,000
Like you left daddy.

1610
01:48:12,106 --> 01:48:13,198
What?

1611
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:17,907
Sarah, mom loves dad so much..

1612
01:48:17,978 --> 01:48:20,708
..that she came back from
Australia to be with him.

1613
01:48:20,948 --> 01:48:22,711
After the break up.

1614
01:48:24,185 --> 01:48:25,652
It was just a little break.

1615
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:28,254
So what does a 'little
break' mean Shah Rukh?

1616
01:48:28,322 --> 01:48:29,721
Oh shut up, Sunita!

1617
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:48,770
And finally a whiff of fresh air..

1618
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,673
.. as our bound arms
stretch themselves.

1619
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,617
My heart wants to hum..

1620
01:49:03,891 --> 01:49:05,859
While he wants to sing..

1621
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:09,687
I smile, he giggles..

1622
01:49:10,798 --> 01:49:14,029
.. powerless
against this crazy whim.

1623
01:49:14,768 --> 01:49:20,104
Distances are important too.

1624
01:49:20,975 --> 01:49:23,808
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1625
01:49:24,144 --> 01:49:29,047
Distances are important too.

1626
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:36,020
Distances are important too.

1627
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,090
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1628
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:45,590
Distances are important too.

1629
01:49:49,169 --> 01:49:54,072
Such intimacy sows
seeds of distances..

1630
01:49:56,777 --> 01:50:01,714
.. don't be fooled,
these waters are not sweet.

1631
01:50:03,817 --> 01:50:04,943
Look, but don't touch; its fire..

1632
01:50:05,152 --> 01:50:07,552
..just watch it shimmer from afar..

1633
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:15,719
..any closer and you could burn..

1634
01:50:15,996 --> 01:50:19,762
..powerless against this crazy whim.

1635
01:50:20,067 --> 01:50:25,767
Distances are important too.

1636
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:29,106
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1637
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:35,105
Distances are important too.

1638
01:50:35,349 --> 01:50:40,616
Distances are important too.

1639
01:50:41,889 --> 01:50:44,255
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1640
01:50:44,792 --> 01:50:50,753
Distances are important too.

1641
01:50:54,668 --> 01:51:04,168
I am rain and sunshine..

1642
01:51:04,244 --> 01:51:10,740
And he is a big bore.

1643
01:51:12,286 --> 01:51:14,686
Both rain but not together.

1644
01:51:14,855 --> 01:51:18,552
Life's easy with some distance.

1645
01:51:18,692 --> 01:51:22,253
We have our different worlds.

1646
01:51:23,163 --> 01:51:26,792
We are powerless
against this crazy whim.

1647
01:51:59,867 --> 01:52:05,169
Distances are important too.

1648
01:52:06,073 --> 01:52:08,769
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1649
01:52:09,209 --> 01:52:14,203
Distances are important too.

1650
01:52:15,182 --> 01:52:20,620
Distances are important too.

1651
01:52:21,789 --> 01:52:24,053
Sometimes you gotta chase space.

1652
01:52:24,691 --> 01:52:30,323
Distances are important too.
