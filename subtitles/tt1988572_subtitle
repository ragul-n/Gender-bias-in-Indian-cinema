"Humans."

00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:40,492
Your soul knows the
saga of your karma.

00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:43,292

Even God knows.

8
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,573
Where will you hide, humans?

9
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:59,830
Your soul and God too knows.

10
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:05,625
Your soul knows the
saga of your karma.

11
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:09,850
Even God knows.

12
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,587
You secretly commit sins.

13
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:31,572
You try hard to hide it.

14
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:36,826
You secretly commit sins.

15
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:42,650
You try hard to hide it.

16
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,825

00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:57,100

"Even God knows."

20
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,050
We will have to cut his
arm to save his life.

21
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,520
Sister, get ready for operation.

22
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,910
Inspector, you didn't
just shot at my arm.

23
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,090
You have snatched my livelihood.

24
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,090
You have snatched my
means of earning.

25
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,950
I will seek vengeance for this!

26
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,250
You will have to pay
a price for this!

27
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,860
You will have to pay a price!

28
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,530
Marry has come.

29
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,816
Mary, you have invited
the children..

30
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,883
At 6 in the evening for
the party, haven't you?

31
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,021
Yes.

32
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:01,224
Come, child!

33
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,376
My daughter will cut a cake in
the evening and I will sing..

34
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:08,960
Happy birthday to you!

35
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,027
Happy birthday to you!

36
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:31,164
- Darling!
- Oh God! You would have killed me!

37
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,928
Look, my heart is beating so fast!

38
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:42,624
It's good! It beats for me!

39
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,883
Hey! What are you doing?
Aren't you ashamed?

40
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:50,024
- Baby is looking! Come.
- Bye!

41
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,157
Oh no!

42
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,432
Baby is crying!

43
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,984
Let her cry! One of us has
to cry! Either she or me!

44
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,939
- Where did she go?
- Sir! Sir!

45
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:33,448
What sir? Where is
the baby? Tell me!

46
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,264
Sir, what do I tell you?

47
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,420
Nowadays people who do good deeds..

48
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,240
They are punished like this!

49
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,312
An old blind man fell on the road!

50
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,080
I helped him to cross the road!

51
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:50,406
When I returned.. I saw that
baby had disappeared, sir!

52
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,216
Baby, where did you go?

53
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,872
Shut up! Why are you
harping about papa!

54
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:56,006
Your papa is dead!

55
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:59,743
'My daughter will cut a cake in
the evening and I will sing.

56
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,922
'Happy birthday to you!'

57
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:25,421
Father.. I can't do it!

58
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,954
You can't do it! But
you can at least die!

59
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,172
Shall I give you a slap!
Will you do it or not?

60
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,955
- Father!
- You are a chatterbox!

61
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:35,106
What happened to your hands?

62
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,477
Show me your hand!

63
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:43,333
Hold this! With your thumb
and first finger!

64
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,551
Very good! Give me your hand!

65
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:49,965
Keep it below the coat!
Yes! Now cut it!

66
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:14,928
- How much is the potato for?
- Wait!

67
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,480
Two kilos is five rupees.

68
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,499
My money! You stole my money!

69
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,422
Hey! What are you saying?
Do I look like a thief?

70
00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:22,365
Yes! Yes! She has stolen my money!

71
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,496
Mind your tongue!

72
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,286
Your husband must have stolen it!

73
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,739
- It must be your husband! You old woman!
- Old woman!

74
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,843
Constable! Hey! Hey!

75
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:35,566
Leave! Leave! Leave!

76
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,072
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

77
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:30,005
Beat him! Beat him!
Get up! Beat him!

78
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,882
Hey! Hey! Hey!

79
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,736
Move!

80
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:43,837
Hey! Will you do it! Move!

81
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,552
Tell me! Will you do it!
Will you do it!

82
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:52,085
Come! You too come!

83
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,138
You!

84
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:02,869
Sister has come!

85
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,269
Darling! Give me something too!

86
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,055
Jumman, give him a toffee too!

87
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,031
They both will share it!

88
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,670
Now these toffees don't
satisfy me, darling.

89
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,339
Give me something else!

90
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,735
- Is that so?
- Yes!

91
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:00,938
- She is hot tempered!
- Get lost!

92
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:09,716
10.. 15.. 17.. 18.. 18 rupees..

93
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:12,207
Wait! Wait! Can't you see!
I have only one hand!

94
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,660
I don't have two hands!

95
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,248
Give!

96
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:23,958
18 and 2 is 20.. 30.. 36.. 36.. 40.

97
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:26,191
That's it?

98
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:31,675
I toil so hard, father! Won't
you give me something?

99
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:34,994
- Why? For what?
- I want it!

100
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:38,700
No, no, forget this note! I
won't give you even a penny!

101
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:41,175
I very well know what you
will do with this rupee!

102
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,676
Some aunt must not be having
anything to cook.

103
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,780
Some grandma must be dying
due to lack of medicine!

104
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:48,321
And those idiot children!
No, no! Give it to me!

105
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:49,581
Give me that 5 rupee note!

106
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,428
My dear father!

107
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,910
Give me that 5 rupee note!

108
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,065
Naughty!

109
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,199
Hey!

110
00:15:56,472 --> 00:16:03,069
I have taught you! And
you act smart with me!

111
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:12,141
You cunningly stole the
money from my pocket!

112
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,676
How can the police nab you?

113
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:19,209
It seems.. some people
have considered..

114
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,941
It their duty to break law!

115
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,460
As you all know.. even decent
people don't hesitate..

116
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,534
From doing illegal activities.

117
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:36,608
This has created a dangerous
situation for us.

118
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,046
Now how to stop this.. I want
to know everybody's opinion..

119
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,476
Regarding this matter.

120
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,232
Sir! I think there is
only one solution!

121
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,135
More people should be recruited
in the police force!

122
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,676
Many times it has happened
that we couldn't control..

123
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,260
The situation due to
shortage of officers.

124
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,473
Sir, I think penalty should
be charged in areas where..

125
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:01,661
People don't co-operate
with us in restoring peace.

126
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,460
Yes! Till the time every citizen
doesn't fear the police..

127
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,364
Law will not be taken seriously!

128
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,540
What? That will happen only when
our bond with the public..

129
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,476
Is based only on rifle, pistol,
tear gas and beatings.

130
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:21,092
A day will arrive when our entire
country will become a prison.

131
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,595
You mean to say that when a person
is going to commit a murder..

132
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,393
We should take Gita
and tell him to sit..

133
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:28,291
We will preach you the teachings
of Lord Krishna.

134
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:31,527
Inspector Bonge! We are not here
to comment on religious books!

135
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:32,794
Come to the point please!

136
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:35,394
Sorry, sir! I meant to say that
where people burn buses..

137
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:38,108
They destroy the railway
station and rob..

138
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,316
How can you bring them on the
right path without being strict?

139
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,932
Strictness can only suppress
people and not crimes.

140
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:48,148
Sir.. I agree strictness should
be used where it's needed.

141
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,268
But our aim is to reform the
culprits. Not to beat them.

142
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:55,604
This thinking suits a political
leader! Not a police inspector!

143
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,524
No, no, inspector Kailash!
That's wrong!

144
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,675
- Don't be personal please!
- I am sorry, sir!

145
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:01,912
Yes, inspector!

146
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:05,880
I am sure that crime is the
sign of an inner ailment.

147
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,488
We should try our best to
know it and understand it.

148
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:12,292
Every person has virtues and vices.

149
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,532
It's our duty to encourage
their virtues!

150
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:17,809
In stead of being people's enemy,
we should be their friend.

151
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,715
We should explain to them that
its their responsibility..

152
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,001
To respect law and to protect it.

153
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,100
What they are robbing and burning..

154
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,644
That is their own belonging.

155
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:29,479
Thank you, sir! That's all!

156
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,820
Gentlemen.. I have heard
both the sides.

157
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,672
For me both the point of views
are worth pondering upon.

158
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,341
I thank you very much, all of you!

159
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,724
I think we should disperse now.

160
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,736
- Inspector Mohan!
- Yes, sir!

161
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,548
- Come to meet me before leaving!
- Yes, sir!

162
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:01,327
Mohan.. today when I was listening
to your point of view..

163
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,343
Suddenly I remembered your father.

164
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:09,788
He too was a rebel during his times.

165
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,260
How time passes!

166
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,172
It seems like yesterday!

167
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,756
When a wicked man abducted
my 2 years old daughter.

168
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:30,180
At that time your father
supported me a lot.

169
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:33,740
He gave your hand in
mine and he said..

170
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,780
From today he is your son.

171
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,604
I have called you here
for a special reason.

172
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,188
I am transferring you to T Zone.

173
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:49,796
Dear, you know.. last
year inspector..

174
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:53,332
Kelkar was murdered there.

175
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:58,276
In spite of our attempts.. we have
still not found the murderer.

176
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:04,700
Some goons are ruling in that area.

177
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,004
Out of their fear, people
don't help us.

178
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,852
I want you to go there..
Find the murderer.

179
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:16,852
And as far as possible.. awaken
feelings of respect..

180
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:21,244
For law in people's heart.

181
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,372
I will try my best, sir!

182
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,340
Mohan, I forgot to ask you!

183
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,180
How is your mother's health?

184
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,273
Now she is fine, sir.
She is a heart patient.

185
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,188
So the doctor has told her to rest.

186
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,668
I will come to meet her.

187
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,274
Mother! You are still awake!

188
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,804
You know what the doctor
has said, don't you?

189
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,108
Mr. Ashok had come!
He has just left!

190
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,403
- He told me you have got a promotion.
- Yes, mother.

191
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,269
In the joy of promotion you even
forgot that your sick mother..

192
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,548
Is waiting for you at home.

193
00:20:56,748 --> 00:21:00,028
Mother.. you know how my job is.

194
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:06,700
No matter what.. if you are even
a bit late.. I get scared.

195
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,860
Mother.. life is full of dangers.

196
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,261
But the son who has blessings
of a mother like you..

197
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:17,188
Who can harm him?

198
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,194
Enough! Enough! Don't talk too much!

199
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:22,140
- Go and change! I will serve you dinner!
- Okay, mother.

200
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:30,268
Here is the file.. of inspector
Kelkar's murder.

201
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,708
- Has there been any arrest in this case?
- Not yet!

202
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:43,660
No? Is any particular
man under suspicion?

203
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:49,194
Not any particular man.. but..
There are snaps of those goons..

204
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:55,148
Who reside in that locality..
Where inspector Kelkar was murdered.

205
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,700
He is the boss. Yes! The
boss of that locality.

206
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,988
There is no crime that
he doesn't commit!

207
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,124
He has opened a beer bar.

208
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:10,476
He has opened the bar where
people openly drink.

209
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,208
What's amazing is that every time..

210
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:16,620
He easily slips out
of law's clutches.

211
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:21,956
When I opened the liquor
bottle for my beloved..

212
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:26,308
24 drops sprinkled out.

213
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:30,468
"Look.."

214
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:37,484
"Go on drinking."

215
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:44,228
"Beloved, hold me."

216
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:49,524
"Beloved, hold me."

217
00:22:50,396 --> 00:22:53,461
"Beloved, hold me."

218
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,202
"Beloved, hold me."

219
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:58,127
"Beloved, hold me."

220
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,373
"Beloved, hold me."

221
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:05,874
"I will give you the reward
hidden in my lips."

222
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:08,127
"Beloved, hold me."

223
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:11,177
"Beloved, hold me."

224
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:43,337
"There is intoxication of
the liquor and youth too."

225
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:48,623
"My charming graces too are
intoxicated along with me."

226
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:53,844
"There is intoxication of
the liquor and youth too."

227
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:58,945
"My charming graces too are
intoxicated along with me."

228
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:05,076
"Become fervent and
accept some blame."

229
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:07,499
"Beloved, hold me."

230
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,499
"Beloved, hold me."

231
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:14,653
"I will give you the reward
hidden in my lips."

232
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:20,396
"Beloved, hold me."

233
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:45,711
"If you want to live,
then enjoy life."

234
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:50,853
"Don't fear the world.
Live in the world."

235
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:55,820
"If you want to live,
then enjoy life."

236
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,940
"Don't fear the world.
Live in the world."

237
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:06,405
"What people call as bad,
that's the best thing."

238
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:09,151
"Beloved, hold me."

239
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,359
"Beloved, hold me."

240
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:17,009
"I will give you the reward
hidden in my lips."

241
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,403
"Beloved, hold me."

242
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,406
"Beloved, hold me."

243
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:23,838
"Beloved, hold me."

244
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:25,445
"Beloved, hold me."

245
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,007
Police! Police! Police! Police!

246
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:29,374
Run! Police!

247
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,535
I will be grateful if
you moved from the way.

248
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:03,038
I should move? You don't
know who I am!

249
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:10,558
I am the boss of this locality!
Am I right, Jumma?

250
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:23,101
- I again tell you to move from the way!
- Move?

251
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:30,472
I have made India gate for you.
You can pass from here.

252
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,839
Go!

253
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:06,331
I forgive!

254
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:09,912
Otherwise I am a bad man! Yes!

255
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,091
A cruel inspector has come!

256
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:28,319
He arrested our boss today!

257
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,624
Oh my God! Take care
of your affairs!

258
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:34,502
Now I can't do this
illegal business!

259
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:41,907
Don't worry! If he is cruel..
Then we too are not any less.

260
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:45,838
Like the previous inspector,
we will get rid of him too.

261
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:49,836
Listen! This time goods
worth lakhs are arriving!

262
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:51,769
There shouldn't be any blunder.

263
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,891
The goods should reach
the warehouse safely.

264
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,703
You earn money! And
we risk our lives!

265
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:59,557
No, sir! It's enough!
I won't do this work!

266
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,832
So what will be the cost
of making you courageous?

267
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:05,629
Take this.

268
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,491
Inspector has come.

269
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:08,685
Send him in.

270
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:17,101
I am so fortunate. God has arrived
in a poor man's house.

271
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:20,824
Sir, you had promised to lend
some help to the police.

272
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:23,031
I can even lay down my
life for the police.

273
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,557
I live under your shelter.

274
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:29,039
And you are our protector
in this country.

275
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:34,213
He is our astrologer. He
is a very learned man.

276
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,495
Today only he has returned
from Barahbanki.

277
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:38,709
I had heard about Kashi's
learned men.

278
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:42,805
I didn't know that even Barahbanki's
Learned men are renowned.

279
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:47,505
Come. Have a seat. Sit.

280
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,432
I will just bring the cheque book.

281
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,373
The lines in the palm says..

282
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:13,861
But your forehead
lines confirms it.

283
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:20,101
You will die in an accident.
Accident. Accident.

284
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,424
It's important to find a solution.

285
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:23,630
What's the solution, sage?

286
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:26,571
The thing is that.. it has
been going on since ages.

287
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:29,357
The village or city
where a man lives..

288
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:32,510
If he leaves that place, then
the event can be evaded.

289
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:35,509
What can be evaded that
is not destiny, sage.

290
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,368
- Have a cigarette.
- What?

291
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,958
Have it. Don't worry.

292
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:44,633
Sages too do drugs. This
is just a cigarette.

293
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,341
- Is it made of gold?
- No. Rolled gold.

294
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,971
Sir, what did I say? Accident!

295
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:07,613
What Barahbanki's learned men say..

296
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:09,581
It always comes true.

297
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:15,491
Wait! Fool! You couldn't catch
it! Shall I beat you?

298
00:30:15,571 --> 00:30:18,369
Sister! I was trying to catch it!

299
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,696
Shut up!

300
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:22,954
Shall I beat you?

301
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,562
Don't angry.
It has hurt me!

302
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:35,700
Forgive me.

303
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:38,344
What if I don't forgive you?

304
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:44,916
Locked eyes..

305
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,639
- Move!
- Now give me this!

306
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:50,736
Your days to play are over!

307
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,842
Listen! Let me see! Whether
you have locked eyes or not!

308
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:58,784
I will hit you!

309
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:03,357
Why not? When your beloved is
a policeman, then what to fear?

310
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:04,557
- You!
- No!

311
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:07,280
Wait! Wait! You!

312
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:12,569
Mr. Bonge! There are fingerprints
on this cigarette case.

313
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,766
- Send it to fingerprint bureau today itself.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:17,224
Thank you.

315
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,248
What are you doing?

316
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,357
What has that inspector done to you?

317
00:31:25,437 --> 00:31:26,691
That you have become so hot.

318
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,848
It seems that even the
water will burn.

319
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:32,808
What?

320
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:40,504
Your skin is vibrating.

321
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:46,696
So you fell in love
with that inspector!

322
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:57,688
Who will not feel tempted
after seeing this body?

323
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:59,600
He has got enticed!

324
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:03,832
Is that so? So on behalf
of that inspector..

325
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:07,408
Oh God!

326
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:11,864
The combination of water
and fire is so nice!

327
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:13,808
What fun!

328
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,976
Leave! I am getting late!
Father must be waiting!

329
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,579
And I have to dry the clothes too!

330
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,032
Why do you have to dry the clothes?

331
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,424
It will automatically
dry up on your body.

332
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:30,672
Get lost! Go on talking!
I am leaving!

333
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:33,648
Listen!

334
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:37,000
- Shamli!
- Who is it?

335
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:40,064
- You have put us into trouble!
- I made a blunder.

336
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:41,400
Run!

337
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:46,816
Fool! Stupid! What is this?

338
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,239
You cast lustful eyes on women!

339
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,664
What have I done?

340
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:54,920
You have no respect for women!

341
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,656
- Doesn't it hurt me?
- It hurts you!

342
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:00,341
Grandma! Grandma! Take
this! Take this!

343
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:02,744
- Leave!
- I didn't do anything!

344
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:06,109
Aunt! What is this?

345
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:08,821
Move! Move! Why are
you getting angry?

346
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,291
He didn't do anything! I know!

347
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:13,469
Fool! You too are not any less!

348
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:16,557
- Both are the same!
- No!

349
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,597
You both are the same!

350
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:24,885
God, when will you both die?
I will get rid of you!

351
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:31,436
"Hare Rama! Hare Rama! Rama!
Rama! Hare! Hare!"

352
00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:38,307
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!
Krishna! Krishna! Hare! Hare!

353
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:45,158
Hare Rama! Hare Rama! Rama!
Rama! Hare! Hare!

354
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:51,997
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!
Krishna! Krishna! Hare! Hare!

355
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:58,174
Hare Rama! Hare Rama! Rama!
Rama! Hare! Hare!

356
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:04,837
"Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!
Krishna! Krishna! Hare! Hare!"

357
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:11,403
Hare Rama! Hare Rama! Rama!
Rama! Hare! Hare!

358
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:17,697
Look! Don't tell inspector!
It will be fun!

359
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:24,820
Hare Rama! Hare Rama! Rama!
Rama! Hare! Hare!

360
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,097
- Hare Rama! Hare Rama!
- You?

361
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,687
You too like religious discourses?

362
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:35,098
Yes! Just like that! A bit!

363
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,098
I have heard that Lord
Krishna was a thief.

364
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,497
He used to steal milkmaids' heart.

365
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:43,030
Today seeing you here, I too admit.

366
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,619
Inspector, now the world
has completely changed.

367
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,497
Nowadays girls..

368
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:52,207
I think this is yours.

369
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:57,094
Hey! This is my wallet!
How come it's with you?

370
00:34:57,174 --> 00:34:59,801
Great! You are asking me!

371
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:02,829
How come you are an inspector?

372
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,035
Talking loudly is forbidden
here. Come with me.

373
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:15,569
Lord Ganesh! Lord Krishna!
Sai Baba! Guru Nanak!

374
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:21,433
Jesus Christ! Your
house is a temple!

375
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:27,070
Reshma.. your father seems
to be a religious man.

376
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:33,439
No, sir. It's like I have
imprisoned all of them in my house.

377
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,734
Who know.. when who comes to aid.

378
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:40,334
If one doesn't hear my plea..
Then I pray to another one.

379
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,425
- But you?
- I am Mohan!

380
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,087
- Mohan?
- Police inspector Mohan.

381
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,094
Police inspector..

382
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:50,174
- Father, today there was a problem!
- What?

383
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,420
- You know that I had gone to the fair.
- Yes.

384
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,833
There a thief was stealing
a gentleman's wallet.

385
00:35:56,238 --> 00:36:01,509
I saw. He ran. I kicked him.
And he.. he fell down.

386
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:06,101
- Then?
- Then I pounced on the wallet. And he fled.

387
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,565
When I opened the wallet, what
did I see? What did I see?

388
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:16,699
Photo! Inspector's photo!
I returned it.

389
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,369
Inspector.. what world is this!

390
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,222
Now people have started
stealing policemen.

391
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:25,898
Father, he praised me!

392
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,367
And he said.. because
of me there are..

393
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,620
Decent and honest
girls in the world.

394
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,102
Yes, sir. I escorted her home.

395
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:35,854
I thought that thief might
harass her on the way.

396
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:39,898
Thanks a lot. Have a seat. Dear,
spread the mattress.

397
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,176
Come on. And bring
tea for inspector.

398
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:49,365
- Poor people don't have chair. This..
- That's okay.

399
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,958
I didn't bring him. He himself
came. So what could I do?

400
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,761
Because of you, I had
to lie to father.

401
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:03,243
Let it be. Everything
is fair in love.

402
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:07,952
Here.

403
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,608
If I can ever come to your aid,
then I will be delighted.

404
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,193
Thanks a lot, inspector!

405
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:25,154
But our profession is such..
That police doesn't help us.

406
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:29,992
Reshma!

407
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:35,287
You are great! You made me lie
in front of your father!

408
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:36,850
Didn't I lie?

409
00:37:38,078 --> 00:37:40,171
Now see what happens in the future.

410
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,820
When will you meet me again?

411
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:44,564
You are an inspector.
You can come any time.

412
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,833
You can handcuff me
and take me with you.

413
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:52,470
Leave me!

414
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:56,287
'If somebody calls you
in the lonely night..

415
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,302
Then know that its me.

416
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:03,638
I am calling you. Reshma.

417
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:04,922
Coming!

418
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,739
What happened?

419
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:17,888
Go to sleep, father. Go to sleep.

420
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,524
'Reshma!'

421
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:27,282
"Who am I? What am I?"

422
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:34,801
"Do ask me that."

423
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:42,565
"Who am I? What am I?"

424
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:46,895
"Do ask me that."

425
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:50,491
"Whoever you are, you are mine."

426
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:55,240
"Now don't think about
anything else."

427
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:29,197
"My eyes might have to bow
down after looking up."

428
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:40,154
"My eyes might have to bow
down after looking up."

429
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:47,742
"After walking a few steps,
I might have to stop."

430
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:52,063
"Why am I lonely?"

431
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:56,170
"Do ask me that."

432
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:59,927
"Whoever you are, you are mine."

433
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:04,217
"Now don't think about
anything else."

434
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:36,515
"I admit that you have dwelled
me in your eyes."

435
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:47,420
"I admit that you have dwelled
me in your eyes."

436
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:51,369
"Whatever I am, however I am."

437
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,890
"You have embraced me."

438
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:59,061
"Whether I am a stone or a diamond."

439
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:03,353
"Do ask me that."

440
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:07,054
"Whoever you are, you are mine."

441
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:10,833
"Now don't think about
anything else."

442
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:14,555
"Who am I? What am I?"

443
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:18,676
"Do ask me that."

444
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:22,100
"Whoever you are, you are mine."

445
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:25,804
"Now don't think about
anything else."

446
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:30,287
"Who am I? What am I?"

447
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,098
Sir.. these fingerprints taken
from the cigarette case..

448
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,360
And the fingerprint expert's
report clearly indicates..

449
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:40,102
That this charlatan astrologer..

450
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:44,195
Belongs to the gang which had
murdered inspector Kelkar.

451
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,575
Sir, I am sure.. this gang contains
not just goons and ruffians..

452
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:54,075
But some influential people of
this city too are backing them.

453
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,908
This is the reason that whenever
law tries to nab them..

454
00:41:58,145 --> 00:41:59,943
They succeed in escaping.

455
00:42:00,928 --> 00:42:01,952
But for how long?

456
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:03,462
I am keeping a watch on them.

457
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,571
That inspector.. he scolded me
a bit and then he let me go!

458
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:13,087
These fools think that bad people..

459
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,568
Can reform in the future!

460
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:19,318
I follow only one principle!

461
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:22,959
If a man is bad.. then he is
bad for the rest of his life!

462
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:24,879
He will only commit bad deeds!

463
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,424
You are laughing!

464
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:32,195
Who are you?

465
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:35,138
What work do you do?

466
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:38,468
Will you have something to eat?

467
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:41,468
Will you drink?

468
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,623
You will drink!

469
00:42:44,703 --> 00:42:49,462
He is an interesting man!
He is a first class beggar!

470
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,510
He begs for liquor!

471
00:43:01,686 --> 00:43:04,054
Listen! God heard our prayers!

472
00:43:04,483 --> 00:43:06,524
He is dumb! He is dumb!

473
00:43:06,906 --> 00:43:10,127
We can use him to get
rid of the inspector!

474
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:14,368
If he is caught, he won't even
be able to give the statement!

475
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:17,812
You all leave. I will bring him.

476
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:24,759
Listen! You want liquor, don't you?

477
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,251
Then come with me!

478
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:35,826
Liquor is nothing!

479
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:38,293
I will give you something
that you will be..

480
00:43:38,373 --> 00:43:40,426
In a trance for the
rest of your life!

481
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:46,147
Money! Listen!

482
00:43:47,706 --> 00:43:50,005
Listen! What will you have to do?

483
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:53,076
You will have to kill the inspector!

484
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,781
You will go to the
inspector's house.

485
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,565
I will show you his house.

486
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:03,693
Listen! Go there and
ask for shelter!

487
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,534
Then eat there!

488
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,884
Inspector has an old mother!
She is very kind!

489
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:15,985
She will provide you with shelter,
food and everything!

490
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,112
And one day when you get a chance..

491
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,555
Quietly enter the kitchen.

492
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,715
And mix this in the milk.

493
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:30,689
This will kill both
the mother and son.

494
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:36,226
After you finish the work..

495
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,827
After you finish the work..
Then you will get this money!

496
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,226
Fool! Why are you snatching
it! What joke is this!

497
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,839
Why are you hitting me!
The beard will come off!

498
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:50,742
Hands up!

499
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:07,125
Barahbanki's learned man!

500
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:14,681
Inspector! Look there!

501
00:45:50,897 --> 00:45:56,584
Oh my god, I am dead.
I am dead. Somebody save me.

502
00:46:22,506 --> 00:46:25,159
Oh my God! Oh my God!

503
00:46:25,474 --> 00:46:26,967
Barahbanki's learned man!

504
00:46:27,504 --> 00:46:29,444
Come, I will take you
to the police station!

505
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,614
Inspector, forgive me. Let
me go to Barahbanki!

506
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:40,105
I will tell you everything!
Everything!

507
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:42,937
Tomorrow afternoon at 2,
committee members..

508
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,861
Of Jeevan Kalyan school
are coming for donation.

509
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:49,108
At 2:30, you have to give a speech
on government's..

510
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:52,671
At women's organisation.

511
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,866
At 3:15 you have to preside over
meeting for Gita discourses.

512
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,082
I have fixed the program
with the sage.

513
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:05,828
At 4 you have to give a speech
supporting prohibition.

514
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:07,570
This is an important meeting!

515
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:18,213
At 5 you have to go to meet
the minister for tea.

516
00:47:19,024 --> 00:47:22,890
At 6:15 you have to give a speech
in the election meeting.

517
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:26,705
After that?

518
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:04,912
Sir.. what habit do you have?

519
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:07,248
You dress me up as a man.

520
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:09,646
And you yourself dress
up as a woman.

521
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,203
Listen.. you don't know.

522
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:21,304
This arouses me! Yes, arouses me!

523
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:38,709
Who has called me at this hour?

524
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:46,761
Hello!

525
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:51,609
What rubbish!

526
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:53,849
Inspector has messed
up everything, sir!

527
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:56,162
All our men were caught!

528
00:48:56,242 --> 00:49:00,273
The police reached on time!
We lost all the goods, sir!

529
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:03,833
Goon! Ruffian! You are trying
to hide the matter?

530
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:05,868
Which fools had you
hired for the work?

531
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:08,204
Sir, listen to me! Sir,
listen to me!

532
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,036
Stop this nonsense!

533
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:27,838
I am reading my speech. You check
it with the written script.

534
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,194
And check whether I remember
it correctly or not.

535
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:33,432
Ladies and Gentlemen!

536
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,645
I am sad to see that in the
guise of sages and saints..

537
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:42,506
Honesty and sincerity
is being destroyed.

538
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:45,072
Bribery everywhere!
Bribery everywhere!

539
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:50,498
All kind of businesses
are running into loses.

540
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:53,222
Only thieves are progressing!

541
00:49:53,302 --> 00:49:54,438
Carry on!

542
00:49:54,518 --> 00:50:02,518
Friends.. in this election..
Give me your vote!

543
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:09,110
Make me win! Then you all watch!

544
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,510
I will liberate this country
from bribery forever!

545
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:21,629
Nowadays all the educated
people in this country..

546
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:26,908
And good people are
doing smuggling!

547
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:32,078
I ask them on your behalf..
What will you get by..

548
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,907
Being the cause of our
country's downfall?

549
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:42,462
Is there no other business in
our country besides smuggling?

550
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:48,054
This country.. this land.. gave
birth to Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru..

551
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:54,606
Lord Buddha.. Ramchandra..
Mahatma Gandhi..

552
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:59,414
Guru Nanak and Christ!

553
00:50:59,494 --> 00:51:00,767
- Sir!
- What?

554
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,606
Now end your speech. I have
your arrest warrant.

555
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,035
Commissioner!

556
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,278
If you think you can escape after
behaving like this with me..

557
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:14,430
Then you are wrong!

558
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:18,828
You will regret it! And I
can never tolerate this!

559
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:20,774
Commissioner, don't forget!

560
00:51:21,042 --> 00:51:24,705
I have contributed a large chunk
of my life for public service.

561
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:29,431
If I want, I can wake up Chief
Minister at midnight!

562
00:51:29,642 --> 00:51:32,733
I can call and wake
up Prime Minister.

563
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:35,705
I will shake up the government!
I can do anything!

564
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:38,845
I can raise chaos in your
police department!

565
00:51:38,925 --> 00:51:40,893
To teach that insolent
officer a lesson!

566
00:51:41,175 --> 00:51:43,973
I ask, commissioner..
What is his stature?

567
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:47,425
He is an ordinary officer! And
he arrests me in the meeting!

568
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:51,167
- Me! A leader! A minister!
- Sir!

569
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,292
If you permit, I will
introduce you to him.

570
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:58,634
He is a learned astrologer.

571
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:04,838
Sage.. can you tell me
what his future is?

572
00:52:08,242 --> 00:52:11,575
The lines on his forehead reveals
that he will spend..

573
00:52:11,655 --> 00:52:16,102
The rest of his
life in the prison.

574
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:19,763
He will rot there. But
no need to worry.

575
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:23,290
I too will be with him to serve him.

576
00:52:24,396 --> 00:52:29,512
- Good that he was caught!
- Let me see!

577
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:31,904
His goods too were seized.

578
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:36,635
Now in the prison he will eat
the food that poor people eat!

579
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,975
He must be lying on the floor!

580
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:44,509
Mosquitoes will bite him!
He will go mad!

581
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:02,043
Hey.. do you know how I
will congratulate you?

582
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:27,425
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

583
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:34,772
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

584
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:39,762
"Your whistling is revealing
your love."

585
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:46,585
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

586
00:54:06,945 --> 00:54:12,129
"Whatever you want to say by
whistling, why don't you say it?"

587
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:14,593
"Why don't you say it?"

588
00:54:14,762 --> 00:54:19,297
"No matter how much you try to
hide love, you can't hide it."

589
00:54:19,377 --> 00:54:22,034
"Beloved, you can't hide it."

590
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:26,953
"Beloved, how long feigning
innocence."

591
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:32,717
"Beloved, how long feigning
innocence, will you raise havoc?"

592
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:38,768
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

593
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:44,304
"Your whistling is revealing
your love."

594
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:49,749
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

595
00:55:11,252 --> 00:55:13,248
"What to say to the
person who doesn't.."

596
00:55:13,328 --> 00:55:15,957
"Understand the language of eyes?"

597
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:19,375
"Who doesn't understand
the language of eyes?"

598
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:20,629
"Is that so?"

599
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:24,876
"Birds understand. But
men don't understand."

600
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:28,024
"But men don't understand."

601
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,299
"Oh my God!"

602
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:34,695
"Beloved, with the scales of eyes.."

603
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:39,712
"Beloved, with the scales
of eyes, weigh hearts."

604
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:46,123
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

605
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:51,310
"Your whistling is revealing
your love."

606
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:57,466
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

607
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,695
"What do I weigh hearts? You
have stolen my heart."

608
00:56:13,775 --> 00:56:15,295
"It's my job to nab thieves."

609
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,873
"Someday you will be
trapped, damsel."

610
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,828
"If I am a thief, then handcuff me
and take me to the police station."

611
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:28,939
"You are an inspector. How
can I escape from you?"

612
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:34,168
"Beloved, if you get me punished.."

613
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:39,369
"Beloved, if you get me punished,
it will be a priceless gift."

614
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:45,904
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

615
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,056
"Your whistling is revealing
your love."

616
00:56:51,136 --> 00:56:56,128
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

617
00:56:56,208 --> 00:57:02,480
"Whether you speak or not,
just stay with me."

618
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:30,948
Ticket!

619
00:57:32,955 --> 00:57:33,955
Dear..

620
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,860
Ticket, please! Ticket, please!

621
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:41,976
Dear.. I am talking to you!

622
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,370
Ticket, please!

623
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:51,300
Ticket, please!

624
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:59,180
Dear! Dear! My pass is in that
wallet. Show it to him.

625
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:08,941
Your ticket?

626
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,973
She is my daughter. In a hurry,
I didn't buy a ticket.

627
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:18,433
You make a ticket. I will pay.

628
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:28,632
Don't worry, dear.

629
00:58:29,364 --> 00:58:32,047
You think I will hand
you over to the police?

630
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:38,000
No, dear. A father
can never do that.

631
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:40,893
No matter how many mistakes
a daughter commits.

632
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:44,890
But dear.. why do you
do this dirty work?

633
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:51,634
Just think. If you are arrested,
then your future will turn bleak.

634
00:58:52,315 --> 00:58:54,292
People will hate you.

635
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,633
And your hands.. henna of marriage..

636
00:58:57,713 --> 00:59:00,223
Will never be adorned
on these hands.

637
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:21,563
I will have to take it.
It contains 300 rupees.

638
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:23,689
My monthly income.

639
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:30,228
Today is the 1st. I can't even
think of returning home empty-handed.

640
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:32,556
If I lose my money, my children..

641
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:34,896
Will be expelled from the school.

642
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:38,368
My landlord will banish
us from our home.

643
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:44,556
My ill wife will die due
to lack of medicine.

644
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:49,833
My small world will be ruined.

645
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:00,692
You seem to belong to
some decent family.

646
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:02,608
I don't know what is
your helplessness..

647
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:03,952
That you have to do this work.

648
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:05,891
Keep this, dear.

649
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:11,626
No, Baba! No! Don't embarrass
me more, Baba!

650
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:17,091
Take this, Baba! For your children..

651
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:20,627
But.. you too are my child.

652
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:23,149
Who can understand a daughter's
helplessness..

653
01:00:23,527 --> 01:00:25,566
Better than a father?

654
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:27,956
Baba!

655
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:32,797
Heed one advice of this old father,
dear! I plead with you!

656
01:00:33,348 --> 01:00:37,568
No matter how difficult
the times are..

657
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:41,462
Don't ever again do this work.

658
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:43,897
Never! Never!

659
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:48,386
What did you say? Say it once more!

660
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:51,431
Not once, I will say
it countless times!

661
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,264
I will not do this dirty
work! I won't!

662
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:58,388
Tell me! Who has instigated you?

663
01:00:58,817 --> 01:01:01,560
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

664
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,892
Beat me! Beat me more! Kill me!

665
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:06,899
Strangulate me!

666
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:09,961
Why will I strangulate you?

667
01:01:11,152 --> 01:01:12,961
I will hang myself!

668
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:17,563
I know! I have become
a burden for you!

669
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:22,695
I am a handicap man! I can't work!

670
01:01:23,832 --> 01:01:29,332
I am a fool! I should have
understood before only!

671
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:33,645
That a father can never depend
on his daughter's earnings.

672
01:01:34,414 --> 01:01:40,987
God.. have You kept me
alive to see this day?

673
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:44,872
I raised a motherless girl.

674
01:01:45,653 --> 01:01:50,054
I was her father. I became
her mother too.

675
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:55,772
And today.. today I have become
a burden for her only!

676
01:01:56,933 --> 01:02:03,350
Don't worry, dear. I will get
rid of this burden forever.

677
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:07,856
You can live! And do as you please!

678
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:12,818
You deserve to live!
I deserve to die!

679
01:02:12,898 --> 01:02:14,763
Father! Father! Father!

680
01:02:14,843 --> 01:02:22,405
No, father! No, father!
Don't do this, father!

681
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:31,698
Forgive me! I beg you,
father! I beg you!

682
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:36,089
Don't do this, father!

683
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:41,633
I will do whatever you say, father!
I will do that only!

684
01:02:42,098 --> 01:02:48,653
Some more.. give me more.

685
01:02:49,818 --> 01:02:53,026
I am still in my senses.

686
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:58,029
Enough! What has happened to you?
Will you kill yourself?

687
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:04,090
What's the use of this..

688
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:10,333
After all.. after all what am I?

689
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:19,093
What am I? A puppet! Whose strings
lie in father's hands!

690
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:24,573
And I dance to his tunes!

691
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:27,965
What do you think?

692
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:30,989
I dance in front of these
goons at my own will?

693
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:36,368
Fool, people's helplessness makes
them do all sorts of things.

694
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,389
Forget these things!

695
01:03:39,277 --> 01:03:43,485
No! Give me some more!

696
01:03:43,565 --> 01:03:46,830
No! I am telling you! Go to sleep!

697
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:57,629
I drank. But I am not intoxicated.

698
01:04:51,685 --> 01:04:56,569
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

699
01:04:56,949 --> 01:05:01,589
"If you have to die tomorrow,
then die today."

700
01:05:03,981 --> 01:05:08,685
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

701
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:13,361
"If you have to die tomorrow,
then die today."

702
01:05:30,757 --> 01:05:35,565
"Lose your senses."

703
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:40,109
"Break all chains."

704
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:45,253
"Now this twilight will never end."

705
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:49,818
"Now dawn will never break."

706
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:54,973
"Whom do you care for?"

707
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:59,517
"Who is yours in this world?"

708
01:06:00,325 --> 01:06:04,885
"If there is nobody to
ask your wellbeing."

709
01:06:05,285 --> 01:06:09,693
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

710
01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:29,429
"Nature is blind. People are deaf."

711
01:06:29,757 --> 01:06:34,013
"Beautiful dreams
have turned bleak."

712
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:39,053
"Break away the expectations."

713
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:43,829
"Stop fighting with your emotions."

714
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:48,821
"If not today then tomorrow
you will understand."

715
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:53,325
"It's difficult to fight
with your circumstances."

716
01:06:53,781 --> 01:06:58,589
"Do what your circumstances
make you do."

717
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:03,157
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

718
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:22,485
"The door of good deeds is close."

719
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:27,493
"You have to carry your own cross."

720
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:38,165
"Nobody will carry your burden
of living corpses."

721
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:44,168
"End the matter today."

722
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,236
"End these merciless shows."

723
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:54,140
"Beloved, cross the limits."

724
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:58,924
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

725
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:03,956
"If you have to die tomorrow,
then die today."

726
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,988
"Fill the ocean with liquor."

727
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:14,508
Come! I will teach
you a lesson! Come!

728
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,764
- What is all this?
- What? What?

729
01:08:21,844 --> 01:08:23,860
You are drunk!

730
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:31,434
Drunk? Who says I am not drunk?

731
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:38,637
Fill the ocean with liquor.

732
01:08:39,764 --> 01:08:45,404
If you have to die tomorrow,
then die today.

733
01:08:45,484 --> 01:08:48,039
- Come to your senses!
- Senses!

734
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:53,483
Tell senses, I don't want
to come to my senses!

735
01:08:53,564 --> 01:08:54,897
Reshma!

736
01:08:55,104 --> 01:08:58,531
If Reshma comes to her
senses, father..

737
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:03,037
Then who will talk in a trance?

738
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:06,547
Who will steal?

739
01:09:07,038 --> 01:09:10,439
Who will bring money for you?

740
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:19,260
But what do you care, father?

741
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:24,641
Children might starve.

742
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:33,038
Some poor man might be banished
from the house.

743
01:09:34,038 --> 01:09:42,038
Because of you.. somebody might
die due to lack of medicine.

744
01:09:44,022 --> 01:09:47,840
Somebody's dreams might die.

745
01:09:52,572 --> 01:09:57,908
People say.. this is illegal
money, father!

746
01:09:58,572 --> 01:10:01,370
This is money earned
by committing sin!

747
01:10:02,454 --> 01:10:10,375
But for you.. its so pure..
Its so chaste.

748
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:19,462
Some people won't be so happy
even after meeting God!

749
01:10:19,726 --> 01:10:27,726
As much happy you are when you
see this, father! Take this!

750
01:10:31,905 --> 01:10:38,358
'Just think. If you are arrested,
then your future will turn bleak.

751
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:40,907
'People will hate you.

752
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:45,278
'And your hands..
Henna of marriage..

753
01:10:45,358 --> 01:10:48,678
Will never be adorned
on these hands.

754
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:05,625
"Every time your beauty
looks different."

755
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:19,342
"Every time your beauty
looks different."

756
01:11:20,839 --> 01:11:28,839
"Every time I want different
ways of expression."

757
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:35,510
"Every time your beauty.."

758
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:54,436
"At times it's tender like flower."

759
01:11:54,705 --> 01:11:59,422
"At times it smoulders like flames."

760
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:04,132
"At times it's tender like flower."

761
01:12:04,468 --> 01:12:09,292
"At times it smoulders like flames."

762
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:17,372
"At times your grace is charming
and at times it's coy."

763
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:23,426
"At times charming and
at times it's coy."

764
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:28,242
"Every dawn is different"

765
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:33,067
"Every twilight is different"

766
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:41,291
"Every time your beauty
looks different."

767
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:48,283
"Every time your beauty.."

768
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:15,027
"I can't get enough of you."

769
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:24,931
"I can't get enough of you."

770
01:13:26,643 --> 01:13:34,643
"My arms don't get tired
after embracing you."

771
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:40,899
"My arms.."

772
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:49,239
"My touch makes your
body more youthful."

773
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:59,011
"Every time your beauty
looks different."

774
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:07,699
"Every time your beauty.."

775
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,231
What do you think?

776
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,483
I will be morose because
you didn't come..

777
01:14:34,664 --> 01:14:35,904
To meet me for so many days.

778
01:14:36,308 --> 01:14:38,488
Not at all!

779
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:41,757
People who are in love,
they feel morose!

780
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:46,036
I don't love you at all!
What do you think?

781
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:51,791
I will cry if you won't
come? Get lost!

782
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:54,963
I don't cry at all!

783
01:14:55,793 --> 01:14:59,031
And even if I cry..
I won't let you know!

784
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:01,796
What happened? When you
want to meet, you meet!

785
01:15:02,134 --> 01:15:03,614
When you don't want to meet,
you won't meet!

786
01:15:03,638 --> 01:15:04,549
Reshma!

787
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:05,829
Mohan!

788
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:09,891
Why didn't you come? Why didn't
you come for so many days?

789
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:12,166
For God's sake, don't
harass me so much!

790
01:15:12,398 --> 01:15:15,503
Don't make me cry so much!
Tell me! Where were you?

791
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:21,505
Do you think I can live without
you? I couldn't come!

792
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:24,832
On one hand my job.. on the
other hand my sick mother.

793
01:15:25,282 --> 01:15:27,891
- What happened to your mother?
- Heart attack!

794
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:29,691
Oh my God! Now how is she?

795
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:31,944
Now she is fine. But you know.

796
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:34,038
There is nobody besides
me to look after her.

797
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:41,773
Is that so? So you had lied
to me. It was a charade.

798
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:46,757
How can you think like this?

799
01:15:47,187 --> 01:15:49,424
Just now you were saying..
That there is..

800
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:52,439
Nobody besides you to
look after your mother.

801
01:15:52,986 --> 01:15:56,712
Is your mother not my mother?

802
01:15:57,256 --> 01:15:58,562
Reshma!

803
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:08,562
Mother!

804
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,632
Mother, look what
I have got for you!

805
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,503
God bless you, dear!

806
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:25,569
You are so beautiful! I
might cast an evil eye!

807
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:38,096
And you.. you look at your
face in the mirror..

808
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,365
And tell me the truth!

809
01:16:39,704 --> 01:16:41,558
Are you worthy of her?

810
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,758
Look, mother. Don't start pampering
her from now only!

811
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:47,240
I.. I will surely pamper her!

812
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:50,429
- What's your name, dear?
- Reshma!

813
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:52,362
Who has asked you?

814
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:56,818
Dear.. what's your name?

815
01:16:57,358 --> 01:17:00,248
Father calls me Reshma.

816
01:17:02,037 --> 01:17:05,078
But when you will become this
family's daughter-in-law..

817
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:08,373
I will call you Meera.

818
01:17:08,608 --> 01:17:12,218
Father.. who was Meera?

819
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:13,900
Queen of Hearts.

820
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,448
I am asking who was Meera?

821
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:20,968
Meera? Who? Why do you want to know?

822
01:17:21,048 --> 01:17:22,424
Where did you hear this name?

823
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:25,837
No, no! Just like that! Who was she?

824
01:17:26,278 --> 01:17:30,307
She was some crazy girl! She
used to wander around!

825
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:32,028
Why, father?

826
01:17:32,504 --> 01:17:37,498
Its said when she was a child..
A sage arrived.

827
01:17:38,048 --> 01:17:44,506
He gave her a stone and he said..
He is your husband.

828
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:46,757
He is your God.

829
01:17:46,988 --> 01:17:50,291
Since then she used to wander
around with the stone.

830
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:52,558
And she would sing..

831
01:17:52,638 --> 01:17:56,448
You are my Girdhar Gopal.

832
01:17:56,528 --> 01:17:59,291
I don't have anybody else.

833
01:17:59,371 --> 01:18:01,218
Are you going to the temple, dear?

834
01:18:01,638 --> 01:18:07,578
Fine. Go. Nowadays sinners
frequently visit the temple.

835
01:18:08,038 --> 01:18:10,638
It's not a sin to rob rich people.

836
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:15,018
By the way, dear.. my
experience says..

837
01:18:15,618 --> 01:18:19,478
That these religious figures
at times betray God too.

838
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,824
They fill their locker
with real money.

839
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:25,838
And fake money is used at
the temple. And they sing..

840
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:28,624
I sacrifice everything on You.

841
01:18:28,798 --> 01:18:31,593
The magic of money!

842
01:18:36,235 --> 01:18:37,765
Aunt, have milk.

843
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:43,693
- Did you give milk to the priest, dear?
- Yes, aunt.

844
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:22,254
- Have this.
- Not any more, dear. It's enough.

845
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:23,393
Have one.

846
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:25,533
You only eat it.

847
01:19:26,068 --> 01:19:28,055
Already I have put on
weight in my happiness.

848
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:29,975
If you will feed me more,
I will become fatter.

849
01:19:30,301 --> 01:19:33,670
And people will tell you.. that
your mother-in-law is a fatso.

850
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,070
- Uncle.
- Yes.

851
01:19:51,742 --> 01:19:54,198
- From where does sun rise?
- From the east.

852
01:19:54,691 --> 01:19:56,796
Fool, you don't even know that!

853
01:19:57,001 --> 01:20:00,094
I am a fool. But I at least know
from where the sun rises.

854
01:20:00,174 --> 01:20:03,322
No, uncle. At times sun
rises from west too.

855
01:20:05,665 --> 01:20:07,367
Are you mad?

856
01:20:07,892 --> 01:20:11,058
If sun starts rising from west then
this world will turn topsy-turvy.

857
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,850
That is what has happened, uncle!

858
01:20:13,168 --> 01:20:17,034
Initially I thought its some
girl who looks like Reshma.

859
01:20:17,266 --> 01:20:21,458
But no. She was Reshma.

860
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,634
- Where was Reshma?
- At the police inspector's house!

861
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:29,754
What rubbish! Reshma and at
the police inspector's house!

862
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:34,288
"Banwari."

863
01:20:34,682 --> 01:20:41,266
"O Banwari."

864
01:20:42,026 --> 01:20:50,026
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

865
01:20:51,778 --> 01:20:59,778
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

866
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:08,828
"When people were in trouble,
You helped them."

867
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:18,398
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

868
01:21:18,898 --> 01:21:26,818
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

869
01:21:48,848 --> 01:21:54,266
"A prostitute is a sinner
who seduces other men."

870
01:21:54,346 --> 01:21:56,821
"Seduces other men."

871
01:21:56,901 --> 01:22:02,402
"She never did good deeds
and she earned only sin."

872
01:22:02,482 --> 01:22:05,042
"She earned only sin."

873
01:22:05,301 --> 01:22:13,301
"When a parrot chanted your name
once, she attained salvation."

874
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:22,922
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

875
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:31,466
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

876
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:58,706
"Pandavs' wife was
lost in gambling."

877
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:01,304
"Was lost in gambling."

878
01:23:01,438 --> 01:23:06,797
"Wicked Dushasan disrobed her
sari in the crowded assembly."

879
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:09,454
"Disrobed her sari."

880
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:17,709
"You helped her, when
she called You."

881
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:27,288
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

882
01:23:27,757 --> 01:23:35,533
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

883
01:23:46,637 --> 01:23:51,973
"People disrespected Meera
because she loved You."

884
01:23:52,053 --> 01:23:54,559
"People disrespected her."

885
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:00,049
"King sent her a box of snake."

886
01:24:00,129 --> 01:24:02,768
"Sent her a box of snake."

887
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:08,171
"The snake's poison became nectar."

888
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:12,651
"Your ways are unique."

889
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:20,211
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

890
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:28,251
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

891
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:37,539
"When people were in trouble,
You helped them."

892
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:46,795
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

893
01:24:47,403 --> 01:24:55,403
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

894
01:25:04,048 --> 01:25:05,863
Dear, you wait. I will check out.

895
01:25:16,214 --> 01:25:19,207
- Come! Come, Mr. Ashok!
- Greetings, sister-in-law!

896
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:22,279
- Now how are you?
- Now I am fine.

897
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:25,172
Mohan got really worried!

898
01:25:25,515 --> 01:25:27,176
Why are you talking about
that mad fellow?

899
01:25:27,348 --> 01:25:30,734
He gets worried even if
I am in a bit of pain.

900
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:34,901
- Dear! Bring the offering!
- Yes, aunt!

901
01:25:35,957 --> 01:25:39,101
Sister-in-law, whether your
health is good or not..

902
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:42,797
Be it storm or tempest, but you
always perform the veneration.

903
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:21,746
Greet him, dear. He
is like your father.

904
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:24,351
God bless you!

905
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:37,052
- What's your name?
- Reshma.

906
01:26:37,379 --> 01:26:39,619
Go, dear. Make tea for him.

907
01:26:42,889 --> 01:26:46,753
Had my daughter been alive.. she
would have been of her age.

908
01:26:47,143 --> 01:26:51,053
- Listen! Don't add sugar in his tea!
- Okay!

909
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:57,989
- Have a seat, Mr. Ashok.
- Sister-in-law, who is she?

910
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,804
She is the girl whom Mohan loves.

911
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:04,143
Now you will have to make all
the wedding arrangement!

912
01:27:04,223 --> 01:27:08,032
Why not? Since when I have
been waiting for this.

913
01:27:08,954 --> 01:27:11,071
A girl like her should be
your daughter-in-law.

914
01:27:11,774 --> 01:27:15,602
Hats off to Mohan's choice!

915
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,250
Come, dear.

916
01:27:22,782 --> 01:27:23,916
Have a seat.

917
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:37,191
- This is so sweet!
- But I didn't add sugar, father!

918
01:27:39,317 --> 01:27:43,173
Father? You called me father.

919
01:27:43,973 --> 01:27:46,117
It has made this tea sweeter!

920
01:27:50,107 --> 01:27:54,141
Look, dear. You will serve
your mother-in-law.

921
01:27:55,107 --> 01:27:57,789
But don't forget this lonely man..

922
01:27:58,237 --> 01:28:00,253
Whom you just called father.

923
01:28:03,354 --> 01:28:05,749
Someday I would like
to meet your father.

924
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:10,469
Don't worry, dear. I will
implore for your hands.

925
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:15,821
She is a shy girl!

926
01:28:19,887 --> 01:28:26,445
God.. how do I tell them..
What my real form is.

927
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,165
Dear! Mr. Ashok is leaving!

928
01:28:32,981 --> 01:28:34,621
Shall I tell you something,
sister-in-law?

929
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:39,180
Since the time I saw her..
She has won my heart.

930
01:28:39,787 --> 01:28:41,266
She is a sweet girl.

931
01:28:44,325 --> 01:28:45,613
God bless you, dear.

932
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:51,542
Bye, sister-in-law! I had brought
some fruits. I just forgot!

933
01:28:52,012 --> 01:28:53,669
You never come empty-handed.

934
01:28:53,749 --> 01:28:55,703
It's in the car. I will just get it.

935
01:28:55,783 --> 01:28:58,993
Why do you take the trouble?
Dear, you go with him.

936
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:19,233
Dear, take. Give it to your
aunt. And you too eat it.

937
01:29:23,027 --> 01:29:24,027
God bless you.

938
01:29:31,687 --> 01:29:33,831
Father.. when will you come again?

939
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:39,107
Father? Dear.. when you will
come in this house as..

940
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:43,483
Daughter-in-law then
I will come everyday.

941
01:30:07,387 --> 01:30:12,882
Now I understood why that inspector
had come here that day!

942
01:30:13,654 --> 01:30:17,348
You think you can fool your father?

943
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:19,583
Tell me! Why did you go there?

944
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,391
- His mother is sick.
- What do you care?

945
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,145
- How are you related to her?
- In every way!

946
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:29,911
- In every way! More than your father!
- More than my father!

947
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:34,543
Yes! More than you!

948
01:30:34,787 --> 01:30:37,567
Till date you have kept
me in the dark!

949
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:44,199
She has shown me the path.. that
is away from your world of sin!

950
01:30:45,387 --> 01:30:49,263
So pure.. so chaste!

951
01:30:50,183 --> 01:30:57,255
- She called me.. a sinner.. A culprit, Meera!
- Meera?

952
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,087
A thief and Meera!

953
01:31:03,354 --> 01:31:07,079
Father, laugh! Laugh
as much as you want!

954
01:31:07,553 --> 01:31:11,040
You are stuck in the marsh where
you can't see anything good..

955
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,575
Hear anything good or
speak anything good!

956
01:31:17,487 --> 01:31:22,863
I can't even be compared to
the dust at Meera's feet.

957
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:30,921
But now I will never walk
on the path shown by you!

958
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,521
You will have to walk on it.

959
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:39,437
Your life began with stealing.
And it will end there.

960
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,274
No, no!

961
01:31:41,354 --> 01:31:45,181
It's not as easy to
say no as you think!

962
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:50,181
Your eyes will open when you will
see inspector's life in danger.

963
01:31:50,261 --> 01:31:55,951
- Father!
- I won't say anything to you!

964
01:31:56,651 --> 01:32:01,307
- But inspector will die.
- No, father! For God's sake.

965
01:32:01,387 --> 01:32:04,129
You and I will be sitting
comfortably at home.

966
01:32:04,671 --> 01:32:08,715
And we will receive the news that
the inspector is no more.

967
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:15,691
No evidence, no witness.
And he.. he will be dead.

968
01:32:18,053 --> 01:32:20,179
You love him, don't you?

969
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:25,067
Do you want him to
die a brutal death?

970
01:32:27,387 --> 01:32:31,651
If this is what you want..
Then what can I do?

971
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:38,475
Think about it. The
whole night is there.

972
01:32:39,363 --> 01:32:42,859
Think well, Meera!

973
01:32:43,867 --> 01:32:51,867
"I am not good for you, my Girdhari.."

974
01:32:56,595 --> 01:33:02,419
Why did you forget me, Banwari?

975
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:10,987
"Why did you forget me, Banwari?"

976
01:33:16,395 --> 01:33:18,267
Reshma! You are here!

977
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:20,485
I searched for you everywhere.

978
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:23,628
I came to know that you left
without telling mother.

979
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,451
When I returned, mother
was very worried.

980
01:33:26,796 --> 01:33:28,479
She said, go and find
her immediately.

981
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,136
Is my daughter fine?

982
01:33:31,768 --> 01:33:34,059
I don't understand..
How did you forget..

983
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:35,715
That mother is a heart patient.

984
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:39,345
Is this how you will serve
her as her daughter-in-law?

985
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:44,996
Mother is craving to see
you. Come with me!

986
01:33:45,225 --> 01:33:47,972
Leave me! You go!

987
01:33:49,072 --> 01:33:50,160
Go?

988
01:34:02,127 --> 01:34:06,375
- Shall I really leave?
- Yes! Leave!

989
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:10,836
Shall I go? Are you in your senses?

990
01:34:14,059 --> 01:34:15,585
What has happened to you today?

991
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,800
Did somebody say anything to you?

992
01:34:18,092 --> 01:34:20,544
For God's sake, leave me alone!

993
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:25,412
Go away from my life! Forever!

994
01:34:25,492 --> 01:34:27,181
We don't have any relationship!

995
01:34:27,796 --> 01:34:29,063
No relationship?

996
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:33,894
Reshma, you are saying this? You?

997
01:34:35,282 --> 01:34:38,360
Is this as easy as you think it is?

998
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:41,440
I have loved you!

999
01:34:42,306 --> 01:34:46,549
Without caring for what you
are and what your stature is!

1000
01:34:47,992 --> 01:34:51,467
I should have known.. that a girl..

1001
01:34:51,547 --> 01:34:53,548
From a filthy hamlet doesn't love.

1002
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:56,256
She only plays a charade.

1003
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,359
You are a derogatory woman!

1004
01:34:59,856 --> 01:35:01,608
Only that filthy surrounding
suits you!

1005
01:35:02,212 --> 01:35:06,124
You are filth! You
deserve only filth!

1006
01:35:07,092 --> 01:35:08,515
You don't deserve to be loved!

1007
01:35:08,981 --> 01:35:12,150
Yes! Yes! I am filth!
I deserve only filth!

1008
01:35:12,396 --> 01:35:16,019
I don't love anything!
I only play a charade!

1009
01:35:16,099 --> 01:35:19,681
I am a derogatory woman
and other filthy things!

1010
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,545
But what do you care?

1011
01:35:22,888 --> 01:35:27,329
What do I care? You reject my love
and you say what do I care?

1012
01:35:27,912 --> 01:35:29,421
Shameless! Insolent!

1013
01:35:29,984 --> 01:35:34,087
Forget my love.. you don't
even deserve my hatred!

1014
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:41,863
- What have you done?
- Shamli!

1015
01:35:43,925 --> 01:35:45,325
What could I have done, Shamli?

1016
01:35:45,722 --> 01:35:49,894
I had no other way to
save Mohan from father!

1017
01:35:50,246 --> 01:35:53,362
- Reshma!
- There was no other way!

1018
01:35:56,819 --> 01:35:57,990
Reshma!

1019
01:35:59,782 --> 01:36:01,773
Meera has come!

1020
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,874
Today again you went to the temple!

1021
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:11,001
Met your beloved?

1022
01:36:11,845 --> 01:36:13,815
When has he called you next?

1023
01:36:16,455 --> 01:36:18,223
When will this sweet
union happen again?

1024
01:36:18,655 --> 01:36:22,631
Answer me! You think it
was my empty threats!

1025
01:36:23,095 --> 01:36:26,231
And inspector won't be harmed!

1026
01:36:27,383 --> 01:36:32,679
You don't know.. many years
ago an inspector..

1027
01:36:32,759 --> 01:36:35,087
Had done this to me.

1028
01:36:35,799 --> 01:36:38,463
I ruined him!

1029
01:36:39,092 --> 01:36:43,781
And now this inspector.. is
snatching my daughter..

1030
01:36:44,201 --> 01:36:46,381
My support from me!

1031
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:51,611
- So he will have to lose his life!
- No! No, father!

1032
01:36:54,192 --> 01:36:55,823
Do you want to know
how I will kill him?

1033
01:36:56,439 --> 01:36:59,647
Do you want to know
how I will kill him?

1034
01:37:02,727 --> 01:37:07,845
- This is how I will kill your beloved!
- No! Father!

1035
01:37:07,925 --> 01:37:09,012
No, father! No!

1036
01:37:09,092 --> 01:37:12,575
No father, for god sake.

1037
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:15,071
Father!

1038
01:37:16,335 --> 01:37:19,647
Now only one of us will
live! Me or him!

1039
01:37:20,511 --> 01:37:21,711
- No, father!
- Move!

1040
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,615
No, father!

1041
01:37:28,231 --> 01:37:29,551
Come on!

1042
01:37:30,992 --> 01:37:32,791
Father, open the door!

1043
01:37:33,871 --> 01:37:36,199
For God's sake, open the door!

1044
01:37:36,879 --> 01:37:38,912
Father, open the door!

1045
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:41,479
- Reshma! Reshma!
- Father!

1046
01:37:42,103 --> 01:37:45,712
Jaggi! Jaggi! Jaggi! Release me!

1047
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:48,345
For God's sake! I beg you, Jaggi!

1048
01:37:48,559 --> 01:37:50,479
Otherwise a terrible thing
will occur! I beg you!

1049
01:37:53,788 --> 01:37:54,626
What happened?

1050
01:37:54,706 --> 01:37:56,172
Father is very angry, Jaggi!

1051
01:37:56,482 --> 01:37:59,835
He has gone to kill inspector!
I will have to save him!

1052
01:38:00,021 --> 01:38:02,101
I have to save him!

1053
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:04,891
Where are you going there?
Your father went there!

1054
01:38:04,915 --> 01:38:06,610
Go from here! You will
reach sooner! Go!

1055
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:21,921
Come on!

1056
01:38:22,011 --> 01:38:23,081
Coming.

1057
01:38:26,815 --> 01:38:28,217
You hide here.

1058
01:38:31,151 --> 01:38:33,808
Congratulations for the girl. Go!

1059
01:38:36,947 --> 01:38:37,947
Darling!

1060
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:40,899
Jaggi!

1061
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:44,653
Jaggi is not a fool that I will
let you go to your enemy!

1062
01:38:45,182 --> 01:38:47,297
I have brought you here to
make you mine, beloved!

1063
01:38:47,377 --> 01:38:48,377
Ruffian!

1064
01:38:54,033 --> 01:38:55,220
Leave me!

1065
01:38:55,886 --> 01:38:59,404
Jaggi! I am like your sister!
Your sister!

1066
01:38:59,484 --> 01:39:03,181
Not sister.. say wife!

1067
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,107
- Leave me! Leave me!
- You can't escape!

1068
01:39:14,981 --> 01:39:16,013
Shameless!

1069
01:39:24,563 --> 01:39:28,751
- Help! Leave me! Leave me!
- Call your God!

1070
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:31,665
- Call your God!
- Leave me!

1071
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:35,841
Ruffian! Goon!

1072
01:39:44,549 --> 01:39:46,102
- Shout! Scream!
- Leave me.

1073
01:39:46,182 --> 01:39:50,290
You wretched woman,
where will you escape?

1074
01:40:30,348 --> 01:40:34,707
Mother! Mother!

1075
01:40:35,969 --> 01:40:37,440
Where is Mohan, mother?

1076
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,718
What happened?

1077
01:40:40,415 --> 01:40:42,862
You and so late in the night!

1078
01:40:43,348 --> 01:40:45,402
Oh my God! What is this? Blood!

1079
01:40:45,482 --> 01:40:49,903
No, mother! No! Don't touch
me! I killed him, mother!

1080
01:40:50,364 --> 01:40:52,347
I killed Jaggi!

1081
01:40:53,115 --> 01:40:56,518
I was coming to save Mohan!
His life is in danger!

1082
01:40:57,715 --> 01:41:00,095
I trusted Jaggi, mother!

1083
01:41:00,812 --> 01:41:04,798
But that goon.. he tried to rape me!

1084
01:41:05,739 --> 01:41:10,263
There was nobody to
help me.. or hear me.

1085
01:41:10,884 --> 01:41:12,449
Even God was not there, mother.

1086
01:41:12,529 --> 01:41:14,122
Even God was not there!

1087
01:41:14,715 --> 01:41:19,369
To save myself.. I killed
him! I killed him!

1088
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:23,031
Yes, you have committed a murder!
You are a murderer!

1089
01:41:23,632 --> 01:41:27,220
Mohan! Are you fine, Mohan?

1090
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:30,961
You don't know that your
life is in danger!

1091
01:41:32,164 --> 01:41:35,434
Danger? My life or your life?

1092
01:41:35,594 --> 01:41:36,680
Beware if you touched her!

1093
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,844
Mother, move! She has
committed a murder!

1094
01:41:39,227 --> 01:41:40,538
I have to do my duty.

1095
01:41:40,707 --> 01:41:43,805
You and your duty! She has
not committed any murder!

1096
01:41:44,046 --> 01:41:46,219
A woman can do anything
to save herself!

1097
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,690
But she can't take law in her hands.

1098
01:41:48,859 --> 01:41:51,802
Law? What law? Which law?

1099
01:41:52,145 --> 01:41:53,726
Is there any law above religion?

1100
01:41:54,227 --> 01:41:57,128
Where was your law when an
innocent girl was crying..

1101
01:41:57,208 --> 01:42:00,178
And screaming to save
herself from being raped?

1102
01:42:00,694 --> 01:42:02,574
You want that she should
have let him rape her..

1103
01:42:02,646 --> 01:42:04,842
And then she should have
gone to law for help?

1104
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:08,687
Could your law have
restored her honour?

1105
01:42:08,978 --> 01:42:10,287
Answer me! Now tell me!

1106
01:42:11,093 --> 01:42:14,578
- Protector of law! Say something!
- Mother!

1107
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:16,866
I am your mother, am I not?

1108
01:42:17,112 --> 01:42:20,245
Had I been in her place, then I
too would have done what she did.

1109
01:42:20,493 --> 01:42:22,336
Mother, don't forget that
she has committed a murder.

1110
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,092
You are harping about murder!

1111
01:42:24,493 --> 01:42:25,603
If she had not committed
the murder..

1112
01:42:25,627 --> 01:42:27,307
Then it would have
amounted to a murder.

1113
01:42:27,394 --> 01:42:29,067
She would have ruined herself.

1114
01:42:29,147 --> 01:42:33,434
Don't forget! She was coming
to save your life!

1115
01:42:33,879 --> 01:42:36,300
Fate put her into trouble!

1116
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:41,030
Ungrateful one! If this is how you
want to repay her sacrifice..

1117
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:42,760
Then what are you waiting for?

1118
01:42:43,179 --> 01:42:48,141
Fulfil your duty! Handcuff
her! Do it!

1119
01:42:48,555 --> 01:42:49,679
- Mother!
- Mother!

1120
01:42:49,759 --> 01:42:51,352
Mother! Mother!

1121
01:43:13,527 --> 01:43:19,508
Dear.. I don't know what
law considers you as.

1122
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:25,423
But for me.. you are
that same Meera.

1123
01:43:25,925 --> 01:43:29,743
Pure and chaste as the Ganges.

1124
01:43:31,627 --> 01:43:35,734
Whether my blessing is
with my son or not..

1125
01:43:35,814 --> 01:43:39,810
But it will always be with you.

1126
01:43:40,777 --> 01:43:41,933
Mother!

1127
01:43:43,379 --> 01:43:50,979
In this world filled with sin..
I saw only one temple, mother.

1128
01:43:51,656 --> 01:43:58,259
Just one. And you are that temple,
mother! It's you!

1129
01:44:01,327 --> 01:44:05,133
After receiving your blessing,
even if I die..

1130
01:44:05,911 --> 01:44:07,991
Then I will consider it
as God's offering, mother!

1131
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:09,698
I will consider it
as God's offering!

1132
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:14,207
Mother!

1133
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:28,677
"If I am a thief, then handcuff me
and take me to the police station."

1134
01:44:28,757 --> 01:44:36,757
Arrest me! Make me yours!

1135
01:44:37,446 --> 01:44:44,855
Beloved, if you get me punished,
it will be a priceless gift.

1136
01:44:45,828 --> 01:44:51,306
No, Shamli! No! This is not
possible! This is not possible!

1137
01:44:52,427 --> 01:44:56,975
Never! Reshma can't commit a murder!

1138
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:03,380
My daughter can't commit a murder!

1139
01:45:10,194 --> 01:45:13,766
Never! Never!

1140
01:45:15,425 --> 01:45:20,717
"What we call as world,
it's all our karma."

1141
01:45:21,027 --> 01:45:26,514
"As you sow, so shall you reap."

1142
01:45:26,594 --> 01:45:31,877
"What we call as world,
it's all our karma."

1143
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:37,650
"As you sow, so shall you reap."

1144
01:45:38,356 --> 01:45:46,356
"What had you sowed, human?"

1145
01:45:48,376 --> 01:45:51,208
"What had you sowed, human?"

1146
01:45:51,341 --> 01:45:56,717
"Your soul and God too knows."

1147
01:45:56,860 --> 01:46:02,426
"Your soul knows the
saga of your karma."

1148
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:07,157
"Even God knows."

1149
01:46:08,759 --> 01:46:10,913
- Father, you have come!
- Dear!

1150
01:46:11,211 --> 01:46:14,517
What happened? You are crying?

1151
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,198
Reshma! My child!

1152
01:46:18,618 --> 01:46:23,438
- What has happened?
- Father, its right.

1153
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:26,640
After all every daughter has
to leave her father's house..

1154
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,819
Someday and go to live
in another house.

1155
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:32,619
So this house is not bad.

1156
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:36,461
You are unnecessarily getting
dejected, father.

1157
01:46:36,756 --> 01:46:40,546
To tell you the truth, here I
have no worry and no problem.

1158
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:44,488
No work. Only rest.

1159
01:46:45,055 --> 01:46:47,426
I get enough meal thrice a day.

1160
01:46:47,697 --> 01:46:50,057
And a readymade bed to sleep.

1161
01:46:51,244 --> 01:46:52,442
And look at the sheet.

1162
01:46:52,657 --> 01:46:54,664
When I put this sheet
on myself and sleep..

1163
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,473
I forget everything.

1164
01:46:57,818 --> 01:46:58,863
This!

1165
01:47:00,646 --> 01:47:04,269
This gap! I have deliberately
made this!

1166
01:47:04,678 --> 01:47:06,814
So that I get some air from the gap.

1167
01:47:10,746 --> 01:47:14,173
Oh my! I forgot one thing!

1168
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:15,700
Father comes to daughter's house.

1169
01:47:15,918 --> 01:47:17,843
And daughter doesn't
even offer food.

1170
01:47:18,246 --> 01:47:21,018
I will just get one loaf of
bread and some lentils.

1171
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:26,465
Father, today I was famished!

1172
01:47:26,813 --> 01:47:30,290
I had got three loaves
of bread! I eat two!

1173
01:47:30,446 --> 01:47:32,195
Only one is left!

1174
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:36,311
Eat it! Eat it!

1175
01:47:36,597 --> 01:47:38,241
Eat it from my hand!

1176
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:44,153
Oh! I understood! How can father
eat at daughter's house?

1177
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:46,646
Eat it! You can pay me!

1178
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:51,356
Dear, forgive me! Dear, forgive me!

1179
01:47:53,588 --> 01:47:59,890
A father like me has
given you prison!

1180
01:48:02,013 --> 01:48:04,309
Father, shall I ask you something?

1181
01:48:05,313 --> 01:48:08,784
I have heard that before hanging
the prisoner on the noose..

1182
01:48:08,927 --> 01:48:10,801
He is blindfolded.

1183
01:48:11,604 --> 01:48:13,647
It must be so dark.

1184
01:48:14,413 --> 01:48:19,131
I am not afraid of death.
But darkness scares me.

1185
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:23,308
Father, is death darker
than darkness?

1186
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:28,971
It is terrifying? Father,
do you remember?

1187
01:48:29,314 --> 01:48:32,791
When I used to play blind man's
buff with you as a child..

1188
01:48:32,871 --> 01:48:37,225
I would search for you
with my eyes closed.

1189
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:41,007
Father, knowing that you are
standing close to me..

1190
01:48:41,087 --> 01:48:44,592
Frightened by the darkness..

1191
01:48:45,335 --> 01:48:49,410
And now when even you won't
be with me, father.. then..

1192
01:49:08,113 --> 01:49:11,696
I myself misunderstood her!
I wanted Mohan to marry her!

1193
01:49:12,146 --> 01:49:15,727
Good.. her real form
was revealed to us!

1194
01:49:15,926 --> 01:49:21,100
Sir.. my daughter is innocent!
My soul is the witness!

1195
01:49:21,353 --> 01:49:22,944
The one whom you consider
as innocent..

1196
01:49:23,246 --> 01:49:25,567
She has accepted in the court
that she is a murderer.

1197
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,300
She is a stigma on womanhood!

1198
01:49:28,884 --> 01:49:29,884
You were blind!

1199
01:49:30,275 --> 01:49:32,199
Had I been her father
in your place..

1200
01:49:32,534 --> 01:49:34,377
Then I would have myself
strangulated her!

1201
01:49:35,043 --> 01:49:37,566
You may leave! I can't
do anything for you!

1202
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:51,113
"It's enough that you have
come to God's place."

1203
01:49:51,364 --> 01:49:53,172
"No need to say anything."

1204
01:49:53,252 --> 01:49:56,823
"Your repentance is enough."

1205
01:49:56,903 --> 01:50:02,024
"It's enough that you have
come to God's place."

1206
01:50:02,311 --> 01:50:04,166
"No need to say anything."

1207
01:50:04,246 --> 01:50:07,881
"Your repentance is enough."

1208
01:50:08,246 --> 01:50:15,084
"Whatever problems you
want to tell, human."

1209
01:50:15,164 --> 01:50:17,677
"Human."

1210
01:50:18,013 --> 01:50:20,866
"Whatever problems you
want to tell, human."

1211
01:50:20,946 --> 01:50:26,364
"Your soul and God too knows."

1212
01:50:26,492 --> 01:50:31,933
"Your soul knows the
saga of your karma."

1213
01:50:32,013 --> 01:50:36,297
"Even God knows."

1214
01:50:39,681 --> 01:50:43,807
God.. what game are You playing?

1215
01:50:47,816 --> 01:50:51,973
The girl whom I had abducted with
the intention to seek vengeance..

1216
01:50:55,097 --> 01:51:00,943
I had never thought that
she will win my heart.

1217
01:51:01,987 --> 01:51:07,927
Save her, God. For Your
sake! Save her!

1218
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:14,414
Sinner, you didn't pickpocket..
You didn't steal my money!

1219
01:51:14,588 --> 01:51:16,374
You have snatched
my children's food!

1220
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:20,033
You are characterless! You
are a stigma on womanhood!

1221
01:51:20,295 --> 01:51:23,758
Because of you, my children
couldn't complete their education!

1222
01:51:23,946 --> 01:51:27,366
Murderer! You didn't
steal my wallet!

1223
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:30,128
You have killed my ailing wife!

1224
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:32,016
Shame on you!

1225
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:38,268
You have killed my ailing wife!

1226
01:51:38,413 --> 01:51:40,199
You are a stigma on womanhood!

1227
01:51:40,279 --> 01:51:41,801
You are characterless!

1228
01:51:42,313 --> 01:51:47,017
Liar! Shameless!
You have killed my ailing wife!

1229
01:51:47,097 --> 01:51:50,364
You are a murderer, a sinner!

1230
01:52:00,135 --> 01:52:05,240
Yes! I am a sinner!
I am characterless!

1231
01:52:07,589 --> 01:52:12,913
I don't want to live! I don't
want to live! I want to die!

1232
01:52:13,649 --> 01:52:15,244
You want to die?

1233
01:52:16,556 --> 01:52:19,045
It's very easy for you to die!

1234
01:52:20,207 --> 01:52:25,580
The law says if a woman
kills somebody..

1235
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:27,733
To save herself from being raped..

1236
01:52:27,813 --> 01:52:29,246
Then she is not a murderer.

1237
01:52:29,503 --> 01:52:32,337
If you don't give this testimony
in the court..

1238
01:52:32,497 --> 01:52:35,638
That you killed Jaggi
to save yourself..

1239
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:37,206
Then you are a murderer.

1240
01:52:37,462 --> 01:52:39,817
Then who can save you
from death penalty?

1241
01:52:45,132 --> 01:52:48,212
I am Reshma. Bhagat
Sadhuram's daughter.

1242
01:52:48,892 --> 01:52:50,588
I have murdered Jaggi.

1243
01:52:50,788 --> 01:52:54,587
- Do you want to say anything in your defence?
- No.

1244
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:59,428
Do you know the outcome of not
saying anything in your defence?

1245
01:53:00,444 --> 01:53:02,626
Yes. Death.

1246
01:53:02,706 --> 01:53:07,084
But law can't punish anybody till
the time the crime is not proved.

1247
01:53:07,164 --> 01:53:08,772
Do you have any lawyer?

1248
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:13,060
Why? For what? To
save me from death?

1249
01:53:13,716 --> 01:53:17,188
I am going to die, judge.
And you are getting scared.

1250
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:21,955
That is not so. Law says that
you should have a lawyer.

1251
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:27,188
Your Honour, I would like
to be her lawyer.

1252
01:53:28,284 --> 01:53:29,450
I know this girl.

1253
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:34,676
And I know the reason
why she wants to die.

1254
01:53:35,192 --> 01:53:36,250
Your qualification.

1255
01:53:36,783 --> 01:53:37,936
I am a lawyer.

1256
01:53:39,018 --> 01:53:41,385
For Mahatma Gandhi's
Quit India movement..

1257
01:53:41,725 --> 01:53:43,419
I gave up law practice.

1258
01:53:44,494 --> 01:53:47,183
But today this lost girl's
dangerous intentions..

1259
01:53:47,822 --> 01:53:49,915
Has forced me to break my oath.

1260
01:53:50,925 --> 01:53:52,769
I want the permission
to be her lawyer.

1261
01:53:53,358 --> 01:53:54,612
Permission granted.

1262
01:53:54,692 --> 01:53:58,534
Baba.. you are saying this? You?

1263
01:53:59,098 --> 01:54:03,602
Knowing that who am I and
what my real form is!

1264
01:54:04,863 --> 01:54:09,189
Maybe you forgot. But
I have not forgotten.

1265
01:54:10,192 --> 01:54:11,505
You only had said.

1266
01:54:12,836 --> 01:54:16,753
This land has given birth
to great women..

1267
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:19,653
Like Sita, Savitri and Meera.

1268
01:54:20,638 --> 01:54:23,973
The daughter of that land
does this dirty work..

1269
01:54:24,901 --> 01:54:26,693
It doesn't suit her!

1270
01:54:27,377 --> 01:54:29,301
Still you want me to live!

1271
01:54:29,445 --> 01:54:33,713
Yes, dear. No matter how this
life is.. its God's gift.

1272
01:54:34,225 --> 01:54:37,412
Living it is the biggest
penance. This life..

1273
01:54:37,492 --> 01:54:44,664
Life! You call my
life as life, Baba?

1274
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:49,788
If this is life.. then
how will death be like?

1275
01:54:51,725 --> 01:54:56,001
No matter how terrifying
death is.. but..

1276
01:54:57,692 --> 01:54:59,354
It will at least be
better than life.

1277
01:55:00,583 --> 01:55:02,969
I understand your pain, dear.

1278
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:08,069
But I also know.. that the
one who can ruin life..

1279
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:10,116
He can even flourish life!

1280
01:55:11,725 --> 01:55:16,162
Have faith, dear. God will
make everything fine.

1281
01:55:16,658 --> 01:55:21,593
God? Which God are you talking
about, Baba? Him?

1282
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:26,112
Where was your God.. when
an innocent girl..

1283
01:55:26,192 --> 01:55:28,327
Was forced to commit crimes.

1284
01:55:29,303 --> 01:55:35,484
She cried.. she implored.. but
your God didn't pay heed!

1285
01:55:36,425 --> 01:55:41,979
She was raised in the sinful
world of Jaggi and Nathu!

1286
01:55:42,798 --> 01:55:45,178
Where nobody knows you and
nobody wants to know you!

1287
01:55:45,332 --> 01:55:47,981
Who was Sita? Who was Meera?

1288
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,846
When she learned to live
in that world of crime..

1289
01:55:53,225 --> 01:55:57,683
Then your God suddenly
showed her the path..

1290
01:55:58,458 --> 01:56:04,385
That could lead her towards
truth.. and good deeds.

1291
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:07,943
I am ruined, Baba.

1292
01:56:08,647 --> 01:56:10,234
I am ruined.

1293
01:56:11,322 --> 01:56:13,607
The sinful world from
where I have come..

1294
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:15,578
I don't want to return there!

1295
01:56:15,978 --> 01:56:18,645
I want to go to the
world of goodness.

1296
01:56:18,725 --> 01:56:22,835
But I can't go there! Baba, you go!

1297
01:56:23,125 --> 01:56:24,978
For God's sake, leave!

1298
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:30,904
To live it's very important
to die once!

1299
01:56:36,915 --> 01:56:40,090
The thing is that if she won't
say anything in her defence..

1300
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,810
Then it's impossible to save her.

1301
01:56:43,058 --> 01:56:45,906
Lawyer, if that is the case..
Then there is only one person..

1302
01:56:45,986 --> 01:56:47,787
Whom she can't refuse.

1303
01:56:48,152 --> 01:56:50,430
- And he is Mohan.
- Mohan!

1304
01:56:50,658 --> 01:56:53,010
You will have to say in the
court what you told mother!

1305
01:56:53,325 --> 01:56:55,355
You murdered Jaggi to save yourself.

1306
01:56:55,435 --> 01:56:58,378
No, no! I can't say that!

1307
01:56:59,658 --> 01:57:01,693
Do you know what will
be the outcome?

1308
01:57:02,058 --> 01:57:06,755
Yes. Death. Death penalty.

1309
01:57:07,725 --> 01:57:10,276
Don't I have any right
over your life?

1310
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:16,068
You have taken the decision
to die! What about me?

1311
01:57:18,404 --> 01:57:20,029
Have you ever thought?

1312
01:57:22,158 --> 01:57:26,349
No, mother! No! I can't say this!

1313
01:57:27,725 --> 01:57:30,653
Jaggi's murder has been a blessing
in disguise, mother.

1314
01:57:31,517 --> 01:57:35,517
Now I don't want to live.
I don't want to live.

1315
01:57:35,981 --> 01:57:40,269
Dear, you don't know. With great
difficulty we get human birth.

1316
01:57:40,597 --> 01:57:42,645
We get this human body.

1317
01:57:43,445 --> 01:57:48,773
I wish.. you knew, mother..
I have committed..

1318
01:57:49,157 --> 01:57:51,477
Such bad deeds in this birth.

1319
01:57:52,201 --> 01:57:54,191
I have committed so many sins.

1320
01:57:55,689 --> 01:58:00,278
These hands.. which
worshipped your God..

1321
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:06,151
I offered flowers on His feet..
With these hands..

1322
01:58:07,085 --> 01:58:12,325
I have stolen countless
people's hard earned money.

1323
01:58:13,541 --> 01:58:17,657
I have snatched food
from their children.

1324
01:58:21,055 --> 01:58:24,702
The girl whom you considered
as Meera..

1325
01:58:25,163 --> 01:58:28,017
She is a characterless
woman, a sinner!

1326
01:58:28,587 --> 01:58:33,099
She is a pickpocket girl.

1327
01:58:33,496 --> 01:58:37,554
Yes, mother. She is a
stigma on womanhood!

1328
01:58:38,225 --> 01:58:41,138
She is a burden on this earth!

1329
01:58:42,623 --> 01:58:47,945
I.. I have no right to live,
mother! I have no right!

1330
01:58:48,203 --> 01:58:49,694
I have no right!

1331
01:58:49,958 --> 01:58:54,935
Dear.. no person has a right
to play with lives.

1332
01:58:55,274 --> 01:58:59,158
What people can't give, they
have no right to take it!

1333
01:59:00,291 --> 01:59:03,022
But this world is filled
with sin, dear.

1334
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:06,669
Who can come out clean from it?

1335
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:14,559
And those who truly repent their
deeds.. God forgives them.

1336
01:59:15,173 --> 01:59:21,212
God might forgive me. But
how can I forgive myself?

1337
01:59:22,244 --> 01:59:28,130
With my stigmatised life.. how
can I live in your house?

1338
01:59:29,058 --> 01:59:30,978
No, mother! No!

1339
01:59:32,124 --> 01:59:34,255
Now I have only one
request from you.

1340
01:59:35,369 --> 01:59:39,343
This wretched daughter has only
one request from her mother.

1341
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,214
You only have flourished
my life, mother.

1342
01:59:44,001 --> 01:59:46,420
Now you only flourish my death!

1343
01:59:48,378 --> 01:59:52,460
After my death.. get Mohan
married to another girl.

1344
01:59:53,407 --> 01:59:57,798
Otherwise my soul will wander.

1345
01:59:59,097 --> 02:00:03,788
- My dear!
- Mother! Mother!

1346
02:00:05,107 --> 02:00:07,112
- Your name?
- Reshma!

1347
02:00:07,461 --> 02:00:09,720
- Father's name?
- Bhagat Sadhuram.

1348
02:00:10,155 --> 02:00:12,011
- Any sibling?
- No.

1349
02:00:12,363 --> 02:00:15,218
Only father and daughter.
Any education?

1350
02:00:17,898 --> 02:00:20,078
What does your father do?

1351
02:00:20,382 --> 02:00:22,812
He is a handicap. So he is useless.

1352
02:00:23,044 --> 02:00:26,091
- Useless? Since when?
- Since ages.

1353
02:00:26,846 --> 02:00:30,270
- Then who meets the household expense?
- I do.

1354
02:00:30,898 --> 02:00:34,366
But you said that you are an
illiterate. Then how do you earn?

1355
02:00:36,452 --> 02:00:38,833
- Do you work in somebody's house?
- No.

1356
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:41,841
- Do you work in some mill?
- No.

1357
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:46,116
- Do you beg?
- No.

1358
02:00:46,557 --> 02:00:50,691
No? Then how do you earn? From
where do you bring the money?

1359
02:00:51,248 --> 02:00:53,852
Tell me! What's your
means of livelihood?

1360
02:00:54,805 --> 02:00:56,015
Your Honour!

1361
02:00:56,579 --> 02:00:58,834
How can the culprit say in this
court in front of her father..

1362
02:00:58,858 --> 02:01:02,786
That she sells her
body and earns money?

1363
02:01:03,112 --> 02:01:04,112
Objection, Your Honour!

1364
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,574
He is slandering my client!

1365
02:01:07,169 --> 02:01:08,358
Objection sustained.

1366
02:01:08,742 --> 02:01:11,267
But why is she not saying
how she earns money?

1367
02:01:11,694 --> 02:01:13,166
What is there to hide?

1368
02:01:19,336 --> 02:01:22,446
Your Honour, her silence
clearly indicates..

1369
02:01:22,664 --> 02:01:23,885
That the culprit sells her body..

1370
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:31,909
I.. I.. I am a thief.

1371
02:01:34,001 --> 02:01:38,347
Your Honour.. note the
culprit's reluctance!

1372
02:01:38,675 --> 02:01:42,083
- Your witness.
- Thank you. I have nothing to say.

1373
02:01:43,309 --> 02:01:46,763
Your Honour.. I would like to
question inspector Mohan.

1374
02:01:47,163 --> 02:01:48,555
Permitted.

1375
02:01:56,955 --> 02:02:02,667
Inspector Mohan.. do you know her?

1376
02:02:06,579 --> 02:02:11,939
- Yes. I only had arrested her.
- Where?

1377
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,299
- In my house.
- In your house?

1378
02:02:15,907 --> 02:02:17,587
But she is accused of murder!

1379
02:02:18,342 --> 02:02:19,785
Was the murder committed
in your house?

1380
02:02:19,809 --> 02:02:23,336
No. Jaggi was murdered
in the jungle.

1381
02:02:23,842 --> 02:02:25,442
She ran and came to
my house for shelter.

1382
02:02:26,576 --> 02:02:29,694
But how did she know your house?

1383
02:02:31,251 --> 02:02:33,017
She frequently visited our house.

1384
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:37,369
- Did you meet her frequently?
- Yes.

1385
02:02:38,509 --> 02:02:42,336
Is it because she is a thief and
you wanted to keep a tab on her?

1386
02:02:43,042 --> 02:02:45,314
I didn't doubt her.

1387
02:02:45,437 --> 02:02:49,977
Strange! An ordinary girl fooled
a capable officer like you?

1388
02:02:50,057 --> 02:02:51,303
Objection, Your Honour!

1389
02:02:51,677 --> 02:02:53,263
It's an amazing thing!

1390
02:02:53,509 --> 02:02:56,444
Such a capable police officer
couldn't recognise a thief?

1391
02:02:56,847 --> 02:03:03,612
Forget it. Inspector.. why did
you take her to your house?

1392
02:03:10,985 --> 02:03:13,509
I wanted to marry her.

1393
02:03:14,103 --> 02:03:15,103
Oh God!

1394
02:03:15,618 --> 02:03:16,694
Wow!

1395
02:03:17,409 --> 02:03:20,303
Your Honour.. an interesting
situation.

1396
02:03:21,619 --> 02:03:27,095
One who protects law.
And one who breaks law.

1397
02:03:27,274 --> 02:03:33,636
Both fall in love! Love
is blind! Love is blind!

1398
02:03:34,309 --> 02:03:39,223
She is a thief. And you
are a police officer.

1399
02:03:39,798 --> 02:03:44,342
Your Honour.. he is
the real culprit!

1400
02:03:45,009 --> 02:03:47,708
He is the one who has committed
Jaggi's murder!

1401
02:03:48,208 --> 02:03:50,363
He should be hanged!

1402
02:03:50,443 --> 02:03:54,837
No! No! This is a lie!
You are lying!

1403
02:03:55,009 --> 02:03:58,595
You are lying! Why are
you punishing me?

1404
02:03:58,894 --> 02:04:02,048
It's a lie! Judge.. he is innocent!

1405
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:06,091
It's not his fault! He didn't
tell me anything!

1406
02:04:06,744 --> 02:04:11,487
The truth is that.. father
was opposed to our love.

1407
02:04:11,803 --> 02:04:14,488
That day father threatened
that he will kill him!

1408
02:04:14,568 --> 02:04:16,294
He locked me in the
house and he left!

1409
02:04:16,748 --> 02:04:18,527
Jaggi and Nathu released me.

1410
02:04:18,675 --> 02:04:20,716
We all were going to warn him!

1411
02:04:20,975 --> 02:04:25,658
On the way Jaggi.. Jaggi..
He tried to rape me!

1412
02:04:26,241 --> 02:04:28,499
I tried to save myself!

1413
02:04:29,142 --> 02:04:34,618
But.. he took out the knife.
I screamed and yelled!

1414
02:04:35,137 --> 02:04:37,633
But nobody heard me!

1415
02:04:38,733 --> 02:04:41,254
In the struggle, I got
hold of the knife!

1416
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:49,019
And I killed Jaggi! I killed
him! To save myself!

1417
02:04:49,099 --> 02:04:52,550
This is the truth, Your Honour!
This is the truth!

1418
02:04:52,909 --> 02:04:55,557
The culprit couldn't
say it in the court!

1419
02:04:56,236 --> 02:04:59,154
I knew that the culprit
loves inspector.

1420
02:04:59,403 --> 02:05:01,758
If he is in trouble, then she
will spill out the truth.

1421
02:05:02,367 --> 02:05:05,311
I tried to falsely accuse
him. I had to do this.

1422
02:05:05,932 --> 02:05:08,414
Because this was the only
option left for me..

1423
02:05:08,721 --> 02:05:11,480
To make her spill out the truth.

1424
02:05:11,984 --> 02:05:14,718
Reshma's statement reveals that..

1425
02:05:15,184 --> 02:05:17,732
There is an eye witness
of this incident.

1426
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,002
She has called him as Nathu.

1427
02:05:22,225 --> 02:05:25,193
The court is adjourned
till the time..

1428
02:05:25,366 --> 02:05:28,573
That witness is not
presented in the court.

1429
02:05:35,501 --> 02:05:37,773
My darling!

1430
02:06:04,076 --> 02:06:08,005
Old man! Your death
has brought you here!

1431
02:08:55,192 --> 02:08:59,475
Your Honour! I saw Jaggi's murder!

1432
02:08:59,788 --> 02:09:01,754
I myself saw it!

1433
02:09:02,061 --> 02:09:05,177
But sir, I have no hand
in this murder!

1434
02:09:05,257 --> 02:09:08,362
I swear, sir! I have
no hand in this!

1435
02:09:08,882 --> 02:09:10,192
On the night of the murder,
when all three of us..

1436
02:09:10,216 --> 02:09:12,972
Reached the jungle,
Jaggi told me to wait.

1437
02:09:13,249 --> 02:09:16,633
I waited. When I glanced
from behind a tree then..

1438
02:10:03,011 --> 02:10:04,875
- 'Scoundrel!
- Move!'

1439
02:10:18,251 --> 02:10:24,531
'Oh no! Oh no!'

1440
02:10:36,282 --> 02:10:40,636
The court acquits Reshma.

1441
02:10:40,716 --> 02:10:45,419
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle,
Reshma has been acquitted!

1442
02:10:45,499 --> 02:10:46,739
Reshma has been acquitted!

1443
02:10:47,035 --> 02:10:49,843
Father! Father!

1444
02:10:50,382 --> 02:10:55,907
- No! No! Don't touch me! I am a sinner!
- Father!

1445
02:10:56,216 --> 02:11:01,995
I am not a father. I am
a stigma on fatherhood.

1446
02:11:03,249 --> 02:11:06,971
Otherwise no father would
make an innocent child..

1447
02:11:07,051 --> 02:11:10,859
Who could have lead
a good life, a sinner!

1448
02:11:11,415 --> 02:11:16,195
And forced her to commit
crimes! No! No!

1449
02:11:17,307 --> 02:11:19,171
Commissioner!

1450
02:11:25,069 --> 02:11:28,571
Commissioner, you will remember.

1451
02:11:29,016 --> 02:11:36,691
Many years ago.. you shot
a man in the moving train.

1452
02:11:37,282 --> 02:11:39,803
Because of which he lost his arm.

1453
02:11:40,883 --> 02:11:43,907
I am that man. Look.

1454
02:11:44,949 --> 02:11:48,721
After that your 2 years old
daughter went missing.

1455
02:11:51,082 --> 02:11:54,125
This is her frock. Recognise it.

1456
02:11:56,797 --> 02:11:59,317
Commissioner, she is that child!

1457
02:11:59,541 --> 02:12:02,485
She is not my daughter!
She is your daughter!

1458
02:12:02,682 --> 02:12:05,169
No! No, father!

1459
02:12:05,249 --> 02:12:11,936
Reshma, don't cry! Don't cry,
dear! Don't cry! My dear!

1460
02:12:12,016 --> 02:12:16,021
This is a lie! It's a lie,
father! It's a lie!

1461
02:12:16,249 --> 02:12:19,741
Reshma! My dear!

1462
02:12:20,797 --> 02:12:25,893
Dear.. after losing you for
a few days I realized..

1463
02:12:26,645 --> 02:12:30,885
The pain of separating
from your daughter.

1464
02:12:31,049 --> 02:12:32,335
Father!

1465
02:12:32,717 --> 02:12:39,389
This man has been suffering
for the past 16 years!

1466
02:12:40,882 --> 02:12:44,365
If you had been found guilty,
then the secret..

1467
02:12:44,882 --> 02:12:47,013
That you are commissioner's
daughter..

1468
02:12:47,282 --> 02:12:49,045
It would have remained a secret.

1469
02:12:50,549 --> 02:12:55,461
Dear, don't make me helpless
with your tears.

1470
02:12:56,149 --> 02:13:01,909
Dear.. how long will I carry
the burden of this lie?

1471
02:13:02,389 --> 02:13:06,869
I have ruined my life. Now
at least let me die.

1472
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:12,269
- My dear, come! Come, my dear!
- Father!

1473
02:13:12,349 --> 02:13:16,501
Commissioner, take care
of your daughter!

1474
02:13:32,389 --> 02:13:37,109
Inspector, I know it's so difficult
to fulfil your duty.

1475
02:13:37,637 --> 02:13:40,835
And I also know that you will
always fulfil your duty.

1476
02:13:41,241 --> 02:13:45,102
I have committed many sins!
I should be punished!

1477
02:13:45,479 --> 02:13:47,741
Handcuff me!

1478
02:13:59,049 --> 02:14:04,269
"How people became great
in this world."

1479
02:14:04,589 --> 02:14:09,729
"How sinners became virtuous
in this world."

1480
02:14:10,129 --> 02:14:15,469
"Is there a human who took birth."

1481
02:14:15,789 --> 02:14:20,902
"But who never committed any sin."

1482
02:14:21,239 --> 02:14:26,629
"When your eyes are open,
its dawn for you."

1483
02:14:26,829 --> 02:14:32,302
"The one who forgives everybody,
he is your God."

1484
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:39,639
"Saga of ages, human."

1485
02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:42,479
"Human."

1486
02:14:42,559 --> 02:14:45,319
"Saga of ages, human."

1487
02:14:45,499 --> 02:14:50,899
"Your soul and God too knows."

1488
02:14:50,979 --> 02:14:56,359
"Your soul knows the
saga of your karma."

1489
02:14:56,439 --> 02:14:59,239
"Even God knows."

1490
02:14:59,419 --> 02:15:04,749
"Your soul knows the
saga of your karma."

1491
02:15:04,829 --> 02:15:09,264
"Even God knows."
