Come foI the table meaning,
are you com-foI-tahle?

35
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,093
It's a liteIal translation.

36
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,126
You see, they grew up
in a English sunoundjng...

37
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,762
...hut sometimes their
Iudian-ness comes out...

38
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,440
wand the end Iesult is
a totally diffeIent translation.

39
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,441
So tell me. Maalaya.

40
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,443
You said call the gills.

41
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,342
Now they are heIe, so tell me.

42
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,449

Harsh and

43
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,247
...t0 marry your LhIee daughteIs.

44
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,254
I was thinking they can
have a Wedding in Turkey...

45
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,683
Maalaya, I am the only
ﬁaLheI on this planet...

46
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,993
...W].\0 doesn't Want his
daughteIs to get married.

47
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,100
I will neveI let my
daughteIs marry anyone. . .eveI!

48
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,272
Call it a muse, oI had luck.
I don't know.

49
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,512
But my family's been enduring
this ill-fate foI decades.

50
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,311
Within 3 years ofmarriage,
my patents split.

51
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,109
My darling Wife Halal...

52
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,119
mpassed-away aﬂeI
delivering my ehildlen.

53
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,391
My eldest sisteI, Hausa.

54
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,521
HeI husband divoIced heI
Within 6 months of their marriage.

55
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,730
And my aunt Satla...

56
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,001
...suffeIed a hemonhage aﬂeI
she Ieturned fIom heI honeymoon.

57
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,107
When things keep occurring oﬂcn,
it's called a coincidence.

58
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,437
But if it keeps
Iepeating every time...

59
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,301
mthen it's an indication fIom God.

60
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,404
And a smart man can
undeIstaud an indication.

61
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,644
But Batook,
life without marriage and childlem.

62
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,378
This is the truth, uncle. Believe us.

63
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,682
We'Ie not making kids.

64
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,391
She's sayingmweﬁe not kidding.

65
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,685
Oh my, God!

66
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,485
Pops!

67
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,555
Marriage seems to he out of question.

68
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,065
How about a live-in Ielationship?

69
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:17,967
What did you say?

70
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,664
I heard that.

71
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,695
You bloody pervert!

72
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,269
My son Hulk meant to say...

73
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,969
Your son isn't hulk; he is Iascal!

74
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,173
And you...y0u'Ie not Maalaya
y0u'Ie a bloody scoundlel.

75
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,739
And you aren't Godhavri;
y0u'Ie a Ihino.

76
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,609
Live in Ielation? Get out! Get out!

77
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,708

You have neveI thought
about boys till date.

86
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,235
You LhIee are so naive.

87
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,734
Bottom line,
a person should always he straight.

88
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,736
Becausemeven Taatak Mama's glasses
are upside down.

89
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,312
Goodnight, papa!

But since marriage
isn't possible, then...

369
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,526
Hold on, Teddy. Wait.

370
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,120

1186
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,620
What did I say?

1187
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:40,333
My daughteIs should neveI
know What teats are.

1188
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:42,429
Didn't I say that?

1189
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,434
Is that all you know?
- What do you mean?

1190
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,602
What do you mean?

1191

...Lhe boys your daughteIs

I tried explaining the gills.

1196

I said "Please don't marry Teddy,
Blmty and Sandy".

1197
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:08,595
But foI your daughteIs,
love is blind, love is mute...

1198
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,392

He's an expert in
transporting people upstairs.

1206
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:01,681
He...satisﬁces his hungeI
by feeding oLheIs.

1207

1582
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:22,614
First give me my S0 billion.

1583
01:46:22,677 --> 01:46:24,088
Let's sit down and make a deal.

1584

N0 need to point...

1585
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:26,491
'He's mute, how can he...’

1586
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:27,355
I did.

1587
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:29,558
Should I say it again?

1588
01:46:30,752 --> 01:46:34,097
Let's sit down and make a deal;
no need to point.

1589
01:46:34,155 --> 01:46:35,099
Mimicry artist.

1590
01:46:35,155 --> 01:46:36,293

1593
01:46:38,759 --> 01:46:40,670
TheIe WeIe two of them.

1594
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:41,705
One spoke and the oLheI saw.

1595
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:43,366
Come hack to the S0 billion.

1596
01:46:43,431 --> 01:46:44,705

01:46:52,773 --> 01:46:54,343
I am blind.

1601
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,785
Do I have to explain?

1602
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:58,017
Now listen carefully, Ulja.

1603
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:00,725
You have to take S0 billion fIom him.

1604
01:47:01,048 --> 01:47:01,617
Riglu?

1605
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:05,026

1628
01:48:21,629 --> 01:48:23,040

01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:11,047
mwith Sarah's special kids,

1634
01:49:11,312 --> 01:49:16,728
heI, Jenny, me.
All 3 ofus Ieally got disturbed.

1635
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,655
Then-is one boy, Simon.

1636
01:49:23,157 --> 01:49:24,966
He has a problem with his leg.

1637
01:49:27,528 --> 01:49:29,530
Some boys teased him.

1638
01:49:29,964 --> 01:49:32,410
They made fun of
him because of his leg.

1639
01:49:32,466 --> 01:49:33,570
Made fun ofhim.

1640
01:49:35,102 --> 01:49:38,015
The moment I asked them,
those boys started lying.

1641
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,574
That We didn't imitate him.

1642
01:49:40,207 --> 01:49:43,654
I made them Iealize that
they WeIe completely WIong.

1643
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,055
They WeIe not only mocking
Simon foI being handicapped...

1644
01:49:48,115 --> 01:49:49,685
...hut also lying.

1645
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:57,194
And Lhenmwhen Sarah told us,
What happened with heI...

1646
01:49:58,392 --> 01:50:04,775
...We LhIee Iealized that We've
been doing the same thing with papa.

1647
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:07,403
We've been pretending too.

1648
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:10,578
We've been lying to papa as Well.

1649
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:14,014
And that is Why We'Ie
all heIe to confess.

1650
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:18,384
God, We Ieally love each otheI...

1652

I don't know WheLheI
You'll foIgive us oI not.

1653
01:50:25,152 --> 01:50:27,132
He will foIgive you my childlen.

1654
01:50:28,155 --> 01:50:32,626
Because WhateveI you have done,
you've done it foI one reason.

1655
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:36,039
And that is love. Real love.

01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:40,345
So He will foIgive you.

You always keep saying BJK...ATM...etc...

1850
02:03:18,692 --> 02:03:24,768
I saw Sataswatfs picture

1851
02:03:25,465 --> 02:03:26,739
And While Watching it...

1852

1859
02:03:55,795 --> 02:03:58,469
Every dog is loyal.
