Vaibhav:I spoke to the Pandit yesterday itself.

14
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,840
Mother was saying that an ausipicious date of three months
hence would be correct.

15
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,480
A gap of more than three months doesn't look good.

16
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,160
Especially as you work alone in another town. People make up
stories then, you can understand that.

17
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,880
I'll take care of all the venue bookings as well. I have to
speak to your father as well.

18
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,560
The car has to be booked now by him.

19
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
if we want the delivery by the wedding date.

20
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,880
I'll take a leave from office also for the wedding.

21
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
For the wedding and honeymoon, 15 days should suffice.

22
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,560
My friends were saying that we should go to Goa for the
bachelors party.

23
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,440
You do one thing, come over next week.

24
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,640
Mother needs to start with the shopping.

25
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,240
She has selected some stuff for me... you as well.

26
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,760
Anuja: I cannot take a leave now Vaibhav.

27
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,400
It is my first day tomorrow.

28
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll try sometime next month..

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,040
Vaibhav: Listen the preparations for our wedding cannot stop
for you.

30
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Is your job more important than the wedding?

31
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
Anuja: Uncle the duplicate key?

32
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
Landlord: I looked for it but couldn't find it.

33
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,080
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

34
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,600
That's ok. Thank you.

35
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,480
Just check for the water and all.

36
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Yes will check.

37
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,200

Vaibhav: So you come over next week and don't give these
silly reasons about your job.

41
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Is the school going to close if you don't go for a few days?

42
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
You anyway have to quit after a few months and come here.

43
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,200
Then give importance to the things that are important.

44
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,600
And anyway, mother doesn't like the fact that you work.

45
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
So whenever you speak to her, don't throw this working woman
attitude.

46
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,120
Got it?

47
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Anuja:(pleading) Vaibhav you are making a mountain out of...

48
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,720
Vaibhav: (Angry) This isn't a molehill. This may be small
for you...

49
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,240
I'll have a word with your father about this. Things cannot
go on like this.

50
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,320
What is mother supposed to tell people? The girl is busy
with work?

51
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,440
Anuja: I am just requesting that....

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
Vaibhav: What?

53
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,680
This is a major problem that needs to be sorted.

54
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,440
I'll speak to your father.

55
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Anuja (pleading): No Vaibhav please don't tell him.

56
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,680
Vaibhav: No this cannot go on like this. This is not how
marriage works.

57
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
I am a grown up, I have seen the world, I understand
things.

58
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Anuja: No please Vaibhav no please.

59
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,840
Vaibhav: Am speaking to your father. I don't want to say
anything else.

(giggling) Ohhh Joshi!

133
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,280
Listen to what she is saying.

134
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,080
She says she isn't comfortable going with you?

135
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,640
What do you want me to do?

136
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,200

137
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,320
Clerk: Sit.

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,280
Clerk (mumbling): Anuja Rao doesn't want Amol Joshi.

141
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,200
Now who am I supposed to partner up with you?

142
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,560
Neha: I'll go.

143
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,520

144
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040

Neha Kewle.

146
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,880
We are from the same area.

147
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Clerk: Alright. Go take the files.

148
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,800
So Ma'am..

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,160
You're comfortable with her right?

150
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Yes.

151
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,400
Clerk (singing): Neha Kewle...

152
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,320
Thank you Sir. Th...

00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,280
Clerk (singing): She's comfortable with this one..

154
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Thank you.

155
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,240
Rao means you aren't from around here, are you?

156
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,240
No I am from Hyderabad. But grew up in Pune.

157
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,120
Hmmm

158
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,960
So what do we have now? Borda... Maholi..

159
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,600
All these areas are close by.

160
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,640
Gogaashi! Hmmm...

161
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,840
What happened?

162
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,080
They're constructing roads there.

163
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,280
Too may potholes.

164
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,560
But there are 35 houses there!

165
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,120
So what?

166
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,200
So we'll go right?

167
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes..Maybe...Where is Kubaala?

168
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
Anuja: Kubaala??

169
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,200
Chuck it. There is just one house, we'll write no one was
home. Let's go.

170
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,960
Anuja: But...

171
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Neha: You really live alone?

172
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,680
Anuja: Yes

173
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,440
Neha: Why?

174
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,240
Anuja: Why meaning?

175
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,520
Neha: Just asking.

176
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,040
And your family?

177
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Father is in Pune and mom passed away.

178
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,200
And your husband?

179
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,040
Fiance!

180
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,680
He works in Pune.

181
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,840
We are going the correct way right?

How will we go? There is neither a proper road nor any

every couple of hours tonight.

387

No I'll be back at 8. Won't be late.

They have lied at their homes about their whereabouts.

393
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,720
No one knows that they're here tonight.

No. My mother doesn't.

My mother bears everything very quietly.

516
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,040
I mean no matter what someone says or does to her, she takes
it quietly.

I never go and tell her.

519
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,320
Because she scolds me for even that, telling me to behave as
per his wishes.

It's not her fault.

Go to the school and ask then.

609
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,520

610
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,760

611
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,040

I visited the school just now.

622
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,080
They say she's been having an affair with the Amol Joshi
fellow.

623
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,520
Your dear fiance!

624
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,960
First you need to start speaking with some respect.

625
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,040
She is not that kind of girl.

626
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:42,640
Oye!

627
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,800
Don't tell me what she is and is not. I know everything that
goes around here.

628
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,320
Motherfucker! She's run off with my sister in tow.

Landlord: What do you think you guys are doing?

634
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,280
Have you lost your mind?

635
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,120
Your sister fiance are missing..

636
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,320
and you both are assuming that they've run off?

637
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,680
Go to the cops and file a complaint.

638
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,880
Ohh! What am I supposed to tell the cops?

639
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,600
Naru's sister ran away?

640
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,000

641
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,560
Naru: And listen you fucker...

642
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,720
If you want to go to the cops and tell them who all your
fiance is blowing, do...

643
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,440
Vaibhav: I..

644
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,240
Naru: Listen.

645
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,520
Naru: Please Do. But neither mine nor my sister's name
should come anywhere near that complaint.

646
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,320
You make sure he understands.

647
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,480

All her kids are born here too. Look at all this stuff here.
See.

653
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,920
Maybe...

654
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,720
Maybe... Prerna isn't his wife at all.

655
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,320
She's stuck like us.

Bhola, did you feed the girls?

666
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,080
If I feed them they'll become strong.

667
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,720
You said that we need to break them.

668
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,200
If you don't feed them now, they'll die.

669
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,600
Go and give them food.

670
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,480

I... I heard the the birth of the child, his first cries.

01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,480
I am here since the day that child was born.

704
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,880
I am telling the truth sir, no girls came by here.

705
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,440
And what is this old man's problem?

706
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,440

No sir. He isn't speaking. Has taken a vow of silence.

708
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,760
I haven't seen you people around.

01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,720
We don't step out much sir.

710
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:43,640
Alright.

711
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,160
If you see the girl...

712
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,080
Just inform in the village to call Naru.

713
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:51,920

714
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:52,920

715
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,560
That old man killed the child.

716
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,280
Like he has killed all children born before.

717
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,480

If you listen to him, then he doesn't hit.

01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,320
Gives food also.

771
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,280
He just explains with that, with the stick.

01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,840
One day she didn't understand
