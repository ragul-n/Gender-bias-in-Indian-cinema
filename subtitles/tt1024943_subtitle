''Roll sound. Camera. Action''!

29
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,933
Have you ever loved someone?

30
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,058
Yes!

31
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,466
Have you ever given your heart away?

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,594
Yes!

33
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:51,332
Me too!

34
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:18,896
All my young friends out there!

35
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:22,630
Don't you fall in love here!

36
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:29,644
l have loved and lost
my mind and sleep.

37
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:38,214
People around don't lie,
it's all true!

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:46,049
There is no ailment
like falling in love.

39
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,658
There is no control in the matters
of heart, what to do?!

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,667
There is no control in the matters
of heart, what to do?!

41
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:58,996
And there is no cure for
this ailment, too!

42
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:06,673
So sing, 'Om Shanti Om'!

43
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:11,219
'Om Shanti Om'!

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,283
'Om Shanti Om'!

45
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:30,198
'Om..
- Shanti Om'!

46

00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:37,711
'Om Shanti Om'!

49
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:40,543
'Om Shanti Om'!

50
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:45,544
'Om Shanti Om'!

51
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:53,288
'Om..

52
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,603
Hey Sidekick! What do you
think you are doing?

53
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:02,727
You are not the hero of the film.

54
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,595
What is it to you? Are you
the director of the film?

55
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,674
lf l was, l would
Kick you out first!

56
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,300
Buzz off! - Cut it good shot.
- Lunch break, good shot!

57
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,142
Hey you! Mr. 'Hero'!

58
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:18,685
Who me?

59
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,017
Yes you!! ls that your
father's jacket that ..

60
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:23,455
.. you are happily sneaking
out with it?!

61
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:26,585
E! Don't drag my father into this!

62
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:30,324
Why? ls your dad some 'Raj Kapoor'
who will stop our shoot!

63
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:31,763
Come on, return the jacket! Quick!

64
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:35,427
Relax! The 'hero' gave it to me with
so much love, that l just wore it!

65
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:39,273
Come on! Wearing this jacket
will not make you a hero..

66
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,241
You need a good face and personality
as well! Now give it back!

67
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,313
ldiot! Spoilt the jacket -Every
fool wants to become a hero!

68
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,172
Uncle.

69
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,415
Pappu! Did you hear that!

70
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,781
Don't worry Buddy!

71
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:56,784
How will a drunk dressman recognise
a superstar like you?

72
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,649
Superstar?!

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,784
Pappu you're sure l
will become a hero?

74
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,796
Of course! You Will definitely
become a hero.

75
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,463
My mom also says that!

76
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,694
l bet every comedian's mother says
that to her son as well Omi!

77
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,203
Really!
- Yes! That's how mothers are!

78
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,532
But you will surely become a hero.

79
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,077
But l, Pappu Master am telling..

80
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:18,544
..you that you will become a hero.

81
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,205
Because you have everything
it takes -

82
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:27,720
Style, Hair style, Grace,
Face, Talent!

83
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,626
But there is just one thing standing
between you and your stardom!

84
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,154
What's that?

85
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:37,288
Your name!

86
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,169
My name? Om Prakash Makhija!

87
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,465
Your Credit for two months
is still pending!

88
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:45,733
Ok OK! l will clear it!

89
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,240
When, in this lifetime or the next?

90
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:50,109
By the way, your soggy cream rolls..

91
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:52,476
.. are also from the silent
movie era! Pappu!

92
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:56,846
The day l become a superstar, l
will shut down this canteen first!

93
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:01,178
You better remember my name Mister,
Om Prakash Makhija.. Go.

94
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:06,283
That's the problem Omi! We could have
managed with just Om and Prakash.

95
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:10,354
But 'Makhija', how will you ever
become a star with this name?!

96
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:12,797
l will not? - Of course not!
Now look at that poor guy.

97
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:14,596
He is also struggling
to become a hero.

98
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,796
You! Over here!
- Ya!

99
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,263
What is your name?

100
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:19,531
Govinda Ahuja!

101
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:25,870
God! You will never become
a hero with this name!

102
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:30,680
Why don't you change your name to a
dashing Rohan Kapoor or Raj Kiran.

103
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,714
The producers will start
queuing up instantly!

104
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,413
Just Govinda will do?!

105
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:36,883
Try it!

106
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,220
Thank you! Thank you!

107
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:43,788
You're right Pappu. Why did
father give me this name?

108
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,166
Out of all the amazing
actors in the..

109
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,759
.. industry like Jeetendra,
Dharmendra.

110
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,466
But my Dad's favourite had
to be Om Prakash! Gosh!

111
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:04,311
Look! Here comes everyone's
favourite-Rajesh Kapoor!

112
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:13,256
Autograph, please.
- Please, sir.

113
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:18,923
Now that is a Hero's name
- Kapoor! A name to reckon with!

114
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:24,204
Now get rid of this Makhija and
try changing your name to ..

115
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:28,675
.. 'Kapoor' or 'Khanna', then see,
how your life takes off in one shot!

116
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,940
You're Right Pappu! l would have
changed my name today itself. - But?!

117
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,612
But you know what Mom will say!

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,346
Nooooooooo!

119
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,952
Oh My Lord! What am l hearing?

120
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:51,592
My darling son wants
to change his name!

121
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,965
l ask you what is wrong
with your name?

122
00:07:55,337 --> 00:08:01,469
Om stands for the Lord and
Prakash for Light, and..

123
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:04,670
And Makhija! Makhija stands
for shooing a fly away!

124
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,305
l can tolerate 'Om' and 'Prakash'.

125
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:12,978
With a name like Makhija, l will
never become a hero! Never!

126
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:17,985
You will definitely become
a hero one day my darling!

127
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:21,758
My heart says so. A mother's
heart is says so.

128
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:23,330
Mother's heart can go to hell!

129
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,926
l know l will never become
a hero with this name,

130
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:29,265
in this lifetime atleast!..

131
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,736
..l will die a Junior Artiste.

132
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:33,932
Just like dad!

133
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:42,481
Om Prakash's Father! l am glad you
died before hearing all this!

134
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:47,344
Quit overacting mom! Now l know why
you could never become a heroine!

135
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,358
Overacting and me?!

136
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,760
Do you know, l was called by the
Great K. Asif to screen test?

137
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:58,299
lf it wasn't for you in my stomach..

138
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,631
.. then your Mother would have been
Anarkali of ''Mughal-e-azam''!

139
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:08,371
Madhubala was not too bad herself,
but if l was the heroine of the film-

140
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:12,037
- Then the film would
have flopped badly!

141
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:15,315
Mom the truth is..

142
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,817
..that you are a Junior Artiste,
dad was ajunior artiste.

143
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,319
And may be, l too shall always..

144
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:24,051
.. remain a Junior Artiste!
Case Dismissed!!

145
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,328
Om! Wait! l have made
your favourite pudding.

146
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,990
Silly boy has got upset.

147
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:34,061
What happened, Mummy? Why
are you standing like this?

148
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:38,902
See Pappu! Your Useless friend
fought with me again and stormed off.

149
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:45,346
Really? Then he must have gone to
meet his girlfriend on the bridge.

150
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,574
Girlfriend?

151
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,580
How are you Shanti? All well?

152
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:56,353
You know why l keep
coming back to you..

153
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,360
..because you are my inspiration..

154
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:04,091
..my strength, my dream,
my destination. You.

155
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:11,770
Hey! Hope you are not getting
bored Shanti.. Thanks.

156
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:15,432
You know l am a very good actor.

157
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,378
Mother and Pappu also say that
one day l'll become a big hero.

158
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,108
But do you know, l want to become
a star only for you Shanti!

159
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:24,117
So that l can stand next
to you and say ..

160
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:30,515
Hey! Hope you are not
getting bored? Thanks.

161
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:33,392
You know what l love the most about
you, that l keep talking ..

162
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:38,125
.. and you never get bored.
You just keep smiling at me.

163
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,402
l know, you have millions of fans,
but let me tell you one thing..

164
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:46,406
.. no one can love
you more than l do.

165
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:50,407
Oh! And even if you were not
Shanti, the 'Superstar'..

166
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:52,742
..but Shanti the 'super
Junior Artiste',

167
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:54,747

l love you! l love you! l love you
all! l love you Rajesh Kapoor.

335
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:26,339
What a pathetic speech! That also
in the middle of the night!

336
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,506
l love you.
- Get lost!

337
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,783
Pappu! Look at him..

338
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,911
Hey you drunkard. You
did not recognize him?

339
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:36,080
Who are you?

340
00:26:36,457 --> 00:26:39,051
He is superstar Om!

341
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,026
And you didn't recognize him? He
is the famous hero Manoj Kumar!

342
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:46,088
Then l am the famous wrestler
- Dara Singh! Get lost!

343
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:08,716
Om! ls that you?

344
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:13,717
lt is mom.

345
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:16,796
What took you so long?
l was so scared!

346
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:21,698
Oh! My melodramatic mom! What
is there to get scared in it?

347
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,140
You know however late l may get, l
will always come back home- to you!

348
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:33,539
Ok then, freshen up! l
will get food for you.

349
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,841
No
- l have eaten.

350
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,145
And you are drunk as well!

351
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:44,150
Please forgive me today..
l am sorry!

352
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:48,928
Today was special.. you always
tell me that this moon is ..

353
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,758
What moon?

354
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:56,734
Look here mother
- the one in the sky! Over there!

355
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:00,435
You always tell me that
you have a dream for me..

356
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,169
..to reach for the
stars and the moon.

357
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:05,172
Tonight l went for the
stars and beyond.

358
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:13,111
l almost lived my dream. l even
touched it- with my own two hands.

359
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:14,578
Really?

360
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,183
Really! Oh my Prince!

361
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,186
Now sleep! You have to go
for shoot early morning!

362
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:27,465
This foolish make up man has pasted
my moustache so tightly ..

363
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:30,537
.. l can't even open my mouth! How
Will l say my dialogues now?!

364
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:31,862
Look at brighter side, no one will..

365
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,200
.. recognize you with
the moustache atleast!

366
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:34,899
That's so true!
- That's why l've also put a mole.

367
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,533
Wow! l can hardly recognize
you with that!

368
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:38,076
You get lost! Assistant Sir! Here!

369
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,543
Am l supposed to do all
the work around here?

370
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,471
Sir, please tell me
what is the scene..

371
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,847
..exactly and what are my dialogues?

372
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:49,022
The scene is, that this
field is on fire!

373
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:52,217
Actions!
- And your dialogue is - 'RUN!!

374
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:53,817
And?

375
00:28:55,596 --> 00:28:56,620
That's it!

376
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,754
RUN!

377
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:58,889
Assistant Sir! Sir!

378
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,092
Only 'run'?! But it is hardly
a dialogue! lt's miniscule!

379
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:02,759
Miniscule!? l Have written it!

380
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,239
Oh wow! Amazing dialogue! How
creative! People will love it.

381
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:09,502
But Sir, if l had a better 'hero like'
dialogue, l would be so grateful.

382
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,941
Yes sir!

383
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:14,672
The hero of the film will say 'Hero
-like' dialogues, not you.

384
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:16,249
And he is there
- Ricky Sandhu!

385
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,021
Ok Madam, no problem! Someone
Call the Producer!

386
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:25,717
Oh God! This mad director is acting
up again! You Get lost from here.

387
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:30,859
Ricky Sandhu that ass..

388
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,591
Hush! He is the hero!

389
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:38,899
My shot is ready and she will not
shoot till the Producer comes!

390
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:43,272
She is telling me
- 'Partho Roy'-the great Director,

391
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:44,867
That she will come out only
when the producer is here.

392
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,605
Call the damn Producer!
Call Mukeshji!

393
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:48,840
Suresh Uncle, what
is all this drama?

394
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,549
Same old story! The heroine
is refusing to shoot..

395
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:53,552
.. they must have not paid
her for the last schedule!

396
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,553
Of course not! The
Producer of this..

397
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:56,953
.. film is a very big man
- Mukesh Mehra!

398
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,548
lt doesn't matter how big
or small the Producer is..

399
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,151
..these stars treat all
of them like dogs!

400
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,286
Uncle!!!
- Control!

401
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,297
Our Shanti ji is not like that!

402
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:09,158
Correct! Mukesh Mehra is the one
who gave her the first break!

403
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:14,938
ln a film called 'ode to youth'.
Then Shanti was only sixteen!

404
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:18,173
''Greetings..''

405
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:19,939
Hey! Mukeshji is here! Mukeshji

406
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:33,091
Now watch, how the shooting
will start in ten minutes?!

407
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:40,189
Mukesh ji is amazing.
-What personality!

408
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,324
Totally Dashing!

409
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:46,331
He should become a hero!
He is Tall as well!

410
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,668
Smarty pants!

411
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,615
You know uncle, we would never..

412
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:04,748
.. do this measly dacoit role
for any other producer.

413
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,855
lt is Mukeshji's film
that's why we agreed!

414
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,361
You seem to be coughing
a lot suddenly.

415
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:14,234
All ok.. Shanti will be ready in
10 minutes. You set up the shot.

416
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:19,704
Very good! Problem solved!
Mukeshji. My creativity is sinking..

417
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:22,274
Stop crying for every
little thing Partho.

418
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,208
This is Bombay. This is
how we make films here.

419
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:28,374
And make sure you finish
this scene today itself.

420
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:31,280
Of course! Of course!! l have
placed three cameras.

421
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,649
Just like the great art house
makers - One Satyajit Ray angle..

422
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,655
..One Bimolda angle, One Gurudott
angle.. totally in the shadows.

423
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:38,389
Put a Manmohan Desai angle as
well! The mainstream one.

424
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,386
That's the one that will work.

425
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,254
Camera ready! Wide angle!

426
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,226
Take it to a bit right.

427
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,270
Shanti baby! You are too much really!

428
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,867
You took so long! What are you
doing after pack up darling?

429
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,003
Committing Suicide!

430
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:03,079
Baby l am ready to die
with you as well!

431
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:08,348
Ok! Going for the shot!
Field clear! Field clear!

432
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:09,752
Sir you are in the field!

433
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:11,255
What? Ok!

434
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:16,421
Light the fire! Start
rolling! Action!

435
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:17,923
Sir you are supposed
to say Camera first!

436
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:19,055
Uh yes! Camera..

437
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:23,759
Saarjoooo!
- Hey, somebody help her.

438
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,703
Run!

439
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:30,971
Run!

440
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:35,447
RUN!

441
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:39,248
Saarjoooo!
- Help very good.

442
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:40,445
Saarjoooo!

443
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:42,180
Very good! Sarjoo!
Jump into the fire!

444
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,122
This fire is too hot! Let it cool
down a bit-l will jump!! l will jump!

445
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,955
What the hell is happening?
Put out the fire!

446
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,790
Sir, Cut the shot! Sarjoo
is refusing to jump in!

447
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:52,330
No!.. Till l get an okay
shot l can't cut it.

448
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:54,059
The Producer wants to
finish the scene today!

449
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:56,328
Jump. Some one help!

450
00:32:57,337 --> 00:33:00,738
While shooting 'Mother lndia' -
Sunil Dutt saved Nargis from the fire

451
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:02,365
Just like this .And then
they got married.

452
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:06,074
But l am already married.
So what's the point.

453
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,942
Help!

454
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:11,050
Shantiji is alone there.
Please help her.

455
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:14,917
lf you are so concerned, why don't
you jump into the fire?! Packup!

456
00:33:15,022 --> 00:33:16,284
l don't want to shoot anymore.

457
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,260
Somebody please cut the shot!

458
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:23,489
Somebody please jump in the fire!

459
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:02,926
Om.

460
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:18,475
Om.

461
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:20,414
Om Fire!

462
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,215
Where?
- Behind you!

463
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:25,257
Hey, somebody help me.

464
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,096
Omi! What happened! Hold him.
Omi! What happened!

465
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:43,568
Cut the shot! Very good!

466
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:51,282
Doctor can't you cut down your fee?
You came for half a shift only!

467
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,585
lt's hurting a lot Omi?
- Yes.

468
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,580
Have you lost it? Look at me,
l am talking to you!

469
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:02,121
What would l go and tell mother, if
something were to happen to you?

470
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:04,362
Look at me, l am talking to you!

471
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:05,488
Oh ho! Shanti was in the fire.

472
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,568
Shanti can go to hell! There were
lots of people to rescue her.

473
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:12,598
But who would have come to save
you? Look at me, l am talking to you!

474
00:35:12,973 --> 00:35:13,997
Then stop moving around!

475
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:19,875
Shut up! Thank God your back
was burnt and not your face!

476
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,880
Otherwise, instead of
becoming a film star..

477
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:23,882
.. you would have to work
in a horror film!

478
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,008
Fine, l would have worked
in a horror film.

479
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:29,455
So what?

480
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,891
Worse come to worse l would have
died in that fire? So what?

481
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:38,020
Pappu, l did not think that time.

482
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,968
All l could see was Shanti trapped
in that fire, helpless.

483
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,899
And you know, if need be, l will
jump in that fire again and again!

484
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:51,637
Not once but hundred times,
thousand times, to save Shanti!

485
00:35:53,413 --> 00:35:56,280
Because nothing is more precious
to me than Shanti's life.

486
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:01,343
My life, my dreams, nothing matters!

487
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:06,249
Now you look at me!

488
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:10,260
You look at me! What are you doing?

489
00:36:10,363 --> 00:36:13,457
What are you doing?

490
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,431
l have known many people in my life,

491
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,937
but nobody has ever done anything
like this for me..

492
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:27,377
.. what you have done,
being a stranger.

493
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:29,142
Shanti! l may be a stranger for you.

494
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:34,118
But you are already a part of me,
without you, l am incomplete.

495
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:36,011
What is your name?

496
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:40,286
My name is something which is
always connected to Shanti.

497
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:44,327
Om, before Shanti and
Om, after Shanti.

498
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:47,689
See, l know you are not mute.

499
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:51,169
lf you will not tell me your name
then how will l thank you?

500
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:54,034
Om!
- Om!

501
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:56,170
Shanti.
- Om.

Before lnterval, the villain
kills both of us.

577
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:52,835
And after the interval
we are reborn.

578
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:59,469
We kill the villain in the climax
and die again. Mind it!

579
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,010
You are the first person who is
so happy after dying four times.

Please forgive me Shanti.

But what could l do?

599
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:13,078
You are such a big star and
l am just ajunior artiste.

600
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:16,814
Who says you are just
a Junior artiste?

601
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:21,694
You jumped in the fire for me Om!

602
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:25,488
You are a hero!

603
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:32,097
And if l can do anything for you,
l would be delighted to.

604
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,833
Anything, except jumping
in the fire!!

605
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:39,378
No.. There is something that
you can do for sure..

606
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:44,075
..but it will be almost like
jumping in the fire for you.

607
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,856
l don't think she will come.

608
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:54,687
Even l think so.
- Really?

609
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:57,927
l'm just joking. She will
definitely come. - Shut up.

610
00:43:58,698 --> 00:43:59,892
ls everything ready inside?

611
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:05,130
Of course! She will have the time
of her life today! Good look.

612
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:12,137
A promise made, has to kept!

613
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:15,914
Even if the world stops you..

614
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:19,007
Wait.. - Hey, this is sister.
- Who is Om Prakash?

615
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:20,543
lf you've to give something then me.

00:44:20,653 --> 00:44:21,677
lf you've to take something,

617
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:24,086
Actually Shanti Ma'am has sent me.

618
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,958
She is very sorry that
she cannot come today.

619
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,993
See Pappu! With what style
she has broken my heart!

620
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:37,492
Forget it, dude. All l had asked
for, was an evening with her!

621
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:41,437
Please go! And tell your Shanti..

622
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:45,170
..not to play with someone's
emotions like this.

623
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:50,682
After all it is not a glass bangle
but my heart that she has broken!

624
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:52,910
Tell her yourself.

625
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:55,180
Your culprit is standing right here.

626
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,161
l was telling this idiot
that you will come!

627
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:10,462
This idiot kept saying you won't!

628
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,128
What Rubbish! l was saying
that you will come.

629
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:14,069
You are a liar! l was saying that.

630
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,073
You are a liar!
- Un.. unn cut it!!.

631
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,802
How could l not come?

632
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:21,612
lt was a promise made to a
friend l had to keep it.

633
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:29,477
You have stopped me from
saying thank you..

634
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:31,750
..but please don't say no to this.

635
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:21,169
''l have found you but it
seems l have lost myself!''

636
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:25,975
l want to tell you but
then how do l tell?

637
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:30,912
l have found you but it
seems l have lost myself!

638
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:35,951
l want to tell you but
then how do l tell?

639
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:41,560
ln any language that is known
l can't find the words alone..

640
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:45,290
To tell you, what you mean to me.

641
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:55,564
What if l say, a beauty like yours..
Can't be found in this cosmos!

642
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:58,576
Your beauty and allure l may extol..

643
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:00,737
.. but all this is truly,
nothing at all!

644
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:05,307
l have found you but it
seems l have lost myself!

645
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:39,845
A sparkling demeanor flows
from your face..

646
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:49,356
Your deep dark tresses, descend
in a dazzling maze!

647
00:47:49,996 --> 00:47:54,695
Your scarf that is flowing.. is
like a whiff of cloud blowing.

648
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,229
Draped in your embrace.. are
both beauty and grace!

649
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:09,374
lf l say, charisma as yours..

650
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:14,015
Can't be found, and
will never be around!

651
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,644
Your beauty and allure l may extol..

652
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:19,316
.. but all this is truly,
nothing at all!

653
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:24,658
l have found you but it
seems l have lost myself!

654
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:44,078
You are very generous today.. then
here is the story from this day.

655
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:57,753
You are very generous today.. then
here is the story from this day

656
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,890
Now me and you cruise the same way,

657
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:05,368
l'll come with you,
where ever you say!

658
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:12,711
My beloved, if l say
to you, you are.. ..

659
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:17,772
a fairy, or a riveting
nymph it's true!

660
00:49:17,883 --> 00:49:20,716
''Your beauty and
allure l may extol..''

661
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,448
''..but all this is truly,
nothing at all!''

662
00:49:46,112 --> 00:49:47,739
You know Om! l don't even remember..

663
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:49,212
..when was the last
time l was so happy.

664
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:50,472
But not more than me!

665
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:56,118
Have you seen heaven? lt is
right here, at my feet!

666
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:00,917
Hmmm.. so you never get sad?

667
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:02,885
No. Never.

668
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:07,093
And if l do get sad,
l watch your film.

669
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:10,259
Because happiness for
me means Shanti!

670
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:15,239
The queen of hearts! Who is
loved by the entire world!

671
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:25,112
Sometimes, the entire world's
love is not enough Om.

672
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:30,455
Sometimes getting love from that
one person is what counts.

673
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:36,523
You will get that love Shanti. All
you have to do is reach out for it.

674
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:38,994
You will get whatever you want.

675
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:43,857
You deserve all the happiness
in the world.

676
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:46,866
All you have to do is ask!

677
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:53,037
And then see, happiness
will follow you around!

678
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,406
Really?
- Really!

679
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:03,548
l will ask Om.

680
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:11,562
l will go for it. And
l will be happy.

681
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,435
And l will be the king of the world!

682
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:38,981
Brother!

683
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:43,053
Why is this Junior Artiste getting
so excited. He's not the hero!

684
00:51:43,162 --> 00:51:44,186
Cut it!

685
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:49,935
Omi! Look at Salma!

686
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:52,437
She is playing my sister. Forget it!

687
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:53,869
Here, take this, l have to go.
Where are you going?

688
00:51:54,507 --> 00:51:56,475
Floor number 7, your sister-in-law
is shooting there.

689
00:52:00,246 --> 00:52:04,580
You Bastard! For God's
sake! Leave me!

690
00:52:04,683 --> 00:52:07,948
lf we leave you for the Gods,
then what are we going to do?

691
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:16,621
Fantastic! Very good!

692
00:52:47,026 --> 00:52:50,086
Forget it Om! These heroines
are heartless!

693
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:52,321
Om!

694
00:52:57,503 --> 00:52:58,527
Wait here.

695
00:53:01,106 --> 00:53:02,334
Good afternoon ma'am. Please come.

696
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,175
Shanti!
- Wait! Where are you going?

697
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:07,540
Shantiji knows me!

698
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:08,670
There are only star's
make up rooms here.

699
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:10,271
But l am also a star!
- Get lost from here.

700
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,177
Sir is here. Greetings, sir.

701
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:32,560
l don't know, he was here right now.
Yes l have checked.

702
00:53:50,623 --> 00:53:52,215
Look at this magazine Mukesh.

703
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:55,686
lt says that you are getting
married to Harsh Mittal's daughter!

704
00:53:56,228 --> 00:53:58,526
And getting Mittal Studios
as your wedding gift!

705
00:53:58,631 --> 00:53:59,655
God Dammit! lt is all rubbish.

706
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:02,533
You will hear Gossip like this
everyday, you know why?

707
00:54:02,635 --> 00:54:04,000
Because we are making the biggest,
the most expensive..

708
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,731
.. film ever made in lndia!

709
00:54:07,106 --> 00:54:10,007
Om Shanti Om! l am the Producer of
the film, you are the heroine..

710
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:13,374
.. and Mittal is the man who
is making all this possible!

711
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:16,607
Shanti, Mittal has already invested
forty lakhs in this project.

712
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:19,582
So now stop behaving like
a child and go and shoot.

713
00:54:19,685 --> 00:54:21,016
Delays in shooting schedule
means bad business.

714
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,747
You always think about business.

715
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:25,482
That's why you are marrying
Harsh Mittal's daughter?

716
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:30,752
But how are you going to go through
with this wedding Mukesh?

717
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:33,228
Because you are already married!

718
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:34,697
To me!

719
00:54:37,603 --> 00:54:39,571
Shanti please! Be quiet.

720
00:54:39,672 --> 00:54:43,631
What if some one hears us? Please
try to understand Shanti!

721
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:44,766
Why don't you understand Mukesh?

722
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:48,045
We have been married
for two years now..

723
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:49,614
..and l can't be acknowledged
as your wife in public!

724
00:54:49,715 --> 00:54:51,774
l don't care for anything
else Mukesh .

725
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:57,281
Not even Mittal's forty lakhs. All
want, is to be accepted as your wife.

726
00:54:57,389 --> 00:55:01,382
Really? Let me tell
you something Shanti.

727
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:04,053
The day you will step out
of the house as my wife..

728
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:06,188
..'Om Shanti Om' will be finished!

729
00:55:06,632 --> 00:55:12,229
Because no one will invest a penny
in a married heroine's film!

730
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:15,398
Everything will be doomed!

731
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,700
Not only your career,
but my future as well!

732
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:24,712
You are my future Mukesh.
l am your wife.

733
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,809
You have to accept me in front
of the entire world.

734
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:30,547
This is what will give me happiness.

735
00:55:33,192 --> 00:55:35,387
And today l want to
make that choice.

736
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:39,290
Don't l deserve to be happy?!

737
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:43,095
What is this madness Shanti!?
You will do Om Shanti Om..

738
00:55:43,202 --> 00:55:47,536
..and after it is finished,
we will tell everyone. OK?

739
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,232
But it will be too late by then.

740
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:53,576
What do you mean?

741
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:57,273
l mean that l am pregnant!

742
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:01,350
Mukesh! You're going to be a father!

743
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:10,854
What? You are Pregnant?

744
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:16,668
This is.. fantastic!

745
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:18,863
Why didn't you tell this
to me earlier? - Really?

746
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:21,263
Of course!

747
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,901
''Neither do l live..''

748
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:31,015
Nor do l die.

749
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:39,157
Tell me what to do, l
want to say good bye!

750
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:43,490
Hearts were torn apart, before
they could be tied.

751
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:46,223
Souls were separated
in a chasm so wide.

752
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:53,237
What has destiny in store who knows!

753
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:57,172
These eyes well up with
tears yet again.

754
00:56:57,276 --> 00:57:00,541
Seeking a glimpse
of you but in vain!

755
00:57:00,646 --> 00:57:06,915
My beloved, this is destiny's game!

756
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:14,556
How do l live each day? Without
you, it's a desolate bay!

757
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:21,359
Neither do l live.. nor do l die.

758
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:36,279
A dream when destroyed..
makes your world a void.

759
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:43,947
Your love is not your's anymore..
your life is a barren core.

760
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:51,224
Why does this happen..

761
00:57:51,330 --> 00:58:00,432
..when this heart sobs, around
me the howling winds toss.

762
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:01,563
And my life seems totally lost.

763
00:58:01,673 --> 00:58:08,943
A dream when destroyed makes
your world a void.

764
00:58:09,047 --> 00:58:18,979
''Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core.''

765
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:25,930
Shanti, you did the right thing.
You chose your happiness.

766
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:30,767
Don't think you have
broken my heart!

767
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:39,006
l am happy, because you are happy.

768
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:46,280
But you must tell Mr. Mehra, that
this l am letting him go..

769
00:58:46,385 --> 00:58:49,582
..only for you.

770
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:58,295
But if l ever happen to meet him
again in any other life time..

771
00:58:58,397 --> 00:59:01,798
..he better watch out! Mind it!!

772
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:08,829
''There is only solitude
all around me..''

773
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:12,604
Hey! Hope you are not
getting bored? Thanks!

774
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:20,482
A dream when destroyed makes your world a void.

775
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:30,860
Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core.

A dream when destroyed makes

797

Your love is not your's anymore.
Your life is a barren core.

798
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:33,949
''Solitude all around..''

799
01:00:40,933 --> 01:00:46,394
Mukesh! Where are you taking me?
l Don't want to see any set!

800
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:48,132
You don't even want to see
the venue for your wedding?

801
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,464
Really?

802
01:00:58,517 --> 01:00:59,916
lt's beautiful Mukesh!

803
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:04,955
Come! This is the magnificent
set Of 'Om Shanti Om'!

804
01:01:05,057 --> 01:01:08,549
The biggest set of the biggest
film to be made in lndia.

805
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:11,485
But there will be no shooting here.

806
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,024
lnfact, we will dismantle
this set in a few days.

807
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:19,431
Because l was making this
film only for you..

808
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:23,975
..and no body can
replace you Shanti.

809
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:26,442
But before breaking the set..

810
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:28,740
..we will have a huge party here.

811
01:01:29,014 --> 01:01:30,174
Our wedding party!

812
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:33,575
Really Mukesh?

813
01:01:33,685 --> 01:01:36,449
Of course! Of course my darling!
Our guests will arrive from here!

814
01:01:36,555 --> 01:01:38,455
Walking on carpets of rose petals.

815
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,457
And there! We will have
a forty piece orchestra..

816
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,049
..playing your favourite songs.

817
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,458
And right here will
be a huge fountain ..

818
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:47,794
..with champagne flowing
in it, instead of water!

819
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:51,460
And right here! Under this
magnificent chandelier..

820
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,471
.. we will exchange our wedding
vows and get married..

821
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:56,700
..in front of everyone!

822
01:01:57,776 --> 01:01:59,209
l can't believe it Mukesh!

823
01:02:06,718 --> 01:02:09,949
Mukesh l never thought you
could love me so much!

824
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:12,216
l am sorry, l didn't trust you.

825
01:02:12,324 --> 01:02:17,921
No! l am sorry too, that
you trusted me Shanti!

826
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,497
lf you had not.. then l couldn't
have dreamt so big!

827
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,227
But l did!

828
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:25,060
l dreamt of being the biggest
and most powerful..

829
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,228
..producer in this industry.

830
01:02:27,072 --> 01:02:29,506
And now, this dream is so big..

831
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:33,100
..that l can break your trust
but l can't break this dream!

832
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,235
You're hurting me!

833
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:38,578
No you are hurting me! Did you ever
think about it? Obviously not!

834
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,183
Why did you do all this?

835
01:02:42,621 --> 01:02:45,249
Everything was going perfect!
We had Mittal's Money.

.. where heroine Natasha
is getting married to -

914
01:14:40,805 --> 01:14:41,965

You keep talking and l'll keep

918
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,944
Sir Raj, that's you, his
heart is breaking.

919
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:55,450
He wants to tell the heroine that
'Natasha l really love you!'

920
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:56,815
But he can's say it!

921
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:57,979
Why? Am l mute?

922
01:14:58,356 --> 01:14:59,983
Correct Sir! You remember
your mother's death scene?

923
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:01,388
Now there is a mother also?!

924
01:15:01,492 --> 01:15:03,255
Sir, sir in mother's death scene,
you scream so loudly..

925
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:05,989
..that you loose your voice.

926
01:15:06,364 --> 01:15:09,265
Now for the last time, you
want to look at Natasha..

927
01:15:09,367 --> 01:15:11,835
..but sir, you can't even do that!
- Why? Why?

928
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:12,994
Because you are blind as well sir!

929
01:15:13,371 --> 01:15:14,861
Oh l am blind also! l see.

930
01:15:14,972 --> 01:15:16,337
No sir you don't!
- l don't!

931
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,840
Sir music starts in the background!
You leave foreground!

932
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:20,342
Natasha turns to look at you and..

933
01:15:20,444 --> 01:15:23,845
One second. Natasha looks at
me, but Natasha is blind!

934
01:15:23,948 --> 01:15:26,007
No sir, you are Blind!
- But l was mute!

935
01:15:26,117 --> 01:15:29,280
Sir you are mute and blind and when
Natasha calls out to you saying,

936
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:31,548
..''Don't go Raj!'' you
don't stop sir..

937
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:33,021
..because in the film
you are deaf as well!

938
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:35,882
What the fish! l don't know
what he is talking!

939
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:38,291
Yes sir, the wedding is happening
in the background ..

940
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:40,296
..and in the foreground it's just
you and your heart's voice!

941
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:43,026
One second! l am angry now!
- Sir voice over..

942
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,295
Voice over, one second..
Let me read the dialogue.

943
01:15:45,403 --> 01:15:48,304
''Natasha l just want to say that..

944
01:15:48,406 --> 01:15:51,307
..l want to take you away
from this place..

945
01:15:51,409 --> 01:15:53,309
..but l am helpless, l
am on a wheelchair..

946
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,311
..and l have lost both my hands!

947
01:15:55,413 --> 01:15:56,437
Cut Sir! Gone.

948
01:15:56,547 --> 01:15:58,708
l have lost both my hands!
What is this?!

949
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:03,048
ln this film does the Hero have any
of his body parts in working order?

950
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:05,787
Of course Sir, as you see,
his aching heart!

951
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,323
There won't be any heartache..

952
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:08,449
..but the audience will definitely
have a headache!

953
01:16:08,559 --> 01:16:10,322
This film will get critical
acclaim and award ..

954
01:16:10,428 --> 01:16:12,328
..but let me tell you one thing..

955
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,727
..this film is a flop! - Flop!

956
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:17,062
This film is gone! You are
dead old man! Dead! - No! No

957
01:16:17,435 --> 01:16:19,995
Unless, l think of
something as usual.

958
01:16:21,372 --> 01:16:27,607
ln this situation to express all
this pain, let's put an item song!

959
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:31,341
ltem song. - Yes. A sad item,
may be a trance number..

960
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:34,418
.. no a sad rock-n-roll,
done to death!

961
01:16:34,518 --> 01:16:36,349
l think it should be a painful..

962
01:16:36,454 --> 01:16:39,082
..disco

963
01:16:39,457 --> 01:16:40,822
Disco!! But Sir..

964
01:16:40,925 --> 01:16:42,358
..in the script we have a handless,
footless, blind and mute actor..

965
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,586
..how do we fit in the disco factor?

966
01:16:43,694 --> 01:16:45,491
ldiot! Dream sequence!!
OK can do anything.

967
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:47,496
Come on, give me a kiss.

968
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:51,702
And come here, your heroine is
quite sad. Your girlfriend?

969
01:16:51,802 --> 01:16:52,826
No Sir! My Pappa's.

970
01:16:52,937 --> 01:16:56,100
Pappa! l am sorry Pappa!
We'll have to change her.

971
01:16:56,207 --> 01:16:58,437
Get 5-10 hot girls instead.

972
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:01,375
l tell you only this song
can make your film a hit!

973
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:04,710

''Hey my beauty, My Precious one!''

976
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:30,698
What spell have you cast on me.

977
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:33,003
My eyes can't sleep a wink

978
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,010
And my heart is ready to sink.

979
01:17:35,112 --> 01:17:37,137
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!

980
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:39,540
What spell have you cast on me.

981
01:17:39,784 --> 01:17:42,014
My eyes can't sleep a wink

982
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:44,019
And my heart is ready to sink.

983
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:46,487
About my poor heart, and
my wandering soul..

984
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:49,423
Who should l go and tell.
All l can say is, well..

985
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:51,495
..My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

986
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:53,756
Pain of disco!

987
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:55,923
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

988
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:58,627
Pain of disco!

989
01:17:58,736 --> 01:18:01,569
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

990
01:18:01,672 --> 01:18:02,798
Pain of disco!

991
01:18:02,907 --> 01:18:04,898
My heart is full of
the pain of disco.

992
01:18:05,009 --> 01:18:07,170
Pain of disco!

993
01:18:34,572 --> 01:18:38,702
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

994
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:43,208
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

995
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:52,152
There was a time when the flowers
were blooming all around.

996
01:18:52,256 --> 01:18:56,920
There was a time, lost in
Love's whispering sounds.

997
01:18:57,028 --> 01:19:01,055
What a time, when l lived in dreams!

998
01:19:01,165 --> 01:19:05,693
What a time, when l
was drunk on youth!

999
01:19:05,803 --> 01:19:07,794
But that time was short
and l got hurt..

1000
01:19:07,905 --> 01:19:10,100
As the bubble of my love
and dreams just burst.

1001
01:19:10,207 --> 01:19:12,505
Now l am a wanderer, and a lover
of disco, as l wander around..

1002
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,703
..London, Paris, New York,
L.A., San Francisco!

1003
01:19:14,812 --> 01:19:16,746
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1004
01:19:16,847 --> 01:19:19,145
Pain of disco!

1005
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,241
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

01:19:21,352 --> 01:19:23,843
Pain of disco!

1007
01:19:41,172 --> 01:19:50,808
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!
What spell have you cast on me.

1008
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:55,079
Every second was a wild wanting.

1009
01:19:55,186 --> 01:19:59,850
Every second was a daring fire.

1010
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:08,291
Every second was a wild wanting.

1011
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:13,160
Every second was a daring fire.

1012
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:17,297
Blessings were showered
on me in abundance..

1013
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:21,907
And after this shower
l had no other desire.

1014
01:20:22,012 --> 01:20:23,946
But once again l find myself alone..

1015
01:20:24,048 --> 01:20:26,175
Oh my beloved!

1016
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:28,581
You broke my heart and you left.
to this day, l feel the rift.

1017
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:31,018
And the date you left
was the twenty sixth!

1018
01:20:31,122 --> 01:20:35,320
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1019
01:20:35,426 --> 01:20:37,724
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1020
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:41,665
Hey my beauty, My Precious one!

1021
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:43,824
What spell have you cast on me.

1022
01:20:43,934 --> 01:20:46,198
My eyes can't sleep a wink

1023
01:20:46,303 --> 01:20:48,328
And my heart is ready to sink.

1024
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:50,202
About my poor heart, and
my wandering soul..

1025
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:53,333
Who should l go and tell.
All l can say is, well..

1026
01:20:53,444 --> 01:20:57,881
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1027
01:20:57,982 --> 01:21:02,214
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1028
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,881
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1029
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:11,690
My heart is full of Pain of disco!

1030
01:21:20,004 --> 01:21:24,373
Pain of disco!

1031
01:21:26,877 --> 01:21:29,368
Oh God! Cut it! Cut the shot.

1032
01:21:32,016 --> 01:21:33,916
OK! OK!

1033
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:39,381
Who put the fire? Don't you know
he has a phobia of fire?!

1034
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,014
Phobia of fire? Pappa l didn't know!

1035
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,717
You don't know!
- Anwar. Take me home.

1036
01:21:42,826 --> 01:21:44,817
Take me home.
- Yes. Pack Up!

1037
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:47,395
Pack up. Father, pack up.
- Pack up!

1038
01:21:48,766 --> 01:21:51,030
l am gone. Please everyone-l am ok!

1039
01:21:53,237 --> 01:21:56,331
Om! My son! My son!

1040
01:21:56,774 --> 01:21:58,264
Where do you keep disappearing
my son?

1041
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,208
You know how much l wait for you!

1042
01:22:01,312 --> 01:22:04,042
Anwar! Security!

1043
01:22:04,148 --> 01:22:06,742
When are you coming
home dear? Tell me.

1044
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:14,890
Listen to me Om! No leave
me! Let me go! Om!

1045
01:22:14,992 --> 01:22:17,085
Who is this old woman? She
lands up in every studio!

1046
01:22:17,194 --> 01:22:19,025
l feel weird looking at her!

1047
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:21,859
Poor thing is mad! She
thinks you are her son!

1048
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:24,264
Dude, l am a star! Every mother
in lndia thinks l am her son.

1049
01:22:24,368 --> 01:22:25,767
That's good! But this is not.

1050
01:22:25,869 --> 01:22:27,996
Make sure this doesn't happen
again. Hey! You will get hurt!

1051
01:22:28,105 --> 01:22:29,163
Come on! Move it man!

1052
01:22:40,317 --> 01:22:45,152
See Pappu, Om has gone and
left me again. Stop him!

1053
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:46,723
Why do you do this
to yourself mummy?

1054
01:22:46,824 --> 01:22:50,783
He is not our Om. He is Om Kapoor.
Only his face resembles our Om.

1055
01:22:50,894 --> 01:22:54,125
No Pappu, he is my son Om.

1056
01:22:54,231 --> 01:22:57,928
Brother! He is my son Om!

1057
01:22:58,035 --> 01:23:01,129
Yeah sure! And Amitabh Bachchan
is my dad! Move now!

1058
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,468
There are many reasons for
headaches and blackouts.

1059
01:23:07,278 --> 01:23:08,745
But he doesn't have any of them.

1060
01:23:10,314 --> 01:23:11,747
Anwar! Cancel my dates
for that horny..

1061
01:23:11,849 --> 01:23:14,044
..producer and his
idiotic son's film!

1062
01:23:14,985 --> 01:23:16,748
And give all my dates to the
superhero project!

1063
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:18,014
Superheroes are in.

1064
01:23:18,122 --> 01:23:19,749
l will give the dates but ..

1065
01:23:19,857 --> 01:23:22,018
..how will those superhero guys
put up a set in one day?

1066
01:23:22,126 --> 01:23:23,753
Oh Shut up .lf they
don't have a set..

1067
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:26,125
..tell them to shoot
at real location.

1068
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:27,822
Everything is ok with OK!

1069
01:23:28,866 --> 01:23:32,495
And please shove this
up your nose, go on.

1070
01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:35,834
Shove this up your nose, go on.

1071
01:23:38,142 --> 01:23:40,167
What did you say?

1072
01:23:40,277 --> 01:23:42,040
Come on, shove it up
your nose, go on.

1073
01:23:43,347 --> 01:23:46,510
Come on. No sneezing ok?

1074
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:48,846
Now after this we will
try other holes.

1075
01:23:50,154 --> 01:23:52,850
l have been driving for hours now
-Where is this goddamn location?

1076
01:23:52,956 --> 01:23:54,321
Couldn't they put up
a set near the house?

1077
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:55,790
They were building a
set near the house..

1078
01:23:55,893 --> 01:23:57,520
..but you said to shoot
at a real location.

1079
01:23:57,895 --> 01:23:59,522
At such short notice this is the
only place they could find..

1080
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,029
What is so special about
this location?

1081
01:24:01,131 --> 01:24:03,793
Except being in China
of course!? Ya, idiot!

1082
01:24:04,168 --> 01:24:06,534
This studio is completely burnt!

1083
01:24:06,904 --> 01:24:09,464
What?! Then why are
we shooting there?

1084
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,064
The director wanted an
old abandoned ruin..

1085
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:12,540
..and this place fits perfectly.

1086
01:24:12,643 --> 01:24:15,874
ln fact this is one of the
most damned places ever!

1087
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:17,537
What do you mean?

1088
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:21,316
30 years ago there was
a big calamity here.

1089
01:24:21,418 --> 01:24:24,546
A huge fire broke out
on one of the sets.

1090
01:24:24,922 --> 01:24:33,352
The film got shelved and the studio
destroyed! Very unlucky place.

1091
01:24:33,464 --> 01:24:36,524
What a wonderful location! lt's
unlucky. The set was burnt.

1092
01:24:36,633 --> 01:24:38,430
Studio was ruined, even
the film got scrapped!

1093
01:24:38,936 --> 01:24:42,235
Well done Anwar! ldiot!

1094
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:13,027
Anwar have we come here before?

1095
01:25:13,137 --> 01:25:16,072
Of course not, Nobody comes here!

1096
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:19,069
We will be the first ones
to shoot here in 30 years!

1097
01:25:23,981 --> 01:25:26,074
Your credit for two months
is still pending!

1098
01:25:30,988 --> 01:25:33,479
Style, hairstyle, face..

1099
01:25:36,493 --> 01:25:38,893
How will you become a
star with this name?

1100
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:47,403
Where are you going? There are only
star's make up rooms inside!

1101
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:54,034
Welcome sir!

1102
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:57,636
Dude what a location! Check
it out! Wild place!

1103
01:25:59,616 --> 01:26:01,982
Please let me escort you
to the make up rooms..

1104
01:26:02,085 --> 01:26:03,109
where are the make up rooms?

1105
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,648
This building, second floor.

1106
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:08,083
Right! How did you know?

1107
01:26:09,026 --> 01:26:10,493
Let's go take a look at
the rooms! Come on!

1108
01:26:10,594 --> 01:26:12,653
Take the shot, man.
Come on. Let's go.

1109
01:26:45,329 --> 01:26:46,387
Freaky dude.

1110
01:26:47,598 --> 01:26:50,692
Sir, the shot isn't here.
lt is downstairs.

1111
01:26:51,068 --> 01:26:52,968
Yes, damn!

1112
01:27:01,612 --> 01:27:06,447
God! l am so hot! Babes!
What is this costume?

1113
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:10,042
Actors get tortured. l am a star.
And this harness is going up..

1114
01:27:10,153 --> 01:27:11,177
Hey! Don't touch my hair please!

1115
01:27:11,288 --> 01:27:12,983
And why am l made to wear my
underwear over the costume..

1116
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:14,648
..what is this?

1117
01:27:14,758 --> 01:27:17,454
Dude! You are a superhero!
Savior of love!

1118
01:27:17,561 --> 01:27:18,721
Love
- man!!

1119
01:27:18,829 --> 01:27:20,626
Oh shut up! l feel more
like a moron man!

1120
01:27:20,731 --> 01:27:21,993
Come on OK. Spiderman..

1121
01:27:22,099 --> 01:27:23,327
..Superman-they also wear
their underwear like this..

1122
01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:24,457
Really? Give me a kiss then.

1123
01:27:25,369 --> 01:27:26,734
Anyways you are playing
a double role.

1124
01:27:26,837 --> 01:27:27,997
ln the part where you are a
villager..

1125
01:27:28,105 --> 01:27:29,129
..you wear your underwear inside.

1126
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:30,331
lnfact the way you wear
your underwear ..

1127
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,374
..tells us who the
real superhero is!

1128
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:33,738
Oh yeah! That's a good idea.

1129
01:27:34,244 --> 01:27:37,736
Whatever, this is my last shot, and
you know l don't give retakes!

1130
01:27:37,848 --> 01:27:41,375
That's right! Because when Ok gives
a take- it is an Ok take!!

1131
01:27:41,552 --> 01:27:43,747
Roll sound!
- Speed!

1132
01:27:44,054 --> 01:27:45,749

1135
01:28:18,689 --> 01:28:20,748
''Love- man''! - To the rescue!

1136
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:24,218
Come, fly with me.

1137
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,761
Baby did you enjoy? - Yes!

1138
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:34,200
Come on! Let's dance!

1139
01:28:37,574 --> 01:28:39,064
''Oh my God..''

1140
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:43,669
''Oh my God..''

1141
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,815
''Oh my God..''

1142
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:52,749
Mongesh it's you? Where is Love?
- Man?

1143
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:55,215
''Oh my God..''

1144
01:28:56,693 --> 01:28:57,819
What a fish.

1145
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:01,820
Why didn't they check
with the weather guy?

1146
01:29:02,799 --> 01:29:04,528
Come on, come on, move it.

1147
01:29:08,205 --> 01:29:09,433
l don't believe this.

1148
01:29:14,211 --> 01:29:16,111
Hey Hero! Get some coffee!

1149
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:47,143
Hello. Who is there dude?

1150
01:29:50,514 --> 01:29:54,541
Hello. Anyone here?

1151
01:31:34,618 --> 01:31:39,715
Sir! What are you doing here?

1152
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:17,058
Who will win the best
actor award today?

1153
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,027
My friend, Om Kapoor should win!

1154
01:32:20,497 --> 01:32:21,521
Am l right, uncle?

1155
01:32:21,631 --> 01:32:23,861
l think Om Kapoor is just.. 'Wow!'

1156
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:26,102
lt's Stupid! l am going
to win! Of course.

1157
01:32:26,837 --> 01:32:30,136
Ok!!

1158
01:32:30,907 --> 01:32:34,468
Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen
and welcome to the filmfare awards!

1159
01:32:35,512 --> 01:32:37,412
l have come to fight for the
rights of slum dwellers!

1160
01:32:37,514 --> 01:32:39,641
And protest against
this award function!

1161
01:32:39,749 --> 01:32:43,515
Who is Om? Chunkey Pandey will win!

1162
01:32:44,521 --> 01:32:47,490
OK!
- What OK? Only FK!

1163
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:50,092
OK!

1164
01:32:50,193 --> 01:32:52,423
Just like ajeweler knows the true
worth of a diamond, likewise..

1165
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:55,054
..Only a 'Johar' knows the
true worth of a hero!

1166
01:32:55,899 --> 01:32:58,493
Of course. My son will
get it, Hrithik Roshan.

1167
01:32:59,069 --> 01:33:01,936
l think, it will have to be me.

1168
01:33:02,539 --> 01:33:05,804
Om and me.. you don't say
these things on camera..

1169
01:33:05,909 --> 01:33:07,501
.. we are just good friends.

1170
01:33:07,611 --> 01:33:11,638
Om Kapoor and me, we are
just good friends!

1171
01:33:11,781 --> 01:33:14,614
Om Kapoor and me are
just good friends.

1172
01:33:14,718 --> 01:33:17,516
Om Kapoor and me, we are
just good friends.

1173
01:33:17,687 --> 01:33:19,518
l think it should go to Om Kapoor.

1174
01:33:20,056 --> 01:33:21,080
Om Kapoor? Who?

1175
01:33:21,558 --> 01:33:23,549

l was thinking
- what if l was not your son?

1237
01:39:50,013 --> 01:39:53,949
lf l was not Om Kapoor
- only some random guy called Om..

1238
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:58,987
..then l wouldn't get all
this stardom, fame..

1239
01:39:59,422 --> 01:40:03,916
..and instead of this award l
may be holding this, who knows!

01:40:04,027 --> 01:40:05,426
Lying drunk some where!

1241

What took you so long?

My melodramatic mom!

1310
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,649
What is there to get scared?

1311
01:51:43,659 --> 01:51:48,221
You know however late it may get,
l will always come back home..

1312
01:51:51,767 --> 01:51:53,064
..to you! - Really?

1313
01:51:55,671 --> 01:51:58,697
Then why did you leave
me and go? Tell me?

1314
01:51:59,174 --> 01:52:00,641
Please forgive me today mother.

1315
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:08,673
l couldn't recognize you.

1316
01:52:12,688 --> 01:52:13,814
But you recognized me!

1317
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:18,654
lt's so true! Mother's
love is exceptional!

1318
01:52:21,797 --> 01:52:29,966
Oh! My Prince! My Prince!

1319
01:52:35,177 --> 01:52:36,235
Omi!

1320
01:52:50,225 --> 01:52:53,888
Hey! You have grown old!

1321
01:52:56,799 --> 01:53:01,031
But you are still the same..

1322
01:53:02,271 --> 01:53:03,738
..and now you have become
a star as well!

1323
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:09,868
You only told me to change
my name to a 'Kapoor'!

1324
01:53:12,414 --> 01:53:17,215
See Pappu! Didn't l tell you that my
son will definitely become a hero?!

1325
01:53:19,822 --> 01:53:22,017
Now you will not leave me and go?

1326
01:53:22,758 --> 01:53:27,092
No, l will not go
anywhere this time.

1327
01:53:27,196 --> 01:53:29,824
And this time all will be just fine.

1328
01:53:31,233 --> 01:53:32,257
Really?

1329
01:53:33,769 --> 01:53:34,827
Really!

1330
01:53:38,774 --> 01:53:40,799
No one will believe your story.

1331
01:53:42,211 --> 01:53:45,271
Sometimes truth is stranger
than fiction.

1332
01:53:46,115 --> 01:53:47,878
Om, we won't be able
to prove anything.

1333
01:53:48,784 --> 01:53:50,342
And that bastard will
get away again!

1334
01:53:50,452 --> 01:53:52,283
Shanti's body was not even found!

1335
01:53:53,789 --> 01:53:55,416
And Om, you also disappeared!

1336
01:53:57,059 --> 01:53:58,219
Without any proof..

1337
01:53:58,327 --> 01:54:00,693
lf you want something
with all your heart..

1338
01:54:00,796 --> 01:54:04,357
..then the entire universe
conspires for you to get it!

1339
01:54:07,936 --> 01:54:09,335
This is what we believed in Pappu!

1340
01:54:10,806 --> 01:54:14,367
Mukesh Mehra thinks he has
gotten away with murder!

1341
01:54:14,843 --> 01:54:16,834
No evidence! No witness!

1342
01:54:17,146 --> 01:54:22,778
But look at this divine
intervention ..

1343
01:54:24,286 --> 01:54:25,947
..which made me go back
to the same studio..

1344
01:54:26,054 --> 01:54:28,716
.. made me recognize myself
made me meet mother, you..

1345
01:54:28,824 --> 01:54:32,089
..all this is not just
a coincidence Pappu! No.

1346
01:54:33,862 --> 01:54:37,127
This story is being written
by somebody up there!

1347
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:42,036
But this time the climax of the
story will be decided by us.

1348
01:54:43,472 --> 01:54:50,173
l can't forget Shanti's
pitiful screams!

1349
01:54:53,282 --> 01:54:54,806
l couldn't save her that time ..

1350
01:54:54,917 --> 01:54:58,080
.. l was helpless, l was a nobody..

1351
01:54:58,187 --> 01:54:59,848
..but this time, the
tables have turned.

1352
01:54:59,955 --> 01:55:02,822
This time Mukesh Mehra will
pay for all his sins!

1353
01:55:03,892 --> 01:55:07,828
This time Shanti will
get justice Pappu.

1354
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:10,091
This time everything
will be all right.

1355
01:55:10,199 --> 01:55:17,833
Because the film is not
over yet, my friend!

1356
01:55:20,876 --> 01:55:22,867
You want to start 'Om
Shanti Om' again?

1357
01:55:22,978 --> 01:55:24,843
That's ridiculous!
You must be joking!

1358
01:55:24,947 --> 01:55:25,971
l'm serious Mukesh.

1359
01:55:26,882 --> 01:55:28,782
You know l get 3 to 4 scripts
offered everyday..

1360
01:55:28,884 --> 01:55:30,283
..but l reject all of them!

1361
01:55:30,385 --> 01:55:33,115
But 'Om Shanti Om'!

1362
01:55:33,889 --> 01:55:34,947
That's cool!

1363
01:55:35,057 --> 01:55:37,924
lt has emotion, drama,
romance, action .

1364
01:55:38,093 --> 01:55:39,958
l'm sure it's going to be
a blockbuster Mukesh!

1365
01:55:40,162 --> 01:55:42,255
Re-incarnation, rebirth..

1366
01:55:42,898 --> 01:55:46,299
..who's going to believe all this,
in this day and age?

1367
01:55:46,935 --> 01:55:48,926
How does it matter if anyone
else believes in it or not?

1368
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:51,234
As long as you believe in it..

1369
01:55:53,909 --> 01:55:57,868
.. as a maker, you have to believe
in the script Mukesh.

1370
01:55:58,347 --> 01:56:01,145
Call me Mike. Everyone
in Hollywood does!

1371
01:56:01,917 --> 01:56:04,442
Mike! Mukesh becomes Mike..
that's funny Mike!

1372
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:05,944
Thanks to Mike.

1373
01:56:06,054 --> 01:56:07,919
That film didn't even have a climax!

1374
01:56:08,924 --> 01:56:11,893
l mean that project was jinxed.
Bloody doomed!

1375
01:56:12,127 --> 01:56:15,824
Jinxed? The project was jinxed
for that lnsurance Company ..

1376
01:56:15,931 --> 01:56:19,059
.. who paid you four times the
actual price of your set!

1377
01:56:19,201 --> 01:56:21,829
Then you got married to that
Harsh Mittal's daughter ..

1378
01:56:21,937 --> 01:56:25,270
.. and got a big studio
as your wedding gift!

1379
01:56:25,974 --> 01:56:29,842
Then you went to Hollywood,
earned millions of dollars ..

1380
01:56:29,945 --> 01:56:33,847
..you didn't even take a single
shot and 'Om Shanti Om' ..

1381
01:56:33,949 --> 01:56:36,975
.. became the biggest film of your
career! So where is the jinx?

1382
01:56:39,388 --> 01:56:43,256
You know a lot about me Om!

1383
01:56:44,092 --> 01:56:47,425
Call me OK! Everyone
in Bollywood does!

1384
01:56:47,963 --> 01:56:50,932
Alright.
- Got you, dude. - OK!

1385
01:56:51,066 --> 01:56:52,863
And l Also know that a big accident
happened on your set..

1386
01:56:52,968 --> 01:56:55,493
.. and your heroine,
what was her name?

1387
01:56:56,071 --> 01:56:57,095
Shanti..

1388
01:56:57,205 --> 01:56:59,196
Ya Shanti, what..

1389
01:56:59,975 --> 01:57:00,999
..Shantipriya

1390
01:57:01,109 --> 01:57:04,374
Shantipriya. What happened to her?

1391
01:57:06,982 --> 01:57:10,008
She disappeared!

1392
01:57:10,152 --> 01:57:16,580
Oh. l tried to find her
but she was just gone!

1393
01:57:16,992 --> 01:57:23,955
Oh gone-if you search hard enough,
you can find God himself!

1394
01:57:25,267 --> 01:57:29,294
l don't think you tried too much!

1395
01:57:33,542 --> 01:57:38,980
l Like you man. lt's ajoke. Chill
dude. Hey.. Take it away!

1396
01:57:39,081 --> 01:57:40,105
Hey, take it away.

1397
01:57:42,284 --> 01:57:43,308
Are you Ok? Ok!

1398
01:57:43,418 --> 01:57:46,251
l am not Ok.

1399
01:57:48,123 --> 01:57:51,115
l am scared of fire!

1400
01:57:52,361 --> 01:57:53,385
Really?

1401
01:57:53,595 --> 01:57:55,995
l am scared of fire.
l don't know why.

1402
01:57:58,333 --> 01:58:01,928
And.. Seriously speaking if you
want to make any film with me ..

1403
01:58:02,037 --> 01:58:07,441
.. then it has to be 'Om Shanti
Om', otherwise l am not interested.

1404
01:58:11,179 --> 01:58:12,646
You know you are very stubborn OK.

1405
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,272
l know that.

1406
01:58:16,051 --> 01:58:17,075
l like that.

1407
01:58:18,053 --> 01:58:20,180
l am going to America for a month.

1408
01:58:20,322 --> 01:58:24,019
lf you find a heroine till then..

1409
01:58:25,427 --> 01:58:26,451
..we'll start the shoot!

1410
01:58:31,066 --> 01:58:32,090
You got it.

1411
01:58:33,201 --> 01:58:37,035
You got it. And don't worry
about the climax Mike.

1412
01:58:38,306 --> 01:58:42,538
This time l will write the end of
this story myself! Come on, Cheers.

1413
01:58:43,078 --> 01:58:44,102
To a new beginning!

1414
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:46,372
To a new end, Mike!

1415
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:00,594
'Pinch of this vermillion'..
shot 1, take 5!

1416
01:59:01,663 --> 01:59:05,099
Worth of a pinch of this vermillion
how would you know Ramesh!?

1417
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,564

.. how would you know Ramesh!?

1419

.. how would you know Ramesh!?

1421
01:59:14,576 --> 01:59:16,066
How would you know Yogesh..

1422
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:20,147
Not Yogesh! Ramesh! Say!
Worth of a pinch..

1423
01:59:20,515 --> 01:59:23,075
What is this pinch of
this vermillion..

1424
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,314
Say it with love!

1425
01:59:26,421 --> 01:59:28,013

..how would you know Ramesh!?

1427
01:59:30,459 --> 01:59:32,620
Gift from god..

1428
01:59:32,761 --> 01:59:34,592
Gift from what?

1429
01:59:34,729 --> 01:59:38,096
l'll kill myself. - You'll die!
- What are you doing?

1430
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,430
lt's a crown of pride..

02:00:08,230 --> 02:00:11,358
Who did you call Aunty?
Your mother?!

1459
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:13,225
Bye ok!

1460
02:00:13,335 --> 02:00:14,666
Later babes! Thanks mom!

1461
02:00:15,303 --> 02:00:20,434
lf it was 15-20 years earlier, then
l could have played Shanti's role!

1462
02:00:21,576 --> 02:00:24,136
We've packed up Om.. and
this was the last batch.

1463
02:00:24,613 --> 02:00:25,637
Ya whatever!

1464
02:00:25,814 --> 02:00:29,773
But none of them even remotely
resemble Shanti, you know that dude!

1465
02:00:30,185 --> 02:00:32,153
We'll find her Omi, we will
definitely find someone.

1466
02:00:32,254 --> 02:00:33,414
We don't have much time Pappu!

1467
02:00:34,189 --> 02:00:35,679
Mukesh Mehra will be
back in a few days!

1468
02:00:35,824 --> 02:00:40,761
How will we find her?
Where will we find her?

1469
02:00:41,196 --> 02:00:42,527
Excuse me!
- What?!

1470
02:00:43,532 --> 02:00:45,193
ls Om Kapoor here?

1471
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:47,158
No Om Kapoor is not here!

1472
02:00:47,536 --> 02:00:50,164
Go! We have already packed up!
Come for auditions tomorrow!

1473
02:00:50,572 --> 02:00:55,202
Tomorrow? But the watchman said
auditions are still going on..

1474
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:56,368
..and Om Kapoor is inside.

1475
02:00:57,212 --> 02:01:00,477
See, l have come to give an
audition all the way from Bangalore..

1476
02:01:00,782 --> 02:01:02,249
.. please give me a chance!

1477
02:01:03,218 --> 02:01:05,277
By the way, l am Sandy,
as in Sandhya.

1478
02:01:05,854 --> 02:01:10,621
l just love OK, and
l'm his biggest fan.

1479
02:01:11,459 --> 02:01:14,189
Actually audition is just
an excuse to meet Ok.

1480
02:01:14,362 --> 02:01:15,386
l only want his..

1481
02:01:15,564 --> 02:01:17,828
Oh Fish! She's fallen! Pappu
switch on the lights please!

1482
02:01:21,236 --> 02:01:22,260
What?

1483
02:01:26,408 --> 02:01:34,213
Grace and beauty walk with you.
Oh what a lovely sight!

1484
02:01:34,349 --> 02:01:42,256
And the moon bows down to you,
to beg for some ivory light.

1485
02:01:42,457 --> 02:01:50,387
Your gaze has seared my heart
so bad, hope it is not in vain.

1486
02:01:50,799 --> 02:01:59,639
l want to drown in your eyes
forever never to surface again!

1487
02:02:00,275 --> 02:02:06,339
ln your eyes there is this magic
l see, magic of a moonlit night.

1488
02:02:08,516 --> 02:02:14,250
ln your eyes there is this magic
l see, magic of a moonlit night.

1489
02:02:14,623 --> 02:02:19,185
Your breath blows like
a wind around me..

1490
02:02:19,294 --> 02:02:23,253
..carrying my heart away
like a weightless kite.

1491
02:03:23,525 --> 02:03:25,322
Good morning everybody!

1492
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,688
Dad the hero is here!

Already! But it is

02:03:37,639 --> 02:03:38,901
Cut it! Superb!

1496
02:03:40,775 --> 02:03:43,335
One minute director sir.
One more for me!

1497
02:03:43,445 --> 02:03:46,471
l can do better than this,
at least give me a chance..

1498
02:04:26,621 --> 02:04:30,557
Worth of a pinch of this
vermillion, how would you know?

1499
02:04:31,426 --> 02:04:35,920
lt's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

lt's a gift from God!
This crimson dot

lt's a crown of pride,

1503
02:04:53,848 --> 02:04:54,872
What's so funny?

1504

What is so damn funny!
What is so funny?

1505

Why are you laughing?
ls this ajoke?

02:05:00,455 --> 02:05:01,479
Why don't you understand?

1507
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:04,820
Pappu she can't be our Shantipriya.
She is not like Shanti at all!

1508
02:05:04,926 --> 02:05:06,655
She is so stupid!

1509
02:05:09,697 --> 02:05:12,029
l know you are not an actress
and you can't act..

1510
02:05:12,133 --> 02:05:13,430
.. but you can try at least!

1511
02:05:13,568 --> 02:05:15,763
We are all trying here!
You are laughing!

1512
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:19,634
lncompetent Mutt! Get out of here!

1513
02:05:21,643 --> 02:05:24,077
Now you've made her cry!!

1514
02:05:27,882 --> 02:05:29,975
Om, we all are trying!

1515
02:05:30,485 --> 02:05:32,476
But the poor thing doesn't even
know why are we doing all this!

1516
02:05:32,587 --> 02:05:33,918
What is our plan?! What plan!

1517
02:05:34,022 --> 02:05:35,046
This plan can only be
successful when..

1518
02:05:35,156 --> 02:05:36,783
.. Mukesh Mehra believes
that Shantipriya is back!

1519
02:05:37,492 --> 02:05:40,518
She only looks like Shantipriya!
She can't be like Shantipriya.

1520
02:05:40,628 --> 02:05:41,652
lt'll take one second for

1521
02:05:41,763 --> 02:05:43,458
Mukesh Mehra to figure out,
that she's not Shanti!

1522
02:05:43,565 --> 02:05:44,896
Then he's gone! He'll take
the next flight out!

1523
02:05:44,999 --> 02:05:46,057
The plan will be finished!

1524
02:05:46,167 --> 02:05:47,634
Then we'll have to tell
her everything Om!

1525
02:05:48,136 --> 02:05:50,934
We'll have to tell her what is all
this.. and why is it so important?

1526
02:05:52,607 --> 02:05:55,633
Before being Shanti, she will
have to understand her Om!

1527
02:05:58,746 --> 02:06:01,476
Om Shanti Om's story is
the story of my life.

1528
02:06:02,517 --> 02:06:04,542
l should have told you
all this before Sandy!

1529
02:06:07,555 --> 02:06:11,423
Because without understanding
Om's pain..

1530
02:06:11,526 --> 02:06:14,791
.. you won't be able
to be his Shanti.

1531
02:06:16,898 --> 02:06:18,559
But how could l tell you?

1532
02:06:21,536 --> 02:06:23,527
No one would have believed my story!

1533
02:06:26,975 --> 02:06:27,999
Not even you!

1534
02:06:28,109 --> 02:06:29,508
l will not believe your story Om?

1535
02:06:31,546 --> 02:06:33,446
When you jump from a fifty
storey building ..

1536
02:06:33,548 --> 02:06:35,812
.. and manage to stand on your
own two feet, l believe you.

1537
02:06:37,919 --> 02:06:41,514
You fight 100 goons and save
the heroine, l believe you!

1538
02:06:43,558 --> 02:06:47,790
You fly in the air, run on water!
l believe all this Om!

1539
02:06:49,197 --> 02:06:51,631
Then how could you ever think that
l will not believe your story?

1540
02:06:53,735 --> 02:06:59,867
l'm sorry Sandy. l really am..

1541
02:07:01,576 --> 02:07:05,068
lt's ok. There is still time!

1542
02:07:07,615 --> 02:07:09,549
And this time l will try
with all my heart Om!

1543
02:07:10,652 --> 02:07:11,676
And l won't let you down!

1544
02:08:01,636 --> 02:08:02,660
Thank you Sandy.

1545
02:08:04,672 --> 02:08:07,607
Mummy? - These are tears
of happiness my boy!

1546
02:08:13,214 --> 02:08:16,945
That's unbelievable OK!
ln such a short while..

1547
02:08:17,251 --> 02:08:19,549
The set, script, and
even the heroine?

1548
02:08:19,654 --> 02:08:21,679
..you have finalized everything.
- That's nothing.

1549
02:08:21,923 --> 02:08:24,619
My people have organized an
inaugural ceremony as well!

1550
02:08:24,759 --> 02:08:27,557
Oh God, no. This ceremony!
This offering of prayers..

1551
02:08:27,662 --> 02:08:30,563
.. taking the prints to
a temple for blessings..

1552
02:08:30,665 --> 02:08:32,690
.. all this still happens here?

1553
02:08:33,935 --> 02:08:35,061
lt's so damn primitive!

1554
02:08:35,169 --> 02:08:36,932
Even l don't believe in all this!

1555
02:08:37,271 --> 02:08:40,763
That's why l've kept the ceremony
at a very unusual place.

1556
02:08:42,677 --> 02:08:44,668
Stay cool, Mike.

1557
02:08:45,847 --> 02:08:47,644
l like surprises!

1558
02:08:47,749 --> 02:08:48,977
Oh yes! You will be surprised!

1559
02:09:18,713 --> 02:09:19,873
What the hell is this OK?

1560
02:09:21,716 --> 02:09:23,741
From all the places, you
had to find this place?

1561
02:09:24,752 --> 02:09:25,776
You know this is the
same place where?

1562
02:09:25,887 --> 02:09:27,616
This is the place where
the accident happened ..

1563
02:09:27,722 --> 02:09:29,747
.. and the entire studio
was burnt down!

1564
02:09:29,957 --> 02:09:31,686
l know, l know everything!

1565
02:09:31,826 --> 02:09:32,986
That's why l have chosen this place.

1566
02:09:33,361 --> 02:09:36,853
lt's called the 'circle
of life' Mike!

1567
02:09:37,298 --> 02:09:39,630
An unfinished story
should always start..

1568
02:09:39,734 --> 02:09:41,895
.. from the point where
we left it, right?

1569
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:46,104
Rockstar, okay.

1570
02:09:46,741 --> 02:09:48,936
Why did you resume making
Om Shanti Om?

1571
02:09:49,043 --> 02:09:50,738
How else would we finish
making the film?

1572
02:09:50,845 --> 02:09:52,710
And this place..
- Mike! Come on!

1573
02:09:53,948 --> 02:09:57,884
Sir. - And he is the director of
the film, what's your name?

1574
02:09:58,052 --> 02:10:01,249
F. Khan.
- Yes! My childhood friend F. Khan!

1575
02:10:02,757 --> 02:10:07,387
You should have checked with me
once. l wasn't expecting this!

1576
02:10:07,762 --> 02:10:10,822
There are lots of unexpected
things in store for you..

1577
02:10:11,132 --> 02:10:12,895
Dudes! The producer!

1578
02:10:13,034 --> 02:10:14,729
His friends call him Mike!

1579
02:10:14,869 --> 02:10:18,737
You can call him Mukesh Mehra!

1580
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:21,035
And now dudes, let's
talk about the babes!

1581
02:10:21,776 --> 02:10:25,837
The heroine of the film is,
what's her name? - Dolly!

1582
02:10:26,147 --> 02:10:29,844
My childhood friend, Dolly!
Oh! Here she comes!

1583
02:10:30,318 --> 02:10:32,878
Oh wow.

1584
02:10:33,087 --> 02:10:35,317
You will really like her Mike!
She's very sexy!

1585
02:10:35,790 --> 02:10:36,814
l hope so!

1586
02:10:37,058 --> 02:10:42,860
''When l touched it with my lips,
there was a commotion..''

1587
02:10:44,799 --> 02:10:45,823
That's her?!

1588
02:10:45,933 --> 02:10:48,163
No! That's Dolly's mom!

1589
02:10:50,004 --> 02:10:51,198
''There was a commotion..''

1590
02:10:51,305 --> 02:10:52,772
What's her name?
- Kamini.

1591
02:10:52,874 --> 02:10:54,865
Kamini my childhood friend!

1592
02:10:57,278 --> 02:10:58,768
Hello Mr. Producer!

1593
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,815
Baby was so excited to see you that
she didn't sleep the entire night!

1594
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:05,780
Only the fear of dark
circles made her sleep!

1595
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:09,788
But l never compromise
on my beauty sleep!

1596
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:11,825
l can see! You look
as fresh as a daisy!

1597
02:11:11,926 --> 02:11:13,188
Thank you! You 'cutey'!

1598
02:11:15,029 --> 02:11:17,122
Where is baby?
- There's baby!

1599
02:11:35,850 --> 02:11:40,344
Hey, answer our questions, please.

1600
02:11:44,992 --> 02:11:46,823
Beautiful girl!

1601
02:11:47,862 --> 02:11:52,390
Baby, touch his feet! Oh!
She is so talented!

1602
02:11:54,001 --> 02:11:55,025
Hello Omi!
- Yes Pappu!

1603
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:58,065
l am taking all of them on the set.
ls mom ready?

1604
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,969
Yes she is ready, but she
is really over acting!

1605
02:12:01,876 --> 02:12:03,002
That's our family problem!

1606
02:12:03,878 --> 02:12:07,314
Ten for.
- Oh mom! Let's go!

1607
02:12:08,182 --> 02:12:11,481
What let's go! You don't understand!
Let me come in the character!

1608
02:12:11,886 --> 02:12:13,376
You'll come in the
character for sure!

1609
02:12:13,487 --> 02:12:14,852
But we have to go now, they're
all ready! Let's go!

1610
02:12:14,956 --> 02:12:16,890
What was the line?
- Don't go inside!

1611
02:12:16,991 --> 02:12:18,015
Don't go inside!

1612
02:12:18,125 --> 02:12:20,855
ln my next film, l want a ponytail
like Mike's! lt's cool!

1613
02:12:25,933 --> 02:12:26,957
What happened Mike?

1614
02:12:28,102 --> 02:12:29,160
Why have you put up a set here?

1615
02:12:29,904 --> 02:12:33,897
Obviously man. l told you..
'circle of life'!

1616
02:12:34,008 --> 02:12:35,134
An unfinished story should
always start.. - l know!

1617
02:12:35,309 --> 02:12:37,869
You know! That's cool buddy!
Let's go!

02:12:38,246 --> 02:12:40,874
Come, we'll have fun.

1619
02:12:43,951 --> 02:12:46,044
Come on, let's go inside.

1620
02:12:46,153 --> 02:12:48,883
Beware! Don't go in!

1621
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:51,550
What the hell is this?
Don't touch me! Leave me!

1622
02:12:52,093 --> 02:12:56,359
Security. - She has been waiting
for you for a long time!

1623
02:12:56,464 --> 02:12:57,488
What's up, dude?

1624
02:12:58,065 --> 02:12:59,896
She will not leave you!

1625
02:13:00,001 --> 02:13:01,025
Who will not leave him?!

1626
02:13:01,135 --> 02:13:02,193
She will not leave you!
- Who will not leave him?!

1627
02:13:03,938 --> 02:13:05,166
Shanti!

1628
02:13:08,009 --> 02:13:11,342
Mummy! - Don't cry baby,
your liner will get spoilt.

1629
02:13:11,946 --> 02:13:13,413
She is a psycho mummy,
why are you getting scared?!

1630
02:13:14,982 --> 02:13:16,006
ls there someone inside?

1631
02:13:16,851 --> 02:13:17,909
Possible..

1632
02:13:21,956 --> 02:13:25,016
Mike! lsn't the set nice?!

1633
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:31,159
Oh, Mr. Rajesh. - Oh Dad!

1634
02:13:41,976 --> 02:13:43,034
Hey Mike.

1635
02:13:44,178 --> 02:13:46,510
Hi Mukesh!
- Hi Rajesh!

1636
02:13:46,614 --> 02:13:48,946
Mike meet Shahwar.
Shahwar meet Mike!

1637
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:51,951
He is the villain of our film!
A dude like you dude!

1638
02:13:52,253 --> 02:13:53,982
OK, it is time to break the coconut.

1639
02:13:54,088 --> 02:13:55,453
We have to break the coconut!
- What?!

1640
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:57,252
Coconut breaking time!

1641
02:13:57,358 --> 02:13:59,019
Everybody, let's go. Coconut time.

1642
02:14:01,028 --> 02:14:05,055
Priest. - Take this. Take this.
This is for peace.

1643
02:14:05,333 --> 02:14:08,097
'Om shanti shanti shanti'!

1644
02:14:08,202 --> 02:14:11,399
Oh for Peace! But Mukesh, the
coconut should break in one go!

1645
02:14:11,639 --> 02:14:14,301
Otherwise it's considered to
be inauspicious! Right Dad?

1646
02:14:14,408 --> 02:14:15,966
Oh of course! C'mon Mukesh!

1647
02:14:16,077 --> 02:14:17,101
You can do this.

1648
02:14:19,013 --> 02:14:24,007
Oh fish! Didn't break! Don't
worry Mike, try again! Go on!

1649
02:14:26,554 --> 02:14:30,547
Oh God! lt's very bad luck!
- Yeah! - Mike! Let me do it..

1650
02:14:30,658 --> 02:14:32,148
No! l'll do it!

1651
02:14:32,293 --> 02:14:33,988
Ok! One more time! C'mon guys!

1652
02:14:39,033 --> 02:14:40,091
Are you ok Mikey?

1653
02:14:40,201 --> 02:14:41,225
What is this nonsense!

1654
02:14:41,535 --> 02:14:43,935
Don't worry Mikey, l know
you are out of practice ..

1655
02:14:44,038 --> 02:14:47,166
.. you don't break coconuts
in Hollywood!

1656
02:14:48,409 --> 02:14:51,936
But here, before starting
any auspicious project..

1657
02:14:52,046 --> 02:14:54,310
.. we break a coconut ..for peace!

1658
02:14:54,582 --> 02:14:56,345
We can break all kind of nuts!
Come on!

1659
02:14:56,517 --> 02:14:59,008
Come on.

1660
02:15:03,591 --> 02:15:05,183
Congratulations.

1661
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:10,087
Ladies and Gentlemen.. Babes!
Lots of speeches today!

1662
02:15:11,465 --> 02:15:15,959
On this occasion we would
like to pay a tribute ..

1663
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:21,337
..to that actress for whom this
film was originally written!

1664
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:25,138
l believe wherever she is..

1665
02:15:26,147 --> 02:15:30,049
..she is watching over us.

1666
02:15:33,754 --> 02:15:36,120
Right! Ladies and Gentlemen ..

1667
02:15:37,191 --> 02:15:38,215
..Shantipriya!

1668
02:15:44,231 --> 02:15:47,997
And now l request Dolly
,my childhood friend ..

1669
02:15:48,102 --> 02:15:52,061
.. to light the lamp and take
Shantipriya's blessings.

1670
02:15:52,339 --> 02:15:55,103
While she does that l will
come down! Come on Dolly!

1671
02:16:04,618 --> 02:16:05,642
As soon as you press this button..

1672
02:16:05,753 --> 02:16:07,084
..there will be a spark
behind that photo.

1673
02:16:08,155 --> 02:16:11,090
lf there's no spark behind that
photo, l'll whack you!- lt'll happen!

1674
02:16:13,127 --> 02:16:15,652
One! Two! Three!

1675
02:16:29,276 --> 02:16:30,300
What's happening? Why
is it not working?

1676
02:16:30,778 --> 02:16:33,110
lt seems the wire is loose,
one minute..

1677
02:16:33,214 --> 02:16:35,148
How can it be loose? l told you
to check! - l'll just see!

1678
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:40,516
Oh shit. Oh fish.

1679
02:16:43,624 --> 02:16:45,421
Help!

1680
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,491
Come on, hurry up.

1681
02:16:48,662 --> 02:16:51,130
Someone put out the fire!

1682
02:16:53,167 --> 02:16:54,429
Run out.

1683
02:16:55,436 --> 02:16:56,494
Move back.

1684
02:16:57,171 --> 02:16:59,162
Don't go inside!

1685
02:17:02,176 --> 02:17:07,136
Mummy! What superb acting!! Take
this fake coconut from my side!

1686
02:17:08,382 --> 02:17:11,408
And take these fake eye
brows from my side too!!

Big day tomorrow Sandy!
You remember the plan?

1690

Yes.. but l'm nervous. What
if l make a mistake?

1691
02:17:25,266 --> 02:17:28,201
No! There will be no mistake.
Don't be nervous.

1692
02:17:28,536 --> 02:17:30,595
Let's discuss the plan
once more, alright?

1693
02:17:32,206 --> 02:17:35,539
Tomorrow we'll all be
there for the shooting.

1694
02:17:35,643 --> 02:17:39,306
Baby! Stop playing with your phone
and practice your dialogues!

1695
02:17:39,747 --> 02:17:40,771
Mukesh Mehra will also be there..

1696
02:17:45,219 --> 02:17:46,277
Madam your shot is ready.

1697
02:17:46,387 --> 02:17:48,855
Oh! Shot is ready! Let
me touch up my makeup!

1698
02:17:49,223 --> 02:17:50,349
Not yours, Dolly madam's shot..

1699
02:17:52,259 --> 02:17:54,124
As soon as l get a chance..

1700
02:17:54,228 --> 02:17:57,254
..l will send a message to
Mukesh from Dolly's phone..

1701
02:17:58,866 --> 02:18:03,530
.. telling him to meet her
in the make up room, alone.

1702
02:18:09,743 --> 02:18:13,873
As far as l know Mukesh,
he will definitely go.

1703
02:18:17,351 --> 02:18:18,613
Pappu, he's coming!

1704
02:18:19,253 --> 02:18:21,551
You take Sandy with you and

1705
02:18:22,356 --> 02:18:24,347
Nothing can go wrong now dude!

1706
02:18:29,663 --> 02:18:30,687
Where is she?!

1707
02:18:32,533 --> 02:18:35,229
Where is Dolly's mother Kamini?

1708
02:18:35,369 --> 02:18:36,393
She has gone to touch
up her make up!

1709
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:38,231
Why does she need touch ..
where has she gone?

1710
02:18:38,706 --> 02:18:39,730
Greenroom.

1711
02:18:40,541 --> 02:18:42,532
Where is she?!

1712
02:18:43,277 --> 02:18:44,335
Where is she?!

1713
02:18:48,716 --> 02:18:50,616
Oh Fish!

1714
02:18:53,287 --> 02:18:54,311
Kamini!

1715
02:19:01,328 --> 02:19:03,819
Kamini! Kamini!

1716
02:19:04,565 --> 02:19:07,557
OK, you! Why is he following me?

1717
02:19:08,302 --> 02:19:10,293
l know you don't need this..

1718
02:19:10,404 --> 02:19:13,339
..but you forgot your compact,
l came to give it .

1719
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:16,432
Oh! Very sweet of you! Why
did you take the trouble?

1720
02:19:16,577 --> 02:19:18,568
You should have sent
it with a spot boy.

1721
02:19:18,946 --> 02:19:20,277
No problem at all ma'am!

1722
02:19:20,981 --> 02:19:22,278
You cutey!

1723
02:19:23,584 --> 02:19:25,313
Kamini! One minute!

1724
02:19:27,821 --> 02:19:28,845
What are you doing?!

1725
02:19:30,557 --> 02:19:33,219
Compact was just an excuse..

1726
02:19:33,327 --> 02:19:37,354
..actually l wanted
to meet you alone.

1727
02:19:37,731 --> 02:19:38,755
Why?

1728
02:19:38,866 --> 02:19:42,927
Because, you know..

1729
02:19:44,338 --> 02:19:47,637
..l've always liked older women!

1730
02:19:54,948 --> 02:19:57,246
You know darling, when l
saw you the first time..

1731
02:19:57,351 --> 02:20:01,515
.. l knew that something
would happen between us.

1732
02:20:01,855 --> 02:20:04,449
But l didn't know it'll
happen so soon.

1733
02:20:04,892 --> 02:20:08,555
A sexy girl like you should
be in Hollywood!

1734
02:20:09,363 --> 02:20:10,489
l can take you there!

1735
02:20:11,498 --> 02:20:15,400
Just make sure this is our secret..

1736
02:20:22,943 --> 02:20:25,343
Mike what happened?

1737
02:20:25,713 --> 02:20:27,374
Hey, look at your hair,

There is somebody inside!

Oh God! Here also there is somebody?!

1741
02:20:34,455 --> 02:20:36,685
Mike you look as if
you've seen a ghost!

1742
02:20:37,391 --> 02:20:40,417
Ghost! l told baby not
to remove her make up!

1743
02:20:42,663 --> 02:20:43,857
Don't worry. Take it easy!

1744
02:20:49,069 --> 02:20:50,502
What are you doing Kamini! Please!

1745
02:20:51,405 --> 02:20:53,771
Mike come here! There

See. There is nobody here!

Did you see anyone going
out of this room? - No..

1748
02:21:03,417 --> 02:21:05,408
Did you see anyone going inside
the room?! Nobody is here Mike.

1749
02:21:05,519 --> 02:21:07,680
Dude, old man, relax!

1750
02:21:08,422 --> 02:21:10,822
By the way, what were you
doing in Dolly's greenroom?

1751
02:21:10,924 --> 02:21:12,414
Yes, what were you doing?

1752
02:21:13,594 --> 02:21:16,062
l was looking for a bathroom.
l was lost.

1753
02:21:16,463 --> 02:21:18,328
lf you want to use the
bathroom next time..

1754
02:21:18,432 --> 02:21:19,956
.. please go to my green
room, not Dolly's!

1755
02:21:20,067 --> 02:21:22,399
You should respect women,
what say Kamini?

1756
02:21:22,536 --> 02:21:24,800
And love them too!
- Kamini! Take it easy.

1757
02:21:28,442 --> 02:21:29,602
Cheers Mikey!

1758
02:21:30,944 --> 02:21:32,036
How are you feeling now?

1759
02:21:33,547 --> 02:21:36,072
l mean you've not been coming
for shooting lately.

1760
02:21:36,483 --> 02:21:40,419
The entire unit was missing you..
especially Dolly and her bathroom!

1761
02:21:42,022 --> 02:21:43,922
A producer has many other important
things to attend to Ok.

1762
02:21:44,825 --> 02:21:46,417
Anyways, you are there to
take care of the shoot!

1763

1765
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,093
Projectionist put reel number nine.

1766
02:21:56,603 --> 02:22:00,437
After watching these scenes..
you'll be stunned! lntense man!

1767
02:22:02,676 --> 02:22:05,611
l didn't know Ramesh that
you love me so much!

1768
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:09,506
And you want to marry me!
That also here..

1769
02:22:10,517 --> 02:22:12,985
Forgive me Ramesh!
l didn't trust you!

1770
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:15,554
You will come down from there,
dressed like a bride..

1771
02:22:16,557 --> 02:22:19,458
.. just like a fairy descending
from heaven..

1772
02:22:20,694 --> 02:22:21,718
Ramesh!

1773
02:22:23,497 --> 02:22:25,761
What's that? Take it easy!
What's wrong man?!

1774
02:22:26,533 --> 02:22:27,557
Did you see?
- Who?

1775
02:22:28,502 --> 02:22:30,493
Who?
- Her.. - Dolly?

1776
02:22:30,838 --> 02:22:31,930
NO! Not Dolly! That girl..

1777
02:22:32,039 --> 02:22:34,007
You're obsessed with Dolly!
Which girl? - The other girl!

1778
02:22:34,107 --> 02:22:36,507
lt's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

1779
02:22:36,944 --> 02:22:40,004
lt's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1780
02:22:40,113 --> 02:22:42,479
Mikey stop drinking! l think
you are getting high!

1781
02:22:43,050 --> 02:22:44,074

1782
02:22:44,184 --> 02:22:46,482

Stop the Projection!
Put on the lights!

1785
02:22:52,659 --> 02:22:54,820
Hey dude what are you doing?
What is this nonsense?

1786
02:22:55,529 --> 02:22:57,690
There is nobody on that
screen, except Dolly!

1787
02:22:57,798 --> 02:22:59,663
What's wrong with you?
You don't believe me?

1788
02:22:59,867 --> 02:23:03,166
One second! One second!
Projectionist play this reel again!

1789
02:23:03,537 --> 02:23:04,561
Ok Boss!

1790
02:23:04,705 --> 02:23:08,163
Relax! Watch now! Nobody
will come, watch!

1791
02:23:08,542 --> 02:23:10,567
lt's a gift from God!
This crimson dot.

1792
02:23:11,578 --> 02:23:13,842
lt's a crown of pride,
for an lndian bride!

1793
02:23:14,548 --> 02:23:16,607
lt's every woman's dream!
lt's ruby sheen!

1794
02:23:20,554 --> 02:23:23,045
What?! Everything is fine! See?

1795
02:23:24,057 --> 02:23:26,082
How is it possible?
- What is possible?

1796
02:23:27,995 --> 02:23:30,828
l swear OK! l saw her! She was here!

1797
02:23:30,931 --> 02:23:34,526
She was here, there! Who is
this girl you see everywhere?

1798
02:23:34,868 --> 02:23:36,802
First on the sets, then make
up room, and now here!

1799
02:23:37,571 --> 02:23:41,701
You know the entire unit is
already saying you are mad!

1800
02:23:41,808 --> 02:23:43,537
Tell me Mikey am l working
for a mad man?

1801
02:23:43,844 --> 02:23:45,835
lf the press gets to
know about this..

1802
02:23:45,946 --> 02:23:48,881
l'm not crazy goddammit!
l'm not crazy!

1803
02:23:49,016 --> 02:23:51,610
So then what? Am l crazy?!

l am handling everything be it
casting, ceremony or the shooting!

1805
02:23:55,923 --> 02:23:56,947
You don't even come on the sets!

1806
02:23:57,991 --> 02:24:00,858
And now this madness! What's
wrong with you Mike?

1807
02:24:00,961 --> 02:24:06,558
l don't know OK. l can't
understand anything!

1808
02:24:08,602 --> 02:24:11,628
l think l should go back
to America! - What?!

1809
02:24:12,005 --> 02:24:13,870
Yeah! That's what l'm going to do.

1810
02:24:15,876 --> 02:24:17,810
l think l will leave tomorrow
night itself!

1811
02:24:19,179 --> 02:24:21,579
No! You can't leave!

1812
02:24:21,949 --> 02:24:25,612
l mean we have our music
launch in two days!

1813
02:24:25,852 --> 02:24:27,581
You will have to stay
back for that atleast!

1814
02:24:27,688 --> 02:24:30,782
No OK! l can't stay here anymore!
l have to go.

1815
02:24:31,191 --> 02:24:32,522
No. Anyways you are here to take
care of the Music launch..

1816
02:24:32,626 --> 02:24:33,684
.. what's the big deal?

1817
02:24:33,794 --> 02:24:36,786
lt is a bloody big deal Mikey!

1818
02:24:37,698 --> 02:24:40,690
Media, guests, distributors,
everybody will be there..

1819
02:24:40,934 --> 02:24:42,595
And if the producer of the film
won't come how will it look?

1820
02:24:43,036 --> 02:24:45,630
And l am not your servant! No!

1821
02:24:46,206 --> 02:24:47,764
l can't handle everything for you!

1822
02:24:48,642 --> 02:24:50,667
l am a star Mikey, l'm a superstar!

1823
02:24:50,777 --> 02:24:51,801
So let me tell you one thing..

1824
02:24:52,012 --> 02:24:55,072
l am through with your 'Om Shanti
Om'! Take your film and stuff it!

1825
02:24:55,649 --> 02:24:56,707
Go back to L.A. Whatever!

1826
02:24:57,651 --> 02:24:59,551
And one more thing, l can
do ten other films..

1827
02:24:59,653 --> 02:25:02,554
.. but you have borrowed a lot
of money from the market..

1828
02:25:02,656 --> 02:25:06,683
..and if 'Om Shanti Om' is shelved
again, you will be on the roads!

1829
02:25:06,793 --> 02:25:08,055
You will be finished Mikey!

1830
02:25:08,161 --> 02:25:11,255
No, you can't do this!

1831
02:25:11,665 --> 02:25:13,724
Oh shut up! Don't
show me the finger!

1832
02:25:14,301 --> 02:25:16,735
l can do this and l will!

1833
02:25:18,205 --> 02:25:20,571
lf you want 'Om Shanti Om' to
finish, and get released ..

1834
02:25:20,674 --> 02:25:22,801
..then be there for
the music launch!

1835
02:25:22,943 --> 02:25:25,275
Otherwise you and your film
both, can go to hell!

1836
02:25:25,746 --> 02:25:29,648
Because frankly my dear,
l don't give a damn!

1837
02:25:30,917 --> 02:25:31,941
So fish it!

1838
02:25:37,691 --> 02:25:38,715
Have you lost it Om?

1839
02:25:39,026 --> 02:25:40,789
How will we prepare everything
in two days?

1840
02:25:41,962 --> 02:25:43,190
This plan was supposed to be
carried out after three weeks!

1841
02:25:43,296 --> 02:25:45,321
What could l do Pappu?
You were there!

1842
02:25:45,699 --> 02:25:47,030
He was saying he will
go back to America.

1843
02:25:47,234 --> 02:25:49,668
So l used any excuse to stop him!

1844
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:52,068
But Om, how will we make
it work in two days?

1845
02:25:52,839 --> 02:25:54,602
We have to fix the cameras
on the entire set..

1846
02:25:54,708 --> 02:25:56,699
..we have to build a monitor room!
Everyone will have to be briefed.

1847
02:25:57,711 --> 02:25:58,973
And even Sandy is not
fully ready yet!

1848
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:02,940
Om l will try, but what
if l make a mistake..

1849
02:26:03,817 --> 02:26:06,081
There can be no mistake now Sandy!

1850
02:26:07,721 --> 02:26:10,189
He can't get away this time!

1851
02:26:11,191 --> 02:26:15,628
We'll have to make Mukesh
Mehra believe that..

1852
02:26:15,729 --> 02:26:18,061
..that Shanti has come back!

1853
02:26:18,765 --> 02:26:20,960
That's the only way he'll confess!

1854
02:26:21,802 --> 02:26:22,826
lt's all upto you Sandy!

1855
02:26:23,737 --> 02:26:24,761
You'll have to scare him so much..

1856
02:26:24,871 --> 02:26:26,270
..that he blurts out the truth!

1857
02:26:26,373 --> 02:26:28,705
Frankly l have serious
doubts about your plan!

1858
02:26:29,109 --> 02:26:34,012
Scaring him off! Letting him think
that Shanti is back, forget it!

1859
02:26:34,281 --> 02:26:35,714
Nothing is going to happen
Om! He won't come.

1860
02:26:35,849 --> 02:26:36,873
He will run away tonight itself!

1861
02:26:36,983 --> 02:26:39,645
lf you want something
with all your heart..

1862
02:26:39,753 --> 02:26:43,780
.. the entire universe conspires
for you to get it!

1863
02:26:46,393 --> 02:26:47,724
He will definitely come Om!

1864
02:26:49,096 --> 02:26:50,393
Don't worry Son!

1865
02:26:52,332 --> 02:26:54,823
Pappu! You go and arrange
for everything!

1866
02:26:55,769 --> 02:26:57,327
l know he will come..

1867
02:26:58,805 --> 02:27:01,273
..because the film is not over yet!

1868
02:27:54,828 --> 02:28:01,131
There is tale l have to tell

1869
02:28:01,868 --> 02:28:08,171
About a man who lost his heart,
and gave up his life as well!

1870
02:28:08,842 --> 02:28:12,039
The one who loves this way..

1871
02:28:12,312 --> 02:28:15,475
Can he die? Even if
death takes him away?

1872
02:28:16,016 --> 02:28:21,818
Come, hear this fable today!!

1873
02:28:22,422 --> 02:28:27,758
Once upon a time a man
loved a beauty ..

1874
02:28:27,861 --> 02:28:34,425
..but his love for
her he had to hide!

1875
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:42,772
For the lady was famed for her
beauty..

1876
02:28:42,876 --> 02:28:48,837
..in the world far and wide!

1877
02:28:50,050 --> 02:28:56,785
A tale of these two hearts alone..

1878
02:28:56,890 --> 02:29:04,194
..is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1879
02:29:29,923 --> 02:29:36,453
The man had only one dream.

1880
02:29:36,930 --> 02:29:43,927
For the beautiful lady to
be his heart's queen!

1881
02:29:44,204 --> 02:29:51,042
The man had only one dream.

1882
02:29:51,244 --> 02:29:57,911
For the beautiful lady,
to be his heart's queen!

1883
02:29:58,018 --> 02:30:01,215
Little did he know,
it was all in vain..

1884
02:30:01,421 --> 02:30:04,913
What he thought was happiness,
turned out to be pain!

1885
02:30:05,058 --> 02:30:11,964
Why did this happen, and for
what ..is the entire tale!

1886
02:30:12,098 --> 02:30:14,862
The story goes..

1887
02:30:14,968 --> 02:30:23,933
The beauty had already
given her heart away.

1888
02:30:26,046 --> 02:30:31,882
Our man unaware, was
still ensnared..

1889
02:30:31,985 --> 02:30:38,015
But his dreams had
to shatter one day.

1890
02:30:39,559 --> 02:30:46,897
Tale of shattered dreams and
a broken heart left lone..

1891
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:53,997
.. is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1892
02:31:23,069 --> 02:31:29,599
There is a tale l have to tell..

1893
02:31:30,176 --> 02:31:37,048
The one who laughs the most,
one day he cries as well..

1894
02:31:37,317 --> 02:31:40,377
The beauty was, madly in love..

1895
02:31:40,687 --> 02:31:44,020
ln return she was battered!

1896
02:31:44,224 --> 02:31:50,459
Listen how her trust was
completely shattered!

1897
02:31:51,064 --> 02:31:53,464
The story goes..

1898
02:31:53,566 --> 02:32:03,032
The man, the beauty had her heart
on, from inside was a con!

1899
02:32:05,111 --> 02:32:08,512
Because she loved a rogue..

1900
02:32:08,615 --> 02:32:17,148
She was caught in his lies, and
one day he left her to die!

1901
02:32:18,458 --> 02:32:25,990
The heartbreak of a woman who died
lone..

1902
02:32:26,099 --> 02:32:32,732
..is the saga of 'Om Shanti Om'!

1903
02:32:33,173 --> 02:32:36,506
Why does a murderer not understand?

1904
02:32:36,743 --> 02:32:40,076
lt's a crime that cannot
be buried in the sand.

1905
02:32:40,313 --> 02:32:43,510
lt's a stain that never will
fade ,but is stamped.

1906
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:47,186
And will remain etched
forever on his hand!

1907
02:32:47,487 --> 02:32:50,547
When the beauty was slayed..

1908
02:32:51,124 --> 02:32:54,184
Someone did reach there in haste.

1909
02:32:54,494 --> 02:32:57,622
He tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1910
02:32:58,131 --> 02:33:01,589
Love had to shed
tears for the loss!

1911
02:33:01,768 --> 02:33:05,101
Love had to shed
tears for the loss!

1912
02:33:08,475 --> 02:33:11,205
The story goes..

1913
02:33:11,311 --> 02:33:16,044
That someone who saw
the killer's face..

1914
02:33:16,149 --> 02:33:20,745
..that man has come back today!

1915
02:33:22,689 --> 02:33:26,125
Listen to the life's pace..
what it says..

1916
02:33:26,226 --> 02:33:35,225
The felon should know now, death
is dancing around him and how!

1917
02:33:36,202 --> 02:33:43,438
This circle of life, death
and karma well known!

What happened?

1922
02:34:56,249 --> 02:34:59,878
Guests will walk on carpets
of petals and come in.

1923
02:35:00,887 --> 02:35:03,549
There we'll have a forty
piece orchestra.. ..

1924
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:05,382
playing Shanti's favourite songs.

1925
02:35:06,826 --> 02:35:11,160
Over there is a fountain with
champagne flowing in it..

1926
02:35:11,264 --> 02:35:12,322
..instead of water!

1927
02:35:13,333 --> 02:35:18,236
And under this magnificent
chandelier, we will get married.

1928
02:35:19,405 --> 02:35:20,429
Who are you?

1929
02:35:21,541 --> 02:35:23,236
And how do you know all this?

1930
02:35:23,343 --> 02:35:25,174
Ya, you said all these things..

1931
02:35:25,278 --> 02:35:28,304
..to Shanti when you were alone.

1932
02:35:29,315 --> 02:35:32,341
But there was someone
else there as well..

1933
02:35:33,419 --> 02:35:35,614
..who not only heard all this..

1934
02:35:35,722 --> 02:35:38,885
..but also witnessed your
horrifying crime!

1935
02:35:41,361 --> 02:35:43,795
That was me Mukesh!

1936
02:35:44,731 --> 02:35:49,259
No! That's not possible!

1937
02:35:49,402 --> 02:35:52,303
lmpossible, but true!

1938
02:35:53,573 --> 02:35:55,438
That night Shanti did not die alone!

1939
02:35:56,376 --> 02:35:57,604
l died with her!

1940
02:35:59,312 --> 02:36:00,336
Om Prakash!

1941
02:36:00,446 --> 02:36:05,281
Who used to play small roles in
your big films, a Junior artiste.

1942
02:36:06,486 --> 02:36:08,386
l could not save my Shanti.

1943
02:36:10,356 --> 02:36:11,618
But l will get justice for her!

1944
02:36:13,493 --> 02:36:14,824
You will be punished Mukesh!

1945
02:36:15,628 --> 02:36:17,289
You will pay for your sins!

1946
02:36:17,430 --> 02:36:19,523
Sandy this is your cue.
You know what to do?

1947
02:36:20,333 --> 02:36:22,563
Yes Pappu. But l am very scared!

1948
02:36:22,702 --> 02:36:24,363
This is no time to get scared, you
need to scare other people off!

1949
02:36:24,604 --> 02:36:27,300
Everything depends on
you now. You can do it!

1950
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:29,330
Best of lucks! Go dear!

1951
02:36:32,912 --> 02:36:37,611
That's brilliant OK! Fantastic!
You got me!

1952
02:36:38,885 --> 02:36:41,581
So you will send me to Prison? How ?

1953
02:36:42,989 --> 02:36:46,652
You will stand in the court and
narrate your saga of reincarnation?

1954
02:36:48,361 --> 02:36:49,828
Why don't we do one thing,
let me confess everything!

1955
02:36:49,929 --> 02:36:51,328
But who will make me confess?!

1956
02:36:51,464 --> 02:36:53,659
You or your duplicate Shanti?

1957
02:36:57,937 --> 02:37:01,270
You thought you will get a two
bit actress and scare me off..

1958
02:37:01,374 --> 02:37:03,365
.. so that l admit everything?

1959
02:37:04,944 --> 02:37:05,968
But you see OK..

1960
02:37:06,379 --> 02:37:08,506
Ghosts don't get hurt,
they don't bleed!

1961
02:37:08,715 --> 02:37:12,412
So now why don't you and your
goddamn Shanti go to hell!

1962
02:37:14,554 --> 02:37:15,816
Oh God! He knows everything!

1963
02:37:16,389 --> 02:37:18,983
Anwar stop Sandy! This
bastard can do anything!

1964
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:22,687
Pappu the door is jammed!

1965
02:37:27,667 --> 02:37:29,396
And you know what the problem is OK?

1966
02:37:29,802 --> 02:37:31,360
Court of law wants evidence..

1967
02:37:31,738 --> 02:37:33,467
..which you don't have.

1968
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:36,374
Even if l have killed Shanti,
then where is her body?

1969
02:37:37,543 --> 02:37:39,875
No one has found her body yet!

1970
02:37:41,414 --> 02:37:42,472
And believe me..

1971
02:37:43,449 --> 02:37:46,384
..OK, Om whatever!

1972
02:37:47,487 --> 02:37:49,387
Without this evidence..

1973
02:37:49,655 --> 02:37:51,555
.. even God can't touch me!

1974
02:37:53,426 --> 02:37:54,586
l will give the evidence, Mukesh!!

1975
02:37:58,831 --> 02:38:00,492
Oh God, Sandy.

1976
02:38:03,669 --> 02:38:05,603
Come! We were missing you!
- He knows.

1977
02:38:05,738 --> 02:38:07,865
You don't need to continue with
your rubbish acting now!

1978
02:38:08,441 --> 02:38:10,466
Go away, Sandy.
- Stop this acting or else..

1979
02:38:10,576 --> 02:38:14,706
Else what? You'll kill me? - Sandy
he knows everything, keep quiet!

1980
02:38:14,814 --> 02:38:16,008
How many times will
you kill me Mukesh?

1981
02:38:16,115 --> 02:38:17,480
Sandy he knows everything!
You just go from here.

1982
02:38:17,617 --> 02:38:20,415
Oh, just shut up. l don't want
to listen to your nonsense!

1983
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:21,612
You will have to listen Mukesh.

1984
02:38:22,688 --> 02:38:23,712
And listen carefully.

1985
02:38:24,824 --> 02:38:25,848
You came back that night!

1986
02:38:26,459 --> 02:38:29,428
After the fire died down,
you came back Mukesh!

1987
02:38:29,562 --> 02:38:30,688
Yes l did, so what?
- Sandy, listen to me Sandy.

1988
02:38:30,863 --> 02:38:32,455
To put away my dead body!

1989
02:38:32,565 --> 02:38:33,862
What rubbish!

1990
02:38:34,467 --> 02:38:35,695
l wasn't dead Mukesh!

1991
02:38:35,802 --> 02:38:36,826
l was still breathing!

1992
02:38:36,936 --> 02:38:39,598
How do you know all this?
- But you buried me alive!

1993
02:38:39,705 --> 02:38:40,729
How do you know all this?

1994
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:44,674
Under this chandeliar!
- Who are you?! - Stop it, Sandy!

1995
02:38:45,011 --> 02:38:47,377
The court needs proof..
- Stop it, l said, stop it.

1996
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:48,606
..they will get the proof Mukesh!

1997
02:38:48,714 --> 02:38:50,079
They will not get anything!

1998
02:38:51,617 --> 02:38:53,983
Right here under this chandelier,
they'll find Shanti's dead body!

1999
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:57,112
l said shut up! There
is nothing here!

2000
02:38:57,490 --> 02:38:58,855
Which you buried that night!

2001
02:38:58,958 --> 02:38:59,982
There is nothing here!

2002
02:39:00,092 --> 02:39:01,616
You are going to pay
for your sins Mukesh!

2003
02:39:02,495 --> 02:39:03,519
You are going to die!

2004
02:39:03,629 --> 02:39:05,494
Shut up! Or l will shoot you!

2005
02:39:05,765 --> 02:39:07,926
No!

2006
02:39:54,947 --> 02:39:56,141
No!

2007
02:40:08,561 --> 02:40:10,791
