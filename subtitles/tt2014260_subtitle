1
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,695
Thank you, Mrs. Randhawa.
Thank you so much.

2
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:25,797
In spite of being so
busy your husband...

3
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,899
...spares some time for the schooI
function. It's quite commendabIe.

4
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,526
Not a probIem, sir.
It's our pIeasure.

5
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,533
TeII me, does Ekam troubIe
you a Iot in schooI?

6
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,675
Oh, no, no, no. He's
such a sweet chiId.

7
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:37,710
He doesn't troubIe us at aII.

8
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,678
He has become a
favourite of aII teachers.

9
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,043
What is it, Mrs. Randhawa?

10
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:44,483
Is there anything speciaI today?
You have come earIy to pick up Ekam.

11
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,682
Sir, the speciaI thing is that
today is my wedding anniversary.

12
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:48,716
Okay.

13
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,484
So I thought I shouId
take Ekam home earIy today.

14
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,525
Oh, it's great. Congrats.

15
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,520
Thank you, sir.

16
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,628
First we go shopping. Then,
we'II go home and make cake.

17
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,256
ChocoIate cake. Right?

18
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,498
ChocoIate's your
favourite, isn't it?

19
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,060
Mummy, I want to ask you something.
- Yes, Ekam. What is it?

20
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:07,398
How much do you Iove papa?

21
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:10,069
I and your papa Iove
each other a Iot.

22
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,968
Where did you meet papa?

23
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,672
How did you get married?

24
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,906
It's a very Iong story.
How do I teII you?

25
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:18,609
No, I want to hear the story now.

26
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:22,280
Okay. I'II teII you the story
on the way back home. Okay?

27
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,686
Yes. TeII me.
- ShaII we go now?

28
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,553
Let's go.

29
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:47,369
'The story begins at
the viIIage SiaIkot.'

30
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,044
'Two gentIemen of that
pIace were very famous.'

31
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,908
'PritpaI Randhawa and
Shamsher Randhawa.'

32
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:56,047
'Once upon a time both the
Randhawas were very good friends.'

33
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:59,251
'But now their friendship
had turned into enmity.'

34
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:02,826
'And aII the viIIagers were
fed up of their enmity.'

35
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:20,007
'One had to aIways do the
opposite of what the other said.'

36
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,005
'They aIways kept on fighting.'

37
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,041
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

38
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:25,683
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

39
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:29,447
TeII me. - Look, PritpaI
and Shamsher are here.

40
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,790
Decision wiII be made
on what they agree.

41
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,382
Decision has been made.

42
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,521
Water wiII pass through
Kartare's fieIds.

43
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,960
How can the water pass
through his fieIds?

44
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,498
Headman, the decision
has been made.

45
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,801
Water wiII pass through
Kartare's fieIds.

46
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,239
I'II see how that happens.

47
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,648
'Both the Randhawas wouIdn't
Iet go of any opportunity... '

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,515
'... to Iook down upon each other.'

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,390
'And both of them had a son.'

50
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,059
'Yuvraj and Gurnur.'

51
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:16,059
Look at this. He scored
28 out of 100 in Punjabi.

52
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,269
Your son faiIed.

53
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,963
Why do you worry?

54
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,042
So what if he faiIed?

55
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,738
He scored one mark
more than his son.

56
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,480
WeII done, son. You
have made me happy.

57
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,282
It makes no difference to
me whether you pass or faiI.

58
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,486
But, son, aIways
remember one thing.

59
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,379
You have to aIways be a
step ahead of PritpaI's son.

60
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,827
They started incuIcating their
enmity in their chiIdren as weII.

61
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,327
And they taught them that he
shouId never accept defeat...

62
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,956
...from the other one's son.

63
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,335
ShaII we go now?

64
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:58,036
But why are you teIIing me the
story of these two gentIemen?

65
00:04:58,278 --> 00:04:59,905
I don't want to hear this story.

66
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,505
I don't want to hear this
story, teII me your story.

67
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,909
Oh, no. HoId on. I am teIIing you.

68
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,351
After some years, they grew up.

69
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:12,722
They became coIIege's
dashing, handsome rock stars.

70
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,900
We don't pick up a
fight without a reason.

71
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,806
We bestow our Iives if
anyone asks for it with Iove.

72
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:32,310
With Iove. With Iove.

73
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:35,371
We don't pick up a
fight without a reason.

74
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,743
We bestow our Iives if
anyone asks for it with Iove.

75
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:40,851
We enjoy eating and drinking.

76
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,852
The worId knows
how decent we are.

77
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:48,326
We might Iook simpIe and native.

78
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,894
We might Iook simpIe and native.

79
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,626
But we are crooked in many ways.

80
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,031
Come on.

81
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:59,295
Our enemies Iook
down in our presence.

82
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:04,969
Our enemies Iook
down in our presence.

83
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,711
Nothing is greater
than friendship.

84
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,746
We don't befriend smokers.

85
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,514
We don't.

86
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,248
Nothing is greater
than friendship.

87
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:20,015
We don't befriend
peopIe who show off.

88
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,859
We don't endure anyone's taunts.

89
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,793
We are ready to do anything
for the ones we Iove.

90
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:31,028
We know how to teach a Iesson...

91
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,866
We know how to teach a Iesson...

92
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,737
...to the one who
tries to act smart.

93
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,071
Come on.

94
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,474
Our enemies Iook
down in our presence.

95
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:45,609
Our enemies Iook
down in our presence.

96
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,488
So, Yuvraj, how do
we deaI with them?

97
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,526
One on one or aII in one go?

98
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,528
Ask the ones who are
about to get thrashed.

99
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,833
So, how do we deaI this?

100
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,304
ShouId we beat each one of
you or aII of you together?

101
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,712
How do you want to do it?

102
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,381
They are going to
get kicked for sure.

103
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,644
Whether they get kicked
one by one or in a group.

104
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,543
Say we'II go one on one.

105
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,345
Come one by one.

106
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:23,682
We wiII tear you apart.

107
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,691
Betia.
- Yes, brother?

108
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,554
You go first.

109
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,333
Dent their faces. Dent them.

110
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,390
Manna Singh.

111
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,467
Age wise you shouId go first.

112
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:40,329
Go for it.

113
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,040
Oh no.

114
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,941
Here comes my tiger.

115
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,480
WeII done, buddy.

116
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:56,545
You paid the price for
the tattoo on your bicep.

117
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,019
Come on, Jaggi.

118
00:07:58,324 --> 00:07:59,757
You shouId kick on his chest.

119
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:03,622
Karma, roar. I don't have
a Iot of expectations.

120
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,323
But I wiII have to send him.

121
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,897
Sheera, just go for it.

122
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,536
BodybuiIder, he is aII
set to touch his feet.

123
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,573
WeII done.

124
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:25,981
He's done for.

125
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:26,911
UseIess.

126
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,921
Come on. It's your turn now.
- It's aII set.

127
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,390
Come on, bodybuiIder.
It's your turn now.

128
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:36,359
I say I am hot tempered.
I fear I might kiII someone.

129
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,824
Hey, when wiII you make
use of your body? Strip.

130
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:39,930
Fine.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,897
Use your triceps.

132
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,297
Get this straight.

133
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,893
If you don't score,
don't come back.

134
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,771
Go back to your
viIIage. Don't spare him.

135
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:49,466
Fine.

136
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,673
Oh, it's not straight.

137
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,013
Have courage, dear. Have courage.

138
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,740
Your beIoved wiII
handIe each one of them.

139
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,753
Dinosaur.

140
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:04,718
Did you have to come at my turn?

141
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,383
Just a minute. Just a minute.

142
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,293
What's the hurry in getting
beaten? Let me remove my gIares.

143
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,923
They are worth Rs. 2200. Who
wiII pay for it if it breaks?

144
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,992
I get very angry when I
see a weak person Iike you.

145
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,905
There's a point. Who bothers
about bystanders in a fair?

146
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,236
The fight is between
the two of them.

147
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:23,935
If you stiII wish
to fight with me...

148
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,968
...then ask you Ieader once again.

149
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,272
Here you go.

150
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,740
I'm fearIess. I'm
fearIess. I'm fearIess.

151
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:33,945
I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess...

152
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,482
What? You didn't Iike it?

153
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,023
ScoundreI, I didn't
have any hopes from you.

154
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:41,754
Damn the fearIess.

155
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,589
They sometimes use deceit
and sometimes touch the feet.

156
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:45,958
Why don't they just give up?

157
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,432
Anyway, onIy the two of
us are brave in this group.

158
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,032
You and me.

159
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,597
I have had my turn.
Now it's your turn.

160
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,007
Go. Go and get even.

161
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,416
Now he wants to get kicked.

162
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:06,982
BodybuiIder, he is oIder than me.

163
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,282
He won't Iook nice,
getting thrashed.

164
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,551
Karma, I wiII have
to hit him as weII?

165
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:16,462
Looks Iike a bud has been pIucked.

166
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,450
Hit him, Gurnur. Hit
him. Don't spare him.

167
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
Hit him, Gurnur. - Don't
spare him, Gurnur. - Go for it.

168
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:44,390
Gurnur, hit him.
- Uproot him.

169
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:45,788
Break his knees.
- Come on.

170
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,348
Don't spare him.

171
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,724
Hit him. Hit him.

172
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,387
We have got hoId of him
with great difficuIty.

173
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:52,363
Hit him. Don't Iet him go.
- Hit him.

174
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,624
Break his knees.
- Hit him, Gurnur.

175
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,793
Hit him there.
- Teach him a Iesson.

176
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,426
Don't spare him.
- Don't spare him.

177
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,528
Break his bones.
- Hit him.

178
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:02,597
Hit him. - Break his
bones. - Hit him. Hit him.

179
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,438
Force him down to the ground.
- Hit him.

180
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,404
Oh no. Why did the
security have to come now?

181
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:09,511
They don't Iet us fight in peace.

182
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:13,509
Move aside, you...

183
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,511
I wiII...
- Oh no.

184
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,519
Wait. Let go of me.

185
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:59,386
Whiskey, my son, such a
big car in our viIIage?

186
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,361
And P. K. PaIta
doesn't know about it?

187
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,558
I wiII find out
about it right away.

188
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,964
Right away.
- Let it be, father.

189
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:07,905
Your wretched scooter is nothing
in comparison to the Iimousine.

190
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,441
You won't be abIe
to match up to it.

191
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,566
This is not a scooter, it is a jet.

192
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,440
It has foIIowed rockets,
this Iimousine is nothing.

193
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,038
We wiII foIIow it. Watch me.

194
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,340
Speed up, father.

195
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:20,318
Let's go, dear.
- Speed up, father.

196
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,916
Race it, father. Race it.
- Go for it.

197
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,647
Hurry up. Get to it.

198
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,730
Whiskey, I'II go and bait.

199
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,541
Father, bait won't heIp
here. This fish is very big.

200
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:47,409
Your father, P. K. PaIta
can trap the biggest fish.

201
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,678
HeIIo.

202
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:49,972
Yes?

203
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,345
Have you bought this mansion?

204
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:54,584
Yes. TeII me.

205
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,489
MyseIf P. K. PaIta.
Property deaIer.

206
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,719
PeopIe usuaIIy say
that drivers, cops...

207
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,591
...and property
deaIers are Iike dogs.

208
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:06,996
But I disagree, sir.
Not everyone is the same.

209
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,435
God have bIessed
me with everything.

210
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,802
I make fair deaIs.
It's as white as an egg.

211
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,604
I tried hard to seII this mansion.

212
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,002
Sir, nobody was ready to
give Rs. 3 crores for it.

213
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,073
I toId the owners that I wiII
crack a deaI for Rs. 2.5 crores.

214
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,511
Did you buy it for three?

215
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,420
I bought it in Rs. 4 crores.

216
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,083
Rs. 4 crores?

217
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,751
Desires don't have
price tags, mister...

218
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,428
- What did you say your name was?
- PaIta. P. K.

219
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,725
Mr. PaIta, my daughter Iiked
it and hence I bought it.

220
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,632
You said that you are
a property deaIer. - Yes.

221
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:49,741
I am Iooking for a piece of
Iand for my fertiIizer pIant.

222
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,674
Do you have anything in mind?

223
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,008
A Iand worth Rs. 1-2
crores is ready, sir.

224
00:13:55,448 --> 00:14:01,819
But I want to invest 9 miIIion
pounds on this fertiIizer pIant.

225
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:06,985
Let me know if you
have something in mind.

226
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,490
Yes, Mr. Bajwa. Send
those papers to my office.

227
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,462
Nine miIIion pounds.

228
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,356
I wonder how much it is in rupees.

229
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,290
Nine miIIion pounds.

230
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,969
Yes, it's a big amount. Why?

231
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,671
The empty mansion...

232
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,477
In the uphiII area...
- Yes.

233
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,910
It has been soId.

234
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,473
An NRI has come from EngIand.

235
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:32,715
Loaded.

236
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:34,678
He bought it.

237
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,280
For Rs. 4 crores.

238
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,392
Rs. 4 crores?

239
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,427
Nobody was ready to pay
Rs. 2.5 crores for it.

240
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,724
There's more.

241
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:50,361
He wants to spend 9 miIIion
pounds on a fertiIizer pIant.

242
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,272
9 miIIion pounds?

243
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,007
There's more.

244
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,540
He has a daughter.

245
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,474
She's beautifuI.

246
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,879
She's as oId as Gurnur.

247
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,514
I say if they get married...

248
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,791
We wiII be a notch
above your neighbour.

249
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,960
This is what I pray for to God.

250
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,827
Oh, Goddess, get them married.

251
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,273
I wiII offer an
umbreIIa, made of goId.

252
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,031
I'II make him give it.

253
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:35,937
PaIta, your scheme is good.

254
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,645
But keep one thing in mind.

255
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,718
He shouIdn't know about this.

256
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:49,861
Sir, what are you saying?

257
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,457
P. K. PaIta never backed off from
his words even when he is drunk.

258
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:54,794
I won't when I am sober.

259
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,737
I wiII never go there.

260
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:01,732
WiII you have some tea?

261
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,538
Forget the tea,
sir. I'm in a hurry.

262
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:08,940
The schooI is after me.

263
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,416
I have to get my younger
son enroIIed in the schooI.

264
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,019
They are asking for Rs. 25,000.

265
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,746
I wiII pay it.

266
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,818
Mr. PaIta, why are you hesitating?

267
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:27,462
Sir, I hesitate because
I stiII owe you some money.

268
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,433
Pay it Iater, together.

269
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,060
I'II go get it.

270
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,940
Here you go, Mr. PaIta.

271
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:41,838
Here's Rs. 25,000.
Get your son enroIIed.

272
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,042
Fine. My job is done.

273
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,716
But keep one thing in mind.

274
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:50,517
My neighbours shouIdn't even
get a hint about this NRI scheme.

275
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,683
Mr. Randhawa, you
shouIdn't have said that.

276
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,751
P. K. PaIta never backed off from
his words even when he is drunk.

277
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:57,796
I won't when I am sober.

278
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:01,433
I wiII never go to their house.

279
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:04,962
Hey, dad, what's up?

280
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:07,867
Come, dear. Sit down.

281
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,942
'Samosas' (Indian snacks).
Dad, so many caIories?

282
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,577
Oh, God.

283
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,939
Dear, I Ieft the fear of
caIories back in EngIand.

284
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:20,409
Now, in Punjab, I want
to start my Iife afresh.

285
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,547
'Samosas', 'JaIebis' (Indian
sweet), cottage cheese fritters.

286
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:27,057
No, dad. PIease. No thanks.

287
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:29,557
Have them, ma'am. They are way
better than your pizzas and burgers.

288
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,492
ReaIIy?

289
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,287
Thank you.

290
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,567
Dear, I have brought
you to Punjab...

291
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:42,064
...but I aIways worry whether
you wiII Iike this pIace or not.

292
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,637
WeII, dad, you and mom are
not going to stay together.

293
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:50,376
So...

294
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:54,282
Whether it's EngIand or Punjab,
what difference does it make?

295
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,585
I wiII have to get used to it.

296
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:58,983
Right?

297
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:05,753
Forget it. TeII me, how was
Noor's first day in coIIege?

298
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,489
Not bad.

299
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,224
Did you make any new friends?

300
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:12,929
Friends? No, dad. Not as yet.

301
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:17,866
But, I think I wiII
soon befriend someone.

302
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,644
Friendship? That too with a girI?

303
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,740
Dad, you forgot, you are my dad.

304
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,848
You shouId stop boys
from doing such things.

305
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,816
You shouIdn't encourage
them. You are strange.

306
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:30,012
What's strange in that,
father? This is a Iimit.

307
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,846
TeII me if you want
someone's bones broken.

308
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,891
You are asking me to fIirt with
a girI? It's not an easy thing.

309
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,927
I know it is not easy.

310
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,691
But tiII when wiII you
keep fighting smaII battIes?

311
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:44,463
It's time to fight a
big battIe. A big one.

312
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,872
Son, get this done for me.

313
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,739
Daddy, why are you
saying such dirty things?

314
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,969
I wiII teII mummy about it. Mummy.
- No.

315
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,239
You know how difficuIt it
is to romance with a girI?

316
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:55,712
You know what tantrums they have?

317
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,246
I cannot do this.

318
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,542
But I can do it on one condition.

319
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:01,778
What's the condition?

320
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,350
It wiII cost you
Rs. 25,000 a month.

321
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:05,651
Rs. 25,000?

322
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,425
Now you wiII charge
me for this as weII?

323
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:10,695
Have some shame.

324
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,799
Listen, give me a
father's discount.

325
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,259
Times have changed, father.

326
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,799
You must have cajoIed mother
with bangIes from the fair.

327
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,737
She is an NRI. NRI.

328
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,341
One has to feed pizzas
and pastas, father.

329
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,344
Pizzas and pastas.

330
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,777
It wiII cost you.

331
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,942
You can have the money.

332
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,347
Son, keep one thing in mind.

333
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:37,444
That girI shouId marry you.

334
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,421
Hear that.

335
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,955
An obedient chiId shouId
aIways Iisten to his parents.

336
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,926
You have pIeased me.

337
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:47,061
Dad, if it is so, then
consider the job done.

338
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:48,533
Print the invites.

339
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,293
Noor weds Gurnur.

340
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:52,436
Noor weds Gurnur.

341
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,703
It sounds good.

342
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:56,741
WeII done.

343
00:19:57,376 --> 00:20:00,402
Okay, father. Learn
to taIk in EngIish.

344
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,672
You wiII get an
NRI daughter-in-Iaw.

345
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,781
Even if I have to
bring her by force.

346
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,504
Excuse me? New admission?

347
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,640
Yes. I'm Noor.

348
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,377
Hi, I'm Nisha.
- Nice to meet you.

349
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,418
True. Sister-in-Iaw
is very beautifuI.

350
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,487
Just Iike Tom Cruise, the one
who acts in EngIish movies.

351
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,580
Tom Cruise?
- Yes.

352
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:19,851
ScoundreI, he is man.

353
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,325
The woman. In EngIish movies.

354
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:23,486
She is very beautifuI. Hot.

355
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:26,292
AngeIina JoIie?
- Yes. AngeIina DoIIy.

356
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,964
You are right, Karma.

357
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,801
This is the first time father
has put me on a good job.

358
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,801
BIess you, father.

359
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:36,873
Gurnur, if you cannot
get her then I can try.

360
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:39,667
Anyway, the guy who gets
such a beautifuI girI...

361
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,808
...gets a Iot of Iove.

362
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,677
And if a monkey Iike
you irritates her...

363
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:44,943
...then she gifts him
her sandaIs as weII.

364
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:45,949
Hit him.
- Sorry, brother.

365
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:46,985
She is your
sister-in-Iaw.

366
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:48,546
A sister-in-Iaw
is Iike a mother.

367
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:50,612
Sir is here. Sir is here.
- Get your act together.

368
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,122
He is here. He is here.
- Come on. Keep quiet.

369
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:55,924
Good morning, sir.

370
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,287
Good morning.

371
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,658
Your sister-in-Iaw is
standing, do your knees hurt?

372
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,826
Get up.
- I am.

373
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,060
Come on.
- I wish the same.

374
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,296
Good morning.

375
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:10,038
Good morning, sir.

376
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,674
Brother, first Noor stood up.

377
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,006
Then they stood up.

378
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:14,677
Now what do we do?

379
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,642
She is standing for no reason.

380
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,578
He thinks she is standing for him.

381
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,718
I didn't get you, brother.

382
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,310
You are there to support me.
That's the reason I feeI so brave.

383
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,018
Be brave, but don't
act Iike human. Come on.

384
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,086
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

385
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,351
What is wrong with them?

386
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:30,788
Everyone is standing up?

387
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,293
They never stood up
for the nationaI anthem.

388
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,862
Why did they get up to weIcome me?

389
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,299
Sit down.

390
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,735
Yes.

391
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:48,312
Who knows about Shakespeare?

392
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:49,471
Now who is he?

393
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,380
Is he your uncIe?

394
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,350
Is he your uncIe?

395
00:22:58,857 --> 00:22:59,846
I knew it.

396
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:04,462
Every one is Iooking down as
if they are guiIty of a crime.

397
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,493
Shakespeare...
- Excuse me, sir.

398
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,625
Yes, pIease.

399
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,360
WiIIiam Shakespeare was an
EngIish poet and pIaywright.

400
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,664
He is regarded as one of the greatest
writers of the EngIish Ianguage.

401
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,968
He's often caIIed the
EngIand's nationaI poet...

402
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:20,272
...and the Bard of Avon.

403
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:23,405
WiIIiam Shakespeare
died, ApriI 23rd 1616.

404
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,077
Heard your sister-in-Iaw
speak in EngIish?

405
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:27,877
Great.

406
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,544
Learn something from the girI.

407
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,316
She speaks such good EngIish.

408
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,454
Get this straight.

409
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,689
From tomorrow, in
my EngIish Iectures...

410
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,820
...no kid wiII speak in Punjabi.

411
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,623
Even if you want to
taIk to each other...

412
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,059
...you wiII taIk in EngIish.

413
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:44,729
Then it wouId be better
if we don't taIk at aII.

414
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,306
Anyway, if I wish
to Iearn EngIish...

415
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,532
...how Iong wiII it
take for me to Iearn it?

416
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,640
If you want to Iearn EngIish?
- Yes.

417
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,812
To teach someone Iike you EngIish...

418
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,748
...is same Iike tying
down a wiId buffaIo.

419
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:00,683
Sir, why don't you use
an EngIish idiom for it?

420
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,581
In EngIish?
- Forget it if you don't know it, sir.

421
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:06,424
No, it's not so.

422
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:08,687
According to me in
EngIish it means...

423
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,991
...To make an
EngIishman from a Desi...

424
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,758
...is equaI to make
siIk sari from jute.

425
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,764
Yuvraj, sister-in-Iaw
speaks fIuent EngIish.

426
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,669
Now what wiII you do?

427
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:22,771
It's a good thing. I was worried.
- About what?

428
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,739
Who wiII teach our chiIdren?
I don't know EngIish.

429
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,803
I think your sister-in-Iaw wiII
stay at home and teach them.

430
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,472
I say, you shouId go
right away, hoId her hand...

431
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,484
...and say it in EngIish,
Iike I am saying it. - What?

432
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,781
I cannot Iive without you.

433
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,918
Get Iost. ControI your emotions.

434
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:41,617
As if this is sister-in-Iaw's
hand. - Sister-in-Iaw's pet.

435
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,852
Then teII her in EngIish.

436
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,361
First teII me what I have to say.

437
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:45,656
We... I don't...

438
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:46,720
We... We...

439
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,799
ScoundreIs, why don't you say
something to him in EngIish?

440
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,298
Why shouId I aIone be doing this?

441
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,338
It's a different thing that I am
better in EngIish than you are.

442
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,895
You know more than us for sure.

443
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:57,339
You spend four years in each
cIass. We have spent onIy one year.

444
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,602
- There is bound to be a difference.
- Buddies, agree to it.

445
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,539
None of us know EngIish.

446
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,841
Yuvraj, you'II have to Iearn
EngIish if you wish to have the girI.

447
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,279
I'II have to Iearn EngIish.

448
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,486
But I am wondering
who wiII teach me.

449
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:14,521
Oh, my DoIIy.

450
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:17,058
I Iike meat and you
are a vegetarian.

451
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:19,797
As Iong as there is a
vesseI on the stove...

452
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,992
...I wiII keep you happy.

453
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,728
Temper the chicken.

454
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:25,827
I Iike the taste of bones.

455
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,839
Temper the chicken.

456
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,943
Mr. BhaIIa, I just tempered
spinach, not chicken.

457
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,738
Oh, my God. Today again
we are having spinach?

458
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,810
We had spinach yesterday
and the day before that...

459
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,506
We have been eating spinach
since the Iast six days.

460
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,050
When wiII you stop? When
my naveI turns green?

461
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,342
You don't vaIue
spinach's importance.

462
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,418
Spinach is the secret
to Iawyer Singhara.

463
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,649
Beware if you take Singhara's
name in front of me again.

464
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,791
He's a bad omen. He has
been after you since coIIege.

465
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,692
Because of him our marriage
was pushed back for six years.

466
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:52,786
Otherwise, we wouId have chiIdren...

467
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,799
...screaming and shouting
in our house Iong back.

468
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:58,494
You are just too much.
- Oh my. The girI is feeIing shy.

469
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:00,532
What shouId I do?

470
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:04,332
DoIIy darIing, I mean to say...

471
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,639
DoIIy? Where is she? You?

472
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:07,940
What was your hurry?

473
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:09,880
CouIdn't you come
after five minutes?

474
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,540
You broke my dream.

475
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,247
Good evening, sir.

476
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:16,314
Why take so much troubIe
when you don't know EngIish?

477
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,052
CouIdn't you just say heIIo?

478
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:20,386
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

479
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:21,818
What brings you here?

480
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:24,758
Sir, I want to Iearn EngIish.

481
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:26,994
You want to Iearn EngIish?
- Yes.

482
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,493
First Iearn your
mother tongue weII.

483
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,564
You can tackIe with the
other Ianguages Iater.

484
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,269
What? I'm not attempting to moIest
someone's daughter or sister.

485
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,032
I am just saying that
I want to Iearn EngIish.

486
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:40,040
Sir, it is very important
for me to Iearn EngIish.

487
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:44,076
I know that you are doing this
for someone's sister or daughter.

488
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:46,451
It's a different issue that you
are doing it through EngIish.

489
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:48,944
No. It's not so.

490
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,016
ActuaIIy, I was saying, why
don't we taIk about EngIish...

491
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,424
...whiIe drinking
EngIish Iiquor, sir?

492
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:58,760
Your case seems simiIar to mine.

493
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,927
Singhara and I were behind
the same girI in coIIege.

494
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:05,901
Her name was DoIIy.

495
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:07,568
DoIIy.

496
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,768
She couIdn't decide which
one she shouId choose.

497
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:11,805
Then?

498
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:14,038
Then we brought in
the third option.

499
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:17,439
Third option? Who?
- Pinky.

500
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,814
Pinky? Who Pinky?

501
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,253
From Moga.
- From Moga?

502
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:23,486
What is that?

503
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:27,919
Pinky from Moga is a girI...

504
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,820
...who has never
disappointed anyone.

505
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,526
ReaIIy? She seems very generous.

506
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,965
We got Singhara drunk
and sent him to her.

507
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,400
The second day
Singhara got dressed...

508
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,562
...and went to propose Pinky.

509
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:42,831
Did Pinky accept it?

510
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:46,069
No. She made a face and said...
- What did she say?

511
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,342
Brother, I'II think about
it and Iet you know tomorrow.

512
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:50,344
Singhara said if you too
wiII have to think then...

513
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:51,609
...it wouId be better
that I rather die.

514
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,914
Oh no.

515
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:55,210
Great.
- Enough of jokes.

516
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:57,719
Today, I make a promise to you.

517
00:27:58,023 --> 00:28:01,857
If I don't get you married to
Noor then don't caII me Love Guru.

518
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,495
But you, too, wiII have
to make me a promise.

519
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,958
You wiII have to memorise
the EngIish I teach you.

520
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,824
I'II do that.

521
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,326
But teII me, how Iong
wiII it take for...

522
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:13,834
...things to work out
between Noor and me.

523
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,567
It's not a cot that
I can make in an hour.

524
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,806
AIways remember...

525
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:22,878
...it takes time to acquire
girIs and mansions. - Okay.

526
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,915
If your friendship is
your weakest point...

527
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,549
...then you are the strongest
person in the worId.

528
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,820
In the worId.

529
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:34,318
What say? You didn't Iike it?

530
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:37,589
You think this EngIish wiII
be enough for sister-in-Iaw?

531
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,525
Yes. This is what
the professor said.

532
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:40,929
This is what the professor said.

533
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,024
This Iooks Iike a person of
Uttar Pradesh speaking in Punjabi.

534
00:28:43,268 --> 00:28:45,429
Get Iost. You cannot find a
difference between me and them?

535
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:47,834
There is a difference, but on
your face and not your tone.

536
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,407
I am your professor for the day.

537
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,267
Mind your manners in front of me.

538
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:55,278
Karma, I sometimes feeI
that the professor...

539
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,912
...drank Iiquor worth Rs. 450 but...

540
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,377
...he is not as great
as he cIaims he is.

541
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:01,885
He gave me just a Iine to memorise.

542
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,517
I was wondering the same.

543
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:05,486
A person who is
singIe at this age...

544
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,785
...how can he teach
you how to romanc

545
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,588
You are right. We wiII
taIk about it Iater.

546
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:10,753
It is 11 o'cIock. Your
sister-in-Iaw isn't here as yet.

547
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,389
I fear I might forget the Iine. It
took me a Iot of time to memorise it.

548
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:14,760
She is here.
- Sister-in-Iaw is here.

549
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,357
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Give me the book.

550
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,333
Move.

551
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,562
Oh God, heIp me with the girI.

552
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:24,969
Kids, what I am going
to teach you today...

553
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,977
Do you know who has said this?

554
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:29,471
I swear I don't know
who has said this.

555
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,448
I wiII teII you.
It's Abraham LincoIn.

556
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:35,014
He says... If your friendship
is your weakest point...

557
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,547
...then you are the strongest
person in the worId.

558
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,349
In the...
- WorId.

559
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,456
Yes. Got it?
- Yes.

560
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:43,460
Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:47,658
Yes. Now go home and work
hard. Make preparations Iike me.

562
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:50,701
Look, I Iearnt EngIish. You
wiII Iearn it as weII. Okay?

563
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:52,631
Memorise this and come
tomorrow. We wiII meet Iater.

564
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:54,001
Okay? Take care.

565
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:03,708
God has sent Yuvraj Iike
an angeI for EngIish for us.

566
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:06,450
We wouIdn't know
EngIish if not for him.

567
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:08,418
He spokes such fIuent EngIish...

568
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,318
I say, a person Iike
us wiII be tongue tied.

569
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:12,083
That's true.

570
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:13,991
Long Iive...
- Professor Yuvraj.

571
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,724
Long Iive...
- Professor Yuvraj.

572
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,284
Long Iive...
- Professor Yuvraj.

573
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:26,531
I don't understand Yuvraj
and I studied together.

574
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,937
Pass it to me. Pass it to me.
- He cannot speak in EngIish.

575
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,939
When did he Iearn EngIish?

576
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:32,435
No probIem.
- Get it. Get it. Get it.

577
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:33,478
What does he think?

578
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,843
He wiII get cIoser to the
girI if he speaks in EngIish?

579
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:39,741
Pass it. Pass it. - I think we,
too, wiII have to stop our rounds.

580
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,886
We, too, wiII have
to Iearn EngIish.

581
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:45,048
Kiddo, we aren't made
for Iearning EngIish.

582
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,750
We have been trying to Iearn
EngIish since the Iast 15 years.

583
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:47,985
We have wrecked our brains over it.

584
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,425
Did you get it? - Get the baII.
-Then how wiII we get it in 15 days?

585
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,690
We manage with Punjabi.

586
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:55,322
This is bad.

587
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,435
I cannot understand one thing.

588
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:05,636
Yuvraj and EngIish...

589
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:07,436
What is this aII about?

590
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,570
There is a catch, brother.

591
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:12,014
Prof. BhaIIa is giving
Yuvraj tuitions in EngIish.

592
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,415
Prof. BhaIIa.
- Yes.

593
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,279
The Sikh has become a traitor.

594
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:21,450
We aIready had onIy a few in
hand, now we Iost him as weII.

595
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:23,759
It wiII be difficuIt.
- Yes.

596
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:24,988
I have an idea.

597
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,760
BodybuiIder, you too get ideas?

598
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,297
I have a neighbour, a
Iawyer caIIed Singhara.

599
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:30,559
He can heIp us.

600
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,726
We haven't kiIIed a person
that we need a Iawyer.

601
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,838
Stupid, this is a matter of
the heart. A matter of heart.

602
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,304
BhaIIa and Singhara
were in the same coIIege.

603
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,610
And they were after the same
girI. The girI's name was DoIIy.

604
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,574
She went to UK.

605
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,041
Now both of them hate each other.

606
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,975
BhaIIa and Singhara.

607
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:49,915
And in between them is DoIIy.

608
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:51,583
BodybuiIder, teII me something.
- What?

609
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:54,489
Why do girIs make boys fight?
- True.

610
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:55,560
Singhara.

611
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,623
Now you are aII we have.

612
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,357
WonderfuI. WonderfuI. WonderfuI.

613
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,963
What are you Iooking
at, Mr. Singhara?

614
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:15,341
Ms. DoIIy, I feeI God
made you at Ieisure.

615
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:17,611
Otherwise, how can
anyone be so beautifuI?

616
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,343
Mr. Singhara, you are too much.

617
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,078
You keep praising me for no reason.

618
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,851
My Iove, I kept Ioitering in
coIIege for four years for you.

619
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:29,560
I tried to teII you something.

620
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:31,061
I couIdn't teII you.
I didn't have the courage.

621
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:33,924
Then muster courage
and teII me today.

622
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,792
DoIIy, if I couIdn't
teII you in four years...

623
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,763
...how do I say it right away?

624
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:40,932
Oh no, Mr. Singhara.

625
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,006
Does anyone take this Iong
to express his feeIings?

626
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,330
Say it today.

627
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:45,740
Idea.

628
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:49,504
I wiII cIose my eyes.
You say, one, two, three.

629
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:52,378
And then I wiII say,
DoIIy, I Iove you.

630
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:53,883
Start now.

631
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:55,581
One.

632
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:57,788
Two.

633
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,552
Three.
- I Iove you, my Iife.

634
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:03,953
DoIIy, I Iove you.

635
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:06,463
I Iove you, my Iife.

636
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,423
DoIIy, I Iove you.

637
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,760
I Iove you too.

638
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,669
So? You were romancing DoIIy?

639
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:19,067
Who are you?
- Sir, I am Gurnur.

640
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,344
What's your case?
- I Iike a girI.

641
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:23,773
And her parents
don't approve of you?

642
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,315
No, I wiII handIe her parents.

643
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,578
- So, your parents disapprove?
- My father is aIso ready.

644
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:29,483
In fact, my father has
made me go after the girI.

645
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:30,714
The girI doesn't agree.

646
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:33,016
I am not into the business
of convincing girI.

647
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:36,294
I am not running a
marriage bureau. Get going.

648
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,429
Look, sir, I had come
here with a Iot of hopes.

649
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,631
Son, I am not at aII
concerned with your hopes.

650
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,427
I wouId have heIped you if
you wouId've brought me a case.

651
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,892
Get going.

652
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:52,571
WeII, Gurnur Singh, if Yuvraj
has Prof. BhaIIa's support...

653
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:54,878
...then you have God's support.

654
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,673
Okay. Bye.

655
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:58,613
Just a minute, son. Just a minute.

656
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:02,343
TeII me, what does it have
to do with Prof. BhaIIa.

657
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,853
Prof. BhaIIa.
- Yes.

658
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:06,891
ActuaIIy a roguish boy
studies in our coIIege. - Okay.

659
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,953
Yuvraj. - Okay. -
He is eIder than me.

660
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,587
He is after the girI.

661
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:13,925
And Prof. BhaIIa is heIping him.

662
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:15,594
Both of them are
trying to trap the girI.

663
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:16,758
I Iove her.

664
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:19,067
Poor girI.

665
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,466
Prof. BhaIIa is a
very dangerous man.

666
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,504
I know him since he used
to run around in knickers.

667
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,606
He did something simiIar with me.
- ReaIIy?

668
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:30,580
He aIways interferes
in a Iove story. - Okay.

669
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:33,915
Don't worry, son. You have
come to the right pIace.

670
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,384
If he has Prof. BhaIIa...
- Yes.

671
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:39,413
Then you have Advocate

You must be feeIing

Punjab is not the same as UK.

683
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,909

00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,436

Come on. Come on. Get

697
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:52,856
He is an angeI.

698
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:55,729
SickIes Iost their sharpness.

699
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:58,498
Adversities turned back.

700
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,438
Not even a drop of water...

701
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,638
Not even a drop
of water went in...

702
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,543
Oh, God. Oh, God.

703
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,346
Got a fIat tyre?

704
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:11,879
Hear that.

705
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:13,816
This is the probIem
with expensive things.

706
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:15,452
They deceive you at the wrong time.

707
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,714
Excuse me? The tyre got punctured?

708
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,449
Hear that. The
coIIege is aIso over.

709
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:22,921
You won't find a
mechanic to fix it.

710
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:25,258
If you want, I can
drop you somewhere.

711
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,388
No, it's okay. I'II manage.

712
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,659
How wiII you manage?

713
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,733
I think you didn't recognise me.

714
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:32,559
We are in the same cIass.

715
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,930
I sit two benches behind you.

716
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,007
Where do you want to go? TeII me.

717
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,776
No, it's okay. I don't
want to bother you.

00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,869
It wiII not at aII bother me.
Come with me. I'II drop you.

719

Where do you want to go?

720
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:47,281
ActuaIIy, I wanted to go to
New Garden, but the tyre...

721
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,286
Not a probIem. I wiII

722
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:51,479
You wiII get your job done and

00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,563
Let me pIace it in the back.

730
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:06,970
Hop in. Oh, God.

00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,518
Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:36,932
These?
- Yes.

736
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:43,303
Costing, Shakespeare,
bioIogy, physics, economics.

737
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:44,975
I have aIready read them.
- Okay. Okay.

738
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:46,670
Now I teach.
- Whom?

739
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,776
Yuvraj. My friend.

740
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,573
First I teach him, then
he teaches poor chiIdren.

741
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,674
He Iearns EngIish from me.

742
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,979
Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

743
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,345
Yes. But you know what,
I saw him yesterday in coIIege.

744
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:59,913
ReaIIy? - Yes. He was giving
tuitions to some students.

745
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:02,658
He is my friend. A smaII
feIIow. He is oIder than me.

746
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,918
But he respects me.
He Iearns from me. Yes.

747
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,793
That is so sweet.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

748
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:09,465
You know you are
doing such a good deed.

749
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:11,330
I don't know whether it
is a good deed or not.

750
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:15,498
But I know that knowIedge and
Iove increases when you spread it.

751
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:16,833
So spread it as much as you can.

752
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,976
If you don't understand
anything in cIass... - Yes.

God.

756
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:28,045
You know... in London
girIs used to scare me...

757
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,647
...by teIIing me
about Punjabi boys.

758
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:31,949
Why? Do Punjabi boys bite?

759
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,047
No.
- Hear that.

760
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:37,523
They used to say that
Punjabi boys are that...

761
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,521
Handsome?
- No.

762
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:42,657
I cannot recoIIect.

763
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,827
They are young and strong.
- No.

764
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,832
This is what they must have said.

765
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,269
Yes, they are show-offs.

766
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,303
Punjabi boys are show-offs.

767
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,037
They are
show-offs? - Yes.

768
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:54,839
Gurnur Singh, she is
insuIting you on your face.

769
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,648
But I'm reaIIy happy that you
are not Iike other Punjabi boys.

770
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,808
No, I am just Iike
other Punjabi boys.

771
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,386
But we are not show-offs.

772
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,581
But if the girIs abroad have
that doubt then I shouId cIear it.

773
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,962
Wearing a new shirt everyday.

774
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:20,436

775
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,666
Going cIubbing on Saturdays.

776
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,004
We viIIagers have
got into such habits.

777
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:27,506
Wearing a new shirt everyday.

778
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,773

00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,280
We viIIagers have
got into such habits.

781
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:38,521
Madam, we are moody
but not show-offs.

We haven't come across the one
who can steaI our hearts away.

783
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:47,761
Madam, we are moody

We are not show-offs.

787
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,684
Dropping the roof of the jeep.

788
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,022

Using aIIoy wheeI tyres.

792
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,664
We go on rides everyday.

Who can dare to stop us?

794
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:34,808
Madam, we are moody

We bet on races at night.

801
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,409
We bet on who can
drink the fastest.

802
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,385
We bet about getting

803
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,480
We bet on races at night.

We are not show-offs.

813
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:55,325
We are not show-offs. - Who

814
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:56,690
Who wiII dare...

This is what I wiII do, brother.

819
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,389
At Ieast say thank you.

820
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,816
So... Thank you.
- Not a probIem.

821
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,794
So, now do you think
Punjabi boys are show-offs?

822
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,796
Punjabi boys are show-offs.

823
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,633
But they are a
IittIe sweet as weII.

824
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,499
You know you shouIdn't
caII Punjabis sweet.

825
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:45,403
Why? - Once they decide to go
after you, they don't stop.

826
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,738
Oh, reaIIy?
- Yes.

827
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:49,972
- Now that you are here...
- Yes? - Have a cup of coffee.

828
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:52,109
You are asking it so sweetIy.

829
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,977
I won't even mind
you serving me poison.

830
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:56,548
But you have asked at a wrong time.

831
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:57,679
Why? What happened?

832
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,382
It's time to go and teach Yuvraj.

833
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:01,789
TiII he doesn't Iearn from me
how wiII he teach the poor kids?

834
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:05,519
Right. - And we cannot ruin his
future for a cup of coffee, right?

835
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,496
We cannot.
- Right? So, maybe next time.

836
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:08,595
For sure.
- Okay?

837
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:09,859
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

838
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,628
Take care.
- Thanks. - Bye.

839
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,797
Forget coffee now I wiII
come here as your groom.

840
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,772
The water at the dam...

841
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,807
After that Mr. Chaudhary
said I regret it.

842
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:22,436
I wiII never say
such a thing again.

843
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:23,639
Hey, dad.
- Okay.

844
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,371

848
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:35,016
...Mr. Brar is handIing it

849
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:36,354
Oh, that's great.

850
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:40,285
Mr. Brar, she is my daughter, Noor.
- Okay.

851
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,896
UncIe, you shouId come

852
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,768
I am seeing dad Iaugh so
freeIy after such a Iong time.

853
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:50,337
If it is so then I shaII come

854
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:51,905
Come, Iet me introduce

855
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,000

00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:54,669
Karan...

857
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:03,509
He is my son, Karanveer.

858
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,047
He is in your coIIege.

859
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:06,555
Oh,

860
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:07,816
I am doing EngIish honours.

861
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:08,859
What about you?
- Commerce.

862
00:44:09,293 --> 00:44:10,282
Excuse me?

863
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:12,051
Commerce.

864
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,028
Okay. Commerce.
- Oh, commerce.

865
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:15,663
Very good.

866
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:19,998
You have to take over you
father's business in future.

867
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:23,001
Excuse me, Mr. Brar.
I wiII be right back.

868
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,041
Sure.
- Come, dear.

869
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:25,708
Okay.
- Your friend in EngIand had caIIed.

870
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:27,368
ReaIIy? What did she say?
- She was asking about you.

871
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:29,037
Not just his father's Mr. Bajwa?

872
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:32,740
Very soon he shaII take
over your business as weII.

873
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,446
What say, son? How
did you Iike the girI?

874
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:39,554
Sorry to say, papa,
the girI is hot.

875
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:42,518
The reeI her in.

876
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,754
No, papa, I wiII have
to use baits for her.

877
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:48,890
I mean to say if anyone dares
to come between me and Noor...

878
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,328
...then they wiII Iose their Iives.

879
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:55,295
Papa, you took it seriousIy.

880
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:58,539
If your friendship is
your weakest point...

881
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:02,367
...then you are the strongest
person in the worId.

882
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:03,605
Excuse me?

883
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:04,980
Yes?

884
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:07,711
Hi. Can I speak with
you for a minute?

885
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,848
I wanted to taIk to you.

886
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,614
Yes, sure. TaIk to me. No probIem.

887
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:19,285
ActuaIIy, I noticed that you are
teaching these poor chiIdren...

888
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:20,819
Yes. Yes. Yes.

889
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,465
But you are teaching the
same thing today as weII?

890
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:24,363
Why?

891
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:26,926
He can teach onIy the
Iines he has memorised.

892
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:27,971
He isn't a PhD.

893
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:29,768
Excuse me?
- Concentrate.

894
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:31,999
Rate of what?
- Concentrate on your studies.

895
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:35,445
ActuaIIy, they are
very weak students.

896
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:38,548
Everyday I teach them
the same Iine, ten times.

897
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:39,808
But they stiII don't get it.

898
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:42,045
I am tired. But I
haven't Iost hope.

899
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,580
I am stiII teaching them.
- That's sweet. Very sweet.

900
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:45,644
Thank you. Thank you.

901
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,348
Are you a professor here?

902
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:50,888
No, you are mistaken
because of this book...

903
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:52,860
...and my reading gIasses.

904
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,488
It's not so.

905
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:56,760
Let me change the game right away.

906
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:01,668
HoId it.
- You...

907
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:04,466
Let's go. I'II teII
you the rest on the way.

908
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:05,566
Let's go.
- Okay.

909
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,807
Fatso, I think she
has faIIen for it.

910
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:08,934
Strange.

911
00:46:09,947 --> 00:46:12,609
Sister-in-Iaw responded to
him and he changed compIeteIy.

912
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,746
You...

913
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,718
- What did you say your name was?
- Oh, I am Noor.

914
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,309
Sorry, I forgot.
- It's okay.

915
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:20,448
ActuaIIy, Ms. Noor, I do
things that make me happy.

916
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:23,591
I feeI I am doing a good
deed by teaching these kids.

917
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:24,719
Poor chiIdren wiII Iearn something.

918
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,422
They are poor. They wiII
be abIe to get a job.

919
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,021
They wiII be abIe to make a Iiving.

920
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,924
So nice of you.
- Thank you.

921
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,025
What you and your
friend Gurnur are doing...

922
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:33,835
Yes. Yes.
- It's fantastic.

923
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,530
What? Me? Friend?

924
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:37,739
Gurnur?

925
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:39,602
Where did you meet him?

926
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:41,907
Oh, I had a fIat tyre yesterday.

927
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:43,070
So he gave me a Iift.
- Okay.

928
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:48,474
He toId me how he teaches you
and how you teach the poor kids.

929
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:49,777
What has the scoundreI done?
- I...

930
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:50,616
It's amazing.

931
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:51,549
ReaIIy?

932
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:55,787
He didn't teII you who teaches him?

933
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,794
Who?
- Who?

934
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,523
Yes, who teaches him?

935
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:02,990
Pinky teaches him.
Pinky teaches him.

936
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:04,360
Pinky? Who Pinky?

937
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,594
Pinky from Moga.
- From Moga?

938
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:09,999
Yes, Pinky from Moga. I say...

939
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,500
She is his friend.

940
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:13,400
You mean girIfriend?
- Yes.

941
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:15,672
They are just waiting for
the coIIege to get over.

942
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,939
Then they wiII...
- Get married?

943
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,739
Oh, God. He didn't teII me.

944
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:22,285
That's a Iimit. Everyone in
the coIIege knows about it.

945
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:24,014
It's a match made in heaven.

946
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:26,789
It is a very good pair.
- Good?

947
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:28,016
WeII done, Gurnur.

948
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,350
You did a great job
with the tuition scheme.

949
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:32,023
Yuvraj wiII be stunned.

950
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:33,457
And we wiII win the game.

951
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:35,328
Yuvraj and everyone
eIse is my pupiI.

952
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:36,730
Now how do I praise myseIf?

953
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,892
You are right, brother.

954
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:40,863
I mean it's an epic pair.

955
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:42,769
What does that mean?

956
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,408
Like Heer and Ranjha.
- Understood. - Got it?

957
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:47,370
Heer and Ranjha. Proper, right?

958
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:49,671
There's Ranjha of
Pinky from Moga. Come.

959
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,872
Noor, Gurnur.

960
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,381
Oh, God. Oh, God.

961
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:53,642
Marriages are made in heaven.

962
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:55,651
What can we do about it? Right?
- Hey, Gurnur.

963
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,354
The brother and
sister are together.

964
00:47:58,422 --> 00:47:59,753
Keep roaming around. Don't study.

965
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:01,415
Did you Iearn the
Iesson I asked you to?

966
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,852
I did. Wait, I wiII
teach you a Iesson.

967
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,793
I did. He was asking
about the Iesson.

968
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:07,023
I did. -
Gurnur. - Yes.

969
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:08,525
This is so not fair.

970
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,464
What fair? - You toId me
everything about the friendship...

971
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:11,728
...you and Yuvraj share,

972
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,635
But you didn't teII me anything
about your girIfriend Pinky.

973
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:15,797
Pinky?

974
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:17,238
Who Pinky?

975
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:20,003
Pinky from Moga.
- From Moga?

976
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:21,635
Right.
- Pinky from Moga.

977
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,942
Pinky from Moga?
- Yes. Pinky from Moga.

978
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:25,276
So what? I toId her.

979
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,284
Noor is my future wife. I
mean it's a famiIy matter.

980
00:48:28,419 --> 00:48:29,909
Which is this Pinky from Moga?
- Gurnur,

981
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:32,387
from the time I found
out about you and Pinky...

982
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:33,386
I...
- No.

983
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:34,719
It's just so sweet.
- No. But...

984
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,688
I wish you both aIways be together.

985
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,260
It shouId. It's a
match made in heaven.

986
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:40,954
Pinky and Gurnur.
- Shut up.

987
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:44,262
I say it's a great pair.
Be prepared to dance. - No, no. I...

988
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,265
Just go for it, brother.
WeII done.

989
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:47,802
Give my regards to
sister-in-Iaw. - No.

990
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,735
Come, Iet's go.

991
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:50,273
Let's go. He has to
go meet Pinky.

992
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:51,968
Oh, bye. Have fun. He has to
go meet Pinky. - I didn't.

993
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,373
My younger brother is
going to get married.

994
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:54,502
Who is Pinky?

995
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,279
Now what do we say, brother?

996
00:48:57,348 --> 00:48:58,576
Is Pinky your
sister-in-Iaw? Who is Pinky?

997
00:48:58,649 --> 00:48:59,877
Brother, sorry.
- Who is Pinky?

998
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:01,545
How is that possibIe?

999
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:03,613
My tricks have never faiIed.

1000
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,483
You teII me in detaiI.

1001
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,283
What detaiIs do I teII you, sir?

1002
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:08,684
I just got ruined.

1003
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:11,289
He got me engaged to Pinky.

1004
00:49:11,795 --> 00:49:12,659
Pinky.

1005
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:13,922
Pinky.

1006
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:15,898
From Moga?
- From Moga.

1007
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,632
Who is Pinky from Moga, sir?

1008
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:20,466
I wiII teII you when
the time is right.

1009
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,369
By the way, BhaIIa
has made a nice move.

1010
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:24,838
Pinky.

1011
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:26,605
From Moga.

1012
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,234
TeII me something.
- Yes?

1013
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:31,713
How wiII you feeI if you get a
chance to give Noor a tight huge?

1014
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:35,012
Sir, it wiII be Iike
the cat getting a mouse...

1015
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:36,685
...uncIe meeting aunt,
Ranjha getting Heer...

1016
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,244
...and a starved person
getting 'Kheer'(Indian sweet).

1017
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:39,253
It wiII be great.

1018
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:40,624
Then do one thing.
- Yes?

1019
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:41,919
Don't go to coIIege tomorrow.

1020
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:44,358
Don't' go to coIIege.

1021
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,259
First you taIk about hugging her
then you say don't go to coIIege.

1022
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,864
Go to coIIege day after tomorrow...

1023
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,831
...and give Noor a tight hug.

1024
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:52,299
She is a smart girI.
I wiII get thrashed.

1025
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:53,495
You won't get thrashed.

1026
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:55,332
You wiII get a hug. A hug.

1027
00:49:56,273 --> 00:49:57,706
Sure?
- Yes.

1028
00:49:57,808 --> 00:49:58,740
I won't get thrashed.
- No.

1029
00:49:58,809 --> 00:49:59,833
Sure?
- Yes.

1030
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,902
- BIess you, sir.
- He is very famous.

1031
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,044
It's hard to be separated
from brother ChamkiIa.

1032
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,547
You shouIdn't
betray your friends.

1033
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:10,712
Why don't I see the
anti-party in coIIege today?

1034
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:13,013
Have we reaIIy swashed them out?

1035
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,557
You have naiIed it.

1036
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:16,455
I say, we wiII have
a Iot of fun then.

1037
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,492
I'm fearIess. I'm fearIess.
I'm fearIess. - Sit down.

1038
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:19,822
He acts Iike SaIman Khan.

1039
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:22,365
He puts now gIasses in
front and one at the back.

1040
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:23,827
He ruined my pose.

1041
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:26,765
I was confident that today I
wouId sureIy get some this coIIege.

1042
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:28,963
- She is coming. She is coming.
- Where is she?

1043
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,974
Your cIasses started? - I think
your sister-in-Iaw is aIso with her.

1044
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:33,374
I am taIking about
your sister-in-Iaw.

1045
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:34,911
Shut up. Stop taIking about
sisters-in-Iaw. Get out.

1046
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,006
Bye. Take care.
- Pick up the spares, driver.

1047
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,673
Bye. See you Iater.
- You might Iose one of them.

1048
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:41,582
Go for it.
- Go from there. Go from that side.

1049
00:50:49,893 --> 00:50:51,986
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

1050
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:53,455
What is it? Why
are you aIone today?

1051
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,519
Where are your students?

1052
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:56,691
Students? I am just
coming after teaching them.

1053
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,833
I was thinking if I find a friend
I wiII go for a cup of coffee.

1054
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,767
- Friend? - Yes.
- Where is Gurnur?

1055
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:05,707
You know him. He must have gone
to have coffee with his Pinky.

1056
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:07,434
Oh, so sad.

1057
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:11,341
WeII, Yuvraj, I cannot take
Gurnur's pIace in your Iife.

1058
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,579
Fine. If Gurnur is not here
then make do with Noor today.

1059
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:17,380
Make do? What are you saying?

1060
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,282
There is no comparison.

1061
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:21,823
Open the door and get in, dear.

1062
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:22,984
Okay. - And
yes... - Yes?

1063
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,789
Dust your shoes before
you get in, dear.

1064
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:27,626
This car is Ioved by its owner.

1065
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,626
Keep it here, Chotu.

1066
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:32,562
Keep it here, Chotu.

1067
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,394
Yes. Just a minute.

1068
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:37,406
I think we shouId forget
the coffee and have tea.

1069
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:38,970
Chotu, get two cups of tea.

1070
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:40,738
Why? What happened? Why tea?

1071
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:43,779
ActuaIIy, I have had coffee
with 2-3 girIs. - Yes?

1072
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,641
As soon as the coffee
got over they proposed me.

1073
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:47,781
ReaIIy?

1074
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:50,510
They had to propose you.

1075
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:53,417
It's not easy to find
an educated boy Iike you.

1076
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:54,758
Educated?

1077
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:57,460
There are a Iot of
educated boys around.

1078
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,018
This is the onIy
quaIity you found in me?

1079
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:02,330
No. I mean educated...

1080
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,291
Yes, kind-hearted.

1081
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:08,334
Kind-hearted. Even BhoIa in
the canteen is kind-hearted.

1082
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:09,394
TeII me more.

1083
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:11,470
Okay.

1084
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:17,837
Educated, kind-hearted, good
Iooking, handsome, smart...

1085
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:20,475
...inteIIigent and better
than everybody eIse.

1086
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:21,347
Okay?

1087
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:24,883
I cannot praise you
more than that. Okay?

1088
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:25,948
It's okay.

1089
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:27,954
Just a second. Sorry.

1090
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:30,456
HeIIo.

1091
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:44,336
I Iost it. I Iost my heart.

1092
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:47,638
I was Ieft with nothing.

1093
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:52,342
I Iost it. I Iost my heart.

1094
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,442
I was Ieft with nothing.

1095
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:58,513
Her eyes kiIIed me.

1096
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:03,424
Her eyes kiIIed me.

1097
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:06,554
Now there is no way
I am going to survive.

1098
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:09,823
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1099
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,925
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1100
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:15,432
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1101
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,565
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1102
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:30,647
My innocent heart got trapped.

1103
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:33,312
It got trapped.

1104
00:53:33,524 --> 00:53:35,992
It deceived me and
started beIonging to you.

1105
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:39,057
It started beIonging to you.

1106
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:44,095
My innocent heart got trapped.

1107
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:47,531
It deceived me and
started beIonging to you.

1108
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,706
Whenever it sees you,
oh beautifuI girI...

1109
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,301
Whenever it sees you,
oh beautifuI girI...

1110
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:58,439
...it starts dancing.

1111
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,909
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1112
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,976
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1113
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:07,416
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1114
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,516
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1115
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:22,829
I have known guns and
buIIets since eons.

1116
00:54:22,906 --> 00:54:25,466
I have known them since eons.

1117
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,941
Your eyes targeted my heart.

1118
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,775
It targeted my heart.

1119
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:36,075
I have known guns and
buIIets since eons.

1120
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,289
Your eyes targeted my heart.

1121
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:42,784
Take aII you want,
oh beautifuI girI...

1122
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:47,388
Take aII you want,
oh beautifuI girI...

1123
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:50,490
...it keeps on chanting your name.

1124
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,836
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1125
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:55,895
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1126
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:59,304
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1127
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:01,343
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1128
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:04,571
The one with cat eyes, your
eyes are creating havoc.

1129
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,707
Your eyes are creating havoc.

1130
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:09,013
But, sir, I didn't understand
one thing. - What?

1131
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:13,518
Why do you wish to Ieave
Birmingham, London and Iive here?

1132
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,860
ActuaIIy, Mr. PaIta,
I never Iiked that pIace.

1133
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:27,293
That's why eIders rightIy say that
there is no pIace such as home.

1134
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,402
Chotu, see who's at the door.

1135
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:32,768
I'II go and check, sir.

1136
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:34,777
I'II go and check. It's
just Iike my own house.

1137
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:40,908
HeIIo, sir.

1138
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:42,747
Yes, teII me, who
do you wish to meet?

1139
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,378
Oh no. You...

1140
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:46,680
HeIIo, sir.

1141
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:49,055
PaIta, what are you doing here?

1142
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,418
I have set the bait for you.
- ReaIIy?

1143
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:53,929
The fish is about to get trapped.

1144
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:56,732
Come in, sir. Come in.

1145
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,767
Okay.
- Come in.

1146
00:55:57,834 --> 00:55:59,358
This way. This way.

1147
00:56:00,404 --> 00:56:02,463
He is Mr. Randhawa. Our neighbour.

1148
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:04,506
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

1149
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:05,598
Come, have a seat.

1150
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,573
I thought an NRI has
come in my neighbourhood.

1151
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:11,039
I have a duty to serve him.

1152
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:12,781
You might need something.

1153
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:14,040
Thanks.

1154
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:15,881
My bungaIow is right there.

1155
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,479
Look, Mr. Bajwa, Iook at fate.

1156
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:21,250
We are neighbours and our
chiIdren study together.

1157
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:25,293
Oh, so your son too
studies in Noor's coIIege?

1158
00:56:25,362 --> 00:56:27,523
Yes.
- In the same cIass.

1159
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:29,590
I'II go and check.

1160
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:31,458
Now it is my house.

1161
00:56:35,405 --> 00:56:36,394
Hey...

1162
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:40,543
PaIta, you, over here?

1163
00:56:45,782 --> 00:56:48,342
You were setting
things right for me.

1164
00:56:48,852 --> 00:56:50,547
Stuck between the deviI
and the deep bIue sea.

1165
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:52,713
Now onIy you can heIp me, God.

1166
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:55,621
Has the fish taken the bait?

1167
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:58,954
Now the fish wiII get confused
as to which bait it shouId take.

1168
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:00,687
Confuse?

1169
00:57:01,431 --> 00:57:03,763
I mean the fish is a IittIe heavy.

1170
00:57:03,934 --> 00:57:05,367
It wiII take some
time to take the bait.

1171
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,837
Mr. PaIta, who is at the door?

1172
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:10,873
Let's go. He is
caIIing us. Let's go.

1173
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:14,375
Come in.
- HeIIo. I am PritpaI.

1174
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:15,467
Your neighbour.

1175
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:17,704
You are new here. You are an NRI.

1176
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:20,281
It is my duty to
enquire your weIIbeing.

1177
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:25,418
You can approach me without
hesitation if you need anything.

1178
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:26,848
Come, have a seat.

1179
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:29,723
What a coincidence.

1180
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:32,486
Mr. Randhawa just came here.

1181
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:34,395
It's great.

1182
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:37,495
Today, both my neighbours have
come here at the same time.

1183
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,969
I am sure you both know each other.

1184
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:41,298
Very weII.

1185
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:42,870
They used to pIay together.

1186
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:46,365
Saw, Mr. PaIta,
you were asking me...

1187
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:48,707
...why I Ieft EngIand
and came to Punjab.

1188
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,609
This is our Punjab.

1189
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:56,648
Look, here neighbours
Iive Iike reIatives.

1190
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:59,354
They are Iike bread and butter.

1191
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:06,219
Noor, I wish I, too, had a
girI Iike Pinky in my Iife.

1192
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:07,752
Who Pinky?

1193
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:09,420
Pinky from Moga.

1194
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,727
Oh, God. Pinky from Moga.
- Yes.

1195
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:16,236
WeII, you know what, there
is someone made for everyone.

1196
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:19,738
And I am sure, Yuvraj, you
too wiII find a nice girI.

1197
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:20,968
Nice girI? Right.

1198
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:24,810
I mean someone Iike you...

1199
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:26,778
Like I...

1200
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,819
I mean we...
- Gurnur. Hi.

1201
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,517
Okay.
- He is here.

1202
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,621
I cannot taIk to her now.

1203
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:36,824
What happened? You
don't have a Iecture?

1204
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,722
Show off ruined everything.
- HeIIo.

1205
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:42,959
Why is he making faces?

1206
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,033
Hey, Gurnur.

1207
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:50,000
Gurnur, what happened?

1208
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:00,878
Gurnur, why are you so sad?

1209
00:59:04,454 --> 00:59:06,285
I think he is pretending.

1210
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:13,888
I think he wiII start crying.
- Gurnur...

1211
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,029
There he goes. - Gurnur,
wiII you teII me what's wrong?

1212
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:17,494
He is going for the kiII.

1213
00:59:20,036 --> 00:59:20,934
Oh damn!

1214
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:23,735
What's wrong? What happened?
- Let go.

1215
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:26,037
Why are you hugging
her? What happened?

1216
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:30,377
TeII us what happened.
- Gurnur...

1217
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,382
BIoody Ieech. You
keep on hugging her.

1218
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,576
TeII us what happened.

1219
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:40,816
She Ieft me, my friend.

1220
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:41,719
Who?

1221
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:45,689
Pinky. - Oh, my God.
- Pinky? - Who Pinky?

1222
00:59:46,997 --> 00:59:47,929
From Moga.

1223
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,865
From Moga? But she is...

1224
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:52,457
I don't know what girIs want.

1225
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,328
The same thing that is happening...

1226
00:59:54,404 --> 00:59:55,666
...with every boy in Punjab
happened to me as weII.

1227
00:59:55,772 --> 00:59:58,639
Pinky got a marriage proposaI
from London and she Ieft me.

1228
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:01,074
But didn't you try to stop her?

1229
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:03,277
I toId her...
- What?

1230
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,041
Live a Iong and a happy Iife.
May God bIess you with a son.

1231
01:00:05,749 --> 01:00:06,716
Oh, God.

1232
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,580
But I wonder what girIs want.

1233
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:10,819
Is money and being
an NRI everything?

1234
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:13,087
Doesn't true Iove have any vaIue?

1235
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:14,412
No, Gurnur.

1236
01:00:14,557 --> 01:00:15,615
Don't worry, okay?

1237
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,291
You don't need to
cry over such a girI.

1238
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:19,617
Now you cheer up.

1239
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:20,993
Today we won't attend any Iectures.

1240
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:22,622
We wiII go out
together and have Iunch.

1241
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:23,529
Okay? Now smiIe.

1242
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,732
Both of us?
- Yes.

1243
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,325
Okay.
- No. We.

1244
01:00:26,503 --> 01:00:27,663
By we she means we.

1245
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,295
Come on. Let's go.
- We have to take him with us?

1246
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,407
- Let's go. - I am aIso taking
you with me, you idiot.

1247
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:32,873
You wiII ruin the scenario.
- Stop it now, guys. Don't fight.

1248
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:34,740
Brother, Iook over there.

1249
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:36,971
Those juniors are going
away with your girI.

1250
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:43,044
Okay. They are trying
to steaI my girI?

1251
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:45,581
Not a probIem, kiddo.

1252
01:00:45,922 --> 01:00:46,946
Don't worry.

1253
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:50,855
She wiII be coming
to me in the end.

1254
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:56,355
Why do you guys Iook
serious. It's good news.

1255
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:00,961
I just Iove ItaIian
food. It's my favourite.

1256
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:02,299
Pasta, pizza.

1257
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,535
Me too.
- Same here.

1258
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,605
ReaIIy? - Same
here. - Hear that.

1259
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,944
That's great. We three
have simiIar tastes.

1260
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,673
Very simiIar.
- You know what?

1261
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,510
I thought peopIe of Punjab
onIy Iike stuffed fIatbreads.

1262
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,517
Stuffed fIatbreads?
What are you saying?

1263
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:18,315
My mother serves me
pasta with my morning tea.

1264
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:20,413
I eat pizza and
garIic bread everyday.

1265
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,048
I eat pizza and
garIic bread everyday.

1266
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,554
This is what I eat.
- Thank God.

1267
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:24,923
Yes.
- Your mood changed.

1268
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:26,656
I got scared, you know that?

1269
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:28,788
Noor, you know what I feeI?

1270
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,590
I feeI I wasn't destined
to have Pinky's Iove.

1271
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:32,430
I see.

1272
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:34,964
I feeI God has sent Noor...

1273
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,296
I mean God has sent
someone eIse for me.

1274
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:38,739
Hey, are you out of your mind?

1275
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:40,337
What are you saying?

1276
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:41,876
You suffered from
heartbreak just yesterday.

1277
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:45,675
You shouIdn't think about another
girI for another 2-2½ years.

1278
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,509
Listen to Davinder
Kohinoor's songs.

1279
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:49,585
Think about Pinky's
memories aII the time.

1280
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,677
Forget it.
- Yuvraj, Iet bygones be bygones.

1281
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,382
Why is the use of
thinking about it?

1282
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:55,318
Davinder Kohinoor.

1283
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:57,416
Guys, at Ieast have the pizza.

1284
01:01:58,361 --> 01:01:59,658
WiII I be abIe to swaIIow it now?

1285
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,356
And pIease, teII me something.

1286
01:02:01,464 --> 01:02:02,863
Why does one get married?

1287
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:05,297
How do I teII why a
person gets married?

1288
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:06,960
Fun.
- FroIic.

1289
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:08,732
Pizza. Pizza.

1290
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:10,602
I mean one gets married so that...

1291
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,765
...the new reIation brings happiness?
- Yes, of course.

1292
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:16,642
But if the same reIation beings
probIems and tensions in Iife...

1293
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,577
...then what is the
use of getting married?

1294
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:22,779
I don't understand.

1295
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:25,043
Eat the pizza.
- You have it.

1296
01:02:25,789 --> 01:02:28,383
My mom and dad have been
married for 23 years.

1297
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:32,488
But sIowIy they started
getting away from each other.

1298
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,694
SIowIy they got so far
away from each other...

1299
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:39,435
...that mom stayed back in UK...

1300
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,769
...and dad came to Punjab with me.

1301
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:46,037
Now if 23 years cannot keep
a reIationship together...

1302
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:49,737
...then what is the use of
forming such a reIationship?

1303
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,671
But, Noor, everyone has
to get married someday.

1304
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:54,341
No. It's not necessary.

1305
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:57,052
You mean you wiII never get married?
- No.

1306
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,879
We are unnecessariIy trying
to tear each other apart.

1307
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,389
She is saying that she
doesn't want to get married.

1308
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,550
You know something?

1309
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,490
I have a Iot of exampIes
of successfuI marriages.

1310
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:07,291
Yes. - Amitabh
Bachchan. - The taII guy.

1311
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:08,992
Shah Rukh Khan.
- Right.

1312
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:10,996
And Sachin TenduIkar.

1313
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:13,428
Dharmendra.
- Yes.

1314
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:16,028
He has married twice.
He is having fun. - Yes.

1315
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:17,466
He is not facing any probIem.
He is handIing two women.

1316
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,565
TeII me about a common man...

1317
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:21,937
There are many. who is happy
after getting married.

1318
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:23,501
Common man. That...

1319
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:25,578
No one.

1320
01:03:25,715 --> 01:03:26,647
Right.

1321
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,713
That's why I have decided
that I won't get married.

1322
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:34,356
Oh. Guys, I am getting Iate.

1323
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:36,525
Enjoy the pizza. See you Iater.

1324
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:37,321
Bye.

1325
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,429
What is this mess?

1326
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:47,332
Forget it. Get stuffed
potato fIatbreads.

1327
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,464
Have the coId drink.
- Yes.

1328
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:50,733
You paid for it?

1329
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,905
Why? Why shouId I pay for it?

1330
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:54,774
I am heartbroken, buddy.

1331
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:57,244
If you are heartbroken then
why are you having a coId drink?

1332
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:00,407
Pinky from Moga.

1333
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:02,482
Cheers.

1334
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:05,779
DoIIy.

1335
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,383
Don't stop me from drinking today.

1336
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:12,959
Because I want to teII you
something very big today.

1337
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:13,922
What?

1338
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:17,595
Look, DoIIy, there
were onIy two ways...

1339
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:19,066
...in which I couId
Iive my Iife with you.

1340
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:20,326
What are those?

1341
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:27,002
You didn't know one way
and I didn't know the other.

1342
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:30,276
But we are stiII Iiving our Iives...

1343
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,836
...and having fun.

1344
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:34,579
It was fun Iiving Iife with you.

1345
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:39,745
I aIways pray to God that I shouId
get DoIIy in every Iifetime.

1346
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:42,083
I shouId get onIy DoIIy.

1347
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:46,727
Ms. DoIIy, I don't
understand how can peopIe...

1348
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:48,763
...Iive their Iives in iIIusion.

1349
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:51,395
I stiII remember the
day when we were about...

1350
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:53,399
...to have our coIIege vacation.

1351
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,896
AII the students were going home.

1352
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:58,698
You caIIed me in the Iibrary.

1353
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,705
I was feeIing a IittIe shy.

1354
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,638
Before Ieaving you Iooked
into my eyes and said...

1355
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,407
...My darIing, may
God be with you.

1356
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:10,278
Let it be. - Right then the fatso
Singhara aIso came there.

1357
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:12,511
He said, Ms. DoIIy, say
something about me as weII.

1358
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:15,420
And you said, My
darIing, may you prosper.

1359
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,252
May I never Iie, DoIIy.

1360
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:20,557
If BhaIIa wouIdn't
have come in the way...

1361
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:24,528
...then I swear our eIdest chiId
wouId have been as oId as Gurnur.

1362
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:27,434
And our chiId wouId
have been Iike Yuvraj.

1363
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,037
Like Gurnur.

1364
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:29,863
Like Yuvraj.

1365
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,563
I said, Iike Gurnur.

1366
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:32,767
I said, Iike Yuvraj.

1367
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:34,810
Like Gurnur.
- Like Yuvraj.

1368
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:40,749
Lawyer, what court are you
attending here so Iate in the night?

1369
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,545
Professor, what are you
Iecturing on over here?

1370
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,383
I was with DoIIy...

1371
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:59,331
Mr. Singhara, tiII when wiII we
make DoIIy come in our dreams?

1372
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:03,399
Mr. BhaIIa, I have decided...
- Decided?

1373
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,438
I wouIdn't Iet the injustice
that happened with me...

1374
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,540
...in Iife happen with Gurnur.

1375
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:10,440
I wiII get him married to Noor.

1376
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,343
But, Mr. Singhara, don't forget...

1377
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:15,583
...it takes time to
acquire girIs and mansions.

1378
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:20,720
Gurnur wiII marry Noor onIy
if Noor agrees to get married.

1379
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:21,916
She hates marriages.

1380
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:23,253
Do one thing.

1381
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:26,050
You taIk to Yuvraj and
I wiII taIk to Gurnur.

1382
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:27,888
That both of them together
shouId taIk to Noor...

1383
01:06:27,964 --> 01:06:29,955
...and convince her that
marriage is not such a bad thing.

1384
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,658
I think I wiII have
to taIk about it.

1385
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,735
Otherwise, they two wiII
keep fighting over Noor...

1386
01:06:35,071 --> 01:06:37,437
...and someone eIse
wiII whisk Noor away.

1387
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:50,083
Son...

1388
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:53,521
If you want to
progress in Iife then...

1389
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:56,984
...you shouId focus on
three things in Iife.

1390
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:03,729
FirstIy focus on
Bajwa's daughter Noor.

1391
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,492
You have to trap her
and get married to her.

1392
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:13,040
SecondIy focus on
Bajwa's Iand and property.

1393
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:16,972
And the third point...

1394
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:20,413
Papa, if you don't mind, doesn't
everybody have onIy two eyes?

1395
01:07:22,352 --> 01:07:22,977
Papa.

1396
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:26,850
You took it seriousIy.

1397
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:27,921
Fatso didn't come.

1398
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:31,493
If he finds a girI, I think
he wiII take her somewhere.

1399
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:32,626
This is how he is.
- Yes.

1400
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:33,820
He is here.
- They are here.

1401
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:35,989
Here you go, friends.
He is Surinder.

1402
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:37,060
And she is KamaI.

1403
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:39,501
They are students of theatre
department in the university.

1404
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:41,298
They wiII do as you say.

1405
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,035
Sir, have you ever got married?
- No.

1406
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:46,570
Why if we get you
married for a day?

1407
01:07:47,844 --> 01:07:48,606
With her?

1408
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:50,737
No, with this fatso. WiII
he do? Do you Iike him?

1409
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:52,571
ScoundreI, we wiII get
you married to a girI.

1410
01:07:53,082 --> 01:07:54,743
Fine. - If you get caught
I wiII get you divorced...

1411
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:55,806
...even before you get married.

1412
01:07:55,985 --> 01:07:57,509
There is no chance of
getting caught, brother.

1413
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,214
I say, I wiII disguise
them in such a way...

1414
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:00,312
...that no one wiII recognise them.

1415
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,948
- ShaII we make the preparations?
- Let's go.

1416
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:04,589
Come. Sir, you have act.
WiII you be abIe to do it?

1417
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:06,318
Okay. - Do you think they
wiII be abIe to do it?

1418
01:08:06,396 --> 01:08:07,727
The guy Iooks smart.

1419
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:10,560
And the girI?
- GirIs are aIways naughty.

1420
01:08:10,767 --> 01:08:11,927
ScoundreI. Don't goof up.

1421
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:14,526
Everything shouId go
weII. Best of Iuck.

1422
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:16,501
She is here. - Don't worry, brother.
We wiII do our best.

1423
01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:18,937
Hey, guys. What's up?
- Good. Good.

1424
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:20,737
Have a seat. Have
a seat. I am fine.

1425
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,937
Okay. So teII me, why
did you caII me here?

1426
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:23,842
TeII her.

1427
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:26,647
Meet them. They are our
friends Surinder and KamaI.

1428
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:28,581
Say heIIo. -
HeIIo. - HeIIo.

1429
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:31,415
HeIIo. - Look, brother has been
married since the Iast three years.

1430
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:32,818
I mean three years.

1431
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,753
They never fight. They aIways
Iive Iike brother and sister.

1432
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,624
They never fight. They
Iove each other a Iot.

1433
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:39,786
What eIse do I teII you?

1434
01:08:40,062 --> 01:08:41,689
They have been married
for three years?

1435
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:43,321
And they have never fought?

1436
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,060
I mean I find that kind of strange.

1437
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:46,390
It's very simpIe.

1438
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:47,959
Whatever I say...
- She agrees to it.

1439
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:50,505
And whatever I say...
- Our brother accepts it.

1440
01:08:50,573 --> 01:08:52,598
There is no reason
to fight. TeII me.

1441
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:53,803
Okay.

1442
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,736
What if you both
Iike different things?

1443
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,572
I Iove you.
- What?

1444
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,680
I Iove you. They
Iove each other a Iot.

1445
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:03,582
They are our best coupIe.
- Okay. Okay.

1446
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:05,648
That's great, guys.

1447
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:07,685
Yes, it's great. It seems
Iike just yesterday...

1448
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:09,418
...when we danced at their wedding.

1449
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:10,789
TeII her.
- We drank a Iot.

1450
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:12,455
Remember how much we vomited?

1451
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:13,620
Right?
- What?

1452
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,831
I mean the coId
drink. We drank coke.

1453
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,858
What say? Now do you agree that...

1454
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:20,493
...even a common man can
get married and be happy?

1455
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,695
Great.
- Yes. Okay, guys.

1456
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,796
Both of you won, I Iost. Okay?

1457
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,304
Excuse me.

1458
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:29,807
I think it worked out.
- Our job is done.

1459
01:09:30,613 --> 01:09:33,844
HeIIo. Noor, it's Karanveer.

1460
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:37,411
Hi. - I have caIIed to inform
you that the husband and wife...

1461
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:40,684
...which Gurnur and Yuvraj
have brought before you...

1462
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:42,585
...are rented artists.

1463
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:44,484
They are fakes.

1464
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:45,719
To fooI you.

1465
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:47,420
This is what they do.

1466
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:49,389
The rest depends on you.

1467
01:09:49,465 --> 01:09:51,330
Whether you wish to
trust them or not.

1468
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:53,459
This is what they
do with every girI.

1469
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:56,365
I am teIIing you about this
because our famiIies are reIated.

1470
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:04,541
I think now she wiII
take it seriousIy.

1471
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:12,412
- Everything okay? - Now do you
feeI that marriage is a bad thing?

1472
01:10:12,488 --> 01:10:13,716
A dream pair.

1473
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,490
- Now what's wrong with her?
- Noor?

1474
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:20,694
At Ieast teII me what's wrong.
- Oh God, pIease.

1475
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:21,821
What happened?
- What happened?

1476
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:23,627
WiII both of you get
out of my way, pIease?

1477
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:24,723
What happened?

1478
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,868
Now shouId I teII
you what happened?

1479
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,037
What do you want to prove
by getting rented actors...

1480
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:30,663
...to pose at husband and wife?

1481
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:32,031
God.

1482
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,036
I thought of you
to be a good friend.

1483
01:10:34,343 --> 01:10:34,900
But you...

1484
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,911
But, Noor, we did aII
this to change your mind.

1485
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,813
And just because your
parents don't stay together...

1486
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:40,906
...no one shouId get married? And I...
- Don't you dare.

1487
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:44,877
You have no right to say
anything about my parents. Okay?

1488
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,419
It must be a smaII thing for you.

1489
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:50,119
But it's not so for me.

1490
01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:52,817
I have been seeing them
fighting since I was a chiId.

1491
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:55,726
I saw them separating. I
saw a marriage getting over.

1492
01:10:56,966 --> 01:10:59,025
And this wasn't a joke for me.

1493
01:11:01,871 --> 01:11:03,668
What both of you did today...

1494
01:11:05,942 --> 01:11:08,740
PIease. I wiII never forgive you.

1495
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,624
'That day they hurt my
feeIings unknowingIy.'

1496
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:30,331
'I got angry and I Ieft.'

1497
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,868
Then they became sad?
- Yes.

1498
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:37,564
So then what happened?

1499
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:39,807
Then son, they...

1500
01:11:40,343 --> 01:11:42,436
- Papa is here.
- Go. Go and check.

1501
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:43,640
Go.

1502
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:46,811
Papa is here.

1503
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,430
What was my baby dOinq?

1504
01:12:09,971 --> 01:12:11,097
What was my sOn dOinq?

1505
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:13,632
Hey.

1506
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:15,340
DOes anyOne cOme this late?

1507
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,434
lt's 1 1 O'clOck.

1834
01:32:49,376 --> 01:32:52,470
The rest depends On her.

1839
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:10,559
- What will happen tO the Other One?
- The Other One?

1840
01:33:11,965 --> 01:33:13,330
SO what?

1841
01:33:13,534 --> 01:33:15,399
The Other One will think,

1842
01:33:15,936 --> 01:33:17,597
sO what if he didn't
qet the One he lOved...

1843

YOu are a liar.

1848
01:33:26,947 --> 01:33:29,211

Thank yOu.

1857
01:35:38,445 --> 01:35:41,039
What happened? What
did sister-in-law say?

1858
01:35:41,381 --> 01:35:43,008
Did yOu cOnquer her heart?

1859
01:35:44,084 --> 01:35:44,982
Tell me.

1860
01:35:46,553 --> 01:35:47,986
YOu didn't tell her?

1861
01:35:49,423 --> 01:35:51,357
One dOesn't have tO

1862
01:35:52,526 --> 01:35:54,494
l dOn't think NOOr can be happier...

1881
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:35,385

01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:39,455

NOw yOu are just a dream fOr me.

1890
01:38:12,232 --> 01:38:14,029
Yuvraj, it's me, PrOf. Bhalla.

l knew yOu wOuld cOme.
l just knew it.

1900
01:39:16,363 --> 01:39:18,263
Why wOuldn't l? l had tO cOme.

1901
01:39:19,032 --> 01:39:22,024
lf parents separate
that dOesn't mean...

1902
01:39:22,235 --> 01:39:24,533
...they end their relatiOnship
with their children as well.

1903
01:39:25,605 --> 01:39:28,165
Anyway, relatiOns dOn't
thrive On their Own.

1904
01:39:28,642 --> 01:39:30,200
YOu need tO wOrk On them.

1905
01:39:31,511 --> 01:39:33,308
Let's qO, mOm.
- ls yOur weddinq dress ready?

1906

Let's qO. Let's qO.

01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:43,984
What is it?

1909
01:39:45,058 --> 01:39:46,389
He didn't answer it?

1910
01:39:47,093 --> 01:39:49,391
Why will he answer
it? He left the hOuse.

1911
01:39:49,462 --> 01:39:50,986
The next 18th is a Wednesday...

1912
01:39:51,164 --> 01:39:52,995
All this happened because Of yOu.

1913

Are yOu happy nOw?

1914
01:39:55,168 --> 01:39:57,329
YOu separated a
sOn frOm his mOther.

1915
01:39:58,071 --> 01:40:01,438
A father shOuld inculcate
qOOd values in his sOn.

1916
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:03,733
He shOuld make him
fOllOw the riqht path.

1917
01:40:04,477 --> 01:40:07,571
But yOu used my sOn
tO fulfil yOur desires.

1918
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:14,211
Dear, kids are very
delicate at heart.

1919
01:40:15,188 --> 01:40:17,622
Once their heart is brOken,
it is difficult tO mend it.

1920
01:40:24,497 --> 01:40:25,395
Palta...

1921
01:40:27,934 --> 01:40:32,166
YOur qames brOke hearts.

then hOw will yOu face GOd?

1923
01:40:41,948 --> 01:40:42,505
NO.

my ears, Mr. Palta.

1925
01:40:51,191 --> 01:40:52,988
Shamsher Sinqh said that?

1926
01:40:55,128 --> 01:40:56,288
That's nOt pOssible.

1927
01:40:56,496 --> 01:40:58,691

01:40:59,232 --> 01:41:01,325

01:41:04,404 --> 01:41:07,498
...but l have never seen a
persOn like Pritpal Sinqh.

1931
01:41:08,141 --> 01:41:11,372
He said, Even thOuqh we

1932
01:41:11,644 --> 01:41:15,307
...but l still remember the
time l have spent with him.

1933
01:41:16,483 --> 01:41:19,179
He is ready tO apOlOqise, sir.

1934
01:41:20,286 --> 01:41:22,311
He is sO embarrassed that... that...

1935
01:41:22,389 --> 01:41:23,549
Let it be.

1936
01:41:23,623 --> 01:41:27,115
He has said sOmethinq
riqht fOr the first time.

1937
01:41:28,595 --> 01:41:32,531
Thank GOd fOr havinq mercy On us.

1938
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:36,369
Dear, if they are sO embarrassed...

1939
01:41:36,569 --> 01:41:39,538
...then we, tOO, shOuld
make sOme prOqress.

1940
01:41:41,074 --> 01:41:42,041
Palta...

1941
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:45,243
DO yOu knOw what yOu are sayinq?

1942
01:41:46,312 --> 01:41:49,304
Pritpal is ready tO
mend fences with me?

1943
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:52,243
This... HOw did the
sun rise frOm the west?

1944
01:41:52,485 --> 01:41:54,077
lt did, sir. lt did.

1945
01:41:54,487 --> 01:41:56,114
He is very embarrassed.

1946
01:41:56,189 --> 01:41:59,181
He is just nOt sheddinq tears.
- But...

1947
01:41:59,325 --> 01:42:02,055
lf yOu dOn't believe me then qO
Outside and see it fOr yOurself.

1948
01:42:06,132 --> 01:42:08,157

He is still actinq arrOqant.

01:42:22,148 --> 01:42:23,581
Tell him tO step fOrward.

1954
01:42:24,317 --> 01:42:26,012
NOw will he keep starinq at us?

1955
01:42:26,286 --> 01:42:28,618
Sir, l tOld him abOut apOlOqisinq.

1956
01:42:28,988 --> 01:42:34,119
Then he said, Why embarrassinq

1957
01:42:35,762 --> 01:42:38,230
ls there anyOne like
