lt's the story of Dashrath's son.

15
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:30,945
He was the man of
the greatest merit.

16
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,684
Lord Ram was the man
of the greatest order.

17
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,654
Son of Air God, Hanuman,
was Lord Ram's devotee.

18
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,660
Lakshaman was the loyal brother.

19
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:48,526
Together they attacked Lanka.

20
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:53,963
Then Lord Ram got his wife,
Mother Sita back.

21
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:57,506
Lord Ram was the man
of the greatest order.

22
00:04:57,608 --> 00:05:00,441
Son of Air God Hanuman
was Lord Ram's devotee.

23
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,240
Lakshaman was the loyal brother.

24
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,248
Together they attacked Lanka.

25
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:12,551
So hail Lord Ram..
- Hail the Lord.

26
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:16,285
Lord Ram went to
Lanka and defeated Ravan.

27
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,989
He is going back to
Ayodhya as a hero.

28
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,756
With a smile on his face
and bow on his shoulder.

29
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:27,564
People were hailing Ram
after Ravan was killed in Lanka.

30
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,265
Following Ram was his
loyal brother Lakshman.

31
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,934
They were talking about Ram
and Sita in every village.

32
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,915
People came in hordes
to see Ram with his army.

33
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,283
People were
screaming and celebrating..

34
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,518
..when they got a glimpse
of Lord Ram and Mother Sita.

35
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,594
They were hailing them.

Gautam, Dhiresh and Dinu..
- Get them back.

43
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:01,419
No one is ready to
take the responsibili<b>ty</b>..

44
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:04,426
..of the missing students.
As you can see..

45
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:07,429
..all the students of the
M<b>K</b> Gandhi Medical College..

46
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:08,555
..are on hunger strike.

47
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:10,428
Their demand from
the government is to..

48
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,435
..find the students who went
missing from <b>J</b>an<b>j</b>har district..

49
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:16,438
..and carry out an
investigation on it ..

50
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,440
.. and send the C<b>B</b>l for the same.

51
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,976
Down with..
- Delhi police.

52
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,773
The lndian
government is in deep slumber.

53
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,438
We won't put up with
this ine<b>ff</b>iciency.

54
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:25,776
The lndian
government is in deep slumber.

55
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,441
We won't put up with

60
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,792
..of the missing students.

61
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,124
Students demand..

62
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,464
We have with us the friend

63
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:48,470
..and the student president
of this place. Ramesh <b>J</b>ain.

64
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:51,468
Mr. Ramesh, can you tell us
when you last spoke to those..

65
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,203
..students<b>?</b> - <b>O</b>n <b>26</b>th <b>O</b>ctober,
the day they went missing.

66
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:56,469
What did you talk to them about<b>?</b>
- They were <b>j</b>ust saying..

67
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,480
..that the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har
police had arrested them..

68
00:08:58,548 --> 00:08:59,845
..and then call got disconnected.

69
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:03,482
So do you know why
they went to <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har<b>?</b>

70
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,482
Dhiresh and Gautam
went to Dinu's village..

71
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:06,749
..to celebrate
'Dussehra' <b>(</b>Hindu festival<b>)</b>.

72
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,853
They were supposed to
come back the ne<b>x</b>t day.

73
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,483
lt's been <b>tw</b>o months since then.

74
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,585
<b>B</b>ut till now we've got to
know nothing about them.

75
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,488
And the police and the
government's response..

76
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,499
..to the whole a<b>ff</b>air is
e<b>x</b>tremely irresponsible..

77
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,625
Down with.. - C<b>B</b>l.

78
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:19,760
'The irresponsible response
of the government..'

79
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:21,497
'..seem to be the
best words to describe..

80
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,833
.. the reason behind
the students' fury.'

81
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:24,506
'From M<b>K</b> Gandhi Medical college..'

82
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:28,169
'..it's me Shalini Dey, with
cameraman Ashutosh Mishr, delhi.'

83
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,507
Sir, we would like to
ask you a <b>q</b>uestion..

84
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:30,773
<b>B</b>ecause of it M<b>K</b>
Gandhi Medical College..

85
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,075
..you will have to answer.

86
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,047
Sir, we would like to know
what the government is doing.

87
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:37,086
Sir, it's been <b>tw</b>o months
since the students went missing.

88
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,949
Why is the government
not taking a serious step<b>?</b>

89
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:42,717
That's not true. The
government is trying its level best.

90
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,190
Sir, what will be
government's ne<b>x</b>t step<b>?</b>

91
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,523
For that we have chosen a C<b>B</b>l team..

92
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,155
..which has already
left for <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.

93
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,893
Sir, sir, please tell.. - What is..
- No more <b>q</b>uestions please.

94
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,275
Hail lndia, sir.
- Hail lndia.

95
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,581
Please give it to me, sir.
Please come, sir.

96
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,631
Ma<b>j</b>or Pratap <b>K</b>umar,
o<b>ff</b>icer under.. ministry.

97
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:57,029
Siddhant Chaturvedi, C<b>B</b>l.

98
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,158
Come, we shall talk on the way.

99
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,238
Did you read this<b>?</b>

100
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,609
At such a beautiful
and serene place..

101
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:18,654
..murders, kidnappings and rapes..

102
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:20,850
Crimes like
booth-capturing are taking place.

103
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,652
And that, too, thrice the
number in Delhi and Mumbai.

104
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,820
Not thrice, but
five times the number.

105
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:27,927
The complaints of most of
the crimes are not registered.

106
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:30,632
lf that happens, the army
will have to leave the border..

107
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,635
..and come and put up a
tent here in this village.

108
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,635
So what you mean to say is
that whatever is written..

109
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,040
..in these documents is wrong<b>?</b>

110
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:43,645
These documents are the
proof of the ine<b>ff</b>iciency..

111
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:46,079
..of the government
o<b>ff</b>icials sitting in AC rooms.

112
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:49,685
People living in the ci<b>ty</b>
are far away from the truth.

113
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,713
Now that you are here, you
will understand eve<b>ryt</b>hing slowly.

114
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:01,286
<b>B</b>y the way, what's your age<b>?</b>

115
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,661
l am old enough to be in-charge
of <b>tw</b>o high-profile en<b>q</b>uiries..

116
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,862
..out of which si<b>x</b> saw convictions..

117
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:10,663
..and because of
that l am sent here..

118
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,335
..as the in-charge of
this en<b>q</b>uiry and your boss.

119
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,674
<b>Y</b>ou must've guessed my age.

120
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,909
ln the army, my
commander used to say..

121
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,776
..Son, confidence is
a double-edged sword.

122
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,721
lf you hit the target right,
you are on top.

123
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,116
lf not, may God help you.

124
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,422
That's a good one.

125
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,221
Sorry, sir. This is the
only lodge in <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.

126
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,454
A lot of woodwork goes

Where did you set up the o<b>ff</b>ice<b>?</b>

130
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:17,368
We got an old theatre, sir.

131
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:18,736
The negotiations are going on, sir.

132
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,934
We will strike a
deal in a day or <b>tw</b>o.

133
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,761
Have you gone mad or what..

134
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,095
lf he learns from there,
l will believe it.

135
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,132
Tell me what l should write.
- <b>Y</b>ou can ask him.

..from Delhi government.

144
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,398
He says that we may
kill him in an encounter.

145
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:19,229
Who cares about
the Delhi government<b>?</b>

146
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:21,098
That scoundrel. Again

00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:28,433
l told you that he is busy
with a <b>V</b>lP in the meeting.

167
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:34,536
Who's the <b>V</b>lP<b>?</b> - Do you know
all the <b>V</b>lPs of our region<b>?</b>

168
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,135
Go sit there and wait.

169
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:37,877
l will ring the bell and call you.

170
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,416
Forget this <b>V</b>lP.

l will wait for
another five minutes..

172
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:45,318
..and then break open the door.

173
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:54,325
<b>Y</b>ou don't worry. lt will be done.
Don't worry at all. - <b>O</b>kay. Goodbye.

174
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:55,455
Alright. Goodbye.

175
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:01,064
Sir. - <b>Y</b>es<b>?</b> - These guys came for
you. - Siddhant Chaturvedi, C<b>B</b>l.

176
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,131
<b>Y</b>es. l got a call from
Delhi that someone's coming.

177
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:09,578
Did you have tea and snacks<b>?</b> Hey,
Saithu. - l'll get it.

178
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:10,908
No, no, thank you.

179
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:14,575
We need some information
about those three boys.

180
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:17,984
<b>Y</b>es, why have these Delhi o<b>ff</b>icials
created such havoc unnecessarily<b>?</b>

181
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:21,349
Which three boys<b>?</b> We
have no idea at all.

182
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,925
<b>B</b>ut they call us
everyday and trouble us.

183
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,929
Mr. Chaturvedi, do you
have any knowledge..

184
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,931
..about the three of them<b>?</b>
- As per the mobile records..

185
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,660
..those boys made the
last call from <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har.

186
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,933
What are you saying<b>?</b>
- As soon as they said..

187
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,938
..that the <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har
police has arrested them..

188
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,100
..their phone got disconnected.
- Arrested<b>? B</b>y us<b>?</b>

189
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,944
Does anyone know if there is
some other police station..

190
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:47,471
..in this area other than ours<b>?</b>
- How's that possible, sir<b>?</b>

191
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:50,609
There isn't, right<b>?</b>
Total cross-connection.

192
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,952
Look, don't waste your time here.

193
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,956
This story seems like a
figment of someone's imagination.

194
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:59,961
Those boys must've
gone somewhere else.

195
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,959
And an<b>yw</b>ay, the kids
of this generation..

196
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,965
..are <b>q</b>uite hot-blooded.
They must've gone to Mumbai..

197
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,593
..or somewhere
else to have some fun.

198
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,331
And they sent you here
from Delhi unnecessarily.

199
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:17,511
That's the situation. Tell us if
we can do an<b>yt</b>hing else for you.

200
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:20,342
An<b>yt</b>hing else<b>?</b> - We will call
you if there's an<b>yt</b>hing else.

201
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:22,116
<b>O</b>kay, okay.
- Let's go.

202
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:45,002
<b>B</b>rother, the water is di<b>rty</b>.
lt's not good.

203
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:46,132
<b>Y</b>ou'll get pure water in that well.

204
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:49,541
We don't need water, <b>B</b>rother. <b>J</b>ust
tell us where we'll get Rukumlal.

205
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:58,050
Who are you<b>?</b> - We've come
from Delhi. We are policemen.

206
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:09,558
Where are you going, <b>B</b>rother<b>?</b>

207
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:12,294
<b>J</b>uni. <b>J</b>uni.

We've come to help you.
Please listen to us.

209
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,073
Where will l find Rukumlal<b>?</b>

210
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:59,181
Father is not here. <b>Y</b>ou
will find him at work.

211
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,722
Hey, <b>J</b>uni. Why are you
talking to him<b>?</b> Come here.

212
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,526
The people here are
<b>q</b>uite afraid of the police.

213
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,628
<b>B</b>y the way, who is this Rukumlal<b>?</b>
- Dinu's brother-in-law.

214
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:16,355
He must know something about him.

215
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,835
Who is Rukumlal here<b>?</b>
- The one in the vehicle.

216
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,606
Hey.

217
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,553
Are you Dinu's brother-in-law<b>?</b>
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.

218
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:43,553
Two months ago Dinu came to the
village with his <b>tw</b>o bu<b>ff</b>alos.

219
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,218
Did he meet you<b>?</b>

220
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,760
No, sir. He didn't meet me.

221
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:58,137
He came to the
village and didn't meet..

222
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,265
..his only sister
and brother-in-law<b>?</b>

223
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:03,536
<b>Y</b>ou are hiding something.

224
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:06,407
Why did Dinu come here<b>?</b>

225
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:09,345
l don't know, sir.

226
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,745
Please forgive me.
- Don't be scared, Rukumlal.

227
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,586
Tell me the truth. He
must've met someone in the village.

228
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,828
Did he have any enmi<b>ty</b> with anyone<b>?</b>

229
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:26,161
l told you once, l don't know
an<b>yt</b>hing. Please forgive me.

230
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,760
Let me go. - <b>Y</b>ou are

231
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,601
Come on, get back to work. Come on.

232
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:54,186
Grandpa, how much is <b>8</b>
multiplied by <b>7? 54</b> or <b>56?</b>

233
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:58,830
Son, l am an illiterate man.

234
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:03,929
<b>O</b>nly Dinu could've
answered your bookish <b>q</b>uestions.

235
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:08,402
l don't know where he..
- <b>J</b>uni, don't trouble grandpa.

236
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:10,203
<b>K</b>eep that book there
and have your meal.

237
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,887
Look who's there at the door.
- Coming. Coming.

238
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:22,517
Wait a minute.

239
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:26,587
There's that idiot..

240
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,598
Get him. Get him.

241
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:38,330
Get him<b>!</b>

242
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,333
Where will you run<b>?</b>

243
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:42,239
Get him.

244
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:13,438
The o<b>ff</b>icials are here. Come inside.

245
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,334
Hey, <b>J</b>uni, where is your father<b>?</b>

246
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,028
Tell me.

247
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:46,700
Last night some
guys took father away.

248
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:52,607
<b>J</b>uni, come inside.
- Listen. Listen to me.

249
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,406
Can you tell me who
took Rukumlal away<b>?</b>

250
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,314
Don't ask me any <b>q</b>uestions, sir.

251
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,387
l want my husband alive.

252
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:01,849
<b>Y</b>es, so did you file a
complaint in the police station<b>?</b>

253
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,862
Why don't you understand
that we want to help you<b>?</b>

254
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:11,324
<b>O</b>h, God. What is
wrong with everybody<b>?</b>

255
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,593
Why doesn't anyone
say an<b>yt</b>hing here<b>?</b>

256
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,329
ln the last si<b>x</b> months,
eleven people..

257
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,839
..were kidnapped in broad daylight.

258
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,343
Their dead bodies were
recovered from railway tracks..

259
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,344
..wells and near the highway.

260
00:23:23,713 --> 00:23:26,375
And still you don't file a
complaint in the police station.

261
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:27,881
lf investigated,
the cause of death..

262
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,350
..is registered as
suicide or accidents. Why<b>?</b>

263
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,712
<b>B</b>ecause neither is there any
complaint, nor any witness.

264
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,716
ls everyone blind in
this neighborhood<b>?</b>

265
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:39,454
We are alive.. because we are blind.

266
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:41,356
<b>O</b>nly those have been
kidnapped from here..

267
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,523
..who wanted to become a witness.

268
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:47,366
<b>U</b>ncle, we are from C<b>B</b>l, from Delhi.

269
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,371
At least one of you say something.
We'll protect you.

270
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:55,005
Sir, we would be thankful to you
if you leave us in our condition.

271
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:56,669
Goodbye.

272
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:03,007
What's going on, SP sir<b>?</b>

273
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:04,978
Last night there was an
attack on Dinu's home.

274
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:06,919
His brother-in-law
Rukumlal has been kidnapped.

275
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:11,389
Really<b>?</b> - <b>Y</b>es. Have
you taken any action yet<b>?</b>

276
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:15,125
Rela<b>x</b>, Rela<b>x</b>.

277
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:17,121
Why are you getting so furious<b>?</b>

278
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:20,399
The police depa<b>rt</b>ment of
our country takes an action..

279
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,699
..when someone files a complaint.

280
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:26,999
What else do you want now<b>?</b>

281
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,404
That l should go to
everyone's home every day and ask..

282
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:33,414
..Sister, do you have any
complaint to file<b>?</b> No<b>?</b> Fine.

283
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,676
And while we are at it, shall we
also send some groceries for you<b>?</b>

284
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,410
And you say..
- lf that's your problem..

285
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:42,150
..then l will file the complaint.
l am warning you, SP sir.

<b>B</b>anke, file the complaint.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.

291
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,747
Hey, Sarko.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.

292
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:10,478
Go and bring a cold drink for sir.

293
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,884
These ci<b>ty</b> people get
heated up very soon. Right<b>?</b>

294
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:25,465
What are you doing<b>? Y</b>ou're on
the computer since a long time.

295
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:30,130
Mother has sent the photos
of some girls.. for a match.

296
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:31,531
<b>J</b>ust checking them.

297
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:35,210
Did you like anyone<b>?</b>
- l left that decision to mother.

298
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:36,975
She should like her.

299
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,777
She will get me
married as soon as l go back.

300
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,546
Forge tall this.
Tell me what you think.

301
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:45,850
Why are the
villagers so afraid to talk<b>?</b>

302
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:50,217
lt's an old fear. Now
it's a pa<b>rt</b> of their lives.

303
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:54,219
What do you mean<b>?</b> - l will
tell you an interesting story.

304
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:58,093
There's a small village
at about <b>80</b> kms from here.

305
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,559
Shabrampur.

306
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,136
A poor 'Dalit' <b>(</b>Low social
class<b>)</b> family used to live there.

307
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:05,941
<b>Y</b>ou know, 'Mother, father,
<b>tw</b>o daughters, one son' <b>ty</b>pes.

308
00:26:06,842 --> 00:26:08,810
They bought a farm with
their lifelong earnings.

309
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,646
Got a good harvest from the farm.
Got some money from the harvest.

310
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,237
With that money,
they bought <b>tw</b>o cows.

311
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:14,574
Ganga and <b>J</b>amuna.

312
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,512
<b>O</b>ne day when the 'Thakur'
<b>(V</b>illage head<b>)</b> of the village..

313
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:17,643
..was passing by, he
commented in friendly banter..

314
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,779
..Hey, 'Dalit', you
have prospered a lot.

315
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,249
Do you want to become a
landlord like me or what<b>?</b>

316
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,693
And that 'Dalit'
also replied <b>j</b>okingly..

317
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:27,518
..No matter how hard we try..

318
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,962
..we can never become
'Thakurs' from Dalits.

319
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,532
<b>B</b>ut, yes, if God wishes, my
children would study well..

320
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:37,902
..and lead even better
lives than the Thakurs.

321
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,972
The Thakur thought of it not as
a <b>j</b>oke, but a slap in the face.

322
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:46,547
That night when
the family returned..

..from the '<b>J</b>anmashtami'
<b>(</b>Lord <b>K</b>rishna's bi<b>rt</b>hday<b>)</b> fair..

and said..Don't worry.

328

<b>E</b>ve<b>ryt</b>hing will be fine.
And eve<b>ryt</b>hing did become fine.

329
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:10,636
The father had mi<b>x</b>ed poison
in the sweets. <b>E</b>veryone died.

This fear is deep-rooted in them.

Shocking.

335
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:31,316
<b>B</b>y the way, what does
that boy do nowadays<b>?</b>

336

Right now he's ironing his shi<b>rt</b>.

337
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:40,592
l thought since poison
didn't work for me..

338
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:42,660
..so l would try some whiskey.

339
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:13,286

All my words went in vain.

My body would be afire and
e<b>x</b>tinguished every now and then.

359
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:43,280
The nights come
knocking at my door.

..the entire yield
here will get ruined, sir.

490
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:35,621
Sister Geeta, l had made a wish
for you at Shankar Teela yesterday.

491
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:40,422
Wear this holy thread.
<b>Y</b>ou'll surely be able to conceive.

492
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:44,323
What happened, <b>J</b>amunia<b>?</b>

493
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,529
Why are your eyes teary<b>?</b>

494
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:52,563
Why are you getting scared<b>?</b> Tell me.

495
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:57,002
Last.. Last night they
kidnapped my husband.

496
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:01,312
l guess sir knows who they are.

497
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,284
Please ask sir to save him.

498
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,278
Don't cry, <b>J</b>amunia.

499
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,914
<b>E</b>nough. Calm down. Don't cry.

500
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:17,957
Apply the mud pack on the
rest of the utensils and leave.

501
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,792
Go.

502
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:28,329
<b>Y</b>ou. <b>Y</b>es, you..

503
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:35,003
Stop the car, Siddhant.

504
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,544
<b>J</b>ust five minutes.

505
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:38,245
Where are you going<b>?</b>
- l'll be right back.

506
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:13,380
Hey, <b>B</b>aklu..

507
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:20,916
He's the one.

508
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,228
<b>Y</b>ou're here to get a haircut<b>?</b>

509
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,600
So much of dust flies
around in the village.

510
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,361
So l thought of
combing my hair a little.

511
00:40:33,004 --> 00:40:34,904
lt becomes very
di<b>ff</b>icult to keep yourself clean.

512
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,868
What's your name<b>?</b>
- What<b>?</b>

513
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,878
Sir wants to know
your name. Full name.

514
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,914
Siddhant Chaturvedi.

515
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:48,543
'He has been trying his best.'

516
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,882
Are you a <b>B</b>rahmin<b>?</b>

517
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:52,253
That's why you are so
conscious about cleanliness.

518
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,283
What di<b>ff</b>erence does it make with..

519
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,486
..regards to
cleanliness if l am a <b>B</b>rahmin<b>?</b>

520
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,929
<b>B</b>elieve it or not, Son. lt does.
And that, too, in the entire country.

521
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,094
People in the ci<b>ty</b>
wash their hands..

522
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:04,396
..if some guy from a
low caste touches them.

523
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:08,564
<b>B</b>ut l don't let the need
to wash hands arise here.

524
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,574
Fantastic. The white-skin is out.

525
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,303
What a diving catch.

526
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:13,571
Monkey s<b>ty</b>le.

527
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:15,906
Lousy guy. He's out.

528
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:18,943
Hey, call him up. Turn it around.

529
00:41:19,918 --> 00:41:22,478
<b>B</b>et Rs. <b>2</b> lakhs on lndia now.

530
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:25,355
Sir, the one who bowled is a Muslim.

531
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:27,288
And the one who took the
catch belongs to a low caste.

532
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:29,924
And the ones who are
hugging both of them..

533
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:33,931
..comprise of <b>B</b>rahmins,
Sikhs and <b>K</b>shatriyas, too.

534
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,057
'And the new man in is..'

535
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,930
l wish we could learn
something from cricket.

536
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,528
Many bigwigs have come to teach us.

537
00:41:39,938 --> 00:41:41,405
<b>B</b>ut l wonder where they disappear.

538
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,104
We get tired looking
for them ourselves.

539
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:46,940
That reminds me.

540
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,070
Wait up.

541
00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,481
<b>Y</b>ou came here to look
for some boys, didn't you<b>?</b>

542
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,474
How far has your
investigation reached<b>?</b>

543
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:55,018
How far do you e<b>x</b>pect<b>?</b>

544
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,953
The Shool Army
attacked him last night.

545
00:41:58,089 --> 00:41:59,954
<b>B</b>ut let him save his own life first.

546
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:01,424
Then he can save
someone else's life.

547
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,488
l understand. - 'That is
great going for the men in blue.'

548
00:42:07,098 --> 00:42:08,497
l'm the leader around here.

549
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,962
l understand eve<b>ryt</b>hing.

550
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:12,960
The thing is that when
the press and media..

551
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:14,437
..pressuri<b>z</b>e the government..

552
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:16,371
..the government..
Stop it, will you<b>?</b>

553
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:20,576
The government, too,
has to play out a drama.

554
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:22,974
lt has to form an in<b>q</b>uiry committee.

555
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:24,241
And who gets trapped<b>?</b>

556
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,213
<b>Y</b>ou C<b>B</b>l o<b>ff</b>icials..
and these policemen.

557
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,978
Who reads the repo<b>rt?</b>

558
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,181
There is a hue and cry
for a couple of days.

559
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:33,724
And then when lndian wins a match,
eve<b>ryt</b>hing's forgotten.

560
00:42:34,225 --> 00:42:36,455
<b>E</b>ve<b>ryt</b>hing's <b>j</b>ust get
erased from the people's mind.

561
00:42:36,528 --> 00:42:37,995
They don't remember an<b>yt</b>hing, sir.

562
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:40,988
That's why l suggest,
write whatever you feel like..

563
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,124
..in the repo<b>rt</b>
and go back to Delhi.

564
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,258
'Now it's Gautam Gambhir
who's coming out to..'

565
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:44,995
Why are you getting
your hair spoilt..

566
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,298
..in the dust and
mud of this village<b>?</b>

567
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:48,596
Here are some nice bananas.

568
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:51,471

Geeta.

571
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:11,018
<b>B</b>rother, the eggplants
l had bought from you..

572
00:43:11,096 --> 00:43:12,427
..last time were absolutely
rotten from the inside.

573
00:43:12,497 --> 00:43:13,691
Geeta, l want to talk to you.

574
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,757
l don't talk to strangers.

575
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:17,092
Don't do this the ne<b>x</b>t time.

576
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:23,036
Geeta.. Geeta, l'm
talking to you. Geeta.

577

<b>B</b>rother, how much
for these tomatoes<b>?</b>

578
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,302
Ma'am, why are you asking the price<b>?</b>

579
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:28,504
<b>Y</b>ou should've

..delivered the vegetables home.
- <b>E</b>veryone's watching.

581
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:32,675
Don't add to my woes.
Please leave me alone.

582
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:46,720
Help. Help. Help him. Come on.

583
00:44:06,217 --> 00:44:08,082
Hey. Move. <b>B</b>ack o<b>ff</b>.

He is alive. He is alive.

585
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:11,415
This is a dead body.
lt's a police matter.

586
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:12,747
Come on.

587
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,088
Take him to the
hospital before the media..

588
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,684
..shows up with their entourage.

589
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,559
God forbid, if he dies,
we'll have to face the media.

590
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:21,098
Come on. Hurry up.

591
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:31,106
Which hospital are
you taking him to<b>?</b>

592
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:33,469
Whatever happens in
our area is our headache.

593
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:35,642
<b>J</b>ust stick to the
task you're here for.

594
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:37,638
l had lodged the FlR about him.

595
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:38,773
So we've found him.

596
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,249
Now do you want to
suck the life out of us<b>?</b>

597
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,282
Come on. Go. Go.

598
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:45,586
Let's go, Siddhant. Let him go.

599
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:48,115
Rukumlal is the only
link to this case.

600
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:51,661
lt's pe<b>rt</b>inent that we find
about his kidnappers before he dies.

601
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:52,855
He is only half-dead now.

602
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:54,393
lf we chase, he'll die for sure.

603
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:56,126
<b>B</b>y now you must've
reali<b>z</b>ed that we can't..

604
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:57,532
..carry out the
investigation in public like this.

605
00:44:57,602 --> 00:44:58,660
What do you think<b>?</b>

606
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:00,135
Am l doing an
investigation for the first time<b>?</b>

607
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:03,138
Two high profile in<b>q</b>uiries.
Si<b>x</b> convictions.

608
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,266
l remember eve<b>ryt</b>hing.

609
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,274
<b>B</b>ut the law here is di<b>ff</b>erent
from that of the other countries.

610
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:08,510
Here every hea<b>rt</b> is under terror.

611
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:11,209
No one will open their
mouth even by mistake.

612
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:12,677
We'll have to return emp<b>ty</b>-handed.

613
00:45:13,151 --> 00:45:18,418
Hello. We'll not have
to go back emp<b>ty</b>-handed.

614
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,451
The car of those three
boys has been found.

615
00:45:37,175 --> 00:45:41,441
Do you believe in God<b>?</b>
- No.

616
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,808
God comes to our aide
in various disguises.

617
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:48,645
This time he came in the
disguise of the chief engineer.

618
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,183
The one who shut the
water of this dam.

619
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,182
The moment the water
level receded.. <b>V</b>iola.

620
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,192
lt e<b>x</b>posed the roof of the car.

621
00:45:58,663 --> 00:46:00,597
Then the name of this
God is co-incidence.

622
00:46:16,748 --> 00:46:17,806
Found an<b>yt</b>hing<b>?</b>

623
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,679
Sir, not much. Some
bottles of soft drinks.

624
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:21,309
An earring and a mobile phone.

625
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,819
l guess there was a girl
with those boys that night.

626
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,218
<b>B</b>ut, sir, we haven't got a
repo<b>rt</b> about any missing girl yet.

627
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:31,286
lnteresting.

628
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,229
An<b>yw</b>ays, get this car
thoroughly inspected..

629
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:36,233
..by the forensic depa<b>rt</b>ment.
- Sir.

630
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:37,493
Send this SlM card to Delhi.

631
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:39,297
Find out in whose name
was this registered.

632
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:41,665
And to what numbers were
calls last made from this number.

633
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:42,899
<b>O</b>kay.
- <b>O</b>kay. Got it<b>?</b> - <b>O</b>kay, sir.

634
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:47,242

<b>B</b>ack o<b>ff</b>.

636
00:46:53,451 --> 00:46:54,713
<b>O</b>ne thing's clear, Pratap.

637
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:56,419
This car did not fall.
lt was made to fall.

638
00:46:58,256 --> 00:46:59,314
This is not an accident.

639
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:01,848
There is not even a scratch on
the headlights and the grills.

640
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,986
And nor on the railing.

641
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:12,694
Pass me the lens.

642
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:26,283
Get a specimen of this. Please.

643
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:29,885
l think this car was dropped
into the water with a crane.

644
00:47:30,888 --> 00:47:32,287
This mark on such a high railing..

645
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:34,552
..could be only because
of the arms of the crane.

646
00:47:35,526 --> 00:47:38,962
Find out who has a red
colored crane in <b>J</b>han<b>j</b>har district.

647
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,429
<b>Y</b>es, sir.
- And, yes.

648
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:42,766
Send for a rescue
team of lady divers.

649
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,030
Comb the entire area.
- <b>Y</b>es, sir.

650
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,806
Hey. Found an<b>yt</b>hing<b>?</b>

651
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:26,000
<b>Y</b>es, sir.

652
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,335
Two loincloths. And a left sandal.

653
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:31,406
Move.

654
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,346
Hey. Listen. Hey.

655
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:43,984
Last year my sister-in-law
had drowned along with her mug.

656
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:45,789
Sister-in-law was an absolute witch.

657
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:47,592
Say goodbye to her from a distance.

658
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:51,833
Anyone who finds her mug,
return it without fail.

659
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:54,497
Do return it.

660
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:57,101
What's happening here<b>?</b>

661
00:48:57,608 --> 00:48:59,701
The C<b>B</b>l guys are selling fish.

662
00:48:59,777 --> 00:49:01,369
Fresh Rohu. Five for Rs. <b>10</b>.

663
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,438
Why are you laughing<b>?</b>

664
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:04,981
They are eventually doing their <b>j</b>ob.

665
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:06,441
Go get some.

666
00:49:07,785 --> 00:49:09,047

theatre <b>j</b>ust Rs. <b>10000</b> per month<b>?</b>

00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:19,655
Sir, we've found four
red cranes from this area.

671
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,994
All four are registered in
the name of Sughna Gilgit, Sir.

672
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,400
And the paint specimen we took
from the railing of the bridge..

673
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,404
..matches with one
of the cranes, sir.

674
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:29,138
And its repo<b>rt</b> is in this file.

675
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:33,633

That's because he

..in their private
pa<b>rt</b>s and kills them.

Come on, drink from your cup.

683
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,828
Go. Go to your house.

00:50:26,764 --> 00:50:27,890
The rest is for Nasbandi.

00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:31,526
Tell him that it's a treat
from brother Pratap. Go.

God. How did they come in<b>?</b>

710
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:06,334
He's dead.

711
00:55:06,744 --> 00:55:07,938
He drives like a blind man.

712
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:28,760
What is that <b>j</b>eep doing outside<b>?</b>

713
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:30,765
What <b>j</b>eep, <b>B</b>rother<b>?</b>

Mine's in the garage.

<b>Y</b>ou..
- Hey, you. Hey.

716
00:55:39,243 --> 00:55:40,767
Why are you creating a scene<b>?</b>

717
00:55:40,845 --> 00:55:42,210
<b>B</b>ook this scoundrel for murder.
- Move.

718
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:43,906
Do you even know what he did<b>?</b>

719
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:45,039

720
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:46,173
Listen. Come on.

721
00:55:47,084 --> 00:55:48,915
The brakes of his
car weren't working.

722
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:51,784
Some lunatic <b>j</b>umped before
his car. Got ran over and died.

723
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:55,025
What could he do if that
poor guy ran out of luck<b>?</b>

724
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:56,919
lf he had stayed there, the people..

725
00:55:56,994 --> 00:55:59,155
..would've beaten
him to death as well.

726
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:01,023
That's why he directly
came under my refuge.

727
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:02,530
<b>B</b>rother, button the topmost button.

728
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,794
He is lying.

<b>Y</b>es. <b>Y</b>ou are absolutely right.

730
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,933
At first, l also took him to be
a fraud and did not believe him.

731
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:13,237
That's why l sent the car
directly to the workshop.

732
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,368
Here's the repo<b>rt</b>.

733
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:16,811
The brakes of his car
were indeed not working.

734
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:17,973
Were completely failed.

735
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:20,414
Hey. Move.
- Hand him over to us.

736
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:22,145
How can we, <b>B</b>rother<b>?</b>

We want to investigate in our way.

738

Sir, we'll have to
complete ce<b>rt</b>ain formalities.

739
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,019
We'll take him to
the hospital first.

740
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:31,423
He'll be e<b>x</b>amined to
see if he's drunk.

741
00:56:31,962 --> 00:56:33,896
Then he'll be
presented in the cou<b>rt</b>.

742
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:38,365
And l can hand him over to
you only after all this.

743
00:56:39,236 --> 00:56:43,002
As you can see, l've
got my hands full.

744
00:56:43,073 --> 00:56:44,472
So please don't disturb me anymore.

745
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:48,978

At home.

When did your husband
come back home<b>?</b> - At <b>7:30</b>.

752
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:47,035
After that, did he go out somewhere<b>?</b>

753
00:57:51,075 --> 00:57:53,566
No. He was watching T<b>V</b> at home.

How can you say that l'm lying<b>?</b>

She bats her eyelids
when it comes to lies.

758
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:25,333
She can't lie
even if she wants to.

Today, Mr. Pratap <b>K</b>umar, a

..has not only made this district..

..but the entire
region proud in the entire..

797
01:01:05,169 --> 01:01:08,400

Now l would like

l want to say <b>j</b>ust one
thing to all you kids.

01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,854
Don't ever be ashamed of your caste.

802
01:01:31,328 --> 01:01:33,592
A person's caste
doesn't make him good or bad.

803
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:35,661
His deeds make him good or bad.

804
01:01:36,466 --> 01:01:40,129
Sir has taught me this.

805
01:01:41,471 --> 01:01:43,598
My parents passed
away in my childhood.

806
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:47,141
Since then, he has
raised and brought me up.

807

Whatever l am today
is all thanks to him.

808
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,619
Pratap, l want to ask
for something from you.

809
01:02:05,162 --> 01:02:06,390
l hope that you won't turn me down.

810
01:02:07,764 --> 01:02:11,461
Sir..
- Forget my daughter.

811
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:18,900
<b>Y</b>ou've endured a lot of

<b>Y</b>ou can figure out from your past..

01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:26,342
..how cruel the life
in this village is.

814
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:32,183
Here the entire family
has to pay the price..

815
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:33,314
..for the mistake made by one.

816
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:39,253
<b>27</b> years ago l had the
strength to fight the world.

817
01:02:40,197 --> 01:02:42,256
Perhaps that's why l
could bring you home.

818
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:46,860
<b>B</b>ut today, l'm very weak. l'm old.

819
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:49,203
l won't be able to fight today.

820
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,206
l have <b>tw</b>o other
daughters besides Geeta.

821
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:57,209
lf you got married to Geeta,..

822
01:02:57,281 --> 01:03:02,275
..the socie<b>ty</b> will make
their lives miserable.

823
01:03:04,254 --> 01:03:05,687
Let alone getting married.

824
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:08,887
lt will be di<b>ff</b>icult for them to
even venture out of the house.

825
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,656
Such girls either hang
themselves on a fan..

826
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:16,966
..or <b>j</b>ump into a well..

827
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:19,299
..or at brothels..

828
01:03:27,244 --> 01:03:31,908
Son, this hea<b>rt</b> has
always given you blessings.

829
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:39,923
Don't force it to
curse you. Forget Geeta.

830
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:44,785
l would think that l got my fees.

831
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:50,262
Pratap, why have you
come back to remind me..

832
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:51,426
..what l have forgotten years ago<b>?</b>

833
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:02,408
l <b>j</b>ust want the
answers to my <b>q</b>uestions.

834
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:06,749
<b>Y</b>our husband wasn't at home on
the night of the <b>26</b>th of <b>O</b>ctober.

835
01:04:07,284 --> 01:04:08,751
And you know where he was.

836
01:04:09,553 --> 01:04:11,282
l don't know an<b>yt</b>hing.

837
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:15,015
<b>Y</b>our eyelids are batting again.

838
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,294
Pratap, you've to listen to this.

839
01:04:27,704 --> 01:04:29,296
That SlM we found in
the car that day..

840
01:04:29,373 --> 01:04:30,533
..belongs to someone
named Roshini Sukul.

841
01:04:30,907 --> 01:04:33,307
Her father's name is
Thakur <b>O</b>mkar Sukul.

842
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:35,306
He is an e<b>x</b>-minister of this place.

843
01:04:35,645 --> 01:04:36,771
He is now a headman.

844
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:39,315
All the ministers
here are in his pocket.

845
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,312
<b>B</b>race yourself.

846
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:43,316
This investigation
is going to get ugly.

847
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:20,948
That's fine.

848
01:05:21,024 --> 01:05:22,514
lt's good that you came.

849
01:05:23,827 --> 01:05:25,351
Who is Thakur <b>O</b>mkar Sukul<b>?</b>

850
01:05:25,896 --> 01:05:26,954
The C<b>B</b>l o<b>ff</b>icials are here.

851
01:05:32,602 --> 01:05:34,433
l'm sorry. We came to
your house uninvited.

<b>Y</b>es.

853
01:05:36,706 --> 01:05:38,765
Call your daughter
Roshini out please.

854
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:40,373
She wanted to ask us something..

855
01:05:40,444 --> 01:05:41,911
..about the three missing boys.

856
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:45,046
<b>Y</b>ou knucklehead.

857
01:05:45,115 --> 01:05:46,446
Are you stupid<b>?</b>

858
01:05:46,983 --> 01:05:49,850
<b>Y</b>ou're asking where my

859

<b>Y</b>ou won't get to meet Roshini.

860
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:54,447
Do whatever you can.

861
01:05:57,394 --> 01:05:59,862
Thakur sir, don't take my
decency to be my weakness.

862
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:02,388
We've ce<b>rt</b>ain evidence

863
01:06:02,466 --> 01:06:04,764
..l can even arrest
Roshini if l want to.

864
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:06,996
Here's the warrant.

865
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:14,574
l clean my bottom in the
morning with papers like these.

866

<b>O</b>nly what l say

Take her away if you have the guts.

869
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:39,425
l shall change my name if
these guys don't rip you apa<b>rt</b>.

870
01:06:52,048 --> 01:06:53,106
Let's go.

01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:58,814
Take o<b>ff</b> as soon as you can.

872
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:00,983
They've found evidence.

873
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:05,053
lf l lost it, l'll shove the
evidence down your throat.

874
01:07:05,462 --> 01:07:06,588
<b>Y</b>ou'll be left wincing.

875
01:07:08,064 --> 01:07:11,522

01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:13,060
Get lost.

<b>Y</b>ou move, you die.

879
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:23,773
Ask your men to lower their guns.

880
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:24,905
Lower your guns.

881
01:07:29,986 --> 01:07:34,480
Now tell me who the
sycophant is. Who is it<b>?</b> Come on.

882
01:07:37,894 --> 01:07:39,862
l am.
- l did not hear you.

883
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,694
Say it loudly.
- Pratap, what madness is this<b>?</b>

884
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,224
Leave him.

885
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:46,496
l did not hear you. Say it loudly.

886
01:07:47,103 --> 01:07:48,764
l am..
- Pratap, it's an order.

887
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:54,901
Come on, let's go.

888
01:07:58,114 --> 01:07:59,172
Pick him up. Hurry up.

889
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,112
ls he okay<b>?</b>

890
01:08:05,655 --> 01:08:07,247
What is wrong with you<b>?</b>

891
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:10,658
We are sent here to find
the evidence and witnesses.

892
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:13,254
So that we can present a
strong case in the cou<b>rt</b>.

893
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,930
And that gun has been
given to us for our protection.

894
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:18,592
We have to give an account
for every bullet that we fire.

895
01:08:19,002 --> 01:08:21,197
There's a system to
the way we work. <b>O</b>h, God.

896
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:22,533
There are protocols to be followed.

897
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,905
Here the system is that if someone
abuses you, rip his tongue out.

898
01:08:27,544 --> 01:08:29,535
And if someone's
word is the final word..

899
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:32,081
..then you've to keep your gun
in his mouth <b>24</b> hours a day.

900
01:08:32,682 --> 01:08:34,775
<b>Y</b>ou don't play on fire.

901

<b>Y</b>ou play with fire.

902
01:08:37,687 --> 01:08:39,086
That's the way l work.

903
01:08:39,556 --> 01:08:41,023
Don't tell me your way of working.

904
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:42,752

Please co-operate or
else we will have to..

915
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:02,763
..take her along with force.

916
01:10:06,643 --> 01:10:07,701
Roshini.

917
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:13,707
Leave me.

918
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:25,389
<b>O</b>n the night of the <b>26</b>th <b>O</b>ctober,
you were with those boys.

919
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:30,324
Here's your mobile that was
obtained from their vehicle.

920
01:10:31,668 --> 01:10:32,794
According to the phone records..

921
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:35,667
..you made your last
<b>17</b> calls to those guys.

922
01:10:37,907 --> 01:10:39,670
Do you want to say
an<b>yt</b>hing in your defense<b>?</b>

923
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:42,269
Look, the story is very simple.

924
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:44,078
Dinu used to love you..

925
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:47,139
..and you used to pretend to
love him, <b>j</b>ust to have fun.

926
01:10:47,684 --> 01:10:50,676
<b>Y</b>our family fi<b>x</b>ed your
marriage with a rich man..

927
01:10:50,754 --> 01:10:52,745
..and you happily accepted it.

928
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:54,685
When Dinu learnt about it..

929
01:10:54,758 --> 01:10:57,784
..he came to your village
with his friends to meet you.

930
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:00,692
lf Dinu had revealed the
truth about you here..

931
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:04,291
..then your family's reputation
would've been completely ruined.

932
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:07,701
And to save yourself
from this disgrace..

933
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:09,705
..you, along with
your family, killed..

934
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:10,967
..Dinu, Dhiresh and Gautam.

935
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:12,703
That's not true.

936
01:11:13,176 --> 01:11:14,700
l didn't kill anyone.

937
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:19,039
<b>Y</b>ou see this earring<b>?</b>

938
01:11:20,316 --> 01:11:21,715
l have many such proofs..

939
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:24,253
..to take you and your
family to the gallows.

940
01:11:25,388 --> 01:11:27,879
The truth is that
you got Dinu killed.

941
01:11:28,057 --> 01:11:29,888
How can l kill Dinu<b>?</b>

942
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:32,354
l used to love him.

943
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:39,929
Dinu was the
brightest boy in the school.

944
01:11:41,738 --> 01:11:45,071
That's why he even got a seat
in a medical college in Delhi.

945
01:11:46,976 --> 01:11:48,739
l thought..

946
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:54,478
..once he becomes a doctor,
my family will accept him.

947
01:11:56,986 --> 01:11:59,477
<b>B</b>ut they were all
against this relationship.

948
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:04,291
That's why they fi<b>x</b>ed my
marriage with <b>V</b>i<b>j</b>ay Singh.

949
01:12:06,296 --> 01:12:09,754
When l told Dinu about this,
he came to our village..

950
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:13,360
..along with some of
his friends to meet me.

951
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:17,997
That night, there was 'Ram
Leela' <b>(</b>Play about Lord Ram<b>)</b>.

952
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:24,307
Hail Lord Ram Chandra.
- Hail the Lord.

953
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:27,941
Lord Ram went to
Lanka and defeated Ravan.

954
01:12:28,017 --> 01:12:31,783
Ram is going back
to Ayodhya as a hero.

955
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:35,450
With a smile on his face
and a bow on his shoulder.

956
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:39,222
People were hailing Ram
after Ravan was killed in Lanka.

957
01:12:39,295 --> 01:12:41,889
Following Ram was his
loyal brother Lakshman.

958
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:44,798
They were talking about Ram
and Sita in every village.

959
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:50,864
People came in hordes at the place
at which Ram went with his army.

960
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,208
l am very worried, Dinu.
- Why are you getting worried<b>?</b>

961
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,481
They are my closest friends.
Dhiresh and Gautam.

962
01:12:59,816 --> 01:13:01,807
Their families have
great influence in Delhi.

963
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:05,112
<b>Y</b>es, once we reach Delhi,
we are out of danger.

964
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,186
What if my father learns about it<b>?</b>

965
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,285
<b>B</b>y that time we will be married.

966
01:13:12,362 --> 01:13:13,420
They have made all the arrangements.

967
01:13:13,496 --> 01:13:16,363
As soon as we reach Delhi, we
will get married in the cou<b>rt</b>.

968
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:18,896
Gautam, take left.
- <b>Y</b>es.

969
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:34,840
Someone is following us.
- Hey, you look in the front.

970
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:36,910
Who are they<b>?</b>

971
01:13:38,521 --> 01:13:40,148
Why are you scaring me<b>?</b>

972
01:13:46,129 --> 01:13:48,529
l told you.. Father
won't spare us now.

973
01:13:50,099 --> 01:13:51,862
<b>Y</b>ou.. Nothing will happen.

974
01:13:52,535 --> 01:13:54,526
Drive faster.
- l'm doing that.

975
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:18,889
Take a look at this.

976
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:23,425
Come. Come out.
- Papa.

977
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:25,898
Papa. Papa, leave me.

978
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:28,894
Dinu. - Aren't you
ashamed to do this<b>?</b> - Dinu.

979
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:33,307
Papa, let me go. Leave me. Papa.

980
01:14:33,376 --> 01:14:34,638
Get in.
- Papa.

981
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,038
Dinu.

982
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,978
That's all.

983
01:14:45,922 --> 01:14:47,583
l don't know
an<b>yt</b>hing more than that.

984
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:52,587
My family kept me locked
in a room for <b>tw</b>o months.

985
01:14:57,934 --> 01:14:59,162
Do you remember anyone's face<b>?</b>

986
01:15:00,536 --> 01:15:02,094
They were in police uniforms.

987
01:15:03,272 --> 01:15:04,933
And they had high-power
torches in their hands.

988
01:15:06,075 --> 01:15:08,066
l couldn't see
anyone's face properly.

989
01:15:10,113 --> 01:15:11,410
l could only hear their names.

990
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:15,941
A<b>j</b>ad Shatru and Saitu.

991
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:19,679
Can you identi<b>fy</b> any of them<b>?</b>

992
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:32,056
Sir. Sir. Sir.
- Sir.

993
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:34,294
Sir. Sir.

994
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,964
Sir, is it true that
headman <b>O</b>mkar Sukul's daughter..

995
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,975
..Roshini Sukul is the
prime witness of this case<b>?</b>

996
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:41,101
Right now the
investigation is going on.

997
01:15:41,177 --> 01:15:43,372
<b>O</b>nce the repo<b>rt</b> is filed,
all of you will know about it.

998
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:45,578
Sir. Sir. Please, sir. Case..

999
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:52,281
My driver Hariya. He is
working for me since <b>20</b> years.

1000
01:15:52,588 --> 01:15:55,989
And his father.. He
was my father's driver.

1001
01:15:56,325 --> 01:15:58,122
There was no
problem at all till date.

1002
01:15:58,194 --> 01:16:00,162
We treat him like a
member of our family.

1003
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,011
lf my son gets
carried away tomorrow..

1004
01:16:26,089 --> 01:16:27,556
..and marries a 'Dalit' girl..

1005
01:16:28,324 --> 01:16:30,019
..then l, along with
the people of my caste..

1006
01:16:30,093 --> 01:16:32,027
..will sacrifice him with pride.

1007
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:50,171
Which three boys<b>?</b> Have
you seen them<b>?</b> - Sir. Sir.

1008
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:52,373
Not <b>j</b>ust you, none of us
have seen them. - Sir. Sir.

1009
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:55,046
Why don't you understand<b>?</b>
lt's a conspiracy..

1010
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:58,053
..of the central government to
defame the state government.

1011
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:00,050
Why do you worry<b>?</b>

1012
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:02,052
<b>O</b>nce our pa<b>rty</b> comes in
power in the central government..

1013
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,787
..we will show who
has the upper hand.

1014
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:09,053
We believe that the truth always
comes out victorious. Goodbye.

1015
01:17:26,749 --> 01:17:28,808
What happened<b>?</b>
- What was there to happen<b>?</b>

1016
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:30,147
We went in and came out.

1017
01:17:30,219 --> 01:17:32,483
What did the girl say<b>?</b>
- What would she say<b>?</b>

1018
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:34,546
She was confused like
Gandhari <b>(</b>M<b>yt</b>hological character<b>)</b>.

1019
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:38,083
The C<b>B</b>l scared her a lot
before presenting her.

1020
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:41,824
She won't recogni<b>z</b>e anyone,
will she<b>?</b> - How can she<b>?</b>

1021
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:45,090
<b>B</b>ut the C<b>B</b>l failed completely.
- Really<b>?</b>

1022
01:17:45,168 --> 01:17:47,102
Their faces turned pale.

1023
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:52,301
lt will be fun when people
will shout Shame, Shame at them.

1024
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:56,641
<b>O</b>kay, listen. There's an
army of <b>j</b>ournalists outside.

1025
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:59,644
<b>K</b>eep both your mouth
and temper in control.

1026
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,774
These stupid <b>j</b>ournalists.

1027
01:18:02,418 --> 01:18:05,114
These C<b>B</b>l people who are
walking around with pride..

1028
01:18:05,188 --> 01:18:07,850
..are the ones who should
be taken to the gallows.

1029
01:18:10,126 --> 01:18:12,117
Sir.
- Sir.

1030
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:27,507
Sir, is it true that the
police is also involved in this..

1031
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,807
..and that they are trying
to protect the real culprit<b>?</b>

1032
01:18:29,879 --> 01:18:31,676
And the C<b>B</b>l commander is a member
of the untouchable communi<b>ty?</b>

1033
01:18:31,747 --> 01:18:32,805
ls that true, sir<b>?</b>

1034
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,816
Were you the one to frame Dinu<b>?</b>

1035
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:36,146
Some people even think
that the police is behind..

1036
01:18:36,219 --> 01:18:38,153
..the disappearance of the
three guys. <b>Y</b>our comment<b>?</b>

1037
01:18:38,454 --> 01:18:41,218
Move back.
- Tell us. - Move back.

1038
01:18:43,826 --> 01:18:45,817
Sir, Roshini has taken your
name during the C<b>B</b>l investigation<b>?</b>

1039
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:48,523
There are many persons in
the village with that name. Go.

1040
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:50,623
<b>Y</b>es, but there must be only one
policeman with that name, right<b>?</b>

1041
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,167
Move back. Will you get inside now<b>?</b>

1042
01:19:09,785 --> 01:19:10,911
Move<b>!</b> Go away<b>!</b>

1043
01:19:30,873 --> 01:19:31,931
Take this.

1044
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:34,869
Move back. No one saw an<b>yt</b>hing here.

1045
01:19:34,944 --> 01:19:36,878
Policeman<b>!</b> Please help me<b>!</b>

1046
01:19:37,813 --> 01:19:40,213
Why are you beating me up<b>?</b>
What wrong have l done<b>?</b>

1047
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,475
l am sorry, <b>B</b>rother.
Don't beat me up, <b>B</b>rother.

1048
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:45,746
Let me go.

1049
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:04,102
Many of our people were kidnapped.

1050
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,139
Many of them were killed.

1051
01:20:06,949 --> 01:20:10,749
We saw their families' pain..

1052
01:20:10,819 --> 01:20:15,313
..but we couldn't muster the
courage to feel their pain.

1053
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:19,920
We <b>j</b>ust keep worrying about
our own lives like cowards.

1054
01:20:21,096 --> 01:20:23,758
We weren't strong
enough to fight them.

1055
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:27,826
<b>B</b>ut we have to unite now..

1056
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:31,504
..for our children.. for Dinu..

1057
01:20:32,174 --> 01:20:35,769
The atrocities that we
have been facing since ages..

1058
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:38,836
..we will have to raise
our voice against them.

1059
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:42,839
Hey, l heard that
your wife is gorgeous.

1060
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:45,318
Let me have her someday as well.

1061
01:20:47,122 --> 01:20:49,215
Hey, Manka. Hey, listen.

1062
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:51,191
Don't go home this evening.

1063
01:20:51,259 --> 01:20:53,159
<b>Y</b>our sister's alone at home.

1064
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,522
l will go there.

1065
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:01,802
Come on, it's time.

1066
01:21:02,004 --> 01:21:05,872
Sta<b>rt</b> the commotion. l will
stop from behind. - <b>O</b>kay, sir.

1067
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:09,974
Hey, move.

1068
01:21:10,045 --> 01:21:13,139
Hey, give it to me. Give it to me.

1069
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,542
Leave it. Leave it.

1070
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:18,444
Move.

1071
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:20,382
Leave it.

1072
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:25,417
Come on. Leave it.

1073
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:32,491
Hey, leave it. Leave it.

1074
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:35,561
Hey, leave it. Leave it.

1075
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:38,571
Leave it. Leave it.

1076
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:07,594
Stop right there.

1077
01:22:08,937 --> 01:22:10,268
The way to the cou<b>rt</b> is closed.

1078
01:22:10,338 --> 01:22:11,862
All of you go home.

1079
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:16,537
All of you go home.
lt's my order. Go.

1080
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:28,480
Charge.

1081
01:22:58,253 --> 01:22:59,311
We are taking precaution.

1082
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,289
Leave me. Leave me.

1083
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:07,962
All are from the C<b>B</b>l, sir.
We.. <b>O</b>ne minute.

1084
01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:37,949
The cou<b>rt</b>'s verdict is that
the investigation o<b>ff</b>icers..

1085
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:41,120
..don't have any reason to
keep Roshini Sukul in custody.

1086
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:42,963
Since the girl couldn't identi<b>fy</b>..

1087
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:44,965
..anyone in pa<b>rt</b>icular
in the re<b>q</b>uired time..

1088
01:23:45,033 --> 01:23:48,161
..she is permitted to go home.

1089
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:49,965
The investigation
o<b>ff</b>icers were unable to prove..

1090
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:52,973
..that the missing boys were killed.

1091
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:55,633
And if they were killed,
where are the dead bodies<b>?</b>

1092
01:23:57,045 --> 01:24:00,037
Who killed them<b>?</b> And what is
the reason behind their killing<b>?</b>

1093
01:24:01,516 --> 01:24:03,984
Due to lack of
concrete evidence against..

1094
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:06,987
..SP A<b>z</b>ad Shatru Singh
and other police o<b>ff</b>icers..

1095
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:09,649
..the cou<b>rt</b> ac<b>q</b>uits them.

1096
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:11,988
During the course of this case,
the investigation o<b>ff</b>icers..

1097
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,995
..recorded statements
of many new witnesses..

1098
01:24:15,063 --> 01:24:17,463
..but they completely failed to
present any witness in the cou<b>rt</b>.

1099
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,991
The investigation
o<b>ff</b>icers are found guil<b>ty</b> of..

1100
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:24,732
..misusing their power and
also the government resources.

1101
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:28,005
<b>O</b>ther than that they are
also found guil<b>ty</b> of..

1102
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:31,011
..increasing tension
amongst the public..

1103
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:35,539
..and sensationali<b>z</b>ing this
case with the help of media.

1104
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:39,075
The cou<b>rt</b> gives them a
strict warning regarding this.

1105
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:41,021
And if they are so
desperate to be on T<b>V</b>..

1106
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:44,752
..they could work in
some melodramatic T<b>V</b> serial.

1107
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,384
They will become
heroes on their own.

1108
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,228
This case is dismissed right here.

1109
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:10,039
My <b>B</b>rothers, ours is the only
country in the whole world..

1110
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:12,052
..where we have to fill our name,
caste and religion..

1111
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:14,054
..on every application and form.

1112
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:17,091
This classification of
castes has not been done today.

1113
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:19,116
lt's been there since several years.

1114
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:23,060
<b>O</b>ur ancestors
classified us among castes..

1115
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:25,065
..according to our occupations.

1116
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:32,502
Power. Power. Power.

1117
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:53,820
Power. Power. Power.

1118
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:46,806
Power. Power. Power. Power.
Power. Power.

1119
01:26:48,216 --> 01:26:50,776
Power. Power. Power.

1120
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:54,346
Power. Power. Power.

1121
01:27:27,689 --> 01:27:28,747
They are here.

1122
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:36,390
Come fast. - <b>J</b>ohnny<b>!</b> -
Wake <b>J</b>ohnny<b>!</b> - <b>J</b>ohnny<b>! J</b>uni<b>!</b>

<b>Y</b>ou eat my food and point the
gun at me<b>?</b> - Father. Father.

1129
01:28:54,442 --> 01:28:58,003
Put it around his neck.
- Leave me.

1130

Leave my father. Leave him.

1131
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:07,716
Leave my father.

1132
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:21,893
Leave. Leave me.
- My child.

1133
01:30:35,476 --> 01:30:37,740
Does anyone amongst you
know who did all this<b>?</b>

1134
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:41,371
Can anyone recogni<b>z</b>e them<b>?</b>

1135
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,389
Someone show some

..and tell me who did all this.

<b>Y</b>ou did. <b>Y</b>ou did all this.

1138

What happened<b>?</b>

01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:53,453
Where's your pistol<b>?</b>
- l didn't bring it.

1140
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,648

Public. Media. Parliament.

1147
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:48,746
<b>E</b>verybody is ridiculing us.

1148
01:35:50,057 --> 01:35:52,048
There's a lot of pressure on
me from the top authorities.

1149
01:35:52,793 --> 01:35:54,226
And because of you,
l don't want to be..

1150
01:35:54,295 --> 01:35:55,421
..the scapegoat anymore.

1151
01:35:56,731 --> 01:35:57,857
Write whatever you want to write.

1152
01:35:59,066 --> 01:36:00,966
Give me the final
repo<b>rt</b> as soon as possible.

1153
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:03,303
Sir, please try to understand.

1154
01:36:03,437 --> 01:36:05,701
This is not <b>j</b>ust about
Dinu and his friends anymore.

1155
01:36:06,107 --> 01:36:07,768
Now it's about the
age-old disparities..

1156
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:09,707
l haven't come here
from Delhi to hear..

1157
01:36:09,777 --> 01:36:12,245
..your lecture on caste
discrimination. This is the limit.

1158
01:36:14,081 --> 01:36:17,710
<b>Y</b>ou have already wasted a huge
amount of time and money of the C<b>B</b>l.

Close the case. Shut the o<b>ff</b>ice.

1160
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:21,921
This en<b>q</b>uiry is over.

1161
01:36:40,908 --> 01:36:43,741
<b>E</b>very fool thinks that on

1162
01:36:43,811 --> 01:36:48,180
..and shedding a few tears,
his sins will be washed away.

1163

<b>B</b>ut today's God is also <b>q</b>uite sma<b>rt</b>.

1164
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:58,048

1165
01:36:58,759 --> 01:37:01,785
<b>Y</b>ou are a great wife.
Good lndian wife..

1166
01:37:02,496 --> 01:37:04,794
..who puts up with whatever
nonsense her husband dishes out.

1167
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:09,294
That's why every man
wants a wife like you.

1168
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:11,805
And it's not di<b>ff</b>icult either.

1169
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:14,805
<b>J</b>ust marry a timid girl.

1170

She will do whatever you say.

1171
01:37:20,214 --> 01:37:21,772
<b>Y</b>ou are like those grandmas.

1172
01:37:24,919 --> 01:37:27,786
l wish you could understand
that a woman is not <b>j</b>ust a wife..

1173
01:37:27,855 --> 01:37:29,914
..but also someone's
mother and sister.

1174
01:37:30,524 --> 01:37:31,786
Think about what the mothers and..

1175
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:33,793
..sisters of those three
boys must be going through.

1176

<b>O</b>nly then will you

1179
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:48,841
Last time l had left
without telling you.

1180
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:51,971
This time, l thought l
should tell you before leaving.

1181
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:56,474
So long till we meet again.

1182
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:10,924
The only regret is
that l still love you.

1183
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:40,852

1184

No one's alive.

They killed all of them.

1189
01:39:19,633 --> 01:39:20,895
My child.

1190
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:29,208

1191
01:39:57,304 --> 01:40:00,330
Don't be scared.
Tell them the truth.

1192
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:02,967
They will protect you.

1193
01:40:12,987 --> 01:40:16,218
Surania. Take care of her.

She has regained consciousness,
but her condition is very critical.

Her tongue's been slashed.
She's in great pain.

1221

accepted the crime. - <b>Y</b>es, sir.

1305
01:53:15,368 --> 01:53:17,928
And take their
fingerprints on the a<b>x</b>e.

1306
01:53:18,271 --> 01:53:21,729
lf they go back on their word,
we would destroy..

1307
01:53:21,808 --> 01:53:23,776
..their lives with that same FlR.

1308
01:53:23,843 --> 01:53:24,901
'ln this over, <b>7</b> runs
with <b>2</b> wickets down.'

1309

Tell me, will you give
it to us in writing<b>?</b>

01:53:28,481 --> 01:53:30,779
Sir, we will give
an<b>yt</b>hing in writing.

1311
01:53:30,884 --> 01:53:32,146
We won't tell an<b>yt</b>hing to anyone.

1312
01:53:33,086 --> 01:53:35,418
Please let us go, sir.
- No.

1313
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:38,753
<b>O</b>h, God. That fool. How many times<b>?</b>

1315
01:53:41,828 --> 01:53:45,423
..when he is in the <b>90</b>s.
- Go and sit there. Go.

1316
01:53:45,498 --> 01:53:50,492
Stupid batsman<b>!</b> The
whole country is corrupt<b>!</b>

1317

Look at him. He missed
it by <b>j</b>ust <b>tw</b>o runs.

1318
01:53:54,507 --> 01:53:56,031
He missed a century again.

Here, <b>99</b> and <b>100</b>.

1320

Here, the century is over.

01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:10,981
lG sir, they are from
influential families.

1322
01:54:11,825 --> 01:54:14,794
Leaving them alive was a huge risk.

1323
01:54:15,528 --> 01:54:17,792
They would've opened their
mouths after going to Delhi.

1324
01:54:18,164 --> 01:54:19,791
Milord. Milord.

1325

..that it won't take long for

1350
01:57:17,043 --> 01:57:21,503
..brought here for the post-mo<b>rt</b>em.
The bodies are badly decomposed.

1351
01:57:21,614 --> 01:57:23,707
We are giving you the live

Close the door.

1353

Where are you going, Pratap<b>?</b>

1361
01:59:33,346 --> 01:59:35,314
Don't get carried away.
Listen to me.

1362
01:59:38,785 --> 01:59:39,843
Pratap, stop.

1363

<b>O</b>h, God, Pratap, it's an order.

We are not killers like them.
-This has nothing to do..

1365
01:59:47,193 --> 01:59:49,320
..with your investigation.
This is personal.

1366

this whole case will be ruined.

That's what l think. He
