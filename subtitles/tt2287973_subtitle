1
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,762
Sir, getting late.
- Coming.

2
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,525
New clothes, wear it.

3
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,966
New clothes? Neither it's my
birthday nor any festival,

4
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,570
why new clothes, father?

5
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,730
Today is a victory day
of our entire village!

6
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,672
Entire village's victory?
What is victory, father?

7
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:45,041
Victory is that which we think
and accomplish it.

8
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,944
l too thought of something.
- What's it son?

9
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:52,649
l won today and
l'll win everyday from now.

10
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,755
Okay, l'll comb your hair.
- No father, this is latest style.

11
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:57,552
Okay, but Ammu will come
neatly dressed.

12
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,888
ls Ammu's family too
visiting the temple?

13
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,690
Ammu will be conducting
the program there.

14
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:06,062
Then, you turn that side, father.
l want to tuck in.

15
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,703
How long will you both discuss here?

16
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,772
Sister and family would've left
by now, get ready quickly.

17
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:17,073
We're ready.
- l'm also ready, come...come.

18
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,425
Very fine...how are you sister?

19
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,823
l'm fine sister.

20
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:38,693
Greetings.
- Tings...tings...

21
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,292
What's that hairstyle?
You don't have a comb?

22
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,804
We're very happy to see
you two families, sir.

23
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:52,346
True friends like you are seen only
in epics not in real world.

24
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:56,713
We were just farmhands but we're
going to become farmers now,

25
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,717
and the credit goes
to your friendship, sir.

26
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,822
You both must live happily
for generations.

27
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,687
Not just we, our entire place
will be happy hereafter.

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,293
Come.
- Come.

29
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,645
Where are the white lilies?

30
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,651
Have you forgotten our tradition?

31
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:35,120
How could you forget?
- Sister said she'd bring...

32
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,555
Sister, l made a mistake.

33
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:41,025
l forgot it at home because of
these father and son's troubles.

34
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:44,826
Why don't you go home and bring it?
- l'll bring it, mother.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
You? Will you go alone?
You may get scared.

36
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,696
Scared? Me?

37
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:54,832
Cherry, l love white lilies.
Will you bring it for me too?

38
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,342
What will you give if l bring, Ammu?

39
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,605
l don't want farm documents.

40
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,818
l'll give you this
powerful Lord Anjaneya,

41
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,011
nobody can challenge you
if it is with you.

42
00:04:06,188 --> 00:04:07,018
Then, okay.

43
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,386
Greetings.
- Tings...tings...

44
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,314
This is for Ammu and
this is for Goddess Mother.

45
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:30,559
You all know about this train race.

46
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,199
But this time there's
a little change in the race.

47
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,431
You'll not compete with the train,

48
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,768
you'll go facing a train
coming from opposite,

49
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,435
first one to go aside is the loser!

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,508
Cars are there.

51
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,912
Cars and concept is mine.

52
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,121
lf it hits, we'll die.

53
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,722
ls there kick in the race
without any risk, dude?

54
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:57,290
That's why guys...

55
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:01,421
lf you bet Rs.10000,
you can earn Rs.1 lakh.

56
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,429
There's only one Charminar and
Golconda in Hyderabad,

57
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:10,538
you've proved it again that
l'm the only one in betting.

58
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:20,508
Hey crap!
- Alias dirt!

59
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:22,014
AKA dog!

60
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:23,547
Calm down.

61
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:30,954
Entire Hyderabad knows there's
only one man to win over you.

62
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,285
To win over me?
- Yes.

63
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,828
Who is it? You?
- Not me but my leader!

64
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,727
Who is this street leader?

65
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,130
He's not street leader
but gang leader.

66
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,633
Gang leader?

67
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,704
lf he takes a step, he's Audi,

68
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:45,134
if he shows up, he's 3D,

69
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:48,538
his walk has a style,
there's always a smile on his face,

70
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,541
there's craze in his eyes,

71
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:55,776
there's a terrific body
under his shirt!

72
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,849
Look there!

73
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,254
Human little, high risk!

74
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,693
Hey downtown!
Are you challenging me?

75
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:43,798
Don't underestimate downtown people,
your balls may crack up!

76
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,093
Have you come knowing
my track record?

77
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,171
Our boy is here to break records!

78
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,000
You will lose!

79
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:56,939
Hey proud! l like winning,
l love the pride of victory,

80
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,376
l like to be number one and
l love to defeat guys like you.

81
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:00,879
Take Rs.10000!

82
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,844
Stop!

83
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:09,188
Proud gang versus downtown gang.

84
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,223
Sweat versus scent!

85
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:13,327
lt'll be sensational!

86
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,579
Here's the money won in the bet.

87
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:55,919
Keep it for sister's college fees.

88
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,026
You risked your life for my sister.
- She's our sister.

89
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,230
Where's the party, bro?

90
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:06,526
l'm there for it, right?
Come on guys.- Come to party!

91
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,266

00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,943
Man of violent action...
With electric body...

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,217
He's a cheetah...

He's a winner all way in
Ceded, Andhra, and Nizam areas...

00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,868
He's a greenhorn...

98
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,201
He's a man of all seasons...

99
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:55,909
When he goes all out,
he's sensational...

100
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:03,720
He's star of this modern era...
A star that shines day and night...

00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:51,205
l make my own way...

102
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:55,776

Sea is within me...
Mountain peak is below me...

106
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,751
Destination follows me...

107
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:16,124
He has gone mad...

108
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:21,895
lf you understand its not
madness but confidence...

109
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:30,706
lf his determination catches fire,
it's sensational...

110
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,905
His arrogance is his booster...

My blood thirsts for victory only...

Victory is my slang...
Victory is my language...

118
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,506
Victory is my visa to the world....

119
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:10,475
My father gave birth to me...
You gave me life...

120
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:13,910
He taught me to win...

121
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,209
He's spotless in character...

122
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:19,580
Anyone against him is a kid...

123
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,188
He's sensational where ever he goes...

124
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,992
Poster boy of young men and women...

125
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,320
What? Do you want a maid?

126
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,186
Sorry brother, l don't work
in bachelor's room.

127
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,351
Tell me after you're married,
l'll work then.

128
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,292
Software guys' clothes,
iron it softly.

129
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,864
l'll do but why don't you agree
to work for those bachelors?

130
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:06,022
What an husband!

131
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,829
lt seems they'll fix up...
May l?

132
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,134
Why so early in the morning, father?

133
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,871
What am l to tell you?
l remembered Rama Narayan.

134
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,605
Who is he?
- Did you see?

135
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,046
Though l'm drunk,
l still remember your father's name.

136
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:23,809
But you forgot him.

137
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:26,419
Father, my father's name
is Suryanarayana.

138
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,913
With a peg in,
l forgot two letters.

139
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:34,152
lt's 13 years since we found you, son.

140
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:39,459
lt's 13 years since he found us
not the other way.

141
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,464
What?

142
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:43,229
You got drunk and fell
in railway station.

143
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,872
He brought you home in a train.

144
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,636
Sorry son, l'm telling you now
what l should've told 13 years ago.

145
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,176
What's it?
- Thanks son.

146
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,142
Okay.

147
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,781
Enough...stop it.

148
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,508
What if anything happens to you
after a drinking binge?

149
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:57,617
What would happen to this?

150
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,277
You don't worry,
l'll sell it before it happens.

151
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,821
Look son!
He never realises my pain.

152
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,049
Hey silly woman!

153
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:07,251
We've a 70 kg gold son in home,
nothing will happen to me.

154
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:08,555
Why don't you quit drinking, father?

155
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,699
Okay, let's quit, you quit betting
and l'll quit drinking.

156
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,800
Both would never happen
in this life.

157
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,333
That's sure!

158
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:18,734
You come here on the first of
every month to beg that is also sure.

159
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,072
Madam, please give me alms!

160
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,037
Are you saying we both are same?

161
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,872
How can l dare compare
you with him?

162
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:28,447
He begs from outside every home
and you beg inside the home.

163
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,815
Punch dialogue on owner!
Throw up! Throw up my rent.

164
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,979
My son will take care of
rents and currents. Move!

165
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:39,715
He'll never reform.
- Am l man to reform? l'm a drunkard.

166
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:42,086
He would've had spurious drinks.
- What's it, uncle?

167
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:46,290
What's there? lf you pay rent,
we'll buy provisions. Right?

168
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,163
Why are you asking rent newly?
We've a bet every month, right?

169
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,430
Enough of cheating me for years
since you came here.

170
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:54,006
Every month we'll have a bet
and invariably l lose,

171
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,200
and rent gets exempted.

172
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,072
l want to stop this tradition, right?

173
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:01,682
No uncle...
- You can't convince me.

174
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,719
l've done Yoga and followed
Mantena Sathyanarayana's diet too.

175
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,355
l'm asking you for
the last time, uncle.

176
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,323
Even if it is last time for you,
my first answer is the same.

177
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:14,485
Shall l lock it?
- Anything other than me.

178
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:16,596
Okay, your fate.

179
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,464
l'm here!

180
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:23,160
Aunty, my bet money.

181
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,867
Why should my wife pay
you bet money?

182
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,737
l had a bet with your wife that
you'll not bet this month.

183
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:32,836
What has happened to you?
You bet every month, right?

184
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,345
What happened to you this month?
- Don't pinch me.

185
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:36,245
What's wrong with you?
Why did you wage a bet?

186
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:37,749
Because of pride
- Why are you encouraging young men?

187
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,749
Stop it!

188
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:41,313
Take your action to home,
my bet money, please aunty.

189
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,458
This month's rent too gone!
- Don't put hands my pocket in public.

190
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,354
Take it.

191
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:50,753
Your rent and my percent.
Bye.

192
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,857
No use in playing with me,

193
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,936
tomorrow the man who plays
with you will come,

194
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,505
you will face the music then!

195
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,639
l lost to him!

196
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:07,043
Nothing gives you more kick
than victory.

197
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:12,509
Real kick to me is to win over him.
l must plan it.

198
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:15,684
l'll do it...do it.

199
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,726
Men have won the toss.

200
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:28,893
Listen sisters!

201
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,631
Playing cricket much easier
than running a family.

202
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,706
Bat is nothing but broom,

203
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,843
batting means sweeping with a broom.

204
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,840
What's bowling then?

205
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,979
lt's like making cow dung
cakes on the wall.

206
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,079
Guard please.

207
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:45,616
lf you don't hit a six, it'll hit you!

208
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,062
l'll not accept!

209
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:07,367
She showed her navel
and winked at me.

210
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:10,476
Will you stop playing
if she shows anything?

211
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,203
Your guard is out!

212
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,639
l'll hit a six!

213
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,478
Fool! Stand before the wickets!

214
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,681
Aunty stop!

215
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,955
Mother, don't catch! lt's a six!

216
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:31,195
Am l out?

217
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,664
Buddy, show your magic!
- Hit all sixes!

218
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:34,802
Rock them!

219
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:43,741
Brother, as they bowl, hit a six!
- l'll hit sixes, you drink!

220
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,847
Bat well son, shatter the records!

221
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:48,814
Father!

222
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:51,178
lf you get sweat,
you've my half sari is ready.

223
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,446
lf you're thirsty,
l'm ready with a drink.

224
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,182
No...no...why are you shaking
hands with him?

225
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,259
He's our opponent now,
go to your fielding position.

226
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:01,918
Go, silly girls...go...

227
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,489
Forget about those young girls,
l'm also falling for his charm.

228
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,794
What are you murmuring, aunty?
- Nothing...

229
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:35,020
Come father...
- Bring it fast.

230
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,630
Father, run fast!

231
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:39,899
Find it quickly!

232
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,732
Search girls!

233
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,100
Run fast, father!

234
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:51,977
Father!

235
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:54,582
Hubby!

236
00:22:57,352 --> 00:23:00,116
Father! What happened, father?

237
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:03,082
Get an ambulance!

238
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,862
Father, get up!

239
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:10,858
Father...

240
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:24,110
No problem, right doctor?
- There's problem.

241
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,112
His liver is completely damaged
due to excessive drinking.

242
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,648
Medically it is known
as liver cirrhosis.

243
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:34,447
We can save his life only
with a liver transplant.

244
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:38,583
ls there any chance with medication?

245
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:41,786
We can hardly manage him
for a month with medication.

246
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:43,863
How much a transplant
would cost us, doctor?

247
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,795
lt could be around Rs.20 lakhs!

248
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,307
Mother, serve biryani.

249
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:04,380
Why are you putting chicken
pieces in my plate, father?

250
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,918
l've grown old and
unable to digest it.

251
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:11,616
So, you'll have chicken
and l'll have rice. Have it son!

252
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,823
Why are you looking at me
instead of eating, father?

253
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,460
Nothing son, watching you makes me
wish live for few more days.

254
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:34,040
Do you want to save
your father's life?

255
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:42,853
You?

256
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:44,691
What are you doing here?

257
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:47,654
What you said was right boss!

258
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:52,493
Kick of victory is different.
Thrill of victory is different.

259
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:56,068
Ever since l lost to you,
l don't like myself anymore.

260
00:24:57,004 --> 00:25:00,030
So, let's have one more bet again!

261
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:04,339
Till now you've won a lakh or two
in all the bets you waged.

262
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:09,779
lf you win in this bet, l'll give
Rs.20 lakhs you desperately need.

263
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:13,648
But if l win, you don't need
to pay me even a rupee.

264
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:17,222
l mustn't see you in any
betting in Hyderabad.

265
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:21,020
l mustn't hear your name in
any betting place.

266
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:27,466
What's the bet?

267
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:30,399
lt's not car or bike race this time,

268
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:36,203
must make a girl fall in love with you.
- Love? Girl?

269
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:37,435
What's this meaningless?

270
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:41,412
You said betting must have
kick and risk to life.

271
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,742
What's the risk in it?

272
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,943
Do you know who the girl is?
Bellary's daughter!

273
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,822
Who is he?
- Who is he?!

274
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,803
l love only two things.

275
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,448
One is money and two is money.

276
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,642
l'm busy in making money,

277
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,052
and you're busy to get a place
in my daughter's heart.

278
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:24,316
l don't know anything sir.

279
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,892
She asked me a doubt
and l cleared it, that's all.

280
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:30,861
lf she asks a doubt, you must clear it
in classroom before the students.

281
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,761
Not personally!

282
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,559
She liked your teaching.

283
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:35,827
She liked what you taught!

284
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:39,063
What if she likes you too?
What would my position be then?

285
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:57,250
Never go after a speeding bus or
train or a wealthy man's daughter.

286
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,619
You'll die!

287
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:02,520
That's Bellary in brief!

288
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:06,098
His daughter is a moving
Kohinoor diamond!

289
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:14,637
Her name is Chaitra,
she's studying BDS.

290
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:18,141
She's life-size form of Bellary's life.

291
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:21,746
With the salaries for the security
men he employs to take her to college,

292
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,680
half of Secunderabad's water
problem can be solved with it.

293
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,424
Sathi trusts knife!

294
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:38,326
One who trusts Sathi will
live like a knife!

295
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:53,043
You must tell l love you
to his daughter.

296
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,120
You've come to me
at right time with a right bet.

297
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:09,285
l'm for the deal.

298
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:13,923
But you must do it within 30 days!
- 30 days?

299
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,865
You think you're a win all, right?

300
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,006
Would there be fun without
a boundary in the match?

301
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:21,664
Today is December 2,

302
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,074
by December 31,
she must say l love you to you.

303
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:29,740
if not, you must say good bye
to betting once for all.

304
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:33,079
This is the girl's photo
and other details.

305
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,387
James, keep the money ready.

306
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:45,791
l like your over confidence.

307
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,264
Not over, just confidence!

308
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:21,929
How dare you run into madam!

309
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:24,802
l'll kill you...

310
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:29,203
Order me, madam!
- Leave him.

311
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:30,639
Yes madam!

312
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:36,040
Not leaving him but
excuse and let him go.

313
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,686
Next time if you dare touch
madam's shadow,

314
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:45,257
l'll throw you down from top
floor not from her, mind it.

315
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,291
Go...go...
- Watch them!

316
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:48,928
Let her security go to hell.

317
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,257
What a security! Let's turn back.

318
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,366
What did you get from it, buddy?

319
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,960
Nothing...
- We mustn't attack directly.

320
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:58,934
How?

321
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:02,668
Are you mad?

322
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:08,473
lf you agree one more history,
if not another blood history.

323
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:10,749
What the hell are you blabbering?

324
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,216
lf a girl refuses,
will it be blood history?

325
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:16,015
College is a temple of
Goddess Saraswathi.

326
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,748
Will you threaten an lndian girl
to love in the place of Boss?

327
00:30:19,927 --> 00:30:22,259
You...
- Stop bro!

328
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:26,296
Who are you brother?
- Not yours but her brother.

329
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:32,966
Hey Gandhiji...Bapuji!
What a horrible thing?

330
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:36,268
These idiots have brought the situation
to refrain girls coming to college.

331
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,101
What?

332
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,839
What's happening here?
- l hit my brother instead of him.

333
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,415
Come here.
- You hit and then pacify me.

334
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:47,318
What did Kandukuri Veeresalingam say?
What did Gudivada Appa Rao say?

335
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:48,819
lt's Gurazada not Gudvada.

336
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,923
Brother is in flow,
you carry on bro!

337
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:54,118
What did he say?
He told to beat eve teasers.

338
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,525
Why the entire college
is watching fun?

339
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:01,427
Youth isn't just having Beers;
you must beat rogues like him.

340
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,228
Hold this!

341
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:06,737
Will you throw acid on girls' faces
if they refuse to love you?

342
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:07,497
Will you cut necks in the classroom?

343
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,939
Or else will you throw them
from rooftops?

344
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:18,583
No! Don't clap!

345
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:22,584
The only action l hate in
Telugu language is claps.

346
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,214
Stop your over action and watch it.

347
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:35,357
Have you united?
- Not now, lovers from day one!

348
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:38,127
They're the college's best lovers.
- ls it?

349
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:41,274
lf they marry, they'd become
best couple too.

350
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:45,835
lf we've a fight,
he raises a hell to cool me.

351
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,776
Couldn't you've told me
this before sister?

352
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,111
You went after him like Hitler brother
and didn't give me a chance.

353
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,616
Let's go to class.

354
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,024
Which college are you from?
- Next college.

355
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,720
l came here to react on social causes.

356
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:05,662
Don't react too much,
scene may go against you.

357
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:31,654
Father, sleep for sometime.
- Okay.

358
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,617
What?

359
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:36,627
Got the complete details about her.

360
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:42,059
Calm down, security is very tight in
college and home, meeting her is difficult.

361
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:46,433
You don't dash all his hopes,
she attends dance classes 4 days a week,

362
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,199
if you also join it,
very easy to trap her.

363
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,969
Because security will wait
outside only.

364
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:54,547
Should l learn to dance?
- Don't learn, teach her that's enough.

365
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:55,507
Teach her?

366
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:59,676
Yes, a dance master Rangeela is
coming from Chicago.

367
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,686
lf you catch him, yourjob is done.

368
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,551
When is Lawrence coming?

369
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:13,662
Here comes Rangeela!

370
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,531
He looks like a spoon lifter
from Shamshabad.

371
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,699
Turn it.

372
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,548
Remove the dark glasses and walk.

373
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:37,383
All are one rupee people!

374
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,094
For whom you're here?
- For you only. lt's written here.

375
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,459
But l don't have any information
about your coming.

376
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:49,034
But we've full information sir.

377
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,405

My name is Bobby not washer man!
- l've changed your name.

379
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:01,206
Why are you stuttering?
Maintain distance from me.

380
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:02,940
Why are you asking to
maintain distance from you?

381
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:04,778
Who are you?

382
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,116
Your currency?

383
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,013
Our currency is dollars.

384
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:10,679
What's the distance between you and us?

385
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:11,620
Rs.46!

386
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,226

387
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:17,364
Greetings!

388
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:18,589
Who are these Black Berrys?

389
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:21,530
They Nigerians,
students of our dance school.

390
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,465
What is he saying?

391
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:28,039
lt seems they offered prayers on your
name in Goddess Mother's temple,

392
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,836
and brought offering.
Take it sir.

393
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,444
How come foreigners too have
become great devotees?

394
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:37,615
Take photographs also
along with autographs.

395
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:45,457
ls this Audi ours?
- This auto is ours!

396
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:56,396
Why did you bring me here
instead of dance school?

397
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,595
You would've got tired
travelling long distance, right?

398
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:02,208
To freshen up her.
- Should l fresh up here?

399
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:05,174
l need minimum Taj Krishna
to freshen up.

400
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:08,974
This is father of it, Raj Krishna!
lt's sensational inside.

401
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,409
Why is the outlook so
atrocious like his face?

402
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,815
lnside will be great like your face.

403
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:22,219
Look at this! ls it beautiful?

404
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:30,999
Though slang, piece is good.

405
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:43,882
Would they do Thai massage?
- They'll do Tanuku massage.

406
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:46,246
Tanuku massage?
- They'll massage with kicks.

407
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,183
With kicks?

408
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,950
Come in with right leg first.
This is suit room.

409
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:57,593
ls this hotel? This looks like
Municipal dumping yard.

410
00:35:57,731 --> 00:35:59,426
Would humans live here?

411
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,626
What's that stare?
ls this sofa?

412
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,703
They've put a pillow on a bench.

413
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,533
ls this a fridge?

414
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,902
Why are you making gestures?

415
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,671
You wanted kick massage, right?

416
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,705
Not to let the sound leak out.
- Why would there be sound?

417
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,944
There will be sound if we bash, right?
- Who would you bash now and why?

418
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,453
l'll tell you why there would be
sound if we bash anyone?

419
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:25,854
Why would there be sound?

420
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:31,661
Why have you filled my suitcase
with sugar packets?

421
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:35,593
How did it surface in my suitcase?

422
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,066
lt came with a call from marijuana.

423
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,705
Marijuana?
- lt accompanied cocaine.

424
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:42,068
How did all this stuff came into this?

425
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:43,905
Like that!

426
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,356
You said temple offerings and
filled my suitcase with drugs.

427
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,718
Who are those Black Berrys?

428
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,656
Nigerians drug cartel caught
in Hyderabad.

429
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:09,159
l've understood the matter clearly.

430
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:11,394
You've kidnapped me, right?

431
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,903
You'll go there as dance master
in my place.

432
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:16,508
You'll free me after
yourjob is done.

433
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:20,613
Till then l've to sit tight here.
That's all, right?

434
00:37:36,163 --> 00:37:37,630
Give me the bouquet.

435
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:42,031
l thought of welcoming but
why did you come?

436
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,726
Do you know that l'm not Rangeela?

437
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:46,065
Bald top and paunch down,
how can you be Rangeela?

438
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:48,071
You could be just an assistant.

439
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,842
You got it right.

440
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,307
Here's Rangeela!

441
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:02,487
He looks like Adonis!

442
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:07,350
l thought master would be aged like him.
You're quite young.

443
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:11,729
My name is KV, l've a sister,
she's a golden child,

444
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,595
it may appear silly to say,
she has 20 kgs of gold.

445
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:16,668
20 kgs?!

446
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,139
My sister is the lobe heir
to this academy.

447
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:22,367
Your biggest fan.
- Mine?

448
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:23,669
How can she be your fan?

449
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:25,712
Master's fan!

450
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,369
Come sister.

451
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:39,021
Brother! Master is very handsome!

452
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:45,496
She tears at least 6 shirts every day!

453
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,167
Get me a new shirt.
- Okay sir.

454
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:51,868
Today's your quota is over,
you go inside please.

455
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,600
l'll do it with master, brother.
- What?

456
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,700
No dear, you're a learner.

457
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,346
lf you make a mistake,
you'll lose impression.

458
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:02,038
Do it with him if you want.

459
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:06,084
Brother!
- l trust him. He won't!

460
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:09,984
Come.
- Go! Teach her to dance.

461
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:11,715
Have you brought shirts?

462
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:17,095
Today you've met your master,
Hip-hop classes will start tomorrow.

463
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:18,731
Disperse now.

464
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:30,106
Hello doctor girl!
Have you recognised me?

465
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:32,245
l don't remember you.

466
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:34,238
Looks like she's a brand
ambassador of arrogance.

467
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,941
What's this? As a student in
college and master here.

468
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:38,777
What's the matter?

469
00:39:38,952 --> 00:39:41,420
Don't act innocence,
as if you don't know anything.

470
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,250
Stop over acting.
Are you here to ogle me?

471
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,488
Will you tell everyone about this?

472
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:50,323
l don't discuss such cheap
things with others.

473
00:39:50,497 --> 00:39:53,193
They'll know who you are
from your monkey dance.

474
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,700
They'll send you out and my men
outside would pack you up.

475
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,235
lt would happen parallel!

476
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,770
Please switch on left indicator.

477
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,401
Like wise right too.

478
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:08,236
Bumper too is okay!

479
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:11,213
But the vehicle's pick-up
is little weak.

480
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:17,120
You're good from outside,
l'm here for you,

481
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,224
if we unite, it's sensational!

482
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:34,097
Are you angry at my drinking
habit for ruining my health?

483
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:37,835
Calm down father, had you not
been drunk would we've met?

484
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:41,276
l would've become
an orphan without you.

485
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:44,815
Had you not met me that day,
l too would be an orphan, father.

486
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,289
Stop it!

487
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,798
What's that?
Hip hop or lolli pop?

488
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,594
What's the drill like a drill master?

489
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:05,504
Students, l'll show you a new program.

490
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:10,837
Dance without break till the music plays.

491
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,496
Why did you stop it?
What happened?

492
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:43,166
Didn't stop, my body aches
dancing continuously.

493
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:45,106
1l'll have some water.

494
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,483
Me? l'm not Rangeela master.

495
00:41:52,652 --> 00:41:54,552
l'm not a kid.

496
00:41:54,788 --> 00:41:57,222
He has come in your place
blackmailing you,

497
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,689
and you're helpless,
l know everything.

498
00:42:02,996 --> 00:42:05,624
Thank you very much,
at least you know it.

499
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:08,562
We've seen rogues and
crooks to the core,

500
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,327
but he's purebred crook!

501
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:12,699
He's using my face and my position.

502
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:15,340
He's playing with my life now.

503
00:42:15,942 --> 00:42:19,708
l beg you...l'll fall at your feet,
please save me.

504
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,541
You needn't have to fall
at my feet,

505
00:42:21,715 --> 00:42:24,115
l'll see that he falls at your feet.

506
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,017
Why are you limping?
- l slipped in bathroom, master.

507
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,589
Slipped?

508
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,325
l too slipped yesterday.

509
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:36,519
lt's wrong dear, you're like a girl.

510
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:39,688
Don't say slipped, say leg slipped.

511
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,299
You stop, sir.

512
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,403
What's the condition now?
- l think l've sprained my leg.

513
00:42:45,205 --> 00:42:47,070
Can't you dance today?

514
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,765
When did he do?
- You shut up!

515
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:53,435
l think l can never dance again.
- Go away!

516
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:57,249
Today's class is dismissed.
Let's continue tomorrow.

517
00:42:57,417 --> 00:42:59,214
Why can't you dance master?

518
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,613
lf assistant sprains his leg,
why should the class be dismissed?

519
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:04,353
You're finished, downtown!

520
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:06,253
Me?
- Yes master.

521
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:09,759
We love to see Sachin hitting century,
Rajini smoking a cigarette,

522
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,592
my slim sister wishes to see
you dance like Megastar!

523
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:15,632
Brother!
- l told you l've only one shirt.

524
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,827
Look, l'm a coach!

525
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:19,995
Whether it is cricket,
hockey or boxing,

526
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:21,606
have you seen coach playing?

527
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,509
Why are you watching silently?
You pay hefty fee, right?

528
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,741
Ask him you want to see your
dance magic not this words logic.

529
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:33,419
Master! You must dance!

530
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:34,576
Finished!

531
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,789
You want me to dance, right?

532
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:42,622
l always dance with a good partner.

533
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:46,698
lf there's a good dancer among you,
l'll definitely dance.

534
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,094
There is!

535
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:50,735
Me?

536
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,249
O my parrot, may l bit your sweet
and alluring lips...

537
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:50,522
Heir of the Konidela family,
have you become so daring?

538
00:44:50,697 --> 00:44:54,929
Don't know what happened my heart
is rebelling and is after you...

539
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:59,072
Oh no! Don't come after me,
calm down, new bridegroom...

540
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:03,133
Hey white chick!

541
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,770
You may become a mother by
morning in the anxiety...

542
00:45:07,948 --> 00:45:11,850
No way you can do it...

543
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:16,648
Your street smartness won't
work out, my dear...

544
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,051
Hand to mouth existence
is your life...

545
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:30,219
Rolling in Rolls Royce's
is my range...

546
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:34,390
Love between you and me
is ajoke, my boy...

547
00:46:34,534 --> 00:46:38,834
Though loaded with arrogance,
you're an epitome of beauty...

548
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,702
l too don't like a love without risk
which has no thrills...

549
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:47,074
l'm the Everest, which
no beauty can match...

550
00:46:47,313 --> 00:46:51,943
Angels would follow me
at the snap of my finger...

551
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:39,297
Abracadabra! This marble statue's
beauty would vanish...

552
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:44,096
Don't over reach yourself,
you can't get me so easily...

553
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:05,421
With body like Brad Pitt and
learning hip hop dance...

554
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,494
lf you plan to trap this rich girl,
you can never succeed...

555
00:48:09,662 --> 00:48:14,031
There's no speed breakers
till l get what l wish...

556
00:48:14,234 --> 00:48:17,829
l'll never miss my goal
once l set my target...

557
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:22,202
Are you mad? Don't fry my brain
with your craziness...

558
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:27,108
What a horoscope yours is!
l'm following you...

559
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:58,306
Dance practice is in
progress there, go!

560
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,480
How is my touch?

561
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:06,242
Did you sleep last night?

562
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:10,589
lf you cross my path like this,
you'll go sleepless.

563
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:13,123
Threatening me?
- l'm confirming it.

564
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:19,960
Matter of love!

565
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:22,124
l'll do anything for love.

566
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:25,964
Love? With me?
You'll lose.

567
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,667
My genes have only victory in them.

568
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:34,641
Why are you walking away?

569
00:49:34,814 --> 00:49:38,181
Are you scared of falling for me
if you talk to me?

570
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:46,716
Look downtown, l'm not a girl to fall
for your cheap tricks.

571
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:50,089
You claim to have victory genes.

572
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:53,288
Do one thing, l love you
is three letter word,

573
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:56,526
l'll give you three tests.
- Love test?

574
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,369
Take it as you feel.

575
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,830
l'll pass out with distinction!

576
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:04,774
My entire family will be in
GVK mall for birthday shopping,

577
00:50:04,944 --> 00:50:09,881
give me love letter and propose as
my family and security men watch,

578
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,210
l think about you then.

579
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:16,046
lsn't this any plan to trap me, right?

580
00:50:16,923 --> 00:50:17,981
Right?

581
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:19,886
l'm not that fluent in English.

582
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:24,290
l'll give you love letter and
open the first page of love in you.

583
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:26,087
Let's meet in the mall tomorrow.

584
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,396
lf you beat my people or
if they beat you, you lose!

585
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,038
Have you laid a condition?

586
00:50:33,206 --> 00:50:35,731
Okay, let me see it!

587
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,551
What will you buy for me, daddy?

588
00:50:53,793 --> 00:50:56,387
l'll buy for your birthday too, dear.

589
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:10,770
Hey Bellary!

590
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:19,783
Who are you?

591
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:23,115
Shall l come to you or
say it from here?

592
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:27,255
Send him to me.

593
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,539
What's this Bellary?

594
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:48,704
What's this security?
Why so many goons?

595
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:50,781
Why these gun men?
Why this tight security?

596
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,248
Are you so scared to come out?

597
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,715
Do you know with whom
you're talking to?

598
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:57,822
l know, B-E-L-L-A-R-Y!

599
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,857
Why did you name after a place as
if you didn't get any other name?

600
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:02,051
Change it.

601
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:03,861
l'll blow up your head.

602
00:52:03,963 --> 00:52:05,863
Remove the gun.

603
00:52:07,133 --> 00:52:08,293
Who are you?

604
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,361
Human little, high risk!

605
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:19,740
l don't know when or where l saw or
met your daughter but l've fallen.

606
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:21,980
l'm unlike others.

607
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:26,114
l've come to propose to your
daughter before you.

608
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:37,319
Baby, you call it as pudding
if there's rice in milk,

609
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,966
and if one gets a lover like you,
it's known as fate!

610
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,006
Kill him!

611
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:53,105
Move...move...

612
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:59,047
This is a TV reality show,
if you've guts, do it!

613
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,708
Will it come on TV?

614
00:53:01,654 --> 00:53:04,054
Shock to the celebrity,
it'll be on air on Sunday sir.

615
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,054
You did a good jog sir.

616
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:10,184
You've won a prize with
your perfect performance...

617
00:53:10,363 --> 00:53:11,352
What's that?

618
00:53:12,665 --> 00:53:14,030
Claps please.

619
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,292
Stop!

620
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:19,898
Who is the director of this program?
- There he is!

621
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,747
Wash him using this Surf Excel!

622
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,248
Smashed your nose...

623
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:37,790
While washing clothes with Surf,
l slipped and fell down.

624
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:39,618
Why are you taking this risk?

625
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:42,386
Why don't you live happily
washing my sister's clothes?

626
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:44,223
Should l wash your sister's clothes?

627
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:45,959
Why?

628
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:48,623
Do you think your sister wears clothes?

629
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,393
lt's tents and camps.

630
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,867
l can't wash your sister's clothes.

631
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:58,670
Where are you going?
- For dance practice.

632
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,737
Go!

633
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:06,141
How was my yesterday's twist?
- Very cheap!

634
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,951
Cheap?- l thought you'd show your courage
not a TV reality show.

635
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:16,083
What to do? You said conditions apply
and l applied my common sense.

636
00:54:16,262 --> 00:54:18,526
That's street smartness,
anyone can do it.

637
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:24,136
As second test l'll come to your
home and give you a flower.

638
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:26,437
Will you come to my home?

639
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,106
Right into the middle of your home.

640
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:35,306
Four floors, eight halls,
20 bedrooms, 200 security men,

641
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,711
securing with knives and guns.

642
00:54:37,884 --> 00:54:42,082
Will you enter my home,
give me a flower and propose to me?

643
00:54:42,255 --> 00:54:43,483
Definitely.

644
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:45,485
l'll not enter like a thief,

645
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,852
l'll enter breaking your door
like a hero,

646
00:54:48,027 --> 00:54:51,087
l'll come in bashing your men
like a Cheetah.

647
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:55,765
You can beat anyone.
But nobody must beat you.

648
00:54:55,935 --> 00:54:57,095
Perfect condition.

649
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,762
lf anyone beats me or a drop of
my blood touches ground,

650
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,999
l'll say quits to this love.

651
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:09,344
You saw reality show earlier,
now you'll watch real show.

652
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,022
Will he come? ls he so brave?

653
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:54,357
You? Again a TV reality show?
- This time a real show.

654
00:55:55,361 --> 00:56:01,300
My sweetheart, my heartbeat!
l'm here to give a flower to my love.

655
00:56:02,602 --> 00:56:03,899
Who are you?

656
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,300
l'm proud, son of victory!

657
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,363
lf you give me way without
wasting time,

658
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:10,566
l'll present a flower to my darling.

659
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,904
Dare take a step further!

660
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:15,411
l'll give you a bumper offer.

661
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,708
Dare stop my on step!

662
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:20,147
The place you stop me,
l'll go back from there.

663
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,255
lf you're a man of word,
take a step!

664
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,583
Do it, it's a question of honour.

665
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:26,747
Come on.

666
00:56:40,206 --> 00:56:42,731
Did l crack any joke to
laugh so much?

667
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:43,533
lf not what else man?

668
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:46,644
You're tall like a palm tree,
broad chest like Papikonda,

669
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:50,976
courage of Telengana,
Konaseema cuts and Rayalaseema guts.

670
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,618
you've all this and
yet they're brandishing guns,

671
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:58,120
then either you must be a coward
or l must be powerful than you.

672
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,520
Guns down boys!

673
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,788
Brother, astrology predicts
bad day for us.

674
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,521
Not mine but yours.

675
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:10,969
Throw your guns.
Throw your guns in it.

676
00:57:57,316 --> 00:57:58,180
Run!

677
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:21,205
Let him go inside but the flower
shouldn't go inside.

678
00:59:09,021 --> 00:59:11,421
Human little, high risk.

679
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:26,200
Boss!

680
00:59:26,806 --> 00:59:29,036
What happened here?

681
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,608
That TV channel guy came and
gave a flower to madam.

682
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,938
What were you doing while
he was giving her a flower?

683
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:36,843
We tried to snatch the flower
from him, boss.

684
00:59:37,016 --> 00:59:38,779
We tried to beat him, boss.

685
00:59:39,685 --> 00:59:42,950
Did you beat him like that?
- He beat us like that, boss.

686
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,463
Did you see how easy it is
to make you fall?

687
01:00:04,877 --> 01:00:08,813
After letter and flower,
love has come nearer to me.

688
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:15,583
Giving letter or flower knowing my dad
isn't at home is not heroism.

689
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:18,655
Switch on left indicator.

690
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,622
No muscle just arrogance!

691
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:26,253
l'll not come to you,
l'll take you with me,

692
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:28,297
not for couple of hours
but entire day,

693
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:33,996
and present you as gift a memorable
day from your own life.

694
01:00:35,374 --> 01:00:38,207
You saw outside, right?
Security has been doubled.

695
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:40,409
Look doctor girl!

696
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:46,950
Once l decide,
guns or men don't scare me.

697
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,212
l'll take you as your
security men watch.

698
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:52,846
As they watch and without
anyone getting a doubt,

699
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:54,993
l'll drop you again in your home.

700
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:59,024
Your love track is interesting now.

701
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:02,598
This time you can bet anyone
or anyone can beat you.

702
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:05,601
lf you still live, let me think then.

703
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:08,035
Hey my little dumb baby!

704
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:12,600
Be ready to say it!

705
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,811
Clearance will come immediately.

706
01:01:21,987 --> 01:01:22,715
Boss.

707
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,880
The man who came in
shopping mall and home,

708
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,788
he may come at any time
from any side,

709
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:30,360
keep an eye on all sides.

710
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:31,461
Remove those glasses.

711
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:33,120
Atleast then you'll see what he does.

712
01:01:33,265 --> 01:01:35,358
Brother, you remove it
and l'll wear it.

713
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:41,636
Bye father!
- Bye dear!

714
01:02:00,793 --> 01:02:01,851
What's that commotion?

715
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:05,096
Leave them, poor people.

716
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:19,475
Where are our cars?
l'm asking you.

717
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:20,942
Where are our security men?

718
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,746
How would l know madam?
- You?!

719
01:02:26,552 --> 01:02:27,951
When did you get into the car?

720
01:02:44,536 --> 01:02:45,560
Get down madam.

721
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:47,736
Son!

722
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:51,137
He's Brother A K Paul!

723
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:52,811
How did you get into our car?

724
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,843
No son, we're in our car only.

725
01:02:55,014 --> 01:02:56,982
l you want check the number plate.

726
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,675
We were going to spread good news
and car got mixed in your convoy...

727
01:03:00,853 --> 01:03:01,842
l think l've seen you somewhere.

728
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:03,989
We're all children of God, my son.

729
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,987
Don't keep crying face.

730
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:10,288
Not for us, cry for yourself and
your missing madam.

731
01:03:10,462 --> 01:03:11,724
What are you saying?

732
01:03:11,897 --> 01:03:12,727
True, boss.

733
01:03:12,898 --> 01:03:14,388
She got into the car before my eyes.

734
01:03:14,566 --> 01:03:16,557
But she's missing on
reaching college, boss.

735
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:20,170
Search her.
Take the vehicles.

736
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:55,301
You're no ordinary man.

737
01:03:55,474 --> 01:03:58,534
l said l'd take you from
your tight security.

738
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:03,209
Spend the entire day freely!

739
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:40,517
Just a leg space is enough...

740
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:46,352
Just a day of life together
is enough...

741
01:04:58,704 --> 01:05:11,811
A wish...you are my heart's
only one wish...

742
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:15,886
Hey, your tresses are
hot kurkure...

743
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:20,388
Hey, your words are sweet
Cadbury chocolates...

744
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,593
You are my rainbow...

745
01:05:56,962 --> 01:06:04,494
You are my day and night...
You are my happiness and worry...

746
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:11,667
You entered my heart like wind...
Swiftly you arrested my breath...

747
01:06:12,044 --> 01:06:19,246
You are my dream...
You are my treasure...

748
01:06:19,418 --> 01:06:22,444
You met raindrops like lightning...

749
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:27,081
You spread like thick
clouds instantly...

750
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:30,820
Given a new life...
Becoming your life partner...

751
01:06:30,996 --> 01:06:34,261
l'm coming as the light
in your shadow...

752
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:38,297
Hey, one day may l come
before you...

753
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:41,997
Hey, may l show you wonders...

754
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:49,376
Hey, may l give you the happiness
enough for a lifetime...

755
01:07:19,478 --> 01:07:26,941
There's only one sky and
there's only one opportunity...

756
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,919
You gave wings to the birds...

757
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,490
You gave shine to
the shining stars...

758
01:07:34,626 --> 01:07:41,589
There's only one happiness
and only one message...

759
01:07:41,733 --> 01:07:45,760
Give colours to the flowers...

760
01:07:45,904 --> 01:07:49,465
Speed up the flowing rivers...

761
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:53,338
Whether it is a rainbow
or gentle drizzle...

762
01:07:53,512 --> 01:07:56,572
Will it add fun to our happiness?

763
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:17,731
You can't understand
my tension, lawyer.

764
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:20,770
Press and public mustn't know this.

765
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:23,407
Tell this to Commissioner.

766
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:30,145
Boss, madam Chaitra is here!

767
01:08:38,857 --> 01:08:39,824
Move man!

768
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:40,923
Please come now.

769
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,955
Madam, you move, he'll die...

770
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,227
Not me, you and yourjob is over!

771
01:08:53,705 --> 01:08:55,002
Fire me sir!

772
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:58,667
Fire me for saving and bringing
back your daughter safely.

773
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:01,409
Don't believe his words, boss.

774
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:03,807
What will you tell?
May l tell what he'll say, sir.

775
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,677
Earlier gave letter and
said reality show,

776
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,284
then gave a flower and said real show,

777
01:09:07,452 --> 01:09:09,443
now will give a twist and
say it's night show.

778
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,350
He'll say he's crook, boss.

779
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:12,217
ls that what you'll say, right?

780
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:13,289
Stop that dirty smile and tell him.

781
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,483
Don't believe him boss he acts well.

782
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,323
What will you say?
He cheats, beats and escapes.

783
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:23,831
He scolds and creates some magic.
He says he's a gladiator, boss.

784
01:09:23,969 --> 01:09:25,493
That's it, right?
Tell him.

785
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,160
Stop it!

786
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:28,997
Who the hell are you?

787
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:32,599
Good! Did anyone of these
fools ask me this?

788
01:09:32,778 --> 01:09:34,609
Who am l?
Where did l come from?

789
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,439
Why did l come here?

790
01:09:35,614 --> 01:09:38,777
Boss, don't believe anything he says.
He kidnapped madam.

791
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,646
Did l deny it?

792
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,617
l kidnapped Chaitra madam.
- Why?

793
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:46,223
To tell you how many fools
are around you.

794
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:50,024
lnstead of spending millions
to feed such idiots,

795
01:09:50,195 --> 01:09:52,561
please think about
unemployed like me, sir.

796
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,565
At least one application will get
reduced from employment exchange.

797
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:04,635
l'll leave the bike where you
missed Chaitra, go and bring it.

798
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:05,640
Bye sir.

799
01:10:07,546 --> 01:10:08,774
Boss, my bike...

800
01:10:09,214 --> 01:10:11,910
Change his position from tomorrow.

801
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:29,865
He said change their positions,
does it mean we are fired?

802
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:31,696
Not mine, yours!

803
01:10:45,517 --> 01:10:46,279
Who is it?

804
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:50,512
Didn't recognise my voice?
lt's me!

805
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:52,549
Sorry Baireddanna!

806
01:10:52,724 --> 01:10:56,592
l've good news for you,
got the clearance from Govt.

807
01:10:56,761 --> 01:11:01,425
Other than one hurdle we don't have
any hurdles for laying foundation.

808
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:03,032
Okay.

809
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:05,795
l see some difference
in your voice.

810
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:10,840
As foundation laying ceremony
approaches, l foresee a bad omen.

l'm in political position
l'll manage everything.

812
01:11:15,046 --> 01:11:20,416
Problem isn't that one; some guy is
after Chaitra in the name of love,

813
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:23,418
l'm scared of losing my daughter.

814
01:11:23,588 --> 01:11:28,389
Keep her away from him for
few days, stay away from him.

815
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:34,465
Let's see him after January 1, okay?
- Okay.

816
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:40,093
Can you manage it by January 1?
- Definitely, doctor.

817
01:11:40,272 --> 01:11:44,265
After the formalities are over,
l'll inform the date of operation.

818
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:45,902
Bye.

819
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:52,680
What's your confidence?

to pay the operation fee.

821
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,345
May l tell you breaking news?

822

Bellary has stopped Chaitra
attending college.

823
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:05,094
Tightened her security till
her birthday.

824
01:12:05,664 --> 01:12:09,691
Just 3 more days for your
deadline and your father's life.

825
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:21,036
The number you've dialed
is switched off...please call...

826
01:12:31,423 --> 01:12:34,119
l've been trying your cell since
morning, it's switched off always.

827
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:35,850
lt's a long tale,

828
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:39,360
Not later, l'm coming to you now.
We're meeting, that's it.

829
01:12:39,831 --> 01:12:40,923
No!

01:12:41,099 --> 01:12:42,657
Don't take the risk at this time.

831
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:46,165
Look, three tests are over.

832
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:48,400
l want to hear those words from you.

833
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:52,065
Love mustn't be expressed in
tension or under pressure.

834
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:56,414
l'll come to dance school on
the night of December 31,

magical moments.

838
01:13:26,678 --> 01:13:28,475
Why did you call me
so early in the morning?

839
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:30,740
To give you a shocking news.

840
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:37,050
That girl is coming to dance school
to express her love to me.

841
01:13:37,222 --> 01:13:38,883
Come there with money.

842
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:44,794
You can with your eyes, hear with
your ears and give me the money.

843
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:06,908
Carry on.

844
01:14:08,086 --> 01:14:09,644
Baireddy hasn't come yet, sir.

845
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:13,816
He's not coming, he cancelled
for a party meeting in Delhi.

846
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:15,254
Come here.

847
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,392
What's that?

848
01:14:18,063 --> 01:14:20,224
No cooling at all.
Didn't fridge it?

849
01:14:20,398 --> 01:14:21,456
l'll put ice cubes, brother.

850
01:14:21,633 --> 01:14:22,998
Add liquor to it and bring.

lt's going to strike 12,

852
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:41,945
Chaitra is missing!

853

Look properly!
- l did...she's missing!

854
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,925
Damn it!
What l feared has happened!

855
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:05,575
What happened?

856
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,875
My parents know about us.
That's why...

857
01:15:26,297 --> 01:15:28,197
No need to fight them, let's go.

858
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:32,294
Enough of your show, leave her.

859
01:15:33,638 --> 01:15:35,265
Do you know what is sensational?

860
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:38,907
Know it now.

861
01:18:27,645 --> 01:18:29,408
Let's go...come...come...

862
01:18:39,157 --> 01:18:40,954
Are you mad?
What the hell are you doing?

863
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,218
Will you kill your own
daughter in anger?

864
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:48,293
Daughter? Who is my daughter?
Whose daughter is she?

865
01:18:48,466 --> 01:18:51,026
She's not my daughter at all!

866
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:52,758
What are you saying?

867
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:56,532
l rose her so fondly all these
years to kill her today.

868
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,768
He's not taking away
an ordinary girl.

869
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,139
Rs.10000 crores worth property!

870
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:53,688
Have you know to know
her whereabouts?

871
01:19:53,865 --> 01:19:57,460
We've alerted all the
check-posts in the city.

872
01:19:59,604 --> 01:20:01,731
We've informed forest
department also.

873
01:20:03,307 --> 01:20:05,172
We've faxed their photos too.

874
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,145
We'll know about Chaitra's
whereabouts in an hour, sir.

875
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:11,372
Not will know, we must know.

876
01:20:24,262 --> 01:20:25,126
Yes uncle, tell me.

877
01:20:25,263 --> 01:20:27,493
ls the young man with you?

878
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,467
Little away.

879
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:33,365
Everything is going on as we planned.
Be careful.

880
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:34,768
Okay uncle.

881
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:40,109
That phone is not safe,
they may locate you with signals,

882
01:20:40,278 --> 01:20:41,540
throw it away.

883
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:42,846
Okay.

884
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:02,857
Chaithu is very happy and elated!

885
01:21:03,134 --> 01:21:04,965
l got trapped!

886
01:21:05,503 --> 01:21:08,870
You gave me so much happiness
but why are you dull?

887
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,907
Last night's twist was
too much for me.

888
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:15,444
l was expecting l love you
but you brought me to forest.

889
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:18,905
l don't understand one thing,
you were silent till yesterday,

890
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,448
why did you suddenly
change to vibration mode?

891
01:21:20,618 --> 01:21:25,954
What can l do?
l was insecure amidst security.

892
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:27,591
But not now!

893
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:31,551
New year, new life with you.

894
01:21:33,364 --> 01:21:34,331
Good!

895
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:39,459
Raj, you passed my 3 tests
taking risk for me.

896
01:21:39,637 --> 01:21:46,270
There won't be a more romantic
place than this to say l love you.

897
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:48,774
That's why...

898
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:50,310
Stop...stop...

899
01:21:50,481 --> 01:21:52,915
You must not say it her
but before a man.

900
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,608
Before a man?

901
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:58,118
Since it is love, if you want
l'll express it before your family,

902
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,348
l'll express it before my family also.

903
01:22:00,525 --> 01:22:02,254
But who is this new man
between us?

904
01:22:06,197 --> 01:22:08,392
Raj, they're my men,
if they catch us, you're dead.

905
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:28,217
Who amongst you would
like to die first?

906
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,911
Why are you looking at me?

907
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:34,922
l want to die but not before
having a Thai massage.

908
01:22:35,092 --> 01:22:36,787
Arrange for it and then kill me.

909
01:22:38,095 --> 01:22:41,462
All are sitting down,
why are you sitting on a stool?

910
01:22:41,599 --> 01:22:43,032
Place has no difference sir.

911
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:45,896
Once l got the stick from you,
l can't differentiate top from bottom.

912
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:50,939
He blackmailed and took your
place as dance master,

913
01:22:51,075 --> 01:22:52,406
what the hell were you doing then?

914
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:55,637
To be frank with you,

915
01:22:55,813 --> 01:22:57,303
what the hell did you do when
he took away your daughter?

916
01:22:57,481 --> 01:22:58,675
We too did the same.

917
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:03,242
l'm asking you for the last time.
Tell me his plan.

918
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:04,353
l'll spare your lives.

919
01:23:04,522 --> 01:23:06,683
Mother promise, we don't
know anything, sir.

920
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,722
We're just friends because we
live in the same neighbourhood.

921
01:23:08,926 --> 01:23:12,362
We're in now connected
to him, sir. Promise sir.

922
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:16,257
We can't understand his plans,
we'll understand after he executes it.

923
01:23:16,434 --> 01:23:17,298
That we've been cheated!

924
01:23:17,468 --> 01:23:20,301
Give that phone.
- No balance in your phone.

925
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:22,632
Give!

926
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:24,297
He'll definitely call you.

927
01:23:24,508 --> 01:23:26,772
He'll not call me, l swear,
he'll not call me.

928
01:23:26,944 --> 01:23:28,036
lf he calls...?

929
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:31,010
Like Bombay became Mumbai
and Madras became Chennai,

930
01:23:31,249 --> 01:23:34,309
l, dance master Rangeela would
become your driver Rangi.

931
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:35,315
lf he doesn't call me...?

932
01:23:35,486 --> 01:23:38,216
l'll leave you all by evening.

933
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,885
Where the hell he is?

934
01:23:42,326 --> 01:23:44,317
He has left this pain with me.

935
01:23:45,763 --> 01:23:47,628
Give me your phone.
- Phone?

936
01:23:47,798 --> 01:23:49,197
l need to make an urgent
call to home.

937
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,200
l forgot my phone in home in
the tension of meeting you.

938
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,339
So, you came leaving your
phone at home?

939
01:23:56,507 --> 01:23:59,442
What happened to your phone?
You too came without a phone, right?

940
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:02,545
While beating up your father's men,
it fell in the dance school.

941
01:24:02,713 --> 01:24:05,876
So, nobody would know
where we are!

942
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:09,747
But one person must know
where we are!

943
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,013
We must find a fool who will
give the phone to us.

944
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:22,497
What happened, darling?
- Run out of petrol, darling.

945
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:26,103
Run out of petrol?
Where are we now?

946
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:28,295
ln forest.
- Forest?

947
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:29,370
Jungle!

948
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:36,278
l told you to take me on a long ride,
will you bring me to Srisailam forest?

949
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:40,880
l didn't bring you, darling.
You held me softly,

950
01:24:41,052 --> 01:24:43,486
l don't know whether l liked your
hold or the place you held,

951
01:24:43,654 --> 01:24:46,282
l forgot about the world
till bike ran out of gas.

952
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:47,718
How?

953
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:54,923
Greetings.

954
01:24:59,937 --> 01:25:01,268
Not 0.5 bro!

955
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:06,167
l'm a great fan of you, sir.

956
01:25:10,348 --> 01:25:14,751
Hearing your replies to love queries,
l got tempted and eloped with her.

957
01:25:15,086 --> 01:25:18,146
my answers have so much fire?
- As much as to misfire!

958
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:21,920
No use in saying well done.

959
01:25:22,093 --> 01:25:24,186
Shouldn't we tell our friends
about this issue or not?

960
01:25:24,395 --> 01:25:25,020
Then, give me your phone.

961
01:25:25,196 --> 01:25:26,128
What happened to your phone, bro?

962
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:30,424
Would anyone come with a phone
while eloping with a girl?

963
01:25:31,602 --> 01:25:33,934
You're my disciple, right?
Make calls.

964
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,063
FM station guy will pay it.

965
01:26:03,901 --> 01:26:06,335
No Baireddanna, try to understand me.

966
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:08,471
Excuse me.
- What?

967
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,470
Why are you always on move
like 108 ambulances?

968
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:12,609
Why don't you sit in one
place and talk?

969
01:26:14,779 --> 01:26:18,545
Why are you beating me like ringing
bells in a school every hour?

970
01:26:20,117 --> 01:26:21,812
Boss, he's getting a call.

971
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,720
Unknown number, check it.

972
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:30,853
Talk!

973
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:32,488
Why should l talk sir?

974
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:34,962
Won't you talk if Bellary says? Talk!

975
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:39,060
What master?

976
01:26:41,672 --> 01:26:44,004
Why did you call me?

977
01:26:44,175 --> 01:26:48,635
Had you not been there would l've
met Chaithu or eloped with her?

978
01:26:49,647 --> 01:26:53,105
So, l called you to wish you first
happy New Year.

979
01:26:53,284 --> 01:26:56,845
Oh my sweet darling!
Did you call me for that?

980
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,512
That's okay,
how are Nalla Seenu and Bobby?

981
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,318
What do they lack?
They're fine and fettle.

982
01:27:02,493 --> 01:27:03,824
What nonsense are you blabbering?

983
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:06,360
Find!
- l got you!

984
01:27:06,564 --> 01:27:09,829
Tell me where are we now?
- Next to my father-in-law.

985
01:27:11,469 --> 01:27:13,767
Where are you?

986
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:17,897
lf you talk about my father,
let it be anyone, l'll kill him.

987
01:27:18,075 --> 01:27:21,909
Where is my daughter?
- 160 lbs weight, 170 cms height,

988
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:25,446
six pack body and
guts to face people like you,

989
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:29,313
father-in-law, she's next
to downtown Raj!

990
01:27:29,487 --> 01:27:31,478
You're playing with death.

991
01:27:31,655 --> 01:27:33,953
That's my hobby since birth.

992
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:37,184
lf l get you,
l'll cut you like a bull!

993
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,023
lf you manage to catch me,
l'll happily get cut by you.

994
01:27:40,197 --> 01:27:42,722
l'll kill you before sunsets today.

995
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:45,301
l'm giving you chance
till tomorrow's dawn.

996
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:46,629
Make a try!

997
01:27:48,072 --> 01:27:51,371
1lf you shout, just noise!
lf l shout, it's lightning!

998
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,135
You...

999
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,711
Sir, don't get excited.
Listen to me.

1000
01:27:56,881 --> 01:28:00,408
The girl with is not your daughter
but Rs.10000 crores!

1001
01:28:02,553 --> 01:28:05,920
Send this incoming number
to our lnspector.

1002
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:06,920
Okay boss.

1003
01:28:07,091 --> 01:28:10,458
You said he'd not call, right?
- l felt like that sir.

1004
01:28:11,362 --> 01:28:12,659
A ball of mashed chilies,

1005
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:14,093
ball of dry chilies,

1006
01:28:14,265 --> 01:28:15,732
a ball of broken glass pieces,

1007
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,391
mix all the three and
shove it into their...

1008
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:21,002
Their shouts must be heard all
over the state of Andhra Pradesh.

1009
01:28:24,108 --> 01:28:25,006
Battery is low.

1010
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,336
lf you push the bike,
we can talk and walk.

1011
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:30,378
We've to go that side,
your fans will turn up to help you.

1012
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:32,345
Fans?

1013
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,074
Push...that's it!

1014
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:46,619
A Sumo is getting down
from a Sumo.

1015
01:28:46,797 --> 01:28:48,424
What man?

1016
01:28:49,967 --> 01:28:52,060
Are you here on patrol?
- Think like that.

1017
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:54,432
l've run out of gas,
will you please give me some petrol?

1018
01:28:54,638 --> 01:28:57,038
Not little, l'll fill the tank.

1019
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:00,608
You want regular or extra power?

1020
01:29:00,911 --> 01:29:04,369
Extra power will help me go faster!
- Will it go faster?

1021
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:07,711
Okay, l'll do but what's your name?

1022
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,714
Who is this baby with you?

1023
01:29:18,662 --> 01:29:21,426
Did she fall for you or your bike?

1024
01:29:21,632 --> 01:29:23,725
Don't ask me confusing questions, bro!

1025
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:28,034
Are you shaking hands
with him or ditching me?

1026
01:29:28,172 --> 01:29:31,471
What are you doing in this forest?

1027
01:29:31,675 --> 01:29:34,701
Your body has grown
but not your brain.

1028
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,470
We've come a long ride.

1029
01:29:36,647 --> 01:29:42,779
What? Did you come on a long ride
to Srisailam forest from Hyderabad?

1030
01:29:42,953 --> 01:29:45,854
What do you see on my ears?

1031
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:50,215
Hair!
- Taunting me!

1032
01:29:50,394 --> 01:29:53,227
Who called just now from your phone?
- My disciple, bro.

1033
01:29:53,397 --> 01:29:55,126
Just now he left for
sightseeing with his lover.

1034
01:29:55,299 --> 01:29:57,859
ls he your disciple?

1035
01:29:58,035 --> 01:30:00,629
Not ordinary disciple
but like Ekalavya!

1036
01:30:00,804 --> 01:30:03,500
Do you know with whose
daughter he has eloped?

1037
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:05,505
Some scapegoat's daughter!

1038
01:30:05,676 --> 01:30:08,668
Not a scapegoat's daughter
but Bellary's daughter.

1039
01:30:08,846 --> 01:30:11,576
Bellary? Who is he?

1040
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:18,687
This is atrocious, sir!

1041
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:21,381
Even Kasab is handled softly
in our country,

1042
01:30:21,558 --> 01:30:24,550
it's not good to beat
a celebrity like this, sir.

1043
01:30:25,429 --> 01:30:27,420
Tell me, where is he?

1044
01:30:27,598 --> 01:30:30,931
Where is your disciple who has
eloped with Bellary's daughter?

1045
01:30:31,101 --> 01:30:33,592
Sir, please raise your baton.

1046
01:30:33,937 --> 01:30:37,338
l swear on your baton sir,
l don't know who he is!

1047
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,203
l met him accidentally.

1048
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:41,805
He beat me again.

1049
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:45,107
Met you by accident and
took your phone,

1050
01:30:45,282 --> 01:30:48,149
he went that side and
you came this side, right?

1051
01:30:49,586 --> 01:30:51,816
That's why you've become
an Sl at this young age.

1052
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:57,555
Why are you beating me again, sir?
- l'm not an Sl but Cl!

1053
01:30:58,195 --> 01:31:02,461
Like getting water in a draught
place, l got myself a girl,

1054
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:03,531
please leave me sir, we'll go.

1055
01:31:03,734 --> 01:31:05,759
l don't have any link with him, sir.

1056
01:31:05,936 --> 01:31:09,269
Without any link with him,
what were you doing with him in jungle?

1057
01:31:09,406 --> 01:31:12,705
l said we went on a long drive.
- Shut up! Tell me clearly.

1058
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:22,748
Would anyone go a long drive
from Hyderabad to Srisailam?

1059
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,717
You...how many times
do l've to tell you?

1060
01:31:24,888 --> 01:31:29,052
My bike is outside,
if she holds you from behind,

1061
01:31:29,226 --> 01:31:32,423
l reached Srisailam,
you would've reached Srilanka.

1062
01:31:32,596 --> 01:31:34,621
ls it?
- lndeed!

1063
01:31:38,902 --> 01:31:39,891
Where are you going sir?

1064
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:43,904
You told me, right? l'll go on
a long ride with your love.

1065
01:31:44,074 --> 01:31:49,011
l said that in a flow sir.
- l like your flow.

1066
01:31:49,613 --> 01:31:54,641
She's tiny like a pulse and
you're big like a bandicoot. No sir!

1067
01:31:55,619 --> 01:32:00,147
Protect justice and
justice will protect you.

1068
01:32:00,324 --> 01:32:04,317
My wife has gone to
her parents' home.
- So?

1069
01:32:04,695 --> 01:32:07,528
She'll cook for me till
my wife comes back.

1070
01:32:08,265 --> 01:32:12,634
Disciple! You've made my girl
friend a call girl with just one call.

1071
01:32:14,104 --> 01:32:15,230
Come, let's go home.

1072
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:17,402
He's taking her away.

1073
01:32:24,548 --> 01:32:26,880
l'm hungry!

1074
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,416
Would you like to eat me?
- How?

1075
01:32:29,953 --> 01:32:33,252
l'm pure vegetarian.
- Then, eat leaves like a goat.

1076
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:35,922
l don't eat plain leaves.

1077
01:32:39,563 --> 01:32:42,327
Stop! Same sound!

1078
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:53,502
Come, let's bath
- l'll not come, you carry on.

1079
01:32:53,844 --> 01:32:56,574
Why?
- l take bath once in two days.

1080
01:32:56,747 --> 01:32:59,580
Why?
- We get water on alternate days only.

1081
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,615
You go, l'll sit here.

1082
01:34:24,902 --> 01:34:32,308
Rain is pouring down...
Mounts and valleys are thrilled...

1083
01:34:32,442 --> 01:34:40,747
When my love's mischievous eyes
touches me like gentle rain...

1084
01:34:41,985 --> 01:34:49,585
l'm spellbound by an
unknown happiness...

1085
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,287
When my lover's breath touches me
like gentle breeze...

1086
01:34:53,463 --> 01:34:57,695
l'm charmed by an
unknown happiness...

1087
01:35:37,374 --> 01:35:44,746
Beauty of the beautiful
damsel's cheeks...

1088
01:35:44,915 --> 01:35:51,320
lt belongs to the macho man
next to her...

1089
01:35:51,488 --> 01:36:07,598
Pollen dust of the first rain...
- Beauty of wet gold is eternal happiness...

1090
01:36:07,771 --> 01:36:11,400
When my love comes closer
like a shivering wet leaf...

1091
01:36:11,575 --> 01:36:15,807
l'm enamored by an
unknown happiness...

1092
01:37:20,277 --> 01:37:35,386
When we are in a tight hug...
- lt ignites fire of desire...

1093
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:42,397
ln the falling darkness,
the chill winds are rocking...

1094
01:37:42,532 --> 01:37:50,530
Youth is melting in the
embrace of desire...

1095
01:37:50,707 --> 01:37:56,304
When laments become invitation
and desires cross boundaries...

1096
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,916
l'm overwhelmed by
an unknown happiness...

1097
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:45,686
l was waiting for this day
for 13 long years.

1098
01:38:46,429 --> 01:38:47,987
We should be laying
foundation stone today,

1099
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:50,189
but she has made sit tight here.

1100
01:38:50,367 --> 01:38:54,804
l'll cut her into pieces and offer
it as sacrifice for our project.

1101
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:56,268
Stop it.

1102
01:38:56,439 --> 01:38:59,499
l came down from Delhi
because you're too emotional.

1103
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:03,506
Bellary, what knives can't do,
guns will do it,

1104
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,978
what guns can't do,
bombs will do it,

1105
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:09,915
what bombs too can't do,
my son will do it.

1106
01:39:10,086 --> 01:39:13,419
Call him from Dubai.
- Okay sir.

1107
01:39:13,757 --> 01:39:16,225
Now, junior villain's entry.

1108
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:43,277
You've power and police with you,

1109
01:39:43,453 --> 01:39:44,351

1110
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,182

what the hell are you doing?

1111
01:39:46,356 --> 01:39:49,120
We've alerted police
and check posts.

1112
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:51,590
Actually you must alert this.

1113
01:39:51,995 --> 01:39:57,524
Till we get her property,
to stay away from her...

1114
01:39:57,667 --> 01:40:01,364
You made me stay in Dubai.
What happened now?

1115
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:07,676
Without touching airports,

1116
01:40:07,844 --> 01:40:10,438
without a trace in bus stations
and railway stations,

1117
01:40:10,614 --> 01:40:12,275
without crossing any check post,

1118
01:40:12,449 --> 01:40:14,644
where have they escaped?

1119
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:17,709
l'll not leave her.

1120
01:40:18,154 --> 01:40:21,715
He started the game
and l'll start the hunt.

1121
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:26,794
Watching Discovery channel,
l thought forest would be very romantic.

1122
01:40:26,963 --> 01:40:28,590
But it's quite different.

1123
01:40:28,765 --> 01:40:31,199
Your father and his men have
left us in this situation.

1124
01:40:31,401 --> 01:40:33,426
Don't know which side road comes
and which side is the city?

1125
01:40:33,603 --> 01:40:36,504
And you want romance now?
Come.

1126
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:52,077
How many lilies!

1127
01:41:00,163 --> 01:41:01,061
Stop!

1128
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:06,299

The girl l like loves it.
- Who is she?

1136
01:42:18,074 --> 01:42:20,872
Chaithu! Look there!

1137
01:42:22,212 --> 01:42:23,804
What's that? Fog?

1138
01:42:23,913 --> 01:42:27,349

eatery or a village.

01:42:41,131 --> 01:42:43,156
No chance of getting?
- No way.

1144
01:42:44,334 --> 01:42:45,824
You said no way, it did come, right?

1145

01:47:08,498 --> 01:47:09,556
6What are you looking at?

1192
01:47:09,866 --> 01:47:14,132
Remember the tests and
risks l took to pass it.

1193
01:47:15,238 --> 01:47:17,433
ls it fun to watch me?

1194
01:47:17,607 --> 01:47:19,871
My father is dying there.

1195
01:47:20,076 --> 01:47:22,806
Operation is over and
your father is safe.

1196
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:28,812
Can't you believe it, Raj?

1197
01:47:31,387 --> 01:47:34,720
Son, you bet on anything
since childhood,

1198
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:40,887
l was afraid you were playing with life,
but the same risk has saved my life.

1199
01:47:42,098 --> 01:47:46,865
Your friend gave money and helped
protect your mother's marital status.

1200
01:47:50,273 --> 01:47:52,867
What's this?
Before l won the bet.

1201
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:56,500
l knew you'd win this bet
the day you agreed to it.

1202
01:47:56,979 --> 01:47:58,674
How do you know about the bet?

1203
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,180
She was the one who
forced me to this bet.

1204
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:08,181
Yes Raj, you think you entered
my life because of your father.

1205
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:11,485
No, l entered your life on my own
for my own sake.

1206
01:48:14,831 --> 01:48:18,028
l've been losing for 13 long years
without a victory,

1207
01:48:18,167 --> 01:48:20,863
l liked your character
who wins always and never loses,

1208
01:48:23,473 --> 01:48:28,069
l saw your good nature to help
people not related to you,

1209
01:48:30,747 --> 01:48:35,081
l liked your bravery for giving love
letter with 200 security men around.

1210
01:48:37,587 --> 01:48:41,079
l liked you gut so enter my
home and gave me a flower.

1211
01:48:42,425 --> 01:48:47,692
l liked your smartness for letting
me enjoy a day of freedom.

1212
01:48:49,265 --> 01:48:51,563
Though your father was to get
operated next morning,

1213
01:48:51,801 --> 01:48:55,828
you didn't leave a girl in danger,
l liked your manliness.

1214
01:48:58,841 --> 01:49:01,275
You've the stubbornness
of hundred people.

1215
01:49:01,444 --> 01:49:03,605
You've guts of thousand people.

1216
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:06,214
You've intelligence of
a lakh people.

1217
01:49:06,382 --> 01:49:10,648
That's why l sent my close friend and
classmate James to you,

1218
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:13,687
and made you, one who does
anything for a bet to accept his bet.

1219
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:17,886
They're there!

1220
01:49:20,997 --> 01:49:22,362
Don't spare them, kill them!

1221
01:49:57,233 --> 01:50:00,760
Will you leave her hand or die?

1222
01:50:58,394 --> 01:50:59,088
Come!

1223
01:55:06,041 --> 01:55:07,599
Get her!

1224
01:55:13,649 --> 01:55:16,618
lt's me Ammu!

1225
01:56:21,684 --> 01:56:26,383
How do you know her name is Ammu?

1226
01:56:26,555 --> 01:56:30,116
Only Ammu calls me as Cherry
other than my parents.

1227
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:32,889
She gave me this dollar.

1228
01:56:33,762 --> 01:56:39,758
That means...
are you Suryanarayana's son?

1229
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:52,509
Wait...just a minute.

1230
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:11,026
Hello father! Raj is none other
than Suryanarayana's son!

1231
01:57:20,009 --> 01:57:22,034
Come, let's go to hospital.

1232
01:57:22,177 --> 01:57:26,375
lt's not important that l live
but a truth must live.

1233
01:57:26,548 --> 01:57:28,607
lt's important for
an ambition to be alive.

1234
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:36,754
lt wasn't a mishap that happened
while distributing land documents.

1235
01:57:36,959 --> 01:57:39,484
They created it as an accident.

1236
01:57:42,064 --> 01:57:43,622
Our place is Rayadurgam.

1237
01:57:44,433 --> 01:57:47,231
For the village Goddess Sunkulamma
is unseen God,

1238
01:57:47,436 --> 01:57:50,234
but your father Suryanarayana
was a living God to them.

1239
01:57:50,873 --> 01:57:54,274
Your father and Raghupathy were
close friends from college days.

1240
01:57:54,643 --> 01:57:58,602
Because of their true friendship,
on the advice of your father,

1241
01:57:58,781 --> 01:58:02,615
Raghupathy leased his 3000 acres
of land to Rayadurgam farm coolies,

1242
01:58:02,785 --> 01:58:04,810
and gave them a livelihood.

1243
01:58:06,622 --> 01:58:09,216
After Raghupathy left
to London for business.

1244
01:58:09,525 --> 01:58:12,756
His brother-in-law Bellary
came to know about a truth.

1245
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:18,366
Your guess is correct.
As you think this mud in this area,

1246
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:21,833
the 3000 acres of land which
Raghupathy leased it to farm coolies,

1247
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,961
it has A-grade iron ore.

1248
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:27,631
lf we dig and sell it, we can
build bathrooms also in gold.

1249
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:29,304
Brother!

1250
01:58:29,945 --> 01:58:32,505
To avoid people getting any doubt,

1251
01:58:32,681 --> 01:58:35,809
power project on paper and
our project beneath it.

1252
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:38,475
As much as we dig it up!

1253
01:58:39,421 --> 01:58:46,384
They made people to accept saying this
project will provide jobs and secure future.

1254
01:58:48,030 --> 01:58:51,488
lf factory comes up,
our children's future will be happy.

1255
01:58:51,667 --> 01:59:01,269
Your father tried to tell them project is
bogus and they want to dig for iron ore.

1256
01:59:01,477 --> 01:59:04,640
We don't care if it is iron ore or gold,

1257
01:59:05,514 --> 01:59:09,006
we need to eat, please leave us.

1258
01:59:09,184 --> 01:59:13,678
Like a goat trusts the butcher,
people believed Bellary's words.

1259
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:15,683
What's this?

1260
01:59:15,858 --> 01:59:17,587
Why are you worried when
they themselves are not?

1261
01:59:17,793 --> 01:59:20,489
They're like kids,
we've to change them.

1262
01:59:20,662 --> 01:59:23,654
l'll talk to Raghupathy after
he comes back from London.

1263
01:59:23,932 --> 01:59:25,524
He'll not say no to me.

1264
01:59:28,404 --> 01:59:34,240
Fearing he may talk to Raghupathy,
they took your father that night.

1265
01:59:36,945 --> 01:59:42,212
They threatened to kill you and your
mother if he talks to Raghupathy.

1266
01:59:43,485 --> 01:59:45,976
Next day Raghupathy
returned from London.

1267
01:59:46,889 --> 01:59:47,480
Get down carefully.

1268
01:59:47,656 --> 01:59:49,920
Entire village was wishing
to see Raghupathy,

1269
01:59:50,092 --> 01:59:52,526
but he was eager to see your father.

1270
01:59:52,694 --> 01:59:55,629
l thought Suryanarayana would
welcome me, where is he, Bellary?

1271
01:59:55,764 --> 02:00:00,701
He has gone to Srisailam to fulfill
a vow for poor getting land.

1272
02:00:03,138 --> 02:00:10,135
Even sun may rise late but Suryanarayana
would never come late to see me,

1273
02:00:10,312 --> 02:00:11,574
Raghupathy got a doubt,

1274
02:00:15,217 --> 02:00:17,742
With the same doubt he went
to his home,

1275
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:24,650
from the tears of your mother,
he came to know the truth,

1276
02:00:29,331 --> 02:00:33,028
saving his friend, he wanted
to teach a lesson to Bellary.

1277
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:45,576
No! Go away from this
place immediately.

1278
02:00:45,747 --> 02:00:50,275
Bellary left the place but
not brother-in-law's property.

1279
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:55,719
From now no more lessees,
only owners will be there.

1280
02:00:55,891 --> 02:00:59,520
On the coming full moon day,
my daughter Chaitra's birthday,

1281
02:00:59,661 --> 02:01:02,255
on that day, in the witness
of Goddess Sunkulamma,

1282
02:01:02,431 --> 02:01:04,524
l'll hand over the land documents
from the hands of my daughter,

1283
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:06,759
and make you farmers forever.

1284
02:01:06,935 --> 02:01:09,961
lf you attack the family now,

1285
02:01:10,138 --> 02:01:12,299
entire property would go to trust,
you won't get it.

1286
02:01:12,508 --> 02:01:14,601
There would be some loophole
in every clause, right?

1287
02:01:14,776 --> 02:01:15,868
Find it.

1288
02:01:16,044 --> 02:01:17,534
There's one opportunity.

1289
02:01:18,447 --> 02:01:22,110
Property will go to his daughter
after Raghupathy's death.- Yes.

1290
02:01:22,284 --> 02:01:25,344
She'll become major at 18,

1291
02:01:25,521 --> 02:01:30,015
you can get the entire property
with just one signature.

1292
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:34,294
By morning coolies would
become farmers,

1293
02:01:35,931 --> 02:01:37,091
the dawn too broke!

1294
02:01:37,466 --> 02:01:40,697
Entire was in a festive mood.

1295
02:01:40,869 --> 02:01:44,771
But as soon as you left to get flowers,
a murderous assault was launched.

1296
02:01:49,411 --> 02:01:50,173
Hubby!

1297
02:02:30,886 --> 02:02:32,148
Uncle!

1298
02:02:32,788 --> 02:02:36,724
From today l'm not your uncle.
l'm your father!

1299
02:02:37,693 --> 02:02:41,151
Bellary hugged her and
became father for her property.

1300
02:02:45,267 --> 02:02:46,859
Threatening the survivors,

1301
02:02:47,336 --> 02:02:52,933
they made police to believe it was
an accident explosion of transformer.

1302
02:02:57,312 --> 02:03:00,577
Water should've wetted the
land but got wet with blood.

1303
02:03:01,383 --> 02:03:05,342
Your father who fought
for land, died for it,.

1304
02:03:16,999 --> 02:03:19,126
Your father is not alive
to tell the truth.

1305
02:03:20,035 --> 02:03:21,866
You got the opportunity.

1306
02:03:23,639 --> 02:03:26,574
Now l know why God saved
my life then.

1307
02:03:28,844 --> 02:03:31,904
Take the documents of those
3000 acres of land.

1308
02:03:33,915 --> 02:03:34,643
Go!

1309
02:03:35,617 --> 02:03:37,482
Fulfill your father's wish!

1310
02:03:39,388 --> 02:03:41,948
Let's go to hospital.

1311
02:03:53,969 --> 02:03:56,802
Call Bellary on phone.

1312
02:04:37,579 --> 02:04:43,279
Singareni is filled with coal...

1313
02:04:43,452 --> 02:04:49,254
Polavaram is filled with green fields...

1314
02:04:49,424 --> 02:04:52,257
Konaseema is draped in sari...

1315
02:04:52,427 --> 02:04:55,294
My eyes are shattered seeing
this stunning beauty...

1316
02:04:55,464 --> 02:04:58,228
Hands are itching to caress and
legs are yearning to put on her...

1317
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,062
My anklets are yours, my Cherry...

1318
02:05:01,236 --> 02:05:04,171
My youth wants you
to get rid of my worry...

1319
02:05:04,339 --> 02:05:07,035
Cherry will bring you anklets...

1320
02:05:07,209 --> 02:05:10,576
l'll do what you want, don't worry...

1321
02:05:58,059 --> 02:06:00,823
Fruit garden is there
but can't pluck fruits...

1322
02:06:00,962 --> 02:06:03,829
Tender tamarind leaves are there
but can't taste its sourness...

1323
02:06:03,999 --> 02:06:06,729
Milk pot is there but
can't take the butter...

1324
02:06:06,935 --> 02:06:09,563
Young maiden is there but
can't take her into his arms...

1325
02:06:09,738 --> 02:06:12,536
Lips are seeking something...
Waist yearns to be held...

1326
02:06:12,908 --> 02:06:15,638
l'm your hairpin, my Cherry...

1327
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:18,678
l'll come in a palanquin,
don't worry...

1328
02:06:18,847 --> 02:06:21,748
O my girl, l'll come riding
the seven horses...

1329
02:06:21,917 --> 02:06:25,045
Don't worry, l'll gallop with you...

1330
02:07:00,856 --> 02:07:03,484
Cot is ready but
can't get on the bed...

1331
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:06,456
Glass of milk is there but
hasn't yet tasted it...

1332
02:07:06,628 --> 02:07:09,290
Everything is right before me
but l'm confused...

1333
02:07:09,464 --> 02:07:12,228
There's home and comforts
but no romance...

1334
02:07:12,367 --> 02:07:15,336
She says door is cradle...
and wants a pumpkin...

1335
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:18,268
Get me silver toe rings, my Cherry...

1336
02:07:18,440 --> 02:07:21,068
l'll follow you, don't worry...

1337
02:07:21,376 --> 02:07:24,174
l'll come with sacred thread, my girl...

1338
02:07:24,346 --> 02:07:27,804
Don't worry, l'll tie the knot...

1339
02:07:42,097 --> 02:07:45,123
Aren't you scared on seeing me?

1340
02:07:45,267 --> 02:07:47,428
You're not my father,

1341
02:07:47,602 --> 02:07:50,969
you're the demon who
killed my father,

1342
02:07:51,139 --> 02:07:52,367
the moment l came to know this,
l'm not scared of you anymore.

1343
02:07:58,747 --> 02:08:00,715
l raised her from this age.

1344
02:08:01,182 --> 02:08:04,879
How did she come to know
l'm not her father, lawyer?

1345
02:08:06,488 --> 02:08:12,950
How did she get the idea of
escaping the day she became major?

1346
02:08:14,029 --> 02:08:17,521
Why are you asking me?
How would l know?

1347
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:25,232
What is your son James doing
in forest without your knowledge?

1348
02:08:25,807 --> 02:08:30,107
Why is your son struggling
to save her life?

1349
02:08:30,745 --> 02:08:36,581
l know, he went to forest to
save Ammu on my orders,

1350
02:08:37,185 --> 02:08:43,420
he said father, soldiers die
first in a war and went.

1351
02:08:44,125 --> 02:08:47,561
l was the one who breathed
life into this story.

1352
02:08:49,197 --> 02:08:50,892
Why are you surprized?

1353
02:08:51,099 --> 02:08:54,762
l won't forget the sins committed
by sinners like you so easily.

1354
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:57,370
Remember again what you did!

1355
02:08:57,539 --> 02:09:01,942
You've to be patient for 15 years
to get the property.

1356
02:09:03,144 --> 02:09:08,081
lt wasn't for your good the idea that
you'd get property if she becomes major,

1357
02:09:08,249 --> 02:09:11,548
to protect Ammu safely
in your custody.

1358
02:09:13,788 --> 02:09:16,723
l told her the truth as she grew up.

1359
02:09:16,891 --> 02:09:19,553
l needed a man before
she becomes major.

1360
02:09:19,728 --> 02:09:21,525
That's why sharpness of a knife,

1361
02:09:21,763 --> 02:09:24,527
power of a bullet,
explosiveness of a bomb,

1362
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:26,997
l saw all these three characters
in a downtown boy,

1363
02:09:27,168 --> 02:09:29,329
and selected them as
your opponent.

1364
02:09:31,072 --> 02:09:36,374
Staying with me and eating my salt,
how could you do all this?

1365
02:09:36,544 --> 02:09:38,944
l learnt it from you, Bellary.

1366
02:09:40,515 --> 02:09:41,504
Kill me!

1367
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:46,082
To light thousand homes, don't mind
losing the light of our home,

1368
02:09:46,254 --> 02:09:47,243
so said my son,

1369
02:09:47,422 --> 02:09:50,983
but think of your plight
before killing me.

1370
02:09:51,159 --> 02:09:52,558
what's there to think?

1371
02:09:52,727 --> 02:09:55,287
Would that downtown boy
come after us?

1372
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:59,796
He's not a downtown boy!
Do you remember Rayadurgam?

1373
02:09:59,968 --> 02:10:02,960
Third ward...Fourth Street...

1374
02:10:03,972 --> 02:10:06,338
House next to Panchayat office.

1375
02:10:11,379 --> 02:10:14,177
He's Suryanarayana's son!

1376
02:10:14,516 --> 02:10:16,541
Suryanarayana's son?

1377
02:10:17,185 --> 02:10:20,382
What? ls he Suryanarayana's son?

1378
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:24,950
ls your body experiencing a Tsunami?

1379
02:10:25,827 --> 02:10:27,658
Did you see how great God is?

1380
02:10:28,129 --> 02:10:31,997
God melted for tears of the poor and
helped to meet Suryanarayana's son.

1381
02:10:34,402 --> 02:10:36,199
He would be coming for you.

1382
02:10:36,638 --> 02:10:39,300
No, my husband would be coming!

1383
02:10:40,675 --> 02:10:44,543
He would be marching
ahead for the people!

1384
02:10:44,712 --> 02:10:46,509
Like a roaring tiger!

1385
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:48,444
Like an attacking lion!

1386
02:10:48,616 --> 02:10:51,642
He's going to jump on you
like a marauding force!

1387
02:11:04,165 --> 02:11:05,462
His son!

1388
02:11:07,268 --> 02:11:09,566
Talk to him!

1389
02:11:09,838 --> 02:11:13,865
Tell him to come to Rayadurgam
with the land documents.

1390
02:11:13,975 --> 02:11:17,411
Let's finish him where
he escaped death.

1391
02:11:19,414 --> 02:11:22,406
lf not she'll die here.
Talk to him.

1392
02:11:22,717 --> 02:11:23,581
Talk to him.

1393
02:11:24,586 --> 02:11:27,851
Hello son, l'm coming to
Rayadurgam with Ammu,

1394
02:11:28,022 --> 02:11:30,252
ask Raj to come there
with documents.

1395
02:11:33,828 --> 02:11:36,820
l didn't tell him fearing
Ammu's death.

1396
02:11:36,998 --> 02:11:40,263
l said that in the happiness
that you'd die there.

1397
02:11:57,318 --> 02:12:00,651
Same walking style!
Same pride!

1398
02:12:02,891 --> 02:12:05,382
l feel like l'm seeing your father.

1399
02:13:05,787 --> 02:13:07,846
Same place and same people!

1400
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:12,983
But whatever happens here now
will be history.

1401
02:13:14,829 --> 02:13:18,424
You're a kid, you're not old
enough to create history.

1402
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:22,229
Hey old man! Age is not a
criterion to create history.

1403
02:13:22,403 --> 02:13:25,099
Support of people is enough.
We've it always!

1404
02:13:25,306 --> 02:13:28,070
What makes you so proud?

1405
02:13:28,243 --> 02:13:31,610
l'm not one to beat thighs
for something,

1406
02:13:32,113 --> 02:13:36,049
as promised, here's the document.

1407
02:13:38,653 --> 02:13:39,711
Where is Ammu?

1408
02:13:40,655 --> 02:13:43,055
Ammu is not here.

1409
02:13:43,458 --> 02:13:47,827
Everyone here knows where she is!
But nobody will tell you.

1410
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:50,695
Look there!

1411
02:13:56,371 --> 02:14:02,640
13 years ago they thought
you died here,

1412
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:04,402
the moment they came
to know you're alive,

1413
02:14:04,579 --> 02:14:06,740
they've come running for you,

1414
02:14:07,782 --> 02:14:10,774
we want property and
they want you,

1415
02:14:10,952 --> 02:14:15,753
and you want to fulfill
your father's wish.

1416
02:14:17,325 --> 02:14:19,885
lt seems you're a king in betting.

1417
02:14:20,061 --> 02:14:22,427
lt seems you know only victory
and never lost a bet.

1418
02:14:22,563 --> 02:14:26,431
So, let's have a bet.

1419
02:14:26,868 --> 02:14:28,597
lf you win,

1420
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:31,436
Ammu is yours and
the property as well.

1421
02:14:31,606 --> 02:14:35,599
l risked my life for
my adopted father.

1422
02:14:35,977 --> 02:14:40,846
l'm ready to take any number
of lives to fulfill father's wish.

1423
02:14:41,015 --> 02:14:44,451
You mustn't take lives,
you must give life.

1424
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:49,556
Can you save a life that
will die in 10 minutes?

1425
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:54,919
Want to know who would
die in 10 minutes?

1426
02:15:08,309 --> 02:15:10,140
Don't shout.

1427
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:14,338
The place for which your
people sacrificed their lives,

1428
02:15:14,515 --> 02:15:17,507
Ammu is now in that same place!

1429
02:15:17,685 --> 02:15:20,586
l promise on Goddess Sunkulamma,

1430
02:15:20,755 --> 02:15:22,347
with 1000 homes in that village,

1431
02:15:22,523 --> 02:15:25,390
if you find in which home
your Ammu is,

1432
02:15:25,526 --> 02:15:28,893
your dead father's wish
would come true. Go!

1433
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:53,202
That's Suryanarayana's son!

1434
02:18:47,762 --> 02:18:53,257
Till now you've seen power cuts
and harvesting paddy!

1435
02:18:53,434 --> 02:18:57,200
Show them what is killing spree!

1436
02:19:48,623 --> 02:19:51,183
Kill him!

1437
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:30,854
At last your father's dream of
distributing lands has come true.

1438
02:21:31,025 --> 02:21:34,153
May those great men be
born as twins to you.
