1
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,303
What is this sir?

2
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,347
You guaranteed that
you'd teach me in a week!

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,053
My promotion's going
to be announced today.

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,429
Which means life will
be moving forward...

5
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,011
But look at my reverse! It sucks!

6
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,305
Relax, you'll be fine...

7
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,647
See this watch?

8
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,058
A student gifted
it to me yesterday...

9
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,027
foreign... not the watch,
my student.

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,109
A teacher's reward...
don't you forget.

11
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,610
C'mon try again...

12
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,205
Man...I'm getting an automatic!

13
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,409
Why are you wasting my time
teaching me on manual gears?

14
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,035
If you learn on
the manual stick shift,

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,919
you'll be able to drive
any car in the world.

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,080
Who knows,
today you're driving an automatic,

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,331
tomorrow you may not
even own a cycle!

18
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,213
Sir must you think such evil
thoughts aloud early in the morning?

19
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,176
My promotion is up today...
Say something positive.

20
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,388
Well if the teacher's
reward is in my fate,

21
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,098
you will surely get your promotion.

22
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,049
Sir if you keep sharing
these wise thoughts..

23
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,058
...Instead of teaching me
how to drive,

24
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,218
I'm never going
to reach the office...

25
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,975
then no promotion, no car.
- Got a girlfriend?

26
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,397
How does it matter?
- What did you say her name was?

27
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,767
Mayera

28
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,526
Put it in self...

29
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,111
Now focus on her,
see her face before your eyes...

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,487
take her name lovingly
and leave the clutch...

31
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,944
Mayera...

32
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,576
Ya baby Mayera
- See the girlfriend's magic!?

33
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,879

<i>The lines of my palm

39
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:38,580
<i>I have a blank sheet in my hands,</i>

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,252
<i>To write whatever I like.</i>

41
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,042
<i>My days will be like this,</i>

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>My friends will be so,</i>

43
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:51,384
<i>Even my God makes all
my wishes come true.</i>

00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>He)! jigida jigida</i>

45
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,308
Hi hotness... is it new?

46
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,268
Zara... you like?

47
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,638
Very hot... Shall I gobble you up?

Ok... See you at lunch.

51
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,050
Today is promotion day right?

52
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,631
So eat in your cubicle.
- Ok

53
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,842
Keep working... look extra busy...

54
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,055
Usual tactics dear...
- Bye bye bye bye

55
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,636
Hello
- Oh sorry...

56
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,347
Bye love you..
- Bye..see ya... Have a good day

57
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,555
Fingers crossed. Bye

58
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,062

<i>The moon revolves</i>

00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,566
<i>around my roof-top.
- We'll get a good bargain sir.</i>

61
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,147
Start with your price,
then come to ours...

62
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,649
That's how we build relationships.

63
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,533
Our horizontals, your verticals...

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,947
Can only integrate them
both with forward planning..

65
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,403
...and long term thinking sir!

66
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,658
Strategise Sir!

74
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,014
<i>And follow my lead.</i>

75
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,307
Congratulations sir,
you made the right decision!

76
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,813
I'm mailing you the contract
right away sir!

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,733
I got it...
I'm a little too cool man...

78
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,117
Hi
- Wassup?

79
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,485
Promotion?

80
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,740
Post lunch

81
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:38,995
Post lunch

82
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,905
Cool

83
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,331
No, no, no, this is not working...

84
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,874
See, over here...

85
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,035
<i>Those better than me,</i>

86
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,166
<i>Try a hundred tricks,</i>

00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,216
<i>But I am not afraid, no way.</i>

<i>If they block my road,</i>

89
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,553
<i>I will jump, I will jolt.</i>

90
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,554
<i>I will get ahead some way.</i>

91
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,977
<i>I will bolt my plans in place,</i>

92
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,020
<i>I will turn the spanner strong,</i>

93
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:08,184
<i>I will tightly screw my victories,</i>

94
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>To the solid ground.</i>

95
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,403
<i>Take away the sky,</i>

96
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,359
<i>I will still ï¬‚y, high...</i>

What a crap raise!

103

Hey what about you?

104
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,552
What a shame
it took them this long..

105
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,508
...now if they'd done
this a year ago..

106
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,844
I'd have easily doubled
productivity by now...

107
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,600
Meet the new Senior Executive,
Marketing and Sales.

108
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,808
Wow! You're really cool bro...

109
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,809
Thanks... thanks guys

110
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,914
Guess what?
- What?

111
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,166
Check this out.

112
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,048
Wow... Gold!
- Guess the credit limit.

113
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,675
Hmmm... two?

114
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,336
Hunh! Three!

What do you think?
- Very hot...

119
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,269
Shall I gobble you up?

120
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,275
It's slightly expensive...

121
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,816
Should I?

122
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,026
Go for it.
- Here you go.

123
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,486
Hang on...

00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,081

00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,007
Why didn't you tell me dear?

130
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,089
Sweetheart... I didn't want
to ruin your excitement...

131
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,761
This is why...
- Your card ma'am.

So where do we go from here?

140
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,534
Back to office

141
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,625
No silly...
we've been together for two years,

142
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,084
now what?

143
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,419
What?... Now?

144
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,214
Papa is looking for proposals...
all multi millionaires.

145
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,506
Hmm...

146
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,752
Multi-millionaire ha!!
Not bad!

147
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,211
Not bad.

148
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,888
Ok, I will say yes
to the richest guy.

149
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,932
Done?
- Done...

150
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,468
Excuse me.

151
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,889
Cheque please...

152
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,936
My turn!!...

153
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,113
Wow!!

154
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,036
Ok Mayera Sehgal,

155
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,959
if I was promoted a year ago,

156
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,411
I would have proposed then

157
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,005
and saved you from
Papa Osama's bombardment

158
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,292
Anyway, now that
I'm a Senior Executive,

159
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,627
So...

160
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,593
Will you marry me?

161
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,929
Yes...

162
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,061
Let me tell papa...

163
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,859
Mention Senior Executive
Mohit Chaddha...

164
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,527
Osama will be impressed...

165
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,025
If you call my dad Osama once more,

166
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,818
I swear I'll mix RDX in your coffee!

167
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,741
Tell him about my car... my car...
- Ok.

168
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,169
Hey, tell him that...
- Shush... ringing...

169
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,093
Hi papa
- Why didn't you call at lunch time?

170
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,381
I was in an important meeting...

171
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,425
I sent you an sms,
you never read them...

172
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,969
Should I read my transfer orders
now, or your messages?

173
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,347
Transfer... Oh no, not again!

174
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,552
Bloody...

175
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,554
Just a month away from retirement...

176
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,774
and they've transferred me
to bloody Animal Husbandry...

177
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,892
Animal what?

178
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,101
Husbandry...

179
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,024
It's under the Ministry
of Agriculture...

180
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,565
isn't there one decent
posting in my fate...

181
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,076
I will resign, today itself...

182
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm going to write such a stinker
of a resignation letter,

183
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,322
It'll shake up the whole
Government... you see...

184
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,624
Like you've sent any
of the resignation letters

185
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,121
that you wrote after
the last six transfers!

186
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,293
Ok!

187
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,162
This time I'll do it!

188
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,998
I'll send in the resignation...
you wait!

189
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,008
Ok bye... bye I love you

190
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,506
Hmm.. so

191
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,796
He's very lumpy yam...

192
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,423
More than normal?

193
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,009
Animal husbandry ya!
Not fair no...

194
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,394
I know, poor animals...

195
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,305
But when he's in a better mood,

196
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,060
you have to come over officially,
to ask for my hand in marriage.

197
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,476
Hello... I'm not coming over
to ask for your hand!

198
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,356
I can't do this please...

199
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,065
Please ask for my hand...
He is old school.

200
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,737
He'll be happy, we'll be happy.

201
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,280
I love you.

202
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,948
You know how to get me
to do everything..

203
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,996
...and anything just
by saying 'I love you'

204
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,873
I love you...
- Ditto.

205
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,493
Gursharan... Dictation...

206
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,798
Sir, dictation...now?

207
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,589
We need to vacate this office
and shift to Animal Husbandry, Sir!

208
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,090
No, first dictation.

209
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,546
Come here.
- Sir!

210
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,348
To the Honourable Cabinet Secretary,

211
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,717
etc etc

212
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,518
Subject... Resignation...

213
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,100
Dear Sir...

214
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,229
Gursharan don't ever
let your son do IAS.

215
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,023
Sir, he's very interested.

216
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,357
He is fully preparing
for the entrance exam...

217
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,109
But he's just twelve...

218
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,158
Sir, only if he starts
now will he be in the IAS.

219
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,239
And he'll keep getting
pushed around like me!

220
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,036
No Sir, my son is very bright,

221
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,080
he will definitely reach the top...

222
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,782
And I'm not bright?

223
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,584
No no...
You are very bright sir,

224
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,127
you are shining bright.

225
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,380
You came fifty eighth in
the All India entrance exam Sir.

226
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,299
Only if there was some smartness

227
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,924
to go with the brightness Sir...

228
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,505
You mean, "fill my pockets then

229
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,557
I will do your work"
kind of brightness...

230
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,265
If I had that I'd have gone
very far, right?

231
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,470
Right...

232
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,680
Wrong Sir...

233
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,689
Filling of pockets very wrong sir.

234
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,732
Hmm...

235
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,436
That's why, I've encouraged
my daughter since nursery

236
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,271
to take up a job
in the private sector...

237
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,866
Mayera's salary at
this point is more than

238
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,784
What I get after thirty-five
years of service...

239
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,907
You write...

240
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,988
Dear sir,
I have to bring to your notice...

241
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,829
Sir one humble opinion sir...
- Yes?

242
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,161
Sir, you're just a month
away from retirement...

243
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,870
Why resign?...

244
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,588
You'll lose your pension sir...

245
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,294
It's just a matter of one month...

246
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,544
But as per your dictation...

247
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,380
What dictation...

248
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,090
Let us shift office...

249
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,387
Let's move to Animal Husbandry...

250
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,142
Shit shit shit, it's ten thirty...

251
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,185
papa's gonna kill me

252
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,311
Listen...

253
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,935
I will come with you,
he wont lose it in front of me...

254
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,316
Really?
- Of course!

255
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,989
Let him just try saying
something to you...

256
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,821
Osama, Obama whatever-
don't worry I'll sort everything...

257
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,322
Of course.

258
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,865
What is he... a dinosaur?

259
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,996
Who sets deadlines these days?

260
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,157
I'm not afraid of anyone, ok!

261
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,413
Mayera...

262
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,045
How many times have I told you...

263
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,463
Sir there's very very
very bad traffic out...

264
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,835
Is anyone talking to you?

265
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,249
No, right?

266
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,422
Who is this?

267
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,048
Mohit Chaddha papa, my friend!

268
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,383
That's me.

269
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,507
He'd got you cake
and wine on New Year's eve...

270
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,053
Come on papa,
he was here on my birthday...

271
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,557
he'd got me those expensive shoes,

272
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,062
and you'd said what kind of
fool gifts shoes on a birthday...

273
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,818
We had a fight over that...

274
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,737
Oh... right... airline boy...

275
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,773
Right... Air Connect...
Junior Ex...

276
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,733
Senior Mayera, Senior...
have you forgotten?

277
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,909
Sorry!

278
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,785
How dare you reprimand my daughter!

279
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,241
Err.. ma'am...

280
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,088
Senior what?
- Sorry?

281
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,335
Senior peon, senior clerk,

282
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,417
senior typist, senior what?

283
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,759
Senior executive sir

284
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,050
So good night Mr. Senior...
it's very late,

285
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm sure you're sleepy too.

286
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,887
No no... Not really sir
Do you like cars sir?

287
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,015
I've bought a new one
...it's automatic

288
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,686
Would you like to check it out?

289
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,972
It's so cool!

290
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,230
Mayera...

291
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,572
Thank you for dropping
my daughter...

292
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,401
Good night...

293
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,828
God damn these executives...

294
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,159
Bloody Osama!

295
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,371
Chill it's me..

296
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,423
Now what?
- I love you

297
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,590
Ditto

298
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,937
Mayeru I love you,
but today is Sunday!

299
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,811
Get up...
we're going on a picnic...

300
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,274
Are you good at Frisbee?

301
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,444
Flush? Three two five?
- Three two what?

302
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,362
Never mind,
it's a card game, I'll teach you...

303
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,156
You reach Humayun's Tomb by ten.

304
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,108
You're wasting my Sunday on a picnic?

305
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,735
No way!

306
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,076
Mohit, papa is in
a good mood after ages...

307
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,657
he's retiring in two days...

308
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,617
God knows how jumpy
he'll be then...

309
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,377
If you want to marry me,

310
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,622
you have to ask for my hand... Ok?

311
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,291
Picnic?!

312
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,051
Ask for my hand...

313
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,973
How can I?
- Go... ask...

314
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,345
Oye Mohit!
- Sir

315
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,844
Give me a hand boy... please
- Coming sir

316
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,141
Just fix this...
- Sir right away...

317
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,308
Hmm that's it. Just press it down.

318
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,768
Trying sir

319
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,199
Bloody Duffer

320
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,410
<i>Mohit...</i>
- <i>Yes Sir!</i>

321
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,738
Once again...

322
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,295
It's just a frog, not a crocodile...

323
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,297
What a coward he is!

324
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,978
Ohh... so nice of you sir.

325
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,312
Mayera ready
- Thank you... welcome...

326
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,064
Ask for my hand...

327
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,812
What are you thinking so much for...

328
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,817
Why aren't you asking?

329
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:39,943
Ask for my hand...

330
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,069
What are you doing?
- I can't do it

331
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,988
Ask for my hand...
- I can't do it

332
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,279
What are you two whispering about...

333
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,576
Are you cheating...you two?

334
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,830
No, no...

335
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,079
I'm telling him,
to ask you for the hand...

336
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,120
Yes yes... he lost the last hand...

337
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,797
ok ask...

338
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,832
Come ask for the hand...

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,884
Sir, I...
I was just wondering that...

340
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,171
Sir I was saying will you please...

341
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,383
Give me the third last card...

342
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,177
Third last...

343
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,934
One, two,

344
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,016
is this it?

345
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,900
<i>Ace... that's an ace...
Ace Mayera...</i>

346
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,486
Oh bloody Ace.
lam not playing this game.

347
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,900
You bloody cheats.

348
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,989
I'm going for a walk..
You bloody cheaters...

349
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,650
All cheaters.
- What's wrong with you...

350
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,985
You just have to ask for my hand.

351
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,403
You can't do this much?

352
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,952
Humayun's wife got this tomb built.

353
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,045
After that Shahjehan got
the same made in white marble...

354
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,342
for his missus, madam Mumtaz.

355
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,590
Taj Mahal, Agra.
- Yes Sir... Agra..

356
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,095
And after the Taj Mahal,

357
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,798
such a grand tomb was never built.

358
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,391
You know why?
- Why?

359
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,016
All the craftsmen
who made the Taj...

360
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,430
you know, the workers...

361
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,932
Shahjehan lined them up,

362
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,017
took out his sword and whack,

363
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,527
cut off their hands...

364
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,487
...I mean it was a mean thing to do

365
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,814
but having said that..
You know I think.

366
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,112
Papa, Mohit wants to marry me...

367
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,452
What?
- Didn't you hear me?

368
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,949
What did you say?

369
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,032
Not me, Mohit... Go ahead Mohit...

370
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,866
Sir... sir I love you

371
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,044
I mean
I love your daughter Mayera

372
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,295
Humayun's tomb or Taj Mahal,

373
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,839
even my love will
stay rock solid like

374
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,666
these monuments for
centuries and centuries...

375
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,300
Sir, you quoted the
hand cutting incident,

376
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,253
but I want to ask for
your daughter's hand Sir...

377
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,054
I want to marry her.

378
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,435
Oh papa... why are you packing up?

379
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,057
We've not even eaten dessert...

380
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,180
Papa makes very good 'halwa'...

381
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,607
Papa... crap...

382
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,816
Papa"- papa wait...

383
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,523
Pick that up...

384
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,399
Papa, Mohit asked you for something,

385
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,117
at least give him an answer...

386
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,031
Mohit come on...

387
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,491
Papa...

388
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,155
Mohit say something!

389
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,908
Sir at least talk to us...

390
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,535
Sir we so coolly asking
you for permission...

391
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,370
others just elope and get married...

392
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,747
Mohit!

393
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,465
You want to marry him... him...

394
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,260
he's talking about eloping...
criminal minded.

395
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,055
Don't even think about it!

396
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,064
The Home Secretary is my batch mate,

397
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,147
the Police Commissioner
of Delhi sends me naughty sms's...

398
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:27,198
I can trap you in such a case,
you'll keep rotting in jail...

399
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,280
Bloody!

400
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,906
Papa

401
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,076
Uday Singh...
- Sir.

402
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,956
Put all this in the car...

403
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,459
and the rest of the stuff from
that boy's hands...

404
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,548
Check everything before we leave...
Come on Mayera...

405
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,667
No... first say yes...

406
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,961
We'll go home and talk please...

407
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,346
Look Mayera, the entire IAS crowd
shows up here to picnic...

408
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,014
if this news spreads
in the ministry...

409
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,975
there will be unnecessary gossip...
So come...

410
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,400
Ok then,
I will never speak to you again.

411
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,904
Mayera!
- Come on Uday Singh.

412
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,151
Sir.

413
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,995
Good girl,
I'll solve all your problems.

414
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,162
Don't worry!

415
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,381
Come on.

416
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,019
What is this? Emotional blackmail?

417
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,821
What emotional blackmail?

418
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,114
It's just saffron chicken biryani,

419
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,614
and then some delicious,
sweet halwa... that's all.

420
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,412
You think you'll make
my favourite dishes

421
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,784
and get me to agree?

422
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,157
Forget it!

423
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,079
Ok..ok...
just enjoy your chicken biryani

424
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,248
and forget that bloody loser.

425
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,250
Papa he's a Senior executive!

426
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,499
So... how does that matter?

427
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,709
A senior executive doesn't
own the company, does he?

428
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,715
How does that matter...
as long as he loves me...

429
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,592
Nothing happens with love...

430
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,891
Love is everything..

431
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,219
If I didn't have your love
after mummy died..

432
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,553
...what would I have done?

433
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,813
Why did you play mummy's role too?

434
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,014
The other IAS daddy's

435
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,605
spent their evenings at
the club with their friends...

436
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,652
but you stayed home
to play with me and my toys.

437
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,148
There was no money, but I had you,

438
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,695
I had your love.

439
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,991
That was enough for me.

440
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,952
Just like Mohit's love
is enough for me.

441
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,496
What more do you need for happiness?

442
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,952
Money! You need money...

443
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,625
And I'm saying this from experience.

444
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,624
Look, I had a government job..

445
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,923
I-A-S, I had a big post
but empty pockets.

446
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,839
All my life I have
been depriving you...

447
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,924
never gave you the pocket money..

448
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,177
Or clothes or toys you deserved...

449
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,596
You wanted to go
to the U.S. for an MBA,

450
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,097
I couldn't even give you that.

451
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,310
But now I'll get you
married to a rich boy

452
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,230
who can make your every
wish come true...

453
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,358
And you'll refuse my biggest wish?

454
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,735
Yes... but Mohit
is an absolute <i>no...</i>

455
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,533
Who's asking you to blindly
get married to just anyone?

456
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,824
I have a whole file,
go ahead and choose yourself,

457
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,624
each one has at least a turn over
of twenty five crores... yes.

458
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,413
Papa... I'm going to marry Mohit!

459
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,417
Fine... then do what you want...

460
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,675
Whether I live, I die, I'm sad,
I'm unhappy, what do you care...

461
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,715
Mohit ya... papa is not
ready to listen at all...

462
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,013
he's being so stubborn!

463
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,118
Fourteenth floor please...

464
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,256
Do you know Mohit Chaddha?

465
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
From marketing?

466
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,178
How is his character?

467
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,471
Mohit sir,
he's always stuck to one madam..

468
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,099
Always stuck to madam?

469
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,064
She comes here too...
no scoop, no scandal.

470
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,100
But why are you enquiring about him?

471
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,068
Survey Family planning!

472
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,781
Mohit Chaddha.
- I was passing by your office...

473
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,699
had some work...
let's have a cup of coffee?

474
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,617
Who the hell are you?

475
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,616
I'm Sehgal...
- Sehgal, who?

476
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,410
Sehgal from Income Tax...

477
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,911
I've come to file a case on you...

478
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,206
Sir but I have filed
all my tax returns...

479
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,665
I'm Mayera's father Sehgal,
you bloody...

480
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,755
I'm calling from
your office reception.

481
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,505
So sorry Sir...
I couldn't recognize your voice,

482
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,636
because I was talking to you
for the first time on the phone...

483
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,055
Sir, you had some work here?

484
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,893
What's your salary?

485
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:08,979
Sir Sixty five thousand.

486
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,139
Sixty five only!

487
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,395
Sir my Hindi counting
is a bit weak... Sir.

488
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,652
Your salary is even weaker...

489
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,902
My daughter, Mayera...
Seventy two...

490
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,200
her salary is seventy
two thousand...

491
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,993
<i>I know Sir... so proud</i> of <i>her...</i>

492
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,411
You know!

493
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,451
What kind of a man are you?

494
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,661
My daughter's salary is more
than yours and you have no problem?

495
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,995
Come on Sir, what problem...

496
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,038
I love her and she loves me...
It's all cool!

497
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,091
Look Mr. sixty five, sit here...

498
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,883
you know that song about
'let the love never be less,

499
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,516
I will take every other loss',
is all nonsense.

500
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,054
I don't know from which
angle you look good to Mayera.

501
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,601
Till I don't give my approval,

502
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,520
Mayera will not marry you.

503
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,984
You know that right?

504
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,696
So your probation, your inquiry
period starts from today...

505
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,908
During this probation,
I will examine your every molecule.

506
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,412
If I don't detect
any problem in you,

507
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,701
I will say yes for the wedding.

508
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,632
But if I find anything
wrong and I reject you,

509
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,839
then I want no
complication from you.

510
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,090
Understand Mr. Sixty five?

511
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,092
Just vanish, quietly...

512
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,882
You ready for it now?

513
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,137
How can I agree, just like that?

514
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,013
You will take the exam
and give the result as well...

515
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,272
I don't think I stand
any chance of passing...

516
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,191
You have no faith in yourself?

517
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,190
I have full faith
in myself... but...

518
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,404
But? You think I'll cheat?

519
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,738
Who knows...

520
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,816
It's not written
on anyone's face, is it?...

521
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,193
Look here you...

522
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,117
I was being polite
and pretending to give you a choice,

523
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,790
actually you have no choice.

524
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,995
If you're ready to go on
probation speak up,

525
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,913
or forget Mayera. Forever.

526
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,375
Bloody fool!
- I am ready Sir.

527
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,627
Sir.

528
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,969
Good.

529
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,590
Mayera was saying
you have no family,

530
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,550
your parents died a long time ago.

531
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,808
Then at least if I reject you,

532
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,022
your family won't be insulted.

533
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,728
Let's go.

534
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,231
Sir, you had come for coffee..
we serve some awesome capp...

535
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
Another thing,

536
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,565
if you're not interested in sports,
then get interested...

537
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,407
Sports is my middle name sir.

538
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,530
TT, Tennis, squash.. anything.

539
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,455
Squash?!
<i>'</i> squash!

540
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,414
Listen... Papa hates to lose...

541
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,625
he will never let me get married
to a man who defeats him...

542
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,006
He's testing me. if I play badly...

543
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,556
Trust me Mohit. If you win today
you will lose forever.

544
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,426
Hey, come on...

545
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,935
Best of luck

546
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,154
Ready?

547
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,337
Oh no...

548
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,430
Go go Mohit

549
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,854
Shot!

550
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,355
Go papa!

551
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,275
Poor guy...

552
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,777
Service!

553
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,538
The ball has to be
picked up like this...

554
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,094
Game!

555
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,638
Well done...

556
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,802

557
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,303
Well played sir good one.

558
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,017
How were you Playing!?
' super PaPa super!

559
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,266
I beat you in three straight games.

560
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,310
Sports is my middle name.

561
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,644
You lied, right?

562
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,893
I hate lies. Ask Mayera.

563
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,148
Papa hates lies.

564
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,317
Where did you find this guy?

565
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,319
There are at least seven
boys in my file

566
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,401
who've played
national level football,

567
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,861
Badminton, tennis and cricket!

568
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,033
Papa please.

569
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,489
You are hopeless yes, hopeless!

570
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,745
Absolutely hopeless. Miserable.

571
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,743
You must practice with me, daily.

572
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,581
Chances are slim but
if there is some improvement,

573
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,840
we will see.
Tomorrow same time, here.

574
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,667
Sir tomorrow I have...
- Tomorrow what?

575
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,928
He'll come papa... he'll come.

576
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,343
Hmmm...

577
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,009
Get my kit,
I'm going to the locker room.

578
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,805
Oh god!

579
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,139
I am telling you...

580
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,641
I'm not going to leave you,

581
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,392
whatever he might do.
Your Papa Osama!

582
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,067
Oh yeah!?

583
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,318
What?
The staff has called me... why?

584
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,526
Please just come...
- Sir..

585
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,033
...a small farewell
gift from all of us.

586
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,455
Oh, what was the need for this...

587
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,658
Sir it's just a little something..
- Gursharan..

588
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,413
...oh... thank you so much

589
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,789
Please open it sir, open it...

590
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,121
Ok...

591
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,169
Just a minute sir..

592
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,254
Here it is!

593
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,131
What is this?

594
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,506
Sir, your retired life
begins tomorrow,

595
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,008
right?
<i>'</i> $0?

596
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,684
You wont be going out as much,

597
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,683
your movement will
be quite restricted sir...

598
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,561
So?
- This is for your fitness.

599
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,358
It helped me a lot...

600
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,396
one, two and three...

601
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,278
Amazing isn't it Sir?

602
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,201
Th th th thank you...

603
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,992
P p p please stop this...
- Welcome Sir, welcome!

604
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,534
It's a strange gift..

605
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,749
But the entire staff
got together for it.

606
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,536
Now I must get them something
in return, shouldn't I?

607
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,879
Sir, including the peons..

608
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,548
There are seventeen
staff members...

609
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,333
How will you get
something for everyone?

610
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,469
Lets get one thing
that is of use to everyone!

611
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,054
How may I help you sir?

612
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,219
These seem very big and expensive,

613
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,223
can you show us a medium sized TV?

614
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,846
Sure sir... This way

615
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,474
Sir, are you looking
for a specific brand?

616
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,067
Something cheap,
charming and long-lasting...

617
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,234
Breaking news.

618
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,480
The turbulence in the Airline
Industry has grounded many...

619
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,236
Sir this is our
smallest 22 inch LCD...

620
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,404
Increase the volume please...

621
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,906
For the last two years,
airline companies have been bearing

622
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,034
the brunt of the unreliable markets.

623
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,536
But Air Connect is
the first company that

624
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,290
has ousted 1200 employees at one go.

625
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,958
That's right, 1200!

626
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,665
Cabin crew, technical, ground,

627
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,625
marketing staff included.

628
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,006
Marketing!

629
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,892
She's not answering her phone...

630
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,060
Neither is Mohit...

631
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,937
Gursharan, Mohit's job is gone!

632
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,398
Congratulations Sir.
- Thank you,

633
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,732
and congratulations to you too...

634
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,735
This will be your apartment,
sea facing,

635
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,910
on the Dubai Marina...

636
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,579
One of the most posh
localities in Dubai.

637
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,701
It has four bedrooms...

638
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,781
Look at the kitchen...

639
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,787
Look at this.

640
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,539
Rent is totally paid by the company,

641
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,168
plus double salary.

642
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,628
Mind you in UAE dirham
and overseas perks...

643
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,716
Sir, what if I say no?

644
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,134
I'll send you to a mental asylum.

645
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,463
Sir I'm going to get married...

646
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,173
Oh wow, really? Mohit?

647
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,220
Yeah.

648
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,594
Well I didn't think you would
refuse such a great offer,

649
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,802
to get married.

650
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,771
Sir we love each other,
we can't stay apart.

651
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,607
I am really sorry Sir. Thank you.

652
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,356
Wait, don't you want to see
what car they're offering you?

653
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,938
Sir I am really Sorry... but

654
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,365
Yeah

655
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,536
Your papa is here?

656
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,037
Papa?

657
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,949
Papa!

658
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,627
Mayeru!

659
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,581
Mayeru? Are you feeling Ok?

660
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,961
Are you ok?

661
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,592
I'm ok.

662
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,212
Mohit has lost his
job and you're ok?

663
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,759
Mohit lost his job?

664
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,006
Didn't you watch the news?

665
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,268
If a big company like Air
Connect couldn't save its employees,

666
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,103
then what about the smaller ones?

667
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,600
Demands for safe and secure jobs

668
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,314
in the Government
are increasing...

669
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:36,278
Applications for Civil Services
entrance exams have risen by 21%...

670
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,773
In these tough times of recession,
private company jobs are...

671
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:49,617
When he had a job,
I was willing to compromise.

672
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,954
But I will die before I
let you marry a jobless man...

673
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,962
Please understand this...

674
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,795
It's over!
- Mohit

675
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,006
Hey Mayera, lmmy here...

676
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,134
Mohit, you haven't
lost your job have you?

677
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,133
Hey... this is lmmy!

678
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,805
Tell me seriously

679
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,096
Honestly ya, I'm lmmy speaking.

680
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,806
Mohit has gone to
fight with the boss,

681
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,228
he left his phone behind.

682
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,767
So everything is safe?

683
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,821
Yes, my job is safe...
but Mohit's is gone...

684
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:19,987
What?

685
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,194
See I told you... I told you

686
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,576
Thank God.

687
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,741
I'm so relieved
that your job is safe.

688
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,619
I know ya,
but really sad about Mohit...

689
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,991
Even papa was so worried.

690
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,918
He came to my office!
He's right here.

691
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,291
Mayera are you okay?

692
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,338
Okay bye. I Love you.

693
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,838
Papa please go home and rest now.

694
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,049
I have to attend
a very important meeting.

695
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,676
Papa, Mohit has not lost his job

696
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,007
and neither will he ever lose it.

697
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,559
We will get married
and he will be very successful.

698
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,728
Ok come on. Bye.

699
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,181
No... look..
- Bye.

700
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,479
I heard them say myself...
all the marketing guys"

701
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,276
listen... marketing...

702
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,770
Oh God!

703
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,950
Look I'm sorry about this.

704
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,527
But I was just promoted!

705
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,160
What can I say Mohit.

706
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,582
The salary you get after promotion
can save the jobs of three people.

707
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,331
I don't know... consider this
a sacrifice for your juniors.

708
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,957
Why don't you sacrifice?

709
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,090
Your salary could save
the jobs of at least eight people.

710
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,417
People who don't know anything
about Operations,

711
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,672
shouldn't be sitting tight as CEOs!

712
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,129
Just watch it Mohit...
there's no need to be rude!

713
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,047
If I'd been allowed
to run Air Connect,

714
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,928
I wouldn't let the company even
in this time of recession

715
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,429
lose a single penny...

716
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,890
In fact I was going to quit myself...

717
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,263
because you guys don't deserve me.

718
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,188
What?

719
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,606
I am too good for you...

720
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,103
bunch of idiots!

721
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,561
How dare you call me an idiot!

722
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,988
Like this...
I'll get a job like <i>this...</i>

723
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,361
Double salary... mark my words.

724
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,700
Mohit you better come
back and say sorry...

725
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,948
Mohit!

726
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,696
Mohit relax...
don't get so agitated.

727
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,531
What did she say?
- What will she say?

728
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,033
You say thank you to me,
I've saved your job.

729
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,037
How did you?

730
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,584
I was promoted, I was sacked...

731
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,786
If you'd been promoted,
you'd have gone!

732
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,504
Thanks bro...
- Come on, buy me a beer.

733
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,546
No beer right now.

734
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,794
Stay with everyone, shout slogans,

735
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,126
what if they are pressured
into withdrawing the orders...

736
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,341
Why don't you say sorry to the boss?

737
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,096
I've never said sorry
to anyone in my life,

738
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,181
why should I say it to this moron?!
C'mon, buy me a beer.

739
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,515
Okay, okay, don't say sorry...

740
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,717
But the media is
very hot right now...

741
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,769
news channels are gathering here...

742
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,973
at least give interviews, get famous
and I'll check out the girls.

743
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:23,271
We want our jobs back...

744
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:28,195
We're telecasting from outside
the Air Connect offices...

745
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,905
give us our jobs back...
- People are really worried,

746
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,955
and here with me
is Mr lmran Rizvi...

747
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,408
Mr lmran Rizvi,
how are you feeling?

748
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,623
Very bad...
- Can you tell us in detail...

749
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,541
How did you feel
when you lost your job?

750
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,664
I haven't lost my job,
my job is safe...

751
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,999
Stop stop...

752
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,551
If you haven't lost your job then
why are you giving this interview?

753
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,175
Because my friend here
lost his job...

754
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,765
How are you feeling?

755
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,763
Scared...
- I am sorry, what was that?

756
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,972
He says he's scared...

757
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,937
Scared... what are you scared of?

758
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,523
For Mayera...
- Mayera... Mayera your sister...

759
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,026
who will commit suicide
if she doesn't get married, right?

760
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,195
If you use even one shot of his,
I will sue you...

761
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,485
come away from here...

762
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,243
What did you say your name was...

763
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,208
Why were you giving an interview?

764
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,668
Everyone was...

765
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,294
ls everyone getting married?

766
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,788
Is everyone's father my papa?

767
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,169
With such difficulty I've convinced
him that your job is safe...

768
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,125
if he sees this interview,
he will never let us be married...

769
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,710
So let him not ya...

770
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,968
I'm fed up of his
terms and conditions...

771
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,090
There's a world economic crisis on,

772
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,848
the recession has killed
the airlines industry,

773
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,516
the company I work
for is bankrupt today...

774
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,483
Mayera, I'm jobless...

775
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,150
and you're worried about
the lie you've told your father!

776
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,626
Mohit... please don't panic.

777
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,415
You're so smart...

778
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,713
You'll get a job immediately.

779
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,092
But one lie will
save our relationship.

780
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:22,348
To hide one lie,
one has to tell a hundred others...

781
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,358
I know

782
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,702
Come on, let's get out of here.

783
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,582
Hello... I'd like to speak to..

784

788
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,845
Hey Khattar. VK speaking...

789
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:54,925
How're you doing?

790
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,096
Ok listen.

791
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,511
I have a favour to ask...

792
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,259
I need you to
investigate a guy...

793
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,559
write the name down...

794
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,264
Mohit Chaddha,

795
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,223
Yes Mohit Chadha.

796
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,356
Murder, rape, robbery, molesting,

797
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:13,157
eve teasing, rioting,
sending dirty texts...

798
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,111
Or any other public of fence
or criminal activity...

799
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,154
Please report to me...

800
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,864
It's a matter of
life and death for me.

801
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,588
Hello, yes sir?

802
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,666
Where are you?
- At the office.

803
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,922
Whose office?

804
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,673
Sir, my office.

805
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,171
Then why are you whispering?

806
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,801
Sir I'm in a meeting,
shall I call you back?

807
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,924
I'm retired, not useless...

808
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,056
You think I have
nothing better to do?

809
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,430
I'm a busy man, I have no time...

810
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,397
Ok, do one thing.

811
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,774
Give me your Pan Card number.

812
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,561
Sir why do you want
my Pan Card number?

813
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,028
Why?

814
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,898
If you want to marry my daughter,

815
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,653
I have full right to ask
for your Pan Card number.

816
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,287
And if you don't
have a Pan Card number,

817
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,874
you have no right to marry
my daughter... do you understand?

818
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,542
No, no Sir...
I'll give you my Pan Card number...

819
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,744
I'm giving you my Pan Card number.

822
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,881
and most importantly
your Identity Card number...

823
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,133
I want it all! Got it?
- Yes sir

824
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,473
Ok, now bring the photocopies
of all documents

825
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,016
...to the gymkhana this evening.

826
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,436
And remember,
without document verification,

827
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,355
the marriage is cancelled.

828
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,985
Mr Chaddha... you may please go in.
- Yeah.

829
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,777
Trainee! Are you serious?

830
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,320
Sir I was a senior
executive at Air Connect.

831
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,193
And they fired you.

832
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,203
I'm at least giving
you a trainee's position

833
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,659
and you are not even thankful.

834
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,989
Oh, thank you so much sir.

835
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,533
I think I deserve much better.

836
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,995
Where will you find something
better in this worst-case scenario?

837
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,586
I will, I will get much better...

838

What's wrong with selling lingerie?

00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,829
<i>And if it's on sale.</i>

893
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,789
<i>We will not leave
the moon and stars,</i>

894
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,499
<i>We will buy them without fail.</i>

895
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,177
We make sense of nonsense.

896
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,928
<i>We laugh at our sorrows.</i>

897
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,602
<i>We are not alone in this game,</i>

898
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:57,183
<i>The whole world is playing,
just the same.</i>

899
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,690
<i>Our pockets are
filled with good times...</i>

900
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,363
<i>Our only wealth, good times...</i>

901
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,069
<i>They strut, they shine, good times...</i>

902
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,701
<i>They fly in style, good times...</i>

903
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,410
<i>Good times, they fly...</i>

904
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:49,196
<i>Why should we think of tomorrow,
today?</i>

905
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,322
<i>This moment is enough to live in.</i>

906
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,124
<i>That which we have
not seen ourselves,</i>

907
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,921
<i>Why should we believe in?</i>

908
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,622
<i>Not years,</i>

909
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,503
<i>Things happen in a moment...</i>

910
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,303
<i>Like noodles, everything is instant.</i>

911
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,095
<i>Joys are momentary...</i>

912
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,014
<i>They are transitory...</i>

913
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,140
<i>All you have to do
is ask and you get them-</i>

914
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,147
<i>Our pockets are
filled with good times...</i>

915
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,818
<i>Our only wealth, good times...</i>

916
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,443
<i>They strut, they shine, good times...</i>

917
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,026
<i>They fly in style, good times...</i>

918
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,831
<i>Good times, they fly...</i>

919
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,304
Mr. Chaddha!
You may Please go in

920
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,105

924
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,031

Alright, listen up guys...

Mohit's dad-in-law
is coming to office.

928
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,704
So just pretend like
Mohit still works here. Ok?

929
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,664
Ok?
- Ok

930
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,253
Nice!

931
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,802
C'mon move ahead...

932
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,805
Is it your father's wedding...
Yes, move it back...

933
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,282
Come on! Move the car!

934
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,151
Move a little ahead.

935
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,529
What's going on man?
- Don't know man...

936
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,366
What's going on?

937
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,370
Oh... aunty..what is this...

938
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,038

939
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:12,919
Brother, please...

940
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,549
Mohit Chaddha, 14th floor...

941
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,715
Thank you
- Yes Sir...

942
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:19,892
God...

943
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,224
Get to the side...

944
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,560
Move on...
What are you fighting over?

945
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,603
Will you take me?

946
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,896
I'm dead!

947
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:30,986
Hello sir.

948
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,817
14th floor, please.

949
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,196
People came, people left...

950
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,448
But Mohit sir stayed
strong in his seat...

951
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,121
Hello sir.. how are you?

952
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,333
Who are you?

953
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,337
Sir I'm Mohit's best friend lmmy...

954
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,758
OK..OK...
- Ya ya...

955
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,252
Mohit's cabin is that way...
- Sir not that way...

956
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,178
sir coffee is this way...

957
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,718
Sir lunch plan?

958
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:02,552
Son in law,

959
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,478
The mad... the mad...

960
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,268
the mad son in law...

961
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,228
Oh my God!

962
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:10,813
Isn't it funny?

963
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,151
Sir, the boss has
called for Mohit...

964
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,445
Why don't you come to my cubicle...

965
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,238
Sir you like Chinese food?

966
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,783
Going somewhere Mohit...

967
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,288
or have you come to apologize?

968
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,125
Mohit's cabin was somewhere here...
- It's on the other side!

969
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,623
No, it's there...

970
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,457
Yes, this is it...

971
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,130
And you're here too...
- I am here...

972
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,631
Good job lmmy...

973
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,054
I will surely recommend
your name for a promotion...

974
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,885
Aah... No... no promotion.

975
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,553
I'm very happy in my cubicle.

976
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,055
Ok bye, see you. Bye.

977
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,562
Very irritating man...

978
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,973
I have to talk to you... come in...
- Sir over lunch?

979
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,350
Lunch?
- Ya

980
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,066
Good idea... come on, lead the way.

981
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,354
After you, please sir.

982
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,076
You have been fined
three times for driving of fences,

983
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,871
once for breaking a signal...

984
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,117
and you always file your
IT returns after the due date.

985
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,631
Your US visa was refused
after the first attempt...

986
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,171
I'm sure something is wrong
with you only...

987
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,419
Otherwise one gets
it in the first attempt...

988
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,218
The detailed inquiry is in this...

989
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:26,394
RTO file, Income Tax,
Police inquiry, passport office.

990
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,058
So many criminal cases.

991
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,686
How can I marry my daughter to you?

992
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,611
Sir, you did this
research all on your own?

993
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:40,780
Obviously, it's a confidential
matter... what if it gets leaked?

994
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,986
You are so cool Sir!

995
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,207
Excuse me sir, but how
did the government let you go...

996
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,743
How could they retire you,
seriously...

997
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,166
It's a rule, retirement at sixty.

998
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,963
It's a damn useless rule sir.

999
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,879
At sixty a guy comes into his own.

1000
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,967
There's a job opening
in our company,

1001
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,719
General Manager
Research and Analysis,

1002
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,047
age limit is seventy...

1003
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,090
Seventy?
- Salary, three lakhs...

1004
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,050
Teen lakh per annum?! Good

1005
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,886
Spoken just like
a government official.

1006
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,972
Three lakhs per month sir,
per month.

1007
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,564
Three lakhs rupees per month..
- Ya.

1008
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,153
Your bill sir
- Thanks

1009
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,692
Let me..
- I insist sir.

1010
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,360
Sure... okay

1011
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,531
Sir you are an unutilised
resource of this country...

1012
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,614
You are wasting the talent
and knowledge of V K Sehgal.

1013
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,623
Sir, guide youngsters like me,

1014
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,038
India needs you Sir...

1015
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,249
You can win the Padma Shri,
the Padma Vibhushan.

1016
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,754
You could get an Oscar...

1017
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,208
I mean you can definitely
get Bharat Ratna...

1018
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,051
Difficult to get the Arjun Award
by merely playing squash sir...

1019
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:46,428
Yes... I'm not going
to sit idle at home...

1020
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,727
I get many job offers, many...

1021
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,637
I have to take care
of something important,

1022
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,393
then I will think about my job.

1023
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,058
I'll think about it.

1024
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,397
Sorry sir your card
has been declined.

1025
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,359
What... something must be wrong

1026
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,405
with your machine, try again...

1027
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:02,903
Sir you must go for it.

1028
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,108
Sir the machine is fine,

1029
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,693
the transaction
is not being approved.

1030
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,737
Let me pay, I have my card.

1031
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,322
No no Sir, I have cash...

1032
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,585
No sir, I don't have cash.

1033
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,582
No cash...

1034
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,413

why you creating a scene...

1035
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,338

1036
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,423
Sir, only two thousand
rupees more...

1037
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,499
I will just withdraw it
from the ATM and give it to you.

1038
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,677
Two thousand... here it is.

1039
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,924
Thank you sir.

1040
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,216
Sir who keeps
so much cash nowadays?

1041
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,055
How can Mayera be the
daughter of this terrorist?

1042
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,603
Always ready to drop a bomb!

1043
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,232
What?

1044
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,696
Shit!

1045
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,098
I don't know sir...
My credit card is not working...

1046
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,050
ATM card is not working...

1047
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,343
lam going to bloody
change my bank...

1048
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,768
What bank is your account in?

1049
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,147
That means you
didn't get the money?

1050
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,308
No...

1051
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,935
Are you bankrupt?

1052
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,362
Ha ha... so funny sir...

1053
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,939
what a thing to say...
Not bankrupt sir...

1054
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,399

00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:29,364
This matter of of fences is pending.

1056

Of course...

1057
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,998
Squash at the club, this evening...

1058
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,534
You better.

1059
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,045
Hello...

1060
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,093

00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,349
I'm telling you I will...
Or else what?

1065
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,394
You'll take the car away?

1066
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,813
Take away your damn car then!

1067
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,684
Hello Mayera...

1068
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,395
Busy or what?

1069
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,694
Nothing ya, just needed some help...

1070
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,872
Here
- How much is it?

1071
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,245
Fifty thousand.

1072
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,212
I had asked for forty no?

1073
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,290
Extra ten.. Pocket money.
- What pocket money?

1074
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,000
Am I a kid to be given pocket money?

1075
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,964
Of course you're a kid!

1076
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,387
All your money is over
and you didn't even know?

1077
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,174
Listen, you should
maintain detailed accounts,

1078
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,017
I will check at
the end of each month.

1079
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,643
What do you mean by every month?

1080
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,347
You mean I'm such a big idiot

1081
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,977
that I won't find a job for months?

1082
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,726
If you're stuck on airlines,
then you surely won't get a job...

1083
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,941
I have mailed you a new job list.

1084
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,980
The Inner Beauty position
is still available.

1085
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,032
If you get the job,
I will get free lingerie.

1086
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,027
This is like saying
if I became a waiter,

1087
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,578
you'll get free food...

1088
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,989
So Mayera ma'am,
what would you like to order today?

1089
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,408
On today's menu
we have plain paratha,

1090
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,582
plain butter paratha,
plain ghee paratha,

1091
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,872
aaloo paratha, aloo butter paratha,

1092
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,918
aloo ghee paratha, gobhi paratha,

1093
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,041
gobhi butter paratha,
gobhi ghee paratha..

1094
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,713
Today's special is
mix vegetable paratha.

1095
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,256
Shut up you clown!

1096
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,133
I've left my meeting half way...
I have to <i>go...</i>

1097
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,425
Ok bye!

1098
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,180
Mayera!

1099
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,060
What?

1100
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,522
What if I really become a waiter?

1101
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,942
<i>Standing at the cross-roads,</i>

1102
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,485
Will you marry a waiter?

1103
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,609
<i>When someone asks a question.</i>

1104
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,444
<i>You won't become a waiter.
- Why do all answers,</i>

1105
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,575
<i>You never know...
- Seem unreliable.</i>

1106
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,076
What if I have to?

1107
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,202
<i>Nothing seems real</i>

1108
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,874
Even then I'll marry you...

1109
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,713
Now I really have
to get to work, ok...

1110
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,671
<i>On these crossroads</i>

1111
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,718
I love you

1112
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:57,127
<i>Except an imaginary indifference.</i>

1113
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,572
Papa. Papa
- I am so sorry sir

1114
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,032
Are you ok?
- Papa are you okay?

1115
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,072
Yes I am
Yes darling I am ok.

1116
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:42,492
So ironical that you want
to marry the man..

1117
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,122
...who wants to make you an orphan!

1118
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,199
How wonderful is that?

1119
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,034
Papa, don't over react...
please go and change, come on...

1120
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,164
I am sorry sir!

1121
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,289
No problem,
sports is your middle name huh?

1122
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,213
Taking out your
frustrations on the ball?

1123
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,920
I have tried all the
companies on your list,

1124
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,931
looks like I'll have
to become a waiter after all.

1125
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,550
Your girlfriend is too good...

1126
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,510
I've already made a new list.

1127
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,478
Go and change now...

1128
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,814
Listen,

1129
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,350
what is this 'new job' tune that
you're teaching papa to sing?

1130
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,105
"I'll take on a job,
I'll take on a job",

1131
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,607
he keeps saying excitedly.

1132
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,480
I've shut him up.

1133
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,862
He's worked hard enough
for the last 35 years,

1134
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,909
from home to office and back again.

1135
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,326
He's worked very hard
all his life...

1136
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,029
It's his time to relax now.

1137
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,414
Why does he need to work anymore?

1138
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,207
I can take care of him.

1139
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,044
Don't hoist him again on the
'three lakh pay-package tower'

1140
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,750
Ok, promise?

1141
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,293
Ok...in any case,
who's going to hire him?

1142
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,590
Very funny!

1143
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,345
Mohit... Hey Mohit
- Sir...

1144
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,297
I'm ready for a new job.

1145
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,095
Sir Mayera has forbidden it.

1146
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,558
Who's going to tell her?

1147
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,557
You frighten me all the time,
and now you'll lie yourself?

1148
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,014
Nobody is going to lie, you fool...

1149
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,225
When I get the job,
we'll tell Mayera.

1150
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,605
Till then start job hunting for me.

1151
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:55,652
Why should I?

1152
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,988
Because it was your idea,
you will do it.

1153
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,365
No sir, I won't do it.
Mayera has categorically said no...

1154
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,027
OK, then the wedding is cancelled.

1155
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,828
Go shower bloody...

1156
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,034
Osama!

1157
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,336
Hey Mohit.

1158
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,047
Let's send the application
by registered post.

1159
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,795
Post is so uncool.

1160
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,010
You'll never get a job if you send
a letter in this day and age.

1161
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,466
Email sir, email.

1162
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,061
Actually, the real problem is that
I don't know how to use a laptop.

1163
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,816
Not a big deal sir,
it works just like a computer.

1164
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,773
I don't even know how
to use computers!

1165
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:40,231
You don't know to use the computer?

1166
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,732
I don't Ok...

1167
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,492
Do you know to make chicken biryani?

1168
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,945
You don't, right? Similarly
I don't know computers, that's it!

1169
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,280
Oh Sir...

1170
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,701
Then for you Sir,
we'll have to look for one...

1171
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,032
that even a fool can use.

1172
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,455
You called me a fool?

1173
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,036
You bloody fool!

1174
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,291
Mayera!
- Where?

1175
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,292
Hello...

1176
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,417
Yes, actually I'm in a meeting.

1177
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,168
Yes in an interview...

1178
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:02,969
Baby just listen...

1179
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,092
I'll just call you back. Ok.

1180
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,639
Love you. Bye.

1181
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,766
Ok...You stop the car here.
Right here.

1182
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,427
Sir here?
- I'm telling you, stop the car.

1183
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,637
The house is ahead...
- You argue too much man...

1184
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,597
Sir but why?
- Again why!

1185
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:18,606
Do one thing-jump the wall,
then hide and cross the garden...

1186
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,531
Yes hide, and come in
through my bedroom window.

1187
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,903
Sir isn't this story absurd...

1188
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,027
Romeo hides from Juliet's
father and goes to meet her.

1189
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,953
He doesn't hide form
Juliet to go meet her father.

1190
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,912
Does Radha work in Juliet's house?
- No!

1191
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,955
Radha will see Romeo,
she'll inform Juliet,

1192
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,206
Juliet will ask her father

1193
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,162
'what was Romeo doing with you,
out of office,

1194
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,963
in the middle of the afternoon'?

1195
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,374
That's correct logic!

1196
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,583
So do it.
- Yeah.

1197
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,762
Let me send Radha
out for some work...

1198
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,547
Then I'll signal you to come inside.

1199
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,969
Got it Commando?

1200
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,846
Aye Aye Captain!
<i>'</i> Roger!

1201
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,259
Bloody hell.

1202
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,728
Radha, Radha!
- Yes papaji

1203
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,105
Come here...

1204
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,279
A few of my shirts and trousers
are lying outside the cupboard,

1205
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,570
take them to the washerwoman
and get them ironed nicely.

1206
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,903
And don't come back till they're
all done, even if takes an hour.

1207
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,283
But Shah Rukh's film on TV...

1208
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,955
Hey, don't talk nonsense with me...

1209
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,575
till the job is not done,
stay with the washerwoman.

1210
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,213
What can I say...
I'm missing the film...

1211
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,086
There's always <i>so</i>
much work around here...

1212
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,380
Have you seen it?
- Not yet, I'm not that lucky...

1213
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,757
Oh, you haven't?

1214
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,922
I'm crazy about Shah Rukh...

1215
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,515
But ever since papaji has retired,

1216
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,600
he just doesn't let
go off the remote control...

1217
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,095
Bloody duffer!

1218
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,179
<i>HEY</i>

1219
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,398
Hey lovebirds!

1220
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,645
Hi
- Hi

1221
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,234
Are we the love-birds
or are you guys the love-birds?

1222
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,145
Immy's record-breaking
relationship...

1223
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,481
Two months and still
going strong, yes?

1224
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,027
Yes...

1225
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:49,993
Just when Mohit lost his job,
Swati came into my life...

1226
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,662
What? Now everything will
be with reference to my job?

1227
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,161
Before Mohit's job...
After Mohit's job?

1228
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,084
Bad mood huh?
Come on show us your dimples man...

1229
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,828
C'mon show us...

1230
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,748
Hmmm...very bad mood.

1231
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,551
lmmy let's go dance!

1232
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,677
One Long Island ice
tea and one rum-n-coke.

1233
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,140
No rum-n-coke.

1234
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,842
Yes rum-n-coke.

1235
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,514
I'm on antibiotics...

1236
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,057
Do you have the flu?

1237
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,855
Best medicine, Rum n Coke!

1238
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,186
One Rum n Coke please.

1239
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:21,934
Sir, if my girlfriend
would tell me so lovingly...

1240
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,189
What would you do huh?

1241
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,778
Shower in Rum and Coke?

1242
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,280
Go, shower...

1243
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,613
You just...make your drinks...

1244
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,121
Mohit... I'm paying...

1245
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,666
Why do you keep ranting
about paying all the time?

1246
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,493
I don't want it, that's it!

1247
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,953
Is there some compulsion?

1248
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,802
Ok, no compulsions...sorry.

1249
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,225
I am sorry.

1250
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,353
<i>HEY</i>

1251
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,144
lam sorry dude!

1252
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,613
Hey listen...we both are going
for the rock show on 25th, ok?

1253
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,191
But aren't the tickets for Rs 5000?
- No if's and but's...

1254
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,027
I'll pay right now, you can return
the money when you find a job!

1255
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,034
By then I'll be a bus conductor...

1256
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,288
Better if you take someone else.

1257
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,620
If you'll be a bus conductor,
then I'll become the bus driver.

1258
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,794
And I'll kidnap you
and your bus forever.

1259
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:25,835
And what if I become
an ice-cream seller?

1260
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,632
Then I'll buy the van...

1261
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,631
And I'll gobble up
all the ice-cream, and you!

1262
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,129
Look, it's my job to gobble up...

1263
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,340
And what if I end up as
an auto-rickshaw driver?

1264
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,349
Then I'll be the traffic cop...

1265
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:40,012
I'll cut you a ticket
and lock you up in my jail for life.

1266
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,975
Ok...And what if I land up
being a postman?

1267
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:51,278
<i>Needlessly, you make and break.</i>

1268
01:00:51,940 --> 01:01:00,041
<i>Needlessly, you count each penny.</i>

1269
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:10,343
<i>Needlessly you're afraid of love.</i>

1270
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:15,876
<i>Needlessly you push me honey.</i>

1271
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,323
<i>Needlessly, you make and break.</i>

1272
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,026
<i>Needlessly, you count each penny.</i>

1273
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,703
<i>Needlessly you're afraid of love.</i>

1274
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,406
<i>Needlessly you push me honey.</i>

1275
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,787
<i>I'm the heroine of your every story.</i>

1276
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,087
<i>I'm the happy ending
of your every tale.</i>

1277
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,510
<i>When the storm came,</i>

1278
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:54,837
<i>You packed up your things,</i>

1279
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,139
<i>You emptied my heart and left.</i>

1280
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,682
<i>If I couldn't pay the rent,</i>

1281
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,009
<i>Of your heart my love,</i>

1282
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,473
<i>You would throw me out instead.</i>

1283
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,055
<i>Hey, I made a promise for life,</i>

1284
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,766
<i>When the deal was made.</i>

1285
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,648
<i>But my pockets are empty,
how can I repay</i>

1286
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,355
<i>This debt that I have raised!</i>

1287
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:18,444
<i>I will stake my claim
and take you home.</i>

1288
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:24,033
<i>First let me prove my worth,
my love.</i>

1289
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,793
<i>Needlessly,
you make promises of love...</i>

1290
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,417
<i>Needlessly, you raise your hopes.</i>

1291
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,999
<i>Needlessly you dream crazy girl,</i>

1292
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,759
<i>Needlessly, our story's done.</i>

1293
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,087
<i>I'm the heroine of your every story.</i>

1294
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,094
<i>I'm the happy ending
of your every tale.</i>

1295
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,399
<i>If you were booze,</i>

1296
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,825
<i>I'd knock you down.</i>

1297
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,655
<i>I'd make myself your addiction.</i>

1298
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:05,198
<i>I'd be that cloud,</i>

1299
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,534
<i>That stayed with you,</i>

1300
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:10,416
<i>If you became my sky!</i>

1301
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,799
<i>Sweet to the ears,</i>

1302
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,876
<i>Not easy to do.</i>

1303
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:20,055
<i>To color yourself in another hue.</i>

1304
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,474
<i>Not easy to do.</i>

1305
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,055
<i>Colors fade,</i>

1306
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:28,014
<i>Just love remains,</i>

1307
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,773
<i>Everyone else changes-</i>

1308
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,523
<i>Red orange yellow blue and green.</i>

1309
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,070
<i>Needlessly,
you make promises of love...</i>

1310
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,774
<i>Needlessly, you raise your hopes.</i>

1311
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,406
<i>Needlessly you dream crazy girl,</i>

1312
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,112
<i>Needlessly our story's done.</i>

1313
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,493
<i>I'm the heroine of your every story.</i>

1314
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,417
<i>I'm the happy ending
of your every tale.</i>

1315
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,085
<i>Needlessly...</i>

1316
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,880
<i>Needlessly...</i>

1317
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,416
<i>Needlessly...</i>

1318
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,336
<i>Needlessly...</i>

1319
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,506
<i>I'm the heroine of your every story.</i>

1320
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,934
<i>I'm the happy ending
of your every tale.</i>

1321
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,416
Not bad Sehgal Sir...

1322
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,585
You must've thought
of an email ID...

1323
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,299
Vinod Kumar Sehgal.

1324
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,467
No No its too long?

1325
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,761
How about...VK Sehgal?

1326
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,390
SehgalVK ...sounds cool!

1327
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,141

1332
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,182


1333
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,315
Wow so many jobs?

1334
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,071
Yes, but around 80% are useless...

1335
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,652
What is this now?

1336
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,369
It's a game... just...

1337
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,037
Video game?!

1338
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,448
Move then... move, move...

01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,767

You come here every
other day under..

1347
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,812
The pretext of
a client meeting, right

1348
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,359
Ok then, I won't come from tomorrow.

1349
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,563
No no...l was just asking...

1350
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,273
My job shouldn't create
problems for your job.

1351
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,693
My job---...

1352
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,489
Nothing will happen. Don't worry.

1353
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,997
Radha!

1354
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,333
Come on, come on and take your coat.

1355
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,077
Coming, coming...have patience!

1356
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,960
What took you so long papaji...

1357
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,210
What were you doing?

1358
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,509
We are an insurance
company Mr. Chaddha,

1359
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,883
and your experience
is in airlines marketing.

1360
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,137
Won't work for us.

1361
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,557
Sir just give me a chance.

1362
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,181
Not just insurance,
I can even market the Qutub Minar!

1363
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,386
Qutub Minar!?

1364
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,138
It's not that easy Mr. Chaddha...

1365
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,765
It's the era of specialization...

1366
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,016
Thank you for coming.

1367
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,401

01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,608

1373
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,404
Sir I was an MBA topper...

1374
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:32,740

01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:33,869

01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,666
I'll work really hard sir!
- Mohit...Mohit Chaddha...

1377
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,495
Are you asking for
a job are you begging?

1378
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,049
Please!

1379
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,254
I am sorry

1380
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,801
Hey listen...
Only six tickets are left...

1381
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,228
Should I book tickets
for both you and Mohit?

1382
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,390
Yeah, book them!
- No listen, this is red lounge...

1383
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,892
You guys ditched us the last time...

1384
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,442
700 rupees were wasted...

1385
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,190
Please confirm and tell us Mayera...

1386
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,954
Excuse me your phone

1387
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,001
Hey
- Hi baby..

1388
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,174
Six thirty movie...
- I can't come...

1389
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,217
Why, what are you doing?

1390
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,011
Everyone is going, let's go?

1391
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,556
Everyone is <i>so</i> worried
about my job...

1392
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,891
That's the reason why
I've come for this interview,

1393
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,219
to end everyone's worries.

1394
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,100
So I should avoid watching
the movie with everyone

1395
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,852
and focus on my interview.

1396
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,026
I'm sure everyone will understand.

1397
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,437
Mohit, these are your friends.

1398
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,772
That's why they're
so worried about you.

1399
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,606
There's no need to be so sarcastic.

1400
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,160
Anyway, no chance for
the six thirty show right?

1401
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,249
No chance...

1402
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,042
There are around 10-11
candidates before me

1403
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,795
The interviews are extensive,
in-depth.

1404
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,334
But in case it gets over earlier...

1405
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,836
Damn it! I said there's no chance

1406
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,592
Ok...best of luck.

1407
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,047
Hi.. brother
- Hi.

1408
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,254
Sister is in her room.
- Ok.

1409
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,095
Mohit! Mohit..

1410
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,021
Hello

1411
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,394
Hey did you email
my application properly?

1412
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:08,478
There's no reply from anyone!

1413
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,938
Why are you getting stressed?
You'll get a response soon.

1414
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,856
Hey, where are you going man?
- It's her birthday.

1415
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,988
Assault mission game...cool huh?

1416
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,528
Where did you get this from?

1417
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:17,908
Palika market. Six hundred.

1418
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,080
If you'd told me, my guy
would've got it for three fifty

1419
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,330
Your guy wouldn't even
get the cover for three fifty.

1420
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,252
I have a reliable source in Palika.

1421
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,296
Mohit?!
- Ya Coming!

1422
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,040
Coming!

1423
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,674
Hi

1424
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,268
Happy birthday.
- Thank you...

1425
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,724
How do I look?

1426
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,938
Very hot...shall I gobble you up?

1427
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,521
Mango! My birthday gift to myself.

1428
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,655
What did you get for me?

1429
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,132
That's it?

1430
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,766
How could I borrow money from you,
to get a gift for you?

1431
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,060
It's my birthday!

1432
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,983
I wasn't expecting
a diamond necklace,

1433
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,943
you could have got me just a rose...

1434
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,818
You get pocket money after all.

1435
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,410
Open the door,
or else we'll break it down!

1436
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:47,707
Happy Birthday to you...

1437
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,254
Hi Wassup! Hey!

1438
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,840
Open the gift ya...

1439
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,636
Amazing!

1440
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,255
Guys c'mon ya!

1441
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,218
Go for it!

1442
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,640
Open the gift ya...

1443
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,480
It's awesome
Go get the candles!

1444
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,519
Go get it!

1445
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,195
Your cheque...it's bounced again.

1446
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,326
The landlord's fuming dude.

1447
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,825
You've got to arrange
for the rent today somehow.

1448
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,448
Bro you help me out today.

1449
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:25,991
I'll arrange the money by next week.

1450
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,705
Dude you haven't returned
the last loan either.

1451
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,166
I need cash badly,
please return my cash as well.

1452
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,711
You know what, forget it...

1453
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,839
just arrange for this month's rent.

1454
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,588
And Mohit, bro,
do something about your job.

1455
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,132
I'm working on it, I am.

1456
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,308
What are you doing?

1457
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,760
You're just busy
flying high in the air!

1458
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,972
Come back to earth bro,
accept a job in a lower position.

1459
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,230
Why should I?

1460
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,602
I'm an MBA for God's sake,
top of my class.

1461
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,273
And who got promoted, you or me?

1462
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,981
I was, and because of that
promotion your job got saved.

1463
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,487
So in return I should pay
your rent for the rest of my life?

1464
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:01,984
lmmy

1465
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,527
Get out!

1466
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,418
You know what...you've started
enjoying being unemployed.

1467
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,666
You want your money?
You'll get it...

1468
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,209
Now just get lost!

1469
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,543
I don't have fifteen thousand.

1470
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,344
I spent a lot this month...

1471
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,465
I got a new dress,
my birthday party,

1472
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,175
your car EMI,

1473
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,384
your credit card bill,

1474
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,265
your phone bill,
your pocket money...

1475
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,345
Awesome!

1476
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,805
Means whenever
I ask you for money,

1477
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,310
I'll have to listen
to this entire list?

1478
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,688
If you had warned me
about the rent in advance,

1479
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:35,984
I wouldn't have bought
the rock show tickets.

1480
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,235
Rock show tickets!

1481
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,906
Did I ask you to buy those tickets?

1482
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,651
Mohit now don't do that...
- You don't do that

1483
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,573
If you had told me earlier,

1484
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:49,999
I'd have sacrificed this as well...
like all other things.

1485
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,998
Sacrifice! What a sacrifice!

1486
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,296
- Yes sacrifice!

1487
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,463
You don't realize anything...

1488
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,462
I haven't even bought a new pair
of sandals these last two months.

1489
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,418
O god What a crisis!!!
What a crisis!!

1490
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,720
Yes it is a crisis

1491
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,547
Stuck on pizzas
and your oily omelet's..

1492
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,428
I've gained two bloody kilos!

1493
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,805
I work hard so that
I can enjoy my life,

1494
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,137
but thanks to you,

1495
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,391
leave alone malls and night-clubs,

1496
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,689
I've even forgotten the
smell of multiplex pop-corn!

1497
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,233
I don't want to waste my life
sitting in front of your television!

1498
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,061
It's one rock show that I wanted
to go for and even for that...

1499
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,316
you're creating such a scene!

1500
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,274
Mayera, one rock show!
It's just a rock show!

1501
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,450
You know what,
you should be given a Nobel Prize!

1502
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,493
Somebody, please,
give her a Nobel Prize.

1503
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,697
Any half sensible man would've
actually given me a prize!

1504
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,452
Why prize,
I'll give you your money back.

1505
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,408
Don't stress,
I'll settle everything!

1506
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,374
Ok Mohit every single penny...

1507
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:38,297
Of course! With interest!
- You are so disgusting

1508
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,249
Yes, I'm the disgusting one.
You're Mother India!

1509
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,550
Mohit stop the car

1510
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,303
I said I'll return it.

1511
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,677
I don't want to sit
in your dirty rotten car!

1512
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,009
Stop the car!

1513
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,181
Ok..

1514
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,562
Out of my car now...

1515
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,437
Get lost, bye...
and never sit in it again!

1516
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,069
Moron!

1517
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,159
Where to madam?

1518
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,406
What do you want? Move ahead!

1519
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,706
Hey rickshaw...rickshaw.

1520
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:20,632
One two three four...
One two three four

1521
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,049
One two...

1522
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,630
I've got mail...

1523
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,509
there is a vacancy...
I would like to welcome...

1524
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,265
join company.

1525
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,307
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oye yes yes!

1526
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:41,978
Sir, it's a car not a cycle...

1527
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,396
Latest model.

1528
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,574
No dent, no scratch,
hasn't run even a thousand miles.

1529
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,277
Your quotation is a shame for me...

1530
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:52,952
Make an offer I can't refuse...

1531
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,366
The car is in your garage...

1532
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,291
as soon as the money is
in sir's pocket!

1533
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,248
...Or else I can go to Mr. Bhalla.

1534
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:00,379
Yes Sir
- Yes Mohit...

1535
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,540
I've called to inform you,

1536
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:05,961
an interview call has finally come.

1537
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,006
It had to...the application
was filed so neatly.

1538
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,681
Neatly means nothing...

1539
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,890
My five page, mind-blowing
bio-data must have impressed them.

1540
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,645
Anyway, reach home quickly.

1541
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,143
We have to start preparing
for the interview.

1542
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:20,065
No Sir, not now...
there's some crisis here...

1543
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,691
Ok... if you can't come,
I'll come to your office..

1544
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,986
No no...

1545
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,947
You don't come here.
I'll do something

1546
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,983
Good, reach by 5.

1547
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:33,158
And look...thank you for all.

1548
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,368
Ok then.

1549
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:38,663
Yes Papa"-

01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:41,041
Mayera come home early today...

1551
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,873
Look, have I ever asked
you to come home early?

1552
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:44,752
No, right!

1553
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,381
But today please reach home by 6,
and no discussion on this.

1554
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,087
Or I will never speak to you again.

1555
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,013
Six means six. Bye bye bye.

1556
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,510
Radha!

1557
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,183
O radha
- Yes papaji

1558
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,761
Order two chicken
from the meat shop...

1559
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:59,142
and prepare the biryani spices...

1560
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,939
Mohit and Mayera
are coming home for dinner...

1561
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,562
Alright!
- And listen, make halwa as well.

1562
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,645
Gursharan...You know
PC Jewelers right?

1563
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,314
Can you get me a discount?

1564
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,194
So meet me there!

1565
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,741
At the South Ex show room...

1566
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,988
in one hour...

1567
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,622
I'll call you back.

1568
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,211
Eighty eight thousand...

1569
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,422
with detailed accounts, date-wise.

1570
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,421
I've put in five thousand extra,
just in case I've made a mistake.

1571
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,428
And if the mistake is of more
than five thousand, just email.

1572
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:31,675
I'll you a draft.

1573
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,842
Where is the damn accounts slip?

1574
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,556
It's ok...

1575
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,100
I'll make a fresh one...

1576
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:41,810
I remember everything...

1577
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,782
What impression will
my son-in-law have of me,

1578
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,113
if I give him such a ring?

1579
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,125
Show me a solid one,
not these flimsy things.

1580
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,292
What are you doing madam,

1581
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,791
Sehgal Sir is secretary
to Government of India IAS...

1582
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,167
Show us something
worthy of his status.

1583
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,590
Where is your owner, call him...

1584
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,087
No no Sir, I'll show you...

1585
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,463
Take a look at this...

1586
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,922
Matching rings for
the bride and groom.

1587
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,723
Yes, yes these are
solo diamonds right...

1588
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,142
What are they called?
- Sir solitaire..

1589
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,219
Solitaire. solitaire.
They are good.

1590
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,681
This will cost you around
four and a half lakhs...

1591
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,475
No...

1592
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,357
Four and a half is too much...
Show us something reasonable.

1593
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,437
No, do one thing...
please pack these.

1594
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,697
Here!

1595
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,238
Please check...

1596
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,615
this includes the tickets
of your stupid rock show...

1597
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,874
So I guess everything
is cleared between us.

1598
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:43,997
All clear...

1599
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,211
Rock show is stupid
because I wanted to go...

1600
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,881
and to be a cry baby like
you and stay home is very clever.

1601
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,088
I don't want to be clever like you,
I'm fine being stupid.

1602
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,169
And you know what,

1603
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,093
clever and stupid
shouldn't get married either.

1604
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,891
Yes, as if I want to get married.

1605
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,347
In any case I can't afford

1606
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,808
the stupidity of love
and marriage anymore.

1607
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,518
You know Gursharan
- Yes sir!

1608
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,603
This boy that Mayera has chosen...

1609
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:13,985
His market value may be less,
but his character is priceless...

1610
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,738
In my humble opinion,
character is the only value sir.

1611
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,819
Today when I got the interview mail,

1612
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,451
I thought I've tested
this boy enough...

1613
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,032
I should agree to their marriage...

1614
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,332
Correct thinking sir.

1615
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:28,747
But Mohit should never
know I was praising him,

1616
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,002
how long does it take
to get conceited, huh?

1617
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,292
Top secret sir.

1618
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:37,009
Now even this expensive
ring seems reasonable for him...

1619
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:38,840
perfect matching.

1620
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,349
We are not made for each other.

1621
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:42,684
Tsck!

1622
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,430
Actually there isn't any
point in meeting again.

1623
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,891
So I've not come to meet you,
I've just come to return the money.

1624
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,026
Break-up.

1625
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,155
In fact I was going to say it first.

1626
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,536
Breakup!
- Fine,

1627
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,164
you're first, I'm last...happy?

1628
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,838
Fine then get lost.

1629
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,465
You get lost

1630
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,842
This is my office Mohit,
you get lost...

1631
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,769
Your office, your money...
go to hell Mayera.

1632
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:31,400
<i>Why do all answers,</i>

1633
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:34,854
<i>Seem unreliable.</i>

1634
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:40,948
<i>Nothing seems real,</i>

1635
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:45,615
<i>On these crossroads</i>

1636
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,583
<i>Except an imaginary indifference.</i>

1637
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,548
<i>Except an imaginary indifference.</i>

1638
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,886
<i>Except an imaginary indifference.</i>

1639
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,530
This is the entire
history of the company...

1640
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:25,029
Please put away the
games and try to read it.

1641
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,868
Why should I read about them,

1642
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,704
are they taking my interview
or am I taking theirs?

1643
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,461
When I had come to
ask for Mayera's hand,

1644
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,208
I had done my complete
home-work on you...

1645
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,874
<i>so</i> that I don't say anything
that will make you reject me.

1646
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:40,218
Wow! You're very cool...

1647
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:44,014
Ok, I'm leaving now
- Wait, wait...

1648
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,930
I'll get you a beer...
- No Sir, I have to go to work...

1649
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,387
Beer is just a cold drink

1650
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,017
Please don't have a cold drink
before your interview.

1651
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,144
Ok, do one thing..
you load the game,

1652
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,725
I'll just come. Load the game...

1653
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,278
Now where's this Mayera?

1654
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,356
Must be on her way...
- It's six...

1655
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,112
I had told her to come early...

1656
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,360
How much longer can I delay Mohit...

1657
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,029
Aah...The smell of the
halwa is irresistible...

1658
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,489
The thing is son,

1659
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,995
this is not a chilled beer,
it's a child beer...

1660
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,035
Cheers!
- Papa I am home

1661
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,709
We're here Mayera...

1662
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,419
Where are you off to?

1663
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,459
Mohit?!!!

1664
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:23,928
What the hell

1665
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,430
What are you doing in my house?

1666
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,222
L...l...
- Hey, son of Romeo...

1667
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,770
your Juliet is here...
Leave the window and come in...

1668
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,643
Papa please...
- Shhh...quiet...nobody will speak,

1669
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,315
Only I will speak now...

1670
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,189
Radha!
- Radha is at home?

1671
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,439
So where else will she be?

1672
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,989
C'mon Mohit, show some enthusiasm...

1673
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,910
Sit down both of you!

1674
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,536
Congratulations brother...

1675
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,119
Sister...

1676
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:59,837
Yoohoo...Surprise...
Congratulations...

1677
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:03,002
One for you and one for you

1678
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,301
Take it, will you keep
me standing like this?

1679
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:13,730
Tell me, do you like it?
How do you like it, the rings?

1680
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,019
What?

1681
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,402
Someone say something...

1682
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,485
This is your probation's
report card...

1683
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,992
you're not perfect,
but we'll make do...

1684
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,288
Now before I change my mind,

1685
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,616
please make each other
wear the rings...

1686
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,298
What's wrong?

1687
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,506
They're solitaires...

1688
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:46,591
Don't like the design?

1689
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,219
Ok, just wear them
now for ceremony...

1690
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,349
Tomorrow you can go there
and choose your own rings.

1691
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,347
Ok?

1692
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:55,270
So who wears the ring first,
the boy or the girl?

1693
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,058
Why are you laughing?

1694
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,646
Papa...we are not getting married...

1695
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:04,901
She is serious

1696
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:08,655
It's over between us...all over..

1697
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,784
Hey...sit, sit down!

1698
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,586
So I simply played all this squash,
wasted my sweat,

1699
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,875
made enquiries in
fifty departments...

1700
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,626
And do you know how many
phone calls, photocopies,

1701
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:28,883
plastic files I've spent
on...on this Mohit of your's?

1702
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,469
Not mine.

1703
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,886
Now I'm not going to
investigate any other boy...

1704
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,890
Talk to each other, and resolve
whatever this fight is about...

1705
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,809
Say sorry,
and exchange rings...come on...

1706
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,143
Papa it's impossible.

1707
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,695
There's a huge gap between us now.

1708
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,488
Which can only be filled
with a lot of money.

1709
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,406
Money that your daughter has,
but I don't...

1710
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,360
Does anyone fight over money...

1711
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,118
Did you borrow money from him?
Return it...

1712
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,329
I don't have any money
for her to borrow...

1713
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,582
I haven't got a salary
for three months...

1714
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:04,172
and the fact is, I am unemployed..

1715
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,337
I'm looking for a job.

1716
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,794
You lost your airlines job?

1717
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,756
Oh bloody!

1718
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:13,845
You lost it then itself, right?

1719
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,009
I knew it...l knew it...

1720
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,807
You lied to me?
- Yes...

1721
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,430
I lied to you...

1722
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,523
So now, should I
make her wear the ring?

1723
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:22,770
Like hell you will!

1724
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,692
You've failed a 100%...
100% fail!

1725
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,940
You've lied, you liar!

1726
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,362
And you pretend to be Gandhi...

1727
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:28,943
you are lying to Mayera yourself...

1728
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:30,823
What lying?

1729
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,907
I'm trying for a job,
he's helping me...

1730
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,863
Was helping me...was!

1731
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,703
You had promised me...

1732
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,712
Sister, halwa...

1733
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:55,807
Forget it Papa

1734
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:58,055
Please get rid of
this job mania...ok?

1735
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,725
Mohit gone... mania gone!

1736
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,163
Driver, bring the car...
- Excuse me sir...

1737
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,497
Come in Mayera.

1738
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,129
Sir is the Dubai
position still open?

1739
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,005
You've taken too long silly...

1740
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,928
Dubai office has
already got someone.

1741
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,051
Trust me I don't
like that moron one bit.

1742
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,598
I wanted you there Mayera.

1743
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,474
But he's joining next week,
if you can go before that...

1744
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:43,014
Can you leave tonight?

1745
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,223
The travel desk will
arrange the visa..

1746
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:47,442
Absolutely sir
- Perfect!

1747
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,236
I say go there, work for a week
do your magic

1748
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:51,985
If you are able
to convince them there,

1749
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:53,319
I'll get all the approvals here.

1750
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,275
And once you get
the appointment in Dubai,

1751
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,486
come back over
the weekend to shift base properly.

1752
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,695
What say?

1753
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,077
I say Thank you
thank you so much sir.

1754
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,908
But for now,

you are going on
a regular assignment.

1756
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:09,505
What about Mohit?

1757
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,050
Mohit is history.

1758
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,571
What's going on?

1759
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:41,743
Hello sir...I'm Nawab Master...
the driving instructor...

1760
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:43,706

business as well...

Mohit sir's car at a top price...

1762
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,045

1763
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,002
Mohit?! Dude You sold your car!

1764
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,211
What's going on!?

1765

Ok <i>so</i> all accounts
have been settled now...

1766
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,637
Where are you going?

1767
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,216
They're settled today,
they'll be unsettled tomorrow...

1768
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,225
If I stay with you guys
any longer who knows,

1769
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,722
I might begin to enjoy
being unemployed...

1770
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:06,222
Mohit Mohit sorry.

1771
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,269
I swear I'll never
read your newspaper...

1772
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:09,645
I'll never watch Big Boss...

1773
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,648
I'll pay for beer for
the entire month...l swear...

1774
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,315
You can have my entire
Playboy collection!

1776
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,531
Mohit...

1777
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,185
<i>You coach your heart,</i>

1778
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,262
<i>Reproach your heart,</i>

1779
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:51,475
<i>Fool it into submission.</i>

1780
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,606
<i>If it's not broken,</i>

1781
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,733
<i>It's trust is not taken,</i>

1782
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,942
<i>Then why does it hurt so much...</i>

1783
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,236
<i>False concessions...</i>

1784
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,367
<i>Fake confessions...</i>

1785
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:08,041
<i>It hides all your mistakes...</i>

1786
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,703
<i>It fools others,</i>

1787
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,788
<i>And condemns itself,</i>

1788
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:17,502
<i>Looks for gain even in losses.</i>

1789
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:23,132

All the positions have been taken...

1801
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,885
Why don't you leave
your resume behind,

1802
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,053
we'll get back to you.

1803
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,552
No... thanks

1804
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,050
Ok...all the best.

1805
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,314
<i>Your temper's still high,</i>

1806
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,395
<i>You show no improvement.</i>

1807
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,654
<i>You fall on your face all along.</i>

<i>You spend your days cursing others...</i>

1812
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,880
<i>Oh how stubborn you are!</i>

1813
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:43,963
<i>Someone must stop you,
at least accost you</i>

1814
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:48,009
<i>Till when will you fool yourself?</i>

1815
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,017
Mohit, hi.

Thank you sir...

1847
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,901
Negi...who are those
couples at table 3 and 12?

1848
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,487
They've been occupying those tables
for the last three hours...

1849
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,823
Get them out!
- They're penniless lovers sir...

1850
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:17,790
Where will they go
for their love talk?

1851
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:20,043
If they go home,
parents will slap them...

1852
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:21,711
If they go to a park,
cops will shoo them away...

1853
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:24,001
They're sitting here
quietly cooing...let them...

1854
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,336
Why get into the business of love...

1855
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:27,842
when they're penniless!

1856
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,637
Yes Sir, boss's orders...

1857
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,134
I'll shoo these lave-birds away...

1858
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:33,472
Hey senior-most

1859
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,266
First put that stick aside...

1860
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,351
Give them a cappuccino each,

1861
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,263
and tell them they won't
get anything for free after this!

1862
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:41,356
If they want to sit here,
they'll have to spend...

1863
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:42,940
Or else, out in an hour...

1864
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,477
My love mantra touched
you as well, right?

1865
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,732
Yes bro, I'm really touched...

1866
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,028
Shall I give them
both a brownie as well?

1867
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,189
Shall I throw you out?

1868
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,196
<i>You're something else...
try to</i> be <i>happy...</i>

1869
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,697
Hi..

1870
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:55,904
Hey, you're back!

1871
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,286
Sir this is Manju...

1872
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,871
She'd gone to Rohtak
for her cousin's wedding...

1873
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,626
This is our Mohit Sir...

1874
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:04,628
Hello sir
- Hi Manju

1875
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:05,876
Sir I'll just be back...

1876
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:10,585
Sir Manju is my GF

1877
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:13,929
I can see that.

1878
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:16,049
Now I'll enjoy my work...

1879
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:17,513
Sir
- Yeah?

1880
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:21,020
Don't mind, but your
professional story is very sad...

1881
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,435
But your love story
can be easily solved..

1882
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:27,110
...by saying sorry to each other.
- Manju, by god!

1883
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,646
Her mother calls
her 'Big-mouth Manju'...

1884
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,652
I'm never going to
tell you anything now...

1885
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:33,692
I'm sorry I told her sir...

1886
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:35,402
Other than this,
your secret is a top secret...

1887
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,203
It's her fault...
she should say sorry...why should I?

1888
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,076
But Sir, just listen...
Just talk to her once and see...

1889
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,657
Let's go Manju...
Sir has a very bad temper!

1890
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,708
Hey let me just talk
to him for a second...

1891
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,754
That liar!

1892
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,169
Jobless...

1893
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:55,798
...dependent on Mayera
for the last two months!

1894
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,551
I should have sent him to jail!

1895
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:02,686
Don't know why I'm
so confused about him...

1896
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:05,474
Sir, the Government never
respected your goodness...

1897
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,857
transfer upon transfer...

1898
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,852
But God is watching Sir,

1899
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:12,364
he saved you and our
Mayera at the last minute...

1900
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:13,860
No more scope for confusion.

1901
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:18,119
Tell madam to give me whatever
money is due for these rings...

1902
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:20,117
Sir patience sir patience...

1903
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,285
But I didn't understand one thing...

1904
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,242
Once he had broken up with Mayera,

1905
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,043
why did he go out
of his way to help you?

1906
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:28,546
Logically speaking,
he shouldn't have...

1907
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,215
I think it's a big conspiracy Sir...

1908
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,971
In my humble opinion, pull
some strings and send him to jail...

1909
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:37,639
Gursharan Singh!

1910
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,015
What an opinion.

1911
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:44,270
Sir your luck is very good,
gold prices have shot up...

1912
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:46,682
You've made a profit
of thirty seven thousand,

1913
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,732
five hundred and eighty rupees...

1914
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:50,526
Thirty seven thousand...

1915
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,188
Why did my luck
have to change today?

1916
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:54,689
Bloody!

1917
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:57,025
I don't want to sell...
thanks a lot for your assistance...

1918
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,443
Sir
- Sir

1919
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,700
You raised one question
and cleared the entire matter...

1920
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:03,201
couldn't you have done this earlier?

1921
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,079
I wouldn't have had to
bear such a big loss.

1922
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:07,502
Sir what question did I raise sir?

1923
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:09,420
He had made me a promise...

1924
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,372
and how could he break his promise?

1925
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,175
He came to help me
even after the break up...

1926
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:17,003
Wow! Look at the character
of that guy...

1927
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:19,093
How can I leave a guy
with such a fine character?

1928
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:22,301
Sir anyone can get a character
certificate by paying extra money...

1929
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,726
but the boy is jobless.

1930
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,929
Yes he's jobless,

1931
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:30,267
but he taught me that life
doesn't end but starts at sixty...

1932
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:33,061
That duffer made me,
what is that, cool...

1933
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,354
He made me cool!

1934
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:37,361
He's an MBA,
sooner or later he'll get a job...

1935
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,612
That's ok Sir... but..

1936
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,194
The thinking of the boy
and girl doesn't match yours...

1937
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:42,745
They are fighting...

1938
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:43,992
Gursharan,

1939
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,874
have Romeo and Juliet ever
come together without the villain?

1940
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,202
No sir
- No!

1941
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:52,004
This time as well the
villain will unite them.

1942
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,178
Mayera!
- Where were you?

1943
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,600
I've been trying your
phone for so long!

1944
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,885
Give me the keys,
I need your passport...

1945
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:07,721
Passport? Why?

1946
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,816
What?
- Just hear me out...sit here...

1947
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,318
What is this?

1948
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,988
Our new house, in Dubai...

1949
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,193
Our new house?

1950
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,026
Yes papa.. It's a
4 bedroom apartment...

1951
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:24,537
A kitchen that's bigger than
our living room, fully equipped.

1952
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,869
Meet Mayera Sehgal papa...

1953
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,825
new vice president
of the Dubai office...

1954
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:30,910
Double the salary,
that too in Dirham...

1955
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:32,916
See, I did what you wanted!

1956
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:36,458
What?!

1957
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,044
Now don't say you
don't want to go...

1958
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,507
because you don't have a choice...

1959
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,046
No silly...

1960
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,258
I'm in shock, with happiness...

1961
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,135
It's the best decision
of your life...

1962
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,515
Here are the keys...

1963
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:51,101
But we have to pack
up the house in two days,

1964
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,183
if I don't join on Monday
the offer will be cancelled..

1965
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,483
Don't worry, I'm there...

1966
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,728
I'll do what's correct for you...

1967
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:59,189
That Mohit, that useless Mohit...

1968
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:01,320
Imagine if you'd
gotten married to him,

1969
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,493
would you have been
able to move to Dubai?

1970
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,911
Radha, did you get the cartons?

1971
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,159
Yes...

1972
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:10,500
Don't worry, we won't leave
without taking our revenge...

1973
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:14,037
I have told Gursharan to
make a fake case against him

1974
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:17,298
and send him to Tihar jail...

1975
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,466
Papa are you mad?

1976
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:23,388
First they will break his
bones with the Tihar sticks,

1977
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:26,182
that'll really be breaking
Mr. Mohit up!

1978
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,474
What fun!

1979
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:29,052
You're just too much!

1980
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:30,807
Call Gursharan Uncle right now...

1981
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:32,355
Stop him, come on...

1982
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:35,107
Will you feel bad
if that rogue is in pain?

1983
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:40,030
If you love him so much,
why are you running away to Dubai?

1984
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:41,864
I'll get out of your way...

1985
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:46,323
Now you're getting confused,
should I go to Dubai or not...

1986
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,571
To be or not to be...

1987
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,702
Romeo and Juliet...

1988
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,205
There's no confusion...

1989
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:57,122
I just don't want any new problem
to come up and keep us behind...

1990
01:37:58,373 --> 01:37:59,841
Talk to Gursharan uncle...

1991
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:05,592
Yes Gursharan
Tihar-plan cancelled...

1992
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:08,220
Happy?

1993
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:14,727
Hey Gursharan my friend...
nobody has to be sent to Tihar...

1994
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,023
Now listen to me,

1995
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,103
Mayera has taken both
our passports to Ajanta Travels

1996
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:20,653
for the tickets and visa...

1997
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,941
You have to set up something
at the travel agency so

1998
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:26,117
that we don't get the visas...

1999
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,360
Now you understand?

2000
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:29,537
Yes, we shouldn't get the visas!

2001
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:30,659
Good...

2002
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:31,910
Yes!

2003
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:36,202
Come on Mohit, answer the phone...

2004
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:38,462
Oh hell!

2005
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:42,425
Now how do I contact this duffer?

2006
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,260
You sir...?
- Yes.

2007
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,560
Sir...Mohit was just here...

2008
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:54,888
I think he's gone
to the conference room...

2009
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:58,191
Will you keep lying all your life,
to save your friend?

2010
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:00,359
Not lying...

2011
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,688
Where is he? Tell me the truth.

2012
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,857
He's changed his number,
doesn't reply to emails...

2013
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,192
I don't know Sir,
he's just disappeared...

2014
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:10,741
Think!

2015
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:14,033
There must be someone
who can tell us about him...

2016
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,624
Think carefully,

2017
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,414
the Home Secretary was my batch mate!

2018
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,464
By God, what happened to
Mohit was very unfortunate...

2019
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,840
I tried to tell him,
don't show off your automatic car,

2020
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:31,094
who knows you may not
have even a cycle tomorrow!

2021
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:32,391
He didn't listen to me...

2022
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:33,847
But where is he?

2023
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,352
Stop bro, stop...Sir over there...

2024
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,437
Very good...Thank you Master.

2025
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,648
Ok lmmy, thank you...
- Welcome sir.

2026
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:57,749
Hey waiter!

2027
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:08,594
Bloody good!

2028
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,886
How can I help you sir?

2029
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,508
Do you get a salary,
or are you on daily wages?

2030
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,643
Which coffee sir?

2031
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:21,353
Hmm, get me a Cappuccino...

2032
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:24,151
and a cup of tea for you.
It's on me...

2033
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:26,479
No thanks... One cappuccino please!

2034
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,447
Anything else?

2035
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,653
How about a brownie

2036
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:32,611
Let me help increase your sales,

2037
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:34,115
you must be getting
a commission huh?

2038
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:37,998
Bring it out please.

2039
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:42,378
<i>Let the love never be less,
I will take every other loss...</i>

2040
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:47,418
Let the love never be less...

2041
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:51,718
<i>I will take every other loss...</i>

2042
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,343
Hey boy!

2043
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:56,433
What shoddy service is this?
Clean the damn table!

2044
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:05,984
Take it...

2045
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:09,280
You can get your new
girlfriend peanuts with it...

2046
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,908
And this time look for
someone who is of your status.

2047
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,151
Why have you come here?

2048
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:17,872
To tell you that Mayera
is moving to Dubai.

2049
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:22,706
It hurts doesn't it?

2050
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:25,913
How you both used to boast...

2051
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,921
"We can eat love,
we can wear love"

2052
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:32,257
"we can fill love in the
petrol tank and drive off..."

2053
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:34,217
So where is all that love?

2054
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,008
Now do you understand
the value of money?

2055
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,895
As always,
Mayera is smarter than you..

2056
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,481
She's taken a transfer to Dubai...

2057
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:47,106
In a week's time Dubai will
make her forget the pain, and you...

2058
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:50,146
You just keep selling
your tea coffee here...

2059
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:56,195
You think you're very smart,
but you're just a big duffer!

2060
01:41:56,444 --> 01:42:00,665
Don't you understand
Mayera is spoilt...

2061
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,326
She's gotten used
to the 5 Star life...

2062
01:42:03,826 --> 01:42:05,669
You should be happy
the marriage didn't happen,

2063
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,497
she would have made you bankrupt!

2064
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:10,382
See, as soon as you
lost your money,

2065
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,382
that snob tossed you aside like
an insignificant fly!

2066
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:14,963
You're calling your
own daughter a snob?

2067
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,174
Why are you feeling bad?

2068
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,680
What does she mean to you now?

2069
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:23,931
Anyway, she's dumping
you and going...

2070
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,390
that too in business class!

2071
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,563
After this, don't ever let yourself
fall in love with a money-minded,

2072
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:30,691
selfish, opportunist like Mayera...

2073
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:33,068
Enough Mr. Sehgal!
This is too much..

2074
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:34,614
You've said enough...

2075
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,655
Now if you say even
one word against Mayera I'll...

2076
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:39,112
You'll what? What will you do?

2077
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,824
The Romeo passion doesn't
go well with empty pockets...

2078
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,960
You flaunt your love
like you're some millionare

2079
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:49,379
but you're just a bloody waiter!!

2080
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:52,917
We're leaving for
the airport in about three hours...

2081
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,092
understood?

2082
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:57,763
If I see you within a five kilometer
radius of the airport...

2083
01:42:57,963 --> 01:43:01,183
remember, the Home Secretary
is my batch mate!

2084
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,809
Excuse me!

2085
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:06,185
Your photo will go
to the home department...

2086
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,100
Then it will flash to every PCR van,
Black Cats,

2087
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:12,904
NSG commandos, CRPF, RAW agents...

2088
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,652
Don't you ever mess with us

2089
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:17,654
and stay away from my daughter!

2090
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:19,200
Bloody waiter!

2091
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:34,799
She's moving to Dubai...

2092
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,006
She could have at least told me that!

2093
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,760
Sir there's no point
in being sad right now...

2094
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:41,924
Just go say sorry to ma'am,
and stop her from leaving.

2095
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,133
How can I just go
and apologize to her?

2096
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:46,270
She's the one who broke up first.
She'll have to say sorry first.

2097
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,139
Sir it's not a race...

2098
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,520
If you're going to let your
ego become as big as an airplane,

2099
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:53,144
Ma'am will simply fly away!
And you'll be left wondering forever

2100
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:54,945
Bloody waiter...

2101
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,693
Sir, that old man
has insulted all of us...

2102
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,941
You've to give it back to
that rotten fellow!

2103
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:02,487
Yes Sir, steal Mayera away
from right under his nose...

2104
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,867
That will be a fitting reply.

2105
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:06,745
Are you done with the lecturing?

2106
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:10,461
Enough of me and my life...
get back to work.

2107
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:12,538
Sir please listen to me...
- I said get back to work!!

2108
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:19,003
Hey! Stop right here...

2109
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:20,508
Yes...Stop...

2110
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,341
How much?
- Forty five sir...

2111
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:24,888
Keep the change...

2112
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:27,557
Where were you papa? Hurry up
and get ready or we will get late...

2113
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:29,058
I'll just get ready...

2114
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,348
Gursharan done?
- Ma'am please sign here...

2115
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:31,774
No, not done sir.

2116
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,309
Not done what?
- What done? Not done?

2117
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:34,814
What? No nothing...

2118
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,107
Go inside!

2119
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:39,691
Ma'am your passports with
Dubai Visa and tickets.

2120
01:44:39,982 --> 01:44:42,405
Radha, you've latched
all the windows properly right?

2121
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:44,328
Yes!
- And switched off the gas?

2122
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:46,030
I have...
- Ok alright!

2123
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:49,201
Give all your papers
to Gursharan uncle...

2124
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,001
And come here to
clean up every Saturday,

2125
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:53,037
otherwise I won't
come back to get you...

2126
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,747
Sis, don't go please...

2127
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,582
Why are you crying?

2128
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:58,926
I'm coming back to get you, ok?

2129
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,796
Please don't go sis...
- Stupid girl!

2130
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,677
I will miss you a lot...

2131
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:11,022
Ok now stop crying
and take all the bags out, ok?

2132
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:16,193
Sir in my humble opinion

2133
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,146
What do we do about the rings?

2134
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:23,193
I've never abused
so much in my life...

2135
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,988
I called my own daughter proud...

2136
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,745
I tell you, these two
are more stubborn than me...

2137
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:35,747
I don't know whether gold prices
are up or down now...

2138
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:38,128
but sell them irrespective of
whether they fetch a profit or loss!

2139
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:39,754
And deposit the
money in my account...

2140
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:44,422
I guess this time too Romeo
and Juliet will have a tragic end.

2141
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:48,596
Sir,
- What?

2142
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:50,019
Sir, please come here...
- What's the matter?

2143
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:51,349
Sir see!
- What?

2144
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,892
Now let's make sure
he doesn't go free!

2145
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,613
Gursharan pick up a weapon!

2146
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,235
Wait Sir, I'm coming too...
- No, you wait here...

2147
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:03,907
Sir that mad old man is dangerous...

2148
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,910
I know, but after all
he is my father-in-law...

2149
01:46:07,736 --> 01:46:08,908
Careful sir

2150
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:16,754
Brother Mohit

2151
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:19,377
Beware!

2152
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:23,465
Don't you dare take a single step,
or I'll handicap you...

2153
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,381
Gursharan call the
Police Commissioner...

2154
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:27,589
Yes Sir!

2155
01:46:27,673 --> 01:46:30,722
The Home Secretary...
- Yes, I know, he's your batch-mate.

2156
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,682
But I don't want to talk to you...

2157
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,689
Call Mayera... Call her...

2158
01:46:36,015 --> 01:46:38,143
Mayera, Mayera...

2159
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,567
Mayera...

2160
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:44,482
Why should Mayera come?

2161
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:48,449
Who are you, just a waiter?

2162
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:54,413
First earn some money,
have a bank balance...

2163
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:57,996
My Mayera won't go with a loser...

2164
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:01,583
She's come to her senses now,
you bloody penny-pincher!

2165
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,001
Sir reality check...

2166
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,761
You're behaving very,
very uncool right now Sir...

2167
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:09,549
Insulting my waiter friends,
uncool"

2168
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:13,386
Calling Mayera proud, uncool...

2169
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:17,607
And your hundred year old
money-theory, that's uncool too...

2170
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:19,642
If one followed your theory,

2171
01:47:20,059 --> 01:47:22,187
the poor would not be
allowed to love or live...

2172
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:25,064
If there is love,

2173
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,702
thirty rupees
and one cup of coffee...

2174
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:33,872
is enough to be happy...

2175
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:36,291
What if there's no money,

2176
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,418
there's unlimited love...

2177
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,541
Money or no money,
loves finds it's way...

2178
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:46,252
Where there's love, there's a way...

2179
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,007
She hates you...

2180
01:47:48,253 --> 01:47:50,802
And you must know,
we were going to pray

2181
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:53,760
at the hanuman temple
on the way to the airport...

2182
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:55,594
that you are never happy in life...

2183
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:58,022
You bloody loser...
- Papa enough

2184
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,603
What has Mohit done to you?

2185
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,438
He agreed to the probation...

2186
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,020
He lost all the matches with you...

2187
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:07,190
He's the national level under-16
silver medalist in squash...

2188
01:48:07,272 --> 01:48:08,615
yet he lost all matches for you...

2189
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:10,572
He helped you
with your job-hunting...

2190
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:12,995
lied to me for you...

2191
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:16,453
He calls you Osama, but you're
not less than a terrorist...

2192
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:19,585
he kept tolerating you, for me...

2193
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:25,257
The man who can do so much for me,

2194
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,918
can also give his life for me...

2195
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:36,602
Waiter or manager,
pauper or prince,

2196
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:39,062
I love him...

2197
01:48:40,806 --> 01:48:42,558
Some sacrifices will
have to be made...

2198
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:44,651
I won't get to go to rock shows,

2199
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:47,150
dinner once a month,
shopping once a year...

2200
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,527
Hey hey...I'm not going to
work at a coffee shop all my life...

2201
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:51,324
Until you do...

2202
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:53,110
We will still have fun...

2203
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:57,456
Without you I don't
enjoy shopping at all,

2204
01:48:58,032 --> 01:49:00,956
whatever the credit card limit...

2205
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:03,792
Because when you're not around,
there's nobody to say...

2206
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:06,374
Very hot...shall I gobble you up!

2207
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:23,224
Hey...no hanky-panky here...
all this after marriage...

2208
01:49:23,307 --> 01:49:24,524
What's going on dad?

2209
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,190
Weren't you very happy
with our break-up?

2210
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,112
Your generation always has to do

2211
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:31,316
the opposite of what
the parents say...

2212
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:32,741
It's always the case...

2213
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:34,284
Papa you are crazy

2214
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:37,496
if I had listed his good qualities

2215
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:40,491
would you say sorry
and patch up with him? No!

2216
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:42,918
I abused him only then
did you understand...

2217
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,371
Hey, Stupid!

2218
01:49:45,454 --> 01:49:48,253
You call me uncool, you bloody fool!

2219
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:50,459
If you want to be my
son-in-law take my blessings...

2220
01:49:52,836 --> 01:49:55,009
Not like this, give me hug...

2221
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:56,264
A good one...

2222
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,592
Stupid fellow...

2223
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:00,135
Come here!

2224
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,061
Now give the rings...

2225
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:06,525
Your wish means everything,
and mine means nothing...

2226
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:08,147
Which wish?

2227
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:10,233
Today is my interview...

2228
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:11,438
I have to go there...

2229
01:50:11,522 --> 01:50:14,366
Rings can wait...
- Papa!

2230
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:15,988
Let him go, otherwise
he will never leave us alone...

2231
01:50:16,068 --> 01:50:17,194
He won't be able
to take the pressure

2232
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,449
of a private job at his age.

2233
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:19,655
He's letting you
decide for yourself...

2234
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,035
Let him do the same...

2235
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:22,958
Dear in my humble opinion,
he's right...

2236
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:25,870
Ok...fine guys.

2237
01:50:32,334 --> 01:50:34,007
So...how am I looking?

2238
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:37,969
Don't you have a suit?
- Suit.

2239
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:41,302
I got a new Safari suit made
for this, from Singh Tailors...

2240
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:42,685
four pockets.

2241
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:45,514
Suit and tie please!
- Oh bloody

2242
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:47,270
Where are you taking me?
- Come on, come on...

2243
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:49,230
Gursharan I am being kidnapped...
- C'mon!

2244
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:52,028
Oh wait, you guys have
sandwiched me in between!

2245
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,814
The sandwich needs a good tie!

2246
01:50:53,897 --> 01:50:55,274
Hello Unni sir
I love you too much...

2247
01:50:55,357 --> 01:50:57,030
I can't leave you and go to Dubai...

2248
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:06,119
How crowded this place is...

2249
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:08,287
come on guys...come on...

2250
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:11,632
You'll shift out of this hole in
the wall after marriage, wont you?

2251
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,381
Say sorry sir...l take of fence...

2252
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:16,006
Say sorry sir or no tie...

2253
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,339
Sorry, bro sorry!

2254
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:23,476
Please get me sober tie,
according to my age...

2255
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:25,270
Young and dynamic sir.

2256
01:51:25,888 --> 01:51:28,141
Where are you going?
- He'll get something silly...

2257
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:30,271
Ok, choose a good one...

2258
01:51:46,742 --> 01:51:50,087
I missed you.
- I know man, where were you...

2259
01:52:07,512 --> 01:52:09,139
Osama
- Crap!

2260
01:52:13,852 --> 01:52:15,069
Killer!

2261
01:52:19,983 --> 01:52:23,829
Sir don't show off in the interview,

2262
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:25,451
that the home Secretary
is your batch mate...

2263
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:28,875
It'll give a good impression...
you won't understand...

2264
01:52:28,951 --> 01:52:30,703
Papa, it doesn't make
a difference to anyone...

2265
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:32,163
Really,
- Yeah!

2266
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:34,707
I thought that's why
Mohit is scared of me...

2267
01:52:34,873 --> 01:52:36,125
You're not scared of me?

2268
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:37,964
Hey duffer...

2269
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,297
Don't scare anyone.

2270
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:43,223
You're going for an interview,
not to pick a son-in-law...

2271
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,767
I know ya... I'm your father
you are not my father.

2272
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:47,844
Sehgal VK
- They're asking for your name...

2273
01:52:47,928 --> 01:52:49,805

- Vinod Kumar Sehgal...

2274
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,731
VK Sehgal
- This way sir.

2275

2281
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:12,707
Your financing skills,
and my marketing...

2282
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:14,000
lets open a coffee shop..

2283
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:16,791
I've understood one
thing from all this...

2284
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:19,843
even if they have no money,
people don't stop drinking coffee...

2285
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:23,092
Brilliant...and we will
call it One Cup Coffee...

2286
01:53:23,171 --> 01:53:24,514
No ya...
- Why not?!

2287
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:26,091
Then people will drink only one cup!

2288
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,177
Listen, I will keep the name...

2289
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,683
The home Secretary
is my papa's batch-mate ok!

2290
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:33,640
I'm going to gobble
this Home Secretary up...

2291
01:53:34,099 --> 01:53:35,316
Osama...

2292
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,986
Oh no.. papa..
Don't worry its ok

2293
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:45,820
