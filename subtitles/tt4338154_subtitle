1
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,576
How is it?
- Nice.

2
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:14,449
It's not just nice...it's spectacular.

3
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,248
Because my Shastn/ ji designed it.

4
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:21,557
And do you know what I did?

5
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,559
I killed him.

6
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,698
Yes, I killed him.

7
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,264
L.. I killed him.

8
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:46,719
Birth-Death, Everything is destined.

9
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:55,317
From Sita's abduction
to Lanka's destruction.

10
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,963
From Draupadi's ignominy
to the defeat of Kauravs.

11
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,465
Everything was destined .

12
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:08,402
The one above us all has
pre-destined everything for us.

13
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:14,277
We will have our share of rains.

14
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:23,246
And only our share of sunshine.

15
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:32,863
The flipping of the coin
will favour us when it's our time.

16
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,661
Heads!

17
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,268
Everything is destined .

18
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,693
But the interesting thing is that...

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,200
We have no idea where our
share of clouds, sun and coin are?

20
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,853
That's why I say

21
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,153
Keep changing the
direction of the wind.

22
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,900
Keep Collecting sunshine in your fist.

23
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,394
Keep tossing the coin.

24
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,198
Without fail, relentlessly.

25
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,870
Because we are all destined to fly.

26
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,397

Shivkar Talpade!

39
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,931
You're playing right
in the middle of my class.

40
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,675
You're also teaching right
in the middle of my game.

41
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,544
See, children..

42
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,548
At the end of my cane..

43
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:08,277
..stands the most stupid
person in the world. - That's true.

44
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,480
But which end?

45
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,218
This end or that end?
- Quiet!

46
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,521
Quiet! Learn something
from your nephew, Narayan

47
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,393
Year after year he has
done well at his studies...

48
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,797
..so much so that today
he shares the same bench as you.

49
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,601
And you, your books have been rusting
in the same trunk for years.

50
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,729
Same trunk?

51
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,794
No, sir. I changed my
trunks this morning only.

52
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,134
Quiet.

53
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,405
Do you want to set
a record in failing?

54
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,577
Do you want to study?

55
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,415
Get out.
- Forever?

56
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,349
Get out!
- My bag...

57
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,885
Get out of here.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,555
Quiet! No one's going anywhere.

59
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,357
I'll teach that scoundrel a lesson.

60
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:04,132
"Free Flying Head"

61
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,812
"Free Flying Head"

62
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:17,481
"Pay your respects and look above"

63
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,686
“I'm out to hunt with my gun of love.“

64
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:26,494
"Pay your respects and look above"

65
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:31,226
“I'm out to hunt with my gun of love.“

66
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:36,240
“My heart's the prince
of my imaginary world“

67
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,333
"Salute now...here comes...

68

"Free Flying Head"

69
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,212
"Free Flying Head"

70
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,643
What? Signature?

71
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,702
Not just signature...
it's a memorabilia.

72
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,771
It's always treasured.
- Of glorious people.

73
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,182
I see.
So it's decided.

74
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,583
One day I'll do
something so glorious..

75
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,349
..that you will take
my autograph as well.

76
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,821
And call it.. memorabilia.

77
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,221
Buzz off!

78
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,554
Laughing at me?

79
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,226
Should I prove it to you?

80
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,327
How about a bet?
- Done.

81
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,827
“The sultry night like
a woman is studded with stars...“

82
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,429
"She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon..."

83
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,634
"...stitched onto
it which has no scars..."

84
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:48,442
“The sultry night like
a woman is studded with a stars...“

85
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,573
"She stands wrapped
in a shawl with moon..."

86
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,776
"...stitched onto
it which has no scars..."

87
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,414
“To reveal the mystery,
I scrapped off the moon.“

88
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,450
"There's a hole in the universe
as big as the one in my pocket"

89
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,689
"Not a penny to spare..."

90
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,096
"But a smile on my
face I always share"

91
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,762
"Will sell quaner of
my head for millions..,"

92
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,101
“Salute everyone. . .here comes. . .“

93
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,472

95
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,159
"Free flying head"

96
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,605
Ticket.
- Are you crazy?

97
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,371
Here.

98
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,571
Stopping me from
entering my own house.

99
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,309
Who appointed you? Tell me.
Who?

100
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,317
Your father did.

101
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,218
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

102
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,779
He also had to be born
as my father in my house only.

103
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,256
What has the world come to?

104
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,524
I've to climb the pipe to my own home.

105
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,125
Pam's torn!

106
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,147
Come on..

107
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,151
Start..
- Open up. Lift the curtain.

108
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,393
What the..

109
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:02,344
Hey Champ!... Come quickly.

110
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,139
Your entry's next.

111
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,851
Me?
- Yes. Come quickly.

112
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,582
You're late.

113
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,747
You aren't even ready.

114
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,486
I told you a thousand
times...you will get me fired.

115
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,695
No touching here, uncle..
- Adjust your dhoti.

116
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,697
What's my name in this play?

117
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,630
Dushyant.
Shankunta
a's Dushyant.

118
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,167
Go on now.
Go.

119
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:28,798
Shakuntala...l am your Dushyant,
and you're my Shakun...

120
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,740
Tie it.

121
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,349
You've been drinking again.

122
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,649
Bloody drunkard.

123
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,687
Do you even remember your lines?

124
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,280
I am in love with you, Shakuntala.

125
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,257
Let's go far away.

126
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,325
Hold me tight.

127
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,557
Don't be so shy.

128
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,264
Sorn], I am late.
- Who?

129
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,709
Uncle, it's me.
- Bandya, you?

130
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,303
Yes.
- Then who's that?

131
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,446
Beloved“.

132
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,324
Be
oved's got red underwear.

133
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,891
You want it?

134
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,764
Who are you?

135
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,599
Who sent him here?

136
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,333
Myself Dushyant... 4th Standard,
Failed eight times.

137
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,737
This is so ironic, friends.

138
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,897
In the stow,
Dushyant didn't recognize Shakuntala.

139
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,440
..and now,
Shakuntala doesn't recognize Dushyant.

140
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,310
That's Ta
pade's useless boy.

141
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,475
Hey... you mean Govind Shambhu Talpade.

142
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,608
Be respecting.

143
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,243
Someone throw him out of here.

144
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,583
Maushi.

145
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,793
I am in love with you Shakuntala.

146
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,489
Let's go far away.
- What's this drama?

147
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,331
Get him out.
- Get him out.

148
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:36,664
Out. Out.
- Who was that?

149
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,293
Who was that?
- Me.

150
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:42,363
Rasca
...you came here to
watch a drama, didn't you?

151
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,464
So watch.

152
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,473
We want a refund.

153
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,373
We want a refund.

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,743
Guard, throw him out.

155
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,477
Maushi, my priceless
head's at stake here.

156
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,517
And he wants a refund.

157
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,211
Get him out.

158
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,619
Get him out.

159
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,679
Let me go.

160
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,248
Shakuntala you explain them.

161
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,624
Let me go.

162
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,761
MY Slippers.

163
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,573
Stop. Stop.

164
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,919
Someone catch him.

165
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,157
Stop.

166
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,221
Stop him.

167
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,649
Matches.
- Matches?

168
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,120
What do you intend to do?

169
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,417
Blow up his lordship's bungalow?

170
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,550
When the time comes, you'll
know what my intentions are?. - What?

171
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,649
No...No...

172
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,696
Well... what will be messier?

173
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:16,461
..your Lordship or his shit?

174
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,799
You're acting smart
I will search you.

175
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,840
You don't know what a fierce
policeman (Foolishman) I am.

176
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:25,172
It tickles.
- Quiet. Stand straight.

177
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,542
I assure you, Mr. Shastnj.

178
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,605
In my custody you'll
be laughing much less.

179
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,880
Wow, sir...you're looking
like Sherlock Holmes.

180
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,487
Chatterjee, Chatter less...and
arrest him. - Yes, sir.

181
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,399
6-0!

182
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,302
6-0!

183
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,203
6-0!

184
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,263
6-0!

185
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,275
Keep running...Ta
pade!

186
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:58,934
6-0!

187
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,872
6-0!

188
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,776
Get up.
- Govind Shambhu Ta
pade..

189
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,581
..is that the way to
wake people up? - What?

190
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:09,814
Did you hear that, Kaushaliya?

191
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:13,346
Now your ill-mannered
son will teach us manners?

192
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,360
What's this?
- I don't know.

193
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,689
You don't know..
How could you know?

194
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,494
Education and you are like
the opposite banks of a river.

195
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:22,829
Give that back.

196
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,664
It wrong to touch other's belongings.

197
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,169
When will you learn, Govind Shambhu?

198
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,900
And who are you? An idol of learning?

199
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,506
At first it was just
a little fondness for alcohol.

200
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,135
But now you're going
to dance girls as well.

201
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,577
Right?

202
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,775
This is the first time
anyone from the Talpade family“.

203
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,875
..was found at a dance girl's place.

204
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:45,317
You only said...do something
that no one has done before.

205
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,618
And now that I did..

206
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,353
..it's hard for you to pat my back.

207
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,416
Shivy.

208
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,730
Please...just concentrate
on your studies.

209
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,788
You've flunked 8 times.

210
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,424
I can't see it again.

211
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,230
We

...don't get your cataract treated.

212
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,669
And you won't ever see anything again.

213
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,731
Shivy. Quiet. Aren't you ashamed?

214
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,572
What shame, mother?

215
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,306
If he had any shame, he would know..

216
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,780
..that boys half his age
are struggling for independence.

217
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,839
And he's blabbering nonsense.

218
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,347
Brother,
only slaves fight for liberty.

219
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,312
I am free. From here.

220
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,154
And anyway...we don't just
want freedom from the Brithishers.

221
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,285
Grandma needs freedom
from our traditions.

222
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,193
..which made her shave off her hair.

223
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,229
Mother needs freedom from your fun].

224
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,857
Poor woman can't speak.
- See!

225
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,296
Sister-in-law needs
freedom from our society.

226
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,361
Which did not let her study.

227
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,907
And brother...you want freedom too...

228
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,437
From me!

229
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,479
And Govind, you need freedom too..

230
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:42,911
From your orthodoxy.

231
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,308
Because that's the root of all evil.

232
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,613
And after that, we'll no longer beg..

233
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,154
..we would rather snatch
our freedom from the British.

234
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,616
Hey"-

235
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,685
Brigadier Shivy Talpade...
of the buffoon battalion.

236
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,730
Wasn't your horn honking enough..

237
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,594
...that now you have
also started shouting.

238
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:03,498
Not a horn. It's a trumpet.

239
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,601
But, where is it?

240
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,629
Back again to be beaten.

241
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,298
No...No..
 just wanted to see whether..

242
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,130
..you still look
beautiful when I am sober.

243
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,596
Come back in the evening.

244
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,163
Stars don't shine in the day.

245
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:49,371
It's lying on the
table...your English horn.

246
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,242
Champa picked it up from the stage.

247
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,750
And my head?

248
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,787
It's been missing since last night.

249
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,254
I guess that also got left behind.

250
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,486
Did you find it?

251
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,590
You didn't tell me
what you saw. - What?

252
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,190
Do I still look beautiful
after you're sober...or not?

253
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,797
What are you saying?

254
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,567
Liquor is not as
intoxicating as you are.

255
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,138
You look gorgeous.

256
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,436
Those with an empty pocket.

257
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,704
...try charming with their words.

258
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,875
Anyway, I am used to people like you.

259
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,140
Who often speak nonsense
when they're drunk.

260
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:31,147
Don't forget, some people often
speak the truth when they are drunk.

261
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,786
This is Shastn/‘s bag. Check it!

262
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,246
There's no book in here, sir.

263
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,846
Some say he's a scientist.

264
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,716
Some say he's a freedom fighter.

265
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,385
I say he's a bomb-maker.

266
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,726
He's a clown,
and you're too worried about him.

267
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:15,323
E mptY-bag . . .empty stomach . .

268
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,735
Empty mind.
- Empty-bag... Empty mind.

269
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:23,138
They revolted against
the queen, in '57.

270
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,345
Keep an eye on him.
- Sir.

271
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,536
Hey...who's there?

272
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,871
Get down.
- Catch him! Catch him!

273
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:02,272
Get down.
- Wait. Catch him.

274
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,550
Don't push.

275
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:12,723
Oh...
- Oh...what are you doing here?

276
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,316
When did you come back
from Benaras.. - Hey.

277
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,587
First tell me, where's my book?

278
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,823
First you tell me,
how did that book get into my shin?

279
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,559
If they overhear,
we'll be skinned alive.

280
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,534
Excellent progress.

281
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,765
First brothel and now jail.

282
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,465
He's getting crazier by the day.

283
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,601
Getting crazy is the
sign of getting smart

284
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,303
According to Charu Saraswati ji..

285
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:38,372
Look, please don't support him,
Shastry ji.

286
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,476
And next time you find
him lying on the streets..

287
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,248
...I suggest that you take him home.

288
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,846
It's best if all the
lunatics stay together.

289
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,186
But the bail papers are ready, sir.

290
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,285
I came here to bail someone,
and so I will.

291
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,331
Not for that oaf, but Shastn/ instead.

292
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,255
Shastn]?

293
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,426
May I remind you,
sir, that he's a suspect?

294
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,935
He's harmless.

295
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,638
He's a bit eccentric, but harmless.

296
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,799
Make sure it's done.
- Yes.

297
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,367
Bail!

298
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:08,704
Bail!

299
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,407
Bail! Bail! Bail!

300
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,676
Bail!

301
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,686
Thank you.
- Welcome.

302
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,283
You really are stupid.

303
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,456
Sometimes you have
to scratch someone's back..

304
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,793
And then...this one's your own...
Father.

305
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,361
Understood idiot?

306
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,431
Body of iron...brass arms.

307
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,636
Wheels on the 
egs...and a pointed
nose slicing through the air.

308
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,609
I read it somewhere.

309
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,183
Where's my book?

310
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,746
I know I am an idiot.

311
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,914
But in the current situation,
you have to scratch my back.

312
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,351
Give my bail and take your book.

313
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,196
Sir..

314
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,434
What's he making?

315
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,237
Bomb or something?

316
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,272
Shastn/ ji hardly
ever makes his hair..

317
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,779
What can he possibly make?

318
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,405
Thank you.

319
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,578
I think he knows something, this one.

320
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,681
He's playing a game with us.

321
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,326
Hey"-

322
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,572
I didn't bail you
out for free. - Yeah.

323
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,837
I'll deliver your
book at your address.

324
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,502
My address.

325
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,180
The entire British battalion
doesn't know my address.

326
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:52,614
He thinks he can find it.

327
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,879
Can't handle a thing.
Neither his book nor his kite.

328
00:22:54,941 --> 00:23:00,289
Pull...Pull..
- No, friend. I got to let it loose.

329
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:03,759
The Wind's blowing from the west,
the sea.

330
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:08,697
If I tie it here,
it'll keep floating for several hours.

331
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,302
It's not saline.

332
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,632
So the wind isn't
blowing from the sea..

333
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,331
..and it won't keep up for hours.

334
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,332
2-3 minutes more.

335
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,808
5 at the most.

336
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,776
If you want to take a nap..

337
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,871
...then fix two paper wings
on either side of the kite.

338
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,777
They will cut through the wind,
and the kite will keep floating.

339
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,911
Who told you?
- The eagle's wings.

340
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,383
I noticed them while flying kites.

341
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,453
It's the only bird
that can stay in air..

342
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,516
..for a long time without
flapping it's wings.

343
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,227
Got it?

344
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:55,508
Shivy.

345
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,639
Any relation with
that girl means suicide.

346
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,309
Think before you do anything.

347
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:05,347
Sister-in-law,
love cannot be rationalized.

348
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,522
So you broke out of prison.

349
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,526
Someone bailed me out.

350
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,687
This mean someone does love you.

351
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,688
Go on . . .marry her.

352
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,323
What's the problem?

353
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,731
It's social service.

354
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,699
Education to women,
widow-marriage and..

355
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,499
Prostitute-marriage!

356
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,743
I wish your heart was
as big as your vocabulary.

357
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,541
Till yesterday you
barely grew a moustache.

358
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,343
..and now you have full grown horns!

359
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,611
Look...if you want
to stay in this house..

360
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,778
..then, you'll live by my rules.

361
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,788
Change yourself...
or change your house.

362
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,617
Okay.

363
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,424
Let him go!

364
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,223
Last night...he was lying
on the streets, unconscious.

365
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:53,236
People thought he was a beggar
and threw these coins at him.

366
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:02,303
That dance girl has taught
him new means of earning.

367
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,773
We

...whatever it is..

368
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,750
At least it's my hard earned money.

369
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,547
And not taxes extracted
from poor farmers..

370
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,250
..the way you do!

371
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,158
Get out!

372
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,387
Get out!

373
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,133
Shivy!

374
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,319
My dear friend, just watch her dance..

375
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,248
But don't dance to her tunes.

376
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,790
And you just give me money,
not a lecture.

377
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,157
Tailors don't stick pockets
into shins of paupers like us.

378
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,856
And my father used to say..

379
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,259
When one can't change
the direction of the winds...

380
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,528
I know... one should adjust his sails...

381
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,472
No, Simply board another boat.

382
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:08,504
And here you have
a ship waiting for you.

383
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:20,513
Epitome of loyalty!
Have you got my book?

384
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:24,788
Who gave you the address?

385
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,755
Normally dust deposits on books..

386
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,621
..but, there was sand on this one.

387
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,627
And I saw the cover it was wrapped in.

388
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,822
Duek, a special mix
of cotton and canvas...

389
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,525
..which is used in ships and boats.

390
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,461
I scratched my brains
for few moments.

391
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,230
And made my way here.

392
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:43,365
By the way, what are you trying to do?

393
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,308
This is beyond your imagination.

394
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,442
Engine. - What?

395
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,674
En...What?

396
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:54,707
A unique device...
that can pull anything.

397
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,310
By itself.

398
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,754
By itself... but upside down?

399
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,850
Opposite of 'Dev' (God).
- Demon!

400
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,189
Dirty mind.

401
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,086
Dev-Ved.

402
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:07,790
Ved-Dev.

403
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,628
'Ved' means the knowledge of the Gods.

404
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,498
Read it backwards.

405
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,535
Shloka 312, verse 8..

406
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:19,338
'Yuj u r Ved .'

407
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:22,572
Meaning?
- Meaning..

408
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,677
To do something different.

409
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,308
..you have to turn things around.

410
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,750
Understood?

411
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,879
Govind Shambhu Talpade
always talks nonsense.

412
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,679
But there's one thing
he is right about.

413
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,486
He says, after spending a decade..

414
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,290
..with mad ascetics in Beneras,
Shastn/‘s lost his marbles.

415
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:45,131
You've become too cud.

416
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,534
I'll pull your tongue out.

417
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:52,440
Leave the reward for returning
the book, at least lend me some money.

418
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:57,572
Did you see a board outside..
Shastn/ Co-operative Bank?

419
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,707
Leave!

420
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,118
What's behind that cuﬂain?

421
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,624
Why do you care?
Get lost.

422
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,563
Shivy!

423
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:19,433
Shivy! Shivy! Shivy, wait.

424
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,769
Turn the handle of that
machine on the count of three.

425
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,466
Okay?

426
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,400
Yes!

427
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,485
Charu Saraswati ji..

428
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,523
..what else do I turn upside
down to make this engine work?

429
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:19,791
Mr. Shastnj,
can your machine pull anything?

430
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:22,458
Yes, it can.
- Sure?

431
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,795
Yes.

432
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:28,305
Then I suggest
you finish making it quickly.

433
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:32,232
So it can pull the
vehicle of my love..

434
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,303
..back on track.

435
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,174
It's working... chug, chug...chug!

436
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,819
Shivy! Shivy!

437
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,952
Will you work for me?

438
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,387
I will pay you Rs 20 for a month.
Take this.

439
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:55,261
A man in love is good for nothing.

440
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,668
This is all I need.

441
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,267
And in return...

442
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,806
...you can keep this.

443
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,740
It's brass, German-made.

444
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:07,777
Keep it safe.

445
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:12,339
But this engine... How?

446
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:15,511
You didn't need to
turn things upside down.

447
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,350
All you had to do was to
turn the steam back into the engine.

448
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,558
Shloka 318 not 312..

449
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:25,494
Verse 3 not 8. Yajur Ved.

450
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:28,322
See you.

451
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,630
Keep moving. Keep moving.

452
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,567
Keep moving, the show's houseful.

453
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,162
Leave. Go.

454
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:37,263
Champa!

455
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,233
You said the house was full.

456
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,503
What's this?

457
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:42,904
Why?

458
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,746
Can't one man buy all the tickets?

459
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:57,890
Madam...will you go out with me?

460
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,660
Sitara sells her dance,
not her evenings.

461
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,724
No one can put a price
to anything which is hers.

462
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,565
Neither her evenings..

463
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,732
..nor her an.

464
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,865
You...Who..

465
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:17,142
So...where will you take me?

466
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:26,186
It's light. That means it can fly.

467
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,703
Melt it.
- This?

468
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,330
Yes, melt it down.

469
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,874
Shastn/ ji, what are you doing?
Give it back.

470
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,933
You sold it to me.

471
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,873
But it's meant for playing.

472
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:53,644
Maybe for you,
but it's just brass for me.

473
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,451
Hey..

474
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,454
Praise the Lord!

475
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:10,159
Hail the Lord!

476
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,795
Hail the Lord!

477
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,239
So tell me disciples...

478
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,600
What did Lord Hanuman fly with?

479
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,575
My trumpet

480
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,408
His trumpet.

481
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,243
His trumpet?
- Yes.

482
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,516
But, Shastn/ ji,
wasn't that his trumpet? - It was.

483
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,554
But he sold it to me.
And I paid him for it.

484
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,145
Later he stole it and ran away.

485
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,656
What's going to happen to this boy?

486
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,659
But, Shastn/ ji...he hasn't
come home for a long time.

487
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,322
I'll see whether he did or not.

488
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,161
This is Shivi's room.

489
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,361
Shastn/ ji, mind your back.

490
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:51,706
Maybe I don't look that way,
but I am still agile.

491
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,876
And Young -

492
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,825
Shastn/ ji.

493
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,298
Did you get hurt?

494
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:21,270
He may not look that way,
but he's agile.

495
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,771
And young.
- Be quiet.

496
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:27,610
But the trumpet?
- The trumpet was made of brass.

497
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:32,343
But your son is a gem.
And I want him.

498
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,378
Good you chucked him out.

499
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,613
Because one doesn't
learn to fly in the nest.

500
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,351
He'll fly.

501
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,756
He'll fly.

502
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,493
He'll fly.

503
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,726
He'll fly.

504
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,398
Shivy will fly.

505
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,931
Will Shivy grow wings?

506
00:34:56,195 --> 00:35:00,166
Oh God...l wonder where he is.

507
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,346
Champ...bring a cup of tea.

508
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,208
One? Sitara never shares her tea.

509
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:11,346
I don't feel like.
- You don't.

510
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,790
No mood or no money?

511
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,757
Get two..
- I can't let my darling pay.

512
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,318
Only one.

513
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,859
Me...

514
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:23,529
Your darling?

515
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,262
Men like you come by the dozens.

516
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,334
We

...what can you do?

517
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,639
Whatever you say?
- Whatever I say?

518
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:34,404
Yes.

519
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,142
And what if you don't.

520
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:38,647
Then I won't show
my face to you again.

521
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,316
And what if I do it?

522
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,586
Then...anything you want.

523
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,818
I am quite a rascal...

524
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:49,291
I can ask for anything.
- I see.

525
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,521
What will you ask for?

526
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,762
A kiss?

527
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:06,641
Accepted.

528
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,243
On your lips?

529
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,746
Hmmm

530
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,877
Really?

531
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,747
Don't get so excited.

532
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,116
The reward's quite big..

533
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,354
..so you will have
to do something big for it.

534
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,426
You mean...there's a condition.

535
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,355
Conditions!

536
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,628
Three of them.

537
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,294
First one?

538
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,798
Spell it.

539
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:40,338
Make these two glasses full.

540
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,872
Second condition.

541
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,116
"For you the moons
and stars I'll pluck."

542
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,815
“And even break a British officer's
tooth, if you order my lady luck.“

543
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:28,381
Go get me a British officer's tooth!

544
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,462
So officer, you've a tooth ache.

545
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:39,435
I need one. One tooth.
- I'm okay.

546
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,528
No.. I'm okay.

547
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,765
Hold on.

548
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,739
Get off me.
- The blessing of tooth-fairy

549
00:37:44,797 --> 00:37:47,471
Darling, spread your legs. Good.

550
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,882
Come on..

551
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,691
Was your mother also like this?

552
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,289
I remember nothing.

553
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,528
Except that there was someone..

554
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,534
..who would oil my
hair and tie a braid.

555
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:19,733
Must be my mother.

556
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,815
By the way, you forgot all
about the conditions and the reward.

557
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,649
Shivy never forgets anything.

558
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,812
And I can't collect my reward..

559
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,480
..without completing
all the conditions.

560
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:35,886
So...your third condition.

561
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,219
<i>Skate never {urges mo.</i>

562
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,229
I will tell you my
third condition too..

563
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,665
But when the time's right.

564
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:44,896
Crazy boy..

565
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,137
Marry this crazy boy.

566
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,229
I admit he is a bit stupid, a foo
..

567
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:51,132
..but, he is one in a million.

568
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,804
Marry him.

569
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,676
Do you know what you're saying?
- Yes, marry him!

570
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,237
What a childish demand?

571
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,577
Marry him!

572
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:02,551
Dance girls don't get married.
- Why not?

573
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,246
Marry him.

574
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,687
You're a blue-blood, and I'm a harlot.

575
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,224
Marry him.

576
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,191
Our worlds are different, Shivy.

577
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:11,694
He will change everything, marry him.

578
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,525
Even if everything changes..

579
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:16,497
..it can't change the fact,
that I'm of a lower caste.

580
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,262
And...l am of a higher caste.

581
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,825
Scores settled.

582
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,306
You don't settle scores
in love like this.

583
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:27,208
There are no scores in love.

584
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,815
Get some sleep.

585
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,147
Will you then marry me?

586
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:47,491
When I wake up,
you'll be here...right?

587
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,668
Sitarat is only good for some fun.

588
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,235
Not for falling in love.

589
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,179
Don't try to find me.

590
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:40,641
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

591
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:50,752
"After all what's
the cure...for this pain?"

592
00:41:52,477 --> 00:42:00,760
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

593
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,399
Drinking on the streets?

594
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:10,670
You dare offend the law..

595
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:14,370
..that too in officer
Chatterjee's area? - What is..

596
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,842
...the punishment for this offence.
- 6 months of jail.

597
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:24,447
And...for breaking a heart

598
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:33,896
“I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...“

599
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:43,733
“I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...“

600
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:52,280
“I have hopes of
faithfulness from the one...“

601
00:42:52,337 --> 00:43:00,586
"who knows not what faith is"

602
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:10,563
"who knows not what faith is"

603
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:20,608
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

604
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:27,334
"O naive head,
what has befallen you?"

605
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:01,845
This is no time to drink tea.

606
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:05,211
Yeah, this is the
time to get high, rather.

607
00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:07,757
Should I offer you some more liquor?

608
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,685
You brought me here to lecture me?

609
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,560
I took your father's advice.

610
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:17,266
If I find you lying somewhere..

611
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,159
...I should bring you home.

612
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:20,362
And so I did.

613
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:23,167
Why are you doing this?
For me?

614
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,265
Not for you...

615
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,335
for myself.

616
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,146
I need you.

617
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,709
There's something about you.
- What?

618
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:42,453
Something...that's rare
in humans these days.

619
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,523
It's only found in dogs.

620
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:50,694
You've a specialty,
and that's loyalty.

621
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:54,269
Whatever you do,
you do it with a tinge of loyalty.

622
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:58,468
Whether it was the trumpet, or Sitara.

623
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,403
What's the point?

624
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:04,245
She's gone.

625
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:08,412
She hasn't gone beyond
the moon and the stars, right?

626
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,189
There are some things,
which no matter how far they are...

627
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:14,622
..can be seen.

628
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,285
Moon and the stars are in the sky.

629
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:26,900
So why don't you
build a home in the sky?

630
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,736
High above...in the clouds.

631
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:35,702
And when you'll look down..

632
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:39,146
..she will be looking at you too.

633
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:41,674
But how will I get there?

634
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,216
On a plane.

635
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,159
Let's build a plane together.

636
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,626
Hold on. Okay.

637
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:53,362
Plane...
- Yes.

638
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,556
'Pushpak Vimaan.'
(Air borne plane)

639
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,657
People will use to travel around.

640
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:59,429
From here to there..

641
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:01,198
Like a flying ship.

642
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,535
Like a ship that sails on waten.

643
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:06,098
“Similarly, an air-plane
that shall sail on clouds?

644
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:09,509
What did you say?

645
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,371
An air-plane.

646
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,145
An air-plane.

647
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:18,249
Wow! What a name?

648
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,820
Yes. Air-plane.

649
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,487
I was the one who consumed
liquor and you've gotten drunk.

650
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:27,792
No one's built an
air-plane in the world.

651
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,391
What a man!

652
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,343
I am sober again.

653
00:46:53,612 --> 00:46:58,357
I am very close...yet quite far.

654
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,226
The English don't want
me to complete my invention.

655
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:03,664
They can kill me anytime.

656
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:06,794
Your life's in threat
because of an airplane.

657
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,271
It might be just an
airplane for the people.

658
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,365
A scientific marvel.

659
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:16,172
But it's a revolution for me.

660
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,112
It's the ray of hope,
which shall encourage..

661
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,616
..these enslaved people, that.

662
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,744
..we're as good as anyone else.

663
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,118
We can be independent too.

664
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:29,291
They can restrain us on earth.

665
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:34,391
But how can they stop
us from soaring in the sky?

666
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,493
Shivy, Indians will fly...

667
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,398
..towards an independent future.

668
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:43,701
The first flying man in
the world...will be an Indian.

669
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,239
That's my dream.

670
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,439
Would you like to see?

671
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,474
Would you like to see
my dream with your eyes?

672
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,422
Come on.

673
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,536
Now...jump-

674
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:16,733
Come on.

675
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,197
What are you saying?

676
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:19,606
It's nothing, Just go.
- No.

677
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,405
Put on your glasses.

678
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:27,449
Will you get me killed?

679
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,456
Pull the rope!

680
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,495
Pull the rope!

681
00:49:04,476 --> 00:49:07,389
Shastn/ Ji, I am your assistant,
but who is mine.

682
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,721
You also need an assistant?

683
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,493
But who?

684
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,586
Shastn/ Ji, me!

685
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,720
"To shine like a star..."

686
00:50:13,545 --> 00:50:18,494
"..you have to burn like one."

687
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,290
"To shine like a diamond..."

688
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:30,171
"Be ready to be cut like one."

689
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:35,706
“To be immortal like time...“

690
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:40,841
"You have to be on
a constant move."

691
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:54,524
Oh; isn't it the same book?

692
00:50:54,953 --> 00:50:56,864
It's not just a book,
it's a treasure.

693
00:50:56,921 --> 00:51:02,200
Treasure full of details
about making an airplane.

694
00:51:02,694 --> 00:51:04,731
I never showed it to anyone.

695
00:51:04,796 --> 00:51:06,469
For I couldn't find
anyone trustworthy.

696
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,477
I built a steam-engine.

697
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,207
First with helium,
then I tried with nitrogen.

698
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:14,341
But everything failed .
Gasoline.

699
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:18,654
I need you, Shastn/ ji, not this book.

700
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:21,151
Keep trying out your ideas.

701
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:24,284
And I will be right beside you,
as your trusted aide.

702
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:35,265
But...the British should never
lay their hands on this book.

703
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,169
Remember that story. .?

704
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:39,538
...where the beast's heart
was in the parrot's body.

705
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,578
My head dwells in this.

706
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:44,812
I am alive as long as this exists.

707
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:48,316
If this is dead, so am I.

708
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:05,892
Heads!

709
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:08,328
This is cheating. You always win.

710
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,203
Look...we can toss the coin..

711
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:14,539
..but only He decides whether
it'll be heads or tails.

712
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,374
When it's your turn to fly“.

713
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,416
..this coin will definitely favor you.

714
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,747
Where did these dark clouds come from?

715
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,717
It can't be gasoline.

716
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:34,154
From Lanka to Ayodhya, how could Lord
Ram not encounter any dark clouds?

717
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,657
It's clearly written
in the scriptures.

718
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,660
Light yellow is fuel's
colour... It's not a name.

719
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:40,626
So you know think more than me?

720
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:43,529
All I know is that we're depending
too much on the scriptures.

721
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,626
Trying to build an air-plane
based on old mythological books?

722
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,475
Meaning...year 1200

723
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,806
1000.

724
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,904
8 miles..

725
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:00,240
And Bhanu..
- I know.. Sun!

726
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:01,510
Now multiply all three.

727
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,518
1200x1000x8... what do we have?

728
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,712
9,60,00,000 miles.

729
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,413
The distance between earth and sun.

730
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,820
And these things are mentioned.

731
00:54:07,879 --> 00:54:11,326
..in a mythological
book like these.

732
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,626
Mr. Shastn/mthese
things can impress kids..

733
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,323
..but can't make an air-plane fly.

734
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,890
You don't trust me, do you?
- No, I don't.

735
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:21,262
So leave.
- Fine...l am going.

736
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,429
Leave.

737
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:25,436
Trying to teach me!

738
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:41,655
So you're back.

739
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:44,192
Back in 4.5 hours.

740
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,428
Last time you took 6.

741
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:49,355
Don't make me furious,
or I'll leave again.

742
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,822
So go.

743
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,595
Who's stopping you?
Leave now.

744
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,261
You go. - This is my house,
why should I?

745
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,929
What are you saying?
- Be quiet.

746
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,211
When did this arrive?
You didn't tell me.

747
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:05,542
There's nothing to say.

748
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:11,382
The king of Baroda
has denied our request.

749
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:18,256
Shivy...seems like our
destiny is out for a stroll.

750
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:24,590
Shastn/ ji, one shouldn't
depend on destiny too much.

751
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,728
Even the unfortunate do have a fate.

752
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:34,400
You don't look stupid, but you are.

753
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,138
Man will fly.

754
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:40,382
Fairytale.

755
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:43,476
In real life,
fain/tales don't come true.

756
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,644
I am sorry,
I don't believe in your claims.

757
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,254
But you believe in Lord Ram, right?

758
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,485
The 'Pushpak Vimaan'..

759
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:53,654
..in which Lord Ram
flew from Lanka to Ayodhya.

760
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,595
You're talking about mythology.

761
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:56,631
Myth...

762
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:59,825
That's a lie.
Unfortunately, your highness.

763
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,167
These stories have
no relation with reality.

764
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,763
Even we've read in scriptures.

765
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,435
That God's could
communicate from a distance.

766
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,871
And Graham Bell's telephone
does the same thing.

767
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:12,774
Railways,
motor cars...phonogram, telegram.

768
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:15,181
All these fain/tales
are now coming true.

769
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,480
Because we're unraveling
the mysteries behind them.

770
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,249
Mysteries will keep unraveling“.

771
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,221
..and slowly all these
tales will turn into reality.

772
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:25,694
His highness,
if what we built wasn't commendable..

773
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:29,459
..then the British
wouldn't be after us.

774
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,893
You mean...the English are ignorant.

775
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,728
..and you two are smart

776
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:40,504
Have we ever built
anything before them?

777
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:49,412
Aryabhatt invented 'Zero'
before the rest of the world.

778
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,543
'Zero' .

779
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:54,681
Saint Kannad...discovered an
'Atom' before the rest of the world.

780
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:55,689
'Atom.'

781
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,818
5,000 years ago,
Diamond was discovered in India.

782
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:02,660
And I reckon the British...
didn't even exist back then.

783
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,200
Your Highness, do you know..

784
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,759
..why fain/tales
don't turn into reality?

785
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:10,828
Because in a haste to grow up..

786
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,336
..we forget to think like kids.

787
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,311
Man shall fly... an air-plane shall fly.

788
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:19,746
We just need your help
to turn this tale into reality.

789
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,478
And yes...we're not stupid.

790
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,377
Just a little eccentric.

791
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:30,449
How much money do
these eccentrics need?

792
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,594
"Bless me with your grace."

793
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:36,222
"Lord smiles through your face."

794
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:41,168

a gem at your place."

00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:50,868
"You are a saint with Godly traitsq"

797
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:05,487
"Cannons will be fired...in our honor."

798
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:09,829
"And those cannons will be official"

799
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:15,601
"Cannons will be fired...in our honor."

800
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:20,304
"Those cannons will be official"

801
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:25,740
"Someday our faces..."

802
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:31,211
"will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

803
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:41,855
"will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real"

804
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:54,432
"You and only you"

805
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:59,504
"You are the pen as well
as the ink in which it is dipped"

806
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:03,608
"You are the alphabet
as well as the script)"

807
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:06,553
"You are the kingdom as well its king"

808
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,352
"You are benevolent, as well as cruel"

809
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:14,385
"You are free as well as like
a bird which has lost its wing"

810
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:17,160
"You're the punishment
and the relief."

811
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,667
"You are happiness as well as grief"

812
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:24,536
"You are the whole
army as well as its chief"

"Along with the Sun we
will enjoy biscuits and bun)"

814

"Moon will also get addicted
to Cutting chai coz it will be fun)"

815
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:59,731
“From the shelf of the
sky...we'll pick some stars.“

816
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:04,779
"Turning them into lanterns"

817
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:09,545
"...we shall hang them on our door"

818
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:14,350
"Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes"

819
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:19,360
"The world will become
a miraculous place, it's a deal"

820
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:24,663
"Wear the goggles
of dreams on your eyes"

821
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,571
"The world will become a
miraculous place, it's a deal)"

822
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:34,734
"Someday our faces..."

01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:10,539
“...will be printed on
a postal stamp, for real“

831
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,519
Move. Move...what's going on?

832
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:29,394
Quiet!

833
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,566
It's not a bomb,
it's a flying machine.

834
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:39,266
That's what my sources have told me.

835
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,934
And that too, based on the Vedas.

836
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,439
That's what my sources
have told me, sir.

837
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,640
VVilson...l believe
you're up for promotion.

838
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:51,377
And if my sources are right,
be prepared for a transfer.

839
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:55,319
Sir...monkeys cannot make machines.

840
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,655
At least not without metal.

841
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:58,819
Sir...

842
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,755
Let me see how will the plane fly“?

843
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:13,233
No one will sell metal to us.

844
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,334
No shopkeeper or any junk-seller.

845
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,401
A monkey can stop jumping around..

846
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:19,607
..but the British will
never stop interfering.

847
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,880
How will I build the wings now?

848
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,185
With my..
- Let's use wood?

849
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:33,622
Who are you writing to? Your mother?

850
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:40,533
Why don't you ever post it?

851
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,764
I told you ‘Wood’.

852
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,271
Don't worn].

853
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,503
I'll post it when the time's right.

854
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:50,674
Whenever I talk to him..

855
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:52,941
..it feels like I
am talking to a mirror.

856
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:59,580
Me as well...

857
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:03,748
I couldn't say anything either.

858
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:07,328
Come on,
we'll make the wings out of wood.

859
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,762
We made it of wood the last time.

860
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,493
But it broke under the weight.

861
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:15,826
What do I do with the king's money?

862
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:19,531
The British never learn,
so we won't either.

863
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:21,473
No one will sell metal to you..

864
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,842
...but, they will certainly
tender you coins.

865
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,141
Coins?

866
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,851
Sir, it's considered sacred.
Melting it would be a sin. - I know.

867
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,620
I will be the sinner.

868
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:41,356
Make it in this shape.

869
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,257
It'll be done!

870
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,336
Father...

871
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,175
Give the young man first.
- No, no.

872
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:02,683
Sir, guests are like God.

873
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,517
If you don't eat,
then I'll be the sinner for sure.

874
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:08,284
Go on.

875
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,485
I'll eat.
But first...do you go to school?

876
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,891
She's in class 2.

877
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,222
What's your name?
- Sitara.

878
01:04:17,488 --> 01:04:19,695
Recite the bird poem for him.

879
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:23,728
Collecting little by little.
She delicately makes her nest.

880
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:27,833
Smiles through winters,
summers and rains.

881
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:31,209
Smiles in even] test.

882
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,206
Sitara Devi...l finished building it.

883
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,282
It's ready.

884
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,818
When I pour gasoline...
the engine will start to roar.

885
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,519
And this thing will churn around,
cutting through the wind.

886
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,559
And due the air pressure,
the air-plane..

887
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:47,857
...will fly up in the air.

888
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,696
Everyone shall applaud .

889
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:55,801
But I didn't come
here to tell you that?

890
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:02,135
I came here to say that...
I feel scared.

891
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,205
Very scared .

892
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,577
This time when you come
back I won't let you leave.

893
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,812
Can't you come back?

894
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,830
Come back!

895
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,596
Come back!

896
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:37,504
What are you wearing, Mr. Shastnj.

897
01:05:37,568 --> 01:05:40,549
Wear this green coat today.

898
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,639
No.

899
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:46,821
I'll wear that the clay
I'll take-off in the air-plane.

900
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:52,683
Or the day I fly off myself.

901
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:57,926
This one's fine for today.

902
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,326
Come on.

903
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:12,873
What happened?

904
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,377
Will it fly high enough so that.

905
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,146
..Sitara can watch it from anywhere?

906
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:20,218
Hey...You said so.

907
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:27,158
At 10:22...the sunrays will
make a 48 degree triangle.

908
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:30,357
..and the gasoline
will boil in the engine.

909
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:34,162
The air-plane will
fly...at exactly 10:22.

910
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,704
On that note...say cheese!

911
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,399
Glory to..
- Tilak!

912
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:41,670
Glory to..
- Tilak!

913
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:43,211
Glory to..
- Tilak!

914
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,246
Glory to..
- Mother India!

915
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,804
Tilak!
- Yes.

916
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,815
I heard an air-plane's
going to fly here.

917
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,250
Did you see it?

918
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:52,480
Hope it didn't take-off yet?

919
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:56,586
You're here to see our air-plane?

920
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:01,461
No...to witness the
first flight of freedom.

921
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,780
Sir, why do you think the
Viceroy called us here?

922
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,942
I'm very sure it's
about those two Indians.

923
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:43,175
I warned you about them.

924
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:47,817
Good morning, your highness.

925
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:55,729
Still biter..
- Do you know why, Governor?

926
01:10:57,955 --> 01:11:01,869
India is a poor land
of uneducated triba
's..

927
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,529
..and snake charmers and Sadhus.

928
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,165
In colonizing, it is we..

929
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,637
..who have done them a favor.

930
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:12,703
It's taken us years to
paint that image in the west.

931
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:14,578
And if a news like this gets out now..

932
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:16,551
..that image will be shattered.

933
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,485
It seems to me,
that right under your bloody noses...

934
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,079
...these Indians have been building..

935
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,090
..some kind of flying machine.

936
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,784
And what have you been doing?

937
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,122
Snoring.

938
01:11:26,817 --> 01:11:29,491
Captain,
put him behind bars immediately.

939
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:32,500
And what?
Make him into a national hero?

940
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,066
You need to be clever,
but I want that book.

941
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:39,903
I want my tea to taste sweet.

942
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:44,010
Give me the number six spanner.

943
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,946
Kaka, the number six spanner.

944
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:55,582
Shastn/ Ji,
I can handle this simple machine.

945
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:57,785
But you take charge
of that complex one.

946
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,588
I wonder what he's doing.

947
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:00,889
<i>Skate! Skate!</i>

948
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,491
Shivy! Two tickets for Kolkata.

949
01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:10,694
Tagore's called for us.

950
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:13,071
He wants to honor us.

951
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,075
S hivy. . .tell me something .

952
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:24,618
Are you sure...it was her.

953
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,013
Fine...
Narayan, are you finished yet?

954
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:33,185
Hurry up... We've to go
find an aunt for your uncle.

955
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:35,759
For the wedding you'll
need money, sir.

956
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:41,462
Two rupees...is that
what they are paying for..

957
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:43,129
The Star Inventor!

958
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,572
A National Hero, is it?

959
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:48,776
What do you say to 5000 rupees..

960
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,970
...with a single stroke of the pen.

961
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:53,147
I need the book.

962
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:59,611
And I think...right now
you need something to eat.

963
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:02,450
Samosa!

964
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,428
Too hot.

965
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:11,728
Hot means steaming
hot...or hot means spicy.

966
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:13,062
Miser Englishmen.

967
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,866
They make a single
word do the work of two!

968
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:22,000
But thankfully, we've two words.

969
01:13:22,099 --> 01:13:26,673
You choose one, yes or no!

970
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:30,707
Mr. Shastnj, 6000 is the
absolute limit I can offer you.

971
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:34,085
The most I can offer you is this.

972
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:35,452
'Ja
ebi'.

973
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:40,088
I will take it, but the Viceroy
won't take no for an answer.

974
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,756
Othervvise...He'

 make
your life the way you like it.

975
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:45,595
Hot and spicy.

976
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:48,063
Good day to you, Mr. Shastnj.

977
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:50,695
Good day, sir.

978
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:59,846
Shivy...a simple machine..

979
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,507
..tightened the noose
around their neck.

980
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:05,879
When we really fly on a plane..

981
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,080
. .Then they will. .

982
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:10,750
Freak out in their rants
and leak out in their pants!

983
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:20,527
Don't let this chance go by.

984
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,798
Or you will be fixing
machines all your life like me.

985
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:23,871
Run!

986
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:52,826
Where's Sitara?

987
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:56,765
One star sets and the other rises.

988
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,669
That's the tradition here.

989
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,872
Where's Sitara?

990
01:15:02,132 --> 01:15:05,670
It's easier to find
the address of clouds.

991
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,111
A particular lane...or an area maybe.

992
01:15:08,405 --> 01:15:10,908
But dance girls are difficult to find.

993
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,477
Where's Sitara?

994
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:39,670
The day she stopped performing...
we bid her farewell.

995
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:44,914
Come on, Champa. Your entry.

996
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:56,725
6/17...Pati
 Chowk. Dadar

997
01:16:06,096 --> 01:16:13,571
“I offer my life to you.“

998
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:21,044
“I offer my life to you.“

999
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:28,894
“I offer my life to you.“

1000
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:38,771
“I don't know anything
else as a prayer?“

1001
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:48,772
“O naive heart...what's befallen you?“

1002
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,083
Haven't got rid of the habit
of climbing through windows?

1003
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,755
You never made a relation
that allowed me through the door.

1004
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:58,957
Why did you leave?

1005
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,021
You had fallen in love with me.

1006
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:05,866
Wanted to marn/ me.

1007
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,127
And you?

1008
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:10,132
It may be easier to bind water.

1009
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:13,763
But dance girls don't get married...

1010
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,777
So why did you come back that day?

1011
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:21,148
That wasn't the first day...you
just spotted me that day.

1012
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:22,542
I noticed you many times.

1013
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,550
..in the market with Shastn/ ji.

1014
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:29,652
I even stood under your window.
- Why didn't you come up?

1015
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:34,886
I couldn't climb up pipes, like you,

1016
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:45,363
Maybe dance girls don't,
but cotton-cleaners do get married.

1017
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:48,042
Marry him.

1018
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:50,673
I am not beautiful anymore.

1019
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,008
You never were.

1020
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,412
Marry him.

1021
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:57,884
I no longer have the same grace,
or attitude.

1022
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,544
Marry him.

1023
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:02,079
I am neck-deep in debt.
- Marry him.

1024
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:03,749
You built an air-plane.
- Marry him.

1025
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,052
The first one in the world.
- Marry him.

1026
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,027
Your pictures get
published in the papers.

1027
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,427
I will leave everything.
Marry me.

1028
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,897
Marry me.

1029
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,747
<i>Skate 11...</i>

1030
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:34,550
<i>Skate!</i>

1031
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:37,551
Can I get some more time?

1032
01:18:37,614 --> 01:18:38,991
I've run out of pages of my ledger..

1033
01:18:39,082 --> 01:18:42,461
...but you don't seem to
run out of time to repay my debt.

1034
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:45,430
You say you don't have money.

1035
01:18:45,789 --> 01:18:47,791
And here you are..
- Brother..

1036
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:50,736
Hands to yourself.
- Old flame?

1037
01:18:51,528 --> 01:18:52,871
I am not new to her either.

1038
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:54,068
Didn't you tell him?

1039
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:57,374
Unpaid rent for three years.

1040
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,573
Food , clothing . . .etcetera.

1041
01:18:59,636 --> 01:19:01,138
Women are expensive to maintain.

1042
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:02,111
Yeah.

1043
01:19:02,372 --> 01:19:04,784
Fine. You don't have money, right?

1044
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,390
So...how about doing
me some favor too.

1045
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:12,483
Hey..
Just tell me the figures.

1046
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:15,155
4,332 rupees is the principal.

1047
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,397
You can add up the
interest on your own!

1048
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:54,094
It happens.

1049
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:59,533
It often happens.

1050
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:08,633
And then...l am not different
enough to escape this fate.

1051
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,137
I had to trust someone.

1052
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:16,044
Don't be sad.

1053
01:21:19,843 --> 01:21:22,517
I didn't feel offended.

1054
01:21:29,586 --> 01:21:31,122
I am also human after all.

1055
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,125
Shedding tears are normal.

1056
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:59,119
So much money...

1057
01:21:59,716 --> 01:22:00,922
Where?

1058
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,731
Shivy?

1059
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:32,152
Naru, where's Shashtri ji?

1060
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:36,085
He left in the morning
wearing his green English coat.

1061
01:22:36,386 --> 01:22:37,490
I thought.

1062
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:41,933
'I will wear this the day
I take off in the air-plane.'

1063
01:22:42,592 --> 01:22:46,096
'Or the day...l fly myself.'

1064
01:22:51,768 --> 01:22:52,838
Kaka!

1065
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:54,711
Kaka!

1066
01:24:37,473 --> 01:24:38,816
Shastn/ ji?

1067
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:46,950
My friend, my guru, my teacher..

1068
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:51,862
He believed in me when
Even I didn't believe in myself.

1069
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,961
And do you know what I did?

1070
01:24:57,026 --> 01:24:58,767
I shattered his faith.

1071
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:03,474
I stole his book which
was dearer to him than his life.

1072
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,141
And killed a man...

1073
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:08,879
...who gave me my identity.

1074
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:13,582
I am a murderer.

1075
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:15,655
I am a murderer.

1076
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:17,725
I am a murderer.
I am a murderer.

1077
01:25:17,747 --> 01:25:19,556
I am a murderer.

1078
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,751
Kaka.

1079
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:49,782
Why did you come here?

1080
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,558
Don't you know I am a thief?

1081
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,092
Go. Go home now!

1082
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:58,429
You did it for me, Shivy.

1083
01:25:58,788 --> 01:26:01,894
I am the murderer, not you.

1084
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,064
What did you bring?
- Nothing.

1085
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:09,040
What's written on that paper?

1086
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:10,906
That your uncle is a murderer.

1087
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:18,418
I brought offerings for you.

1088
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:22,719
And that will happen..

1089
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:27,725
“Only when you fulfill
Shastry ji's dreams.

1090
01:26:28,451 --> 01:26:31,762
Shastn/ Ji said,
"Never leave your uncle,

1091
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:33,858
Don't ever leave him".

1092
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,892
"Am I your Shivy, right?"

1093
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,811
<i>'I need you .'</i>

1094
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:48,974
Shivy, you will have
to build the airplane.

1095
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,882
For me...for yourself.

1096
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:54,683
<i>For Shasky '31.</i>

1097
01:26:54,744 --> 01:26:57,782
'At any cost,
you will have to do this.'

1098
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:06,827
Tell your uncle,
on 7th November at 9:24 am..

1099
01:27:06,856 --> 01:27:09,496
..the winds will blow from the sea.

1100
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:11,597
The airplane shall fly.

1101
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:22,541
And this is my third condition.

1102
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:32,655
"From the hunter's clutches..."

1103
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:40,733
"Beyond the cage and its crutches"

1104
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,703
"From the hunter's clutches..."

1105
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,670
"Beyond the cage and its crutches"

1106
01:27:45,695 --> 01:27:50,007
"He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky."

1107
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:54,378
"He'll flap his wings
and soar into the sky."

1108
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:58,919
"Across the clouds, and fast
like the lightening, it will go high"

1109
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:06,085
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1110
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:14,934
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1111
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:23,606
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1112
01:28:24,934 --> 01:28:32,011
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1113
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:48,727
'The day it's your turn to fly,
this coin will definitely fly alone.'

1114
01:29:13,049 --> 01:29:19,000
"Sharpen your all your weapons."

1115
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:24,399
"Sharpen your all your weapons."

1116
01:29:26,062 --> 01:29:28,008
"We'll live our dreams too."

1117
01:29:28,097 --> 01:29:30,577
"We'll shape it with hard work."

1118
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,475
"We'll live our dreams too."

1119
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,810
"We'll shape it with hard work."

1120
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:40,650
"You're one in a million."

1121
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:47,925
"You're one in a million."

1122
01:29:47,983 --> 01:29:54,798
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1123
01:29:56,759 --> 01:30:03,870
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1124
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:12,417
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1125
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:21,085
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1126
01:30:22,852 --> 01:30:30,498
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1127
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:58,962
I am sure it's not gasoline.

1128
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,064
Out of money and no clue of the fuel.

1129
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:08,642
Whether I make this airplane or not..

1130
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:11,678
..But I will definitely
make a new record for failing.

1131
01:31:15,471 --> 01:31:17,542
Are you asleep?

1132
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:19,848
With your glasses on?

1133
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:22,549
Dreams seem clearer.

1134
01:31:24,847 --> 01:31:26,952
What are you thinking?

1135
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:30,825
Building a toy is one thing..

1136
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:34,026
..but building a real
airplane is different.

1137
01:31:34,123 --> 01:31:36,467
And making it fly.

1138
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:37,803
What?

1139
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:40,004
I mean...a person will sit in it.

1140
01:31:40,062 --> 01:31:41,735
So the weight will be double.

1141
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,108
How can gasoline make it fly?

1142
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:47,704
A mouse can run on peanuts,
but not an elephant.

1143
01:31:48,103 --> 01:31:50,640
So...how will this fly?

1144
01:31:51,573 --> 01:31:52,779
You don't know.

1145
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,412
But there must be someone..

1146
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:58,487
..who knows what fuel
will this plane use?

1147
01:31:58,514 --> 01:31:59,925
You're correct.

1148
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:03,720
Shastn/ ji often
used to mention a name..

1149
01:32:04,153 --> 01:32:05,632
Charu Saraswati!

1150
01:32:33,816 --> 01:32:35,090
Charu Ji.

1151
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:38,387
Charu Ji.

1152
01:32:47,129 --> 01:32:50,804
If you want fuel, then you'll
have to answer my five questions.

1153
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:53,473
..in the opposite way.

1154
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,708
Not wrong, but opposite.

1155
01:33:00,643 --> 01:33:05,149
If you answer any question correctly,
I will leave.

1156
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:07,159
First question?

1157
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:11,421
What's essential
for humans to sun/ive?

1158
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:13,433
Air or water?

1159
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:15,595
Hope.

1160
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:20,739
What hurts the most?

1161
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:23,636
Lies or humiliation?

1162
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:25,568
Disloyalty.

1163
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:28,572
What is more frightful?

1164
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:30,981
Death or poverty?

1165
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:33,046
Failure!

1166
01:33:36,912 --> 01:33:38,516
Your fifth question is?

1167
01:33:38,547 --> 01:33:41,892
No, it's the fourth, not fifth?

1168
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:45,955
You lost?
- How?

1169
01:33:46,021 --> 01:33:47,728
You gave the right answer.

1170
01:33:48,757 --> 01:33:51,567
This is cheating.
Absolutely unfair.

1171
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:55,608
Mr. Shastn/ respected you, and..
- You? Shivy?

1172
01:33:56,398 --> 01:33:57,536
Shivy?

1173
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,571
Shastn/ had told me that
you will definitely come.

1174
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:05,109
He said you will unravel
the mysteries that he couldn't.

1175
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,420
I could never understand.

1176
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:13,085
Whether he loved you
or believed in you more.

1177
01:34:14,683 --> 01:34:16,594
Are you his son?

1178
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:17,991
Yes.

1179
01:34:18,187 --> 01:34:20,428
A useless son of a talented father.

1180
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:28,101
Even I don't know the solutions, son.

1181
01:34:29,465 --> 01:34:33,880
The scriptures only have questions,
not answers.

1182
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:37,941
The answers lie within us.

1183
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,983
It flows...but it's not water.

1184
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:45,921
It shines...but it's not silver.

1185
01:34:46,615 --> 01:34:50,757
4121...the fuel.

1186
01:34:52,755 --> 01:34:55,429
Go. . .fly your airplane!

1187
01:34:55,457 --> 01:34:56,834
Fly your airplane!

1188
01:34:56,859 --> 01:35:00,636
Fly your airplane!
Go. Fly your airplane!

1189
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:02,538
Fly your airplane!

1190
01:35:02,598 --> 01:35:03,668
Go.

1191
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:12,582
<i>Kaka. Skate Devi.</i>

1192
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:14,743
Happy Dussera.
- Happy Dussera.

1193
01:35:14,843 --> 01:35:16,880
So poor Ravan's been killed.

1194
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,852
Your Kaka doesn't know..

1195
01:35:19,915 --> 01:35:23,158
..that Ravan is slain, not killed.

1196
01:35:23,185 --> 01:35:24,721
Naru, hand me that hammer.

1197
01:35:24,753 --> 01:35:27,461
No hammer, just gold.

1198
01:35:27,523 --> 01:35:29,662
Happy Dussera.

1199
01:35:32,561 --> 01:35:34,438
It looks amazing, Kaka.

1200
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:36,737
Our airplane will look like this.

1201
01:35:36,832 --> 01:35:39,403
Your Sitara Devi doesn't know..

1202
01:35:39,468 --> 01:35:42,972
..one needs lots of
gold to build an airplane.

1203
01:35:43,138 --> 01:35:45,550
The real one, not fake.

1204
01:35:47,976 --> 01:35:49,785
You stole it?

1205
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,788
Sitara Devi, doesn't
your Shivy know..

1206
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:56,726
..taking something from
your own house, isn't stealing.

1207
01:35:56,819 --> 01:35:58,992
I'll knock some sense into you.

1208
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:02,127
Shastn/ Ji's airplane won't
be built with filthy money.

1209
01:36:02,658 --> 01:36:04,934
Then how will we build it, Kaka?

1210
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:09,633
Using some old pans...
and some old acquaintances!

1211
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,477
Hello.
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1212
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,104
Go on.
- And I am Narayan Talpade.

1213
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:17,139
We're about to build
the world's first airp
ane..

1214
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:18,179
..and humans can fly in it.

1215
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:20,885
We politely request you
to lend us all the help you can.

1216
01:36:20,976 --> 01:36:22,819
Come on.
- Oh yeah!

1217
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,150
Airplane.
- Yeah.

1218
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:26,489
Humans will fly!
- Yes.

1219
01:36:27,983 --> 01:36:29,860
Go find someone else.

1220
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:31,887
He

o..

1221
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:33,762
I am Shivkar Talpade.
- And I am Narayan Talpade.

1222
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:36,998
We're about to build the world's first
airplane and humans can fly in it.

1223
01:36:37,026 --> 01:36:37,936
He

o..

1224
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:39,096
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1225
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:40,839
He

o..
I am Shivkar Talpade.

1226
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:41,964
Wait.

1227
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,737
Wait.
- Aunty..

1228
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:49,747
Trying to cast a new spell or what?

1229
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,821
I have just a few days till 7th.

1230
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:57,889
It's now...or never.

1231
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,959
What's so special with 7th November?

1232
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:01,959
Shastn/ ji's experience and knowledge.

1233
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:04,430
The day...the time...high-tide, low-tide..

1234
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,760
Speed of air, moisture...

1235
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:07,129
It's not that easy
to understand all that.

1236
01:37:07,389 --> 01:37:10,495
For that,
one needs to understand the universe.

1237
01:37:10,592 --> 01:37:12,594
And Shastry ji was an expert at that.

1238
01:37:12,628 --> 01:37:14,539
Not me!

1239
01:37:14,963 --> 01:37:17,944
Building an airplane
is not my cup of tea.

1240
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,708
I don't know whether it is or not?

1241
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:23,776
But I've heard that a man in love..

1242
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,978
..often does things beyond his limits.

1243
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,188
Don't expect anything anymore.

1244
01:37:35,717 --> 01:37:37,993
Neither money or nor praise.

1245
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:43,401
Your airplane's has pricked
the eyes of the British.

1246
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,598
Come on, your highness,
the tiger's waiting.

1247
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,139
Just a minute, sir.

1248
01:37:52,034 --> 01:37:55,106
I am an enslaved king
of an enslaved country.

1249
01:37:55,904 --> 01:37:58,510
I've to hunt down the
tigers of my own jungle..

1250
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:02,386
“Only for the sake
of their happiness.

1251
01:38:05,747 --> 01:38:07,954
Not sure if history will forgive me...

1252
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:12,727
..but you please find
the head to forgive me.

1253
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,766
Best of luck!

1254
01:38:16,491 --> 01:38:22,874
"Bless me with your grace."

1255
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:32,081
"You're my benefactor
on this journey."

1256
01:38:33,742 --> 01:38:41,422
"You can turn stones into diamonds."

1257
01:38:42,684 --> 01:38:44,391
Won't fly.

1258
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,600
Our airplane will never fly.

1259
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:51,900
Let's do one thing.

1260
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,598
Let's pick a chit.

1261
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:14,752
Shastn/ ji was right.

1262
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:17,597
Our fate's gone out for a stroll.

1263
01:39:19,721 --> 01:39:22,702
Leave it. It will be the
opposite of what is written here.

1264
01:39:22,724 --> 01:39:23,930
Shivy!

1265
01:39:29,598 --> 01:39:30,599
It Will fly!

1266
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,938
VVhich means I chose 'It won't fly'.

1267
01:39:35,403 --> 01:39:37,815
Our airplane will never fly.

1268
01:39:39,341 --> 01:39:40,718
It Will.

1269
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:44,424
My dear friend,
since you build your airplane..

1270
01:39:44,446 --> 01:39:46,483
..You forgot all
about your old friends.

1271
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,624
And I heard that...you're
building a big airplane.

1272
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,963
No, Khan Sahib. I tried my best.

1273
01:39:55,423 --> 01:39:56,993
And now I've run out of
all my money and my courage.

1274
01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:58,833
What are you saying?

1275
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:00,804
Then you will have
to come home with me.

1276
01:40:00,895 --> 01:40:04,775
My 6 year old son keeps
telling his school friends..

1277
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:07,779
..that his father used to play
in the band with Shivkar Talpade.

1278
01:40:07,802 --> 01:40:09,645
You're his hero.

1279
01:40:09,738 --> 01:40:12,742
And I don't have the
courage to tell him..

1280
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:15,015
..that his hero's
lost all his courage.

1281
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:16,885
You only tell him if you can.

1282
01:40:16,912 --> 01:40:18,482
You don't know, but..

1283
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:22,392
“You're the only free Indian
of this enslaved country. Only one.

1284
01:40:22,451 --> 01:40:24,954
You're the one who
gives us courage, hope.

1285
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,466
Of an independent tomorrow.

1286
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:32,972
You will have to fly. For us.

1287
01:40:33,428 --> 01:40:35,738
For the workers that
toil in the mills.

1288
01:40:35,797 --> 01:40:37,174
The labors that build bridges.

1289
01:40:37,466 --> 01:40:39,412
For the arms that pull the rickshaw.

1290
01:40:39,434 --> 01:40:42,005
For we 
ndians...you will have to fly.

1291
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:46,075
How, Khan Sir? This is all I have.

1292
01:40:47,442 --> 01:40:51,481
Will the airplane fly with this?
- It will.

1293
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:56,054
Your airplane will definitely fly.

1294
01:40:56,184 --> 01:40:57,925
Look.

1295
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:02,025
The entire neighbourhood
saved this...for Haj.

1296
01:41:02,824 --> 01:41:05,600
Go fly your airplane.

1297
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:09,138
We'll consider our Haj done.

1298
01:41:09,565 --> 01:41:12,637
And if that's not enough,
then take this too.

1299
01:41:13,469 --> 01:41:16,609
We poor people have a big heart

1300
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:21,179
Will you fly your airplane now?
- Of course he will.

1301
01:41:21,877 --> 01:41:23,151
Want to bet 50 paise on it?

1302
01:41:23,445 --> 01:41:25,789
Atleast now raise your
standard to a rupee bet.

1303
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,729
"Your prayers..."

1304
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:39,898
"Your prayers..."

1305
01:41:39,961 --> 01:41:42,066
"Your prayers..."

1306
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:44,474
"Your prayers..."

1307
01:41:44,566 --> 01:41:48,776
“I bowed,
I kneeled...l even prayed secretly.“

1308
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:53,410
“I bowed,
I kneeled...l even prayed secretly.“

1309
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:55,649
“I stopped and prayed.“

1310
01:41:55,744 --> 01:41:57,985
“I knelt and prayed.“

1311
01:41:58,046 --> 01:42:02,654
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1312
01:42:02,684 --> 01:42:06,962
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1313
01:42:06,988 --> 01:42:09,127
"No sense of dying."

1314
01:42:09,157 --> 01:42:11,535
"No sense of dying."

1315
01:42:11,593 --> 01:42:15,939
“No sense of dying...nor of living.“

1316
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:22,004
"The nomad in me has
surrendered to you..."

1317
01:42:33,081 --> 01:42:37,461
"With hope can/ed on my tools..."

1318
01:42:37,552 --> 01:42:41,898
"With hope can/ed on my tools..."

1319
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:44,529
“I have put parts
of my dreams onto it...“

1320
01:42:44,626 --> 01:42:47,163
“I have put parts
of my dreams onto it...“

1321
01:42:48,597 --> 01:42:52,977
"This simple wood needs
to travel the world..."

1322
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:57,607
"This simple wood needs"
to travel the world...

1323
01:42:57,639 --> 01:42:59,676
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1324
01:42:59,775 --> 01:43:01,914
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1325
01:43:01,944 --> 01:43:04,083
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1326
01:43:04,145 --> 01:43:06,648
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1327
01:43:06,714 --> 01:43:08,785
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1328
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:11,160
"Now these wings cannot be stopped."

1329
01:43:11,186 --> 01:43:19,867
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1330
01:43:20,128 --> 01:43:27,637
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1331
01:43:29,003 --> 01:43:36,820
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1332
01:43:37,813 --> 01:43:45,493
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1333
01:43:46,722 --> 01:43:55,005
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1334
01:43:55,731 --> 01:44:02,148
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1335
01:44:04,539 --> 01:44:11,684
"The swan will fly away alone..."

1336
01:44:18,653 --> 01:44:20,030
Accounts! Accounts! Accounts!

1337
01:44:20,055 --> 01:44:21,728
I need to finish these accounts today.

1338
01:44:21,823 --> 01:44:23,928
Gokhle. Where's Gokhle?

1339
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:25,528
Gokhle.

1340
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:27,907
Godbo
e..

1341
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:32,970
Narayan!

1342
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:34,672
Narayan!

1343
01:44:37,672 --> 01:44:38,776
What's this?

1344
01:44:39,007 --> 01:44:40,543
What's this?

1345
01:44:40,575 --> 01:44:44,022
Look, Narayan...no airplane
can fly without fuel.

1346
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:46,490
Your uncle is crazy.

1347
01:44:46,548 --> 01:44:50,394
And you're even
crazier to believe him.

1348
01:44:50,885 --> 01:44:52,125
You might be crazy.

1349
01:44:52,153 --> 01:44:54,133
My uncle is not crazy.

1350
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:56,135
He's not!
My uncle is not crazy.

1351
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:58,029
Narayan!

1352
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,462
Forget it, Mohan.

1353
01:45:01,996 --> 01:45:03,805
He's just a kid.

1354
01:45:03,865 --> 01:45:05,105
No, father.

1355
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:08,510
You can live without your son..

1356
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,447
But not me.

1357
01:45:13,174 --> 01:45:14,983
I can't live without him.

1358
01:45:15,844 --> 01:45:17,790
I can't live without him.

1359
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,594
You want promotion, don't you?

1360
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:29,695
Promotion?

1361
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:32,862
I have a piece of information.

1362
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:48,117
Naru...l know what's 4121 ..

1363
01:45:48,142 --> 01:45:49,678
True

1364
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:51,754
F for four F for fodder.

1365
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,725
<i>1 plus 2 makes 12.
An animal with 12 horns.</i>

1366
01:45:55,750 --> 01:46:04,693
When the animal would eat this fodder,
he will poop put the fuel.

1367
01:46:05,626 --> 01:46:08,766
Kaka, everything's a joke for you.

1368
01:46:12,634 --> 01:46:15,444
Narayan,
no matter what you do in life..

1369
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:16,844
Be a Doctor, Lawyer..

1370
01:46:16,938 --> 01:46:19,612
. .Collector. . .anything .

1371
01:46:19,707 --> 01:46:21,050
But don't ever on].

1372
01:46:21,075 --> 01:46:22,952
You know why?

1373
01:46:23,512 --> 01:46:26,823
Crying doesn't change anything.

1374
01:46:26,882 --> 01:46:30,523
Look at me.
The teacher chucked me out..

1375
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:32,660
..and I left with a smile.

1376
01:46:32,687 --> 01:46:35,793
I found Sitara...and I smiled.

1377
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:40,096
Father threw me out of the house,
and I still smiled.

1378
01:46:40,628 --> 01:46:42,630
Shastry ji said “Let's fly“..

1379
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:43,768
..and I still smiled.

1380
01:46:43,798 --> 01:46:46,074
I even built an airplane. Smiled.

1381
01:46:46,367 --> 01:46:48,870
There was just one
time I didn't smile.

1382
01:46:50,372 --> 01:46:52,147
When Shastn/ ji passed away.

1383
01:46:54,509 --> 01:46:56,079
I cried.

1384
01:46:57,512 --> 01:47:00,959
But...did that change a thing?

1385
01:47:03,818 --> 01:47:05,991
That's why I say...smi
e!

1386
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:07,556
Laugh aloud . .
- Uncle. .

1387
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:08,760
Laugh!

1388
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,167
Uncle..
- Come.

1389
01:47:10,392 --> 01:47:13,737
But Kaka, fuel?
- We'll figure something out.

1390
01:47:13,828 --> 01:47:14,966
Uncle, we have just two days.

1391
01:47:15,063 --> 01:47:16,041
Come on.

1392
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:22,548
Children, this is our Solar Sysem.

1393
01:47:22,603 --> 01:47:25,106
What is it called?
- Solar System.

1394
01:47:25,407 --> 01:47:26,044
Very good.

1395
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:29,088
In the centre we have the Sun.

1396
01:47:29,177 --> 01:47:33,887
And the first planet...
is called Mercury, which is..

1397
01:47:33,915 --> 01:47:36,361
Different names in
Physics and Chemistry.

1398
01:47:36,918 --> 01:47:38,829
Physics and Chemistry?

1399
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,593
Who's this learned chap?

1400
01:47:40,688 --> 01:47:42,361
Me Shivkar Govind Talpade.

1401
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:46,963
An old scholar of your class.
- So...it's you.

1402
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,570
So the plane flew?

1403
01:47:49,597 --> 01:47:52,407
Class 4...8 times fail.

1404
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:56,074
He'll fly an airplane...
build a flying ship.

1405
01:47:56,471 --> 01:47:58,610
Young man, if you're that smart.

1406
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,143
..then why don't you
explain this to the kids?

1407
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,554
Come.

1408
01:48:07,415 --> 01:48:08,689
Here.

1409
01:48:08,783 --> 01:48:10,558
Mercury.

1410
01:48:10,785 --> 01:48:16,531
'Buddh' in Physics and,
in Chemistry. - Uncle.

1411
01:48:16,624 --> 01:48:20,003
You see 4121 everywhere.

1412
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:23,702
Naru...this isn't 4121 it's..

1413
01:48:28,803 --> 01:48:32,148
Oh yes, Para (Mercury)
in hindi looks like 4121 .

1414
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:34,119
We just needed to add on top line.

1415
01:48:34,142 --> 01:48:36,349
We found the fuel.

1416
01:48:36,444 --> 01:48:38,856
Kaka, it shines..
- But it's not silver.

1417
01:48:38,946 --> 01:48:40,619
It flows.. - But not water.

1418
01:48:40,715 --> 01:48:43,025
The mixture of metal
and chemical, mercury.

1419
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:45,826
Will our airplane fly now?
- Of course.

1420
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:48,629
No it won't.
Don't move.

1421
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:51,901
But why?
- You're under arrest.

1422
01:48:52,994 --> 01:48:54,598
Kaka..

1423
01:49:23,424 --> 01:49:25,597
Don't worry...the airplane will fly.

1424
01:49:25,693 --> 01:49:27,695
You will find mercury
in the thermometer.

1425
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:29,639
Thermometer.

1426
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:01,666
I heard, but I couldn't believe it.

1427
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:02,834
What?

1428
01:50:03,631 --> 01:50:05,577
That someone flew an airplane.

1429
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:07,510
..or that your useless
son flew an airplane.

1430
01:50:07,535 --> 01:50:12,609
Although it's late,
but I still came to congratulate you.

1431
01:50:14,943 --> 01:50:17,116
Govind Shambhu Talpade.

1432
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:20,652
Do you know why I made it this far?

1433
01:50:21,082 --> 01:50:22,390
Because of you.

1434
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:25,053
For I am like you.

1435
01:50:25,587 --> 01:50:27,760
Headstrong!

1436
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:44,446
Would you like to say
something in your defense?

1437
01:50:44,505 --> 01:50:46,507
Your Honor, there's just one thing..

1438
01:50:46,608 --> 01:50:49,452
...I want to say to your Britishers.

1439
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:51,717
Thank you.

1440
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,458
Thank you for arresting me.

1441
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:56,993
Thank you for bringing me here.

1442
01:50:57,185 --> 01:50:59,187
And thank you for filing
this case against me.

1443
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:00,625
Because if you hadn't done this..

1444
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:02,701
...I wouldn't have
reached out to my people.

1445
01:51:03,691 --> 01:51:07,002
Thank you...for bringing me close...

1446
01:51:08,596 --> 01:51:09,768
...to my people.

1447
01:51:10,532 --> 01:51:13,513
Flying an airplane
seemed like a fairytale.

1448
01:51:13,567 --> 01:51:15,137
I had lost all hope.

1449
01:51:15,637 --> 01:51:18,447
But today,
after seeing all these people..

1450
01:51:18,473 --> 01:51:20,544
...I've made up my mind.

1451
01:51:20,575 --> 01:51:21,986
Humans will fly.

1452
01:51:23,611 --> 01:51:30,085
So thank you...for mending
my broken courage.

1453
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:34,790
Friends, there's just
one thing I want to say to you.

1454
01:51:35,123 --> 01:51:36,864
These Britishers
can steal our s
umber..

1455
01:51:36,958 --> 01:51:39,734
..but not our dreams.

1456
01:51:40,595 --> 01:51:42,871
When I fly my airplane, and..

1457
01:51:43,664 --> 01:51:49,615
“You will hear just one
voice in the engine's rattle.

1458
01:51:51,873 --> 01:51:53,682
Vande Mataram!

1459
01:51:59,013 --> 01:52:04,019
Sir...l am no freedom fighter.

1460
01:52:05,086 --> 01:52:09,796
But...for giving me the oppoﬂunity.

1461
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:14,528
...to say Vande Mataram
in front of all my people..

1462
01:52:14,562 --> 01:52:15,700
Thank you!

1463
01:52:15,763 --> 01:52:17,538
Vande Mataram!

1464
01:52:17,631 --> 01:52:19,838
Vande Mataram!

1465
01:52:50,564 --> 01:52:56,913
Friend...our paths maybe separate,
but our destination is the same.

1466
01:52:57,071 --> 01:52:58,550
Freedom.

1467
01:52:58,706 --> 01:53:01,448
Tomorrow, everyone will hear
just one voice in engine's rattle.

1468
01:53:01,809 --> 01:53:03,948
“Ne-re free.’

1469
01:53:05,012 --> 01:53:06,514
Vande Mataram!

1470
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:35,078
Tonight's the last night,
tomorrow the final goodbye.

1471
01:53:35,476 --> 01:53:37,114
Without me?

1472
01:53:37,378 --> 01:53:38,857
It's suicide.

1473
01:53:39,046 --> 01:53:41,856
I don't know how to stop,
turn or land.

1474
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:44,760
It's an unsolvable maze.

1475
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:46,492
So why don't you just jump down?

1476
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,965
Death in any case.

1477
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,531
I am already burdened
for murdering Mr. Shastnj.

1478
01:53:53,594 --> 01:53:54,766
Don't want to be
responsible for yours.

1479
01:53:54,829 --> 01:53:56,399
You fulfilled my
third condition.

1480
01:53:56,497 --> 01:53:58,773
...and now you don't
want your reward?

1481
01:53:59,467 --> 01:54:01,879
I know you want me to come with you.

1482
01:54:01,969 --> 01:54:04,916
No, I don't want you to come.

1483
01:54:05,006 --> 01:54:07,543
You want it.
- No.

1484
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:12,482
If you didn't...then why
would you put two chairs in it?

1485
01:54:12,947 --> 01:54:17,555
Because...l ..
- Yes..

1486
01:54:20,488 --> 01:54:22,126
Speak up.

1487
01:54:23,824 --> 01:54:25,497
No reason!

1488
01:54:31,165 --> 01:54:33,907
Kaka...say cheese!

1489
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:41,543
Hey our Newton.

1490
01:54:41,642 --> 01:54:42,985
Will that Chatterjee
from the police station..

1491
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:44,785
..come down to click our picture?

1492
01:54:44,812 --> 01:54:47,793
It's automatic, uncle.
- How?

1493
01:54:48,115 --> 01:54:54,396
Well, I've put in a small
piece of cotton in the camera.

1494
01:54:54,421 --> 01:54:56,401
And poured two drops of water.

1495
01:54:56,457 --> 01:54:58,403
As soon as the cotton gets wet,
it will go heavier..

1496
01:54:58,459 --> 01:54:59,836
..the button will get
pressed automatically.

1497
01:54:59,927 --> 01:55:01,907
And take our picture.

1498
01:55:01,929 --> 01:55:03,533
Look ahead.

1499
01:55:05,966 --> 01:55:08,970
Kaka, what's inside?
- Letters, for my mother.

1500
01:55:09,036 --> 01:55:12,483
Tomorrow,
at 9:24 am your Kaka will fly away.

1501
01:55:12,506 --> 01:55:13,484
Don't stay asleep.

1502
01:55:13,541 --> 01:55:16,044
Narayan...your father's
furious, hurry up.

1503
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:18,954
Mother, I'll be there, you go.
- Come on.

1504
01:55:19,013 --> 01:55:20,822
Sister-in-law.

1505
01:55:27,488 --> 01:55:29,627
Are you really going tomorrow?

1506
01:55:32,126 --> 01:55:34,504
You will never come back?

1507
01:55:37,365 --> 01:55:38,935
Good for you.

1508
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,944
At least you will be free.

1509
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:44,109
Don't worn] about Narayan.

1510
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:46,418
I'll appoint a tutor for him.

1511
01:55:48,009 --> 01:55:51,957
I'll take care of mother, father...

1512
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:54,654
You just go.

1513
01:55:57,018 --> 01:55:58,725
Choose one.

1514
01:56:00,488 --> 01:56:01,796
Come on choose.

1515
01:56:04,825 --> 01:56:06,429
Stupid!

1516
01:56:06,894 --> 01:56:08,567
You lost again.

1517
01:56:10,564 --> 01:56:12,737
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

1518
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:16,074
Don't lose tomorrow, Shivy.

1519
01:56:16,671 --> 01:56:18,412
Don't lose tomorrow.

1520
01:56:21,008 --> 01:56:23,579
Make India proud!

1521
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:42,069
'I will wear this the
day...l take off in an airplane.'

1522
01:56:43,864 --> 01:56:50,679
"With a bag full of memories..."

1523
01:56:50,771 --> 01:56:56,915
“And a trunk stuffed with love...“

1524
01:56:57,712 --> 01:57:04,687
"Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened..."

1525
01:57:04,718 --> 01:57:11,602
"Turned the key,
seatbelts fastened..."

1526
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:17,871
"Time to go kiss the moon."

1527
01:57:17,898 --> 01:57:22,898
“The swan will fly away alone..“

1528
01:57:31,612 --> 01:57:36,612
“The swan will fly away alone..“

1529
01:58:08,382 --> 01:58:09,725
Go.

1530
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:16,067
Go quietly.

1531
01:58:25,799 --> 01:58:27,745
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

1532
01:58:27,768 --> 01:58:30,874
I told you not to.
- But, father..

1533
01:58:31,071 --> 01:58:33,915
You won't listen, will you?

1534
01:58:34,408 --> 01:58:35,944
You won't listen...

1535
01:58:38,846 --> 01:58:41,019
Dawn comes everyday. .

1536
01:58:41,682 --> 01:58:43,753
..but airplanes don't fly even] day.

1537
01:58:44,752 --> 01:58:47,562
You will definitely go watch
the airplane fly today, Narayan.

1538
01:58:47,654 --> 01:58:48,689
Go.

1539
01:58:50,791 --> 01:58:52,429
Let g0!

1540
01:59:00,834 --> 01:59:03,041
We shall salute you rather.

1541
01:59:03,103 --> 01:59:08,576
My dear friend, before you
become the world's first flying man.

1542
01:59:08,676 --> 01:59:13,421
Won't you give me an autograph?

1543
01:59:17,718 --> 01:59:19,026
Memorabilia!

1544
01:59:22,656 --> 01:59:24,067
Sir. Sir!

1545
01:59:24,125 --> 01:59:26,002
Shiv's escaped.
He's escaped from jail.

1546
01:59:26,026 --> 01:59:27,630
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1547
01:59:27,728 --> 01:59:29,935
He's escaped, sir. He's escaped.

1548
01:59:40,474 --> 01:59:44,445
It will end the way...it all started.

1549
01:59:45,446 --> 01:59:48,052
In the middle of the clouds.

1550
01:59:50,084 --> 01:59:53,691
Hold me tight, don't be shy.

1551
01:59:54,889 --> 01:59:57,529
Do you remember your lines?

1552
01:59:57,558 --> 01:59:59,731
I am love with you, Shakuntala.

1553
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:01,500
Let's go far away.
