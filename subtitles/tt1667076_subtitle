00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,894
If I get even half percent less than 95 percent..

00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,599
..engineering I'll be in call centre.

41

I don't even know what I'll write in exam.

45
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,311
And this Ritesh said he'll help me.

00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:58,380
Automatically they'll remove 80 percent out of him.

180
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,753
How will they remove father.

181
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:06,688
Brother brother.

182
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,256
Show me too.

183
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,102
Want to see.

184
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:11,392
Go do your work.

185
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,539
Move man.

186
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:27,379
Do you take old items?

187
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:35,394
Uncle no one will be your buyer.

188
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,554
I mean to say.

189
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,493
I've an old watch.

190
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,192
Which I want to sell, -Wow.

191
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:45,230
Thank you son, thank you.

192
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:48,140
Since ages had kept it to my heart.

193
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,333
What are you saying?

194
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:52,133
Yes, if I wasn't in need.

195
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,209
Then would never sell it.

196
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,406
What will I get of this?

197
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,582
Minimum would be 40.

198
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:00,184
Oh on.

199
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:03,153
40 is really less, -Ok.

200
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:05,147
Respect your age.

201
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:07,457
42, -Oh son.

202
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:09,523
If you want to respect age.

203
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,427
Then shall we fix 1 50, -What 1 50?

204
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:13,688
Yes.

205
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,367
What uncle you also.

206
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,624
Turn my mood off.

207
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,226
Believe me.

208
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,505
1 50 are accurate.

209
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:22,764
Really.

210
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:25,242
Shows proper time.

211
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,534
Oh uncle.

212
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,110
You yourself in living overtime.

213
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,204
Leave this.

214
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:34,450
And uncle, listen to me, move away.

215
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:38,322
Or else anybody will sell you thinking you're waste,
-Enough.

216
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:39,823
Ill mannered.

217
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,284
Should be in limits.

218
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:43,686
Mad.

219
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,090
Hush.

220
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,598
Hello, Jeevan Lal and sons.

221
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,190
Yes, -Oh Ritesh.

222
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:50,658
Tell me one thing.

223
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,498
Whenever I make you sit on the counter.

224
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:55,267
Why do all customers get angry and go away.

225
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,843
Should never allow you to enter in the shop. -Thank
God.

226
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,039
Finally you understood, I'm safe.

227
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,778
Ohh wait, wait, -From tomorrow.

228
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,410
From today you'll have to come everyday in the
shop..

229
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:06,507
..understood.

230
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,086
Hi Meenu, hi Vishnu.

231
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:16,517
Is dad around?

232
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:22,690
Hello dad.

233
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,535
Hello Vishnu, have a seat.

234
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,206
Will you've coffee?

235
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:44,586
How much sugar will you've?

236
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:45,680
Two spoons.

237
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,366
How is the coffee?

238
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:07,635
It's nice.

239
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,684
But would taste more better..

240
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,276
.. with 1 more spoon of sugar in it.

241
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,786
Vishnu your numbers are also good.

242
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:24,425
But instead of 94, it would've been 95.

243
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,559
Then would be more better.

244
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:28,858
Still I.

245
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,264
Have hopes that you'll not break our family
traditions.

246
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,699
St Peters college form.

247
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,070
Fill it.

248
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,400
Ok dad.

249
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,182
Even I had brought a form.

250
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,710
Think it as an extra circular activity.

251
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:53,781
Ok.

252
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,294
Got to know the reason.

253
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,887
Of your less number.

254
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:06,430
This nonsense in your brain.

255
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,773
Must be from those friends of yours.

256
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,506
Bloody back benchers.

257
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,312
You may go now, I'll see you at home.

258
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:19,407
Ok dad.

259
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,851
Child marriage is crime dad.

260
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:24,451
If neighbors and angels get to know.

261
00:18:24,557 --> 00:18:27,253
Then you'll be in big trouble. -And I'll make sure it
happens.

262
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,851
Child, to keep you engage, I..

263
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,730
.. thought of your engagement, -So what do you
think?

264
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,595
I'll bear your torture?

265
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:36,559
You don't know papa.

266
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,762
What wot I can do. -No no.

267
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:40,532
What ever you think please don't act.

268
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:44,165
I'm suffocated child, open the door.

269
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:47,604
Father! Greetings.

270
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,213
You don't understand me, I eyes go far.

271
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,413
Ya I know, with those binoculars your eyes really go
far.

272
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:58,251
But listen, to score I can score 90 also.

273
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,383
But I don't score, you don't understand.

274
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:04,327
I'm trying to say, from Ritesh Virani, straight Mukesh
Ambani.

275
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,762
Is it, how come?

276
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,825
Will go to college, and will do business
management.

277
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:11,468
Then will become a ceo of some company..

278
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,266
..and will buy half shares of same company.

279
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,499
Will invest in 4 or 6 new plans.

280
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,074
Will deal with international market.

281
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:19,076
Then direct in HOO ZOO business men will write my
name.

282
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,077
Whatever you said,

283
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,607
Couldn't understand some of it.

284
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:25,343
But sounds good, -Father.

285
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,579
Give me the fees, and then you see, -Ya but look.

286
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,483
If you don't get admission in college.

287
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,525
Then from Mukesh will make you servant. -Brother.

288
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,615

I failed being pass.

294
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,527

00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,336
Ritesh Kumar Virani.

298
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,672
Look at your studies.

299
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,648
This is your mark sheet.

300
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,241
40 percent you've scored. 40 percent.

301
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:35,513
Dad asks my percentage.

302
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,488
How do I say my percentage?

303
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,316
Shout and screams my percentage.

304
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:47,191

Where is this Vishnu man? Break his bones.

00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:50,422
How would I know where he's,- Not picking up my
phone,

There's no vibration in your bodies like this.

00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:16,137
No man, we've big jerks.

332

Since you've gone to college.

00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,313
You don't meet us, so busy you've become.

335
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:23,711
Miss you man.

00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:34,760
What.

00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:36,460

00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,667
Are you mad, -Vishnu.

342
00:23:39,672 --> 00:23:41,606
Leave men, -Nothing will happen.

343
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:45,270
Is it that's why you were? Desperate to meet me.

344
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,433
Are you mad?

345
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:50,106

But can't speak to dad for any jack.

347
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,812
Why can't you do it? We're torn here.

348
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,649
New Mumbai,Thane Kalyan. -Have gone more far
from there.

349
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:59,520
Not getting admissions anywhere. -So do a
correspondence course.

00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,490
You'll anyways get degree, -Who wants degree?

351
00:24:01,594 --> 00:24:02,458
We cannot sit at home.

00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:20,109
Guys don't get me wrong.

360
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,309
You guys are my best friends. -And with this my
father.

361
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,112
It makes no difference, if my father had contacts.

362
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,247
Then here I wouldn't study like dog.

363
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,187
I know he won't do it.

364
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm sorry guys, -So what you trying to say.

365
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,790
If your father doesn't do anything for us.

366
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,360
Then nothing will happen, -Yes I think so.

367
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:36,792
That's the last option man. -No.

368
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:38,487
We've got one more option.

369
00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:40,254
We'll again go to all colleges.

370
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:42,592
And will fall on principles feet, and beg for
admission.

371
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:44,391
Yes, now say.

372
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:45,527
Say, brilliant idea.

373
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:47,765
Look principle cabin is there, go there.

374
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:48,897
Won't give you admission.

375
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,608
But will have a practice to fall on feet.

376
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,441
Sir please, -Allow us once to go in.

377
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:56,913
What will you attempt? By going inside.

378
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,376
Once said no.

379
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:00,642
Principle doesn't meet anyone like this.

380
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:03,551
Do you've an appointment, brother? We don't want
appointment.

381
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,749
We want admission, -Like this you get admission.

382
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,486
Like this you get admission. -Then how do we get
admission.

383
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,221
Like this you cannot get admission.

384
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:12,790
Come on out, out out.

385
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,661
Sir please. -Out.

386
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:18,362
Sir please sir, -Let us go man, -Out.

387
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:20,672
Vishnu, you were right man.

388
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,070
You got peon so you touched his feet.

389
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,405
Principle won't give his feet also.

390
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,469
Now understood.

391
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,272
To get admission. -Is how difficult.

392
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,477
You're right Vishnu, complete useless.

393
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,382
Feel our college life will be..

394
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,347
Listen guys.

395
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:42,421
My dad has arranged for a party tonight.

396
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,790
I don't have the balls, but I'll try.

397
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,328
I can talk once for you all.

398
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:57,664
Dad, actually.

399
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:00,311
If you can refer my friends.

400
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,408
Then would be better for their life.

401
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:03,743
Hello sir.

402
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,047
Vishnu, today am in good mood.

403
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:09,116
Henceforth never refer such things.

404
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,415
Do you understand that?

405
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:12,448
Ok. Let me talk.

406
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,521
Congratulations sir, -Thank you.

407
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,725
Mr Vardan, what happened?

408
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,196
To you're such a talented son.

409
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:20,663
Like this, like this.

410
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,532
Showed your finger and screamed.

411
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:25,497
First he fingered Mr Abhay.

412
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:29,872
Think I look fool by face to him.

413
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:31,507
No no, no sir.

414
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,574
You look very intelligent.

415
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:36,507
You remind me of my son Nanj.

416
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,376
What do you mean by that? -I mean..

417
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:43,187
Sir I want. -My son when he grows up.

418
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:44,688
Should be over educated like you.

419
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:46,451
Highly educated is the word.

420
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,417
For this he'll have to.

421
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:51,192
Rebirth, -What.

422
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:54,393
Vardan sir,Vardan sir.

423
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,269
Next life will think in next life only.

424
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:58,834
First will fix this life.

425
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,340
Your resourceful hand keep on our children's head.

426
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:04,531
Very clever.

427
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:08,440
Now understood, for your sons admission.

428
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:11,307
Want to use my influence and source.

429
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,317
Source is the big thing.

430
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,182
If you do a miss call also.

431
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:17,050
Then also my kid will float.

432
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:19,853
Why should I waste my miscall for them.

433
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,618
When they don't want to study..

434
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:25,390
..then why to waste 3 seats of college.

435
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:28,160
Tell me Mr Nigam, am I wrong.

436
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,559
I won't be able to say properly.

437
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:32,665
Father of a girl and.

438
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,238
As you know that.

439
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,671
Girls father.

440
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:37,536
Is a girls father.

441
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,310
What you've to say Mr Nigam.

442
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:42,478
They've proved how eligible they're.

443
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:44,515
Our kids are unfit.

444
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,479
But as parents will have to fulfill our responsibilities.

445
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,685
If parents would be responsible

446
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:55,851
Then may be these kids wouldn't be unfit.

447
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:09,397
I'm proud of you my son.

448
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,369
Ladies and gentlemen.

449
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,605
One minute, excuse us.

450
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:16,112
Today in society.

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,141
Learnt to keep his head above.

453
00:28:20,486 --> 00:28:21,578
I remember that day.

454
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:23,846
When I hugged Vishnu and.

455
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:25,312
On his first day.

456
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:27,392
Went to drop him at college.

457
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,495
That time, I Vardan family's responsible father.

458
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:33,826

Congratulations.

463
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,875
Congratulations sir, thank you.

464
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:51,376
Good child.

465
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:55,411
You made me naked in front of all, very good.

466
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:59,180
Cheers, the servant will be on holiday from
tomorrow.

467
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,353
Your job starts.

00:29:10,469 --> 00:29:13,700
Your marriage is fixed, boy is from good family.

469
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,466
If he fails..

471
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:27,674
I won't leave him.

472
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,212
Enough!

473
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:31,682
I won't spare him.

474
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:37,858
Don't know what I'll do.

475
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,364
What will we do man.

476
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:39,592
What will we do man.

477
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,195
Vishnu, do you've this big rope.

478
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,134
This big I've, will do, -So bring it.

479
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:49,366
All 3 will hang, -You hang yourself.

480
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,571
You knew what will happen wid this result.

481
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,572
So live with it, Ritesh my father will kill me.

482
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,341
What your dad, even my dad.

483
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:59,145
This time, we're the biggest enemies of our dads.

484
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,246
Our real problems will start tomorrow..

485
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:02,684
..when they'll be in senses,

486
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:05,090
Then whatever they say will have to do man.

487
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:06,380
You mean marriage?

488
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,820
No man, God help me, -To me.

489
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:11,095
He'll kick me off from house.

490
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:13,289
Why will he remove you from? House, you're his
son.

491
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,393
Didn't buy you from market, it's enough.

492
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:20,232
Ritesh, -What happened, -Leave it.

493
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:23,106
Your mood will turn off, it's my admission paper.

494
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:27,134

There is no such college left, where we'll get
admission.

497
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:35,813
Pooja let's do one thing.

498
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,684

And will request principle, please give us admission.

Won't come in college, -Won't go college give
admission.

501
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:45,527
Like this their seat will also not be wasted.

Hope.

503
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,199
Hope there would be some college like this.

And my father also.

Who will believe this? -This letter is fine.

00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:17,820
Where will you bring the college?

515
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,397

00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:17,281
Looks mathematical also.

540
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:18,879
Fakirchand, Lakirchand.

541
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:21,626
Fakirchand, Lakirchand, -Ok ok guys its perfect.

542
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,555
Fakirchand and Lakirchand college.

543
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:24,686
You make it brother.

544
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:27,789
Come on, it looks like a fake name.

545
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,828
Fakirchand, Lakirchand, named.

546
00:32:31,403 --> 00:32:33,894
What do I write on these names,-You sit I'll tell you.

547
00:32:34,406 --> 00:32:35,464
That too illiterates.

548
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:36,734
Earning money.

549
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:38,833
Reached America, what America?, that's ok right.

550
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,109
Then they realized.

551
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,609
That without education they reached here.

552
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,350
Then being educated where would they reached,
enough.

553
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:49,310
Then they started making colleges around the
world.

554
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,148
Fakirchand, Lakirchand.

555
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:53,713
Trust university.

556
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,923
I spoke right, you make it -Guys guys,

557
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,791
One day your parents will get to know, then what
will you do.

558
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,595
When papa will get to know that time will deal it..

559
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:04,691
..now you make.

560
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,764
And better than sitting on streets.

561
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:08,773
Show the letter and sit home.

562
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:12,070
And faster you upload the website.

563
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:15,845
Because we want to see smile on our fathers face,
that also.

564
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:17,370
Till tomorrow.

565
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,414
Fakirchand, Lakirchand.

566
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,611
Who are they?

567
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,388
They're like God, father like God.

568
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,757
They made a university for students like us.

569
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,352
Meaning now Ritesh Virani will surely become
Mukesh Ambani.

570
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:32,823
Yes father.

571
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,762
Now my studies have started.

572
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:36,256
Wow

573
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,529
Papa.

574
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:44,368

What happened to that hell well college.

579
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,244

00:33:56,555 --> 00:34:00,150
Narayani, look at this full page advertisement given,

581
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:02,591
I told you no. -Everything will be fine.

582
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:03,683
That was bound to happen dad.

583
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,389
Before you find a guy, I had to get admission.

584
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,326
That over educated man will be ashamed..

585
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:14,172
..when I'll drop him to his college proudly on the
first day.

586
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:21,141
Father, you don't need to come.

587
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,269
Why not?

588
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:25,350

00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:38,392
Mad you all are what I said.

593
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:40,488
What I had said, will be in trouble.

594
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:43,164
Your father is coming to see your college.

595
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,836
So. -So. -Where is the college? Which you'll make.

599
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:55,610
Yes, -Really.

00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:58,281
Are you mad? -Silence please, -Are you mad.

601
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:00,749
Understand, you'll be trap.

602

Will see at that time, it's just a matter of one day.

603
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:06,249
Nothing will happen. -Why are you so scared?

604
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:08,258
Exactly- Hey Nanj. -Make him understand.

605
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,520

606
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:11,728

And in this you want to make a college.

608
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:16,528
When there is no college.

609
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:18,125
Then from where will you make it.

610
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,731
You never took googles help, google help.

00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:36,651
How are you, you've lost weight, what.

612
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:39,815
A small work, go, -Its not that small too. -Its big.

613
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:41,449
How big, will be beaten from shoes.

614
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,528
What are you saying? Will be on streets, -Really.

615
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:44,788
Won't be able to show face.

616

Very nice, -will be dead, ohh come in come in.

617
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,896
Come come, make yourself comfortable, come.

618
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:59,333
Sir in the newspaper you had seen advertisement.

619
00:35:59,444 --> 00:36:00,741
We just need a college for that.

620
00:36:00,846 --> 00:36:04,179
You're a superman. -Wore the pant first.

621
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:05,476
Remembered the panty later.

622
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,177
If won't get the college, even the panties will be
down.

623
00:36:08,553 --> 00:36:11,215
Sir college should be far away from Mumbai, -Far.

624
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:12,412
Yes.

625
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:15,357
One college is so far, you'll feel its switzerland.

626
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,449
By road.

627
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,256
Switzerland, awesome.

628
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,256
Ohh my..

629
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:24,835
Listen.

630
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,364
What is it?

631
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:33,376
Castle, it's under me.

632
00:36:33,478 --> 00:36:37,278
One NRI gave me to sell it in 6000 no one is ready to
buy it.

633
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:40,078
It's a bad omen place, but for you all it's lucky.

634
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,508
Superb.

635
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,247
But its very deteriorated.

636
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:44,788
Will have to do lot of work on it.

637
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,255
Will do it.

638
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,218
Don't get upset with small work.

639
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,794
Where that you'll do it, but would require lot of
money.

640
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,830
We're middleclass guys, from where would we bring
money?

641
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:54,455
I'll give it, -You're great sir.

642
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:56,158
Thank you, will take it back also.

643
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,496
With 1 0.to percent interest.

644
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:58,864

645
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:01,731
..and anyways father will give fees money, -Ok.

646
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,638
For them only we doing all this, -I like your dad,

647
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:07,211
I spoke to father he said yes.

648
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,807
Now our college is done.

649
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,178
But God forbid, if something happens.

650
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:15,549
Then am not with you, am saying it first.

651
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:17,577
Am out am sorry.

652
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,858
Just arrange for Stephanie.

653
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,827
Because your fourth tier is.

654
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:26,125
Going to burst.

655
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:27,391

If father will get to know that time will see.

You start the work.

660
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:37,636
Let's rock and roll.

661
00:37:48,386 --> 00:37:53,085
In difficult questions, sorted thoughts.

662
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:57,423
Step our wings I'll sail away

663
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:02,626
Have got hurt also.

664
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:08,232
Here where, donno where, it's hurt.

665
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,676
Still the heart is in panic.

666
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:16,547
Take me to the world I know.

667
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:20,675
Because that's where where I'll go, I'm floating.

668
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:27,190
Am moving.

669
00:38:30,495 --> 00:38:35,660
Am moving.

670
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,496
Am moving.

671
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:42,739
Guys what's the scene after lunch.

672
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:45,670
Drop me home and what else, -Now what
happened to you.

673
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,439
I don't have my college.

674
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:50,711
How will I reach in this bad car?

675
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:53,647
Your college is getting done, -Hey Vishnu.

676
00:38:53,752 --> 00:38:57,882
Vishnu wait, who will clean the toilet?

677
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,258
When it's mended.

678
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:12,202
Flushed in seconds.

679
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:16,235
Luck is bit dicey.

680
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:22,511
Roads to sky of dreams are raw.

681
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:25,508
Walk carefully.

682
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:29,849
Don't fall.

683
00:39:30,255 --> 00:39:32,553
Unaware.

684
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:38,254
Fell off, even hurt,

685
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:43,290
Here there, donno where.

686
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:48,831
Have fallen, still we're panic.

687
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:51,735
Take me to the world I know

688
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:59,312
Because that's where where I'll go

689
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:04,377
Am moving.

690
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:13,523
Am moving

691
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:20,593
Let's go.

All work finish.

693
00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:28,409
I can sleep for a day in peace.

694
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:31,113
You'll be in peace once your father comes..

695
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:32,808
..and have a look at the college.

696
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:34,173
Listen Vishnu.

697
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:35,583

698
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,754
Google brother will be late, he has some work.

699
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:39,517
Get everything checked, no problem should occur.

700
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:40,591
No problem should occur, meaning.

701
00:40:40,692 --> 00:40:42,159
I shouldn't go to my college. -If am gone then.

702
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,784
What are you? Saying, -Will see at that time man.

703
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,226
Just for one day.

704
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,319
Yes.

705
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:49,200
What difference it will make if one day you bunk.

706
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:50,323
He'll also come.

707
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:51,624
Ok listen.

00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:54,632
For 9 am shift have called everyone at 8.30 am.

709
00:40:54,873 --> 00:40:57,364
Everyone will come in costume. -Ok.

710
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,772
If you don't like anyone's dress..

711
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:00,401
..then whisper nicely in their ears.

712
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,207
They're very touchy, but google sir that.

713
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:04,376
Security guard and schools remaining staff.

714
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:06,344
4 watchmen's, 8 peons.

715
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,540
24 teachers.

716
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:10,883
And too many students, and they'll look like college
guys.

717
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:13,382
And principle, why principle.

718
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:14,515
Father is coming to see the college..

719
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,718
..will see the college and will leave.

720
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,158
If father will ask to meet the principle..

721
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:19,753
..then what will you do. -Who will say, no one will
say.

722
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:21,195
We don't want principle.

723
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,390
Want, -Why.

724
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:27,267
I asked father, if you want to meet principle, he said
yes.

725
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:28,396
Ohh man.

726
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,165
Oops bad, google sir.

727
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:34,275
Can you arrange for a principle too, please.

728
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,169
Young will do.

729
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:39,749
Galileo, father of modern science.

730
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:42,878
He has done something before 500 years..

731
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:45,145
..that we still remember him.

732
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:49,317
So children's, even we've to do something like this.

733
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:51,486
Sir tell us about him more.

734
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,759
Have you learnt net surfing? -Yes sir.

735
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:58,267
Then do rest on your own.

736
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:01,203
Sir you're the best.

737
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:02,773
Thank you darling.

738
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:06,139
Sir you should be our principle.

739
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,812
Hope your trustees were this sensible.

740
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:13,112
Anyways, so children.

741
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:17,854
This famous man name is principle.

742
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:21,550
Come on leave.

743
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:24,818
Mr Bajirao, -Yes sir.

744
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:27,662
Is this a class or Chattrapati Shivaji Airport.

745
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,563
No sir, kids weren't enjoying, hence I thought.

746
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,568
They were never interested in studies.

747
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,264
No, sir.They do, sir. -They learn if you teach them
properly.

748
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:37,307
He'll recite tables of eight.

749
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,304
Mahesh, you recite it.

750
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:43,381
Start.. -His name is Mangesh.

751
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,339
Sir.. Mahesh or Mangesh..

752
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,849
Makes no difference. -It does.

753
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,350
There should be perfection.

754
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,746
There should be detail.

755
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,116
You're a genius, sir.

756
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,613
Yes, Mangesh.

757
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:55,658
Sir, my name isn't Mangesh.

758
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,660
It's Dhananjay.

759
00:42:58,596 --> 00:42:59,585
Go on.

760
00:42:59,697 --> 00:43:03,224
8 times 1 is 8. -For you, darling.

761
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:04,596
8 times 2 is 16..

762
00:43:04,702 --> 00:43:06,693
For you, darling.

763
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:10,605
8 times 3 is 24 -For you, darling.

764
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,697
Stop!

765
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:14,811
Why are you defaming my school?

766
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:18,076
Sir, we're defaming Munni, not the school.

767
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:26,183
They're studying well. -I can't believe this.

768
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,588
You didn't hear the tables of 9.

769
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,626
It's about Young Sheila.

770
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:32,396
Nice to meet you. -Google, you?

771
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,187
Who are you? -Me?

772
00:43:34,399 --> 00:43:37,163
Google. Fakirchand and Lakirchand Trust University.

773
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah. That's me.

774
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:41,366
Looking good. -That's driver's license.

775
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,535
Coincidentally the car is outside too.

776
00:43:44,742 --> 00:43:45,868
We're..

777
00:43:46,144 --> 00:43:48,408
For our college we're looking for a principal.

778
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:50,242
Yes! Yes.

779
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:52,282
I'll be the principal. -Yes.

780
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:53,850
Thank you so much. -Yes.

781
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:56,284
From school principal to college principal. -Thank
you so much.

782
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:58,651
You become principal when you get a chance.

783
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:02,351
This time we came for Mr. Bajirao.

784
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,722
Bajirao!

785
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:06,197
Me? I don't know anything. Just a minute.

786
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:08,758
Google, what rubbish! Me and college principal?

787
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:11,427
Yes. You'll be principal of the college. Ask him.

788
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:12,833
Who are you? -I'm Ritesh.

789
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:14,628
Who am I? -Bajirao. -Yes, sir.

790
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:18,266
Sir, just a minute. Are you telling the truth? -Yes.

791
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:20,435
You'll be the principal of the college.

792
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:22,103
I always wanted to be a principal.

793
00:44:22,213 --> 00:44:23,874
Bajirao! -What?

794
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,882
You'll teach me how to teach!

795
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:28,216
You fool! You're a principal here.

796
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:30,418
You're not worthy to be a peon!

797
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:31,677
You're fired.

798
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:33,723
I'll do whatever I want now.

799
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:38,728
You're fired! -I'll sing whatever I want. -Let's go.

800
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,725
I always wanted to be a principal. -I know.

801
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:44,859
I'm so excited.When do I join college?

802
00:44:45,136 --> 00:44:47,366
Tomorrow. And you've to resign tomorrow after
tomorrow! -What?

803
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,402
Resign? What do you mean? -It's a one day's job. -A
day's job.

804
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:53,909
What? -It's a fake college, but real money.

805
00:44:54,178 --> 00:44:56,203
Are you mad? -Please help us.

806
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:58,813
My dad has harassed me because of my less marks.

807
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:00,714
So you opened a fake college.

808
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,683
You too are like him, but not me.

809
00:45:03,087 --> 00:45:05,282
I don't like. I've principles.

810
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,584
You'll get 50,000 rupees.

811
00:45:08,826 --> 00:45:10,555
Where is the college? -Not far.

812
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:13,620
It's a small school but students pay fees for
education.

813
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:15,792
If cheap songs aren't stopped..

814
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,392
..education will be out and vulgarity in.

815
00:45:31,516 --> 00:45:32,505
Hello.

816
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:33,843
Yes.Where are you?

817
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:35,749
Junior artists are here.

818
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:37,343
Ok, bye.

819
00:45:39,924 --> 00:45:41,357
Action!

820
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:46,354
Please wait.

821
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:47,590
Get into your character.

822
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,222
Oh!

823
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:56,535
Bajirao! This is your cabin. That's your chair.

824
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:19,629
Hail principal Bajirao!

825
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:25,198
Hail principal Bajirao!

826
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,331
Dream come true.

827
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:33,069
Father, the you like my college?

828
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:34,636
It's FALTU (useless).

829
00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:37,271
It's such a sexy college. You call it useless.

830
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:39,213
It's written on the board.

831
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:45,153
F! A! L!T! U!

832
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:46,280
FALTU!

833
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:47,548
It's a short form.

834
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:50,890
Let's go in. -Very true.

835
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:03,773
Mr. Bajirao! -What?

836
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:06,036
Wake up.

837
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:07,709
All the uncles and aunts are here.

838
00:47:08,312 --> 00:47:09,506
Please get into character.

839
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,284
I was born to play this character.

840
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:21,281
Didn't I say everything will be fine?

841
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:22,786
Naiyar. Nigam.

842
00:47:23,227 --> 00:47:25,661
What do you think looking at the college
atmosphere?

843
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:27,728
Very, very positive atmosphere.

844
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:30,630
I'll give this college 1 0 out of 1 0 marks.

845
00:47:31,636 --> 00:47:33,160
Without meeting the principal.

846
00:47:33,271 --> 00:47:36,206
Principal? -Yes, we've to meet the principal.

847
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:37,865
He's there. Principal sir!

848
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:41,467
He?

849
00:47:45,183 --> 00:47:46,172
He's the principal.

850
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:48,407
Hi, friends.

851
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,608
What's up?

852
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:52,451
I'm Bajirao! Principal of this college.

853
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:55,389
Hello, sir. You're looking very good.

854
00:47:55,493 --> 00:47:57,654
Thank you. -Hello, sir. Greetings, madam. -Greetings.

855
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,663
Nice to see you come to drop your kids.

856
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,257
Your kids too want that..

857
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:06,331
..you should drop them.

858
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:08,137
Please sit.

859
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:09,495
Here? -Yes.

860
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:11,502
Let's talk down to earth.

861
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,736
Please sit. Relax.

862
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:16,778
You see these kids.. of yours..

863
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:19,316
..they'll go very far.

864
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:21,614
You're underestimating them for no reason.

865
00:48:22,153 --> 00:48:23,415
They're very smart.

866
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:25,347
Sir, they're your kids..

867
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,482
..but you don't know them.

868
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,427
They're doing so much!

869
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:32,288
And they can do a lot.

870
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:34,654
You've no idea. -But..

871
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:37,161
..if you see hope in them..

872
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,727
..we're very hopeful too. -What are you saying?

873
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,239
We've hopes even from strangers..

874
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,304
..after all they're your kids.

875
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:47,371
Yes! Follow me.

876
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:50,345
Let's go there. -It's such an age!

877
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:51,837
But you know..

878
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:53,745
..these days..

879
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:56,376
..it's so important to be over educated.

880
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,379
Honesty is the true education.

881
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,185
Percentage doesn't matter for that.

882
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:01,793
If your kids learn to tell the truth..

883
00:49:01,793 --> 00:49:03,226
If your kids learn to tell the truth..

884
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,190
..they'll get education anywhere.

885
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:07,192
But the time is such..

886
00:49:07,298 --> 00:49:10,096
..we've to lie. -It's fine if they lie to you..

887
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:12,260
..in fact it will be no problem.

888
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,769
But if they lie to themselves..

889
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:15,262
Not advisable.

890
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,070
The day your kids tell the truth to themselves..

891
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:18,342
..college won't be needed.

892
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:19,468
..college won't be needed.

893
00:49:20,578 --> 00:49:23,240
Papa, our principal is a big philosopher.

894
00:49:23,514 --> 00:49:25,607
You won't understand him.

895
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:29,243
Jimmy! Hi!

896
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,515
Sir, I want coffee! -No overacting.

897
00:49:32,623 --> 00:49:33,851
Get lost!

898
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:35,359
Sir, very nice college.

899
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,417
Sir, very nice college.

00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:40,293
Thank you. -You're a young, dashing and handsome
principal.

901
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:41,520
Over educated.

902
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,655
Sir.

903
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:46,134
If our kids study here well..

904
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,099
Sir, the college belongs to these kids. They can do
anything.

905
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,009
Please come. -Good philosopher. -Principal.

00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:52,703
Please come. -Good philosopher. -Principal.

907
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:56,812
We see the future of our kids in this college very
clearly.

908
00:49:57,315 --> 00:49:59,249
I can see it too!

909
00:50:00,218 --> 00:50:03,381
We've reached your cars talking.

910
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:05,717
Yes.. -It means.. you've to..

Bye. -Thank you.

00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,287
Bye. -Let's go.

915
00:50:11,395 --> 00:50:13,386
Mr. Nigam. -Thank you so much Mr. Baji.. -Rao.

00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:15,598
Rao. -Bajirao! -Bajirao!

Thank you. Thank you so much, sir.

00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:22,630
Thank you. -Please, allow me. -Oh yes!

920
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,537
Bye, papa. -Bye, son.

921
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:25,243
I gave you cell phones. So call me.

922
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:26,870
I gave you cell phones. So call me.

923
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,311
Don't worry about the future of your kids.

924
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:33,215
Nothing can happen of it.

925
00:50:33,551 --> 00:50:34,540
Yes, baby!

926
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:36,410
Such innocent parents.

927
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,115
Don't you've hearts?

928
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:40,616
We're doing all this because of their anger.

929
00:50:42,193 --> 00:50:42,226
We survive on their love.

930
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:43,659
We survive on their love.

931
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,794
So we're doing this for our survival. -Very good.

932
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:48,455
For my survival..

933
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:49,767
..give me my pay check.

934
00:50:50,868 --> 00:50:51,857
Yes, Monu.

935
00:50:52,837 --> 00:50:54,634
What? You couldn't do it.

936
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:57,535
You fool! From Mono, I'll turn you to Stereo. Stay
there.

937
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,546
Google! Google!

938
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:07,481
Great work! Our parents were floored!

939
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:09,553
All these people aren't mine. -What are you saying?

940
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:12,418
I'm telling the truth. -I couldn't arrange so many.

941
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:13,888
I don't know who these people are.

942
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,860
Listen, guys. -How did you come here? -By flight!

943
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,350
Listen, guys. -How did you come here? -By flight!

944
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:19,258
Then we took a taxi and arrived here.

945
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:21,695
I cam from Kerala. I'm a student. -Student? -Yes.

946
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,790
How did you know this is a college?

947
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:25,163
Strange!

948
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:29,135
It has a good website. -We took on line admission.

949
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,867
Who is your junior artist supplier? -What?

950
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:32,510
What are you doing here? -We're student.

951
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:32,771
What are you doing here? -We're student.

952
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,401
We got admission from web site.

953
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:37,538
I'm so happy to get admission in college finally.

954
00:51:37,648 --> 00:51:39,639
I'm just Jaipur. -I'm from Ketpur.

955
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:45,511
Hey..

956
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:55,256
Oh God. I don't understand anything.

957
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:57,699
God needs to help us!

958
00:51:57,902 --> 00:52:00,803
Everything will be fine!

959
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:03,874
God needs to help us!

960
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:05,810
God needs to help us! -Don't worry. -What will be
fine!

961
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,277
God needs to help us! -Don't worry. -What will be
fine!

962
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:08,777
I told you there will be a problem.

963
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,369
Stop it! Guys, please.

964
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:13,183
Google, please help us.

965
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:15,280
You worry too much.

966
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:18,878
I'm here.. relax. Relax.

967
00:52:20,558 --> 00:52:21,547
My friend.

968
00:52:22,793 --> 00:52:24,226
Greetings, Mr. Dubey.

969
00:52:24,328 --> 00:52:26,353
Who is Dubey? -I need a small favor.

970
00:52:26,797 --> 00:52:28,765
My friends.. 3 boys and a girl..

971
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:30,299
They're very nice.

972
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:33,769
I need high quality poison for them.

973
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:36,203
Poison. -It should kill in 2 minutes.

974
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:39,141
They shouldn't be in pain. They're my friends.

975
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:39,543
Sir. What are you doing?

976
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:40,805
Sir. What are you doing?

977
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,742
When 500 people will thrash you..

978
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:45,281
..you'll die in pain.

979
00:52:45,383 --> 00:52:47,214
Take pills and die in 2 minutes.

980
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:50,175
Simple.

981
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,549
It's the easiest way out..

982
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:53,483
..to go out and tell the truth.

983
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:55,415
That's the best option you've.

984
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:59,621
Sir. Sir, you tell the truth for us.

985
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,530
You're hiding behind me when trouble appeared.

986
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,666
I'll stay here. You do your work.

987
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:09,328
Sir. Sir, you can some more money. Please.

988
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:11,401
I told you earlier..

989
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:12,743
..I don't sell my honesty.

990
00:53:12,743 --> 00:53:13,437
..I don't sell my honesty.

991
00:53:13,544 --> 00:53:14,704
How does one lakh sound?

992
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:18,771
Forget what I said.

993
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:20,672
He likes it.

994
00:53:20,785 --> 00:53:23,276
Excuse me. Move aside. -Guys.

995
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:24,581
Make way!

996
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:26,588
Please. I'll tell you one thing.

997
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,679
Move!

998
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,638
Calm down! Just a minute.

999
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:46,210
Shut up! -We want..

1000
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,542
Shut up! -We want..

1001
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:49,635
Shut up!

1002
00:53:50,247 --> 00:53:51,236
Ouiet!

1003
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:56,344
My name is Bajirao!

1004
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:01,621
Welcome to Fakirchand and Lakirchand Trust
University.

1005
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:03,294
How many are there..

1006
00:54:03,294 --> 00:54:04,124
How many are there..

1007
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:07,422
..who didn't get admission in any other college?

1008
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:12,257
Ok.

1009
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:15,200
And.. how many here..

1010
00:54:15,573 --> 00:54:17,632
..if they find out..

1011
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,637
..that this isn't a college..

1012
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,679
Just a minute. Stop!

1013
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:27,248
They're going mad.

1014
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,342
I don't want to die for one lakh.

1015
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:32,647
Answer us!

1016
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:35,623
We came from so far!

1017
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:40,092
It's your problem, not mine. -You deal with them.

1018
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:41,721
If we don't get admission, we won't spare you!

1019
00:54:41,832 --> 00:54:44,323
They're acting just like their name.

1020
00:54:44,935 --> 00:54:46,095
You got me stuck!

1021
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:48,735
I'm sorry. It's a matter of a day.

1022
00:54:48,939 --> 00:54:50,566
Guys, please. -Do you think we're mad.

1023
00:54:50,674 --> 00:54:52,869
Answer us! -Please listen.

1024
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:57,312
Will you say something now?

1025
00:54:57,414 --> 00:54:59,473
I'm sorry, guys! -My foot!

1026
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,216
What do we do with your sorry!

1027
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:04,181
They don't understand.

1028
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:06,288
How can he stop them?

1029
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,153
We're students like you who didn't..

1030
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:09,726
..get admission in any college..

1031
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:11,785
..we started this fake college to save..

1032
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:13,523
..ourselves from our parents' anger.

1033
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,158
You've ruined the ones like you!

1034
00:55:18,435 --> 00:55:20,869
I know. It's our fault. It's very grave too.

1035
00:55:21,338 --> 00:55:22,805
We didn't do it on purpose. And..

1036
00:55:22,907 --> 00:55:25,774
What else! -Tell us!

1037
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:27,111
Website is fake too.

1038
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:27,440
Website is fake too.

1039
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,773
Get down! -Just a minute. Please.

1040
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:35,546
We lied for ourselves.

1041
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,746
But the truth is that..

1042
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:40,485
..we too didn't get admission in any college.

1043
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:43,961
My father said a fool like me won't get admission
anywhere.

1044
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:46,828
My father said a fool like me won't get admission
anywhere.

1045
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:48,424
Now where should I go?

1046
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,425
Tell us! -Guys, please. -I told my parents..

1047
00:55:52,536 --> 00:55:55,130
..I'll commit suicide if I don't get admission.

1048
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:56,228
Now what do I do?

1049
00:55:57,474 --> 00:56:00,204
My mother always cries when my result is out.

1050
00:56:00,311 --> 00:56:00,544
Today I saw joy on my mother's face for the first
time.

1051
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:03,240
Today I saw joy on my mother's face for the first
time.

1052
00:56:03,347 --> 00:56:06,077
I got stuck because of you.

1053
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:08,342
Guys, we didn't do it on purpose.

1054
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:11,588
Guys! Please listen.

1055
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:13,486
We'll find a solution.

1056
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,388
How?

1057
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:17,161
Just a second.

1058
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:17,490
Just a second.

1059
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:18,653
What's the solution?

1060
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:22,532
What will we tell our parents? -That this is a real
college..

1061
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:23,793
..and we'll study here.

1062
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:26,362
Come on. You tell us. Is this the solution?

1063
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:28,571
Yes, this is a nice solution.

1064
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:29,828
We'll stay here.

1065
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,632
Guys. This isn't possible.

1066
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:33,811
This isn't happening.

1067
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:36,339
Didn't you lie to bunk school?

1068
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,472
Guys, this.. -This is the solution.

1069
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:40,641
Stay here.. -This isn't happening.

1070
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:45,310
It's not possible.

1071
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,189
We lied for a day.

1072
00:56:48,926 --> 00:56:50,794
We learnt that college can't be ours.

1073
00:56:50,794 --> 00:56:51,726
We learnt that college can't be ours.

1074
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,495
I'm sorry. This can't be done.

1075
00:56:58,535 --> 00:57:00,435
We'll have our own college.We'll study what we
want.

1076
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:01,827
Stay here.

1077
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:03,195
Camp here!

1078
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,836
We won't get admission in any other college.

1079
00:57:07,311 --> 00:57:07,411
We'll sit here.

1080
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:08,378
We'll sit here.

1081
00:57:08,479 --> 00:57:09,673
No, guys.

1082
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,769
If I go home..

1083
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:13,315
..my uncle will break my limbs. I won't return.

1084
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:14,679
I'll stay here too. -Are you serious?

1085
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:17,811
They want to start their own college.

1086
00:57:18,555 --> 00:57:19,579
Do what you want.

1087
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:21,784
Study what you want.

1088
00:57:22,393 --> 00:57:23,724
It's a novel idea. -Yeah.

1089
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:24,495
I've to commit suicide.

1090
00:57:24,495 --> 00:57:25,757
I've to commit suicide.

1091
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:29,523
I did so many wrong things in life.

1092
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,858
This is the first wrong deed that I find very noble.

1093
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,365
What about the building?

1094
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:39,098
It has legal issues, but I can handle it. Not a
problem.

1095
00:57:39,643 --> 00:57:40,632
Principal?

1096
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:41,178
I can be a fake principal.

1097
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:43,271
I can be a fake principal.

1098
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:45,470
Why not?

1099
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:51,679
Sir, they're not going.

1100
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,619
I tried hard, but they don't understand. They just sat
down.

1101
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,249
You want building for a college.

1102
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,761
Take it. Yes!

1103
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:58,318
Take it. Yes!

1104
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:01,562
Yes, he's giving permission to use this building.

1105
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:03,690
Don't you like it?

1106
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:05,261
Are you serious, sir?

1107
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:07,269
Our college. -I'm always serious.

1108
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:08,565
Yes, your college.

1109
00:58:08,672 --> 00:58:10,105
He's your principal.

1110
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:11,572
This college.. -Yes,

1111
00:58:11,675 --> 00:58:14,511
Students, principal and college is here. So..

1112
00:58:15,479 --> 00:58:17,037
That's it. -This is a college.

1113
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:20,775
Guys! -What now?

1114
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:22,476
I've a good news for you.

1115
00:58:22,686 --> 00:58:23,675
What?

1116
00:58:24,288 --> 00:58:27,314
This is a college! -Yeah!

1117
00:58:58,389 --> 00:58:59,720
Breakfast party!

1118
00:59:08,265 --> 00:59:10,028
Why didn't you involve me in this?

1119
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:13,535
Hello! You're from Saint Peters? -Oh!

1120
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,264
So you guys don't want me here now?

1121
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:17,101
I'll hit you with egg. -What rubbish!

1122
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,401
If sir Vardhan finds out..

1123
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:20,204
..you'll be in trouble for sure.

1124
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,645
We'll see when he finds out.

1125
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,509
We'll see when he finds out.

1126
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,513
What did you say?

1127
00:59:24,615 --> 00:59:28,608
I'm saying, I'm enjoying it here. It's so beautiful.

1128
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:29,845
Let me stay here. Please.

1129
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,720
I want to stay here. It's so peaceful. -Think again.

1130
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:34,620
We won't save you from your dad.

1131
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:36,214
Guys..

1132
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,629
..let's get the party.. Rocking!

1133
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:39,152
..let's get the party.. Rocking!

1134
00:59:48,605 --> 00:59:51,233
''Let's party more!''

1135
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:59,248
''Let's party more!''

1136
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,551
Listen to me carefully,Vishnu.

1137
01:00:05,923 --> 01:00:09,723
An important part of education..

1138
01:00:10,427 --> 01:00:11,416
..is hostel life.

1139
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:13,828
It makes you strong..

1140
01:00:14,264 --> 01:00:15,253
..independent.

1141
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:17,358
So I want you..

1142
01:00:18,569 --> 01:00:19,695
..not to stay at home..

1143
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,471
..but in hostel.

1144
01:00:23,774 --> 01:00:24,900
This independence..

1145
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:26,904
..teaches you more..

1146
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:28,378
..and gives you more chance to go astray.

1147
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,744
..and gives you more chance to go astray.

1148
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,572
So..

1149
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:36,585
..I've a present for you.

1150
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:41,924
When you were very small..

1151
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,350
..and you used to make mistake..

1152
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,888
..I used to teach you a lesson with this cane.

1153
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,666
Fear is vital for every man.

1154
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:56,405
It restrains you.

1155
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:57,867
Do you understand that?

1156
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:02,112
Good! Best of luck.

1157
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:02,601
Good! Best of luck.

1158
01:01:17,628 --> 01:01:18,829
Fear restrains you.

1159
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:19,853
Fear restrains you.

1160
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:23,161
It controls you.

1161
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:39,477
''Let's party more!''

1162
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,819
''Let's party more!''

1163
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,456
''Let's party!'' -Just a minute.

1164
01:01:52,496 --> 01:01:54,327
Hello! -Yes, papa.

1165
01:01:54,431 --> 01:01:55,659
Is the study going on well?

1166
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:57,825
Yes, papa. -Where is your glass?

1167
01:01:57,935 --> 01:01:58,924
Glass?

1168
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:01,164
No. Not glass..

1169
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:02,730
..class.

1170
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,836
Class is going to start. He wanted to know where.

1171
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:07,269
Wow !

1172
01:02:07,377 --> 01:02:09,079
Early morning my son..

1173
01:02:09,613 --> 01:02:12,639
..will study in class. -What can I say?

1174
01:02:12,749 --> 01:02:14,774
I've to fulfill my promise to become successful!

1175
01:02:14,885 --> 01:02:17,251
Now I've to come tomorrow to meet you.

1176
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:18,878
You.. -But why?

1177
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,555
I miss you.

1178
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,648
I too miss you.

1179
01:02:22,926 --> 01:02:25,696
I'll come today to meet you right now. -Come fast.

1180
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:27,789
I'll come today to meet you right now. -Come fast.

1181
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:29,688
Where is the fool?

1182
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,437
Pooja, wake up.

1183
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,799
Are we there?

1184
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:42,613
I'll be back.

1185
01:02:42,613 --> 01:02:42,874
I'll be back.

1186
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:44,773
Come fast. -Yes.

1187
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,621
You're a big fool! -Papa.

1188
01:02:53,924 --> 01:02:55,448
My son is back!

1189
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,686
Why are you scolding him? He knows he's a fool.

1190
01:02:58,195 --> 01:02:59,355
Look at him.

1191
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:02,091
If he hadn't come, you would've been in trouble go!

1192
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,863
What did he do? -What?

1193
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:07,803
He was throwing this radio considering it to be
useless.

1194
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:11,331
He must've thrown many such things.

1195
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:13,868
Sir, trust me.

1196
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,200
This radio is..

1197
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:15,946
..of no use.

1198
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:16,310
..of no use.

1199
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:18,210
It's Faltu (useless)!

1200
01:03:19,616 --> 01:03:23,677
Don't use this word Faltu in front of me?

1201
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:26,849
Yes!What's useless for others..

1202
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,383
..I know the true worth of those things.

1203
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,063
Look at these things.World threw them as useless.

1204
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,496
Look at these things.World threw them as useless.

1205
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:38,295
But we made it fit to use. Right? -Yes.

1206
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:39,460
Listen.

1207
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:42,163
My house, car, clothes and your salary..

1208
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:46,408
..is all because of this different thinking.

1209
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,876
Go and do your work. -Ok.

1210
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,148
My son is back.

1211
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,308
Come. Hug me.

1212
01:03:59,523 --> 01:04:00,455
Ritesh.

1213
01:04:04,361 --> 01:04:07,421
What happened? -Nothing. Let's go.

1214
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:17,297
He's popular!

1215
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:27,709
Hello! Mike testing.

1216
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:32,312
Hello! 1. 2. Hello.

1217
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:34,551
Mike testing. -Go on.

1218
01:04:34,925 --> 01:04:36,756
There are some interesting things.

1219
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,427
Hello! Mike testing.

1220
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:43,590
I'm sharing my feeling.

1221
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,691
What's your feeling?

1222
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:49,238
How? How?

1223
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:54,709
How did this life..

1224
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:59,740
..turn musical?

1225
01:05:06,356 --> 01:05:08,051
Don't bore me.

1226
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:12,094
When I sat near a window, a girl came to me.

1227
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:14,823
Tell me more.

1228
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:18,499
I got up and turned off the lights.

1229
01:05:21,538 --> 01:05:25,372
I woke up the darkness.

1230
01:05:26,209 --> 01:05:28,200
Is this the depth of poetry?

1231
01:05:28,578 --> 01:05:31,775
I welcomed here the the bottom of my heart.

1232
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:38,378
She told me.. now sing me a song.

1233
01:05:38,722 --> 01:05:41,589
Entertain me with a song.

1234
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:45,149
I got up.. and said..

1235
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:49,523
Half go there.

1236
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:50,759
Half go there.

1237
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,835
And friend, you sing song.

1238
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:58,169
Caress me.

1239
01:05:58,942 --> 01:06:03,641
Caress me.

1240
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:07,409
Make love immortal.

1241
01:06:16,293 --> 01:06:17,817
Look at all these things.

1242
01:06:18,662 --> 01:06:21,153
The world threw them considering them useless.

1243
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:24,256
But I make it fit to use. Right?

1244
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:30,502
Friend, nothing can happen of them.

1245
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:34,507
Perfect timing.

1246
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,407
Make a drink. -I don't want to drink thank you.

1247
01:06:37,514 --> 01:06:38,879
Why? Did you drink too much?

1248
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:41,176
No, sir. Actually I didn't drink today.

1249
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:43,275
Hangover!

1250
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,821
Sir.. -One drink will fix everything. I swear.

1251
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,220
Sir, leave that.

1252
01:06:48,325 --> 01:06:49,815
I want to talk about something serious.

1253
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:51,850
Tell me.

1254
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:53,859
Sir, what are we doing here?

1255
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:58,733
I mean it's not wrong to party. I want to do it too.

1256
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,169
But if we keep doing this, we'll prove..

1257
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:02,795
..the world right about us.

1258
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,604
I want to prove them wrong.

1259
01:07:05,075 --> 01:07:06,201
I want to show them..

1260
01:07:06,509 --> 01:07:08,238
..if we 'Useless' make our mind..

1261
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,477
..we can be better than the best.

1262
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,039
Either I'm high..

1263
01:07:15,218 --> 01:07:16,845
..or he has actually said it.

1264
01:07:17,487 --> 01:07:19,387
I'm serious about this college.

1265
01:07:19,823 --> 01:07:21,848
I don't want to misuse this freedom.

1266
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,854
You shouldn't do that.

1267
01:07:25,695 --> 01:07:26,753
What will you do now?

1268
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:28,626
What can I do? You suggest me.

1269
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:30,393
How can I do? -What do you mean?

1270
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,365
Do wicket keeping? You're good at it.

1271
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:34,433
Meaning? -I mean..

1272
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:38,672
Become wicket keeping captain of those Useless
players.

1273
01:07:39,576 --> 01:07:40,873
Bring them on the right track.

1274
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,433
How?

1275
01:07:42,646 --> 01:07:44,079
The way Dhoni does.

1276
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:47,211
Come on, Bhajji. -The next ball will be on target.

1277
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:48,511
Don't worry.

1278
01:07:48,618 --> 01:07:50,085
Come on. That's it!

1279
01:07:50,253 --> 01:07:51,345
Just encourage them.

1280
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:52,443
Encourage them.

1281
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,614
Basically..

1282
01:07:56,726 --> 01:07:58,318
..as long as these Useless..

1283
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:00,191
..don't get on track..

1284
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:03,096
..you've to run after them. -Exactly.

1285
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:05,060
Discipline them.

1286
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,163
Who are here too. -Catch it.

1287
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:08,294
We'll see too.

1288
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:09,770
You become the captain.

1289
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,705
Wicket keeping. Encouragement.

1290
01:08:13,877 --> 01:08:15,469
Discipline them.

1291
01:08:16,313 --> 01:08:17,439
Everything will be fine.

1292
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,218
Wake up, all the dear ones!

1293
01:08:28,858 --> 01:08:31,418
A new day has come.

1294
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:32,552
Who turned

1295
01:08:32,662 --> 01:08:35,460
Better move your body. -What happened to light?

1296
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:38,864
And shake your bum! -Why did the light turned off?

1297
01:08:39,135 --> 01:08:41,467
Didn't you pay bill? -What happened to lights?

1298
01:08:42,772 --> 01:08:43,761
Guys.

1299
01:08:44,741 --> 01:08:45,867
I turned off the power.

1300
01:08:46,242 --> 01:08:47,231
Ritesh..

1301
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:48,738
..what are you doing here?

1302
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,510
I want to talk to you seriously.

1303
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,076
Khusboo!

1304
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:57,247
Your mom wants to know..

1305
01:08:57,354 --> 01:08:58,651
..did you fail again!

1306
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:02,152
If you fail, don't send the result home.

1307
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,826
Your dad is a heart patient.

1308
01:09:05,462 --> 01:09:06,451
Ramdhir..

1309
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:07,825
..your dad says..

1310
01:09:08,365 --> 01:09:10,128
..he took care of both your police cases.

1311
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,458
He hopes..

1312
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:13,460
..you didn't break any skull here.

1313
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:16,430
Montu Shontu.

1314
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,798
Your mom and dad write..

1315
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:20,201
..after you left..

1316
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:21,709
..there is peace in the area.

1317
01:09:23,613 --> 01:09:25,342
They request you..

1318
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:27,848
..spend Diwali vacation in the college.

1319
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:30,518
Why are you reading our personal letters?

1320
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:32,349
I'm sorry guys, but if these letters were..

1321
01:09:32,455 --> 01:09:34,184
..personal, they wouldn't be on floor.

1322
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,689
What to do with letters?

1323
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:38,854
It has only abuses.

1324
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:40,619
Reading them makes me feel..

1325
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,288
..my mother is still abusing me.

1326
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,661
Because we deserve it.

1327
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:46,768
We've made so many mistakes in life..

1328
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:50,530
..that our parents only expect mistakes from us.

1329
01:09:51,474 --> 01:09:54,170
I think it's time to prove them wrong. -Meaning?

1330
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:55,266
It's simple.

1331
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,812
In Faltu, now we'll enjoy and study too.

1332
01:09:58,281 --> 01:09:59,646
He'll make us study.

1333
01:09:59,749 --> 01:10:01,376
What rubbish!

1334
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:04,182
Did you take drugs with liquor last night?

1335
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:06,846
Guys, come on. Be serious.

1336
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:08,279
Be serious.

1337
01:10:08,491 --> 01:10:10,118
The truth is that we didn't throw..

1338
01:10:10,226 --> 01:10:11,591
..letters because of scolding..

1339
01:10:11,694 --> 01:10:13,252
..but because of guilt.

1340
01:10:13,363 --> 01:10:14,853
Because truth is written in it.

1341
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:19,224
As a founder of Faltu, I've decided, we'll study too.

1342
01:10:19,402 --> 01:10:20,391
Founder!

1343
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:22,300
We don't consider you founder!

1344
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:23,702
We've paid the fees.

1345
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:25,832
Why waste money on books?

1346
01:10:26,276 --> 01:10:27,334
Right, people?

1347
01:10:27,444 --> 01:10:29,469
Yes.Very true. -Yes.

1348
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:32,878
Better than buying books, I rather buy beer.

1349
01:10:35,185 --> 01:10:37,585
Guys, listen.. -Leave it, Ritesh.

1350
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,618
Out of all the people, you're saying this..

1351
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:42,758
..who has only partied all his life.

1352
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,352
Yes. But I want to do something constructive.

1353
01:10:45,462 --> 01:10:47,396
Hear him.. -Vishnu explain to them.

1354
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:49,192
Don't talk like my father.

1355
01:10:50,967 --> 01:10:55,267
Brothers, if I had to study, I'd be in Saint Peters.

1356
01:10:56,272 --> 01:10:58,672
Let's go! -Guys!

1357
01:10:58,775 --> 01:11:01,471
Guys, come on. It's not such a bad idea!

1358
01:11:01,578 --> 01:11:02,875
They're only passing time.

1359
01:11:03,446 --> 01:11:05,175
Guys.. -They'll do something.

1360
01:11:05,415 --> 01:11:07,406
Even their parents couldn't do anything for them.

1361
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,314
What will we do in a few days?

1362
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:10,477
This is our work.

1363
01:11:10,587 --> 01:11:12,418
Principal's work is to inspire them.

1364
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:13,887
To guide them.

1365
01:11:14,557 --> 01:11:16,525
They'll do something one day.

1366
01:11:18,561 --> 01:11:19,653
Now what?

1367
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:20,885
I don't know.

1368
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,688
What's up?

1369
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:25,491
Nobody is taking me seriously.

1370
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:28,494
They won't get serious like this. -Then?

1371
01:11:30,306 --> 01:11:31,466
You've phone? -Yes.

1372
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:37,813
Yes, mother. -Yes, father.

1373
01:11:39,315 --> 01:11:40,839
Yes, father. -Yes, mother.

1374
01:11:41,518 --> 01:11:42,610
What?

1375
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:45,445
Yes.. -Oh!

1376
01:11:46,589 --> 01:11:47,920
Hello. Yes.

1377
01:11:56,799 --> 01:11:59,199
Ok. First class.

1378
01:11:59,302 --> 01:12:00,860
Ok, bye. Bye.

1379
01:12:04,574 --> 01:12:05,836
No need to come.

1380
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:07,633
I'm in class room. I'll call later.

1381
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,212
Studying is going on well. Exams are near.

1382
01:12:10,313 --> 01:12:12,474
Yes.There is no problem.

1383
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:13,844
Yes.

1384
01:12:14,117 --> 01:12:15,448
Yes, papa. I'm here.

1385
01:12:15,552 --> 01:12:16,678
Yes!

1386
01:12:33,536 --> 01:12:36,505
I'm bored but you're enjoying your study.

1387
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:37,903
What's the matter?

1388
01:12:38,174 --> 01:12:39,198
I'm not studying.

1389
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:41,777
I'm dreaming..

1390
01:12:41,878 --> 01:12:42,867
Wow !

1391
01:12:53,923 --> 01:12:55,254
How is study?

1392
01:12:58,394 --> 01:12:59,656
Sorry.

1393
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,055
Are you hurt?

1394
01:13:01,264 --> 01:13:02,390
Can book hurt anyone?

1395
01:13:02,498 --> 01:13:04,159
Why did you throw the book? -It's tough.

1396
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,389
Very tough.

1397
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:06,591
It's true, but..

1398
01:13:07,737 --> 01:13:09,705
We've to study.

1399
01:13:14,744 --> 01:13:16,803
Khusboo, ask him.

1400
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,438
Please.

1401
01:13:21,651 --> 01:13:25,178
Vishnu. One more..

1402
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:26,755
Please tell us one more time.

1403
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,226
One more time. One more time!

1404
01:13:31,794 --> 01:13:34,558
Don't read that! I'll become book! Read me!

1405
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:37,462
It's so simple. E = MC2.

1406
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:40,325
If you take so much time, how will finish?

1407
01:13:44,941 --> 01:13:46,670
Don't cry, Khusboo!

1408
01:13:47,577 --> 01:13:50,569
I'm very stressed. -At least you know what you've to
do.

1409
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,375
I don't know about myself.

1410
01:13:52,482 --> 01:13:54,780
I too don't know what to do.

1411
01:14:11,434 --> 01:14:13,231
Experiment successful!

1412
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:16,827
What happened?

1413
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:19,106
Can't you see the experiment?

1414
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,470
Great!

1415
01:14:20,576 --> 01:14:23,374
Sontu, what did you make? -He made it.

1416
01:14:23,913 --> 01:14:25,847
I've mixed all the ingredients.

1417
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:34,482
Hey, douse it! -What are you doing?

1418
01:15:09,726 --> 01:15:11,694
People write books with such hard labour.

1419
01:15:12,762 --> 01:15:13,751
So that..

1420
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:15,759
..it's useful to the readers.

1421
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,299
But you..

1422
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:24,595
Google.

1423
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:27,838
I.. can't be their principal.

1424
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:32,503
I quit.

1425
01:15:36,886 --> 01:15:38,478
You must've enjoyed burning them.

1426
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:41,382
You know what's burning?

1427
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:43,449
Your future!

1428
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,223
I too made this mistake.

1429
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:48,589
Do you know the result?

1430
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:52,233
Struggle all my life!

1431
01:15:53,269 --> 01:15:55,464
In the end, I got this stupid van.

1432
01:15:56,406 --> 01:15:58,237
This is my house and office too.

1433
01:15:59,308 --> 01:16:01,367
Sir, sorry. -No. Please.

1434
01:16:01,477 --> 01:16:03,638
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry.

1435
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:06,674
I'm sorry, I trusted guys like you.

1436
01:16:07,116 --> 01:16:08,208
I brought these books.

1437
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:09,740
I'm sorry that..

1438
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:11,820
..I thought I can make a university here.

1439
01:16:12,088 --> 01:16:13,146
I was a fool.

1440
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:16,618
I want you to pack your bags and leave.

1441
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:17,848
All of you all!

1442
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,528
Sir. -Sir, please.

1443
01:16:22,432 --> 01:16:26,801
Sir. Sir, please. -Please stop.

1444
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:30,599
Sir, we too thought that..

1445
01:16:30,807 --> 01:16:32,707
..we'll do something here.We even tried.

1446
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:33,833
But we couldn't.

1447
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:36,834
I know we don't want to study, but we don't want
to leave too.

1448
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:39,677
Sir, please don't close this place down.

1449
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:42,310
We accept any punishment you give us.

1450
01:16:48,925 --> 01:16:52,190
Fine. Then..

1451
01:16:53,362 --> 01:16:54,488
..for your punishment..

1452
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,155
..be prepared!

1453
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:07,568
I'm scared.

1454
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,708
What is it?

1455
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:26,090
Sir, how long do we've to sit here?

1456
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:29,190
Why? Are you scared?

1457
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:31,326
Yes.

1458
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:34,567
Your parents too get so scared thinking about your
future.

1459
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,199
How long can you survive in life without doing
anything.

1460
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:44,506
6 months? 1 year?

1461
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:46,780
Your parents are with you today.

1462
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:50,079
When they won't be there in future..

1463
01:17:50,419 --> 01:17:51,477
..what will you do?

1464
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:55,552
It won't take much time to reach here.

1465
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:57,317
I promise you that.

1466
01:17:58,461 --> 01:17:59,485
This is your future.

1467
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,728
If you don't want to stay here..

1468
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:03,254
..then think..

1469
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:06,067
..in the college you made with hard work..

1470
01:18:06,836 --> 01:18:08,303
..what do you want to do there?

1471
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:10,697
If you can't think, it's simple.

1472
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:13,332
We'll go on our ways.

1473
01:18:13,676 --> 01:18:14,665
College will close.

1474
01:18:17,113 --> 01:18:18,239
I give you five minutes.

1475
01:18:19,248 --> 01:18:20,374
In these five minutes..

1476
01:18:20,716 --> 01:18:21,705
..whoever decides..

1477
01:18:22,752 --> 01:18:24,276
..will come to college with us.

1478
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,086
5 minutes? -I don't understand anything.

1479
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,178
In 5 minutes.

1480
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,259
Sir, what do you feel?

1481
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:32,259
Didn't our parents try this?

1482
01:18:32,461 --> 01:18:34,656
My father used to lock me in rooms in exam days.

1483
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:36,790
But it was of no use.

1484
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,631
Sir, we don't like books.

1485
01:18:40,202 --> 01:18:41,499
Then study what you like.

1486
01:18:42,104 --> 01:18:43,435
Who told you that only Arts..

1487
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:45,200
..Science and Commerce is education.

1488
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:47,199
Life is the biggest school.

1489
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:50,208
In this school, every subject is available.

1490
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:53,210
So think.. what are you hobbies?

1491
01:18:54,216 --> 01:18:56,582
What will you do with your heart?

1492
01:18:58,387 --> 01:18:59,684
You've 2 minutes more.

1493
01:18:59,789 --> 01:19:00,778

Sir. -Yes.

01:20:11,427 --> 01:20:13,622
All the best. -Thank you, sir.

1523
01:20:16,432 --> 01:20:17,421

''My heart sings cheerfully..''

1526
01:20:41,223 --> 01:20:44,750
''It's solving all my confusion.''

1527
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:54,601
''There is passion and obsession.''

1528
01:20:54,704 --> 01:21:00,643
''We've found the way to destination.''

1529
01:21:01,711 --> 01:21:06,239

01:21:27,236 --> 01:21:28,362
Very nice. -Really?

1535
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:30,098
And.. -Listen.

1536
01:21:30,206 --> 01:21:31,264
Put it in your mouth.

Wow! Thank you.

1539
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:53,553
You know what I mean.. a presentation.

1540
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:57,788
Get out of here!

1541
01:21:58,801 --> 01:22:01,770
No! It will pain.

1542
01:22:02,705 --> 01:22:04,536
''When I saw..'

1543
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,164
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1544
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:09,733
What are you doing? Get down. Come!

1545
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:12,640
What are you doing? I'll tell you how it's done.

1546
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:14,246
Take a stance.

1547
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:16,548
Tilt the leg. Bent it.

1548
01:22:19,488 --> 01:22:21,183
Don't feel me, feel the song.

1549
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:23,620
Acting is very easy. I thought..

1550
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:25,717
It's easy to become an actor.

1551
01:22:25,828 --> 01:22:27,261
It's hard to get work.

1552
01:22:27,363 --> 01:22:28,853
Come on. Move it.

1553
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:30,598
Move up not down.

1554
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,195
One more set.

1555
01:22:33,302 --> 01:22:34,291
What happened?

1556
01:22:34,403 --> 01:22:35,392
I'm training them.

1557
01:22:35,838 --> 01:22:36,896
They're so exhausted.

1558
01:22:37,706 --> 01:22:39,367
I made them do as much I do.

1559
01:22:39,842 --> 01:22:40,831
How?

1560
01:22:42,244 --> 01:22:43,233
Did I overdo it?

1561
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:45,575
Of course. -Look at their condition.

1562
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:47,478
Teachers. -Yes, sir.

1563
01:22:47,783 --> 01:22:48,772
Are you mad?

1564
01:22:48,884 --> 01:22:49,908
We've to bring them.

1565
01:22:50,252 --> 01:22:51,514
They all like it..

1566
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:54,381
..but we need professional help for guidance.

1567
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,515
I can get professors for you.

1568
01:22:57,293 --> 01:22:58,590
But they'll expose our secret.

1569
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:01,354
I've to cut everyone's tongue.

1570
01:23:01,463 --> 01:23:02,794
There should be a way or..

1571
01:23:02,898 --> 01:23:04,422
..our learning will be incomplete.

1572
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:05,557
Why?

1573
01:23:06,268 --> 01:23:07,826
Teachers are important.

1574
01:23:08,437 --> 01:23:11,099
But teachings is more important.

1575
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,568
If teachers can't come here..

1576
01:23:13,242 --> 01:23:14,573
..bring their teachings.

1577
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:16,600
How?

1578
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:17,801
By shooting.

1579
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:21,080
Record the professors.

1580
01:23:21,684 --> 01:23:23,743
Make episodes of their lectures.

1581
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:25,780
And then show like a film in college.

1582
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:29,118
Make college into a theatre. -Make lecture into a
picture.

1583
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:31,420
Entertainment as well as education.

1584
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:33,324
Digital education! -Absolutely.

1585
01:23:33,429 --> 01:23:34,418
What an idea?

1586
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:35,724
They'll like it too now.

1587
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:37,689
Just think, everyone will come to college..

1588
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,325
..and watch picture too. -Great! -Wow!

1589
01:23:41,303 --> 01:23:42,770
Google, can I get a camera?

1590
01:23:43,672 --> 01:23:44,661
Why not?

1591
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:47,303
Guys. Attention here!

1592
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:51,209
We've to convince them anyhow.

1593
01:23:51,947 --> 01:23:53,915
They might not even entertain you.

1594
01:23:54,683 --> 01:23:55,775
But we won't give up.

1595
01:23:56,518 --> 01:23:59,817
We've to make these professors our college
professors.

1596
01:24:06,295 --> 01:24:08,763
I'm Ritesh. I took appointment on behalf of Faltu
college.

1597
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:18,874
Guys! -Hey!

1598
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:30,618
Great! You'll teach hair styling in your college!

1599
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,346
It's an innovative idea.

1600
01:24:32,454 --> 01:24:34,513
I'll help you for sure.

1601
01:24:41,864 --> 01:24:44,731
''By molding and twisting..''

1602
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:47,597
''..we've made destinies.'

1603
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:51,504
''The restrained thoughts..''

1604
01:24:51,607 --> 01:24:53,837
''..have been unshackled.'

1605
01:24:55,611 --> 01:24:58,546
''By molding and twisting..''

1606
01:24:58,647 --> 01:25:01,343
''..we've made destinies.'

1607
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,849
Good!

1608
01:25:03,485 --> 01:25:05,112
Hi! -Wow!

1609
01:25:06,422 --> 01:25:07,411
Hi!

1610
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,447
It feels so nice.

1611
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,254
Everyone is so serious in their work and they don't
even know.

1612
01:25:14,663 --> 01:25:15,652
Look..

1613
01:25:15,764 --> 01:25:18,130
..they were partying a few days ago and today..

1614
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:20,133
..they've started their business. -I know.

1615
01:25:20,536 --> 01:25:23,300
Alternate education is the most important thing.

1616
01:25:23,505 --> 01:25:26,303
There are no colleges to teach all these things.
-Yeah.

1617
01:25:26,608 --> 01:25:31,102
If a man makes hobby his profession, success is
guaranteed.

1618
01:25:31,213 --> 01:25:32,202
Yes.

1619
01:25:32,414 --> 01:25:33,540
You know their problems?

1620
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:35,741
They've listened to others all their lives.

1621
01:25:35,851 --> 01:25:37,148
They never listened to themselves.

1622
01:25:37,252 --> 01:25:38,617
When they listen to themselves..

1623
01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:40,348
..they don't listen to others. -Right.

1624
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:44,859
If it was available during our days..

1625
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:46,558
..we would've been geniuses.

1626
01:25:47,429 --> 01:25:52,162
Do you think it's important to be genius or make
geniuses?

1627
01:26:03,212 --> 01:26:04,201
Sir. -Good.

1628
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,507
Sir, I've made a website.

1629
01:26:07,383 --> 01:26:08,372
You? -Yes.

1630
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:10,480
Vishnu made it, but..

1631
01:26:10,686 --> 01:26:11,675
..idea was mine.

1632
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:13,754
WWW. I'm Faltu. Com.

1633
01:26:14,223 --> 01:26:15,315
Really? What's in that?

1634
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:17,487
Basically at home..

1635
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:21,120
..from any computer in any state or country..

1636
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:24,627
In short, whatever question you ask you get an
answer.

1637
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,428
I've uploaded all the videos.

1638
01:26:27,202 --> 01:26:28,829
You uploaded all the videos? -Yes.

1639
01:26:29,338 --> 01:26:32,330
Now many students like us don't get admission
anywhere.

1640
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,672
They can study at home through this website.

1641
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,199
Not bad.

1642
01:26:36,412 --> 01:26:37,401
Try it, sir.

1643
01:26:37,546 --> 01:26:38,535
Please try.

1644
01:26:38,647 --> 01:26:40,239
Are you serious?

1645
01:26:40,349 --> 01:26:41,577
I'm seriously. -Ok.

1646
01:26:46,155 --> 01:26:49,591
''My heart sings cheerfully..''

1647
01:26:52,494 --> 01:26:56,396
''It's solving all my confusion.''

1648
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:06,268
''There is passion and obsession.''

1649
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:12,208
''We've found the way to destination.''

1650
01:27:14,283 --> 01:27:18,652
''It's going to be a new dawn.''

1651
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:25,424
''It's going to start of a new friendship.''

1652
01:27:26,428 --> 01:27:32,128
''Life is going to be great..'

1653
01:27:33,435 --> 01:27:40,534
''It's going to be a new dawn.''

1654
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:42,877
Dance as a subject? Very nice.

1655
01:27:43,145 --> 01:27:46,205
At least someone thought of subjects like this.

1656
01:27:46,315 --> 01:27:47,748
I wish I had a college like that.

1657
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,545
I wouldn't have struggled so much.

1658
01:27:49,651 --> 01:27:51,448
Dance professor of Faltu college.

1659
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:58,224
In order to become a good fashion designer..

1660
01:27:58,327 --> 01:28:01,387
..pattern making is a very crucial part. -It's
important to know..

1661
01:28:01,497 --> 01:28:05,126
..not only to draw and sketch to become a good
designer.

1662
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:09,364
Learning the art of cutting and making clothes..

1663
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:11,132
..is complete package..

1664
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,605
..for you to be a good designer.

1665
01:28:14,743 --> 01:28:16,233
I'm a people's director.

1666
01:28:16,345 --> 01:28:19,075
I'm make films from audience point of view.

1667
01:28:19,414 --> 01:28:20,847
I mean if I had a restaurant..

1668
01:28:21,283 --> 01:28:23,114
..I would've sold only those food..

1669
01:28:23,318 --> 01:28:24,546
..which people want to eat.

1670
01:28:24,653 --> 01:28:27,178
Not those food that I want to feed the people.

1671
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:29,186
So always try to keep in mind..

1672
01:28:29,424 --> 01:28:30,652
..we work for the audience.

1673
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:34,786
Let them become doctor, engineer or sports
person.

1674
01:28:35,364 --> 01:28:37,161
You become a trainer.

1675
01:28:37,432 --> 01:28:40,230
Because I love my work.

1676
01:28:40,502 --> 01:28:42,367
No matter how you're..

1677
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:43,631
..believe me..

1678
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:46,139
..I'll make you He-man in four sessions.

1679
01:28:46,241 --> 01:28:49,210
I'll make you a world class body-builder very soon.

1680
01:28:49,444 --> 01:28:51,639
If you're interested in fashion you've to work hard..

1681
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:53,305
..and educate yourself.

1682
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:56,782
How is the fashion industry progressing worldwide?

1683
01:28:56,885 --> 01:28:59,752
If are passionate about it, follow it. It's what I've
done.

1684
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:01,652
We count the beat 1, 2, 3, 4.

1685
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:04,089
You've to know four beats make one.

1686
01:29:04,193 --> 01:29:07,094
It's very important to thing to be a DJ.

1687
01:29:07,196 --> 01:29:09,096
The second thing is beats.

1688
01:29:09,364 --> 01:29:11,059
Beats per minute is basically nothing..

1689
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,633
..but the speed of the song.

1690
01:29:13,702 --> 01:29:15,363
Once you know the speed of the song..

1691
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:16,698
..and the song you're going to mix..

1692
01:29:16,805 --> 01:29:18,238
..you should know the speed of the next song.

1693
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,535
You can match both of them and mix them
together.

1694
01:29:20,776 --> 01:29:23,574
You get a nice flow and groove going in your night
club.

1695
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,374
All the best to DJs.

1696
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:28,310
Were their more on Friday?

1697
01:29:29,318 --> 01:29:30,410
Not even one.

1698
01:29:33,589 --> 01:29:36,149
Liquor bill is 80% less. Do you know it?

1699
01:29:37,893 --> 01:29:39,383
80 percent!

1700
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:46,426
Ritesh! -What? -See what I've got.

1701
01:29:46,735 --> 01:29:49,067
A letter! -What happened to him?

1702
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:53,107
A letter from postman!

1703
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:55,335
Annual competition in Saint Peter's college.

1704
01:29:56,778 --> 01:29:58,837
All the colleges will compete there. -Show it to me.

1705
01:29:59,514 --> 01:30:01,448
We should go and tell them what we're.

1706
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:03,882
Let's show them what we're.

1707
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:07,154
Postman, come here!

1708
01:30:07,256 --> 01:30:08,348
Don't be too excited.

1709
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:11,320
If we perform, your father will come to know.

1710
01:30:11,793 --> 01:30:13,283
And our college..

1711
01:30:15,697 --> 01:30:17,255
Do you get it?

1712
01:30:19,368 --> 01:30:21,666
Pooja. You wanted to be something else besides DJ.

1713
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:24,330
Sir, I wanted to be an astronaut. -Why?

1714
01:30:25,307 --> 01:30:27,605
Since childhood I wanted to climb the moon.

1715
01:30:29,544 --> 01:30:31,535
Ritesh, what do you want to become?

1716
01:30:31,647 --> 01:30:33,638
I wanted to be a big businessman.

1717
01:30:34,516 --> 01:30:36,677
But now I think it's better to become a moon.

1718
01:30:40,222 --> 01:30:42,247
You've studied a lot.

1719
01:30:42,357 --> 01:30:47,192
Now forget the tension and become fully.. -Faltu!

1720
01:31:03,178 --> 01:31:06,443
''Don't get tense.'

1721
01:31:06,648 --> 01:31:10,140
''Forget the sermons of the world.''

1722
01:31:13,655 --> 01:31:17,113
''Don't get tense.'

1723
01:31:17,225 --> 01:31:20,126
''Forget the sermons of the world.''

1724
01:31:20,228 --> 01:31:27,157
''If you want to be great, chant this Mantra..''

1725
01:31:27,636 --> 01:31:30,833
''God save us from troubles!''

1726
01:31:30,939 --> 01:31:34,534
''Forget your worries tension and become fully
Faltu!'

1727
01:31:34,643 --> 01:31:37,908
''God save us from troubles!''

1728
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:41,581
''Forget your worries tension and become fully
Faltu!'

1729
01:32:26,595 --> 01:32:30,463
''Youth passed in being a bookworm.''

1730
01:32:33,435 --> 01:32:37,701
''Don't spend your life in vain.''

1731
01:32:40,442 --> 01:32:44,344
''Youth passed in being a bookworm.''

1732
01:32:44,446 --> 01:32:47,711
''Don't spend your life in vain.''

1733
01:32:47,816 --> 01:32:51,252
''You will grow old soon.'

1734
01:32:51,486 --> 01:32:54,887
''Listen to me.''

1735
01:32:55,157 --> 01:33:01,562
''Before you die, chant this Mantra..''

1736
01:33:01,663 --> 01:33:05,224
''God save us from troubles!''

1737
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:08,734
''Forget your worries tension and become fully
Faltu!'

1738
01:33:08,837 --> 01:33:12,238
''God save us from troubles!''

1739
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:15,673
''Forget your worries tension and become fully
Faltu!'

1740
01:33:26,321 --> 01:33:27,481
Vishnu! -Hey..

1741
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:47,333
Not now. Come.

1742
01:33:51,746 --> 01:33:52,838
The picnic is over.

1743
01:33:54,249 --> 01:33:58,345
You don't know what crime you did. -We know.

1744
01:33:58,753 --> 01:34:00,653
Now you'll know what we're.

1745
01:34:00,755 --> 01:34:02,484
I'll tell you what will happen.

1746
01:34:02,691 --> 01:34:04,522
For crime of making fake college..

1747
01:34:05,227 --> 01:34:06,558
..you all will go to jail.

1748
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:09,286
I don't think so, sir. I don't think we'll go to jail.

1749
01:34:10,165 --> 01:34:11,154
Stay order.

1750
01:34:16,705 --> 01:34:19,401
If you think seeing this court order..

1751
01:34:19,741 --> 01:34:20,867
..I'll think..

1752
01:34:21,443 --> 01:34:22,603
..that you'll get saved..

1753
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:24,608
..then you're all sadly mistaken.

1754
01:34:24,713 --> 01:34:26,874
We'll meet in court after 7 days.

1755
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:30,475
In such a short time, what will you do?

1756
01:34:30,585 --> 01:34:32,382
They made a college in one day..

1757
01:34:33,488 --> 01:34:35,319
..seven days are a lot for them.

1758
01:34:35,624 --> 01:34:36,818
They'll manage something.

1759
01:34:36,925 --> 01:34:39,416
For misguiding my son..

1760
01:34:40,161 --> 01:34:41,321
..I'll make sure..

1761
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:45,395
..you all will have to pay a very heavy price for that.

1762
01:34:48,537 --> 01:34:49,697
Mr.Vardhan.

1763
01:34:51,873 --> 01:34:52,862
Let go.

1764
01:35:08,223 --> 01:35:09,315
7 days!

1765
01:35:21,703 --> 01:35:24,536
How will we do it? -Don't worry!

1766
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:27,301
We'll hire a good lawyer.We'll be out of this.

1767
01:35:27,409 --> 01:35:28,808
I hope so. -It's of no use.

1768
01:35:29,678 --> 01:35:31,202
I've broken so many laws..

1769
01:35:31,313 --> 01:35:33,213
..I've become half lawyer.

1770
01:35:33,882 --> 01:35:36,180
You're trespassing on someone's private property.

1771
01:35:36,284 --> 01:35:37,808
And opening up a whole..

1772
01:35:37,919 --> 01:35:40,387
..illegal institution.. I mean what's wrong with you.

1773
01:35:40,655 --> 01:35:42,350
It's not so easy to win this case.

1774
01:35:42,457 --> 01:35:44,550
But.. we can't give at this stage. -He's here.

1775
01:35:44,659 --> 01:35:46,092
Bajirao! -Where were you, sir?

1776
01:35:48,296 --> 01:35:50,127
Fake college! -Oh God!

1777
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:51,493
Not just in this paper..

1778
01:35:52,233 --> 01:35:53,495
..but it's in every paper.

1779
01:35:54,302 --> 01:35:55,735
Not just newspaper..

1780
01:35:56,271 --> 01:35:57,499
..but every news channel..

1781
01:35:57,606 --> 01:35:59,437
..is blowing Faltu college apart.

1782
01:36:00,275 --> 01:36:01,435
We've officially become..

1783
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:03,204
..a national disgrace.

1784
01:36:03,311 --> 01:36:04,300
Read it.

1785
01:36:05,113 --> 01:36:07,172
So this was UGC councilor, Mr.Vardhan.

1786
01:36:07,382 --> 01:36:09,316
He exposed this news.

1787
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:11,715
Let us remind you about the news..

1788
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:14,380
..that shook up the educational system.

1789
01:36:14,489 --> 01:36:16,354
Fake college. Faltu.

1790
01:36:19,394 --> 01:36:20,793
Papa.

1791
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:28,266
You cheat your parents. -Please.

1792
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:31,498
I've no place in my house for useless kid like you.

1793
01:36:32,907 --> 01:36:34,431
You're dead for me.

1794
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:36,142
Never show me your face again.

1795
01:36:36,478 --> 01:36:38,378
Never! Never!

1796
01:36:41,249 --> 01:36:43,547
I made many excuses in front of you.

1797
01:36:45,153 --> 01:36:46,711
But I won't do anything like that today.

1798
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:49,218
It's all because of me and..

1799
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:51,188
..this was my idea.

1800
01:36:52,661 --> 01:36:53,650
Son.

1801
01:36:55,664 --> 01:36:57,859
You're a bigger scarp dealer than your father.

1802
01:36:59,467 --> 01:37:00,399
I only..

1803
01:37:00,635 --> 01:37:02,830
..understood the worth of broken household
articles.

1804
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,098
But you understood the real worth of these people.
-What?

1805
01:37:10,845 --> 01:37:11,834
Fool..

1806
01:37:12,313 --> 01:37:14,372
..look at them from the point of view of a scrap
dealer.

1807
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:19,277
These kids are such scraps..

1808
01:37:19,888 --> 01:37:22,550
..who didn't even value themselves.

1809
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:25,422
Now.. now look at them..

1810
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,320
..here I'm seeing on their faces..

1811
01:37:29,264 --> 01:37:30,253
What is it called?

1812
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:32,456
Confidence! I can see confidence.

1813
01:37:33,334 --> 01:37:35,859
As if they've seen their destination.

1814
01:37:37,706 --> 01:37:40,641
This is all because of your Faltu.

1815
01:37:42,143 --> 01:37:44,839
I know you're ashamed that your father is a scrap
dealer.

1816
01:37:46,114 --> 01:37:48,514
But I'm proud of what you did.

1817
01:37:50,285 --> 01:37:51,775
Come and hug me!

1818
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:57,480
Listen.

1819
01:37:57,926 --> 01:38:00,087
This is a scrap dealer's view.

1820
01:38:00,428 --> 01:38:01,622
Everyone doesn't think so.

1821
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:06,089
So you've to prove and explain all this to the world.

1822
01:38:08,303 --> 01:38:11,136
You brought them here.

1823
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:13,737
It's your duty to get them out of this trouble.

1824
01:38:14,776 --> 01:38:16,141
My businessman!

1825
01:38:17,178 --> 01:38:19,146
They depend on you.

1826
01:38:20,248 --> 01:38:23,183
Thank you, dad.Thank you.

1827
01:38:30,225 --> 01:38:31,283
After mom's death..

1828
01:38:31,392 --> 01:38:33,860
I saw tears in papa's eyes for the first time.

1829
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,623
I broke his heart.. -Do you know..

1830
01:38:39,634 --> 01:38:41,124
..my father too cried bitterly.

1831
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:43,464
You're very lucky.

1832
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:45,399
My parents..

1833
01:38:45,507 --> 01:38:46,872
..didn't even answer my phone.

1834
01:38:47,242 --> 01:38:48,641
They sent a message..

1835
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:50,372
..that I should forget them..

1836
01:38:50,545 --> 01:38:51,705
..and never return home.

1837
01:38:52,881 --> 01:38:54,610
Guys! What are you doing?

1838
01:38:55,283 --> 01:38:56,807
Don't you want to make preparations?

1839
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:58,442
Sir, explain to them.

1840
01:38:59,354 --> 01:39:00,321
What is he saying?

1841
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:01,615
I mean.. -I've no idea.

1842
01:39:01,723 --> 01:39:03,782
Look at them. -Sir, we've to give exam.

1843
01:39:04,225 --> 01:39:05,590
Our term is about to end.

1844
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,350
Come on, Ritesh. Grew up, man.

1845
01:39:07,862 --> 01:39:09,159
It's not a time to joke.

1846
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:11,591
No, dude. This is time for test.

1847
01:39:13,268 --> 01:39:17,068
Guys, this test isn't of DJ, acting or management.

1848
01:39:17,672 --> 01:39:19,333
This test is about our existence..

1849
01:39:19,674 --> 01:39:20,663
..and our belief.

1850
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:23,266
I'm sorry, guys.

1851
01:39:23,478 --> 01:39:26,345
I know you're thinking of your families right now.

1852
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:29,607
But.. I'm thinking of this family right now.

1853
01:39:30,318 --> 01:39:31,307
About Faltu.

1854
01:39:32,854 --> 01:39:36,483
Guys, we're not companion of such parties..

1855
01:39:37,425 --> 01:39:39,154
..but we've learnt a lot from one another.

1856
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:40,522
We've supported one another.

1857
01:39:41,763 --> 01:39:43,560
No matter what the world says, but..

1858
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:46,663
..I'm proud of myself and all of you guys here..

1859
01:39:48,269 --> 01:39:49,395
..for your achievements..

1860
01:39:49,504 --> 01:39:50,766
..for our achievements.

1861
01:39:52,574 --> 01:39:54,405
I want to give you standing ovation.

1862
01:40:09,257 --> 01:40:14,524
Faltu! Faltu! Faltu!

1863
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:17,393
Fully Faltu. -Wait. Listen.

1864
01:40:17,866 --> 01:40:21,393
We're happy, but where is the exam?

1865
01:40:22,503 --> 01:40:25,336
I suggested. Oh, yes..

1866
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,340
Our examination centre.

1867
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:35,816
It says college..

1868
01:40:37,752 --> 01:40:43,520
''We've found our dreams..''

1869
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,926
Faltu, I'll tell you what I'm right now.

1870
01:40:46,194 --> 01:40:47,786
I feel proud of it. Faltu can stop.

1871
01:40:47,896 --> 01:40:50,126
We all have paid so much fees to get admission..

1872
01:40:50,231 --> 01:40:51,789
..in proper colleges and universities.

1873
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,765
And now we hear about Faltu university.

1874
01:40:53,868 --> 01:40:55,335
I think it should shut down.

1875
01:40:55,436 --> 01:40:57,370
I'm inspired by this Faltu website.

1876
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,873
I learnt dancing from Remo sir watching him on this
website.

1877
01:41:01,142 --> 01:41:02,473
So I think Faltu should continue.

1878
01:41:02,577 --> 01:41:04,636
Parents who can't educate their children..

1879
01:41:04,746 --> 01:41:06,111
..can go to this website..

1880
01:41:06,214 --> 01:41:08,444
..see the lectures put up on Faltu college..

1881
01:41:08,549 --> 01:41:10,710
..and they can very well educate themselves.

1882
01:41:11,252 --> 01:41:12,776
So I plead continue Faltu college.

1883
01:41:12,887 --> 01:41:14,514
And I go against the government.

1884
01:41:14,622 --> 01:41:16,317
Government has made big colleges.

1885
01:41:16,424 --> 01:41:18,187
Private sectors have made it. Why?

1886
01:41:18,293 --> 01:41:22,229
We've paid money for it.This is wrong and a crazy
concept.

1887
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:24,628
I saw the website of Faltu college.

1888
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:26,161
I liked it very much.

1889
01:41:26,267 --> 01:41:29,327
I think children shouldn't be stopped from such
things.

1890
01:41:29,437 --> 01:41:31,234
They took interviews of big people.

1891
01:41:31,339 --> 01:41:32,704
They shared experiences.

1892
01:41:32,807 --> 01:41:36,140
They've no college or campus. No matter their
name..

1893
01:41:36,244 --> 01:41:37,871
..but they've set example for college.

1894
01:41:38,146 --> 01:41:42,879
I feel concept is authentic. It's perfect for people like
us.

1895
01:41:43,151 --> 01:41:46,587
Stop this college. -Nobody can start college. I might
do it too.

1896
01:41:46,688 --> 01:41:49,384
Sir, investigation revealed that principal Bajirao of..

1897
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:51,822
..fake Faltu college was a teacher in your school.

1898
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:54,888
He isn't worthy to be a teacher.. -Sir, camera.

1899
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:58,358
He isn't worthy to be a teacher or a principal.

1900
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,301
You know.. you know how he teaches tables of
eight.

1901
01:42:02,603 --> 01:42:05,094
''Eight times one is Eight. My sweetheart.'

1902
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:06,434
I mean this isn't the way.

1903
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:13,410
Hello. Yes, papa.

1904
01:42:14,582 --> 01:42:16,709

''Show us the right path.''

1920
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:09,291
''World has estranged us. Please accept me.''

1921
01:44:10,198 --> 01:44:13,531
Prepare for the show. Google and I'll handle the

1923
01:44:16,904 --> 01:44:21,432
Guys, people have said a lot about us but not
anymore.

1924
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:23,870
From today Faltu should become a compliment.

1925
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:26,413
Are you guys with me? -Yes.

1926
01:44:27,148 --> 01:44:29,241

01:45:32,513 --> 01:45:34,242
Let's hear it for them.

1930
01:45:51,766 --> 01:45:54,667
Excuse me. I want to talk to you.

1931
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:57,570
You're from Faltu.

1932
01:45:58,372 --> 01:46:02,536
So, are you guys having fun? Do you want more?

1935

''Lips are locked.''

1936
01:46:45,152 --> 01:46:49,316
''Dreams are restrained.''

1937
01:46:49,423 --> 01:46:54,827
''Beckon your heart.'

1938
01:46:54,929 --> 01:46:59,298
''Strive for freedom.'

1939
01:47:00,568 --> 01:47:05,198
''Beckon your heart.'

1940
01:47:06,207 --> 01:47:11,110
''Strive for freedom.'

1941
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:07,163
''The steps taken in passion..''

1942
01:48:08,102 --> 01:48:12,698
''..can't be stopped.''

1943
01:48:13,574 --> 01:48:25,076
''The hands of faith.. is held by everyone.'

1944
01:48:29,557 --> 01:48:39,865

1945
01:48:41,502 --> 01:48:56,179
''The hands of faith.. is held by everyone.'

01:50:49,363 --> 01:50:50,887
Yes!

1951
01:50:52,366 --> 01:50:53,628
He's my son.

1952
01:51:22,162 --> 01:51:25,188
Stop it. I say stop it.

1953
01:51:29,937 --> 01:51:31,336
How dare you all get here.

1954
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:36,375
Mr.Vardhan.What's happening?

1955
01:51:36,677 --> 01:51:37,871
I'm sorry, Mr. Chakravarty.

1956
01:51:38,312 --> 01:51:39,574
They're not from any college.

1957
01:51:40,147 --> 01:51:44,174
They're students from fake Faltu college which I
closed down.

1958
01:51:44,652 --> 01:51:47,644
They entered among the top colleges by deceit..

1959
01:51:48,255 --> 01:51:53,693
..and proved how shameless and fraud they're.

1960
01:51:54,662 --> 01:51:58,689
You're right, sir.We're useless and shameless
students..

1961
01:51:58,966 --> 01:52:02,424
..for whom you were just applauding.

1962
01:52:02,736 --> 01:52:07,105
But it's not his fault. Our faces were in dark.

1963
01:52:07,374 --> 01:52:09,604
Actually you're used to keeping us in dark.

1964
01:52:11,245 --> 01:52:14,772
So when we got some light, you couldn't bear it.

1965
01:52:14,882 --> 01:52:18,511
You shut up! Don't talk nonsense with me.

1966
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:20,211
You're strange, sir!

1967
01:52:21,221 --> 01:52:23,246
We've always asked you question.

1968
01:52:23,757 --> 01:52:25,782
But today when we're finally giving you an answer..

1969
01:52:26,527 --> 01:52:28,722
..you can't bear it. -You keep out of this.

1970
01:52:29,163 --> 01:52:30,790
Do you think what you're doing is right.

1971
01:52:30,898 --> 01:52:32,889
You're supporting these useless students.

1972
01:52:34,935 --> 01:52:37,199
Sir, try to pay heed on this.

1973
01:52:38,739 --> 01:52:40,206
Children are never useless.

1974
01:52:40,908 --> 01:52:42,899
It's just that they're used less.

1975
01:52:43,177 --> 01:52:46,374
You useless can only talk nonsense.

1976
01:52:46,647 --> 01:52:48,911
But you can't proved anything. -You're right, sir.

1977
01:52:50,351 --> 01:52:52,876
We're Faltu, but of use.

1978
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,885
Let's face the fact.

1979
01:52:56,156 --> 01:52:59,125
Everyone studies to get a job.

1980
01:52:59,493 --> 01:53:01,757
Our students know enough to get a..

1981
01:53:01,862 --> 01:53:04,387
..job once they're out of college.

1982
01:53:04,632 --> 01:53:07,624
I don't think your top colleges can guarantee..

1983
01:53:07,735 --> 01:53:09,726
..hundred percent job placement.

1984
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:13,467
So please.. -I don't think I want any more nonsense
from you.

1985
01:53:14,308 --> 01:53:15,866
Security, get them out.

1986
01:53:22,282 --> 01:53:24,614
Just a minute. Stop it.

1987
01:53:26,286 --> 01:53:29,619
News channel have said a lot about you.

1988
01:53:31,558 --> 01:53:33,355
But I want to know your point of view.

1989
01:53:35,496 --> 01:53:36,485
Tell me.

1990
01:53:37,297 --> 01:53:38,457
What's your Faltu?

1991
01:53:39,633 --> 01:53:41,225
Thanks for giving us a chance, but..

1992
01:53:42,903 --> 01:53:44,632
..we didn't come to prove ourselves.

1993
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:49,839
We came to see the faces of our parents. We did
that.

1994
01:53:50,944 --> 01:53:53,310
When we left home they were in tears.

1995
01:53:53,914 --> 01:53:55,245
It's the same today.

1996
01:53:56,450 --> 01:53:59,476
The only difference is that at that time it was of
sorrow..

1997
01:53:59,586 --> 01:54:00,712
..but it's of pride now.

1998
01:54:02,756 --> 01:54:05,589
Not you, but we've to question you.

1999
01:54:06,694 --> 01:54:08,355
How is this education system?

2000
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:11,091
35% is enough for passing..

2001
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:13,564
..but 75% is required to get admission.

2002
01:54:15,469 --> 01:54:18,734
So make 70% pass grade and fail the others.

2003
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:20,604
So that rest can attempt again.

2004
01:54:22,109 --> 01:54:23,098
Where should we go?

2005
01:54:24,678 --> 01:54:28,512
The majority between 35 and 70 is called Faltu.

2006
01:54:29,516 --> 01:54:32,110
Whether you like it or not..

2007
01:54:34,321 --> 01:54:36,414
..Faltu arose because of your education system.

2008
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:38,880
Enough!

2009
01:54:40,861 --> 01:54:43,193
You've said what you wanted.

2010
01:54:44,264 --> 01:54:45,322
Can I say something?

2011
01:54:45,666 --> 01:54:46,655
Yes, sir.

2012
01:54:57,544 --> 01:54:58,909
I've a 5 years old granddaughter.

2013
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,580
She just started her school.

2014
01:55:05,219 --> 01:55:07,813
She cries every day before going to school..

2015
01:55:09,123 --> 01:55:10,249
..and asks me..

2016
01:55:11,759 --> 01:55:14,353
..why is it important to study?

2017
01:55:16,296 --> 01:55:17,820
I tried to explain her a lot.

2018
01:55:19,266 --> 01:55:22,827
But I couldn't, but today..

2019
01:55:23,504 --> 01:55:28,339
..you gave me answer to all her questions.

2020
01:55:29,676 --> 01:55:30,665
Education..

2021
01:55:32,913 --> 01:55:34,312
..isn't only books..

2022
01:55:36,416 --> 01:55:41,319
So I officially approve Faltu..

2023
01:55:41,922 --> 01:55:45,483
..as one of the most important educational..

2024
01:55:45,592 --> 01:55:48,117
..institution for next 3 years.

2025
01:55:48,796 --> 01:55:53,358
And may.. there be many more Faltu.

2026
01:56:08,448 --> 01:56:09,813
Thank you. Thank you.

2027
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:10,338
''I am oblivious.'

2028
01:57:16,884 --> 01:57:21,446
''I am oblivious.'

2029
01:57:22,623 --> 01:57:27,458
''My silence echoes here.'

2030
01:57:27,561 --> 01:57:32,760
''My dreams are yet to come true.''

2031
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:38,760
''In silence..'

2032
01:57:39,339 --> 01:57:43,673
''..my footstep is caged.''

2033
01:57:44,878 --> 01:57:49,315
''God has created this world for us.''

2034
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:53,785
''Take me along..''

2035
01:57:53,887 --> 01:57:55,548
''Under the open sky.''

2036
01:57:55,656 --> 01:57:59,251
''Take me along..''

2037
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:01,156
''In your world.''

2038
01:58:01,261 --> 01:58:05,095
''Take me along..''

2039
01:58:05,332 --> 01:58:14,707
''Take me along now..''

2040
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:24,348
With all my powers, I brace love and might.

2041
01:58:24,584 --> 01:58:27,485
To be a knight.

2042
01:58:37,731 --> 01:58:42,430
''These moments are..''

2043
01:58:42,703 --> 01:58:47,663
''..getting nostalgic.''

2044
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:58,809
''The mind is just a world of memories.'

2045
01:58:59,353 --> 01:59:07,522
''I am oblivious to this world.'

2046
01:59:07,627 --> 01:59:15,056
''Take me along..''

2047
01:59:15,369 --> 01:59:17,337
''Under the open sky..'

2048
01:59:17,437 --> 01:59:20,429
''Take me along..''

2049
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:24,772
''In your world.. -Take me along..''

2050
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:32,619
''Under the open sky..'

2051
01:59:33,887 --> 01:59:37,653
''I walk with my friends.'

2052
01:59:41,728 --> 01:59:45,664
''We are ready to roll.'

2053
01:59:45,766 --> 01:59:49,497
''Turn the speaker to shake the eardrums.''

2054
01:59:50,103 --> 01:59:53,630
''Mr. DJ, please play my song.'

2055
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:57,699
''We'll drink champagne today.'

2056
01:59:58,145 --> 02:00:01,876
''Let's dance and cruise.'

2057
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:05,812
''You have to keep it moving.''

2058
02:00:05,919 --> 02:00:09,878
''Let's party more.'

2059
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:15,753
''Let's party more.'

2060
02:00:16,463 --> 02:00:19,432
''Move it.'
