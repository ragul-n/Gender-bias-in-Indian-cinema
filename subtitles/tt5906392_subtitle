1
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,517
It is sad to get run
out when you are batting well.

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,420
It may be caused
by your own weaknesses.

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,019
...or your parent's mistake.

4
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,155
Tobacco is harmful to you.

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,601
When you smoke,
the people around you inhale it too.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,495
Be safe. Stay away from tobacco.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,139
Don't get run out.

8
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:55,479
'The mainour and the eye-witness'

9
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,700
When you were so late, I thought
you wouldn't come, Devettan.

10
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,326
How can I not come?

11
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,271
- In my life, there is no one
other than you, Sreedevi.

12
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,634
- I am ready to wait forever
for you, Devettan.

13
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:32,043
- Well.. You don't have to wait for long.
- I got a job!

14
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,179
- The Goddess has
listened to my prayers!

15
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,054
- After joining the job, I will come
to your house and ask for your hand.

16
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,125
What happened?

17
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,685
- My uncles would oppose.
- Whoever opposes,

18
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,256
Chet-m, I'm leaving.
- What happened?

19
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,529
It's not great enough to
be out in this cold for.

20
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,043
Prasad!

21
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,041
Come here!

22
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,205
Come!

23
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,304
Who is it?

24
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,043
It's 'Cherayil' Prasad.

25
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,709
Why do you have
to call him here?

26
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,584
It's okay.
He is our guy!

27
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,520
Anil!

28
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:12,989
Do you want a drink?

29
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,153
I'm not in a mood to drink.
What are you having?

30
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,652
It's brandy.
MC.

31
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,990
Then fix one drink.

32
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,388
A small one.

33
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,295
Prasad!

34
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,530
Here's your tea.

35
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,091
How drunk were you yesterday?

36
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,760
No!
I had just one drink!

37
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,014
How come you're brushing
your teeth today?

38
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,514
Get lost!

39
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,671
Chet-m (brother), I have a bad cold.

40
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,644
Is it?
Do you have fever?

41
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,237
No. Just a common cold.

42
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,388
Chet-m, do you have the strip
to check if one is pregnant?

43
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,388
Yes.

44
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,447
Ajith, get her a Velocit.

45
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,327
16 Rupees.

46
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,737
A little more.

47
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,143
Ya! That's enough!

48
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,218
Where did you go?

49
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,056
I just went to Vaikkom, Prasad.

50
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,695
Hey!

51
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,101
Isn't that our 'Sreeja'
Chettan's daughter?

52
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,429
Who?

53
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,566
Ya! That's the original Sreeja.

54
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,701
Is she married?
- No!

55
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,336
NO, man!

56
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,612
Why?

57
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,676
Get lost! Think positively, man!

58
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,528
Chet-m, money for tea.
- Okay.

59
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,308
The matter is socially relevant.

60
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,344
Yes.

61
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,240
But when we think progressively,

62
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,409
if we interfere in
this pregnancy issue;

63
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,487
Chet-m,
romance, going around, flirting;

64
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,555
we are not against any of this!

65
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,591
The girl should not
make a mistake!

66
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,722
That's all we want!

67
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,095
So you just have to
give him an indication.

68
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,054
Just an indication.

69
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,672
Come. 'Sreeja' Chet-tan will be
at the riverbank. Let's see.

70
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,167
It's not right for me to be
directly involved in this case.

71
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,235
Firstly, I'm a bachelor, right?

72
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,306
You just have to give him
a subtle indication.

73
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,704
See!
Two lines!

74
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,362
Mom, keep some money aside.

75
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,470
Is it?
- Ya!

76
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,035
Call your husband!

77
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,008
Hey! Don't announce
it to everyone.

78
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,680
Say it only after
confirming with the doctor.

79
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,038
Stop it, mom!

80
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,683
She's super-pregnant!

81
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,183
It hasn't even been 4
months since I changed it.

82
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,654
This side is completely worn out.

83
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,421
'Sreeja' Chet-m, please come.

84
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,426
What is it?
- Come. I'll tell you.

85
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,655
I'll be right back.

86
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,459
Well, what's happening?

87
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,762
Murali, I was about to..

88
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,635
What's the matter, Murali?
- Nothing special.

89
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,532
Tell me what it is.

90
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,604
Our Sreeja..

91
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,040
There's a doubt if
she's pregnant.

92
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,209
Well, I heard a news that your girl
bought a pregnancy testing machine,

93
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,515
from a medical shop in Vaikkom.

94
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,411
Pick up!

95
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,149
Hello!

96
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,183
Dad,

97
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,092
You are going to be a grandpa!

98
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,686
Hello!

99
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,596
Hello
Can't you hear me?

100
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,602
Dad, Chechi (elder sister) is pregnant!

101
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,697
Did you go to a medical shop?
- Ya.

102
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,264
Is it?
- What is it, dad?

103
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,534
Ip-

104
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,099
I am on a trip.
I'll call you later.

105
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,705
You scared me, Murali!

106
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,442
My elder daughter has come home.
She's the one who's pregnant!

107
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,677
Oops.

108
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,377
When 'Cherayil' Prasad
came & told me,

109
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,317
and since it was
Sreeja's matter;

110
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,788
just an indication.

111
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,417
'Cherayil' Prasad?
Has it become a gossip in town now?

112
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,659
No! Nothing like that!

113
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,218
He told this only to me!

114
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,390
There's no problem at all.
He's a positive young man.

115
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,424
You carry on.

116
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,554
- Where are you going?
- I'll take the ferry.

117
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,622
- What happened?
- Nothing. I'll tell you tomorrow.

118
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,692
Prasad, right?

119
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,227
Yes.

120
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,202
What have you been
gossiping about me?

121
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,175
I didn't say anything!

122
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,770
I heard that you are
really concerned about me!

123
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,018
I just shared a concern
for your own good.

124
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,045
My own good?

125
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,420
(Spits)

126
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,131
(Spits)

127
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,756
Excuse me.

128
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,038
Hey! I made a big blunder.

129
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,074
Actually, I am a gentleman.

130
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,168
If you ask around in my
area, you would know.

131
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,641
Don't you know your
father's friend Anil?

132
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,113
- You can ask him.
- Can't we talk after reaching the shore?

133
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,569
Did you call me?

134
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,607
Did you call me?

135
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,035
No.

136
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,679
You called like that, right?

137
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,309
I didn't call!

138
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,663
Tell me.

139
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,631
What?

140
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,458
Say SOFT)'-

141
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,267
Well, I wasn't going
to say sorry.

142
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,565
I am not someone who gets
involved in such gossip cases.

143
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,507
And, I haven't told everyone.

144
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,238
To 'Sreeja' Chet-tan through Murali Chet-tan.
That's all!

145
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,206
It's nothing else, Chet-m.

146
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,316
My family has been considering
alliances for me now.

147
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,718
Don't trouble us.
That's all!

148
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,579
I know that!

149
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,623
I know how difficult that is!

150
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,387
You know how long has it been?

151
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,623
I've also been looking
for a girl everywhere!

152
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,289
It's so damn difficult!

153
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,455
Shall I order a lime juice?

154
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,093
Since we've come here, have one.
It's hot, right?

155
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,137
What do you want?
- Two lime juices.

156
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,160
Sweet, right?

157
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,436
Yes. Sweet!

158
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,537
Sweet!

159
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,201
Both with ice, right?
- Yes.

160
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,736
What?

161
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,776
Nothing.

162
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,557
(Bus to Kasaragod)

163
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,088
This is not Maniyampara!

164
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,190
This is Maniyampara!

165
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,564
There was a big
banyan tree here!

166
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,091
That was long back!
Come!

167
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,694
Chechi, this is Maniyampara.
Get down!

168
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,238
What are you saying?

169
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,733
It's because you don't remember!

170
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,201
I remember!
- No!

171
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,471
There was a big
banyan tree here.

172
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,680
There was no banyan tree there!
- It was there couple of years back.

173
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,097
Oh my God! My chain!
Prasadetta!

174
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,095
He swallowed my chain!

175
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,627
Chain? What happened?
- This guy!

176
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,298
Chain?
- He broke my chain.

177
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,433
It must have fallen down.
- Did you take the chain?

178
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,737
Did you take it?
- I didn't!

179
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,634
I didn't take it! It
must have fallen down!

180
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,644
I saw him breaking & taking it.

181
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,444
Check properly.
- Check his bag.

182
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,541
Don't leave him.

183
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,279
Did you see me taking it?
- I saw!

184
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,445
Did you take it?

185
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,479
She was sleeping.
She must have dreamt about it.

186
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,387
No! I saw it. He is lying!

187
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,353
Don't mess with us!
Things will turn nasty!

188
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,360
Did it fly away then?
- How do I know?

189
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,660
She saw you taking it.

190
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,166
No. She must be mistaken!

191
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,361
Don't fool around!

192
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,494
I haven't taken it!

193
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,696
She saw you taking it.

194
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,104
Let's go to the station.
- Ya. Let's go.

195
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,707
Hold him.
Hold his hands.

196
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,333
Don't leave him.

197
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,406
We can't leave him like that.

198
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,416
Driver, take the bus
to the station.

199
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,815
To the police station.

200
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,372
Sir.

201
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,385
Sir!
- What is it?

202
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,648
Let me go, Sir.

203
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,079
Keep walking.

204
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,121
If it is to bring
water to the station,

205
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,692
I will come every
morning & fill it, Sir.

206
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,056
I'll do it in the
evening as well, Sir.

207
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,032
Haven't I reformed, Sir?

208
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,533
Don't you know, Sudhakaran?

209
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,430
You want to get drunk
and create a mess,

210
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,467
during the temple
festival, right?

211
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,072
No, Sir. I won't come
for the festival.

212
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,770
I'll stay at home, Sir.
I'll stay calm.

213
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,035
And then?

214
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,746
To break the vessels at home,

215
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,215
and beat up your mom and wife?

216
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,380
Would I do such a thing, Sir?

217
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:04,715
Sudhakaran,

218
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,452
The complaint asking us to keep you
here until the festival is over;

219
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,522
was jointly signed by
your mother & wife!

220
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,754
Don't forget that!

221
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,758
They are lying, Sir.

222
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,620
They..

223
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,065
They are feminists.

224
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,356
Sudhakaran!

225
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,564
So you won't leave me?

226
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,129
Keep walking!

227
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,007
Can you let me go watch
the 'Kolukali' tomorrow?

228
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,388
It's nothing else, sir.
There's no freedom there.

229
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,088
What freedom would you get
inside a cell, Sudhakaran?

230
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,685
So you won't leave me?

231
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,529
A bus full of
people is here, Sir.

232
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,561
Ya. We will take care of that.

233
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,091
You do your job!

234
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,666
Take the water to the station.

235
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,499
Some huge trouble has
arrived, on a KSRTC bus.

236
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,040
I'll take care of the trouble
that came on a KSRTC bus.

237
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,397
What is this?

238
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,404
A chain-snatching case.
- When?

239
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,413
Didn't you come in this bus?
Take your stuff to the station.

240
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,415
- Sudhakaran!
- I'll come tomorrow, dude!

241
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,458
Where is your home-town?

242
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,005
Thavanakkadavu. Near Alappuzha.
- Alappuzha.

243
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,000
- What are you people
doing here then?

244
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:36,405
- The situation was such that we couldn't
stay in our town after our marriage.

245
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,607
So we came here & took
a house in Kuniya.

246
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,215
What is your name?

247
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,217
Prasad.

248
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,719
And yours?
- Sreeja.

249
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,785
Do you have an ID card?
- Yes sir.

250
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:46,785
Give it.

251
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,787
So yours was a love marriage?
- Yes.

252
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,248
Inter-caste?

253
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,117
Yes sir.

254
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,258
That's why you came here
from Alappuzha, right?

255
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,491
So you eloped?

256
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,125
No sir. We got married,
told everyone & came.

257
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,360
Try to remember.

258
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,666
Did you have the chain
when you left your house?

259
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,138
Definitely, sir.

260
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,208
We were going to
mortgage the chain.

261
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,538
We had bought a place nearby
to start tobacco farming.

262
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,112
But we're not getting
water there.

263
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,478
We tried to dig a bore-well
a couple of times.

264
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,616
And when we didn't
get water even then,

265
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,147
we were really helpless.

266
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,150
So we thought we'll mortgage her
wedding chain & try once more.

267
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,255
That's when..
- Sir, this is his bag,

268
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,522
Check it properly.

269
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,523
Give me your ID.

270
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,289
I don't have any, sir.

271
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,133
You don't have?

272
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,630
You don't have any ID proof?

273
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
No.

274
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,538
So what is your name?

275
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:39,702
Prasad.

276
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:40,736
Prasad?

277
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,205
Sir, Prasad is my name.

278
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,504
My name is also Prasad.

279
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,639
That's interesting!

280
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,381
How many cases do you have?

281
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,217
None!

282
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,313
What is your actual job?

283
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,483
At a 'night' shop in Mangalore.

284
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,580
I make Pa rot-ms.

285
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:55,787
You make Pa rot-ms?

286
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,192
Let me see your hand then.

287
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,592
Show me.

288
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,029
Show me your hand.

289
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,989
Show me the other hand.

290
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,096
Shiva, did you see the
hands that make Parottas?

291
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,127
Great hands!

292
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,538
Sir, these hands don't belong
to someone who makes Parottas.

293
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,236
Those who make Parottas will have
a mark here in a round shape.

294
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,139
I haven't worked for the
past 3-4 months, sir.

295
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,408
I was at a 'night'
shop in Mangalore.

296
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,312
When the police created trouble saying
that I had no ID, they sent me away.

297
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,053
Where is your native actually?

298
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,118
Palluruthy.

299
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,454
But you don't have a
Palluruthy slang!

300
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,357
I was born in Palluruthy.
Then I was in Bombay for a long time.

301
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,027
Oh! You reached Bombay?

302
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,253
So he's international!

303
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,098
I had to earn a living, right?

304
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,194
While I was sleeping in the bus,
I woke up hearing some noise.

305
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,464
That's when they all..

306
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,529
A couple of them even hit me.
- They hit you?

307
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,195
Who hit him?

308
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,230
Huh?

309
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,400
Who hit him?

310
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,407
If the one who hit him admits,
only he will be trapped.

311
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,116
Otherwise, all of you
will be trapped.

312
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,181
Tell me!

313
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,081
Tell me properly.
Or else, none of you will leave this place.

314
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,993
So it's you?
Come!

315
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,321
Come!

316
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,629
Come closer.

317
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,524
Don't grin!

318
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,363
Why did you hit him?

319
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,300
I didn't hit him, sir.
I just waved my hand like this.

320
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,398
It didn't hit him.

321
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,000
So you are the major waver here?

322
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,568
Did you see him
stealing the chain?

323
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,042
No!
- You didn't?

324
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,404
Then why did you hit him?

325
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,047
Not just me, Sir.

326
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,409
That lthatha also hit him.

327
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,044
So he has company!

328
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,450
The lthatha who hit
him, come here.

329
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,524
Who is the lthatha who hit him?

330
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,524
Is it you?

331
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,116
Come inside!

332
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,593
Come here.

333
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,619
Come fast.

334
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,131
Looks like lthatha is
a black belt winner.

335
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,557
Did you hit him?

336
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,328
Ya. Just once.

337
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,524
Why did you hit him?

338
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,126
He snatched her chain, sir.

339
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,695
Did you see him
snatching her chain?

340
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,096
I just missed it.

341
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,733
Then both of you go
stand in that corner.

342
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,268
Stand there!

343
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,172
This is usual here.

344
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,770
Before you know anything,
you turn to violence.

345
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,713
What is the police's job then?
Huh?

346
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,343
Sir, there's nothing in this.

347
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,156
To snatch her chain,

348
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,656
were you in such dire need of money?

349
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,990
I didn't do it, sir.

350
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,223
I haven't taken it.

351
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,626
Sir, he is lying. He swallowed
it as soon as he broke it.

352
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,431
Didn't you say earlier that
you didn't see anything?

353
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,194
Then how do you know
that he swallowed it?

354
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,594
Sreeja won't lie, Sir.

355
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,298
Did any of you see it?

356
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,134
Did any of you see him
snatching the chain?

357
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,607
How will I see it, sir?

358
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,700
I was driving the bus!

359
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,608
Oh! Like that. And you?
- I didn't see.

360
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,634
You didn't see!

361
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,269
Did any of you see it?

362
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,514
No sir. None of them saw it.
- So no one saw it.

363
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,143
Sir, there's nothing in the bus.
- There's nothing in the bus.

364
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,482
Check them once more.

365
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,985
Sir, there's nothing in the bus.
And no one has seen it either.

366
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,120
But if you ask him personally"

367
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,426
maybe he would say.

368
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,190
Jijesh, the CCTV!

369
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,258
Dude, this is just
a simple matter.

370
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,028
If you say the truth, we will
give it back and settle the case.

371
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,598
Won't you say?
You didn't take it?

372
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,607
No, sir.

373
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,733
Tell me the truth!

374
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,474
Tell me the truth!
Didn't you take it?

375
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,072
I didn't take it, Sir.

376
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,272
Move away!

377
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,187
I don't know. I'll
ask them & get back.

378
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,621
Sir, they are calling from the depot
to ask if we should cancel the trip.

379
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,124
KSRTC Bus"

380
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,322
You have to come here
when you're called.

381
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,492
Get the names, addresses & phone
numbers of everyone in the bus.

382
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,225
Take that & leave them.
- Majeesh!

383
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,363
Hey!

384
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,494
Did it happen before
Kattathadukka or after that?

385
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,069
Before Kat-hath ad u kka, sir.

386
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,470
After that solar farm.

387
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,633
So that's in our limit, sir.

388
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,801
Sir, what do we do
with this waver?

389
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,073
Sir, can I leave?

390
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,512
What's your name?
- Shijo.

391
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,274
What are you doing?
- Studying.

392
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,079
Where?
- At Madhya Pradesh.

393
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,141
What are you studying?

394
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,312
I am in a seminary.

395
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,279
What the hell..

396
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,586
Take their ID Cards.

397
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,054
Give it back after 2 days.

398
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,286
You both go there.

399
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,483
Over there.

400
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,752
You both sit there.

401
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:54,786
Over there.

402
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,690
Hey!

403
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,791
Get up!

404
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,993
Get up!

405
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:03,699
Come on!

406
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,303
Stand straight!

407
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,042
Straight!

408
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,538
Stand straight, I say!

409
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:13,674
Straight!

410
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,739
Stand!

411
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:15,776
Don't sway!

412
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,212
Hold your head straight.

413
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,386
Now jUmP!

414
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,320
Jump, man!

415
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,716
Hold your head straight.

416
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,016
Don't bend.

417
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,218
Keep jumping.

418
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,462
Don't stop.
Keep jumping.

419
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,219
Have an eye on him.

420
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,113
Wait for 10 more minutes.
I'll come out now.

421
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,658
Sir, I think it's genuine.

422
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,253
She has lost the chain anyway.

423
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,089
How is he? Is he okay?
- He is fine, sir.

424
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,698
Didn't you make him jump?
- He is jumping.

425
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,200
He will be all right, sir.

426
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,327
Sir, he doesn't have
an address or ID.

427
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,502
This will be an LPC.

428
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,199
We will be in a lot of trouble.

429
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,199
- I think we should somehow
compromise this case.

430
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,641
We can't do that, sir.

431
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,507
It is a lady's complaint.

432
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,602
At a public place,

433
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,671
and so many people
know about it.

434
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,241
We cannot avoid
charging the case.

435
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,417
We will be in a fix then.

436
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,144
Sir, well..

437
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,253
We can't take him to Kumbala now.
It's late.

438
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,553
If we have to do a medical test,
we have to take him to Kasaragod.

439
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,220
My wife has been waiting for quite
some time, to go for the festival.

440
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,455
That's not needed, sir.

441
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,054
We just have to feed him
some bananas in the night.

442
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,665
If he has swallowed it, the stuff
would come out in the morning.

443
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,225
And then we can think
how to proceed.

444
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,429
Then do one thing.

445
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,166
Get the statements from the
complainants and leave them.

446
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,472
Okay.

447
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,338
Hey! They shouldn't
feel doubtful, okay?

448
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,434
No sir.

449
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,773
I'll do it accordingly.

450
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,740
Sir, if that's the case;

451
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:55,048
if we ask the husband of the complainant
to stay here during the night;

452
00:32:55,073 --> 00:33:00,216
there won't be any allegation against
the police regarding the stolen item.

453
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,223
Do that.

454
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,022
And ya, in the cell..
Toilet..

455
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,359
We can't put him in the cell.
There's a toilet in there.

456
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,762
Then do it accordingly, okay?

457
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,296
Okay sir.

458
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,605
Hey! Come here!

459
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,300
Both of you!

460
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,418
Stand here.

461
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,617
Sir, these are the boys we
caught on the bike earlier.

462
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,181
Move this side.

463
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:41,786
Shall we ask him?

464
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,260
Tell me your names.

465
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,525
Salman.

466
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,227
Salman Khan?

467
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,328
Salman!

468
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,696
Dad's name?

469
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,064
Abdullah.

470
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,633
Age?

471
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,369
Around 52.

472
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,640
Tell me your age!

473
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,372
I am 21.

474
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,209
Sir.

475
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,146
Wait there, Prasad.
I'll call you.

476
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,482
Where is your house?

477
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,583
Close by.
Sheni.

478
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:12,757
Sheni?

479
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,018
Urumi House.

480
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,023
What?
- Urumi House.

481
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,088
Sir,

482
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,397
what do we do next?

483
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,065
It's a complicated problem, Prasad.

484
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,697
So, S.l. sir is saying that;

485
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,033
we can't charge such a case.

486
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,237
Because nobody has
seen it, right?

487
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,247
No one in the bus saw him
snatching the chain.

488
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,611
Only this girl has seen it.

489
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,745
Right?

490
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,542
And he is not at all
admitting to it.

491
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,520
Then how do we charge a case?

492
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,312
Without any evidence
or eye-witness;

493
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,290
if we put someone behind
bars charging a case;

494
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,519
that will be a huge problem.

495
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,218
All of us might lose our jobs.

496
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,255
I swear on my mother.
I saw it, sir.

497
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,594
Dear..

498
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,400
What you saw;

499
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,636
what happened in the bus;

500
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,237
exactly like how it happened;

501
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,404
without any exaggeration;

502
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,175
say it exactly like
how it happened.

503
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,282
Sir, I was sitting in the bus.
- In the bus?

504
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,984
You were sitting & sleeping, right?
- Yes.

505
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,143
You were sleeping in the bus.
- Yes.

506
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,188
And?

507
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,656
And suddenly I felt like someone
was pulling my chain and l..

508
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,714
Yes.

509
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,994
You felt like someone
was pulling your chain.

510
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,157
It was a feeling.
And then? Tell me.

511
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,223
When I turned back, he put the
chain in his mouth & swallowed it.

512
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,389
H ow?

513
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,525
He put it in his mouth.

514
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,697
Like this? He was holding
it tight in his hand.

515
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,262
And he put it in
his mouth, right?

516
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,041
In this.. Let me ask you..

517
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,077
Imagine that there's
something in my hand;

518
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,544
Prasad, understand
what I'm asking.

519
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,582
This thing, when you turned
back, I put it in my mouth.

520
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,774
But how will you realize that
it was your chain in my hand?

521
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,585
Did you see that the chain with
your design was in his hand?

522
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,078
NO, right?

523
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,386
When you turned back, he put
something into his mouth.

524
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,726
Isn't that the truth?

525
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,422
What if he was eating peanuts?
- That can also be true, right?

526
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,692
You didn't see him
breaking the chain.

527
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,193
You haven't seen that it was
your chain in his hand.

528
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,498
Then how can we charge
a case against him?

529
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,267
He hasn't confessed and we
couldn't find the item from him.

530
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,136
You have a doubt. Just
because you suspect him,

531
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,577
without any eye-witness or any evidence;
we can't put him behind bars.

532
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,205
We might lose our jobs.

533
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,248
And,

534
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,113
if we put someone in the cell now,

535
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,346
how much does the Government
give for the expenses?

536
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,751
16 Rupees.

537
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,546
That too, just on paper.

538
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,719
Do you understand what
we're saying, Prasad?

539
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,558
Sir, we don't have
any other option.

540
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,660
Sir, this is a complicated case.

541
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,697
We are sure that
your chain is gone.

542
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,363
That's true.

543
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,306
But right now, we don't have any
evidence to prove that he took it.

544
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,737
In case, if it is him
who has swallowed it;

545
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,203
you will get the chain.

546
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,678
That's for sure.
- We'll get it for you.

547
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,043
That's enough, sir.

548
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,411
He was the one who snatched my chain.
I'm sure.

549
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,278
If so, we'll do one thing sir.

550
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,783
We'll make him sit here today.

551
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,790
Then let them also stay here.

552
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,082
I will stay, sir.

553
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,149
Ya. That's enough.

554
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,218
If something is needed
during the night;

555
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,730
If he buys good food for this
guy during the night;

556
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,593
the stuff will come out in the
morning, if he has swallowed it.

557
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,634
Yes.

558
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,999
We'll do that, Prasad.

559
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,129
You do one thing.

560
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,230
If you step out, there's
a shop called AA Stores.

561
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,235
If you tell them that you
were sent from the station;

562
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,038
and you need things
for the complaint;

563
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,079
they will give it. They
know what all are needed.

564
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,146
It's very close.

565
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,442
Okay.
- Carry on.

566
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,345
Tell me your phone number.
- I'll go.

567
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,022
Say it loudly!

568
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,558
Jijesh! Give your ID cards
over there & leave.

569
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,563
I have to go to Dubai next week, sir.
Please.

570
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,064
That's okay.
Come after 2 days.

571
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,560
Chandran sir, there's no tea today?

572
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,131
It's not that bad here.

573
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,708
You will have to bring some water.

574
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,505
You won't have any
other problem here.

575
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,075
Your stole her chain
and his name, right?

576
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,208
Get lost!

577
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,631
Please Chechi. Don't look at me
like you're looking at a thief!

578
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,226
Look into my eyes and say that
you didn't snatch my chain!

579
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,705
You saw a dream while sleeping.

580
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,168
I haven't taken it.

581
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,042
I saw you snatching it!

582
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,168
Thief!
- HEY!

583
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,046
Go and sit there!

584
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,544
Go and sit there, girl!

585
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,646
Majeesh,
- Sir!

586
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,019
Take him upstairs.

587
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,314
Come here!

588
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,384
Come!

589
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,763
Chet-m, I've come
from the station.

590
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,635
I needed some papers.

591
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,340
The KSRTC chain-snatching case?
- Yes.

592
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,671
He gobbled up the chain, right?

593
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,182
He gobbled up the chain, right?

594
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,452
The chain.. He swallowed it, right?
- Yes.

595
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,609
Who's the GD?

596
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,087
The policeman who's
investigating your case.

597
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,355
When you enter the station, who
is sitting in the farthest end?

598
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,121
With a bald head..

599
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,324
Wearing glasses.

600
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,225
With his moustache
like a brush, right?

601
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,267
Yes.

602
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:20,301
It's Chandran sir.

603
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,235
If it's Chandran sir, the
file would be thick!

604
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,704
Hey! It's Chandran sir.

605
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,437
He is from Thiruvananthapuram.

606
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,544
When he was working
at a station there,

607
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,047
the SI broke the hand or
leg of some convict there;

608
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,743
he was the GD then.

609
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,617
And he got a
punishment transfer.

610
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,448
He is quite violent.

611
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,986
Some time back, his son
died in a bike accident.

612
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,686
After that, he has sobered down.

613
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,455
Don't worry.
He is a good man.

614
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,094
How much?

615
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,221
RS.235

616
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,622
I'm reading the statement.

617
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,160
Today, on 21 .02.2017,

618
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,458
at 16.30;

619
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:31,132
To A.S.l. KR Chandran who was on GD
charge at Sheni police station;

620
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:37,411
from Sreeja U, wife of Prasad, 26 years;
who stays in Kuniya at Kasaragod,

621
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,640
Ashraf Complex,

622
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,373
Perla amsham,
Kuniya desham;

623
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,783
the following is the statement she
recorded by appearing at the station.

624
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,749
I have been staying at the
above-mentioned place

625
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,452
along with my husband Prasad
for the past 6 months.

626
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,090
We hail from Alappuzha.

627
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,821
Currently staying in the
above-mentioned address.

628
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,828
Prasad, my husband is a farmer.

629
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:04,532
Today at 15.00, while I was going with
my husband to Kasaragod on a KSRTC bus;

630
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,005
when we reached a place
called Kattathadukka,

631
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,442
suddenly my wedding chain which
was on my neck went missing;

632
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,237
and when I turned back,

633
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:17,110
I saw the person sitting on the seat
behind me swallowing something.

634
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,349
After that, my husband Prasad
& others created a ruckus;

635
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,289
and brought him to the police
station on the same bus.

636
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,356
I have a strong
suspicion on him.

637
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,064
My wedding chain is
around 2 sovereigns.

638
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,599
I have a complaint that
my chain has been stolen.

639
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,296
So I request you
to do the needful.

640
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,796
You heard the statement.
- Okay.

641
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,182
Chet-m, do you have Biriyani here?
- Yes.

642
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,088
2 Chicken Biriyanis, parcel.
- Two?

643
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,084
Yes. And one kilo of bananas.

644
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,430
Shall we also have
some Biriyani?

645
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,036
Anyway we're spending so much; you
needn't cook after going home.

646
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,731
Aren't you hungry?
- Yes.

647
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,068
Then come.

648
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,278
Chet-m, 2 more Chicken Biriyanis.

649
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,628
How much?
- 320.

650
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,398
I don't have change.

651
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,270
It's okay, dude. Give it.
He will be here only. He will give it.

652
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,772
It was our wedding
chain, Sreeja.

653
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,675
You should have
been more careful.

654
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,510
- Did you get all the stuff, Chechi?
- I didn't buy anything, Usha.

655
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,516
- It's quite difficult because
we're short of money.

656
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,676
Even I don't have money. I
couldn't buy everything.

657
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,549
Chechi, aren't you going
for the procession?

658
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,384
Huh? Why should I go
for the procession?

659
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,082
Ya! Sreeja should
be going instead!

660
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,634
Hey! Get me some water.

661
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,262
Wait! Let this get done.

662
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,595
Please, dear.

663
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,454
You wretch!

664
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,582
What do you think you're doing?

665
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,152
I will kill you today!
- Leave me!

666
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,190
I Will..
Stop there, you!

667
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,457
Why are you hitting me, mom?

668
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,730
Come here!

669
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,323
- Leave me!
- Who is that Prasad?

670
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,526
Who is he to you?

671
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,694
What do you have to do with
fellow from another caste?

672
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,160
Tell me!

673
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,106
You were born to disgrace us!
Wretch!

674
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,335
I will kill you!

675
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,638
If you don't live properly,
I'll teach you a lesson!

676
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,008
Hey! Open the door!

677
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,375
If you don't open the door, I'll
throw boiling water on you!

678
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,610
Go boil it & come!

679
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,679
Damn you!
Open the door!

680
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,147
We unknowingly got into a
physical relationship.

681
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,450
Now you can't separate us!

682
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:20,718
My God!

683
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,453
MY fate!

684
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,290
I just want to die!

685
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,437
<i>“Om!</i>

686
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,082
She is fooling us.

687
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,618
She is lying!
Bloody liar!

688
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,399
Sreekutty,

689
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:09,740
Open the door.

690
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,558
Sreeja.
We have reached.

691
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,090
Let's go there.

692
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,702
What should be done now?

693
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,274
You tell me, Sreeja.

694
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,572
What do I say?

695
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,453
Aren't you getting
beaten at home?

696
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,676
Yes, chetta.

697
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:57,023
Beating, death-threats,
suicide-threats, taunts;

698
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,081
there's everything!

699
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,489
What is this on your ear?

700
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,618
What happened?

701
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,689
I got slapped hard on my ear.

702
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:09,001
I saw the stars
when I got slapped.

703
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,465
That's enough, Sreeja.

704
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,564
Come with me.

705
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,469
I won't let you die.

706
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,240
I will tie a wedding chain
on your neck at some temple.

707
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,337
That's all I need!

708
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,381
Don't think about anything else.

709
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,747
Get your bag and come fast.

710
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,611
There's a set-up that
I know in Kanhangad.

711
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,553
All the arrangements for
the wedding are ready.

712
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,022
Let's take the rest as it comes!

713
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,025
Why should we be scared to
live in Thavanakkadavu?

714
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,151
It's not like that.

715
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,129
Consider her state of mind as well.
- I can't!

716
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,354
Sreeja,

717
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:39,990
Sreeja,

718
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,036
Without the girl
showing courage,

719
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,264
no love marriage has ever
happened in this world.

720
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,329
Realize that!

721
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,251
Kanchana,

722
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,393
Prasad has done it!

723
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,329
Okay.

724
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,729
Come.

725
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,041
What all is going to happen now?

726
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,977
Oh my dear Lord!

727
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,087
At what time do you
have dinner usually?

728
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,216
Around 8-8550.

729
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,282
8-830?

730
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,163
We have dinner at 9-9550.

731
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,461
Just tell me when you're hungry.

732
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,330
Oh! She won't be hungry tonight.

733
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,637
Anyway, I liked Sreeja.

734
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,467
Prasad too!

735
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:00,947
Okay.

736
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,613
Chet-m, Murali Chet-tan said he'll be
there early with the bouquet & garland.

737
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,384
You want a drink?
- No.

738
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,515
Just have one.
- No, thanks.

739
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,152
Anyone else in particular?

740
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,723
Isn't Sreeja here?

741
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,056
She is inside.

742
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,301
I went wrong when I hit her.

743
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,331
You took advantage of that.

744
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,368
What you did was unwarranted.

745
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,566
Understood?

746
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,276
He doesn't know how the
'Mangalath' family used to live.

747
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,348
Shaji,

748
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,508
don't you know it?

749
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:38,075
If our dad was alive, he wouldn't let this happen.
- Exactly!

750
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:39,983
Keep quiet, brother.

751
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,655
Prasad,

752
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,589
I don't have anything to tell you!

753
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,992
That girl who came with you,

754
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,656
without giving even a dog's worth
to the parents who raised her;

755
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:50,988
Tell her!

756
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,360
That both of us won't live together
in this Thavanakkadavu anymore.

757
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,301
I don't want a disgraceful life!

758
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,295
Understood?

759
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,006
You understood, right?

760
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,439
You stay close to Vaikkom, right?

761
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,774
Yes.

762
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,276
I have come there for the
'Ashtami' (temple festival).

763
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,105
Is it?

764
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:35,645
Why?

765
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,613
I'll go drink some water & come.

766
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,738
Sir!
sir!

767
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:31,568
I want to pee.

768
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,306
Aren't you sleeping?

769
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,361
Go there & pee.

770
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,576
Sir, I also want to pee.

771
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,613
Do whatever you want.
Why are you asking me?

772
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,305
Can you catch me if I run now?

773
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,176
Hey! What's happening there?

774
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,526
Prasad got scared, sir.

775
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,256
If you mess around, I'll break your bones!
Get inside!

776
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,399
You're doing comedy at midnight?

777
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,622
Hey!

778
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,426
If you have taken the chain,
say it now.

779
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,601
The policemen here are kings of ego!
You know that?

780
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,526
If we find the chain from you,

781
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,104
all of them will take
turns to smash you up.

782
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,705
Where is the other Prasad?

783
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,544
He has gone to buy tea, sir.

784
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:25,985
Sir, when will the school bell ring?

785
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,214
Don't you know?

786
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,684
Haven't you been to school?

787
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:35,087
Sir, shall we go?

788
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,326
Chandran Sir!
- Yes!

789
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,166
Prasad, keep it there and come.

790
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,569
Get a bottle of water as well.
- Yes sir.

791
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,240
Mani!
- Yes sir.

792
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,313
- Chechi, Namaste!
- Namaste!

793
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,377
Chandran Sir,
that's a bumper!

794
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:04,015
We need a treat for this.
- Come up there. I'll give you!

795
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,004
I heard you did some
comedy last night?

796
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,709
You think you're too funny?

797
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,143
Walk fast!

798
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,709
Don't try to show off!

799
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,752
You'll get thulped royally!

800
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,101
Go sit somewhere over there.

801
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,195
Give it.

802
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,430
Here you go.

803
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,075
You hit me, right?

804
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,570
I lost the mood.

805
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,459
Everything is going well, right?
- Yes.

806
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,749
We didn't get the chain, Sreeja.

807
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:21,547
What do we do now?

808
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,749
You're really sure, right?

809
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,497
Sir, well..

810
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,475
Seeing his confidence;

811
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,046
I don't think he has
taken the chain.

812
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,048
He has that much
confidence while talking.

813
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,412
But where did it go then?

814
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,518
That's because he's
an expert thief, sir.

815
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,688
Moreover; maybe if he threw the chain
out of the bus after he took it;

816
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,782
and when the girl looked, he
must have made such a gesture.

817
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,617
Didn't you check the whole place?

818
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,220
Well, sir.. In her statement, she has said
that she has seen him swallowing the chain.

819
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,195
And they don't know
the exact place too.

820
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,698
How do we search there?

821
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,997
Well, we have kept him
here for one whole day.

822
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,503
We haven't got the stuff too.

823
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,771
The C.l. is calling.

824
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,400
Sir, don't let C.l. sir
know about it now.

825
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,035
We'll do one thing..
- He's going on calling.

826
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,045
Sir..
Good morning.

827
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,138
It's Sajan.
- Good morning.

828
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,342
You haven't registered
that chain case?

829
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,782
Sir... I forgot about it, sir.

830
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,542
I had called you.
I didn't get through.

831
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,485
- That's your usual excuse.
Not getting through.

832
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,318
It's a case where the
accused is in custody.

833
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,449
Register it quickly! Don't
create trouble for me!

834
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,690
Did C.l. sir know it?

835
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,098
We should have done it yesterday itself.
He came to know.

836
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,693
There are the people from SB.
He will know things immediately.

837
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:44,302
Yesterday itself"

838
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,532
- Sir!
- Call the GD!

839
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,506
Who is the GD today?
- Today it's Rahim Sir.

840
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,065
Call him here.
- Yes sir.

841
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,245
Sir.

842
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,746
You know what happened
yesterday, right?

843
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,476
The case of the bus, right?
- Yes.

844
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,276
There's no point in
delaying it anymore.

845
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,277
You should take him
for a medical test.

846
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,616
Take him to Dr. Shanavaz.

847
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,748
- Take this guy along.
- You do it, okay?

848
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:04,650
Okay sir.

849
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,591
Sir, why don't you call the doctor?

850
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,126
Sir, should I come?
- No.

851
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,230
Prasad,

852
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,472
in this situation, I think
the case will get cancelled.

853
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,273
What do we do now?

854
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:30,673
He's a solid fraud!

855
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,415
He has hidden the chain somewhere.

856
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,756
We found that through
an investigation we did.

857
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:37,751
Phew!

858
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,515
What to do?

859
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,457
I'll tell you something
that I can do.

860
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,424
We'll take an X-Ray of his.

861
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,262
I will request S.l. Sir.

862
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,490
Fine?

863
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,660
Is that fine?
- Thank you sir.

864
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,727
Welcome!

865
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,063
Don't move.

866
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,271
Here's your bill.

867
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,019
Chet-m!

868
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,490
Prasad!

869
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,059
Come!

870
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,633
I'll call you back.
Okay.

871
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,553
Didn't you swallow the chain?

872
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,681
No sir.

873
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,694
Then what is this?

874
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,332
Tell me.
What is this?

875
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,201
Didn't you hear the doctor?
Tell him!

876
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,005
You swallowed the
chain, didn't you?

877
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,770
Did you swallow the chain?

878
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,042
Sir, just a minute.

879
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:46,443
I want to talk to you.

880
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,017
Was there any violence?

881
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:53,416
No violence, sir.

882
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:55,113
Just a small tussle.

883
01:06:55,276 --> 01:06:56,550
It's really silly.

884
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:58,557
They quarrelled and made it big.

885
01:06:58,613 --> 01:07:00,115
Both of them are my votes.

886
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:01,353
Come in.

887
01:07:06,187 --> 01:07:07,461
How is Abucha doing?

888
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:09,134
He is fine, sir.
- Sit down.

889
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,528
Who was the one who hit?
- Sir, he hit me.

890
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:14,596
You sit down.

891
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:17,234
What was the problem?

892
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:19,169
I've told everything to Faisal, sir.

893
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:21,272
This is my complaint.
You should take action.

894
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:22,337
I will.

895
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:24,647
What is the complaint?
Let me hear it.

896
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:26,481
He hit me in front of
the temple yesterday.

897
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:28,745
Did you hit him?
- No, sir. I didn't.

898
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,011
Then?

899
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:32,418
When he was going
on swearing at me,

900
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,754
in the heat of the moment;

901
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,221
I just pushed him slightly.

902
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:37,729
He's lying, sir. He pushed me to
the ground in front of everyone.

903
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:40,626
In the heat of the moment, will
you push people to the ground?

904
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:41,723
No, sir.

905
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:43,292
What's your job?

906
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:44,662
Sir, I am a poet.

907
01:07:45,427 --> 01:07:46,462
Rajesh Ambalathara.

908
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:47,734
You might have heard my name.

909
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:48,997
No.

910
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:50,503
Sir, I'm really talented.

911
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:51,509
Leave all that.

912
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:52,541
Tell me what happened.

913
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,409
Sir, what actually
happened was that;

914
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:57,643
these mobile company people said that
they would install a tower in my house.

915
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:00,149
I would get a good sum
for a year, right?

916
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,380
I agreed to that.

917
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:04,549
Even my wife agreed. It will be
an extra income for us, right?

918
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:06,548
And whatever I do,

919
01:08:06,614 --> 01:08:09,424
I don't do it without asking
Madhavan Master & Krishnettan.

920
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:12,028
So when I asked Madhavan
Master, he said;

921
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:13,291
Son, don't do it.

922
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:15,197
It will be a huge danger for our town;

923
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:17,736
These squirrels & butterflies and all
are dying, right? They are extinct!

924
01:08:17,992 --> 01:08:19,699
All of them die because
of the radiation.

925
01:08:19,961 --> 01:08:22,601
I said that I don't need anything
that is bad for our town.

926
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:24,143
What radiation, sir?

927
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:25,439
He is using a mobile,

928
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,275
lam using a mobile;
you are also using it.

929
01:08:27,335 --> 01:08:29,508
And are we all shivering in fever now?
- Babu sir,

930
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:30,549
calm down.

931
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:31,675
Let me listen to him.

932
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:32,717
I'll solve it.

933
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:33,748
Tell me.

934
01:08:34,008 --> 01:08:36,545
So I told the mobile company that
they can't do this in my house,

935
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:38,557
and asked them to take it all off.
They took it all away.

936
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:39,591
My dear sir,

937
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:43,561
after a week, this mobile company's tower
was being built in this Sir's house.

938
01:08:43,618 --> 01:08:45,188
In the house right next to mine!

939
01:08:45,253 --> 01:08:46,994
And sir, I want to say
something else too.

940
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:50,195
I will decide whether to keep a tower
or a flag-post in my property!

941
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,067
I don't need his
permission for that.

942
01:08:52,293 --> 01:08:53,704
Babu sir, calm down.
We'll solve it.

943
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:55,331
That's not the only problem, sir.

944
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:58,343
He has given his own house on rent &
he's staying in his wife's house.

945
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:00,202
So he gets all the rent,

946
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:02,270
and me and my family will
get all the radiation!

947
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:03,407
I'm worried, sir.

948
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:05,144
I can give my house on
rent or lock it up!

949
01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:07,447
I can even go stay at the snake
park in Parasshinikkadavu.

950
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,149
I didn't come to your wife's house, right?
- Sir, this is how he speaks.

951
01:09:10,211 --> 01:09:13,055
Babu sir, we will find a
solution for everything.

952
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,154
Sir, I'm not ready
for any compromise.

953
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,060
I have given you a complaint.
If you can take action, do it.

954
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:21,359
Or else, I'll come with a lawyer.
I'll take him to court. I'll lock him.

955
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:22,457
Babu sir!

956
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,664
Is that so?

957
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:26,205
Sir..
- Sir, we have brought him.

958
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:27,262
Just a minute.

959
01:09:27,962 --> 01:09:29,202
I'll be right back.
- Okay sir.

960
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,673
Babu sir, please calm down.

961
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,735
Faisal, I'm not ready
for any compromise.

962
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,641
My dear Prasad,

963
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:42,154
what do you have to say now?

964
01:09:43,344 --> 01:09:44,379
It just happened.

965
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:46,424
It just happened, sir.
- Just happened?

966
01:09:47,215 --> 01:09:48,159
You took it;

967
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:49,217
swallowed it;

968
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,398
He has confessed.

969
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:54,465
Take him inside.

970
01:09:54,656 --> 01:09:55,532
GO, man!

971
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:58,537
Sir, don't hit me.
- Sarala, the CCTV!

972
01:09:58,593 --> 01:09:59,731
No, man. You get in.

973
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:02,406
Sir, don't hit me, please.
I made a mistake. I won't repeat it.

974
01:10:02,463 --> 01:10:04,602
Don't hit me, sir.
I won't repeat it.

975
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:06,339
Sir, don't hit me, please.

976
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:08,210
Go inside.
- Please don't hit me.

977
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:10,271
Sudhakaran, don't you
want to see 'Kolukali'?

978
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:12,207
Not right now, sir.

979
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,942
Go! Go see it and come back.
Okay?

980
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:16,215
Sudhakaran, go and come back here itself.
Okay?

981
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:18,154
Sir, please don't hit me.

982
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:21,554
What did you say yesterday?

983
01:10:21,616 --> 01:10:24,324
Don't hit me, please. I made a mistake.
- That you didn't take it?

984
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:26,023
You said that you
didn't take it, right?

985
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:28,089
Sir, don't hit on my stomach.
The chain is in there.

986
01:10:28,156 --> 01:10:29,533
The chain is in my stomach, sir.

987
01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:31,002
You can't say the truth, huh?

988
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:32,595
Where were you in Bombay?

989
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,037
I haven never seen Bombay.

990
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:36,473
You haven't seen it?
You haven't? No?

991
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,170
Sir, don't hit on his stomach.

992
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,737
The chain is in his stomach.
- No sir.

993
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:44,742
Enough sir.
- I'll show you what I can do.

994
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:46,417
He has been fooling us.

995
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:47,475
Lie there!

996
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,288
Remember,

997
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,450
I will put you in a deadlock
that you can never get out of!

998
01:10:52,513 --> 01:10:54,390
You haven't understood
how the police works!

999
01:11:02,724 --> 01:11:03,725
Sir.

1000
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:04,993
Call Shivan.

1001
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,705
So,

1002
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:08,104
what do you want, Babu sir?

1003
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:09,038
Sir..

1004
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:10,371
I am ready for a compromise.

1005
01:11:10,698 --> 01:11:14,544
But he hit me in front of all the
people in front of the temple, sir.

1006
01:11:14,602 --> 01:11:16,013
I couldn't bear that, sir.

1007
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,414
He should apologize to me
in front of the temple.

1008
01:11:18,673 --> 01:11:19,947
Are you ready to apologize?

1009
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:21,612
Sir, why should I apologize?
- Shiva,

1010
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:23,656
379 won't be enough for the case.

1011
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:25,315
Register it as a robbery case.

1012
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,356
We'll charge it as 398, sir.
He fooled the police a lot, right?

1013
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,191
We should get a
different statement.

1014
01:11:30,385 --> 01:11:33,127
And as a witness, we
have Sreeja's husband.

1015
01:11:33,187 --> 01:11:34,222
That's not enough.

1016
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:38,169
Apart from that, we have the addresses
of the guy who hit him and that lthatha.

1017
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:39,728
We have their ID cards as well.
- Very good.

1018
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:41,337
We'll add them too.

1019
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:44,309
And if his arrest
is recorded today,

1020
01:11:44,732 --> 01:11:46,370
it will be a credit for us.

1021
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:48,374
Get a precise statement.

1022
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:50,006
I don't mind whatever you do.

1023
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:51,243
He has to be in a deadlock!

1024
01:11:51,306 --> 01:11:52,979
In a way that he
would never get out.

1025
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:54,382
Got it?
- Okay sir.

1026
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,048
So, what do you want, Babu sir?

1027
01:11:59,414 --> 01:12:01,485
Sir, he hit me in
front of the public.

1028
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:04,425
At least, I am older than him.
He should understand that.

1029
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:06,760
He should realize his mistake.

1030
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:09,192
He must apologize.
It's okay even if he does that here.

1031
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,460
I will forgive him.

1032
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:12,596
Babu sir, sorry!
I made a mistake.

1033
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:14,128
I made a mistake.

1034
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:15,599
He said it!

1035
01:12:17,098 --> 01:12:19,009
So what should I do with the complaint?
- Give it to me, sir.

1036
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,076
Keep this.

1037
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:21,542
Okay?
- Thank you sir.

1038
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:26,311
Shall we go?
- Let's go.

1039
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:30,250
I have compromised just
because Sir said so. Okay?

1040
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,524
Babudas, make him sit there.
- Okay sir.

1041
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,051
Stop it.

1042
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,259
What was the need for all this?

1043
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,594
Why didn't you confess earlier?

1044
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:42,566
I won't give up till
the last minute, sir.

1045
01:12:43,257 --> 01:12:44,497
That's my style.
- Walk!

1046
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,432
Sit there.

1047
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:01,149
Prasad,

1048
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:03,447
it's good that we made the S.l.
allow us to take an X-Ray.

1049
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:04,990
You have God's grace on you.

1050
01:13:05,046 --> 01:13:08,118
Since the chain is in his stomach, we are safe.
- Chandran Sir, just a second.

1051
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:10,027
Wait.

1052
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:20,401
Sir..
- What is it?

1053
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:23,200
Sir, a fight will happen there right now!
- Huh?

1054
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:31,445
Oh! It's Sudhakaran & team?

1055
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:35,115
Sir, there's a fight happening on the
temple ground. Send someone who's on duty.

1056
01:13:35,176 --> 01:13:37,452
Duty! Duty! Hey Ashok!
- Who all are upstairs? Come fast!

1057
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:38,955
Who all are upstairs?

1058
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,490
L&O.

1059
01:13:40,581 --> 01:13:42,561
Okay. We're coming!

1060
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:45,123
Sir, we don't have
to think so much.

1061
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:47,324
We cannot deal it personally.

1062
01:13:47,388 --> 01:13:49,595
But.. I know it is difficult..
Still..

1063
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:51,536
It's a theft case, right?

1064
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,336
Let the S.l. have a
robbery case in his name.

1065
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:58,367
Moreover, when it appears on
newspapers; the S.l. can shine, right?

1066
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,280
It's an opportunity for
you to shine as well.

1067
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:07,245
Did you take the 'Lathi'?
- Go fast.

1068
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:09,086
What about the witnesses?

1069
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,152
That's okay. There are
four people, right?

1070
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:14,193
There's that waver and that lthatha.

1071
01:14:14,382 --> 01:14:17,124
And the conductor &
driver of that KSRTC bus.

1072
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:22,634
I'm telling you because you aren't
familiar with courts & police stations.

1073
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:25,368
If you go to court, it will
take 1.5 years to get your chain.

1074
01:14:25,526 --> 01:14:27,972
If you give me 5000 Rupees,
we'll arrive at a compromise.

1075
01:14:28,396 --> 01:14:29,602
5000 Rupees?

1076
01:14:30,398 --> 01:14:31,672
I got beaten up so badly, right?

1077
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:33,412
I should be paid at least
for the work I did, right?

1078
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:35,709
It will be beneficial for you as well.
You want to dig that well, right?

1079
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,678
Even if I don't get the chain, I'll
make sure that you are sent to jail!

1080
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,941
Bloody thief!

1081
01:14:43,644 --> 01:14:44,645
Chet-m,

1082
01:14:45,146 --> 01:14:46,386
how do you tolerate her?

1083
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:47,449
Get lost!

1084
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:49,324
Didn't we make you sit there?
Go sit there.

1085
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:56,393
If we go for a case, we
won't get the chain soon.

1086
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,458
So?

1087
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:19,213
Well,

1088
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,554
the chain is in his stomach.

1089
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:22,083
He has swallowed it.

1090
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:25,255
That swallowed chain, you
know that it's yours, Sreeja.

1091
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:26,992
Now the police know it too.

1092
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:29,500
So we have to prove
this to the court.

1093
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,565
That means, if he says
in the court that,

1094
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,563
he swallowed his wife's
chain unknowingly;

1095
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:39,308
If he says that and presents
a fake bill at the court,

1096
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,368
you will be in trouble.

1097
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:41,702
Right?

1098
01:15:42,236 --> 01:15:42,976
Won't you?

1099
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,071
Right, sir?

1100
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:47,014
We have to gather strong
evidence against him,

1101
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:50,051
and register a robbery case
against him & lock him!

1102
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:53,055
When will we get
the chain in hand?

1103
01:15:53,114 --> 01:15:56,323
That is, how strong our
case and evidence are;

1104
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:58,193
you'll get the chain
that much quicker.

1105
01:15:58,586 --> 01:15:59,621
<i>Go! “'2?</i>

1106
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:02,998
For that, we need another
detailed statement from Sreeja.

1107
01:16:03,124 --> 01:16:06,128
Nothing else. Just some minor changes
in what you said yesterday. That's all.

1108
01:16:06,193 --> 01:16:08,400
Minor changes.
- So you do one thing, dear.

1109
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:11,006
Recollect the incident
precisely once more.

1110
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:13,034
Say it.

1111
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:15,108
We were going to Kasaragod.

1112
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,376
You were going on the
bus to Kasaragod.

1113
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:20,213
I was sleeping in the bus.

1114
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:24,012
You couldn't have been in
a deep sleep in the bus.

1115
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:25,318
You can't be dead asleep.

1116
01:16:25,379 --> 01:16:26,722
You dozed off lightly
in the breeze.

1117
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:29,018
So you were sitting in the bus.
And?

1118
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:31,492
Suddenly I felt someone
pulling my chain backwards.

1119
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:33,031
Someone pulled it.
- Yes.

1120
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:35,697
You felt it because he pulled it, right?
Didn't he pull it?

1121
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,167
And then?

1122
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,231
And when I turned back,
he swallowed my chain.

1123
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:41,266
You saw it.

1124
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:43,002
You saw him
swallowing the chain.

1125
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:44,540
While you were
travelling on the bus,

1126
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:46,237
someone pulled your
chain backwards,

1127
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,472
and when you turned back,

1128
01:16:47,535 --> 01:16:50,243
you saw the person sitting
behind you swallowing the chain.

1129
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:52,247
So Prasad would have
also seen it, right?

1130
01:16:52,506 --> 01:16:53,507
No.

1131
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,016
You would have seen it.

1132
01:16:55,509 --> 01:16:57,580
When I heard the noise & turned back,

1133
01:16:57,645 --> 01:16:58,646
You saw it!

1134
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:00,448
You saw it!

1135
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:02,419
Didn't you see?

1136
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:04,326
- There's no chance that you didn't see it.
You aren't blind, right?

1137
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:06,228
When you turned back, you saw it!
You saw it!

1138
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:08,060
Didn't you see?
- Prasad saw it.

1139
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:09,465
I saw it.
- Yes. You saw it.

1140
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:10,601
So Prasad also saw it.

1141
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:11,636
That's enough.

1142
01:17:11,692 --> 01:17:13,137
You saw him
swallowing the chain.

1143
01:17:13,194 --> 01:17:16,004
When Prasad heard the noise & turned
back, he saw him swallowing something.

1144
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:17,235
So both of them saw it, sir.

1145
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:18,435
Ya. Continue.

1146
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:21,309
And, when I started shouting,
they stopped the bus.

1147
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:23,409
The crowd caught hold of him.

1148
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:26,275
When he was caught,
did he try to escape?

1149
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:27,316
No.
- No.

1150
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,446
Why wouldn't he try to escape?
Prasad, that..

1151
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:32,389
You could catch him only because
there were so many people, right?

1152
01:17:32,446 --> 01:17:34,392
If it was only the two
of you, wouldn't he run?

1153
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:36,086
Won't he run?
- He will run.

1154
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:37,128
He ran.

1155
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:39,027
He ran away, sir.
He got down & ran away.

1156
01:17:39,086 --> 01:17:41,692
And?
- And all of us caught him and came here.

1157
01:17:42,723 --> 01:17:43,724
Didn't he run away?

1158
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:46,562
How can you catch him & bring him here?
He ran away!

1159
01:17:46,627 --> 01:17:48,197
He ran away and escaped.

1160
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:55,142
Prasad, we are saying all this because; if
the case has to be strong, he has to run.

1161
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:57,546
Only if he runs, the case will be strong.
Don't you want the chain back?

1162
01:17:57,605 --> 01:17:58,675
That's why.
He ran away!

1163
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:00,047
- Yes.
- Got it?

1164
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:03,014
So we'll show it as the police
arrested him after he ran away.

1165
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:04,756
Yes. We have to put it on
records as we arrested him.

1166
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:07,253
If we do that, the case
will be really strong.

1167
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:09,994
Sir,

1168
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:12,088
will we have any
problem if we do that?

1169
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:14,531
What problem?

1170
01:18:14,588 --> 01:18:17,000
Will we charge a case to create
a problem for you, Prasad?

1171
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:19,470
If so, everyone who files cases
here will have problems, right?

1172
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:21,507
We are charging this
case for your own good.

1173
01:18:21,562 --> 01:18:22,700
You won't have any problem.

1174
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:24,305
How can you say that?

1175
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:26,578
Dear, you know why we
are doing all this?

1176
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:29,308
People like him are born criminals.

1177
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:30,576
They shouldn't be left free!

1178
01:18:30,638 --> 01:18:32,276
We have to trap them in
the case & lock them up!

1179
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:43,217
Sir,

1180
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:44,661
note down his height.

1181
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,323
Pin him to the wall.

1182
01:18:46,387 --> 01:18:48,458
S.l. Sir already
pinned him down.

1183
01:18:48,522 --> 01:18:49,694
Sir, it's 175.

1184
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,230
What's your weight?

1185
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:55,572
68 kgs.

1186
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:57,131
Add the weight of
the chain as well.

1187
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:58,506
The chain in your stomach.

1188
01:18:58,566 --> 01:18:59,704
2 sovereigns, right?

1189
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,172
So how much would it be?

1190
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:02,346
Sixteen...

1191
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:03,643
Huh?
- 16 grams.

1192
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:05,479
16?
- That he knows correctly.

1193
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:07,311
You're learned that correctly, huh?

1194
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:08,349
He is smart!

1195
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:09,615
What's your original name?

1196
01:19:09,944 --> 01:19:10,945
Prasad PK.

1197
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:12,182
Prasad PK.

1198
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:14,515
Father's name?

1199
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:16,150
Purushan K (Male).

1200
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:18,430
Say his name.
- Purushan.

1201
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:19,487
Is that your father's name?

1202
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:21,032
Male with initials.

1203
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:23,193
Tell me your address.

1204
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,003
Kalluparambil house,

1205
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,570
Kalluparambil house.

1206
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:28,963
Andathodu P.O.

1207
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,234
What P.O.?
- Andathodu.

1208
01:19:31,365 --> 01:19:32,537
Andathodu P.O.

1209
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:37,705
Velliyancode.

1210
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,141
Velliyancode.

1211
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:43,410
Chavakkadu.

1212
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:45,123
Huh?

1213
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:46,214
Chavakkadu.

1214
01:19:46,313 --> 01:19:47,314
Chavakkadu?

1215
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:51,628
So what about Palluruthy?
- I said that when I got scared.

1216
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:53,095
Which is your police station?

1217
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:55,690
Some station in Chavakkadu.

1218
01:19:56,357 --> 01:19:58,098
Are there many stations
in Chavakkadu?

1219
01:19:58,325 --> 01:20:00,271
It's been 2O years since
I left my hometown.

1220
01:20:00,327 --> 01:20:01,397
Where did you go?

1221
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:02,463
Mangalore.

1222
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:04,165
Why?

1223
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:06,333
Tell me, dear.

1224
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,501
For..
- Huh?

1225
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:08,636
Just for fun!

1226
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:09,713
Just for fun?

1227
01:20:11,138 --> 01:20:12,276
I'll punch you!

1228
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:15,214
He left his town for fun, it seems!

1229
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:16,582
Who all are there at home?

1230
01:20:17,211 --> 01:20:19,452
When I left town, only dad's elder..
no younger brother was there.

1231
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,954
Dad's?
- Younger brother.

1232
01:20:21,515 --> 01:20:22,585
When you left your town?

1233
01:20:22,683 --> 01:20:24,128
What about your parents?

1234
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:25,163
They are dead.

1235
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:26,220
They are dead?

1236
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,027
What was your job in Mangalore?

1237
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:31,430
At a 'Night' shop, sir.

1238
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,002
Remove your shirt.
- What?

1239
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,061
At a 'Night' shop.

1240
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:35,106
'Night' shop?

1241
01:20:35,162 --> 01:20:36,232
Street food shop!
- What were you doing there?

1242
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:37,965
I made Parottas there.

1243
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:40,012
How many Parottas will you
make with 1 Kg dough?

1244
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:41,337
Around 30-35.

1245
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:42,540
35?

1246
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:44,742
You're such a bigwig, huh?

1247
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:46,450
In Mangalore, we
make small Parottas.

1248
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:47,713
If it's coin Parotta,
I'll make 60.

1249
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:49,113
How many?
- so.

1250
01:20:49,176 --> 01:20:50,314
Oh my dear!

1251
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:51,714
Do you know Kannada?

1252
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:54,052
Do you know Kannada?
- (Speaks in Kannada)

1253
01:20:54,114 --> 01:20:54,717
Prasad.

1254
01:20:54,982 --> 01:20:56,586
(Continues in Kannada)
- Prasad.

1255
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:58,288
He has learned all that.

1256
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:00,195
He's a tough nut to crack!

1257
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:02,092
What about his
identification marks?

1258
01:21:02,756 --> 01:21:04,463
Sir, there's a stab
mark on his back.

1259
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:06,466
Let me see. Turn around.

1260
01:21:06,527 --> 01:21:07,528
Turn around!

1261
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:10,998
Who stabbed you?

1262
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:12,510
No one stabbed me, sir.
- Then?

1263
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,146
Long back, when I fell into
the water, a rod struck me.

1264
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:17,148
A rod struck you?
- When I jumped.

1265
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:19,013
Why? Police was chasing you?
- No, sir.

1266
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:20,643
Then?
- I did a somersault.

1267
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:21,942
Somersault?

1268
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:24,180
During my childhood, sir.

1269
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:25,952
Can you jump like
that over here?

1270
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:27,982
You wanna jump?

1271
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:29,218
Jump!

1272
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:32,621
Well, how did you
snatch her chain?

1273
01:21:33,254 --> 01:21:34,358
Tell me, dear.

1274
01:21:34,955 --> 01:21:36,229
The chain was lying broken.

1275
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,291
Where?

1276
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:39,161
On the neck.
- On her neck.

1277
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,361
And then?

1278
01:21:41,262 --> 01:21:42,240
You pulled it.

1279
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:44,367
Because you didn't want it to fall down.
And then?

1280
01:21:44,965 --> 01:21:45,739
Swallowed it!

1281
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,274
Why? You were hungry or what?

1282
01:21:48,335 --> 01:21:49,507
Hunger is everything, sir!

1283
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:52,343
Yes, yes. That's true!

1284
01:21:52,406 --> 01:21:54,249
I'm seeing someone who eats gold
when hungry for the first time!

1285
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,720
Yes! That too, a chain of 2 sovereigns!

1286
01:21:57,444 --> 01:21:59,117
Where were you
going, on the bus?

1287
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:01,489
I was going to my hometown, sir.
To get an ID card somehow.

1288
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:03,083
Why?

1289
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:06,094
I was sent off from the last place
because I didn't have an ID card.

1290
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,765
Who?
- The police.

1291
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:10,593
The police caught you there too?
- Ya. They told me I need an ID card.

1292
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:12,433
There was another boy
working with me.

1293
01:22:12,493 --> 01:22:14,302
The police took him saying
that he doesn't have an ID.

1294
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:15,965
There has been no news of
him for the past 2 years.

1295
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,101
Is it our fault that you don't have an ID?
- I wasn't blaming you, sir.

1296
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:21,169
Then? What were you saying?
- I was saying why I was sent off.

1297
01:22:21,235 --> 01:22:22,942
I will get you an identity card!

1298
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,206
Click his photo!

1299
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:26,478
Hey! Come here!
- Go!

1300
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,178
Sign here.

1301
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:36,088
Sir, is it correct?

1302
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,158
What?

1303
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:38,218
The charges against me?

1304
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,431
Sign here!
Bloody son of Purushan!

1305
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:10,456
When do you think we would
get the chain back?

1306
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:12,087
We might get without much delay.

1307
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:14,998
I think it would
take 5-6 months.

1308
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:16,398
It won't take that long.

1309
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:21,238
Since the case has gone to court,
we have to hire a lawyer now;

1310
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:24,402
it will be quite a headache.
Wait.

1311
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:28,102
Ikka,

1312
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:29,640
any update on my field?

1313
01:23:29,703 --> 01:23:32,650
People are approaching, but the
scarcity of water is a huge issue.

1314
01:23:33,107 --> 01:23:35,451
If you dig 2 feet away
from where you dug now;

1315
01:23:35,509 --> 01:23:37,352
you might be able to get water.

1316
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:39,413
If you get water, I'll
bring people quickly!

1317
01:23:40,381 --> 01:23:41,553
Okay.

1318
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:48,160
I shouldn't have bought this
property here in a hurry.

1319
01:23:49,123 --> 01:23:53,003
Now by the time we finish the court case,
get the chain and get water finally,

1320
01:23:53,227 --> 01:23:54,604
however quickly it moves,

1321
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:57,335
I don't think we can
do farming this year.

1322
01:23:57,731 --> 01:23:59,267
What do you want now?

1323
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:01,307
What are you trying to say?

1324
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:05,382
Whatever happens, I'm not ready
for a compromise with that thief!

1325
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,619
I have a huge problem with that.

1326
01:24:09,576 --> 01:24:10,577
It's not that..

1327
01:24:11,078 --> 01:24:12,648
It's a whole lot of bad omen.

1328
01:24:13,247 --> 01:24:15,523
After losing the wedding
chain, my mind is..

1329
01:24:15,582 --> 01:24:18,256
Not having that 'something'..
- What something?

1330
01:24:19,953 --> 01:24:22,229
What has your mind lost,
after losing the chain?

1331
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:26,265
Peace of..
- Let me ask you something.

1332
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:28,402
While you sent me away
on the bus yesterday,

1333
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:30,965
you said that I lost the chain
because of my carelessness.

1334
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:33,035
Is it because of my carelessness?

1335
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:36,074
Hey! I said that unknowingly
because of my tension then.

1336
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:38,113
I just said it.
I didn't mean it.

1337
01:24:40,407 --> 01:24:44,514
An expert thief snatched my chain while I
was sleeping, because of my carelessness?

1338
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:47,958
Now hear this out as well.

1339
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:50,222
Even if we get that chain, I
swear on Vaikkathappan (God);

1340
01:24:50,284 --> 01:24:52,628
I won't wear the chain that was
inside that thief's stomach.

1341
01:24:52,686 --> 01:24:55,166
How does it matter, Sreeja? It's
the wedding chain that I tied!

1342
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:56,497
Will it lose its value?

1343
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:58,058
Tell me.

1344
01:24:58,592 --> 01:25:02,438
Chet-m, I don't consider anything
to be more valuable than our love.

1345
01:25:11,572 --> 01:25:12,983
Come.

1346
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:24,092
I'll ask my sister
for some money.

1347
01:25:25,352 --> 01:25:26,296
That's not needed.

1348
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:31,628
I have asked my brother to sell 5
cents of property from my share.

1349
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,237
So whenever it's ready, I
will have to go there once.

1350
01:25:50,477 --> 01:25:51,478
Altaf,

1351
01:25:52,112 --> 01:25:54,058
look at that boy hogging!

1352
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,129
Don't mock him, sir.

1353
01:25:58,185 --> 01:25:59,664
Kids of this age would
be really hungry.

1354
01:26:05,259 --> 01:26:07,205
Get the custody order
tomorrow morning itself.

1355
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:08,365
Thank you.

1356
01:26:17,004 --> 01:26:18,074
Prasadetta,

1357
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:19,273
Prasadetta,

1358
01:26:19,573 --> 01:26:21,052
the phone is ringing.

1359
01:26:21,108 --> 01:26:22,451
Must be from the station.

1360
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,351
Hello.

1361
01:26:31,752 --> 01:26:32,753
Sreekandan here.

1362
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:35,289
Who?

1363
01:26:36,123 --> 01:26:37,227
From Thavanakkadavu.

1364
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:38,662
Oh. Tell me, sir.

1365
01:26:39,126 --> 01:26:40,605
No.. I mean..

1366
01:26:40,727 --> 01:26:42,104
Chet-m"

1367
01:26:42,496 --> 01:26:43,634
It's your father.

1368
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,201
Hello.

1369
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:48,606
Are you doing fine, Prasad?

1370
01:26:49,236 --> 01:26:50,340
Yes. We are fine.

1371
01:26:51,238 --> 01:26:52,512
Talk to Sreeja.

1372
01:26:54,107 --> 01:26:55,142
It's your dad.

1373
01:26:56,577 --> 01:26:57,578
Hello dad.

1374
01:27:00,447 --> 01:27:02,290
Are you planning to come here?

1375
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,188
To Prasad's house or something?

1376
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:07,791
We haven't planned anything.

1377
01:27:08,388 --> 01:27:10,493
Prasadettan might have to..
- Don't come.

1378
01:27:11,225 --> 01:27:12,966
Let a couple of years pass.

1379
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,397
I will tell you.

1380
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:17,668
If you are in need of
money, just tell me.

1381
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:19,668
You don't have to
come here for that.

1382
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:21,702
I know, dad.

1383
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:24,245
Years may pass, but I know
you wouldn't call us back.

1384
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:26,411
You stay happy, dad.

1385
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,654
Are your festival committee
people doing fine?

1386
01:27:30,077 --> 01:27:31,283
- Yes.
Huh?

1387
01:27:32,379 --> 01:27:33,551
Scoundrefs daughter!

1388
01:27:34,314 --> 01:27:35,315
True.

1389
01:27:45,592 --> 01:27:46,627
Leave it, dear.

1390
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:51,002
We believe that we have
a big heart, right?

1391
01:27:52,599 --> 01:27:54,408
Aren't we the modern ones?

1392
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:58,182
Let's forgive him!

1393
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:01,575
Leave it.

1394
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:43,458
<i>HEY»</i>

1395
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:45,087
he swallowed their chain.

1396
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:46,358
- Is it?
- Ya.

1397
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:49,032
- He was taken in the morning.
To the rocks.

1398
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:52,664
They are from Alappuzha.

1399
01:28:52,726 --> 01:28:54,000
- Is it?
- Yes.

1400
01:28:55,028 --> 01:28:57,167
- Where are they staying now?
- Now at Kuniya.

1401
01:28:57,331 --> 01:28:58,332
Over there.

1402
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:01,607
Poor things, right?

1403
01:29:01,668 --> 01:29:02,669
Such a mess.

1404
01:29:02,736 --> 01:29:04,477
What are you coming there for?

1405
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:05,777
Go sit in the station.

1406
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:26,697
Be careful, Prasad.

1407
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,961
Sorry.

1408
01:29:28,328 --> 01:29:29,363
What's the status, sir?

1409
01:29:30,097 --> 01:29:31,098
He is sitting there.

1410
01:29:32,599 --> 01:29:36,046
Sir, after everything, when
would we get the chain in hand?

1411
01:29:37,003 --> 01:29:38,311
You'll get it when you get it.

1412
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:46,054
But sir, we are quite
tight financially.

1413
01:29:46,113 --> 01:29:49,754
So if we know when we would get it,
we have to plan things accordingly.

1414
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:54,054
It's a robbery case, Prasad.

1415
01:29:54,554 --> 01:29:56,363
If we try hard,

1416
01:29:56,523 --> 01:29:58,434
we will get it within
1 or 1.5 years.

1417
01:29:58,592 --> 01:29:59,764
Within 1.5 years.

1418
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:01,437
1.5 years?
- Yes.

1419
01:30:02,162 --> 01:30:04,199
Prasad, aren't you educated?

1420
01:30:04,464 --> 01:30:07,604
Or are you just walking around
with a pen in your pocket for style?

1421
01:30:09,302 --> 01:30:11,111
Don't you know how
things are over here?

1422
01:30:11,405 --> 01:30:13,282
Prasad, we'll do something.

1423
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:14,683
We'll call a lawyer..
- Sir, the thief!

1424
01:30:14,941 --> 01:30:16,386
He's running away!

1425
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:18,218
Catch him!
Don't leave him!

1426
01:30:18,378 --> 01:30:19,982
Don't let him go!
Run!

1427
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:21,658
Run!

1428
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:23,287
All of you run!

1429
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,420
Catch him!

1430
01:30:31,158 --> 01:30:33,604
Chandran Sir, Namaste.
- Sir, that Prasad ran away!

1431
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,071
Where did he go?

1432
01:30:35,128 --> 01:30:36,630
To the fields.

1433
01:30:36,997 --> 01:30:38,203
Sir, that Prasad ran away!

1434
01:30:38,265 --> 01:30:40,006
Who is on duty?
Come fast!

1435
01:30:41,301 --> 01:30:42,974
Get the bike!

1436
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:44,014
Majeesh, go fast!

1437
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:45,639
Who's there upstairs?
Come fast!

1438
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:47,343
Hurry UP!

1439
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:50,052
Go fast! He has gone
in that direction!

1440
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,748
Sir, shall I also come?
- Go inside!

1441
01:30:53,413 --> 01:30:54,687
Sir, what happened?

1442
01:30:54,748 --> 01:30:58,457
Nothing. That Prasad ran away.
They'll catch him. You wait here.

1443
01:30:59,686 --> 01:31:01,029
Make it fast.

1444
01:31:08,495 --> 01:31:09,974
Sir, Namaste.
- Tell me.

1445
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,976
Sir, that Prasad..

1446
01:31:12,132 --> 01:31:13,372
- He got away.
- Huh?

1447
01:31:14,134 --> 01:31:15,272
What are you saying?

1448
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:17,110
They took him to defecate.
- What happened? Tell me!

1449
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:43,304
Sir!

1450
01:31:43,363 --> 01:31:45,104
What the hell did you just do?

1451
01:31:45,165 --> 01:31:46,143
Shouldn't you be careful?

1452
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:47,678
He's an accused in
a robbery case.

1453
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:49,743
How can you handle him so lightly?
Where are you now?

1454
01:31:50,003 --> 01:31:51,107
I am running.

1455
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:52,377
Okay sir.

1456
01:31:53,373 --> 01:31:54,443
Come fast!

1457
01:32:22,135 --> 01:32:23,580
Me and Jaison are right
behind him, sir.

1458
01:32:25,105 --> 01:32:27,107
He is running towards the plantation side.

1459
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:29,084
You can see him, right?

1460
01:32:29,142 --> 01:32:30,416
He is right in front of my eyes.

1461
01:32:30,477 --> 01:32:31,683
I haven't allowed him
to go out of my sight!

1462
01:32:31,945 --> 01:32:34,619
Okay. Don't leave him.
Very good. Keep going!

1463
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:00,583
Shouldn't we catch him, sir?

1464
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,484
Let's get him on our Kabaddi court.
Then we'll show him!

1465
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,221
Oh my God!

1466
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:33,605
Did you get him?

1467
01:34:43,643 --> 01:34:45,384
Sir, that Sreeja is sitting
right at the door-step.

1468
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:52,361
Yes, Sreeja.
- What's happening, sir?

1469
01:34:52,585 --> 01:34:55,088
Don't worry. He's
surrounded by our people.

1470
01:34:55,155 --> 01:34:57,226
We'll get him. We just
don't have him right now.

1471
01:34:57,624 --> 01:34:59,194
Don't worry. We'll get him soon.

1472
01:34:59,259 --> 01:35:01,671
Sheeba, take Sreeja to that room.
Let her take rest.

1473
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:03,401
Go there.
- Come, Sreeja.

1474
01:35:04,197 --> 01:35:05,608
Sir, what's the situation?

1475
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:06,666
No clue!

1476
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:09,576
Did you get any information, sir?

1477
01:35:09,636 --> 01:35:10,546
No information at all?

1478
01:35:10,637 --> 01:35:13,948
Till the plantation, our
people were right behind him.

1479
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:16,385
For the last 10 minutes,
there's no clue.

1480
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:18,423
Did they check near the irrigation dept?
At the dam?

1481
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:20,151
Oh ya. irrigation..

1482
01:35:20,346 --> 01:35:22,451
Who all are here now?
- Only two of them, sir.

1483
01:35:22,515 --> 01:35:24,188
Two of them.
- Jijesh, right?

1484
01:35:24,317 --> 01:35:27,298
Jijesh, give the guard
duty to Sarala and leave.

1485
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,930
You do one thing.
You go to Adukkasthala junction.

1486
01:35:29,989 --> 01:35:31,696
Okay?
- Don't leave any vehicles.

1487
01:35:39,532 --> 01:35:40,510
Hello!

1488
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:41,944
Where are you now?

1489
01:35:42,435 --> 01:35:44,142
I'm near Badirampalla, sir.

1490
01:35:44,204 --> 01:35:45,205
What are you doing there?

1491
01:35:45,271 --> 01:35:48,115
I'll lock him in ten minutes, sir.
- What lock are you talking about?

1492
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:51,217
No, sir. Jaison and
others have cornered him.

1493
01:35:51,277 --> 01:35:53,314
We'll get him now.
- Whom are you trying to bluff?

1494
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:55,355
You'll understand it when
you lose your job. Got it?

1495
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:57,053
I have no responsibility in this.

1496
01:35:57,117 --> 01:35:58,095
You took him!

1497
01:35:58,151 --> 01:35:59,721
Right? You take
care of your job.

1498
01:35:59,986 --> 01:36:01,590
Don't inform the superiors, sir.
Please.

1499
01:36:01,688 --> 01:36:03,531
I'll show you what
I'm going to do.

1500
01:36:04,224 --> 01:36:05,225
Sir,

1501
01:36:05,692 --> 01:36:06,727
What did he say?

1502
01:36:07,026 --> 01:36:08,528
That he has locked him.

1503
01:36:08,595 --> 01:36:09,733
What lock?

1504
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:12,101
There's no information for the
last 10 minutes. He's missing!

1505
01:36:12,165 --> 01:36:14,975
You call C.l. Sir and say the matter.
We should inform him, right?

1506
01:36:15,468 --> 01:36:18,108
If I inform the C.l
now, he will come here.

1507
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:19,741
And I'll have to hear
a mouthful from him.

1508
01:36:20,073 --> 01:36:21,074
Why are you worried?

1509
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:24,281
Shouldn't he be more responsible when he
goes with an accused in a robbery case?

1510
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:26,422
That's true.

1511
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:28,481
But he already came here
on a punishment transfer.

1512
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:30,585
If this is reported,
he will lose his job.

1513
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:32,018
Chechi!

1514
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:35,515
Chechi!

1515
01:39:06,139 --> 01:39:07,345
Shiva Sir,
the C.l. is here.

1516
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:18,151
Come inside.

1517
01:39:23,056 --> 01:39:24,034
What happened?

1518
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:26,331
Sir, they took him out in the morning.
He ran away from there.

1519
01:39:26,392 --> 01:39:28,429
Who was the officer who went with him?
- A.S.l. Chandran Sir.

1520
01:39:28,494 --> 01:39:30,235
Where did the S.l. go?
- He went out.

1521
01:39:30,296 --> 01:39:31,502
He went out to search.

1522
01:39:31,564 --> 01:39:34,238
If we don't get the accused within
evening, all of you will lose your jobs!

1523
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:37,577
Suspension, removal, PR.
Even I may get a transfer, you know?

1524
01:39:38,338 --> 01:39:40,011
Go search fast!

1525
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,612
Did you inform everyone?

1526
01:39:41,674 --> 01:39:43,278
Did you inform Kumbala station?

1527
01:39:43,343 --> 01:39:44,754
Not at Kumbala.
- Did you inform the check-post?

1528
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:47,548
Yes, sir. We haven't sent a wireless message yet.
- Do it fast!

1529
01:39:47,647 --> 01:39:49,718
He will reach Karnataka by then!

1530
01:39:49,983 --> 01:39:52,054
Then we'll never be
able to find him!

1531
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,027
Where's your uniform?

1532
01:39:55,488 --> 01:39:56,990
How can you be at the station
without the uniform?

1533
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,126
Go wear your uniform!

1534
01:39:58,191 --> 01:39:59,363
Switch on the fan!

1535
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:03,336
Not that, the other one.
You don't know the fan's switch?

1536
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:04,397
The second one.

1537
01:40:08,534 --> 01:40:10,605
Gosh! The C.l. is calling.

1538
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:14,575
Hello. Good morning, sir.

1539
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,948
Namaste. What's happening?

1540
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:18,148
Sir, I am searching for the accused.

1541
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:19,622
Will you get him fast?
Before noon?

1542
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,023
We will definitely find
him & bring him, sir.

1543
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:23,583
Do one thing.
You come here.

1544
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:26,357
I have to tell you few things.
- Sir, let me search for him please.

1545
01:40:26,419 --> 01:40:28,194
How can I come there
without getting him?

1546
01:40:28,254 --> 01:40:30,359
No! You should come here!

1547
01:40:30,456 --> 01:40:31,696
You can't do that.

1548
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:33,637
Come in front of me.
- Please, sir.

1549
01:40:33,693 --> 01:40:35,434
Sir, I'll come now.

1550
01:40:35,495 --> 01:40:37,168
Hey, the S.P. doesn't
know it yet.

1551
01:40:37,663 --> 01:40:39,074
Come fast. Okay?

1552
01:40:39,132 --> 01:40:41,043
After you come, we have
to discuss few things.

1553
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,272
I'll come now, sir.

1554
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,405
- Come fast. I have to
go somewhere else too.

1555
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:45,471
Okay.

1556
01:40:46,472 --> 01:40:48,645
Gosh! I don't know what to do!

1557
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,415
C.l. must be really
angry, right?

1558
01:40:53,579 --> 01:40:55,422
Oh God! This is such a
horrible situation!

1559
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:19,256
I want my chain.

1560
01:44:20,586 --> 01:44:22,156
I want my chain back.

1561
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:27,637
I want my chain back!

1562
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,058
Get down!

1563
01:45:31,324 --> 01:45:32,325
Go!

1564
01:45:39,365 --> 01:45:40,366
Go inside!

1565
01:46:16,969 --> 01:46:18,277
What did you think?

1566
01:46:19,038 --> 01:46:20,278
How far will you run?

1567
01:46:21,707 --> 01:46:22,708
You thought you could get away?

1568
01:46:22,975 --> 01:46:24,318
Sit there.
- Move.

1569
01:46:29,715 --> 01:46:30,716
Stay still.

1570
01:46:32,084 --> 01:46:32,994
What's your name?

1571
01:46:34,286 --> 01:46:35,196
Prasad.

1572
01:46:35,421 --> 01:46:36,491
Where did you run to?

1573
01:46:42,595 --> 01:46:43,505
Sajan,

1574
01:46:43,662 --> 01:46:46,370
isn't there anyone who can
question him properly? - Yes sir.

1575
01:46:46,432 --> 01:46:47,433
<i>D . hananlayam - Sir!</i>

1576
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:48,500
Get up, you!

1577
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:49,571
Why did you run?

1578
01:46:50,703 --> 01:46:51,738
Don't hit me, sir.

1579
01:46:52,638 --> 01:46:55,050
I ran because Sir told me to.
- Which Sir told you to run?

1580
01:46:55,207 --> 01:46:56,083
Chandran Sir.

1581
01:46:57,243 --> 01:46:58,483
You son of a b!#!$!

1582
01:46:58,544 --> 01:47:00,080
Chandran, leave him!

1583
01:47:03,416 --> 01:47:05,293
Did the chain come out?

1584
01:47:06,685 --> 01:47:08,221
He asked me to run
if I get the chain.

1585
01:47:08,454 --> 01:47:10,456
Like Sir told me, I have kept
it on top of the bus stop.

1586
01:47:12,091 --> 01:47:13,263
That's not possible, sir.

1587
01:47:13,426 --> 01:47:15,702
Do a medical test.
Take him, fast!

1588
01:47:16,262 --> 01:47:17,673
Don't cause any trouble.
- Okay sir.

1589
01:47:21,567 --> 01:47:22,511
Chandran!

1590
01:47:24,103 --> 01:47:25,377
You needn't go for
the medical test.

1591
01:47:25,971 --> 01:47:27,075
Rahim!
- Sir!

1592
01:47:37,316 --> 01:47:39,626
If the chain is not
in your stomach,

1593
01:47:44,023 --> 01:47:45,195
Sit down!

1594
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,262
Do you want to be smashed?

1595
01:48:02,308 --> 01:48:03,252
<i>Chandra“ sir,</i>

1596
01:48:04,143 --> 01:48:05,144
C.l. Sir is calling you.

1597
01:48:16,322 --> 01:48:17,630
And they had called
from the hospital.

1598
01:48:18,457 --> 01:48:20,164
They said that the
chain is missing.

1599
01:48:20,526 --> 01:48:21,561
What?

1600
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:23,197
They are saying
that it's missing.

1601
01:48:23,629 --> 01:48:25,336
It's okay.
We'll manage somehow.

1602
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:27,402
We'll manage it.

1603
01:48:29,702 --> 01:48:31,113
What is this, Sajan?

1604
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:32,240
Aren't you a young man?

1605
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:34,246
People have a good
opinion about you.

1606
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:36,475
But one such case is enough
to destroy your image.

1607
01:48:37,276 --> 01:48:38,448
PR, Suspension;

1608
01:48:38,978 --> 01:48:40,514
I'll face only a
supervisory lapse.

1609
01:48:40,679 --> 01:48:44,126
It might turn into a PR. But I have
influence among the superiors.

1610
01:48:44,183 --> 01:48:45,594
I'll settle it that way.
But you are screwed!

1611
01:48:46,752 --> 01:48:47,753
Didn't you know?

1612
01:48:48,053 --> 01:48:49,327
The chain is not in his stomach.

1613
01:48:50,356 --> 01:48:52,233
What is this, buddy?
Will we get it?

1614
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:53,395
Or did you swallow it?

1615
01:48:53,692 --> 01:48:55,535
Sir, he is lying!

1616
01:48:55,594 --> 01:48:56,664
I haven't taken it.

1617
01:48:56,729 --> 01:48:58,709
No, sir. He won't take it. He
is almost about to retire.

1618
01:48:59,064 --> 01:49:00,509
There are so many
people here, right?

1619
01:49:00,766 --> 01:49:02,302
Why did he take his
name in particular?

1620
01:49:02,434 --> 01:49:04,277
Sir, I was the one
who took him out.

1621
01:49:05,137 --> 01:49:08,084
So he must be thinking that I trapped him.
That's why he said my name.

1622
01:49:08,674 --> 01:49:10,153
If so, I hit him more, right?

1623
01:49:10,309 --> 01:49:11,481
Then he should say
my name, right?

1624
01:49:11,644 --> 01:49:13,180
You didn't pay attention.
That was your mistake.

1625
01:49:13,245 --> 01:49:14,417
Exactly!
Carelessness.

1626
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,557
How many news reports
have come in the papers?

1627
01:49:16,615 --> 01:49:19,152
How many incidents happened?
But the police won't learn!

1628
01:49:19,218 --> 01:49:20,993
They keep repeating
it again and again.

1629
01:49:21,053 --> 01:49:22,555
Sir, please give
me some more time.

1630
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:24,999
Once he is brought back,
I'll get it from him.

1631
01:49:25,124 --> 01:49:26,330
I will give you one hour.

1632
01:49:26,525 --> 01:49:28,527
If you don't get it within then,
I'll send a special report.

1633
01:49:28,594 --> 01:49:30,699
If that's sent, your suspension
is confirmed. You know right?

1634
01:49:30,963 --> 01:49:32,237
You might even face a removal.

1635
01:49:32,298 --> 01:49:33,368
GD is pending, right?

1636
01:49:33,432 --> 01:49:35,070
Sir, he had told me not
to write for an hour.

1637
01:49:35,134 --> 01:49:37,136
Sir, we haven't said it on the wireless.
No one knows it.

1638
01:49:37,202 --> 01:49:38,306
What wireless?

1639
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:40,748
WhatsApp, Facebook..
Don't you know that times have changed?

1640
01:49:41,006 --> 01:49:42,212
It would already
be on the group.

1641
01:49:42,274 --> 01:49:45,312
The thief running away.. Most kids in the
town would be sharing it on Wha1sApp.

1642
01:49:45,377 --> 01:49:46,583
Such a disgrace!

1643
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:49,484
You have one hour.

1644
01:49:49,548 --> 01:49:51,255
You can use all the
force you want;

1645
01:49:51,317 --> 01:49:53,263
or use your crooked
mind or whatever;

1646
01:49:53,319 --> 01:49:54,525
we should get the stuff!

1647
01:49:58,023 --> 01:50:00,526
Be careful. When he roughs him up,
it shouldn't go out of control.

1648
01:50:00,693 --> 01:50:02,673
Or people would barge
in and create a huge issue.

1649
01:50:03,762 --> 01:50:06,709
Sadanandan is calling, sir.
- See if it's something related to this.

1650
01:50:07,633 --> 01:50:08,737
Hello. Tell me Sadanandan!

1651
01:50:09,001 --> 01:50:10,275
Sir, he got away!
- Huh?

1652
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:14,080
I searched all over this forest, sir.

1653
01:50:14,473 --> 01:50:15,451
I can't find him, sir.

1654
01:50:15,507 --> 01:50:16,508
Where are you now?

1655
01:50:16,575 --> 01:50:18,316
I'm near the irrigation department.

1656
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:20,285
You are so brilliant!

1657
01:50:20,446 --> 01:50:21,948
We got him!
Do you understand?

1658
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:23,683
You go find someone else!
Go!

1659
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:26,528
What?
- He couldn't find the accused, it seems!

1660
01:50:26,952 --> 01:50:28,124
He didn't know it?

1661
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,322
Such great policemen you have!

1662
01:50:30,456 --> 01:50:31,696
Then why wouldn't he get away?

1663
01:50:31,957 --> 01:50:34,028
He should have been thrown
out of service long back!

1664
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:45,479
Prasad, you want water?

1665
01:50:46,405 --> 01:50:47,383
What's the scene?
- Prasad!

1666
01:50:47,673 --> 01:50:48,674
Drink it!

1667
01:50:54,546 --> 01:50:55,547
Prasad,

1668
01:50:56,248 --> 01:50:57,352
What is this, Prasad?

1669
01:50:57,549 --> 01:50:59,028
Shouldn't we get this done with?

1670
01:50:59,251 --> 01:51:01,458
We have been behind
this for 2 days, right?

1671
01:51:02,254 --> 01:51:03,255
Look at me.

1672
01:51:03,522 --> 01:51:04,523
When you came here,

1673
01:51:04,723 --> 01:51:06,361
didn't you see 2
people sitting there?

1674
01:51:06,725 --> 01:51:08,170
Prasad & Sreeja?

1675
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,538
Didn't you see them?

1676
01:51:10,062 --> 01:51:11,632
When they are staying
as a family,

1677
01:51:11,697 --> 01:51:13,370
if they lose their
wedding chain;

1678
01:51:13,565 --> 01:51:15,272
it will be a huge blow to them.

1679
01:51:16,535 --> 01:51:17,536
Do you hear me?

1680
01:51:18,303 --> 01:51:19,281
So,

1681
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:20,578
if they lose this wedding chain,

1682
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,712
they will be really
emotional about it.

1683
01:51:25,978 --> 01:51:27,582
You might not understand it.

1684
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:30,051
Can you hear me?

1685
01:51:30,315 --> 01:51:31,692
Where did you keep the chain?

1686
01:51:33,218 --> 01:51:34,595
It's on top of the bus-stop.

1687
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:36,488
Prasad,

1688
01:51:37,356 --> 01:51:38,699
I'm saying this for your sake.

1689
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:43,366
If they get this chain, they are not
interested to proceed with this case.

1690
01:51:44,329 --> 01:51:45,467
If they get the chain,

1691
01:51:45,531 --> 01:51:48,137
they will be ready for a
compromise right here, right now.

1692
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:50,207
What's your opinion?

1693
01:51:51,236 --> 01:51:53,682
How can a case where the FIR has
been filed, be compromised?

1694
01:51:54,973 --> 01:51:56,646
This m********r knows
all the procedures.

1695
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:59,053
Prasad, give it back to them.
Why are you doing it?

1696
01:52:00,112 --> 01:52:01,523
Prasad, you better
say the truth.

1697
01:52:02,514 --> 01:52:04,187
Or else, it will
be a huge problem.

1698
01:52:04,383 --> 01:52:05,657
Chandran Sir..
- Do you hear me?

1699
01:52:05,718 --> 01:52:08,528
I gave it to Chandran sir.
- Tell me the truth. Where is the chain?

1700
01:52:08,754 --> 01:52:10,324
Chandran sir..
- Give it back, you son of a b****!

1701
01:52:10,389 --> 01:52:11,629
Don't test our patience!

1702
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:14,436
This f"'*****r has been repeating
the same thing from the start.

1703
01:52:14,493 --> 01:52:16,700
He has been screwing us over
ever since he came here.

1704
01:52:17,062 --> 01:52:18,473
What did you think?

1705
01:52:19,164 --> 01:52:20,666
What did you think?
- Give the chain back!

1706
01:52:20,933 --> 01:52:23,209
- I gave it to Chandran Sir.
- I'll rip you apart, son of a b*****!

1707
01:52:23,268 --> 01:52:24,542
Give it back.
- Don't abuse my mom, sir!

1708
01:52:24,603 --> 01:52:26,708
What will you do if
we swear at your mom?

1709
01:52:26,972 --> 01:52:27,973
<i>Chandra“ Sir,</i>

1710
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:29,644
Sir, tell them. I did all this
because you told me, right?

1711
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:31,984
Are you going to say it or
should I break your ******!

1712
01:52:32,044 --> 01:52:33,045
Give it back!

1713
01:52:33,112 --> 01:52:34,113
Sir has it.

1714
01:52:34,179 --> 01:52:35,249
Say the truth!
- Don't abuse me!

1715
01:52:35,314 --> 01:52:36,987
What will you do if we abuse you?

1716
01:52:37,049 --> 01:52:39,051
Didn't you tell me to
run if I get the chain?

1717
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:41,564
You said you'll take care of everything.
- Stretch your hand, you mo******r!

1718
01:52:42,054 --> 01:52:43,624
Stretch your hand, you *****!

1719
01:52:43,689 --> 01:52:45,225
Stretch it!
- Hold his hand.

1720
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,134
Don't hurt me.
I ran because you told me to.

1721
01:52:48,494 --> 01:52:50,496
Like this"

1722
01:52:50,662 --> 01:52:52,642
Where is the chain?

1723
01:52:53,365 --> 01:52:56,209
Have you seen the game inserting
the pencil into the knuckles? Like this?

1724
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,010
Sir, you asked me to run!

1725
01:53:03,075 --> 01:53:05,112
Say the truth!

1726
01:53:05,377 --> 01:53:07,050
Whom did you give it to?

1727
01:53:07,112 --> 01:53:09,251
I ran because you told me to.
- I told you?

1728
01:53:09,515 --> 01:53:10,926
I told you?
Yes!

1729
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:12,494
Hold him!

1730
01:53:12,551 --> 01:53:13,962
Where is the chain?

1731
01:53:15,387 --> 01:53:19,199
Did I tell you?
Tell me, you son of a ****!..

1732
01:53:19,958 --> 01:53:22,564
Tell me!
- Say it, you son of a ****..

1733
01:53:28,634 --> 01:53:30,204
There's nothing to worry.

1734
01:53:30,402 --> 01:53:31,403
Hey! Sreeja!

1735
01:53:32,004 --> 01:53:33,142
It's all right.

1736
01:53:33,205 --> 01:53:34,479
It's not like you think.

1737
01:53:37,943 --> 01:53:41,481
Tell me, you ****

1738
01:53:45,184 --> 01:53:46,219
Take him there!

1739
01:53:46,285 --> 01:53:48,196
Walk that side!

1740
01:53:50,222 --> 01:53:53,101
You thought you could screw the
police over and get away, f"'***r?

1741
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:54,432
But it was Prasad who
caught me, right?

1742
01:53:54,493 --> 01:53:56,370
Haven't you had enough?

1743
01:54:04,736 --> 01:54:05,737
Hey!

1744
01:54:06,171 --> 01:54:07,206
Get up!

1745
01:54:08,006 --> 01:54:08,677
Hey!

1746
01:54:09,441 --> 01:54:11,352
<i>Don't mess with us, you W”!
Get up!</i>

1747
01:54:12,511 --> 01:54:13,512
Hey!

1748
01:54:17,082 --> 01:54:18,493
Bring some cold
water from the jug.

1749
01:54:19,651 --> 01:54:20,629
Hey!

1750
01:54:20,686 --> 01:54:21,687
Get up!

1751
01:54:24,056 --> 01:54:25,057
What happened, Shaji?

1752
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:26,601
I think he's unconscious, sir.
- Huh?

1753
01:54:26,625 --> 01:54:27,968
Unconscious?

1754
01:54:34,533 --> 01:54:35,637
What happened?

1755
01:54:35,934 --> 01:54:37,971
Will you make me lose my job?
- He is fine.

1756
01:54:38,637 --> 01:54:40,514
He is just messing with us.

1757
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,041
Prasad!

1758
01:54:43,575 --> 01:54:44,576
Don't over-act!

1759
01:54:46,245 --> 01:54:48,282
Pour the water on his ear.

1760
01:54:51,416 --> 01:54:54,727
Oh my God! They are
going to kill me!

1761
01:55:01,093 --> 01:55:02,231
Don't leave him!

1762
01:55:02,661 --> 01:55:03,662
Kick him!

1763
01:55:03,996 --> 01:55:04,997
Come here, you!

1764
01:55:29,922 --> 01:55:31,196
Are they over-doing it?

1765
01:55:32,124 --> 01:55:33,125
Where's the GD?

1766
01:55:33,191 --> 01:55:35,432
He went unconscious, sir.
So, GD has gone upstairs.

1767
01:55:35,594 --> 01:55:37,232
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1768
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:39,938
Let's go.

1769
01:55:50,342 --> 01:55:51,685
Stop it!

1770
01:55:52,044 --> 01:55:53,387
Move!
Shaji!

1771
01:55:53,445 --> 01:55:54,287
<i>Sham!</i>

1772
01:55:54,346 --> 01:55:55,484
Chandran!

1773
01:55:55,547 --> 01:55:56,685
What is this?

1774
01:55:57,015 --> 01:55:58,221
What are you doing?

1775
01:55:58,283 --> 01:56:00,229
I can't breathe. Sir, I will die now!
- Stop!

1776
01:56:00,252 --> 01:56:02,095
Sir.. I will die..
- Stop it!

1777
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:06,464
All of you want to go to jail?

1778
01:56:06,725 --> 01:56:08,227
You went on a rampage?

1779
01:56:08,527 --> 01:56:09,733
There should be a
limit for everything.

1780
01:56:10,062 --> 01:56:11,268
Shaji, you stay here.

1781
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:12,707
Everyone else, go outside.
Come on!

1782
01:56:14,466 --> 01:56:15,706
What have you done?

1783
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:30,722
What will we do if
something happens to him?

1784
01:56:31,283 --> 01:56:33,058
There's no point in
hitting him again.

1785
01:56:34,686 --> 01:56:35,687
N ow,

1786
01:56:37,255 --> 01:56:38,563
we'll fit another chain on him.

1787
01:56:39,257 --> 01:56:40,759
Get it.
- Sir, give me some more time.

1788
01:56:41,026 --> 01:56:43,131
Don't say anything.
Just do what I say!

1789
01:56:44,129 --> 01:56:46,234
Sir, Prasad & Sreeja are
asking if they can leave.

1790
01:56:46,298 --> 01:56:47,299
Ya. I'm coming.

1791
01:56:47,532 --> 01:56:48,533
You got me?

1792
01:56:49,267 --> 01:56:50,268
Sir!

1793
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,514
Give me a cigarette.

1794
01:56:59,544 --> 01:57:00,352
Yes, Prasad.

1795
01:57:00,412 --> 01:57:02,085
Sir, shall we leave then?

1796
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:03,148
Okay.

1797
01:57:03,248 --> 01:57:05,455
And, we have questioned
him properly upstairs.

1798
01:57:05,517 --> 01:57:06,757
Things are proceeding correctly.

1799
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:09,192
You will get the chain tomorrow.
Don't have any doubt.

1800
01:57:09,254 --> 01:57:11,165
Don't be tensed.
Okay?

1801
01:57:12,524 --> 01:57:14,026
Don't hit him again, sir.

1802
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:15,605
It's okay even if we
don't get the chain.

1803
01:57:16,361 --> 01:57:18,671
We won't hit him. They
are doing it correctly.

1804
01:57:19,031 --> 01:57:20,408
Okay?
And ya,

1805
01:57:21,099 --> 01:57:24,376
In this case, you and us should be
together. You are the complainants.

1806
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:26,313
Understood, right?

1807
01:57:28,073 --> 01:57:29,347
You may leave, then.

1808
01:57:30,142 --> 01:57:31,143
Okay.

1809
01:57:54,299 --> 01:57:55,300
<i>Chandra“ sir,</i>

1810
01:57:55,767 --> 01:57:59,112
I sent this Prasad's photo
on our Wha1sApp group.

1811
01:58:00,105 --> 01:58:02,676
So a policeman from Payyannur
has identified him.

1812
01:58:03,675 --> 01:58:05,382
But, he is not charged in any case.

1813
01:58:05,544 --> 01:58:08,787
The funny part is that he said
that he was a mute guy over there.

1814
01:58:09,681 --> 01:58:12,662
So they are also not quite
sure if it's the same guy.

1815
01:58:14,519 --> 01:58:16,192
I'm quite sure about it.

1816
01:58:16,588 --> 01:58:18,625
Not just a mute guy, he can
even act as an animal!

1817
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:20,067
That's also possible!

1818
01:58:38,677 --> 01:58:40,384
You started smoking again?

1819
01:58:46,518 --> 01:58:47,690
There's so much tension.

1820
01:58:49,654 --> 01:58:52,430
If the S.l. hadn't stopped
me, I would have..

1821
01:58:54,126 --> 01:58:57,107
Haven't you understood yet that no
would reform if you beat them up?

1822
01:58:57,629 --> 01:58:59,006
You hit your son a lot.

1823
01:58:59,364 --> 01:59:00,707
And then what happened?

1824
01:59:19,317 --> 01:59:20,318
I'm fed up!

1825
01:59:22,521 --> 01:59:25,195
There are only a few more days left.
I think I'll take leave.

1826
01:59:27,259 --> 01:59:28,260
That's better.

1827
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,732
We can go stay with our daughter.

1828
01:59:46,545 --> 01:59:47,717
Where does Prasad stay?

1829
01:59:48,647 --> 01:59:50,058
Prasad?
- Next door.

1830
01:59:51,183 --> 01:59:52,127
That one?

1831
02:00:16,007 --> 02:00:17,509
Why did you leave
without telling me?

1832
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:21,218
No sir. I told the S.l.
before leaving.

1833
02:00:21,646 --> 02:00:22,556
Come in.

1834
02:00:28,386 --> 02:00:29,387
Sit down.

1835
02:00:35,126 --> 02:00:37,402
Even our quarters have only
these many facilities, Prasad.

1836
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:39,468
Sit down, Prasad.

1837
02:00:40,298 --> 02:00:41,299
Sit.

1838
02:00:45,237 --> 02:00:47,114
Dear..
Nothing. Just like that..

1839
02:00:48,173 --> 02:00:49,481
We enquired about him.

1840
02:00:50,075 --> 02:00:51,247
He is a born criminal!

1841
02:00:52,043 --> 02:00:53,613
Didn't you hear what
he said yesterday?

1842
02:00:54,613 --> 02:00:56,024
He's a filthy guy!

1843
02:00:56,314 --> 02:00:57,588
He can go to any extent!

1844
02:00:59,251 --> 02:01:00,252
It's nothing.

1845
02:01:00,352 --> 02:01:01,330
You just do one thing.

1846
02:01:01,386 --> 02:01:03,730
Come to the station tomorrow and
say that this is your chain.

1847
02:01:07,559 --> 02:01:09,004
The chain is mine.

1848
02:01:09,394 --> 02:01:11,374
For the time being, we
can proceed with this.

1849
02:01:11,663 --> 02:01:15,076
When you win the case in court, you can
take this chain. It's 2 sovereigns.

1850
02:01:20,105 --> 02:01:21,516
We don't have a complaint, sir.

1851
02:01:22,173 --> 02:01:25,086
And we're not intending to proceed
anywhere with this complaint.

1852
02:01:26,044 --> 02:01:28,081
Prasad, this happens here.

1853
02:01:28,146 --> 02:01:29,591
We do this quite often.

1854
02:01:30,982 --> 02:01:32,689
Dear, shouldn't we trap him?

1855
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:37,722
No, sir.
We are not interested.

1856
02:01:41,526 --> 02:01:42,527
Dear,

1857
02:01:43,628 --> 02:01:45,471
I was also born to a
respectable family.

1858
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:47,971
Not just me.
Many of us.

1859
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:52,140
We searched his shit and ran all
over town in a frenzy for you.

1860
02:01:53,371 --> 02:01:55,317
We have done this for
many and gotten trapped.

1861
02:01:55,674 --> 02:01:57,551
We are policemen, right?
It's a thankless job.

1862
02:01:59,077 --> 02:02:00,613
Our superiors are
merciless people.

1863
02:02:01,246 --> 02:02:02,486
I might be in trouble tomorrow.

1864
02:02:03,682 --> 02:02:05,093
Thanks a lot, Prasad.

1865
02:02:06,284 --> 02:02:07,354
Sir!

1866
02:02:07,585 --> 02:02:08,996
We will come, sir.

1867
02:02:11,156 --> 02:02:12,396
I won't force you, Prasad.

1868
02:02:13,358 --> 02:02:14,234
No, sir.

1869
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:16,198
We don't need the chain.

1870
02:02:17,095 --> 02:02:19,302
But we will come
there and say it.

1871
02:02:19,564 --> 02:02:21,635
Come at your own leisure.
After 10 AM.

1872
02:02:22,667 --> 02:02:23,668
Bye .

1873
02:02:33,478 --> 02:02:35,458
Your body must be paining
really badly, right?

1874
02:02:37,148 --> 02:02:38,218
Yes, Sudhakaran.

1875
02:02:40,352 --> 02:02:41,456
Can you press my leg?

1876
02:02:43,121 --> 02:02:44,122
Please.

1877
02:02:50,729 --> 02:02:51,730
These guys..

1878
02:02:52,564 --> 02:02:53,668
These policemen..

1879
02:02:54,499 --> 02:02:55,739
Their approach isn't right.

1880
02:02:58,370 --> 02:03:00,213
If a thorn pierces our leg,

1881
02:03:01,272 --> 02:03:02,979
should we chop our
leg to get rid of it?

1882
02:03:04,509 --> 02:03:07,217
That thorn alone should be
pulled out nicely, like this.

1883
02:03:09,948 --> 02:03:11,450
While on a job,

1884
02:03:15,053 --> 02:03:19,126
the skin will be touched
softly with a cutter;

1885
02:03:21,326 --> 02:03:23,067
Only if the person doesn't move,

1886
02:03:24,028 --> 02:03:26,338
the chain will be cut.

1887
02:03:28,633 --> 02:03:30,544
Then one end of the
chain is taken,

1888
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:33,110
and put on top of the cloth.

1889
02:03:34,305 --> 02:03:35,409
And then slowly,

1890
02:03:36,674 --> 02:03:38,017
in that groove,

1891
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:41,351
it should be rolled on
the finger, like this.

1892
02:03:43,448 --> 02:03:45,587
It should be rolled,
rolled and then pulled!

1893
02:03:47,152 --> 02:03:48,153
WOW!

1894
02:03:50,655 --> 02:03:53,534
These guys who go on bikes and snatch
chains won't understand all this.

1895
02:03:54,025 --> 02:03:56,232
There are Singapore-cutting chains.
They look good.

1896
02:03:56,294 --> 02:03:57,500
But they're really sharp.

1897
02:03:57,996 --> 02:04:00,101
With one pull, it might slice the
throat & the person would die!

1898
02:04:00,165 --> 02:04:01,508
That's called robbery.

1899
02:04:01,566 --> 02:04:02,977
This is a simple theft.

1900
02:04:03,568 --> 02:04:04,569
Heel, please.

1901
02:04:05,303 --> 02:04:07,442
If you're such an expert,
how did she catch you?

1902
02:04:09,007 --> 02:04:10,315
One in a thousand might flop.

1903
02:04:11,176 --> 02:04:12,917
And that road wasn't
comfortable at all.

1904
02:04:13,178 --> 02:04:14,919
Towards the south, the
roads are really good.

1905
02:04:15,513 --> 02:04:17,015
You're screwed anyway, right?

1906
02:04:17,115 --> 02:04:18,651
Isn't it better to
give the chain back,

1907
02:04:18,983 --> 02:04:20,223
and save your life?

1908
02:04:21,586 --> 02:04:23,998
One should never give up
until the last moment.

1909
02:04:24,589 --> 02:04:26,068
That's my style.

1910
02:04:28,259 --> 02:04:29,203
There is still hope.

1911
02:04:40,505 --> 02:04:43,008
Sir, wedding chain.
42 milligram.

1912
02:04:47,645 --> 02:04:50,455
The chain is 15 grams
and 82 milligrams.

1913
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:57,021
Here you go, sir.

1914
02:04:57,989 --> 02:05:00,663
Chandran sir, Prasad & wife have come.
- Ask them to come.

1915
02:05:03,261 --> 02:05:04,399
Come.
Sit down.

1916
02:05:13,605 --> 02:05:14,948
Isn't this your chain?

1917
02:05:15,473 --> 02:05:16,451
Yes.

1918
02:05:16,508 --> 02:05:17,509
Isn't it?

1919
02:05:21,012 --> 02:05:22,150
And this is your locket.

1920
02:05:22,213 --> 02:05:23,191
Yes.

1921
02:05:23,248 --> 02:05:24,352
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1922
02:05:24,949 --> 02:05:26,223
Isn't this what you lost?

1923
02:05:27,285 --> 02:05:28,161
Yes.

1924
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:30,993
He was the one who
stole it, right?

1925
02:05:32,156 --> 02:05:33,157
Yes.

1926
02:05:35,426 --> 02:05:36,928
Wait. I'll be right back.

1927
02:05:48,606 --> 02:05:50,279
If that is Sreeja's chain,

1928
02:05:51,009 --> 02:05:52,147
I rest this case.

1929
02:05:55,647 --> 02:05:58,389
I had a small hope
that Sreeja won't lie.

1930
02:05:58,616 --> 02:06:00,152
You made me say it!

1931
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:03,190
Leave that.

1932
02:06:03,488 --> 02:06:04,523
Leave it.

1933
02:06:06,024 --> 02:06:07,264
I'll lose <i>7</i> years of mine.

1934
02:06:07,592 --> 02:06:08,502
Let it go!

1935
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:15,604
Yesterday, near the canal; the place
where I tried to climb up a second time?

1936
02:06:18,002 --> 02:06:19,982
I threw the chain up there.

1937
02:06:23,174 --> 02:06:24,585
If you search there,
you can find it.

1938
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,482
Let it not be a loss
for both of us.

1939
02:06:31,649 --> 02:06:34,027
If I give it to the police,
your things won't proceed.

1940
02:06:34,385 --> 02:06:36,991
You need it urgently, right?
Don't you want to dig a well?

1941
02:06:40,425 --> 02:06:42,564
I am also in dire need of money.

1942
02:06:43,294 --> 02:06:44,568
But you would think
I'm bluffing.

1943
02:06:49,067 --> 02:06:51,047
Can't you make a
living by doing some job?

1944
02:06:51,369 --> 02:06:52,712
My dear Prasad, l..

1945
02:06:53,171 --> 02:06:54,172
Prasad,

1946
02:06:54,539 --> 02:06:55,745
Are you fine?
- Yes sir.

1947
02:06:56,174 --> 02:06:57,175
Not to you.

1948
02:06:57,675 --> 02:06:58,676
I'm fine, sir.

1949
02:07:02,113 --> 02:07:03,091
Where is Chandran sir?

1950
02:07:03,281 --> 02:07:05,022
He has gone to get the
charge-sheet signed.

1951
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:11,061
I know that you are a
naive guy, Prasad.

1952
02:07:11,689 --> 02:07:12,690
I like you.

1953
02:07:13,124 --> 02:07:14,398
That's why I took your name.

1954
02:07:15,627 --> 02:07:19,200
I also wish to live respectably
like you with a family and all.

1955
02:07:21,065 --> 02:07:22,544
I tried doing many jobs.

1956
02:07:22,667 --> 02:07:24,078
I even tried making Parottas.

1957
02:07:24,502 --> 02:07:26,140
I'm not able to do any of it!

1958
02:07:31,175 --> 02:07:33,052
I have to live properly,
at least from now on.

1959
02:07:36,347 --> 02:07:37,724
But my future is in your hands.

1960
02:07:40,652 --> 02:07:42,632
You just have to say the
truth in court, Sreeja.

1961
02:07:43,154 --> 02:07:44,428
That it's not your chain.

1962
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:51,371
Here, you should say what
they ask you to say.

1963
02:07:51,496 --> 02:07:53,567
The police's game will end here.

1964
02:07:53,665 --> 02:07:55,235
They have no value in court.

1965
02:07:55,366 --> 02:07:57,107
There, the deal is between us.

1966
02:08:02,073 --> 02:08:03,074
The statement..

1967
02:08:04,475 --> 02:08:05,681
It's from yesterday's session.

1968
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,058
Even if you change the statement,
the police won't care.

1969
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:14,994
What kind of a man are you?

1970
02:08:20,091 --> 02:08:21,126
<i>Chandra“ sir,</i>

1971
02:08:21,292 --> 02:08:22,430
Sweets from the temple.

1972
02:08:25,463 --> 02:08:26,567
Give it to them too.

1973
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:30,711
It's from the temple here.

1974
02:08:38,443 --> 02:08:40,081
Have it. I haven't had a bath.

1975
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:50,555
Sreeja,

1976
02:08:51,022 --> 02:08:52,023
sign here.

1977
02:08:53,624 --> 02:08:55,262
And you sign here.

1978
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:07,274
Kallar,
- Yes sir.

1979
02:09:08,372 --> 02:09:09,442
It's done.
You can leave.

1980
02:09:09,574 --> 02:09:11,144
I'll call you if
we need something.
