1
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,837
- He's first this year too.
- Same story every year.

2
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,708
Congratulations. You've
brought honour to the college.

3
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:59,723
I want you to go to Switzerland
and study atomic energy.

4
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:04,386
- Sir, I've done M. Sc. That's it.
- Give it a thought.

5
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:08,398
If you can go abroad for
your career, your country...

6
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,060
I'll help you in every way

7
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,403
My circumstances are such
that I'll prefer to work.

8
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,013
Mother, are you crying?

9
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,414
It's nothing son.
Tears are such cheats.

10
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,419
They won't let you hide
happiness or sorrow.

11
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,922
Your father's words came to mind...

12
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:46,428
We'll send Ashok abroad
to get the highest degree.

13
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,776
I've got the highest degree
As regards going abroad...

14
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:55,846
Forget about it.

15
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,943
Won't you fulfill your
late father's last wish?

16
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:07,449
You don't understand. One
needs lots of money to go abroad.

17
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,125
- How much?
- At least 10 to 15000.

18
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:23,874
Where did you get this much cash?

19
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,474
These ornaments were lying
unused after your father died.

20
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,648
I'd thought of giving
them to your bride.

21
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,483
Make them yourself when
you return from abroad.

22
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,496
You will go abroad.

23
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,506
This letter is addressed to
the Dean of the University.

24
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,509
Jamnadas is a good friend of mine

25
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:11,515
I've cabled him. He'll come to
Zurich airport to receive you.

26
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:25,026
May I leave?

27
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:35,879
Live long. Son, take care.

28
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:41,543
Study hard and don't worry about me

29
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:49,561
If you believe in your God
ask Him for only one boon...

30
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:56,559
I want you to be my mother for
the next 100 births and I...

31
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,636
That's my second wife.

32
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:13,635
- And that's her son.
- You mean, your son

33
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,642
My son? I don't think
he even cares for his own Pop

34
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,143
My name is Jamnadas not Jumbo

35
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:27,649
It might sound nice in India
but here Jumbo sounds sweet.

36
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,256
There's no comparison between
Jamuna's slave and Jumbo Jet.

37
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,327
You should be happy.

38
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,070
Is this a home or a den
for gambling and drinking?

39
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:42,664
- This is only beer.
- Cheers.

40
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,412
Get up.

41
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:56,280
I say, get up. Please.

42
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:07,699
This is my wife, Ranidevi
And her gifted son, Vikram.

43
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,967
This is Ashok, the favorite
student of my friend his Principal

44
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,435
He's come to study at the University

45
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,703
Son, let me take you to your flat

46
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:25,445
Did you hear how lovingly
Dad addressed a stranger as son?

47
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:29,116
And he never talks
straight to your son

48
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:36,718
Tolerate it till the account
is transferred to our name.

49
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,220
Don't annoy him.

50
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,261
- Beware!
- What's wrong?

51
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,435
- Are you Indian? - Yes.
- Your good name?

52
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,769
Meaning you're a Hindu
And a Brahmin to top it!

53
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:33,377
I'm Murlidhar Chaturvedi
I'm your caste brother.

54
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,782
I beg you, fall at your feet
don't step in this hotel!

55
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,192
I have been corrupted.
So will you be! Don't go in!

56
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,792
- You haven't yet gone.
- I won't leave.

57
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,191
Long live the revolution!

58
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,134
Who is this man?

59
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,797
I fired him so
he's down to Satyagraha.

60
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,800
Hunger strike, shouting
slogans, non-violence...

61
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:01,136
what else can these
bloody Indians do!

62
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:07,812
Every Indian doesn't believe
in non-violence. Neither do I.

63
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,824
Don't' you dare abuse any
Indian specially in my presence.

64
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:23,228
You've made India proud
by rendering him speechless.

65
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,827
But why did he fire you?

66
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,831
He brought me here from Gurdaspur

67
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,843
He said he ran a vegetarian hotel.

68
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:37,509
My job was to serve food and I did

69
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:42,844
But today I realised
this crook deceived me!

70
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,851
He couldn't find staff here
so he trapped me!

71
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:51,193
- But what happened?
- What he called potatoes...

72
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,855
They turned out to be duck's eggs

73
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,866
The English vegetables
turned out to be meat!

74
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,864
I have been corrupted.
I don't know what to do!

75
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,872
When I refused to serve,
he fired me.

76
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,872
I have neither money nor shelter

77
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:15,217
- I'll kill myself!
- Don't cry.

78
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,881
- Come with me.
- On this very road!

79
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:24,227
- With you?
- Yes, stay in my flat.

80
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,889
You seem to be an angel in disguise

81
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:32,302
- I'm your devotee!
- You're my brother.

82
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,395
Indian brother.

83
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,903
Brother, have some tea.

84
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,909
- Where did these come from?
- They're papads from Hapud.

85
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:51,913
My dear mother gave them to
me when I left the village.

86
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:56,417
She said, fry and
eat these when you miss me.

87
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:10,932
I ate them 9 years ago.

88
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,434
In Delhi.

89
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,966
Sorry to eat them without
asking. Who made them?

90
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,469
Mother... I mean I did.

91
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,968
I am Murlidhar Chaturvedi
from Gurdaspur.

92
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,643
- Mine?
- No, I'm Mary.

93
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,649
Are you Indian?

94
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:03,758
- We live above. - Above?
- Who is the 'we'?

95
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,398
- Me and daddy, John
- Is he upstairs?

96
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,664
- Daddy will be angry.
- For eating papads?

97
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,997
Our phone is out of order.

98
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:38,019
Stupid man. I said Daddy is
ill yet he wants the car now.

99
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,197
May I be of any help?

100
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,440
Daddy is a car dealer.
He had to deliver a car today.

101
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,042
- But he has sprained his leg
- I can deliver it.

102
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:57,038
What's the point if we live
close and can't help each other?

103
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,541
Tell your Daddy.

104
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:05,054
Just a minute.
Have another papad.

105
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,061
You've been corrupted
so now beware!

106
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:23,374
- How?
- Mary is a Christian.

107
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,534
Therefore Krishna says
to Arjun in the Gita, Beware!

108
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,414
Lord Krishna also
said this in the Gita...

109
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:35,076
Every man on earth is one.

110
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:40,753
- His religion is one...
- I feel you have no religion.

111
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:42,685
You are shameless.

112
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:54,095
Driving here is different than
in India. Drive to the right...

113
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:57,158
- Any mistake in driving?
- No, you're terrific.

114
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,499
I have a proposal for you.

115
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:06,770
There's a car race in 2 days.
I'm sure you'll win first prize

116
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,774
I have neither car nor any
contacts and I'm stone broke.

117
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,175
Don't worry. I'll help.

118
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,596
- Has the pain reduced?
- Somewhat.

119
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,192
Don't worry, you'll be
destroyed. I mean the pain.

120
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:37,198
Just a matter of days.
I've set this alarm.

121
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,203
In this state, for
10 minutes with eyes shut...

122
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:47,209
...in this room and asana
take the teacher's name

123
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,220
The teacher of all teachers.

124
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,223
With eyes shut

125
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:25,857
Ashok has returned.
He's ruined everything!

126
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:35,666
What have you done? Teacher
said to lie for 10 minutes.

127
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,430
- What teacher?
- Your friend, Murli.

128
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:44,936
- I was feeling better.
- But you ruined it.

129
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,269
- Ashok woke me up.
- You put up this obstacle.

130
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:52,273
Obstacle... I put it up?

131
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,283
Shall I get you tea?
Or papads from Hapud?

132
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,293
Krishna says in the Gita,
Arjun, beware.

133
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:13,294
Now Murlidhar can't be wary.

134
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,904
I've marked your route. This is
the starting point of the race.

135
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,304
Here's the map and best of luck.

136
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:25,708
Faster. I must teach this girl
a lesson. She troubles me too much.

137
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,392
- Can you please give me a lift?
- How far?

138
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:53,996
I'll get off anywhere.

139
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,402
Some hoods are on my tail.
My life is in danger.

140
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:03,904
Don't mention me.

141
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,019
I'm not your son.

142
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,423
- Yes.
- Did you see the girl in that car?

143
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:31,432
That car? Her car stalled so
she took a lift with somebody.

144
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:35,936
There...

145
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:57,964
- Why was the old man chasing you?
- Shut up and drive.

146
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,066
Ordering me around.
You sound like a spoilt brat.

147
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,966
I'm a billionaire's daughter.

148
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:09,470
That is why you're so insolent.
Get off my car.

149
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,484
- Please drive...
- Okay.

150
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:33,494
I'm a little scared to
give a lift to a stranger.

151
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:38,169
Suffice for you to know
my name is Veera.

152
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:44,505
- I'm Ashok.
- That's very nice.

153
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,252
"Never have I seen..."

154
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,552
"From where is this flower?"

155
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:37,567
"I'm a lover of spring"

156
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:44,839
"I'm a lover of spring"

157
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,179
"Never have I seen..."

158
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,583
"From where is this flower?"

159
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,584
"I'm a lover of spring"

160
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:11,593
"I'm a lover of spring"

161
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,639
"I don't leave what I like"

162
00:23:57,082 --> 00:24:01,644
"But I never pluck flowers"

163
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:07,119
"I don't leave what I like"

164
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:12,930
"But I never pluck flowers"

165
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,337
"I know delicate buds
like you blush when touched"

166
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:30,680
"My eyes are accustomed
to stop at certain faces"

167
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,675
"They hold my attention"

168
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:41,683
"There's nothing in my heart
I just love to watch beauty"

169
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:48,030
"I'm a lover of spring"

170
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:40,744
"Women wouldn't dress up"

171
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:45,746
"If men didn't ogle at beauty"

172
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,159
"Nobody would appreciate beauty"

173
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:56,757
"If men didn't look at you"

174
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:04,766
"Those who aren't
ogled at feel miserable"

175
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:14,276
"Green with envy when
others are appreciated"

176
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,782
"I want to fix your locks"

177
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,786
"That's what I mean"

178
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,354
- why did you stop the car?
- Slight problem.

179
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:37,358
- What problem?
- A little...

180
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,365
Tell me what the problem is.

181
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,366
- What it is? - Tell me.
- I can't tell you.

182
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:49,711
- I can help you.
- Not in this matter.

183
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:55,979
- What is the matter?
- I want to... go for a leak.

184
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,479
My car!!!

185
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,412
I didn't know you can't pee here

186
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:44,198
The driver of the car that
reaches first wins 5000 francs.

187
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:50,033
This time some Indians as well
as Europeans are participating.

188
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:59,901
Long live Ashok!
Glory to Mother India!

189
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,902
Somebody cheer with me.
They're all depressed.

190
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:10,571
- This is Switzerland, not India
- I'd forgotten.

191
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:16,987
Can a man dare to hold a
girl round her waist in India?

192
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:22,583
- Just once say, you're mine.
- I am Mary.

193
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:26,587
- Say I'm yours.
- I'm yours.

194
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,934
My vision isn't as good.

195
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,264
I must get them checked. Every
car has passed but your son's.

196
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:44,338
I know my son well. One day
he'll be rolling in wealth.

197
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:51,111
Mr. Rai's daughter

198
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,092
- What happened?
- Her car over turned.

199
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:58,619
- It could have been terrible.
- I dropped out of the race.

200
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:02,293
- Else I'd have 5000 francs.
- Forget them.

201
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:07,302
You lose that much gambling
everyday. But my dear is safe.

202
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,632
Don't talk of money. Make her
sit somewhere, buy her coffee...

203
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:23,052
I forbade you to take part
in the race yet you went.

204
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:27,386
Thank god, you're safe.
What if you'd been hurt?

205
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,654
Stop it. What are you doing?

206
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:34,664
How long will you
scold the poor child?

207
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:39,001
She's my only daughter

208
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:43,937
- Scolding her is my prerogative
- We too have a right over her.

209
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,236
I've always considered
her like my daughter.

210
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:52,144
I'm grateful to you and
Vikram for helping her.

211
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:59,419
That was my duty and there's
no gratitude between friends.

212
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:03,689
- Let's not get emotional.
Would you like tea? - No thanks.

213
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:06,088
We must now leave.
Son, let's go.

214
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:22,369
Whatever I say is for your good.

215
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,706
I have nobody but you.

216
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,313
Don't ever repeat this mistake.

217
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:38,218
He's a sly man. He won't
let us get a foothold.

218
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,722
- You're saying that?
- Yes.

219
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:48,730
His only weakness is Veera who
will naturally inherit his wealth.

220
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:52,733
Don't worry. Veera will
be your daughter-in-law.

221
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,742
I'm sure you'll bring
glory to your mother.

222
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:05,411
I'm well by your grace and
hope you too are well...

223
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,252
Is this foreign currency
the reward for the race?

224
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:16,427
- Yes.
- You're a good son.

225
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:21,028
- Wished Mom on my behalf?
- Also wrote you're an ass.

226
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:23,766
- An exemplary brother.
- Live long.

227
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:26,767
Send this as a money order.

228
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,270
I'll have to go to the post office

229
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,934
Going out with perfume?

230
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,385
- Met somebody?
- Going to a party.

231
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:47,526
- Congress or Socialist?
- Party for winning the race.

232
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,794
- Want to come?
- Forget it.

233
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:54,795
Did anyone invite me?

234
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,470
Stupid, there's no invitation.

235
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:04,271
There'll be all kinds of food
and your old boss is organising it.

236
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,815
- Jamunadas of Gurdaspur?
- Think about it.

237
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,812
I'll °/°!

238
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,226
What are you doing there? Come here

239
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:34,311
- This is my daughter, Veera.
- She's your daughter?

240
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,975
- Do you know her?
- He met me at the race.

241
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,314
When you crossed me but I didn't
see you at the winning post.

242
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:46,980
My car over turned or
I'd meet you at the winning post.

243
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:50,817
- Or you'd never win.
- I was lucky to get to start.

244
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:55,322
- What do you mean?
- A girl stole my car.

245
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:59,998
Finally I got the car and the
keys but she stole 200 francs.

246
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:07,335
That's a lie! I mean there
are no thefts in Switzerland.

247
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,339
Right. No girl here would do that.

248
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,940
The girl was Indian.

249
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,349
Don't talk to me.
I'm in a foul mood.

250
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,359
You seem worried. What's wrong?

251
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,384
This is the schmuck.

252
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:02,389
One for me, and
one for my girl friend.

253
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,667
What are you staring at?
I'm C Rai's personal friend.

254
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:11,134
I'll complain that
you're staring at my girl!

255
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:13,401
Sorry sir, I'll get it.

256
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,408
- What's that?
- Powder for revenge.

257
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,411
Spices?

258
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:32,090
Do meet me if you need anything.

259
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,430
Excuse me...

260
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,831
I've made you special
Gurdaspur pudding.

261
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:46,103
The aroma will make
your mouth water.

262
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,845
Eating it will make your eyes water.

263
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:14,962
- Chili in pudding!
- Such a grave error!

264
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,141
Idiot! Take it away!

265
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:31,478
- What's it?
- Total ruin. Chili in pudding!

266
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,221
- What?
- This is Murlidhar's magic

267
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,494
- Hey Murli...
- Murlidhar Chaturvedi of Gurdaspur

268
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,994
You come from the same
village as this chili!

269
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:48,495
My darling, our job is done.

270
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:52,499
Gurdaspur you °/°&!!

271
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:38,666
I've quite comfortable with
Murli but I miss your cooking.

272
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:41,668
I feel like returning at the earliest

273
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,080
Take care of yourself.
Wish sister Kamla on my behalf

274
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:51,018
What an exemplary son.
You're so lucky.

275
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:55,687
- Write to him today itself.
- What do you want me to write?

276
00:41:57,028 --> 00:42:00,293
First of all write that
he mustn't go to races.

277
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:06,193
Ashok sent you Rs. 15000
because he won it in the race.

278
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:10,231
You can't trust cars.
They might over turn or crash.

279
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:14,041
- God forbid...
- What else?

280
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:20,150
And scold him. He's in a
foreign land and all alone...

281
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:27,724
He could need money and...
don't write in an angry tone.

282
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,062
- Don't write any of what I said.
- Then what do I write?

283
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:44,732
Only write that he must return
soon as he finishes studies.

284
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:53,741
It's too many days. I don't
like being without him.

285
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:59,606
This can solve the
world's food problem.

286
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:03,280
This is the first step of my research

287
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:07,619
work with me and your
goal too will approach near.

288
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:11,288
Are you giving me an offer?

289
00:44:11,963 --> 00:44:17,902
Yes. I run a vast business.

290
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:22,628
Which includes scientific research.

291
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:27,975
You'll get every facility
if you work with me.

292
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:29,643
Everything you want.

293
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,642
Precious metals like uranium
are needed for this research.

294
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:37,645
A couple of million is chicken feed

295
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:42,657
And if you succeed
I could earn millions.

296
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:48,064
- If I don't, you'll lose it
- I'll consider it a gamble.

297
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:56,072
- What are you thinking?
- That you're a good businessman.

298
00:44:56,674 --> 00:44:58,665
Business runs in my blood.

299
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,113
He'll be in charge of our
laboratory. Olga is a scientist.

300
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:40,377
She's been here for 2 years.
She'll work with you.

301
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:44,711
- Hello...
- Can she speak Hindi?

302
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,123
She has many Indian friends
therefore she speaks a little.

303
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:52,055
- Glad to meet you.
- Same here.

304
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,221
Let me show you the other rooms.

305
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:07,406
You wanted uranium. Here it is.

306
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:14,343
Now don't ask where it came
from and how much it costs.

307
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:18,146
You're responsible for this
precious item from today.

308
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:21,748
Here's the key and good luck.

309
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:31,429
He humiliated me
I can never forgive him.

310
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:37,173
That scoundrel shouldn't be
forgiven. He's my enemy as well.

311
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:42,111
- One more?
- Pour it.

312
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:55,783
You don't know how much
I love you. I'll kill that man.

313
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:07,796
- Did you call me?
- Yes. Take a seat.

314
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:18,411
I want you to... it's personal
so I shouldn't tell you...

315
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:23,477
- But ill health forces me.
- Please tell me.

316
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:25,812
You seem quite upset.

317
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:31,818
You know Veera is an independent girl

318
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:36,157
But this is the first time
she hasn't come home all night.

319
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:42,838
I called all her friends
but found nothing.

320
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,435
- I don't understand...
- Don't worry sir.

321
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:49,836
She'll be home by evening.

322
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:29,876
"Citizens of the east
got lost in the west"

323
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:36,292
"Good people turned crazy"

324
00:48:37,895 --> 00:48:41,888
"They were good people
but they turned crazy"

325
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:48,331
"Citizens of the east
got lost in the west"

326
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:54,901
"They were good people
but they turned crazy"

327
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:22,930
"If they were in their senses
all I had to say to them was..."

328
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:29,277
"A blush used to be the
jewelry of womanhood"

329
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:35,947
"They left their countries
but should've stayed home"

330
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:45,454
"Those who left home
got lost in the lanes"

331
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:26,994
"They recall nothing
they've forgotten every ritual"

332
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:33,008
"They've forgotten their foes"

333
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:39,745
"They've forgotten Shyam's
flute and Radha's songs"

334
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:49,620
"The waves of the Ganges
got lost in alcohol"

335
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:34,061
"Admittedly this isn't our India"

336
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:40,476
"This country has
people with no identity"

337
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:47,075
"Men with no culture or tongue"

338
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:56,585
"Known people became strangers"

339
00:54:35,385 --> 00:54:37,979
What's the matter?

340
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,119
- Last night...
- Let's talk outside.

341
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:47,795
Yes?

342
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:54,735
- I wasn't conscious. What occurred
- forget it.

343
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:57,396
No, I can't forget.

344
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:01,400
I hurt you but yet
you saved my life.

345
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:07,008
It's not surprising. You
live here, I live there.

346
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:10,816
Each one of us acted
according to our culture.

347
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:17,690
I respect your Dad. Does
he know about last night?

348
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,420
- Will you tell him?
- What's the point?

349
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:26,101
He'll feel sorry and sad
and it won't change you.

350
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:30,434
Some day you'll publicly
exhibit your body in a stupor

351
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,433
Stop it! I came to apologise
and you're insulting me!

352
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:39,173
If you feel a little
embarrassed at last night...

353
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,774
I'll feel a little happy.

354
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:12,472
- Drunk? - I'm never
as sane as I am now.

355
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:16,478
- I've been waiting for you for ages
- For me?

356
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:18,977
Why?

357
00:56:22,492 --> 00:56:26,485
I like you very much.

358
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:35,494
I'm willing to do
anything to convince you.

359
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:41,170
How many times have you uttered
these words to how many men?

360
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:48,507
Just because I grew up here
doesn't mean I have no character

361
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,920
I never told any man
that I loved him.

362
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:58,187
The only man whom I said it
to turned out to be an idiot.

363
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,991
Love for you is a plug that
can be switched on and off.

364
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:11,006
Love is the only thing
that's same all over the world.

365
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:15,875
It's sad that you weren't born in
India or you wouldn't preach love.

366
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:20,539
- What do you mean?
- For us love comes after God.

367
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,042
We worship those we love.

368
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:27,546
The girls here too are the same.

369
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:31,550
- Even today women are considered
goddesses. - Goddesses?

370
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:39,228
- Where will we meet tomorrow?
- Why?

371
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:45,902
I want to know how
I differ from an Indian.

372
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:49,235
You want to know that?
It will take years.

373
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:53,174
- You're coming home tomorrow.
- Me?

374
00:57:55,585 --> 00:58:00,579
If you wont' come, I'll
come drunk to your house.

375
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:05,584
I'll scream so loud that
everyone will gather there.

376
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:10,088
- You don't' have to do this.
- Think about it.

377
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:13,000
I'll be there.

378
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:21,898
- Come with me. - where?
- I have important work! - No.

379
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:26,903
Leave this and come on.

380
00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:39,916
- Whose plane is this?
- Mine.

381
00:58:40,394 --> 00:58:43,921
- Free? - No. It's a
birthday present from Daddy.

382
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:50,927
- Can you fly it?
- I can take you along.

383
00:58:51,405 --> 00:58:56,433
Wow... but why? I don't want to
hand my precious life to you.

384
00:58:56,944 --> 00:58:58,935
Now we'll live and die together.

385
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:07,218
I recall the song, no fear in love
So why should I be afraid?

386
00:59:07,454 --> 00:59:10,946
- Where's the door? - Here.
- Does it fly? - Of course.

387
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:03,059
"One is a lover, the
other is a paramour"

388
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:08,064
"The world is beautiful"

389
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:24,683
"One is a lover, the
other is a paramour"

390
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:29,488
"The world is beautiful"

391
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:23,144
"Everyone remembers Romeo and
Juliet; Shirin and Farhad"

392
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:30,647
"Everyone remembers Romeo and
Juliet; Shirin and Farhad"

393
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,629
"Everyone remembers them"

394
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:45,161
"All stories come from the heart"

395
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:44,223
"Forget about the world
we want nothing from it"

396
01:03:45,232 --> 01:03:49,225
"Forget about the world
we want nothing from it"

397
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:55,233
"Talk about tresses and lips"

398
01:03:55,742 --> 01:04:00,236
"Talk about tresses and lips"

399
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:05,244
"Life is all about the heart"

400
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:12,577
"There are many seasons
but this is the best"

401
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,313
"Youth is short in this long life"

402
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:22,818
"There are many seasons
but this is the best"

403
01:05:23,597 --> 01:05:27,829
"Youth is short in this long life"

404
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:33,329
"Youth is short in this long life"

405
01:05:35,342 --> 01:05:39,073
"Youth too is connected to the heart"

406
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:51,877
I'm expecting guests.
Please come later

407
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:24,910
You're here! I've been
waiting for you for so long!

408
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:27,742
You delayed so much!

409
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:52,275
Papa bought this yesterday
It says a lot about India.

410
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:58,273
But nothing about Indian girls

411
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:05,689
Why are you looking at the floor?
Why don't you speak?

412
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:10,888
- Go and change.
- Why?

413
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:16,758
Cover your legs. My mind...
is spinning out of control.

414
01:08:18,038 --> 01:08:22,031
You're funny. Everyone
tells me, I have great legs.

415
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:26,805
And you... all right.
Excuse me.

416
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:48,323
Now what's the difference?

417
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:54,329
- A lot.
- Still lacking something?

418
01:08:55,008 --> 01:08:58,808
- I'll have to do your mother's
duty. Do you have a sari? - Sari...

419
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,706
"My fair cheeks and silken tresses..."

420
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:35,371
"...Iose their colour to
be flushed by your love"

421
01:09:37,717 --> 01:09:39,844
"My fair cheeks..."

422
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:50,386
"My fair cheeks and silken tresses..."

423
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:58,803
"...Iose their colour to
be flushed by your love"

424
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:32,427
"I looked in your eyes..."

425
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:39,105
"And I couldn't recognise myself'

426
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:44,443
"I became aware of myself'

427
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:52,447
"I looked in your eyes..."

428
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:58,123
"And I couldn't recognise myself'

429
01:11:01,134 --> 01:11:04,900
"I became aware of myself'

430
01:11:07,473 --> 01:11:13,878
"I changed so much
timidity took my breath away"

431
01:12:11,204 --> 01:12:21,045
"The fragrance of nationality
from the foreign flowers"

432
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,951
"You've wielded a magic touch"

433
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:39,992
"The fragrance of nationality
from the foreign flowers"

434
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:47,005
"You've wielded a magic touch"

435
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:55,572
"In a few meetings
I was transformed"

436
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:17,934
Today you must tell me where
you're coming from? Whom you met.

437
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:20,595
One pretty girl.

438
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:23,600
Are you a detective?

439
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:29,604
You're lucky. Many Indian
males are queuing for her.

440
01:13:30,116 --> 01:13:32,607
Meeting a girl doesn't
mean she becomes yours.

441
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:37,612
My principle is the girl who
meets you is yours not others.

442
01:13:38,124 --> 01:13:42,026
- She's not mine. - She'll be
It takes a little time.

443
01:13:42,628 --> 01:13:46,120
Once Krishna said in Gita...
I don't recall what he said...

444
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:48,623
- I know. - What?
- That you're an ass.

445
01:13:49,035 --> 01:13:52,630
Did he really say that? - Yes.
- I might as well get you tea.

446
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:56,631
Did Krishna say I'm an ass?

447
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:13,148
You're drinking since morning.
The 6th bottle at your Dad's hotel

448
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:21,656
- I want revenge from that Indian.
- No sense even after he beat you up?

449
01:14:23,669 --> 01:14:25,660
- That small fry...
- And you're great.

450
01:14:26,672 --> 01:14:29,664
Do you know Ashok is
now Mr. Rai's partner?

451
01:14:30,076 --> 01:14:33,068
He's willing to spend millions on him.

452
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:36,271
Forget about him and
look after yourself.

453
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,194
My heartiest wishes!

454
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:07,710
- Don't I look 100°/° Indian?
- No.

455
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:13,207
What's the missing 1°/°

456
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:16,882
Come close, I'll tell you
Kissing in public...

457
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:23,457
Sorry. Henceforth
I'll do it in private.

458
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:29,724
- In private?
- Yes, all alone.

459
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:06,765
"What does your heart say?"

460
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:11,106
"My heart says..."

461
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:15,770
"We keep walking the roads"

462
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:19,445
"And the destination eludes us"

463
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:32,787
"What does your heart say?"

464
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:37,265
"My heart says..."

465
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:41,796
"We keep walking the roads"

466
01:16:43,142 --> 01:16:46,134
"And the destination eludes us"

467
01:17:50,476 --> 01:17:51,776
"When we near the goal..."

468
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:02,285
"You'll leave me"

469
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:06,881
"I'll miss you when you leave"

470
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:11,556
"I'll miss you when you leave"

471
01:18:17,336 --> 01:18:24,242
"Where will I look for you?
Whom will I ask your whereabouts?"

472
01:18:25,244 --> 01:18:28,907
"We keep walking the paths"

473
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:32,907
"The destination eludes us"

474
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,021
"Sleep will elude me"

475
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:37,312
"You'll forget me"

476
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,483
"I'll miss you when you leave"

477
01:19:52,498 --> 01:19:58,994
"Rather than this misery
of times away from each other..."

478
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:03,668
"We keep walking the paths"

479
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:08,002
"And the destination eludes us"

480
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:55,518
what are you thinking?

481
01:20:58,931 --> 01:21:00,523
Your problems will be solved.

482
01:21:32,965 --> 01:21:34,455
And the police?

483
01:21:49,648 --> 01:21:51,639
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

484
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:56,978
What are you saying?

485
01:21:59,992 --> 01:22:01,983
- What are you doing?
- You stay out of this!

486
01:22:03,996 --> 01:22:08,990
- What's going on? - Go home!
- Daddy, listen to me!

487
01:22:11,003 --> 01:22:12,994
I don't understand what's happening.

488
01:22:28,687 --> 01:22:33,283
- I'm giving you a last chance to
say the truth. - I've never lied.

489
01:22:34,026 --> 01:22:37,689
- I know nothing of the theft.
- This is Olga's testimony.

490
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:41,022
- Read it.
- I don't need to.

491
01:22:42,635 --> 01:22:45,627
Then listen. You and
Olga love each other.

492
01:22:46,038 --> 01:22:51,442
- That's a lie. - You told Olga to
steal the uranium and go to Paris

493
01:22:52,044 --> 01:22:57,038
- You were going to marry her.
- That's... a big lie.

494
01:23:02,054 --> 01:23:03,521
He is lying.

495
01:23:10,062 --> 01:23:12,053
- Job done?
- 100°/°

496
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:18,061
Ashok can't escape. The thorn
in our side has been removed.

497
01:23:22,074 --> 01:23:24,736
The charge sheet is ready.

498
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:29,072
You'll be taken to court
tomorrow. Even now if you...

499
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:34,075
- I said my piece.
- Then rot in prison!

500
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:36,744
Nobody will bail you out!

501
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:38,579
I will.

502
01:23:41,093 --> 01:23:44,494
You can't bail him out.

503
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:50,091
For him, I can sell my
hotel and all I own.

504
01:23:50,603 --> 01:23:53,595
If required, I can
even lay down my life.

505
01:23:54,106 --> 01:23:58,099
- Do you know what he's done?
- Yes but I don't believe it.

506
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:02,113
Because my eyes aren't
shielded by foreign glares.

507
01:24:04,116 --> 01:24:09,110
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Very well. Chunidas of Jalandhar

508
01:24:10,122 --> 01:24:13,785
You earned millions so
you're C. Rai? Look at me.

509
01:24:14,126 --> 01:24:19,723
I'm Jamunadas. I consider it
my duty to help a countryman.

510
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,634
Yes, I fired her.

511
01:24:33,145 --> 01:24:36,137
I didn't send her to prison
because it wasn't her fault.

512
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:41,142
- She was dancing to Ashok's tune
- No, I don't believe it.

513
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:47,922
That's the truth. Trusting
him, I spent much money on him.

514
01:24:49,161 --> 01:24:51,561
I never thought he'd be so mean.

515
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:11,775
- Don't misunderstand me.
- I just read Olga's statement.

516
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:15,176
There's no question of
misunderstanding you.

517
01:25:16,522 --> 01:25:19,184
Because now I know
the truth about you.

518
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:52,622
Have you brought my
money and air ticket?

519
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:03,224
I have your money and air ticket.

520
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:20,248
Enough. Leave the rest to me.

521
01:26:21,253 --> 01:26:25,917
- You dog!!
- Stop it before I raise my hand!

522
01:26:26,258 --> 01:26:31,252
Shut up, scoundrel! You and
your mother called me Jumbo

523
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,990
Step son, see the
speed of the jumbo jet.

524
01:26:43,275 --> 01:26:44,936
I say, stop it!

525
01:26:50,282 --> 01:26:53,945
Tell me, why you framed Ashok!

526
01:26:54,286 --> 01:26:57,687
- I say, speak!
- Okay...

527
01:27:02,694 --> 01:27:04,286
Is Mr. C. Rai in?

528
01:27:16,308 --> 01:27:20,301
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's a slap on your face.

529
01:27:21,814 --> 01:27:25,716
He is the real culprit and
you had poor Ashok arrested

530
01:27:26,318 --> 01:27:29,651
What are you saying?
Vikram is your son.

531
01:27:31,323 --> 01:27:34,815
I'd have killed him
if he was my son.

532
01:27:35,327 --> 01:27:38,319
You rogue! Tell him what you've done!

533
01:27:38,831 --> 01:27:40,822
So that he knows the truth!

534
01:27:57,349 --> 01:28:02,013
I was helpless.

535
01:28:02,354 --> 01:28:06,347
I needed the cash. Forgive me.

536
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:09,350
Please forgive me.

537
01:28:16,368 --> 01:28:19,030
We've done a terrible
wrong driven by haste.

538
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:25,776
- How will I face Ashok?
- That's what I'm thinking.

539
01:28:43,996 --> 01:28:49,525
- I made a mistake.
- But what's the outcome?

540
01:28:50,402 --> 01:28:55,897
My career is at an end. My mother
who lives for me will die alive!

541
01:28:57,743 --> 01:29:01,076
You accused me of theft.

542
01:29:02,414 --> 01:29:04,882
Why not? You're wealthy.

543
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:07,408
You can brand anyone a thief.

544
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:13,915
Anyone can make a mistake.
I had no idea...

545
01:29:14,426 --> 01:29:18,157
Vikram and Olga conspired
to steal the uranium.

546
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:21,424
Vikram alone. Olga is innocent.

547
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:27,830
She framed you by giving
a false statement and you...

548
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:32,843
She was helpless. You're
probably not aware she's married.

549
01:29:33,845 --> 01:29:36,780
She has a little child being
raised by someone in France.

550
01:29:37,449 --> 01:29:41,442
Her husband suspected of being
a spy, is in jail in Germany.

551
01:29:42,454 --> 01:29:44,445
Olga heard it a few days ago.

552
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:48,954
Olga needed a million francs
to save her husband's life.

553
01:29:50,195 --> 01:29:52,459
She did this for her husband.

554
01:29:58,937 --> 01:30:02,202
But why didn't she tell me?

555
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:08,475
If she'd tell you, would
you give her a million francs?

556
01:30:13,485 --> 01:30:17,478
I came to request you to
forgive Olga and not fire her.

557
01:30:24,496 --> 01:30:29,490
I can forgive Olga but first...

558
01:30:31,503 --> 01:30:32,993
you must forgive me.

559
01:30:35,507 --> 01:30:38,499
- On one condition.
- How much money do you want?

560
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,503
There you go speaking
the language of wealth.

561
01:30:43,515 --> 01:30:45,915
I expected humanity from you.

562
01:30:46,518 --> 01:30:50,181
- Meaning? - Help Olga
get her child and husband back

563
01:30:51,189 --> 01:30:52,918
Build a broken home.

564
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:58,189
This would be the best
earning of your life.

565
01:30:59,531 --> 01:31:01,522
All right and...

566
01:31:17,649 --> 01:31:22,916
I'm ashamed at the way
Daddy treated you.

567
01:31:25,657 --> 01:31:30,651
- I have no complaints.
- Won't you forgive me?

568
01:31:32,664 --> 01:31:35,929
- For what?
- For misunderstanding you.

569
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:38,659
I can't forgive you.

570
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:52,107
I know I've been unfair but
you can't leave till I'm forgiven.

571
01:31:53,685 --> 01:31:56,677
- Who will stop me?
- My love.

572
01:31:57,689 --> 01:32:02,956
My penance. You led
me to a new path.

573
01:32:04,696 --> 01:32:07,028
Will you leave my side
before reaching the destination?

574
01:32:11,703 --> 01:32:19,701
- Forgive me. - Next time
never misunderstand me.

575
01:32:20,712 --> 01:32:23,203
- That will never happen.
- Sure?

576
01:32:37,129 --> 01:32:40,724
I'll pay Jamunadas
for humiliating me...

577
01:32:41,733 --> 01:32:45,396
Don't say a word.
My blood is boiling.

578
01:32:45,737 --> 01:32:47,329
Let Jumbo get back...

579
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:55,077
- I'm back.
- You raised your hand on Vicky?

580
01:32:56,248 --> 01:33:01,743
I should have used my shoe
because that's what he deserves.

581
01:33:02,754 --> 01:33:04,483
I want to know why you hit him

582
01:33:06,324 --> 01:33:10,420
Good work, step son. You carried
tales to create a rift at home.

583
01:33:10,762 --> 01:33:14,254
- But didn't tell your deeds.
- Even if a young son errs...

584
01:33:14,766 --> 01:33:17,360
should you hit him?
What if he was your own son?

585
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:21,432
I'd have shot him!
Thank God I reached in time

586
01:33:22,374 --> 01:33:26,276
Else your darling son would
have been arrested for murder.

587
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:32,773
Murder... what did you do?

588
01:33:34,452 --> 01:33:39,788
- What did you do?
- Ask me. He won't tell.

589
01:33:40,792 --> 01:33:45,456
He forced an English girl to
commit theft in Rai's company.

590
01:33:45,797 --> 01:33:51,133
And Ashok got blamed. Instead of
paying her he wanted to kill her!

591
01:33:53,805 --> 01:33:58,071
- Is this true? - The plan
was to acquire millions.

592
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,246
- It flopped.
- But why didn't you tell me?

593
01:34:04,249 --> 01:34:07,218
You want wealth from any source.

594
01:34:09,154 --> 01:34:13,818
- Even by killing somebody?
- Sure if the amount is large.

595
01:34:14,226 --> 01:34:15,818
Shameless!

596
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:21,822
All of a sudden where
did you find decency?

597
01:34:22,834 --> 01:34:24,495
What did you say?

598
01:34:27,839 --> 01:34:30,307
I am what I am because of you.

599
01:34:35,513 --> 01:34:38,846
You always made me dance like a puppet

600
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:46,347
You taught me to drink alcohol.
You made me a habitual gambler!

601
01:34:46,858 --> 01:34:50,521
The plan to trap Veera and
acquire her father's wealth...

602
01:34:51,863 --> 01:34:53,455
You should have slapped yourself

603
01:34:53,865 --> 01:34:56,459
You were neither a
good wife nor mother.

604
01:34:56,868 --> 01:35:00,463
You married this man for wealth
and repeatedly told me...

605
01:35:01,873 --> 01:35:04,535
Don't annoy Jumbo.
He's our cheque book!

606
01:35:05,877 --> 01:35:08,368
He is lying!

607
01:35:24,896 --> 01:35:27,160
Shameless boy! What have you done?

608
01:35:27,565 --> 01:35:31,626
His eyes are open now.
We have no relation left.

609
01:35:32,904 --> 01:35:36,567
I'll tread the same path
that you laid out for me.

610
01:35:37,242 --> 01:35:41,235
The goal lies before me
Wealth will be at my feet.

611
01:35:52,924 --> 01:35:54,915
The million francs you need.

612
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:57,918
- Where did you get it?
- From Mr. C Rai.

613
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:04,198
I know what you're thinking.
Some people want to buy everything

614
01:36:04,936 --> 01:36:06,335
Keep it.

615
01:36:07,939 --> 01:36:11,534
I cheated you, had you arrested...

616
01:36:12,277 --> 01:36:14,939
What you did was in a
state of helplessness.

617
01:36:15,947 --> 01:36:18,211
And I did my duty.

618
01:36:19,284 --> 01:36:22,617
- I don't know how to thank you.
- There's no need.

619
01:36:23,955 --> 01:36:28,949
Save your husband, meet your child
and build your broken home.

620
01:37:04,996 --> 01:37:08,397
Soon, all Europe will
be talking about us.

621
01:37:14,406 --> 01:37:18,399
Did you tell him why
he's been called here? - No.

622
01:37:20,011 --> 01:37:22,002
You tell him.

623
01:37:27,685 --> 01:37:31,018
- What's the matter?
- Yesterday Veera told me...

624
01:37:32,023 --> 01:37:34,014
that she loves you.

625
01:37:40,031 --> 01:37:43,023
Even I like you. Sit down.

626
01:37:47,038 --> 01:37:50,030
I want both of you
to get married soon.

627
01:37:58,049 --> 01:38:06,047
Then my business,
inheritance, wealth...

628
01:38:07,459 --> 01:38:12,055
and my daughter will be yours.

629
01:38:13,064 --> 01:38:15,055
Now do you believe in destiny?

630
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:21,337
But there's one condition.

631
01:38:23,074 --> 01:38:24,473
Yes?

632
01:38:26,077 --> 01:38:27,738
You won't return to India.

633
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:36,076
- That's not possible.
- Why? You can settle here.

634
01:38:38,089 --> 01:38:40,080
Talent is wasted in India.

635
01:38:41,092 --> 01:38:43,754
There are many chances and scope
for an intelligent man here

636
01:38:46,764 --> 01:38:51,565
I'm my mother's only child. She
sent me here with great difficulty.

637
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:56,431
She's all alone there
waiting for me to return.

638
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:00,771
We'll send something for her expenses

639
01:39:03,114 --> 01:39:05,105
Like my idea?

640
01:39:06,117 --> 01:39:13,114
Everything is a deal for you but I
never imagined you'd trade mom's hopes

641
01:39:14,726 --> 01:39:18,127
You are wrong.
You are childish.

642
01:39:19,631 --> 01:39:25,627
I want you to be here for
your future and career.

643
01:39:26,137 --> 01:39:29,800
Meaning I must leave
my other mother too.

644
01:39:31,142 --> 01:39:34,737
- Second mother?
- Man has 2 mothers.

645
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,542
One who gives him birth.

646
01:39:40,151 --> 01:39:43,552
The other is the land
where he takes birth!

647
01:39:46,157 --> 01:39:50,150
Unfortunately I too was
born in the same place.

648
01:39:51,162 --> 01:39:54,563
As long as I was there,
I craved for every penny.

649
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,893
But here, I'm a millionaire.

650
01:39:59,771 --> 01:40:05,835
Many doctors, scientists,
engineers work abroad.

651
01:40:06,177 --> 01:40:08,839
They're doing quite well.
Are they mad?

652
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,512
No, they're all like you.

653
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:16,847
They place their own success
above their nation's.

654
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:21,181
I appreciate your patriotism

655
01:40:22,594 --> 01:40:27,190
But it can't eradicate your
country's poverty and hunger.

656
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:32,192
You're a pearl and you
want to fall in garbage

657
01:40:33,471 --> 01:40:35,666
A pearl remains precious
even when it falls in dung.

658
01:40:36,207 --> 01:40:38,869
But dirt remains dirt
even in the sky!

659
01:40:40,211 --> 01:40:45,205
In 10 years do you know how many
flowers bloomed in my country's dung?

660
01:40:46,217 --> 01:40:51,211
Hundreds of doctors, scientists
are working for the nation's future.

661
01:40:52,223 --> 01:40:58,219
The day isn't far when Europe bows
to India to learn about peace, love

662
01:41:01,232 --> 01:41:08,661
- My time is precious.
- Sorry to waste your time.

663
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:12,509
In this time, you could've
earned 10 or 20 crores.

664
01:41:14,245 --> 01:41:18,238
You're welcome to this wealth,
these luxuries, this palace!

665
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,717
Glory to India!

666
01:41:29,927 --> 01:41:32,259
Let him go. He's foolish.

667
01:41:33,264 --> 01:41:35,528
- I gave him such a good offer...
- But he rejected it.

668
01:41:36,267 --> 01:41:39,668
I am very happy.

669
01:41:40,938 --> 01:41:44,931
You always taught me
wealth is most important.

670
01:41:46,678 --> 01:41:50,739
But after loving Ashok, I
found there's something greater.

671
01:41:51,282 --> 01:41:52,874
And that is love.

672
01:41:53,685 --> 01:41:58,281
When Ashok rejected everything
suddenly I understood...

673
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:04,284
There's something higher than
love and that is his principle.

674
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:20,033
I've never accepted defeat.

675
01:42:21,312 --> 01:42:23,303
I've always got what I wanted.

676
01:42:27,318 --> 01:42:30,651
Drive fast!

677
01:42:44,335 --> 01:42:46,326
Daddy! Save me!

678
01:42:58,349 --> 01:43:03,685
Send 20000 francs with
Ashok at the given address.

679
01:43:04,622 --> 01:43:10,356
If you act smart or
try to inform the police...

680
01:43:11,362 --> 01:43:14,354
You alone will be responsible
for your daughter's death.

681
01:43:17,368 --> 01:43:18,960
There's very little time.
Give me the bag.

682
01:43:22,373 --> 01:43:24,967
I'm forced to take your help.

683
01:43:25,376 --> 01:43:27,367
I don't take obligations for free.

684
01:43:30,381 --> 01:43:35,375
If I succeed in bringing Veera
back alive, you can repay me.

685
01:43:45,163 --> 01:43:50,157
Ashok has reached. Kill him
and bring me the bag.

686
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:53,660
Be careful.

687
01:47:16,774 --> 01:47:19,038
This is the game of destiny.

688
01:47:20,644 --> 01:47:24,842
The most beautiful girl in
Switzerland and 2 million francs.

689
01:47:25,383 --> 01:47:29,376
- Now both belong to me.
- I'll kill you!

690
01:47:38,396 --> 01:47:41,888
- But I hate you!
- I'm in no hurry.

691
01:47:43,401 --> 01:47:47,394
Gradually I'll teach you to love me

692
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:05,412
You can't touch these francs.

693
01:48:08,426 --> 01:48:11,418
Give me this bag.
Don't you hear me?

694
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:15,422
Let go of my arm! Leave!

695
01:48:25,443 --> 01:48:31,439
- You? - Yes. No power on
earth can stop a true lover.

696
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:35,442
I didn't know you had a
hand in this filthy conspiracy.

697
01:48:36,454 --> 01:48:40,117
How dare you come here!
Where is Mac?

698
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:45,455
Mac tried hard to stop me but
your crocodiles were starving.

699
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:05,532
A lover can't bear to
watch her admirer die.

700
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,541
These are merely 300 volts.

701
01:50:15,553 --> 01:50:19,148
It will increase to 500
if you don't agree.

702
01:50:19,557 --> 01:50:22,549
Then a 1000 and then 2000.

703
01:50:27,565 --> 01:50:31,057
- I want to hear your decision.
- No way.

704
01:50:31,569 --> 01:50:33,560
- Never!
- Fair enough.

705
01:51:39,303 --> 01:51:40,634
Leave me!

706
01:52:53,110 --> 01:52:59,709
Take the plane down. If you don't
we'll crash and 3 corpses will fall.

707
01:53:00,718 --> 01:53:02,709
Bring the plane down!

708
01:53:53,771 --> 01:53:54,851
Leave me!

709
02:00:12,649 --> 02:00:14,139
Rascal! Confess!

710
02:00:55,192 --> 02:00:59,856
- I can never forget you.
- May you live long.

711
02:01:21,218 --> 02:01:24,210
- Going back to India?
- Yes.

712
02:01:25,222 --> 02:01:29,215
- I'm coming with you.
- To India? - Yes.

713
02:01:30,227 --> 02:01:32,218
I'm taking something that's yours

714
02:01:56,253 --> 02:02:00,713
"One is a lover,
the other a paramour"

715
02:02:01,258 --> 02:02:06,252
"The world seems beautiful"
