1
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,019
Today I felt that you will be caught,

2
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,200
Rather I will lose you...
From who?

3
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,296
From Roma?

4
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,470
That disc what you were...
That's fake

5
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,701
It was nothing in that disc,

6
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,335
Now I am the King of Asian Underworld

7
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,450
It's been 5 years and I (DON)

8
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,054
Is the King of Asian Drug Market,

9
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,454
My next step is Europe

10
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,733
European Cartel knows that I can sell
the drugs in cheap prices

11
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,167
If I will set up my business in Europe

12
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,973
so they will be finished

13
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,888
It's Jimmy
This Cartel's Boss

14
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,020
He called all of them here so they
forget their own enimty

15
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,393
and they can decide my death

16
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,606
I found out about this meeting so late

17
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,592
Jarawan is saying that thanks for
coming back to his door

18
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't came here to take Jarawan's
door but my consignment

19
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,435
There is your consignment

20
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,171
Now I will have to drive this
boat myself

21
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,775
You don't need to go anywhere

22
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,813
Reason of this hospitality

23
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,287
If we have to sell our stuff in Europe

24
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,783
So your death is our ticket of Europe

25
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,661
And he must be the ticket collector

26
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,526
Any last wish?

27
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,363
In Bangkok
Which is the most Italian Restaurant?

28
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,797
What do you mean?
I was thinking...

29
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,967
...that after finishing you people

30
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,608
I should take Italian dinner tonight

31
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,314
Is the the file what I have demand?
Yes!

32
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,188
What's your plan for tonight?
No plan why?

33
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,632
It's your birthday

34
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,762
I thought we should celebrate it

35
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,863
My birthday?

36
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,176
I know

37
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,139
Today is my birthday

38
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:45,909
Sit!

39
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,253
Do you know since when I am
in this department

40
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,357
37!

41
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,093
And in these 37 years I have solved
136 cases

42
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,226
I have worked with brave and
intelligent officers

43
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,235
But I will miss you most of them

44
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,812
I wanted to tell you by myself

45
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,799
Escort me to car

46
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,031
But you can change your plan

47
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,996
No I don't want to change it

48
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,432
And Don?

49
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,900
Yes He is the only one whom
I couldn't caught

50
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,008
Now he is your responsibility

51
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,065
I am very happy to see you too
my Wild Cat

52
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,638
Why everyone is so angry?

53
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,250
Take all charges back against me

54
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,916
Here in Malaysia and in all
those countries

55
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,082
where you have warrant against me

56
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,061
Every police department is looking
for you in the world

57
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,357
So who I will talk to?
Really?

58
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,298
My mom would be so happy
to hear about that,

59
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,169
Happy!

60
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,004
She would shoot you from her
own hands

61
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,468
Mr. Malik you didn't know my mom

62
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,983
Don! What you are asking that's
impossible

63
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,682
Perhaps I could save you from
death penality that's all

64
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,391
If you want the proof of all those
names of my clients, suppliers and

65
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,093
involved persons in this business

66
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,966
So your offer is so small

67
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,296
Do something about that

68
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,806
If you won't co-operate with us

69
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,213
then notjustjail but you will
get death sentence

70
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,218
Everyone have to die

71
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,450
and perhaps at this time

72
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,390
It's good for me to go Jail

73
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,353
I have been waiting for this day

74
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,351
How do you feeling here?

75
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:16,891
In this jail

76
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,432
I am just unhappy with the
color of this uniform

77
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,433
But you don't looks happy

78
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,300
What's the matter?

79
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,642
That good man is suddenly born
inside you

80
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:34,905
Why you are acting like that?

81
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,574
In our business when...

82
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,209
...others have benefit with your death
more than your life

83
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,983
then you should understand that
it's time to move on

84
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,955
I thought I should do some noble job
before death

85
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,686
But you people didn't gave me a
chance to reform myself

86
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,563
If we would have given you

87
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,694
then you would truly give us all
that information

88
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,407
I have already lied you once

89
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,237
I didn't felt good

90
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,184
I wanted to see you behind the
jail once

91
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:17,553
Today I have seen it

92
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,987
If you will spare me alive so that
will be biggest mistake of your life

93
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,909
Shower # 14 pipe is not working

94
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,119
You are still angry

95
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,706
I came here to make friendship
with you

96
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,079
Forget it what happened
What should I forget?

97
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,314
That I am in this cage from last 5
years because of you

98
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,678
You are here for your attitude

99
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,717
You can't change yourself with time

100
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,704
If you can change yourself so what
are you doing here

101
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,939
I came here for you

102
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,601
with an offer
Really?

103
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,576
I also have an offer

104
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,811
Why should I chop your in pieces and
give them to dogs

105
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,787
that won't be good for both
of us

106
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,681
that will be good only for dogs

107
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,221
and I don't like dogs

108
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,490
I have got death sentence

109
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,295
You kill me today

110
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,259
or after 2 weeks law shall
finish me

111
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,861
matter is same

112
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,766
Think about it

113
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,470
A person could surrender himself
anywhere in the world

114
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,744
why did he chose this country where
he knew...

115
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,777
...that his enemy is ready to
kill him

116
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,346
I have come to release you
from this cage

117
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,252
and what you want in return?

118
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,316
I will tell you on time
No! No! No!

119
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,759
You will tell me right now

120
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,796
At this time you just think

121
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,291
that rather you want to get out
from this place or not

122
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,299
If this is your new move...
There is not move...

123
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,873
What will I have to do?

124
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,675
After 2 days...

125
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,413
...Kitchen Grossery will be
deliver here

126
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,068
Can you see that?

127
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,511
I want that as soon as possible

128
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,163
Now what?

129
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,996
Now wait till saturday

130
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,200
What will happen on saturday

131
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,003
My lawyer is coming to meet me

132
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,111
Any other question?

133
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,482
One more question
Can I ask you?

134
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,615
No!
Have you got your answer?

135
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,905
We have to move tonight

136
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,400
I am not disturbing you here

137
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,547
Who is he?

138
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,683
My brother Ramesh

139
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,188
Brother!

140
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,226
Where is he?

141
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,215
Roma do you remember that you
told me

142
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,050
till Don couldn't get caught you don't
want to think something else

143
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,222
I do...

144
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,858
So the situation is like...

145
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,738
Your phone is ringing again

146
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,878
When?

147
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,564
But if you will steal those plates

148
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,164
then they will easily make new plates

149
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,766
It's not a big deal

150
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,838
but to print new notes

151
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,037
old notes doesn't become useless

152
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,181
And they will be tired to replace
all old notes

153
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,944
How do I say how long?

154
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,930
Yes!
Roma!

155
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,696
I have just talk to German Interpol

156
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,968
Don and Vardhan has been seen
in Zurich

157
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,631
Don and Vardhan?

158
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,041
What they both are doing together?

159
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,841
We must have to know it

160
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,442
In which car they were travelling
police has found that car in Berlin

161
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,607
You just go over there

162
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,516
I have talked to Director of Intelligence

163
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,415
He is gonna attend some Charity
Fund Raiser tomorrow

164
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,315
He will meet you there

165
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,159
What happen?

166
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,227
That man...

167
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,560
Why does I feel that I know him?

168
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,129
If he would not have that face then...

169
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,869
Congratulations for new phone

170
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,768
There is a video clip in this phone's
inbox who will entertain you

171
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,074
My advice is that you should
watch it alone otherwise...

172
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,273
you will be defammed

173
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,422
I have fullfilled my promise

174
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,029
now it's your turn

175
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,435
If once Mr. Verdan will become
president

176
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,436
then it will be difficult to reach him

177
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,902
Don't worry
Job will be done

178
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,270
I have told you that you will
like it

179
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,973
Except this clip I have a
bank document

180
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,815
Document of bank trasferring details of
million dollars in Singhania's account

181
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,184
I don't know any...
Signed by you...

182
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,393
Now your luck is good that I
am good from the heart

183
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,632
What I want that's not a big deal
for you

184
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,095
A black car is parked outside

185
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,400
You have two minutes...

186
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,470
Who are you?

187
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:35,646
Don?

188
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,058
Do you know what you are asking for?
Yes!

189
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,205
Only that information what will help me
to reach in D.Z. B's underground vault

190
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,438
Listen if you need money...

191
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,834
then just your name your amount and
you will get it

192
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,239
but what you are asking
that's impossible

193
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,210
Do you and Cole want to spend your

194
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,339
rest of your life in Jail?

195
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,954
What I need that's detail is
available in that phone

196
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,288
I see you my wild cat.

197
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:00,935
Don if I will be caught with you

198
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,733
Not only is it difficult to catch Don

199
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,434
It's impossible

200
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,598
It means that man was with Don

201
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:12,000
he dropped down between here

202
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,843
It's possible somebody has seen
him getting down from the car

203
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,579
It's possible...

204
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:21,773
I will talk to my man

205
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,519
If there is any witness

206
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,461
Dewan you will be happy that
I am very punctual

207
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,458
What did you decide?

208
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,525
I am ready to give you
that information

209
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,566
Tomorrow 8 o' clock at
Berlin Catherial

210
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:51,439
Now what?

211
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,345
Now you will do the same what
he wants...

212
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:54,912
What do you mean?

213
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,182
I can't give him that information

214
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,454
So give him fake

215
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,256
Till Don will find out about
this thing

216
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,322
he will be dead

217
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,545
From your left a bus is coming
towards you

218
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,280
That bus will stop on front
of you

219
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,820
Come to that's upper deck

220
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,687
These discs have all those things
what you wanted

221
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,663
Currency Centre's blue prints,
Security Protocols...

222
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,195
Buildins all access passkeys and
everything

223
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,494
And that safe which has plates

224
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,604
Safe is inside underground vault

225
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,939
you can open it with a passkey

226
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,870
what Dr. Shnider have it

227
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,479
Anything else?

228
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,843
Except the passkey to open the safe

229
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:42,050
you will need Dr. Schnider's finger
prints and voice match

230
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,578
You keep this phone

231
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,841
a room is booked in hotel for you

232
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,713
Wait for my next call

233
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,847
But that tape and document what
you supposed to give me

234
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,553
You will get everything what
you meant for

235
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,274
Jabbar!

236
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,007
Don talks to his friend or not

237
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,045
but he is always aware about
his enemies

238
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,394
Somebody is following you.

239
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,399
You want it
No!

240
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,969
I want to finish you

241
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,042
that will be problem

242
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,684
To keep myself alive suits me

243
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,350
I think...

244
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,717
you will have to change your plan

245
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,054
You join me

246
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,899
As much money Dewan gave you
to kill me

247
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:55,731
Think about it

248
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,163
I don't want to

249
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:02,974
any pressure on you

250
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,191
A man has been identified don's car
near the station

251
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,788
He has seen the man's face getting
down from the car

252
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,655
Where is that man?
With Sketch Aritst...

253
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,990
Inform me when the sketch is over

254
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,423
You made a big mistake to involve
Jabbar in our plan

255
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,966
Did you forget that he wants
to kill you

256
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:06,901
Don's enemy should always remember that
Don never forgets anything

257
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,174
And if you are talking about
my mistake

258
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:14,776
This Jabbar will be our ticket to
come out from the D.C. P

259
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,216
Because that plan we have made to
escape from that building

260
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,887
for it's success

261
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:26,685
we will have to sacrify Jabbar and
his men

262
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,651
Dewan you made a mistake to give
me blank disc I can forgive that

263
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,488
but you made arrangement to kill
me along with that

264
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,525
what should I assume it?

265
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,073
Look I made a big mistake
I will give whatever you want

266
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,170
Where is that information

267
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,704
It's here in room

268
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:20,946
Open the room

269
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,100
You...
Give him information

270
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,388
Because of this mistake you will
have to do one more job for me

271
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:10,732
So the world best security system is
installed in this building

272
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:14,269
Obviously it's not a breaking news

273
01:07:14,578 --> 01:07:17,012
Can you control their computers
or not

274
01:07:18,048 --> 01:07:21,245
Now you have faith in me so
it's my duty

275
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:26,513
Except the underground vault I
can control everything

276
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:28,051
Why not Vault?

277
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,618
Because vault is not linked
with master computer

278
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:34,021
It's all controls in that room

279
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:38,990
In fact it's power is seperated
from the building power

280
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:46,532
We will handle the vault

281
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,381
I don't want to demoralise anyone

282
01:07:55,786 --> 01:07:57,481
but it's necessary that we
shall understand

283
01:07:58,422 --> 01:08:00,947
that how difficult this job is?

284
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:07,421
After entering D.C. P there is
a security check point

285
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:10,962
At this point

286
01:08:11,235 --> 01:08:13,135
and in lobby there are CCTV cameras

287
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:17,396
whom D.C. P security guards are
monitoring from survillance room

288
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:22,908
There is a door to enter in vault
from ground level

289
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,610
Now this door can be control
from the password

290
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:28,174
there are stairs inside who leads
the underground level

291
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:31,947
There is a metal gate and it's another
side 2 armed guards

292
01:08:32,122 --> 01:08:33,350
are present everytime

293
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:37,018
If you move without claiming
your life insurance

294
01:08:37,995 --> 01:08:40,361
then after that there is a first
door of printing chamber

295
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:43,064
and those security guards should
have it's keys

296
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,831
Problem!
Next door of main vault

297
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,728
This entire chamber is made
with solid steel

298
01:08:50,307 --> 01:08:51,899
Now the emergency procedure is

299
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:54,803
that lock that door and break
it's all controls

300
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:58,212
It will be impossible to open
it from the normal way

301
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,015
Fine we will blow that door
from explosive

302
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:08,524
If you will try to open from
any other way

303
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:10,853
two things will happen
First thing!

304
01:09:11,528 --> 01:09:14,019
In this chamber chemical gas will
be release automatically

305
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:16,355
now this gas is not lethal but

306
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,692
it could keep a man faint for
12 hours

307
01:09:19,703 --> 01:09:20,795
Another thing?

308
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:23,535
There is a passage between the
door and safe

309
01:09:23,674 --> 01:09:24,800
what is 20 feet long

310
01:09:25,108 --> 01:09:28,043
Now there is a security system is
installed in this passage

311
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:30,346
what will be activate from
minor pressure

312
01:09:31,548 --> 01:09:33,516
If this system will be activate then
what will happen

313
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:38,586
If I would be on your place then

314
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:41,152
I wouldn't mistake to breathe on that

315
01:13:23,747 --> 01:13:25,476
What's the plan to come
out from D.C. P?

316
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:31,816
It's the service exit in basement

317
01:13:32,422 --> 01:13:35,186
Aaisha will wait for us in police van

318
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:39,861
We will escape in that police van

319
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:54,067
Do you have another good plan?

320
01:13:57,814 --> 01:13:58,337
No!

321
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:08,814
You will have to rely on my plan

322
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:36,316
Tomorrow on 3 o' clock

323
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:39,845
at Paul Lauwa House Beach

324
01:14:43,727 --> 01:14:44,921
Come on time

325
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:52,394
Now

326
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:55,532
nobody can stop me

327
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,642
I know Don very well

328
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:10,383
He can kill you, me or anyone
for his benefit

329
01:15:16,226 --> 01:15:18,194
So what are you doing with him?

330
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:19,719
Me?

331
01:15:21,331 --> 01:15:22,764
I just wanted to know his plan

332
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:26,730
I wouldn't make the same mistake
to trust on him

333
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:30,598
You shouldn't do it

334
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:32,866
Why?

335
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:38,773
Because as per Don's exit plan

336
01:15:42,185 --> 01:15:43,777
you won't come out alive from there

337
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:50,451
Even Don won't come out alive
from here...

338
01:15:53,063 --> 01:15:53,825
Not now!

339
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:56,160
After we will get the plates,

340
01:15:57,967 --> 01:15:59,992
We must admit that Don's plan
is great

341
01:16:01,938 --> 01:16:04,372
but once we got those plates

342
01:16:05,642 --> 01:16:06,370
Think!

343
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:09,739
Rain of money

344
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:13,713
And Don?

345
01:16:15,018 --> 01:16:18,613
Until police will find his deadbody
somewhere in that building

346
01:16:20,323 --> 01:16:23,520
We would have escape from that
passage what he told us

347
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,342
It's true that his face is familiar
to Mr. Dewan

348
01:16:44,781 --> 01:16:46,248
but that's also true that

349
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:49,140
we are believing on one
man's memory

350
01:16:51,254 --> 01:16:52,812
But I believe that is right

351
01:16:56,993 --> 01:16:58,585
Fix an appointment with him

352
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:09,564
Remember I told you that I will
never forget your favours

353
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,973
But still you trusted on me

354
01:37:37,532 --> 01:37:40,433
So you were about to left me
here to die

355
01:37:41,036 --> 01:37:42,435
Somebody will have to die

356
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,104
but not me

357
01:37:46,308 --> 01:37:47,138
you!

358
01:37:49,878 --> 01:37:51,470
Jabbar! First think about it

359
01:37:52,147 --> 01:37:55,548
After killing me how would you
escape from this building

360
01:37:59,321 --> 01:38:01,653
Nor any service exit in this
building's basement

361
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:04,585
Neither Aaisha is waiting for
us in police van

362
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:09,788
I didn't made any escape plan
for you

363
01:38:17,072 --> 01:38:18,266
He is lying

364
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,307
If there was not any escape plan so
how he would escape from here

365
01:38:24,646 --> 01:38:26,580
Perhaps you didn't listen to me
very carefully

366
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:32,753
I didn't made any plan for you two

367
01:38:35,524 --> 01:38:37,583
But how would you escape
from us

368
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:40,160
Remember Sameer told...

369
01:38:40,696 --> 01:38:43,358
that he can't control this
vault's power

370
01:38:46,068 --> 01:38:47,296
He was lying...

371
01:39:30,979 --> 01:39:32,947
Now we will meet outside
Switch it off!

372
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:13,893
Back off your hands

373
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:23,936
Did you feel good?

374
01:43:25,513 --> 01:43:26,502
So get habbited

375
01:43:33,955 --> 01:43:35,388
Where are your other partners?

376
01:43:36,224 --> 01:43:37,213
If you want then

377
01:43:37,692 --> 01:43:38,681
you can check my pockets

378
01:43:39,928 --> 01:43:40,724
Where are they?

379
01:43:41,997 --> 01:43:43,191
They are not my partners

380
01:43:43,698 --> 01:43:44,665
they were

381
01:43:45,266 --> 01:43:47,325
What do you mean?
I mean...

382
01:43:47,936 --> 01:43:48,630
...now they

383
01:43:49,904 --> 01:43:51,166
follow Verdhan's orders

384
01:43:51,573 --> 01:43:52,198
Not mine

385
01:43:55,243 --> 01:43:56,972
What?
Verdhan is in building

386
01:43:57,645 --> 01:43:59,374
Verdhan, Abdul Jabbar and
his men

387
01:44:01,016 --> 01:44:02,881
They are very dangerous people

388
01:44:11,659 --> 01:44:13,786
So heart beats mind

389
01:44:16,898 --> 01:44:18,525
I was lost for a moment

390
01:44:20,435 --> 01:44:21,527
I am not like you

391
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:23,733
Yes!
You are not like me

392
01:44:24,773 --> 01:44:26,638
Because I am gonna live
a long life

393
01:44:27,242 --> 01:44:29,233
but your and Yanna's future is
something else

394
01:44:59,674 --> 01:45:01,471
Surrender yourself

395
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:02,776
Why?

396
01:45:03,978 --> 01:45:05,809
25 people of D.C. P are in
my custody

397
01:45:06,181 --> 01:45:10,242
and you know I won't hestitae
to kill them

398
01:45:10,885 --> 01:45:12,682
Look you are already in trouble

399
01:45:13,054 --> 01:45:14,578
and don't make another mistake

400
01:45:16,224 --> 01:45:18,954
You will make mistake if you
won't listen to me

401
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:23,125
Within 2 hours I need a helicopter
who will take us to airport

402
01:45:23,798 --> 01:45:25,595
And I need a plane prepared there

403
01:45:26,634 --> 01:45:29,330
When we will reach to that place

404
01:45:29,504 --> 01:45:31,938
then I will make them free
Is that clear Mr. Malik?

405
01:45:32,307 --> 01:45:34,400
What you are asking that's impossible

406
01:45:49,057 --> 01:45:49,989
Can you hear that?

407
01:45:50,692 --> 01:45:53,252
If their condition is that with
bullet's voice then

408
01:45:53,428 --> 01:45:55,259
think if I will kill anyone of them

409
01:45:55,897 --> 01:45:56,795
then what will happen to them?

410
01:45:58,066 --> 01:45:58,862
2 Hours!

411
01:46:06,307 --> 01:46:07,137
Do you know?

412
01:46:07,642 --> 01:46:09,007
How did Don came out from
the building?

413
01:46:10,178 --> 01:46:12,442
No! I am really sorry

414
01:46:12,614 --> 01:46:14,639
but he just told me the plan to
come out from the vault

415
01:46:21,689 --> 01:46:22,917
What he was doing in vault?

416
01:46:26,161 --> 01:46:28,026
So Sameer told you everything

417
01:46:28,429 --> 01:46:29,953
Asnwer my question

418
01:46:30,498 --> 01:46:31,396
Where are the plates?

419
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,694
Verdhan have the plates

420
01:46:34,469 --> 01:46:35,663
How did you come out
from the building?

421
01:46:45,713 --> 01:46:48,910
Do you know how many innocent people
can die because of you

422
01:46:50,485 --> 01:46:52,715
I have regrets that it's happening

423
01:46:53,988 --> 01:46:55,649
But if you need my help

424
01:46:56,357 --> 01:46:58,018
then in return I need something

425
01:46:59,327 --> 01:47:01,887
You are not in position to
crack any deal

426
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:03,858
Well in that case...

427
01:47:05,033 --> 01:47:06,933
...Can I talk to Mr. Dewan once

428
01:47:10,038 --> 01:47:10,527
Why?

429
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,267
Perhaps

430
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:16,599
he could understand my position
better than you

431
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:22,972
It's a simple thing

432
01:47:23,685 --> 01:47:24,709
If I will go to jail

433
01:47:24,852 --> 01:47:27,343
then You and Febian Cole will go
to jail along with me

434
01:47:33,595 --> 01:47:35,893
Whatever you asked I gave you

435
01:47:36,864 --> 01:47:38,695
I just need a last thing

436
01:47:50,778 --> 01:47:54,509
Mr. Dewan has promised me to get
Immunity in Germany

437
01:47:56,417 --> 01:47:58,544
I don't know why but I trust him

438
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:01,383
In this return

439
01:48:01,623 --> 01:48:04,114
to defuse the bombs and to
save those people

440
01:48:04,659 --> 01:48:06,126
I am ready to help you

441
01:48:16,537 --> 01:48:17,834
So you should believe

442
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:21,636
that noble person was born inside me
that wasn't any drama

443
01:48:22,176 --> 01:48:24,337
I am still ready to give that disc
to police department

444
01:48:24,912 --> 01:48:25,901
with it's help

445
01:48:26,414 --> 01:48:26,971
you people

446
01:48:27,515 --> 01:48:29,483
can put the full stop on Europe

447
01:48:30,418 --> 01:48:32,716
Asia's drug story

448
01:48:41,429 --> 01:48:42,828
Roma it's such a strange thing

449
01:48:43,398 --> 01:48:46,299
After so many years life
bring us back together

450
01:48:47,135 --> 01:48:48,932
We can't be together ever

451
01:48:54,575 --> 01:48:57,373
It's possible some day you will
realize that I am not that Don anymore

452
01:48:57,945 --> 01:48:59,276
Whom you hated alot

453
01:49:06,954 --> 01:49:08,615
that's why I can't forget you

454
01:49:09,223 --> 01:49:10,190
My Wild Cat

455
01:49:25,807 --> 01:49:27,502
It's necessary for you to go inside
Yes it is

456
01:49:27,842 --> 01:49:28,604
Why?

457
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:31,141
There are so many units here who
can do this job

458
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:34,848
You stay here with Mr. Malik

459
01:49:38,653 --> 01:49:40,644
If something will happen to her
then I...

460
01:49:43,725 --> 01:49:44,316
What?

461
01:49:51,632 --> 01:49:53,759
Your team is really worried
about each other

462
01:50:15,423 --> 01:50:16,355
Did you find out something
about Don?

463
01:50:16,758 --> 01:50:17,452
Forget him

464
01:50:18,559 --> 01:50:20,959
If he love his life so he
won't come back

465
01:50:38,312 --> 01:50:40,109
What's the story of you and
that Arjun?

466
01:50:42,784 --> 01:50:44,012
It's non of your business

467
01:50:44,819 --> 01:50:47,049
I just want to know that what's
happening in your life

468
01:50:49,424 --> 01:50:51,585
You are not able to think about
somebody else except you

469
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:53,916
Except you!

470
01:51:37,839 --> 01:51:41,036
When I said I am ready to give all
that information to police

471
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:43,499
So what did you feel?

472
01:51:51,085 --> 01:51:53,485
Your words doesn't effect me

473
01:51:56,357 --> 01:51:58,257
But still you were surprised that
why did I do that?

474
01:52:00,261 --> 01:52:01,319
Roma the truth is that

475
01:52:02,263 --> 01:52:03,730
that I am tired with that life

476
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:07,799
I started hate people like Verdhan

477
01:52:09,871 --> 01:52:12,772
I want to free from those people
and law

478
02:02:08,268 --> 02:02:10,293
Now I have seen everything
in my life

479
02:02:12,539 --> 02:02:14,063
What magic you have done
with her

480
02:02:15,776 --> 02:02:16,572
Anyway...

481
02:02:24,351 --> 02:02:27,377
If she didn't shoot Don on
count of 3

482
02:02:43,804 --> 02:02:44,930
Shoot me

483
02:03:19,306 --> 02:03:20,773
So the fire is same on both side

484
02:03:27,514 --> 02:03:28,572
Now it's your turn

485
02:03:30,184 --> 02:03:32,049
Verdhan you might have forgotten
one thing

486
02:03:32,486 --> 02:03:33,077
What's that?

487
02:03:34,154 --> 02:03:36,714
Before Don's enemy get his
first move

488
02:03:38,258 --> 02:03:40,590
Don has already took his next move

489
02:05:30,304 --> 02:05:31,271
Jabbar is dead

490
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:34,870
And you shouldn't have any problem
to take Verdhan back to Jail

491
02:05:36,877 --> 02:05:38,777
Plates and Hostages are in my custody

492
02:05:39,913 --> 02:05:40,709
So now...

493
02:05:41,481 --> 02:05:42,379
I hope

494
02:05:43,116 --> 02:05:44,708
that my immunity papers are ready

495
02:05:47,754 --> 02:05:48,812
Papers are ready

496
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:52,449
Send them in

497
02:05:55,462 --> 02:05:56,554
With Sameer

498
02:05:57,531 --> 02:05:58,088
Why Sameer?

499
02:05:58,865 --> 02:06:00,059
Because

500
02:06:01,635 --> 02:06:03,296
I want to meet that traitor for
the last time

501
02:06:29,896 --> 02:06:30,624
She is alive

502
02:06:32,599 --> 02:06:33,463
Bring the file here

503
02:06:48,048 --> 02:06:50,209
Arrange some secure place

504
02:06:51,084 --> 02:06:52,676
Because if someday I will find you

505
02:06:53,754 --> 02:06:54,948
you won't be alive

506
02:06:55,756 --> 02:06:57,781
You know my address if you ever
wants to meet me

507
02:07:01,595 --> 02:07:02,857
I know your address

508
02:07:29,256 --> 02:07:30,348
What happen to Roma?

509
02:07:40,867 --> 02:07:41,925
Take care of her

510
02:07:56,817 --> 02:07:58,409
Can I do anything else for you?

511
02:07:59,519 --> 02:08:00,611
Where is that disc?

512
02:08:01,488 --> 02:08:02,955
In that bag which has the plates

513
02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:07,023
Can I go?

514
02:08:07,494 --> 02:08:09,758
Let us confirm that information first

515
02:08:14,868 --> 02:08:16,199
It won't take so long?

516
02:09:16,162 --> 02:09:18,460
What to do with these plates?
I will take them

517
02:09:20,267 --> 02:09:22,462
We will have to let them check
in lab for damages

518
02:10:01,508 --> 02:10:02,941
Remember I said...

519
02:10:03,543 --> 02:10:05,670
Don's enemy should always remember

520
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,839
that Don never forgets anything

521
02:10:14,487 --> 02:10:16,216
Who came out to kill me

522
02:10:16,523 --> 02:10:17,820
they all are dead

523
02:10:21,695 --> 02:10:24,220
Jimmy and his all friends

524
02:10:25,098 --> 02:10:26,463
All of them...

525
02:10:29,269 --> 02:10:32,067
Police have to accept my favour

526
02:10:32,606 --> 02:10:36,098
that I exposed Febian Cole to them

527
02:10:38,812 --> 02:10:42,373
Verdhan reached to that place
where he came from

528
02:10:46,886 --> 02:10:48,478
Now only one thing...

529
02:10:49,923 --> 02:10:51,447
One lastjob was left...

530
02:11:25,258 --> 02:11:26,987
I have send a gift for you

531
02:12:32,759 --> 02:12:33,589
Where is that?

532
02:12:43,770 --> 02:12:45,397
When I will come out from D.C. P

533
02:12:45,939 --> 02:12:47,531
you hand over me to police

534
02:12:55,048 --> 02:12:55,946
My all business details are

535
02:12:56,316 --> 02:12:58,045
on this disc

536
02:13:00,854 --> 02:13:03,516
Now listen to me very carefully what
you have to do

537
02:14:02,549 --> 02:14:04,949
World thinks that which plates were
burnt in that blast

538
02:14:05,285 --> 02:14:06,047
those were real

539
02:14:06,686 --> 02:14:09,519
Besides real plates in my hands

540
02:14:36,816 --> 02:14:39,785
My all enemies are finished or
they are in jail

541
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:41,346
And now police tooo

542
02:14:41,988 --> 02:14:44,252
can't do anything with me
So now...

543
02:14:52,966 --> 02:14:54,797
What was the need to save her life?

544
02:14:58,171 --> 02:14:59,866
Roma has become my bad habit

545
02:15:00,773 --> 02:15:02,331
