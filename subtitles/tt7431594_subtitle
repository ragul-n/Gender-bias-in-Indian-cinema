1
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,150
Welcome, Mr. Shamsher Singh.

2
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,650
It was really sad to hearabout your dad's sudden demise.

3
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,980
He was a nice man.

4
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,100
Sad...

5
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,600
Sad for what, Mr. Shamsher.

6
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,150
My dad didn't do anythingunusual by dying.

7
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,020
You die...when you got to die.

8
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Please, sit down.

9
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,650
You've raised the securitya notch on the base, Balwinder.

10
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,230
Even the guards are alert.

11
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,480
They even frisked me,and that too on my own base.

12
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,730
No need to feel bad, Mr. Shamsher.

13
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,100
These people even friskme when I come here.

14
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,150
And as for this base...

15
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,650
...you still own this place.

16
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,020
But after you leave...

17
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,350
...this entire property...

18
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,230
...and infrastructure will be mine.

19
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,060
I am all ears, Ballu.

20
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,350
Go on.

21
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,940
From today,I'll take 20% share of the profits.

22
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,150
And, as a token of my father's20 years of loyal service...

23
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,940
...you'll have to transferthis entire property to me.

24
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,900
And, what if I refuse.

25
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Then be prepared to facelosses worth millions of dollars.

26
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,190
You supply arms to allthe biggest countries in the world.

27
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,900
And I know, as well as you...

28
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,440
...how many are licensed,and how many are unlicensed?

29
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,940
I just have to leak thisinformation to those countries.

30
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
And they will immediately...

31
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,650
...cancel your ordersworth millions of dollars.

32
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,730
You've completely cornered me, Ballu.

33
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,100
I can't let my ego take over andlet your greed shut down my business.

34
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Give me the property papers,I'll sign them.

35
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,850
Nice pen!

36
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Pier Crown!

37
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,850
Price, only $20,000/-

38
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,230
Do you like it?

39
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,350
Yeah.

40
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,350
Keep it.

41
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,690
You know, Mr. Shamsher Singh.

42
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,350
I never imagined youwould be convinced so easily.

43
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,560
I thought you'll first get angry.

44
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
And then, I will haveto convince you in my own way.

45
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
But you just agreed.

46
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,020
My older brother used to say.

47
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,230
Any decision when taken ina fit of rage is never profitable.

48
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,310
So first I took a decision...

49
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,850
...and now I am getting angry.

50
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,190
Very angry!

51
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,350
There's a saying back in my hometown,in Handia.

52
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,190
"When the lion hunts his prey,he feeds on it first..."

53
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,150
"...then the vulturesand the scavengers."

54
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,440
"The worms and insectsfeeds on the leftovers."

55
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,190
And to me,you're smaller than an insect.

56
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,560
Shamsher Singh!

57
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,020
Maybe you can control your anger...

58
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,690
...but not me.

59
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
And, don't forget that you're unarmed.

60
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,060
You might want toguarantee your safe return.

61
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,980
Calm down. Calm down.

62
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,480
Those toys which your menare holding are manufactured by me.

63
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,560
And as for my safe return...

64
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,940
...maybe you're not aware that,I never do anything without insurance.

65
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,730
Don't try to touch the pen.

66
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,230
It's touch sensitive.

67
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,900
This $20,000 pen is lacedwith 20 grams of gelatin.

68
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,310
And the detonator's in my hand.

69
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,600
Tell your men...

70
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,900
...don't even breathe heavily,and don't move a muscle.

71
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,940
If I press this...

72
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,980
...it will trigger a smallexplosion near your heart.

73
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,980
"Poof!"

74
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,770
And it will all be over.

75
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,150
I warned you, Ballu...

76
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,900
...don't mess with this man.

77
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,480
He's dangerous.

78
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,560
For God's sake, do something.

79
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,520
- Hello, sir.- Cyrus...

80
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,940
Now you will look after the base.

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,150
Thank you, sir.

82
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,560
Give the phone to Balwinder.

83
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,560
Hello.

84
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,730
I forgot to mentiona small detail, Ballu.

85
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,100
The deal is off.

86
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,520
'This is Shamsher Singh.'

87
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,900
'He owns the biggest armsfactory on Al Shifa island.'

88
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,690
'25 years ago,he was accused of manufacturing...'

89
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,770
'...and supplying illegalarms in his hometown Handia.'

90
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,310
'But he escaped withhis family to this island...'

91
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,020
'...before he could be arrested.'

92
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,520
'Now he operates from here.'

93
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,770
'This is Raghuvendra Sinha,aka Raghu.'

94
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,060
'Shamsher Singh'sbodyguard And Man-Friday.'

95
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,100
'He's loyal, sharp,and a man of few words.'

96
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,060
'This is Rana Singha.Shamsher Singh's arch enemy.'

97
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,440
'He's got his hands in everyillegal business on this planet.'

98
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,350
'He's Powerful...

99
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Evil...

100
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,230
...and Dangerous.'

101
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,480
'Sanjana...Shamsher Singh's only daughter.'

102
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,900
'Her passion is extreme sports.'

103
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,270
'Also highly trained inthree forms of martial arts.'

104
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,940
'She has got sharp moves,and a sharper mind.'

105
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,310
'She's bold,smart, and very ambitious.'

106
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,730
'This is Sanjana's twin-brother,Suraj Singh.'

107
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,850
'He flies into a rage,faster than his cars.'

108
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,270
'Which is why his social life completelydepends on the money he splurges.'

109
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,020
'He has a specialty.'

110
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,940
'He acts first and thinks later.'

111
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,940
'This is Yash...'

112
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,980
'Singh family's troubleshooter...'

113
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,230
...and Sikander Singh's close friend,and body-guard.'

114
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,310
'He's a man of few words,he speaks and hits more.'

115
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,690
'He's loyal and loveable,but extremely lethal.'

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,690
'And...this is Sikander Singh.'

117
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,020
'Shamsher Singh's step-son...'

'...and, Suraj andSanjana's step-brother.'

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,480
'...is Sikander Singh.'

122
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,150
'Now you have a briefon the entire Singh family.'

123
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,060
'And, you know what to do.'

124
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,060
'Let this race begin.'

125
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,520
- Target in sight.- Good.

126
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,440
Make sure you get him this time.

127
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,900
That's better. You don't worry.

128
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,310
The consignment willreach you on time.

129
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,650
Raghu, we're in trouble.

130
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,020
They are Rana's men!

131
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,440
Stop! Stop!

132
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,770
Move, Raghu!

133
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,730
Get me closer! Get me closer!

134
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,560
Go left. Left! Left! Left!

135
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,020
Rana sent you, didn't he?

136
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Didn't he?

137
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,550
Yes, Raghu. Tell me.

138
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,100
There's been an assassinationattempt on your dad, Suraj.

139
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,180
What?

140
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,680
- How is dad?- Now don't worry.

141
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,180
He's safe.

142
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,050
He's with his medical team.

143
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,850
Luckily the bulletjust grazed his shoulder.

144
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,300
Tell me who did this.

145
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,470
Who else can it be other than Rana?

146
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,350
Rana is a dead man.

147
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,510
What was Suraj saying?

148
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,930
He sounded really angry.

149
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,850
I think he's goingto Rana's warehouse.

150
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,430
That boy's an idiot.

151
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,470
I am sure Sanjana'salso gone with him.

152
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,180
Find out...

153
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,430
...where's Sikander.

154
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
Sikander's been already informed.

155
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,100
This always came to myaide when I was in trouble.

156
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,970
And it's one of theclosest thing to my heart.

157
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,390
My lucky mascot.

158
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,430
And now it's yours.

159
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,970
Really?

160
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Thank you.

161
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,970
She's beautiful.

162
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,850
Keep it.

163
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,800
Sexy uncle,you must be feeling a little jealous.

164
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,350
Actually,he must be feeling very jealous.

165
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,100
Not jealous, I am happy.

166
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,430
I had my eyes on it.

167
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
But you deserve it.

168
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,850
Thank you.

169
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,390
Raghu,...

170
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,390
...tell Suraj and Sanjanato meet me in my den.

171
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,760
And find out how farour lawyer has reached?

172
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,220

182
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,300
Thank you, sir.

183
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,050
Then shoot, Lawyer.

184
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,100
A few weeks ago,you two celebrated your 25th birthday.

185
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,100
So I am here to executeyour mother's will.

186
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,260
Ohhh...

187
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,890
Nice.

188
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,260
Your mother, Sumitra Devi...

189
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,850
...divided her propertyof Al Shifa in two parts.

190
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,680
She gave 50% of thisproperty to Sikander...

191
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,430
...which I already transferredin his name a few years ago.

192
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,390
And she transferred 50% to you two...

193
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,050
...and, the time has come to execute it.

194
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,100
25% each.

195
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,550
So here's the Will...

196
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,760
...and, I'll need yoursignatures here, son.

197
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,510
- Do I sign here?- Yes.

198
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,390
Congratulations, children.

199
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,720
Now you two are 50%partners of this property.

200
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,140
Okay sir, I'll take your leave.

201
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,430
See you soon.

202
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,390
- Thank you, sir.- See you, sir.

203
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,260
- Bye.- Bye.

204
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,220
What was this, bro?

205
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,140
Like seriously?

206
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,300
We get 25% each,while he gets 50.

207
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Really dad.

208
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,640
Even mom treated us the same wayyou've have been treating us.

209
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,260
Are we your children, or is he?

210
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,140
You are my children,...

211
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,890
...and so is he.

212
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,260
Your cousin.

213
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,930
Sikander's like your brother.

214
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,510
Your cousin.

215
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,220
When did this happen, dad?

216
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,720
He's my older brother...

217
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,680
...Rannchod Singh's son.

218
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,550
'27 years ago,we owned a small arms factory...'

219
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,350
'...in our hometown of Handia,in Allahabad.'

220
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,390
'The arms we made in this factory...'

221
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,140
'...were only suppliedto the Indian Army.'

222
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,470
'Handia's local politician,Gajendra Pathak...'

223
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,390
'...and his son Narender,...

224
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,850
...wanted us to illegallysupply them weapons.'

225
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,800
'I've said this before,...

226
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,930
...I will never do anything illegal.'

227
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,350
- Goodbye.- 'But my brother refused to comply...'

228
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,800
'...and we ended upmaking them our enemies.'

229
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,300
Do you know who you're talking to?

230
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,300
- I'll set this place ablaze.- Shamsher...

231
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,300
Shamsher.

232
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,350
'This incident alsotook a toll on our family.'

233
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,100
'Sumitra,who loved her son Sikander a lot...'

234
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,390
'...was very concerned.'

235
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,550
'A week later our arms consignmentwas being transported by road.'

236
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,050
'We rode with the trucks...'

237
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,260
'...because we had informationthat Gajender was planning...'

238
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,010
'...to hi-jack our trucks.'

239
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,470
'And that's exactly what happened.'

240
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
'His men had us surrounded.'

241
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,760
'We ended up killing Gajender'sson in that encounter.'

242
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,010
'Son's death drove Gajender crazy.'

243
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,720
'Gajender swore to ruin our family.'

244
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,760
'And his first target was my brother.'

245
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,050
'But, this feud didn'tend with my brother's demise.'

246
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,760
'Gajender used hispower and influence...'

247
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,760
'...to prove that wesupply arms to terrorists.'

248
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,100
'Our factory was sealed.'

249
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,850
'We were deemed as traitors.'

250
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,760
'And our entire family'slife was in danger.'

251
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,050
'I immediately sent Sikanderto Beijing with Raghu.'

252
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,350
'And I came to Al Shifaalong with Sumitra.'

253
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,180
'My brother had already boughta small island out here...'

254
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,100
'...in order to expand his business.'

255
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,720
With my hard work,I started an arms factory out here.

256
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,510
I took Sumitra under my refuge accordingto our family's rites and rituals.

257
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,140
And married her.

258
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,510
A year later you two were born.

259
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,140
Sumitra's health started todeteriorate after you two were born.

260
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,850
And soon she passed away.

261
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,800
If we hadn't killed Gajendra'sson in a fit of rage...

262
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,550
...then we would stillbe living in our country.

263
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,510
But I promise you...

264
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,510
If you two are with me...

265
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,140
...then soon we'll return to our home.

266
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,220
We'll go back to Handia.

267
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,300
And live togetheronce again like family.

268
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,140
They are gone,it had no effect on them.

269
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,510
They will change.

270
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,350
What the hell is happening, bro?

271
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,350
- What happened?- Nothing...

272
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,180
First mom gave 50% ofher property to Sikander.

273
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,970
And now dad wantsto go back to Handia.

274
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,760
Who wants to go to Handia, man?

275
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,390
Calm down, Suraj.

276
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,720
I was angrier than youafter hearing mom's will.

277
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,850
But I controlled myself.

278
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,890
And whenever dad praisesthat Sikander,...

279
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,050
- ...my blood boils.- I swear.

280
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,050
But, I don't show it.

281
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,300
And, if you want tosolve this problem for good...

282
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,550
...then Sikander must never get awhiff of what's cooking in our minds.

283
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,180
I hope you can do that much, Suraj.

284
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,390
Of course, bro.

285
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,850
- Good.- Of course.

286
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:44,450
"Come a little closer,and hold my hand..."

287
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:52,650
"Walk with me,and just sit there."

288
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:11,780
"And share yourthoughts with me, baby..."

289
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:22,490
"Just for once be selfish, baby,and live for yourself."

290
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:31,400
"Just for once be selfish, baby,and live for yourself."

291
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,700
Wow... very nice, bravo.

292
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,990
- Thank you.- Cheers.

293
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,070
Cheers, bro.

294
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,240
- Lovely, lovely.- Cheers, Sikku bro.

295
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,820
- Oh my, God.- What happened?

296
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,570
- We're all such big losers.- Why, bro?

297
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,820
- We have everything we need.- This?

298
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,860
Correct. We have everything we need.

299
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,820
But we don't have what they have.

300
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,820
Yeah man.

301
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,490
...everybody has a girlfriend.

302
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,530
Bro, they are all in love.

303
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,030
Shame on us.

304
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,650
Not all of us.

305
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,400
- Just the three of you.- What?

306
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,990
Meaning I met a girl a few days ago...

307
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,400
- Really?- And I've fallen in love with her.

308
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,360
And soon she'll be coming over,at their party.

309
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,070
It's a done deal.

310
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,280
- Signed, sealed, and delivered.- Really.

311
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,450
With a kiss.

312
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,360
- Yes. Cheers.- Cheers.

313
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,400
Cheers.

314
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,530
Happy for you, bro.

315
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,780
Why are you so sad?

316
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,700
Don't you have abeautiful girlfriend too?

317
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,530
I did.

318
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,530
Again?

319
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,280
Yash, I've got to dosomething about my temper.

320
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,860
I scared her.

321
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,490
It wasn't your temper that scared her.

322
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,320
It was your face.

323
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,700
That's really mean Sikku bro.

324
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,950
Chill, bro. I am there.

325
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,280
That's my sister. That's my sister.

326
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,700
Come here.

327
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,740
I saw that.

328
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,360
It's just not my day today.

329
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,400
You three have raisedthe bar so high...

330
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,650
...that they alllook like idiots to me.

331
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,900
I agree.

332
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,240
The day I find that boy...

333
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,360
...I'll go straight to dad.

334
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,070
And tell him I am in love.

335
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,610
Then get married.

336
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,280
Have couple of children.

337
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,610
And I am done.

338
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,530
Cheers.

339
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,780
- Cheers.- Cheers.

340
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,570
- Cheers, bro.- Cheers.

341
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,990
Come on.

342
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,450
Tell us.

343
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,570
Well, since everyone istalking their heart out...

344
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,610
...so let me sharemy experience as well.

345
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,450
- Hold on. Bro...guitar.- Why?

346
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,820
Background music is important.

347
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,360
- There you go, bro.- Exactly.

348
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,650
- Really?- Of course.

349
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,780
Go on.

350
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,570
So, during my time in Beijing...

351
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,860
...I saw this gorgeous girl.

352
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,780
Beautiful.

353
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,450
Where are you?

354
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,610
I've been waiting for half an hour.

355
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,900
What... You're ditching.

356
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,450
Bye.

357
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,700
Indian!

358
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,820
Be careful...

359
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,740
She's Indian.

360
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,150
We love India.

361
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,740
Best of luck then.

362
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,400
- Hey...what are you drinking?- Sorry...do I know you?

363
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,530
No?

364
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,900
- We'll get to know.- No thanks.

365
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,820
Okay listen,you guys need to leave right now.

366
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,860
No, seriously.

367
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,780
I don't want to make a scene,But I will call security.

368
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,740
- Lovely...- Please leave.

369
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,700
Don't touch me.

370
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,150
- God...- Goodbye.

371
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,360
Hello.

372
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,700
Hello...and thank you.

373
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,070
You are very welcome.

374
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,740
Ahh-Ahh... excuse me...

375
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,700
So now you're goingto officially hit on me.

376
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,570
Men are all the same.

377
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,990
Explain me this to me.

378
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,700
Three guys come over,they praise you...

379
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,990
...but, you don't like that.

380
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,530
An Indian comes to afellow Indian's rescue.

381
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,240
But you don't like that either.

382
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,490
- Isn't that kind of...- Wa...wa...wait!

383
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,570
Weird.

384
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,610
Weird! Yes, weird.

385
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,900
I was born weird.

386
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,240
Oh.. I like that.

387
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,110
So why don't you tell mewhere you were born, what time...

388
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320
...and what for? What's the purpose?

389
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,240
So that when I have kids,I will avoid all these things totally.

390
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,530
You are so weird.

391
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,990
- Thank you.- That's not a compliment.

392
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,030
Really.

393
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,740
I am weird.

394
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
Bye, weirdo.

395
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,860
Oh no.

396
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,280
Are you following me?

397
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,530
Following you...

398
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,900
- I came down this aisle...- Weirdo.

399
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,490
"I'll never...stop following you,sweetheart..."

400
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,450
Listen, this is too much.

401
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,030
I guess I'll haveto call the security.

402
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,950
I...

403
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,900
You know, sweetheart.

404
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,950
This is a very common coincidence.

405
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,400
This two-bedroom suite belongs to me...

406
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,780
...and, that common room belongs to you.

407
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,530
Yeah, right.

408
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,110
I am so stupid!

409
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,150
Yeah...

410
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,110
...very stupid.

411
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,150
Can you hear me?

412
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,700
Actually no...

413
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,030
I am trying to guesswhat you're going to say next.

414
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,530
Sorry.

415
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,070
Fine. These things happen.I understand.

416
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,150
By the way...

417
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,950
...my name is Sikander.

418
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,740
Sikander Singh.

419
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,820
I am Jessica.

420
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,700
Nice to meet you, Jessica.

421
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,530
Nice to meet you, Sikander.

422
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,360
"Our sights, and our breath..."

423
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,070
"...met when we met."

424
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:46,780
"Let's forget the past...

425
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,700
...and think aboutnow and the future."

426
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,450
"Nobody knows whatthe future holds for us."

427
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,700
"Let's give it our best."

428
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,740
"Sweetheart..."

429
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,240
"When we're close..."

430
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,780
"...when we're together..."

431
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,150
"...when we're face to face..."

432
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,990
"...my soul wants to say..."

433
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,530
"I found love..."

434
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,780
"I found love..."

435
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,400
"I found love..."

436
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,780
"I found it in you!"

437
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,740
"Because I found love..."

438
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,950
"I found love..."

439
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,490
"I found love..."

440
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,820
"I found it in you!"

441
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,900
"Because I found love..."

442
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,240
"I found love..."

443
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,700
"I found love..."

444
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,030
"I found it in you!"

445
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,860
"It's a good thing that I got to..."

446
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:06,740
"...know about your flaws,before your qualities."

447
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,610
"It's really amazing..."

448
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,740
"It's truly amazing, that..."

449
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,530
"...that I fell in lovewith your flaws as well."

450
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,610
"Oh, baby..."

451
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,570
"When we're close..."

452
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,650
"...when we're together..."

453
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,950
"...when we're face to face..."

454
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,740
"...my soul wants to say..."

455
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,110
"I found love..."

456
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,530
"I found love..."

457
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,780
"I found love..."

458
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,360
"I found it in you!"

459
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,990
"Because I found love..."

460
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,570
"I found love..."

461
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,990
"I found love..."

462
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,780
"I found it in you!"

463
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:34,740
"I've entrusted my life...my life..."

464
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:45,360
"...in your hands, and in your eyes."

465
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:55,780
"I've found my way to your heart,through your lips."

466
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,900
"Without worrying about the future..."

467
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:04,700
"...let's live lifeas it comes our way."

468
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,950
"Because I found love..."

469
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,240
"I found love..."

470
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,740
"I found love..."

471
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,360
"I found it in you!"

472
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,240
"Because I found love..."

473
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,490
"I found love..."

474
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,950
"I found love..."

475
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,240
"I found it in you!"

476
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,490
"Because I found love..."

477
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,990
"I found love..."

478
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,150
"I found love..."

479
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,070
"I found it in you!"

480
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,070
Oh my, God.Sikander Singh is in love.

481
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,530
- What happened then?- Then...

482
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,110
I waited for a couple of days.

483
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,740
Then I waited for another week.

484
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,950
And then I found out...

485
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,990
...that she's disappeared.

486
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,490
Awww...

487
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,320
I feel ya, bro.

488
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,740
I felt it too, bro.

489
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,490
I found my true love.

490
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:30,110
So I'll pray thatyou soon find yours, bro.

491
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,150
What the... it's Birju.

492
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,400
Brij my friend.

493
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,700
Where are you?

494
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,110
How are you?

495
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,780
I am absolutely fine, Shamshu.

496
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,240
- I just landed in your city.- So why call?

497
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,450
Drop by at my mansion.

498
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,110
I came all the way here to meet you.

499
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,950
But this matter is a little sensitive.

500
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,650
I've booked room no.1001 at the Intercontinental hotel.

501
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,650
1001... understand.

502
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,110
Can you meet me in an hour?

503
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,700
It's really urgent.

504
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,360
I can get there before you andwelcome you personally with flowers.

505
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,030
- Just say the word.- Then get there immediately.

506
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,110
Great. See you in one hour.

507
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,280
"Sweety..."

508
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,780
- Shamshu...- Brijwa...

509
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,450
- It's been 10 long years, Brij.- Yes.

510
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,650
But you haven't changed at all.

511
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,860
Enough praising me,and look at yourself.

512
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,360
You still look dashing-fantastic.

513
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,820
If you stand outsideMishra's dairy even now...

514
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,610
...girls willfall head over heels for you.

515
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,700
Don't talk about home,it's depressing.

516
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,610
What's the job?

517
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,860
Shamshu, you know that my boss,Johnny Srivastav...

518
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,700
...owns a 7-star hotel in Manali.

519
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,490
I do... It's really amazing.

520
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,490
But you don't knowwhat goes on in that hotel.

521
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:16,360
The top politicians and businessmenof India patronize that hotel.

522
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,950
Not because it's exclusive.

523
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,490
But because it's the centerfor every kind of debauchery.

524
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,700
- Brothel.- Yes, a brothel.

525
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,740
And only a handfulof VIPs know about it.

526
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,610
This place offers everykind of sexual perversion.

527
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,700
But these politicians didn't know...

528
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,780
...that Johnny had installedmultiple spy-cams in every room.

529
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,740
And he would record their indulgence.

530
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,110
Only Johnny and I knew this secret.

531
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,740
But somehow thisinformation was leaked...

532
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,860
...and Rana found out about it.

533
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,950
A few days ago Johnnycame to Al Shifa for a deal.

534
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,860
But Rana's men kidnapped him.

535
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,900
Rana's men started torturing Johnny...

536
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,320
...and wanted to knowwhere the hard disk was.

537
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,820
Poor Johnny would'vetold them everything anyway...

538
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:14,030
...but he died of a sudden heart attack.

539
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,700
- The guy's heart shut down.- Hmmm...

540
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,110
- Due to the torture.- Yes.

541
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,700
And where are the videos?

542
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,820
The videos are on this hard disk.

543
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,490
If we can get ourhandson this hard disk...

544
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,320
...then you can't imaginethe possibilities.

545
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,990
Oh, my...Yash, did you see this?

546
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,150
Dad, this is mind-boggling.It's a gold mine.

547
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,360
But where is this hard disk?

548
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:46,030
The hard disk is locked away in lockerno. 7003 of the SRL Bank in Cambodia.

549
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,900
All you have to dois steal that hard disk.

550
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,900
Wow... you're a true friend.

551
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,450
You told me about the bankand locker before naming your price.

552
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,490
Great...just great.

553
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,860
I know its great

554
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,530
But the disk is passwordprotected, Shamshu.

555
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,990
And only I know the password.

556
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:17,110
The password panel is touchSensitive and pressure sensitive too.

557
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:25,530
So it's very important for me tobe alive while entering the password.

558
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,650
Yeah...

559
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,030
That's even better.

560
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,280
"Sweety..."

561
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,450
Son, Brij wants $1billion in bearer bonds...

562
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,490
...and $1 billion by cheque.

563
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,820
We must speak withthe banker for a loan.

564
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,740
And Interpol Officer Khannawill blackmail the politicians for us.

565
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,030
$2 billion!

566
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,030
1 billion officially,and 1 billion in bearer bonds.

567
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,360
All for a hard disk.

568
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,820
And we're resorting to blackmail.

569
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,740
Through that Interpol officer Khanna.

570
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,450
That sleazy Khanna.

571
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:01,900
Sleazy deal.

572
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:08,780
I don't understand the motiveand outcome of this deal.

573
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,740
What did you say?

574
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,110
Waste of time.

575
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,700
Waste of time?

576
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,900
Though you studied at Oxford...

577
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,610
...but, you don't haveeven an ounce of brain.

578
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,700
He wants to knowthe motive and result...

579
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,650
I would've even paidhim $10 billion for it.

580
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,530
I would've sold everything to pay him.

581
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,530
What do we have out here?

582
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,070
What is this?

583
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,700
No one supports me.Not even my own throat.

584
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,240
What are you looking at? Do your job.

585
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,150
Get those two damn boxes here.

586
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,820
Sit...

587
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:05,900
My intention is to clearyour father's and my name...

588
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,530
...which was discredited years ago.

589
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:15,150
And the result will bethat we'll be able to return home...

590
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,740
...to Handia, with pride.

591
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,740
That's the motive and the result.

592
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,490
I accepted this jobbecause I have faith in you.

593
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,070
I promise you...

594
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,700
...that I'll risk my lifeto get that hard disk for you.

595
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,780
So that I can send you backto your home in Handia with pride.

596
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,700
I am really homesick, son.

597
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,990
Just send me back home.

598
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,700
So that I may never needRestyl and Calmpose again.

599
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:57,740
"Sweety..."

600
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,530
- Welcome. Welcome.- Hello.

601
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,240
- Greetings.- Greetings.

602
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,990
Nice party, Raghu.

603
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,490
What's the occasion?

604
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,280
Mr. Khanna has arrived.

605
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,240
- Yeah...yeah...- Excuse me, sir.

606
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,700
Officer Khanna has arrived.

607
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,700
These are our politicians.

608
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,030
They have stooped so low.

609
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,740
They can do anything for debauchery.

610
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,700
And officers like ustake orders from them, sir.

611
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,030
Shameless people.

612
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,700
Some of them, Khanna.

613
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,110
They give a bad nameto all the politicians.

614
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,610
But I must admit, sir.

615
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,150
This hard disk is like a guidedMissile from Al Shifa to India.

616
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,360
And you will launch this missile.

617
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,150
Raghu will give yousoft copies after the party.

618
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,700
And I'll tell youwhat to do with them.

619
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,400
$1 billion... it's a big amount.

620
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,650
- For you, Mr. Goel.- Yes...

621
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,990
Yes...

622
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,700
It must be a pretty big business deal.

623
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:30,950
Sorry, sir.

624
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:34,700
We don't tolerate anyoneinterfering in our business.

625
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,280
Our business is our business.

626
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,700
None of your business.

627
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,780
It can take some time.

628
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:46,320
And Singh sir, you might haveto give some collateral for this loan.

629
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,860
Obviously...

630
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,110
Don't let me catch you again.

631
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,400
Yes... Sorry, sir.

632
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,700
Jessica, you're already here.

633
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,950
I can't believe my eyes.

634
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,740
How can I break your trust?

635
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,950
And you should know me by now.

636
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,650
I never break a promiseor a commitment.

637
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,860
Oh... the man himself. My hero.

638
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,950
He's the guy I work for.

639
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,530
He's like a brother to me.Sikander Singh.

640
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,610
Hi, nice to meet you.

641

647
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,490
No, they are twins,and that's their cousin.

648
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,450
And yes, they are all Singhs.

649

Yeah, she is.

652
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,030
By the way, where did you meet her?

653
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,700
Even I would like to know this.

654
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,280
Jealous?

655
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,400
- Yes...- Yes...

656
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,150
I am happy.

657

"Let the party go on-and-on-and-on..."

713
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,000
Olga, it was so nice to see you.

714
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,450
- I am going to call you, okay.- Yes.

715
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,790
Drive carefully, okay.

716
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,080
- See you, then.- Love you, baby.

717
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,660
- Bye.- Bye.

718
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,660
Sikander played it well.

719
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,750
Careful with him.

720
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:54,910
Guy's out cold.

721
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,790
He can't even handle too much booze.

722
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,750
How will he handle Jessica?

723
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,660
Exactly, Sanju.

724
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,950
How will he handle Jessica?

725
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,450
Listen...you look really happy.

726
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,370
I am... but, nothing's confirmed yet.

727
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,910
Let me confirm,and I'll let you know in the morning.

728
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,040
Ohh...

729
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,830
After you. Come, sis.

730
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,080
Hi.

731
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,200
Hello, weirdo.

732
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,160
Why do you want to meet someone...

733
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,700
...you don't even trustor have faith in?

734
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,580
You're still angry.

735
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,450
He's a great guy.

736
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,000
Yash.

737
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,830
When did you meet him?

738
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,830
When or how, or what'smy relationship with him...

739
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,410
that's none of your business.

740
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,700
You've no right toask these questions.

741
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,660
And, if I'd knownthat you're Yash' boss...

742
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,250
...then I would've never come here.

743
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,000
You were such a jerk.

744
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,250
You're right, I was a jerk.

745
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,580
I made a big mistake.

746
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,540
I am really sorry, Jessica.

747
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,160
I tried to find you after that day.

748
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,950
Yeah, right.

749
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,540
Come on.

750
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,700
I am sorry.

751
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,450
It's over.

752
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,950
Jessica...

753
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,080
I know I went overboard last night.

754
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,540
And I am sorry about it.

755
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,000
That's not the point, Yash.Just leave it alone.

756
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,000
Try to understand, Yash.

757
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:34,290
Jessica.

758
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:36,000
Keys, please.

759
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:38,450
- Stop acting like a child now.- You grow up.

760
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,950
- Yash. Jessica.- Oh god!

761
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,000
Going somewhere?

762
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,000
Not me, she is.

763
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,160
- To stay at the Marriott.- Marriott.

764
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,250
Why? Any special reason?

765
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,000
I am not comfortable here.

766
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,000
- Here?- Yes...

767
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,370
Ohhh...

768
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,200
I wouldn't want to interferebetween boyfriend and girlfriend.

769
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:03,580
Your thing.

770
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
- Congratulations on the girlfriend.- Thank you.

771
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,910
- Bye, Yash.- Enjoy.

772
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,160
- Bye.- Jessica.

773
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,040
Look at them...how they've grown up.

774
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,000
But when will they mature?

775
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,450
Brij must be waiting forthe bonds at the Intercontinental.

776
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,290
You go, Sikander.

777
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,870
Yes...

778
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,370
Great.

779
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,700
Good.

780
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:10,080
Nonsense. I don't believe this.

781
01:05:11,290 --> 01:05:12,750
And you shouldn't.

782
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:17,290
Anyone who believes inhear-says are very gullible.

783
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,950
And you're not thatkind of a guy, Yash.

784
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,120
You run around that Sikku all day.

785
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,040
You even took a bullet for him, Yash.

786
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,000
And now he's making a fool out of you.

787
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,080
Bro, this time open your laptop,and not your heart...

788
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,500
...and show him proof.

789
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,580
- Then he will believe you.- Sure.

790
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,540
Wait, wait, wait.

791
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,200
I want to see that hug again.

792
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,000
What passion, bro. What passion.

793
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,700
I can understand the hug.

794
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,790
Even friends hug.

795
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,000
But smooch.

796
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,000
Yash, hi.

797
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,830
Where are you going, Yash?

798
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,830
Yash, come back here.

799
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,750
Yash!

800
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,830
What's wrong, Yash?

801
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,620
What are you doing?

802
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,410
Yash!

803
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,370
What are you doing, ya...

804
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,370
God!

805
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,620
Yash.

806
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,620
- Where is he?- Yash.

807
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,080
- Where is he?- Listen to me.

808
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,160
Where is he?

809
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,410
- Yash, please.- Here I am.

810
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,370
Right here, Yash.

811
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,910
Right here.

812
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,000
Yash.

813
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:58,540
How could you do this to me, man?

814
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,160
How could you do this to me?

815
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,040
Relax.

816
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,120
Relax?

817
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,410
Sikander.

818
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,910
Every coin has two sides.

819
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,910
On one side is my dear friend...

820
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,120
...and on the other side is the girl.

821
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,290
But remember...

822
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:21,660
Nothing comes beforefamily and loyalty.

823
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,540
You're 100% right, Yash.

824
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,660
100% right.

825
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,000
But in this situation...

826
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:32,290
Girl.

827
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:40,620
But you're so shocked, thatyou're starting to sound very preachy.

828
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,000
Now listen to what I have to say.

829
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,830
Every coin has two sides.

830
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,540
Two...

831
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,330
But this one has four...

832
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,540
She's the same JessicaI met in Beijing.

833
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,370
Six months before she met you.

834
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,410
What do you think?

835
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,000
She just fell in our lap?

836
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,160
A miracle?

837
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,000
You think this is a coincidence.

838
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,540
I said stop it.

839
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,910
- This beautiful...- I said stop it, Sikander.

840
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,120
- Please.- Jessica...

841
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,790
...this is between brothers.

842
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,040
I can't lie to him.

843
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,250
And Jessica, when the foundationof any relationship is based on a lie...

844
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,000
...how's that bloody ever going to work.

845
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,620
And you think I betrayed you.

846
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,370
For what?

847
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,700
For a girl?

848
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,040
For a girl?

849
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,660
Do you want to know the truth?

850
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,870
Forget it.

851
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:56,750
Bring it on.

852
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,250
Then listen...

853
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,540
That morning when I woke up,I found a note left by Jessica.

854
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,660
It said;

855
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,540
"He babe, I am going tobe out for a couple of days".

856
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,040
"Something urgent has come up."

857
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,540
"I will call you. Love, Jessi."

858
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,870
When I went back for my laptop...

859
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,830
...I noticed that mybag of money was missing.

860
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,620
I found Jessica's airticket from the dustbin.

861
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,120
- Yes?- You will have to come with us.

862
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,040
Thank God you're here.There's been some confusion.

863
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,580
They think I've stolen something.

864
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,790
Is she the one?

865
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,500
Unfortunately.

866
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,120
- I didn't steal anything.- Ma'am, please...

867
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,000
Sikander.

868
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,200
- Please, ma'am.- You know me.

869
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,250
- And when I returned to the hotel.- Excuse me.

870
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,290
Excuse me, sir.

871
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:42,040
I believe this is yours.

872
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,950
Please check the contents.

873
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,370
Our security team apprehendedone of our junior staff's with it.

874
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,160
I am really sorry,sir, for the inconvenience.

875
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,330
- Was there a female involved with him?- No, sir. He was working alone.

876
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,750
- Thank you.- Sorry, sir.

877
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,620
So Jessica didn't steal the bag.

878
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:00,000
She's very complicated.

879
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,330
After the lady was arrested,I went back to my hotel room.

880
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,040
Feeling like crap.

881
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,750
I thought of doing someinvestigation on my own.

882
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:11,660
Since you can't even trust love,how can you trust anyone in business?

883
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:16,410
You know that I always hide a spy camwith all my documents and money.

884
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,580
When I saw the spy cam,imagine what is see.

885
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,290
Jessica, in a green top and red pant...

886
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:33,370
So Jessica stole the bag.

887
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,250
Yes...

888
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,750
But then I realized something.

889
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,000
Her beautiful hands weren'tthe only ones involved.

890
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,580
- I went down to the Police station...- Let's go.

891
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,700
...and bailed her out.

892
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,750
Thank you.

893
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,870
Thank you.

894
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:55,910
Listen to me.

895
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,410
I don't want to hear anything.

896
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:00,120
You suspected me.

897
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,910
How could you?

898
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:03,870
And I...

899
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,620
And I thought ourrelationship was special.

900
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,660
- I never want to see your face again...- Please be quiet, Jessica.

901
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,830
Stop this charade.

902
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,370
Over-bloody-acting.

903
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:19,080
I know you stole the bag.

904
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,580
So, weirdo, you met meunder very unusual circumstances.

905
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,750
Very nice.

906
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,620
And I just couldn't helpbut fall in love with you.

907
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,290
Then another situation was created...

908
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,000
...where I doubt you,...

909
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,000
And I am proven wrong.And I feel like crap.

910
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:48,620
If I hadn't hidden a spy cam...

911
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,580
...then I would stillbe feeling like crap.

912
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:58,700
Now I just want to know one thing.

913
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:03,330
You did everything willingly,and why?

914
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,250
I don't know why I was askedto do this, nor did I ask.

915
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,160
When the money is that good,why ask questions?

916
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,500
Who hired Jessica?

917
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,950
Who hired Jessica?

918
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,410
Who hired Jessica?

919
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,870
Suraj and Sanjana.

920
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,000
I must admit theyhave a wicked mind.

921
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,910
I know.

922
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,790
But why are they doing all this?

923
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,700
They want us to butt heads.

924
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,660
Which is why in the securityroom we showed the twins...

925
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,120
...what they wanted to see.

926
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,750
But Yash, you must tell them that...

927
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:45,040
...all the misunderstandingsbetween us have been cleared now.

928
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,830
And Sikander has promisednever to interfere between us.

929
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,750
You must clear anothermisunderstanding between us.

930
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,500
Whose side are you on?

931
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,040
I am sorry, Yash.

932
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:00,910
Yours.

933
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
It's cool.

934
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,950
But what is their plan?

935
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,830
I don't know.

936
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,790
Those two fools are tryingto eliminate me from this race...

937
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:20,830
...but they don't know that the'Champion' of this race... is me!

938
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:32,800
So ladies and gentlemen,as you all know...

939
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,680
...the whole world hasdeclared a war on drugs.

940
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,180
According to ourrecent Interpol reports...

941
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:42,300
...the drug industry has taken over...

942
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:46,640
Excuse me...

943
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,470
Hello.

944
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,140
You must be really busy, Khanna.

945
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,850
I called you a couple of times.

946
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,100
But you didn't answer.

947
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,350
Sorry, Shamsher sir,I was busy in a conference.

948
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:56,100
But please go ahead.

949
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,350
I've texted you thenames of eight politicians.

950
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,100
- You know what to do.- Consider it done, sir.

951
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,760
Great. Great.

952
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,350
Speak to you later.

953
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:10,260
Raghu, one joker,and eight politicians.

954
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,970
Now watch how thisjoker turns the tables.

955
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,100
Hello.

956
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,720
Mr. Chauhan,this is officer Khanna from Interpol.

957
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,300
Interpol?

958
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,640
It's evident fromthese photos and videos...

959
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,470
...how sensitive is this situation...

960
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,010
These photos and videosshouldn't leak out at any cost.

961
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:47,680
I am willing to pay any price.

962
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,300
I've been instructedto tell you that...

963
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,760
...you must come toAl Shifa in a few days.

964
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,510
The deal for these photosand videos will go down there.

965
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:58,100
Okay... Okay, I will be there.

966
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,300
Who do I have to meet?

967
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:02,300
The place and timewill be texted to you.

968
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,720
Hello... Hello...

969
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,930
Oh my, God.

970
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:15,850
Napkin.

971
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,260
What's wrong with you, Yash?

972
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,720
Nothing, it's just that Sikander...

973
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:24,100
I mean I was thinking about Jessica.

974
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,050
Think, Yash, think.

975
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,800
In fact, that's all you cando for the rest of your life now.

976
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,550
You got yourself agirlfriend and her ex-lover.

977
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,550
In a package deal.

978
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,890
It's not funny, Suraj.

979
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:41,430
Sikander has promised hewon't come between Jessica and me.

980
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,510
And you believed him.

981
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,140
Bro, Yash is so naive.

982
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,970
There are two pointof views to see this situation.

983
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,680
A male and a female.

984
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,800
The male point of view.

985
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,800
Sikander knew thatyou're serious about Jessica.

986
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,720
Still he called Jessicato the security room at 2 am.

987
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,010
Why?

988
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,050
And if Jessica andyou ever get married...

989
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:10,220
...you'll never be ableto get those two out of your head.

990
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:13,890
And if that happens,which I think it will...

991
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,260
...what will you do then?

992
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,930
There's nothing you can do, Yash.

993
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,470
Because Sikander's your bro,your mentor, he's everything for you.

994
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:26,720
Including your wife's lover.

995
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,180
Jealous.

996
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,680
- Now... the female point of view.- Enough!

997
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,220
What do I do, dammit?

998
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,010
- What do I do?- Simple...

999
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,050
Quit 'team Sikander'and join 'team Twins'.

1000
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,680
We're willing to offer you10% partnership in our business...

1001
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,640
...and Jessica will be 100% yours.

1002
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,800
How much is that?

1003
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,100
110%

1004
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,720
So, Mr. Yash,the ball is in your court.

1005
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:54,800
Bro...

1006
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,220
Here's the layout of themunicipal plans for this area.

1007
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,890
You book the nightclub...

1008
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,180
...and I'll go open an account.

1009
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,550
Please come, sir.

1010
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,890
Once again thank you so much, sir...

1011
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,800
...for opening a bigaccount in our bank.

1012
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,100
- You're welcome.- Please come.

1013
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,300
This is your locker.

1014
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,220
Please take your time.

1015
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,180
- Thank you so much, sir.- Thank you.

1016
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,890
Sexy uncle, see you later alligator.

1017
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:52,640
See you.

1018
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,100
Did you sell your loyalty?

1019
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,550
Forget 10%, I wouldn't join handswith them even for 100%

1020
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:08,640
But if someone tries to buyme with love, then that's different.

1021
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,680
They don't make men like you anymore.

1022
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,430
What is their modus operandi?

1023
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,050
They have a wicked mind.

1024
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:16,680
Didn't tell me anything.

1025
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,350
It's in our genes.

1026
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,970
Runs in our blood.

1027
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:22,720
And every inch of our body.

1028
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,850
In the entire family.

1029
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,300
Sir, Sikku and everyone else mustbe waiting in the premiere room...

1030
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,930
...we called them at 12 sharp.

1031
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,760
Coming, Raghu, coming.

1032
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:04,220
And the blind school peopleare here for the donation.

1033
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:07,010
Just fill in the name.

1034
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,680
Yes, Khanna, what's the update?

1035
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,510
Shamsher sir...

1036
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,680
You let a cat loose amongst pigeons.

1037
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:20,680
All the politiciansare ready for a meeting.

1038
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,430
Great.

1039
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,100
So we meet exactly after 8 days.

1040
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,430
Yes, sir.

1041
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:27,720
So...

1042
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:32,930
The street layout of theSRL bank is on this digital screen.

1043
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,010
Okay.

1044
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,050
Uncle, I've only one condition.

1045
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,800
This heist will be onlycarried out by family.

1046
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,510
Better, much better.

1047
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,720
Correct, dad.

1048
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,760
Family members will do it together.

1049
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,010
Yeah, bro.

1050
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,850
We'll steal the harddisk on Saturday night.

1051
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:53,100
This is SRL Bank,and here's the basement.

1052
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,350
Sorry, dad. I am hungry.

1053
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,720
The locker room's inthe basement of the SRL bank.

1054
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,100
The hard disk is in locker no. 7003.

1055
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,430
There's a nightclubadjacent to the bank.

1056
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,970
There's a drainage thatconnects the nightclub...

1057
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,050
...and this bank's wall.

1058
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,100
Sorry!

1059
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,100
Suraj, Sanjana, Yash.

1060
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:35,800
You three will arrive in Cambodiaon Saturday night by flight.

1061
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:42,930
Here you'll find a yellow vanin the airport's parking lot.

1062
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,350
Yellow van, guys.

1063
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,100
How tacky.

1064
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,970
Twins, just hear him out, guys.

1065
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,350
We are listening.

1066
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,050
And Yash, we are born winners.

1067
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,220
Even if you two run alone in a race,you'll still come second.

1068
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,510
Understand?

1069
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,720
And I'll arrive inCambodia by helicopter.

1070
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,390
Give me your hand please.

1071
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,350
Don't worry,I am not proposing to you.

1072
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:31,140
That hurts.

1073
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,350
Good.

1074
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:46,640
Please...

1075
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,760
Doesn't matter, your loss.

1076
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:52,640
- This is a micro-fluid tracking device.- Show me.

1077
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,550
Through this, we can track each other.

1078
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,930
Micro-fluid tracking device.

1079
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:58,100
Nonsense.

1080
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,760
Think twice beforeyou ask for my hand again.

1081
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,680
I guess Cambodia's getting to you.

1082
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:07,220
Your humor's getting better

1083
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,680
- Weirdo.- Let's go.

1097
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:46,100

"I've been thinking about you."

1107
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,180
"I've been thinking about you."

1108
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,350
"I'm always lost in your thoughts..."

1109
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,220
"It's your fault that I keepsaying this over and over again."

1110
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,760
"I'm always lost in your thoughts..."

1111

1116
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:18,180
"...you can't imaginewhat it's done to me."

1117
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,550
"...you can't imaginewhat it's done to me."

1118
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:29,640

1121
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,140
"Your beloved..."

1122
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:58,640
"My day starts with you,and ends too."

1123
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,350
"Even All the bookscan't describe you."

1124
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:06,100
"You quietly stole my heart."

1125
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:09,800

01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:53,220
"I've been thinking about you."

1137
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,430
"I've been thinking about you."

1138
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:00,720
"I've been thinking about you."

1139
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:23,180
Let's go.

1140
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,680
See you later.

1141
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:31,510
No... Help me, please...

1142
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,220
Move.

1143
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,100
Come fast.

1144
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:22,640
Move.

1145
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:24,350
Dad.

1146
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,720
Suraj.

1147
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,140
Your hard disk.

1148
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,100
God job.

1149
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,300
I knew I could trust Sikander.

1150
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,050
Great. Great.

1151
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:42,970
Let's have a party tomorrow.

1152
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,680
Sure, dad.I'll get it organized.

1153
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,430
Where are the others?

1154
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:47,300
Sikku's taking the long way home.

1155
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,850
He'll arrive tomorrow evening.

1156
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,970
And as for Yash and Sanjana.

1157
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,470
They will be herein a couple of hours.

1158
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,790
Whose calling? Jessica?

1159
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,200
Dad's calling.

1160
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:13,080
Dad?

1161
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,500
Yes... your dad.

1162
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,910
He's trying to make a video call.

1163
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,040
Should I answer it?

1164
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,500
Dad and all, huh.

1165
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,500
Why don't you tell him about us first?

1166
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,700
I know.

1167
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,330
I feel bad about it.

1168
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,540
Once we're out of this stress...

1169
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:31,120
...then I'll talk to Suraj and dad.

1170
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:33,750
I love you, Yash.

1171
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,450
What are you thinking?

1172
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:41,910
You know what...

1173
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:45,200
The way you pulledoff this entire plan...

1174
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,700
I am shocked.

1175
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,580
Why?

1176
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:53,540
A; You planted Jessicain Sikander's life.

1177
01:30:54,370 --> 01:31:00,910
B; On your instructions, she toldSikander that Suraj and I planted her.

1178
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,330
And the best part...

1179
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,870
C; That smart-alec gotso engrossed in all this,...

1180
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:10,080
...that he never suspected about you.

1181
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,160
Genius, huh!

1182
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,450
Rana? Why is he calling you?

1183
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,790
Chill, Sanjana.

1184
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,450
In our business,the fewer the enemies we have...

1185
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,120
...the more our business grows.

1186
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,790
Cambodia is Rana's fortress.

1187
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:32,500
I can have Sikanderkilled right there.

1188
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,450
But your mother's Will saved him.

1189
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,450
Mother's will?

1190
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,950
There's a clause which states that...

1191
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:41,750
...if any one of you diesan unnatural death,...

1192
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,870
...then his share will go to charity.

1193
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,700
- Oh no.- And I can't let that happen.

1194
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:49,160
But there's only onething that's bothering me.

1195
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,700
Jessica. She knows everything.

1196
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,040
Jessica. Jessica.

1197
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:58,250
How much do you make ina year by conning people?

1198
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:03,450
$300,000.

1199
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,950
I'll give you one million.

1200
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:12,870
What's the job?

1201
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:14,750
Two things.

1202
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:19,200
One, you must do exactly as I say.

1203
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:22,790
Second, no questions.

1204
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,160
That's it?

1205
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,330
Deal.

1206
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,120
Job over, game over.

1207
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,330
Do I even know you, Yash?

1208
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:39,500
I always thought of youas a very loyal and honest man.

1209
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,950
I am...

1210
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:43,200
...but only for us.

1211
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,040
Nowadays, if you wantto live on your own terms...

1212
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,540
...you got to be a little selfish.

1213
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:13,410
"Come closer and hold my hands."

1214
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:21,830
"Walk with me and sit with me."

1215
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:41,290
"And share your thoughts with me."

1216
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:51,830
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1217
01:33:52,200 --> 01:34:00,870
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1218
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:10,330
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1219
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:30,540
"Don't ever...think..."

1220
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:39,540
"...that I am misleading you."

1221
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:51,160
"I know...that I am..."

1222
01:34:51,870 --> 01:34:59,200
"...no one to you."

1223
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:08,250
"But you've done...done so much for me."

1224
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:16,160
"And I have a rightto be selfish for... you."

1225
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:27,910
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1226
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:56,500
"There's a smile...on your face."

1227
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:04,160
"But why are your eyes...moist?"

1228
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:10,580
"I am very happy..."

1229
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:23,250
"...and yet...there's something lacking."

1230
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:34,160
"Let's fill this void forever."

1231
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:43,450
"Let's rely on each other."

1232
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:52,540
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1233
01:36:52,790 --> 01:37:01,660
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."

1234
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,830
- Hello.- Captain.

1235
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,500
I smell some good news.

1236
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,870
No worries,he will be here for 50 years.

1237
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:46,080
And if you want,I can kill him right now.

1238
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:49,120
No, no. Let him stay alive.

1239
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,290
- Soon you'll get the rest of your money.- Okay.

1240
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:57,790
God protects you...

1241
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,580
...and keeps you from all harm.

1242
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:04,410
Explaining.

1243
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,080
Now this.

1244
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:15,330
What happened?

1245
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:18,790
God protects you andkeeps you from all harm.

What?

1247
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:22,080
Explaining.

01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,500
Catch him.

01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:25,870
Everybody fire, go now.

1262
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,500
Perfect timing.

1263
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:30,160
If it wasn't for me...

1264
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,830
Then it would've been someone else.

1265
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,620
- Idiot.- Oh no.

1266
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,410
Sorry.

1267
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:46,750
What?

1268
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:48,410
Sorry.

1269
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:49,950
It's okay.

1270
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:55,040
So many obstacles and hurdles.When is this going to end, man?

1271
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,160
These hurdles and area part of the race of life.

1272
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,160
They start before we're born.

1273
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:04,500
But don't end after we die.

1274
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,540
Too deep. Bouncer.

1275
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:10,830
In short...

1276
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,410
I won't spare those rascals...

1277
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:16,160
...Whoever is bloodyresponsible for this.

1278
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:18,620
Oh no.

1279
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,370
Do I have to dress you up as well?

1280
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:22,620
Suit up. Wear your gear.

1281
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:25,540
Need some help.

1282
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,080
- Thanks.- Watch out.

1283
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,160
Okay, all set.

1284
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:51,290
Cheers.

1285
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,750
"We're coming back to the race."

1286
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:37,870
"You've pushed me too far away..."

1287
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:42,410
"...concealing allthe lies in your heart."

1288
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:46,500
"This comes straightfrom my wounded heart."

1289
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:50,410
"Wait and watch what'scoming for you."

1290
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,290
"This fake love...is your nature."

1291
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:59,330
"Every time...you kept betraying me."

1292
01:45:59,410 --> 01:46:07,950
"Your intoxication...is intoxicating."

1293
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:10,120
"Lord hear my plea..."

1294
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,200
"...my life's in danger again."

1295
01:46:12,290 --> 01:46:14,370
"This time its certain doom."

1296
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,450
"In your love."

1297
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,500
"Lord hear my plea..."

1298
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,500
"...my life's in danger again."

1299
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:22,660
"This time its certain doom."

1300
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,580
"In your love."

1301
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:35,370
"Lord hear my plea..."

1302
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:37,450
"...my life's in danger again."

1303
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,540
"This time its certain doom."

1304
01:46:39,830 --> 01:46:41,950
"In your love."

1305
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,950
"Life has brought youto a crossroad again."

1306
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:52,290
"Soon you'll be freefrom the bonds of this world."

1307
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,410
"You'll pay for your crimes."

1308
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,370
"I'll never spare you,nor will the Lord."

1309
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:04,370
"You're my obsession,my intoxication, and my desire."

1310
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,700
"My fascination is to get rid of you."

1311
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,500
"There's no way for you to run..."

1312
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:12,910
"...I have my eyes on you."

1313
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,160
"I want to ruin you,and that's my resolution."

1314
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:25,870
"Your intoxication...is intoxicating."

1315
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:27,950
"Lord hear my plea..."

1316
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,120
"...my life's in danger again."

1317
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,200
"This time its certain doom."

1318
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:34,290
"In your love."

1319
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:36,410
"Lord hear my plea..."

1320
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,500
"...my life's in danger again."

1321
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,660
"This time its certain doom."

1322
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,500
"In your love."

1323
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:44,500
"Life on the line..."

1324
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:46,540
"We hold it down..."

1325
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,120
"They tired to break us...We never let'em.."

1326
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,160
"We never let'em.."

1327
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,830
"Just you and I..."

1328
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:55,250
"It's do or die.."

1329
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:59,620
"Ready forever"

1330
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:20,660
"We run this race race..."

1331
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:22,660
"Can't stop it, can't slow it down.."

1332
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:24,910
"We living for the chase chase.."

1333
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,830
"Hey we're on the run..."

1334
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:29,370
Ain't got no time for to waste"

1335
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:33,160
"We run this race race..."

1336
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:35,410
"Life on the line..."

1337
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,500
"We hold it down..."

1338
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,750
"They tired to break us...We never let'em.."

1339
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:41,660
"We never let'em.."

1340
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,790
"Just you and I..."

1341
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,790
"It's do or die.. Ready forever"

1342
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:50,080
"Ready forever"

1343
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:54,290
"Celebrate all you want tonight."

1344
01:48:54,370 --> 01:48:58,450
"Tomorrow you're mine."

1345
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:02,750
"Drink till you drop."

1346
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:06,790
"Tomorrow you're mine."

1347
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:08,790
"The race begins again."

1348
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:10,870
"And you better concentrate."

1349
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:13,450
"Enjoy all you want, because..."

1350
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:21,450
"We're coming back to the race."

1351
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,910
"We're coming back to the race."

1352
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:26,040
"Lord hear my plea..."

1353
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:28,160
"...my life's in danger again."

1354
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,370
"This time its certain doom."

1355
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:32,410
"In your love."

1356
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,330
"Lord hear my plea..."

1357
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:36,370
"...my life's in danger again."

1358
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:38,750
"This time its certain doom."

1359
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:43,120
- "In your love."- "We're coming back to the race."

1360
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,540
What am I hearing, Suraj?

1361
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:55,370
I don't know, dad. I swear.

1362
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:56,620
This is ridiculous.

1363
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:00,790
We're not responsible for whateverhappened with brother in Cambodia.

1364
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:01,830
And what's her name...

1365
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:03,250
Yeah, Jessica.

1366
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:04,830
What's this Jessica angle?

1367
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,080
There is no angle, dad.

1368
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:10,540
I can't figure out who putsthis filth in Sikander's mind?

1369
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,870
Okay, Suraj.

1370
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,200
You try to hide it your way...

1371
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,040
...and I'll find out my way.

1372
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:19,160
And if turns out to be true...

1373
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:21,580
...then you'll have to answer for it.

1374
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,950
And then I'll deal with it.

1375
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,580
Deal with what, dad?

1376
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:27,500
Do you even see us?

1377
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:32,330
I mean you can't see beyondyour blue-eyed boy Sikander.

1378
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:33,700
Sikku.

1379
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,750
Who will run the business?

1380
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:37,290
Sikku.

1381
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:39,410
Who will look afterthe administration?

1382
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,620
Sikku.

1383
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,790
Who's the smartest andmost intelligent amongst us?

1384
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,620
Sikku.

1385
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:48,450
I am sick of this Sikku, dad.

1386
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:51,830
But enough is enough.

1387
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:54,910
What's on your mind?

1388
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:57,080
What do you want?

1389
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:02,500
- Split.- Split?

1390
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,370
We'll handle the business...

1391
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:13,410
...he can take his share and leave.

1392
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:16,120
We've no problem. But...

1393
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:18,450
...for good.

1394
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,750
You two will handle the business.You two?

1395
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,540
Exactly, dad.

1396
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,250
You always underestimate us.

1397
01:51:27,330 --> 01:51:28,370
What?

1398
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,450
Underestimate?

1399
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:33,910
I didn't expect this from you two.

1400
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,450
Expectations.

1401
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:41,370
Dad, you shouldn't betalking about expectations.

1402
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:43,620
I know what's good and what's bad.

1403
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,160
And as long as I am alive,there will be no split.

1404
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:49,160
Don't be so difficult, dad.

1405
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:52,040
Like you always said...

1406
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:54,540
Love grows when you share.

1407
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:56,120
I do...

1408
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:59,410
Love grows when you share,but not split.

1409
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:01,250
But dear...

1410
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,700
You could neither learnour language nor the emotion.

1411
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:07,200
I trust Sikander completely.

1412
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,040
And until this deal isn't sealed,you two won't mess things up.

1413
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:12,620
Is that clear?

1414
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:15,290
Is that clear?

1415
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,870
- Sure, dad.- Yes, dad.

1416
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,830
Mr. Goel called from the bank.

1417
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,500
He's sanctioned theloan against our property.

1418
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:27,540
You three will signthe bank documents.

1419
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:28,790
Goodnight.

1420
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,830
Sad. Very sad.

1421
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:45,540
Unfortunately...

1422
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,750
There's no cure for stupidity.

1423
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:30,540
What's the matter, uncle?

1424
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:32,790
You're still awake.

1425
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,790
Thinking about home?

1426
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:41,040
Shall I get Calmposeor Restyl for you?

1427
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,500
You're my Restyl and Calmpose.

1428
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:48,250
Come, nephew.Walk with me.

1429
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:56,200
I never imagined thosetwo hated you so much.

1430
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,830
What should I do withthis bloody power and money?

1431
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:04,540
Should I shove it up my...locker.

1432
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:07,500
Now I am completely determined.

1433
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,250
I just want to seal thisdeal and go back to Handiya.

1434
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:13,040
This deal isn't going anywhere, uncle.

1435
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,330
But can I give you an advice.

1436
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:19,500
You handled thismatter completely wrong.

1437
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:25,750
If you give so much love and alwaysbe partial to me in front of them...

1438
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:29,500
...then obviously,those two are bound to hate me.

1439
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:33,830
You're absolutely right, Sikku.

1440
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:36,830
I wish I had realized this earlier...

1441
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,540
...then my familywould've never split up.

1442
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,660
This family will never split up.

1443
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,080
This is my challenge.

1444
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:49,370
Our family will neversplit up or scatter.

1445
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,370
Relax uncle...I am always there for you.

1446
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,640
Hey, Jessica.What are you doing here?

1447
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:09,890
The job's done.

1448
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:13,600
When are you planning to end my game?

1449
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,600
Isn't that what Yash said,...

1450
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,260
...on the yacht?

1451
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,600
Bugs.

1452
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:25,350
And, not the ones that bite.

1453
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:29,550
Micro transmitters. For listening.

1454
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,050
- Listen...- No, you listen, sweetheart.

1455
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:35,300
You and Yash hired me becauseyou two thought I am a con woman.

1456
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:37,010
That was my cover.

1457
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,720
But I am a government agent.

1458
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:48,800
I have a full briefon your entire family.

1459
01:55:48,890 --> 01:55:52,430
I came here to investigatethe illegal distribution of arms.

1460
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:55,510
But it was a completelydifferent ballgame out here.

1461
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,430
Hard Disks.

1462
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:59,350
Politicians blackmailed.

1463
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:01,680
Big money.

1464
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,390
Relax.

1465
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:09,350
Your family's secretsare safe with me.

1466
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,010
Cheers.

1467
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:28,760
Ouch!

1468
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:38,640
Yash, leave.

1469
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:39,680
Yash.

1470
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:42,260
Stop it!

1471
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,600
How much do you want?

1472
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:49,640
Have you lost it, Yash?

1473
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:51,430
You're not paying this damn woman.

1474
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,260
Sanjana, please.

1475
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:55,350
Don't behave like your brother.

1476
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,430
Let's just get over with this.

1477
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,180
Speak.

1478
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,640
I want $50 million.

1479
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,050
In bearer bonds.

1480
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:05,600
Tomorrow at 12...

1481
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,800
...leave the bag underthe Marina Lamppost.

1482
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:10,550
And don't be late.

1483
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,600
Or else it's game over for all of you.

1484
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,930
- Sam.- Yes, sir.

1485
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,350
As soon as Jessica orone of her men grab the bag...

1486
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,600
...follow them.

1487
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,720
Sir, here are the mortgage paper.

1488
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:55,510
Please sign them.

1489
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:59,390
I'll just inform the head office.

1490
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,930
The funds will be transferredto your account in half an hour.

1491
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:04,050
Thank you.

1492
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:05,600
This sucks man.

1493
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,850
- Yes, Khanna.- Shamsher sir,...

1494
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:15,680
...the politicians have arrived.

1495
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:17,140
Okay.

1496
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:18,600
We'll be there in half an hour.

1497
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,600
Shamshu, complete!

1498
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,010
Complete!

1499
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:49,550
You know, son.

1500
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,220
There's a saying in Handiya.

1501
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:55,050
"Nothing happens before time."

1502
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:58,930
I am truly overwhelmedtoday by your gesture.

1503
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:00,720
This story which began years ago...

1504
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,760
...is finally comingto an end because of you.

1505
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,550
What to do, Bhaiji?

1506
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,140
Every time I look in your eyes...

1507
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:13,890
...I can't help but miss my father.

1508
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:17,220
I did all this for my family.

1509
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:20,430
And, if I've to kill for my family...

1510
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,220
...I won't hesitate.

1511
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,640
Come on.

1512
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:44,640
Sikander deserves all the praise.

1513
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:49,390
He's pure gold.

1514
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:51,300
Pure gold.

1515
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,640
I wish he was my son.

1516
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:11,550
History has a bad habit, Raghu.

1517
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:15,010
It always repeats itself.

1518
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:24,390
Poor son died thesame way his father did.

1519
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:31,430
Brother must be really happyto finally meet his son today.

1520
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:33,600
God bless their souls.

1521
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:37,140
Let's go, Raghu.

1522
02:01:37,970 --> 02:01:40,140
The politicians must be waiting.

1523
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:46,350
"Sweety..."

1524
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:56,390
All good, dad.

1525
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:00,760
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1526
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:02,850
Please stand up.

1527
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,260
Some time back, my nephew Sikander...

1528
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:11,550
...whom I loved like my son...

1529
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:16,300
...unfortunately died in a car accident.

1530
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:20,930
One minute of silence, please.

1531
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,930
Thank you, gentlemen.

1532
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,390
But the show must go on.

1533
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:42,600
Please be seated.

1534
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:45,890
I'll come straight to the point.

1535
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:50,180
In exchange for the videos...

1536
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:55,930
...I want 25,000 sq.ft of sez area in each of your state...

1537
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:59,600
...where I can shipmy arms as well as drugs.

1538
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:02,510
- What is he talking about?- Cocaine.

1539
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,260
Meow Meow. MDMA.

1540
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:09,390
Mandrakes.Etcetera. Etcetera. Etcetera.

1541
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,930
Come, kiddo. Come.

1542
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:20,220
Meet, Rana. My new business partner.

1543
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,260
Come.

1544
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:25,970
Only fools butt headsin a profitable business.

1545
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,300
Isn't it, Raghu?

1546
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,640
Give them the details of the deal.

1547
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:34,930
Everyone knows thatdrugs are very harmful.

1548
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:40,140
But their demand keepsrising at 300% every year.

1549
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:43,760
Just imagine the amountof money we can make.

1550
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:50,140
And you'll get $50 millionevery year for this job.

1551
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:53,220
Yash.

1552
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:55,350
Now you take over.

1553
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:58,140
Show them this hard disk.

1554
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:00,600
It will make it easierfor them to make a decision.

1555
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:01,970
Come, come.

1556
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,350
Rana, let's celebrate ourbusiness partnership together.

1557
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:10,800
Sikander.

1558
02:04:11,470 --> 02:04:12,800
Mom.

1559
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:15,140
My son.

1560
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,890
By the time you get this tape,...

1561
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:23,550
...you would've turned 25.

1562
02:04:25,890 --> 02:04:28,180
I have faith in my blood.

1563
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,140
You'll fulfill thetask that I will give you.

1564
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:40,640
Your father wasn't killedby any politician of Handiya...

1565
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:47,010
...in fact he was murdered byour distant relative Shamsher Singh.

1566
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:52,930
The same Shamsher Singh...

1567
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,850
...whom your fathertreated as his brother.

1568
02:04:57,470 --> 02:05:02,760
I was pregnant whenyour father passed away.

1569
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:09,300
Pregnant with Suraj and Sanjana.

1570
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:21,220
I trusted ShamsherSingh and came to Al Shifa.

1571
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:25,760
After Suraj and Sanjana were born,I found out that...

1572
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:30,180
...Shamsher Singh was the mastermindbehind the entire conspiracy.

1573
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,930
Now he's slow poisoning me.

1574
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,600
But before I die,I've made an impenetrable Will...

1575
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:45,470
...so that Shamsher Singhcannot harm my children.

1576
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,850
You're the eldest of your siblings,Sikander.

1577
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:53,010
I entrust you with the responsibilityof saving our family.

1578
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,890
My blessings are with you.

1579
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:05,050
How did this videoget on this hard disk?

1580
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:06,640
How?

1581
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,050
Yash!

1582
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,050
Sit down.

1583
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:28,760
Sit down!

1584
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:36,430
Now that you know thatyou're not my children.

1585
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:39,930
I'll tell you I did this for my child.

1586
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:41,720
My kid.

1587
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:47,680
My real son...

1588
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,010
Is Yash.

1589
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:55,100
- Lets go- I am going to kill you guys.

1590
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:56,300
Both of you.

1591
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:57,720
I am going to kill you.

1592
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,850
By signing the mortgage papersyou've already failed your mom's Will.

1593
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:05,180
For me, you'll are finished.

1594
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:09,600
We're so unfortunate.

1595
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:12,800
We treated our brother like an enemy.

1596
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:16,600
And our real enemy as our father.

1597
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,760
Missing your brother, are you?

1598
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:22,350
Why don't I send you two to him?

1599
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,050
Suraj!

1600
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:57,640
I am really missing Sikku today.

1601
02:07:58,430 --> 02:08:00,430
I wish brother was here...

1602
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:23,050
You wished...

1603
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:28,600
God protects you andkeeps you from all harm.

1604
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,890
Missed you, bro.

1605
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:33,890
- We missed you.- Missed you too.

1606
02:08:33,970 --> 02:08:36,850
I can't leave you twoalone for even a moment.

1607
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,510
Why do you look so surprised?

1608
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:43,640
Did you see a ghost, bhaiji?

1609
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:45,800
Give me some time.

1610
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:49,760
All my life I called you Bhaiji.

1611
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:53,300
It will take sometime to call you rascal.

1612
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:56,180
Rascal.

1613
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:01,470
I've known the truthfor the past 10 years.

1614
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,930
And in these 10 years...

1615
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:07,760
And every day,every moment, I died many deaths.

1616
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:11,300
Every time you caressed my cheeks...

1617
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:17,390
...it would remind me howmy mother suffered to death.

1618
02:09:18,890 --> 02:09:20,600
Every time you sang...

1619
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:32,890
...it would remind mehow you killed my father.

1620
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,850
And whenever you hugged me...

1621
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,600
...it would remind me...

1622
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:46,510
...how you kept us,brothers and sister, apart.

1623
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:54,640
And you...

1624
02:09:56,010 --> 02:09:58,180
...let your father's love corrupt you.

1625
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:00,680
Sikander...

1626
02:10:02,510 --> 02:10:03,720
...there are two ways.

1627
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:05,600
First...

1628
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:07,760
When your kin makes a mistake,...

1629
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,140
...you leave him.

1630
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:12,220
Second...

1631
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:14,430
Even if your kin makes a mistake,...

1632
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:17,350
...don't ever leave him.

1633
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:20,260
And you decided not to leave him.

1634
02:10:20,970 --> 02:10:23,800
Your job is to takerevenge for your family.

1635
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:28,600
And my job is to protect my father.

1636
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:30,600
Wait...wait...wait...

1637
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:34,930
Son...stop this stupid melodrama.

1638
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:37,260
Sikander knows...

1639
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:43,930
I never do anything without insurance.

1640
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:49,300
What have you done, Raghu?

1641
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,300
It contains 50 grams of gelatin...

1642
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:53,430
...and I've alreadypressed the detonator.

1643
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:55,220
I know.

1644
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:56,890
Sexy uncle.

1645
02:10:58,470 --> 02:11:04,890
I've been looking for an opportunityto repay your father's debts.

1646
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:06,510
And today I got one.

1647
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:12,680
And for the first time, youaddressed this man by his right name.

1648
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,180
Rascal.

1649
02:11:16,850 --> 02:11:18,390
Sikander.

1650
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:21,300
He was offering you paradise.

1651
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:27,180
- But you kept chasing after hell.- Raghu!

1652
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:31,390
- Let's go together.- Raghu!

1653
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,720
Is this what you call insurance?

1654
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:43,260
This wealth, the weapons, drugs!

1655
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:44,970
I see... And for you?

1656
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:47,850
Family. Humanity. Love.

1657
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,710
Go.

1658
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:55,170
Cover from all sides.

1659
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,800
Cover from all sides.

1660
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:01,170
Team 2; Z-formation.

1661
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:29,920
Block him. Block him.

1662
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:31,880
All eyes on Sikander.

1663
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:30,340
So what were you saying?

1664
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:33,090
I should avenge my family.

1665
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:35,380
And you'll protect your father.

1666
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:36,920
So protect your father.

1667
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:39,420
This is the time, bro.

1668
02:23:01,460 --> 02:23:02,630
Why did you save me?

1669
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:04,800
What you did to us was wrong.

1670
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:07,380
In fact very wrong.

1671
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:11,380
But you did it towin your father's love.

1672
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,670
But I know...

1673
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:18,630
...you must be feeling worse than me.

1674
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:22,170
And what's the pointin punishing someone...

1675
02:23:23,710 --> 02:23:25,420
...who has alreadyrealized his mistake?

1676
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:27,090
Never again.

1677
02:23:29,250 --> 02:23:30,170
Come on.

1678
02:24:11,590 --> 02:24:13,420
Remember what I said.

1679
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:19,590
Our family will neverBreak up or split.

1680
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:22,840
There's another thing I said to you.

1681
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:27,550
I will send you back to your home.

1682
02:24:27,630 --> 02:24:30,960
With respect, to Handiya.

1683
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:33,380
Take him.

1684
02:24:42,590 --> 02:24:46,710
Son, this isn't over yet.

1685
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:48,840
I know.

1686
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:53,710
But your chapter's over.

1687
02:24:57,050 --> 02:24:58,550
Take him outta here, baby.

1688
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:08,340
There's still time.

1689
02:25:45,710 --> 02:25:48,380
I know you all have alot of doubts in your mind.

1690
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:50,800
And questions too.

1691
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,090
Bring it on.

1692
02:25:53,250 --> 02:25:54,420
How did you do this?

1693
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:57,000
I mean how did you know that...

1694
02:25:57,090 --> 02:25:58,840
...that Yash has planted Jessica.

1695
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,800
Because Suraj and Sanjanawere never so close to me to know...

1696
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:09,170
...that I always hide aspy cam along with the money.

1697
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:11,800
Bad habit,but now I'll take another name.

1698
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:13,550
Shoot.

1699
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:17,130
And that name is Yash.

1700
02:26:17,210 --> 02:26:20,090
But that hard disk was always with me.

1701
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:21,800
Fake hard disk.

1702
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:55,800
And what about the money thatJessica blackmailed us for.

1703
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:57,460
Cheers.

1704
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:03,420
Jessica's money is nowback along with Jessica.

1705
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:06,710
I have an offer for you.

1706
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:09,130
This is Johnny's hard disk.

1707
02:27:09,630 --> 02:27:11,800
- And you must unlock it.- And my money?

1708
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,750
Here is $50 million in bearer bonds.

1709
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:17,800
And mom's video?

1710
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:21,960
Here.

1711
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,340
What is this?

1712
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:26,130
Your mother asked meto give you this today.

1713
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:28,250
Take a look.

1714
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:36,880
Sexy uncle.

1715
02:27:59,420 --> 02:28:00,460
What a man.

1716
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:04,130
So this was your plan all along.

1717
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:09,880
It was always my planto keep my family close.

1718
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,500
What can I say, officer?

1719
02:28:16,590 --> 02:28:20,130
I've done some thingswhich I am not proud of.

1720
02:28:20,460 --> 02:28:23,250
I killed my brother,killed my sister-in-law.

1721
02:28:23,670 --> 02:28:25,800
Syphoned from my own children.

1722
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:28,840
Pushed my son down the wrong path.

1723
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,590
How can a father do somethinglike this to own his son?

1724
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,500
And all that for what?

1725
02:28:35,380 --> 02:28:36,460
Money?

1726
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,050
Power?

1727
02:28:38,250 --> 02:28:39,800
But where is that money?

1728
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:41,420
That power?

1729
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:46,630
All that gets left behind, officer.All of it.

1730
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:49,000
Anyway...

1731
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:54,460
I've heard that your wifeShakuntala hasn't been keeping well.

1732
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,840
She has a problem with her kidney.

1733
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:58,800
And she's on dialysis.

1734
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:01,500
And your daughter, Kusum, isn't it?

1735
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,800
She wants to be a doctor.

1736
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:09,000
The medical seat would easily costyou at least 10 or 20 million rupees.

1737
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:13,050
And I also heard you'reretiring in 6 months.

1738
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,590
Think about your family.

1739
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,880
This race isn't over yet.

1740
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:24,420
Because Shamsher is still...

1741
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:28,630
...alive.

1742
02:29:59,250 --> 02:30:00,960
So there's going to be another 'race'.

1743
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:03,630
Of course.

1744
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:04,750
- But...- But...

1745
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:06,840
Who will be the Sikander of that race?

1746
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,800
The Sikander of that race...

1747
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:13,710
How would I know?

1748
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:16,750
- Cheers.- Cheers.

1749
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,050
Cheers, Sikander.

1750
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:35,920
"Race."

1751
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,960
"R A C E."

1752
02:30:50,050 --> 02:30:53,210
"We'll be coming back to the race."

1753
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:55,090
"I am completely ruined."

1754
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:56,750
"Intoxication..."

1755
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:59,800
- "I've been thinking about you."- "We'll be coming back to the race."

1756
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:02,750
"You can't imaginewhat it's done to me."

1757
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:03,800
"Your."

1758
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,960
"I've been thinking about you."

1759
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:06,710
"Come on."

1760
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,590
"Everybody party hard."

1761
02:31:08,670 --> 02:31:10,420
"We're going to dance all night."

1762
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,250
"Don't stop drinkingtill you're high."

1763
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:14,000
"Take my advice..."

1764
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:16,050
"...we're gonna keep drinking..."

1765
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:17,840
"...and won't stop until we drop."

1766
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,750
"Let's go baby on the floor."

1767
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:21,750
"Let me love you more and more."

1768
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:25,460
"I can feel my breath..."

1769
02:31:25,710 --> 02:31:29,170
"...you're right here and so am I."

1770
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:32,920
"It's not as important as you think."

1771
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:36,630
"This is your chance,to prove yourself."

1772
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:40,420
"Celebrate all you want tonight."

1773
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,050
"Tomorrow you're mine."

1774
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:47,880
"Drink till you drop."

1775
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:51,630
"Tomorrow you're mine."

1776
02:31:51,710 --> 02:31:54,840
"Sweetheart..."

1777
02:31:55,250 --> 02:31:57,880
"Sweetheart...since I got high on you..."

1778
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:01,380
"...you can't imaginewhat it's done to me."

1779
02:32:01,630 --> 02:32:04,800
"...you can't imaginewhat it's done to me."

1780
02:32:06,710 --> 02:32:12,250
"Sweetheart...since I got high on you..."

1781
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:16,000
"...your beloved's completely ruined."

1782
02:32:16,090 --> 02:32:17,500
"Lord hear my plea..."

1783
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:19,840
"I am completely ruined."

1784
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:21,420
"In your love."

1785
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:23,590
"I am completely ruined."

1786
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:25,170
"Lord hear my plea..."

1787
02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:27,340
"I am completely ruined."

1788
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:29,550
"In your love."

1789
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:34,340
"I've been thinking about you."

1790
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:37,710
Let the party go on-and-on."

1791
02:32:39,590 --> 02:32:41,840
"I've been thinking about you."

1792
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:52,750
"I Found Love."

1793
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:59,960
"I Found Love."

1794
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:02,050
"I found it in you."

1795
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:05,630
"The intoxication in the air..."

1796
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,380
"...is getting me high."
