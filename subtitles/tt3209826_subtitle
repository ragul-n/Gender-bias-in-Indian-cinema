1
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,963
'From India's western coast'

2
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,329
'comes a simple story.‘

3
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,532
'The land of gathiya,
garba and Gandhi.‘

4
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:21,005
'No, sir.
This isn't a story from Gujarat.‘

5
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,633
'In fact, this housing society'

6
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,041
'is like a mini Gujarat
right in the city of Mumbai.‘

7
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:31,076
'The Gujaratis
are cocky by nature.‘

8
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,581
'Be it Manhattan or Mumbai,‘

9
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:36,182
'it's like they're carrying a
portable Gujarat wherever they go.‘

10
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:39,156
'Dipti, Jigna, Dipesh are the names

11
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:40,282
that reverberate 'in this
Gujarati neighborhood.‘

12
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,459
'Now amid all this lives a family'

13
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,595
'dripping with courtesy, culture
and clarified butter.‘

14
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,429
'The Hasmukh Patel house,'

15
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,002
'nestled in the cold storage
of culture and values.'

16
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:56,164
Here's your half a kilo of wheat.
Hold on a second.

17
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:02,105
Come on, Mr Patel,
four extra grains won't kill you.

18
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:04,442
Sir, I'm doing this for you.
- For me?

19
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,677
Of course.
Because you're such a virtuous man

20
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,351
you can't digest
even a single ill-gotten grain.

21
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:11,581
These are four grains.
Too much sin to handle, right?

22
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:16,049
For every Gujarati,
business is next to righteousness.

23
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,527
It's not about money, you know.

24
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:19,962
That will be 34 rupees.
Here you go, ma'am.

25
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,090
Let's go, Raksha.

26
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,378
Sir.
- Hmm?

27
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,283
Stop dreaming and
focus on your business.

28
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:48,190
Mark my words, boy. Someday, I'll
start Patel Supermarket right here.

29
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,625
Hold your dreams

30
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,252
for you have a housing society
meeting to attend.

31
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,456
Is it today?
- Of course.

32
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:55,199
Mr Patel,
you've got a letter from Canada.

33
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,733
l've warned you umpteen times
not to hand me this letter!

34
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,204
Sir, you need to calm down.
Let's go.

35
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:25,995
Hail...
- Glory to Gujarat!

36
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:35,235
My friends, I've brought you
today a special gift from Gujarat.

37
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,172
Ghaari from Surat.
- No way.

38
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,005
Red chillis from Gondal?

39
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:42,639
Shouldn't we Gujaratis think about
something else than food?

40
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:47,344
I bring you the soil of Gujarat.

41
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:53,314
We have to spread this soil
in our courtyard.

42
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,049
Here.

43
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:03,332
Who pays the most taxes in India?

44
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,502
The Gujaratis.
- You are right.

45
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,970
Who built the Rajabai
Tower in Mumbai?

46
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,529
The workers, of course.

47
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:12,134
Damn! Who paid the workers?

48
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:15,336
The Gujaratis.
- Yes!

49
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:19,349
Who made 'Raja Harishchandra'
the first movie in India?

50
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,009
Dadasaheb Phal ke.

51
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,586
But he was a Maharashtrian.

52
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,679
Who financed Phalke?

53
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,289
He was financed
by Mayashankar Bhatt

54
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,122
who was a Gujarati.

55
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:33,090
We have Goddess Amba as well as
the industrialist Ambani.

56
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,530
Hail Gujarat!

57
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,229
Someday, Gujarat will
take on China singlehandedly.

58
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,702
ln producing children?

59
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:43,963
ln producing jobs and business,
do you get it?

60
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,439
Yet, there's a big trouble
looms large over us.

61
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:50,606
TVchannels, e-mail, Facebook, Twitter.

62
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:54,118
These new age things
are attacking our culture

63
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:57,644
and we must save our culture
and defend our pride against them.

64
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,717
Like you know,

65
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,958
we don't allow liquor and meat in
the Adarsh Gujarati Society.

66
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,632
We will never allow flirting

67
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,029
and whistling in
this society either.

68
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,898
What about the cooker whistle?

69
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,910
Cooking is fine, but no looking.

70
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:22,135
And very important thing.

71
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:26,681
We won't let Western channels on
our TVs that promote their culture.

72
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:29,610
Come on, man!
- No English channels! You got it?

73
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:31,380
Morons!

74
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,389
Come on, grandma! Yo!

75
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,153
Yo, grandma!

76
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,957
What a fabulous speech!

77
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,496
Straight from the Red Fort.

78
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:46,629
Why are you acting like
a traffic cop all of a sudden?

79
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,465
Ramdev Baba says

80
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:51,441
that these exercises keep
all the diseases away.

81
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:52,598
Why don't you try?

82
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,305
Ramdev Baba on MTV?

83
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,007
For today.

84
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,949
Aren't you too old to watch MTV?

85
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,988
You should watch channels
like Aastha, Sanskar.

86
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:06,283
We got two young girls
in our house. Try to understand.

87
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:07,916
We got two daughters,

88
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,392
but we also got 90 channels.
- Enough.

89
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:13,227
Feast on "Naked TV" only for today.

90
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,923
I'm going to band
them from tomorrow.

91
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,297
But dad...
- Don't "daddy" me.

92
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:20,197
Gosh, you got some outdated ideas!

93
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,536
Every young girl's father
follow outdated ideas.

94
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,099
Till this day.

95
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,501
After all, she lost her mother.

96
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:33,008
Remember Pat Singh
who stormed into our lives

97
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,550
and turned our lives upside down
with his Punjabi beats.

98
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,246
How could you forget?

99
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:48,356
Hasmukh, you're still brooding over
Pat Singh.

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,689
Forget about it.

101
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,029
You should change with time.

102
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,234
You are snatching their freedom.

103
00:07:58,376 --> 00:07:59,365
Pooj a.

104
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:07,380
Hi. You are Kanu and I am Pooja.

105
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,955
You are a tortoise
and I'm a nobody.

106
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,114
Yet there's a lot
that's common to us.

107
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,355
The world is in fast and furious
mode, but we're painfully slow.

108
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,658
You can't speak

109
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,290
and I'm not allowed to speak.

110
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,234
You can live till hundred.

111
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:28,898
My life is already boring,
as if I've lived till hundred.

112
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:32,042
Pooja.
- Sister.

113
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,407
You are talking to Kanu again!

114
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:34,502
What are you doing?

115
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,170
I think Champaben
is more lucky than us.

116
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,309
She can at least roam around
all day.

117
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,250
See. You know what?

118
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:45,316
There is nothing like freedom.
Ting-tong.

119
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:50,220
You'll be all alone
after my marriage, right?

120
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,317
Right, Nimisha.

121
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,195
That's why I've decided that
I'll speak to dad today about that.

122
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,294
Pooj a.

123
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,197
Fashion design?

124
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,473
Dear, you are so naive.

125
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,375
Girls from decent families
don't choose this field.

126
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,607
Not allowed.
- But I'm bored, dad.

127
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,012
I've finished my BA
through correspondence.

128
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:15,583
What should I do in my life?

129
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,985
Get married.

130
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,216
Listen to me.

131
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:22,088
These three things are
very important in a girl's life.

132
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,219
Look, book and cook.

133
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:25,657
You are good at all three of them.

134
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,497
Dad, may I ask you something?
- Hmm.

135
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,028
When I was born

136
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,105
and spoke for the first time,

137
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,033
did that make you happy?

138
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:41,172
Of course.

139
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:45,677
No. Either you lied
to yourself that day

140
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,613
or you're lying today.

141
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,013
That's not true, my dear.

142
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,420
What's so big deal about
fashion designing?

143
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,354
I wore pajama and
kurta all my life.

144
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,518
Did it kill me?

145
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,929
But the time is changing, dad.

146
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,161
l'll become a famous
fashion designer.

147
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:06,470
Celebrities and stars
will attend my show.

148
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,568
People will give me
a huge round of applause.

149
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,441
I'm sure, you will say,

150
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:14,001
"This is the right choice, baby."

151
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:21,013
Presenting the creations by

152
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:24,054
Ms Pooja Patel!

153
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,533
Stop it.
- Please.

154
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,340
Pooja Patel's ramp show
destroyed our culture.

155
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,971
Is it a fashion show
or a strip shovﬂ

156
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,107
Should we blame Pooja and
her family values for this?

157
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,241
No, my daughter is innocent!

158
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:55,618
What's wrong?

159
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,713
I won't let you pursue
fashion designing.

160
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,118
What's wrong with that?

161
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,128
I think the word "design"
is of Gujarati origin.

162
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,093
"Design" sounds like "Dishaheen".

163
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,462
That's aimless.

164
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,930
I won't let my daughter
become aimless.

165
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,196
My dear...

166
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,703
Don't let that spoil your mood.

167
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,274
Let's eat some 'khakra'.

168
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,673
Have some. It will cheer you up.

169
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:25,942
You knowl don't have anyone

170
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,175
but two daughters
to call my own.

171
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,721
We got a dandiya dance
in our society tonight.

172
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:34,681
Dandiya. Don't you want to play?

173
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,358
Quickly get ready.

174
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,220
Smile, my dear.

175
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,092
Please smile.

176
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:54,309
"Hey, Rupa, come upstairs,
I‘ve to go early."

177
00:11:55,546 --> 00:12:00,745
"My henna is burning up,
moonlight, stop shining."

178
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,680
"Your cool..."

179
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,346
"Your sweet..."

180
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:07,356
"Your cool soothing light
makes me restless."

181
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,586
"Moonlight, stop shining."

182
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:11,457
"My eyes..."

183
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,589
"My eyes say it all."

184
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,396
"Moonlight, stop shining."

185
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:30,176
"The courtyard seems desolate..."

186
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:43,255
"My father's affection stops me
at every step."

187
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,528
"Oh dear moon."

188
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,197
"My veil.."

189
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:55,570
My veil slips from my head,
moonlight, stop shining."

190
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,971
"Come on, everyone."

191
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:01,376
"1.. 2.. 3.. let‘s get free later."

192
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:05,439
"With the devotion towards
the powerful Goddess"

193
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:06,608
"the night illuminates bright."

194
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,242
"Residing in the skies."

195
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,183
"The ever green merciful."

196
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,585
"Goddess, bless us always."

197
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,589
"The oceans and the mountains"

198
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,319
"all of them bend at Your feet."

199
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:19,157
"Folding my hands,
I bow down to you."

200
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,495
"Empower me, mother goddess."

201
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,205
Driver!

202
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,470
How much more time, buddy?

203
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,980
Life, where are you taking me?

204
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,517
You should drive fast! ldiot!

205
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,959
Dude, how many times are you
going to call me in a day?

206
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,528
You're buying a second-hand car
and not the Taj Mahal.

207
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,165
No, you listen to me.

208
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,132
A second-hand car
dealers follows this:

209
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,137
Whatever we tell
you the first time,

210
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:02,570
we don't rewind it or remind it.

211
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,903
When you question us after
the deal, we do mind that.

212
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:07,968
Now put the damn phone down
and sign the check

213
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,274
and pick up the car.

214
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,945
Hold on, listen.

215
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,174
Don't forget to invite me
on your sister's wedding.

216
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:18,445
After all, I'm her ex-boyfriend.
I earned it.

217
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,148
He hung up on me.

218
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:26,488
Ah, the Mumbai girls! Come on.

219
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,463
Monty is coming to your town.

220
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,571
What's Mr Tandon saying?

221
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,498
Guggi says everything's just fine.

222
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,971
And Mr Tandon, what's your tale?

223
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:48,076
As long as you breathe,

224
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,551
keep driving.

225
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,110
Hail the Goddess!

226
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,484
Driver, move on.

227
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:55,455
Son of a gun! He's guzzling beers
on the car roof!

228
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,517
You aren't singing hymns
in the car, are you?

229
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,392
All right. Take a sip.

230
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:01,257
Good job!

231
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,426
Damn!

232
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:08,094
An old hag died!
When did that happen?

233
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,237
Hold on.

234
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:11,900
Just wait and watch.

235
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,281
Hello.

236
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:21,411

 just read the news
and it really broke my heart.

237
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:23,676
No one can avert the inevitable.

238
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,187
Sir, I'm afraid,
I didn't recognize you.

239
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,424
I am Guggi Tandon.

240
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,390
You might not know me,

241
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,990
but your mother adored me.

242
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,525
She'd call me "son", you know.

243
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,502
We were really close.

244
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,198
But now she is very close to God.

245
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,935
She was close to all of us.

246
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,937
But now the chapter is closed.

247
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,971
We can't help it.

248
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,139
Really?

249
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:52,511
You idiot!

250
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,177
You should've published
a nice photo of your mother.

251
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,153
She looks like a bloody cow
in the photo.

252
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,323
lf kids see such a horrible face
in the paper,

253
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:01,291
will you wipe their tears off?

254
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,324
How can you say that?

255
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,228
You should be ashamed of yourself.

256
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,361
Stop crying, you idiot!

257
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,191
Now listen to me.

258
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:14,363
Your mother lived till 90,

259
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,133
but you are mourning for her!

260
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:20,307
Life and death are
nothing but jokes.

261
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,375
Adopt this philosophy
and be happy for life.

262
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,179
Dude, give me a smile.

263
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,411
One smile coming up.

264
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:39,588
I brought a smile
to his crying face.

265
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,097
You are so sweet.

266
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,429
Of course.
- Sweet Guggi.

267
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:58,345
Shilpa brings shine to your face!
Ting-tong!

268
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,210
How do I look?

269
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:03,344
You look terrible.

270
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:04,979
What are you wearing?

271
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,422
We got a fancy dress competition.

272
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,559
I'm playing Heer from Heer-Ranjha.

273
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,555
Aren't you supposed to be Kasturba?

274
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:15,029
True. But Nimisha refused to
dress up as Gandhiji.

275
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,158
Why?
- She says,

276
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,930
she won't tonsure her head.

277
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,894
Nimisha.

278
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,438
People would give up their life
for Gandhiji

279
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,633
and you won't even cut your hair.

280
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,240
Dad, this is too much.

281
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:29,144
You could've become Meerabai

282
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,677
You could've become
the great Anusuya.

283
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,009
Hasuda, listen to me.

284
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:36,914
You are talking about
past and traditions.

285
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,353
Traditions?

286
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:41,324
That's different.
But you got to tie up your hair.

287
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,259
Come on.
- No, dad.

288
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:47,958
Ranjha fell for Heer only when
she tied up her hair. - Really?

289
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:49,993
Ranjha told you that on the phone,
didn't he?

290
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,125
Enough, mom.

291
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,099
Now go and tie up your hair.

292
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,231
Okay.
- She wants to be Heer.

293
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,399
No Ranjha is coming for her, right?

294
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:30,531
Tell you what, Heer is already on
the scene even before the hero.

295
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:45,111
Whoever utters "Sat Sri Akal"
- Shall get his wish fulfilled.

296
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:50,450
Greetings to you! You're
the first man I met in this colony

297
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,358
from this community.

298
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,922
Together, we'll raise the roof
and turn up the volume.

299
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,625
Sir, enough with slapping,
it hurts.

300
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,966
Who are you anyway?
- I am Guggi.

301
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:03,098
Gurpreet Singh Tandon
from Taran Taran, Punjab.

302
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,241
The sole proprietor of Guggi
Car Bazaar. Please keep my card.

303
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,379
This is my second half,
Pammi Tandon.

304
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:09,539
A 50-year-old model and yet

305
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,514
her average is
something to talk about.

306
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:15,074
We have women in this crowd,
just so you know. - Sorry.

307
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,642
Myself Monty Tandon.

308
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,249
Son of only father, Guggi Tandon.

309
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:21,051
What are you doing here?
Are you at the right address?

310
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:22,955
l have a card. Hold on.

311
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:27,630
Opposite Patel Provision Store,
Plot 100,

312
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,499
shop-cum-house.

313
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,969
That's my house.
Bring it on!

314
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,561
Bring it on!

315
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,436
Well, that reminds me! Bille.

316
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,306
Get them down, will you?

317
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,674
Prem is here. Prem.

318
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,079
I'm here to give you some "love".

319
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,178
Monty, did you bring a coconut?

320
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,952
Hold on.
How about this coconut rum?

321
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:58,261
lt's same.
- Like son, like father, Guggi.

322
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:00,329
You should've been never drunk
on our honeymoon, I warned you.

323
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,456
Get it from the provision store.

324
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,494
Where the hell is that grocer?
Hello. - Shut up.

325
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,093
Stop saying grocer, will you?

326
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:08,535
This is my store.
What do you want?

327
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,301
I didn't claim my father-in-law
owns this store, did I?

328
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,704
Come again.

329
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,010
This isn't a cricket match,
so expect no replays.

330
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,545
What do you want?
- Two coconuts.

331
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,945
Take it.

332
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:23,445
Hail the Goddess
who rides the tiger!

333
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,159
Relax, dude.
Wait for the offerings.

334
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,693
I want money, not the offerings.

335
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:31,655
Money?
- Yes.

336
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:32,593
Daddy.

337
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,096
You want to get paid before
getting the offering?

338
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,227
Punjabis are magnanimous
and generous!

339
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,327
Did I ever say l was a Punjabi?

340
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:44,440
Proud to be a Gujarati.

341
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,306
That's the trouble.

342
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,207
It's like cumin seeds in whiskey.

343
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,538
I thought you're a Punjabi
because of your daughter.

344
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:52,081
No, let me tell you

345
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:54,482
that there are only Gujaratis
in this society.

346
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,078
I thought people who
live here are only...

347
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:02,048
Soldiers?
- Not soldiers, but lndians.

348
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,128
Come on, dear.
- See you later.

349
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:10,693
Desai. - Who allowed Punjabis
in our society?

350
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,435
The IPL.
- Huh?

351
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,038
What's the connection?

352
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,939
Majethia lost everything
at lPL betting.

353
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:20,137
He sold off the bungalow to him
and flew to London.

354
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:22,270
Majethia didn't listen to us.

355
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,213
I tried to persuade him...
- One more Punjabi

356
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,613
breathing down our necks
after Pat Singh.

357
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,323
"King Khan, Yo, Yo Honey Singh."

358
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:44,267
"Twist your m ustache"

359
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:47,236
"Slip on the shades."

360
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,174
"Put lassi in the coconut."

361
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,109
"Come and let's the set mood."

362
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:56,044
"Twist your m ustache"

363
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,015
"Slip on the shades."

364
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,984
"Put lassi in the coconut."

365
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,715
"Come and let's the set mood."

366
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,588
"All the Rajani fans!"

367
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,593
"Don't miss that chance!"

368
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,521
What a bitch!

369
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:15,122
Never abuse your neighbors
so early on. Take your time.

370
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,157
She's really a bitch.

371
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:21,933
"Lungi dance! Lungi dance!"

372
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:24,372
"Lungi dance! Lungi dance!"

373
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,966
Stop the music! Listen!

374
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:28,605
Hasuda.
- Yes?

375
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:31,414
So many cars.

376
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:34,142
Looks like
our new neighbor is very rich!

377
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,515
Not really. He is a scrap dealer.

378
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,111
That's a second-hand car.

379
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,314
We'll sell them off any time.

380
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,684
Let me tell you something.

381
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:46,119
He'll demand 200,000
for this piece of junk.

382
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:49,188
We got the same car in the same
working condition.

383
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,962
We won't get 100,000 for it,
so nobody will pay him 200,000.

384
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,407
It doesn't look like our car.
It is our car.

385
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,441
Our car...

386
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,283
Out of the way, Fakir.
- Who?

387
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,009
Don't disturb me
when I'm doing business.

388
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:10,917
Sir.
- Yes?

389
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:11,955
What do you think of the car?

390
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:15,125
But 200,000 seems expensive.

391
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,184
Are you buying a car or shorts?

392
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:18,990
You just zip-zap-zoomed,
didn't you?

393
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,361
What's that?
- The test drive.

394
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:23,161
How can he test drive this car?

395
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,963
This is my car, the keys...
- Come on, dude.

396
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,334
Billa hot-wired the car.
Don't worry.

397
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,031
You'll get a good deal.

398
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,572
Sir.
- Sir.

399
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:35,942
Tell me something.
What's your dad's birthday?

400
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,338
2nd June 1933.

401
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,483
Really? What's the
license plate number?

402
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:43,179
MH02 F 1933.

403
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,383
Wow! Your dad's parked right here,
it's not a car.

404
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,515
Your dad's blessings.

405
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:49,081
Dad.
- 200,000.

406
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:52,061
Keep it. The deal's final.
Send the car home.

407
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:53,593
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

408
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:56,525
Congratulations are in order.
Your car's sold.

409
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,091
To hell with that!

410
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:00,126
Nobody asked you to sell my car.

411
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:02,705
Hasuda, sell the car.
Remember yesterday you said

412
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:03,995
that you'd sell the car
if you get 100,000.

413
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,531
Grandma's word is the law.

414
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:09,305
Your fortune smiles upon you,
but you frown at it.

415
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:11,211
Brother, have some sweets.
- No.

416
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,307
No, thanks. Give me the money.

417
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:15,611
Give me the money.
- Here is 100,000.

418
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,111
Why 100,000?
You sold the car for 200,000.

419
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,248
Won't you let your
son make 100,000?

420
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,484
Who is my son?

421
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:23,592
Monty is like a son to you.

422
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:26,095
Daddy!
- How come he is my son novﬂ

423
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:28,631
Grandma, give me your blessings.
- Bless you.

424
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,929
Come home in the evening
to eat 'undhiyo'.

425
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,025
I'll make some.
- Mom, go home.

426
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,101
Take her home! Undhiyo.

427
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,567
You sold the car for 200,000.
Just give me the money.

428
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:41,109
All right, here is 30 grand more.

429
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,076
The deal was done for 130,000.

430
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:44,942
Never let the poor to curse you.

431
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:47,951
I made cool 70,000.
- The Punjabi got a good deal.

432
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,347
He made 30,000 and I made 70,000.

433
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:54,521
I didn't pay 21,000 for the car
insurance. You should pay it.

434
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,651
Sol made 51,000

435
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,518
and you made 49,000.

436
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,123
That's how a Gujarati
closes a deal.

437
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,096
Daddy,
we got knocked in the first round.

438
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,190
Move it.

439
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:08,127
Here's the first Punjabi

440
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,935
who made a profit by selling
a Gujarati's car to a Bengali.

441
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,270
Yesterday, his son did pulled
a bike stunt

442
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:16,369
and today his dad juggled a car.

443
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,481
I wonder what he'll do tomorrow.

444
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:21,979
Dear me!

445
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,645
Thank you.
- Wish you the same.

446
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,083
Prem lal Tandon.

447
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:32,290
Your neighbor.
- I know.

448
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,189
The boy next door.

449
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:38,034
What's your age?

450
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:40,161
The old age.

451
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,067
Old age. The same batch.

452
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:46,208
Who is in your family?

453
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:49,339
A few kids and lots of diseases.

454
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:53,277
Kanta, I suffer from diabetes.

455
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:57,417
So sweet!
- That's what not allowed.

456
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,952
Do you have blood pressure?

457
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:04,987
No more since my husband died.

458
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:10,261
God's always right in His own ways.

459
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,068
Both of us are single

460
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,203
and ready to mingle.

461
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:24,069
Tell me a seven-letter word

462
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:25,638
It should mean love.

463
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:27,607
Dipesh, my fiance!

464
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,953
A seven-letter word for love.

465
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:33,320
What could it be?

466
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,590
Romance.
- Correct.

467
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:37,491
Correct.

468
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:40,361
I'm the right guy

469
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:43,093
and we're talking about the right
topic, so the answer is correct.

470
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,026
Greetings to you as well.

471
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,528
Here is your mail.
- Thank you, uncle.

472
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:52,931
Distance education? We share common
traits in terms of education.

473
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:55,274
I'm a dropout like you.

474
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,947
l'm famous for being promoted.

475
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,949
I studied 8 years
for a five-year course.

476
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:03,350
I'm a failure like you are.
- Excuse me.

477
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,385
I'm not a college dropout.

478
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,083
l was a class topper.
- Why didn't you go to college?

479
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,954
Because my dad doesn't let me.

480
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,016
You should go on your own.

481
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,959
Listen.
- Listen to me.

482
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:18,197
Don't let your parents get too
close, they can create problems.

483
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:21,362
Keep safe distance.
Distance. Watch this.

484
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:24,166
Distance learning, distance daddy.

485
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:27,500
Who the hell... Uncle...

486
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,042
Give me your blessings.
- Enough.

487
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:34,179
What do you want?
- Many things, since you ask...

488
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,945
Hey!

489
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:39,611
What do you want from the shop?

490
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,956
Do you have dog biscuits?

491
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:44,426
Will you eat it here
or should I pack it?

492
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:49,930
Next time, place the order on the phone
and I'll home deliver the goods.

493
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,933
Do you make the deliveries
or your young staff?

494
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:58,305
Dog! Sometimes we use dogs
to make deliveries.

495
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:02,073
That reminds me. We're hosting
a housewarming party tonight.

496
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,309
You're invited too
and also bring your family along.

497
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,458
Welcome, everybody! Welcome.
There you go!

498
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,564
Absolutely stunning!

499
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,194
Are we on a movie
set or we in a home?

500
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,237
Look at that naked girl.

501
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:32,335
We also got a naked tiger.
Nothing's fine.

502
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:33,535
Everything looks naked.

503
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:36,671
Hasuda, don't make faces.
I didn't abduct you here.

504
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:38,107
That's what it is.

505
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:42,077
Tandon called me ten times
since morning for the invitation.

506
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:43,309
Finally I had to say yes

507
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,150
else he would've drained
my cell phone's battery.

508
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:48,680
Patel, welcome, dude!
I didn't have your number.

509
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,324
I wanted to call you.

510
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:51,655
I'm glad you are here!
Hug me!

511
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:55,090
Welcome!

512
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:56,359
A tight hug!
- Enough!

513
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,130
You don't need to hug everyone
when you hug me.

514
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:01,166
Welcome Patel and family.

515
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,068
Hello.
- Hugs and all.

516
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,109
Patel, gulp it down.
- No.

517
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:07,503
Really?
- I don't drink.

518
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:09,067
lt's liquor!

519
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:11,239
I don't care what it is,
I don't drink.

520
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:13,146
No.
- What will you drink then?

521
00:29:13,383 --> 00:29:16,511
Wate r.
- Water?

522
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:18,646
Water.
- Large or small?

523
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,647
Small to start with.

524
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:23,392
Oh wow!
- Guggi, listen to me!

525
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,486
Dad, let me introduce you
to our neighbor.

526
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,498
Patel, my dad, Premlal Tandon.

527
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:31,057
Hello.
- He has been to jail twice.

528
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,366
Tell me something.

529
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,337
Why did you go to jail twice?

530
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:37,067
The first time

531
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,131
it was in 1942,
for the freedom movement.

532
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,109

 see and the second time?
- The second time,

533
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:44,573
I went behind bars for a bitch.

534
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:51,245
When I got out of the jail,
I had to marry her

535
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:55,485
and this bastard Guggi was born.

536
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:58,618
Let's go. They'll spoil you.
- Dad, let's have a drink.

537
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,395
Here.

538
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,938
Nice dress.
- Nice excuse.

539
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,950
It's not an excuse.
You are a guest

540
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:25,445
and I am your host.
I must make sure

541
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:28,180
that you shouldn't feel lonely.
- There are many guests here.

542
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:31,560
You should entertain them.
- Tell you what,

543
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,293
there are many stars in the sky,

544
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,456
but there is only one moon.

545
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,668
Go away.
- Excuse me.

546
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,396
Let me attend to the other sister.

547
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:45,639
It's so beautiful.

548
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:48,206
What's that? Mosquito bite?

549
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:50,008
No, my husband bit me.

550
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:52,548
Last night's love bite.

551
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:55,740
Bar!

552
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,279
Awesome!

553
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:01,421
You guys are drinking.
You should eat something.

554
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:04,016
You should continue.
We snack everyday.

555
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:06,618
All right. Bille, bring it over!

556
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,962
Chicken lollipop!
- Hold on, what's that?

557
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:11,626
Where did the chicken come from?

558
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,926
That's chicken.
- From eggs, of course.

559
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,505
It won't come from
a hooch den.

560
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:19,236
Mr Tandon, we don't allow meat
in our society.

561
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:21,972
It's not allowed.
- It makes us uncomfortable.

562
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,708
He's more uncomfortable
than chicken.

563
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:27,015
Listen to me, Mr Tandon.

564
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,252
How will you feel
if someone eats you?

565
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:32,585
We are tigers, the king ofjungle
eats meat

566
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,112
he doesn't eat grass.

567
00:31:34,157 --> 00:31:36,682
This society is meant for people

568
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,125
not for animals.

569
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:41,220
Take it away.
- The elephant eats grass, doesn't he?

570
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:44,165
He can throw a tiger away in his trunk!
- Answer that.

571
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:47,733
Come here.
My dad is 80-year-old

572
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:50,235
and he's still fit as a fiddle.
Tell me why.

573
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,401
Because he eats chicken.
- No. He doesn't lecture people.

574
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:56,310
He keeps his mind free and open.
You should do the same.

575
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,377
That's not done.

576
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,610
We must stop him now

577
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,347
or we'll have to carry him
on our shoulders.

578
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,082
He is right.
- That's right.

579
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:10,456

 suggest
you should stop selling him goods.

580
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:14,293
Hold on.
Why mix emotions and economics?

581
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:16,389
Don't mix business with attitude.

582
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:20,334
How are you, my friends?
- How are you doing, guys?

583
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:23,338
Patel, come and hug me.
- No way.

584
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,937
No more hugging.
Stay away, don't touch.

585
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:27,711
"unﬁlhﬂlm

586
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:31,579
The committee has decided that if
you want to live in this society

587
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,980
then you can't have wild parties
like last night.

588
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,280
Am I right?
- Of course.

589
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:40,949
Tell your prince that no dance,
no party and no loud music.

590
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,286
You can't switch on TV
after 11 PM.

591
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,187

 only watch FTV, friends.

592
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,423
What amazing models they have!

593
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:52,295
Brother, they can given Angelina
Jollie a run for her money.

594
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:54,633
Really? Which channel?

595
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:57,332
You should watch Aastha channel.

596
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,376
You can't watch
any English channels.

597
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,469
We had the cable operator
disconnect it.

598
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:06,345
Fine. No problem.
- You can't eat meat.

599
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:09,249
Fine. We won't.
- You drink whiskey and vodka.

600
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,149
No more drinking.
- We won't allow it.

601
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,518
Fine. We won't do it.

602
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,682
One more thing.
- Hold on a second.

603
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,093
He just keeps going
on and on and on.

604
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,160
Why should we stop
all these things?

605
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:22,396
Dear, your dad's name is Prem,
Premlal.

606
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:24,490
Tell your son nicely

607
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,195
that he should preserve values
and not just his cars.

608
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,706
Warn your grandson to stay away
from my daughters.

609
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:43,276
Hello.

610
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:44,980
You!
- Yes.

611
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,584
Go. Someone might see you.

612
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,482
What's your problem?

613
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,258
I got two immediate problems.

614
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,328
Second, l'm hanging onto
my dear life from your balcony

615
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,458
and not wearing a parachute.

616
00:33:58,535 --> 00:33:59,524
Please.

617
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,126
I must come in since
you say "please".

618
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,603
Oh my God!

619
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:07,170
Not bad.
- What do you want?

620
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:09,201
Is that a question or an offer?

621
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:10,378
Listen...

622
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:12,608
Hold on.

623
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,413
What's that?
- People in love

624
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:21,514
talk about plucking stars and moons
from the sky.

625
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:26,117
I got you this Wi-Fi device.
Now you can talk to the world.

626
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,294
Your dad is into...

627
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,531
mind control, right?

628
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,535
It will control him, so chill.

629
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,531
Thanks.

630
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:40,942
What if my dad finds out?

631
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:44,043
Your dad...

632
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:52,147
What are you doing?
- Your dad won't have a clue.

633
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,150
My parachute is waiting.

634
00:34:57,494 --> 00:35:02,557
"His eyes gaze at me..."

635
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:07,401
Living here is like a leading
a handcuffed life.

636
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:12,002
This housing society should be
renamed as Taliban Society.

637
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:14,173
The Tandons hate shackles.

638
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:17,907
If you want to live here,
you have to be like us.

639
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,973
You want us to become
Gujjus like you?

640
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:22,518
Why do you keep saying Gujjus?

641
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,246
You think the Gujaratis are trash!

642
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:27,254
Without Gujaratis, half the business
in this country would shut down.

643
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:28,654
Half of your economy
would be finished.

644
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:32,326
Without Punjabis, the army
would be down to half.

645
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,454
Not to mention the truck traffic
on the highways.

646
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:39,263
Don't mess with Punjabis.

647
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,129
We don't mess with anyone.

648
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,703
We don't spare anyone
who messes with us.

649
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:47,704
We strike without a thought
and before we think...

650
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:50,638
What did I just say?
You get the picture!

651
00:35:51,548 --> 00:35:52,640
Let's go, dad.
- Come on.

652
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:54,415
Well done.
- What do they think of us?

653
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,141
Nobody gives a damn about us!

654
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,313
Time to take a legal action.

655
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:02,088
My friend Deshpande works for
the municipal corporation.

656
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,524
Deshpande, this is Hasmukh Patel.

657
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,164
Fine. Listen.

658
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:12,199
Guggi Tandon moved into our
housing society few days ago

659
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:13,633
and has started a garage
without permission.

660
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:16,138
Right. He refuses to listen to us.

661
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:19,175
He brags that the municipality
can't hurt him.

662
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:22,444
Send him a notice and tow away
all his cars.

663
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:25,971
Only way to straighten him out
is to shut down his business.

664
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,980
Okay. Thank you. We'll see.

665
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:35,047
This car's delivery is tomorrow.
Check it properly.

666
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,692
Bille, this car breaks down near
petrol stations. Check it properly.

667
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:42,597
Hello. - Hello, Guggi,
this is Shyam from Dubai.

668
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,934
So you reached Dubai, my don!

669
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,962
Just order me.

670
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,034
A call from Dubai,
a friend of his.

671
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:53,701
My girlfriend Tina's
photo and her stuff

672
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:55,535
is in the trunk of your car.

673
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,102
Stuff in the trunk?

674
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:59,547
Check it.
- You'll get me in trouble.

675
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,280
Stuff? That means RDX.
- Let me check.

676
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,488
My wife already suspects me.

677
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,221
Just hide the stuff.

678
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,955
Don't let Pammi any of this.

679
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,459
Else she'll tell my wife about it.

680
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,557
Don't worry.

681
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:18,032
Help me out, my friend.

682
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:20,168
No one will know about it.

683
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:24,036
We got underworld
right in our society.

684
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,181
'Pooja, updated version.'

685
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:40,147
Wow!

686
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,019
Correct.

687
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,399
Dilo, why did the water stop?

688
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:58,634
They are washing
the car since morning.

689
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't you have any sense?

690
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,181
I still haven't finished showering
and you're still washing cars.

691
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,880
Stupid, illiterate, stick fighters!

692
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:15,186
Stupid, illiterate, stick fighters!
Who are you talking about?

693
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:17,955
No the Sardars
are very nice people.

694
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:19,221
Why are you roaming naked?

695
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,298
l'll shower tomorrow
or the day after. No problem.

696
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,461
I'm not on sale, right?
Wash your cars.

697
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:31,998
No problem. Car wash...
Give it to me.

698
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,603
l'll shower you instead.

699
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,201
Time to get wet, beauty.

700
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:40,109
No...
- Focus on the trunk.

701
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,014
The trunk!

702
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:47,213
It should shine, spray it properly.

703
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,688
Time to clean the dippers.

704
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:55,123
The exhaust pipe.

705
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,462
Enough.
I won't shower for a month today.

706
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:59,659
Billa, get a fresh
towel for myself.

707
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:02,166
Listen to me. God...

708
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:04,406
gave me a body to hide my soul

709
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,408
and a towel to cover my body.

710
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,205
I got both of them.
No thanks.

711
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:11,042
Well said. Come on, son.

712
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:14,074
Hasuda.

713
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:19,520
Never knew about
the power of underworld,

714
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,549
but now I know about their shower.

715
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,357
Time to teach them a lesson.

716
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:26,656
Desai, cut off their water supply.
- Sure.

717
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,128
Patel has ruined my life.

718
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:36,599
l have to make do with this funeral urn
instead of my shiny whisky glass.

719
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,336
Start the engine, will you?

720
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:43,111
Yes!
- lt refuses to start, dad!

721
00:39:43,913 --> 00:39:47,974
Dear, your love story and this car
share the starting problem.

722
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,352
You love Patel's daughter,
don't you?

723
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,082
Your love story rumbles,
but refuses to start.

724
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:56,914
What can I say,
I've fallen for her.

725
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,928
Tell me something.
Couldn't you find anyone else?

726
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:05,327
lmagine lifting the veil of that
Gujarati girl on your wedding night.

727
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:08,096
It's like opening
a box full of sweets and snacks.

728
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:11,436
Then you'll hear a voice:
"My dear, I love you."

729
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:14,499
Sweets and snacks
have their own charm, dad.

730
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,703
You know nothing about it.

731
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,713
l have this strong feeling

732
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:23,979
that I'm in true love with her.

733
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:25,486
Well said.

734
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:29,150
Like you had true
love back in Patiala.

735
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,217
You could never say "I love you".

736
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,553
Now those girls are married
and roam with two kids in tow.

737
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,522
My dear son.

738
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:41,660
You gotta have courage apart
from heart to fall in love.

739
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,639
You don't know a thing.
You can't do this.

740
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:47,999
If only courage was needed

741
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,378
then a love ode would've been
written on Sikandar.

742
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:53,572
There would be love
songs on Nepolean.

743
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:57,653
Witty dialogues or winning strategy
for love. You decide.

744
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,989
ldiot, go and do a self-start.

745
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,185
You can't do a thing.

746
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,186
He can't do a thing.

747
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:08,294
I can do it.
- Stop bragging.

748
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:10,156
I'm trying my best.

749
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:13,367
Dad, friendship is the first gear.

750
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:15,170
Love is the second gear.

751
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:16,972
Marriage is the third gear...

752
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,975
My friend, put the love car
in the first gear.

753
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,575
But we need neutral
to change gears.

754
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:28,117
Dad, you are the neutral I need.

755
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,519
You should persuade Patel.

756
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,987
You want me to sneak
into the enemy camp

757
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,252
and dig a tunnel
with a plastic spoon.

758
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:41,095
You're scared of Patel. Forget it.

759
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:44,031
You think so?
- Hmm.

760
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:49,400
All right. l'll persuade Patel
and make friends with him for you.

761
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:53,534
First, put your car into the first
gear and let your story begin.

762
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:58,703
It has started! There you go!

763
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,484
There comes Patel!

764
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:08,956
"Punjabi!"

765
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,597
Let Prem tell you about love.

766
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:21,403
My dear, the love engine takes its
own time to warm up.

767
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,334
So go slow.

768
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:26,236
Time to put this car
into the reverse gear.

769
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:28,709
Good job. Get moving.

770
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:44,958
Hello.

771
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:46,086
You?

772
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:47,356
What are you doing here?
- Here I am.

773
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,591
Should I go for jogging
in the parking lot?

774
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:51,223
Very funny. Listen.

775
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,497
I've put your wi-fi device
in the side box of your bike.

776
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,203
Hold on. Why?

777
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,308
Because I don't want to
hide anything from my father.

778
00:43:01,377 --> 00:43:03,038
Right. Your dad's douche bag.

779
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,615
By the way, why are helping me?

780
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:09,651
Because I like you a lot.

781
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,044
Anyway, it's no trouble.

782
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:15,557
Wi-fi down,
I can wait, I understand.

783
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:19,027
I moved to Mumbai
only some days ago.

784
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:20,995
You should say a few days ago.

785
00:43:21,063 --> 00:43:22,428
Not some days.

786
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:26,365
Correct. I'm a bit weak in math.

787
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:29,471
But I'm strong in love.
My time starts

788
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,030
when I saw you in Heer's costume.

789
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:34,576
Your face is akin
to like a new Audi.

790
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:38,378
Leather seat, heartbeat. Hello.

791
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:40,676
Really?
- Yes.

792
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,544
I dare you to come to my home
and say all this.

793
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:47,580
What if I do?

794
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:49,420
Then I'll think about it.

795
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:01,666
Hello, ma'am. What's wrong? You
look worried. - Forget about it.

796
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:05,101
Damn! They cut
off our water supply!

797
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:08,143
Dear me! - My hubby has been
drinking neat since two days.

798
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,235
l was thinking about
adding kidney beans to rum

799
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:13,214
and gram flour to Bacardi.

800
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:15,113
We got a pile of dirty clothes.

801
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,213
and we were feeling very shy.

802
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:24,418
Out of the way.
Sorry, just clothes.

803
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:27,361
Dhilo, whose clothes are these?

804
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,955
This is no public washing spot.
- These are our clothes.

805
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,199

 see, they are yours.

806
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:35,136
Had you told me earlier, I
would've washed them at your place.

807
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:37,502
Come on, brother.
I made 'aloo parathe' for you.

808
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:40,371
I've already eaten 'khakhra'.
- You are still angry, aren't you?

809
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:42,468
Don't feel bad about his comments.

810
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:46,413
I can't feel bad. I'm a family man.
I can't afford to.

811
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:49,646
All right, calm down.
In a few days, you won't

812
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,516
give a rat's ass
about what he says.

813
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:54,488
It doesn't suit a woman like you
to say rat's ass?

814
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,724
Should I change my sex
so that I can abuse freely?

815
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:05,659
Hail Goddess. Mom?

816
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:20,346
Go to the kitchen.

817
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:23,577
Hold on.
- Let me handle it.

818
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,611
Don't... - Last time,
you broke your back while dancing.

819
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:28,179
Let me handle it. Go.

820
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,188
You should bring us a gas cylinder
for change.

821
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,161
I got it from our home.
We'll have a pizza today.

822
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,256
Don't worry.

823
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,468
You?
- Hello.

824
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:46,065
Listen, I like you a lot.

825
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,473
It's okay,
but you should leave now.

826
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,137
You gave me a challenge,
I did it.

827
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:51,577
Foolproof planning.
- Idiot!

828
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:02,181
Love is all about heartache

829
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:05,221
but I never imagined
it could be gas problem too.

830
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:08,124
How much? Strange man.

831
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,089
Aunt!

832
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,089
Please taste the 'theplas' I made.

833
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,897
We don't return empty vessels.

834
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:15,400
It's not empty.

835
00:46:15,604 --> 00:46:18,573
I'm taking back so much from here.

836
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:21,373
Isn't that too dramatic?

837
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:26,004
Mom, why was Pammi here?

838
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,516
So what if she was here?
Neighbors are remote relatives.

839
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:32,680
I don't want a single Punjabi
here even remotely.

840
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,319
I hope you remember Pat Singh.

841
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:38,087
He ruined our lives.

842
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,193
Pammi is fine, but not Guggi.

843
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,627
I don't want Guggi here.

844
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:45,428
Hasuda.
- Do you have any idea

845
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:47,033
who that guy is?

846
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:49,333
Do you know anything about
his connections?

847
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:52,533
Connections till your heart.

848
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,301
Tell me something, Patel.

849
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,943
Do you still have it?

850
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,244
Vest.
- Not that.

851
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:04,150
Malice.
- No way.

852
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,289
Then why did you send me
this notice from the municipality?

853
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:08,620
What's this?

854
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:12,084
Don't notice such a notice, Guggi.

855
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:14,322
These things happen.
You want anything from the shop?

856
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:15,556
The whole shop is yours.

857
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:18,263
Hasuda, forget about the business.
He's here for the first time.

858
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,961
Will you have tea?
- But...

859
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:22,069
What's that?
- Half a cup.

860
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:24,900
Fine. Half a cup. Tea.

861
00:47:25,674 --> 00:47:29,132
All you can offer is tea.
Tell me something. - Yes?

862
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:31,108
Don't you keep beer in your shop?

863
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,117
I don't keep anything in the shop
I don't use.

864
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,249
Do you apply 'sindoor'?

865
00:47:39,555 --> 00:47:41,455
No way.
- Then why do you sell 'sindoor'?

866
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,185
I'll help you get a license
in no time.

867
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:47,362
It's not about the license.

868
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:50,330
It's all about conscience.
- What's that?

869
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,560
If you make money,
you will be happy.

870
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:55,561
Your house looks very desolate

871
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:58,505
and a very sad place. Get it?

872
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:00,532
Let me give you a tip.

873
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:04,340
Here is my first tip,
you should spice up...

874
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:06,615
your dull place.

875
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:09,476
Guggi, we add spices
to our curries.

876
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:11,142
We don't add spices to our walls.

877
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:13,479
You didn't get me.

878
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:15,649
Why do we make money?
- For our family.

879
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,985
For car and for our belly.

880
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,928
For carpet!
- Okay!

881
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:24,090
You should get rid of
that dining table.

882
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,997
Who gets hungry in your family?

883
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:28,593
We take 'hingashtak churna'
and 'isabgol' at night.

884
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:31,129
Then in the morning,
you go like this...

885
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,640
You have to. Don't you go?

886
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:35,502
There are lots of fancy tables
in the market.

887
00:48:35,544 --> 00:48:38,308
There is this naked girl statue.

888
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,405
She's lying on the glass like this.

889
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,247
It stirs your
appetite like nothing.

890
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,514
You should get a table like that.

891
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:48,646
You should get a lion-headed carpet
for your floor.

892
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:53,688
You should get a chandelier
for your roof.

893
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:57,132
You got verbal diarrhea.

894
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,224
We follow only one philosophy.

895
00:48:59,301 --> 00:49:02,702
Simple living, high thinking.
Get it?

896
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:04,539
Come here.

897
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,500
What will you do
with so much money?

898
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:11,945
To tell you the truth,
I want to buy a supermarket.

899
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:14,983
I see.
- But you already bought a bungalow.

900
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:19,282
Of course, your bungalow
is pretty impressive.

901
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:22,319
So I couldn't fulfill my wish.

902
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:25,517
Don't worry, my friend.

903
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:29,424
I've seen second-hand watches

904
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:32,163
and your body looks second-hand.

905
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,528
You grew up on 'khaman' diet
and became weak

906
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:37,163
and you need some rattling.

907
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:40,172
What's that?
- Can't tell you here. Come with me.

908
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,534
Come with me.
- No, no.

909
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,047
For him? 15,000.

910
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:47,207
15,000?

911
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:50,448
Where have you brought me?
- Come on, dude.

912
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,010
They'll tighten you up.

913
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:55,390
Squeeze me dry?
- They'll make you fit.

914
00:49:55,457 --> 00:49:57,152
Hold on. What's the guarantee?

915
00:49:57,326 --> 00:50:00,295
Will they make me fit for 15,000?

916
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:03,624
You'll search for an expiry date
on an ambrosia bottle.

917
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:06,930
Don't be a fool. Trust me.
Count on you.

918
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:11,199
Sir, please take off your shirt.

'

 fix this.

919
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,571
You lie down.

920
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:15,010
Is this electric?
- Yes, sir.

921
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:17,978
No, sir. I don't want to
take a chance with my body.

922
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,174
This is not done.
- I am fine.

923
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,944
You should go ahead.
I'll follow you.

924
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:24,645
Will you do it after me?
I'll just change and come.

925
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:27,447
Did you see that? Easy-peasy.

926
00:50:27,723 --> 00:50:29,384
Easy-peasy.
- Relax, sir. I'll join you later.

927
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,686
I know, I know.

928
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,428
This tones your muscles.

929
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:37,294
How can this help you?

930
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:40,435
It's like an elephant is eating
homeopathic medicines.

931
00:50:40,502 --> 00:50:42,561
Should I turn it up a notch?
- Go ahead.

932
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:45,004
Easy-peasy.

933
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,735
Easy?
- Easy-peasy.

934
00:50:47,009 --> 00:50:48,636
Easy?
- Easy-peasy.

935
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,144
Easy?

936
00:50:50,412 --> 00:50:53,404
Easy-peasy.
- My phone's ringing. Answer it.

937
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:54,711
Sure, sure.

938
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,745
What's happening?
- That's easy.

939
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,212
Hello.
- Hey.

940
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:03,088
The car's bonnet is shaking?

941
00:51:03,158 --> 00:51:04,455
Let it shake.

942
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:06,426
It's vibrating?

943
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:09,657
I'm also vibrating.
- Enjoy.

944
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:13,430
Patel!
- Okay.

945
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:18,266
He acts like a don,
now he's crying like a little girl.

946
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:20,537
Patel!

947
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:26,537
Sorry.

948
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:30,577
Come on...

949
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:33,076
What...

950
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,556
My friend, what's going on?

951
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,354
How could you do that to me?

952
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:41,628
I'm shaking violently

953
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,291
as if the stock market has crashed.

954
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:45,731
No problem.
- We have Angaar Baba in Gujarat.

955
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,435
He'll make you walk on
a bed of burning coals.

956
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:51,166
Open the door.
To tell with that Baba.

957
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:02,049
What are you doing here?
- Hi.

958
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,514
Why are you following
me everywhere?

959
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:06,076
I came here to learn about
the pride of Gujarat.

960
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:08,346
Trust me.
- Trust in you?

961
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:11,024
Forget old news.
Here's something new.

962
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,658
I sat under the car headlights
all night long

963
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:15,328
and wrote a new poem for you.

964
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:17,365
Original.
- Stop it, will you?

965
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:19,257
You gave me a Wi-Fi device.

966
00:52:19,435 --> 00:52:21,494
The other day,
you brought a gas cylinder.

967
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,472
Now you've reached here
with a borrowed poem.

968
00:52:26,442 --> 00:52:28,535
Do you have any idea about love?

969
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,008
Have you ever fallen in love before?
- Sit down.

970
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:34,446
There was a girl named Anu.

971
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:37,418
She was my neighbor in Patiala.

972
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,379
She would come to me every day

973
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:43,123
with her hands outstretched
and fists closed.

974
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:45,590
Then she'd ask me to choose

975
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,229
one of the two hands.

976
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,659
No matter what fists I choose,

977
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:56,695
it would have peanut peels

978
00:52:58,073 --> 00:52:59,506
and in the other fist she'd hold

979
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,635
huge peanuts.

980
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,440
It kept on for years.

981
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:09,981
I always got peels.

982
00:53:10,986 --> 00:53:13,352
One day, I found out
that Anu was getting engaged.

983
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,281
I got angry and hid on the floor

984
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:18,989
and then Anu found me.

985
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:20,491
She asked me to choose again.

986
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:23,529
I chose the fist...

987
00:53:26,135 --> 00:53:29,935
and there were peanuts in it.

988
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:34,208
I checked the other fist.

989
00:53:36,044 --> 00:53:39,070
It also had peanuts.

990
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,418
She wanted me to win.

991
00:53:45,053 --> 00:53:46,418
I think that perhaps...

992
00:53:49,258 --> 00:53:51,692
I think those little peanut peels

993
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:56,323
turned into henna
design on her hands.

994
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:01,362
Yes, I had fallen in love once.

995
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:04,597
Only once.

996
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:12,607
I'm sure, you'll find someone.

997
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:22,380
"I have worshipped goddess
Parvati dedicatedly."

998
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:28,625
"Still couldn't succeed spending
the wakeful nights..."

999
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:34,432
Talk to her.

1000
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,403
Hold this.

1001
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:46,074
Pooja, watch the lamp.

1002
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:49,547
Our mind isjust like a lamp.

1003
00:54:49,618 --> 00:54:51,108
You have to watch it over.

1004
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,685
Give it to Meera.

1005
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:56,288
What are you doing since morning?
Are you measuring the trunk

1006
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:58,588
or are you working out
for a flat tummy?

1007
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,059
Pammi, it's a ritual.

1008
00:55:01,129 --> 00:55:04,223
It's known as 'Vatsavitri' and it's
performed for husband's long life.

1009
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,300
You also perform 'karvachauth',
don't you?

1010
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:08,268
Can't take chances with
husband's long life.

1011
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:10,396
If he isn't around,
who will pay for shopping.

1012
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:15,043
You are right.
You should also observe this fast.

1013
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,307
Mr Tandon's life
is so unpredictable.

1014
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:22,206
Here today, gone tomorrow.

1015
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:26,350
I didn't get you.
- His business can take him to places.

1016
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:29,049
Yes, he's into automobile.
- Not cars.

1017
00:55:29,324 --> 00:55:31,519
He's a don.
- Hey.

1018
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,450
What ideas are you putting
into my wife's head?

1019
00:55:33,528 --> 00:55:35,428
No I just suggested her

1020
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:37,965
that she should observe fast
for your long life.

1021
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,330
That's what I said, right?
- Okay!

1022
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:40,993
But you have to follow a rule.

1023
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:42,696
When the wife observes this fast,

1024
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:45,997
even the husband
can't eat for 24 hours.

1025
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:49,639
What are you saying?
- You can't eat or drink.

1026
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:54,671
You can't eat meat, can't drink
or have sex for seven days.

1027
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:58,714
No sex is okay. But no meat
and no drinks for seven days.

1028
00:55:58,987 --> 00:56:00,955
Seven days!
- You're talking nonsense.

1029
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,479
Listen to me.
- Excuse me.

1030
00:56:02,557 --> 00:56:04,252
I observe 'karvachauth' for you.
- Right.

1031
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:06,157
You do it for a day,
not for seven days.

1032
00:56:06,228 --> 00:56:08,025
Without food or water.
- Are you crazy?

1033
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:09,223
You're talking nonsense!

1034
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,458
Shut up.
- Can't you do this for me?

1035
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:11,897
I can't do it for seven days.

1036
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:14,197
Don't listen to him.
- But...

1037
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:15,566
This Punjabi is dead.

1038
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:20,465
Sister...

1039
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:23,306
You... here?
- Hello.

1040
00:56:24,212 --> 00:56:26,942
Go away. This is women's festival.

1041
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:30,974
So what?
They are not changing clothes.

1042
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:34,581
Don't make a fun of tradition.
- Let's get serious.

1043
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:39,415
When are you tying the thread?

1044
00:56:40,495 --> 00:56:43,157
Only for a lucky one.

1045
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,299
I am also a lucky man.

1046
00:56:49,071 --> 00:56:50,538
You and I make a nice pair.

1047
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,336
Bye.

1048
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:14,020
Monty, what are you doing?
- Close your eyes.

1049
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,433
Take this off.

1050
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:24,337
Is this for me?
- Yeah.

1051
00:57:26,975 --> 00:57:29,967
Thank you, Monty. Wow.

1052
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:32,939
I think I'm very
close to the sky now.

1053
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:34,209
Like four inches.

1054
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:36,307
You are a poet.

1055
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:39,252
I'm not a poet,
but a puppet at my dad's hand.

1056
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:42,953
Can I say something? You
look great with your hair untied.

1057
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:45,123
But my dad doesn't like it.

1058
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:46,922
Even your dad doesn't
tie up his hair.

1059
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:49,294
Don't try to be smart.
I'm talking about myself.

1060
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,363
Wow! I love this freedom.

1061
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:58,129
When I got out of the house,
I felt as if...

1062
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,271
I felt as if...
- Yes?

1063
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,001
That soap with lime.

1064
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:06,408
A breath of fresh air
through your body.

1065
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:09,348
Why do you always mention
soap and oil ads?

1066
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:11,886
What else can I do?
You know,

1067
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,487
I have gone out with someone
for the first time.

1068
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:18,454
Generally, I don't trust anyone.
No way.

1069
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:21,087
Thanks, so you're ready
to get married?

1070
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:25,165
Hello. Don't rush.

1071
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:27,232
I still don't have those
feelings for you.

1072
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,202
No problem. Take your time.

1073
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:31,239
I'll give you five minutes
to tell me about your feelings.

1074
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:34,373
See, we are late already.

1075
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:36,001
I have to send invites
for the engagement.

1076
00:58:36,077 --> 00:58:37,977
Whose engagement?

1077
00:58:38,013 --> 00:58:40,208
Nimisha is getting
engaged this Saturday.

1078
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,916
You scared me there for a second.
I thought...

1079
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,646
Never mind.
- We are late.

1080
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,149
Do come for the engagement.

1081
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:48,246
Come on.

1082
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:58,031
"This soul desires for
the salvation now."

1083
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:07,601
"Inspite of convincing several times,
it demands a new life now."

1084
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,010
"This soul desires..."

1085
00:59:14,149 --> 00:59:17,050
I think we got the wrong address.

1086
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:20,611
I think they are
having someone's...

1087
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:22,617
Messenger service...
- Memorial service.

1088
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:25,516
Shut up!
- Everyone has shut up already.

1089
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:29,928
No DJ, no drinks,
even the relatives aren't fighting.

1090
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:32,193
Congratulations.

1091
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:34,963
Congratulations.

1092
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,503
Congratulations.
- Hand him the bouquet.

1093
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:38,232
Thank you, thank you.

1094
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:41,174
You came quite early.
- Patel.

1095
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,502
That song isn't fitting.

1096
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:46,206
It's engagement.
There should be a party

1097
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:48,306
and a drama!

1098
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,908
You should create a spectacle
for the groom's family.

1099
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:52,647
No spectacle.

1100
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:54,684
We are serving 'halwa'.
Don't leave without eating.

1101
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:58,250
My daughter's father-in-Iaw,
Kantibhai is quite

1102
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:00,157
a cultured man

1103
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:01,388
and he worships the cow.

1104
01:00:01,463 --> 01:00:03,226
He owns four cow shades.

1105
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:07,029
If he owns cow shades,
will he have a wedding there?

1106
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:09,966
Dad, you are too much.
Listen to me.

1107
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:13,368
I don't want the groom's family
to think that we are misers

1108
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:15,566
and that's why I've come up
with this amazing idea.

1109
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:18,346
My sister-in-Iaw is
a very talented woman.

1110
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,247
She is a great dancer.
Let's invite her troupe here.

1111
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:23,546
We had arranged her dance show
in Dubai.

1112
01:00:23,618 --> 01:00:26,212
That night the Shaikh danced
with her and also all the camels.

1113
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:31,151
She must be expensive.
- Don't talk about expenses.

1114
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:34,389
Consider it to be a gift from us.
- Of course.

1115
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:36,362
Fine. You pay for it

1116
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:39,730
but make sure that Kantibhai
must feel that it's my idea.

1117
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:43,664
Of course. You pay for my bright idea.
- Sure, sure.

1118
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:45,103
Fine then.

1119
01:00:45,173 --> 01:00:49,109
Welcome, welcome!
- Meet my daughter's father-in-Iaw.

1120
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:50,667
J ust have snacks

1121
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:54,078
and till then we'll arrange for
a musical show. - Sure.

1122
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:57,414
Surprise. - Let's see
the surprise before the engagement.

1123
01:01:00,088 --> 01:01:03,114
"Touch me baby, do it."

1124
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:09,088
"Love me, baby, wow."

1125
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:19,031
"Oh dear, I have a lover
in every street."

1126
01:01:19,107 --> 01:01:22,133
"Oh dear."

1127
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:26,505
"Oh dear, I have a lover
in every street."

1128
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:29,448
"Oh dear."

1129
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:31,549
"All the bachelors come"

1130
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:36,956
"and want to sign
me a blank check."

1131
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:40,586
"Hit on me. Yes, hit on me."

1132
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:44,360
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1133
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:48,027
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1134
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:51,630
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1135
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:55,574
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1136
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:10,652
"God will ask you
why did you waste your life?"

1137
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:14,655
"Touch me and drink
this love potion."

1138
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:21,966
"God will ask you
why did you waste your life?"

1139
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:25,200
"Touch me and drink
this love potion."

1140
01:02:25,273 --> 01:02:28,936
"My stole flies
and sends a sultry message."

1141
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,275
"The world around us is so divine."

1142
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,372
"Hit on me."

1143
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:38,079
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1144
01:02:38,153 --> 01:02:41,611
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1145
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,319
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1146
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:49,386
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1147
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:10,047
"Life is a long story
and I'm the lock that you open."

1148
01:03:10,151 --> 01:03:13,643
"We are incomplete
without each other."

1149
01:03:17,325 --> 01:03:21,159
"Life is a long story
and I'm the lock that you open."

1150
01:03:21,229 --> 01:03:24,460
"We are incomplete
without each other."

1151
01:03:24,532 --> 01:03:28,059
"Touch me,
crazy boy and just chill."

1152
01:03:28,136 --> 01:03:31,105
"I'm yours and you are mine."

1153
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:32,973
"Hit on me."

1154
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:37,274
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1155
01:03:37,345 --> 01:03:40,712
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1156
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:44,543
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1157
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:48,612
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1158
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,960
"I have a lover in every street."

1159
01:03:56,131 --> 01:03:57,962
"All the bachelors come"

1160
01:03:58,032 --> 01:04:03,163
"and want to sign
me a blank check."

1161
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:06,639
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1162
01:04:06,908 --> 01:04:12,039
"Hit on me and you will be fine,
darling."

1163
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:20,213
Let's do it, baby.

1164
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:37,570
Dad, why are they all so silent?

1165
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:41,041
They are so happy and impressed

1166
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:42,508
that they don't have words.

1167
01:04:43,211 --> 01:04:45,304
So Mr Kantibhai,

1168
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,575
we had a blast at this engagement

1169
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,379
sojust imagine, what a wedding
would be like.

1170
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,975
Well said.

1171
01:04:52,053 --> 01:04:56,251
Really? We are going to
have a blast at the wedding.

1172
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:59,589
Of course.
- Great. Very nice.

1173
01:05:00,261 --> 01:05:03,697
Is this your idea,
Hasmukhrai Mukuandrai Patel?

1174
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:08,398
Yes, it is.
- No, Kantibhai, it wasn't my idea.

1175
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,596
These Punjabis are...
- He is lying.

1176
01:05:10,638 --> 01:05:13,937
He is of course embarrassed
to take the credit. - I...

1177
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:16,306
It's his idea.
- A very original idea

1178
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:18,402
that stemmed from his brain.
- Shut up.

1179
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:20,310
Shut up!

1180
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:23,441
"Hit on me and you'll be fine,
darling."

1181
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:25,952
Is this what you
taught your daughter?

1182
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,682
No, she is a graduate...
- Shut up.

1183
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:33,286
I call off this engagement!

1184
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:37,364
Let's go!
- Kantibhai...

1185
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:39,457
Kanti bhai!
- Dad!

1186
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:43,265
Kantibhai, listen to me.
- Kantibhai.

1187
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:44,566
It's not my fault.

1188
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,405
These Punjabis... Please tell him.
- Move it.

1189
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,138
Kantibhai. Kantibhai.
- Come on.

1190
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:53,377
We have a problem.

1191
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:58,351
You broke off this engagement.

1192
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,419
You ruined our years of tradition.
- Patel.

1193
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:06,193
We always had your best interests
at heart.

1194
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:09,458
Our intentions were right...
- To hell with it.

1195
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:13,067
What a terrible fate!
How could I listen to you!

1196
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:18,933
I respected you so far,
but not anymore.

1197
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:25,541
A Punjabi named Pat Singh ruined my
life before this and now it's you.

1198
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:28,281
Listen to me and listen well.

1199
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:31,178
I always hated the Punjabis

1200
01:06:31,653 --> 01:06:35,180
I still do and I'll always do so.

1201
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:14,220
Hello, Dipesh?
- I can't help it.

1202
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:16,559
You know I can't disobey my father.

1203
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:18,360
Whatever happened tonight...

1204
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,664
You're talking to her despite
tonight's debacle.

1205
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:33,338
Dad, please do something.

1206
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:35,279
To hell with that Kanti!

1207
01:07:35,316 --> 01:07:36,977
We'll find you another groom.

1208
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:39,383
But grandma, I love him.

1209
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:41,217
To hell with your love story.

1210
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:43,547
Did your dad ever love your mom?

1211
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:45,524
How dare you!
- Enough!

1212
01:07:47,362 --> 01:07:49,694
Dad, please do something.

1213
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:57,202
That's really bad!
I mean, terrible.

1214
01:07:57,271 --> 01:08:00,263
Terrible. It was such a nice song!
What a waste!

1215
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,233
Stupid! Idiot!

1216
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:04,237
They are crying their hearts out

1217
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:07,137
and you guys are drinking.

1218
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,044
Would you like
a drink with soda or water?

1219
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:15,453
I'll show you how to drink it.

1220
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:18,189
Forget drinking...
Now listen to me.

1221
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:21,054
Till that girl is married,

1222
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:24,223
no one in our family will drink.
Get it?

1223
01:08:26,934 --> 01:08:29,164
We'll have to do something now.

1224
01:08:32,373 --> 01:08:35,137
There's another bottle
in the cupboard, get it.

1225
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,173
Sir, please don't do this. Sir.
- Damn you!

1226
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,473
Move!
- Wait, sir!

1227
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:19,477
Where the hell are you? Where...

1228
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:22,353
Where the hell are you?

1229
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:25,517
Patel, what are you doing?
- Don't take a step forward!

1230
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,493
Or else, I'll break your head!

1231
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:30,121
My daughter‘s engagement broke off,
thanks to you.

1232
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:31,665
Tonight, I will
break your house to pieces.

1233
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:34,993
Patel, whatever
happened with Nimisha...

1234
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:38,238
makes us sad too.
- You don't feel a thing!

1235
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,408
You would've realized my pain,
had you got a daughter.

1236
01:09:41,476 --> 01:09:45,207
Don't break anything!
- I have had enough! Enough.

1237
01:09:56,357 --> 01:10:00,020
I damaged the cars that you've
parked outside, get them fixed.

1238
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:03,959
Remember that you can fix
damaged cars,

1239
01:10:04,499 --> 01:10:09,300
but it's very difficult to mend
relations that have gone sour.

1240
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:19,943
Kantibhai, please hear me out.
- What are you going to say?

1241
01:10:20,014 --> 01:10:21,948
"Hit on me and you'll be fine."

1242
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:25,315
No more compromise!

1243
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:27,980
No more compromise with values.

1244
01:10:28,122 --> 01:10:29,589
Get the car out!
- I didn't drive here.

1245
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:32,618
Hey! I'm not talking to you.

1246
01:10:32,693 --> 01:10:34,251
I'm talking to my driver.

1247
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:38,162
Please listen to me.
The item number was not my idea.

1248
01:10:38,232 --> 01:10:39,358
Wait.
- Hey...

1249
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,262
That was my idea.

1250
01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:46,530
It was my idea.
Since you worship cows,

1251
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:50,740
we swear up on her and
say that it was entirely my idea.

1252
01:10:51,612 --> 01:10:54,240
Even the cow says
that this guy is innocent.

1253
01:10:54,315 --> 01:10:56,306
We walked 10 kilometers
to reach here

1254
01:10:56,384 --> 01:10:59,444
and our feet are dabbed in cow dung,
but Uncle Patel is a sober man. - True.

1255
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:01,545
You're creating a scene again.

1256
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:03,657
If he was a dinosaur worshiper,

1257
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:05,385
would you have brought
a dinosaur with you?

1258
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:07,222
Exactly.
- Right.

1259
01:11:07,428 --> 01:11:09,623
Don't drag the holy
cow into this mess.

1260
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:11,324
Hail the holy cow.
- True.

1261
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:13,429
Who am I?
- Kantibhai.

1262
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:15,999
Kantibhai Goradia.

1263
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:18,163
The pride of Gujaratis!

1264
01:11:18,339 --> 01:11:20,068
I spend millions

1265
01:11:20,107 --> 01:11:23,076
to collect antique
artifacts of Gujarat.

1266
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:25,237
I own seven cow shades

1267
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:27,508
and I run three orphanages.

1268
01:11:27,715 --> 01:11:30,445
An ordinary shopkeeper...
- Shut up.

1269
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,184
He just keeps yapping
on and on and on.

1270
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:36,713
You have no idea, but Mr Patel

1271
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:40,290
wants to open the ding-dong place
in your village.

1272
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:42,261
The ding-dong place?
- The fire brigade?

1273
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,298
A girls' school.

1274
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:46,664
Two girl's schools.

1275
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:48,702
He has a budge of five million.
- What?

1276
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,604
Yes.
- Is this true?

1277
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:54,664
No way. Don't listen to him.

1278
01:11:55,009 --> 01:11:56,738
He is going to deny it.

1279
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,241
He believes in secret donations.
Not like you.

1280
01:11:59,313 --> 01:12:02,373
So now tell me, where does
that put him compared to you?

1281
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:07,046
All right. The day you open
a girl's school in my village,

1282
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,918
I'll go ahead with this engagement.

1283
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,925
Good luck!
- Good luck!

1284
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:14,325
Even the cow approves of it.

1285
01:12:14,395 --> 01:12:16,363
The problem is solved.
- Not yet.

1286
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:19,922
The problem will be solved
when he opens the school.

1287
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:22,361
Get the car out.
- We didn't drive here.

1288
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:26,367
I'm talking to my driver.

1289
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,407
Oh.
- Driver.

1290
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:32,037
Kantibhai. Kantibhai.

1291
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,148
Kantibhai, listen to... Kantibhai.

1292
01:12:37,485 --> 01:12:40,454
Why do you reach everywhere
to ruin my life?

1293
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:42,455
Uncle, we don't try to ruin you.

1294
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:45,253
You get ruined anyway.
It's your fate.

1295
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:48,262
Chill, bro.
I'll give you five million.

1296
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:52,129
Not your cup of tea.
If Gujaratis decide

1297
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:55,667
then they can extract pounds from
Porbandar and dollars from Dakor.

1298
01:12:56,003 --> 01:12:58,995
Where do you get the euros from?
- Shut up.

1299
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,969
Terrible people!
- Dad.

1300
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:06,174
What did you tell
him about five million?

1301
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,987
Kanti is the guy who collects
ancient Gujarati artifacts.

1302
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:19,455
Time to show him something.

1303
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:21,986
Here's your money. Show me.

1304
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,921
Wow! Looks good. Superb.

1305
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:29,226
Will anyone doubts
it's not antique?

1306
01:13:29,303 --> 01:13:30,998
Does it look 500 years old?

1307
01:13:31,072 --> 01:13:33,939
I come from Ulhasnagar.

1308
01:13:34,008 --> 01:13:35,373
Forget this antique dish,

1309
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:37,638
I even make aeroplanes.

1310
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:40,980
Look at that one. I made that.

1311
01:13:41,382 --> 01:13:44,283
Forget it. Stop bragging. A bit of
praise and this guy goes overboard.

1312
01:13:44,952 --> 01:13:47,352
How will this plate help Mr Patel?

1313
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:51,388
We'll tell that this plate represents
Gujarat's ancient traditions

1314
01:13:51,592 --> 01:13:53,719
and we'll ask him to sell it
for5 million

1315
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:55,393
and it will solve his problem.

1316
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,460
Who will buy this pile of dirt?

1317
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:02,295
This is a fake antique, right?

1318
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,531
We'll bring in a fake buyer

1319
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:07,165
who will buy this fake plate
with our real money.

1320
01:14:07,408 --> 01:14:10,206
The problem solved.
He gets five million. - Correct.

1321
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,069
He won't accept help from us.
- Correct.

1322
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:14,011
He'll lecture us
about Gujarati pride.

1323
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:15,478
Is he around?

1324
01:14:15,549 --> 01:14:16,948
Here I am.

1325
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,611
Here he is.
- Why did you call me here?

1326
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:22,281
Welcome, my disgruntled friend.
- Hello.

1327
01:14:22,523 --> 01:14:24,115
Look, what we found while digging?

1328
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:28,021
A cake?
- This is a symbol of ancient Gujarat.

1329
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:29,924
It's a new antique.

1330
01:14:30,064 --> 01:14:31,429
Almost 500 years old.

1331
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:35,031
This will solve all your problems.

1332
01:14:35,269 --> 01:14:37,533
If you put this up for sell,

1333
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:40,574
you will at least get...

1334
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:42,632
A box?
- Not a box. - Then?

1335
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,945
Ten million. Or five million
at the minimum.

1336
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:48,514
This is the pride of Gujarat.

1337
01:14:49,183 --> 01:14:51,413
Our pride? You want me to sell it?

1338
01:14:52,186 --> 01:14:53,585
My conscience says no.

1339
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:56,521
Do you want to persuade
your conscience or Kantibhai?

1340
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,455
You aren't selling it for yourself.

1341
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:00,354
It will help you build a school
in the village.

1342
01:15:01,262 --> 01:15:03,696
A school.
- A school.

1343
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,199
Such an old plate.
- Where did you find it?

1344
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,137
This is what you call
the pride of Gujarat.

1345
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:14,907
Something you should be proud of.

1346
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:25,951
Are you blind or something?
Look, what you have done!

1347
01:15:26,554 --> 01:15:28,954
This is my mother, 500 years old.

1348
01:15:29,023 --> 01:15:31,082
Were you drying out your mom
for 500 years in the sun?

1349
01:15:32,326 --> 01:15:35,090
No! Don't insult his mom.

1350
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:37,493
Do you know who I am?
- No, I don't.

1351
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:41,225
I rule from here to Dahanu.

1352
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:43,295
I am the local don.

1353
01:15:45,306 --> 01:15:47,536
So you rule over Dahanu.

1354
01:15:47,608 --> 01:15:50,338
But this guy rules over Dubai.

1355
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:53,278
He is Don Tandon.

1356
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:57,014
Salute him or he'll
shred you to pieces.

1357
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,210
Hold on a minute.

1358
01:16:01,522 --> 01:16:03,080
Hold on a second.

1359
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:06,588
Run!
- Run!

1360
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:08,391
Kill them!

1361
01:16:10,097 --> 01:16:12,156
Hey! No!

1362
01:16:12,466 --> 01:16:14,593
Run in a zigzag line!

1363
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,006
Don't dance, you have to run!

1364
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:25,909
You didn't give us the details!

1365
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:29,677
You caught me by the collar,
didn't you?

1366
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,077
I apologized.

1367
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:32,482
How will you save yourself novﬂ

1368
01:16:34,555 --> 01:16:37,388
Here you go! Take this.

1369
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:40,518
Thank you, my friend.
You fight so well. - Run!

1370
01:16:40,594 --> 01:16:42,653
Hurry!
- Damn!

1371
01:16:43,664 --> 01:16:45,359
Start the car!
- Hurry!

1372
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:49,660
Man, that was close!

1373
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:52,504
We were in deep trouble!
- Thank you, dude.

1374
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:55,268
You are a don,
how could you thank me?

1375
01:16:55,342 --> 01:16:56,639
I had to save you.

1376
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,975
Why do you keep calling me don
all the time?

1377
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,106
The underworld don? Aren't you?

1378
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,377
Underworld?
- Yes.

1379
01:17:04,451 --> 01:17:06,248
Nobody knows us in Esselworld

1380
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,912
and you claim we hail
from the underworld.

1381
01:17:08,422 --> 01:17:11,084
He keeps calling me don
and they rained bullets on me.

1382
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:14,220
Aren't you an underworld don?
- No, I am not.

1383
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:17,622
I was scared of you for no reason.

1384
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:19,963
You are not a don?
- For the thousandth time, no.

1385
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:22,229
Get down. Get down from the car.

1386
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,964
This is my car.
You should get down.

1387
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,506
Don't change the topic. I overheard
you talking the other night

1388
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,574
on the phone to Dubai.
- Dubai?

1389
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:32,669
I was on the phone with my elder cousin,
Balwinder Tandon who lives in Dubai.

1390
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:35,275
You talked about his stuff
was left in the car. What was that?

1391
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:39,649
The stuff? That would be his
girlfriend Sonia's photo. - Sonia.

1392
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:41,546
Sonia is the stuff?

1393
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:43,681
He didn't want his wife to find out

1394
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,448
and "stuff" is his code word.

1395
01:17:45,526 --> 01:17:47,926
You are too much. Stop the car.

1396
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:52,021
Get down the car! Now.

1397
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:55,292
What can I expect
from guys like you?

1398
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,348
Sorry for calling you don.

1399
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:16,612
Thank you for saving my life.

1400
01:18:22,596 --> 01:18:24,655
I guarantee,
it won't cost less than 15%...

1401
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:27,024
Why are you after my life?
What's all this?

1402
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:28,466
These gifts! These cards!

1403
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:30,668
Why do you call me all the time?

1404
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,439
You guys have already put us
in so much trouble.

1405
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,303
My sister's engagement broke off,
all thanks to you.

1406
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:36,908
My father got shot at.

1407
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:38,270
If father didn't...

1408
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:40,012
practice 'kapalbhati' every day,

1409
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:43,311
he would've had
at least six heart attacks.

1410
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:45,485
So only your dad has a heart.

1411
01:18:45,552 --> 01:18:47,213
What about my heart? Is it hernia?
- Yes.

1412
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:48,447
Listen to me.

1413
01:18:49,223 --> 01:18:51,657
Petty quarrels and tiffs
are a part of life.

1414
01:18:51,959 --> 01:18:53,984
Dad didn't get shot, did he?

1415
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:55,255
What if he was shot?

1416
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:57,422
Then all our problems are over
and our love story begins.

1417
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:00,399
Really! You are disgusting!

1418
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:02,663
As long as I am alive,

1419
01:19:02,936 --> 01:19:05,268
I won't marry anyone else, but you.

1420
01:19:05,339 --> 01:19:08,308
Even if I die,
I won't change my mind.

1421
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:09,364
As of now.

1422
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:11,240
I won't marry you!

1423
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:13,573
I would rather... Rather...

1424
01:19:13,947 --> 01:19:15,539
I would rather marry this waiter.

1425
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:18,143
But I am already married.

1426
01:19:18,252 --> 01:19:19,378
Please give me some time.

1427
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,248
I don't care and
you don't you dare!

1428
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:30,988
"Why do you skirt eyes
all the time?"

1429
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:38,303
"Why do you twist the key chain
all the time?"

1430
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:46,044
"Why do you skirt eyes
all the time?"

1431
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:49,981
"Why do you twist the key chain
all the time?"

1432
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:53,645
"Oh my love, tell me."

1433
01:19:53,921 --> 01:19:57,288
"Tell me, my sweetheart."

1434
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,665
"Oh girl!"

1435
01:20:14,074 --> 01:20:16,508
"Baby, take the hint."

1436
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:20,273
"Look, howl suffer!"

1437
01:20:22,182 --> 01:20:28,451
"Your "senti" words drives me
mental and makes me sentimental."

1438
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:34,121
"I am a bee and you are a bud."

1439
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:38,130
"I won't let you go,
where are you going?"

1440
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:41,599
"Oh my love, tell me."

1441
01:20:41,668 --> 01:20:45,297
"Tell me, my sweetheart."

1442
01:21:06,326 --> 01:21:08,260
"You're full of crazy waves."

1443
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:10,228
"Your words is lilting music."

1444
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:13,266
"I live by the sliver of
your sweet memories."

1445
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:15,969
"You're full of crazy waves."

1446
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:17,970
"Your words is lilting music."

1447
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:21,064
"I live by the sliver of
your sweet memories."

1448
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:23,610
"Open the door to your hearts."

1449
01:21:25,546 --> 01:21:28,982
"Let me sail ashore now,
I am drowning."

1450
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:31,949
"The moon shines on."

1451
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,313
"I am sure there's
something about it."

1452
01:21:37,057 --> 01:21:43,292
"Only your sweet words
make my lonely heart restless."

1453
01:21:45,299 --> 01:21:49,167
"Your charms are
out of this world."

1454
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:53,002
"Like the sun set on the beach."

1455
01:21:53,073 --> 01:21:56,736
"Why do you skirt eyes
all the time?"

1456
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:00,537
"Why do you twist the key chain
all the time?"

1457
01:22:00,614 --> 01:22:04,448
"Oh my love, tell me."

1458
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:08,045
"Tell me, my sweetheart."

1459
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:12,156
"Oh my love, tell me."

1460
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:15,525
"Tell me, my sweetheart."

1461
01:22:36,483 --> 01:22:40,544
Of course, I'll build a girl's
school in your village, Kantibhai.

1462
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:43,455
Why are you punishing my daughter?

1463
01:22:44,057 --> 01:22:46,525
He hung up on me.
- Dad, may I say something?

1464
01:22:46,593 --> 01:22:49,153
Once I'm done with
Nimisha's marriage,

1465
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:52,596
then I'll find you
a handsome husband.

1466
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:54,700
Contribution time! Make it quick!

1467
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:56,629
Contribution time!

1468
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,995
Here.
- Do you think I'm a beggar?

1469
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,140
You hand me a hundred.
Get me ten thousand bucks.

1470
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:03,233
I have an idea.

1471
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:05,907
You should take over my garage
and I'll pay you ten grand.

1472
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:07,578
So you won't agree easily,
will you?

1473
01:23:07,948 --> 01:23:09,643
Guys, time to break things. Quick!

1474
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:12,385
There you go. Come on.
- Hey, wait.

1475
01:23:12,486 --> 01:23:14,477
I'll hit you with this!

1476
01:23:16,189 --> 01:23:18,123
Hey, what's going on here?

1477
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:20,557
Patel, stay out of this. Move.

1478
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:23,429
Is he your friend?
- He is my enemy, so what?

1479
01:23:25,165 --> 01:23:26,928
It doesn't matter who he is.

1480
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:29,467
For every Gujarati,
business is like a sacred duty.

1481
01:23:29,536 --> 01:23:30,594
It doesn't matter
whose business it is.

1482
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:32,332
Don't you dare even touch his car.

1483
01:23:32,472 --> 01:23:35,407
We are from the
Social Reform Party.

1484
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:37,602
You should reform yourself
and then worry about the society.

1485
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:39,145
Get lost from here.

1486
01:23:39,212 --> 01:23:40,372
All right, I'll leave now.

1487
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,381
But tonight, I'll come with my guys

1488
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,044
and I swear, I'll reduce
your and his shops to a rubble.

1489
01:23:45,118 --> 01:23:46,551
Get lost!

1490
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,178
Hey!
- Hey!

1491
01:23:50,624 --> 01:23:52,023
He just threatened us.

1492
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:53,959
Why mess with him?

1493
01:23:54,027 --> 01:23:55,358
Don't be scared, brother.

1494
01:23:56,096 --> 01:23:58,360
We are still around.
- We don't need you.

1495
01:23:58,465 --> 01:24:01,332
He'll be here!
- Silence!

1496
01:24:02,402 --> 01:24:04,131
It won't help us if we are scared.

1497
01:24:04,471 --> 01:24:06,439
We must come together and defend
our housing society.

1498
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:10,169
Those who utter 'Sat Shri Akal'
- Their wishes are forever fulfilled.

1499
01:24:10,243 --> 01:24:13,508
Billa, Pinky, Kukki and Sweety.
- Yes, brother.

1500
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,548
Defend the back entrance.

1501
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:16,946
Sure.
- Go.

1502
01:24:17,184 --> 01:24:18,276
And
you gu
-Yes! YS!

1503
01:24:18,552 --> 01:24:20,918
Stand and guard your houses.

1504
01:24:21,288 --> 01:24:23,119
Go! Don't be scared.
We are with you.

1505
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:25,349
Why are you carrying a sword?
- I want to kill someone.

1506
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:27,518
I won't kill you,
I'm here to protect you.

1507
01:24:27,928 --> 01:24:28,622
Take care of your daughters.

1508
01:24:28,695 --> 01:24:31,562
Daddy, I'll go on patrolling.
- Bravo, my son.

1509
01:24:32,466 --> 01:24:34,331
Hasmukh, hold this.

1510
01:24:34,401 --> 01:24:36,494
Time to guzzle up.
- Hold on a second.

1511
01:24:37,037 --> 01:24:39,471
Drinking isn't allowed in this
society. I've told you already.

1512
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:43,134
Wow! You allow a sword
that can spill blood

1513
01:24:43,377 --> 01:24:45,345
but you don't allow liquor
that soothes your heart.

1514
01:24:45,412 --> 01:24:47,539
Everything's allowed in emergency.

1515
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:51,106
All right, but don't drink near the
temple. Find a corner.

1516
01:24:51,184 --> 01:24:52,446
Fine. Hold this.

1517
01:24:52,519 --> 01:24:54,248
Hold on to it. Hold!

1518
01:24:54,321 --> 01:24:55,652
Hold it!
- Not this.

1519
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,054
Hold it.
- No way.

1520
01:24:58,125 --> 01:24:59,956
Sissy. You're a scared Gujarati.

1521
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:03,428
I am not scared. The man who won
the battle of Bangladesh...

1522
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:06,125
General Manekshaw,
he was a Gujarati.

1523
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,465
I am a descendent of Sardar Patel

1524
01:25:08,535 --> 01:25:11,504
who united the entire India.
- All right.

1525
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:14,563
Unite the people
while I get stone drunk.

1526
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:27,251
What's going on here?

1527
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:30,687
We had enough of your bullying.
Did you hear me?

1528
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:33,050
I am Patel!
- Hey!

1529
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:35,054
If you are Patel, I am Patil.

1530
01:25:35,228 --> 01:25:36,525
Inspector Patil.

1531
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:39,326
You're waving that sword,
you want to start a riot!

1532
01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:40,661
No...
- Come on!

1533
01:25:41,001 --> 01:25:45,165
Tandon gave me this.
- Open the door. Get in. Move it.

1534
01:25:49,076 --> 01:25:50,668
Being educated you
provoke the riots.

1535
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:52,673
You too were involved
in Gujarat's riots, right?

1536
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:54,174
I don't know anything.

1537
01:25:54,247 --> 01:25:56,181
Last I had seen such live swords

1538
01:25:56,249 --> 01:25:58,342
in the hands of Shivaji
and Rana Pratap.

1539
01:25:58,418 --> 01:25:59,316
Shut up.

1540
01:25:59,419 --> 01:26:01,717
Sir, this is my sword.

1541
01:26:01,988 --> 01:26:04,252
Actually, I had gone out

1542
01:26:04,324 --> 01:26:06,087
telling him to hold my sword.

1543
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:07,991
I told you it is his sword.
Now, let me go.

1544
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:10,991
How did you get that sword?

1545
01:26:11,064 --> 01:26:11,996
Talwar gave it.

1546
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:13,394
How did you get this sword?

1547
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:16,129
Talwar.
Ramesh Talwar from Sion, Koliwada.

1548
01:26:17,003 --> 01:26:18,197
Now forget him and
release him first.

1549
01:26:18,271 --> 01:26:19,568
You don't know me.

1550
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:22,574
Who are you?
- Guggi. Mr. Guggi Tondon.

1551
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:23,974
So?

1552
01:26:24,177 --> 01:26:26,645
My uncle Chamanlal Tondon.
- Yes.

1553
01:26:26,913 --> 01:26:28,608
His maternal uncle Girdharilal.
- Yes.

1554
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:31,042
His nephew Bhawarlal's relative

1555
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:32,551
is the commissioner of this area.
- Oh.

1556
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:35,110
Yes. Shall I call him up?
- Inder.

1557
01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:36,613
Lock him up as well.

1558
01:26:36,923 --> 01:26:40,415
Wonder what was my sin to get
familiar with the Punjabi people.

1559
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:43,558
Don't worry, Patel.

1560
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:45,689
Next two days are weekends.

1561
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:47,456
Then Monday is bank holiday.

1562
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:51,335
By Tuesday we will definitely get
the bail. I'm sure. Don't worry.

1563
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:54,167
Are you on a package
tour of three days?

1564
01:26:54,241 --> 01:26:56,266
This is jail and
not any picnic spot.

1565
01:26:56,610 --> 01:27:00,239
Excuse me.
Who's the in charge here?

1566
01:27:00,313 --> 01:27:02,406
Who wants to get transfer?

1567
01:27:02,549 --> 01:27:06,144
Ladakh, Kanyakumari, Gurgaon.

1568
01:27:07,187 --> 01:27:08,381
Wait a minute.

1569
01:27:09,156 --> 01:27:11,989
Sir, set them free. Okay?

1570
01:27:13,126 --> 01:27:14,491
That's it?

1571
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:19,923
Actually...
- See big dreams.

1572
01:27:21,668 --> 01:27:24,660
Inder, lock him up as well.

1573
01:27:26,139 --> 01:27:27,470
Don't worry, uncle.

1574
01:27:27,674 --> 01:27:29,335
We will go to the
supreme court in the end.

1575
01:27:30,343 --> 01:27:32,607
You're not alone, my friend.

1576
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:34,476
We are with you.

1577
01:27:34,514 --> 01:27:37,608
Let me see who sets you free.
- I will do that.

1578
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:42,078
Will you also bribe me novﬂ
- Bribe?

1579
01:27:43,089 --> 01:27:46,354
Did we accept bribe to drive
away British from the country?

1580
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,960
Did we accept bribe to get freedom

1581
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:52,260
for the 30 crores
of Indians in 1947?

1582
01:27:53,366 --> 01:27:54,458
Who's he?

1583
01:27:54,568 --> 01:27:56,229
He's Gandhiji. Everyone knows him.

1584
01:27:56,303 --> 01:27:59,397
Who's the fourth
person on his left?

1585
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,598
Who's he?
- Myself.

1586
01:28:01,975 --> 01:28:03,533
My name is Prem.

1587
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,339
Prem lal Tondon.

1588
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:07,312
I am a freedom fighter.

1589
01:28:08,114 --> 01:28:10,309
Sir.
- 66 years ago

1590
01:28:10,383 --> 01:28:13,011
I had got beaten up
by the British officers.

1591
01:28:13,086 --> 01:28:15,145
Over here, sir?
- No, on the left.

1592
01:28:15,288 --> 01:28:16,585
Here? Oh sorry.

1593
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,387
What's the use?

1594
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:21,052
My father didn't get married so
as to join the fight for freedom.

1595
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:22,287
Even I didn't get married.

1596
01:28:22,362 --> 01:28:25,126
And is this how my son

1597
01:28:25,465 --> 01:28:27,899
is getting treated
in the independent India?

1598
01:28:30,036 --> 01:28:32,470
Calm down, sir. Please.

1599
01:28:33,006 --> 01:28:34,371
What will you take, sir?

1600
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:37,669
Bring some south Indian steamed dishes
with chutney in separate bowls.

1601
01:28:37,944 --> 01:28:40,174
Okay.
- But If you wouldn't set them free

1602
01:28:40,247 --> 01:28:42,613
I will go on hunger strike
and your order will get wasted.

1603
01:28:42,682 --> 01:28:44,274
Sir, it won't get wasted.

1604
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:46,148
But the bullets I had
happily welcome on my chest

1605
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:47,117
in British era have gone wasted.

1606
01:28:47,187 --> 01:28:49,246
Now, should I face these bullets

1607
01:28:49,322 --> 01:28:52,120
to save these three?
Shall I shoot?

1608
01:28:52,192 --> 01:28:53,489
No.
- Shoot, freedom fighter.

1609
01:28:53,526 --> 01:28:54,652
Shoot.
- No, sir.

1610
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:58,220
How can I do that, sir?

1611
01:28:58,598 --> 01:28:59,997
I will set them free, sir.

1612
01:29:00,066 --> 01:29:01,693
Good, your papa came on time.

1613
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:03,595
Otherwise,
I would have gone on hunger strike.

1614
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:05,331
He called me a terrorist.

1615
01:29:05,405 --> 01:29:07,339
All this mess has happened
because of sword.

1616
01:29:07,407 --> 01:29:08,396
You messed it up.

1617
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:10,636
Will you remove the sword on
every trivial matter? Is it a pen?

1618
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:12,639
Leave it, uncle.

1619
01:29:12,912 --> 01:29:16,177
Why are you? He's a garage owner.
You own a grocery store.

1620
01:29:16,316 --> 01:29:17,908
You've im mense knowledge.

1621
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:19,449
Gujarati intelligence.

1622
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,654
I've the knowledge
but not have 5 million.

1623
01:29:22,922 --> 01:29:24,082
How will I arrange that?

1624
01:29:28,895 --> 01:29:30,021
I've an idea.

1625
01:29:30,096 --> 01:29:32,530
Uncle, you should go to the show.
A quiz show.

1626
01:29:32,565 --> 01:29:34,328
KKC.

1627
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:36,363
'Whose fate will favour him?'

1628
01:29:36,436 --> 01:29:38,427
You will surely win.

1629
01:29:38,505 --> 01:29:40,439
You will win name and money.

1630
01:29:40,507 --> 01:29:42,372
You're genius by blood.

1631
01:29:42,442 --> 01:29:44,535
KKC.
- Yes.

1632
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,473
Just a minute.

1633
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:49,309
Why are you so much
concern about me?

1634
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:52,147
Because I had been jailed.

1635
01:29:52,485 --> 01:29:53,918
I understood the difference
between right and wrong.

1636
01:29:54,154 --> 01:29:56,054
I've experienced transformation.

1637
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:57,111
What kind of transformation?

1638
01:29:57,324 --> 01:29:59,485
Anyone can use the sword.

1639
01:29:59,559 --> 01:30:01,584
But you, uncle.

1640
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:06,431
Can win 5 million
by playing in KKC.

1641
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,526
Just sitting at one place.

1642
01:30:09,636 --> 01:30:12,400
Really?
- 100%.

1643
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:14,940
Leave it, son.

1644
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,301
This isn't his cup of tea.

1645
01:30:17,377 --> 01:30:20,107
You just make packets at your shop.

1646
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:23,247
He doesn't know anything about KKC.
This isn't your cup of tea.

1647
01:30:23,316 --> 01:30:24,544
What if I win?

1648
01:30:25,385 --> 01:30:26,977
What if I win?

1649
01:30:27,187 --> 01:30:29,280
Will you bet?
- Yes.

1650
01:30:29,356 --> 01:30:30,550
Okay, bet.
- Done.

1651
01:30:30,623 --> 01:30:32,113
I am with you.

1652
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:35,484
Where did Vivekanand go for the
parliament of the world's religion.

1653
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:37,654
A. New York.
- Yes.

1654
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:39,655
B. London.

1655
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:41,598
C. Chicago.

1656
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:43,499
D. Karachi.

1657
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,504
Religious meeting in Karachi?

1658
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:46,603
Chicago.

1659
01:30:46,673 --> 01:30:48,140
There's one more interesting thing.

1660
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,267
The one who had helped him

1661
01:30:50,343 --> 01:30:52,971
was Manibhai Nabubhai Dwivedi.

1662
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:54,411
He was also Gujarati scholar.

1663
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:57,279
How did you know
so much about Guajrat?

1664
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,313
Were you Gujarati
in your past life?

1665
01:30:59,753 --> 01:31:02,187
When was Mumbai
stock exchange formed?

1666
01:31:02,255 --> 01:31:04,689
1834, 1906,

1667
01:31:04,991 --> 01:31:06,185
1856 or

1668
01:31:06,259 --> 01:31:08,557
1834.
- Correct.

1669
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:10,994
And it was formed by Gujarati.
- Yes.

1670
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:12,554
This is about Sensex.

1671
01:31:12,665 --> 01:31:16,658
Sage Vatsayan who wrote
the first book on sex

1672
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:19,661
called Kamsutra was also Gujarati.

1673
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:23,636
I had a doubt about this.

1674
01:31:26,346 --> 01:31:29,372
The song I came to
sing remains unsung.

1675
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:32,244
I've spent my entire life

1676
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:35,151
stringing and unstringing
my instrument.

1677
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:36,479
Who said this?

1678
01:31:36,556 --> 01:31:38,615
Rabi ndranath Tagore.

1679
01:31:39,092 --> 01:31:40,354
Correct.
- Go ahead.

1680
01:31:40,427 --> 01:31:42,088
Yes.
- No, stop.

1681
01:31:42,162 --> 01:31:44,687
You eat first.
- No, grandma.

1682
01:31:45,432 --> 01:31:46,729
Today I am observing fast.

1683
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:48,558
'Nirmala Ekadashi'.

1684
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:50,227
It's called 'Nirjala Ekadashi'.

1685
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:53,731
Correct answer.
- Do you really observe fast?

1686
01:31:53,973 --> 01:31:56,271
Ever since I'm with you,
I don't know why

1687
01:31:56,543 --> 01:31:59,478
but I've lost interest
from non-veg food and liquor.

1688
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,011
Girls, romance.
You've lost interest in everything.

1689
01:32:02,348 --> 01:32:04,339
No, not to that extent.

1690
01:32:04,617 --> 01:32:06,209
Come on, go ahead. Next.

1691
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,084
What happened?
- Nothing.

1692
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:16,492
Uncle. Uncle,
I had a request to make. - What?

1693
01:32:17,964 --> 01:32:20,091
I want to come with you in KKC.

1694
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,628
Actually,
you're not needed but you can come.

1695
01:32:24,003 --> 01:32:26,164
You will also learn something.

1696
01:32:31,177 --> 01:32:32,235
What?

1697
01:32:42,422 --> 01:32:44,617
VM jewellers presents

1698
01:32:44,691 --> 01:32:46,386
in 'Whose fate will favour him?'

1699
01:32:46,459 --> 01:32:49,485
Today we've Mr. Patel is on hot seat.

1700
01:32:49,562 --> 01:32:51,325
Mr. Patel, your fate
is actually favouring you.

1701
01:32:51,431 --> 01:32:53,456
You've played very well so far.

1702
01:32:53,533 --> 01:32:57,162
So the next target
is for 5 million.

1703
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,302
What will you do?

1704
01:32:58,371 --> 01:33:00,032
Is this enough or you
will continue playing?

1705
01:33:00,106 --> 01:33:02,574
No, I will play and win.

1706
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,237
So, tell me.

1707
01:33:04,611 --> 01:33:07,978
What will you do
with such a big amount?

1708
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:12,245
If I will win 5 million
I will donate it.

1709
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:14,946
In a village in Gujarat

1710
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:16,511
I will establish girl's school.

1711
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:18,648
Save daughters, educate daughters.

1712
01:33:19,225 --> 01:33:20,351
Then I won't play.

1713
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:24,292
Your intentions are really noble.

1714
01:33:24,364 --> 01:33:27,162
So even I wish you
to win this round.

1715
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:31,192
So, now we are moving
on to the googly round.

1716
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:33,204
Googly?
- Yes.

1717
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:36,333
In this I will ask you

1718
01:33:36,409 --> 01:33:38,070
a tricky question
that appears simple.

1719
01:33:38,144 --> 01:33:39,372
So, com puter.

1720
01:33:39,979 --> 01:33:43,540
Show the googly question
on Mr. Patel's screen.

1721
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:46,451
In the game of cricket

1722
01:33:46,486 --> 01:33:49,319
how many balls make one over?

1723
01:33:49,522 --> 01:33:53,049
Your options are A. 6 balls.

1724
01:33:53,192 --> 01:33:55,057
B. 3 balls.

1725
01:33:55,361 --> 01:33:57,158
C. 5 balls.

1726
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,160
And D. One ball.

1727
01:34:00,233 --> 01:34:01,598
It's an easy question.

1728
01:34:01,668 --> 01:34:03,693
One over comprise of six balls.

1729
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,962
Mr. Patel, recall your dream.

1730
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:09,074
School in a village.

1731
01:34:09,142 --> 01:34:10,439
Girls' school.

1732
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:12,273
If you give a wrong answer

1733
01:34:12,345 --> 01:34:15,280
you will lose all the amount
you've win till here.

1734
01:34:16,316 --> 01:34:19,251
You're confusing me now.

1735
01:34:19,419 --> 01:34:21,387
If you're confused then

1736
01:34:21,454 --> 01:34:25,015
you can use friends'
advice service.

1737
01:34:25,058 --> 01:34:27,583
Do you have any friend
who knows about cricket?

1738
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,287
I don't have a friend.

1739
01:34:29,662 --> 01:34:32,153
But I have an enemy.
Can I call him?

1740
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:35,361
Okay, we don't mind. Go ahead.

1741
01:34:35,969 --> 01:34:38,460
So, call Guggi Tondon.

1742
01:34:38,705 --> 01:34:40,070
Computer.

1743
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:42,403
Call up Guggi Tondon.

1744
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:46,412
You're needlessly worrying.

1745
01:34:47,547 --> 01:34:50,516
Yes. - Guggi, one over
comprises of how many balls?

1746
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:52,380
6, 5, 2, or 1?

1747
01:34:52,452 --> 01:34:54,181
One over comprises
of how many balls?

1748
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:55,447
How many?
- One.

1749
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:57,486
What?
- One.

1750
01:34:57,657 --> 01:35:00,091
Okay. okay.
- It's very simple.

1751
01:35:00,193 --> 01:35:02,218
Hello. Oh hello.

1752
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:05,220
Strange. I was going to tell him
it is six balls.

1753
01:35:05,298 --> 01:35:06,959
But he disconnected the call.

1754
01:35:08,067 --> 01:35:11,002
Option D.
There's only one ball in one over.

1755
01:35:11,137 --> 01:35:13,037
Mr. Patel, are you sure?

1756
01:35:13,072 --> 01:35:15,063
Yes, option D. One ball.

1757
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:19,101
You're taking the risk of 5 million.
- Yes.

1758
01:35:20,146 --> 01:35:22,273
Shall I freeze it?
- Yes.

1759
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:31,954
What happened?
- What have you done, Mr. Patel?

1760
01:35:32,225 --> 01:35:34,284
One ball in one over?

1761
01:35:37,597 --> 01:35:40,191
It was the question of 5 million.
- These Punjabis have ruined me.

1762
01:35:40,266 --> 01:35:42,166
If you had told me

1763
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:45,500
that it is option A. Six balls.

1764
01:35:45,972 --> 01:35:48,338
Then I'd have said that

1765
01:35:49,108 --> 01:35:51,508
your answer is wrong, Mr. Patel.

1766
01:35:52,578 --> 01:35:55,206
One over comprise of one ball only.

1767
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:56,612
It's just that it
is thrown six times.

1768
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:58,241
You've won.

1769
01:35:59,085 --> 01:36:01,986
You mean I've won?

1770
01:36:03,523 --> 01:36:05,423
Hail Goddess!

1771
01:36:08,494 --> 01:36:09,392

1772
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:12,921

the girls' school in your village.

1773
01:36:13,299 --> 01:36:15,130

alliance final novﬂ

1774
01:36:15,468 --> 01:36:18,130

01:36:18,204 --> 01:36:21,332
Hasu.
- Congratulation, papa.

1776
01:36:21,407 --> 01:36:23,466

get the entire credit.

1777
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:25,369
Where's Monty?

1778
01:36:25,445 --> 01:36:28,005
He has taken a
vow for your victory.

1779
01:36:28,081 --> 01:36:29,309

I'm bound to your words."

1896
01:42:24,503 --> 01:42:26,437
"I'm the only one
crazy after your beauty."

1897
01:42:26,505 --> 01:42:29,406
"I am the only one.
Yeah, Hail Gujarat!"

1898
01:42:29,442 --> 01:42:31,307
"Morning shines bright here."

1899
01:42:33,212 --> 01:42:35,203
"Hail Gujarat!"

1900
01:42:35,414 --> 01:42:38,645
Wow, that was wonderful.

1901
01:42:39,318 --> 01:42:41,650
I've no words to express.

1902
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,688
It was so fantastic.
- So, did you see novﬂ

1903
01:42:44,156 --> 01:42:45,282
Good memory.

1904
01:42:45,424 --> 01:42:47,324
It's not about memory, uncle.

1905
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:49,984
What would you like to listen?
Kathiyawadi?

1906
01:42:50,129 --> 01:42:52,097
Kachhi, Surati.

1907
01:42:52,164 --> 01:42:55,258
Charotari, pure Gujarati.

1908
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:57,564
You can ask me to
speak in any tone, man.

1909
01:42:57,636 --> 01:42:59,695
Man?!

1910
01:43:00,372 --> 01:43:03,569
I will show you what
Gujarati language is.

1911
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:05,475
Wait a minute.

1912
01:43:06,545 --> 01:43:08,342
Sit down.
Don't disturb me. Sit down.

1913
01:43:39,278 --> 01:43:40,404
Now tell me.

1914
01:43:41,147 --> 01:43:44,480
How many 'Dh' I have used in these
lines and how many 'A' were used?

1915
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:45,608
Tell me that.

1916
01:43:46,452 --> 01:43:47,646
Are you quiet novﬂ

1917
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,587
Prating like a
parrot will not help.

1918
01:43:50,656 --> 01:43:54,148
You need to be Gujarati
from your heart.

1919
01:43:55,961 --> 01:43:58,361
Just by wearing handloom,
no one can become Gandhi.

1920
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,955
And no one can become
Gujarati by taking a disguise.

1921
01:44:01,033 --> 01:44:02,500
You're too much, Hasmukh.

1922
01:44:03,269 --> 01:44:05,032
At least value

1923
01:44:05,204 --> 01:44:07,672
his efforts made for his love,
his Pooja.

1924
01:44:08,941 --> 01:44:10,670
This boy has changed his lifestyle.

1925
01:44:10,943 --> 01:44:12,604
He stopped eating non-veg,
stopped taking liquor.

1926
01:44:13,145 --> 01:44:15,477
And you're not giving
up your stubbornness.

1927
01:44:15,548 --> 01:44:17,379
How will I do that? Hovﬂ

1928
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:21,012
For a Gujarati girl
he learnt Gujarati.

1929
01:44:21,086 --> 01:44:23,281
If he likes a Tamil girl tomorrow,
he will learn Tamil.

1930
01:44:23,355 --> 01:44:24,947
So will my daughter
do the household chores?

1931
01:44:26,525 --> 01:44:28,493
He's a loafer type Punjabi.
- Enough.

1932
01:44:29,128 --> 01:44:30,026
Enough is enough.

1933
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:33,557
What's your problem with Punjabis?

1934
01:44:34,033 --> 01:44:35,330
I've a problem.

1935
01:44:36,135 --> 01:44:39,593
You don't know what
Pat Singh did with me.

1936
01:44:39,672 --> 01:44:42,163
Pat Singh. Pat Singh.    www.TamilMV.re

1937
01:44:42,241 --> 01:44:43,970
Who's this Pat Singh?

1938
01:44:44,043 --> 01:44:46,978
And what did he do that you're
prejudiced about all the Punjabis?

1939
01:44:47,947 --> 01:44:49,437
Pat Singh is not Punjabi.

1940
01:44:49,715 --> 01:44:51,182
He is Gujarati.

1941
01:44:52,084 --> 01:44:55,451
And unfortunately he's my son.

1942
01:44:55,654 --> 01:44:57,144
Yes.
- What?

1943
01:44:59,992 --> 01:45:03,428
People give their children
pat names like Chunnu or Munnu.

1944
01:45:03,696 --> 01:45:07,097
By hatred I call my son Pat Singh.

1945
01:45:07,299 --> 01:45:08,425
Pat Singh.

1946
01:45:09,902 --> 01:45:12,894
He married a Punjabi
girl and fled off.

1947
01:45:13,505 --> 01:45:15,666
He fled to America forever.

1948
01:45:16,575 --> 01:45:20,011
I folded my hands at him.
I pleaded to him to return home.

1949
01:45:21,146 --> 01:45:22,238
But he didn't come.

1950
01:45:23,315 --> 01:45:27,046
I've already lost my
son due to a Punjabi family.

1951
01:45:28,687 --> 01:45:30,279
But not this time.

1952
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:32,054
Not at all.

1953
01:45:33,525 --> 01:45:37,552
Look. You too are a father.

1954
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:40,022
You can understand.

1955
01:45:40,532 --> 01:45:44,093
What if she was your
daughter in place of mine?

1956
01:45:45,437 --> 01:45:48,702
Please don't snatch
away my daughter.

1957
01:45:50,209 --> 01:45:52,336
Otherwise, I will die.

1958
01:46:02,221 --> 01:46:03,381
Let's go, my child.

1959
01:47:16,462 --> 01:47:19,898
Papa, don't get angry, I love you.

1960
01:47:23,268 --> 01:47:27,068
Papa, I will miss you.

1961
01:47:31,343 --> 01:47:36,212
Hasu, you always abused our
Pankaj by calling him Pat Singh.

1962
01:47:36,615 --> 01:47:40,551
Will you call your Pooja,
as Poney Tondon?

1963
01:47:40,619 --> 01:47:42,109
Reform your nature now.

1964
01:47:42,388 --> 01:47:43,412
She will run away.

1965
01:47:43,489 --> 01:47:45,218
What are you saying?
She has already run away.

1966
01:47:45,657 --> 01:47:47,386
Idiots have helped her elope.

1967
01:47:50,195 --> 01:47:51,628
She will not elope.

1968
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:08,602
We respect our women
like the Goddess.

1969
01:48:09,348 --> 01:48:10,542
We don't teach them to elope.

1970
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:13,142
We are a warrior class.

1971
01:48:13,352 --> 01:48:15,149
But we are not robbers.

1972
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:18,654
Our community saves
the families and society.

1973
01:48:19,258 --> 01:48:20,657
They don't break families.

1974
01:48:23,595 --> 01:48:25,927
Come, my child.

1975
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,899
And yes, one more thing.

1976
01:48:30,502 --> 01:48:32,493
We are leaving this society.

1977
01:48:34,006 --> 01:48:36,133
What's the use of living in society

1978
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:38,039
where your hearts don't meet?

1979
01:48:39,511 --> 01:48:41,536
We couldn't settle

1980
01:48:42,281 --> 01:48:44,476
down with you all.

1981
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,676
Yes.

1982
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:49,951
I thought we will
live here lovingly.

1983
01:48:50,155 --> 01:48:53,613
If we will stay here,
both these children

1984
01:48:54,326 --> 01:48:55,953
will remain said seeing each other.

1985
01:48:57,529 --> 01:49:00,692
So Mani ben. Bye.

1986
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:03,961
You always said

1987
01:49:04,636 --> 01:49:06,570
that you love your daddy a lot.

1988
01:49:09,274 --> 01:49:11,504
And I liked this thing
about you the most.

1989
01:49:11,944 --> 01:49:13,935
It really touched my heart, you know.

1990
01:49:18,617 --> 01:49:20,482
I can't separate you from him.

1991
01:49:20,552 --> 01:49:21,951
I just can't do this.

1992
01:49:29,995 --> 01:49:32,589
Let's go.
- Guggi.

1993
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:35,457
Yes.

1994
01:49:36,335 --> 01:49:38,496
You wanted to open
a super market, right?

1995
01:49:39,505 --> 01:49:42,565
This is the key to my house.
You can open it there.

1996
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:45,301
Don't worry about the money.
You can give me anything you want.

1997
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,007
Yes, but do sell beer
in your supermarket.

1998
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:53,276
Chilled beer.

1999
01:49:54,353 --> 01:49:55,911
Bye. Let's go.

2000
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:07,522
Send as many cars as you can.
Thank you.

2001
01:50:07,699 --> 01:50:11,362
Guggi, you're too much.

2002
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:19,234
Father.

2003
01:50:21,113 --> 01:50:22,705
Monty is our son.

2004
01:50:23,315 --> 01:50:24,612
And Monty is now in love.

2005
01:50:25,217 --> 01:50:27,185
We must do something.

2006
01:50:29,221 --> 01:50:31,189
Why did you call me here again?

2007
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:33,984
I said I don't want to
form any alliance with Punjabis.

2008
01:50:34,059 --> 01:50:35,356
And where is the father-son duo?

2009
01:50:35,494 --> 01:50:37,223
Wait a minute, sir.

2010
01:50:42,601 --> 01:50:44,398
Wonder what is going
on in their mind.

2011
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:45,637
Punjabis.

2012
01:50:45,704 --> 01:50:47,604
I will never agree
for this alliance.

2013
01:50:51,243 --> 01:50:52,540
Let's go, mom. They will not come.

2014
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:54,602
This is enough. Let's go.

2015
01:51:01,186 --> 01:51:03,450
There they have come.

2016
01:51:20,339 --> 01:51:21,465
You came very early.

2017
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:24,668
You know what, sir?
Old car and old alliances

2018
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:27,105
take time to repair.

2019
01:51:27,212 --> 01:51:28,577
Not for our victory.

2020
01:51:29,982 --> 01:51:31,711
But for your life. Look there.

2021
01:51:43,629 --> 01:51:45,028
Papa.

2022
01:51:45,998 --> 01:51:48,398
'Pat Singh is not Punjabi.
But Gujarati.'

2023
01:51:48,467 --> 01:51:50,162
'He's my own son.'

2024
01:51:50,235 --> 01:51:53,068
'He has married a Punjabi
girl and fled away.'

2025
01:51:53,505 --> 01:51:54,665
Please forgive...

2026
01:51:56,241 --> 01:51:57,299
this Pat Singh.

2027
01:51:59,177 --> 01:52:02,271
'I begged at him.
I pleaded at him to return home.'

2028
01:52:02,547 --> 01:52:04,606
'I am alone. You please come back.'

2029
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:06,177
'But he didn't come.'

2030
01:52:07,386 --> 01:52:10,219
Make me your Pankaj Patel again.

2031
01:52:14,993 --> 01:52:16,119
I grab my ears.

2032
01:52:18,063 --> 01:52:19,360
Please forgive me.

2033
01:52:22,134 --> 01:52:23,158
Yes, Patel.

2034
01:52:24,236 --> 01:52:26,670
Actually, I had gone to the airport to
receive your son and daughter-in-Iaw.

2035
01:52:27,072 --> 01:52:28,164
That's why I am late.

2036
01:52:29,141 --> 01:52:31,132
I've called them from Canada.

2037
01:52:33,045 --> 01:52:34,672
You may reject my friendship.

2038
01:52:35,514 --> 01:52:36,947
But please accept them.

2039
01:52:39,685 --> 01:52:41,175
Papa, please forgive me.

2040
01:52:41,286 --> 01:52:43,550
I will never leave
you and go to Canada again.

2041
01:52:44,656 --> 01:52:46,146
By swear of Goddess Amba.

2042
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,593
Look there. Your grandpa.

2043
01:52:50,128 --> 01:52:51,322
Grandpa.

2044
01:52:53,498 --> 01:52:55,227
Forgive them, friend.

2045
01:52:57,969 --> 01:52:59,960
By swear of my enmity.

2046
01:53:02,274 --> 01:53:03,298
Come.

2047
01:53:16,988 --> 01:53:19,479
Yes, son. That's good.

2048
01:53:23,995 --> 01:53:25,394
Come. Come.

2049
01:53:25,997 --> 01:53:27,396
He's your grandson.

2050
01:53:27,632 --> 01:53:29,600
This is the spirit. Here, take him.

2051
01:53:29,968 --> 01:53:31,663
We, the human are strange.

2052
01:53:31,937 --> 01:53:34,462
We send big rockets
far away to the space.

2053
01:53:34,539 --> 01:53:37,975
But we ignore the small
complaints of our near ones.

2054
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,304
Are you happy novﬂ

2055
01:53:39,511 --> 01:53:41,001
Did you do this for me?

2056
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:42,580
Yes, son.

2057
01:53:42,714 --> 01:53:45,945
We, Punjabis can break bones.

2058
01:53:46,017 --> 01:53:48,679
But we can't break a heart.
- Yes!

2059
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:51,716
But this is cheating, you know.

2060
01:53:52,591 --> 01:53:54,650
I will yell and tell everyone

2061
01:53:54,726 --> 01:53:57,559
that you have defeated
me with your goodness.

2062
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:01,058
Seriously.
I thought you are robbers.

2063
01:54:01,133 --> 01:54:04,193
But you've brought
back my treasure.

2064
01:54:05,203 --> 01:54:07,000
I forgive all your mistakes.

2065
01:54:08,073 --> 01:54:09,597
And now my daughter is yours.

2066
01:54:09,674 --> 01:54:11,938
Really? Final? Come here.

2067
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:13,600
So, is this alliance final?

2068
01:54:13,678 --> 01:54:15,339
But I have a condition.

2069
01:54:15,413 --> 01:54:18,109
Please, I will do anything.

2070
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:19,583
I will become a celibate.

2071
01:54:19,651 --> 01:54:20,913
I will get the vasectomy done.
- Hey.

2072
01:54:20,986 --> 01:54:21,975
Please, don't put another condition.

2073
01:54:22,053 --> 01:54:22,644
I can't do it.

2074
01:54:22,921 --> 01:54:24,582
Listen to the condition first.

2075
01:54:24,656 --> 01:54:28,387
This marriage will take place
by Gujarati and Punjabi rituals.

2076
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:29,654
Yes, of course.

2077
01:54:29,928 --> 01:54:33,364
It will be called as
Patel's Punjabi wedding.

2078
01:54:39,704 --> 01:54:48,043
"O bride your groom has
come with the wedding procession."

2079
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:58,488
"Bride, your groom
has come to marry you."

2080
01:54:58,557 --> 01:55:00,184
Now you also sing something.

2081
01:55:00,258 --> 01:55:04,194
"Play the clarinet
and beat the drums."

2082
01:55:04,396 --> 01:55:08,127
"Clarinet and drums."

2083
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,565
"Clarinet and drums."

2084
01:55:11,636 --> 01:55:15,367
"Play the clarinet
and beat the drums."

2085
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,536
"Play the clarinet
and beat the drums."

2086
01:55:19,611 --> 01:55:26,175
Come on - "The groom's
hair is shining bright."

2087
01:55:26,251 --> 01:55:33,020
"The groom's hair
is shining bright."

2088
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:37,557
"Bring the auspicious
henna for him."

2089
01:55:37,696 --> 01:55:41,564
"Bring the auspicious
henna for him."

2090
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:48,105
"Henna leaves its colour
on my groom's palm."

2091
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,935
Someone please sing
the song of henna.

2092
01:55:50,008 --> 01:55:53,671
"Henna sapling is planted in Gujarat"

2093
01:55:53,945 --> 01:55:57,108
"and it's colour spread
across the Punjab."

2094
01:55:57,182 --> 01:55:59,980
"Henna has spread its colour."

2095
01:56:00,051 --> 01:56:03,452
"Henna sapling is planted in Gujarat"

2096
01:56:03,521 --> 01:56:06,422
"and it's colour spread
across the Punjab."

2097
01:56:06,491 --> 01:56:09,619
"Henna has spread its colour."

2098
01:56:10,095 --> 01:56:12,325
Now sing something from your side.

2099
01:56:12,597 --> 01:56:16,033
"Ballay ballay"

2100
01:56:16,101 --> 01:56:19,502
"Dance on the tunes of Punjabi."

2101
01:56:19,571 --> 01:56:22,665
"She can't walk without
proper sole in the footwear."

2102
01:56:22,974 --> 01:56:25,033
"Dance on the tunes of Punjabi."

2103
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:28,910
"Ballay ballay"

2104
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:32,313
"Red car has come with flowers,
0 bride."

2105
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:35,911
"You've all the comforts
at your in-Iaw's house."

2106
01:56:36,021 --> 01:56:39,184
"If you marry my brother, you
will fly to the foreign country."

2107
01:56:39,257 --> 01:56:43,023
"You've all the comforts
at your in-Iaw's house, Bride."

2108
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:46,187
"Red car has come with flowers,
0 bride."

2109
01:56:46,264 --> 01:56:49,597
"You've all the comforts
at your in-Iaw's house."

2110
01:56:49,668 --> 01:56:53,934
Come, girls, start dancing.
Come on, dance.

2111
01:56:54,439 --> 01:56:57,067
Come, ladies.
Don't feel shy. Come with me.
