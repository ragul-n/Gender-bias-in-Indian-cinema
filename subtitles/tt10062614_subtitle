1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
<i>I'll ask you again.</i>

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,360
<i>Where were you on Wednesday,
February 14th, 2018?</i>

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,440
You've kept me here for over four hours.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,240
Stop playing at 'True Detective'.

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,680
How can I remember something
that happened a year ago?

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,480
Please answer the question, Tashi.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
The same question again?

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,240
- Do I have to look at the camera?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,560
On February 14th, 2018, I was in college.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,280
It was St. Martin's Founder's Day,

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,240
Asif Shaikh was performing.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,360
And everyone was there.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,200
The rest of the band members?

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
What about them?

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
What were they doing?

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,640
What do college kids do at concerts?

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Everyone was smashed.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,640
Tashi, I hope you realize that
you're all over 18.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,720
No longer 'kids' in the eyes of the law.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,440
When did you last see
Vijay and her together?

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
Can you turn off the camera?

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
Sorry man, can't.

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,400
Look, dude, it's pretty simple.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
Our bro's a decent guy,

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
and that bitch is a whore.

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,880
This is MeToo being misused,
to its full power.

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
<i>Listen, now that my lips...</i>

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,240
- My man!
- What's up?

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,456
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good. Yeah, how is it going?

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,480
- How are you?
- I'm using "silence" again.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
- Thank you so much for this.
- Thank you, sir.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Listen.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
- Our man can never pull this off.
- Of course he can.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,760
It's not that difficult also.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,760
He can't become Freddy Mercury.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,880
Anyone can be anyone they want.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
- Like in <i>Metamorphosis.</i>
- What?

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
By <i>Kafka.</i>

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Who fucked who?

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Pass me the doob...

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,720
Listen. bro.

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
It's your composition. Your lyrics.

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320
Why don't you sing it this time?

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
If you've the balls,
then say it to VJ's face?

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
VJ's sycophant.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,280
Stop screwing with him.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
VJ scares the shit out of him.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,560
And you love sucking up to him, right, KP?

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
Are you still in high school?

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,920
Ten days left for
Transcend Fest submission.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,376
- Exactly.
- We still don't have a scratch..

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Put it on my tab.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
Just saying.

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,760
Nanki. My smoke!

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,120
Are we having a jam session?

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
- Do you know what you are, Tashi?
- What?

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,960
You're VJ's balls.

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
The left one.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,200
If I am VJ's balls,
then you're my pubes...

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
- Asshole.
- What shit.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
- Nanki. What's up?
- What's up?

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,800
I heard you stopped
attending union meetings.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,080
Been busy, Jha.

64
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,840
Actually, we need an interview
for the student union's newsletter.

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Can you help?

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,920
I'll speak to VJ.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,160
No, not VJ.

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,120
We want to do an article
on the songwriter of Doobydoo Crew.

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,040
You see, our star reporter, Arnab here

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,560
- is all set to write a fantastic report.
- Very eager.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Nice try, but that's not going to happen.

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,280
VJ... VJ, stop it! Put me down!

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,720
VJ, stop it!

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,880
- The problem with you is you're too slow.
- stop it.

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,000
Foucault's theory of power

76
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,000
What may I ask are you doing,
Mr. Vijay Pratap Singh?

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Sorry, sir.

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,720
Nanki Dutta, the future Rhodes scholar
from our prestigious institution..

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,040
was found in a state
of utter distress in the corridor.

80
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
I simply had to don my cape for
the greater good of the college

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,640
and save our invaluable asset,
Ms. Dutta.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,200
And what distress could
Ms. Dutta possibly be in

83
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,080
within these hallowed halls of
St.Martins and under our watchful eye?

84
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
So, you see, I scooped her away
from the evil clutches

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,880
of the diabolical debating society.

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
Sir, trust me you've no idea

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
how traumatising it is to be
harassed by college intellectuals

88
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
#MeToo

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
All right,
settle down, settle down.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
So, let's get back to
what we were talking about.

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Foucauldian theory of power in the...

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,440
See? I even convinced your local guardian.

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
No more sneaking out.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
Wow, my hero.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
New tattoo?

96
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,480
- Show.
- Stop it.

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,000
- Come on.
- Stop it, he's looking.

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,360
And I thought you were
not that into me.

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I am not.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,000
What could the V possibly be for?

102
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Virginia Woolf.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,560
...and other political theory.

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,240
Miss Dutta.

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,320
What was the last thing I said?

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Dr. Roy, we were studying
the Foucauldian theory of... power.

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,336
Why don't you come and sit
down over here at the first row?

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Come.

109
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,120
Sit. Right here in front.

110
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
So, the Foucauldian theory of power in
the context of feminist literature..

111
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,040
Man, I'll be honest with you.

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
VJ, never really had to try hard.

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,080
It does not make sense, right?

114
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,080
The coolest girl in college
was already his girlfriend.

115
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
And she definitely had the feels for him.

116
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
And her...?

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,240
Did she have these "feels" for him?

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
It was different with her.

119
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
She's a fuck girl.

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
"Out, out, brief candle!"

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
"Life's but a walking shadow,"

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,600
"a poor player, that struts and
frets its hour upon the stage.."

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Judges...

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,696
"and then is heard no more."

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
- Not applicable.
- "It is a tale told by an idiot,"

126
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,840
"filled with sound and fury,"

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,560
- "signifying nothing."
- Why are these guys performing today?

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,840
Hello, friends.

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
- Oh, hi.
- DRAM SOC, hi, what's up?

130
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,816
Fuck off, please.
Thank you very much.

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,680
Wait!

132
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,696
"Out, out, brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow."

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,296
"A poor player that struts and
frets its hour upon the stage..."

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,000
- I said fuck off.
- "signifying nothing."

135
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,240
And with that, Mr. Shakespeare,
Tanu Kumar signing off.

136
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
VJ!

137
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
VJ,

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,600
unfortunately, I cannot join your band.

139
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
I've joined Kerbie's band.

140
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,040
And I am going to perform on stage.

141
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
You really love to perform, don't you?

142
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,680
- Come on, show me what you got.
- Don't be an asshole. Let it go.

143
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,840
Should I escort you to Dhanbad now?

144
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Should I?

145
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,120
"The poet tells an ancient tale

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,040
about a girl's
lustful coming-of-age story.

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,920
What a delicate face o lord!

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
But her vagina was a bottomless fjord.

149
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Small, fat...

150
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,000
short or long."

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
Bro, has she lost her mind.

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,920
"Hand her an electric rod.

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
Whatever the world could tender,

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,680
had not the might to bend her.

155
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
A sage then found something worth.

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,680
An elephant's hooked tooth handy in girth.

157
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,080
He shoved it in her steaming engine.

158
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
She rode it like a train in motion.

159
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,800
Moments and hours passed unbridled.

160
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,520
All her troubles fell by idle,

161
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
when she screamed in ecstasy,

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
'I am coming,

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I am coming,

164
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,600
I am coming,

165
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
I am coming,

166
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,880
Don't stop, keep going,

167
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,840
I am still coming.'"

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Can we practice?

169
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,560
You know the difference
between a girl and a 'girl'.

170
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,440
So she was a bit like... that.

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Yeah.

172
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Like what?

173
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
An easy rider.

174
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,160
Bro, you look like Storm

175
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,960
from the X-Men.

176
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,920
I mean it's not exactly white.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a bit grey.

178
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
And you're exactly an asshole.

179
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,136
What do you think of the word
'Sargoshiyaan' (whispers)?

180
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
<i>Whispers...</i>

181
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,280
But how will this fit
in the meter of the song?

182
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
What the fuck! You don't even listen.

183
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,560
- How are you, bro?
- My professor screwed me.

184
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,200
Give me a smoke. What are you doing?

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Nice change.

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
What about her look?

187
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
Shall we tell them best of luck?

188
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll be back.

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Hey, VJ!

190
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
When is it?

191
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,200
- Happy V Day.
- What's up, bro.

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
I am performing today as well.

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Opening act.

194
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,160
Watch me!

195
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm gonna slay.

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
She's gonna 'slay'.

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
Of course, we're going to watch.

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
VJ, listen up.

199
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,240
You can even come backstage with me.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
Interesting, but we've band
practice. So let's go.

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,960
Do I look stupid to you?
I'm doing the opening act.

202
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,880
- What are you even practicing for?
- Yeah, what for?

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,656
- Move aside.
- Does she look stupid to you?

204
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
VJ, Asif Shaikh is looking
for a kickass lyricist.

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,040
And no one writes better
songs than you in DU.

206
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,400
Do you want me to introduce you?
I can do that.

207
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,200
I am the songwriter.

208
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
- Hi!
- That's right.

209
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,160
I thought he took you on board
because you're his girlfriend.

210
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
That was, oh my God!

211
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,200
I wouldn't have taken that.

212
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Nanki, I wouldn't have taken that.

213
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm joking.

214
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
- Bro... sorry.
- Bye, bro.

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,640
Listen, she's new here.
She doesn't know a thing.

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,680
There's no band without you.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
You know that, right?

218
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Leave it.

219
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,880
Happy Valentine St. Martin.

220
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
How's everybody doin'?

221
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,360
<i>On the night of the concert, Asif Shaikh
was singing his usual 90s hit songs.</i>

222
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,840
What the fuck, Asif Shaikh!

223
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Got a lighter?

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
<i>Winter had set in,</i>

225
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,680
<i>but the temperature was soaring
due to Valentine's Day.</i>

226
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,960
The music is fuck all.

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Here.

228
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>Wait... wait a minute.
Please tell me clearly, Tashi.</i>

229
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>Were you with VJ or not?</i>

230
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,200
<i>We were rolling joints,
with Tarun and Raj,</i>

231
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,920
<i>VJ's boarding school buddies.</i>

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
<i>They would often come to our college
to smoke up.</i>

233
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,320
Tanu had hit the jackpot
because she took a sip from VJ's beer.

234
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Don't. Don't.

235
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,880
<i>She kept coming on
to him the entire night.</i>

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
- VJ.
- Nanki.

237
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,480
VJ, it's V day.

238
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
VJ. Come.

239
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,640
<i>All I remember from this point,
after smoking the joint,</i>

240
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,520
<i>is four of them sneaked into VJ's room
through the hostel's back gate.</i>

241
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,080
Come along, VJ.

242
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
And then?

243
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Then what?

244
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What happened then?

245
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,040
Then I passed out.

246
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,520
<i>But what will you do
with all this information?</i>

247
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,160
<i>File a case.</i>

248
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,800
<i>So tell me,
when did you hear of Tanu again?</i>

249
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,280
<i>After that night,
Tanu disappeared completely.</i>

250
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,240
<i>Fully off the radar situation.</i>

251
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
<i>Rumor was that she'd flunked,</i>

252
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,400
<i>which was pretty obvious.</i>

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
One can only survive in Martin's on merit.

254
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
Quotas don't get you far here.

255
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,400
And then one day, out of nowhere,
during the MeToo ruckus...

256
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,800
Perfect. This is what I am looking for.

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,520
- Looks good.
- Looks good, man.

258
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,440
- Do you think this will work?
- A little bit.

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,720
You won't believe
who has been called out this time.

260
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,320
Stop building suspense
and just tell me who it is this time?

261
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
Shamsher Khan.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
- Actor?
- Yeah.

263
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
What the fuck.

264
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,200
You know in some sense

265
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Draupadi was the first Indian badass
who MeToo'd..

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
and actually insisted on justice.

267
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,640
What? What about Sita then?

268
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
Ravan asked politely.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
He didn't force himself on her.

270
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,120
So you're saying
abduction is not creepy.

271
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,280
It was a war crime.

272
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,760
There was no Geneva Convention back then.

273
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,720
# believeher #timesupdrinkupandshutup

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
My God, a casting
director is out, bro.

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,840
Don't know, don't care.

276
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,160
Bollywood guys are screwed.

277
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Fucking screwed.

278
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,720
What screwed.

279
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
It's all a fucking
calculated compromise.

280
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Really can't say shit
like that anymore, bro.

281
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
The hashtag police will come and get you.

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,880
There you go
with your feminist statements again.

283
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
You're a woman, after all.

284
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,320
So, I want to get this done.

285
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
Say what bro...

286
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,560
Bro, you don't know Nanki.

287
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
I can't hear you, bro. Speak louder.

288
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,400
What is this nonsense, asshole.

289
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
What?

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Guys, this is serious.
Pick up your bags and leave.

291
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,696
Bro, what the fuck has happened?
Are you going to say something?

292
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
- We're in deep shit.
- What happened?

293
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,840
Bro, Tanu has MeToo'd our bro.

294
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,360
- VJ?
- Yes.

295
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
- She's MeToo'd him.
- What the fuck!

296
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I am calling him.

297
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,800
Nanki come on let's go.

298
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,600
<i>Can't keep quiet anymore.</i>

299
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,880
<i>Feb 14, 2018, I was raped by</i>

300
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
VJ Pratap Singh!

301
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,800
What? My heartthrob?

302
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,360
As his friends watch
the show and laughed.

303
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,640
@St.Martin's College.

00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,920
This is full hashtag whoring man.

307
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,360
You know guys, they do drugs as well.

308
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,000
But get this guys,
do you know what her handle is?

309
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360

310
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,000

<i>I am wounded just like you</i>

<i>Your state is just like mine</i>

315
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,960
"You are wounded just like me.

316
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,120
I am wounded just like you."

317
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,920
In these times of MeToo, you should
do these things behind closed doors.

318
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,080
I feel relieved seeing
that you are normal.

319
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,720
Otherwise your sincerity always
scared the shit out of me.

320
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
You impressed the boss.

321
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,800
<i>I, too, am in a state of mess</i>

322
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,240

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
<i>Tanu Kumar has tweeted</i>

326
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>that Vijay Pratap Singh raped her
on Valentine's Day, 2018.</i>

327
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
She is lying.

328
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,440
VJ refused to date her

329
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,080
so now she's going
all Gone Girl on him.

330
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,200
And what were you doing there that night?

331
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,920
It was Valentine's Day, bro.

332
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Checking out chicks.

333
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,840
There were five people in that room.

334
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Four.

335
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,280
The duo, Tarun Khanna, and me.

336
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,400
<i>But when VJ and she started going at it,
we checked out.</i>

337
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>Who is #EvilLaughter?</i>

338
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Who knows?

339
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,760
She never makes any sense.

340
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
And you're taking her seriously.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>Tanu Kumar has tagged VJ,
Raj Khosla and you in her tweet</i>

342
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,880
<i>with the hashtag no means no.</i>

343
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>Does this mean she resisted?</i>

344
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,400
<i>So did you try to stop VJ?</i>

345
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,600
I mean, why stop them?

346
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
It was their personal affair.

347
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,640
And they are adults.

348
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
When we felt this is
about their privacy, we left.

349
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,920
You're saying it was consensual, Tarun.

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Fully! 100%.

351
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,800
I also want you to know,

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,200
I mean this is no 'outrage of modesty'
because VJ...

353
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Yes.

354
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,800
Can you please make him
sit in conference room 3?

355
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Thank you.

356
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,520
Bro,

357
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,920
I told VJ, she is fucking crazy.
So take it slow.

358
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
But VJ, being a nice guy,

359
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,720
pittied Tanu.

360
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,120
He said, "She was here on scholarship.

361
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,720
We'll let her perform one song."

362
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,160
And now we're all screwed.

363
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,480
<i>You see, this happened three days ago..
when the Tweet surfaced..</i>

364
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,040
<i>Sanket, Siddharth, Aakash, Disha...</i>

365
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
Fuck. Guys aunty is here.

366
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,120
Dev Sir, we'll have to file
a defamation case... today.

367
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,760
And I think this is just a publicity stunt
trying to cash in.

368
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,920
Hardy, does Nanki know?

369
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,016
Kerbie has tweeted as well.

370
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,536
You know Dev sir, this is just a
new trend these girls have started.

371
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,080
And our stupid kids fall prey to it.

372
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,520
Okay, try Nanki at the library.

373
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,280
- Yes.
- Let's go from here.

374
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,720
No, there's been
no official complaint yet.

375
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,960
I've already reached
out to the Commissioner.

376
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,000
But what about the internet,
where it's already become a sensation?

377
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Not to mention, this is a golden
opportunity for the opposition party.

378
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,000
They've been trolling us ever since.

379
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Yes.

380
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,120
No, never.

381
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Of course not.

382
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,920
None of us will go.

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.

384
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Yes.

385
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Dev sir...

386
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,120
I need your best team of lawyers.

387
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Thank you.

388
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Yes.

389
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Here.

390
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Take it.

391
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,080
And don't tweet anything.

392
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,120
Stay away from social media.

393
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,040
Understand?

394
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,440
I haven't done anything.

395
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,376
Look, I understand
you guys are stressed

396
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,456
but, just let me go to the
Police myself, I'll handle this.

397
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
No, you're not going to the Police.
Not at all.

398
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
Pratap, you go.

399
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Of course...

400
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I'll go.

401
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,440
I am a Politician after all.

402
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,640
And I keep dealing with the law
all the time.

403
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Right?

404
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,440
Doesn't my career matter to you?

405
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Have some water man.

406
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Am I not answerable to my party?

407
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,696
Who will give an election
ticket to the father of a...

408
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,360
He hasn't done anything.

409
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
How do you know?

410
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,160
- Were you there?
- Then don't do anything.

411
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,760
Look, I don't need
you guys to do anything.

412
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,080
I can handle it myself.

413
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,360
Son, please...

414
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,240
You won't step out of the house!

415
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>VJ's privileged.</i>

416
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,176
<i>So people are likely to think
that he's at fault.</i>

417
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,080
Even when he has done nothing.

418
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,400
She isn't answering my calls.

419
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,320
Come on.

420
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,240
There's going to be trouble today.

421
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
You cannot go inside, sir.

422
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,480
- This is not the first time I've got in.
- I have my orders.

423
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
Just move aside.

424
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,400
Calm down, man.

425
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,040
I'll lose my job.

426
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,480
Nanki.

427
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,440
Keep this.

428
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
CCTV is working.

429
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
- VJ, don't do this.
- Get lost!

430
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,616
Bro, this can be a problem.
You will regret.

431
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,120
Tashi, come here.

432
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,960
Have you lost your mind? Let's go.

433
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,240
VJ, like seriously, dude.

434
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Call Nanki!

435
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
- Calm down.
- Nanki!

436
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,440
Call, Nanki!

437
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
If you guys don't leave
I'll call the warden.

438
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,360
- Go ahead.
- Just wait.

439
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,040
- Nanki.
- Nanki.

440
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,840
Now shut the guard up.

441
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,440
Seriously, guys, you're fucking it up.

442
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
Why aren't you answering my calls?

443
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Why didn't you come home?

444
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Baby, I don't know why
this happened to us.

445
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,600
I haven't done it.

446
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,920
Do you think I did it?

447
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,680
And you know what
dad thinks I've done it.

448
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,640
He told me he thinks I've done it.
You know me right?

449
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,440
I haven't done it.

450
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
- I don't know what to do?
- I know.

451
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,720
<i>So Nanki didn't go to see VJ
after the tweet.</i>

452
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,760
Seems like an unlikely match.

453
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
I mean...

454
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
Nanki...

455
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
is the daughter of two college professors.

456
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,560
VJ's father is a politician
and real-estate magnate.

457
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,480
Mother was a former model

458
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,320
and is now the toast of Delhi society.

459
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,840
What are you trying to imply?

460
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,000
We pick our friends because of that?

461
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Do you even fucking know how we met?

462
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,960
That was in your first year,
if I'm not mistaken.

463
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,440
Aye, Arnab, asshole, what is this?

464
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
She barged right in
the boys hostel toilet.

465
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,560
She climbed on top of the counter.

466
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,920
She climbed up and
wrote that in bold letters.

467
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,176
I was right here
controling my urge to pee.

468
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
"I'm not who I look like,
I am who I write like."

469
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
<i>Nanki Dutta, did you write that inside?</i>

470
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,560
Yeah. Did you like it?

471
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
I liked it.

472
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,720
You should write songs.

473
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,200
For who? You?

474
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Yes.

475
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
Anything wrong with me?

476
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Must be something.

477
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,960
Everyone's flawed.

478
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Let's find out.

479
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,640
Nanki. Vandalism, really?

480
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
Problem child.

481
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,640
Come along, come to my office now.

482
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,880
What is all the commotion?

483
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
What is this? Just not done..

484
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Come on.

485
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,680
Boys toilet? Really?

486
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,520
What a player bro. Very smooth, yeah.

487
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,880
Here come the love birds...
very much on time. Assholes.

488
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,440
<i>But then this problem child
wrote such sweet songs.</i>

489
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,840
<i>You</i>

490
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,440
<i>Are not the one</i>

491
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,320
<i>For whom I felt infinite love</i>

492
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,040
<i>You</i>

493
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,560
<i>Are not the one</i>

494
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,480
<i>My habit you had become</i>

495
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,480
<i>Why have you returned?</i>

496
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,000
<i>To show me a mirror of myself</i>

497
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
<i>Why have you returned?</i>

498
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,080
<i>To shield me from myself</i>

499
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,320
<i>Leave it</i>

500
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
<i>Let me be alone</i>

501
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,120
<i>Let me be alone</i>

502
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,680
<i>Let me be alone</i>

503
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,920
<i>Are you</i>

504
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,440
<i>The one?</i>

505
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,840
<i>Whom I have been missing</i>

506
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,040
<i>Are you the one?</i>

507
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,600
<i>Whose presence I have sensed</i>

508
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,320
<i>Come</i>

509
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
<i>Allow me to show you</i>

510
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,320
<i>A glimpse of lovely things</i>

511
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,840
<i>In the narrow lanes of lost desires</i>

512
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>Let me take you for a spin</i>

513
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,880
<i>Like an old wound</i>

514
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,480
<i>You have returned</i>

515
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,240
<i>Like a new salve</i>

516
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,360
<i>You have become</i>

517
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,600
<i>Leave it</i>

518
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,960
<i>By your pillow</i>

519
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,960
<i>Leave it</i>

520
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
<i>By your pillow</i>

521
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
<i>Leave it</i>

522
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
<i>By your pillow</i>

523
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,480
<i>Leave it</i>

524
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,960
<i>Let me be alone</i>

525
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,960
<i>Let me be alone</i>

526
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
<i>Hi, I am Danish Ali Baig.</i>

527
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,760
<i>I am investigating and prepping
all the witnesses in Vijay's case.</i>

528
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,200
How would you respond to
allegations of privilege on Vijay?

529
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
What does that have
to do with this?

530
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Got it.

531
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,120
They are going to make this about

532
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
him fooling around because
of his privilege, right?

533
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,240
Look, he's privileged. That's a fact.

534
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,920
Does he exploit it?
I don't think so.

535
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,320
This can be contested by the defense.

536
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,720
This document clearly shows that
Vijay didn't get into St. Martin's

537
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,480
on the basis of his marks.

538
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,880
You had no idea did you?

539
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
And this is exactly
what defence picks on.

540
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,960
Okay, you wanna talk
about privilege, then

541
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,240
shouldn't we be talking about
Tanu Kumar's lack of privilege?

542
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
And how she's manipulated that.

543
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,840
What's the long queue for

544
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,296
No one knows.
God knows what's going on.

545
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,880
We are standing here since 15 mins.

546
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
Rude as fuck!

547
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,320
The newbie has her head in the air.

548
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,360
- She's still washing clothes.
- Come out.

549
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,720
Are you deaf?
Do I use sign language instead?

550
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,136
Time to wash clothes is
between 2 pm and 4 pm. Come out.

551
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,320
I just got here from Dhanbad.

552
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,216
Don't care if you're from Dhanbad or
Dimapur. Rules are the same for everyone.

553
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Come on, out.

554
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,080
Who do you think you are?

555
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,960
You think your piercings scare me?

556
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Have you seen my tattoo?

557
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,440
- Bitch!
- Get out of here!

558
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,840
Take your hands off, whore.
Let me go!

559
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,120
- Let go of me.
- Give it to her!

560
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
Give it to her!

561
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,720
- Give it to her!
- Let me go!

562
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,160
No ma'am, I never teased
her for her vernacular accent.

563
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,880
What shit..she's
making all of this up.

564
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,400
You can ask anyone, madam.

565
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
She threatened me.

566
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Threw my clothes outside.

567
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,056
Bullshit. I never did that!
When did I do that?

568
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Girls!

569
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
All because I shared your bathroom.

570
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
She's always ragging me,

571
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
because I am from Dhanbad

572
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,040
and a scholarship student.

573
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
They try to demoralize me.

574
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,040
These upper-class, English-medium kids.

575
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What shit...

576
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,280
I am not blacklisting you, Nanki.

577
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,000
- Ma'am..
- But take this as last warning.

578
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Next time it's...

579
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,040
Tanu, you can finish
washing your clothes today.

580
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,360
But the time to wash clothes
is from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. strictly.

581
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Understood.

582
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
She's a fucking liar.

583
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
This only proves that
you're resentful of her.

584
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,320
As she is of me.

585
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,136
Look, I know you're thinking
that I am petty and entitled

586
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,360
but you don't know Tanu.

587
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
She can do anything to grab attention.

588
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,440
Including Me Too.

589
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,000
So are you saying that...

590
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,160
Tanu Kumar slept with your
boyfriend on Valentine's Day

591
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,040
to get back at you.

592
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,080
But what about your boyfriend?

593
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,760
- Why did he sleep with her?
- She made him.

594
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,280
Didn't he have a choice?

595
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
- You know how men are.
- Excuse me.

596
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
You heard me.

597
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,640
I know how I am. Let's not generalize.

598
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
She manipulated him.

599
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,440
And he got manipulated?

600
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Where are you going?

601
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,480
Hostel curfew at 8 pm.

602
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,920
We're not done yet Ms. Dutta.

603
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Come.

604
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,880
- I have a request to make.
- Yes, tell me.

605
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,320
If you need me for any
research or ground work

606
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,120
I've a friend who works
in Dubeyji's team.

607
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,720
Danish. Danish.

608
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,880
Could I get a lift to the metro?

609
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,360
- Of course.
- Thanks.

610
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Please.

611
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,120
No, don't change.

612
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,800
I love Faiz's poetry.

613
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,360
Shall I just drop you to the hostel?

614
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,160
That new one right? Banerjee West.

615
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm ex St. Martin's.

616
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Oh.

617
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,880
Which year did you pass out?

618
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
2015.

619
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,840
Wait, you got the Inlaks
Scholarship to Cambridge, right?

620
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,520
I saw your pictures. No wonder.

621
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,720
I am applying to Rhodes.

622
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,800
You have the HAIR for it.

623
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,680
Metro is fine. Thank you.

624
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Sure.

625
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,360
You were right.

626
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,600
He had a choice

627
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,120
Just made a bad one.

628
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,760
VJ came to meet me
after the concert that night.

629
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,440
I fucked up Nanki.

630
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Badly.

631
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,280
Why did you leave me alone
with her (at night)?

632
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,960
You left me alone with her.

633
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,336
- I was drunk and she was all over me.
- Yes, I wish I could unsee that.

634
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Listen.

635
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,920
Whatever happened,
it didn't mean anything.

636
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,240
She was coming on to me
as it was Valentine's Day.

637
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Just get to the point.

638
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,240
Baby, I still...

639
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,120
Get to the fucking point!

640
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,400
What did you do?

641
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,720
Get to the fucking point.

642
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I cheated on you.

643
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I slept with her.

644
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,480
You can ask Tarun and Raj.

645
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
She started it.
Kissing, grinding, everything.

646
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
Fuck you, man.

647
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
I was drunk.
I was drunk Nanki, I am sorry.

648
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,216
- Fuck you, I really can't believe..
- I am sorry.

649
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
I am sorry.

650
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,720
Don't fucking touch me.

651
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Please. Please.

652
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,680
Don't touch me!

653
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,440
Get out of here.

654
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Don't ever fucking touch me again.

655
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Fuck VJ! I can't believe.

656
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,440
Is that when you wrote that song?

657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What?

658
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,560
"You are wounded just like me.

659
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,040
I am wounded just like you."

660
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,200
Both the culprit
and the victim are injured.

661
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
It's... It's very mature.

662
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
<i>Neha!</i>

663
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
<i>Neha!</i>

664
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,720
<i>Yes tell me what happened?</i>

665
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,360
<i>Guess who is in college?</i>

666
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,520
Who?

667
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,040
<i>@TannMannDhann</i>

668
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,520
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

669
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,160
<i>The rape victim?</i>

670
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
<i>She's with the warden and the dean</i>

671
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,600
in the warden's office.

672
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,680
Why? What does she want now?

673
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,880
I guess..she's trying
to get back to the hostel.

674
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
The girl has guts.

675
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,040
It hasn't even been a week
since she MeToo-ed.

676
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,040
You should have seen
what she's wearing.

677
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,480
You raped him, slut!

678
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,240
What? You?

679
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
I slapped her.

680
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,080
VJ is guilty lots of things
but not rape

681
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
It's just a very hard time
for him right now.

682
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,040
Anyway Nanki.

683
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,600
It really helps VJ's case that
he confessed to you that night.

684
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
At the end of the day
you are his girlfriend.

685
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
And...

686
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,560
his honesty in your relationship
will work in his favor.

687
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,880
And I am so sorry I cut you.

688
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
You were saying?

689
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,760
The entire college knows she's using
Me Too just to get back into college.

690
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
And you're allowing it. How?
She failed!

691
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,480
First, you suspended VJ.

692
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
And now Nanki.

693
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Do you even realise the
message you're sending out there?

694
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,920
But at a time like this, when even the
college is being called into question

695
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
this child has gone and slapped a girl

696
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,040
who is claiming to
be a victim of sexual assault.

697
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,240
Two weeks of suspension
is very lenient.

698
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,480
That girl is lying.

699
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
That may be so,

700
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,080
but until the Internal
Complaints Committee makes a decision,

701
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,600
I cannot be seen taking sides.

702
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
But suspension at this time?

703
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
It's the week of finals, Dr. Roy.

704
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,560
I've got so much library
work to do for our project.

705
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,680
I've got... I haven't even started
finishing my applications. And...

706
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,176
This is going to cost me my entire future.

707
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,536
You can't be suspending me at this time.

708
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,840
I've got so much work to finish

709
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
You'll be all right.

710
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,640
I'll send all the books
and all the papers to your room.

711
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,040
You can ask warden Promila
for whatever you want.

712
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
But how am I going to complete it?

713
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,640
Use this time to finish your statement
of purpose

714
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,440
for the Rhodes scholarship, Nanki.

715
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,480
I am here.

716
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,320
Please don't tell my
parents about all of this.

717
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,120
Have I ever?

718
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,120
Problem is, event the faculties
will divide over this.

719
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,520
- We want to see..
- ICC!

720
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,640
- We want to see..
- ICC!

721
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,200
- Tanu Kumar!
- We're with you!

722
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,160
- Tanu Kumar!
- We're with you!

723
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,600
- Tanu Kumar!
- We're with you!

724
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,080
That's fine. Put it here.

725
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,480
That's enough.

726
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
Kerbie and the Student Union.

727
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,080
Singing for Tanu's justice is just a way
to promote his music career, right?

728
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,640
What's happened with Tanu,
it's really wrong Nanki.

729
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
It's not just us.

730
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,120
Other colleges are also
offering their support.

731
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,600
You're such bloody snakes.
Admit it. You guys have never liked VJ.

732
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,840
And now they are just targeting him.

733
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,400
Jha wants the seat in DUSU,
and you want inter-collegiate fame.

734
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,960
And anyway, after the ICC's decision,
VJ can join college,

735
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,280
if he's proven innocent, right?

736
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,640
His entire career is at stake, Arnab.

737
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,000
Do you even realise that?

738
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,920
This accusation has cost him his...
His whole reputation is in shit man.

739
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
You know we can't even
join the Transcend Fest anymore.

740
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,280
I completely understand your point.

741
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Nanki...

742
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,440
VJ's been good with you, right?

743
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,280
I am just asking like that.

744
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,840
Just casually.

745
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,600
You want something.

746
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
- Don't be...
- Arnab!

747
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
They are not even giving
him a chance to prove himself.

748
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,000
They only hate him
because of his power and money.

749
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,280
VJ is not a proven offender.

750
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,560
She forced herself on to him, dammit,
how many times do I have to repeat myself?

751
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Yes.

752
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
You did say.

753
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,440
You slapped her
because she raped him.

754
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Lunch?

755
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
No.

756
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,080
Will you go hungry till six o'clock?

757
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
Why am I here till six o'clock?

758
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,280
Because we have to get
your boyfriend off the hook.

759
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
And the office is only open till six.

760
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,920
<i>Ms. Dhanbad had OD'ed.</i>

761
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,040
<i>She was coming on to all of us,
and everyone was having fun.</i>

762
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,560
Nanki was fucking furious.

763
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,200
<i>If someone's trying to seduce
your boyfriend in front of your eyes,</i>

764
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,040
<i>you won't just
stand there and watch right.</i>

765
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,760
<i>Fuck Valentine's Day.</i>

766
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,240
Valentine's Day was just an excuse.

767
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,400
Later, she disappeared.

768
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
And after that, I...

769
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,200
And I was enjoying the
concert like a good kid.

770
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,480
I was drinking water, not even booze.

771
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,440
<i>And where was Tanu at this time?</i>

772
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
No VJ.

773
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,400
No Tanu.

774
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Nobody.

775
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,520
Pin-drop silence.

776
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,280
<i>From a distance,
it looked like a dog was shitting.</i>

777
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,480
But as I took a closer look,
it was fucking KP, puking.

778
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,040
<i>He can't drink. He's still a kid.
He can't handle it.</i>

779
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,200
But then I remember,

780
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,200
I saw Nanki outside the staff quarters.
She was looking for VJ.

781
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,120
And rightfully so.

782
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,920
<i>They were both missing. Tanu and Vijay.</i>

783
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,520
<i>After that, I think she headed
towards the boy's hostel.</i>

784
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,080
<i>Hang on. What time was it?</i>

785
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,840
1- 1:30am

786
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,560
<i>And you're sure Nanki
headed to the boys' hostel?</i>

787
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,000
<i>Of course I'm sure. I'm sober, bro.
What do you mean I'm sure?</i>

788
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
<i>Right.</i>

789
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,480
<i>Who's testimony am I</i>

790
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,280
<i>Who's testimony am I</i>

791
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,360
<i>Who's testimony am I</i>

792
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,160
Sir, Nanki.

793
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,920
Nanki, what are you doing here?

794
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,680
My suspension is over, sir.

795
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,160
How is it going?

796
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,416
It's going well. I just
have to ask her a few questions.

797
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,120
- She is dating him.
- Are you stalking me?

798
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Stalking?

799
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,680
Always over-reacting this child.

800
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Nanki.

801
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,800
Danish is an ex-student of mine.

802
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,600
She will cooperate. Nanki.

803
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,800
- I'll see you.
- Sure sir.

804
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,120
And now you're even in my college.

805
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,440
Isn't it hard enough?

806
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,240
- You don't answer my calls.
- So?

807
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,120
Nanki, I needed to know,

808
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,120
where were you on the night
of 14th February at 1 a.m.?

809
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,080
Why? It's going to prove VJ's a rapist?

810
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,400
Nanki, please listen...

811
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,280
You know what,
you listen to me now.

812
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,040
- Stop snooping around.
- What?

813
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,360
Stop checking my Insta-stories.

814
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,360
I can see you seeing
my Insta-stories.. And stop..

815
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,600
- I am doing my job.
- Stop looking at me like that.

816
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,680
Why the fuck did you look me like...

817
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,600
I am going to complain
to Sushma aunty.

818
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,800
- What happened to you suddenly?
- Watch it.

819
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Come.

820
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,200
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

821
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,920
Can I get you something Sushma?

822
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,816
- Drink.
- No, I'm good, Dev.

823
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,440
- Are you sure?
- Thank you.

824
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,400
- Danish, come.
- Sir.

825
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,840
Mrs. Pratap Singh has some concerns.

826
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,160
Sure.

827
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Are you here to defend
my son or frame him?

828
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,520
Let's just address the elephant
in the room. Shall we?

829
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,520
My son,

830
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,000
he may have slept with her,
but he has not raped her.

831
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,360
Because he is a good child.

832
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,400
He respects women.

833
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,320
And he has a very kind heart.

834
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,800
Do you know that he sponsors the education
of the children of our entire staff?

835
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,960
At his age.

836
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,600
How many boys do you
both know who do that?

837
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,040
Do you do that, Danish?

838
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,320
Ma'am, I am just looking at
it from the judge's perspective..

839
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,040
Let the judge do his job. Please.

840
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,640
Because even the judge knows
this is a defamation case.

841
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It is not a rape case.

842
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,360
We took a rather aggressive approach
by filing a defamation case.

843
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,960
Especially now in the times of Me Too

844
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,360
the judge and the media are going to come
at us with an equal amount of hostility.

845
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,160
What if the defence calls on
a new witness?

846
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,080
Hashtag evil laughter?

847
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,840
Who is it?

848
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,600
Which one of the three
is hiding information?

849
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,240
Tashi, Hardy or Nanki.

850
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,520
I need to know,
so that we can be prepared.

851
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,040
Ma'am, my job is only to
arm Mr. Mirchandani with

852
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,560
all the arsenal he needs
before we get to court.

853
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,040
He's there to win, ma'am.

854
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,920
Alright.

855
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,600
Come, Sushma.

856
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,560
I tell you, Sushma, these young girls...

857
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,840
- Danish.
- Sir.

858
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,280
...they all have lost their minds.

859
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,120
I'm on the verge of firing
all my female interns.

860
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,720
Guess what? I have written a new song.

861
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,640
Wait for it.

862
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,320
<i>Whose dream,</i>

863
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,680
<i>whose thought is this?</i>

864
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,720
<i>We'll let KP do something,
really cool.</i>

865
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:29,120
<i>In whose failure am I the catalyst?</i>

866
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,960
What the fuck.

867
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,760
Why would you do that?

868
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,760
Where were you that night, till 1 a.m.?

869
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,440
At Roy's, I told you.

870
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Why?

871
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,440
What do you mean "why"? Thesis work.

872
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,600
On Valentine's Day?

873
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,240
What was our whole fight
about earlier then, Nanki?

874
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,520
Didn't I tell you
that Roy's exploiting you

875
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,600
just to make you
ghost-write his thesis.

876
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,600
Didn't I tell you not to go?

877
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,640
What do you mean you said no?

878
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
I had to go. He's writing
recommendations for my scholarship.

879
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I really don't expect you to understand.

880
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Why?

881
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
Just say it.

882
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Say it.

883
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,560
I am not as privileged as you, right.

884
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,200
So, I'm going to have to get
myself exploited, in your words.

885
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,400
What?

886
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,960
Where is this coming from?

887
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
Come on, man, say it.

888
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,680
I saw your mark sheet.

889
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,800
You couldn't have
got in without pull.

890
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
So?

891
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,840
Stop trying to turn
this around on me, okay.

892
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,520
All I know is that
Roy should leave you

893
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,960
the fuck alone at 1:00 in the
night on any fucking given day.

894
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,920
VJ, I had to go, okay.

895
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
He called me because
he had that heart thing.

896
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,280
And he only has me over here.

897
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,080
How could he have told the faculty?

898
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,360
It could jeopardise his
entire deanship prospects.

899
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,080
He had to call me. I had to go.

900
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,560
What "heart thing"?

901
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,920
What heart thing?
Are you dumb or what?

902
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,960
A smart girl like
you can't see it.

903
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,920
He just wants to get
into your pants, that's all.

904
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,200
What?

905
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,200
If you keep indulging him,
you must be wanting it too, right?

906
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,496
What the fuck. How dare you
bloody talk to me like that, man?

907
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,760
What the fuck dude.
I can't believe it.

908
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,880
You're character assassinating me

909
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,200
when you're the one
who's bloody accused of rape.

910
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,496
- I am just saying what I feel, that's all.
- Fuck you dude.

911
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,736
Stop the car, I want to get out.

912
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,136
Stop the fucking car, I am serious
I am going to jump out of the car.

913
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,160
Stop the fuck. Stop the car.

914
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,080
Are you mad?

915
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,376
I told you I'll jump out of the car
if you don't stop the car right now.

916
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,016
I want to get out of your fucking car.
Stop it right now.

917
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,280
- Nanki, it's the middle of the road.
- I don't care.

918
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Are you...

919
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,080
Nanki.

920
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,456
- Nanki..stop it, dude.
- Go fuck yourself, man.

921
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,280
Where to, madam?

922
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,280
We'll take you for a ride.

923
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,360
Asshole!

924
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,800
I'll pull your fucking balls out!

925
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,080
Asshole!

926
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Bastard!

927
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
<i>Danish Ali Baig.</i>

928
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,600
<i>What's with your focus on me?</i>

929
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,880
<i>How does it matter
where I was that night at 1 am?</i>

930
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,000
<i>I am neither the victim,
nor the bloody accused.</i>

931
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,680
Why is this detail
important to the case?

932
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,680
Why did you try and get me fired?

933
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,400
What are you hiding?

934
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
I am not...

935
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
- There are no secrets, Danish.
- Really.

936
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,680
Okay, let me just put
this as simply as I can.

937
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,880
A gold-digging as fuck wannabe girl

938
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,400
wants a privileged guy
to be her boyfriend.

939
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,160
After they have sex,
the guy refuses to be her boyfriend.

940
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,416
It's as simple has hell
hath no fury like a woman scorned.

941
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,440
This is no Me Too.

942
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,680
She is just trying to take revenge. She's
out for retribution. Don't you see it?

943
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Unfortunately I do see it.

944
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,880
Now I need to show you. Come on.

945
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,720
<i>She was barefoot.</i>

946
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,640
Watch.

947
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,640
<i>- First thing I noticed.
- Any sign of injuries.</i>

948
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,720
<i>Yes.</i>

949
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,800
She was carrying her shoes in her hands.

950
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,880
She was kinda swaying.

951
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,560
I don't know. Maybe she was drunk.

952
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,360
Or she could be limping.

953
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,440
I am not saying that, sir. You are.

954
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,680
I said she was swaying.

955
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,520
So I saw Nanki after that.

956
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,160
She was coming from the Admin building.

957
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,320
<i>Tanu went up to her.</i>

958
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,360
<i>It felt like she was asking her something.</i>

959
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,920
<i>I thought Nanki will help her out.</i>

960
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,800
<i>But she pushed her away.</i>

961
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,560
I am focusing on you
because you skipped telling me this.

962
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,880
He's talking shit.
He was drunk out of his wits.

963
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,880
- Were you in the room?
- What?

964
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,480
Are you #Evillaughter?

965
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,720
Excuse me!

966
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
Did Vijay and you plan this revenge?

967
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,680
How dare you talk to me like that?

968
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,960
- Do you want to send VJ behind bars?
- What?

969
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,400
Have you got me here.

970
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,680
Are you trying to get
into my pants or something?

971
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,720
- Is this why you got me here?
- What?

972
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,640
You want to send VJ to jail because...

973
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,720
And I've been talking
to you all this time.

974
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,360
What are you saying?

975
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,280
VJ's going to go
to jail because of me

976
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,840
Ms. Nanki, are you alright?

977
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
It's my fault that he's going to go..

978
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,080
I've done it again.

979
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,680
Are you okay? Listen to me.

980
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,600
Nanki, just relax.

981
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,880
<i>Vijay, why do you
have a room in the hostel?</i>

982
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,360
We have to stay in the hostel,
for exams and all.

983
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,800
It's easier.

984
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,040
What's the big deal?

985
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,640
Big deal because you have
a seven-bedroom house in Sainik Farms.

986
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,160
What does that prove?

987
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,720
It proves entitled behavior.

988
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,160
The defense can argue that snatching
a deserving, outstation student's right

989
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,920
is not a big deal
for a privileged student like you.

990
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,000
It will further the argument
that you disrespect the system.

991
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
What?

992
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,480
Where is Dev uncle?

993
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,440
- Calm down, Vijay.
- Call me VJ.

994
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,200
Sorry I can't.
I am going to read you something.

995
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,640
"Can't keep quiet anymore."

996
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,400
"February 14, 2018, I was raped by..."

997
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,040
Yeah, I know. I've read that tweet.
I was tagged.

998
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,280
I had sex with her.

999
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,920
I am not proud of it
but I didn't rape her.

1000
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,120
And why would I rape her?

1001
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,960
Or anyone for that matter,
I've a girlfriend.

1002
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,160
And yet you cheated.

1003
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,120
#Nomeansno

1004
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,280
That means she must have...

1005
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Please, coming to
my room was her idea.

1006
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,440
I have witnesses.

1007
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,800
Raj, Tarun and not just them.

1008
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,520
The whole college knew that she wanted to
sleep with me that night.

1009
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,520
Do you know the difference between
consensual and forced sex, Vijay?

1010
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,160
What do you think I am?

1011
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,560
Do you think I don't know what sex is?

1012
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You think
Tanu's the only girl I've slept with?

1013
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,760
It was fucking consensual,
I am telling you.

1014
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,480
Why don't you deal with this, man?
I am telling you the truth.

1015
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,840
How are you Singh sir? Also has anyone
gone upstairs to call Ms. Nanki Dutta?

1016
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Okay. Thank you.

1017
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,360
Careful with the bags.

1018
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,760
Yes, yes.

1019
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,080
- Wait. Wait. Wait.
- Why?

1020
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,040
You can't go in
without the warden's permission.

1021
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,720
You guys know that.

1022
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,320
It's fine, fine. I can go on my own.

1023
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,560
I'll manage.

1024
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,600
The other bag.

1025
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,720
Pass my bag. I'll go.

1026
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,880
I'll go on my own.

1027
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,520
- Call us if you need anything.
- Thank you.

1028
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,120
Let's go. Come on.

1029
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Sorry Miss Dutta
I've come into your space again.

1030
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,520
You know I don't want to
make you feel uncomfortable or anything,

1031
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,080
but you never answer my calls.

1032
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,640
Anyway.

1033
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,040
I need to procure
some very important footage from

1034
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,640
a student's phone from that night.

1035
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,640
He isn't cooperating, and...

1036
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,440
Hardy said he won't say no to you.

1037
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Ohh...

1038
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,080
I thought you'd come to tell me
Tanu's back or something.

1039
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
Yes, she is back.

1040
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,480
And the ICC isn't even
operational anymore.

1041
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,520
Tanu is the complainant,
so she can come back.

1042
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
And please don't intimidate her.

1043
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,360
It will only weaken VJ's case.

1044
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,360
Unsolicited advice from the solicitor.

1045
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,160
I don't get it.

1046
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
I'm only doing this because it's my job.

1047
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,200
But this is your life Nanki.

1048
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,280
Don't you want to go beyond
this whole he said she said

1049
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,720
and know what actually
happened that night.

1050
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,680
Why? Will the truth set me free?

1051
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
I don't know.

1052
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,240
But denial surely won't.

1053
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,080
Sir.

1054
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,240
Hi.

1055
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,160
The videos are all here. I don't
know what he's trying to hide.

1056
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Thank you.

1057
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,200
Should I leave?

1058
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,560
No, come if you want.

1059
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
<i>Hey, come here.</i>

1060
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,040
<i>There's Nanki.</i>

1061
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,880
<i>- Look.
- Hold the phone. Hold it.</i>

1062
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,120
<i>Go on.</i>

1063
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,776
<i>- Should I leave a button open?
- No, no. It's perfect.</i>

1064
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,800
<i>Go, go.</i>

1065
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
I love you. I love you.

1066
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
What?

1067
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Is this some kind of freakin' joke to you?

1068
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,680
No, I was just not expecting this.

1069
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,320
You were not expecting what?

1070
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,560
You've been telling
me that I'm hiding stuff

1071
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,840
making me feel like I'm
some bloody freak or something.

1072
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
When actually you'll
have been hiding stuff?

1073
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,880
<i>- </i>Hiding what, Nanki?
- Hiding what? Seriously?

1074
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,240
The blood.

1075
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,520
What blood?

1076
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,160
Don't mind fuck me, okay.

1077
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,520
I saw the blood. Which means
it has to be in the evidence.

1078
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,720
You all have probably suppressed and...

1079
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,640
I don't get it.
What are you trying to do? Are you...

1080
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,160
What is this?
Some loyalty test or something.

1081
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,280
Like. What am I, the star witness.

1082
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,880
You're trying to make
me the snitch bitch. Why don't...

1083
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,720
Fucking playing mind games.

1084
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,680
Don't act so stupid, man.

1085
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,800
Nanki.

1086
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,520
What blood?

1087
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,680
Yes, Ashrut.

1088
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,200
I'm looking for some mention
of blood injury in this case.

1089
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,040
I remember you saying Dubey ji,
that you have a friend.

1090
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,680
Find out will you.

1091
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,200
Unbelievable.

1092
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,400
<i>On 15th February,
the morning after the alleged incident,</i>

1093
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,120
<i>Tanu filed a police complaint.</i>

1094
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,720
Yes, but it wasn't registered then.

1095
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,160
You're right, sir.

1096
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,560
There was no official FIR.

1097
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,040
But there's an entry
of the complainant in the records.

1098
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,960
Entries don't make a difference
when there was no official FIR.

1099
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,440
It's a weak case.

1100
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,760
The matter is pretty clear.

1101
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,560
And anyway, even the police
have some responsibility.

1102
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,840
They won't file
an official complaint so easily.

1103
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,280
But the Police are
notorious to not file cases like this.

1104
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
Danish.

1105
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Pratap.

1106
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,040
The point is, why didn't you tell us?

1107
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
Danish, please'

1108
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,960
This is going to be a landmark judgment.

1109
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,440
In the age of social media
and freedom of expression,

1110
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,480
anyone can say what they want.

1111
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,440
Someone will have to take responsibility.

1112
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,760
There ought to be checks.

1113
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040
It's important.

1114
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,560
Pull over here.

1115
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,640
Yes, sir.

1116
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,080
Really makes no sense
to pursue this any further.

1117
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,600
Rape or no rape, Danish, it doesn't
really change anything for us.

1118
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,160
And defense can't use this.

1119
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Thank you.

1120
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,000
So you focus on winning.

1121
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Hello Ashrut.

1122
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,880
Any update from forensics yet?

1123
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
<i>Yes, sir. I mean, no sir.</i>

1124
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,040
<i>There was no medical test conducted.</i>

1125
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,760
Okay.

1126
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,160
Madam, tea?

1127
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,640
Tanu made a police complaint
and you never told me about it.

1128
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,920
If there was any merit in it,
I would've told you.

1129
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,880
Promila and I decided it was best not
to involve you in all these things.

1130
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,720
I am involved in it.
He's my boyfriend.

1131
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,360
Don't I have a right to know.

1132
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,160
Just because I am your local guardian,

1133
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,240
it does not mean I can divulge
confidential information.

1134
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,640
about other students.

1135
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,240
I am equally responsible
for his reputation.

1136
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,680
Do you want to eat something?

1137
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,480
Nanki.

1138
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,320
Are your symptoms coming back?

1139
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,520
Maybe some.

1140
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,600
Are you writing more?

1141
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,920
Nanki,

1142
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,600
that's how all the poetry started, right?

1143
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,040
But, it's all right.

1144
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,600
Creative people need to exaggerate their
feelings for the sake of creativity.

1145
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,440
In fact,

1146
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,400
a wild imagination is
very, very good for a writer.

1147
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,120
I feel envy sometimes.

1148
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,160
Dr. Roy, do you think he raped her?

1149
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,040
After all these years as a counselor,

1150
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,760
I've discovered that there
are different kinds of women.

1151
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,240
Some just bring
out the worst in men.

1152
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,200
Tanu Kumar, she's got
trouble written all over her.

1153
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,200
So no, I don't think she was raped.

1154
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,760
I am getting concerned
about you, Nanki.

1155
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,600
You're so fragile.

1156
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,480
And this is not good for you.

1157
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,520
And don't let a bright future
be spoiled because of a boy.

1158
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Nanki.

1159
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,960
You're special, Nanki.

1160
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,360
<i>You're special, Nanki.</i>

1161
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,160
Nanki!

1162
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,080
Nanki!

1163
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,760
My parents.

1164
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,480
There's no need.
They don't know about VJ.

1165
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,400
Will Dr. Roy tell them?

1166
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,480
No, baby.

1167
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,320
Dr. Roy and I are
just worried about you.

1168
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,080
You can't jeopardise your
Rhodes scholarship for this.

1169
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,240
You can't fall sick.

1170
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,080
Then tell me about that night.

1171
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,040
I know you went with
her to the police.

1172
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,400
<i>Tanu came to me.</i>

1173
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
<i>It was around 2:30am.</i>

1174
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,640
Vijay Pratap Singh raped me.

1175
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,560
What?

1176
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,080
I need to go to the police.

1177
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,760
- Come in...
- I must go to the police right now!

1178
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,920
Come in for a second.

1179
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,440
Please, I must go to the police.

1180
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,800
I made a call to the office.

1181
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,080
We tried to tell her about
the repercussions of everything.

1182
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,320
For her present, for her future.

1183
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,520
<i>But...</i>

1184
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,240
Why are you wasting time
making me sit here?

1185
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,760
I want to go to the police!

1186
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,640
Why is she here?

1187
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
Tanu.

1188
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,360
We have your statement.

1189
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,680
But we must give VJ a chance, too.

1190
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,640
After all,
we have to be to be fair to everyone.

1191
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,520
You guys are being unfair!

1192
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,160
I've been raped!

1193
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,360
Listen, child.

1194
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,760
Talk to me.

1195
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,880
You can talk to me. Even I am a woman.

1196
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,160
I am going to the police...

1197
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,440
even if no one accompanies me.

1198
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Hey.

1199
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,360
Relax! Sit.

1200
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,040
We can always sit and talk.

1201
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Call her parents.

1202
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,720
- We can't be talking to this kid.
- I am not a kid!

1203
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,960
<i>The dean was sending his official car.</i>

1204
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,880
We had to wait almost an hour.

1205
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,360
<i>I offered to clean her up,</i>

1206
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,440
<i>but she refused.</i>

1207
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,880
<i>She didn't even come inside.</i>

1208
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,600
<i>And sat out there, in that state.</i>

1209
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,520
<i>She didn't even wash her hands.</i>

1210
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,320
<i>She said,</i>

1211
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,080
<i>"It will ruin the evidence."</i>

1212
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,600
Promila Ma'am.

1213
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,480
Was there any blood?

1214
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,280
Any sign of injury?

1215
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,840
Honestly...

1216
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,160
I could barely look at her.

1217
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,800
But one thing was for sure.

1218
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,680
She was going to make VJ pay.

1219
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,080
I'll show you.

1220
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,320
REAL MEN ARE FEMINISTS

1221
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,120
Tanu Kumar, you're a brave girl.

1222
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,320
And girls like you are one in a million.

1223
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,720
And we're all very proud of you, Tanu.

1224
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,600
Friends, Tanu Kumar's decision
to return to Martin's...

1225
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,680
Excuse me.

1226
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,920
No mansplaining, please.
Let's hear it from Tanu.

1227
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,320
Tanu. Tanu. Tanu. Tanu. Tanu.

1228
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:15,560
Tanu. Tanu. Tanu. Tanu. Tanu.

1229
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,880
Tanu. Tanu. Tanu.

1230
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,160
This is where I was humiliated.

1231
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,600
But now I'm here to regain what I lost.

1232
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,920
I haven't come back
just to continue with my studies.

1233
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,720
I'm here for justice.

1234
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,280
I've the right to live with pride,

1235
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,480
as much as some rich, spoiled brat.

1236
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,360
Please attend the rally!

1237
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,600
Please retweet my tweet.

1238
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,040
Tanu! Tanu! Tanu! Tanu

1239
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,000
Asking for retweets.

1240
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Seriously?
Is that what she wants us to do?

1241
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,040
Hardy.

1242
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,080
Who is this guy?

1243
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
I don't know, man.

1244
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,640
You two seem to be friends.

1245
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,536
It's my personal matter
dude im pleading the 5th okay.

1246
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,096
- That's in the American Constitution!
- I have the right to remain silent.

1247
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,320
Hardy, not again.

1248
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,320
Tanu is planning a rally with DUSU.

1249
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
And we?

1250
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,400
we're struggling
to get basic evidence.

1251
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,640
If she was actually raped,
she should be pressing charges.

1252
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,040
She's only interested in getting on stage
and giving speeches.

1253
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,040
We cannot stop the rally.

1254
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,680
But we got a pre-emptive
gag order against her.

1255
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,480
That's it, then. Case closed.

1256
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,016
Come on, stop harassing my friends.
They said everything they had to.

1257
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,160
There's nothing more to say.

1258
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,000
And I told you the truth, right?

1259
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,240
Of course.

1260
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Okay.

1261
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,200
First of all, we welcome Tanu Kumar,
on behalf of Martin's,

1262
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,400
and we commend her
for taking this bold step.

1263
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,600
One. Two. Three. Four.

1264
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,800
Hardy, has your guitar also pleaded
the Fifth Amendment, asshole?

1265
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,280
What are you saying?

1266
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,840
That is
in the American Constitution, asshole.

1267
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,200
Fuck you. Just play the drums, asshole!

1268
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,760
I'm tired of this fucking lawyer shit.

1269
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,320
Why do you care? Play the music.

1270
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,880
Tell him that, bro.
Why are you telling me?

1271
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,560
<i>It's always the victims of sexual assault
who are put on trial.</i>

1272
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,640
In response to the gag order,
Tanu Kumar has tweeted this picture.

1273
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,800
<i>Then throw the book at his father
who is implicated in the coal scam.</i>

1274
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,040
<i>But then there are legal process
as well, madam!</i>

1275
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,720
<i>Don't ask else I may tell the truth</i>

1276
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,280
Go fuck yourselves.

1277
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,880
Come on, guys.

1278
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,520
Fuck this shit, man.
I am tired, and I am sick of the shit.

1279
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,600
And I am going, go fuck yourselves.

1280
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,680
She's a brilliant artist.

1281
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,920
We will try
that she returns to the band soon.

1282
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,280
We'll be reporting LIVE
tomorrow from the Red Fort

1283
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,800
for the Tanu Kumar protest rally.
Stay tuned.

1284
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,680
<i>Delhi court orders a ban
on Tanu Kumar's rally.</i>

1285
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,320
Dipti Kaushal says that the decision
should be taken in favor of Tanu Kumar.

1286
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,760
She has gone crazy.

1287
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,680
<i>What was the point of me getting
the judge to pass that order?</i>

1288
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,936
<i>They are calling it a gag rally...</i>

1289
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,720
He called me at 10 p.m.PM Pratap
Singh must be really desperate.

1290
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,520
DUSU is anyway against
Pratap Singh's party.

1291
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,600
They are saying they will all come
wearing a gag tomorrow to India Gate.

1292
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:19,920
That's a very strong image.

1293
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,240
- Are you KP?
- Yeah.

1294
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,440
- There's an invitation for you.
- Who's sent it?

1295
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Let go of me!

1296
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,200
- Who do you think you are?
- Let go of me!

1297
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,680
Come on, get inside.

1298
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,680
Let me go. I haven't done anything.

1299
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,240
I haven't done anything.

1300
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,360
Let go of me! I haven't done anything.

1301
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,360
Restrain his hands.

1302
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,080
Please just let me go.

1303
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,720
Please, just let me go.
I haven't done anything.

1304
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,360
What the fuck do you guys want?

1305
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,720
What do you guys want?
I haven't done anything, alright!

1306
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:04,720
Asshole.

1307
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,360
Did you really think you could escape us?

1308
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,200
It's your birthday my love.

1309
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,440
Fucker, you thought we wouldn't party.

1310
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,200
Let's have some cake and celebrate fucker.

1311
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,280
- Happy birthday!
- Surprise!

1312
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
Happy birthday to you.

1313
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,240
Happy birthday to you.

1314
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,040
Happy birthday dear KP.

1315
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,600
Who is that guy
in the picture, Hardy?

1316
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,816
- Nanki, it's my personal thing.
- Don't call it personal things.

1317
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,840
Have you lost it?

1318
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,736
- What are you doing?
- Are you hiding something or what?

1319
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,920
Arre he's my dealer, relax,
it's nothing big.

1320
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,720
That lawyer has already scared me.

1321
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,000
Just because VJ got caught,
it doesn't mean we'll all go to jail.

1322
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,216
- What do you mean..
- He didn't mean it like that.

1323
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,376
- I didn't mean that.
- I was asking him about the picture.

1324
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,840
He didn't mean that.

1325
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,960
- Please Nanki.
- He didn't even mean it.

1326
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,520
It's weird how much closer
I've felt to all of you through this.

1327
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,480
But the only thing I am getting in
return is all of you pulling away.

1328
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,760
It's not like that, bro.

1329
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,440
Especially you.

1330
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,280
VJ, that's not true. Listen to me.

1331
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,320
- Now, this news will reach BBC too.
<i>- </i>Sir, 1500 retweets and counting.

1332
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,576
It's already viral.
The news must have already spread.

1333
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,800
She's outsmarted everyone.

1334
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,240
Pro-bono lawyers will line up at her door.

1335
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,160
Free publicity. She's happy with anything.

1336
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,480
Sir, now she will write a book.
"Black Valentine."

1337
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Exactly.

1338
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,440
So why hasn't she filed a case yet?

1339
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,920
Even the news channels
are leaving no stone unturned.

1340
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,760
- At it.
- Danish.

1341
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,840
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

1342
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,560
- Excuse me, guys.
- Yeah, sure.

1343
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,720
My son sent me these.

1344
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,920
What the bloody hell
is going on in this law firm?

1345
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,120
Tanu Kumar has made news headlines
and gained public support.

1346
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,920
And our client is partying
like some B-grade Bollywood villain,

1347
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,400
and posting the pictures on social media...

1348
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,640
Exactly my point.

1349
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,720
Look at this man. Look at his face.

1350
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
He looks like a bloody rapist.

1351
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,960
I am not going to lose
this case to social media.

1352
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,160
I haven't said this before,
so listen to me carefully.

1353
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,240
This is just the kind
of shit that weakens our case.

1354
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,400
Sir, it's still not adding up.
Why isn't she filing for a rape case?

1355
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,280
What is she waiting for?

1356
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,880
She is waiting for
an out of court settlement.

1357
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,200
Danish, I want you to get into
a room with Tanu and her lawyer, now!

1358
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,360
KEEP MARCHING ALONE

1359
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,280
Hello, uncle.

1360
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,040
They are from Dev Mirchandani's office.
Danish and Laksh.

1361
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,920
Come in.

1362
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,320
Hi, sir.

1363
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,240
Come.

1364
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,600
- How are you, Dubey ji?
- Shall we start?

1365
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,080
Where are the other 97 lawyers?

1366
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,360
You'll need 99 lawyers to win this case.

1367
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,600
It's not like that, Tanu.

1368
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,961
But that's a good line.
Are you thinking of using it next?

1369
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You make her understand.

1370
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,800
Tanu, think about it with a cool mind.

1371
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,560
You are our priority.
The cause is secondary.

1372
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,080
People will soon forget about Me Too.

1373
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,120
But your future's at stake here.

1374
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,160
And once you get branded,

1375
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,440
you'll be known
as a trouble-maker forever.

1376
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,200
You're fighting the case in the court,
but what if you lose?

1377
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,840
Think about the difficulties
you will face.

1378
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,400
You won't get a job.

1379
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,160
How will you be successful in life?

1380
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,120
How will you earn money?

1381
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,840
Have you imagined
who will take care of your parents?

1382
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,840
No, Tanu.

1383
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:58,240
You belong to our homeland.
We can't see your life getting ruined.

1384
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,480
Don't want this.

1385
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
He's right, dear. Listen to him.

1386
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,240
You must cancel the rally
and delete the tweet.

1387
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,160
We'll withdraw the defamation case
within 24 hours.

1388
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,240
It's not a bad deal, Tanu.

1389
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,000
Settlement? Again?

1390
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,040
- No.
- Again?

1391
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,560
This time, I want justice.

1392
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,640
Wait a second.

1393
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,000
What do you mean by "this time"?

1394
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,240
If she took the money last time,
then that's all we need to prove.

1395
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,480
I was scared.

1396
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,120
I didn't want the money.

1397
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,400
But it was forcibly given to me
to retract the police complaint.

1398
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,120
Then the case is over.

1399
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,920
No settlement required anymore.
Clearly, she is guilty.

1400
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,800
I am not guilty, you are.
Because you're asking for this settlement.

1401
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,000
You are offering the money.

1402
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,800
You are trying to hide the truth, not me.

1403
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,360
Don't make this a
morality issue, Tanu.

1404
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,560
If you took money to withdraw the case,
then it looks like blackmail.

1405
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,440
That will leave your
testimony untrustworthy.

1406
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,040
Unless...

1407
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,280
you have some kind of evidence.

1408
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,080
DNA? Blood?

1409
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,520
Something.

1410
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,640
Look at what she's doing.

1411
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,360
Let's inform the warden.

1412
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,880
Yes, sir.

1413
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,640
You know, that girl. That VJ's girlfriend.

1414
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:39,600
Well, she has been disbarred
as a witness.. by her own college ICC.

1415
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,120
In all fairness,

1416
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,280
her fragility makes her
an unreliable witness.

1417
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,320
But is she all right, sir?

1418
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,760
Shouldn't she just be home?

1419
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,480
She is perfectly
safe with us over here.

1420
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,600
I am her local guardian.

1421
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,640
Yes, sir.

1422
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
And...

1423
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,040
don't mention 'home'.

1424
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,160
It's her trigger word.

1425
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,640
Trigger?

1426
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,360
Look..

1427
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,720
I've been Nanki's counselor

1428
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
since she was 13 years old.

1429
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,880
She doesn't like to talk about it.

1430
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,880
She is a troubled girl.

1431
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,600
I am doing this for her
sanity and for her future.

1432
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,760
I've promised to send her to Oxford.

1433
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,000
I've promised her.

1434
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,360
So, it's best we don't
involve her in all this.

1435
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,680
- Thank you so much for your time, sir.
- Thank you.

1436
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,920
See you.

1437
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,960
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I was trying to call you because I...

1438
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,120
I know what happened. About the blood.

1439
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,600
There was no blood, Nanki.

1440
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,400
Tanu said there was no blood.

1441
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,760
I'm sorry. Your testimony for VJ
wont be accepted in court.

1442
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,320
Your college's ICC
deems you too fragile.

1443
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,080
If you need to talk, I'm here.

1444
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,960
No.

1445
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,000
The Pratap Singhs have filed
another case against Tanu Kumar

1446
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:13,320
and this time it's
extortion as per IPC 383.

1447
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,520
<i>Now this false accusation
will be investigated</i>

1448
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,280
<i>to find out the ulterior
motive behind the crime.</i>

1449
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,280
<i>The entire country is
following this case closely.</i>

1450
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,200
In the wake of these extortion
charges of Tanu Kumar

1451
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,320
the DUSU rally has
been abruptly called off.

1452
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,160
This rally was planned
in support of Tanu Kumar's

1453
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,960
allegation of rape
on Vijay Pratap Singh.

1454
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,560
I know my dad is a politician
which is why people judge him.

1455
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,240
But everything my parents have done,
they've only done because they loved me.

1456
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:47,080
His only fault was that
he offered money to Tanu Kumar

1457
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,520
to withdraw the complaint.

1458
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,480
I guess they got scared.

1459
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,360
If they hadn't,

1460
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:56,200
this case would've been investigated
right then and closed right away.

1461
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,440
I just think that Me Too
gave it a different colour.

1462
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,240
I am sorry that to prove my
innocence, I had to weaken the movement.

1463
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,400
It's not my win. It's our loss.

1464
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,280
The court is adjourned.

1465
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,160
In a landmark judgment,
the court has directed

1466
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,320
Tanu Kumar, accused of defamation

1467
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,160
to pay the plaintiff
five lakhs in damages.

1468
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,120
<i>In a landmark judgment, in the Me Too case,</i>

1469
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,560
<i>the court announced its judgment
in Vijay Pratap Singh's favor.</i>

1470
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,480
That whiskey is mine.

1471
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,680
Why are these waiters
dressed better than me?

1472
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,960
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1473
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,480
Mom asked me to wear a blazer.

1474
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,920
Please.

1475
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,520
Fuck it guys.

1476
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,840
I am like really happy. Why the fuck
aren't you drinking, bro?

1477
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:51,400
We're performing at Transcend.
That's the best news of the day.

1478
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,320
Asshole!

1479
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,000
That's the best news of the day?

1480
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,480
Fuck, sorry-sorry.

1481
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,880
I am happy for you.
I am really happy for you.

1482
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,040
Anything for you, sir.

1483
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,120
Just water.

1484
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,720
A glass of water for sir.

1485
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,280
- Thanks.
- Thanks you

1486
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,440
Congratulation.

1487
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,440
Thank you.

1488
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,600
Recognize me?

1489
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,040
Oh, yes.

1490
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,000
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1491
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,000
Totally slipped my mind
you are absolutely right.

1492
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,360
- Hello.
- Hi!

1493
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:20,080
- Cheers anyway.
- Cheers.

1494
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,080
Oh, hi. Baig!

1495
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,360
Really?

1496
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,800
Sir, what are you doing here?

1497
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,800
Pratap Singh has hired our law firm

1498
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,160
to defend the coal block case.

1499
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,760
Right.

1500
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,120
No wonder you didn't
counter the extortion charge

1501
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,520
with the fact that the
offer itself is proof of guilt.

1502
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,640
But Dubey ji.. Coal Scam.. wow.

1503
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:47,360
Come on, Baig.
You've won the case. Cheers.

1504
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1505
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,440
Just leave this water bottle.

1506
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,000
And hold this.

1507
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,880
No, I'm good.

1508
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,960
You have to be very good,
just like you are in your job

1509
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,880
Hold it, it's for us.

1510
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,720
That's good.

1511
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,320
Dubey ji, learn something from him.

1512
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,680
He shows true promise
and will succeed in the future.

1513
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,240
He is on our team.

1514
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,960
You broke my heart.

1515
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,960
I'm slipping into KP mode.

1516
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,400
Guys, I've to go to the loo.

1517
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,360
- Get some ice, Nanki.
- I will.

1518
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,560
Danish.

1519
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,480
Come, have a drink with us.

1520
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,480
I guess you're getting bored
with these oldies.

1521
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,280
That's very kind but no, thanks.

1522
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,960
I feel disgusted.

1523
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,840
But you...

1524
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,360
You party on, dude.

1525
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,320
Why shouldn't I?

1526
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,680
VJ has been declared innocent.

1527
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,080
No, he has not.

1528
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,880
We just won the defamation case.

1529
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,640
- No one is talking about the rape.
- Because the rape never happened.

1530
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,520
If it had, she'd be fighting it.

1531
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,840
What are you saying, Nanki?

1532
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,000
That's what they (want you to...)

1533
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,080
Are you blind?

1534
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,600
Can't you see what's happening here?

1535
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,480
And I am the catalyst in... fuck!

1536
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,640
Danish, my man.

1537
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,000
Danish is here, bro.

1538
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,320
Danish, thanks, man.

1539
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,720
Sorry about the cut.

1540
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,040
If you youngsters just hang around here,
who will start the party?

1541
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,360
I'll do it.

1542
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,800
Come on. Come on.
All of you've to come.

1543
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,320
Danish. Come on.

1544
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,720
Oh, that's great.

1545
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
- Sir.
- Danish. Danish.

1546
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,440
- Come, my boy, have a drink.
- Sir, I'm leaving sir.

1547
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,880
Hey, waiter. Get a drink for Danish.

1548
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,120
- Sir, I am leaving.
- Leaving? Why?

1549
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,160
But the party has just begun.

1550
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,960
- Come on. Come on.
- I resign.

1551
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,360
What? Why?

1552
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,160
What is this, Danish?
Danish.

1553
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,800
Oh, come on.

1554
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,040
Oh fuck.

1555
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,680
KP man.

1556
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,480
Nanki, I am so sorry.

1557
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,880
Why are you always drunk.

1558
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,920
I am not drunk. This is not alcohol.

1559
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,520
Wednesday is my music fast day, idiot.

1560
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:32,200
- VJ, my man!
- Sushma aunty is going to kill me.

1561
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Where is Tanu?

1562
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,080
She left.

1563
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,520
She called me
and said she's never coming back.

1564
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,840
You can take whatever you want.

1565
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,200
I called her an e-rick.
But she left her luggage behind.

1566
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,720
She gave me 300 rupees.

1567
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,760
Tanu. Tanu.

1568
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,600
Tanu.

1569
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,760
Nanki, don't do it.

1570
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,160
Tanu. Tanu.

1571
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,480
What are you doing?

1572
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,400
- Stay back! Let go of me!
- Don't...

1573
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,920
You have your full
life ahead of you, Tanu.

1574
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,120
- What?
- Don't do it. Are you mad?

1575
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,840
What? I am not committing suicide.

1576
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,280
I don't need your fake sympathy.

1577
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,720
Tanu. Tanu, please come with me.

1578
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,400
I think I can help you.

1579
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,000
Why try to save me now?

1580
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,240
I did come to you that night.

1581
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,040
Really sorry.

1582
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,880
What good is your apology?

1583
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,160
I am going to Mumbai.

1584
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,640
To become a star.
Make more money than you can imagine

1585
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,160
and then I'll shut down
your stupid Doobydo band.

1586
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,400
Your lowlife boyfriend,
and his sick friends.

1587
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,520
And that bloody wimp #EvilLaughter
who was watching everything.

1588
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,080
Why have you come?

1589
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,000
Get off me!

1590
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,200
What happened?

1591
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,280
You're coming tonight, right?

1592
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,200
Just please come.

1593
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,000
Just be yourself, okay?

1594
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,760
Hello Transcend!
How are you guys feeling?

1595
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,120
Doobydo crew is here.

1596
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,240
To groove you away.

1597
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,360
- Arnab, I'll kill you.
- Yes it's almost done.

1598
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:43,920
Just start it.

1599
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,280
Increase the volume on the drum.

1600
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:49,360
It's fine now.

1601
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:52,480
Where are you?

1602
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,960
Nanki.

1603
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,296
- He is with me, let him come.
- Sorry guys, we're starting soon.

1604
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,400
Come fast.

1605
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,760
So what's the plan?

1606
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,040
Everyone's staring at me.

1607
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Oh, god.

1608
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,160
KP.

1609
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,720
Sorry, guys. Technical difficulties.

1610
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,800
What's up?

1611
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,000
KP, that Valentine's
night was a Wednesday.

1612
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,520
You didn't puke because you were drunk
because that's your music fast day.

1613
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,600
You puked because of what you saw.

1614
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,520
KP, that was your ringtone.

1615
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,600
It was you.

1616
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,040
He is #EvilLaughter.

1617
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,456
That was your ringtone last year,
the evil laughter, the evil joker laugh

1618
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,336
- Why are you doing this right now?
- You saw it, KP.

1619
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,600
Why are you doing this?

1620
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,800
- It's not, KP...
- VJ's our friend.

1621
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,120
Who cares, KP?
You have a chance to...

1622
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,240
Are you serious?

1623
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,440
- KP.
- I'm sorry, man.

1624
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:59,440
Doobydo starting soon.
Hardy my boy, on the key and guitar.

1625
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,240
- Tashi on the drums.
- Tanu.

1626
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:02,200
KP on the bass.

1627
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
And here we have Tanu Kumar,
I don't know for what.

1628
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,360
She's still wearing
such revealing clothes,

1629
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,280
even after all of this.

1630
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,240
What is she doing here?

1631
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:21,520
Attention whore!

1632
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,360
Yeah, I want attention.

1633
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,120
Whore!

1634
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,760
Yes, I had a crush on VJ.

1635
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,200
I wanted him to break up with Nanki
and become my boyfriend.

1636
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,280
He was the college heartthrob.

1637
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,360
And I wasn't the only one
with the same desire.

1638
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,040
<i>Yes, I wanted to go with him to his room.</i>

1639
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,520
<i>But not with his friends.</i>

1640
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,360
<i>I wanted him to touch me.</i>

1641
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:14,480
<i>But not while his friends were watching.</i>

1642
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,520
You two, please leave.

1643
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,120
<i>I yelled and screamed.</i>

1644
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,880
<i>I even slapped him.</i>

1645
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,800
<i>But that hurt his ego.</i>

1646
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,320
<i>I had never seen that side of VJ.</i>

1647
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,040
<i>He threw me on the bed.</i>

1648
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,480
VJ stop!

1649
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,080
Dhanbad is performing.

1650
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,640
It's a masala movie, man.

1651
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,840
VJ, no! VJ stop it!

1652
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,160
Backstage... understand VJ!

1653
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:47,600
VJ, please! VJ, please!

1654
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,680
I want her performance.

1655
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,280
- Stick it in her ass.
- VJ please stop it.

1656
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,800
No.

1657
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,000
Stop!

1658
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:00,080
No, please.

1659
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,920
VJ, no!

1660
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,320
VJ, no!

1661
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,080
Hurry up. She's saying, "please."

1662
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,840
- Otherwise she will slap you.
- Don't do this.

1663
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,440
VJ, no!

1664
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,160
Stick it in her ass.

1665
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,040
Fucking do it.

1666
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,960
<i>I was unconscious...</i>

1667
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,080
<i>when I heard a voice.</i>

1668
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,240
<i>And that coward,</i>

1669
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,920
<i>who was quietly watching everything.</i>

1670
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,120
Hashtag

1671
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:46,840
Evil Laughter.

1672
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,480
- KP.
- Nanki, listen to me, please.

1673
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:54,920
Nanki, don't...

1674
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,680
I can't do this. I'm really sorry.

1675
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,120
They're all the same.

1676
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,640
These college people,
police and my parents

1677
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:02,920
He's my friend

1678
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,120
They didn't let me release the video
because they said

1679
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,240
It was my shame?!!!

1680
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,680
Nanki, what's going on?

1681
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,040
Tanu, enough. Just stop it.

1682
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,840
Go from here. Just go.

1683
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:13,920
What has she done?

1684
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,560
Loser!

1685
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,960
Who do you think you are, Tanu Kumar?

1686
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,360
What's happening here?

1687
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,080
What did you think?

1688
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,480
You put one tweet out there
and got 1,000 likes,

1689
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,560
you think you can say anything

1690
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,200
and we'll accept it?

1691
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,440
You're guilty,

1692
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,960
because...

1693
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,000
you liked him.

1694
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,360
You were flirting with him.

1695
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,440
And you wanted to have sex with him.

1696
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,360
So it's obvious that you're guilty.

1697
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:01,200
You say whatever you like
to whomever you like. You're so confident.

1698
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,000
Always want to be
the centre of attention.

1699
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,120
Your problem is you want too many things
and you go after all of it.

1700
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:12,320
Funny, actually.

1701
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:15,120
Because...

1702
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,000
even VJ has the same qualities.

1703
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,520
But that's what I like about him.

1704
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,360
- Nanki, what...
- So do you.

1705
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,960
But with him, it's different, Tanu.

1706
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,360
You see, because he's a man.

1707
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,440
You understand, your problem is

1708
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,960
you don't know
how to conduct yourself.

1709
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,480
You have to be more responsible
to stay out of trouble.

1710
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,480
Right, Dr. Roy?

1711
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,520
Isn't that what you taught me?

1712
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,760
When I was 13

1713
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,160
you told me that I have
to be more aware, and careful

1714
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,520
because men can't change themselves.

1715
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,240
They can't control themselves, so

1716
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:12,120
we have to behave accordingly.

1717
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,320
- Really..?
- Nanki..

1718
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:20,640
KP, please,
you have to tell everyone the truth.

1719
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,640
Please, KP.

1720
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:25,800
No one will believe me.
But everyone will believe you. Please.

1721
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,880
KP, just do the right thing.

1722
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,560
KP you won't be able
to live with yourself.

1723
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,800
I saw it.

1724
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,560
He did it.

1725
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,320
I saw the entire thing.

1726
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,720
I'm really sorry.

1727
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,200
Where is he going?

1728
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,000
Not from here.

1729
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,440
Not this way, sir.

1730
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,000
Lock the gate.. Lock it!

1731
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:13,760
Definitely not this way.

1732
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,240
Then which way should I go?

1733
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:31,800
Fucking rapist.

1734
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,000
Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

1735
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,600
Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

1736
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,880
Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

1737
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:45,360
Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame.

1738
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,280
Make way.

1739
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,200
Clear the way.

1740
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Make way, please.

1741
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:04,680
Stop it. Stop it.

1742
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,760
Shame. Shame.

1743
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,680
Stop it I said. Enough!

1744
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,240
Shame on you.

1745
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,080
How could you do it?

1746
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:16,400
Shame on you! Disgusting.

1747
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,280
I'm guilty too.

1748
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:30,040
Being a part of this village that helped
raise a boy to think it was okay to rape.

1749
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,200
Violate someone like that.

1750
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,280
But I am not guilty
of what happened to me.

1751
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,320
Of what he did to me

1752
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,640
Dr. Roy, I told you about it.

1753
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,600
I was 13 years old.

1754
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,800
He was a man.

1755
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,120
He was my...

1756
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,320
You told me keep quiet

1757
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,240
"Otherwise, there will be chaos."

1758
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,560
You said

1759
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:26,160
that I had a sexual vibe.

1760
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,680
So it wasn't his fault

1761
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,080
that he climbed on top of me.

1762
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,920
You betrayed my trust.

1763
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,840
And told them I was crazy.

1764
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,520
I need help.

1765
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,440
I was making things up.

1766
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,560
Why?

1767
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,120
All your theories of

1768
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,200
my creativity

1769
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:15,800
and imagination and exaggeration.

1770
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,600
It can't wipe out that memory.

1771
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:32,160
Is it because you
want that power over me.

1772
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,560
And I kept quiet.

1773
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:43,320
Just because I wanted
a normal life like anybody else?

1774
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,280
Which is not about this

1775
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,360
But it doesn't leave
me even for a second.

1776
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:54,680
It's always right there,
no matter how hard I try.

1777
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:58,760
It's always right there.

1778
01:52:03,240 --> 01:52:04,640
Maybe because...

1779
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,280
Because I kept it a secret.

1780
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,120
Our secret!

1781
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,080
And it kills me inside.

1782
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:27,840
I am ready to speak up now, but...

1783
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,760
is anyone ready to listen?

1784
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:23,600
<i>My lips have started speaking up</i>

1785
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,200
<i>They were sewn shut</i>

1786
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:31,440
<i>but have begun to unravel</i>

1787
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:40,640
<i>My lips have started moving up</i>

1788
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:48,360
<i>They have begun soaring over limits</i>

1789
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:53,560
<i>Now I tell the truth</i>

1790
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:59,240
<i>To my whispers and to my silences</i>

1791
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:04,960
<i>I tell them</i>

1792
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:13,000
<i>I tell them</i>

1793
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:19,320
I hope you will not leave all this

1794
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,520
You will appeal the high court.

1795
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,440
For obvious reasons,

1796
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:30,080
I cannot appear on your behalf.

1797
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,760
This is advocate Mathur.

1798
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,640
He is more than willing
to file on your behalf.

1799
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
But, Tanu,

1800
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:43,800
the courts...

1801
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,720
They are not this.

1802
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,040
I'll do it.

1803
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,040
Now we are there for ourselves.

1804
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:32,560
<i>I tell them</i>

1805
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:39,960
<i>I tell them</i>

1806
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:47,480
<i>To the broken stars, I say</i>

1807
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,320
<i>To every particle of the universe</i>

1808
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,040
<i>Listen, now that my lips are free</i>

1809
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:59,880
<i>To the watch guards of conscience</i>

1810
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,400
<i>To the customs and traditions, I say</i>

1811
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:08,480
<i>To the deserts awaiting each drop of rain</i>

1812
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,560
<i>Listen, now that my lips are free</i>

1813
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,040
<i>To the watch guards of identity
I say</i>

1814
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:21,480
<i>I tell them</i>

1815
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:30,480
<i>I tell them</i>

1816
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,520
<i>To Faiz, to Firaq, I say</i>

1817
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:41,720
<i>To the words burning in my heart</i>

1818
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:45,280
<i>Listen, now that my lips are free</i>

1819
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,320
<i>To those who suppress voices</i>

1820
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,040
<i>I tell them</i>

1821
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,320
<i>I tell them</i>

1822
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,360
<i>I tell them</i>

1823
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:12,680
<i>It doesn't look like my writing</i>

1824
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:21,640
<i>In whose story am I the muse?</i>

1825
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,720
<i>Whose dream is this?</i>

1826
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,160
<i>Whose thought is it?</i>

1827
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,920
<i>In whose failure am I the catalyst?</i>

1828
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:42,360
<i>It's me</i>

1829
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,680
<i>Don't provoke me</i>

1830
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,200
<i>Or I'll speak the truth</i>

1831
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,840
<i>Don't provoke me</i>

1832
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:59,520
<i>Or I'll speak the truth</i>

1833
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:17,280

1835
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
<i>I am</i>

1836
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:33,840
<i>Whose dream is this?</i>

1837
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,160
<i>Whose thoughts are these?</i>

1838
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:44,160
<i>In whose failure am I the catalyst?</i>

1839
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,440
<i>I am</i>

1840
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:49,560
<i>Don't provoke me</i>

1841
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:54,280
