00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,333
She hasn't complained.

191
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:04,800
She's my daughter, the
first doctor in our family.

192
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,767
Mm-hmm.

193

Hm?

194
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,567
Anyway, Simi will
be here in a minute.

195
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,600
She'll have a nice day out.

196

It'll be relaxing.

Hey!

I've got to see Oliver.

I need to tell him, but you
can take me, can't you Simi?

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,167
They'll think I'm with you.

213
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,167
What do you want to
go and see him for?

214
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,800
He's not exactly
Mr. Reliable, is he?

215
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,567
Look, are you going to
take me or do I have to walk?

216
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:16,000
Look, I've just gotta make one
last stop, Ginder, all right?

217

Ginder, Hashida.

You'll have fun in the

Just don't know.

236
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,767
Hashida, have you to-- you
haven't told your parents,

238

Good.

240
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,100
Now that's good, babe.

241
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,467
Because that's not
what we need right now.

242
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:14,000
Because I don't think
I could ha-- I mean,

243
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,500
I don't think we could
handle it right now.

We?

245
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,667
Hey, I'm the one who's been
doing the lying through this.

246
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,833
I've told so many that
I've forgotten how to tell

247
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,667
the truth even if I wanted to.

248
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,600
And what about me, hey?

Oh, right.

258
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,033
If it's all been arranged,
you can't let mommy

260
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,533
I mean, don't worry
about me, Hashida.

How are things?

00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:59,633
You should ring your husband
sometimes and find out.

Oh, just ignore it, right?

One more thing-- it is not
often that we women get away

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,133
from the patriarchal demands
made on us in our daily lives,

00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:28,167
All right, what's this?

372
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,500
Whoever fits this
shall be my bride.

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,467
Balbir, please!

374
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:38,367
What?

375
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,300
Hang on.

376
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:43,900
The kids, man.

377
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,700
What are you doing?

378
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,233
You shut it!

379
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,367
There's nothing about their
kids when they went off, eh?

380
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:50,167
Eh?

381
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,900
It's not nice, broken homes.

382
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,767
Is it ladies?

383
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,333
Is it?

384
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,900
You lot got spoiled living here.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,200
Every kid needs their daddy.

386
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,167
Isn't that right, princess, eh?

387
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:07,033
Are you going to tell me where
your Auntie Ginder's gone?

388
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,333
You're frightening her.

389
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,267
Blackpool!

390
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,267
She's gone with
the Saheli group.

391
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,300
She wanted to see the light.

392
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,533
Let's go.

393
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:14,500
Now!

394
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,267
What?

395
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:16,633
All the way to Blackpool?

396
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,567
Can't it wait?

397
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,800
No, it can't.

398
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,100
Come on you weed.

399
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Can't go home empty
handed now, can we?

400
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,167
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:25,267
I'm sorry, all right?

402
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,233
Oh look, look, look.

403
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:38,333
Sometimes I get
headaches and I see things.

404
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:39,700
[horn blowing]

405
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,267
Oy ladies--

406
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,433
[giggling]

407
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,300
30 years I have lived
in this country, never

408
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,033
have I seen anything like this.

409
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,600
Private parts
should be private.

410
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,600
Tossers!

411
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,600
Go away you silly dirty boys!

412
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,567
[wails]

413
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,667
Well, at least it's
given them something

414
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,233
else to talk about for a bit.

415
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,400
So are you going to college?

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,167
Yeah.

417
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:09,333
Going to be a doctor?

418
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:11,467
So they say.

419
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,367
I gave up college
to get married.

420
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:16,533
You're obviously
not that stupid.

421
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:19,100
Still I got him.

422
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,733
Oy, man.

423
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,867
I just don't understand you.

424
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,833
You know where her
parents are coming from.

425
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,367
Looks like she done
you a favor, mate.

426
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,033
Let her handle it on
her own like she said.

427
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,867
Listen, Joe, man, listen.

428
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,267
You just don't understand.

429
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:39,900
I understand it was pure
grief for a whole year.

430
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,300
Yeah?

431
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,867
I told you from the
beginning she was bad news.

432
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,833
Scramble you up!

433
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,800
Always [inaudible].

434
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,333
What next?

435
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,567
Actually, what you said was,
thank God she's not white.

436
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,267
So what happened to the last
piece of black solidarity, heh?

437
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,867
Black don't mean
not white anymore.

438
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,300
Oh, so what does it mean now?

439
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,267
Forget the melting pot
and respect the differences.

440
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,600
But that's was missing
between us and them, respect.

441
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Chan over there.

442
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
Him write him name on
all them eggs like I

443
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,867
thieved them or something.

444
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,000
We all started from Africa.

445
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
You remember that,
all right, Chan?

446
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,633
You'll remember next time.

447
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,000
Buy you own fucking eggs.

448
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,267
See What I mean?

449
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,933
You try the fusion
and you get confusion,

450
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,600
and no bloody breakfast.

451
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,733
Yeah.

452
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,900
You're right.

453
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,833
Pressure?

454
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:23,833
Who needs it, eh?

455
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:24,733
I'm telling you.

456

[giggling]

459
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,100
How am I going
to cope with this?

460
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,100
Look, you're only
a few weeks gone.

461
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,300
You'll sort things out.

462
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,700
[flush]

463
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,700
Don't be too long, girls.

464
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,300
She never--

465
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,667
Do your mom and dad know?

466
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:53,667
Don't be stupid.

467
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,733
Are you going to marry him?

468
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,667
Oh you're so thick, Ladhu.

469
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,600
She can't marry him.

470
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,100
Why not?

471
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,333
Because, you know, he's--
well, what about university?

472
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,333
What about it?

473
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:03,500
What's she going
to do with a kid,

474
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,833
walk down the
street with a pram?

475
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:05,600
Or get firebombed
by the aunties?

476
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,033
[sniffling]

477
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:10,733
Do you need anything?

478
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,100
Yeah.

479
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,233
Can I borrow 10 P?

480
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,567
Yeah.

481
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,900
Have you got it?

482
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,200
She'll need more than 10 P.

483
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,900
Madhu, get your things.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,867
Come on.

485
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:26,867
Get off, Ladhu.

486
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm coming.

487
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,300
Hi.

488
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,333
It's me.

489
00:27:41,433 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't know.

490
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,733
At some service
station or another.

491
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:52,400
Listen, I'm really sorry.

492
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,000
I know.

493
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,033
I didn't mean to
slam it like that.

494
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:00,733
What did you say?

495
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:05,500
Look, I said I think it was
for the best what happened.

496
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,500
I mean, you always said you
were going away in September.

497
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,200
I mean, you always told me
you're going away in September.

498
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:22,633
Yeah, bu-- well, yeah, of course
I'm want to help out, babe.

499
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:23,633
What?

00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,200
What?

501
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,567
Look, babe, if you-- I mean,
do you need any money, or--

502
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,600
No, no.

503
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,333
Man, tell that girl to go West.

504
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,100
Joe, man, I can't say that.

505
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,700
Look, just tell me--

506
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:50,367
Great, now look
what you made me do.

507
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:54,767

know where she is.

go somewhere tonight.

Piss off, you sexist prick.

513
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,600
Are you a lesbian then?

514
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,967
Are you the alternative?

We serve them in
our shops every day.

518
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:31,500
How do you live with this?

519
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,967
Don't.

Oh shit.

Happy birthday
to me, I'm only 53.

530
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,733
My son has forgotten
because he's just like me.

I'm sorry, Dad.

Ah.

00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,833
Oh, look, Mommy
sent one from Jamaica.

534
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,533
You could have taken
a holiday as well.

535
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,667
What holiday?

536
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,400
I get off the plane and
the whole of the family

537
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,333
is in a suitcase.

538
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:31,600
No missing.

What?

547
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,100
Did the parents
find out about ya?

548
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,400
Worse, she's pregnant, Dad.

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,433
[sigh] And your
mother not even here.

551
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:16,800
So you can marry her.

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,033
No, it's not going to happen.
OK, Dad?

556
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,200
It's over.

557
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,733
So what you're
just going to leave

558
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,000
her barefoot and pregnant?
Is that how I brought you up?

559
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Jesus, Dad!

560
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,333
I can't flippin' win, can I?

561
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:31,800
Or is this something
else you're going

562
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,700
to leave half-finished?

563
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:38,167
[sigh]

564
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:40,633
Uh, look, is she all right?

565
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,567
No.

566
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,500
No, I don't think so.

Yes?

573
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,167
- Mr. Chopra?
- Yeah.

574
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:08,733
You don't know me,
but, uh, can you tell

575
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,133
me where Hashida is please?

576
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm a-- I'm a
friend from college.

577
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,700
Oh.

578
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,933
Ha.

579
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:21,067
She's gone to the
seaside, to Blackpool.

580
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,200
What is it?

581
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,633
Any message?

582
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:32,500
Uh, no.

583
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,400
That's OK.

[music playing]

585
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:57,733
You know, I've forgotten
what my son's, um,

00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,033
voice sounds like.

587
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,200
It just sneaked off, Manjit.

588
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,533
There wasn't any,
any discussion.

589
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:06,933
No warning.

590
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:07,833
She don't want to know.

591
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,567
You can't change that.

592
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:10,533
She still loves me, Manjit.

593
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Even if we find her, you
can't make her come back.

594
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,967
She's got the
courts involved now,

595
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,433
and there'll be a
record of everything.

596
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:23,133
What records?

597
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,867
Is there a record
of how she behaved?

598
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28,067
No, no, now come on Manjit.

599
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,400
Listen, you were there
and you saw it all.

600
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,267
The shouting, the screaming,
the-- I'm not the only one--

601
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, I know what I
was told, all right?

602
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,300
This is so stupid, man.

603
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,067
What are you going to
do when you find her?

604
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,033
You know there are other ways?

605
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,667
You know what?

606
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,900
Every time you open your
mouth your wife jumps out.

607
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,133
Get in that bloody car.

00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,467
You used to sing so
nicely at weddings.

611
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:21,700
Not anymore.

All right, just
wait over there.

620
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,167
Where do you live in Bombay?

621
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,767
Oh, [inaudible].

[chatter]

625
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,167
Now remember, we're going
to have beach games, high tea,

626
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:26,767
after which I want
us all to meet

627

And I want you all to be
there at 6:30 PM sharp, right?

632

Any questions?

633
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,733
Excuse me.

634
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:41,800
Where are the toilets?

635
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,733
Ha-ha.

Oh look.

00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,333
I'm OK.

660
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:10,433
Look, go ahead, have
something to eat.

661
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:11,833
Yeah right.

I mean, bringing
him up on your own.

666
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,367
Look, I've managed so far.

667
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:28,400
I'll be OK.

668
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,733
Supposin' I put up and shut up?

669
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,300
I'd been more popular.

670
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,500
Yeah.

671
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,033
It's just so hard to know
what's right anymore.

672
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,400
Look, you'll never
please everyone,

673
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,967
so you might as well
please yourself.

674
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:49,000
Hashida?

675
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,900
If you can.

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,233
Do you want to play?

677
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,633
No, Hashida, you rest.

00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:54,567
You know?

679
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:55,467
Rest?

680
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,967
It's so lovely.

681
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,433
This is nice to come
out like this, isn't it?

682
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,633
These people know how
to enjoy themselves.

683
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,100
Yeah, well as soon as we
try and enjoy ourselves,

684
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,100
people start to talk.

685

00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,133
Look at poor Ginder.

688
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:16,700
I hear her husband
used to beat her.

689
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
These modern
girls can't adapt.

690
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,633
And those with jobs are worst.

691
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,867
Eh, Asha, wake up!

692
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,467
You know her in-laws.

693
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,867
Is it true?

694
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,667
No, she must have
done something.

695
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:33,800
My own daughter-- the other
day I was telling her that it's

696
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,567
the woman who makes the family.

697
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,633
You know what she did?

698
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:38,533
The next day she
shaved her head.

[laughter]

700
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:41,467
You think it's funny?

701
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:43,567
I was teaching morals
from back home.

702
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,567
Home?

703
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:45,800
What home?

704
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,433
How long is it since
you've been home?

705
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:49,800
Look at you?

706
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,933
Your clothes, the
way that you think.

707
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:54,067
Let go, Auntie-ji.

708
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,100
You try and teach
them something,

709
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,500
but you've got to
learn to listen.

710
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,567
Your daughters are
doing there best.

711
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:01,567
Oh, come on.

712
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:04,067
You're 20 years out of date.

713
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:06,133
You want progress,
like Hashida?

714
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:08,067
She comes from a
decent good family

715
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,300

What?

719
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:20,200
30 years I have lived
in this country, never

720
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
have I known anything like this.

721
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,267
Auntie-ji?

722
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:25,167
You wait till 9
months are over,

723
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:28,700
and then see how many
aunties you've got left.

724
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
- You!
- No, not me.

725
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,700
Look, so what
if she's pregnant?

726
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,767
So what if the father's black?

727
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:35,000
[gasps]
- Black!

728
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,567
This is the 20th
century, you know?

729
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,300
[non-english speech]

730
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:41,900
That will kill your
family, you know?

731
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,133
It is not color,
it is culture.

733
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,800
And why a black boy?

734
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,100
What's wrong with our men?

735
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,033
What about the child?

Will you listen to me?

739
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:53,267
Calm down.

740
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:54,333
Calm down.

741
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,000
She's going to have
an abortion anyway,

742
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,467
so what's the big deal?

743
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,200
OK.

744
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,500
Oh for fuck's sake.

745
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,933
Let's just calm down,
sisters, all right?

746
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,667
You're not my fucking sisters.

747
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:05,767
Now look what you've done!

748
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:06,667
Hashida!

749
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:07,600
Hashida, come back!

750
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,067
Now look what you've done.

751
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): 30 years
I have lived in this country,

752
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,367
never have I known
anything like this.

753
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,133
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Yeah,
so what if she's pregnant.

754
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:23,067
So what if the father's black?

755
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,067
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Black!

756
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:28,633
It is not the color,
it is culture.

757
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:30,433
[multiple disembodied voices]

758
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:33,200
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): And what
about the child, [non-english].

759
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,167
[discordant sounds]

760
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,467
Tell me, what should
I do, [inaudible]?

761
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:53,867
Tell me.

762
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:54,867
Dear lady!

763
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,867
Are you in distress?

764
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:59,233
But I don't remember
how I got here?

765
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,000
I've been watching you
for the last ten minutes.

766
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,567
Couldn't decide whether you
were wading or drowning?

767
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,333
Oh no.

768
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:09,500
My [inaudible], I'm
losing everything today.

769
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Oh my dear, allow me.

770
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,700
These feet are too
delicate, too feminine to be

771
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,467
wandering around unaided
in this sandy wilderness.

772
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,633
Thank you very
much, but I must go.

773
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:23,600
Go?
Go where?

774
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,567
What, like that?

775
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,933
With bare feet?

776
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,800
You know, I always
start with the footwear

777
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,933
when I'm creating a character.

778
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,733
I'm on the short
list for [inaudible]

779
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,467
at the Christmas pantomime.

780
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,900
Yes, yellow moccasins
for her, I should think.

781
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,167
So, why don't we go shopping?

782
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:41,533
I don't feel so well, mister.

783
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,100
Ambrose Waddington,
actor, historian,

784
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,500
and ancient Blackpudlian
at your service.

785
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,400
A friend of mine owns a
jolly decent shoe shop.

786
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,467
I'm not sure.

787
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:55,300
Oh it would be an
honor to accompany

788
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,033
a beautiful lady around this
fallen woman I call home.

789
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:05,267
There.

790
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,967
I'm going to go out
with everybody's favor.

791
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:20,967
It'll be all right, Hashida.

792
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:23,033
Look, your mom and
dead, they're dead nice.

793
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,967
He'll come around.

794
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,767
Everybody knows now.

795
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,500
This really will kill them.

796
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,700
Oh God.

797
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,600
I want to die.

798
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,233
I can't go back ever.

799
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,300
What do you want to go back
to Birmingham for anyway?

800
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,033
It's the land that time forgot.

801
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,233

are called aunties.

Ha-ha.

804
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,700
Oh, why can't Oliver be here?

805
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,600
Can't you call him?

806
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm on my own now.

807
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,533
[flush]

808
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:06,500
I'm in control.

809
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,200
Let's go outside.

810
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:22,567
What is this?

811
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:30,533
[shouting in background]

812
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:35,100
[MUSIC - "I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR"]

813
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:11,533
Just behave yourself!

814
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:12,600
What are we doing?

815
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,533
You're such a slag.

816
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,567
- Buy you a drink, girls?
- No, thank you.

817
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,800
We're fine.

818
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,700
Southern Comfort
and orange, please.

819
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,133
You said a pee break.

820
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:34,733
We've been here half an hour--

821
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,800
I'm thinking.

822
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,833
All right?

823
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:40,733
Manjit, Manjit, I'm sorry.

824
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,633
I'm sorry, huh?

825
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,567
OK?

826
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,067
So where are you going?

827
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:47,867
I'm going to find my wife.

828
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:49,567
We're supposed to be
home early, remember?

829
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,833
But Manjit, this
is where it starts.

830
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:55,433
The one day, you'll realize
that she's, she's changed

831
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,367
everything that held
you up, and then

832
00:49:57,467 --> 00:49:59,767
she doesn't need you anymore.

833
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:06,100
And then, baby brother, you're
going to want to kill her.

834
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,600
Is that why she left?

835
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,800
What the hell did you do?

836
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,200
Manjit, what was
I supposed to do?

837
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,500
She's not coming home.

838
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,833
No, but if I get Amrik
she'll soon follow.

839
00:50:20,933 --> 00:50:22,567
Yes?

840
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,100
Manjit, make the phone call.

841
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,900
Tell them we'll find them.

842
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,333

everything's fine.

Are they giving you trouble?

847
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:50,567
And who are you?

848
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,167
My bloody uncle?

849
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:55,600
No, I'm your bloody
cousin, actually.

I've got to go.

We're in luck, lads.

861

and Tinku you know,

a couple of slappers
from back home.

863
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,533
Well, they must have
come up on the trip.

864
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:40,133
Come on, let's rock along.

865
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,367
Oh it's Charles!

866

My dear fellow, how
nice to see you!

00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:00,600
Nice to see you!

868

How long's the engagement for?

10 days, a fortnight.

870
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,267
Oh that's nice.

00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:07,367
Hey, you want to be careful
you don't get harpooned!

872
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:08,133
How's the wife?

873
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:09,333
She's in the other suit.

874
00:52:09,433 --> 00:52:10,200
Oh I see.

875
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,333
You're in it together.
- Yes.

00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,067
Can you skate?

No, no I'm a shark.

Hello, Ambrose.

00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,933
How nice to see you.

882
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,033
So, you're going to
[inaudible] I take it?

883
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:22,000
Yes, just coming around.

884
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,033
Oh nice.

885
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:24,000
Well, we don't want to go off.

886
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,267
Ha, no, that's the thing.

887
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:26,367
Isn't it?

888
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:28,967
You want to be freshly
chilled I take you.

Absolutely gorgeous.

00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:34,533
Now move.

00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:39,533
Oh Asha, my dear.

893
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:40,533
Oh you found a pair.

894
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:41,800
Oh they're beautiful.

895
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,700
May I introduce you to my
very good friend Charles.

He's going to be appearing
in "Moby Dick on Ice."

I personally think that--
how do you do-- I personally

898
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,833
think you should be in "Jaws 3"

899
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:54,300
Hello, Auntie Asha.

900
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,500
Uh, Simi.

901
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,900
How's Hashida?

902
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,233
Can't seem to
find her anywhere.

903
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:03,233
Hopefully she'll turn
up at Manhattan's.

00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:07,233
[non-english] I didn't mean
to tell everyone like that.

I expected more
from you, Auntie.

906
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,200
Why don't you talk
to her later on, huh?

907
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,200
You know, set an example.

Yeah, this way.

Come on.

talk to your and Ranjit's.

Just to help.

915
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,167

Hashida just now?

916
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:45,767

00:54:04,433 --> 00:54:05,733
No, Auntie, no.

919
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,133
She wants me to
have my hair done.

920
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:16,700
She's trying, Ginder.

921
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,100
I can't.

922
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,300
Course you can,
you deserve it.

923
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,733
Look, do we have
to go with her?

924
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:35,767
Look , she's really sad.

925
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:36,867
We can't just leave her.

926
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:38,000
So?

927
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:48,767
All right.

928
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:50,100
This is it.

929
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,633
Look, you can go now.

930
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:53,267
I only said it
to shut them up.

931
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,067
Didn't think you'd
actually do it.

932
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,000
Look, it's OK.

933
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,300
I'm just checking it out.

934
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,000
What?

935
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,500
So much for Dr. Hashida.

936
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
What, I never wanted to be
a fucking doctor anyway.

937
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,067
All right.

938
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:09,367
Besides, I've got nothing
left to mess now, have I?

939
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:11,867
Well don't do
anything I wouldn't do.

940
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,000
Come on, you.

941
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:16,733
Look.

942
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,733
I'll be all right.

943
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:22,033
I'll catch you up later.

944
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:23,133
Hashida.

945
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,233
Go on.

946
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,167

[non-english speech]

954
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,667
You're so-- you're
not like the other

955
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:34,033
girls from around here.

956
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,567
Am I special then, Pauly?

957
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:37,900
Yeah.

958
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,533
All golden like the top
of a sesame seed bun.

959
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:42,800
Really?

01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:18,267
Look, um, I'm really hungry.

963
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:19,833
Should we go and get
a burger or something?

964
01:00:19,933 --> 01:00:20,833
Oh, a burger.

965
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:22,433

Oh, who did you buy it for?

968
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,400
For my grandson.

969
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,800
Lovely?

970
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,867
Lovely.

Very nice.

[non-english speech]

973

[non-english speech]
This country

977
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:20,133
has cost us our children.

Excuse me, if it's a takeaway
you want, the [inaudible]

[non-english speech] No shame.

985
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,100
They want to get back
from where they come from.

986
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,300
We should never have
come to this country.

987
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,800
They breed like rabbits.

If the baby dies, it will
be a blessing for everyone.

What for?

01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,700
To curse me like this?

Oh, I love the sea.

1000
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,467
The Lake District is better.

1001
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:45,300
You know, Ranjit used to whisk
me off there on secret dates.

1002
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,900
That was before we were married.

1003
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,233
Never after.

1004
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,667
Yeah, well he
doesn't sound much like

1005
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,700
the happy holiday-type to me.

1006
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,700
He could have been.

1007
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,933
Away from his family.

1008
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:58,267
That business.

1009
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,133
Maybe a few more days like this.

1010
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:01,733
Just Amrik, him and me.

1011
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:05,033
A couple of day trips wouldn't
have made much difference.

1012
01:03:05,133 --> 01:03:06,000
You knew that.

1013
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,967
That's why you got out.

1014
01:03:07,067 --> 01:03:08,333
Isn't it?

1015
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,733
Or maybe that's enough
to make him change?

1016
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,700
Maybe if I gave him
another the chance.

1017
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,000
Can't see a bloody thing.

1018
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,367

see a bloody thing.

could, uh, focus

1020
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:36,300
you'd be more bloody helpful.

I'll tell you what's wrong.

1022
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,267
Too much brain and
not enough balls.

1023
01:03:40,367 --> 01:03:41,833
That's your problem, man.

1024
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:43,233
Look at him.

1025
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,200
Ranjit, fills in the
forms, and I drive the van.

1026
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,267
But he ain't nothing
special Manjit, man.

1027
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,000
Is he, ay?

1028
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,200
Look at him.

1029
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,867
You're fancy cigarettes
and your degree.

1030
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:53,167
They could keep it, could they.

1031
01:03:53,267 --> 01:03:54,733
Hey drop it man.

1032
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,700
Manjit, leave it.

1033
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,467
I ain't the stupid one.

1034
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:03,200
I know what I am, and
I know what to do,

It is.

Stand up.

That's it.

1066

No.

1067
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,767
No!

Honestly.

Quickly.

Oh shit.

01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:06,667
Have you seen a little
boy in a green t-shirt?

1078
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:07,667
He's carrying a gorilla.

1079

Excuse me, have you seen a
little boy in a green t-shirt?

1080
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,000
It's Daddy.

1081
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,800
My son.

01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,567
No, it's OK.

1084
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:37,700
It's OK.

1085
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,333
Daddy has never
hurt you, has he?

1086
01:07:40,433 --> 01:07:43,000
Did you miss me?

I found him.

1093
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,233
Both of you.

1094
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:22,933
Do you want everyone to
say I can't look after you?

1095
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:25,100
They can't take
you away from me.

1096
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,367
What happened?

1097
01:09:00,467 --> 01:09:01,133
GINDER: Nothing.

1098
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:03,667
Was anybody following me?

1099
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:04,633
Who?

1100
01:09:04,733 --> 01:09:05,833
Are you all right?

1101
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,167
I should never
have come out today.

1102
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:10,367
I should never have gone
to you stupid refuge.

1103
01:09:10,467 --> 01:09:12,667
I can't do what you
think I should do.

1104
01:09:12,767 --> 01:09:14,067
It's not me.

1105
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,033
Ginder, listen.

1106
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:18,600
I have to go back to him.

1107
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,200
I can't bear it anymore.

1108
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:24,467
Simi, Simi.

1109
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:25,833
She has gone mad.

1110
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:27,100
She attacked me.

1111
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,167
Then she smashed
up the whole place.

1112
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:31,567
Then she tried to
burn off my skin.

1113
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,500
Who?

1114
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,300
[non-english] Hashida.

1115
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,233
Oh, what is going on today?

1116
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:38,067
That whore and a half,
in that cafe over there.

1117
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,567
Look at my clothes.

1118
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,067
Right?

1119
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:45,267
Everybody go to Manhattan's
while I look for Hashida.

1120
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:46,033
Go on.

1121
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:49,033
What else can happen today?

1122
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:51,667
Why the fuck did
I give up smoking?

1123
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,367
Your wife must be so lucky.

1124
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:58,467
You bring her to lovely
places like this?

1125
01:09:58,567 --> 01:10:01,933
Ah well, tragedy hit
last year, I'm afraid.

1126
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,867
My dear wife, God bless her--
- I'm sorry.

1127
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,433
She passed away?

1128
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:09,667
No, she turned feminist and
ran off with her agent, Mandy,

1129
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:14,200
but my acting has been
all the family I need.

1130
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,033
Have you ever seen
any of her Indian films?

1131
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:18,700
Seen them?

1132
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,633
Been in them.

1133
01:10:19,733 --> 01:10:21,167
Gunga-din.

01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,733
Lovely, who did you play?

1137
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,800
Why [inaudible] of course.

Asha?

1142
01:12:39,633 --> 01:12:40,533
Asha?

1143
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:42,100
You're getting drenched.

1144
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,633
Come away.

1145
01:12:48,733 --> 01:12:49,533
You're a Pisces.

1146
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:50,667
I knew it.

1147
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:54,033
Gentle, sensitive, and
a great love of water.

1148
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:55,900
Thank you very
much for your time.

1149
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,367
They'll be looking for me.

1150
01:12:57,467 --> 01:13:00,567
Oh no, I must show
you one last place.

1151
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,567
My home from home.

1152
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:04,567
Come.

1153
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:07,167
It won't take long.

1154
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:16,533
I'm gonna miss you.

1155
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,933
I'm gonna miss you too.

1156
01:13:19,033 --> 01:13:20,767
I'll write, I promise.

1157
01:13:20,867 --> 01:13:21,733
I got something for you.

1158
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:22,633
What?

1159
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:26,800
Really?

1160
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,400
You shouldn't have.

1161
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,567
You're worth it.

1162
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:33,833
I'm sorry.

1163
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,433
We've got to go.

1164
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:39,567
Madhu, Madhu you'll end up like
Hashida if you're not careful.

1165
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,600
MADHU: What's the
matter with you?

1166
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,767
You're so embarrassing.

1167
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,933
Well, well.

1168
01:16:04,033 --> 01:16:05,100
Look who it is.

1169
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,100
What the hell
are you doing here?

1170
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,233
Might have guessed
you've be mixed up in this.

1171
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,700
Right.
Where is she?

1172
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,767
Look, you've done your bit.

1173
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:13,867
She needs us now.

1174
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:15,800
Yeah, but she wants me.

1175
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,067
Why can't any of
you handle that?

1176
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:19,867
Listen, you little shit.

1177
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:21,167
I do handle it.

1178
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:23,400
I handled the bloody
shipwrecks every day.

1179
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,800
Look, if you want this to
work, you're going to have

1180
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,467
to be everything to her.

1181
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:33,567
Family, community.

1182
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,800
Look at you.

1183
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,200
You think this is pressure.

1184
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,333
What about in nine
months' time, huh?

1185
01:16:38,433 --> 01:16:39,300
Nine years?

1186
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,367
Pressure.

1187
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:41,633
Please, don't you tell
me about pressure.

1188
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:42,533
All right?

1189
01:16:42,633 --> 01:16:43,667
We've managed a year.

1190
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,100
What?

1191
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,233
You think I've come this
far for the sodded sea air?

1192
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:58,900
Have you ever been on
a stage before, Asha?

1193
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,133
No.

1194
01:17:00,233 --> 01:17:03,100
It's so beautiful.

1195
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,333
Mind the steps.

1196
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,167
There.

1197
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:20,000
Imagine you're in
front of 1300 people.

1198
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,467
We shouldn't be
alone here like this.

1199
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,133
Oh, let me, Asha.

1200
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:29,467
I used to be very good at this.

1201
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:30,433
No.

1202
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,000
It isn't right.

1203
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,300
See.

1204
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,533
I know.

1205
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:44,467
We used to have 11 live
venues here before the war.

1206
01:17:44,567 --> 01:17:46,633
Opera.

1207
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:53,567

popular culture then.

1208
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,467
Now?

1209
01:17:56,567 --> 01:18:00,233
It breaks my heart.

1210
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,733
Look what we've become.

1211
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:05,833
Not like you.

1212
01:18:05,933 --> 01:18:09,933
You've kept hold
of your traditions.

1213
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:11,433
Proud.

1214
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:13,333
Exotic.

1215
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:15,733
Fascinating.

1216
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:18,300
Gentle.

1217
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,700
Exquisite.

1218
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800

to be like this.

What about me?

01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,033
I was a good singer in college.

1232
01:19:06,133 --> 01:19:08,233
I never had headaches.

1233
01:19:11,133 --> 01:19:14,200
And I wasn't born selling
bloody newspapers.

What are you doing, Oliver?

1260
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:25,300
Look, I'm supposed
to be at Manhattan's.

1261
01:22:47,933 --> 01:22:50,567
What he gave me, he
must really love me.

1262
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:52,633
Are you talking about
the chain or the love bite?

1263
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:53,933
Chain.

1264
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:54,867
You really believe that?

1265
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:56,300
Do you?

1266
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,133
Yeah.

What is it with you?

1273
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:08,500
Why do you always let these
white prats do it to you?

1274
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,033
Because all the brown
prats, they're all

1275
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,700
doing it with the white girls.

1276

Oh my God.

30 years I've been here, and
I've never seen such a thing.

1284
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,700
Bloody fool.

1285
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,300
Mixing with stupid.

1286
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,267
Dirty boys.

1289
01:24:03,233 --> 01:24:05,000
He must be very tired.

[non-english speech]

1291
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,000
Still no Simi?

1292
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,400
Right then.

1293
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,267
Four, slow, comfortable
screws against the world.

1294
01:24:13,367 --> 01:24:14,167
Screw?

1295
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,900
Hello everybody.

1296
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,100
Where were you?

1297
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,467
I just needed you to be there.

1298
01:24:47,067 --> 01:24:50,733
I don't ever want to have
to feel like that again.

1299
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:51,733
I'm sorry.

1300
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:56,667
I'm sorry.

1301
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:08,100
I'm not ready to lose you yet.

1302
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:20,833
Anyway, you sure you're only
with me because everyone

1303
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:22,367
tells you not to be.

1304
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,567
I'm gonna have to go
through this, you know?

1305
01:25:35,933 --> 01:25:42,433
Yeah, I know but-- I know.

1306
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:44,033
Because you don't want
to lose your folks

1307
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:45,567
or those auntie-shanties.

1308
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:54,600
But we've got to do
it together, yeah?

1309
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,567
No fights.

1310
01:25:56,667 --> 01:25:59,167
No slamming doors.

1311
01:25:59,267 --> 01:26:02,900
No sneaking around.

1312
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,933
We don't have much choice

1313
01:26:05,033 --> 01:26:06,100
That's true.

1314
01:26:08,933 --> 01:26:16,733
Anyway I'll have to
go into college even

1315
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,067
if it's just for my parents.

1316
01:26:20,367 --> 01:26:20,967
It's okay.

1317
01:26:21,067 --> 01:26:22,567
I can live with that.

1318
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:23,533
Great.

1319
01:26:23,633 --> 01:26:29,733
I mean we can go away.

1320
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:30,667
Well--

1321
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:58,533
Magic.

Sorry I'm late everyone.

1323
01:27:31,267 --> 01:27:32,200
Did you find Hashida?

1324
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,767
Yeah, she's not coming back.

1325
01:27:33,867 --> 01:27:35,400
She's all right.

1326
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,233
Where's Amrik?

1327
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:37,400
Oh, I put him down to sleep.

1328
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,333
He's really tired.

1329
01:27:38,433 --> 01:27:39,167

I will go and call her.

1337

1342
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:38,333
Get off.

1343
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:39,500
Family wounds.

1344
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,433
I wear them with pride.

1345
01:29:33,967 --> 01:29:34,867
Bloody hell.

1346
01:29:34,967 --> 01:29:37,267
I wouldn't go in there.

1347
01:29:37,367 --> 01:29:38,900
Now go talk to her, all right?

1348
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,467
Don't worry.

1349
01:29:40,567 --> 01:29:41,600
See what she says, OK?

1350
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:04,200
It's nothing.

1351
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,033
I'm OK.

1352
01:31:05,133 --> 01:31:06,400
Can we have the bill, please?

1353
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,267
Isn't it time
to say good night?

1354
01:31:08,367 --> 01:31:09,000
Right.

Let's everyone go.

Stop her.

Stop Ginder.

01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,500
What?

1360
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,100
Where did you see him?

1361
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:33,733
She's OK.

1362
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:34,867
No, let's wait.

1363
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:36,167
Let's just wait.

1364
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:38,200
You wait here, let her
talk to her husband.

1365
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,167
Is she going to be all right?

1366
01:31:41,267 --> 01:31:45,433
Look, I know you shouldn't
have gone off like that.

1367
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:47,033
I forgive you.

1368
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,300
Um, Mr. Amrik.

1369
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,400
Your car?

1370
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,667
No.

1371
01:31:57,767 --> 01:31:59,633
Ranjit, listen to me.

1372
01:31:59,733 --> 01:32:01,533
Listen.

1373
01:32:01,633 --> 01:32:03,633
I have been thinking
about coming back.

1374
01:32:03,733 --> 01:32:05,500
Yes, and that is why I'm here.

1375
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,433
But to you.

1376
01:32:06,533 --> 01:32:07,567
Yes

1377
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:09,633
To you.

1378
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:11,600
Not your family.

1379
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,467
Look what they're doing to you.

1380
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:15,367
You have to choose.

Now enough's enough now, yes.

Do you know my name
is dirt back home.

I didn't--

1387
01:32:32,633 --> 01:32:33,467
Listen to me.

1388
01:32:33,567 --> 01:32:35,033
Everyone says I'm
being too soft.

1389
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,133
Do you know that?
Do you know how that feels?

1390
01:32:36,233 --> 01:32:37,633
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1391
01:32:40,733 --> 01:32:41,633
Please, just don't.

1392
01:32:41,733 --> 01:32:42,633
Get in the car.

1393
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,500
No.

1394
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,500
I can't.

1395
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,900
I've come too far now.

1396
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,267
I just want us to talk about it.

1397
01:32:56,367 --> 01:32:58,433
I just want to hear-- I want
you to hear what I'm saying,

1398
01:32:58,533 --> 01:32:59,267
please.

1399
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:01,933
I just want you to listen to me.

1400
01:33:02,033 --> 01:33:02,833
You never listen to me.

1401
01:33:02,933 --> 01:33:04,000
Just shut up.

1403
01:33:09,633 --> 01:33:11,867
All right, yes, yes.

1404
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,167
You said you were
going to talk to her.

1405
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:14,300
What are you doing?

1406
01:33:16,533 --> 01:33:18,033
[arguing]

1407
01:33:42,233 --> 01:33:44,600
You give me back my child.

1408
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,533
You're hurting him.

1409
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:46,467
OK, Ginder.

1410
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:47,533
Listen to me.

1411
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:48,500
You choose.
OK?

1412
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,233
You choose.

1413
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:51,267
We'll move out then, OK?

1414
01:33:51,367 --> 01:33:53,200
Just listen, I'll be different.

1415
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,567
I'll be different,
Ginder, I promise.

1416
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:56,867
Please.

1417
01:33:56,967 --> 01:33:59,400
I thought we might
be able to work it out.

1418
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,633
Listen, why do you
make me do this to you?

1419
01:34:03,733 --> 01:34:06,900
I don't want to.

1420
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,867
You can help me.

1421
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:11,133
You can help me change, Ginder.

1422
01:34:11,233 --> 01:34:13,133
I can't help you anymore.

1423
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,800
Please, give him to me.

1424
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,833
Please.

1425
01:34:18,933 --> 01:34:19,767
Please.

1426
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:23,167
Put that boy down now.

1427
01:34:23,267 --> 01:34:25,467
Do you want him to
grow up like you?

01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:33,633
Amrik.

01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:54,800
What are you staring at?

1431
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:58,233
Is that what you want?

1432
01:34:58,333 --> 01:34:59,133
Huh?

1433
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,533
What do you think, huh?

1434
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:09,467
That her makeup and
haircut makes you new?

1436
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:21,700
Now who would want you now?

1437
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,033
Only me.

1438
01:35:24,133 --> 01:35:27,500
You're my wife.

01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:45,500
Come on, man.

1442
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,500
Get the fuck up.

1443
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,000
Get the fuck up.

1444
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:54,900
Mum was right, she's
just bad fucking news.

All these bitches are.

1446
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:59,633
We've seen you,
having a great fucking

1447
01:35:59,733 --> 01:36:01,000
time without your husbands.

1448
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:04,567
Just you wait til we get back.

1449
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:06,467
Seaside trip, my ass.

1450
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:11,600
Well, you fucked
up good and proper.

1451
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:13,100
Didn't you, eh?

1452
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,333
You should have smacked her
til she never got up again.

1453
01:36:16,433 --> 01:36:17,233
Balbir!

1454
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,167
What?

1455
01:36:22,467 --> 01:36:24,633
You know, you really
piss me off man.

1456
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,733
It's Hashida.

1457
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,567
What can you do?

1458
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:44,733
OK, everybody.

1459
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:45,733
Come on.

01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:46,800
My beautiful bathing belles.

1461
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:51,867
I have a little present for you.

1462

Anybody want a piece?
