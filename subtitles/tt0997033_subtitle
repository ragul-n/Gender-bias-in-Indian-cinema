1
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,324
He will come. He will surely come.

2
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,357
He can't remain without coming.

3
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,625
Since last one year we are all waiting for him.

4
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,962
Come soon. Don't make us cry.

5
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,872
Come, let us go.

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,879
No, he will come.

7
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:35,261
Brother Deva. Brother Deva. Brother Deva.

8
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,562
Wonder man.

9
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,401
Wonder man.

10
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,870
Wonder man. Wonder man.

11
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,966
Dear parents and students,
let us all share this happiness.

12
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,467
Not only to our school, but our Devan
is a pride....to our whole Kerala.

13
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:41,544
Now let us see his ability to
calculate....with numbers.

14
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,658
Along with this brilliant student,
l take this opportunity..

15
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,390
..to introduce the other nine brilliant
students....of this school.

16
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,299
When you will hear that all
these 10 have come from..

17
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,741
..one house, you will be all
the more surprised.

18
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:50,754
Also l will introduce you to the
guardian of these....10 brilliant children.

19
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:05,495
Dear people, l am standing on this stage..

20
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,364
..filled with joy and pride in my heart.

21
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,504
ln this school, where children
from well to do families..

22
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:16,238
..study, my children stand in the first place.

23
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:27,720
Three years before l found this child Devadas..

24
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:34,762
..in a street of this city, left to beg
in the streets.

25
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:41,339
lf l did not rescue this child,
who was tired due to hunger..

26
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:47,541
..and poverty, then today this
school would not have..

27
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,807
..some one to get a name for this school.

28
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:57,256
These children were God given gifts for me.

29
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,986
Such children only got ordinary education
meant for such children

30
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:08,996
But l wanted my children to be well educated..

31
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,329
..like other children in a good school like this.

32
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:17,204
l express my gratitude to the school management..
..for helping me in that.

33
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,341
Grams 2.

34
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,743
Maida, 3

35
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,513
Maida, 3.- Maida 3.

36
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,121
Total 15 packages.

37
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:36,557
Previous balance, Rs.918.
First give the money.

38
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,993
Write in the account.
- l have stopped giving on credit

39
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,731
For writing the account of Snehalayam...
..a 200 pages notebook is finished.

40
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,028
Only account is in it.
No money is coming in.

41
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,004
Maya, pays you when her
salary comes, Gopal.- You don't talk.

42
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,574
Every month you take 5000 rupees worth..

43
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,143
..grocery and then come and
give some paltry amount.

44
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,713
This is a shop which l run to live.
Not for charity.

45
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,384
Please give some cereals and oil today

46
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,418
lf the orphans starve for a couple
of days...they won't die.

47
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,455
You all go. l have other work.

48
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,157
They have come to take on account.

49
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,490
You don't need this chilli powder.
- Hey.

50
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:23,132
Listen Maya, he took my food and ate it.

51
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:29,872
Not only in studies, but in
eating too he is no.1 .- Yes. Yes.

52
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,680
Who is this? Chingini.
- l won't talk to you.

53
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,148
My sweet child, aren't you?
- Don't touch me.

54
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,153
She is angry.- Yes, l am angry.

55
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,922
What did Sam give?
- He did not give anything.

56
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,091
You did not have milk!

57
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,596
l will drink only if he gives, isn't it?

58
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,461
He did not give? Why did he do so?

59
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,864
You go and ask him that.

60
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,199
l see. So you fought, isn't it?
- Yes, l did.

61
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,636
Let us see him now.

62
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,779
Since he did not give her milk..
..we will make him do 100 sit ups.- Yes.

63
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,208
Come.

64
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,223
What to give them now?

65
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,287
Sam..

66
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,090
There comes the mother service and children.

67
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,892
You did not give milk to the child?
- No.

68
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,133
Why?- Because it is not there.

69
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,358
Then you did not get milk.

70
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,365
Not that l did not get.
They did not give.

71
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,298
We don't have anything.

72
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,566
Right from salt to camphor.
Nothing is there.

73
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,905
Got such a good house on rent,
wearing such nice dresses..

74
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,083
..and walk around stylishly,
it is good to know..

75
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,310
..hunger every now and then.
No way out of it.

76
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,489
Which is that way?
- The highway.

77
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:48,888
They say these children don't look like..
..poor children.

78
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:57,568
" Truth lost. Glamour won.''

79
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:04,039
" in the guise of truth, changes came.''

80
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,812
Why did you stop?

81
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,852
l only wrote, l only set the tune.

82
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,221
lt is a new song that....l am singing.
- lt is good.

83
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,263
But l am afraid that Jesus will disappear..
..from the cross hearing you sing.

84
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,590
Don't make fun of my singing.

85
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,500
l have taught you to sing too.

86
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,071
You too have sung my songs.

87
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,376
Did you come here to disturb me?

88
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,602
l have something important to tell you.

89
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,144
l too wanted to speak to you.

90
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,214
Children, you all go and sing this
tune without mistakes.

91
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,649
Let me talk to this joker for a while.

92
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:57,392
lt is 23 years since l got a girl child..
..under the cross of the orphanage.

93
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,724
Now you may be a big journalist.

94
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:05,131
But you know the price..
..of love and the good that you do.

95
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,438
When you studied and got a job, and
went to live alone....l did not oppose.

96
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:14,403
But do you still want all the same things?

97
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,444
There is nothing wrong with rearing the kids.

98
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,580
But to educate them in such a good school..

99
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,854
lf you too would have thought like this then..

100
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,785
..today, would this Maya be like this?
- All that is correct.

101
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,085
How will you maintain them in the future?

102
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,526
You were the one who taught me....that the
birds in the sky are independent etc..

103
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,723
..similarly our work will somehow be done.

104
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,834
Presently can you give me Rs.2000 to carry on?

105
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,198
l don't have that much with me, dear.

106
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,807
l am pulling on with money that
people give in the church.

107
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,477
Orphanage nowadays is a big business.

108
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,241
To show big and cheat others is something,
l can't do.

109
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,682
Now l can give Rs.200.
- l don't want that.

110
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,023
You roll that and keep it in your pocket.

111
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,720
Now there is only one way, go to the office..

112
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,954
..and catch that fellow's feet and see.

113
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,261
You must shock them.

114
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,334
lf there are no shocking words..

115
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
..then very soon this place
will get locked up.

116
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,140
What is your decision?

117
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,337
Either you shock the people..
..or lock this news channel.

118
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,145
Some how we will do it sir.

119
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,076
What are you doing carrying the
camera since morning?

120
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,840
To photograph dogs and cats?

121
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,709
Those were days when l went
behind Saji with camera.

122
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,319
lt was then that we got
shocking words every day.

123
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,719
Saji got in the auto.
l get in.

124
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,258
He gets down, and l follow.

125
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,323
We can shoot him without his knowledge.

126
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,504
Morning scoop, afternoon
and evening scoops too.

127
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,694
You shocked the people.

128
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,205
Only this Kosi can tell lies to the people.

129
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,344
lt is me who make fools of the people.

130
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,013
Who else is there in this place
except me to do so?

131
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,206
Sitting here and talking big is not smartness.

132
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,714
Get out and get some hot news.
- You are the expert in searching.

133
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,450
All of you should get scoops and come. Now go.

134
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,590
Where is the comb?

135
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,659
You are still here?- She is coming.

136
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,571
Miss Maya, what hot news do you have?
- Sir. That..

137
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,710
Write and give that a channel's
MD gotjaundice and died.

138
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,778
That is hot news.
- Hey.- l am going.

139
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,217
Miss. Maya why are you so late?
- Sir... l..

140
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,045
l don't want any explanation.

141
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,887
Do you have any news?

142
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,454
Sir, l came to tell you a personal matter.

143
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,891
What personal matter?

144
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,426
ls it sensational?- Sir, l want Rs.2000.

145
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,495
lnstead of getting hot news,
what has Maya come for?

146
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,226
That is very urgent sir.

147
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,564
You can give it as advance..
..from my salary.

148
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,264
Looks like taking advance is a permanent thing.

149
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,909
When l am sitting wondering how to pay salary..

150
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,635
..and she comes to ask salary advance.

151
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,913
This is not the only channel for me.

152
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,347
Those Kerala TV people are after me
for a long time....to join them.

153
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,111
l will go and join them.- Maya.

154
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,083
What sir?

155
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,918
How much do you want?
This Radha Ramanan will give.

156
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,254
Thank you, sir.

157
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,727
" North side of Aluva, Thathen thaiyum.''
-" Thathen thaiyum.''

158
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,798
" Did you know how l sowed seeds..''

159
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:28,133
" ..grew them up, plucked the veggies..''
"..made curry out of them?''

160
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,401
" Oh dear children of the great house, dears.''
-" Dears.''

161
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,638
" North side of Aluva, Thathen thaiyum.''
-" Thathen thaiyum.''

162
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,817
" Thathen thaiyum.''- " Thathen thaiyum.''

163
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,815
" Thathen thaiyum.''- " Thathen thaiyum.''

164
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,820
" Thathen thaiyum.''- " Thathen thaiyum.''

165
00:13:54,767 --> 00:14:04,335
Who is this prankster Kannan, who came
sneaking and who waited gulping down.

166
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,276
And sneakingly pelted stone
which hit the head?

167
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,518
Who ran away limping?

168
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,384
Even after providing in ample quantity,
The greed is insatiable!

169
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,750
Even if provided ceaselessly,
the desire is insatiable

170
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,519
lt's chariot race everywhere.

171
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,392
Aren't we all like this?

172
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,294
Even after a sumptuous meal
we are discontented.

173
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,129
Sometimes, we speak very sweetly;

174
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,708
Many a time, there is fireplace in the mind.

175
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:46,545
Who is this prankster Kannan, who came
sneaking and who waited gulping down.

176
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:20,946
Whenever l sleep watching dreams,
pain as though the chest is splitting.

177
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:30,185
ln the holy mind, you are like a top
which landed spinning sometime.

178
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:40,135
Like a paper-boat moving aimlessly
in the northern wind.

179
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:45,174
ln the supporting stream,
there is always goodness.

180
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:50,141
The world is now a family.

181
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:30,445
Though cried in the moonlight,
like a child lost somewhere,

182
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:39,724
Whenever began in weeping, as if
someone arrived with compassion.

183
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:45,063
The first seen is the mother and
a motherly kiss is usual.

184
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,603
O the mind smack over it!

185
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,901
We have the golden Sun
which splashed freshness;

186
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,602
Also the silver Moon

187
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:59,281
From now, the happiness is
like a cherished treasure

188
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:08,553
Who is this prankster Kannan, who came
sneaking and who waited gulping down.

189
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:17,926
He is up to some mischief always...

190
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,603
You must have imagined it all.

191
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,643
Hey no. l heard it. Laughter.

192
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,012
Some noise of things too.

193
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,552
When someone come here the
ghosts have made a noise.

194
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,386
Now will they go.

195
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,064
No, they are ghosts who permanently stay here.

196
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,232
ln this British Villa one white man
and his wife died by hanging.

197
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,899
l too heard that.

198
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,232
Hence l did not rent this one.
l rented the next one.

199
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,235
Why so much suspense?
Why don't we go and see?

200
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,913
Hey, there is a smell of the dead here.

201
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,752
Yes, the smell of dead bodies.

202
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,747
Hey, don't frighten the kids here.

203
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,765
Now do you believe? See there they lie.

204
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,781
This seems to be some anatomy lab.

205
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,953
Oh my God.

206
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,625
Hey, a dead man.

207
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,629
Hey, small Satan.

208
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,105
Hey, run.

209
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,101
Hey, small Satan

210
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,773
What? What is all the noise?

211
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,776
What?

212
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,274
Hey, a ghost. - Where?

213
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,113
At my back. - Back?

214
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,949
Now before me. - l will kill you.
Don't you know Dracula?

215
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:13,948
Leave him.

216
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:14,778
Who are you

217
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:15,510
Who are you?

218
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,451
Who we are? You don't know?

219
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,452
Yes. l know now.

220
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,786
The kids from the next door orphanage.

221
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,292
What? Orphanage? Which Orphanage?

222
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,630
Don't talk nonsense. We are not orphans.

223
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,126
lf you say once more..

224
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,304
Why is he getting so angry?

225
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,130
What is it? What is your name?
- Einstein.

226
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,136
lce cream?

227
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,469
No. Halwa. Albert Einstein. Scientist.

228
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,980
He is dead long before.

229
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,812
He is a dead Einstein.

230
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,986
l am an alive Einstein. Damodharan.

231
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,815
They called me twice for Nobel Prize.
l did not go.

232
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,952
A surgeon of bodies?

233
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,489
l am scientist of animals.

234
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,161
Man came from monkeys, isn't it?

235
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,820
l am making monkey from men.

236
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,160
What for monkeys from men?

237
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,335
To give you company.

238
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,337
Hey. My mother. Get this off me.

239
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,844
What? What happened?

240
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,679
lt will happen. The original Einstein has come.

241
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,523
Good morning every body.
- Good morning sir.

242
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,353
Damodharan who are these people?
- Neighbours.

243
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,526
Good.

244
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,372
Hi, how are you? - Shake his hands.

245
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,535
Hi, buddy.

246
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,536
Give hands. - Yes.

247
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,375
Something wrong?

248
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:58,546
Are you Mr. Scientist R.C.Shekar?
- Yes.

249
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,887
Oh, my God. Hey do you know who he is?

250
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,392
He is a great scientist.

251
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,063
He has been recommended for Nobel prize.

252
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,228
l have seen you on TV. My name is Maya.

253
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,070
Good name.

254
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
You speak Malayalam.

255
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,403
Very little. Born in Bombay.

256
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,735
Now staying in New York.

257
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,745
But my wife was a Malayalee.
Hence l speak a little.

258
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,416
Sethu Laxmi, isn't it?

259
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,083
A well known classical dancer.

260
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,754
Yes. But now she is no more.

261
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,085
l know sir. She died in
an accident in New York.

262
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,094
She made me and daughter alone
and passed away.

263
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,095
Daughter?

264
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,765
She is studying in Los Angeles.

265
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,428
Sir one doubt.

266
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,762
ln an lnternational Science Congress..

267
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,101
..you had given a lecture,
three years ago, isn't it? - Yes.

268
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,608
ln that you had said if the
human doesn't reflect light..

269
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,111
..it will be transparent and men can
become invisible.- Yes.

270
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,114
Many scientists say it is very much possible.

271
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,620
Do you still do that experiment?

272
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,288
Yes. Of course.

273
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,121
l came here in that connection.

274
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,784
You have set up a lab here isn't it?
- Yes.

275
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,464
There are a few rare medicines available..
..in the forests of Kerala.

276
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,967
Looks like you have a good chance to succeed.

277
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,636
Hopefully, let us see.

278
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,006
When you see that man,
he looks like a Mandrake magician.

279
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:31,915
Right he wears a hat too.

280
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,677
Yes, he has a hat too.

281
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,345
What are you thinking?

282
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,846
lf l go and study there l too
can find out something isn't it?

283
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,027
Yes. He is a great discoverer isn't it?

284
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,031
Son Devadas, go study there and find out who..
..my parents were?

285
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,223
Why are you taking my clothes off.

286
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,731
Sir has said you should be fully naked.
Lie there.

287
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,733
" When l apply oil on my Bala Gopalan, see him.''

288
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,238
Bala Gopalan is your father.

289
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,241
You should be lucky to lie like this in 35 years.

290
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,760
Damodhara, ready?

291
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,258
l have done what you told, sir.

292
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,259
You did not have anything isn't it? - No.

293
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:02,439
Can't have salt, meat,
or fish am l cattle or something?

294
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,769
lf you eat salt you will be affected.

295
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:06,944
Oh, God.

296
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,281
You are doing as though you are
applying varnish on me.

297
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,448
Don't apply anything in unwanted place..
..and do some experiments.

298
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:24,118
After this experiment, what can l
do with this body sir?

299
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,123
Even otherwise what will you do with it.

300
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,960
l see. l am lying here now.

301
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:34,298
Before coming here l was fair like you.

302
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,475
Then people called me, Romeo.

303
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,472
You applied so many solutions on my body..

304
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:45,147
..now the women say, you have changed.

305
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,476
All are fate.

306
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,313
What is he doing to him.

307
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,485
Hey, don't tickle me like that.
- Don't shake.

308
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,160
Ok, apply.

309
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:21,345
lf l had lied down on the streets like this,
l would have made some money.

310
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,180
How long should l lie like this?

311
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:24,351
Till the experiment is over.

312
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,183
With that l too will be finished.

313
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,699
Who is that?

314
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,867
lt is me Devadas.

315
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,195
Oh, God, have the angels arrived now?

316
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,864
Go away, hiding and looking?

317
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,868
Cool down Damodhara, a small boy. Go. Go.

318
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,543
l will go and..

319
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,405
What sister?

320
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:24,571
You haven't slept till now? Go to sleep.

321
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,450
What is it, a thieving look?

322
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,923
Sister, what is the meaning of human body..
..becoming transparent?

323
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:40,257
When light passes through the body
it becomes transparent.

324
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,262
Then do we become invisible, sister?

325
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,934
When light is not reflected from a body
it will be invisible.

326
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,107
ls it possible that way, sister.

327
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,434
May be so.

328
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,941
When do l become invisible?

329
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,285
What happened? - Hey nothing.

330
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,127
How long you take.

331
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,455
lt will be long before you finish looks like.

332
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,628
Be quiet man.

333
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,629
This is not like making those kids beg..
..and make money.

334
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,631
This is mechanism. Mechanism.

335
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,976
Stop here.

336
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,985
Ramu, where did you see it?

337
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,815
There.

338
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,822
The shop where l usually go was closed.

339
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,153
Hence l came here.

340
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,829
lt was then l saw the piled up children

341
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,824
Are they going to take
these kids and rear them?

342
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,159
Come let us go and see.

343
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,168
You get up.

344
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,497
Sir the child is hungry, at least give some water.

345
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,831
Yes l will give treat.

346
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,338
You came to beg or
came for an excursion?

347
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,169
Now l will..

348
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,672
Stop. Aren't you ashamed to make these kids
beg and eat in that money?

349
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,179
Don't you have an humanity?

350
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,683
Who are you to ask all that?

351
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,353
Who are you to ask that?

352
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,859
Don't frighten us. He is a tiger.

353
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,187
lf you touch us, you will know.

354
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,696
All children get down.

355
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,201
Now we will all have something to eat
and then see what next?

356
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,203
Who are you?

357
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,537
You stand there. You will defy us?

358
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,881
Your bravery is against women?

359
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,886
Tell the truth, where are you taking them?

360
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,217
Taking them to pray at Sabari Malai.

361
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,892
See it is written there.

362
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,886
No it is all lie.

363
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,898
These people take these poor kids
and make them beg.

364
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,569
You too will have to explain.

365
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,566
This woman too is from...an orphanage.
We have a license for it.

366
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,740
Don't believe them.
lt is a betrayal.

367
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,742
Many such orphanages are there in Kerala.

368
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,579
All that is only front sir.

369
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,744
What happens there is all crimes.

370
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,978
And the people who do it
are big people in the society.

371
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,752
Sir, some how we have to save these kids.

372
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,480
Sir, shall l get them down?

373
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,919
Yes, get them down.

374
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,257
Get down.-Leave them.

375
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:32,928
Catch him.

376
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,770
l am Rajendra Babu, ACP.

377
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,666
Please take them away.

378
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,101
Come you rascal.

379
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,444
Come here

380
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,116
You take these people
and car in custody.-Yes sir.

381
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,282
What? What is the problem?

382
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,960
Sir, these are criminals who kidnap kids
and make them beg.

383
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,796
What foolishness are you saying?
This is Dandapani, l know him.

384
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,126
He is a social worker.

385
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,470
Do you know how many
orphanages he has....in Coimbatore?

386
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,798
And to such a man you
behave so badly?-Sir, that..

387
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,805
No, don't interfere in unnecessary things.

388
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,474
Before doing something,
you should have asked me.

389
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,477
Then what should we do to such criminals?

390
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,976
When the head is there the tail should not wag.
Understand?

391
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,820
Dandapani, you go.
- Thanks.

392
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,489
Sir, you are mistaken.- Shut up.

393
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,486
How are you scientist Sekar?

394
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,593
Good. Very good.

395
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,161
You are the original police officer.

396
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,332
l did not know that Kerala police
had such big criminals.

397
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,167
l think you are the best of them all.

398
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,338
Take your hand off me, Commissioner.

399
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:50,339
Take it off.

400
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,415
Not because l am afraid of you.

401
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:59,354
Hey, Sam brother, come soon.
l will also go with them. Save me.

402
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,525
Come running, and get me.

403
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,144
Good morning Chandakkadu.

404
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,072
Morning. Morning.
How long am l waiting?

405
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,311
Come. Let us go quickly.
-Wait, where to?

406
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,552
Should l tell you?-Then?

407
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,989
You called me early in the morning.
l have to go to work.

408
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,151
Hey, her being busy.

409
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,327
l said we are going to see the Collector..
..there too objection?

410
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:37,995
Collector?

411
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,430
Shocked?

412
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,664
Do you know who father Chandakkadu is?

413
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,002
The new district collector had come to see me.

414
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:45,999
To see you?

415
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,172
Then she called me to her office.

416
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,170
Stop your bloody arguments, Commissioner.

417
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:59,677
Sanmugam is a support to the mafia group
that kidnaps kids and force them to beg.

418
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,010
ls this how you do your official duty?

419
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,350
Hey, Madam is talking without knowing anything.

420
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,352
They did not take them to beg.

421
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:10,015
They were taking them to pray God lyappan..
..to Sabarimalai.

422
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,695
lt is what they said. lsn't it?
-Yes sir.

423
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,861
l heard some calling Sami lyappa.

424
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,030
ACP, it was you who went first there, isn't it?-Yes.

425
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,034
What do you think?

426
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,271
l too thought something was wrong.

427
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,132
Most of them were kids from Tamil Nadu.

428
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,208
Some kids were speaking in Telugu.

429
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,547
Commissioner said they were going to pray.

430
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,811
Aren't you ashamed to support the people who..

431
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:40,217
..make small kids beg
and live on that money, Shanmugam?

432
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,884
When there are many other
pressing issues, is it necessary..

433
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,230
..should we take up the beggar kids
and orphanages, madam?

434
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,058
Oh, l understand.
These kids are not leaders isn't it?

435
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,232
They don't have their names in voter's list.

436
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,733
Anything can be done to them, isn't it?

437
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:02,572
Our politicians are shamelessly
supporting such things.

438
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,238
You can shut your eyes on these things.
But l can't do so.

439
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:11,678
You must take immediate custody of people
who make kids beg. Within 24 hours.

440
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,523
That, now..er..

441
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,089
Yes, it is an order from the District Judge.

442
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,592
Yes, l will do that.

443
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,990
She gave them good, isn't it.

444
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,260
She seems to be a good lady.

445
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,434
So you reached here too.
-lsn't what you got enough?

446
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,574
Come, Father. Sit down.

447
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,850
You remember me well, isn't it?
You fired him well.

448
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,243
That Commissioner is a
stool pigeon of the ministers.

449
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,919
May be they are even now typing my transfer order.

450
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,616
This is the third district since l took charge.

451
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,121
You are Maya, isn't it?-Yes.

452
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,259
l have a request.
Love for orphans is only for those few kids?

453
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,860
You must work to save many like them.

454
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,200
There is an orphan committee in the district.
Maya, should be its Chair person.

455
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,712
What do you say?

456
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:14,206
What is there to think so much?
She is the correct person.

457
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,552
Then l will come to the orphanage, next Sunday.

458
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,554
We will talk about it in detail.
Today l am busy.

459
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,393
l had said about the other matter.

460
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,725
Yes, Maya's friend. Mr. Gauri. lsn't it?
-Yes

461
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:37,735
l had asked around. There are vested interests.
Hence it is prolonging.

462
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,400
Then we cannot do anything?

463
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:46,740
Let me see. As long as l am here.
l will do what l can for Maya. Will it do?

464
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:52,087
Then father l am getting late.
l have to attend a function at Hotel Asoka.

465
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,416
The minister has called.
lt is for the country isn't it?

466
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,586
When they call l have to go.
-What function at five star hotel?

467
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,931
lsn't it tomorrow they are signing the
contract with....the people from Dubai.

468
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,701
Then you can imagine
what function it will be.

469
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,941
Okay, We'll leave.

470
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:17,103
Can l speak to you personally, for a minute?
-Why not? Come.

471
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,687
What personal matter in this?

472
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:37,057
What madam,
what l said is being over smart?

473
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:43,134
No it is not so. ln fact for a girl like Maya..
..l am ready to take any risk.

474
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,469
But..-l know madam.

475
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,979
l did not see you as a district collector.

476
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,747
l like Maya's persuasion.

477
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,715
You want to tear open..
..these dacoit's masks isn't it?

478
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,979
Yes. lt is not only because my life was spoiled.

479
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,654
lf l can do something against such traitors..

480
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,657
..then won't this be a gratitude
l will show towards this society?

481
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,360
Without going round, understand what l say.

482
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,365
We are getting a commission of 1400 crores..
..from the Dubai people.

483
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,198
ln that we have taken 100 crores.
Balance 1300 crores.

484
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,438
l will give 1000 crores from that.

485
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:23,706
Then 300 crores in your pocket? That won't do.
-Why it won't do?

486
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,110
ls it for free that l got those Arabs
to agree for this trade?

487
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,321
Even other wise it is loss business.

488
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,392
When we gave that Laxmipuram place
to the white people..

489
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:38,061
What commission we got was Rs.50 crores.

490
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,564
This is 500 acres place, that they are taking.

491
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,727
lt is not property that our father earned isn't it?

492
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,801
Since you are in this chair,
you could get commission.

493
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,073
Why Yunus, then when you get
donations you see for more.

494
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,569
lt is notjust like that.

495
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,078
lf l have to come to power in the next election,
l have to play by putting in money.

496
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:05,422
Don't you know that in the last Panchayat ,&
Lok Sabha elections the front did very badly.

497
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:09,251
lf l get what l asked for,
then only l can do something.

498
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:14,428
Hence Naser, in that case of 300 crores
you have to do something.

499
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:24,870
Oh! Hey, l can't understand what they say
and they can't understand what l say.

500
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,376
You don't know even Malayalam,
well then only arabi.

501
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,177
Hey, it is not needed to know language to rule.

502
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,447
See now, when l saw their action l understood.
The matter is of women.

503
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,624
Me, l am a Revenue Minister here.
They want me to supply them women.

504
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,465
When they saw the face of our Collector..
..the Arabs fell silent.

505
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,967
We got her so that they will
see her and loosen up.

506
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,471
May l come in sir.

507
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,477
We were just talking about you.

508
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,543
What were you saying? ls it good?

509
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,650
Of course. You are smart.
You are first ranker in lAS.

510
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:13,083
From a good family..
..and also quite good looking. What is lacking?

511
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,219
Please sit down.-Thank you sir.

512
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,988
We are fortunate that we got you in Kerala.

513
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,323
Don't pamper me.

514

Get pampered. Get pampered as you please.
We don't have any complaints.

515
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,242
We have arranged all the programmes..
..along with the fashion show.

516
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,443
Anything else.

517
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:37,846
We don't see Anita as only a collector..
..but also a friend.

518
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:45,113
We are going make you our business partner.
-No l don't want all that.

519
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:50,522
Dear, if you come with us
we will make you a Chief Secretary.

Room service sir.- Come soon and keep it.

523
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,537
Shall l call for an ice cream for you?

524
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:13,445
No. l will have juice. That is all.
-l will serve it.

525
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,393
Women are like that.

526
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,565
You understand things quickly.

527
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:52,919
What happened Madam.

528
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:59,525
This will be a small spark
which will make a big blast. lsn't it?

529
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,995
Oh, my God.

530
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,685
What? Other languages.
What did he say?

531
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,384
He said that he has done business
travelling to many nations

532
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,561
but he has never found
such greedy ministers.

533
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,344
Congratulation. You are a great reporter.

534
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,222
Now we are going to become world famous.
Tehelka, is nothing in front of us.

535
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:05,293
As this news bulletin goes on,

536
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,629
Our news channel is going to
become the no.1 channel in the world.

537
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,030
As New lndia Managing Director,
l am going to become world famous.

538
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,966
Thank you Mayamma. Thank you.
-Hey, leave her.

539
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,298
Hey, What are you doing?

540
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,969
Sorry. Due to happiness
l did not know what l did.

541
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,145
And for that you embrace women openly?

542
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:26,976
Go man. Are you a news reporter?
Maya, is the real reporter. Learn from her.

543
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,146
Tell me what l should do?

544
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,980
You have to give this
news to the news bulletin.

545
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,985
Yes, we should give it immediately
We shouldn't keep it for long with us.

546
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,887
Yet, since it involves big people,
it is better to consult directors.

547
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:42,657
Correct. They also should take responsibility.

548
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,595
Urgently we are calling up a
director's meeting....tonight itself.

549
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,336
The new goes in the first bulletin..
..in the morning tomorrow.

550
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,636
Give that memory card too.

551
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,372
Let it be with me.

552
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,978
Till the people know this..
Let this be with me.

553
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:31,309
She said, she will be ready
and now not even got up.

554
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,280
Who is that?

555
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,728
Oh, God who left it here.

556
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,636
Now the whole world will say
Maya got one more kid.

557
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,731
l'm coming.
-Come soon.

558
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,237
Where did you get this kid?
-l just gave birth to it in the morning.

559
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:01,411
Don'tjoke.

560
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,579
l get it there.

561
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,581
lf you keep a cradle on your doorstep
orphan children will come in queue to join you.

562
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:11,516
Looks older than a new born.
-Maybe, you are the children specialist.

563
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:17,417
Oh, God. l just dreamt that
you and Maya got married.

564
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:18,921
And now you have a kid so soon.

565
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,255
lt was a quick delivery.

566
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,562
Was it a scissarian?
-lt came from the sky.

567
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,099
Oh! lt happens that way too?- Go man.

568
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,097
Here if it continues like this our children
..will have nothing.

569
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:34,266
Don't worry, our children and these children..
..will grow all together.

570
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,943
lt is a beautiful child.
-Then take it.

571
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,946
How they feel like keeping such a child?

572
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,450
There will be a grand story behind this child.

573
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,455
You will get sensational

574
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,285
Story? What story?

575
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,962
A story is about to be made.

576
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,152
Tell us, where is your child?
-l don't know.

577
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,759
You don't know.

578
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,230
See.

579
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:32,895
A big man like Yunus fell for you.
You should have considered it fortunate.

580
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,071
You should have taken some money and gone.

581
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,340
Why did you come back here?
To blackmail him?

582
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:44,077
Her pretending to cry
She is a thief.

583
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,249
You better tell where your child is?

584
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,917
l told you l don't know.

585
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,314
Johnny.

586
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,656
She should live to tell
that the child is Yunus's.

587
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,358
We don't want that.

588
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,928
Tell us. lf you don't l will kill you.

589
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:06,091
l won't tell. You will kill my child too.

590
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,602
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.

591
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:20,950
Tell us.

592
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,699
Bloody rascal. Taking snaps?
- My camera.

593
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,812
Don't leave this fellow.
He will reveal everything.

594
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:06,659
Sir. l am not...

595
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:07,993
Untie him.

596
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,429
We heard a noise and came.
By then it was over.

597
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,660
Who are you all?
-We are her neighbours.

598
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,339
He was trying to escape.
We caught him and tied him up. and called you.

599
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,834
You come here.-Sir, l did not do.

600
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,604
They did it and now they are lying.
l saw with my own eyes.

601
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,338
l saw him coming here.-No...

602
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,848
Sir, this woman wanted to marry him,
that is why he killed her.

603
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,020
Don't believe them.
l don't even know this woman.

604
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,690
Whether you know or not,
we will find out in the station.

605
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,690
Get in the jeep.
-Sir, you must believe me.

606
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,294
l am a reporter from....Malayala Bhoomi.

607
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:43,958
You did a crime and now defend it.

608
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,363
Did you think a reporter from Malayala Bhoomi

609
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,038
Commits a murder did you think the
police will kiss you? Get in the jeep.

610
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:59,213
Don't. Don't do anything.
Don't remind me.

611
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,541
You must think.
You must remember everything.

612
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,216
Only then you will be stubborn.

613
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,215
Shouldn't you pay back what they gave you?

614
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,058
Only on this they can get you.

615
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:18,629
l have a bomb to put them inside for 3 1/2 years..
..without any enquiry.

616
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,427
Bomb.?...

617
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,900
Yes. That is now in my cell phone.

618
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,735
What ever you do, even if God comes..
..He can't do anything.

619
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,735
That we will wait and see.

620
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:34,510
l have a request to you.
Just for me you don't risk your life.

621
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:45,484
Joe has not understood me isn't it?
Do l have a life without you?

622
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,929
We will live together. We will live grandly.
You will see.

623
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:39,181
My beloved, is the portion of love
bestowed by your lips?

624
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:47,152
She-bird, you please come with
freshness in your heart.

625
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:55,490
O, Night-Bird, please come to swim
in the river where joy flows

626
00:48:56,033 --> 00:49:02,666
My beloved, is the portion of
love bestowed by your lips?

627
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:36,203
Through the dreams come the aroma
emanating from the heart, that is you...

628
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:43,879
Twilight- girl, please steal my heart
like my dearest does.

629
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:08,064
When the wick-lamp burning in the heart
turns into a fire-ball of love,

630
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:14,570
O Beautiful-flower, l saw the dreams
emanating in your eyes

631
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:23,083
My darling, my lips have the portion of love!

632
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,241
ln your eyes - the spring of beauty

633
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,917
ln your words - the sweet offerings

634
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:04,086
My companion, you please come like a beautiful,
lustful woman does.

635
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:11,934
Night-Birds wake up, when the lusty tunes
reach a crescendo,

636
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:18,430
O Celestial woman, you become the passion
and compassion of my mind.

637
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:26,276
My beloved, is the portion of
love bestowed by your lips?

638
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:35,114
She-bird, you please come with
freshness in your heart

639
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:42,629
O, Night-Bird, please come to swim
in the river where joy flows

640
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,318
Why is he insisting on white rabbit?

641
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,255
Sir, said that if it is a
white rabbit it will disappear.

642
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:48,295
Even if a human he should be white only then
he will be invisible, is his finding?

643
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,092
What is invisible?
- lt means disappearing.

644
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,428
What?- Disappearing. Walk along.

645
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,269
Oh, God Mookambike.

646
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,109
l have prayed that l will break
101 coconuts to Lord Ganesha.

647
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,712
Will the wonder happen sir?

648
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,775
Yes it could be a historical wonder.
Or it could be a historical blunder.

649
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,887
l will try my best.

650
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,306
Put him there.

651
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:06,336
Yes. lt is a success.
We have don't it.

652
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:07,504
God.

653
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,176
Oh, God thank you. Thank you.

654
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,508
Damodaran, l am very happy.
We have done it.

655
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,848
We will reappear again?
Surely. ln one hour it will appear again.

656
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,017
Just in one hour.

657
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,031
How are you my dear friend?

658
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,269
With whom are talking?- With the rabbit.

659
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,807
He is in there.

660
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,217
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
-Careful. Don't drop.

661
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,550
Devan is not come yet, Samy?

662
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:01,227
Oh, he must be there somewhere near that..
..scientist's lab.

663
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,556
After coming from school, he keeps the bag..

664
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,496
..here and runs straight to that place

665
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,009
lt is going to be one hour.

666
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,083
Thank you.- There it is.

667
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,686
Oh, my Lord Ganesha.
As the sir said a wonder took place.

668
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,526
Now sir, will be a great man.

669
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,265
l am still the same
scientist Shekar. Any doubts?

670
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,763
No doubts sir.

671
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,430
Sir shall l ask you one thing?

672
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:47,438
lf the invisible souls don't like this finding.

673
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,542
we have to be careful of that.

674
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,609
We should make...Sudarsana Yaga.

675
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,111
Yes. All the Gods helped us.
We must surely do that.

676
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:58,784
But to see this happiness
my Sethu Laxmi is not there.

677
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,624
l was just talking about her
and my daughter is calling me.

678
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,127
Hi Sunita.

679
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,892

685
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,749
My Sunita met with an accident.

00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,991
l have to go immediately
to the airport, Damodara.

687
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,823
Hey, she is very dear to him.

688
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,807
Yes, Madam.

Thank you madam.
Good night. Who is it?

691
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:17,154
l came here a week before.
l talked with Father Thomas.

692
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,164
Father told about Maya.

693
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,497
When we heard that you
take children from the streets..

694
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,674
and give them life, we liked it a lot.

695
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,840
When my wife Jansi,
was thrilled to hear about you.

696
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,014
She too is a Social worker like you.

697
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,516
Why did you come now?

698
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:37,516
Jansi, has sent you a gift.
-Thank you.

699
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,682
Jansi wanted to speak to you.

700
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,685
l will ring her, please talk to her.
-Yes, l will.

701
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:53,195
My battery is down. Can you give that mobile?
Shall l call her?-Sure. Take it.

702
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,047
Smart. l admire you.

703
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:11,049
Let this be with me. Okay.

704
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,220
Oh sister maya!

705
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,224
Hey, give it me.

706
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,733
Hey, the man is beating our sister.

707
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:29,762
You all stand aside kids.

708
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,310
You give that here.

709
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,209
l won't leave you. Give it here.

710
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,167
Sister Maya.

711
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,609
Oh, Chingini.

712
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:23,456
Chingini, dear.
Chingini, dear. Chingini, dear.

713
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,287
She is hurt.
-Let us take her to the hospital.

714
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,643
How is she Doctor?

715
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,471
She is Ok.
Since she fell on face she got saved.

716
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:50,642
Sister, Maya. Sister, Maya. Sister, Maya.

717
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,651
Since last night, even now
and then she calls Maya.

718
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,824
At this time if she was there,
it would be better.

719
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,488
We could not find till now where Maya, is.

720
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:10,333
Seeing the condition of child, you
have to find Maya....very quickly.

721
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,836
Those goons are the
ministers people it is true.

722
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,111
l have seen them too.

723
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:23,007
Can you raid their place?

724
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,020
As per Madam's instructions
we are thinking of that.

725
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,086
But.

726
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,849
Without any proof,
we cannot raid his house, Father

727
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,022
Even if the home minister
wishes, he can't do it.

728
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,791
There is no clear proof isn't it?

729
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,403
Then you can't rescue my Maya, isn't it?

730
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:14,068
Only Maya is there for us,
who have no one else.

731
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,068
lyappa, give me
strength to rescue her.

732
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,659
No one believed when l said that
rabbit disappeared..

733
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,955
..not due to that medicine,
but because of the ghost.

734
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,256
Now what happened?

735
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,262
Sekar's daughter
met with an accident.

736
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,263
Some goons took away
the girl from next door.

737
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,105
Dear Thangappa,
the ghost has only started now.

738
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,605
These ghosts are white?

739
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:58,440
Ordinary ghosts, drink on Fridays,
sing and do things.

740
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,775
Now since this is foreign ghosts,
it won't sing..

741
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,781
..Malayalam song,
it can only sing English songs.

742
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:22,161
Now you hear its English song.

743
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,263
That is Dracula song. Hear it now.

744
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:02,661
Uncle. Uncle. Einstein Uncle.

745
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,496
Who is it?

746
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,736
Oh, a Ghost.

747
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:09,773
What happened here.

748
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,603
lt is a wonder. The cycle going by itself.

749
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,598
No one touch it. lt is bewitched.

750
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,938
ls this the house of the Minister?

751
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:22,576
Who is calling, can't see any one.

752
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,409
We can say many good things.
But to live we need, money.

753
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,247
Now you yourself, put in lakhs of rupees
and became an MLA and Ministers.

754
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,915
When l thought all that
would go in a news of one minute..

755
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,094
..l could not bear it.

756
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:44,595
Not only that, corruption is part of..
..Governing isn't it, today?

757
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,928
Atrocities and corruption
are two faces of a coin.

758
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,935
One cannot exist without the other.

759
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:55,777
Oh, we agree. lt is all very true.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

760
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,946
More that Thank you l need money.

761
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,947
l came away from the channel and my Maya..

762
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,778
..l rescued your lives.

763
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,956
lf l could get my money, l could leave.

764
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:12,689
Here, there is 5 lakhs in this.

765
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:13,860
For now keep it.

766
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:18,966
What is this? Of 1400 crores,
even 10% will come to....140 crores.

767
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,963
You all know if l wasn't there you
all would be....behind bars.

768
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,140
l have to get at least 14 crores.

769
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,642
You are good.

770
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:32,807
Hey, don't worry now.
We will do anything you want later.

771
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:36,640
lf needed we may even
set up a channel for you.

772
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,251
For the present take this and go.

773
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,489
Ok. But the balance..

774
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:42,816
What happened?

775
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,986
l lost the balance of the chair.

776
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,321
Or you lost your balance
when you saw 5 lakhs?

777
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,727
No sir, as long as l get money
my balance will increase.

778
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,997
Hey, what are you doing falling on us?

779
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,500
When you got money
you are off your rocker. -Yes

780
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,667
Are you gone mad.
-No, l am getting tickled.

781
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,650
Now you go, Kosi. We will see later.

782
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,357
Now it stopped. Ok l am leaving.

783
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:20,689
Though he is mad. He did a favour to us.

784
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,198
lsn't because of that we left him
without beating him.

785
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,862
Here come the demons.
-What did you get the card.

786
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,128
We did not get any card.
She says she does not have it.

787
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,202
Then you said you saw it.

788
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,373
Yes, l saw it.

789
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,769
l took her cell and saw the clippings too.

790
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,705
Yunus, and you are
taking money from the Sheiks.

791
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,379
We saw that very clearly.

792
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,707
Then where has it gone?

793
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,616
Now has she taken it?

794
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,115
Now we can'tjust leave her like that. Come.

795
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,388
Come, demons

796
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:52,925
Don't push...

797
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,562
Who?

798
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,405
Tell us where your cell's memory card?

799
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:08,739
l don't know.

800
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:14,246
See now if you talk as though
you talk in front of TV..

801
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,419
..we will cut you and
make Biriyani in a cooker.

802
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:21,187
You better tell quickly,
where have you kept the memory card.

803
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:22,516
l said l don't know.

804
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,089
You better let me go from here.

805
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:30,926
Hey my dear girl, don't get angry.
What a good body you have.

806
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,261
Without making any problem,
give him the memory card.

807
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,529
Or they will do bad things to you.

808
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:42,607
When we talk nicely she shows
the journalism tricks.

809
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:48,475
She is going to give in.
we will stab her and kill her.

810
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,619
Yes, cut me up and eat me.
There is a child of your blood too.

811
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,787
The taste will increase.

812
01:09:56,725 --> 01:10:01,560
You killed a poor woman isn't it?
l am rearing her child.

813
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:07,626
Do what you want.
l won't give in to human demons like you.

814
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,469
lf l am alive l will bring you before the law.

815
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,801
Search her body. The card will be somewhere.

816
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,308
Come here.

817
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,648
Let me search. - No.

818
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,732
Oh! Blood.

819
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,299
Why did you stab me, sir?

820
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,598
Hey l did not do that.

821
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,812
Just when l went to catch her,
l was poked in my behind,

822
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,883
Hey what are you saying?
- My mother.

823
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,707
Don't beat me, l am Minister.

824
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:33,081
Oh, my Goddess, protect me.

825
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:38,415
Did you see. How the ghost stopped?

826
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,428
l think a genie is with her.

827
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,393
No sir, it is not a genie.

828
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,066
lt is a small Satan
Or else it is a stick ghost.

829
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:50,896
Oh my Goddess,
who is showing this wonder?

830
01:11:55,778 --> 01:12:05,619
Wonder boy.

831
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:15,621
Sister Maya.

832
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:17,895
Who is it?

833
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:23,568
Sister Maya.- Oh my god.

834
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:30,934
Who is it? lt is my Devan's voice.
- lt is me, sister Maya.

835
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,705
Maya sister.- Oh who is it?

836
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,441
l'm your Devan

837
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:44,052
l cannot see you dear,
did anything happen to you?

838
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:48,093
l did not come as ghost.
l am invisible.

839
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,766
Hey, l cannot see him.
- Why is he so late?

840
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,633
Hey, why are you so tensed?
Samy will come now.

841
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:02,101
He is a very capable man.

842
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,541
You have heard that they
make a fried chicken fly.

843
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,441
lt is his type.

844
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:10,516
Will he tell things outside.
- Hey, he is not like that.

845
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,883
You see. Once he sees he will get her.

846
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,685
Yes he will do. lf only he doesn't
come to my stage he is in luck.

847
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:23,963
You should not have done this for me.

848
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,394
What if anything happens to you.
What will l do?

849
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,266
Nothing will happen to me.

850
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:38,037
l saw that rabbit become invisible..
...and re-appear again.

851
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,780
Nothing is wrong with Chingini, isn't it?

852
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,816
Doctor said nothing is wrong.

853
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:49,820
But she is crying to see you. You come.

854
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:51,856
We will escape from here.

855
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,789
They are all outside, son.
And they have locked it from out.

856
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,258
Then what will we do?

857
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,864
Only 10 minutes are there.
Then l will be visible again.

858
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:01,331
Before that, take this and try to escape from here.

859
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,268
Look, even if l am here, it doesn't matter.

860
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,243
You must take this and give it to
Radha Ramanan. Sir.

861
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,711
What is this Maya?

862
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,544
This is my cell phone's memory card.

863
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,653
lf some how you reach this in sir's hands..
..my work will be done.

864
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,950
Ok. l will do it.

865
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:43,169
Did you not hear?
A ghost is hiding in her.

866
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,744
You cannot say when
it will start its mischief.

867
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,349
Swamy, first you must get control of her..
..and make her stand still.

868
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:56,081
Then from her body..
...l want to get that thing from her.

869
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,486
What is it's name?
- Memory card.

870
01:14:58,694 --> 01:14:59,388
Yes, memory card.

871
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,095
Tell the truth, who are you?

872
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,796
Stick ghost, Chamundi, or the small Satan?

873
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,298
She poked me with an iron rod in my behind.

874
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,837
You must give her good beating, magic man.

875
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,142
She did that again to me.

876
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,346
You got that place only to do that?

877
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:28,418
Om hreem badrakali namaha.
Who are you?

878
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,355
Or else you will see the fury
of this Barghavan. Tell me.

879
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,257
You better go from here.
You want to see my power?

880
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,693
Now you will become ash. Om hreem..

881
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,609
Beat her. Beat her. Beat her.

882
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,281
Ah! Beat

883
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:10,189
Oh, mother.

884
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,064
Don't hit me

885
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:25,074
Samy, what happened? Get up.

886
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,249
She is not ordinary. l was poked on that part.

887
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,344
Please take me to the hospital.
- Samy.

888
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:34,754
Why did she tell me to take this thing?

889
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:44,126
Oh, l too am attached by ghost. Hey.

890
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,103
Will l be able to get it in time.
Will l become visible again?

891
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,938
This is something even God won't tolerate. Oh!

892
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:59,375
Please come running. lt has my hand.

893
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:00,843
There is only one minute now.

894
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:05,645
Do l have only one minute to live?
Oh! Save me.

895
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:10,415
Who opened the door. Oh...

896
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:08,879
Oh no

897
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,419
Hey...Did a bomb fall here?

898
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,089
lt is not a bomb. A ghost has entered the lab.

899
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:17,885
The door is open.

900
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,323
Should l open? - lt is open.

901
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,759
God. The Nobel prize is gone.

902
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,561
Something else too may have broken.
Get in and see.

903
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:36,299
l am afraid. lf l go in the ghosts
will beat me. You see. Go.

904
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:40,415
Yes. We can't see them isn't it?
You go and see.

905
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:45,882
They can see me. You go.
- You go. Oh! You go.

906
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:54,756
You go. You go.
- l can't move. lt is holding my legs.

907
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,572
First go and get a magician.
- lf l phone it won't do?

908
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:10,904
Go and get him.

909
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,405
Mother.

910
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,315
Thangappa.

911
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,146
Thangappa. lt is calling you. Go.

912
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:27,488
lt is calling you too.

913
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:31,257
You open the door. Or l will get you.

914
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:38,935
You open the door.

915
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:52,684
You hold it.- lt won't do anything.

916
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:55,823
l said hold this.- l held it.

917
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,052
Hey, my mother.

918
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,958
Will that memory card be somewhere outside?

919
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:06,293
Then even if l have to cut her
this Naser will get it.

920
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,664
lf you just say so,
l will do the cutting.

921
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,498
Then you go. You have a meeting isn't it?

922
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:14,470
l think my minister's post will go.

923
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,840
l think she must have given to some one.

924
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:21,978
You go. l want see her properly.

925
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:25,312
Yes, go and see. Let the car go.

926
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,212
You give the key,

927
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:41,665
Hey what is this? lt is not me.

928
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:55,174
The ghost seems to be active again.
- There you see.

929
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:12,761
Maya, that villain was coming
here to trouble you.

930
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,401
l beat him and came.

931
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,537
You took that medicine again
and had it, isn't it?

932
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:19,605
Yes. l drank. l drank twice that amount.

933
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:21,537
Now l will be invisible for 2 hours.

934
01:21:21,743 --> 01:21:26,612
Did you give that memory card to Radha Ramanan?
- That fell down, Maya.

935
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,545
Hey, where? Where is it now?

936
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,584
l know where it is now.
You come with me.

937
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,813
Come out, Maya.

938
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:39,052
lf you further stay here..
..they will come kill, Maya. Come.

939
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:00,280
Raziya. Dear.- Oh my god.

940
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:01,747
Come there and hide.

941
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,747
Raziya. Dear. Raziya. Dear.

942
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,721
You are not yet ready?

943
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,395
Where has she gone?
The dress is here. Dear.

944
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:21,331
Just wait 10 minutes.
l will just take a bath and come.

945
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,370
Calling on the phone even in the bathroom?

946
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,008
lt is long back they are all ready.
- ls father ready?

947
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,440
The ghost that came yesterday
came again today.

948
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,774
lt seems it threw stones on dad.
- l want to see that scene.

949
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:40,182
Can we do that. They will hunt us out.

950
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:41,955
Go get ready soon.

951
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,354
We have nothing to do.
Let us go and be back.

952
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:46,653
Ugh.

953
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,694
The ghost has come here too? Oh, mother.

954
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,562
Where is it?- l will show where it is?

955
01:22:58,707 --> 01:22:59,298
Where is it?

956
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,269
There is it.

957
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,304
So Raziya has come here and standing?

958
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:07,174
Hey dear, it is getting late.
- lt may get lost.

959
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:11,115
Hey, it is late. What are you looking?
Come on.

960
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,376
Come let us go and come.

961
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:18,685
Maya. You go. l will go get that
memory card and come.

962
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,528
Noone will indentify you

963
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,200
What are you bending and seeing,
come soon.

964
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:42,343
Come dear.

965
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:48,851
You are inside me.
lf l close my eyes it is you.

966
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:55,189
Where ever l see, it is you.
lt is always you l think of.

967
01:23:55,397 --> 01:24:00,562
You, my love.

968
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:05,303
Hey the tub went up.

969
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,210
Hey who is it?

970
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:21,288
lt is that ghost again Naser sir.
lt is attacking me. Please save me.

971
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,245
Good you are here.
Come let us go.

972
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,744
Hey leave me, l am not that type.

973
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,576
l am an MD of a news channel.
Radha Ramanan. Sir, it is me.

974
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,615
lf other channel people see me,

975
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,084
the people will see me..
..on TV and be shocked.

976
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,916
My channel will be finished.
Leave me. Leave me.

977
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,955
Hey it is me, Maya.

978
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,258
How is Maya here? ln this get up?

979
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,293
l will tell you everything,
you get in let us go.

980
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,769
l swear on God, if you see her in Burka,
she looks just like her.

981
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,703
Don't talk. She is a demon who
came to drink our blood.

982
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:17,343
She is a hardcore criminal. Criminal.

983
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:20,275
Now keeping her any more in
this land is danger for us.

984
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:23,280
l have found a way for it.
You all go from here.

985
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:24,579
Come.

986
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:33,386
Oh! What an intolerable pain.
Curse that ghost.

987
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:40,291
Hey, Jamal. Your side walking
is not over yet?

988
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,994
You have seen that think poking my behind.

989
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:48,301
Now l don't know what l have to
go through. - Very difficult.

990
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,068
The person who Naser said has come.

991
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:51,036
Where is he?

992
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,341
Assalam, alaikum.
- Walaikum assalam.

993
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:57,307
Whe Jamal said that you have come
from Dubai....then l got to know.

994
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,544
Mr. lbrahim had given an important work.

995
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:00,914
l have finished the job.

996
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:04,023
l am going back by tomorrow's flight.
- Don't.

997
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,857
You go after two days.

998
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:09,396
Jamal, will show you a girl
who is a danger to us.

999
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:13,262
Within 24 hours l want to see her dead body.

1000
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:14,994
You are the correct man to do it.

1001
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,605
Some how you got saved.

1002
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:24,543
l have prayed that you should not
fall in any more trouble.

1003
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:29,280
Because my dear, Maya is a very good girl.

1004
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,017
Did, Father, see Chingini?

1005
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:35,315
Did l see? l have taken care of
the children just like you.

1006
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,024
Some how that Chingini, got saved.

1007
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,523
Then come let us go to my house.

1008
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,059
No, don't go. ln your house
and father's orphanage..

1009
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:44,731
..Naser's men will be keeping an eye.

1010
01:26:44,966 --> 01:26:46,695
We have to inform Anita of all this.

1011
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,926
Only if she helps us, we can do something.

1012
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,904
Just as he said, l fear that in
their anger for you..

1013
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:55,007
..they may do something to the kids.

1014
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,808
Due to fear, l can't even sleep.

1015
01:26:58,246 --> 01:26:59,907
Let me go there.

1016
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:01,715
Then l will go.- Ok.

1017
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,915
Good night father.- Good night.

1018
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,890
That you did not tell about Devan,
it was good.

1019
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,857
Two hours are over. He would
have become visible.

1020
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:18,196
Yet l did not tell Father,
due to fear.

1021
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,230
Now if he knows then..

1022
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:26,235
Now if Father had insisted to see him
l would have been in soup.

1023
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:29,201
Maya, stay here.

1024
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,072
l will make gruel, some cereals..
..and some crispies and get them.

1025
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,043
Are there no servants here?

1026
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,682
lt is my fortune that the servant
went home today.

1027
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:39,176
Don't be afraid.

1028
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:44,017
For long l had wished to speak
to Maya all alone.

1029
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,587
ln that office that Kosi always is behind me.

1030
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:50,457
ln your house the kids.

1031
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,962
lt is by God's grace
l got you alone this night.

1032
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,902
What are you saying sir?

1033
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:02,740
Since the day l saw you..
..l had thought many times.

1034
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:05,378
But l did not get an opportunity.

1035
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,612
What is it sir?

1036
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:10,276
lf you know the depth of my love for you..
..Maya will be shocked.

1037
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,079
You love me so much?

1038
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,113
Does Maya doubt that?

1039
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:17,925
lf you love me so much will
you do anything l want?

1040
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,786
Will l do it? Even if l lose
my head l will do it.

1041
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,760
Then get my Roy, out on bail.
Will you help me?

1042
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:28,964
Roy? Then you two are still in love?

1043
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,195
Not only now. But always.

1044
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:34,906
lt must be Devan.

1045
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,638
Then at least l will get that memory card.

1046
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:43,340
l am shocked. At least l can give
the people a shocking news.

1047
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,054
Devan.

1048
01:28:57,398 --> 01:29:00,424
Who is it?- What is it?

1049
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:03,426
He is here somewhere,
but l think he is still invisible.

1050
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:06,105
Devan. Son.

1051
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:07,204
Hey.

1052
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,476
Sorry Uncle.

1053
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:18,109
Maya sister. Don't be angry with me.

1054
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:21,116
l did not get the memory card.
- You did not get it?

1055
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:27,756
Why have you not become visible again.
- l don't know.

1056
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:34,225
You will never be able to see me?
- Don't say like that.

1057
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:38,403
May be this is because you drank a lot of it.

1058
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:42,068
God, what we can do now?

1059
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:43,470
Don't cry.

1060
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:46,146
May after some time he will be visible again.

1061
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:50,745
Or else we will go to scientist Sekar's lab
and ask....when he will come?

1062
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:55,011
For a help we will take Kosi, too.
- No. He is the cause of all this.

1063
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,291
What sir, without any information?

1064
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,395
Should l give 7 days notice to
come to your place?

1065
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,724
Greetings. How are things here?

1066
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:07,423
You have a long life.
We were just talking about you.

1067
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:08,727
About me? What is it?

1068
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,131
lt is 3, 4 months since he got salary.

1069
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,302
l am giving. Doesn't he give?

1070
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:17,235
Giving? You are going to close
the channel l heard. ls it true?

1071
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,310
Hey don't talk like that
early in the morning.

1072
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,539
She talks like that. You come inside.

1073
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,274
Come with me.

1074
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,619
Sit sir.- Ok.

1075
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,658
Hey, Kosi, though you don't get salary..

1076
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,351
..your father-in-law has plenty
of money isn't it?

1077
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,561
l came to ask you something.

1078
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:41,400
You must give Rs.25000 and help me.
l need it very urgently.

1079
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,170
Sir, don't talk like this sir.

1080
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:46,533
We are living with my father's money

1081
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:50,677
And in such a state if you ask
for Rs.25000 loan then how?

1082
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,539
Don't talk like that to avoid.

1083
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:54,772
l can ask only people..
..who have something.

1084
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:56,449
lf you want you can give.

1085
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:59,119
Will Kosi, lie having money?

1086
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,483
lf l gather everything then
l can give some Rs.3000.

1087
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,023
Then so be it. Rs.3000.
lt is so urgent. Give that.

1088
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:07,023
Shall l give?

1089
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:08,860
Like sir.. Hey.

1090
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:11,494
What happened?

1091
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,932
Every now and then l lose my balance.
Since yesterday.

1092
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,569
l told you to see a doctor.

1093
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,172
lf l fall again, l will see one. Come.

1094
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:26,275
Deva, you tripped him isn't it?

1095
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,145
Go with him. Go with him.

1096
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,679
Looks like he knows that
l have money, Susie.

1097
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:37,084
You must take back
along with interest. l say.

1098
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,885
Then what?
How l struggled to make this money.

1099
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:44,190
God, if the minister betrays me.

1100
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:53,739
Hey, the bag is full of money.

1101
01:31:54,609 --> 01:32:00,741
3-4-5-6. here.
-Only kind people help like this.

1102
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:03,007
l just understood your kind heart.

1103
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:07,551
Not like that, l am always like that,
isn't it, Susie?- Yes.

1104
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:10,881
Then shall l leave, Kosi?
- Ok.

1105
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:14,852
l will never forget this help. l am grateful.

1106
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:16,689
Shall l leave, Susamma?
- Okay.

1107
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:17,660
Poor fellow.

1108
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:27,202
3000 was a little more.

1109
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:29,569
l should have given only 2000.

1110
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:32,337
They came to ask for money. Hey.

1111
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:33,941
The cup-board is open.

1112
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:37,308
Susie. Susie. Susie.- What.

1113
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:39,281
My money is gone. Who took my money?

1114
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:40,249
That Radha Ramanan.
Has he taken it away?

1115
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:44,117
He did not come inside at all.
This is done by robbers.

1116
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:45,724
Then right now call the police.

1117
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,724
lf the police asks from where
you got this much money..

1118
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:48,861
..then what will you say?

1119
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:51,762
My money.

1120
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:58,703
Thanks for the money, Athisayan.

1121
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,733
What wonder am l hearing?

1122
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:05,572
He became invisible drinking medicine.

1123
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:09,576
Yes Madam, l am telling true.

1124
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:12,576
l have touched him and seen.

1125
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:14,983
He is having a high fever.

1126
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:17,281
l am getting afraid what will happen to him?

1127
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,822
l can't even call a doctor and show.

1128
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,721
l don't know what to do.

1129
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:28,699
Madam some how try and contact
Scientist Sekar. Please.

1130
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:32,231
lf you try he may be able to
direct from US itself.

1131
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,868
You can get his number. l tried to
contact you, but couldn't.

1132
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,339
l was not here.

1133
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,146
Maya, don't worry. l will try.

1134
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:48,786
Maya sister. l am very weak Maya.

1135
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:57,421
Maya. Water. Water.
- Dear. Here take water.

1136
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:03,835
Hey it is my nose. Down here.

1137
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:21,647
You lie down. Your fever will increase.

1138
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:31,088
Maya. l want to see, chingini
and the other kids.

1139
01:34:31,966 --> 01:34:33,490
They will all come now, dear.

1140
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,859
Radha Ramanan has gone to get them.

1141
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:40,039
lf they come they won't be able
to see me, Maya.

1142
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:44,539
They will kiss me.

1143
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,015
Will l die Maya?

1144
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:56,552
lf l die, then you can't see
me at all isn't it?

1145
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:01,089
Don't say such things.
Nothing happened to you.

1146
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,291
Where is our Devan.

1147
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:04,964
He is inside. Come l will show you.

1148
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:10,997
My dear Chingini. - Maya sister.

1149
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:13,632
How are you all?

1150
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:18,503
l am alright now. l want to see, Devan.

1151
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:20,040
Come...

1152
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,180
Come let us go see him.

1153
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:34,688
Did every one come, Maya?
- Yes, dear.

1154
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:39,061
Where is my brother, Devan?

1155
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:42,297
He is here.- Brother.

1156
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,127
Yes. Where were you, chingini?

1157
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:50,465
Hey l am not able to see you.
- l am lying down here.

1158
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:52,535
Devan...

1159
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,810
Hey, Maya why can't we see, Devan?

1160
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,287
Where is he? Devan.

1161
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:06,487
Devan.
- What Appu?

1162
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:10,629
Enough of hiding. Come out Devan.

1163
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,026
l want to kiss you.

1164
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:14,929
lt is my nose. l am here.

1165
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:20,039
l am afraid, Maya.

1166
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,932
lt is your, Devan brother. Touch and see.

1167
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,709
No one can't see him.

1168
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:35,020
Devan can you see you Ramu?
- l can see you Ramu.

1169
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,226
Come doctor.

1170
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:56,603
With great effort l got his number
from his academy.

1171
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:59,511
Then l talked to him too.
- Then what did he said?

1172
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:01,738
ln fact he is upset.

1173
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,974
Then since his daughter's accident
was not that serious..

1174
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,914
..he said he would come immediately.

1175
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,611
Did you tell him about Devan?

1176
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,587
Yes. l even got a doctor for him.

1177
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:14,192
The doctor talked to Sekar too.

1178
01:37:14,795 --> 01:37:15,921
There is nothing to fear.

1179
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,321
Though invisible.

1180
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:21,695
Doctor Sekar said....the ordinary
medicines usable will do, he said.

1181
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:26,268
But he said no parts like the injection
should stab his body.

1182
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:27,269
Why is that?

1183
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:29,533
May be some reaction.

1184
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:31,208
Where is he?- He is upstairs.

1185
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:38,250
He is lying there.

1186
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:43,217
Doctor Uncle, can you see me?

1187
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:06,102
What will l do Madam?

1188
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,807
Don't worry. Everything will be ok.

1189
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,476
Where is your chest?

1190
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:14,176
lt is here, Uncle.

1191
01:38:23,864 --> 01:38:25,832
Where is your forehead?- lt is here.

1192
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,135
He has fever.

1193
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:38,868
We can only say it is a viral fever.

1194
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:41,339
lt is a treatment without seeing the patient.

1195
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:44,013
lf any one comes with me to the
clinic l will send the medicine.

1196
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:45,242
l will come doctor.

1197
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:48,419
Doctor, remember what l said?

1198
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:50,451
For the present....let no one else know this.

1199
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,248
lt is a little secretive involving many.

1200
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,194
Even if l say, no one will believe me.

1201
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:59,821
Whether you will believe or not,
what l said is true.

1202
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:04,437
Two days l did not sleep.
l am very much afraid.

1203
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:08,033
When that ghost will come, l am tensed.

1204
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:10,176
Now my BP medicine has become double.

1205
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:15,838
Hey. Commissioner, you said you will
get him....now what happened?

1206
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:21,078
lf l knew where she is,
l will pick her that minute.

1207
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,347
He is here, take her.

1208
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:27,960
Pardon me for coming to your
place and saying this.

1209
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:31,654
Or l would have given you good.

1210
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:37,593
lf you can't pick up a girl in this city,
what else you can do?

1211
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,739
What is the use of telling only me?

1212
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:43,603
You got a professional killer from Dubai.
Hasan Mustafa.

1213
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:48,412
He is just roaming around.
Did he do anything else?

1214
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:50,242
No use of fighting amongst ourselves.

1215
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:53,449
As per me the one who is protecting her is..

1216
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,418
..a capable woman. Anita Williams.

1217
01:39:56,623 --> 01:40:00,423
Roy's case for bail comes to court tomorrow.

1218
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:01,719
lt is she who is behind this too.

1219
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:03,820
As l said will that become a problem too?

1220
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,794
You need not worry on that count.

1221
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:10,830
l have made up clear evidence with which..
..he can never come out for life.

1222
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:14,633
Even the public prosecutor is our man.

1223
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:15,831
Yet we have to be careful.

1224
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:18,068
lf he comes out he is a danger for us.

1225
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:21,076
My opinion that if he is alive
he is a danger for us.

1226
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,010
Let the case be over tomorrow.

1227
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:28,285
l will arrange to finish him in the jail itself.

1228
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:30,514
Yes that is what is needed.

1229
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:34,022
But don't worry that he will get bail tomorrow.

1230
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:35,092
What is the matter.

1231
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:37,092
lt is because the Session Judge Ramamurthi.

1232
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,559
Yes, that is it.

1233
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:42,934
Will he do anything against law and proof?

1234
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:50,569
Muruga. What are you saying, Kurupu?

1235
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:54,504
You should remember that you are
talking to Sessions Judge....Rama Murthy.

1236
01:40:55,449 --> 01:41:00,148
Hey, if you do too much you will
be inside, remember that.

1237
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:01,513
Don't forget that.

1238
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:06,789
lf it is 5 millions l will do it.

1239
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:13,330
Now we talk later in court.
Yes. Yes.

1240
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:21,299
Greetings. l am New lndia
Television MD. Radha Ramanan.

1241
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:22,873
Radha Ramanan Murthy.

1242
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:26,305
Oh, a white Brahmin, isn't it? Sit down.

1243
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,942
l am black Brahmin.

1244
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:31,879
Yet l hear that your heart is white.

1245
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,145
Hence l came straight to you to say something..

1246
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,322
Requests, complaints etc, are in court.

1247
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:38,013
l won't hear that at home.

1248
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:41,991
lt is an important thing that one
Brahmin says to another.

1249
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:45,165
You should not neglect it so easily.
- What is it, tell me.

1250
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:49,825
Last 3 1/2 years Roy is in jail without bail.

1251
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:53,268
The bail request is coming to
you today in court.- l know.

1252
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:56,773
Roy is innocent. 101 % innocent.

1253
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,011
You know all the matter.

1254
01:41:59,379 --> 01:42:02,348
As a Brahmin, you should stand for the truth.

1255
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:07,009
Get up. You came to bribe Sessions Judge?

1256
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:10,019
l will get you caught by the police.
- You can hang me to death.

1257
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:12,187
But the base code in lndian Penal Code is..

1258
01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:16,886
..even thousand criminals may escape but
one innocent should....not be punished.

1259
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:18,564
Don't go against that.

1260
01:42:19,733 --> 01:42:21,894
l only believe in Lord Murugan.

1261
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:25,997
What ever Judgement l gave so far..
..l have not so far erred.

1262
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:29,207
Are you going or l get you arrested?

1263
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:31,934
l will go. l too am a devotee of Murugan.

1264
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:35,138
lf l come to know if you have done
some thing wrong...in this matter,

1265
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:37,681
Lord Murugan himself will punish you.
You will see.

1266
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:44,383
Muruga, did l do any mistake?

1267
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:47,284
Then you tell me.

1268
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,553
lf so....l will atone for it.

1269
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:52,960
Rama murthy.- Muruga.

1270
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,635
lt is me, Lord Murugan before you.

1271
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:56,734
My little, Muruga.

1272
01:42:56,937 --> 01:43:00,805
Don't do anything wrong.- Muruga.

1273
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:15,680
He need not believe this public prosecutor.

1274
01:43:15,956 --> 01:43:20,518
lf Yunus and Diwakar were not there..

1275
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:41,344
Muruga.

1276
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:45,049
Poovan Palli Joseph's son, Roy Joseph..

1277
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:47,853
Poovan Palli Joseph's son, Roy Joseph..

1278
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:50,688
Poovan Palli Joseph's son, Roy Joseph..

1279
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:07,136
Yes proceed.

1280
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:08,371
Your honour.

1281
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:13,236
For the last 3 1/2 years in the justice of lndia..

1282
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:18,612
..and courts, the state had
kept him in custody.

1283
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:23,656
Even with giving a chance to
prove his innocence..

1284
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:27,190
..this young man was kept in custody..

1285
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:33,128
..at the instance of a minister of this state,
l humbly submit.

1286
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:39,501
Sit down.

1287
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,833
Did anything happen positively?

1288
01:44:43,043 --> 01:44:44,806
With this argument nothing will happen.

1289
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,074
lf positive then Vel Murugan should interfere.

1290
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:53,618
Hence l request that my innocent
client's bail should be admitted.

1291
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:57,522
Muruga.- l am here with you.

1292
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:01,989
Your honour.

1293
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:06,692
All what the defence counsel said..
..was a pack of lies.

1294
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:11,131
Not only 3 1/2 years, there are examples of..

1295
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:16,571
..people in jail without enquiry
for very cruel people.

1296
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:21,904
He says there is not enough proof.

1297
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:25,011
This file in my hand will reply to that.

1298
01:45:25,519 --> 01:45:32,721
The forensic report says that
the finger print matches..

1299
01:45:32,926 --> 01:45:36,054
..with the accused's fingers.

1300
01:45:37,364 --> 01:45:42,700
Sir, are you saying the finger prints on the dead girl
is not a proof?

1301
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:51,102
There are proofs that he has connection with..
..terrorist Augustin Kuruvilla.

1302
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:54,769
Proofs of his connection with religious extremists.

1303
01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:04,789
Proofs of his involvement with bomb blasts.
All these are in this file.

1304
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:12,758
Based on these crystal clear evidences..

1305
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:16,696
..l request the honourable court not to allow bail..

1306
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:20,768
..for this dangerous criminal.

1307
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:29,409
lt is Bala Murugan. lt is Bala Murugan.

1308
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:35,179
Your honour, do you beat every lawyer
like this with the hammer?

1309
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,118
What mistake did l do?

1310
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,191
Mr. Prosecutor. l did not do that.

1311
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,828
Muruga, what am l seeing?

1312
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:46,465
That man is telling lies, taking bribes.

1313
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:50,500
All what he said are lies.
- Yes. All of them.

1314
01:46:52,005 --> 01:46:54,166
lt doesn't matter l was hit with the hammer.

1315
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,035
You don't grant bail, that is enough.

1316
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,140
As per the proof in that file
you can't grant bail..

1317
01:46:58,345 --> 01:47:01,746
..to him for 25 years at least.

1318
01:47:26,873 --> 01:47:30,070
Mr. Prosecutor, is this your evidence?

1319
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:38,013
Yes sir, lt has been gathered by
the smart Commissioner....Shanmugam.

1320
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:40,078
Then listen.

1321
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,722
The woman Sangeetha was
killed by Yunus's man..

1322
01:47:43,924 --> 01:47:46,791
.. a goon named, Johnny.

1323
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:56,359
The forensic report was changed
by bribing Dr.Aravind Shenai..

1324
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:02,475
..to the tune of 1 million.

1325
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:13,547
Today a DNA report saying that chingini,
who is in Maya's..

1326
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:22,889
..Snehalaya, is Yunus's daughter,
is being submitted....in High court.

1327
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:29,827
To get evidence that Roy has connection
with....religious extremists,

1328
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:33,295
and the bomb blasts..

1329
01:48:33,773 --> 01:48:39,302
..the Commissioner, Dilip from Vigilance and the

1330
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:44,078
..Public Prosecutor, Joy were given
500 thousand rupees each.

1331
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:47,211
The proof of these are attached here.

1332
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:51,856
Don't read the rest.
Your honour will fly away.

1333
01:48:55,662 --> 01:49:01,328
Based on the evidence here,
as per Roy's statement..

1334
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:08,473
..and to investigate the case,
this court orders bail to Roy.

1335
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:28,886
Wonder Kid... Wonder Kid...

1336
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:35,824
Come to save justice from the mean

1337
01:49:36,436 --> 01:49:42,397
You come like a little-Policeman

1338
01:49:44,444 --> 01:49:50,576
To terrify the charlatans who
are gentlemen by day.

1339
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:57,754
You are a coconut-tree blossomed
like an umbrella with a smile

1340
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:23,443
You come like a little-Policeman

1341
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:31,755
To terrify the charlatans
who are gentlemen by day.

1342
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:35,791
You are an umbrella-like coconut-tree
blossomed with a smile

1343
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:38,464
You, please come with a thunderous play.

1344
01:51:13,533 --> 01:51:19,836
To avert corruption in the corridors of powerful,

1345
01:51:20,206 --> 01:51:23,505
Will you amuse with your cane?

1346
01:51:23,743 --> 01:51:26,337
Will you thrash them on their back?

1347
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:30,540
To shake 'n ' shake the podgy,
who is being beaten up,

1348
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:33,515
Please thrash.

1349
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:39,689
We shall render assistance
by hitting him in the turnings.

1350
01:51:40,226 --> 01:51:46,859
O magician, in your silver chariot,
to be hungry is also interesting.

1351
01:51:47,067 --> 01:51:53,700
Luttappi, if you go to your small temple,
All will welcome you.

1352
01:51:56,743 --> 01:52:12,216
Wonder Kid... Wonder Kid...

1353
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:22,664
l have brought you on my risk.

1354
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:25,769
lf anything goes wrong l can't..
..take responsibility.

1355
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:27,837
What problem can take place here?

1356
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:33,742
You should not have come here.

1357
01:52:34,714 --> 01:52:37,911
You are in more danger than me.

1358
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:41,145
Hence l said not to come out.

1359
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:48,858
lf there is a re-investigation the crime against
them....will be established.

1360
01:52:49,062 --> 01:52:51,053
Then they will do anything to get out.

1361
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:52,988
l just came to see, Maya and go.

1362
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:19,818
l told you not to come out.

1363
01:53:20,093 --> 01:53:23,585
l saw Maya, now l will see mother and go.

1364
01:53:23,997 --> 01:53:24,793
You want that?

1365
01:53:25,765 --> 01:53:28,029
The bail new came in the papers.

1366
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,565
lf l don't see them,
then they will be troubled.

1367
01:53:31,437 --> 01:53:33,496
Ok. But be careful.

1368
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,301
Then go back to the place l said.

1369
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:40,540
Tomorrow morning, DCP Rajan, and crime
branch people....will see you.

1370
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:41,541
Ok. Madam

1371
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:55,086
l have kept the press conference at 6.30.

1372
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:59,090
When you tell them the details
all will be shocked.

1373
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:01,267
lf we had that Memory card too.

1374
01:54:01,467 --> 01:54:03,025
Now no use of saying that.

1375
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,630
You tell all the things to the news men.

1376
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:07,699
Maya, is one of them isn't it?

1377
01:54:08,675 --> 01:54:11,143
For the present this is the best thing.

1378
01:54:12,812 --> 01:54:14,939
When is Sekar's flight?

1379
01:54:15,315 --> 01:54:17,510
lt is at 5 pm. He must have arrived.

1380
01:54:17,717 --> 01:54:19,708
Radha Ramanan will get him here.

1381
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:32,660
Where am l brought?
Why have you got me here?

1382
01:54:46,913 --> 01:54:50,679
You are going to meet the crime branch
people tomorrow morning isn't it?

1383
01:54:52,685 --> 01:54:54,050
Tell me you pig.

1384
01:54:54,354 --> 01:54:57,152
What are you going to tell them?

1385
01:54:57,357 --> 01:54:59,951
Don't think you will escape killing me.

1386
01:55:00,426 --> 01:55:04,260
Today or tomorrow your mask will be torn off.

1387
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,094
This court you can purchase.

1388
01:55:08,568 --> 01:55:11,230
But in God's court it will not happen.

1389
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:37,355
Now nothing's wrong with you isn't it?

1390
01:55:37,563 --> 01:55:39,190
Now l am ok.

1391
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:42,163
Because they can't see me,
others are confused.

1392
01:55:42,502 --> 01:55:45,198
Make me visible, Uncle.

1393
01:55:45,538 --> 01:55:48,939
How much and what you
drank from my lab?

1394
01:55:49,108 --> 01:55:52,805
The second time l drank
one full glass of it.

1395
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:55,572
To be invisible for more time.

1396
01:56:23,676 --> 01:56:24,768
Nothing wrong isn't it?

1397
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:26,741
You can make him visible again isn't it?

1398
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:35,150
Can l see my Devan again?

1399
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:40,748
Tonight l will work in my lab
and get an antidote.

1400
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,322
l will go to lab immediately.

1401
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:50,729
What is in your pocket?

1402
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:53,163
What is in my pocket?

1403
01:56:56,476 --> 01:56:59,274
Maya the card was in my pocket.

1404
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:02,642
Yes. lt must fallen in it when the
tub tumbled and the..

1405
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:04,942
..leaves fell over me.

1406
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:11,517
Sekar came with right leg first it seems.

1407
01:57:11,824 --> 01:57:13,724
Not only will Devan be visible again..

1408
01:57:13,993 --> 01:57:18,453
..the precious memory card too we got back.

1409
01:57:19,065 --> 01:57:21,124
This memory card is so precious?

1410
01:57:21,334 --> 01:57:23,495
This card is the reason for all these problems.

1411
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,898
lf l broadcast this in the TV news,

1412
01:57:26,105 --> 01:57:28,471
that very minute....the Kerala Cabinet will fall.

1413
01:57:28,674 --> 01:57:30,835
A cyclone will blow across Kerala politics.

1414
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:43,822
Hello, give that memory card.
- Which card?

1415
01:57:44,023 --> 01:57:44,853
The one in your pocket.

1416
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:45,922
My pocket...

1417
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:47,387
Take that memory card from his pocket.

1418
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,675
Take that memory card from him.

1419
01:58:12,385 --> 01:58:14,250
Don't go there

1420
01:58:44,817 --> 01:58:45,784
Bloody rascals.

1421
01:59:19,685 --> 01:59:22,677
Hello, ACP. Hello, ACP.

1422
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:26,120
That is over now. Give that phone here.
Give it here. Hold her.

1423
01:59:30,096 --> 01:59:32,155
Give it here. Leave her.

1424
02:00:08,734 --> 02:00:11,567
Leave her...- Sir, the card is with him.

1425
02:00:17,243 --> 02:00:18,870
You take the memory card and telecast it.

1426
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:53,575
Devan.

1427
02:00:55,982 --> 02:00:58,746
Hey, my child.

1428
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:06,049
Devan.

1429
02:01:18,404 --> 02:01:20,429
What is this l am seeing.

1430
02:01:24,977 --> 02:01:26,274
l did not want it to happen.

1431
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:28,944
l had said not even a
needle should prick his body.

1432
02:01:29,315 --> 02:01:31,613
There will be a reaction.

1433
02:01:31,884 --> 02:01:32,612
Devan.

1434
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:37,948
Son.

1435
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:43,759
Deva....

1436
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:21,658
Son Devan.

1437
02:02:36,082 --> 02:02:40,348
Come let us run.

1438
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:18,384
Come let us run.

1439
02:04:10,276 --> 02:04:13,973
Come this way.

1440
02:04:28,828 --> 02:04:30,625
l think he is climbing.

1441
02:04:30,996 --> 02:04:32,964
Shall l get in a police car and come.

1442
02:04:33,165 --> 02:04:36,794
Not now. l am coming there wait.

1443
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:38,795
Ok. Come let us go up.

1444
02:05:42,568 --> 02:05:43,865
Save me, oh God.

1445
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:07,044
Stand aside. Stand aside. Stand aside.

1446
02:07:11,223 --> 02:07:14,522
Hey, kill that demon and get the car. Tell them

1447
02:07:14,727 --> 02:07:19,687
There are thousands of cars behind.
How can we get our car?

1448
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:27,865
What wonder am l seeing?

1449
02:07:28,073 --> 02:07:29,700
Making fun of shocking people?

1450
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:32,874
You did not understand it?
What game is this?

1451
02:07:33,412 --> 02:07:37,041
You and your game. This that Athisayan.

1452
02:07:37,249 --> 02:07:39,581
Because of the crowd he is not killing us.

1453
02:07:39,985 --> 02:07:42,044
lt chased Yunus and Naser to kill.

1454
02:07:42,254 --> 02:07:44,552
He has injured many.

1455
02:07:46,325 --> 02:07:50,056
Now the only way is to run from here.

1456
02:07:50,996 --> 02:07:52,395
Come on go.- Where?

1457
02:07:52,598 --> 02:07:55,066
Where ever, but away from here.
Clear the way, police.

1458
02:08:01,607 --> 02:08:03,234
Go fast without turning back.

1459
02:08:08,113 --> 02:08:10,411
You get down. l am getting afraid now.

1460
02:08:10,616 --> 02:08:12,584
Now my wife and child are too in danger.

1461
02:08:12,785 --> 02:08:14,912
Hey this not to be afraid of.

1462
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,917
Athisayan is only a child.

1463
02:08:18,624 --> 02:08:30,263
l don't know. l am very much afraid.
l am going home.

1464
02:08:30,469 --> 02:08:35,099
l will give you more money.
- Then start the scooter.

1465
02:08:35,307 --> 02:08:37,104
When you are with me..

1466
02:08:38,977 --> 02:08:40,444
Oh my Goddess.

1467
02:08:50,489 --> 02:08:52,457
We are gone. We are gone.

1468
02:08:53,859 --> 02:09:07,398
He is taking us somewhere. Please save us.

1469
02:09:08,507 --> 02:09:10,338
Hey, the wires carrying electricity.

1470
02:09:12,177 --> 02:09:15,476
He has put us on top of it.

1471
02:09:15,681 --> 02:09:16,807
Oh, God. Jesus.

1472
02:09:17,082 --> 02:09:26,582
Oh, my Goddess.

1473
02:09:26,859 --> 02:09:30,989
Our lives are more precious than money.

1474
02:09:33,098 --> 02:09:36,499
Some body come and save us.

1475
02:09:44,376 --> 02:09:51,680
My CM, send the military and police.
lmmediately kill that demon.

1476
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:55,015
He is gone for some committee meeting.

1477
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:58,678
Don't be afraid. You both are safe here.

1478
02:10:03,729 --> 02:10:07,529
Run. Run. For your lives.

1479
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:24,909
Run fast upstairs.

1480
02:10:31,423 --> 02:10:34,392
Yes. Sir. The police have come here.

1481
02:10:36,295 --> 02:10:40,231
lf you fire he will become
still more violent. Yes, sir.

1482
02:10:43,302 --> 02:10:47,898
Will l get my Devan back?
Or will they kill my son?

1483
02:10:48,173 --> 02:10:49,902
No Maya, nothing will happen to him.

1484
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:52,575
He has said he will do what he to save him.

1485
02:11:12,130 --> 02:11:13,097
Don't kill us.

1486
02:11:26,945 --> 02:11:30,403
Shoot and kill him. Why are you all looking?

1487
02:11:30,682 --> 02:11:34,448
Leave us, we won't do any more mistakes.

1488
02:11:37,489 --> 02:11:40,458
ls there no one to rescue us from here?

1489
02:11:40,659 --> 02:11:41,785
ls there no one?

1490
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:43,956
Hey, please rescue me.

1491
02:12:15,193 --> 02:12:18,321
Stand aside. Stand aside. Stand aside.

1492
02:12:20,132 --> 02:12:27,163
Hey who is lying here. Both are
my friends. What will l do now?

1493
02:13:03,742 --> 02:13:04,709
Sekar sir.

1494
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:07,378
He is behaving like a mad man inside.

1495
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:30,400
We want to see scientist Sekar.

1496
02:13:30,602 --> 02:13:33,901
He is busy. He can't see any one now.

1497
02:13:37,275 --> 02:13:39,402
l'm in Sekar sir's lab.

1498
02:13:41,446 --> 02:13:46,076

it is dawn now. Please sir.

1499
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:47,409
Who is it?

1500
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:52,756
Chief Minister. He has told to give
firing orders, before he kills more.

1501
02:14:31,329 --> 02:14:35,789
No. l am helpless.

1502
02:15:13,038 --> 02:15:14,005
What is it?

1503
02:15:14,873 --> 02:15:22,177
l am helpless. There is no remedy.

1504
02:15:26,051 --> 02:15:29,509
There is nothing l can do to reverse it.

1505
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:56,203
lyappa. Now what shall l do?

1506
02:16:17,469 --> 02:16:18,731
Come quickly. Prepare for firing.

1507
02:16:41,626 --> 02:16:47,428
Son, Devan it is your sister Maya calling.

1508
02:16:49,134 --> 02:16:50,761
Son, Devan.

1509
02:17:13,658 --> 02:17:14,283
Brother Devan.

02:17:18,797 --> 02:17:24,633
Son, Devan it is your sister Maya calling.

1511
02:17:24,836 --> 02:17:29,637
Son, Devan.

1512
02:17:30,508 --> 02:17:31,475
Devan.

1513
02:17:35,013 --> 02:17:36,310
Maya is calling.

1514
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:39,981
Shoot.

1515
02:17:40,185 --> 02:17:41,982
No. don't shoot him.

1516
02:17:42,187 --> 02:17:44,314
Don't do anything to him.
He will go away.

1517
02:17:44,856 --> 02:17:49,987
Son. Son. Son. Devan.

1518
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,497
Devan...

02:17:57,702 --> 02:18:00,500

Devan.

1523
02:19:25,457 --> 02:19:29,416
Devan is not coming because
he is angry with me?

1524
02:19:36,134 --> 02:19:37,761
Lets go home, Dear.

1525
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:41,930
No. My Devan will come back.
l'll wait till then.

1526
02:20:03,027 --> 02:20:05,393
To create a new scientific history,

1527
02:20:05,797 --> 02:20:09,255
and to seek justice from evil doers
he will come back...
