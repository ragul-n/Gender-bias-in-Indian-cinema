00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,143
Young man, may be you are a stranger.

4
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,101
Males are prohibited
from entering this place.

5
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:12,938
You will be punished with death,
young man.

6
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,475
Who are you?

7
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,134
I am the inhabitant
of the forest, Samson.

8
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,613
Don't you know that
males are prohibited..

9
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,680
From entering this place?

10
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:54,003
I can ask you the same question.

11
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:55,523
What do you mean?

12
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,133
If males cannot enter Husnabad..

13
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,953
Then who was the
person who fought with me.

14
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,260
And who are you?

15
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,816
The one who fought with
you was not a human being.

16
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,882
And I am Ustad Rashid.

17
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,262
Priest to the Lord Mukkadas.

18
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,858
The lord had announced
me as the supreme..

19
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,583
Of Husnabad by their
divine proclamation.

20
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:16,834
This law doesn't apply to me.

21
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,401
The law that is not applicable..

22
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,101
To everyone is not law.

23
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,887
You don't need to bother
if it is a law or not.

24
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,368
Just tell me, what you want.

25
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,863
A girl from your Husnabad had nabbed..

26
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:32,459
A goat kid from the jungle.

27
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,065
I have come to take it back.

28
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:39,960
Which girl has brought the kid?
Tell me. Answer me.

29
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,971
Why are you silent?
Why don't you give an answer?

30
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,926
The Queen had got the goat kid.

31
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,546
Return the kid to him.

32
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,743
Please forgive my intrusion.

33
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:50,564
The Queen likes the kid a lot.

34
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,361
I have told you to
return the kid to him.

35
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:54,451
Okay.

36
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:02,181
And listen stranger.
This was your first mistake.

37
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,760
That's why I have forgiven you.

38
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:09,435
Don't try to break the law again.
Take care.

39
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:11,973
Samson lives in the jungle.

40
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:17,146
He neither breaks any laws
nor let others break his laws.

41
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,391
Samson will be forced to come again..

42
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,374
If any girl form Husnabad
does anything like this.

43
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,640
Take care about it.

44
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,670
Give the goat kid to Samson.

45
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:35,141
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

46
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:46,179
Sir. Sir. Hurry up, sir. Hurry up.

47
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,361
- We are dead, sir.
- Why? What happened?

48
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:50,867
The jungle people had
caught the small elephant..

49
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,015
And made him fall into the ditch.

50
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,267
- Now they want to kill it.
- Where?

51
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,218
There.

52
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,168
- Come with me.
- I am not coming.

53
00:09:58,248 --> 00:09:59,468
Then go.

54
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:57,659
Awesome, sir. Awesome! Wow!

55
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,466
Don't be violent. No!

56
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,424
Sir, you have sent me up again.

57
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:47,809
Run! Run!

58
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,844
Dead! Get up! Dead!

59
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:04,112
You get up. He is already dead.

60
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:46,044
"May God do so, darling."

61
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,615
"May God do so, darling."

62
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:57,988
"That you should bloom and
be a fragrant rose in gardens."

63
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,567
"May God do so, darling."

64
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:08,281
"May God do so, darling."

65
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:16,525
"That you should bloom and
be a fragrant rose in gardens."

66
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:23,340
"May God do so, darling."

67
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:52,983
"You are dreaming a musical dream."

68
00:14:56,324 --> 00:15:03,509
"You are dreaming a musical dream."

69
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,495
"Rub your eyes with your hands."

70
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:11,052
"Smile proudly."

71
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:15,526
"The dawn will become bright."

72
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,908
"The dawn will become bright."

73
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:29,194
"May your looks always
remain pretty and young."

74
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,994
"May God do so, darling."

75
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,924
"May God do so, darling."

76
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,595
"The waves have become colorful."

77
00:16:02,854 --> 00:16:06,668
"There is noise in the city."

78
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:13,394
"The waves have become colorful."

79
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:17,295
"There is noise in the city."

80
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:24,279
"You are not Kamini.
Damini is taking a bath."

81
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:29,098
"In this nice weather."

82
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:39,747
"In this nice weather your
body has set the water on fire."

83
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:46,481
"May God do so, darling."

84
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:50,524
"May God do so, darling."

85
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,308
"This is the color of makeup."

86
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:20,178
"This is the beauty of spring."

87
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:27,293
"This is the color of makeup."

88
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:30,785
"This is the beauty of spring."

89
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:38,146
"Darling look here,
because I am your mirror."

90
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:42,438
"Sometimes they forget."

91
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:53,454
"Sometimes they forget
and your hair causes wrinkles."

92
00:17:56,363 --> 00:18:00,017
"May God do so, darling."

93
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:03,650
"May God do so, darling."

94
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:11,942
"That you should bloom and
be a fragrant rose in gardens."

95
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:19,358
"May God do so, darling."

96
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:44,550
Razia! Sultana! Chanela!

97
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,431
Where is the kid?

98
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:51,253
Where is the kid?

99
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,507
Laila!

100
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,502
- Yes, my Queen.
- Where is the kid?

101
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:04,313
Why are you smiling?
Answer my question.

102
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,923
Where is the kid?

103
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,264
Forgive my impertinence, my queen.

104
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:13,080
Nobody gets married in Husnabad.

105
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,006
Then where will we get kids from?

106
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,183
I am not asking about your
kid but about the goat kid.

107
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,202
He one which we have
brought from the forest.

108
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:24,226
- Ustad Rashid has returned it.
- Returned it?

109
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,875
Why? And whom did he return it to?

110
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:31,102
A man called Samson
came from the forest.

111
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,600
To ask for the goat's kid.

112
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,740
And Ustad Rashid returned it.

113
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:39,902
How did a man dare to enter Husnabad?

114
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,216
Instead of catching
him and throwing him..

115
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:44,908
To the dreadful creature,
why did the Ustad..

116
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:46,259
Return to him the kid?

117
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,356
Ms. Queen, he was not an ordinary man.

118
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,999
We tried our best
to stop and catch him.

119
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,324
But nobody could overpower him.

120
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,458
He broke down the strong gate of..

121
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,231
The royal palace with a single blow.

122
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,015
Thank god that Ustad
Rashid returned him that kid.

123
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,199
Otherwise he might have caused havoc.

124
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:08,513
Don't blabber.

125
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:11,751
- Prepare my chariot.
- But my queen...

126
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,750
Laila, don't try to speak
when I don't want to hear anything.

127
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,173
Save me!

128
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:23,244
Save me!

129
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,583
- Thank you.
- Who are you?

130
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:00,631
I am queen Sheba from Husnabad.

131
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,490
- And who are you?
- I am Samson.

132
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,452
So you are Samson.

133
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:12,173
It seems the praised I
have heard for you are all true.

134
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:14,497
- You are really brave.
- Thanks.

135
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:16,876
I am not used to be praised.

136
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,919
Tell me, how can I help you?

137
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,670
I have come to fetch that goat kid..

138
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,508
That Rashid had returned to you.

139
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,778
I am sorry, you cannot get it back.

140
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,292
Speak properly!

141
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,590
Stay away from me.

142
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:41,460
I haven't moved a bit. You came to me.

143
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,465
Jungle men. You stink like an animal.

144
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,148
Aren't I stinking now?

145
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,283
This is good.

146
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:59,466
You are coming close and
going far of your own accord.

147
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,472
You are scared and still trying
to show how grand you are.

148
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:03,877
What do you want?

149
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:07,910
Samson! I have told you what I wanted.

150
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:12,061
If I don't get back the goat
kid I will set fire to your forest.

151
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:16,148
Sheba! You should have
thought before saying so.

152
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:19,239
- Who are you and what is your status?
- Samson!

153
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,824
Silence! Just think.
You have a small life.

154
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:32,094
A small body.
Small hands. Thin fingers. I pity you.

155
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:35,834
I want you to go back
to your place safe and sound.

156
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,829
Otherwise if a beast attacks you..

157
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:44,407
This queen will
vanish without a trace.

158
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,251
Go. Go back.

159
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:52,603
I will go back.

160
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,360
But you will have a problem.

161
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,511
I am very thirsty. Get me some water.

162
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,041
Okay.

163
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:41,791
Queen Sheba! Queen Sheba!

164
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,132
One safeguards their own honor,
my queen.

165
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,078
If you could have sought
Ustad Rashid's advice..

166
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,771
Before going there
you wouldn't have failed.

167
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:00,668
I don't need advice.
I want to be avenged.

168
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:02,744
You will be avenged for sure..

169
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,652
But you need to wait for that.

170
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:07,479
I can't wait.

171
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,291
Laila! Laila!

172
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:25,934
Yes, my queen.

173
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:30,183
Order the cavalry to arrest Samson..

174
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:34,269
- And bring him to me.
- But my queen!

175
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,075
Carry out my orders.

176
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,270
My queen.

177
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,075
The poison is here, my queen.

178
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,701
This poison is so potent
that no one in the world..

179
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:13,166
Can tell its taste,
because he dies before he could speak.

180
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:28,020
My queen, one attack from
this and he will be killed.

181
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:32,075
But to tell the truth you
don't even need to attack him.

182
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,983
Just pierce him with
it and he will dead.

183
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:38,270
No, Laila.

184
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:42,248
I don't want to kill him so soon.

185
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:45,665
I will not kill him so easily.

186
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:49,513
My queen, Samson has been arrested.

187
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:52,476
And being presented to you.

188
00:30:15,741 --> 00:30:21,060
Laila, what is this stench?
Is it some animal?

189
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,314
Oh it's you.

190
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:51,233
Such a huge body. Strong body.

191
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:55,320
A torso like a stone wall.
Everything is big.

192
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:57,946
But you still have a small life.

193
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,789
If I even scratch you
with the poisoned blade..

194
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,908
Then this Samson
will die without a trace.

195
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:13,178
God decided life
and death and not men.

196
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,740
If I am destined to live
than no force one earth can kill me.

197
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:21,946
Aren't you scared of death?

198
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:25,513
I wouldn't have come here,
if I was scared of death.

199
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,254
You haven't come here voluntarily.

200
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:28,808
You have been forced to come here.

201
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:32,194
If you think that your
girls have caught me..

202
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,972
And brought me
here than that is wrong.

203
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,431
What do you mean?

204
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:41,004
I mean to say that I didn't
want to kill these innocent girls.

205
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:43,134
That's why I volunteered
my arrest and came here.

206
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:47,253
Otherwise these iron
shackles cannot hold Samson.

207
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:51,307
- I find them just like grass.
- That's false.

208
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:53,480
Samson never lies.

209
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:58,507
You are always with you your devotee.

210
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:03,707
And I have your strength. Oh God!

211
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:14,670
I came here to meet you.

212
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:18,767
I wanted to ask you
why you are after me.

213
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,875
What do you want from me?

214
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,487
But I am sorry that
my motive was not completed.

215
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,676
Because you yourself don't
know what you want from me.

216
00:32:33,113 --> 00:32:35,265
Well. Goodbye.

217
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,708
Take him away.

218
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,769
Aag, show Ustad your powers.

219
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,660
Well done.
Hawa, show him your powers too.

220
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:36,575
Well done!

221
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:48,877
Well done! Very good!

222
00:35:07,364 --> 00:35:10,716
- Ustad Rashid.
- Hail him.

223
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:14,132
- Ustad Rashid.
- Hail him.

224
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:23,483
Ustad Rashid is still
proud of his strength.

225
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:26,644
We can turn the entire
world into ashes..

226
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,098
With our friend Aag.

227
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:33,758
And with my friend
Paani we can immerse..

228
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,887
The entire world with water.

229
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,726
And our friend Hawa will
help us to create huge storms.

230
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:44,266
Sorry for my impertinence, Ustad.

231
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:49,110
But I think with my help
you should kill the queen..

232
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,785
And take over the rule Husnabad.

233
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:56,504
I still rule over Husnabad.

234
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:59,985
But I will keep queen
Sheba alive till..

235
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:07,292
We find her lost
brother prince Salukh.

236
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:11,238
Is he still alive, sir?

237
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,087
He is surely alive.

238
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:18,557
That old slave who ran
away with him 20 years ago..

239
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,487
Would have kept him
safer than his own life.

240
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:25,411
And once we have found price Salukh..

241
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:27,876
All our problems will be resolved.

242
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:36,945
Listen to me again and
look at the royal coat of arms.

243
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:40,935
If you see anyone bearing
this symbol on his back..

244
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:44,297
Then he is prince Salukh
whom you need to arrest..

245
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:46,081
And bring him at once to me.

246
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:42,524
"Convince me that I can't be yours."

247
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:52,323
"Convince me that I can't be yours."

248
00:37:53,870 --> 00:38:01,870
"My eyes and heart
are still yearning."

249
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:08,191
"Convince me."

250
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:26,159
"I became restless
when I heard you coming."

251
00:38:29,985 --> 00:38:37,985
"I became restless
when I heard you coming."

252
00:38:39,511 --> 00:38:44,030
"When I heard you coming."

253
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:52,110
"I feel at rest when I saw you."

254
00:38:53,770 --> 00:39:01,770
"Convince me that I can't be yours."

255
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:08,073
"My eyes are still yearning."

256
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:25,401
"Your love is kind but what do I do?

257
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:37,120
"Your love is kind but what do I do?"

258
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,915
"But what do I do?"

259
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:50,995
"My life is to be smitten by you."

260
00:39:52,461 --> 00:40:00,461
"Convince me that I can't be yours."

261
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:06,397
"My eyes are still yearning."

262
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:24,072
"My heart is in my body
otherwise often in the moonlight."

263
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:35,692
"My heart is in my body
otherwise often in the moonlight."

264
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:40,923
"Otherwise often in the moonlight."

265
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:49,518
"It has made you sit beside
me and combed your hair."

266
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:58,945
"My eyes and heart
are still yearning."

267
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:08,215
"Convince me that I can't be yours."

268
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:14,481
"Convince me."

269
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Laila! Laila!

270
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:34,969
Laila, where did you
learn these love songs from?

271
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:40,590
My queen, you cannot learn love songs.

272
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,379
They get imbibed into you.

273
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:49,032
Because my queen love
cannot be separated..

274
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:51,032
From a person's life.

275
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:56,448
So do you think that
even I will fall in love?

276
00:41:57,442 --> 00:42:00,977
My queen, you are already in love.

277
00:42:01,272 --> 00:42:04,299
Me, in love? With whom?

278
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:08,007
- With Samson.
- Samson?

279
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:21,283
Laila, I am happy that you
have given me a chance to laugh.

280
00:42:21,878 --> 00:42:24,121
But I don't understand one thing..

281
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:26,948
How did you accept
my hatred as love?

282
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:33,574
My queen, how can I tell
you the slim difference..

283
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,618
Between hatred and love?

284
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:43,261
When love can turn into
hatred and vice versa..

285
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,828
Cannot be understood easily.

286
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:51,066
It seems strange but interesting.

287
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:58,060
My queen, sometimes love
even starts with hatred.

288
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:02,579
See for yourself.
You use to hate Samson at first.

289
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,385
But now you love him.

290
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,125
If you wished you
could have killed him..

291
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:11,941
With the poisonous
knife but you didn't do that.

292
00:43:12,817 --> 00:43:15,822
If you wanted you could
have cut off his limbs..

293
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,384
But you didn't do that.

294
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:21,864
And that is because
my queen you don't want him...

295
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:25,735
- And that's why I love him.
- Yes, my queen.

296
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:27,994
But love is prohibited for me.

297
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:34,059
Ustad Rashid says that the
day I fall in love with a man..

298
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,276
Lord Mukkadas will curse Husnabad.

299
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:22,591
You? You have come again.

300
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,391
Sheba, come.

301
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,564
Samson, you shouldn't
come here frequently.

302
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:51,684
I don't know what happens
to me when you come here.

303
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:55,414
I am not able to think straight.

304
00:44:56,376 --> 00:45:01,328
A storm rises in my heart.
A hurricane.

305
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:07,631
You are laughing!

306
00:45:10,538 --> 00:45:12,451
And I am screaming like mad.

307
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:21,273
Go away from here! Go. Go.

308
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,776
My queen!

309
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:32,787
My queen!

310
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:38,928
My queen!

311
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:48,095
What was that Laila? What was it?

312
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,690
Don't worry, my queen?

313
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:53,307
When love remains incomplete..

314
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,447
It expresses itself as madness.

315
00:45:55,527 --> 00:45:59,448
All this false.
I am not in love with Samson.

316
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:08,032
And if I am in love with
Samson then I will destroy it.

317
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:11,751
I will erase the name
of Samson from my life.

318
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:13,157
My queen!

319
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:20,962
But I can't forget
Samson till he is alive.

320
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:28,130
But once Samson is dead,
even my love for him will die.

321
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:36,717
No, my queen a man's
death doesn't kill his love.

322
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:40,554
Love is immortal.

323
00:47:01,284 --> 00:47:02,906
Save me!

324
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,622
Save me!

325
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:07,779
You?

326
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:11,117
There was storm last night, right?

327
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:17,252
Yes, my queen,
there was huge storm last night.

328
00:55:19,523 --> 00:55:21,050
What are you thinking?

329
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,361
Nothing. I want to go now.

330
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:28,293
Come, I will see you off.

331
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:52,562
Nothing. Just sprained my foot.

332
00:58:37,203 --> 00:58:39,554
"I need to tell you something."

333
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:42,000
"Let me speak with my eyes."

334
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,487
"I need to tell you something."

335
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,879
"Let me speak with my eyes."

336
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:52,055
"Restlessness will
increase so leave it."

337
00:58:52,379 --> 00:58:54,501
"I need to tell you something."

338
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:56,703
"Let me speak with my eyes."

339
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:17,366
"My love, don't eye this crazy man."

340
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:22,258
"You are my lover and my darling."

341
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:29,758
"Don't stare down a crazy lover,
O dear."

342
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:34,974
"You are my lover and my darling."

343
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:39,190
"But if you don't understand me then."

344
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,939
"I need to tell you something."

345
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:44,399
"Let me speak with my eyes."

346
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:49,303
"Restlessness will
increase so leave it."

347
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,682
"I need to tell you something."

348
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,952
"Let me speak with my eyes."

349
01:00:09,748 --> 01:00:14,802
"The nice breeze and wind."

350
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:19,504
"Restlessness adds fun in love."

351
01:00:22,504 --> 01:00:27,274
"The nice breeze and wind."

352
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:31,869
"Restlessness adds fun in love."

353
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:36,788
"Come and tell me the story of love."

354
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:39,180
"I need to tell you something."

355
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,586
"Let me speak with my eyes."

356
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:46,423
"Restlessness will
increase so leave it."

357
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:48,816
"I need to tell you something."

358
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:51,803
"Let me speak with my eyes."

359
01:01:06,451 --> 01:01:11,289
"The season is filled
with colors of love."

360
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:16,680
"The season stopped when it saw us."

361
01:01:18,748 --> 01:01:23,667
"The season is filled
with colors of love."

362
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:28,546
"The season stopped when it saw us."

363
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:33,383
"And if the season also
considers us to be crazy."

364
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:35,857
"I need to tell you something."

365
01:01:35,937 --> 01:01:38,222
"Let me speak with my eyes."

366
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:43,168
"Restlessness will
increase so leave it."

367
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:45,532
"I need to tell you something."

368
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:48,991
"Let me speak with my eyes."

369
01:01:52,032 --> 01:01:55,438
The queen has returned to the palace.

370
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,329
Please excuse my impertinence.

371
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,180
Laila has been seen
with a strange man.

372
01:02:01,977 --> 01:02:04,707
With a stranger? Go.

373
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:15,410
What will happen now, Salukh?

374
01:02:15,978 --> 01:02:19,667
Don't worry.
Nobody can hurt you till I am here.

375
01:02:19,856 --> 01:02:21,491
I am not worried about myself Salukh.

376
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,004
We have to leave.

377
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:27,186
Because only men are punished
for crimes in Husnabad.

378
01:02:27,928 --> 01:02:31,509
- Please leave at once.
- No, Laila. I have decided today.

379
01:02:31,766 --> 01:02:33,239
I am not leaving without you.

380
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:34,834
Why don't you understand, Salukh?

381
01:02:34,914 --> 01:02:38,942
It's about your life.
Rashid will arrest you, Salukh.

382
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,239
- Leave from here. At once.
- No, Laila. No.

383
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:47,604
- I cannot leave you.
- Salukh, for the sake of my love.

384
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:49,834
Salukh, for Laila's sake, go away.

385
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:09,725
Laila! You here.
Arrest her. Take her away.

386
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:30,739
Set the fire.
He should escape. Set the fire.

387
01:03:38,604 --> 01:03:42,293
Unlucky girl,
you did a commit a mistake.

388
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:46,712
But you are a woman
and women are protected..

389
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:49,118
By Lord Mukkadas.

390
01:04:05,022 --> 01:04:08,090
If a man was not present
in a woman's life..

391
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,495
She would have never
committed the crime.

392
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:14,644
Not you but that young
man is responsible..

393
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:17,239
For your crime who has egged you on.

394
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:21,117
Tell me, who was that
man who came to meet you?

395
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:31,063
Speak girl. Why are you silent?

396
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,199
That young man is the real culprit.

397
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:46,888
And you know where that culprit is.

398
01:04:47,808 --> 01:04:50,173
If you refuse to tell
us his whereabouts..

399
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:52,173
Then how will the
culprit be punished?

400
01:04:52,903 --> 01:04:55,133
Don't you know where he is?

401
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:58,444
Don't you know who
he is and where he stays?

402
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:02,578
I do but I won't tell you.

403
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:05,051
Do you know the outcome?

404
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:10,578
Outcome. I also know the outcome.

405
01:05:13,173 --> 01:05:15,632
I am in love, Ustad Rashid.

406
01:05:16,781 --> 01:05:18,659
And if it is a crime to love..

407
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:22,538
- Than I will commit this crime again and again.
- Laila!

408
01:05:24,808 --> 01:05:31,064
Laila is a woman.
And a woman is bound to love.

409
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:32,740
That is false.

410
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:36,983
I don't want you to decided
what is true and what is false.

411
01:05:43,051 --> 01:05:47,875
Even the queen cannot decide
against the law of Husnabad.

412
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:57,146
I leave this decision on you,
my queen.

413
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,024
Because you are a woman

414
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:02,903
and only woman can
understand another woman.

415
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:04,430
Laila!

416
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:10,038
My queen,
isn't it true that a woman's life..

417
01:06:10,118 --> 01:06:12,024
Starts and ends in love?

418
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:18,241
My queen, is it false that
love is the biggest strength..

419
01:06:18,525 --> 01:06:20,930
And the biggest weakness
in a woman's life?

420
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:26,754
My queen, if love is
removed from a woman's life..

421
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,943
Then what is left in it?

422
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:34,930
Please decide, my queen.
Why are you silent?

423
01:06:35,984 --> 01:06:41,025
Decision. Lord Mukkadas will decide.

424
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:47,390
Lord Mukkadas,
only you have the right to decide..

425
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:51,457
Against a woman in
this chaste land of women.

426
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:57,336
This accused girl who
is standing in front of you..

427
01:06:57,728 --> 01:07:00,038
With a bowed head
want you to decide.

428
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:05,497
If you want me to forgive
her than shower rain.

429
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:10,160
And if you want to punish
her then shower fire.

430
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:31,447
Lord Mukkadas has decided.
Take her away.

431
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,705
And this unlucky girl
will be thrown in front of..

432
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:36,988
The scary beast at sunrise tomorrow.

433
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,204
My queen!

434
01:08:06,974 --> 01:08:10,947
You didn't need to exert
yourself for your maid, my queen.

435
01:08:11,866 --> 01:08:14,460
Laila, you are my special maid.

436
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:17,299
I will miss you a lot.

437
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:20,380
That's why I have come to
tell you to stop being stubborn.

438
01:08:20,703 --> 01:08:23,054
And tell us the name
of that unlucky young man..

439
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:26,136
Who had come to break
the laws of Husnabad.

440
01:08:26,676 --> 01:08:29,270
Thank you for your advice, my queen.

441
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:34,178
But I am no so selfish
that to save my own life..

442
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:37,503
I will not endanger my lover's life.

443
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:40,502
I am helpless, my queen.

444
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:43,867
The lover you are
risking your life for..

445
01:08:44,435 --> 01:08:46,651
Should also care for you.

446
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:51,489
My queen I cannot tell
you how much he loves me.

447
01:08:52,746 --> 01:08:56,057
If I had not made him
swear on my life and love..

448
01:08:56,786 --> 01:08:59,151
Then he would have never left me.

449
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:04,935
All women are fooled when
they are blindfolded by love.

450
01:09:05,636 --> 01:09:07,690
If I am being fooled, my queen..

451
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:12,772
Than I wish to
be a fool for evermore.

452
01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:15,678
May I get a thousand such live..

453
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:19,948
Which I can sacrifice for my lover.

454
01:09:21,462 --> 01:09:22,597
Laila!

455
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:27,138
I pray that even you
are blindfolded by love.

456
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:32,975
So that instead of seeing
this hard cruel world..

457
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:38,015
You are able to see
that glorious world of love..

458
01:09:38,692 --> 01:09:41,273
Which is already
there in your heart.

459
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:44,544
- My heart?
- Yes, my queen.

460
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:48,124
Instead of being in
this wonderful world..

461
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:52,246
You are struggling in
a world with darkness everywhere.

462
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:56,962
You're like the lost traveller
in a desert ..

463
01:09:57,354 --> 01:09:59,489
Who has never seen greenery.

464
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:02,889
You are hungry and thirsty
since you have grown up.

465
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:06,064
- Laila!
- Laila is about to die, my queen.

466
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:08,119
That's why she has become so brave.

467
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:10,470
After hearing this you
can punish me even further.

468
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,160
But today I need to
tell you that the rules..

469
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,322
Of your kingdom
is against human nature.

470
01:10:15,402 --> 01:10:18,917
This kingdom is a sand
castle who has empty foundations.

471
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:22,660
And remember that
no one will be able..

472
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:25,471
To save it from the
hurricane of love. No one.

473
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:28,646
Neither Ustad Rashid
nor Lord Mukkadas.

474
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:30,660
Laila!

475
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:13,173
Laila! Laila!

476
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:15,052
Who are you?

477
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:18,714
I am Salukh.
I had come to meet Laila yesterday.

478
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:23,551
- Laila is innocent.
- Salukh! Salukh!

479
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:27,132
What have you done, Salukh?
I made you swear.

480
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:29,916
Ustad. Ustad. He is innocent.

481
01:11:29,996 --> 01:11:34,200
I had gone to meet him.
He is lying. Forgive him.

482
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:38,781
No, he is lying.
I had come to meet her.

483
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:40,645
And I am the culprit.

484
01:11:40,725 --> 01:11:43,659
Arrest him. He is the real criminal.

485
01:11:44,078 --> 01:11:45,646
So Laila should be released.

486
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,240
He will have to face the beast.

487
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:54,821
No! No! My queen.
No, my queen. No, my queen.

488
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:56,659
Salukh is completely innocent.

489
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:00,565
It is not his fault. I promise you.

490
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:04,929
He won't break your law anymore.
Forgive him.

491
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:10,997
Why don't you speak?
Why are you silent?

492
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:13,051
Say something, my queen.

493
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,295
The queen cannot do anything
even if she wants to.

494
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,998
The one who has broken
the law will be punished.

495
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:22,538
Will be punished?

496
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:28,282
Laila, I am helpless.

497
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:30,660
Helpless?

498
01:12:31,863 --> 01:12:34,336
If you are helpless
then why are you a queen?

499
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:37,066
If you cannot forgive anyone then..

500
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:39,890
- Why are you sitting on the throne?
- Laila!

501
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:45,080
Take away this insolent girl
so that she can disrupt our justice.

502
01:12:46,486 --> 01:12:51,513
No, my queen.
Salukh is innocent. Let him go.

503
01:12:51,593 --> 01:12:55,121
He is innocent.
Let Salukh go, my queen.

504
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:58,796
- Salukh! Let him go.
- Laila.

505
01:12:58,985 --> 01:13:01,580
He is innocent.

506
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:05,796
Salukh. My queen, this is cruelty.

507
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:32,607
Samson!

508
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:56,417
Samson!

509
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:54,641
The enemy used to be at bay
till ferocious beast was alive.

510
01:16:55,953 --> 01:16:59,304
His death has hurt our strength.

511
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:04,628
Friendship has lessened.
Enmity has increased.

512
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:09,574
Forgive my impertinence, sir.
We don't lack of friends.

513
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:13,817
Kaladev, who is more powerful than..

514
01:17:14,115 --> 01:17:16,196
Ferocious beast
is under your control.

515
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:22,521
It can kill Samson in a moment.

516
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:26,845
Well done, Dokiya. Very good idea.

517
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,128
Kaladev.

518
01:17:34,398 --> 01:17:36,655
- Kaladev.
- Yes.

519
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:39,398
- What do you want?
- Freedom.

520
01:17:39,843 --> 01:17:42,546
- Will you follow my order?
- I will.

521
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:45,870
- Will you kill the person I want you to kill?
- I will.

522
01:17:46,073 --> 01:17:49,695
Then go.
Go and kill Samson in the forest.

523
01:17:50,113 --> 01:17:54,600
You will be freed as
soon as he is dead. Go!

524
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:01,084
Sir, he is dead. No problem.

525
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:04,584
- We still have a stronger...
- Dokiya!

526
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:10,205
We will have to use our
brains instead of strength now.

527
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:13,948
- Got it?
- Hail my lord.

528
01:22:15,258 --> 01:22:18,312
Queen Sheba is going outside.

529
01:22:18,637 --> 01:22:22,164
She is surely going to meet Samson.
Let her go.

530
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:26,070
If all targets want to be
trapped together then let them.

531
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:29,638
Everyone will be killed
by Rashid with just one move.

532
01:22:30,435 --> 01:22:33,381
I am alone in this
huge kingdom, Samson.

533
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:39,056
Rashid had enchanted everyone
into listening to him.

534
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:43,624
- No one listens to me.
- Don't worry, Sheba.

535
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:47,285
Rashid's enchantment
will go against him.

536
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:50,961
And he will be exposed to the world.

537
01:22:51,205 --> 01:22:54,124
Liars will be shamed
and the truthful will be heard.

538
01:22:54,204 --> 01:22:56,273
Hatred will end.

539
01:22:56,475 --> 01:22:58,597
And love will smile.

540
01:22:58,935 --> 01:23:00,840
- Love's smile?
- Yes, my queen.

541
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,341
Excuse me my impertinence.

542
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:04,800
You two are strangers
in the world of love.

543
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:07,895
That's why you didn't
see the show of nature..

544
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:12,598
Which effected the
patients of love. Love!

545
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:49,720
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

546
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:55,288
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

547
01:23:55,747 --> 01:24:01,721
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

548
01:24:01,801 --> 01:24:04,208
"Don't ask me."

549
01:24:04,288 --> 01:24:07,154
"Don't ask me."

550
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:10,356
"What I saw in love."

551
01:24:10,436 --> 01:24:16,478
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

552
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:22,452
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

553
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:33,613
"What did I see in the
face of the pretty girls?"

554
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:36,735
"What did I see?"

555
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:42,330
"Ask me, what did I see?"

556
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:45,952
"What did I see?"

557
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:51,344
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

558
01:24:51,424 --> 01:24:57,493
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

559
01:25:15,858 --> 01:25:21,114
"Everyone just tells the
tale of love for namesake."

560
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:23,830
"Tale of love."

561
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,208
"Tale of love."

562
01:25:27,816 --> 01:25:33,329
"Only loves tell you who is loyal."

563
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:36,207
"Only love tells you."

564
01:25:36,585 --> 01:25:41,436
"I saw every unveiled face."

565
01:25:42,436 --> 01:25:47,625
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

566
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:53,896
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

567
01:26:12,288 --> 01:26:17,694
"As if I was being
resurrected by a voice."

568
01:26:17,774 --> 01:26:23,424
"By a voice. By a voice."

569
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:29,168
"The world changes
according to your outlook."

570
01:26:29,248 --> 01:26:32,411
"According to your outlook."

571
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:35,736
"The one whom I though
was the killer..

572
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:38,236
Proved to be the savior."

573
01:26:38,316 --> 01:26:44,155
"What did I see in the
face of the pretty girls?"

574
01:26:44,952 --> 01:26:50,722
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

575
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:16,453
"You try to be smart and strong."

576
01:27:16,642 --> 01:27:22,345
"But as soon as you get
a glimpse you become nervous."

577
01:27:22,425 --> 01:27:24,723
"Where is your heart lost?"

578
01:27:24,803 --> 01:27:28,277
"Lost. Where is your heart lost?"

579
01:27:28,357 --> 01:27:30,291
"The lips are blossoming."

580
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:34,021
"Blossoming. The lips are blossoming."

581
01:27:34,101 --> 01:27:39,778
"A face was also
engulfed with desires."

582
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:44,777
"We even saw some
desires in your eyes."

583
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:50,751
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

584
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:57,210
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

585
01:28:17,371 --> 01:28:20,141
"I speak what I've seen."

586
01:28:20,221 --> 01:28:22,952
"Then what is false?"

587
01:28:23,032 --> 01:28:26,019
"If it is a flower
it will emit fragrance."

588
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:28,844
"Of it is an ember
it is bound to kindle."

589
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:31,317
"Look at your own behavior."

590
01:28:31,397 --> 01:28:34,628
"Look. Look at your own behavior."

591
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,871
"Look at the mirror."

592
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:40,330
"Look. Look at the mirror."

593
01:28:40,573 --> 01:28:43,370
"You have got such a face."

594
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:46,222
"How are the eyes to be blamed?"

595
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:51,290
"Darling, I saw you as you are."

596
01:28:57,129 --> 01:29:02,724
"When love lived in my heart,
everything fell into place."

597
01:29:02,933 --> 01:29:08,635
"This is small miracle of love."

598
01:29:08,715 --> 01:29:13,662
"Forget flowers.
Even thorns look pretty."

599
01:29:13,742 --> 01:29:16,513
"Even thorns look pretty."

600
01:29:16,593 --> 01:29:19,594
"Even thorns look pretty."

601
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:25,149
"The one where we looked
with love is my darling."

602
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:28,068
"That's my darling."

603
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:31,554
"The one whom I thought
was a stranger..

604
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:33,756
Proved to be a close one."

605
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:39,500
"Don't ask me, what I saw in love."

606
01:29:40,297 --> 01:29:45,445
"I saw the show enacted
by God's nature."

607
01:30:08,702 --> 01:30:10,040
Look at this.

608
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:13,783
Poison from 21 different
poisonous snakes.

609
01:30:14,932 --> 01:30:19,769
Forget having it.
Men will die even after touching it.

610
01:30:21,283 --> 01:30:22,594
Very good.

611
01:30:24,323 --> 01:30:29,918
Samson's death will be the
death of Rashid's biggest enemy.

612
01:30:31,377 --> 01:30:35,566
And Salukh's death
will be Rashid's life.

613
01:30:45,444 --> 01:30:47,011
My queen!

614
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:55,078
You want to ask me where I was. Right?

615
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:58,268
- I had gone to meet Samson.
- I know.

616
01:30:58,713 --> 01:31:01,010
Now you will ask me, why did I go?

617
01:31:01,254 --> 01:31:05,362
I will only tell you that
it was important for me to go there.

618
01:31:05,753 --> 01:31:10,551
Isn't it my duty to thank the person..

619
01:31:10,835 --> 01:31:12,997
Who freed Husnabad
from the ferocious beast.

620
01:31:13,227 --> 01:31:16,524
This was not only yours
but the entire nation's duty.

621
01:31:16,862 --> 01:31:19,524
But you didn't need
to go there for that.

622
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:22,794
I will decide what I
need to do and what I don't.

623
01:31:25,307 --> 01:31:29,970
It is not enough for
you to go there and thank him.

624
01:31:30,442 --> 01:31:34,861
- We should have done more for him.
- What?

625
01:31:35,186 --> 01:31:37,848
Rashid has done what
needed to be done.

626
01:31:38,227 --> 01:31:42,781
I have invited Samson and
Salukh on behalf of Husnabad.

627
01:31:43,092 --> 01:31:46,578
There will be a huge
celebration in their honor.

628
01:31:46,943 --> 01:31:52,740
And we will entertain
and thank the two brave men.

629
01:31:53,686 --> 01:31:55,105
What are you saying?

630
01:31:55,185 --> 01:31:58,146
Rashid always tells the truth.

631
01:31:58,551 --> 01:32:00,645
A friend is not always a friend.

632
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:02,875
And an enemy is also
never always an enemy.

633
01:32:06,848 --> 01:32:08,078
Strange!

634
01:32:55,659 --> 01:33:03,659
"Darling we have become crazy
after looking into your eyes."

635
01:33:03,942 --> 01:33:11,942
"Darling we have become crazy
after looking into your eyes."

636
01:33:37,428 --> 01:33:44,914
"When I tried to control
myself I lost myself even more."

637
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:55,861
"When I tried to control
myself I lost myself even more."

638
01:33:56,091 --> 01:34:03,253
"Though I am not but am
still fragrant with your love."

639
01:34:04,374 --> 01:34:08,591
"I became good wine."

640
01:34:08,671 --> 01:34:16,671
"I became good wine when
I saw your eyes, darling."

641
01:34:17,008 --> 01:34:25,008
"Darling we have become crazy
after looking into your eyes."

642
01:34:25,225 --> 01:34:28,227
"We have become crazy."

643
01:34:54,322 --> 01:35:01,998
"When I looked into your
eyes my beating heart hurt me."

644
01:35:04,674 --> 01:35:12,647
"When I looked into your
eyes my beating heart hurt me."

645
01:35:13,026 --> 01:35:20,688
"When I tried to heal it,
the heart set me on fire."

646
01:35:21,228 --> 01:35:23,458
"I became very restless."

647
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:33,634
"I became very restless,
when I saw your eyes, darling."

648
01:35:33,889 --> 01:35:41,889
"Darling we have become crazy
after looking into your eyes."

649
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:45,646
"We have become crazy."

650
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:11,052
"There is no one
like me in this world."

651
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:14,646
"You can listen to a thousand tales."

652
01:36:17,323 --> 01:36:21,391
"There is no one
like me in this world."

653
01:36:21,471 --> 01:36:25,121
"You can listen to a thousand tales."

654
01:36:25,459 --> 01:36:32,296
"I had a lot of lovers,
but I am still crazy about you."

655
01:36:33,796 --> 01:36:36,243
"I became everyone's answer."

656
01:36:38,162 --> 01:36:42,094
"Darling I became everyone's answer..

657
01:36:42,174 --> 01:36:46,202
After looking into your eyes."

658
01:36:46,282 --> 01:36:54,282
"Darling we have become crazy
after looking into your eyes."

659
01:36:54,554 --> 01:36:57,973
"We have become crazy."

660
01:37:00,838 --> 01:37:02,473
Brave Samson.

661
01:37:03,257 --> 01:37:04,973
And young Salukh.

662
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:09,486
The queen is very pleased
with your bravery.

663
01:37:09,797 --> 01:37:13,324
That's why she wants
to honor you by offering..

664
01:37:13,622 --> 01:37:16,960
This Mukkadas water
from Lord Mukkadas.

665
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:19,311
Please have it.

666
01:37:28,771 --> 01:37:31,217
I only believe in my god.

667
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:34,258
But on the interest
of other people's beliefs..

668
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:37,298
I accept the water
from Lord Mukkadas.

669
01:37:39,082 --> 01:37:40,609
Stop Salukh!

670
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:44,352
Let me have it first.

671
01:38:51,732 --> 01:38:55,583
You tried to kill me after
inviting me to the royal palace.

672
01:38:55,907 --> 01:38:57,515
Then in the jungle.

673
01:38:57,826 --> 01:39:00,245
And today you tried to
poison me with Mukkadas water.

674
01:39:00,325 --> 01:39:02,137
- Come Salukh.
- Samson!

675
01:39:02,366 --> 01:39:03,609
- Samson!
- My queen!

676
01:39:03,689 --> 01:39:05,177
Get out of my way!

677
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:12,663
Samson!

678
01:39:14,352 --> 01:39:15,555
Samson!

679
01:39:22,243 --> 01:39:25,811
Samson! I am innocent, Samson.

680
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:28,933
Ustad Rashid is responsible for this.

681
01:39:29,906 --> 01:39:37,906
I assure you that
I punish Rashid harshly.

682
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:45,554
- Samson! Don't you believe me?
- Come Salukh.

683
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:50,176
- Samson! Samson!
- My queen. My queen.

684
01:39:58,054 --> 01:39:59,959
You are the queen of Husnabad

685
01:40:00,337 --> 01:40:04,580
It doesn't befit you running
after a layman like crazy.

686
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,986
Rashid, I arrest you
on the charges of trying..

687
01:40:08,066 --> 01:40:11,053
To poison 2 men with Mukkadas water.

688
01:40:13,486 --> 01:40:16,256
- Orders should be followed.
- They won't be.

689
01:40:16,554 --> 01:40:19,649
Why not? I am the queen here.

690
01:40:19,838 --> 01:40:21,703
I am the priest of Lord Mukkadas.

691
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:25,270
I neither believe in
Lord Mukkadas or his priest.

692
01:40:25,756 --> 01:40:30,175
Now I believe in only one god,
the god of love.

693
01:40:30,594 --> 01:40:35,080
There is god but the god of love.
Otherwise no god.

694
01:40:35,458 --> 01:40:38,283
Love is god and god is love.

695
01:40:38,363 --> 01:40:40,094
Sheba, don't say so.

696
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,080
Lord Mukkadas will be angry with you.

697
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,621
- I don't care.
- Sheba!

698
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:20,622
My queen! My queen!

699
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:24,419
My queen! My queen!

700
01:41:25,095 --> 01:41:27,446
My queen,
our settlements have caught fire.

701
01:41:27,526 --> 01:41:30,217
All water has dried up but
the fire is not getting extinguished.

702
01:41:30,297 --> 01:41:32,771
He queen has started this fire.

703
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,360
It won't be extinguished by water.

704
01:41:34,675 --> 01:41:38,851
Please save our property
otherwise we will all ruin you.

705
01:41:38,931 --> 01:41:42,580
We will destroy the
one who destroyed us. Come.

706
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:45,053
Stop. This is the queen.

707
01:41:45,526 --> 01:41:47,675
There is no time
to think now my queen.

708
01:41:47,755 --> 01:41:49,891
Say sorry to Lord
Mukkadas immediately.

709
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:52,337
No, I haven't committed any mistake.

710
01:41:52,797 --> 01:41:54,716
- I haven't committed any mistake.
- Queen.

711
01:41:54,796 --> 01:41:56,500
- I haven't committed any mistake.
- Stop.

712
01:41:57,567 --> 01:42:00,770
I am sorry for the queen's mistake.

713
01:42:01,229 --> 01:42:04,959
Lord Mukkadas will surely help us.

714
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:07,297
She will not punish
his innocent subjects..

715
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:09,797
For the queen's mistake.

716
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:15,959
He will be kind enough
to rain us with benevolence.

717
01:42:16,595 --> 01:42:18,554
Pray with me.

718
01:42:22,838 --> 01:42:28,703
Lord Mukkdas. Forgive the queen.

719
01:42:29,878 --> 01:42:32,041
Shower us with your benevolence!

720
01:42:33,108 --> 01:42:35,284
Shower us with your benevolence!

721
01:42:35,514 --> 01:42:37,500
Shower us with your benevolence!

722
01:42:58,866 --> 01:43:01,231
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

723
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:03,447
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

724
01:43:03,527 --> 01:43:05,920
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

725
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,717
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

726
01:43:09,014 --> 01:43:11,744
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

727
01:43:11,824 --> 01:43:14,379
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

728
01:43:14,459 --> 01:43:17,041
- Ustad Rashid!
- Hail him.

729
01:43:17,785 --> 01:43:22,055
May the queen always rule.
Don't worry about all this.

730
01:43:22,135 --> 01:43:24,960
The queen no longer rules, Laila.

731
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:32,136
Today the queen has become
Rashid's puppet, Laila.

732
01:43:32,393 --> 01:43:33,663
Don't say so.

733
01:43:33,743 --> 01:43:37,488
Rashid rules Husnabad and not Sheba.

734
01:43:39,203 --> 01:43:43,379
It seems that even Lord Mukkadas...

735
01:43:50,433 --> 01:43:51,976
Lifeless stone idols
can neither be owned..

736
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,771
Nor can they own anyone.

737
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:56,825
Rashid is actually
strengthening himself..

738
01:43:57,136 --> 01:43:59,176
By saying it's Lord Mukkadas.

739
01:43:59,757 --> 01:44:02,879
Yes, my queen,
I have come to warn you.

740
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:05,595
Rashid is not your
friend but your enemy.

741
01:44:05,675 --> 01:44:11,433
He has made Samson hate
you so that he doesn't help you.

742
01:44:11,676 --> 01:44:13,960
So that he can achieve what he wants.

743
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,270
Why don't you tell this
to your friend, Samson?

744
01:44:16,946 --> 01:44:18,892
I have already convinced Samson,
my queen.

745
01:44:19,081 --> 01:44:20,446
Now I have come to convince you.

746
01:44:21,419 --> 01:44:23,324
Salukh
- My queen.

747
01:44:23,649 --> 01:44:26,257
You have responsibilities as a queen.

748
01:44:26,513 --> 01:44:28,622
Try to understand
your responsibilities.

749
01:44:29,095 --> 01:44:30,771
And don't think that you are alone.

750
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:33,081
Both me and Samson are with you.

751
01:44:33,461 --> 01:44:36,109
And since you are true,
even God is there with you.

752
01:44:36,555 --> 01:44:38,028
- Good bye.
- Catch him.

753
01:44:58,218 --> 01:45:02,771
The victim has been caught.
Arrest him.

754
01:45:42,853 --> 01:45:44,704
I have found you after 20 years.

755
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:48,461
I will cut you into pieces.

756
01:45:54,746 --> 01:45:57,597
What are you doing here? Go.

757
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,867
Go and bring prince Salukh to me,
alive or dead.

758
01:46:00,947 --> 01:46:02,043
Go.

759
01:46:06,354 --> 01:46:08,556
I haven't come here to fight with you.

760
01:46:09,016 --> 01:46:11,178
But I have come here
to strike a deal, Samson.

761
01:46:11,664 --> 01:46:13,408
- Deal?
- Yes.

762
01:46:13,732 --> 01:46:16,528
The world says I'm evil.

763
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:20,367
Everybody wants to live
a life of comfort..

764
01:46:20,733 --> 01:46:22,910
Irrespective of whether their
intentions are good or bad.

765
01:46:22,934 --> 01:46:26,598
Everyone wants to lead
a life of comfort and respect.

766
01:46:26,896 --> 01:46:28,301
Even I want that.

767
01:46:28,504 --> 01:46:32,396
And that's why the bad has
come to strike a deal with good.

768
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,180
I didn't understand you.

769
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:41,666
You have physical
strength but no brains.

770
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:46,612
I don't brains which
lead people into wrong paths.

771
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:50,613
Destroy humanity and
rob of their goodness.

772
01:46:51,154 --> 01:46:53,303
You are not human but a devil.

773
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:57,194
Not I but you are the devil, Samson.

774
01:46:57,627 --> 01:47:00,181
You had disrupted
the peace of Husnabad.

775
01:47:00,775 --> 01:47:03,370
You have taught the people
there to cry and to be in pain.

776
01:47:03,789 --> 01:47:08,289
Nobody had dared to even
mention love till date in Husnabad.

777
01:47:08,668 --> 01:47:13,019
But Husnabad's peace was
disrupted as soon as you entered.

778
01:47:13,452 --> 01:47:15,965
You had destroyed the world..

779
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:19,208
I had taken 20 years to create. Why?

780
01:47:19,288 --> 01:47:22,600
What did I do to you that
you wasted all my efforts?

781
01:47:22,939 --> 01:47:25,628
Wrong! I have done
nothing of that sort.

782
01:47:26,142 --> 01:47:28,182
In fact you have
killed millions of men..

783
01:47:28,262 --> 01:47:29,817
Who used to live in Husnabad.

784
01:47:30,209 --> 01:47:32,223
Killed humane emotions.

785
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,736
Rashid, god has not
given you power and honor..

786
01:47:37,114 --> 01:47:38,790
For you to be cruel to his subjects.

787
01:47:39,425 --> 01:47:42,223
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

788
01:47:42,303 --> 01:47:44,587
God has given me everything.
You tell me.

789
01:47:44,844 --> 01:47:46,128
Why have you come to me?

790
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:48,952
I have come to tell you
to move out from my path.

791
01:47:49,466 --> 01:47:51,763
Stop supporting my enemies.

792
01:47:52,209 --> 01:47:54,128
And in return if you
want you can also take..

793
01:47:54,331 --> 01:47:56,791
The Queen of Husnabad, Sheba.

794
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:58,845
But you will have
to take her far away.

795
01:47:58,925 --> 01:48:01,966
Husnabad is mine.
I want it to be mine always.

796
01:48:02,046 --> 01:48:05,426
Rashid, Husnabad will always
belong to its rightful rulers.

797
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:08,899
I have decided not
to let you live in peace.

798
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:12,007
Bad and good has never
reached a compromise.

799
01:48:13,033 --> 01:48:14,493
Think about it again, Samson.

800
01:48:14,573 --> 01:48:15,966
I have told you what I wanted to.

801
01:48:16,263 --> 01:48:18,209
- So is this your final decision?
- Yes.

802
01:48:18,641 --> 01:48:19,750
Do you know the outcome?

803
01:48:20,505 --> 01:48:24,478
Rashid, truth never fears outcomes.

804
01:48:26,924 --> 01:48:28,181
I will see you.

805
01:48:43,736 --> 01:48:46,830
Salukh! Salukh dear!

806
01:50:36,344 --> 01:50:44,344
Lord Mukkadas,
I have come to complain to you today.

807
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:50,939
If you are light then
why are we in darkness?

808
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,817
Why is love a sin for us?

809
01:50:56,465 --> 01:51:00,249
Why does fire start whenever..

810
01:51:01,033 --> 01:51:02,736
A woman of Husnabad falls in love?

811
01:51:03,709 --> 01:51:05,384
Why is there a storm?

812
01:51:52,262 --> 01:51:55,087
My queen! My queen!

813
01:51:55,722 --> 01:51:57,006
What is the matter, Laila?

814
01:51:57,249 --> 01:52:01,168
I was praying to Lord Mukkadas.

815
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,303
When Ustad Rashid entered..

816
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:07,411
The prayer room like a thief. I hid.

817
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,803
Ustad Rashid moved
towards the lord's idol..

818
01:52:12,762 --> 01:52:14,505
And then he disappeared suddenly.

819
01:52:14,803 --> 01:52:19,113
Strange! I don't think
this is Lord Mukkadas' doing.

820
01:52:19,641 --> 01:52:21,465
Even I doubt Rashid.

821
01:52:22,627 --> 01:52:25,357
My queen, even I doubt him.

822
01:52:32,776 --> 01:52:34,627
Brother, no matter what you say.

823
01:52:34,897 --> 01:52:36,142
I am sure the queen
was also part of the plan..

824
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:37,519
Of poisoning you.

825
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:41,884
- That is impossible.
- Danger! Danger!

826
01:52:41,964 --> 01:52:44,208
We have been sent by Sheba,
Queen of Husnabad.

827
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,735
Why? Does she want
to poison him again?

828
01:52:46,815 --> 01:52:49,438
Rashid is troubling the queen a lot.

829
01:52:50,411 --> 01:52:52,316
So Rashid has stooped so low.

830
01:52:53,505 --> 01:52:56,397
But how can we believe
that queen Sheba has sent you?

831
01:52:56,586 --> 01:52:58,330
Please take this ring as a symbol.

832
01:53:02,127 --> 01:53:05,302
And today the queen will be
at the lakeside at midnight tonight.

833
01:53:06,127 --> 01:53:09,046
- She is coming.
- Okay, I will be there.

834
01:53:09,126 --> 01:53:12,100
Brother, why are you
trying to fall into danger?

835
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:15,452
- Don't go, brother.
- I have promised. I will have to go.

836
01:53:15,654 --> 01:53:18,033
You will have to fulfill your promise.

837
01:55:55,953 --> 01:55:57,629
My target.

838
01:55:58,048 --> 01:56:00,426
You stayed hidden
from me for 20 years.

839
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:04,778
20 years. I don't understand.

840
01:56:05,102 --> 01:56:07,764
You don't need to
understand now, Salukh.

841
01:56:08,197 --> 01:56:10,670
You only have some
moment of life death.

842
01:56:11,238 --> 01:56:14,400
I don't care about life or death.

843
01:56:15,035 --> 01:56:17,629
But I want to know
why you are after me.

844
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:22,548
Shall I tell you?

845
01:56:22,899 --> 01:56:28,764
A dying man's last wish
is always fulfilled. Listen.

846
01:56:29,425 --> 01:56:32,898
The mark on your
back is the royal mark.

847
01:56:33,358 --> 01:56:34,966
And that is why you are going to die.

848
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:39,668
- Royal mark on my back!
- Yes.

849
01:56:40,236 --> 01:56:42,817
You are the real heir of Husnabad.

850
01:56:44,844 --> 01:56:46,952
I am the real heir of Husnabad.

851
01:56:47,290 --> 01:56:48,628
Then who is Sheba?

852
01:56:48,708 --> 01:56:51,980
- She is your sister, Salukh.
- Sheba is my sister?

853
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:56,939
Yes, I have found you after
a long time with much difficulty.

854
01:56:57,521 --> 01:57:00,561
Now first you and then queen Sheba.

855
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:22,967
Here. Drink it.

856
01:57:46,534 --> 01:57:47,737
You? And here.

857
01:58:25,871 --> 01:58:29,276
This is poison. And this is the knife.

858
01:58:29,789 --> 01:58:34,221
Some prefer poison to die
while others like the knife.

859
01:58:34,478 --> 01:58:37,275
You can decide. Tell me.

860
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:39,978
Do you want to die
of poison or with a knife?

861
01:58:40,965 --> 01:58:44,343
Tell me. Tell me.

862
01:59:53,611 --> 01:59:55,246
That is sir's voice.

863
02:00:34,327 --> 02:00:38,489
Remove the wood.
Someone fetch the vine.

864
02:00:38,569 --> 02:00:43,313
I am throwing a vine. Hold it.

865
02:00:45,043 --> 02:00:46,475
Got it?

866
02:00:51,191 --> 02:00:53,002
- Got it?
- Yes.

867
02:00:53,529 --> 02:00:55,137
Hold it and come.

868
02:00:57,096 --> 02:01:00,678
Come elephant. Come.

869
02:01:40,988 --> 02:01:42,988
- Where are you going?
- Rashid.

870
02:01:43,326 --> 02:01:47,029
It is difficult to
escape Rashid, Sheba

871
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:49,151
Rashid's game is over.

872
02:01:49,772 --> 02:01:52,407
The secret of fire,
water and wind has been exposed.

873
02:01:52,745 --> 02:01:54,867
You are no longer the
priest of Lord Mukkadas.

874
02:01:55,245 --> 02:01:56,732
You are my prisoner now.

875
02:01:57,907 --> 02:02:00,610
Anyone there? Anyone there?

876
02:02:02,042 --> 02:02:03,272
What is this?

877
02:02:04,961 --> 02:02:06,812
These are my men.

878
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:11,042
Now I am not the
priest of Lord Mukkadas.

879
02:02:11,312 --> 02:02:13,636
I am the king of Husnabad now.

880
02:02:13,716 --> 02:02:16,069
- Traitor!
- Take him away.

881
02:02:22,136 --> 02:02:25,082
Your death is fast approaching.
Pray to your god.

882
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:28,244
Call out for your god of love.

883
02:02:28,554 --> 02:02:32,027
So that your wish to call
out for your god of love..

884
02:02:32,107 --> 02:02:34,554
During your last
moments is fulfilled.

885
02:02:34,892 --> 02:02:40,527
Call out for your god. Call.

886
02:02:40,607 --> 02:02:42,391
Where is your god?

887
02:02:42,471 --> 02:02:44,027
Rashid!

888
02:02:44,635 --> 02:02:45,635

so much strength that..

of criminals like you alone.

892
02:02:56,729 --> 02:02:58,891
Soldiers! Catch him.

893
02:03:11,216 --> 02:03:12,446
