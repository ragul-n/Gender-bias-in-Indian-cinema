00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,430
<i>Won't I able to avoid it?</i>

15
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:57,304
<i>Give me a good life to celebrate,</i>

16
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,809
<i>Does the life have any phase?</i>

Move man.

24
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,169
Move man.

25
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:21,922
You..

26
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,784
Hey! You Ioon.

27
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,158
- What do you think of yourself?
- No Karthik.

28
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,091
See what I'm going to do to you!
Keep quiet man.

29
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:32,265
Speed only matters.
Not knocking

30
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,532
- Keep quiet.
- Look there.

31
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:40,139
- Leave her. - Leave.
- Isn't it you?

32
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,846
<i>Be bold by gaining your strength,
Neither panic nor cry,</i>

33
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:38,820
<i>The Lord your God is ever with you,
9th verse in chapter 1 of Joshua.</i>

34
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:54,606
It's been days, isn't it?

35
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,311
It's been months.

36
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,145
I came to a place.

37
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,284
That place is not as we think.

38
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:19,568
Central jail.

39
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,103
That's a different world.

40
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,710
I was thinking about you only
even over there.

41
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,257
- Tell me man.
- Bring it fast.

42
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:01,133
- Site supervisor Ramesh fell down from top.
- Take him first to a hospital.

43
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,537
Of course I'm sending him there.
I'm just informing this.

44
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,300
Come soon. Go soon.

45
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,540
Ok, I'm coming there.
Cut the call.

46
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:26,821
What's this?
Pouring the water in bucket..!

47
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,624
- It's better to keep as it is
than washing it! -What are you doing?

48
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:35,567
- Now only I cleaned it. - You're always
buying car to the size of this or this!

49
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:38,702
- You don't have style.
- Go.

50
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,472
- Won't all see when I go in a car?
- Yes.

51
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,109
Buy a swift car.
It'll be excellent.

52
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,841
It has two lines like that of a squirrel.

53
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:52,611
- Ok! I'll buy it.
- Wait.

54
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,181
This is what you told earlier.
But didn't buy it.

55
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,050
This time I'll buy it for sure.
Ok, you go, take bath and get ready.

56
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,924
- We've to go to the hospital.
- You go, I'm not coming.

57
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,794
Black colour swift with
lines like squirrel.

58
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:07,933
Ok, I'll buy.

59
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,265
- Then write it and sign.
- On which?

60
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,477
On this. Write and put your sign.

61
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,987
<i>Where have you gone
by making us to lament?</i>

62
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,754
Look at this, he fell down
from the top while working.

63
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,487
What to do?
It has happened so like this!

64
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,061
You place it.

65
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:49,271
Get up and see. Your colleagues have come,
but you're lying like this. My dear!

66
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:55,278
See the extent of his affection on you
that he has fainted.

67
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,586
Is there sugar?

68
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,261
<i>Where have you gone
by making us to lament?</i>

69
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,058
- Hey.
- What?

70
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,463
- Why are you crying now?
- Then what?

71
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,572
Not crying in a funeral house,
will anyone cry in a wedding house?

72
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,468
Look there of how all are crying.
You too cry man.

73
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:41,494
Ilayaraja sir.
Don't play it here.

74
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,366
What an atrocity?

75
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,598
- Hey
- What?

76
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,605
Didn't I say that I hear Ilayaraja's
music when I see a girl?

77
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,668
- She has come.
- Did you hear it. - No.

78
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,676
See there.

79
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,013
Why is she going without informing?
Wait, I'll come.

80
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,682
People don't inform and leave
in the house of bereaved!

81
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,286
Brother, see him.

82
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,390
Come man.

83
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:32,905
How is it?

84
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,610
- Has he gone?
- He has gone.

85
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,210
- What happened to you?
- I struggled a lot.

86
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,288
- Is Sandhya there?
- Sandhya speaking. You?

87
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,158
What hello?
You'll just go by knocking my car.

88
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:54,421
Did you think that I can't find you?

89
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,089
Who are you?
What number do you want?

90
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,497
I've found your number after a long
struggle. Indeed a guy is lying on top.

91
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,436
Ok, leave that.
Did you come to Alwarpet yesterday?

92
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:05,640
Yes, I came.

93
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,167
Did you come near Sanskrit college?

94
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,436
- Where...? Yes!
- Did you come for a death?

95
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,577
Yes, they were known to me.

96
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,053
It was there that you hit me.
You hit my car.

97
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,586
- No.
- What no!

98
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,650
- Ok, where did I hit it?
- You've to come in person

99
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,594
- ...and tell by seeing my dent.
- Ok, I'll come.

100
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:30,957
Who was that over phone?

101
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,002
A guy says that his car is damaged
by the hitting of my car.

102
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,704
- I'll go and see it.
- You've hit it, didn't you?

103
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,130
Why should you go for it?

104
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,603
I'll go in person to see
what the problem is.

105
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,136
- You may come. Come sir.
- Come here.

106
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,477
I am parking.

107
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:51,883
It has hit.

108
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,375
- I only called you.
- You...

109
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,442
- ECR... carting! -That day too
you hit, and today as well!

110
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:22,046
- Where did I hit?
- Look, what has happened!

111
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,989
- Ok, why did you ask me
to come here? - Here!

112
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,056
My mechanic is coming here. Come.
First let's decide by sitting inside.

113
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,196
From outside itself...!

114
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,701
Come.
Take your seat. Be seated.

115
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:46,608
What would you have?
Tea?

116
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,273
- I don't want. - Coffee?
- I'm not used to it.

117
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:54,274
Then have milkshake.
You can't say, you're not used to it!

118
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,882
I couldn't have hit it at all.
I learnt in a good driving school only.

119
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,456
- Indeed I was the first over there.
- Had there been a race over there?

120
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,790
- I don't even walk in one-way road.
- One can walk through a one-way road.

121
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:06,758
It isn't wrong to do so!

122
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:10,523
Leave that.
Tell me how did I knock your car.

123
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,567
- Give me your mobile.
- What for?

124
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,169
- Give me.
- Careful, it's an i-phone

125
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,639
This is your car, and this is mine.

126
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,577
An idiot has parked
before your car like this.

127
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:28,173
Not able to move forward,
you reversed and hit my car.

128
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:32,844
Had my car been reversed, it should've
hit your car at front only, isn't it?

129
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,750
This was actually like this.
This is your car, and this is mine.

130
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:42,520
Now the same idiot has parked
behind your car.

131
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,900
Unable to reverse back, you moved forward
and hit slightly at the left.

132
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,338
You said, I hit to its left. But,
isn't your car dented at the right?

133
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,805
I don't know all that.
You hit while moving front or back!

134
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,474
You're lying.
I couldn't have hit it at all.

135
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,549
Even suppose I had hit it, tell what
I should do. We'll finish the deal.

136
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,114
What are you doing?

137
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:11,956
In which hospital?

138
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,463
I respect doctors well.
I'll solve this dent issue.

139
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,135
You may have this milkshake and go.

140
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,698
I'll come to your hospital
if there's a need.

141
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,879
I don't want.

142
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,746
Oh yuck! I couldn't.

143
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:54,764
- It's been so long, but she hasn't come.
- She'll come. She might be busy.

144
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:58,096
- Is she like you?
- It's all because of you only.

145
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:01,937
- What?
- She's coming.

146
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:03,610
Is she coming?
She is coming.

147
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,949
She hasn't come.

148
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,709
- Do you recognise me?
- Is your car dent ok?

149
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,471
These are my friends.

150
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:45,817
- I want to talk to you alone.
- Tell me, what's the matter?

151
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,782
- I want to talk to her alone.
- Talk buddy.

152
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,985
Alone buddy!

153
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:58,195
- So, is that it?
- That's it.

154
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,097
Didn't you say, you've work?
Go!

155
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,031
- Tell me. - I want to talk
a personal matter.

156
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,510
- Is it on any problem of yours?
- No, not like that.

157
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:16,244
- I don't know how to tell it.
- Shall I fix some other doctor if needed?

158
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,316
I am in pediatric ward.
Tell me without hesitation.

159
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,484
Nothing should be concealed from doctors.
It's ok, tell me.

160
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,193
Shall we talk by having some coffee?

161
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,774
Ok, tell me.
Why have you come here?

162
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,441
I don't fell sleepy during nights.

163
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,111
I feel dark when I close my eyes.

164
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,185
Opening my eyes,
I see fan rotating on top.

165
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,250
Getting up to see the streets,
none is there.

166
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,090
It's just the lamps
that glow flickering

167
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,195
A dog is only barking
at a far distance.

168
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:09,534
Same does happen near
my house at midnight

169
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,870
It was at that time, I gave a thought.

170
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,073
I gave a thought by sitting, lying,
walking and bending.

171
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:20,815
It's only one matter that I see clearly
no matter how I think.

172
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,616
I like you very much.
We'll marry.

173
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,416
That is, I like you very much.
We'll marry.

174
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,427
What do you expect me to say?

175
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:46,168
Tell me that you too like me.
That's all! What do you say?

176
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:47,572
I am leaving.

177
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:28,283
Iman! Come.

178
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,827
Park the car.
I'll be back.

179
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,306
Go and see her.

180
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:59,237
- I would like to see Mr. Naushad.
- He isn't here.

181
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,975
He's not been to office
for quite few days.

182
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,135
My son is gone.

183
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,515
- You..?
- Naveen's dad.

184
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:43,680
You knocked down my wife
and my son with your car.

185
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:54,694
My son is gone.

186
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:06,043
It's case is been dealt in court.
It was an accident.

187
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:10,718
Why have you come here?
This is my office, a place where I work.

188
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:12,977
My son is gone.

189
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,656
Now I'm leaving urgently.
Let's meet later.

190
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:27,998
My son..
My son is gone.

191
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,104
No, I am in an important work.
Yes. Tell it later.

192
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,111
Then?

193
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:13,847
Do you phone through a camera?

194
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:19,921
- Why are you shooting me?
- I'm getting ready from my side.

195
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:26,449
Shouldn't I've at least a passport size
photo if not a big blow up of my fiancee?

196
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,391
It's for this reason only.

197
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,191
Why all of a sudden
you're talking of marriage?

198
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,997
All of a sudden?
I told it that day itself, didn't I?

199
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,366
I'm telling it again by thinking,
that's all!

200
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,661
Do you say like this to any girl you see?

201
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,803
- I tell it only when I see you.
- Why should I marry you?

202
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,613
- You're beautiful.
- I know it.

203
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,049
You're very beautiful even in sorrow.

204
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,354
- You've high tolerance.
- I don't have tolerance at all!

205
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,626
You don't get angry.

206
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,096
You don't know about my anger.
Don't make it known.

207
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:05,896
Ok, leave it.

208
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:10,437
Why shouldn't you marry me?
Just tell one reason for it.

209
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,237
Not one, I've hundred reasons.

210
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:18,937
First, I don't like to marry you.
Rest 99 is too the same only!

211
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,842
Ok, don't you have any other work?

212
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:27,780
I'm an architect. Projects are going on
in Annanagar, T Nagar, and Besant nagar.

213
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,317
I'm actually busy.

214
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,392
- I've many work.
- Ok.

215
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:33,592
This is a hospital.

216
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:34,919
You shouldn't behave like this.

217
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:38,055
I'm telling you very decently
that you don't come here at all.

218
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:54,015
How are you?

219
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,417
Has your cough gone?
Has it gone?

220
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,085
Ok. Come on.

221
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:08,894
- What happened?
- What are you doing here?

222
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:10,094
Go out first.

223
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:12,962
I want to talk an important matter.
I'll go out after talking.

224
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,327
You'll not believe if I say.
Last night I was sleeping well.

225
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:21,633
Suddenly a sound...! Opened my eyes,
I saw your face spread on the ceiling.

226
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,368
Isn't there a fan in your house?

227
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:31,242
Whenever I see you,
Sir Ilayaraja is playing music in me!

228
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,120
Do you too listen to his music?

229
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,449
M.S. Vishwanathan's music!

230
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,656
So, M.S.V. is playing music in you
whenever you see me?

231
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:50,131
- I'll come later, ok?
- I'll come later, ok?

232
00:29:57,979 --> 00:29:59,708
Do you know how I feel now
when I see you?

233
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:06,279
I feel like 1000's of colourful
butterflies flapping inside me!

234
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,817
How do you feel when you see me?
Any butterfly?

235
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,488
I feel like puking.
Is it enough?

236
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,295
You don't believe it, don't you?

237
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:43,353
How is it?

238
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:45,985
Later.
What's your name?

239
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:52,190
Could you ask this sister to marry me?

240
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,564
- I'll marry you if not her.
- You?

241
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,533
But, you've to wait a while!

242
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,747
I'll marry Sandhya only.
Simply!

243
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,786
Look, aren't you jealous?

244
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,397
You didn't like her say
that she'll marry me.

245
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,360
Why have you brought them for this?

246
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:45,378
<i>Some nights never come to an end,</i>

247
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:49,678
<i>Some dreams will not leave us,</i>

248
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:54,244
<i>Some foot prints never fade off,</i>

249
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:58,515
<i>Some memories never get drowned,</i>

250
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:04,859
<i>It is you who are in my nerve system,</i>

251
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:11,535
<i>It is you who've fondled my eye brows!</i>

252
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:20,403
<i>Some nights never come to an end,</i>

253
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:24,718
<i>Some dreams will not leave us,</i>

254
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:29,145
<i>Some foot prints never fade off,</i>

255
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:33,391
<i>Some memories never get drowned,</i>

256
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:39,894
<i>It is you who are in my nerve system,</i>

257
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:46,434
<i>It is you who've fondled my eye brows!</i>

258
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:20,598
<i>Are you running through
my heart as your path?</i>

259
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,843
<i>Is your feet aching a bit?</i>

260
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:33,412
<i>If you search in my eyes,
you can find your foot prints!</i>

261
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:38,087
<i>I came to understand
the secret of the universe,</i>

262
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:42,352
<i>It was concealed under your saree</i>

263
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,429
<i>Even if I face accidents...</i>

264
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:50,970
<i>Your memories help me to escape,</i>

265
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,901
<i>Telling the truth and feel it,</i>

266
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,974
<i>It is you who are my soul,</i>

267
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:09,654
<i>It is you... it is you... in my nerves!</i>

268
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:18,396
<i>It is you... it is you... in my nerves!</i>

269
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:09,049
My son is gone.
I couldn't be normal.

270
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,184
How are you able to be so?

271
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:17,385
- Why here... could you come in?
- My son is gone.

272
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,695
Dealt in court, the case is over.
I didn't do it on purpose.

273
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:27,433
It happened unwittingly.

274
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,270
Why to my son? Do you know
how all I desired to bring him up?

275
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,405
I thought of making him achieve
of what I couldn't!

276
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:39,476
You broke my desires,
didn't you?

277
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,353
What are you trying to say?
Should I do something?

278
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,015
You don't understand my pain.

279
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,689
Don't come like this again.
It doesn't look good.

280
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,890
You still don't understand my pain.

281
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,829
Ok, what's that
you expect me to do now?

282
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,441
You've to understand my pain.

283
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:12,442
What are you trying to convey?

284
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:14,444
Are you threatening me?

285
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:17,745
You've to understand my pain!

286
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,950
You're talking not knowing
of what you say.

287
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:24,054
Leave.

288
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,587
Taking away that which was with me,
you're scolding me to leave, aren't you?

289
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,457
I'm not scolding.
You are only yelling.

290
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,665
I didn't yell.

291
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:43,207
Go inside.

292
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,841
You're bringing up your son
with extreme care, aren't you?

293
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:58,688
But my son?
I'll separate your son from you.

294
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:01,724
Come.

295
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:08,025
You too lose your son and
come with me to sit in graveyard.

296
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,964
Only then will you know my pain
and understand my agony!

297
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,945
- Go man.
- You should know my pain.

298
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:33,253
No one is there.
It's long since they vacated.

299
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:47,806
Careful!

300
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,682
- Didn't I tell you not to come here?
- I didn't come for you.

301
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,080
I came for Shakti only!

302
00:39:00,655 --> 00:39:02,987
Do you know what happened?
You'll not believe if I say it.

303
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,687
Karthik has full power.
So is why I paint Spiderman on him.

304
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:08,920
- Enough.
- You only asked me to say this.

305
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:12,895
- Go and lie down first.
- Wait.

306
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:17,727
Lot of accidents in me yesterday!
Car and bike were flying.

307
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,629
But nothing happened to me only.

308
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,236
I myself came to know yesterday
that I have so much power.

309
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:28,515
These men like superman, spiderman,
batman, Rajnikanth are there, isn't it?

310
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:31,652
- It's the power like them.
- Why do you say this to me?

311
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:36,584
It's all because of you only. All these
happen in me only after I saw you.

312
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,458
For example, what'll happen
if I jump out of that window?

313
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,660
You'll die.

314
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:47,459
That alone will not happen.
I'll cheat the death itself!

315
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:50,867
Is it?

316
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:54,906
Then do a thing. Go and jump.
Emergency ward is in ground floor only.

317
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:56,200
You'll directly fall over there only.

318
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:58,270
You get the mortuary ready.

319
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:03,373
Phone up to the ward and tell that
a body is coming there directly.

320
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:05,150
Proceed.

321
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,574
I didn't finish my painting.

322
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,521
Tell Krishna.

323
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,150
I've bought 2 tickets for Simbu's film.
You said that you'll pick me up..

324
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,694
I'm going to jump from a building.

325
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,262
When?
Are you going to jump?

326
00:40:54,302 --> 00:40:56,133
- 9th floor?
- Yes.

327
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:58,938
Ok, not for Simbu's film but lets go
for Ajith's film. What do you say?

328
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,470
I'll call you first
immediately after I land down, ok?

329
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:17,149
What, are you playing? I'm telling you
very seriously that I'll jump!

330
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,187
Go and jump.

331
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:24,362
Call senior doctor.

332
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,364
Check the pressure.
Soon.

333
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:14,338
- I never expected this..!
- You go.

334
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:16,813
Don't stand here.

335
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,482
You don't know how important
it's to save a life.

336
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:25,622
Everything is a joke for you.
A fun for you!

337
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:27,958
Go first.

338
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:36,627
What for are you still standing here?
Are you going to call me to marry you?

339
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:40,799
Look some other girl to show your skills
in flying butterflies and jumping down!

340
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:45,506
First, go and consult a doctor.
Go and consult a psychiatrist.

341
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,828
She scolded me like anything.

342
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,192
- But she scolded while crying.
- Why are you saying that smilingly?

343
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:08,301
There is a meaning behind her scolding.
So I was quiet.

344
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:10,600
You know that little girl Skathi,
don't you?

345
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:11,601
I don't know.

346
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,108
She indeed told that she'll marry me.

347
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:20,011
That minute, I myself
was confused of what to do.

348
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,948
When I myself felt so like that,
how would've the poor Sandhya been?

349
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,081
So did I let her to cry.

350
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:31,419
- Karthik, be careful.
- That's indeed the problem.

351
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,219
I am not able to speak when I see her.

352
00:43:35,396 --> 00:43:36,556
Why did she scold me?

353
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:41,497
She blasted me because she liked me much.

354
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,307
She says, I'm cheating her by
exhibiting magic. Which is magic?

355
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:49,633
I showed her of butterflies are flying.
Is that a magic?

356
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:54,513
I told her that I can cheat death
if I think of her.

357
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,514
But she told a matter.

358
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,116
She told, my mind isn't stable,
and asked me to consult a psychiatrist.

359
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,384
- No!
- Do I need to consult a doctor?

360
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:38,216
You hear Ilayaraja's music inside you,
don't you?

361
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,285
Full of Ilayaraja.

362
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,756
It comes out whenever I see her.

363
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:46,496
What song?

364
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,505
<i>I saw, in your song,</i>

365
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:59,409
<i>Dance, come and dance,</i>

366
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:05,147
Ask him about it.

367
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,216
Did you attempt to commit suicide?

368
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:16,396
You told that you can cheat death,
didn't you?

369
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,426
Did you attempt to jump from a building
saying that you're going to cheat death?

370
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:24,070
You attempted to jump from a building!

371
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:33,175
This is what I keep on saying.
No one listens to it.

372
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:35,143
They're not at all understanding me.
Damn it!

373
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:39,913
I too heard a song same like this
20 years ago during 1980s!

374
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:42,351
What song?

375
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,851
<i>My sweet golden moon,</i>

376
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,786
<i>My dreams in that golden moon,</i>

377
00:45:54,702 --> 00:45:55,726
Actress Shoba too is there in it,
isn't she?

378
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,468
- But no girl loved me.
- Oh my god!

379
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:08,073
- Did it pain so much?
- Leave that.

380
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:11,912
Too much is what you're doing!

381
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,419
Very filmy.

382
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:19,784
Have you ever told her of what that's in
your heart by looking into her eyes?

383
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:24,460
No doctor. She flees if she sees me.
How do I see her eyes in such a state!

384
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:26,197
Give a try, you can definitely do it.

385
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:31,697
I tried it so like this and finally saw
straight into her eyes at Krishnan temple.

386
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,204
- After seeing?
- I fell to her feet at once.

387
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:37,134
That's it, now I've two children.

388
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:45,175
- Who do they resemble like?
- Like her, as intelligent.

389
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,424
Tomorrow itself I'll make it
by seeing her

390
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:02,733
Is it at Krishnan temple?

391
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,335
Each week a guest comes here to share
with us of what that's in their heart.

392
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,010
This week.

393
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:28,960
My name is Karthik.

394
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:33,632
I've come to have a
heart-to-heart talk with you.

395
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:36,602
I'm not used to talk over mike like this.

396
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:42,035
I'm not going to tell a big matter
like father.

397
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:43,506
I don't know that.

398
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,244
I am not a Christian.

399
00:47:51,986 --> 00:47:55,319
So what? Is religion like Hindu, Muslim
or Christian important?

400
00:47:58,926 --> 00:48:00,018
I am right, am I not?

401
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:03,628
Tell me.

402
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:13,105
Now, the basic fact of all religion
is one and the same.

403
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,872
Love.

404
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:26,713
If we like a person,
we show our love for them.

405
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:28,846
Isn't it true? Tell me. Yes.

406
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,090
What would we expect from them in return?
Isn't it love?

407
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,091
Not hatred, isn't it?
Isn't it father?

408
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:44,966
Now what I'm trying to say is that,

409
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,769
... there's a girl in this church
whom I like very much.

410
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:54,277
I won't tell her name.

411
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:03,183
Could you come here for a while?

412
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,788
You all don't mistake me.

413
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:12,122
I came here only to tell, that which is
in my heart in the presence of God,

414
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,863
...like how you give your confessions.
I've given my love.

415
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:22,002
Now if that girl gives her love accepting
this, I'll surely take care of her

416
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:27,079
I'll keep her very happy,
I'll save her...

417
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:33,381
Give me 2 minutes, I'll finish.
I'll keep her very happy.

418
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:50,366
How did you come in?

419
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:53,537
Door was open.
Where is Naushad?

420
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,737
- You?
- I know.

421
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,178
I don't know Naushad.

422
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,981
I went to his office.
I was told that you know.

423
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,524
I know him. That's all.
I'm not much acquainted with him.

424
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:28,607
In office only.
He doesn't keep in touch with me.

425
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:33,005
He doesn't even call me.

426
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:39,345
Could you offer me a glass of water?

427
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:11,742
- Tell me Narayanan.
- A man came in search of you.

428
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:14,886
He told that he knows you.
He enquired about you.

429
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:17,047
I managed to send him by telling that
I don't know anything.

430
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,392
What's happening here?
You're concealing something.

431
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:24,553
You're not even telling anything.
Be careful. Ok, I'll cut the line.

432
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,077
- You go out. - I'll come later.
- Come in.

433
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,540
Why did you disgrace me by
blabbering incessantly at church?

434
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,285
Did I disgrace you?
Didn't I talk from heart?

435
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:49,453
- Didn't all accept it to be right?
- They yelled.

436
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:54,891
You're hitting me with rights.

437
00:51:56,997 --> 00:52:00,899
- I'll tell an important matter and go.
- Tell and go.

438
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:06,234
Now you'll tell me to go. But tomorrow,
you'll marry an unknown fellow...

439
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,443
...beget babies, become old
and toothless...

440
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:14,911
...and walk with a stick howling!

441
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,447
Then you'll think that
you could've married me and

442
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,454
...cry sadly by thinking that you
couldn't tell me your heart's desire.

443
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:33,396
But tell yes now. The church you say,
be it Santhome church or Vatican church

444
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,400
...I'll take you there and marry you.
We'II love without boring

445
00:52:36,637 --> 00:52:40,334
...and run family with joy.
We'll beget babies, but it'll be twins,

446
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,802
...of which one, like you
and the other, like me!

447
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:48,211
Ok leave it, both will be like you!
Then they'll go to school and to college

448
00:52:48,315 --> 00:52:51,614
...then love and marry. Even in such case,
you'll say no to love-marriage

449
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:56,221
...but I'll say yes! After that they'll
beget babies, we'll become grandparents

450
00:52:56,323 --> 00:53:01,488
...unable to walk we'II lean on each other
and love even more happily,

451
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:06,762
...at that time I'll die before you.
You'll cry at that time also.

452
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,370
But you'll cry in a happiness
of having lived a very happy life!

453
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:16,169
Is crying sadly like that is better or
crying happily like this?

454
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:21,776
oh my god, I couldn't further..!

455
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,645
I'm going to cry anyway,
it'll be better if you go.

456
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,856
Now if I go out through that door,
I'll not come back again.

457
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,187
Think well and tell.

458
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,528
I'm telling by thinking well only,
you need not come.

459
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:49,736
Have a last look at me.

460
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,757
I'm going...

461
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:09,890
I'm going, I've gone!

462
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:20,903
I saw my friend at the supermarket.
Her friend has seen you somewhere.

463
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:24,774
Liked you very much, she desired to
get her son married to you.

464
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:27,711
- I too okayed it.
- Have you fixed it?

465
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,450
You only...!

466
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:38,912
Seal these first.

467
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:44,220
- Is Karthik here?
- He isn't here.

468
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,185
I don't know where he is.
Did you phone up and try?

469
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:49,785
I tried, but couldn't get his line.

470
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:53,857
Should I convey anything if I see him?

471
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:15,678
- Are you thinking about me only?
- No.

472
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:18,423
It seems someone came to the site
in search of me!

473
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,223
I've decided to get married.
I came to say that only.

474
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:28,962
This is what I expected.
Then?

475
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,296
I'll marry. I'll beget children.
I'll beget twins.

476
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:37,304
I'll get them married as arranged.
I'll become a granny.

477
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:44,710
Turning grey and toothless,
I'll walk howling by leaning on a stick

478
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,581
...and I'll cuddle well
with grandchildren.

479
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:51,219
I'll die before you.
You sit and cry then.

480
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:55,859
Cry and lament happily by thinking
of the happy life we lived.

481
00:56:56,096 --> 00:56:59,588
Why should you die and I cry?
You sit and cry by thinking about me.

482
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:17,347
My dear darling.

483
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,216
How marriage, babies, twins and
toothless mouth without touching?

484
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:32,621
Ok, you could've said this earlier itself,
isn't it? I struggled a lot.

485
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:36,031
You girls couldn't be understood at all!

486
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:40,106
Girls?
How many?

487
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:42,707
It's you only as of now.

488
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:47,913
Then, it'll be you only forever.

489
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:13,539
<i>You are in me like
the scent in the breeze,</i>

490
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:21,546
<i>I am in you like the rain in the forest!</i>

491
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:29,817
<i>It will never go off with the soil,</i>

492
00:58:31,057 --> 00:58:38,020
<i>The smell of rain is like you in my heart</i>

493
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:45,832
<i>It will never finish with the eyes,</i>

494
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:55,477
<i>The dampness of the soul is
like me always... like me,</i>

495
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:59,311
<i>As solitude creeps
in the middle of a forest</i>

496
00:58:59,486 --> 00:59:03,047
<i>Beautiful desires give way to
feelings of pleasure</i>

497
00:59:03,223 --> 00:59:05,521
<i>World changes</i>

498
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,595
<i>Searching for the life's pleasure,</i>

499
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:15,134
<i>As solitude creeps
in the middle of a forest</i>

500
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:19,068
<i>Beautiful desires give way to
feelings of pleasure</i>

501
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,604
<i>World changes</i>

502
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,543
<i>Searching for the life's pleasure,</i>

503
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:34,745
<i>You're a female forest that longs for
the flower to bud without sunlight,</i>

504
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:42,685
<i>You're a surrounding cloud that
conjoins the roots and greens the water,</i>

505
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:23,124
<i>Sea wind touched your heart
and it utters your name strongly,</i>

506
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:29,807
<i>Lap of waves widens
and it lifts you,</i>

507
01:00:31,778 --> 01:00:42,154
<i>Sea wind touched your heart
and it utters your name strongly,</i>

508
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:45,620
<i>Lap of waves widens
and it lifts you,</i>

509
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:54,166
<i>Thirsts couldn't be
quenched on the ground,</i>

510
01:00:55,335 --> 01:01:02,104
<i>Heat strikes me from your breath,</i>

511
01:01:03,343 --> 01:01:09,976
<i>Tremors never depart from me,</i>

512
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:19,656
<i>Your body shreds clothes</i>

513
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,630
Whom do you want to see?

514
01:02:15,215 --> 01:02:17,183
- Would he be wearing spectacles?
- Yes.

515
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:19,717
He's my student only. Why hasn't he
come for school all these days?

516
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,049
We've intimated,
but no response any.

517
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:24,654
What is your relation to him?

518
01:02:27,227 --> 01:02:28,990
I know him.

519
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:48,803
What Naushad? Is it now
only that you remember us?

520
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:51,076
Not like that.
We have come, haven't we?

521
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:54,682
Iman is alone at home.
He too will get bored, won't he?

522
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:57,420
I too feel worried
seeing him so like that.

523
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,754
So I brought him here for few days.

524
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,020
Oh god! I didn't tell in that sense.

525
01:03:02,128 --> 01:03:04,961
Why few days? You may
stay here as long you wish.

526
01:03:05,064 --> 01:03:06,088
Consider its like your home.

527
01:03:08,601 --> 01:03:09,625
Give it to me once.

528
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,097
- Look uncle, he's asking.
- No Iman.

529
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,436
- That is a glazed one. You'll get
your hands cut. -  His kite has got off.

530
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,906
Haven't we kited a lot during our
childhood? Aren't they kids? Allow them.

531
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:22,573
- Look here.
- Hey, it looks superb!

532
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,648
- Isn't it flying wonderfully?
- Don't grip it.

533
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:31,121
- Let it loose.
- It's looks superb, isn't it?

534
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:03,081
This is the entrance.

535
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:09,219
Come.

536
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:11,361
Come!

537
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:17,025
Here will be our hall.

538
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:21,629
This side and that side
have nothing!

539
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,038
You may have it as you wish.

540
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:28,110
Look there.
A big guest room will be over there.

541
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,515
That'll be the place of limit both
for your friends and my friends.

542
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,107
They shouldn't come beyond that. Ok?

543
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,783
A beautiful kitchen will be over there.

544
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,723
Your department.

545
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:42,655
- I will not cook.
- It's ok we'll order it.

546
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:48,660
A big bedroom will be at the back,
for our children.

547
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:53,266
We should be alone, shouldn't we?
So would they be at some distance away!

548
01:04:53,373 --> 01:04:55,807
It'll not be audible of
however one shouts. Children!

549
01:04:56,843 --> 01:05:00,006
We can keep building rooms
as we keep begetting children!

550
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:03,742
Either this side or that side
will be a beautiful clinic for you.

551
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,077
How is it?

552
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,352
Did I tell anything sad?

553
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:17,086
I feel very happy.

554
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:21,633
I'll not be worried even if I lose
my life now in this minute.

555
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:23,167
Oh god!

556
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:25,703
It looks, this plan have to be changed!

557
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:31,969
How would it be to conclude
when we've started it just now?

558
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:34,376
Ok, leave that.

559
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:38,706
Ask your dad to postpone
our marriage for a year.

560
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,721
I'll finish my projects and
you'll finish your course by then.

561
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,191
One year?
No way at all.

562
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:51,795
You'll chase to love me.

563
01:05:51,898 --> 01:05:54,332
Once I agree,
will you postpone the marriage?

564
01:05:54,967 --> 01:05:59,734
- I'll handle you after marriage.
- So I am asking you to postpone a year!

565
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:03,405
Wait.

566
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:08,538
- Ok, not for you, not for me.
- You only don't want, but I do want!

567
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:13,941
But a bet. If I win in it,
you've to obey to what I say.

568
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,886
If you win, I'll obey
to what you say. Ok?

569
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:22,290
I'll only win for sure.

570
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,428
What is the bet?
Tell me.

571
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:46,571
Nothing serious, isn't it?

572
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,248
Nothing will happen to you. Ok?

573
01:07:51,284 --> 01:07:53,377
Nothing has happened to you.
Nothing will happen.

574
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:31,684
You brought her here with struggle.

575
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:35,420
More blood got lost since her
carotid artery and jugular vein got cut.

576
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,490
We tried our best but couldn't save her.

577
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:43,031
What are you saying doctor?

578
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,094
That you couldn't save Sandhya.

579
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,102
It couldn't be so.
She will be alive for sure.

580
01:08:48,808 --> 01:08:51,242
Something could've happened by mistake.

581
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:53,369
I don't say that you've done a mistake.

582
01:08:53,613 --> 01:08:55,774
But some small mistake
could've happened, isn't it?

583
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:57,916
Go and see her once. Please!

584
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:00,911
Ask him to go and see.

585
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,533
Just now a few minutes ago..

586
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,200
...that she was happily
riding a cycle with smile.

587
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:27,479
Her smiling face still remains
before my eyes.

588
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:42,084
It was a small thread, buddy. How'll that
take a life by slitting the throat?

589
01:09:42,194 --> 01:09:45,561
Mom! That is a thin kite thread.

590
01:09:45,665 --> 01:09:48,156
It got entangled in her throat and
I took it out then itself.

591
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:52,096
It is a glazed thread, isn't it?
Hence it cut her.

592
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,440
Look at mom.

593
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:59,773
Why are you crying simply and
making others cry as well?

594
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:01,574
You're allergic to hospital, aren't you?

595
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:17,521
She gave me the small cycle
and she took the big one.

596
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,996
Hence she overtook me.
I too tried.

597
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,194
I should've gone before.

598
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:30,541
Had I gone before, she would've now
suffered this pain, wouldn't she?

599
01:10:32,244 --> 01:10:35,145
No buddy,
she couldn't have endured it.

600
01:10:47,193 --> 01:10:49,161
Look how they are crying.

601
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:52,086
Aren't they her parents?

602
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:08,642
That's it, isn't it?
It's over.

603
01:11:12,284 --> 01:11:14,775
Somebody has to sign
to take her, isn't it?

604
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:16,588
Come man.

605
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:21,120
Her parents are there for it.

606
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,859
We didn't get married.
So I can't sign.

607
01:11:24,964 --> 01:11:27,125
- Come.
- It's ok.

608
01:12:46,846 --> 01:12:49,280
Why have you come here uncle?
Had you called me I would've come.

609
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:51,815
- It's ok.
- Take your seat.

610
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:55,210
- How are you?
- Fine.

611
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:57,881
I can clearly see it at your face.

612
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,550
How long are you going to be like this?

613
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,424
I feel proud of Sandhya!
I am very happy.

614
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:11,225
She kept on helping others
when she was alive.

615
01:13:11,337 --> 01:13:14,306
She has helped even after her death.

616
01:13:15,074 --> 01:13:17,838
She has saved a life even
during her death.

617
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,175
She has saved a life by giving her heart
as a replacement for a dying heart.

618
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,320
Sandhya hasn't left me.

619
01:13:51,377 --> 01:13:53,208
- I need a patient's address.
- Name?

620
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:10,024
Where is Naushad's house?

621
01:14:31,817 --> 01:14:33,250
No one is there.
Come.

622
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:36,446
- Isn't this Naushad's house?
- They've vacated the house.

623
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,852
They're frequently changing their house.

624
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:39,322
Did you check in their previous house?

625
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:41,859
Do someone else know about
where they've gone?

626
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:44,655
I only know all,
but I don't know this alone!

627
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:09,217
April 25th is my wedding day..

628
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,755
...hence I do remember well
about that boy's surgery.

629
01:15:11,857 --> 01:15:14,291
That boy sent me some greeting card.

630
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:18,289
See if this could help you.

631
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,579
What are you doing?

632
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,319
Didn't you say that you wouldn't marry?

633
01:15:46,425 --> 01:15:48,916
But they're talking about our marriage.

634
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:54,523
Didn't you threaten to jump
from upstairs? Hence all this.

635
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:57,127
I didn't want a life
to die because of me.

636
01:16:06,912 --> 01:16:08,072
How if it goes?

637
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:13,010
Now you express your love for me.

638
01:16:16,055 --> 01:16:21,755
<i>Wings grew for me to go somewhere
Night depleted slowly from my eyes</i>

639
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,695
<i>Memories long to see you</i>

640
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:32,962
<i>By what to I lift as my dreams boils
Pain reaches to pinch you inside</i>

641
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:38,098
<i>Pleasure gathers by searching you,</i>

642
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:48,549
<i>It'll take some period, some distance
and some time to over take you!</i>

643
01:16:49,588 --> 01:16:59,657
<i>This longing, this path, this journey
has become my life by searching you</i>

644
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:06,930
<i>With what to lift my boiling dreams
Pain reaches to pinch you inside</i>

645
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:12,067
<i>Pleasure gathers by searching you,</i>

646
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:52,110
<i>Shouldn't the shore search
for you, my river?,</i>

647
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:57,646
<i>Shouldn't the clouds search
for you, my moon?</i>

648
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:03,193
<i>Who'll know the Cuckoo's song
struggling on a rainy night?</i>

649
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:08,926
<i>Who'll know the dreams of
shrubs that is on the lap of sea?</i>

650
01:18:09,168 --> 01:18:11,932
<i>Where are you my beauty?</i>

651
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:14,732
<i>My dear! You are there where it pains,</i>

652
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,508
<i>What are you doing, my life?</i>

653
01:18:17,743 --> 01:18:19,973
<i>You are getting inside my life and going,</i>

654
01:18:20,078 --> 01:18:22,603
<i>Where is my heart?</i>

655
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:29,947
<i>It's not inside the flower or above the
moon or under the fire or outside the wind</i>

656
01:18:31,323 --> 01:18:36,886
<i>It is there in your eyes, in your breath,
in your night, in your heart,</i>

657
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:41,830
<i>...in your hand, and in your life,</i>

658
01:18:43,035 --> 01:18:48,769
<i>Wings grew for me to go somewhere
Night depleted slowly from my eyes</i>

659
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:53,436
<i>Memories long to see you</i>

660
01:18:54,413 --> 01:19:00,045
<i>As one eye sink in honey
and the other suffer in pain</i>

661
01:19:00,219 --> 01:19:04,349
<i>How'll I dream in middle?</i>

662
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:15,097
<i>It'll take some period, some distance
and some time to over take you!</i>

663
01:19:16,568 --> 01:19:26,102
<i>This longing, this path, this journey
has become my life by searching you</i>

664
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:40,611
Sayeed! See! The car has come.

665
01:20:43,188 --> 01:20:45,816
- The car has stopped.
- Ask in.

666
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:50,426
- The car has stopped.
- Where from? - Chennai!

667
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,824
You go and see.

668
01:20:52,731 --> 01:20:55,165
It will take 2 or 3 days to repair it.
I want it immediately.

669
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:58,231
See how many are there!

670
01:21:01,473 --> 01:21:04,374
Eswar! Look! Why do you stare like that?

671
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,178
Don't you know me?
I'm Sayeed.

672
01:21:09,147 --> 01:21:11,308
We played together
in the district foot ball match.

673
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:15,515
Why do you look like that?
Aren't you Eswar?

674
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,849
I'm Sayeed then!

675
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,985
You've forgotten the past.
When did you come to Munnar?

676
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:21,582
- Only now.
- What happened?

677
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:23,388
The valve connecting
the engine has cut off.

678
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,121
You will get the car in a day.
Let's go.

679
01:21:30,502 --> 01:21:31,867
You are staying with me. Ok?

680
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,335
I have not seen you for many years.

681
01:21:33,505 --> 01:21:34,597
I feel very happy now.

682
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:37,607
Do you remember?
If you had not fought in the committee...

683
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:38,937
...they wouldn't have
included in the team...

684
01:21:39,044 --> 01:21:40,671
...and I wouldn't have played
in the district match.

685
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:42,870
What are you doing now?

686
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:44,941
Easwar! I'm asking you!

687
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:54,020
Aren't you married
and have a child?

688
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,155
Instead of bringing them,
you have brought the dog!

689
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,827
Where are they?

690
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:10,702
- They are dead.
- Sorry buddy.

691
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:22,782
This is my house! This not my own.
It's my boss's!

692
01:22:22,888 --> 01:22:24,856
He is in Cochin!
We are the care takers.

693
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:30,323
She is my wife Reshmu.
You come here.

694
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:32,194
He is my son Raja.

695
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,331
Say hello to uncle.

696
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:37,926
He is my friend.
He has come from his native.

697
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:40,266
He is going to stay with us.
Make his room ready.

698
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:41,669
- Dear...
- Come.

699
01:22:41,773 --> 01:22:43,536
Come dear!

700
01:22:43,642 --> 01:22:45,803
What were doing my dear without me?

701
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:32,388
- Mr. Naushad!
- You?

702
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:39,920
I understand your pain.

703
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,999
I felt the pain in me when I knew that...

704
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,798
...my son is going away from me.

705
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,606
I thought that my son's life
has come to an end!

706
01:23:51,376 --> 01:23:53,810
I got him back only
because of Sandhya.

707
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:06,821
He was playing with
his friends, flying kites!

708
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:08,950
All of a sudden he fell unconscious.

709
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,426
Doctor! You've to save his life somehow.

710
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:13,823
You know that well.

711
01:24:13,932 --> 01:24:16,696
What he has is Cardiomyopathy!

712
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:20,636
Any moment,
his heart beats could stop.

713
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,508
We have to take his heart
away and fit another one!

714
01:24:27,345 --> 01:24:28,972
I want my son.

715
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,174
I have informed all hospital.
Don't worry Naushad!

716
01:24:32,284 --> 01:24:34,445
You can be happy about something!

717
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:37,383
There is a heart enlargement
for your son.

718
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:41,585
So, it is not necessary that
it need not be a boy's heart.

719
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:42,990
<i>Anyone dead not before 4 hours...</i>

720
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:46,530
<i>...with a healthy heart and
B positive blood is enough</i>

721
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:48,462
That will be suitable for him.

722
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,664
She is the donor.

723
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:31,037
If that incident didn't happen at all...

724
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:35,168
...his birthday will be on the
same day on the day he died.

725
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:41,783
My son has been
born again for me.

726
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:43,920
At this juncture

727
01:25:44,623 --> 01:25:47,456
I wonder if I should be
happy that I got my son back...

728
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:50,393
...or solace for your loss!

729
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,926
We live in your girl's loss!

730
01:25:54,366 --> 01:25:58,860
There are no words
to tell my thanks to you!

731
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:03,934
I want to see Iman.

732
01:26:17,656 --> 01:26:19,556
With purple T-shirt!
Look there!

733
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:44,006
<i>We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats</i>

734
01:27:44,175 --> 01:27:51,274
<i>We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it</i>

735
01:27:51,983 --> 01:27:55,612
<i>It should hit the target if hits,</i>

736
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:59,347
<i>The sea should change if caught,</i>

737
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:03,018
<i>What we think will happen!</i>

738
01:28:03,228 --> 01:28:07,631
<i>If pulled, the earth is in our hands</i>

739
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:10,968
<i>Blow the stick like the wind</i>

740
01:28:11,603 --> 01:28:14,629
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

741
01:28:15,273 --> 01:28:18,367
<i>Blow the stick like the wind!</i>

742
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:21,911
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

743
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:28,212
<i>We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats</i>

744
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:35,483
<i>We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it</i>

745
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:02,008
<i>Placing the enemy in a straight line</i>

746
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,847
<i>We've to stand firm by holding the armour</i>

747
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:09,515
<i>Should make wave with a song,</i>

748
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:13,358
<i>We're the print of the earth,</i>

749
01:29:13,798 --> 01:29:17,359
<i>Lightening tree has grown up,</i>

750
01:29:17,535 --> 01:29:20,993
<i>Seed of fire in our hands,</i>

751
01:29:21,172 --> 01:29:24,801
<i>We've got the desired boon...</i>

752
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:28,604
<i>...like a sweet rain in our heart,</i>

753
01:29:29,347 --> 01:29:32,373
<i>Blow the stick like the wind</i>

754
01:29:33,017 --> 01:29:36,077
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

755
01:29:36,688 --> 01:29:39,816
<i>Blow the stick like the wind!</i>

756
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:43,225
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

757
01:29:43,361 --> 01:29:46,888
<i>Clouds are darkening, it seems to rain</i>

758
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:50,432
<i>...and the wind is blowing,</i>

759
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,397
<i>Wind!
Mild mind!</i>

760
01:30:20,031 --> 01:30:23,432
<i>Heart is jumping in longing</i>

761
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:27,196
<i>A net is weaved with nerves</i>

762
01:30:27,305 --> 01:30:30,797
<i>Creating volcano out of mind's rage</i>

763
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:34,604
<i>You're the excess in every share,</i>

764
01:30:35,246 --> 01:30:38,682
<i>Like a light flying saucer</i>

765
01:30:38,917 --> 01:30:42,216
<i>Heavy heart is flying</i>

766
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:46,079
<i>I was like a cracked wall,</i>

767
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,960
<i>Now the crack have become flowers</i>

768
01:30:50,495 --> 01:30:53,692
<i>Blow the stick like the wind</i>

769
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:57,426
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

770
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:01,038
<i>Blow the stick like the wind!</i>

771
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:04,640
<i>Our signature became
as a lightning in sky</i>

772
01:31:04,742 --> 01:31:08,906
<i>We can go by piercing
into the sun if it heats</i>

773
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:16,449
<i>We can control all the directions
if we jump high and touch it</i>

774
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:56,887
Iman come!

775
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:04,235
I went to see you in your house.
And you seem to enjoy the elephant ride.

776
01:32:04,335 --> 01:32:06,963
As Iman got bored
I thought we could go on a ride.

777
01:32:10,475 --> 01:32:11,908
Tell him hai!

778
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:25,320
Which class you are in?

779
01:32:30,228 --> 01:32:31,252
Tell him.

780
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:36,325
Look at me.

781
01:32:37,835 --> 01:32:42,067
This is Doctor... MBBS, it's mine.

782
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,335
Take good care of it.

783
01:32:50,448 --> 01:32:52,211
What Iman?

784
01:32:53,785 --> 01:32:56,345
Ok. Sandhya too was like this.
I got used to it.

785
01:32:58,389 --> 01:33:01,358
I'll call you definitely.
Ask him to talk when I call up.

786
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,425
Naushad!
What is going on here?

787
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:17,091
I thought you have
told me everything.

788
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:18,691
But you have hidden
something from me.

789
01:34:18,803 --> 01:34:21,363
I don't who it was,
in the black Scorpio!

790
01:34:21,472 --> 01:34:23,372
Why did the car try to hit you?

791
01:34:23,474 --> 01:34:25,499
Don't tell me it was an accident.

792
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,976
If it was an accident,
why did it come again to hit Iman?

793
01:34:28,279 --> 01:34:30,577
Naushad! Tell me what happened?

794
01:34:34,018 --> 01:34:37,112
Iman, go and sit outside for a while.

795
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:47,457
That is my car!

796
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:50,660
A horrible accident has
happened in my life.

797
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,998
See in that drawer...
The memories are chasing me.

798
01:34:53,237 --> 01:34:54,067
That second one...

799
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,553
I have lost my son!

800
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:14,349
He thought it was me who killed his son.

801
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,484
You should go through the pain I suffer!

802
01:35:16,727 --> 01:35:19,025
He bought the same car
and is trying to kill me.

803
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:23,294
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll separate your son from you.

804
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:31,975
As I couldn't stand his torture, and told
the police. He was put in the lockup.

805
01:35:32,343 --> 01:35:34,174
But his urge to kill didn't subdue.

806
01:35:48,359 --> 01:35:49,724
I'll take Iman with me.

807
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:52,523
Don't think!

808
01:35:53,764 --> 01:35:57,063
Iman is important
for me as he is to you.

809
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,995
Because my life depends on him.

810
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:03,005
I have lost Sandhya once.

811
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:05,942
I got her back because of him.

812
01:36:06,777 --> 01:36:08,608
I won't lose her once again.

813
01:36:09,647 --> 01:36:11,547
I will take good care of Iman!

814
01:36:22,126 --> 01:36:24,094
- Won't you talk?
- I won't.

815
01:36:28,799 --> 01:36:31,097
- What is in the bag?
- Nothing.

816
01:36:31,736 --> 01:36:33,169
Then keep it away and feel free.

817
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:43,571
Look there.
There is an elephant.

818
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:55,515
What problem do you have at this age?
I was joyful at your stage.

819
01:37:40,137 --> 01:37:43,163
Sorry! I didn't expect you in this state.
Forgive me.

820
01:37:44,809 --> 01:37:46,299
Where is your son?

821
01:37:47,678 --> 01:37:50,841
I won't keep idle,
if anything happens to my son.

822
01:37:51,415 --> 01:37:55,249
- That's what I'm going to do!
- Fool! That was an accident.

823
01:37:55,353 --> 01:37:57,048
Your son has died in that accident.

824
01:37:57,154 --> 01:38:00,851
My son has died.
It's you who tell that it is an accident.

825
01:38:06,831 --> 01:38:07,729
Dad!

826
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:10,659
I was a very happy man!

827
01:38:13,371 --> 01:38:15,271
You have snatched away my happiness.

828
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:18,875
You've injected pain in
my heart. Look at me.

829
01:38:20,111 --> 01:38:21,669
Can you see the pain?

830
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:26,411
It won't be visible.
You can't see the pain.

831
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:28,679
You can only feel it.

832
01:38:29,186 --> 01:38:31,416
I'm going to give you my pain!

833
01:38:32,189 --> 01:38:33,486
You will come to know then.

834
01:38:35,593 --> 01:38:38,687
He is a small boy.

835
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:40,691
My son?

836
01:38:41,465 --> 01:38:43,365
Why are you keen to avenge?

837
01:38:44,602 --> 01:38:45,694
I am not avenging.

838
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:49,431
I'll see if it is right...!

839
01:38:50,408 --> 01:38:51,306
I'll make it equal!

840
01:38:53,744 --> 01:38:54,711
I'll make it equal!

841
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,716
Do you think that I've killed your son?

842
01:39:02,286 --> 01:39:03,913
Harm me in whatever way.

843
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,982
Leave my boy alone.

844
01:39:09,493 --> 01:39:11,723
If I harm you...

845
01:39:11,896 --> 01:39:13,796
...you wouldn't know the pain I suffer.

846
01:39:17,234 --> 01:39:19,464
You have to undergo my pain.

847
01:39:25,443 --> 01:39:27,741
I know well where your son is!

848
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,301
Come let's go inside.

849
01:39:57,675 --> 01:39:59,108
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

850
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,837
I don't like this place.

851
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:03,638
Don't you like this place?
Ok, come with me.

852
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:06,849
I won't come in.

853
01:40:07,818 --> 01:40:09,786
My name is Karthik. Come in!

854
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:11,787
I wouldn't come.

855
01:40:11,956 --> 01:40:13,856
Ok. You be here.

856
01:40:30,107 --> 01:40:31,802
Are you going to be here?

857
01:40:32,176 --> 01:40:33,939
- Yes.
- Ok.

858
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:35,875
Come in if the wild elephant comes.

859
01:40:37,314 --> 01:40:38,804
Wild elephant?

860
01:40:57,735 --> 01:40:58,827
This is your room.

861
01:41:05,342 --> 01:41:06,832
Bathroom is there.

862
01:41:11,615 --> 01:41:13,310
There is a swing behind you.

863
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:15,044
Not there. This side!

864
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:25,522
- Are you feeling hungry?
- I am not hungry.

865
01:41:27,298 --> 01:41:30,597
I feel hungry and I'm going to eat.

866
01:41:30,768 --> 01:41:32,793
If you feel hungry,
You can come and have food.

867
01:42:01,599 --> 01:42:03,567
Don't you feel hungry?
Come and sit here.

868
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:04,565
No.

869
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:44,405
Dear! What were you doing here?

870
01:42:44,508 --> 01:42:46,942
You always play with sand.
Your hand is full of dirt.

871
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,147
What happened to the car?
It has hit on something!

872
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:00,281
It was a small accident.

873
01:43:00,391 --> 01:43:02,689
Accident? How?

874
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:05,887
Was it a jeep?

875
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:10,962
Be careful! It is the hill station!

876
01:43:11,468 --> 01:43:13,959
- Shall I get repaired your car?
- No.

877
01:43:14,338 --> 01:43:16,772
- I'll make it ready in a day.
- No.

878
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,993
<i>Pleasant air is blowing...
It's like music...</i>

879
01:43:50,174 --> 01:43:52,005
It is Ilayaraja's music!
Listen!

880
01:43:54,511 --> 01:43:57,480
Dude! A.R. Rahman! Listen!

881
01:43:59,249 --> 01:44:03,015
Dude! It is Ilayaraja's music! Listen!

882
01:44:04,855 --> 01:44:07,949
A.R. Rahman's music! Listen!

883
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,688
I don't say that
A.R. Rahman's music is bad.

884
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:17,028
...but Ilayaraja's music is superb!

885
01:44:18,268 --> 01:44:19,098
Listen!

886
01:44:20,471 --> 01:44:23,565
I didn't say Ilayaraja's music is bad.

887
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:28,441
Listen!

888
01:44:31,148 --> 01:44:36,051
Ilayaraja is a super star!
Listen to Ilayaraja first.

889
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:42,918
Don't touch!
You are quarrelling like a small boy.

890
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,654
Both of them are superb! Ok?

891
01:44:44,762 --> 01:44:47,253
Listen to Ilayaraja first.
You can listen to A.R. Rahman next.

892
01:44:48,632 --> 01:44:51,863
- If you don't change it, I'll get down
from the car. - Keep quiet!

893
01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:53,197
I'll get down.

894
01:44:54,638 --> 01:44:56,196
Wait.

895
01:44:56,974 --> 01:44:58,339
What's your problem?

896
01:44:58,442 --> 01:45:00,137
Do you want
to get down and walk?

897
01:45:00,244 --> 01:45:02,610
Let me see how long
you can walk. Go!

898
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,738
The bag is in the back.
Take that too.

899
01:45:11,655 --> 01:45:13,088
Close the door.

900
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:01,204
If you were not there,
I wouldn't have found him out so fast.

901
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:04,741
Who are you and what connection
you have with him?

902
01:46:05,175 --> 01:46:07,143
I don't want to know that.

903
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:09,871
- Send him to me.
- No.

904
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,346
You have no connection with him!
You can go.

905
01:46:14,051 --> 01:46:18,283
Go man.
Send him first to me.

906
01:46:18,722 --> 01:46:23,159
I am in agony!
You don't know what is inside me.

907
01:46:23,327 --> 01:46:27,696
I know. It is the vengeance
and foolishness, right?

908
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:31,700
It is not foolishness!
It is the pain!

909
01:46:32,002 --> 01:46:33,560
The pain of a loss!

910
01:46:34,605 --> 01:46:35,970
You wouldn't know that.

911
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,703
You would come to know it
if you were a loser like me.

912
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,834
I know well what is the pain of a loss.

913
01:46:40,944 --> 01:46:42,241
It should not happen to anybody.

914
01:46:42,346 --> 01:46:44,371
- Get away.
- He should have thought it over.

915
01:46:44,882 --> 01:46:48,318
- He didn't do that.
- Don't talk like a fool.

916
01:46:48,619 --> 01:46:50,644
The thought of vengeance will kill you!

917
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:52,654
Don't look for your own death. Go

918
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:55,850
- I've died long before.
- Do you know what you are talking about?

919
01:46:55,959 --> 01:46:57,790
You are talking about
snatching away a soul.

920
01:46:57,895 --> 01:46:59,385
Don't do that.
Forget it.

921
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:02,724
I have lost my son.

922
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,328
No. I'm talking about you,
snatching a life.

923
01:47:06,436 --> 01:47:09,337
It is easy to take a life away.

924
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:11,202
In reality, it is different.

925
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:13,806
Imagination and reality
are different. Understand it.

926
01:47:13,911 --> 01:47:16,209
I am living in the pain of reality.

927
01:47:18,782 --> 01:47:20,875
You haven't understood
my pain so far.

928
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:27,085
When I see him, I could see joy
and smile on his dad's face.

929
01:47:27,324 --> 01:47:29,224
I am not able to stand that.

930
01:47:30,127 --> 01:47:32,288
- Leave him to me.
- No Easwar.

931
01:47:34,464 --> 01:47:37,228
- Leave him.
- No.

932
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,243
Iman! Get into the car.

933
01:49:37,187 --> 01:49:38,745
Fasten the seat belt.

934
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:49,423
What's going on here?
Who was in the black car?

935
01:50:50,127 --> 01:50:51,492
Who was that hitting you?

936
01:50:51,595 --> 01:50:53,426
Don't tell me it is an accident again.

937
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:55,020
Why did you come to Munnar?

938
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:56,898
Don't try to hide away things from me.

939
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,433
I will help you if you need any.

940
01:50:59,536 --> 01:51:01,163
You have done many things for me.

941
01:51:01,538 --> 01:51:03,028
Tell me what happened!

942
01:51:04,941 --> 01:51:08,968
My son has died.
He was killed.

943
01:51:14,885 --> 01:51:16,443
Do you know what have you done?

944
01:51:16,553 --> 01:51:18,043
You will feel bad in your mind.

945
01:51:18,555 --> 01:51:19,988
Why are you doing it?

946
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:21,855
You will get into problems!

947
01:51:22,559 --> 01:51:24,117
If anything happens to you
who is there to take care of you?

948
01:51:28,832 --> 01:51:30,129
We can do one thing.

949
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,933
I don't know how to tell it.

950
01:51:35,038 --> 01:51:36,665
I know some people in this place.

951
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,540
We can finish our work through them.

952
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:40,669
Our names will not come out.

953
01:51:41,445 --> 01:51:45,108
What? Leave it to me.
I'll take care.

954
01:52:53,316 --> 01:52:54,806
I'll get sleep only when the light is on.

955
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:58,815
I am telling it on your safety!

956
01:52:58,989 --> 01:53:01,014
You know what happened in
the morning. Go and sleep well.

957
01:53:02,726 --> 01:53:05,559
When I was with my dad
there were no problems!

958
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:08,422
After I came with you
there were lots of problems!

959
01:53:08,732 --> 01:53:12,429
- I want to go to my dad.
- I'll take you. Go to sleep.

960
01:53:15,805 --> 01:53:17,170
You...

961
01:53:20,577 --> 01:53:21,874
My bag.

962
01:53:24,414 --> 01:53:26,041
You are keeping an eye on your bag.

963
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,083
I switched the light off to avoid
anyone taking it away. Lie down.

964
01:53:32,155 --> 01:53:32,951
Ok!

965
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:54,583
Our boys did their work neatly.

966
01:56:55,024 --> 01:56:57,322
They have dabbed poison on him.
He will definitely die.

967
01:56:57,694 --> 01:57:01,323
There is a boy right?
You didn't tell me that.

968
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:04,195
I have not asked you
any help for me!

969
01:57:04,834 --> 01:57:07,064
Not that. I wanted to help you
when you are in agony.

970
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:10,061
But after hearing that I felt that
if I have done some thing wrong.

971
01:57:13,309 --> 01:57:14,742
Because we have a boy in this house.

972
01:57:15,311 --> 01:57:18,747
Whatever it is I feel as if he
has been separated from his dad.

973
01:57:22,652 --> 01:57:25,246
- You too don't know about my pain.
- I didn't mean it.

974
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,084
How will you feel if your son
is separated from you?

975
01:58:04,427 --> 01:58:05,223
My bag!

976
01:58:16,873 --> 01:58:21,367
- Karthik! -What?
- Where is my bag?

977
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:23,376
- It is in the car.
- Why?

978
01:58:23,746 --> 01:58:25,509
We've to get away from here soon.
Get ready.

979
01:58:26,549 --> 01:58:28,779
What happened?
Have you fallen down?

980
01:58:29,953 --> 01:58:32,581
That's why I told you not
to switch off the light.

981
01:58:35,959 --> 01:58:37,586
I should have handed you over to them.

982
01:58:38,828 --> 01:58:40,193
It's nothing. Come fast.

983
01:58:41,965 --> 01:58:43,523
How did you come so fast?
Didn't you take your bath?

984
01:58:43,766 --> 01:58:45,199
You asked me to come fast.

985
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,600
You...! I pity on your dad

986
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:54,940
Raja! Look for him!

987
01:59:17,934 --> 01:59:20,027
- Raja!
- Dad!

988
01:59:26,142 --> 01:59:26,972
Dad!

989
01:59:27,343 --> 01:59:29,436
Raja come here!
Where have you gone?

990
01:59:32,348 --> 01:59:33,576
- I've to go.
- Where to?

991
02:00:29,272 --> 02:00:30,102
Iman! Hold it.

992
02:00:47,423 --> 02:00:48,219
Come.

993
02:02:42,605 --> 02:02:43,401
Come.

994
02:02:53,683 --> 02:02:54,650
Come Iman.

995
02:03:46,202 --> 02:03:50,832
Here it is. Keep it.

996
02:03:55,478 --> 02:03:56,467
Keep it.

997
02:03:58,014 --> 02:04:00,574
- What is this?
- Have you seen Rambo?

998
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:03,849
Won't you see any action films?

999
02:04:09,825 --> 02:04:11,383
You have many problems!

1000
02:04:12,562 --> 02:04:17,590
Isn't someone trailing you?
Fight them! Don't run away!

1001
02:04:19,101 --> 02:04:20,398
You have a strong body, right?

1002
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:38,009
Look! Don't go anywhere
leaving me! Understand!

1003
02:04:38,654 --> 02:04:42,021
- Go and bring your bag!
- You too don't sleep like this.

1004
02:04:43,192 --> 02:04:44,819
Don't think that
I am doing everything for you!

1005
02:04:45,194 --> 02:04:47,025
I'm being patient only
because of her. Come.

1006
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:59,769
Iman! Look here.

1007
02:06:00,269 --> 02:06:01,759
- Are you the one who has brought the boy?
- Yes doctor!

1008
02:06:02,538 --> 02:06:04,699
- Are you his dad?
- No, his guardian!

1009
02:06:05,675 --> 02:06:07,302
Have you done any by pass
surgery for the boy?

1010
02:06:07,943 --> 02:06:10,241
No! We have done heart
transplantation for him.

1011
02:06:11,814 --> 02:06:14,339
- How can you take him out like this?
- Doctor! Is there any problem in it?

1012
02:06:14,517 --> 02:06:18,578
There is no problem in that. As the boy
is little weak, he fell unconscious!

1013
02:06:19,355 --> 02:06:21,585
We have put him on drips!
He will be okay soon. Take care.

1014
02:06:49,719 --> 02:06:55,487
- What Rambo? How are you?
- See this.

1015
02:06:58,928 --> 02:07:00,691
Karthik! Where is my bag?

1016
02:07:10,406 --> 02:07:12,704
- Do you know what
the doctor has said? - What?

1017
02:07:12,808 --> 02:07:16,073
...that you are a weakling,
and that you have no strength!

1018
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:18,174
...and that's why you fell down suddenly.

1019
02:07:19,081 --> 02:07:22,482
So, from tomorrow on,
you have to eat well.

1020
02:07:23,018 --> 02:07:24,315
...and take care of your health well.

1021
02:07:24,954 --> 02:07:28,651
Especially this has to be
taken good care.

1022
02:07:38,234 --> 02:07:40,862
- I want to go to my dad.
- I'll take you.

1023
02:07:41,303 --> 02:07:43,567
- When?
- Tomorrow!

1024
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:46,807
- Definitely?
- I'll take you!

1025
02:07:54,984 --> 02:07:57,418
- Write it and sign it then.
- What?

1026
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:01,486
Write that you will take me
to my dad and sign it.

1027
02:08:06,996 --> 02:08:12,366
Nothing will happen to you!
I'll take you to your dad tomorrow.

1028
02:08:12,835 --> 02:08:14,302
Then write it & sign it.

1029
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:16,399
- Where?
- Here.

1030
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:30,851
My dad never keeps his promises.

1031
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:35,452
Now, you have given me
a promise. Let's see.

1032
02:10:39,748 --> 02:10:42,717
- I can't walk.
- It's only little more far. Come!

1033
02:11:52,621 --> 02:11:53,679
Go, Iman.

1034
02:12:53,716 --> 02:12:54,876
Iman, go!

1035
02:12:56,685 --> 02:12:57,777
Iman! Go away from here.

1036
02:12:59,154 --> 02:13:00,849
Go! See You Again!!!
