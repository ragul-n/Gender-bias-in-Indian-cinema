1
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:06,279
32... 33...
34, 35...

2
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,947
36, 31. 38, 39,40...

3
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,744
42... 4l

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,613
No, sir! They're our Muslim brothers!
Women and children... no!

5
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,608
Shoot!

6
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,609
A Mussalman who takes up
for the infidels...

7
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,942
can no longer belong to us

8
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:46,110
And thus, because of
a handful selfish human beings...

9
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,943
several innocents were slain

10
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:53,277
Notjust human beings, humanity itself
was sacrificed at the altar

11
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:58,278
At the appeal of Sheikh Mujibir Rehman
and the masses in East Pakistan...

12
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:04,613
lndia had to respond to them
in their time of crisis

13
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:25,113
The 10 Para Battalion is landing in the
Indian zone at 0600 hours. Remember...

14
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:28,942
it's our nation that has
given us evemhing

15
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,943
Fame, pride and an identity

16
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:39,611
Fortunate are those who get an
opportunity to repay their nation

17
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,809
Destiny has provided us
with this opportunity today

18
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,775
We must respond to
the enemy's challenge

19
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:54,112
''Grant unto me the boon, Lord, that
l never shy away from noble deeds''

20
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,275
''May l know not fear
on the battlefield...''

21
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,942
''may l be determined
to triumph''

22
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,142
Captain, Indian ship sighted sir!

23
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,275
There's an unidentified contact
on the radar

24
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:27,608
Confirmed Indian warship, sir!

25
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,942
Damn it! It's a submarine!

26
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:32,110
lt means the enemy already
knew of our sea route!

27
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,608
Turn the ship around. Quick!

28
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:07,742
Tube's ready to fire, sir.
- Fire!

29
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,608
The torpedoes' headed in the
ship's range, sir!

30
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,610
The torpedoes' hit the vessel, sir!
Great!

31
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,242
lnform the ship that we're hit!
- Aye, sir!

32
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,111
But we have a mission, sir!
To take the soldiers to Cox Bazar

33
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:57,944
Another ship can handle the submarine.
- We're in contact with eveyone

34
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,275
lf we don't destroy them, they could
be a danger to the other ships

35
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,744
And the Indian navy has never retreated!
- But the soldiers on board...?

36
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,609
Don't wory about us, Captain. The
Indian army knows what it has to do

37
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,942
You go ahead with your own thing.
Good luck!

38
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,943
The ship is headed toward us, sir!
Permission to lower mast, sir?

39
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,775
The water blast has wrecked
damage control!

40
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:53,775
Water has flooded several
parts ofthe ship, sir!

41
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,276
Message from DC HQ, sir.
Water inflow's beyond control!

42
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,875
We have vey little time, sir!

43
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:25,111
Officers and soldiers! Quick!
We must vacate the ship in 5 minutes !

44
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:16,610
Hey soldier!
Where's your life-jacket?

45
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,075
Sir, you are the commander
ofthis mission

46
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,609
You've got to make
Mission Cox Bazar a success

47
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,610
lt's my foremost responsibility
to safely transport you there

48
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,609
Do not wory about me, sir

49
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,609
Bravey and valour have been
a tradition in my family

50
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:00,611
l promise you, evey soldier
ofyours will reach you...

51
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:02,609
in order to make the mission
a success, sir

52
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,942
All the best, Papa

53
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:38,612
l'm proud to be the father of
Lieutenant Commander Vikramjit Singh

54
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,611
All the best.
- Papa, l want my son Kunal...

55
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,776
to cary forth this
tradition ofthe family

56
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:30,110
We've rescued almost all soldiers
and sent them to the upper-deck

57
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,609
But there're still a hundred soldiers.
It's impossible to save them, sir

58
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,609
Due to the explosion, both
the hedges are closed, sir

59
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,609
This place will be water-logged
in the next mo minutes

60
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:28,811
Sir, we've just received news that
the Pakistani army has surrendered

61
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:36,611
You have given death to innocents.
You are lucky to survive today

62
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:41,610
But if we ever face each other
in war again...

63
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,375
that will be the last day
ofyour life

64
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,275
Arrest him!

65
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,610
Captain Sirohi welcomes you to the
desert festival in Rajasthan

66
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,112
The BSF, the army and the civilians are
taking part in this celebration and ...

67
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:19,611
that's the biggest secret why this crowd
has assembled. But let me tell you...

68
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:21,608
the camels aren't running
to celebrate a wedding

69
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,776
They're participating in a camel race
that is already underway

70
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:32,613
There's a tight race bemeen
Captain Trilok and Captain Kunaljit

71
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,610
And surprisingly, Captain Kunaljit,
for whom victoy is a habit...

72
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:42,778
is today trailing behind!
What remains to be seen is whether...

73
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:46,110
Captain Kunaljit wins this race
or loses it to Captain Trilok

74
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,108
Captain Trilok's camel
is racing ahead...

75
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:02,110
and overtakes Captain Kunaljit's!

76
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:18,111
The lead is increasing and the
finishing-line is getting closer...

77
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:20,609
and Kunaljit finally
wins the race!

78
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:29,113
Kunaljit has evey right to sing,
''l set out on a camel...''

79
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:37,114
''came across a turn in the desert,
and l leR eveyone trailing!''

80
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:53,110
Amazing! l don't even ty and yet
l always emerge as the winner!

81
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,242
l'm tired of victoy!

82
00:23:55,407 --> 00:24:00,111
Actually, you really deserve this Cup.
Your camel had tripped. Here you are

83
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,609
ls there a difference bemeen
your victoy and mine?

84
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,775
Hang on! Out of my way!

85
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:09,378
There is a difference!
He used a prank to win the race!

86
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,109
Prank...?
- Yes, l saw him at it!

87
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:15,109
What prank?
- When your camel was ahead...

88
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:18,110
Hang on... one moment!
l want to have a word with the doctor

89
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,642
C'mon, Sakshi!
l know you're a friend

90
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,575
You have evey right
to play a joke...

91
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,442
but when are you going to
stop instigating people?

92
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,108
You're the one l want to
give up his pranks

93
00:24:28,474 --> 00:24:30,108
lfyou give up your habits first!
- l...

94
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:33,110
There you are. Fighting again!
In any case...

95
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:38,112
what victoy is this in a playground?
The real victoy lies in the battlefield

96
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:41,109
lt's simply do or die

97
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:48,445
Amazing guy! You're talking ofthe
battlefield here in the festivities?

98
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,275
Battle is bound to come
our way, my friend

99
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,778
And the day war breaks out, l'll surely
fulfill the promise l made to my father

100
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,110
Promise?
- My father was also a soldier

101
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,777
He had just one dream. That his son
one day become a big army officer

102
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,609
And l decided that l would
become an officer

103
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,446
And the day l become an officer,
he said, ''My son, five for India...''

104
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:18,610
''five for me,
five for your mother...''

105
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:23,110
''five for your wife
and five for your children''

106
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:27,110
''You must kill atleast 25
enemy soldiers in the battle''

107
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:31,611
''lfyou manage to kill more,
consider it a bonus for your friends''

108
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,776
The bonus l can vey well understand.
But sonny-boy...

109
00:25:35,274 --> 00:25:39,444
one bullet in your chest and your
family will be leR with just a pension!

110
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,110
lfyou are so scared of action,
why have you joined the army?

111
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:47,776
Scared?! l ...?
What are you talking about!

112
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,642
She forgets which family
l come from

113
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:55,110
Once l get down to the battlefield,
l'll finish all the enemies, Madam

114
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,443
But l have different ideas
about patriotism, madam

115
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:04,112
Look at the Tatas and Birlas...
are they in the army? No!

116
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:07,610
But they're still doing the nation
proud... they're serving it well

117
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:10,609
l joined the army only to
keep my grandfather happy

118
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:14,610
Just a couple ofyears. ARer that,
l'll head straight for America

119
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:20,112
l'll start a business of my own,
earn a lot of Dollars...

120
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:24,277
and also serve the nation!
- A call from your grandfather, sir!

121
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,443
Over there, sir.
- Let's go

122
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,111
Sakshi, it's said that when a man
fights with someone vey fiercely...

123
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:40,111
he's also him the most.
- Shut up! Who'd fall in love with him?

124
00:26:40,674 --> 00:26:42,509
Really...?

125
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:47,110
Actually, he's not a bad guy.
He mustjust stop fooling people

126
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:52,110
Didn't you see how he joined the army
to keep his grandpa happy?

127
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:57,642
He's not vey nice either, okay?

128
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:03,444
Grandpa! You promised to come
this time, didn't you?

129
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,777
Sory, son. As you know, there
are problems in Kashmir right now

130
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:10,609
l've been appointed Security Advisor
and l've got to rush there

131
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:13,610
Grandpa, how long are you going
to serve the nation?

132
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,475
lt's time you took it easy

133
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,108
Besides, what's the
young generation for?

134
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:21,642
We're here to serve the nation.
The young generation, grandpa!

135
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,444
l'm waiting for the day when my
grandson arrives in the battlefield

136
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,112
The day l land in the battlefield,
l'm going to the annihilate the enemy!

137
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:36,110
Ten for India, ten for you,
ten for Papa, ten for Mama...

138
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:41,112
and ten for myself. l'll return only
aRer killing atleast 60 enemy soldiers!

139
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:44,610
l believe you, my son.
- Okay, grandpa...

140
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:49,111
if l end up killing more, l'll consider
it to be a bonus for my friends!

141
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:53,109
Okay, grandpa. Take care...
Iove you, bye!

142
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:03,109
You guys heard that?
This is amazing!

143
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,609
Your dad and my grandpa are
made ofthe same stuff, Trilok!

144
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:10,111
Your dad asked you to kill 25 enemy
soldiers. And my grandpa wants 50!

145
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:13,577
My dad's dad, you see.
No wonder he'll want double!

146
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:15,775
And l said l'd triple the count!

147
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:22,112
Aren't you ashamed, Kunal...?
You're so shameless!

148
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:25,443
Wait there, l'll show you...
- Help!

149
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,109
Where're you going, Kunal...?

150
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:42,111
Take a look, Papa. Kunal has sent
these pictures from the desert festival

151
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:47,110
Even aRerjoining the army, there
has been no change in his attitude

152
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:51,110
He's the same fun-loving prankster.
l'm always afraid...

153
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:56,444
have we made a mistake by
sending him into the army?

154
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:03,113
He's my grandson, daughter-in-law.
He had to join the army

155
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:07,110
There's no need to be afraid.
He has my blood flowing in his veins

156
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,611
Wait and see. Like his father
Vikramjit Singh...

157
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:14,109
he will some day bring gloy
to the nation and to his family

158
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:32,110
This is so boring, Trilok.
Haven't found a sucker in days

159
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,777
There he is! Our commentator!
l'm not sparing him today

160
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,110
This is what you'll keep doing!
Don't ever get serious in life!

161
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,610
Doctor, living it up is life!
Have fun some times

162
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:49,610
Now don't ruin our mood, okay?
Let's go! Quick!

163
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,110
Keep whispering and he's bound
to get conscious and look here

164
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,242
lt's going to be fun

165
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:14,109
Keep watching. l'll make a move

166
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:26,443
Captain Trilok, what were
you guys saying about me?

167
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,109
Nothing at all.
- Mustn't have been praising me surely?

168
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,110
Mr Sirohi, don't keep jumping like this.
- Don'tjump...?

169
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:37,109
No, evemhing else is okay.
- Hello!

170
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:39,609
''Evemhing else is okay...?''
So what's wrong?

171
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:41,641
Actually...

172
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,576
You haven't told him about the cyst
and the cancer, have you?

173
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,111
No...
- Excuse me. Cyst, cancer...?

174
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,111
what are you talking about?
- Mr Sirohi, you're absolutely...

175
00:36:55,807 --> 00:37:00,611
Yes, there is a difference.
But this happens in Thailand, isn't it?

176
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:03,608
Oh yes, Thailand.
- Have you ever been to Thailand?

177
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,610
Never. Why?
- Your right thigh...

178
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,110
is thinner than your leR. And when
one thigh is different from the other...

179
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:15,612
it's called the legophobia. But it's
normally found only in Thailand

180
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,611
How do we find a case here?
- But my thighs look all right!

181
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:23,777
l can see no difference.
- Sir, it's on the rear

182
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:26,609
rear..?
- How will you be able to see it?

183
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:31,110
No, l'm absolutely all right!
What rubbish are you talking!

184
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,609
Don't chew on my brains!

185
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:11,108
Legophobia!

186
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:31,776
Attention! The CO has arrived

187
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:40,277
10 officers, 12 JCOs and a hundred
soldiers are present at the parade, sir!

188
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:44,609
Right turn!

189
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:48,443
Quick march!

190
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,776
What happened, Kunal?
- Nothing, sir, l've sprained my foot!

191
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,609
But don't wory, sir!
l'll join the parade!

192
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:08,111
One minute! Captain Sakshi,
please examine Kunal's foot

193
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,342
lt's okay, sir...

194
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,108
Does it hurt?
- Yes

195
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:19,110
He won't be able to march, sir!
He's sprained his foot

196
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,443
No, sir! It's a minor injuy.
l'm okay

197
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,110
No, Kunal, no!
- But l'm a soldier, sir!

198
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,775
Trilok, Ram Singh...
give Kunal a hand

199
00:39:32,707 --> 00:39:34,575
Where are you going, Kunal?
- The hospital

200
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,777
But it's in that direction.
- That...? Why not over here?

201
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:43,742
Take him inside.
l'll join you soon

202
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:47,444
Kunal? An ailment in my leg
and you're the one who's limping?

203
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:52,112
You won't get it! Go ahead with
your treatment. l'm leaving!

204
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:54,109
What's the drama for?
Where are you going?

205
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,609
Didn't l tell you?
l saw that girl...

206
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,610
the doe-eyed beauty,
who has long, flowing tresses...?

207
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,609
l saw her on the campus today!
l'm going to look for her!

208
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:05,609
He'll never change

209
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:12,445
Excuse me, Dr Sakshi do you really
think there's a problem with my thighs?

210
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,109
Trilok! You're my friend...
- Please!

211
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:24,111
Amazing! The lease on my life's
running out, and they say ''please'' !

212
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,609
Welcome to 10 Para
Commando Battalion, sir

213
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,609
Why isn't Kunal around?

214
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,443
Why didn't he even get
the radio message?

215
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,776
The sprain in his foot had healed.
Isn't it, Dr Sakshi?

216
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:13,777
Sir, your grandfather's here.
- Grandfather...? l'm dead!

217
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:19,109
Grandpa!
It's so good to see you!

218
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:24,443
What a pleasant surprise, grandpa!
- Where have you been?

219
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:30,112
Grandpa... as they say, no incident
takes place for years

220
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:33,110
And when they take place, you have
many ofthem in a single day!

221
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,112
Like yesterday, l sprained my ankle.
When that healed, my bike broke down

222
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:42,110
l went out to have it fixed and
l heard someone screaming on the way

223
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:46,110
lt turned out to be
a massive accident, grandpa

224
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:50,774
How could l shy away, grandpa?
Your grandson, aRer all. A soldier!

225
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:53,109
l risked my life and
Ieaped into the inferno...

226
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:58,112
and extracted that man.
Guess who he was?

227
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:00,609
My friend Naresh!
- l see

228
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:05,444
You do remember Naresh Bansal?
We studied together at the army college!

229
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:08,609
Oh yes, l do remember.
And let me remind you...

230
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:11,776
your friend Naresh is right now
in Australia, doing his MBA

231
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,576
That's right, grandpa, but...
- Only three days ago...

232
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,709
Naresh's father was at our place
for dinner

233
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:23,611
Your mother is right!
l have spoilt you silly!

234
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:28,109
That's not how it is, grandpa...
- You ought to be ashamed!

235
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,675
You go missing from the unit
and even tell lies?

236
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,109
l thought you'd bring gloy
to the family...

237
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:36,442
that you'd care for your
father's feelings... but no sir!

238
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,676
l've hurt your feelings

239
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:53,610
Do you have any idea how l've
spent evey moment since yesterday?

240
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,442
You almost took my life away!

241
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:02,108
Come here!

242
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:14,110
l was going to London for a conference,
l thought l'd meet you...

243
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:16,275
but you just wouldn't turn up

244
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:22,109
Look aRer yourself

245
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:29,743
Here comes the runner...
welcome, athlete!

246
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:32,777
lfthere was a meter
to measure fatigue...

247
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:37,778
the needle would've turned a hundred
times over and the meter would've conked

248
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:42,111
But you won't mend your ways.
By the way, what says your heart?

249
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:47,445
Did you find her?
- Mr Sirohi... l narrowly missed her

250
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,111
Had l found her, she'd have been
here with me, not you!

251
00:44:56,574 --> 00:44:59,476
Captain Kunal, you mean
Mission Impossible has failed...?

252
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:02,342
Congratulations!

253
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:06,143
When l saw your state
this morning, l thought...

254
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,311
the girl and her friends
had given you a nice beating

255
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,811
Why're you bothering me?
- l'm bothering you!

256
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:18,310
We're the ones who're bothered when we
think about what's going to happen...

257
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,141
ofyour desires

258
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:28,311
Desires are born so that
they are fulfilled some day

259
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:36,309
Would you mind giving me a massage?

260
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:11,810
Sakshi, where're you going?
- l'm not going an_here

261
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:14,476
There's a farce being enacted.
Let's watch it up front

262
00:52:02,874 --> 00:52:05,974
Excuse me...
you're an amazing dancer!

263
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:09,477
l couldn't help coming to the stage
and here now... forgive me

264
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:13,277
Excuse me.
- Excuse me... one second

265
00:52:13,507 --> 00:52:17,143
You're an amazing dancer, no doubt.
But l'd like to give you some tips

266
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,811
The dance was good, but there
were a couple of shortcomings

267
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:23,308
Shweta...
- Uncle!

268
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:27,477
You are great! Let's go. Hury up.
- l'll change and join you

269
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:32,276
Excuse me...
- Hey Mister!

270
00:52:33,507 --> 00:52:36,810
l recognised you on the stage!
l recognised you on the stage

271
00:52:37,107 --> 00:52:38,341
l'm Sushil Kumar Bhansali

272
00:52:39,174 --> 00:52:41,142
Your ship sank and l thought
you were dead

273
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:45,811
But your personality's really evolved!
- Never mind me...

274
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:48,042
is she your niece?
- Yes, my niece

275
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,810
Forget about my niece. You and l
were in the NDA together. 30 years ago!

276
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:55,310
You've shaved offyour beard and
Iook young and handsome again!

277
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:57,475
What's the secret ofyour youth?
l want to be young too

278
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:02,811
My secret is that l climb trees
evey day... the wrong way

279
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:05,476
l eat up no less than
1 1 kilos of grass

280
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:09,477
Evey morning, l grind together the
herb Tulsi, neem and betel-leaves...

281
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,310
with a lavish helping of either
a cow's or a buffalo's scatter

282
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:15,309
lfthat's not available,
a camel's dropping will do...

283
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:18,309
l have a lot oftips to offer.
Give me your address...

284
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,809
l'll come to your house and
explain evemhing in detail

285
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,141
That's fantastic, my friend!

286
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:24,810
We've always been buddies and...
- Siren...?

287
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,810
An emergency meeting has been called
in the ops right now

288
00:53:34,374 --> 00:53:38,344
All officers and JCOs are expected
to report immediately

289
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:44,942
Mr Bhansali, the card...?
- Oh yes

290
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:47,109
How else will give you any tips?
- Of course

291
00:53:48,974 --> 00:53:49,941
And...

292
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:01,811
l'll sure come to give you the tips.
- Why not?

293
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:06,143
lt's going to take me time, Shweta.
l'll see you off at the car

294
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:09,309
Our unit has been entrusted
a special mission

295
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:11,542
All leave has therefore
been cancelled

296
00:54:13,074 --> 00:54:17,978
At 1400 hours tomorrow, our unit
will leave Jaisalmer for Jammu

297
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,807
Captain Kunal...
- Yes, sir?

298
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,808
You are to be in-charge
of unit mobilisation

299
00:54:26,841 --> 00:54:32,813
''O handsome beloved,
welcome to my land''

300
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,810
You want to desert your unit for 2
hours so you can go and meet Shweta

301
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:42,812
And you want me to give you
a certificate, citing ill-health?

302
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:45,810
Aren't you ashamed?
- Why don't you understand?

303
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,409
l've done my duty as far as the
mobilisation is concerned

304
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:51,075
We've supposed to leave
tomorrow morning, Sakshi!

305
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:54,242
l have only tonight

306
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:06,279
lf l don't tell Shweta how l feel now,
l don't know when again...

307
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,310
So what am l to do, Kunal?
l can't sign such a certificate

308
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:11,475
Why can't you?
- l can't! And that's it!

309
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,810
And l thought you were the only one
who really understood me

310
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,575
Nice friend you are!

311
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:35,310
ln any case, how would you know
what love is...?

312
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:38,809
and what it means
to lose your beloved

313
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:56,809
Here you are

314
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:13,475
Kunal! Stop there!
The storm's getting worse!

315
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:17,311
This storm is nothing compared to
the tempest of love in my heart!

316
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,308
You!

317
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,809
This is amazing!
l had been to your place to meet you

318
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,276
What?
- Those tips in dancing, remember?

319
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,811
l'm leaving for the border tomorrow.
- Get me out first!

320
00:58:06,574 --> 00:58:08,809
Oh sure, one moment

321
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:10,974
Come

322
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:33,542
Have some water

323
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:31,808
l don't know why...

324
01:00:33,374 --> 01:00:36,143
l'm tempted to delve into the
hidden stories behind these ruins

325
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:41,309
The paintings are so beautiful

326
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:45,276
As ifthey convey the legend
of someone's love

327
01:00:47,341 --> 01:00:48,809
Don't you think so too?

328
01:00:51,174 --> 01:00:53,142
lsn't it strange?

329
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,812
When those in love lose their
hearts to each other...

330
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:03,809
they themselves don't get to know

331
01:01:07,974 --> 01:01:09,809
As a poet has said...

332
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:13,809
''When l told her hand...''

333
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:18,142
''bemeen our hands is built
a memorial of love''

334
01:01:21,207 --> 01:01:24,143
l think we must leave.
- One minute, Shweta...

335
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:28,810
Ever since l've seen you,
l've lost my heart to you

336
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:34,811
l wish to make you part of my life.
l want to mary you

337
01:01:36,974 --> 01:01:38,942
What are you saying? Do you know
who you are talking to?

338
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:41,809
l'm notjoking, l'm serious

339
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:47,310
But it can't happen.
It's impossible!

340
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:52,812
Why is it impossible?
l love you, Shweta

341
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:07,811
''You are vey naive, O heart,
you shall be made to weep''

342
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:13,478
''You will regret meeting
these charming lasses, by God''

343
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:46,315
''For God's sake, may l behold
something beautiful?''

344
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:53,813
''l've met several
stone-hearted men...''

345
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:57,810
''if l could now see
someone with a heart?''

346
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:09,813
''Tell the skies, ifthey
wish to see how high l fly...''

347
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,309
''they ought to grow
taller in stature''

348
01:03:15,341 --> 01:03:19,211
''Tell the beautiful ones, ifthey
wish to discover what love is...''

349
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:22,141
''they ought to meet me''

350
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,809
Fantastic!

351
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:37,146
''l've seen many who could lay
down their lives for their love''

352
01:03:37,574 --> 01:03:39,542
''But what may l say,
my dear man...?''

353
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:41,808
''love is no laughing matter''

354
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:43,808
Bravo!

355
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:46,808
''l am a firefly...''

356
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:49,309
''l seek the flame,
l seek the night''

357
01:03:57,507 --> 01:03:59,475
''l'm willing to lay down
my life...''

358
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,276
''provided she expects me to''

359
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:09,310
One minute...
l have something to say

360
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:14,311
What will l say to this lady?
She's already saying so much!

361
01:07:55,341 --> 01:08:00,145
Kunwar-ji... wait!

362
01:08:00,507 --> 01:08:01,808
Wait.

363
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:09,810
This locket of Lord Shiva
will protect you on the battlefield

364
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,809
l'll come back soon...

365
01:08:17,374 --> 01:08:19,342
and take you away.
Look aRer yourself

366
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:30,311
l almost died when l got the news
that he had gone missing in action

367
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:35,812
But l have a strong feeling that
he will return... he surely will

368
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:43,810
l waited for him evey moment

369
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:47,309
And Surinder arrived
to tell me that...

370
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:14,210
Sir, they've started heavy shelling!

371
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:16,809
Sohan Singh and Bhajan Singh
had gone to the stream

372
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,811
They were ambushed and Sohan Singh
has been mamred

373
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:24,210
Send a message to the artilley
to commence firing!

374
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,211
Alpha... the enemy has started shelling.
Orders are to retaliate

375
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,479
He was such a dear friend.
Look what the enemy has done to him!

376
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:41,544
What will l say to his folks, sir?
How will l answer them?

377
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:46,344
We deeply regret Sohan Singh's death.
But we must advance...

378
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:50,211
We must go ahead. Let's go!
- It's dangerous to climb the terrain!

379
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:53,810
The enemy is perched at the top,
we're all sitting ducks

380
01:10:54,007 --> 01:10:57,076
We'll all get killed like Sohan Singh.
- Cut the crap!

381
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:00,208
And stop cying!

382
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,210
And ifyou must cy, hang on
to your wife's apron-strings!

383
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:08,810
You're a Rajput! A warrior!
Do you get that?

384
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:13,810
lfyou really loved him,
you must avenge his death!

385
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:16,309
lfthey've killed one man,
you must kill ten ofthem!

386
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:23,211
Let's salute the glorious men
who see such rare honour

387
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:28,212
For they are fortunate, they have
shed their blood for their nation

388
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:34,211
Har Har Mahadev!
(A Hindu war-cy)

389
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:43,309
The terrorists were at
a great height

390
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:47,477
lt wasn't easy for the Indian troops
to get to them

391
01:11:48,341 --> 01:11:53,145
Climbing the mountains was a tough job.
And the terrorists lay in hiding

392
01:11:59,974 --> 01:12:03,477
Braving the difficult conditions
for 2 days and 2 nights...

393
01:12:04,107 --> 01:12:06,943
they managed to get close
to the enemy. But...

394
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:13,141
Crush the infidels!

395
01:13:11,674 --> 01:13:12,641
What happened to the artilley?

396
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:15,309
Can't open fire in these
conditions for our safety, sir!

397
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,943
You have some ammo, Surinder?
- No, sir

398
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,310
Salam aliekom, brother.
- Salam aliekom

399
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:33,976
They have artilley cover!
But we have nothing!

400
01:13:35,907 --> 01:13:39,810
lt'll be dawn soon
and we'll get killed!

401
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:44,108
We need to do something!

402
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,309
Looks like the infidels
have run out of ammo

403
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:50,310
Don't we have anything, Surinder?
- No, sir

404
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,109
Where will they go an_ay?
At daybreak...

405
01:13:57,907 --> 01:14:00,976
You had some petrol, didn't you?
- Yes, sir. Here you are

406
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:10,643
We must somehow get into
the enemy camp...

407
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:15,445
and explode this petrol-bomb
in their ammo supply

408
01:14:17,874 --> 01:14:19,842
One of us will have
to offer a sacrifice

409
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:21,808
Order me to go, sir!

410
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:25,309
l want to go, sir!
- Me, sir!

411
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:28,641
l want to go, sir! l do!

412
01:14:32,341 --> 01:14:35,310
ln the marketplace of death,
we have offered our sons

413
01:14:36,074 --> 01:14:38,042
Whenever the nation has
sought one life...

414
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,975
we have laid down many

415
01:14:42,074 --> 01:14:44,309
None ofyou is going there.
- Please let me go, sir

416
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,308
No, that's my order

417
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:54,310
Surinder, this letter...

418
01:14:57,074 --> 01:14:59,309
and this locket of Lord Shiva...

419
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:08,310
Even Lord Shiva wants me to
confront the enemy

420
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:13,311
Give it to my wife, Surinder.
- Vey well, sir

421
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:28,311
ARer our victoy, you will raise
a toast. In my name

422
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:30,442
Yes, sir.
- Best of luck!

423
01:16:08,474 --> 01:16:09,775
Bring him over!

424
01:16:23,907 --> 01:16:26,309
Let's put our skills to test

425
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:33,312
You can use your bullets.
l'll use my courage

426
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,308
lnfidel!

427
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:58,979
''ln that case, you
must get married again''

428
01:17:00,141 --> 01:17:02,810
''Else, there will always be
a burden on my soul''

429
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:15,309
''Shweta, l'm terribly sory
for whatever you've been through''

430
01:18:16,607 --> 01:18:19,810
''But makes me feel worse is
that Rajiv's death...''

431
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:21,808
''has made you turn away from
facing the realities of life''

432
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:25,978
''But life is to embrace
eveyjoy that comes your way''

433
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:29,309
''Should you have any
feelings for me...''

434
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:31,675
''l would like to mary you''

435
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:35,310
''Please come to the station before
my train leaves at 2 this aRernoon''

436
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:40,778
''Your arrival will be the
best ever giR for me - Kunal''

437
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:50,342
What are you thinking about, Shweta?

438
01:18:51,007 --> 01:18:55,311
lt's 2 years since Rajeev went missing.
How long will you endure the loneliness?

439
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:59,643
Kunal's a vey good boy and he
comes from a vey decent family

440
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:04,309
Stop thinking and just
go to him, my child

441
01:19:07,374 --> 01:19:10,643
You forget, this is exactly
what Rajiv wished too

442
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:16,309
Stop brooding, my child.
Go on

443
01:19:22,141 --> 01:19:24,109
Hold this.

444
01:19:24,874 --> 01:19:26,308
What does it say?
- Yes

445
01:19:27,574 --> 01:19:29,542
Take another look

446
01:19:32,341 --> 01:19:34,910
Will she come?
- Yes!

447
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:39,977
Evey chit says she's coming,
there's none that says no

448
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:42,309
How can l write she's not coming?

449
01:19:43,841 --> 01:19:48,312
Can l ever write that...?
- l'm sure she'll come

450
01:19:52,007 --> 01:19:56,311
But she happens to be a widow
Will your folks accept a war widow?

451
01:19:57,841 --> 01:19:59,309
How's she to blame
if she has been widowed?

452
01:19:59,874 --> 01:20:01,842
She has some feelings too,
doesn't she?

453
01:20:03,574 --> 01:20:05,309
She has a right to life!

454
01:20:09,141 --> 01:20:13,812
Kunal, l always knew
you were kind-hearted

455
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:17,977
But you're so kind-hearted...?
l didn't know that

456
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,509
The train has arrived.
- Hury up

457
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:31,644
C'mon, Kunal.
- Go ahead. l'll join you

458
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:42,812
C'mon! Get in, Kunal

459
01:20:50,674 --> 01:20:51,641
Shweta!

460
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:07,641
Eveybody said...

461
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:11,310
but l was sure that you'd come.
- You'll miss your train

462
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:13,809
l'll come back soon!

463
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:16,843
Thank you!
Look aRer yourself, okay?

464
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:41,309
Why're you so startled?

465
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:46,811
l'm the one you were in love with

466
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:55,311
Where had you gone away?
- l'm surprised too

467
01:22:57,341 --> 01:23:01,311
l had told my unit not to convey
news of my arrival to you

468
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:05,310
But looks like they couldn't
keep the secret...

469
01:23:06,141 --> 01:23:08,309
and you came here,
to receive me

470
01:23:10,874 --> 01:23:14,811
l like it... l love it

471
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:32,842
Sikander, Anwar had called
from the consulate

472
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:35,309
He wants us to have a meeting
with him aRer this conference

473
01:23:56,874 --> 01:23:59,643
How're you doing,
Mr Amarjit Singh?

474
01:24:04,141 --> 01:24:05,475
Recognise me?

475
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:11,311
Mr Sikander Khan?
- This meeting is just a coincidence

476
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:17,812
But to be honest, l'm looking forward
to meeting you on the battlefield

477
01:24:19,341 --> 01:24:22,977
Let's see how you will be able
to keep your promise

478
01:24:23,674 --> 01:24:27,310
We have already. In three wars

479
01:24:28,474 --> 01:24:32,311
What are you looking for now?
Mourning?

480
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:40,712
Gentlemen, l'd like to remind you
that India has, on several occasions...

481
01:24:40,941 --> 01:24:43,643
tried to establish peace
with Pakistan

482
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,643
The Shimla Agreement,
the Samjhauta Express...

483
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:50,443
the Prime Minister's bus trip
to Lahore...

484
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:56,412
but alas! We were rewarded
with Siachen and Kargil

485
01:24:57,341 --> 01:25:01,311
An attack on the Akshardam temple,
the hijacking of a plane

486
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:04,543
an attack on our Parliament
in broad daylight

487
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:08,711
ln fact, they did not even spare
our holy pilgrimage ofAmarnath

488
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:10,942
That is the struggle of
the Kashmiri separatists.

489
01:25:11,474 --> 01:25:15,811
lndeed. And you only give them
arms and training

490
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:18,910
There's a limit to
accusations, sir

491
01:25:20,974 --> 01:25:24,711
When a temple oftheirs is attacked,
they say Pakistan is behind it

492
01:25:25,341 --> 01:25:29,878
They have communal riots,
and they blame the Pakistani hand

493
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:35,712
lt won't be surprising, that ifthere
is an earthquake in your county...

494
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:40,978
you still won't miss the opportunity
to blame the Pakistani hand!

495
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:45,944
This is the international community,
not a meeting of ignorant fools

496
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:51,310
The latest evidence oftheir
involvement, sir...

497
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:56,312
is that they've taken control
of our outpost at Tigri

498
01:25:56,641 --> 01:25:58,709
This is absolutely untrue!

499
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,310
That outpost has been ours for years.
- Really?

500
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:05,710
You've even been saying for years
that Kashmir is yours

501
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,710
You will soon stake a claim to Delhi.
Where will we go then?

502
01:26:08,874 --> 01:26:10,375
To Islamabad and Lahore?

503
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:27,876
Please wory about your
own nation, mister

504
01:26:37,974 --> 01:26:40,309
lt makes me sad to say
this to you

505
01:26:41,341 --> 01:26:43,710
When there was an attack
on your World Trade Center...

506
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:46,309
you pounded Afghanistan
with missiles

507
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,509
ln fact, you didn't even spare Iraq

508
01:26:50,341 --> 01:26:53,310
And now you advise us that
this issue ofterrorism...

509
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,309
we must resolve with talks

510
01:26:56,007 --> 01:27:00,444
All right! We know well,
how to defend our nation

511
01:27:00,974 --> 01:27:04,877
lf need be, we can do to them what
you did to Afghanistan and Iraq

512
01:27:12,807 --> 01:27:16,310
As all ofyou know,
our talks in London...

513
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:18,775
over global terrorism, have failed

514
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:24,813
What you also know is that the enemy
has occupied our terrain illegally...

515
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:31,980
from which position they can attack
the pilgrims headed for Amarnath

516
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:36,811
Our unit has to launch a silent
attack to recapture that post

517
01:27:39,007 --> 01:27:44,312
You are given adequate ammunition
and rations for 48 hours. Any doubts?

518
01:27:44,774 --> 01:27:47,309
Our aim is to recapture the post
at Tigri within 48 hours

519
01:27:48,341 --> 01:27:52,311
But we have rations enough to
Iast us 12 hours in an emergency

520
01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:54,842
Why must we cary so much an_ay?

521
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:58,977
lnstead of extra-rations, we ought
to cary extra ammunition

522
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,977
lf our mission is extended
for some reason...

523
01:28:03,841 --> 01:28:05,809
the Quarter Master
can extend help to us

524
01:28:06,507 --> 01:28:10,644
lfthe Quarter Master can break up
50 of his porters into units of 10...

525
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:12,775
Kunal, l appreciate your point

526
01:28:14,341 --> 01:28:16,109
You have done a Quarters
Master's course, haven't you?

527
01:28:18,474 --> 01:28:20,642
Okay, you're not going to battle.
- But, sir...

528
01:28:20,874 --> 01:28:23,776
You'll stay here at the base and
perForm Quarter Master's duty

529
01:28:30,707 --> 01:28:34,310
l told you! l'd do something
that would make the Colonel...

530
01:28:34,474 --> 01:28:37,310
assign me duty at the base-camp,
instead of sending me to battle

531
01:28:38,507 --> 01:28:42,811
l must get to Neha as soon as possible.
- Love is what has spoilt you...

532
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:50,811
Here you are. Your mother has sent
some savouries for you

533
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:06,310
Colonel Rathod has assigned me
Quarter Master's duty at the base...

534
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:10,644
instead of sending me to battle.
- Yes, l got to know

535
01:29:11,707 --> 01:29:13,642
But you needn't wory

536
01:29:14,007 --> 01:29:17,977
l've requested your CO
to send you to battle

537
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:25,811
Great! Now, l'll slay 10 in your name,
ten for Papa...

538
01:29:26,674 --> 01:29:29,309
So much of lies... what for?

539
01:29:30,874 --> 01:29:33,810
Why do you act so smart?
What is your problem?

540
01:29:34,841 --> 01:29:36,642
Are you afraid of fighting?
Are you a coward?

541
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:42,311
That's not true, grandpa.
You know it vey well...

542
01:29:43,841 --> 01:29:47,811
and even Mummy told you that l didn't
want to join the army

543
01:29:50,007 --> 01:29:52,309
l wanted to go to America
and start a business

544
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:58,311
lt's such a shame that the educated
youth of our county...

545
01:30:00,807 --> 01:30:03,309
do not want to join the army...

546
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:07,310
but give more importance
to amassing money

547
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:10,977
They head for foreign shores.
- And what's wrong with that, grandpa?

548
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:14,809
l want to earn money
and make progress in life

549
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:17,809
Don't l have a right to do that?

550
01:30:18,507 --> 01:30:20,475
What difference will it make if
l'm not part ofthe army?

551
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:25,309
Army!

552
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,975
You know how an army is built?

553
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:34,810
An army is built with
evey single soldier

554
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:40,310
lf heroes ofthe army like you desert
the army for their own selfish ends...

555
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:44,311
who will confront the nation
in its hour of crisis?

556
01:30:48,341 --> 01:30:53,312
Think about it. If a gang of
bandits get into your house...

557
01:30:55,007 --> 01:30:57,809
what will you do? Run out
on your wife and kids?

558
01:30:58,507 --> 01:31:00,475
Orjust sit there and
middle your thumbs?

559
01:31:02,307 --> 01:31:04,275
Make money and progress!

560
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:07,809
Who gives the enemy a fitting
response, in that case?

561
01:31:10,974 --> 01:31:17,146
lt's such a shame!
Despite being Vikramjit Singh's son...

562
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:20,275
you subscribe to such
a line ofthought!

563
01:31:22,974 --> 01:31:27,812
Always remember, son. Ifyou are not
devoted to the nation you're born in...

564
01:31:28,507 --> 01:31:35,814
you betray your own mother,
and let down your father!

565
01:31:41,641 --> 01:31:44,810
l want to see you victorious.
Victorious!

566
01:34:13,341 --> 01:34:15,142
Har Har Mahadev!
(a Hindu battle cy)

567
01:34:41,841 --> 01:34:43,142
Cary him inside. Quick!

568
01:36:16,507 --> 01:36:20,143
Get him!
l want him alive!

569
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:03,141
No!

570
01:38:13,641 --> 01:38:14,808
Trilok!

571
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:17,142
No, Trilok...!

572
01:38:23,374 --> 01:38:25,142
Didn't l tell you...?

573
01:38:26,974 --> 01:38:28,942
l'd kill at least 25 ofthem

574
01:38:31,507 --> 01:38:33,275
And l've killed so many

575
01:38:35,841 --> 01:38:39,811
You... you now have
to keep your word

576
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:47,311
l now want to see the Tricolour
being hoisted on the peak

577
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,308
Hoist the flag

578
01:39:10,341 --> 01:39:17,314
''O Motherland, we bow to Thee''

579
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:28,812
''Even ifwe are beheaded,
even if our blood flows...''

580
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:37,813
''this soil ought never to endure
the anguish of slavey again''

581
01:39:42,307 --> 01:39:45,810
Forgive me, Trilok.
l could do nothing for you

582
01:39:50,307 --> 01:39:54,811
l wish you could see the Tricolour
being unfurled

583
01:39:58,307 --> 01:40:03,311
''May our Tricolour soar higher
than the skies...''

584
01:40:16,841 --> 01:40:19,810
Sir, we have captured the post.
We have won the battle, sir!

585
01:40:20,074 --> 01:40:22,810
Kunaljit Singh displayed
rare bravey, sir

586
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:33,812
Wake up, O traveller.
It's dawn already

587
01:40:34,307 --> 01:40:39,812
Those that sleep, lose.
Those that awaken, gain

588
01:40:41,507 --> 01:40:43,809
The officer has climbed
the tree again

589
01:40:44,574 --> 01:40:48,277
Looks like the tree's going
to give way someday

590
01:40:49,574 --> 01:40:55,279
Sir! l've brought your diet!
Weeds and grass!

591
01:40:55,907 --> 01:40:58,809
You asked me to wash my hands...

592
01:40:59,174 --> 01:41:03,144
but l even washed the greens
with soap

593
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:08,312
Vey good! But where's
the camel's scatter?

594
01:41:09,507 --> 01:41:15,312
You're neither wise nor clever!
You're a dumb idiot! Stupid!

595
01:41:16,641 --> 01:41:18,142
Seek, and you shall find evemhing

596
01:41:18,307 --> 01:41:22,811
Forgive me, sir, in my 45 years,
l haven't seen people living on grass...

597
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:26,811
and doing their workouts!
- You never will!

598
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:32,812
Had you met Vikram you'd have known
what good health really means

599
01:41:33,574 --> 01:41:37,477
l'm following the tips
he gave me, you idiot!

600
01:41:38,374 --> 01:41:44,480
Look at my agility!
l want to turn 32 again!

601
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:47,810
ls it the same Vikram Singh...?
- Get lost, you moron!

602
01:41:48,007 --> 01:41:50,476
Pick up your glasses!
You can't do a thing properly...

603
01:41:51,174 --> 01:41:54,310
and you'll keep advising me!

604
01:41:56,107 --> 01:42:01,612
Shweta's being seen off
in mo days

605
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:05,142
My Neem leaves!

606
01:42:07,874 --> 01:42:10,710
''The auspicious hour
is here...''

607
01:42:10,974 --> 01:42:13,810
''it comes bearing happiness''

608
01:42:22,007 --> 01:42:28,480
''With your husband, may you
rule the roost, O bride''

609
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:32,811
Sister, you forgot your books
of poety in the cupboard!

610
01:42:42,374 --> 01:42:46,811
What books do you keep reading...?
Josh Malihabadi!

611
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:57,313
What is it that is closer
to your heart than me?

612
01:42:57,841 --> 01:43:00,810
Nothing... it's just a letter
from one of my friends

613
01:43:01,274 --> 01:43:06,278
Really? Why does she feel shy
to speak lies in my presence?

614
01:43:06,441 --> 01:43:09,811
For that matter, eveyone
speaks lies to some extent

615
01:43:14,307 --> 01:43:16,142
l know you never tell lies

616
01:43:17,341 --> 01:43:19,142
But l can surelyjoke
with you, can't l?

617
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:24,812
Joke...? It's life that
has played a joke on me

618
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:30,477
There's so much l want
to tell you about

619
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:35,475
l know what
you must've been through

620
01:43:37,507 --> 01:43:41,143
l don't want to go into the past
and lose these precious moments

621
01:43:43,641 --> 01:43:45,609
There's a lot of pain
in the past

622
01:43:56,341 --> 01:43:58,810
You're at a base camp
in the Kargil sector

623
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:03,311
You've had a serious head injuy and
regained consciousness aRer 2 weeks

624
01:44:27,641 --> 01:44:30,810
Good news, Major. Allah's on the
side ofthe Pakistanis

625
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:37,145
An Indian Major has fallen in our hands.
Make sure he's firmly in our trap

626
01:44:37,841 --> 01:44:40,810
Ty and ferret out evey
crucial secret from him...

627
01:44:41,307 --> 01:44:44,810
so that this lost war of Kargil,
we can turn into victoy

628
01:44:45,407 --> 01:44:47,142
We found these maps on you

629
01:44:47,641 --> 01:44:49,809
According to these maps,
you were found here

630
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:52,342
But there's no trace of
the rest ofyour men

631
01:44:52,841 --> 01:44:56,477
Maybe they're in trouble too.
We want to help them

632
01:45:02,374 --> 01:45:04,342
The wound ought to have healed
in mo days

633
01:45:05,307 --> 01:45:07,275
How many weeks since l arrived here?
- 2 weeks

634
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:15,142
You got a cigarette?

635
01:45:19,641 --> 01:45:20,608
A match?

636
01:45:38,341 --> 01:45:41,310
Do not watch me so cynically

637
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,479
What sort of a marksman are you?
Your arrows are bent

638
01:45:50,174 --> 01:45:53,810
What do you mean?
- Made in Pakistan

639
01:45:56,207 --> 01:45:58,809
You should've at least given me
an Indian match-box

640
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:11,314
Major Rajiv, the moment l met you,
l knew you were a vey smart man...

641
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:17,312
who wouldn't fall in our trap.
So l've spoken to my superiors. Farooq

642
01:46:23,341 --> 01:46:26,143
ln my shoes, you'd have done
just what l'm doing

643
01:46:29,307 --> 01:46:35,146
You now have only mo choices.
Either accept this and be our friend

644
01:46:53,441 --> 01:46:58,312
Ashfaq Khan was a cruel man.
To extract secrets out of me...

645
01:46:58,841 --> 01:47:00,809
he heaped the worst kind
oftorture on me

646
01:47:01,374 --> 01:47:03,342
But l wouldn't break my silence

647
01:47:03,507 --> 01:47:04,474
Enough!

648
01:47:06,374 --> 01:47:11,812
Fed up of me, he sent me to a jail about
200 kilometers away from the border...

649
01:47:13,374 --> 01:47:15,809
where some other Indian soldiers
were already being held captive

650
01:47:25,174 --> 01:47:28,143
There were officials at the jail
who crossed all limits of atrocity...

651
01:47:29,007 --> 01:47:31,342
and conducted chemical tests on us

652
01:48:02,641 --> 01:48:06,311
l endured this journey of pain and
anguish for about mo years...

653
01:48:07,174 --> 01:48:09,142
and one day...

654
01:48:22,174 --> 01:48:24,142
Had you accepted my hand
of friendship...

655
01:48:25,307 --> 01:48:28,276
you wouldn't have had to go
through this misey

656
01:48:29,407 --> 01:48:33,811
Think it over. l promise you,
your life will be made

657
01:48:38,841 --> 01:48:41,276
You pray for my life...?

658
01:48:43,641 --> 01:48:46,143
l feel like laughing
at your simplicity

659
01:48:51,341 --> 01:48:57,313
Vey true. You have only seen
my simplicity, not my tyranny

660
01:48:58,641 --> 01:49:02,811
But you shall witness it today.
Take a good look at my soldiers...

661
01:49:05,107 --> 01:49:08,977
they're all baying for your blood!
They'll carve you to pieces

662
01:49:10,341 --> 01:49:14,311
Who dares provoke the brave?

663
01:49:17,074 --> 01:49:22,312
ln adversity, even an eunuch
takes on the lion

664
01:49:23,007 --> 01:49:23,974
Bastard!

665
01:49:25,641 --> 01:49:27,809
You Indians are the eunuchs!

666
01:49:29,374 --> 01:49:31,809
You are inflicting tyranny
on the helpless Kashmiris!

667
01:49:32,307 --> 01:49:34,809
You don the garb of peace
to hide your cowardice!

668
01:49:35,341 --> 01:49:36,809
You are the cowards!

669
01:49:38,074 --> 01:49:39,375
You are the jackals!

670
01:49:40,507 --> 01:49:45,144
Dozens ofyou inflict
torture on an unarmed man!

671
01:49:46,341 --> 01:49:50,812
Undo the fetters ifyou have
the courage! Go ahead!

672
01:49:52,374 --> 01:49:55,477
Have the balls to challenge us
openly, at least some times!

673
01:49:57,507 --> 01:50:01,811
You want a fight to the finish...?
That's what we want, too!

674
01:50:02,507 --> 01:50:04,475
So let there be a fight
to the finish!

675
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:09,310
lt's our government that has
tied our hands...

676
01:50:09,507 --> 01:50:11,275
else, we'd have decided
this issue long ago!

677
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:13,810
We'd have been sitting in Delhi!
Lording over you!

678
01:50:15,974 --> 01:50:20,144
As for the fight to the finish,
l'll give you that opportunity too

679
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:26,312
Let me see what power an
Indian mother's milk packs!

680
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:36,143
A mother's milk always
gives sustenance...

681
01:50:36,841 --> 01:50:40,544
whether she comes from India
or Pakistan

682
01:50:42,207 --> 01:50:46,144
lfthere's someone who lacks the nerve,
it's offsprings like you...

683
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:52,479
who wastes the mother's milk and also
turns his father's blood into water

684
01:50:52,841 --> 01:50:53,808
Scoundrel!

685
01:51:02,974 --> 01:51:05,810
There you are.
That's India and that's Pakistan

686
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:08,142
Let there be a duel!

687
01:51:09,974 --> 01:51:13,811
This is the promise of a Pakistani
officer! Ifyou win the duel...

688
01:51:14,107 --> 01:51:17,143
l will set you free along with
all your other prisoners!

689
01:51:17,974 --> 01:51:22,812
But should you lose, you will have to
join us in our fight against India!

690
01:51:24,174 --> 01:51:26,309
Undo his chains!

691
01:51:54,507 --> 01:51:58,811
We believe in justice. Ifyou think
you're still weak...

692
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:04,145
and not strong enough to fight, take
a few days rest. Eat well, and recover

693
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:07,142
Or else, you will lose
this opportunity...

694
01:52:08,307 --> 01:52:11,276
and time will sink you
and your friends!

695
01:52:13,341 --> 01:52:16,811
Time can never sink us...

696
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:21,810
forwe have it in us
to swim to the shores

697
01:52:23,374 --> 01:52:26,310
With hands you have drawn
misted lines of boundaries...

698
01:52:28,507 --> 01:52:31,476
we vey well know how
to rule the borders

699
01:52:49,841 --> 01:52:50,808
No!

700
01:53:39,841 --> 01:53:43,811
Long live Pakistan!

701
01:54:12,641 --> 01:54:17,812
Long live India!
Long live Hindustan!

702
01:54:30,507 --> 01:54:31,474
lnfidels!

703
01:54:48,307 --> 01:54:50,609
Get up! Up!

704
01:54:57,574 --> 01:54:59,542
Nobody touches them!
Lay off!

705
01:55:15,174 --> 01:55:18,810
lt wasn't right, sir. It has
brought shame to the entire unit

706
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:23,310
The promise you made wasn't
just a promise on your behalf...

707
01:55:24,341 --> 01:55:27,811
lt was the promise of a Pakistani
officer, which ought to have fulfilled

708
01:55:28,307 --> 01:55:31,810
So what could l do...?
Set him free? Broken the law...?

709
01:55:32,341 --> 01:55:36,478
Betrayed my county?
- Who cares for the law anymore?

710
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:39,309
Betraying the county is
a common occurrence nowadays

711
01:55:40,307 --> 01:55:43,810
This uniform is the symbol of
the trust our nation reposes in us

712
01:55:44,841 --> 01:55:47,310
We haven't been given this uniform
to infiltrate soldiers as terrorists...

713
01:55:48,574 --> 01:55:51,810
and let them do a Kargil!
And to take a beating...

714
01:55:52,307 --> 01:55:54,142
and make the masses hang
their heads in shame

715
01:55:54,341 --> 01:55:56,476
That's a question you must
put to the government!

716
01:55:57,107 --> 01:55:58,808
They've made eunuchs out of us!

717
01:55:59,507 --> 01:56:01,809
We aren't even allowed to fight
with all our whole might!

718
01:56:02,507 --> 01:56:04,275
We never get to face the enemy!

719
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:07,810
You just did.
And to what end?

720
01:56:12,641 --> 01:56:17,479
The Subedar was right.
- Shabana, this is not your classroom

721
01:56:18,374 --> 01:56:19,808
lt has to do with mo nations

722
01:56:19,974 --> 01:56:22,810
Lady, Mustaq's vomitting!
- What...?

723
01:56:24,374 --> 01:56:29,345
What happened, Mustaq...?
- What happened, my son?

724
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,277
Drugs...?! Since when
has he been taking drugs?

725
01:56:35,907 --> 01:56:40,811
Ever since he has been moving around
with the militants your army shelters

726
01:56:41,374 --> 01:56:43,209
See what the terrorists
have done to my son!

727
01:56:43,374 --> 01:56:44,341
Allah!

728
01:56:45,907 --> 01:56:47,942
Sir, the Indian soldiers
have escaped!

729
01:56:49,307 --> 01:56:50,941
Send for the doctor immediately!
l've got to leave

730
01:57:06,007 --> 01:57:08,309
Rations. For yourjourney ahead

731
01:57:10,307 --> 01:57:13,476
For your love and affection, l shall
always be indebted to Pakistan

732
01:57:14,841 --> 01:57:17,310
Thank you.
- No need to thank me

733
01:57:18,341 --> 01:57:23,813
l've merely tried to put out the fires
of hatred that rage in ours hearts

734
01:57:24,507 --> 01:57:28,310
God protect you.
- God protect you

735
01:57:44,841 --> 01:57:47,810
lt was the sheer humanity
of a kind-hearted Pakistani...

736
01:57:50,007 --> 01:57:51,808
that united me with you

737
01:57:57,407 --> 01:58:01,477
At heart, l was scared whether
you had taken my advise...

738
01:58:02,374 --> 01:58:07,545
of settling down again.
But l just couldn't believe it

739
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:13,477
Know what, Shweta? Whenever l found
a piece of paper lying in the jail...

740
01:58:14,207 --> 01:58:22,481
l wrote a letter to you, although l
knew l'd never be able to send it to you

741
01:58:24,441 --> 01:58:30,313
On my wounds and injuries,
they acted like a balm

742
01:58:32,841 --> 01:58:34,142
Just a minute

743
01:58:38,507 --> 01:58:43,144
These aren't merely letters.
They're moments l spent in your memoy

744
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:50,813
Look... so many ofthem!
In my love for you!

745
02:04:20,841 --> 02:04:23,810
''Dear Shweta, ifthere is any place
in your heart for my love...''

746
02:04:24,007 --> 02:04:25,975
''l wish to mary you''

747
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:29,811
''My train leaves at 2 p.m. this
aRernoon. Come to the station''

748
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:34,111
''lfyou come, it'll be the most
beautiful giR of my life - Kunal''

749
02:04:51,007 --> 02:04:52,808
When did you wake up?

750
02:04:53,374 --> 02:04:55,809
Looks like you woke up
vey early this morning

751
02:04:58,341 --> 02:05:02,478
When l went to sleep in your arms,
l didn't even get to know

752
02:05:09,507 --> 02:05:12,309
''l know, you're just a human being''

753
02:05:15,807 --> 02:05:19,310
''But you do mean
the world to me''

754
02:05:22,341 --> 02:05:26,311
Have you read about
this daring soldier?

755
02:05:28,874 --> 02:05:31,309
He's getting a gallanty medal.
- Kunal?

756
02:05:33,007 --> 02:05:34,308
Do you know him?

757
02:05:36,074 --> 02:05:38,976
Actually, l met him
during the desert festival

758
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:42,810
ln that case, you must personally
congratulate him! Go and get ready

759
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,309
No... how can you say
such a thing?

760
02:05:47,074 --> 02:05:51,311
ARer ages, God has given me
some precious moments with you...

761
02:05:52,007 --> 02:05:58,313
l don't want to lose them.
- Don't love me so much, wifey...

762
02:05:59,507 --> 02:06:01,475
l might die out of happiness!

763
02:06:12,941 --> 02:06:14,776
You must now keep your promise

764
02:06:28,841 --> 02:06:32,311
The next award goes to Capt. Kunal Singh
ofthe 10 Para Battalion

765
02:06:33,141 --> 02:06:35,309
Captain Kunal and his regiment
displayed rare bravey...

766
02:06:35,474 --> 02:06:38,310
by recapturing our post
at Tigri

767
02:06:38,907 --> 02:06:42,310
Despite being wounded, Captain Kunal
staked his life...

768
02:06:43,007 --> 02:06:45,642
recaptured the post and hoisted
the Tricolour there

769
02:06:46,007 --> 02:06:49,310
For his act of bravey he is being
decorated with the gallanty medal

770
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:57,313
You're not worthy ofthis medal, Kunal!
It's not your award... it's Trilok's!

771
02:12:19,007 --> 02:12:21,976
Congratulations on winning
the gallanty award

772
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:33,310
Mummy, why has he got such
a beautiful medal?

773
02:12:33,841 --> 02:12:36,977
Those that are brave are
given such medals, my child

774
02:12:37,441 --> 02:12:40,811
Wasn't my Papa brave too?
Didn't he kill the enemy?

775
02:12:41,141 --> 02:12:45,645
Your Papa was a vey brave man.
And he killed many ofthe enemy

776
02:12:53,407 --> 02:12:56,977
And this medal belongs to your Papa

777
02:13:00,841 --> 02:13:02,809
He's the one who ought
to have received it

778
02:13:21,807 --> 02:13:24,776
What's wrong, Kunal?
The pam was thrown in your honour

779
02:13:25,674 --> 02:13:28,309
So why did you leave the
celebrations and come away?

780
02:13:29,474 --> 02:13:34,312
Ma, l'm not worthy ofthis honour

781
02:13:38,007 --> 02:13:40,309
lt's Trilok Singh who
really deserves it

782
02:13:42,074 --> 02:13:44,810
What...?
- The truth is that...

783
02:13:46,007 --> 02:13:49,310
l'm alive today, only because of him

784
02:13:49,807 --> 02:13:51,308
He's the one who ought to have
been given this award

785
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:54,976
l had actually passed out
on the battlefield, mother

786
02:13:57,341 --> 02:14:00,310
Why didn't you say this earlier?

787
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:03,109
That's what is biting me, Mother.
l could not speak the truth

788
02:14:05,074 --> 02:14:07,643
Eveybody thought we won the
battle because of me!

789
02:14:07,907 --> 02:14:10,309
The award was announced and l could
not give Trilok what was his due

790
02:14:12,007 --> 02:14:13,641
And l remain silent...

791
02:14:14,007 --> 02:14:18,978
only for the honour ofthis family
and grandpa's happiness

792
02:14:22,074 --> 02:14:23,975
You madman!
What have you done!

793
02:14:29,141 --> 02:14:32,110
How could you do this?

794
02:14:38,007 --> 02:14:38,974
Grandpa!

795
02:14:51,674 --> 02:14:56,779
l have hurt your feelings!
You have evey right to punish me

796
02:14:58,674 --> 02:15:01,810
Grandpa... please say something

797
02:15:11,907 --> 02:15:13,875
You have taken my voice away

798
02:15:16,841 --> 02:15:19,810
Major General
Amarjit Singh's grandson...

799
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:23,776
Lieutenant Commander Vikramjit
Singh's son...

800
02:15:23,941 --> 02:15:25,909
was knocked senseless on
the battlefield...

801
02:15:26,674 --> 02:15:28,642
and came home with a medal that
was rightFully someone else's!

802
02:15:29,874 --> 02:15:31,642
Shame on you!

803
02:15:35,707 --> 02:15:37,675
l won several battles in the
years l've spent in the army

804
02:15:39,607 --> 02:15:43,310
But you've defeated me in this
battle of life, Kunal

805
02:15:46,807 --> 02:15:51,311
Amarjit Singh stood like a rock
in the face ofthe worst hardships...

806
02:15:52,841 --> 02:15:54,809
and you've shattered him today,
like a mere castle of sand

807
02:15:55,007 --> 02:15:56,975
Nice way you have punished us
for all our love

808
02:15:58,074 --> 02:16:07,316
Grandpa, l'm vey sory. l didn't
do it intentionally. l'm sory

809
02:16:08,474 --> 02:16:10,442
You will have to atone
for what you have done

810
02:16:11,874 --> 02:16:15,978
You will go to your Commanding
Officer right now...

811
02:16:17,341 --> 02:16:19,309
and confess to your crime

812
02:16:26,507 --> 02:16:28,475
l can't do that

813
02:16:29,841 --> 02:16:33,644
l could be Court Marshalled
if l admitted to my crime

814
02:16:35,074 --> 02:16:39,478
l'll be thrown out ofthe army...
and l want to remain in the army

815
02:16:40,007 --> 02:16:43,310
l want to achieve something.
Please forgive me, Ma

816
02:17:01,007 --> 02:17:05,644
He's not going to do anything!
Our love has spoilt him

817
02:17:06,841 --> 02:17:11,312
My grandson is not worthy ofwearing
the sacred army uniform!

818
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:15,311
Don't say such things, Papa.
Let's give Kunal another opportunity

819
02:17:15,474 --> 02:17:19,811
No, daughter-in-law, l can't!
l can't swallow the poison of his lies

820
02:17:21,274 --> 02:17:23,209
Forgive me, Papa...

821
02:17:23,741 --> 02:17:28,212
but even Lord Shiva had to drink poison
because of circumstances

822
02:17:29,707 --> 02:17:31,542
We're only human

823
02:17:34,307 --> 02:17:37,710
Please agree, Papa.
If not for my sake...

824
02:17:40,407 --> 02:17:42,375
for the sake ofyour son...?

825
02:18:00,907 --> 02:18:06,712
Mr Amarjit Singh, l'm amazed
to see your resignation letter

826
02:18:07,907 --> 02:18:11,210
How can you even think of relinquishing
your post, at a time like this?

827
02:18:13,741 --> 02:18:17,211
l'm sory, sir, but l have some
personal problems because ofwhich...

828
02:18:17,407 --> 02:18:21,210
l know that.
According to intelligence reports...

829
02:18:21,907 --> 02:18:26,211
terrorists are going to disrupt the
pilgrimage to Amarnath in a big way

830
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,208
Anything could happen

831
02:18:28,374 --> 02:18:29,842
All hell has broken loose,
Mr Governor!

832
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:32,209
May God's wrath strike
these terrorists!

833
02:18:32,707 --> 02:18:36,710
They're openly threatening us with
bloodshed in the villages!

834
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:40,543
The terrorist Abu Hamza is threatening
not to kill ordinay citizens...

835
02:18:40,774 --> 02:18:46,546
but me, the legislator Maqbool Butt,
over the phone!

836
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:50,710
Think ofthe devil and here he is!
It's him calling again!

837
02:18:53,741 --> 02:18:56,543
lt's a shame Maqbool Miyan!
You're a Muslim and...

838
02:18:56,907 --> 02:19:00,210
you're striving to make the Amarnath
pilgrimage ofthe infidels a success!

839
02:19:01,241 --> 02:19:05,712
But let me tell you that
l will never let that happen

840
02:19:06,841 --> 02:19:08,209
Abu Hamza...?

841
02:19:09,307 --> 02:19:12,209
the pilgrimage to
Lord Shiva did not stop...

842
02:19:13,241 --> 02:19:15,209
even when our nation was
enslaved to the British...

843
02:19:15,974 --> 02:19:19,711
nor even in the times when
Aurangzeb ruled the roost

844
02:19:20,307 --> 02:19:23,710
So it's you, Amarjit Singh...?

845
02:19:24,607 --> 02:19:27,876
You'd better get this idea ofthe
pilgrimage out ofyour mind

846
02:19:28,307 --> 02:19:30,709
Neither you nor your masters
can stop this pilgrimage...

847
02:19:31,907 --> 02:19:34,209
that is a symbol of brotherhood
bemeen Hindus and Muslims

848
02:19:44,707 --> 02:19:48,210
Oh yes, Mr Singh!
l totally forgot!

849
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,009
Your grandson has won
a gallanty medal

850
02:19:51,741 --> 02:19:54,710
Many congratulations on
his act of bravey

851
02:19:59,741 --> 02:20:00,875
Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir

852
02:20:17,474 --> 02:20:22,212
May the newjourney of my life succeed
with this pilgrimage ofAmarnath

853
02:20:22,841 --> 02:20:24,676
Bless me, Lord

854
02:20:27,907 --> 02:20:32,711
Congratulations on the promotion.
- To you, too

855
02:20:32,974 --> 02:20:34,208
Forget about me

856
02:20:34,441 --> 02:20:36,676
The way you recaptured the post
at Tigri, it was simply amazing!

857
02:20:36,841 --> 02:20:39,210
You simply routed the enemy!
Keep it up!

858
02:20:40,407 --> 02:20:42,208
l have something to discuss with you.
- Go ahead

859
02:20:43,407 --> 02:20:49,212
Evemhing l said about your thighs was
a lie, a joke. l'm vey sory

860
02:20:50,407 --> 02:20:52,375
Naughty boy! l get it!

861
02:20:52,774 --> 02:20:55,543
You won't get over the habit ofjoking.
You've only changed your style

862
02:20:55,741 --> 02:20:58,710
But how come a jovial guy like you
is so serious at his jokes today?

863
02:20:59,407 --> 02:21:03,210
Never mind that...
l'm getting myselftreated an_ay

864
02:21:03,774 --> 02:21:06,209
But let's meet the Colonel
before he leaves

865
02:21:06,374 --> 02:21:11,212
As you know, the caves ofAmarnath are
about 60 kilometers away from Pahalgam

866
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:16,212
About a million pilgrims are expected
to attend this month-long pilgrimage

867
02:21:16,407 --> 02:21:18,208
To take advantage ofthe confusion...

868
02:21:18,407 --> 02:21:20,876
terrorists could resort to
any sort of mischief

869
02:21:21,574 --> 02:21:26,211
But we'll have to remain vey alert.
We'll have to remain on our toes

870
02:21:31,241 --> 02:21:32,709
About turn!

871
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,209
Quick march!

872
02:21:55,374 --> 02:22:00,212
One lifetime and countless hassles.
Life is indeed vey amazing

873
02:22:02,241 --> 02:22:05,210
Get entangled in the mess,
and you get killed...

874
02:22:06,674 --> 02:22:09,343
and ifthings are solved,
it's beyond compare

875
02:22:09,741 --> 02:22:10,708
What?

876
02:22:15,507 --> 02:22:18,710
lt's a matter of pride that you
and your para-company...

877
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,709
are associated with us
for security in Amarnath

878
02:22:22,974 --> 02:22:25,543
And my heam congratulations
for your gallanty award

879
02:22:32,907 --> 02:22:36,210
You've just returned
aRer winning a battle. Take it easy

880
02:22:44,241 --> 02:22:46,710
My wife... my sweetheart

881
02:23:06,707 --> 02:23:07,674
Jai Hind, sir

882
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:12,210
Look, sir, our daring
officer Rajiv and his soldiers...

883
02:23:13,474 --> 02:23:17,211
have uncovered this cache of arms meant
for terrorist use at the pilgrimage

884
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:28,211
We have intelligence reports that
terrorists are likely to strike...

885
02:23:28,407 --> 02:23:30,709
at our arsenal in Moolganj.
- But Moolganj is your...?

886
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:38,212
Romeo, l got information for you.
Cordon offthe area around the camp

887
02:23:38,407 --> 02:23:40,208
we have information that
terrorists are about to strike

888
02:23:40,474 --> 02:23:41,708
l'm coming there with
fresh reinforcements

889
02:23:46,407 --> 02:23:48,208
Move it, guys.
Load the trucks

890
02:23:48,674 --> 02:23:50,542
Listen...
- Yes, sir?

891
02:23:51,974 --> 02:23:54,376
Don't you think you ought to send
a senior and experienced officer...

892
02:23:54,574 --> 02:23:59,211
on this important mission?
- He's a vey experienced officer sir

893
02:23:59,407 --> 02:24:01,542
ln fact, he has even
won a gallanty medal

894
02:24:01,707 --> 02:24:03,675
lncidentally, he happens to be
your grandson, sir

895
02:24:08,407 --> 02:24:10,709
C'mon! Hury up!

896
02:24:15,907 --> 02:24:18,209
Sakshi, l'm leaving on
an important mission...

897
02:24:18,407 --> 02:24:21,209
pray to God for my success, okay?
- All the best!

898
02:24:21,774 --> 02:24:24,543
Did you give Shweta my message?
- Yes, l did

899
02:24:24,741 --> 02:24:27,210
What did she have to say?
Is she okay...?

900
02:24:27,507 --> 02:24:30,209
She's badly missing me, isn't she?
She must be thinking of me!

901
02:24:30,574 --> 02:24:32,542
She is, isn't she...?
- Yes, she is

902
02:24:35,674 --> 02:24:38,209
What else did she say?
- Well...

903
02:24:38,741 --> 02:24:40,209
she's worried about you

904
02:24:41,574 --> 02:24:42,875
Go on now. We'll talk later

905
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:56,210
l'm sory, Kunal. How could l
tell you the truth...

906
02:24:56,374 --> 02:24:59,543
and pose obstacles in the new
beginning you have made in your life?

907
02:25:02,407 --> 02:25:05,877
Devotees are welcome to the pilgrimage

908
02:25:06,707 --> 02:25:10,710
Arrangements have been made for
food and stay...

909
02:25:11,241 --> 02:25:14,210
at several places in this
month-long festival

910
02:25:14,574 --> 02:25:19,211
21 days from now, only 3 days before
the Raksha Bandhan day...

911
02:25:19,507 --> 02:25:23,210
will commence the sacred ascent to
the caves ofAmarnath

912
02:25:23,907 --> 02:25:26,709
The journey to the sacred caves
is likely to take three days

913
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:31,711
This pilgrimage to Amarnath
is a symbol ofthe brotherhood...

914
02:25:31,907 --> 02:25:33,808
bemeen Hindus and Muslims

915
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:41,381
lt was a Muslim family that had
discovered this sacred shrine

916
02:25:43,441 --> 02:25:45,209
Search eveyone! Be careful

917
02:25:45,374 --> 02:25:47,209
And ever since, at least one member
ofthat family...

918
02:25:47,374 --> 02:25:48,875
takes part in this pilgrimage

919
02:25:50,907 --> 02:25:54,210
ln a way, it's a pilgrimage
undertaken by the Hindus...

920
02:25:54,741 --> 02:25:56,209
assisted by the Muslims

921
02:25:56,407 --> 02:25:59,710
lt's a pilgrimage of
brotherhood and harmony

922
02:25:59,907 --> 02:26:03,210
ln the same spirit of brotherhood
and harmony...

923
02:26:03,741 --> 02:26:06,210
this pilgrimage will be culminated

924
02:26:43,341 --> 02:26:45,209
Kunal has opened fire.
- Stop him!

925
02:26:45,374 --> 02:26:46,541
The terrorist must not
be allowed to escape!

926
02:26:46,707 --> 02:26:47,674
People might get injured.
Stop him!

927
02:27:51,974 --> 02:27:55,210
You're the one who killed Trilok!
You did!

928
02:27:55,374 --> 02:27:59,211
You killed Trilok!
l'm not sparing you!

929
02:28:00,407 --> 02:28:02,208
You guys take position there

930
02:28:02,374 --> 02:28:05,210
You have any idea, Kunal? So many
terrorists got away because ofyou?

931
02:28:07,707 --> 02:28:09,708
l only asked you to stop him!
Have you gone mad?

932
02:28:09,874 --> 02:28:13,210
Yes, l've gone mad!
Stark, raving mad!

933
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:16,543
He killed my friend!
And you want me to let him go?

934
02:28:16,974 --> 02:28:19,209
Should l have waited for your orders?

935
02:28:27,741 --> 02:28:29,209
Leave him alone...

936
02:28:29,374 --> 02:28:32,210
bring him along!
- He killed Trilok!

937
02:28:34,241 --> 02:28:35,208
Pick him up

938
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:39,210
A terrorist attack.
- You announced the pilgrimage stopped

939
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,777
Do you think the government must
stop pursuing the peace process?

940
02:28:47,974 --> 02:28:49,875
lt's for the political leaders
to decide about that

941
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:51,875
Please let us get on with our work.
- The Legislator's arriving here...

942
02:28:52,241 --> 02:28:56,211
May hell break loose on the terrorists
for the havoc they have wrought!

943
02:28:57,974 --> 02:29:00,876
They issue threats over the phone
several times a day...

944
02:29:01,441 --> 02:29:07,213
to stop the pilgrimage, or there
will be scenes of carnage eveywhere!

945
02:29:07,907 --> 02:29:15,214
God Almighty! But why don't we fly
the pilgrims directly to the cave?

946
02:29:15,574 --> 02:29:18,710
How's that possible? To call off
the pilgrimage would suggest...

947
02:29:19,241 --> 02:29:21,710
that our forces are
incompetent cowards

948
02:29:22,407 --> 02:29:24,208
lt has nothing to do with
the competence ofyour forces

949
02:29:24,407 --> 02:29:26,375
lt has to do with the lives
ofthousands of pilgrims!

950
02:29:26,907 --> 02:29:29,209
The lives of so many people
cannot be put to risk!

951
02:29:29,907 --> 02:29:32,709
ls it necessay to walk with
the sacred stick to the caves?

952
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:36,010
lt's not necessay to go to the
temple for a glimpse of God either

953
02:29:36,774 --> 02:29:40,711
God is eveywhere around us.
But have we become so defenseless...

954
02:29:41,741 --> 02:29:45,211
that we cannot protect our own
culture, on our own soil?

955
02:29:45,441 --> 02:29:47,409
So why've you stopped the pilgrimage?
There are thousands of people here...

956
02:29:47,574 --> 02:29:49,375
will they go back without
the pilgrimage?

957
02:29:49,574 --> 02:29:54,545
Never! It's love and devotion that
have always triumphed... not hatred!

958
02:29:55,241 --> 02:29:58,711
l'd like to say something here.
This pilgrimage ofAmarnath...

959
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:01,709
is neither a pilgrimage for
the Hindus, nor the Muslims

960
02:30:02,574 --> 02:30:04,208
lt's a pilgrimage of India

961
02:30:04,507 --> 02:30:06,675
lt has never stopped.
And it never will

962
02:30:08,841 --> 02:30:10,375
l want a detailed report
on this incident

963
02:30:10,907 --> 02:30:13,209
Kalra, arrange a White Flag
meeting with the Pakistani authorities

964
02:30:46,707 --> 02:30:50,210
But in the army, you need to
keep your wits about you

965
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:54,210
Tell me something. You had
a leave of 3 months, right?

966
02:30:54,774 --> 02:30:57,209
So what are you doing here?
You ought to be on a vacation

967
02:30:57,707 --> 02:31:00,676
Look at the stress on your face.
Are you facing a family problem?

968
02:31:01,241 --> 02:31:02,208
No, sir

969
02:31:02,407 --> 02:31:05,209
Or perhaps you've had a tiff
with your girlfriend?

970
02:31:07,207 --> 02:31:11,711
She lives in my heart, so what tiffs?
l received a message only yesterday sir

971
02:31:16,241 --> 02:31:18,209
She's waiting for me

972
02:31:18,907 --> 02:31:22,210
As soon as this mission is
accomplished. l'll get married

973
02:31:23,274 --> 02:31:26,210
How is one expected
to trust the world...?

974
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:32,711
when one's own tears
betray his feelings?

975
02:31:42,741 --> 02:31:44,709
You're back!

976
02:31:45,474 --> 02:31:48,710
You were sinking an_ay.
And you made sure, l drowned too

977
02:31:49,341 --> 02:31:51,309
One of us ought to have survived

978
02:31:51,474 --> 02:31:53,209
What?

979
02:31:55,741 --> 02:32:00,712
Let me introduce you to a special
friend ofyours. Wait here

980
02:32:19,207 --> 02:32:22,710
Love is successful when
mo hearts finally unite

981
02:32:23,741 --> 02:32:30,714
The problem is, it's difficult
for hearts to unite. Cheers!

982
02:32:30,907 --> 02:32:32,875
No, sir. l must leave.
- Hey Kunal... c'mon!

983
02:32:34,074 --> 02:32:35,708
Drink it up! Go on

984
02:32:41,407 --> 02:32:45,377
This season of rains,
l was subjected to a prank

985
02:32:46,407 --> 02:32:50,711
This season of rains,
l was subjected to a prank

986
02:32:51,741 --> 02:32:56,712
Mine was the house that stood out.
Else, it rained all over the city

987
02:33:00,207 --> 02:33:02,175
You're in love with each other?

988
02:33:11,441 --> 02:33:13,409
So what's wrong with that?

989
02:33:15,241 --> 02:33:17,209
Given the circumstances we
have been through...

990
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:23,712
all this was inevitable.
But what's stopping you?

991
02:33:27,241 --> 02:33:29,042
A wedding?

992
02:33:32,507 --> 02:33:34,475
The vows...?

993
02:33:37,540 --> 02:33:41,211
Or is it...
- What...?

994
02:33:43,241 --> 02:33:45,209
or is it this wedding necklace...?

995
02:33:59,074 --> 02:34:00,842
You are free
from today

996
02:35:01,274 --> 02:35:06,212
lt took your blessed enty
into my life, Kunal...

997
02:35:07,241 --> 02:35:11,712
for Lord Shiva to return
all my happiness to me

998
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:15,043
My husband has returned

999
02:35:17,241 --> 02:35:20,711
May the mo ofyou always be happy.
That's all l want

1000
02:35:22,241 --> 02:35:23,709
Go on

1001
02:35:37,241 --> 02:35:39,710
Wait, please...

1002
02:35:41,974 --> 02:35:43,942
You love me so much?

1003
02:35:44,441 --> 02:35:48,211
You thought l would be happy
with Kunal...

1004
02:35:49,241 --> 02:35:51,710
and sacrificed all yourjoys?

1005
02:35:54,274 --> 02:35:57,210
Because l was afraid
you might be hurt...

1006
02:35:59,441 --> 02:36:01,409
l could never bring myself about
to tell you the truth

1007
02:36:02,441 --> 02:36:04,409
l could never tell you the truth

1008
02:36:11,241 --> 02:36:16,212
Don't punish me so severely for
this little mistake of mine!

1009
02:36:18,974 --> 02:36:25,213
Please don't punish me like this...
- Enough, enough

1010
02:36:31,274 --> 02:36:35,211
Kunal, where on earth were you?
l looked eveywhere

1011
02:36:35,407 --> 02:36:37,709
Hey Sakshi...
- Yes?

1012
02:36:37,907 --> 02:36:41,710
This season of rains,
l was subjected to a prank

1013
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:46,711
Mine was the house that stood out.
Else, it rained all over the city

1014
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:49,709
Kunal, what is the matter?

1015
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:57,715
Sakshi, l have always been a failure.
So you never told me the truth

1016
02:36:59,074 --> 02:37:04,212
You're vey sweet, Sakshi...
- Kunal, your grandfather...

1017
02:37:05,407 --> 02:37:07,709
Grandfather?
- He's been waiting for you

1018
02:37:08,274 --> 02:37:10,242
Waiting for me...?
- Your grandfather, Kunal...

1019
02:37:29,274 --> 02:37:31,709
You know how many terrorists escaped
because ofyou today?

1020
02:37:33,241 --> 02:37:35,710
How many more homes they will destroy,
how many more people they will kill?

1021
02:37:36,507 --> 02:37:38,709
This is all the result of
a lack in my upbringing...

1022
02:37:39,074 --> 02:37:41,042
that l couldn't make you
worthy ofthe armed forces

1023
02:37:42,474 --> 02:37:44,209
lt would be good for you
ifyou tendered a resignation

1024
02:37:46,474 --> 02:37:48,709
You wanted to go away to America,
isn't it? All right

1025
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:51,042
l'll have you sent there

1026
02:37:53,241 --> 02:37:56,711
No, grandpa. That's not
how it is anymore

1027
02:37:58,207 --> 02:37:59,875
Don't you see l've changed?

1028
02:38:00,074 --> 02:38:02,709
l'm not tying to run away
from the army anymore

1029
02:38:04,441 --> 02:38:08,211
Your grandson is now willing to lay
down his life for the county today

1030
02:38:08,407 --> 02:38:12,711
Shut up, Kunal! l've heard enough
ofyour bragging

1031
02:38:13,774 --> 02:38:15,709
You must resign from the
army immediately

1032
02:38:17,207 --> 02:38:19,709
l'm sory, grandpa.
But that is not possible

1033
02:38:22,207 --> 02:38:24,709
That is an order.
- It's impossible

1034
02:38:28,207 --> 02:38:31,710
You're just a security advisor.
You can only give advise

1035
02:38:33,741 --> 02:38:37,711
Only a senior officer can give me
the dismissal orders from the army

1036
02:38:44,874 --> 02:38:48,210
You're right, Kunal.
Absolutely right

1037
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:52,709
The security ofthe pilgrims
is my responsibility

1038
02:38:54,174 --> 02:39:00,046
And l can't leave their lives to a crazy
and irresponsible officer like you

1039
02:39:16,741 --> 02:39:18,709
You're good at lying, aren't you?

1040
02:39:19,807 --> 02:39:22,376
lf someone asks, say the gun
went offwhen you were cleaning it

1041
02:39:24,474 --> 02:39:28,377
But ifyou can speak the truth,
it'll make me feel vey happy

1042
02:39:43,474 --> 02:39:49,046
l'll call for the ambulance...
- No, nothing's happened to me!

1043
02:39:49,274 --> 02:39:51,709
No bullet has struck me!
- You've been hit, Kunal!

1044
02:39:52,274 --> 02:39:53,708
Why don't you understand...?

1045
02:39:55,274 --> 02:39:59,711
lt has to do with my grandpa!
It has to do with his respect!

1046
02:40:00,741 --> 02:40:02,709
l will not let a slur be
cast on his reputation!

1047
02:40:03,207 --> 02:40:06,043
Do you get that...?
- But you need to be treated, don't you ?

1048
02:40:06,407 --> 02:40:09,710
Take me to your house.
Attend to my wound there

1049
02:40:10,974 --> 02:40:12,709
All right, okay

1050
02:40:13,474 --> 02:40:19,179
When you can understand me...
why can't my grandpa?

1051
02:40:20,407 --> 02:40:22,375
Why can't he...?

1052
02:40:50,157 --> 02:40:54,995
Forgive me, my son. l haven't
been able to fulfill your wish

1053
02:41:12,057 --> 02:41:14,459
A White Flag meeting with the Pakistani
authorities has been fixed, sir

1054
02:42:00,957 --> 02:42:04,460
Yes, Mr Singh? What brings you
to our doorstep today?

1055
02:42:05,957 --> 02:42:07,925
For the sake humanity and peace,
notjust once...

1056
02:42:08,091 --> 02:42:10,059
we can go to anyone's doorstep
a dozen times

1057
02:42:11,491 --> 02:42:14,861
As you know, Mr Sikander...

1058
02:42:15,491 --> 02:42:18,861
the pilgrimage to Amarnath is
considered to be vey sacred in India

1059
02:42:19,491 --> 02:42:24,462
Please don't drag our religious places
into the tension prevailing bemeen us

1060
02:42:26,491 --> 02:42:28,459
l agree with you, Mr Singh

1061
02:42:29,991 --> 02:42:35,857
We allow Sikhs from all over the world
to visit the Nanakana temple...

1062
02:42:35,957 --> 02:42:37,591
and nobody has any problems

1063
02:42:39,491 --> 02:42:43,862
Listen to the Kashmiris. Get them to
to issue visas to Indian pilgrims...

1064
02:42:44,491 --> 02:42:46,459
and believe me...

1065
02:42:47,491 --> 02:42:49,359
you will find peace eveywhere

1066
02:42:51,491 --> 02:42:56,462
You don't have enough water to put
out the fires in your own house...

1067
02:42:56,790 --> 02:42:58,759
and you're talking of
a largesse to others?

1068
02:42:59,491 --> 02:43:05,864
lt's vey surprising. Despite seeing
the bloodshed eveywhere...

1069
02:43:07,491 --> 02:43:10,260
your county has no consideration
for human feelings

1070
02:43:10,890 --> 02:43:13,460
lt's the same consideration
that brings me here today

1071
02:43:13,890 --> 02:43:16,093
Else, l'm hardly fond
of meeting you

1072
02:43:19,224 --> 02:43:20,792
We're here to hand over
these dead bodies to you

1073
02:43:22,657 --> 02:43:24,625
They're the bodies ofthe terrorists...

1074
02:43:25,957 --> 02:43:28,459
who're linked to some terrorist
organisation in Pakistan or the other

1075
02:43:32,857 --> 02:43:35,459
While they were alive, they didn't
have a life in their motherland

1076
02:43:37,491 --> 02:43:40,460
But perhaps in death, they will find
a few yards for burial

1077
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:43,759
Colonel...
- Sir!

1078
02:43:50,824 --> 02:43:53,793
This is Rasool.
A resident of Peshawar

1079
02:43:57,991 --> 02:43:59,792
This is Afzal from Multan

1080
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:07,126
Baseless allegations, Colonel

1081
02:44:09,991 --> 02:44:13,994
lt's all a fabrication. We have
nothing to do with the dead

1082
02:44:14,557 --> 02:44:16,458
All right

1083
02:44:17,657 --> 02:44:19,458
But you must certainly be
knowing this man...

1084
02:44:21,991 --> 02:44:22,958
Mushtaq

1085
02:44:24,824 --> 02:44:26,926
Your son.
Your own flesh and blood

1086
02:44:49,824 --> 02:44:50,791
Mushtaq!

1087
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:08,460
The demon ofterrorism
spares no one, Mr Ashfaq

1088
02:45:11,257 --> 02:45:15,461
Those who create the demon
are swallowed by it

1089
02:45:32,491 --> 02:45:34,459
This is exactly why l gave you
the suggestion, Mr Sikander

1090
02:45:37,991 --> 02:45:39,959
There's still time

1091
02:45:40,491 --> 02:45:44,461
lndia and Pakistan must get together
to wipe out terrorism. Else...

1092
02:45:45,257 --> 02:45:47,792
forget about the nation's progress,
not even your nation will exist

1093
02:45:54,991 --> 02:46:00,463
l think it's time we recognised
the pulse ofthe people

1094
02:46:01,957 --> 02:46:03,458
We must heed their voice

1095
02:46:04,057 --> 02:46:09,462
And what the nation wants today is
peace, friendship and progress

1096
02:46:09,957 --> 02:46:12,459
He's right. And that's exactly what
the international community wants too

1097
02:46:12,691 --> 02:46:14,659
Also what the Pakistani
administration wants

1098
02:46:15,024 --> 02:46:18,460
lt's clear. Pakistan is not
on the side ofthe terrorists

1099
02:46:19,157 --> 02:46:23,961
lt wants to fight terrorism alongside
India and wants to defeat it.

1100
02:46:25,057 --> 02:46:29,961
Mr Sikander, ifthere is any trouble
in the Amarnath pilgrimage this time...

1101
02:46:30,991 --> 02:46:33,460
you will be held responsible for it.
- You are amazing!

1102
02:46:36,224 --> 02:46:37,858
How quickly you change colours!

1103
02:46:38,157 --> 02:46:39,791
When have we done anything
of our own volition?

1104
02:46:40,224 --> 02:46:42,960
We have always taken the path the
administration has ordered us to

1105
02:46:44,157 --> 02:46:48,461
Else, who wants all this bloodshed?
l'm a peace-loving man

1106
02:46:49,057 --> 02:46:51,459
l too want a new chapter
of peace to begin

1107
02:46:53,157 --> 02:46:57,127
ln fact, l have a suggestion which
l hope you gentlemen will implement

1108
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:05,461
Pakistan ought to send a peace delegation
of its own to the Amarnath pilgrimage

1109
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:10,859
lt will set an example
for the rest ofthe world

1110
02:47:16,957 --> 02:47:21,461
Until now, this pilgrimage was held
under the shadow ofterrorists' gun

1111
02:47:21,691 --> 02:47:24,460
People undertook the pilgrimage
at the risk oftheir lives

1112
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:27,793
For the first time, however,
a delegation of Pakistan...

1113
02:47:27,957 --> 02:47:29,458
is taking part in the pilgrimage

1114
02:47:29,657 --> 02:47:32,960
With the participation of a delegation,
what terrorist scare...?

1115
02:47:39,591 --> 02:47:43,795
Welcome, Mr Sikander. We welcome
you with all our hearts

1116
02:47:46,724 --> 02:47:49,460
Use your Singapore-based SIM card
to call me on my London number

1117
02:47:49,624 --> 02:47:51,459
Allah will take care

1118
02:47:53,857 --> 02:47:57,460
We liked your suggestion so much that
all the militants in Pakistan...

1119
02:47:58,024 --> 02:48:03,129
stand at your doorstep in friendship.
- One who learns from past mistakes...

1120
02:48:03,491 --> 02:48:05,793
and mends his ways is a
sensible man, Mr Sikander

1121
02:48:06,024 --> 02:48:08,793
And thus, l wished to talk
to you in privacy

1122
02:48:10,157 --> 02:48:14,461
lt's true that l'm not here to
participate in the holy pilgrimage

1123
02:48:16,691 --> 02:48:19,960
ln fact, l'm here to shatter the
peace that is about to be established...

1124
02:48:21,957 --> 02:48:23,925
bemeen the mo countries

1125
02:48:28,024 --> 02:48:32,194
Look at us!
Even our beard has grayed

1126
02:48:33,757 --> 02:48:35,725
How long will you keep fighting?

1127
02:48:38,491 --> 02:48:40,459
For all the service you rendered
to your nation...

1128
02:48:42,824 --> 02:48:44,792
you could have earned millions
in the bargain

1129
02:48:46,757 --> 02:48:50,460
ln fact, you still can.
Just agree...

1130
02:48:51,957 --> 02:48:54,459
and a million dollars will be
transferred to your bank account

1131
02:48:57,191 --> 02:48:59,459
Mr Sikander, perhaps you don't
realise what you're saying

1132
02:49:01,024 --> 02:49:04,460
l don't understand.
- Come with me.

1133
02:49:06,290 --> 02:49:09,460
Let me explain, show you and
also make you hear evemhing

1134
02:49:11,824 --> 02:49:13,458
Look at this...

1135
02:49:29,491 --> 02:49:31,459
Take it easy, Mr Singh.
We aren't finished yet

1136
02:49:31,824 --> 02:49:34,960
lfyou dare do anything, l'll...
- What are you going to do?

1137
02:49:35,624 --> 02:49:37,459
Do you have any evidence against me?

1138
02:49:42,057 --> 02:49:45,460
You will arrest me? Lock me up
in jail or kill me...?

1139
02:49:47,224 --> 02:49:49,793
Please go ahead.
That's what we want too

1140
02:49:51,157 --> 02:49:54,460
But remember, l'm the peace ambassador
of Pakistan right now

1141
02:49:55,857 --> 02:49:57,825
lf l as much as suffer
a scratch...

1142
02:49:58,790 --> 02:50:00,792
what reply will you give to your
nemound friends in Pakistan?

1143
02:50:03,591 --> 02:50:10,130
lt's my turn today. l'll be the one
who does what needs to be done now

1144
02:50:12,790 --> 02:50:15,960
A bleating goat is
hung and quartered!

1145
02:50:26,824 --> 02:50:29,459
Colonel Rajiv Singh
at your service, sir

1146
02:50:38,191 --> 02:50:40,960
lf l can be a good host to you...

1147
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:47,462
l can't get into your house and
beat the daylights out ofyou

1148
02:50:50,024 --> 02:50:52,459
What the hell are you doing?
First you come to India...

1149
02:50:53,491 --> 02:50:56,460
and take such a huge risk by
revealing the truth to Amarjit!

1150
02:50:56,691 --> 02:50:59,960
You have our arms and explosives seized
and tell us not to take any risks?

1151
02:51:01,024 --> 02:51:05,261
Had we taken this step while we were in
Pakistan, we'd have been killed for it

1152
02:51:05,824 --> 02:51:09,460
And ifwe did nothing, the masters
of our county would've slain us

1153
02:51:09,991 --> 02:51:14,128
lt's not a small amount, Mr Maqbool.
It has to do with millions of dollars

1154
02:51:15,157 --> 02:51:18,126
As for telling Amarjit,
l did that only because...

1155
02:51:18,491 --> 02:51:21,460
l wanted him to concentrate on me.
You can get on with your arrangements

1156
02:51:22,624 --> 02:51:24,926
Hide explosives to blow up
the Amarnath cave...

1157
02:51:25,091 --> 02:51:29,462
at the place where our stay
has been arranged

1158
02:51:30,290 --> 02:51:32,526
We have already driven out
the Hindus from Kashmir

1159
02:51:33,557 --> 02:51:37,127
We must now get rid oftheir religion
and their culture

1160
02:51:37,757 --> 02:51:40,459
God willing!
- Allah - the Almighty!

1161
02:55:46,757 --> 02:55:49,459
There's a trident under the tree
next to your tent

1162
02:55:49,924 --> 02:55:51,458
That's where the RDX is

1163
02:56:36,757 --> 02:56:38,725
We'll have the cave
blown to smithereens!

1164
02:56:39,824 --> 02:56:41,458
You know where we're meeting?
- Sure

1165
02:56:41,657 --> 02:56:43,625
l'll let you know as soon as
l hear from Abu Hamza

1166
02:56:44,824 --> 02:56:47,793
Arrange for the ambulance at once!
Check eveybody!

1167
02:56:48,824 --> 02:56:50,792
God protect you

1168
02:56:51,024 --> 02:56:55,128
ls this how you discharge your duty?
Look at all this bloodshed!

1169
02:56:55,824 --> 02:56:57,792
Had our guest delegation
suffered any harm...

1170
02:56:58,024 --> 02:57:00,459
we couldn't have faced anyone!

1171
02:57:00,824 --> 02:57:02,959
Look at you! You can
hang your face in shame!

1172
02:57:03,491 --> 02:57:05,960
lt's l who has to answer questions
on behalf ofthe Kashmiri government!

1173
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:08,859
l'll have to make all
the arrangements now

1174
02:57:09,024 --> 02:57:12,927
l'm going to talk to the government
about your failures! Allah!

1175
02:58:03,557 --> 02:58:06,459
l found mo 5-rupee coins
and a stick in the flowers

1176
02:58:06,757 --> 02:58:12,963
lt could be 551 , 155 or even 515.
Or perhaps 5 plus 5 and one

1177
02:58:13,557 --> 02:58:15,792
lt's surely a message that is
being passed on to Sikander

1178
02:58:15,991 --> 02:58:20,462
lt could be the number of a tent, a mule
or even a horse. We have only tonight

1179
02:58:20,691 --> 02:58:22,659
Yes, speak...
- The RDX...

1180
02:58:23,191 --> 02:58:25,960
On horseback...
- Breathe, Sirohi! Breathe!

1181
02:58:30,657 --> 02:58:33,459
They plan to blow up the cave
with RDX on a horseback

1182
02:58:33,824 --> 02:58:36,459
We must find this particular horse
from among thousands ofthem

1183
02:58:37,157 --> 02:58:40,960
Line of Communication has broken down.
We can't convey this message either

1184
02:59:33,457 --> 02:59:36,259
We thought we'd extend exemplay
hospitality to you

1185
02:59:37,791 --> 02:59:40,960
But there you are. Your folks have
arrived to whip your hide off

1186
02:59:44,324 --> 02:59:45,591
C'mon

1187
02:59:57,791 --> 02:59:59,759
Hey kid...
- Yes, sir?

1188
03:00:00,957 --> 03:00:03,259
What's your name?
- Rasool

1189
03:00:03,657 --> 03:00:05,625
Can you ride this horse, Rasool?
- Of course, sir

1190
03:00:07,457 --> 03:00:11,427
You see that cave there?
- Yes, sir

1191
03:00:11,991 --> 03:00:15,260
ln how much time can you take it there?
- 10 minutes, sir

1192
03:00:15,957 --> 03:00:18,259
lfyou take it there in 5 minutes,
you get to keep the horse

1193
03:00:18,624 --> 03:00:21,727
Really?
- Yes. You also get 500 rupees

1194
03:00:22,791 --> 03:00:25,260
lt'll be there in four minutes, sir!
- Bravo! Go ahead

1195
03:00:42,690 --> 03:00:44,659
The government has sent
instructions for you

1196
03:00:46,424 --> 03:00:48,392
The Prime Minister wishes
to go abroad

1197
03:00:48,957 --> 03:00:50,725
He wants you to accompany him

1198
03:00:58,291 --> 03:01:01,927
That's wonderFul, Mr Singh.
l was impressed by you an_ay

1199
03:01:03,757 --> 03:01:05,725
You've now made me go crazy about you

1200
03:01:07,891 --> 03:01:11,394
l promise you, once l have
IeR, you will be crazy about me too

1201
03:01:14,090 --> 03:01:15,592
God protect you

1202
03:01:19,791 --> 03:01:23,261
Stop Sikander Khan from leaving, sir!
He knows what's going to happen!

1203
03:01:23,624 --> 03:01:27,260
Don't let him leave, please!
- Mule numbers? The pilgrims?

1204
03:01:27,457 --> 03:01:29,725
Have you checked the horses' numbers?
- l've checked evemhing, sir

1205
03:01:29,891 --> 03:01:32,760
Horse number 155 is right now in
Pahalgam, awaiting the pilgrims

1206
03:01:32,991 --> 03:01:35,393
Horse number 551 is right now
at the Trident peak

1207
03:01:35,791 --> 03:01:41,263
Horse 515,...
- Where did you say horse 155 is?

1208
03:01:41,457 --> 03:01:43,759
lt's in Pahalgam, awaiting pilgrims.
- And what's that horse doing here?

1209
03:01:46,957 --> 03:01:48,925
Hey kid... stop that horse!
Stop there!

1210
03:02:03,857 --> 03:02:07,059
Can't you see...?
- Abu Hamza?

1211
03:02:08,291 --> 03:02:09,759
Stop him!

1212
03:02:11,891 --> 03:02:14,760
The one in the red shirt is
a terrorist... stop him!

1213
03:02:29,791 --> 03:02:31,759
Stop that horse! Stop there!

1214
03:05:10,824 --> 03:05:14,260
Kunal! Come to me, son...

1215
03:05:24,291 --> 03:05:26,259
C'mon! Climb up here!

1216
03:06:03,991 --> 03:06:05,258
C'mon!

1217
03:06:07,791 --> 03:06:09,759
C'mon... climb up!

1218
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:25,262
My grandson...
l've lost my grandson

1219
03:09:35,791 --> 03:09:36,758
Kunal!

1220
03:09:45,757 --> 03:09:47,258
Grandpa...

1221
03:09:50,090 --> 03:09:53,260
Are you all right, son?
l almost died of shock

1222
03:09:54,090 --> 03:09:56,760
Your grandson, grandpa.
What could happen to me?

1223
03:09:58,457 --> 03:10:01,259
As they say, no incident
takes place for years...

1224
03:10:01,624 --> 03:10:03,592
and when they do, they're
more than you can handle

1225
03:10:03,824 --> 03:10:07,260
When your grip was released,
l grabbed at a boulder

1226
03:10:08,291 --> 03:10:09,692
And the boulder started shaking!

1227
03:10:09,857 --> 03:10:12,259
The boulder was shaking and there
was a fire down there...

1228
03:10:13,791 --> 03:10:16,593
l lost my grip on the boulder,
and lunged at a tree

1229
03:10:17,024 --> 03:10:21,261
And then l thought,
l thought...

1230
03:10:26,024 --> 03:10:27,992
You will never change, my son

1231
03:10:29,824 --> 03:10:31,258
C'mon

1232
03:10:45,291 --> 03:10:47,760
Doctor, take care
of your patient

1233
03:11:05,757 --> 03:11:09,760
l regret, Mr Akhtar, that in this
quest for peace and friendship...

1234
03:11:10,791 --> 03:11:13,260
Mr Ashfaq Khan has been injured.
- No, Mr Singh

1235
03:11:13,824 --> 03:11:17,594
These injuries mean nothing when
compared to our steps towards peace

1236
03:11:18,057 --> 03:11:20,259
You're right, Mr Ashfaq

1237
03:11:20,624 --> 03:11:23,927
Fights will only leave us shattered

1238
03:11:24,524 --> 03:11:28,761
Whereas, we're a reflection ofyou.
And you're a reflection of us
