1
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,568
"The moon's the same."

2
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,375
"But the night's different."

3
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,741
"The same monsoon."

4
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:09,541
"But the rain seems different."

5
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,678
"The flowers are same."

6
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:15,717
"The fragrance is different."

7
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:22,757
"My, Lord. What is going on?"

8
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,591
"Is this the magic of love?"

9
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:35,471
"Is this the magic of love?"

10
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:41,580
"Is this the magic of love?"

11
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:47,587
"Is this the magic of love?"

12
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:53,490
"Is this the magic of love?"

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,528
"Is this the magic of love?"

14
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,395
"The moon's the same."

15
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,370
"But the night's different."

16
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,573
"The same monsoon."

17
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:12,701
"But the rain seems different."

18
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,942
Hi, Sandy.

19
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:49,740
Really.

20
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,613
Versace's show is day after tomorrow.

21
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:55,476
And what about the
meeting with Premraj.

22
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,618
That has been fixed too.

23
00:02:58,725 --> 00:02:59,350
That's great, Sandy.

24
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,822
Okay. Okay. Okay.

25
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,363
Okay, sms me the PNR number...

26
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:06,557
...and I will get the ticket.

27
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:07,691
You don't worry.

28
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,995
Okay, bye-bye. Take care.

29
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,759
You are the best, Sandy. Bye.

30
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,302
Priya.

31
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,734
Sandy has fixed a show in Mumbai.

32
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:15,307
With Versace.

33
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:19,574
And I also have an
audition fixed in Premraj studio.

34
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:22,648
They want to cast me
in their next film.

35
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,043
Hello, Reena.

36
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:26,676
I am not discouraging you.

37
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,754
But how much do you know Sandy?

38
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,891
We met him only last
week in the fashion show.

39
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:41,597
Priya, your problem is
that you are slightly dumb.

40
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,566
Now you don't expect a coordinator...

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,763
...from Chandigarh to get me a
shoot in Mumbai, sweetheart.

42
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:48,540
This is how you get opportunities.

43
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,768
Look, this is about my career.

44
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,377
I will have to go.

45
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:55,505
And Versace is paying
all the expenses, isn't it?

46
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,740
And such
opportunities don't come often.

47
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,045
Understand?

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,318
Oh my, God!

49
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,652
I am looking so stout.

50
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,289
I have a shoot two days later.

51
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:05,483
I have to go to the gym.

52
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,651
Okay, I have to go.

53
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,956
I will see you later, okay.
- Bye, see you. Take care.

54
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:12,959
Oh my, God!

55
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,394
Hi, mama. Hi, daddy.
- She's here.

56
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,371
Come.
- Take a seat.

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,302
Dear, I am very happy today.

58
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,803
Rajeev's dad has
fixed the marriage date.

59
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,611
And he wants you two to get married...

60
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,980
...within two weeks in Pune.

61
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,981
And Rajeev's mother was saying...

62
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,649
...that we won't find such a
auspicious date for a year.

63
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,851
And Rajeev has to return to London.

64
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,793
The poor boy only got two
weeks leave from his job.

65
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,823
Mom, I don't want to get married.

66
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,531
I want to make a career.

67
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,733
I want to become a successful actress.

68
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,306
I want to fulfil my dreams, mother.

69
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,803
And you want me to get
married and have children.

70
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,038
Enough!

71
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,312
This won't do.

72
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,013
Two years of working is enough.

73
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,287
Rajeev is my best friend's son.

74
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,552
He is a nice boy.

75
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,284
He is working at a
high position in London.

76
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,293
He will keep you happy.

77
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,824
Did you see?

78
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,299
I will explain to her.

79
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,630
Reena.

80
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,864
Reena. Listen, dear.

81
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,869
Dear.

82
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,476
Dear. Reena.

83
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,943
Mother, just recently
I am being offered...

84
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,688
I have to achieve
many things in my life.

85
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,321
And these days all the
girls are career-minded.

86
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:52,359
And anyway, how much
do I know that Rajeev.

87
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,425
Listen, dear.

88
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,726
He's an old friend of ours.

89
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,295
And I have been watching
Rajeev for so many years.

90
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,302
He is a very nice boy, dear.

91
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,844
Reena, since your childhood...

92
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,306
...I have been hearing
that you want to be a star.

93
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:12,576
Look, dear.

94
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,716
You were stubborn
about becoming a model...

95
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,511
...and we agreed.

96
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:20,283
But, dear, think about the future.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,492
Okay, mama.

98
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,296
But right now I have
to go out for two days...

99
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,736
...for an important outdoor shoot.

100
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,467
It's a big foreign company's shoot.

101
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,438
They will pay me handsomely as well.

102
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,441
And I want to do this.

103
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,905
Where is the shoot?

104
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,576
Daddy, it's in Delhi.

105
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,515
The company is paying for
the travelling and hotel.

106
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,953
There is a big crew
arriving from abroad.

107
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:54,016
And is your friend
Priya going as well?

108
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:55,990
No, she cannot come along.

109
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:57,760
She is busy here.

110
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,596
You cannot go for this shoot.

111
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,498
We have to make arrangements
for the marriage in two weeks.

112
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,301
Stop all this.

113
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:10,775
But, daddy, I have
already accepted it.

114
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,345
I cannot cancel it now.

115
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,477
I will come back in two days.

116
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,809
Its a life-time opportunity, father.

117
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,917
Mother, please
explain to father. Please.

118
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,687
This will be my last shoot. I promise.

119
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,986
Please, mother. Please.

120
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,619
Please. Let me go.

121
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,792
Okay, okay, fine.

122
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,262
I will try to explain to him.

123
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,727
Okay, don't you worry.

124
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,034
Yes.

125
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:03,524
Thank you.

126
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:14,865
Wow.

127
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,001
Ganeshji.

128
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:19,403
I want to buy this.

129
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,879
I have to. Come on.
- Come. Come inside.

130
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,381
Reena, you are always
buying a Ganeshji idol.

131
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,958
Why?
- Look, I have promised Ganeshji...

132
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,852
...that I will keep 101
Ganeshji's in my cupboard.

133
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,727
So I have to fulfill
my promise to him.

134
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,922
And what is the count now?

135
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,633
Counting this... 93.

136
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:46,497
I need to buy eight more.

137
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,507
I will buy those from Mumbai.

138
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,609
Okay, what will happen...

139
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:52,770
...will you complete 101 Ganeshji's.

140
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,947
I have complete faith on my Ganeshji.

141
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,409
And He looks after me as well.

142
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,884
Who knows as soon as
I fulfil my promise...

143
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,410
...he might fulfill my dream.

144
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,388
And make me a big star.

145
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,252
Keep on dreaming.

146
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:09,295
It is very important
for you to have dreams.

147
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:10,691
Oh, shut up, Priya.

148
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:12,492
Look, I have told mother and father...

149
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,328
...that I am going to
Delhi for the shoot.

150
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:15,828
But why lie?

151
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,632
If they find out that
I am going to Mumbai...

152
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,000
...then they will never say yes.

153
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:21,905
Delhi is a lot closer.

154
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,277
And then Mumbai is such
a big and expensive city.

155
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,716
Staying, eating. How will
you manage the expenses?

156
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,287
Look, don't be worried.

157
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,420
When the Lord decides your fate...

158
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,752
...then He already has
something in his mind.

159
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,850
Versace has already given a ticket.

160
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:44,419
They are making
arrangements for hotel and food.

161
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,292
And on top of that they
have agreed to pay me...

162
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,928
...100,000 rupees for one day shoot.

163
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,299
With that money I
will have a folio shot...

164
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,402
...from Babbu Bitlani.

165
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:54,599
You know he is best in town.

166
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:57,541
All the big stars get
their portfolio done by him.

167
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,434
I am all set.

168
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:00,773
Okay.

169
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,040
Lets leave quickly.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,749
I have to catch the morning flight.

171
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,707
Please understand that
he's a very big producer.

172
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:36,940
No, you don't have a choice.

173
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,587
I finally came to Mumbai.

174
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:47,018
I will call you back.
- Hi.

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,357
Hi, Reena.

176
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,988
How was your flight?
- It was nice.

177
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,492
So you are here. Good.

178
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,802
Sandy, what's wrong?

179
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,335
Is there a problem?

180
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,507
Bad news, Reena.

181
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,606
Versace's shoot has been cancelled.

182
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,779
But why, Sandy?
- Have a seat Reena.

183
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,713
I will explain, I will explain.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

184
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,625
Actually their cameraman
was coming from Paris.

185
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,296
Now he isn't coming.

186
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:27,728
But they are going to
reschedule the shoot...

187
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:28,892
...in two weeks time.

188
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,526
These things happen.

189
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,696
But, Sandy, everything
was fine until last night.

190
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:35,296
Why didn't you tell me?

191
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,670
Yes, I am sorry.

192
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,405
Actually, I found out this morning.

193
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,377
And until then you had
already boarded the flight.

194
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:48,078
But, Sandy, I will get
my fees, won't I? - Fees?

195
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,479
Reena, come on be realistic.

196
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,725
How can you get your
fees without working?

197
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:58,562
And then... you have
lost your hotel booking...

198
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,656
...and also your return ticket.

199
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,627
Yes, on your request
I paid Babbu Bitlani...

200
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,797
...40,000 rupees with
great difficulty...

201
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,964
...and confirmed your
photo shoot tomorrow.

202
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,569
He's a busy man. You know that, right.

203
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,474
At least I can get one thing done.

204
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,316
And what about the
meeting with Premraj?

205
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,812
Premraj is not in town, Reena.

206
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,620
But soon your meeting
will be confirmed with him.

207
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:29,757
Sandy. But you told me
that the meeting is confirmed.

208
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,990
It was confirmed,
Reena. It was confirmed.

209
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,960
Yesterday evening his
secretary calls me...

210
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:42,338
If the meeting with such a
big producer gets postponed...

211
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,602
...then that's fine, Reena.

212
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:44,768
Its nothing to worry about.

213
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:48,313
And also first he wants
to see your portfolio.

214
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:50,778
So get your portfolio shot first.

215
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:52,578
I will show that to him.

216
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:55,750
Now that you are in Mumbai,
stay here comfortably.

217
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,517
Auditions and meetings
will be a daily routine now.

218
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,389
Excuse me.

219
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,817
Hello. Hey, Rocky.

220
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,691
Just a minute.

221
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,825
No. 20 percent.

222
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,501
No, no, no 10 percent, no 15 percent.

223
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,696
Flat 20 percent.

224
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:14,940
No, no, if they want to work.

225
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:18,766
Yes, tell them. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

226
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,948
What? What did you say
the shooting dates were?

227
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,779
26, 27, 28.

228
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,286
So you tell me. Alright.

229
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:40,455
Sandy, I don't have
money to stay in Mumbai.

230
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,028
What? You don't have money.

231
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:44,934
Meaning you came empty-handed.

232
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:46,765
What do you mean by that?

233
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,407
You said that Versace
will pay all the expenses.

234
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:50,941
The shoot's been cancelled, Reena...

235
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,874
...now you are not
their responsibility.

236
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,339
Fine, Sandy. Then you
make some arrangements.

237
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,909
After all you called me here.

238
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,317
Do I look like a bank to you?

239
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,519
With great difficult I
managed to keep aside 40,000...

240
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:04,282
...for your portfolio, Reena.

241
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,550
Thinking that you will
return it to me when you arrive.

242
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,283
I am in debt myself.

243
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:10,689
I cannot loan you.

244
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,769
Sandy, you have been after
me for the past one week...

245
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,329
...that "Come to Mumbai,
I will get you good assignments".

246
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:22,305
And now you are treating me like this.

247
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,039
Reena, I didn't
cancel the shoot, okay.

248
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:28,337
Its just your bad luck,
or maybe bad timing.

249
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,048
These things happen in Mumbai.

250
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,908
Nothing happens here in a day or two.

251
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,754
Sandy, I want to get
a portfolio done...

252
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,278
...by Babbu Bitlani tomorrow.

253
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,682
Please do something. Please.

254
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:49,894
Maybe...

255
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,330
He wants a new heroine for his film.

256
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,500
The heroine which they had selected...

257
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,407
...came down with chicken
pox at the last minute.

258
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,246
I can try to fix
your meeting with them.

259
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:07,544
If they like you then they
might give you an advance...

260
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,450
...and your problem can be solved.

261
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,280
That's great, Sandy.

262
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,960
Shall I call him?
- Call him.

263
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,290
Do it quickly.

264
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,562
Mr. Pathak.

265
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:26,730
Sir, Sandy here.

266
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,908
You were saying that you
are looking for a fresh face.

267
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:31,968
Would you like to meet her?

268
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,337
Surely. Thank you so much, Mr. Pathak.

269
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:36,676
So kind of you.

270
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,341
Sir, her name is Reena.

271
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,611
She will be there in
half an hour, sir.

272
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,050
Okay. Thank you, so much.

273
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,951
Amazing, Reena, awesome luck you have.

274
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,551
There is one problem
that I cannot come with you.

275
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,727
Okay. Leave your luggage here.

276
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,593
Go to Tulip Star Hotel.
Room number 214.

277
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,757
Hotel room.

278
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,596
Sandy, doesn't he have an office.

279
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,965
Sweetheart, that is his office. Okay.

280
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,302
Best of luck and call
me after the meeting.

281
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,512
Come in, come in.

282
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:16,612
Come in, I am Pathak.
- Hello, sir.

283
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,958
Hello. Are you Reena Mehta?
- Yes.

284
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,358
Come in. Come in.

285
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,728
This is Mr. Sharma.
- Hello.

286
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,596
The director of our film.
- Hello.

287
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:33,733
Why are you standing? Take a seat.

288
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,337
Would you like something?
- No thanks, sir.

289
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,511
Sandy told me about your film.

290
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,884
Sandy was right.

291
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,681
We already had the
inauguration yesterday.

292
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,722
And we had to start shooting today.

293
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,789
But suddenly our heroine
came down with chicken-pox.

294
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,622
Now we cannot delay the film,
isn't it? - Yes.

295
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:02,834
And anyway, we have Saif's dates.
- Saif Ali?

296
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:03,993
Yes.

297
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,398
And we have thought of...

298
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:11,273
...casting a new girl
opposite Saif Ali. - Yes, sir.

299
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,444
Now you do understand that...

300
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,743
...any girl that's
cast opposite Saif Ali...

301
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,785
...will become a star overnight.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,250
Reena, have you done anything before?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:26,951
I have done modelling in Chandigarh.
- Even I...

304
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,524
...really enjoy working with models.

305
00:17:30,663 --> 00:17:34,690
Because they are
very open and flexible.

306
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,358
Reena, are you flexible as well?

307
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,272
Flexible?

308
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:45,707
Sir, will you tell me
about your film's story.

309
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:48,609
Reena, this is not
the time for the story.

310
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,645
Tomorrow you have to shoot with Saif.

311
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,917
And we got Saif's date
with great difficulty.

312
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:03,252
Here, 25,000 cash. Advance.

313
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:07,928
So, are you happy
with the package deal?

314
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,268
Package deal?
- Look, baby.

315
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,599
You don't get
opportunities like this often.

316
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,363
This isn't Chandigarh.

317
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,939
This is Mumbai.

318
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,904
You have to be flexible in Mumbai.

319
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:21,904
In this industry.

320
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:25,511
You have to compromise in
order to gain something.

321
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:28,784
I... I... I, sir...

322
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,286
Actually... actually I got to go.

323
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,290
Reena, just a minute.

324
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:55,312
I am tired of
dealing with those people.

325
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,417
How many times will I
repeat the same thing again?

326
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,015
No, I want my 20 percent.

327
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,981
Otherwise don't call me next time.

328
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,482
I won't work.

329
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:04,816
Okay, bye.

330
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,995
Hi, Reena. Sorry, I am late.

331
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:14,630
One black coffee please.

332
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,595
How was the meeting?

333
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,499
You sent me to such cheap people.

334
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,965
They don't want a heroine...

335
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,737
I feel ashamed even to say it.

336
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,241
Package deal. Scoundrels.

337
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,269
You are over-reacting.

338
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,942
You are new to Mumbai city.

339
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:35,353
Girls implore for the
opportunity that you got.

340
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,483
And to become a heroine, excuse me...

341
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,717
...you have to do all this.

342
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,692
It's not a big deal.
- Its a big deal for me.

343
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,290
I am here to become an actress...

344
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,923
...not to do these things. Understand.

345
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,698
Fine, Ms. Sati Savitri.

346
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:55,970
...to send 40,000
rupees and a return ticket.

347
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,003
Sandy, why don't you understand?

348
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,273
I cannot call home.

349
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:03,748
Why don't you lend me some money?

350
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,978
I am not doing charity here, Reena.

351
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:10,384
And if I had known
you are flat-broke...

352
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,889
...I wouldn't have paid 40,000
advance for your photo-shoot...

353
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,448
...from my pocket.

354
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,524
Yes, I am busy. I will call you back.

355
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,966
I thought you are a nice man.

356
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,364
I trusted you, Sandy.

357
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,370
Sandy, you have to help me.

358
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,675
I will do any kind
of job or something.

359
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,479
What job? Which job, Reena?

360
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,379
And even if you do find a
job when will you find one?

361
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,478
And then salary,
when will you get that?

362
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:45,954
Come on, Reena.
Think sensibly, please.

363
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,690
Sandy, I can't think now.

364
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:49,921
You have to think.

365
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:57,961
Okay.

366
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,738
I have a friend who
has come from America.

367
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,606
Stay with him tonight.

368
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,917
I will collect 50,000 rupees from him.

369
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,781
And book you a return ticket as well.
- Okay.

370
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:19,382
Sandy, I am not going to
do all this, understand.

371
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,858
Reena, he's a cool guy, okay.

372
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,657
All you have to do is share
the room with him, that's it.

373
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:29,289
Sandy, how can I stay with a stranger?

374
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,530
Reena, he is a big shot, okay.

375
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:34,400
He only likes big shot girls, okay.

376
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:36,804
Big shot or not big shot, Sandy...

377
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,338
...I am not going to do all this.

378
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,838
We are in a restaurant.

379
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,642
Do you have a choice?
Do you have a choice?

380
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,842
No, you don't have a choice.

381
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:46,644
Think, Reena.

382
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,852
If you get in his good books...

383
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,321
...then he might
produce a film for you.

384
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,928
And, Reena, I want my
40,000 rupees back. Please.

385
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,266
Sandy, can't you ask
someone to lend me the money...

386
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,631
Enough, enough, enough.

387
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:04,862
What is all this?

388
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:05,301
Am I your father?

389
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:07,837
I cannot arrange
money from anywhere else.

390
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,304
Okay, Reena, I have other meetings...

391
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,369
...where I can make some money.

392
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:14,742
So please allow me, I have to go.

393
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,539
But what will I do here?

394
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:17,977
Where will I go, Sandy?

395
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,045
I don't know, Reena.

396
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,520
I did all that I could, okay.

397
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,881
I am not God.

398
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:25,048
So good luck to you, Reena.

399
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:27,550
See you... see you soon. Bye, bye.

400
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,495
Sandy. Sandy.

401
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:49,496
Good morning, Mr. Gupta.

402
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,672
Hope you had a
comfortable flight, sir.

403
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:53,472
We have started our descend...

404
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,376
...and we are 30 minutes
ahead of our schedule.

405
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:58,575
We expect to touch down in
Mumbai in about 20 minutes.

406
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,317
See you on the ground, sir.

407
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,303
Welcome, Akash.
- Hi.

408
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,466
Let's go.

409
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,838
It's hot here.

410
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,316
Good morning. Good morning.

411
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,382
Good morning, Aarti.

412
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:35,316
You have my documents.
- Yes, sure.

413
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:37,954
Thank you.

414
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,488
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Aarti.

415
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,388
It's been only few hours in Mumbai.

416
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,426
And see, you are on the front page.

417
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:47,726
Well, what do you know?

418
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:48,330
It's a nice picture.

419
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,825
Let's enter the conference room.
- Sure.

420
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,345
What a girl.

421
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:06,747
I am hungry. Give me some money.

422
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:13,951
Madam.

423
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,853
Give us some as well.

424
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,523
Think about us as well.

425
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,395
I am your oldest friend.

426
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,933
And you don't have time for me.

427
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:24,969
You might be a
billionaire for the world...

428
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,595
...but you are still Akash for me.

429
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:27,798
Tell me where are you meeting?

430
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,864
Yes, we'll meet in one-two days.

431
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,468
Tell me, have you booked my hotel?

432
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:35,342
Yes, I have booked a room in
a brand new five star hotel.

433
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,675
You will be impressed with my choice.

434
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,711
Tell me why isn't Donna here?

435
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,946
She is busier than me.

436
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:43,581
She has lost her mind.

437
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,552
You two definitely had an argument.

438
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,820
I am sure. Not to worry.

439
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,491
I will make your mood better today.

440
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:55,658
There is a surprise for you at night.
- Surprise?

441
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:01,370
Is it a girl?
- Akash, she is havoc.

442
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,973
Awesome. She will make
your mood better in a jiffy.

443
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:07,876
Look, Subhash, thanks
but I am not in the mood.

444
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:09,974
And anyway I have a
very busy schedule.

445
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,312
You know I don't have an
interest in such girls.

446
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,578
You might have a profit in this.

447
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,723
Profit, loss. You always
talk like a businessman.

448
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,693
No. Isn't friendship something?

449
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:26,698
My friend has come to
Mumbai after such a long time.

450
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:29,565
So it's my duty to look after him.

451
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,360
Oh no, I am disappointed.

452
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,800
These days no one cares about friends.

453
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,567
Okay, stop your charade.

454
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:38,300
Tell me what do you want?

455
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,770
She is from Chandigarh.

456
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,537
She doesn't have money and
also borrowed money from me.

457
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:45,442
Can you send me 50,000 tomorrow?

458
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,518
Okay, listen I have to go.

459
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,612
Okay, fine. So it's all set.

460
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:55,349
Blue Martine club, be
there before 10 o'clock. Okay.

461
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:58,794
And yes, her name is Reena.
- Okay, okay. Bye.

462
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:01,690
Hello.

463
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,367
I want them right here, okay.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:17,507
Good evening, Mr. Gupta.

465
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,774
Myself, kohli. Always at your service.

466
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,319
It's a pleasure and
honour to have you here, sir.

467
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:23,847
Pleasure.

468
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:28,291
The presidential suite is
ready for you. - Wonderful.

469
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:30,720
The Blue Martine bar, this way, sir.

470
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:33,287
That one?
- Allow me, please.

471
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:34,957
Its okay, I will manage.
- Fine sir.

472
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,340
Reena.

473
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,939
Yes. You?

474
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,345
Akash.
- Sandy's friend.

475
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,776
Sandy?

476
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,609
You mean Subhash.

477
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,387
Subhash?

478
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:00,485
Anyway, can we sit?

479
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:07,691
Waiter.

480
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:13,797
Yes, sir.

481
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:16,604
I will have a Glenn
Rivet on the rocks. - Okay.

482
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,666
And, Reena, what
would you like to drink?

483
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:20,974
Nothing, no thanks.
- Sure?

484
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,413
Okay, that's it.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,020
So, how do you know Subhash?

486
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,299
We met in Chandigarh
during a fashion show.

487
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,932
That's where we got acquainted.

488
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:49,468
How do you know, Sandy?

489
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,968
Subhash is my childhood friend.

490
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,773
We used to study
together in seventh standard.

491
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,378
Then he kept failing each year...

492
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,917
...and never made it
beyond seventh standard.

493
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:08,921
Your drink, sir.

494
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:10,588
Thank you.

495
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:21,565
So... you are from Chandigarh.

496
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,500
Why did you come to Mumbai?

497
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,576
I came here for a shoot.

498
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,539
Which Sandy had fixed.

499
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,440
But it got cancelled.

500
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,248
And I also had an
audition in Premraj studios.

501
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,982
But that got postponed as well.

502
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:39,788
Premraj is in Switzerland.

503
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,515
He will come after three-four days.

504
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,419
How do you know?

505
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:47,560
Do you know him?
- Yes, he's a friend of mine.

506
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,398
Oh.

507
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:53,929
Why do you come to India?

508
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,734
For business.

509
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:00,411
In a year I come to
India about three-four...

510
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,379
Actually four-five times.

511
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:09,315
Sandy said that you
produce films as well.

512
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,426
And he must have fixed your
audition with Premraj, isn't it?

513
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:20,326
Yes.
- You cannot trust, Sandy.

514
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:30,934
Reena. You are a pretty girl.

515
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:34,545
Why do you need to do all this?

516
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:40,349
You come to India for
business meetings, as well.

517
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,045
So why do you do this?

518
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,591
Well... Sandy forced me to.

519
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,862
Sandy told me as well...

520
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:58,831
...that his friend is
coming from America.

521
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,530
Go and meet him.

522
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,640
If you don't want to
then don't stay there.

523
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,978
So... what does your heart say?

524
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,959
I haven't decided anything yet.

525
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,961
Okay, here's the deal.

526
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:31,829
We have already met.

527
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:34,395
And anyway it's a
question of one night.

528
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,340
I say we should continue.

529
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:38,935
What do you say?

530
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:46,341
Okay.
- Good.

531
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,815
Well, let's head up.

532
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,419
I have had a long day.

533
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,082
This way.

534
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:01,657
Thanks.

535
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:03,692
Wow.

536
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:06,764
Wow.

537
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,639
Reena, I am going to
order room service.

538
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,279
Would you like to have a drink?

539
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:18,940
Yes, you can order something.

540
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,781
Yes, send up one of
your best champagne.

541
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,725
And some kebabs.

542
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:32,326
Will you eat something?

543
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:36,831
Yes, I will have 'Bhel puri'.
- 'Bhel puri'?

544
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,560
Yes, I am a vegetarian.

545
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,467
And I love junk food.

546
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:41,731
You will like it too.

547
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:45,570
Will you try that?
- Thanks, but I like Goan food.

548
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,876
Yes, and send one 'Bhel puri'.

549
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:52,612
If you don't have it
then get it from somewhere.

550
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,647
Wow.

551
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,289
And send it fast.

552
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:08,599
Seems like you haven't seen
a presidential suite before?

553
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,565
It's fine, nothing special.

554
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,036
One day I will buy a
similar flat in Mumbai...

555
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,001
...when I become a big star.
- I see.

556
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:22,378
How big a star?
- My first film will be a super-hit.

557
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,710
After that my next five films...

558
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,817
...will break all the earlier records.

559
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,319
Just two more years, you watch.

560
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:32,751
Room service.

561
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,963
Your order, sir.
- Come in.

562
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:44,734
Place the food over there...

563
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,862
...and get me two champagne glasses.

564
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,653
So, Mr. Akash, what do you do?

565
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,891
I buy companies and then sell them.

566
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:19,002
So, are you in India to buy a company?

567
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:21,995
Yes, one of India's biggest company.

568
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:26,268
...and sell them for on a high price?

569
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:29,371
Like people do with property?

570
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,273
Very good, you are very intelligent.

571
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,515
Yes, but there's a slight different.

572
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:39,849
I buy those companies whose owners...

573
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,653
...don't know the real
value of their company.

574
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,790
And then I sell them
for a higher price.

575
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:49,494
So that means if
someone owns a diamond...

576
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:55,398
...and he doesn't know that
then you buy it for a low price...

577
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,337
...and sell it for its real price.

578
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:00,408
That's cheating.

579
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:09,383
Consider it that I break
that diamond into pieces...

580
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,284
...and sell it for its right price.

581
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,288
But when anything's broken...

582
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,319
...then someone is definitely hurt.

583
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,493
I care only about the profit
and not with anyone's pain.

584
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:27,034
You are very cold-hearted.

585
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,468
Well, this is business, that's all.

586
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,780
Anyway, forget it.

587
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,322
Tell me, how much
profit did you make...

588
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:48,548
...in your last deal?

589
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,594
About 500 million dollars.

590
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:56,458
I don't understand dollars.

591
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,468
Tell me in rupees. How many rupees?

592
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,673
Around 3000 crores.

593
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:11,348
3000 crores. Oh my, God.

594
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,451
What do you do with all the money?

595
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:17,583
With all that money a
person earns respect, Reena.

596
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,949
You see the world bows before money.

597
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,960
And money means
everything in this world.

598
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:29,490
I don't believe
money means everything.

599
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:31,529
Why not?

600
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:34,736
There is nothing more
powerful than money in this world.

601
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:37,306
And everything in this
world can be brought with money

602
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,776
I don't know, Mr. Akash.

603
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,382
But I feel you can
never buy love with money.

604
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,378
Forget these things.

605
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,354
Tell me how did you
like the champagne?

606
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,589
The champagne's nice.

607
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,686
Don Perri...
- Don Perrione.

608
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,763
World's best champagne.

609
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:12,872
Actually, me and my wife Rashmi...

610
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:15,403
...got divorced three years ago.

611
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:16,841
She lives in London now...

612
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:18,280
...and has a ball with my money.

613
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,713
And girlfriends?

614
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,885
Donna.

615
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:29,020
She is in New York.

616
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,622
We had an argument before I came here.

617
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,663
She is a managing director
in an investment company...

618
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,599
...and she is busier than me.

619
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:42,038
She couldn't come here
so I came here all alone.

620
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,941
Don't you miss her?

621
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,879
No, not really.

622
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:52,608
Why?

623
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,312
After all I am having champagne...

624
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:00,751
...with the future superstar of India.

625
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:05,591
Oh, excuse me.

626
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,399
Yes, Parag.

627
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,567
Yes, what's the matter?

628
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:22,277
I am sorry, I am busy in a meeting.

629
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:24,943
Yes, okay. I will sign that.

630
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,609
Oh, so you are already here.

631
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,951
Okay, give me a minute.

632
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:31,285
I will be down.

633
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:34,991
Reena, I am sorry.

634
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:36,351
Something has come up.

635
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,562
Please enjoy the
food and the champagne.

636
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,758
I will be back soon, okay.
- Okay.

637
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:48,329
Hi, Akash.

638
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:49,870
Sorry to disturb you so late.

639
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:51,033
Oh, had to be done.

640
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:54,501
Okay. All the details of the project.

641
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:55,944
Read it carefully.

642
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,778
Actually the company is
in a bad shape right now.

643
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,851
So we can dictate the policies.
- Yes.

644
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,322
Everything is legal.

645
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,423
There are no liabilities.

646
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:15,322
And sorry to disturb
you so late once again.

647
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,527
It's okay. It had to be done.
- Goodnight, Parag.

648
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,763
And make sure you send all
of this tomorrow. - Oh, sure.

649
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:20,997
Okay. Alright.

650
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:22,364
Well, goodnight.

651
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:57,338
Goodnight.

652
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:10,478
Elite knows that we want to
snatch his company from him.

653
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,980
And maybe he wants to
talk to you about that.

654
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,756
But, Akash, I don't
think you should talk to him.

655
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,588
There is no harm in meeting him.

656
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:19,725
Tell the Elite chairman that...

657
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,698
...I will meet him for dinner, tonight.

658
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,590
Fine, if you do want to meet him...

659
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:25,727
...then why don't you do it socially?

660
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,027
Keep business out of it.

661
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:30,332
This way you will get
to know each other well.

662
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,672
I will arrange for a meeting
and call you back. - Okay.

663
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:33,836
Bye.

664
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:45,583
Good morning, Reena.
- Good morning, Akash.

665
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,590
What time did you return last night?

666
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,793
Last night I was very busy.

667
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:52,758
I got delayed.

668
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,364
Because you had too much champagne.

669
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:00,900
By the time I returned,
you were totally flat.

670
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:04,538
I had champagne for the first time.

671
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:07,003
I didn't realize when I fell asleep.

672
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,839
So... what happened last night?

673
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,921
I slept outside on the sofa.

674
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:23,384
You slept outside on the sofa.

675
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:26,694
I fell asleep while working.

676
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:29,393
Actually it was quite comfortable.

677
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:31,961
You are really busy.

678
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:37,404
Have something.

679
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:44,812
And what is your plan for today?

680
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,075
Today I have my portfolio shoot.

681
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,352
After that I have to do some shopping.

682
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,945
After that, back... to Chandigarh.

683
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,448
So soon.

684
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:57,356
What is the hurry?

685
00:41:57,495 --> 00:41:59,588
Stay back for few more days in Mumbai.

686
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:02,860
I do want to.

687
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,734
But what will I do here?

688
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:07,564
I didn't get what I came here for?

689
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:13,335
And... anyway... I have
to return home soon.

690
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:19,471
Oh my, God. I am getting late now.

691
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:23,920
Before leaving can I
take a bath in the tub?

692
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:25,320
Sure, why not?

693
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,718
Just don't get drowned.

694
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:44,499
Yes, Rahul.

695
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:47,575
Your dinner appointment with
Elite's chairman Mr. Vanjani...

696
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:48,771
...has been fixed.

697
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:50,937
And he knows that you
are coming with your date...

698
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,415
...for a social dinner.

699
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,349
By the way, I know some
lovely girls in Mumbai.

700
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:59,988
I will make arrangements
for dinner date today, okay.

701
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:01,789
Don't worry about that, Rahul.

702
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,292
I will arrange for a date myself.

703
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,660
You will arrange for a dinner date...

704
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,360
...for yourself in Mumbai?

705
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,761
Rahul. I said, I
will manage it myself.

706
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:14,998
Okay, bye.

707
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,874
Reena.
- "Ask him to show himself."

708
00:43:23,948 --> 00:43:25,916
Come out, I need to talk to you.

709
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:34,683
What is it?

710
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:39,056
Reena, you want to
audition for Premraj's next film.

711
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:42,828
Yes, I am getting a
portfolio shot today for him.

712
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:49,535
Yes, fine. You can get a
portfolio done but you won't need it.

713
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,002
I can get your
audition fixed just like that.

714
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,348
But... how will that happen?

715
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:01,275
He isn't here?
- No problem.

716
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,419
I will call Premraj in Switzerland...

717
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:05,853
...and tell him about you.

718
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,524
Your audition will be fixed as well.

719
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,522
Will he agree?
- Why not?

720
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:12,285
He's a very close friend of mine.

721
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:15,830
In fact he will take your
audition the day he arrives.

722
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:20,435
Superb.
- But... there's a condition.

723
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:23,765
Condition?

724
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:26,567
What condition?

725
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,276
Come, let's sit.

726
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:30,439
I will explain to you.

727
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:43,393
Reena, I am in Mumbai for
four-five days for business.

728
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:48,423
So naturally I need a companion...

729
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:52,868
...who will attend important
parties and meetings with me.

730
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:58,375
I was hoping that you stay with me.

731
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:04,647
But you can take any girl.

732
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,547
Then why me?

733
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,552
Yes, I can take any girl along.

734
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:14,653
But the first thing is,
you are very interesting.

735
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:21,393
And secondly, I need an
Indian and smart girl.

736
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:22,523
Like you.

737
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,301
I won't get someone
like that that easily.

738
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:29,032
And beauty?

739
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,274
Yes, of course.

740
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:34,675
Beautiful too. So...

741
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:40,849
But... it was
different about one night.

742
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:44,815
I cannot stay so many days.

743
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:47,788
Why can't you?

744
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:50,961
You came to Mumbai
to become an actress...

745
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,265
Well, think about that?

746
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,699
You won't get a
chance like this again.

747
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:14,242
I think... you are right.

748
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:19,382
But do you think I will get
Premraj's film. - Yes, of course.

749
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:21,948
Do well in the audition
and the role is guaranteed.

750
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,467
Okay, so... what else
will I have to do?

751
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,706
What else will you have to do?

752
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:44,042
Reena. You won't have
to do anything else.

753
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:46,883
Nothing against your will.

754
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,680
Everything will be as per your wish.

755
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,047
And you will just be with me.

756
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:53,415
We will attend parties, dinners.

757
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,558
You will have a lot of fun, trust me.

758
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:58,954
Really?
- One hundred percent.

759
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:02,227
Okay.

760
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:04,761
Okay, means?

761
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:08,401
Okay means I am staying back.

762
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,832
Great.

763
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:16,279
Here.

764
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:19,515
This is extra benefits.

765
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:20,274
I am going for a meeting.

766
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:23,418
I suggest that you do
some shopping, okay.

767
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:25,852
And we have to go
for a dinner tonight.

768
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:27,913
I will call you soon.

769
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:30,759
But when will you talk to Premraj.

770
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:33,020
I have already spoken to Premraj...

771
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:34,887
...and your audition
has been fixed as well.

772
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,801
That means you knew I will say yes.

773
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,002
I wasn't going to give up
without making you say yes.

774
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,667
You are lucky.

775
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:47,540
If you would've been any bad
I would've never said yes.

776
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:50,437
Well, thankfully this time you
didn't call me cold-hearted.

777
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:55,443
Yes.

778
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:21,744
"I am on earth."

779
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:30,319
"Lord, tell me."

780
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:33,786
"Lord, tell me."

781
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:37,958
"Which world am I in?"

782
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:40,889
"I am not in my senses."

783
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:42,899
"I am completely thoughtless."

784
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:46,869
"I am not happy nor am I sad."

785
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:49,906
"I am alone."

786
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:54,934
"I am in a crowd."

787
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:58,742
"Lord, tell me."

788
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:03,414
"Lord, tell me."

789
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:07,747
"Which world am I in?"

790
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:38,946
"I just halt... while walking."

791
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,449
"I start walking suddenly."

792
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:47,495
"Suddenly... while walking on."

793
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:51,861
"I change my path."

794
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:53,902
"I am not in my senses."

795
00:49:53,971 --> 00:49:55,996
"I am completely thoughtless."

796
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,976
"I am not happy nor am I sad."

797
00:50:00,044 --> 00:50:03,741
"I am alone."

798
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:08,376
"I am in a crowd."

799
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:11,912
"Lord, tell me."

800
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:16,319
"Lord, tell me."

801
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,320
"Which world am I in?"

802
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,373
Priya.

803
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:41,681
Hi, Reena. Where are you?
- Heaven.

804
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:44,687
Don't joke.
- I am not joking, Priya.

805
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,416
I feel like I am in heaven.

806
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,785
You won't believe
what happened with me.

807
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:52,426
At first I thought
I am in big trouble.

808
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:54,760
But Lord Ganesha managed everything.

809
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:56,897
I met this guy Akash.

810
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:57,365
You know...

811
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,714
But, Reena, what will
I tell everyone here...

812
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:13,443
...for so many days.

813
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:16,411
Tell them the shoot has been delayed.

814
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:17,977
Please manage two-four days more.

815
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:19,480
Please, Priya. Please.

816
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,990
Please manage two-four days more.

817
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,722
You are my best friend, isn't it?
- I will try.

818
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,692
But what if they didn't agree?

819
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:30,398
Premraj and Akash are best friends.

820
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:31,659
Right after the auditions...

821
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,896
...I am going to be his
next film's actress.

822
00:51:34,738 --> 00:51:37,764
Priya, I cannot come
back for three-four days.

823
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:39,340
Oh my, God.

824
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:42,002
My hair!

825
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:44,470
I cannot go like this.

826
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,575
Priya, I have to go now.

827
00:51:47,684 --> 00:51:48,981
Love you, take care. Bye.

828
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,053
Good evening, Mr. Gupta.
- Good evening.

829
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:00,859
How was your day, sir?
- Good.

830
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:03,761
Sir, Ms. Reena is waiting for
you in the Blue Martine Bar.

831
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,529
Thank you, Mr. Kohli.
- You are most welcome.

832
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:48,802
You are late.

833
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:51,076
Sorry. Mumbai traffic.

834
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:53,841
How am I looking?

835
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,386
Simply gorgeous.

836
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:00,551
I didn't know, Reena,
that you are so beautiful.

837
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,821
So where are we going?

838
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:05,655
Meeraj restaurant.

839
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:07,694
Mumbai's best restaurant.

840
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:08,856
You will love it.

841
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:10,457
Shall we?

842
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,927
Good evening, sir.
- Monty.

843
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:18,734
When did you come in this hotel?

844
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,036
I just started last week, sir.

845
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,970
And now you shifted to the
piano from the saxophone.

846
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,549
Sir. But who can play
the piano better than you.

847
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:29,942
Sir, let's play together one day.

848
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,378
Why not?

849
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,479
I would love that. One of these days.

850
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:35,586
Do find time some day, sir.

851
00:53:37,794 --> 00:53:38,886
Good evening, ma'am.

852
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:45,962
You play the piano as well.
- I do when I have the time.

853
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,777
Do find time. I want to
hear it someday. - Sure.

854
00:53:58,482 --> 00:53:59,847
What a nice restaurant.

855
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:07,513
Welcome, Mr. Gupta. Mr.
Vanjani is waiting for you.

856
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:08,683
Please.

857
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,457
Yes, fine. We'll see
the terms and policies.

858
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:16,724
Then we will confirm.

859
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:18,958
Mr. Gupta, welcome.

860
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:20,936
Mr. Vanjani.
- Nice to meet you.

861
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:23,933
My brother Dev.
- Hi, Dev.

862
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:25,399
Hi.

863
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:27,901
This is my friend, Reena.

864
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:29,444
Hello, Ms. Reena.
- Hello.

865
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:30,810
Dev.
- Hi.

866
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:32,881
Please sit down, please.

867
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:41,015
There is a special menu for you.

868
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:42,389
I hope you like it.

869
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:43,918
We shall see.

870
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,294
You have.
- Okay.

871
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:49,390
I am okay.

872
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,363
Well, let's get to the point.

873
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,367
Mr. Gupta, we have heard that...

874
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:58,498
...you are thinking of
taking over our company.

875
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:01,903
Yes, something like that.

876
00:55:02,813 --> 00:55:03,905
And we have also heard that...

877
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:14,346
...for the majority shares.

878
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:18,519
Good. Your information is right.

879
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:24,425
Mr. Gupta, I built Elite Industries...

880
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,866
...with hard work and grit.

881
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:30,397
I know each of its
employees by their names.

882
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:32,768
If you are thinking
of buying my company...

883
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:37,438
...dividing it into pieces
and selling it in the market...

884
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,509
...then think once again because...

885
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,813
...I will never let that happen.

886
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,778
Excuse me.

887
00:55:48,825 --> 00:55:50,019
Ravi, I will call you back.

888
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:54,856
Thank you.

889
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:58,693
Is it okay.

890
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:00,692
Yes.

891
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:03,701
Mr. Vanjani. What do you want?

892
00:56:05,642 --> 00:56:08,634
I want to buy back my stocks.

893
00:56:10,414 --> 00:56:11,642
Name your price.

894
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:15,482
Actually I am not in a mood to sell.

895
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,650
But if you do want
to convince me then...

896
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,619
...double of whatever I
bought your shares in.

897
00:56:23,493 --> 00:56:25,825
By the way, does your company...

898
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,454
...have the money to buy it?

899
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:29,359
Money will not be a problem.

900
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:31,430
As far as getting double
the price is concerned...

901
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,695
...then you can forget that.

902
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:36,532
But we can give you 10%
profit on your shares.

903
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,532
We can...
- Mr. Vanjani.

904
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:41,744
I am not here to sell but to buy.

905
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:45,677
You are really courageous.

906
00:56:46,683 --> 00:56:49,413
Not courage, but power, Mr. Vanjani.

907
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:51,315
Money power.

908
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:53,754
I know all about
your power, Mr. Gupta.

909
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:57,322
Any company that you buy
disappears in few days.

910
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:01,822
And its employees are
immediately jobless.

911
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:04,730
Widows stop
receiving their pay cheques.

912
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,735
That's what you are
all about, Mr. Gupta.

913
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:10,569
Whatever I do, Mr.
Vanjani, I do it legally.

914
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:12,867
Its business and its all legal.

915
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,375
It's not about legal and illegal.

916
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:17,547
It's about your cheap thinking.

917
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:19,878
You take advantage of
people's helplessness.

918
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,547
Then ruin them.

919
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:23,313
And I will not let you do that to me.

920
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,247
Mr. Vanjani, Elite was your company.

921
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,448
Today its a public company...

922
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:31,357
...which is in financial problems.

923
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:34,457
I have invested lot of time
and money in this company.

924
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:36,357
And now I won't let it go.

925
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:39,668
It will be best for you
that you cooperate with me.

926
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,898
And don't fight a
battle which you cannot win.

927
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:44,297
That's it. I have had enough.

928
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:46,801
Dinner is over.

929
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:49,568
Excuse me, Ms. Reena.
- Mr. Gupta.

930
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,383
This is how you play a game.

931
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:14,537
Ruining someone's life's
earnings for your profit.

932
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:16,966
What kind of a game is this?

933
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,812
What are you thinking about?

934
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,787
Reena, I want to buy the
Elite company at any cost.

935
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:41,261
Why are you always
after making profit?

936
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:45,792
To make profit and
money is my business.

937
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:50,906
But, it is not good to
always think about making money.

938
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:54,275
You should spare some time for
other things in life as well.

939
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:57,441
Reena, if that would
have been my thinking...

940
00:58:58,615 --> 00:59:00,515
...then I would have
never been where I am today.

941
00:59:00,784 --> 00:59:03,617
But Akash, you should consider that...

942
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,416
...Raj and Dev are nice people.

943
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:09,925
It's not about whether
they are nice or not.

944
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,686
It's about business.

945
00:59:12,529 --> 00:59:15,521
And there is no place
for emotions in business.

946
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:19,768
Emotions are bound to
be there in business.

947
00:59:20,437 --> 00:59:22,632
Because you deal
with humans in business.

948
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:32,541
I am sorry, Reena, but I don't have
time to think about all these things.

949
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:35,511
You don't have time for anything.

950
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:38,318
Your life is so busy
that you don't have time...

951
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:41,255
...to understand
anyone's feelings or emotions.

952
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:52,331
Okay, just forget it,
please. No more business talk.

953
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,801
I'm feeling very hungry.

954
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,606
Why? Didn't you eat
anything at the restaurant?

955
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,668
It was a very sad restaurant.

956
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,472
It didn't have the food I like.

957
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:05,780
Okay. No problem. Here,
order for room service.

958
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:10,547
They will bring it quickly
if they hear your voice.

959
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:15,355
Okay, madam. What will you have?

960
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,695
'Dal Makhani', 'Bhindi Masala',
'Rumali Roti', 'Palak Paneer'.

961
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:24,463
That's all.
- That's all.

962
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,063
Right away, madam.

963
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:28,702
I'll go and change.

964
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,708
Yeah, room service?

965
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:41,507
'AIright. Welcome to Top Funds.'

966
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:44,052
'Let's quickly go across to
Priyank who is in conversation... '

967
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:46,414
'... with the
management of Shree Cements.'

968
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:49,916
"Your eyes..."

969
01:00:50,593 --> 01:00:54,552
Roop Kumar Rathod. You
know I am his big fan.

970
01:00:55,966 --> 01:00:58,833
Really? So he is your favourite?
- Yeah.

971
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,094
"I am..."

972
01:01:01,504 --> 01:01:05,838
Hey, how did Monty from
the lounge bar downstairs...

973
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:08,710
...come on our television screen?

974
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,039
Actually, there is a camera
installed at the lounge bar.

975
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,310
If one is not in the
mood to go downstairs...

976
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:16,716
...one can sit here and
enjoy the lounge's ambience.

977
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,389
This facility is available
only for the presidential suite.

978
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:22,484
That's really cool.

979
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:26,727
"Your eyes are mesmerizing."

980
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:31,731
You know this was
Deepika's first film.

981
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:34,326
And she became a star after one film.

982
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:36,838
Like you will be
after your first film.

983
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:39,339
I want to be.

984
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:47,675
Reena, don't you have a boyfriend?

985
01:01:47,884 --> 01:01:48,976
No.

986
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,515
Such a beautiful girl
doesn't have a boyfriend?

987
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:55,757
A lot of boys are crazy about me.

988
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:58,089
But I don't
encourage anyone, you know.

989
01:01:58,361 --> 01:01:59,726
I am just not interested.

990
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:01,822
Why not?

991
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:05,432
Because for the moment
I don't want a boyfriend.

992
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:07,402
I want to be a star.

993
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,371
But how is you having a boyfriend
related to you becoming a star?

994
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:13,339
Because...

995
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:17,711
Because... Because no boy
wants his girlfriend...

996
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:20,883
...to romance a hero on
a television screen.

997
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:28,555
Reena, really, you
are very, very smart.

998
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:37,432
But why are you so
interested in my boyfriend?

999
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:41,498
Should I think that
billionaire Akash Gupta's heart...

1000
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,062
...has started beating for me?

1001
01:02:46,443 --> 01:02:47,501
Not at all.

1002
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:51,544
We are together only
for sometime, Reena.

1003
01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:54,648
But I know you really like me.

1004
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:57,319
Wrong. Absolutely wrong.

1005
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,250
You don't?

1006
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,587
Okay, maybe a little.

1007
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:14,462
Yes, Parag?

1008
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:16,666
How was your meeting, Akash?

1009
01:03:17,273 --> 01:03:18,501
Meeting...

1010
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:19,900
It was fine.

1011
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:23,476
Raj Vanjani wants to fight.

1012
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,870
I had sent a fax to your hotel.

1013
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,314
Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1014
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:31,515
Akash, we have to send our response...

1015
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,283
...to New York in a few hours.

1016
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:35,881
Can you review the fax right now?

1017
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:37,358
Right now?

1018
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:40,421
Okay.

1019
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,445
Hey, guys.
- Hi.

1020
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:34,676
How was your flight?
- Good. Good. Very good.

1021
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:37,846
Okay.

1022
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,445
Nice presentation, Mr. Sharma.

1023
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,751
But the terms of
your funding proposal...

1024
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:45,323
I am sorry. They are not
at all acceptable to me.

1025
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:48,520
Sir, there are standard
terms of Norman Stanley...

1026
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:49,326
...for this level of funding proposal.

1027
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,464
But standard terms won't work here.

1028
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:54,929
I really need a better deal.

1029
01:04:55,505 --> 01:04:58,338
Otherwise... I have other options.

1030
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,943
Mr. Sharma, our legal
department has some issues.

1031
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:03,936
They should be
resolved as soon as possible.

1032
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,908
No problem, sir. Let's
go through the details.

1033
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:14,948
Excuse me.

1034
01:05:18,895 --> 01:05:20,419
Good morning, Akash.

1035
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,488
Good afternoon, Reena.

1036
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,032
Why didn't you wake me up?

1037
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,897
When I left, you were
sleeping so peacefully...

1038
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,598
...that I thought that I
shouldn't disturb you.

1039
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:31,003
Anyway, I had to go for a meeting.

1040
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:33,371
By what time will you be free?

1041
01:05:35,745 --> 01:05:37,406
I don't know. It
will take me some time.

1042
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,906
Shall we meet for lunch?

1043
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:42,014
Lunch? No, lunch is not possible.

1044
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:44,279
Okay, what are your
plans for this evening?

1045
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,587
Oh, yes. We have to go for an
important business meeting...

1046
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:47,816
...in the evening.

1047
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:49,583
Okay, boss.

1048
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:51,957
Bye.
- Bye. Take care.

1049
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:54,594
All the legal issues...

1050
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,062
Yes, all that work should be done.

1051
01:05:56,332 --> 01:05:57,594
The terms and conditions...

1052
01:05:57,667 --> 01:05:58,759
Right?
- Yes, sir.

1053
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,860
Who's that?
- Never mind.

1054
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,537
Stop it. There is no
point in arguing. - What?

1055
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:11,243
What do you mean, Ashok?

1056
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:12,439
Sameer should have sent
me the project report.

1057
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:15,416
Look, Nisha, if he didn't say it
on time when what I can do about it?

1058
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:17,246
Anyway, this isn't your fault either.

1059
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:20,380
What is this business party?
- What?

1060
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,487
Hey. Hi, Akash.
- Rahul.

1061
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:28,797
And this must be Reena.

1062
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:30,525
How do you know?

1063
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:33,633
Rahul Bajaj.
- Hello. Reena.

1064
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:36,862
I am Akash's friend
as well as his lawyer.

1065
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:39,566
We know each other
since the last ten years.

1066
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,904
He cannot do any deal without me.

1067
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:45,505
Where's Ashok?

1068
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:47,840
Here's Ashok.
- Welcome.

1069
01:06:48,017 --> 01:06:49,575
Welcome, Akash.
- Thank you, Ashok.

1070
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:51,017
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1071
01:06:51,287 --> 01:06:53,278
Listen, I had some
business to discuss...

1072
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:56,052
...regarding the Elite deal.
The liability clause in it...

1073
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:57,452
I have some comments about them.

1074
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,651
Akash, you have just
come to the party.

1075
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:01,492
Enjoy the party. We will
talk about the business deal...

1076
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:02,758
...and things about it later.

1077
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:06,958
Ashok's law firm is
handling Elite's deal.

1078
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:08,964
Oh, that's great.
- Come, let's have a drink.

1079
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:10,302
Come on.
- This way.

1080
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:11,465
Come, Reena.

1081
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:13,801
Make one for me.

1082
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,372
Akash.
- Nisha.

1083
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,914
Hey.
- I am glad to see you.

1084
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:22,246
I am so delighted that you
could make it. - Thank you.

1085
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:23,717
And you are looking
as handsome as ever.

1086
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:25,287
Well, you haven't
changed much yourself as well.

1087
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:26,947
As pretty as ever.
- Thank you.

1088
01:07:27,023 --> 01:07:28,820
And by the way, this is Reena.

1089
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:30,620
Reena, this is Nisha. Ashok's fiancA©e.

1090
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:31,785
Hi.
- Hi.

1091
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,693
Hi.
- And his ex-girlfriend.

1092
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:36,560
Anyway, congratulations.

1093
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:37,792
Finally you did it.

1094
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:38,993
Yes, I did.

1095
01:07:39,268 --> 01:07:41,702
I was tired of waiting for you, Akash.

1096
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,361
You didn't want to get married.

1097
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:44,564
For how long should have I waited?

1098
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,369
I thought I should get married.

1099
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:49,539
It is not so, Nisha.
Before I could do anything...

1100
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:50,943
...Ashok stole you away.

1101
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,577
Congrats. You are a lucky guy.

1102
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,707
That I am. But I didn't steal anyone.

1103
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:56,752
The truth is that you
didn't want to get married.

1104
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,548
And there is nothing wrong
with it. He is a good looking guy.

1105
01:07:58,621 --> 01:07:59,815
He wants to live a
commitment free life.

1106
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:00,947
Nothing wrong with that.

1107
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:03,255
There is only one
commitment in Akash's life.

1108
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:04,717
Money.

1109
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:07,819
More the deals. More the money. Right?

1110
01:08:07,864 --> 01:08:08,922
Cheers to that.

1111
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:10,522
Always cheers to money, man.

1112
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:12,366
Guys, I'll see you later.

1113
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:13,799
Have a blast.
- Thank you.

1114
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:15,702
I need to speak to you.
- Come.

1115
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,007
Nothing.

1116
01:08:29,352 --> 01:08:30,410
There is something.

1117
01:08:30,653 --> 01:08:31,745
What are you thinking about?

1118
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:36,419
Since... when do you know Nisha?

1119
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:41,692
Before Donna, Nisha and I
were good friends in New York.

1120
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:43,562
Then she got transferred to India.

1121
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:45,693
Friend?

1122
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:51,531
Yes, but I had no such intention.

1123
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,033
Really?
- Really.

1124
01:08:55,778 --> 01:08:57,575
You won't understand, Reena.

1125
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,848
Akash, I need to speak to you.

1126
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:02,550
Alright. Give me a minute.

1127
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:06,882
Akash.

1128
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,838
Where did you meet Reena?

1129
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:31,274
Here. In Mumbai.

1130
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:35,976
Any idea about her background?

1131
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:38,479
Is there a problem?

1132
01:09:39,689 --> 01:09:40,781
There is no problem.

1133
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:45,260
But why are you spending
so much time with her?

1134
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,902
Rahul. I appreciate your concern...

1135
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:59,635
...but let me handle
my own personal life.

1136
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,774
I have always
thought of your wellbeing.

1137
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:08,908
You know that.

1138
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:10,316
Rahul, forget about my wellbeing...

1139
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:12,480
...and think about Elite's deal, okay?

1140
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:20,788
Excuse me.

1141
01:10:21,564 --> 01:10:23,361
Sir. Madam is over there.

1142
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,582
Ma'am, you can go ahead.

1143
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,784
What happened?

1144
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:53,919
The party was very boring.

1145
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,421
We will have fun here.
Let's go inside.

1146
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:58,659
Let's go.

1147
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,051
That was a lot of fun.

1148
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,315
Much better than that party.
- Yeah. You bet.

1149
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:33,460
Come on, let's go.
- Come, sir.

1150
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:35,489
It's a nice weather.

1151
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:37,023
Let's walk.

1152
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:40,065
Okay. Nelson, follow us.

1153
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:45,067
Well, I haven't done
this in a while, you know.

1154
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:54,344
Akash, in the party, why did
you say that I won't understand?

1155
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:58,979
Reena, the girls that I
have been involved with...

1156
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,551
Different? What do
you mean by different?

1157
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:09,495
They... They were very business...
very career minded.

1158
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:13,001
That means I am not career minded?

1159
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:14,429
No, no.

1160
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:17,436
Sorry. I am sure you
are very career minded.

1161
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:19,035
Let me rephrase it.

1162
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:23,905
Those girls were very money minded.

1163
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,978
And you... You are very simple.

1164
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:28,543
You're vary nice.

1165
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,312
You are very different from
those girls. - Sister. Sister.

1166
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:31,614
Please buy the flower.

1167
01:13:31,987 --> 01:13:33,284
So sweet.

1168
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:34,515
Oh, thank you.

1169
01:13:35,658 --> 01:13:36,750
Here you go.

1170
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:43,390
Okay. Why did you divorce Rashmi?

1171
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,364
Because Rashmi loved
my money more than me.

1172
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:51,334
That's why.
- Oh...

1173
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:56,307
We got divorced one
year after our marriage.

1174
01:13:57,847 --> 01:14:00,873
I'm so sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

1175
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:03,714
Well, anyway, now you know.

1176
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:07,752
But now I think twice before
I give my commitment or love.

1177
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:13,489
But one doesn't
think and fall in love.

1178
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:18,729
Love just happens.

1179
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:20,461
Why?

1180
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:25,270
You had said that you are not
ready for a commitment right now.

1181
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:29,377
Well, it is not so.

1182
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:33,873
Actually, I haven't found anyone yet.

1183
01:14:34,483 --> 01:14:36,417
With whom I would
like to get involved.

1184
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,987
And how will you know when
you will meet that person?

1185
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,516
Something will click for sure.

1186
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:47,591
And I will know on my own.

1187
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:52,493
Really?
- He will be my life.

1188
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,395
Life?
- Yes, my life.

1189
01:14:57,439 --> 01:14:58,997
The one who will love me a lot.

1190
01:15:00,476 --> 01:15:05,812
And the one with whom I will
spend the rest of my life.

1191
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,252
That happens only in movies.

1192
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,412
Not in real life, Reena.

1193
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:14,949
Anyway, it has never happened with me.

1194
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,283
How will it happen with you?

1195
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:19,989
You need time for it.

1196
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:21,827
And you don't have time.

1197
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:25,398
And your Rashmi, Nisha, Donna...

1198
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:29,498
These highflying foreign
girls don't have time for you.

1199
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,033
I think you are right.

1200
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:36,444
But there must be a solution for it.

1201
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:41,942
You should find a nice Indian girl.

1202
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:45,776
Who will take care of
you and last longer.

1203
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,450
My track record in this is very bad.

1204
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:52,692
Do one thing. Why
don't you find me one?

1205
01:15:54,396 --> 01:15:57,422
It is a difficult job
but I'll think about it.

1206
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,336
'Panipuri'. I want to have it.
- Oh, God.

1207
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:04,269
Please come with me.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1208
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:06,639
Please serve us one plate.

1209
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:09,407
Oh, wow.
- How can you eat this stuff?

1210
01:16:09,478 --> 01:16:10,877
Come on. You should try it as well.

1211
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,346
No. I don't like these things.

1212
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:24,485
Shall I give you an advice?

1213
01:16:24,727 --> 01:16:26,422
You have already given me many.

1214
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
Tell me.

1215
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:30,631
If you want a nice Indian girl then...

1216
01:16:30,699 --> 01:16:33,463
...you should start eating
'Bhelpuri' and 'Panipuri'.

1217
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:36,502
Because all Indian girls like them.

1218
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,671
Really? Then I don't have a choice.

1219
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:41,768
Bring it on.

1220
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:51,885
"The path is missing."

1221
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:54,818
"But I am walking."

1222
01:16:55,291 --> 01:17:01,992
"I am burning in winters as well."

1223
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:12,865
"I am changing."

1224
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:20,408
"There is something
fascinating about you."

1225
01:17:20,749 --> 01:17:26,585
"Is this the magic of love?"

1226
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:32,785
"Is this the magic of love?"

1227
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:40,402
Yeah.

1228
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:43,136
Yummy.

1229
01:17:45,115 --> 01:17:46,275
Akash...

1230
01:17:47,017 --> 01:17:49,417
Akash. Let's go somewhere today.

1231
01:17:49,687 --> 01:17:50,984
Where?

1232
01:17:52,056 --> 01:17:53,284
Let's go for shopping.

1233
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,114
There is a carnival close by.

1234
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:56,682
We will go there as well.
We will have a lot of fun.

1235
01:17:57,328 --> 01:17:59,057
You didn't shop the other day?

1236
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:00,653
I did. But not a lot.

1237
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:03,999
And anyway, it is no
fun to shop alone.

1238
01:18:04,068 --> 01:18:05,660
I'll have a lot of
fun if you are with me.

1239
01:18:05,736 --> 01:18:07,397
Come, let's shop together, today.

1240
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:10,138
Sorry, baby.
I have a lot of work today.

1241
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:12,107
I am busy the whole day.
I have so many meetings.

1242
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,341
All you always think of is work.

1243
01:18:14,478 --> 01:18:16,639
There are so many people
to work for you.

1244
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:18,581
I get bored alone.

1245
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:21,140
Please come with me.
Please. Please. Please.

1246
01:18:21,185 --> 01:18:22,379
Only for today.
- Reena.

1247
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:23,647
Only for today.

1248
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:26,053
Only for me. Please.

1249
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,249
Okay. Let me see.

1250
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:34,589
Yes, tell me, Akash.

1251
01:18:34,665 --> 01:18:37,463
Rahul, cancel all my
meetings for today.

1252
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:39,628
Akash, this is
a very important meeting.

1253
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:42,229
What can be more
important than this?

1254
01:18:42,272 --> 01:18:46,072
I have never seen you neglect work.

1255
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:48,536
What?

1256
01:18:49,012 --> 01:18:50,343
Why will work get neglected, Rahul?

1257
01:18:51,014 --> 01:18:52,345
You, Ravi, Parag.
Everyone is in the office.

1258
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:54,477
What are you guys there for?

1259
01:18:55,452 --> 01:18:56,976
Just keep me updated on the phone.

1260
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:59,414
And if there are any papers for
signing, bring them over tonight.

1261
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:00,615
Okay? Bye.

1262
01:19:01,525 --> 01:19:02,549
Bye.

1263
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:07,123
Happy now?
- Yes.

1264
01:19:07,197 --> 01:19:08,687
Let's go. We will have a lot of fun.

1265
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,300
Could I speak to Donna, please?

1266
01:19:21,712 --> 01:19:23,009
Boss.

1267
01:19:24,748 --> 01:19:26,010
What?

1268
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:35,481
Hello, Mr. Gupta. I am D'souza.

1269
01:19:35,993 --> 01:19:37,085
Hello, D'souza.

1270
01:19:37,561 --> 01:19:39,927
We have come to purchase
all those clothes...

1271
01:19:39,997 --> 01:19:43,091
...that are going to make this
lovely girl look even lovelier.

1272
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,497
Tell me, how can we serve you?

1273
01:19:50,574 --> 01:19:51,666
I'll call one right away.

1274
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,540
Mr. D'souza, I feel you don't
want us to shop at your store.

1275
01:19:59,616 --> 01:20:00,947
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.

1276
01:20:01,018 --> 01:20:04,283
Give me a chance. Just a minute.

1277
01:20:07,124 --> 01:20:08,614
Yes. That's better.

1278
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,023
Shall we start?

1279
01:20:11,662 --> 01:20:12,959
Come.

1280
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,368
Nice.

1281
01:20:32,015 --> 01:20:33,073
Now what?

1282
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,319
But it is very loose.

1283
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:42,358
Oh. Mr. D'souza,
change the fitting of this dress.

1284
01:20:42,426 --> 01:20:44,621
Consider it done.
It will be done right away.

1285
01:20:44,695 --> 01:20:46,219
It takes just two
minutes to change the fitting.

1286
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:48,591
If you want I can get
the design changed as well.

1287
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:50,656
Do one thing. Change
your fitting as well.

1288
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,128
That can happen as well.

1289
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:55,933
My fitting...

1290
01:20:56,573 --> 01:20:59,474
Sir, look, I am very fit,
trim and slim.

1291
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:01,170
Right.

1292
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:11,084
Why don't you try that one?

1293
01:21:12,256 --> 01:21:13,723
Listen, I'll get back to you, okay?

1294
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:21,124
Wow. You're looking stunning.

1295
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:22,722
We will buy this one for sure.

1296
01:21:23,066 --> 01:21:25,000
Sir, your choice is great.

1297
01:21:25,168 --> 01:21:27,068
This one is a great choice.

1298
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,434
Yes, this one is very good as well.

1299
01:21:29,006 --> 01:21:30,166
You have a great choice.

1300
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:32,271
How's this one?

1301
01:21:35,012 --> 01:21:36,172
It's fine.

1302
01:21:37,214 --> 01:21:38,909
Look I too have selected one.

1303
01:21:39,182 --> 01:21:40,649
Wow.
- You like it?

1304
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:42,044
Good choice.

1305
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,403
Your aim is perfect.

1306
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:07,443
I have never had
so much fun in life.

1307
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:10,139
True. I too had a lot of fun today.

1308
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,574
I played such a game
after a long time.

1309
01:22:11,648 --> 01:22:12,706
But why?

1310
01:22:13,283 --> 01:22:15,615
Because I hadn't found
an amazing girl like you before.

1311
01:22:17,487 --> 01:22:20,718
This is how I and my friend Priya
always have fun in Chandigarh.

1312
01:22:20,991 --> 01:22:23,016
I am going to give
this teddy bear to her.

1313
01:22:23,093 --> 01:22:24,583
She will be very happy.
- Okay.

1314
01:22:25,262 --> 01:22:26,354
Akash, I had so much fun.

1315
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:28,557
Good.

1316
01:22:34,404 --> 01:22:35,496
Reena, my cell phone...

1317
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:44,606
This is the same night
gown that I had selected?

1318
01:22:47,918 --> 01:22:49,681
It is looking very nice.

1319
01:22:50,087 --> 01:22:51,418
I'm very happy today.

1320
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:53,617
Because you won so many prizes...

1321
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,317
...that that poor
shop people got scared.

1322
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:58,256
Their faces were worth watching.

1323
01:22:58,595 --> 01:23:00,358
Won't you reward me for my victory.

1324
01:23:04,267 --> 01:23:05,529
This is your reward.

1325
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:07,033
This is hardly a reward.

1326
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:19,205
Akash, I cannot give you
the reward you want.

1327
01:23:38,068 --> 01:23:39,160
Yes, Rahul.

1328
01:23:41,304 --> 01:23:43,465
No, Akash. We cannot wait
till tomorrow morning.

1329
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:45,597
Today, before New
York closing time...

1330
01:23:45,676 --> 01:23:48,076
...we have to email all
the signed documents to the bank.

1331
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:50,644
It is the bank's funding
requirement. Please, Akash.

1332
01:23:50,914 --> 01:23:52,506
I have send Alok to the
lobby with the papers.

1333
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:53,641
Yes, okay.

1334
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:56,578
Okay. I'll come downstairs.

1335
01:23:56,653 --> 01:23:58,177
I'll see where he is
and take care of it.

1336
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:00,281
Bye.

1337
01:24:07,698 --> 01:24:09,256
Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

1338
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:11,998
Hello, sir.

1339
01:24:13,003 --> 01:24:14,197
Hi, Monty.

1340
01:24:15,572 --> 01:24:18,336
Sir, you are looking very sad today.

1341
01:24:20,243 --> 01:24:21,335
Yes, Monty.

1342
01:24:21,645 --> 01:24:23,977
Such is the condition of my heart.
- Oh.

1343
01:24:25,082 --> 01:24:28,245
Sir, the piano is waiting for you.

1344
01:24:28,652 --> 01:24:30,313
How about a song today, sir?

1345
01:24:33,023 --> 01:24:35,082
Okay, Monty. Why not.
But you have got to help me.

1346
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,887
Sure. Come with me.

1347
01:24:37,227 --> 01:24:38,319
Please.

1348
01:25:03,253 --> 01:25:04,311
I need some help.

1349
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:05,647
Give me a lead.
- Okay sir.

1350
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:06,980
Sure.

1351
01:25:54,538 --> 01:25:58,941
"Love left it."

1352
01:26:04,181 --> 01:26:08,515
"Love left it."

1353
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:13,151
"Pain hurts it."

1354
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:20,357
"What should the poor heart do?"

1355
01:26:20,964 --> 01:26:25,663
"What should the poor heart do?"

1356
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:35,004
"My beloved doesn't know
the state of my heart."

1357
01:26:35,078 --> 01:26:44,612
"My beloved doesn't know
the state of my heart."

1358
01:26:44,888 --> 01:26:49,484
"What should the poor heart do?"

1359
01:26:49,893 --> 01:26:55,126
"What should the poor heart do?"

1360
01:27:24,094 --> 01:27:28,053
"My dreams are missing."

1361
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:32,625
"The night is a stranger to me."

1362
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:42,378
"The feeling of love is unknown."

1363
01:27:42,612 --> 01:27:47,140
"My wants are crazy."

1364
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:51,343
"My desires are wild."

1365
01:27:52,322 --> 01:27:56,554
"What should the poor heart do?"

1366
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:02,427
"What should the poor heart do?"

1367
01:28:31,361 --> 01:28:35,263
"It is not ready to stop..."

1368
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:40,159
"...what is this
desire that I have."

1369
01:28:40,337 --> 01:28:49,712
"What is this storm
stirring in my arms?"

1370
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:59,455
"My thirst is not getting quenched."

1371
01:28:59,522 --> 01:29:04,084
"What should the poor heart do?"

1372
01:29:04,361 --> 01:29:08,593
"What should the poor heart do?"

1373
01:29:09,232 --> 01:29:13,601
"What should the poor heart do?"

1374
01:29:14,104 --> 01:29:20,043
"What should the poor heart do?"

1375
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:31,309
Rahul,
when you are with me I feel...

1376
01:29:34,357 --> 01:29:35,551
And I am made for you.

1377
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,357
Rahul. I love you a lot.

1378
01:29:41,598 --> 01:29:47,366
Not for a day, a moment,
but for a lifetime.

1379
01:29:48,505 --> 01:29:50,700
I love you, Rahul. I love you.

1380
01:29:51,941 --> 01:29:53,033
Cut.

1381
01:29:53,209 --> 01:29:55,177
Simply superb,
Ms. Reena. Brilliant.

1382
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:56,943
Very good. Well done.

1383
01:29:58,248 --> 01:29:59,272
Thank you, sir.

1384
01:30:00,183 --> 01:30:02,048
So, by when will you let me know?

1385
01:30:02,485 --> 01:30:05,113
Mr. Premraj has returned
from Switzerland in the morning.

1386
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:07,616
Very soon he will see
your audition tapes.

1387
01:30:07,724 --> 01:30:10,022
And I am sure he will
call you in two day's time.

1388
01:30:10,593 --> 01:30:12,584
You were very good in
the audition, Ms. Reena.

1389
01:30:12,996 --> 01:30:14,361
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1390
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:24,097
Hello.

1391
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:26,404
Mamma.
- Reena, my child, where are you?

1392
01:30:27,077 --> 01:30:28,374
We are so worried about you.

1393
01:30:28,445 --> 01:30:29,605
It has been four days.

1394
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,112
Are you alright, dear?

1395
01:30:32,348 --> 01:30:35,317
We are in a remote cottage
where there are no phones.

1396
01:30:35,552 --> 01:30:37,520
And the signal is very weak as well.

1397
01:30:37,587 --> 01:30:39,111
I am absolutely fine, mamma.

1398
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:42,321
Mamma, cameraman has returned
from Paris after two days.

1399
01:30:42,392 --> 01:30:43,552
That is why there was a delay.

1400
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:46,062
I am coming back after two days.

1401
01:30:48,098 --> 01:30:50,931
Talk to your father.
He is very angry with you.

1402
01:30:51,101 --> 01:30:52,159
Here, talk to her.

1403
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:55,529
Hello. Where are you?

1404
01:30:59,275 --> 01:31:01,243
We have to make the
wedding preparations.

1405
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:02,676
Where are you?
In which hotel are you staying?

1406
01:31:02,946 --> 01:31:04,174
We are coming to take you.

1407
01:31:07,684 --> 01:31:09,549
We are coming to Delhi to take you.

1408
01:31:09,619 --> 01:31:11,246
In which hotel are you staying?
- Dad...

1409
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,048
Hello. Dad, I can't hear anything.

1410
01:31:14,124 --> 01:31:15,489
Hello. Yeah, I can hear you.

1411
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:17,219
Dad, the connection is very bad.

1412
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:20,290
Hello.
- Dear, I can hear you.

1413
01:31:20,463 --> 01:31:22,590
Dad, I can't hear you.
I'll call you back in two days.

1414
01:31:22,665 --> 01:31:23,962
Hello.

1415
01:31:30,206 --> 01:31:31,571
Reena, how long will it take?

1416
01:31:33,543 --> 01:31:34,737
Two minutes.

1417
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:36,238
I just need to wear the dress.

1418
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,672
Where are we going?

1419
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,582
Yeah, Rahul.
- As usual.

1420
01:31:53,963 --> 01:31:55,157
Yeah, I am listening.

1421
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,469
Right. Okay.

1422
01:32:01,437 --> 01:32:02,597
You just go out.

1423
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:04,233
What?
- Out of the room.

1424
01:32:08,077 --> 01:32:11,342
We found out that no one renewed
the operating permits.

1425
01:32:12,182 --> 01:32:14,309
We can renew those
operating permits.

1426
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:19,248
And you know, Akash, we can have
those smelters operational again.

1427
01:32:19,956 --> 01:32:21,048
That's good news, Rahul.

1428
01:32:21,257 --> 01:32:23,054
Just keep it confidential. Okay?

1429
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:26,552
Okay. Let's talk later.

1430
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:31,258
How do I look?

1431
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,261
But there is something missing.

1432
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,366
I am not looking good?

1433
01:32:39,242 --> 01:32:40,436
Just a minute.

1434
01:32:51,654 --> 01:32:52,951
This is for me?

1435
01:32:53,256 --> 01:32:54,348
How did you like it?

1436
01:32:56,492 --> 01:32:58,460
Lets mind blowing, Akash.

1437
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:01,095
Give it to me.
I will help you put it on.

1438
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,168
Now you look perfect.

1439
01:33:16,379 --> 01:33:17,539
It's beautiful.

1440
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:19,339
Not more beautiful
than you though, my dear.

1441
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:22,075
I love it.

1442
01:33:23,486 --> 01:33:25,420
I am yearning to hear these words.

1443
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:28,113
I guess the necklace
is luckier than me.

1444
01:33:53,116 --> 01:33:55,175
You know Reena.
You're going to have the best act.

1445
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:56,312
All my friends are
going to be shocked.

1446
01:33:58,187 --> 01:33:59,313
What a perfect couple.

1447
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:01,948
Good afternoon, Mr. Gupta.

1448
01:34:02,025 --> 01:34:04,152
We have light winds,
clear visibility.

1449
01:34:04,227 --> 01:34:07,094
We expect to touch
down in Goa in 30 minutes.

1450
01:34:07,163 --> 01:34:08,323
Welcome aboard, Ms. Reena.

1451
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:09,592
Would you need anything else,
ma'am?

1452
01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:11,361
No, that's it. Thank you.

1453
01:34:14,304 --> 01:34:17,330
Akash, why are we going to Goa?

1454
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:20,570
We have to attend two parties.

1455
01:34:21,577 --> 01:34:24,102
First we have to go
for an inauguration...

1456
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,375
...and after that we have
to go to my friend's party.

1457
01:34:26,716 --> 01:34:28,013
Which friend?

1458
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:29,483
You ask too many questions.

1459
01:34:30,353 --> 01:34:31,615
I can't ask them?

1460
01:34:32,588 --> 01:34:33,680
You can.

1461
01:34:34,123 --> 01:34:35,420
His name is Ambani.

1462
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:37,618
Wow.

1463
01:34:37,894 --> 01:34:39,361
You know Mr. Ambani?

1464
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:43,428
No, I am just going
to crash his party.

1465
01:35:00,149 --> 01:35:02,379
It was really nice.
We had a great time.

1466
01:35:03,252 --> 01:35:04,480
I really didn't see that.

1467
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,252
Nice party.

1468
01:35:15,164 --> 01:35:17,029
How are you? Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1469
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,159
Commissioner. Good to see you.

1470
01:35:20,336 --> 01:35:21,633
I knew it. I knew it.

1471
01:35:22,105 --> 01:35:23,163
Mr. Gupta.

1472
01:35:23,239 --> 01:35:25,002
Ambani, how you doing.

1473
01:35:25,074 --> 01:35:26,302
Good. Finally made it.

1474
01:35:26,376 --> 01:35:27,968
Man, looks like a nice party.

1475
01:35:28,077 --> 01:35:29,203
So, how's business?

1476
01:35:31,047 --> 01:35:32,173
...I won't be able to handle it.

1477
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:35,875
Okay. Listen, when
are we playing golf?

1478
01:35:35,952 --> 01:35:38,079
I don't have any time in this trip.

1479
01:35:38,254 --> 01:35:39,346
This is what you always say.

1480
01:35:39,622 --> 01:35:42,284
You know what? I think you
are afraid to play with me.

1481
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:44,493
I think you know I'm going
to beat you next time. Right?

1482
01:35:45,128 --> 01:35:47,426
Well, in that case we are
playing next time. 100 percent.

1483
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:49,624
Alright.
- Oh, by the way. I am sorry.

1484
01:35:49,899 --> 01:35:51,389
This is Reena. She's an actress.

1485
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:52,593
Hello, Mr. Ambani. How are you?

1486
01:35:52,668 --> 01:35:54,568
Nice to meet you, Ms. Reena.
- Come on, let's go get a drink.

1487
01:35:54,637 --> 01:35:56,002
Let's go.

1488
01:35:58,474 --> 01:36:00,237
Let's get the drinks.
- Your drink, sir.

1489
01:36:00,576 --> 01:36:02,908
Thank you.
- Ms. Reena. - Thank you.

1490
01:36:02,979 --> 01:36:04,105
Sir.
- Thank you.

1491
01:36:04,247 --> 01:36:05,305
Let's do cheers here.
- By the way...

1492
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:06,609
Ambani. Yes. Cheers.
- Yeah.

1493
01:36:06,682 --> 01:36:09,412
And congratulations to you on
acquiring Obertus hotel group.

1494
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:10,975
I heard you got a good deal.

1495
01:36:11,053 --> 01:36:13,487
Listen, we were lucky.
The timing was good.

1496
01:36:13,689 --> 01:36:15,020
Just like your Elite deal.

1497
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:17,485
By the way, is my job done?

1498
01:36:17,994 --> 01:36:19,484
Yes. Roop Kumar is here.

1499
01:36:19,562 --> 01:36:22,053
He is ready to start.
- Roop Kumar is here!

1500
01:36:22,265 --> 01:36:24,495
Yes. Of course.
- Oh my God!

1501
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:26,297
Akash called me
specifically insisting...

1502
01:36:26,335 --> 01:36:28,166
...that Roop Kumar should
be called for this party.

1503
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:30,335
You know he is my favourite.

1504
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,335
You know, I thought so much.

1505
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:35,033
Ms. Reena, I know
Akash for a long time.

1506
01:36:35,378 --> 01:36:38,506
I never saw him taking interest in
anything else other than business.

1507
01:36:39,348 --> 01:36:40,975
You must be someone very special.

1508
01:36:41,617 --> 01:36:43,482
Listen, I'll see you guys. Okay?

1509
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:44,950
Cheers.

1510
01:36:47,657 --> 01:36:50,057
Really? You did it for me?

1511
01:36:50,993 --> 01:36:52,085
It was nothing.

1512
01:36:53,463 --> 01:36:55,328
Now will you keep standing
here or should we make a move?

1513
01:36:58,901 --> 01:37:01,301
Hello. Greetings. Salutations.

1514
01:37:01,537 --> 01:37:04,097
Before I start today's program...

1515
01:37:04,373 --> 01:37:08,571
...I would like to thank
my dear friend Akash Gupta.

1516
01:37:09,245 --> 01:37:13,181
He invited me here
to make this evening memorable.

1517
01:37:13,683 --> 01:37:15,014
Thank you, Akash.

1518
01:37:16,519 --> 01:37:19,579
I wish to dedicate the
first song for the evening...

1519
01:37:20,656 --> 01:37:24,683
...for a very special guest here.

1520
01:37:24,961 --> 01:37:29,625
She is here
and I dedicate this song to her.

1521
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:33,260
I present it to her.
Her name is Reena Mehta.

1522
01:37:36,572 --> 01:37:42,977
"The intoxication
your eyes possess..."

1523
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:50,212
"...is not there in alcohol."

1524
01:37:51,587 --> 01:37:57,526
"The freshness your
beauty possesses...

1525
01:37:58,594 --> 01:38:05,193
"...is not there in a rose."

1526
01:38:05,434 --> 01:38:12,602
"The poetry your body creates..."

1527
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:20,276
"...is not there in any book."

1528
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:25,048
"May your beauty last forever."

1529
01:38:25,121 --> 01:38:28,613
"May you always be
generous towards me."

1530
01:38:28,724 --> 01:38:34,390
"May my love live forever."

1531
01:38:40,136 --> 01:38:42,627
"I pray to God."

1532
01:38:43,539 --> 01:38:47,441
"I pray to God."

1533
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:50,240
"I pray to God."

1534
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,148
"I pray to God."

1535
01:38:55,217 --> 01:38:57,708
"I pray to God."

1536
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:02,455
"I pray to God."

1537
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,356
"I pray to God."

1538
01:40:18,668 --> 01:40:24,368
"I cannot stay away from you."

1539
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:30,003
"I cannot tell you
how much I love you."

1540
01:40:30,046 --> 01:40:32,708
"You are my heart.
You are my heartbeat."

1541
01:40:32,982 --> 01:40:35,678
"You are my breath.
You are my life."

1542
01:40:36,285 --> 01:40:40,381
"All my desires are linked to you."

1543
01:40:40,456 --> 01:40:43,289
"You are my life."

1544
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:46,294
"You are my life."

1545
01:40:46,362 --> 01:40:49,229
"You are my life."

1546
01:40:49,298 --> 01:40:52,199
"You are my life."

1547
01:40:52,234 --> 01:40:54,566
"You are my life."

1548
01:40:54,637 --> 01:40:58,095
"You are my life."

1549
01:40:58,174 --> 01:41:01,041
"You are my life."

1550
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:04,568
"You are my life."

1551
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:34,371
"When I look at you,
I cannot stop staring."

1552
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:40,207
"When I think about you,
I cannot stop thinking about you."

1553
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:46,355
"I can live and die for your love."

1554
01:41:46,422 --> 01:41:51,519
"I am drowning in your eyes."

1555
01:41:51,961 --> 01:41:54,657
"You are my world.
You are my heaven."

1556
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:57,922
"You are my dream.
You are my prayer."

1557
01:42:02,404 --> 01:42:05,339
"You are my life."

1558
01:42:05,407 --> 01:42:08,342
"You are my life."

1559
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:11,277
"You are my life."

1560
01:42:11,347 --> 01:42:14,145
"You are my life."

1561
01:42:14,216 --> 01:42:17,083
"You are my life."

1562
01:42:17,153 --> 01:42:20,145
"You are my life."

1563
01:42:20,222 --> 01:42:23,089
"You are my life."

1564
01:42:23,259 --> 01:42:27,093
"You are my life."

1565
01:43:01,664 --> 01:43:05,327
Yeah, Rahul.
- Akash, I spoke to Raj Vanjani.

1566
01:43:06,068 --> 01:43:07,558
He wants to meet you in your hotel.

1567
01:43:08,137 --> 01:43:10,935
Right now.
- Why? - I don't know that.

1568
01:43:11,207 --> 01:43:13,971
But I think he is ready to give in.

1569
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,570
I think we have got him.

1570
01:43:16,412 --> 01:43:18,505
Okay. Give me half an hour.

1571
01:43:19,215 --> 01:43:20,477
I am sending Ravi over to you.

1572
01:43:20,683 --> 01:43:22,173
I have some work in the office.
I will see you later.

1573
01:43:22,351 --> 01:43:23,409
Okay?

1574
01:43:23,485 --> 01:43:24,713
Okay. See you.

1575
01:43:47,042 --> 01:43:48,509
Today is Wednesday.

1576
01:43:49,645 --> 01:43:51,670
This beautiful time just flew by.

1577
01:43:52,615 --> 01:43:55,448
It's not over as yet.
It has just started.

1578
01:43:56,518 --> 01:43:58,645
But, Reena, my job is done.

1579
01:43:59,188 --> 01:44:00,655
I have to go back to
New York tomorrow.

1580
01:44:05,394 --> 01:44:07,954
But I will come back soon,
to meet you.

1581
01:44:08,597 --> 01:44:09,996
You will meet me, won't you?

1582
01:44:13,936 --> 01:44:16,427
Reena. You will meet me, won't you?

1583
01:44:17,673 --> 01:44:19,402
I have to go back to Chandigarh.

1584
01:44:25,514 --> 01:44:26,640
Why?

1585
01:44:27,549 --> 01:44:29,039
Stay in Mumbai.

1586
01:44:29,551 --> 01:44:30,347
I will buy a nice flat for you.

1587
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,480
And a car as well.

1588
01:44:33,222 --> 01:44:34,621
You won't lack for anything.

1589
01:44:36,325 --> 01:44:38,316
You can continue your
film's work here, in Mumbai...

1590
01:44:38,394 --> 01:44:40,328
...and I will keep visiting you.

1591
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,030
You come to meet me when
you'll have a fight with Donna?

1592
01:44:50,539 --> 01:44:52,166
It is not so.

1593
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:57,638
I really like your company.

1594
01:45:04,286 --> 01:45:05,480
Why can't you?

1595
01:45:06,622 --> 01:45:08,317
I have a lot of constrains.

1596
01:45:10,259 --> 01:45:13,490
Reena, I want your friendship.

1597
01:45:14,964 --> 01:45:16,329
I don't want this
kind of friendship.

1598
01:45:21,503 --> 01:45:22,595
Reena...

1599
01:45:22,972 --> 01:45:24,064
Then what do you want?

1600
01:45:24,573 --> 01:45:25,665
I don't want anything.

1601
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:27,408
I don't want anything, Akash.

1602
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:29,268
Reena...

1603
01:45:32,982 --> 01:45:34,711
I cannot give you what you want.

1604
01:45:35,284 --> 01:45:37,013
I have to go back to New York.

1605
01:45:37,086 --> 01:45:38,178
I have such a big business.

1606
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,953
I have a girlfriend over there.

1607
01:45:44,994 --> 01:45:46,086
Reena, I...

1608
01:45:46,462 --> 01:45:50,330
Anyway, I am not ready for any
kind of commitment right now.

1609
01:45:51,467 --> 01:45:55,995
I forgot, Akash, that you
commit only after giving a thought.

1610
01:45:57,039 --> 01:45:59,303
Reena. Reena, that's not true.

1611
01:46:01,276 --> 01:46:03,972
I thought that there is
something special between us.

1612
01:46:04,446 --> 01:46:05,310
I too thought so.

1613
01:46:06,915 --> 01:46:10,043
But now I think there was a lot
of difference in our thinking.

1614
01:46:18,994 --> 01:46:20,086
Reena...

1615
01:46:23,432 --> 01:46:25,525
Why don't you understand?
I am helpless.

1616
01:46:27,403 --> 01:46:28,563
Akash...

1617
01:46:29,438 --> 01:46:31,406
You can do whatever you want.

1618
01:46:32,374 --> 01:46:35,571
I wish you could
understand who is helpless.

1619
01:46:37,146 --> 01:46:39,580
Anyway forget it,
you won't understand.

1620
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:09,441
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

1621
01:47:09,511 --> 01:47:10,671
Thank you.

1622
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:17,343
How are you?
- I am fine.

1623
01:47:17,953 --> 01:47:19,079
How are you?

1624
01:47:22,091 --> 01:47:24,059
Mr. Vanjani, let's get started.

1625
01:47:24,393 --> 01:47:25,985
Okay. Go ahead.

1626
01:47:27,596 --> 01:47:28,654
Sir, your file.

1627
01:47:29,665 --> 01:47:32,498
Ms. Reena. How are you?

1628
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:34,195
Hello. How are you?

1629
01:47:34,536 --> 01:47:37,437
I am fine. I just haven't
slept since the last three nights.

1630
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:45,046
Vanjani, you said that you
wanted to talk to Mr. Gupta.

1631
01:47:45,414 --> 01:47:47,575
Gupta is listening to you.
You can go ahead.

1632
01:47:47,983 --> 01:47:49,075
Okay.

1633
01:47:49,151 --> 01:47:54,714
Mr. Gupta, I accept your
acquisition proposal, but...

1634
01:47:56,125 --> 01:47:57,319
I have a request to make.

1635
01:47:57,526 --> 01:48:00,427
Sir, the question of
making a request...

1636
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,392
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1637
01:48:09,037 --> 01:48:10,231
I think it's something important.

1638
01:48:26,722 --> 01:48:28,553
Why did you do this with him?

1639
01:48:29,458 --> 01:48:30,516
This was bound to happen.

1640
01:48:31,293 --> 01:48:32,521
There was no other option.

1641
01:48:33,228 --> 01:48:35,059
When I saw him for the first time...

1642
01:48:36,965 --> 01:48:38,557
And a confident businessman.

1643
01:48:39,034 --> 01:48:41,696
And now he is a man who has lost.

1644
01:48:42,538 --> 01:48:44,563
Don't you feel pity on his state?

1645
01:48:45,641 --> 01:48:46,972
I am not concerned with his state.

1646
01:48:47,042 --> 01:48:48,373
I am only concerned
with his business.

1647
01:48:50,179 --> 01:48:53,148
Right, Akash. Only business.

1648
01:48:53,348 --> 01:48:55,578
And anyway, you are helpless.

1649
01:48:56,018 --> 01:48:59,545
You don't have the time to
understand emotions and feelings.

1650
01:49:00,455 --> 01:49:03,652
Your life and
everything else is business.

1651
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,349
I was wrong about you.

1652
01:49:07,429 --> 01:49:09,624
You are indeed stonehearted.

1653
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:21,509
Let's see.
- At 8:00pm...

1654
01:49:22,177 --> 01:49:25,271
Gentlemen, we'II...
continue this at the office.

1655
01:49:29,451 --> 01:49:31,282
'I was wrong about you. '

1656
01:49:31,453 --> 01:49:33,512
'You are indeed stonehearted. '

1657
01:49:36,191 --> 01:49:38,091
Welcome, gentlemen. Please come in.

1658
01:49:38,126 --> 01:49:39,252
Take your seats.

1659
01:49:48,036 --> 01:49:51,995
Mr. Vanjani, once all
the paperwork is done...

1660
01:49:52,307 --> 01:49:56,243
...I and Mr. Gupta will
answer all your questions.

1661
01:49:57,346 --> 01:49:59,211
I need you to sign these papers.

1662
01:49:59,448 --> 01:50:00,608
Give them to me.

1663
01:50:01,617 --> 01:50:03,016
I'll sign them.

1664
01:50:04,019 --> 01:50:07,216
Mr. Vanjani,
before you sign these papers...

1665
01:50:09,358 --> 01:50:10,552
Go ahead.

1666
01:50:11,293 --> 01:50:15,161
Mr. Vanjani,
if you get another chance...

1667
01:50:15,297 --> 01:50:16,389
...then what would you do?

1668
01:50:16,498 --> 01:50:20,025
This question has no
connection with this situation.

1669
01:50:20,102 --> 01:50:21,592
Rahul, I didn't question you.

1670
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:25,165
How did this happen?
- I don't know what...

1671
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:30,505
I... I... would make
use of that opportunity.

1672
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:36,242
Mr. Vanjani, if you find
out that your company has...

1673
01:50:36,318 --> 01:50:40,118
...some hidden assets
which you are unaware of.

1674
01:50:41,189 --> 01:50:43,054
Akash, why are you doing this?

1675
01:50:43,292 --> 01:50:46,125
Like your smelters' licenses.

1676
01:50:46,194 --> 01:50:48,287
Your abandoned shipyards.

1677
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:54,132
You know you can take a new
loan on your hidden assets?

1678
01:50:54,202 --> 01:50:55,601
Akash, why are you doing this?

1679
01:50:55,671 --> 01:50:57,161
Just a minute. Keep quiet.

1680
01:50:58,173 --> 01:50:59,538
I can take a loan on them?

1681
01:51:00,309 --> 01:51:01,571
Of course you can.

1682
01:51:03,245 --> 01:51:04,303
And...

1683
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:08,947
Knowing all this,
I don't think I can...

1684
01:51:09,017 --> 01:51:12,544
...give a logical bid to Elite.

1685
01:51:20,495 --> 01:51:22,588
I didn't win this battle, Akash.

1686
01:51:23,332 --> 01:51:24,526
You lost.

1687
01:51:26,134 --> 01:51:27,362
Maybe you are right.

1688
01:51:29,071 --> 01:51:31,266
Maybe you are right.

1689
01:51:33,742 --> 01:51:34,970
Excuse me.

1690
01:51:35,077 --> 01:51:36,977
I think it's time to go home.

1691
01:51:38,513 --> 01:51:40,913
Akash, why are you doing this?

1692
01:51:40,949 --> 01:51:42,075
Akash...

1693
01:51:43,051 --> 01:51:47,613
I want you to keep our
shares you have purchased.

1694
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:50,115
And join our board.

1695
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:52,092
It will be an honour.

1696
01:51:53,962 --> 01:51:55,293
As you wish, Mr. Vanjani.

1697
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,222
Thank you. God bless you, Akash.

1698
01:51:57,299 --> 01:51:58,459
Have a good day.

1699
01:51:58,934 --> 01:52:00,458
Good day, Gentlemen.

1700
01:52:09,378 --> 01:52:10,675
I think I'll walk, Nelson.

1701
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:07,167
Hi.

1702
01:53:07,369 --> 01:53:08,461
Hi.

1703
01:53:09,237 --> 01:53:10,363
Where were you?

1704
01:53:12,607 --> 01:53:14,336
I had gone to have 'Panipuri'.

1705
01:53:17,045 --> 01:53:20,139
I heard that you left
the Elite deal.

1706
01:53:25,987 --> 01:53:27,318
Premraj called?

1707
01:53:32,527 --> 01:53:34,119
My phone is dead.

1708
01:53:34,663 --> 01:53:37,325
And I have lost my charger as well.

1709
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,897
Okay. I will talk to him.

1710
01:53:43,338 --> 01:53:46,273
You... are leaving?

1711
01:53:46,975 --> 01:53:49,102
Yes. I am catching
the evening flight.

1712
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,972
Won't you wait for the movie?

1713
01:53:54,549 --> 01:53:56,210
I will have to go.

1714
01:53:57,052 --> 01:53:57,313
I will come back later.

1715
01:53:58,453 --> 01:54:00,011
If they call me.

1716
01:54:04,392 --> 01:54:05,916
I too am leaving tomorrow.

1717
01:54:06,428 --> 01:54:07,588
You can also leave tomorrow.

1718
01:54:07,662 --> 01:54:09,152
One day won't make a difference.

1719
01:54:10,532 --> 01:54:12,466
But now I don't feel like
staying here any longer.

1720
01:54:25,514 --> 01:54:27,141
Sir, I'm here for madam's bag.

1721
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:28,073
Reena. Reena,
why can't we be friends?

1722
01:55:30,011 --> 01:55:34,710
Akash, now we will
only be friends. Forever.

1723
01:56:33,141 --> 01:56:34,472
You? Here?

1724
01:56:35,410 --> 01:56:36,638
Hi, baby.

1725
01:56:37,278 --> 01:56:38,870
How are you?
- Hi.

1726
01:56:40,315 --> 01:56:42,112
Anyway, you didn't call me.

1727
01:56:42,651 --> 01:56:44,278
Rahul said that you
are not feeling well.

1728
01:56:47,188 --> 01:56:48,951
I thought that I'll surprise you.

1729
01:56:49,124 --> 01:56:51,285
Yes, this is indeed a surprise.

1730
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:52,451
When did you come?

1731
01:56:52,527 --> 01:56:54,518
I am coming here
directly from the airport.

1732
01:56:54,596 --> 01:56:57,030
Anyway, Rahul told me that
you left the Elite deal.

1733
01:56:57,098 --> 01:56:58,463
What is wrong with you, Akash?

1734
01:56:59,034 --> 01:57:01,400
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

1735
01:57:02,604 --> 01:57:05,539
I was actually preparing
to go back to New York.

1736
01:57:07,942 --> 01:57:10,467
I left my work and
came here to meet you...

1737
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:13,174
...and you are talking
about going back to New York?

1738
01:57:14,482 --> 01:57:17,349
I just don't feel like
staying in India any longer.

1739
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:18,916
Come on, Akash.

1740
01:57:18,987 --> 01:57:20,682
We are going to be
here for four-five days.

1741
01:57:21,056 --> 01:57:22,182
We are going to enjoy.

1742
01:57:22,424 --> 01:57:23,516
Please.

1743
01:57:25,126 --> 01:57:26,354
Come, let's go for dinner.

1744
01:57:26,528 --> 01:57:27,995
I'll go and get ready.

1745
01:57:32,434 --> 01:57:34,163
Oh God!

1746
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,066
What I...

1747
01:57:41,609 --> 01:57:42,940
Go.

1748
01:57:43,945 --> 01:57:46,140
Sir. Ms. Reena?

1749
01:57:47,649 --> 01:57:49,617
Ms. Reena's parents
were here from Chandigarh.

1750
01:57:50,185 --> 01:57:51,584
Parents?
- Yes, sir.

1751
01:57:52,187 --> 01:57:54,178
They took Ms. Reena back
to Chandigarh with them.

1752
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:57,683
They were talking
about Ms. Reena's wedding.

1753
01:57:59,227 --> 01:58:01,695
Wedding? - Yes, sir. Ms.
Reena is getting married.

1754
01:58:01,963 --> 01:58:03,260
This Saturday. In Pune.

1755
01:58:16,511 --> 01:58:17,637
Hello, stranger.

1756
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:20,138
You came back from Mumbai
and didn't even inform me.

1757
01:58:20,682 --> 01:58:22,582
How are you?
- I am fine.

1758
01:58:22,984 --> 01:58:25,111
What have you done to yourself?

1759
01:58:27,021 --> 01:58:28,750
What did you get for me from Mumbai?

1760
01:58:29,557 --> 01:58:30,387
I have brought a nice purse for you.

1761
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:33,054
And how many idols of
Lord Ganesha did you buy?

1762
01:58:33,128 --> 01:58:34,254
Seven.

1763
01:58:34,362 --> 01:58:36,956
Only seven? Why not eight?

1764
01:58:37,532 --> 01:58:38,692
I was very busy, Priya.

1765
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,326
Otherwise I would have bought it.

1766
01:58:40,602 --> 01:58:41,933
I know.

1767
01:58:42,203 --> 01:58:44,967
And what happened of
the Premraj's audition?

1768
01:58:45,673 --> 01:58:47,334
Audition went very well.

1769
01:58:48,042 --> 01:58:49,703
I perhaps would have
got selected as well.

1770
01:58:50,612 --> 01:58:54,275
But daddy doesn't want
me to work in movies.

1771
01:58:55,083 --> 01:58:57,483
He says do whatever you
want but after marriage.

1772
01:58:58,219 --> 01:59:00,210
Then what is the
problem in that, Reena?

1773
01:59:01,356 --> 01:59:03,449
I don't love Rajeev, Priya.

1774
01:59:04,526 --> 01:59:07,120
So getting married to
him is out of question.

1775
01:59:08,062 --> 01:59:09,427
It's too late now.

1776
01:59:09,597 --> 01:59:11,155
Your engagement ceremony
will take place tomorrow.

1777
01:59:11,232 --> 01:59:13,063
And you are getting married
day after tomorrow in Pune.

1778
01:59:14,435 --> 01:59:16,027
You should forget Akash now.

1779
01:59:16,538 --> 01:59:18,403
But he dwells in my heart.

1780
01:59:19,641 --> 01:59:21,131
What should I do, Priya?

1781
01:59:23,378 --> 01:59:24,640
What should I do, Priya?

1782
01:59:42,096 --> 01:59:43,188
Hi, Prem.

1783
01:59:46,534 --> 01:59:49,002
Yes, I am fine. How are you?

1784
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:50,162
Oh, that's great.

1785
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:51,330
Okay, how long do
you plan to stay here?

1786
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,204
Yes. I am here
for another three-four days.

1787
01:59:56,477 --> 01:59:58,707
Listen, Reena's
audition was wonderful.

1788
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:00,140
She got selected you know.

1789
02:00:00,415 --> 02:00:01,712
Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1790
02:00:04,552 --> 02:00:06,543
That's great. She will love it.

1791
02:00:06,721 --> 02:00:09,952
But we couldn't getting touch
with her. Where is she?

1792
02:00:10,024 --> 02:00:12,720
No, well, she is in Chandigarh.

1793
02:00:12,994 --> 02:00:15,019
Yes... yes, that is
why I couldn't reach her.

1794
02:00:16,364 --> 02:00:18,264
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

1795
02:00:18,466 --> 02:00:19,524
I'll talk to you later.

1796
02:00:19,634 --> 02:00:20,965
Bye.

1797
02:00:44,292 --> 02:00:50,026
"The sea feels like ember."

1798
02:00:50,164 --> 02:00:55,466
"The entire world looks barren."

1799
02:00:55,637 --> 02:01:01,234
"Your memories float in the air."

1800
02:01:01,309 --> 02:01:06,406
"My heart hurts."

1801
02:01:06,514 --> 02:01:10,951
"Without you, my love..."

1802
02:01:11,052 --> 02:01:14,681
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1803
02:01:15,123 --> 02:01:17,990
"Without you, my love..."

1804
02:01:18,059 --> 02:01:23,292
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1805
02:01:23,364 --> 02:01:26,356
"Without you, my love..."

1806
02:01:26,434 --> 02:01:31,701
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1807
02:01:31,973 --> 02:01:34,635
"Without you, my love..."

1808
02:01:34,709 --> 02:01:41,080
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1809
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:46,485
"My love."

1810
02:01:46,587 --> 02:01:51,320
"My love."

1811
02:02:11,579 --> 02:02:17,279
"I look for a way
to my destination."

1812
02:02:17,518 --> 02:02:22,979
"There is still some
hope in my heart."

1813
02:02:23,157 --> 02:02:28,527
"Where has love brought me?"

1814
02:02:29,063 --> 02:02:34,091
"There is Ioneliness all around."

1815
02:02:34,235 --> 02:02:42,301
"Dreams don't dwell in my
tearful eyes anymore, my love."

1816
02:02:42,477 --> 02:02:51,112
"Dreams don't dwell in my
tearful eyes anymore, my love."

1817
02:02:51,185 --> 02:02:54,052
"Without you, my love..."

1818
02:02:54,122 --> 02:02:59,355
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1819
02:02:59,527 --> 02:03:02,655
"Without you, my love..."

1820
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:08,061
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1821
02:03:08,136 --> 02:03:11,003
"Without you, my love..."

1822
02:03:11,072 --> 02:03:17,238
"I don't know why I don't
like anything without you."

1823
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:23,474
Look, dear, what
Rajeev has sent for you.

1824
02:03:23,551 --> 02:03:24,711
Isn't it beautiful?

1825
02:03:32,293 --> 02:03:33,487
What is it, dear?

1826
02:03:34,495 --> 02:03:36,122
Ever since you have
returned you are...

1827
02:03:36,964 --> 02:03:40,525
...neither talking properly
to anyone nor eating properly.

1828
02:03:41,202 --> 02:03:42,965
You always look sad.

1829
02:03:44,605 --> 02:03:47,096
Mamma, I am not in the
mood to talk to anyone.

1830
02:03:55,416 --> 02:03:56,678
With you...

1831
02:03:58,653 --> 02:04:00,086
In Mumbai...

1832
02:04:01,389 --> 02:04:02,651
Did anything happen?

1833
02:04:06,327 --> 02:04:08,989
Mamma, I love Akash.

1834
02:04:18,206 --> 02:04:19,969
Does he love you as well?

1835
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:30,246
Look dear. Akash
is very rich person.

1836
02:04:32,353 --> 02:04:34,719
The world knows about him.

1837
02:04:36,591 --> 02:04:40,584
He spoke to you a little.
He spent some time with you.

1838
02:04:41,195 --> 02:04:43,925
But that doesn't
mean that he loves you.

1839
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,432
Stop dreaming about him, dear.

1840
02:04:49,337 --> 02:04:51,271
Get him out of your heart.

1841
02:04:52,673 --> 02:04:57,167
Think about your future with Rajeev.

1842
02:04:59,447 --> 02:05:02,177
Dear, don't be disheartened.

1843
02:05:02,216 --> 02:05:05,049
Come on. Brush your hair.

1844
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,318
Rajeev will be here any moment.

1845
02:05:08,556 --> 02:05:10,046
Okay?

1846
02:05:11,025 --> 02:05:12,185
Come on.

1847
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:33,678
"My eyes only see you everywhere."

1848
02:05:34,015 --> 02:05:37,610
"I admire you."

1849
02:05:37,652 --> 02:05:40,416
"I admire you."

1850
02:05:41,355 --> 02:05:45,018
"I will break the mirror."

1851
02:05:45,092 --> 02:05:52,294
"I will adorn you in
the mirror of my eyes."

1852
02:05:52,366 --> 02:05:55,199
"I will adorn you."

1853
02:05:55,236 --> 02:05:59,002
"May your beauty last forever."

1854
02:05:59,073 --> 02:06:02,565
"May you always be generous
towards me."

1855
02:06:02,643 --> 02:06:09,378
"May my love live forever."

1856
02:06:10,218 --> 02:06:14,052
"I pray to God."

1857
02:06:14,121 --> 02:06:16,681
"I pray to God."

1858
02:06:30,705 --> 02:06:32,104
That's it.

1859
02:06:34,475 --> 02:06:37,535
Our friendship goes way back.

1860
02:06:37,612 --> 02:06:39,409
What can be better than it
turning into a relationship?

1861
02:06:40,214 --> 02:06:43,081
Now you are my relative.

1862
02:06:43,584 --> 02:06:45,245
Order for sweets.

1863
02:06:45,319 --> 02:06:46,616
I am waiting for it
since a long time.

1864
02:06:46,887 --> 02:06:48,047
What are you saying?

1865
02:06:48,122 --> 02:06:50,022
Shouldn't we order for
sweets instead of them?

1866
02:06:50,091 --> 02:06:51,217
Right.

1867
02:06:51,292 --> 02:06:53,260
It's one and the same thing.
- It's one and the same thing.

1868
02:06:54,095 --> 02:06:57,064
Hey... Rajeev is here.
- Hello, uncle.

1869
02:06:57,265 --> 02:06:58,960
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son. - Hi.

1870
02:06:59,066 --> 02:07:00,158
You are late.

1871
02:07:00,234 --> 02:07:04,466
Sorry. Actually, I got stuck
at the travel agent's place.

1872
02:07:04,538 --> 02:07:07,234
I was booking
tickets for our honeymoon.

1873
02:07:07,308 --> 02:07:09,276
Really?
- Yes. - Great.

1874
02:07:09,343 --> 02:07:11,311
Pass the food around, dear.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

1875
02:07:12,046 --> 02:07:13,138
Hi, Reena.

1876
02:07:14,649 --> 02:07:15,946
Wow.

1877
02:07:19,654 --> 02:07:21,019
You are looking sad.

1878
02:07:24,458 --> 02:07:26,426
Rajeev, I want to talk to you.

1879
02:07:27,495 --> 02:07:29,292
Talk?
- No, no, no.

1880
02:07:29,697 --> 02:07:31,096
First let me cheer you up.

1881
02:07:31,332 --> 02:07:33,323
Look, our honeymoon is set.

1882
02:07:33,401 --> 02:07:35,301
The next day of our wedding,
you and I...

1883
02:07:36,103 --> 02:07:37,365
...will leave for our honeymoon.

1884
02:07:37,672 --> 02:07:39,606
You know where all are we going?

1885
02:07:41,475 --> 02:07:42,601
Reena?

1886
02:07:44,478 --> 02:07:45,604
Yes. Here you go.

1887
02:07:45,946 --> 02:07:47,243
There is nothing left.

1888
02:07:47,948 --> 02:07:49,540
Order more food.

1889
02:07:50,117 --> 02:07:51,175
Reena?

1890
02:07:52,586 --> 02:07:54,076
Are you happy with this marriage?

1891
02:07:57,591 --> 02:07:59,149
I don't know, Rajeev.

1892
02:08:01,729 --> 02:08:05,426
Reena, you know, I love
you since we were just kids.

1893
02:08:05,666 --> 02:08:10,626
And I also know that you
love me a little, a little less.

1894
02:08:13,007 --> 02:08:15,305
...after our marriage
you will love me the same.

1895
02:08:15,509 --> 02:08:16,567
Right?

1896
02:08:19,313 --> 02:08:20,712
I love someone else.

1897
02:08:23,150 --> 02:08:24,742
And he dwells in my heart.

1898
02:08:30,291 --> 02:08:35,388
Reena, you know, I know
everything that happened in Mumbai.

1899
02:08:35,996 --> 02:08:37,987
Priya has told me everything.

1900
02:08:39,233 --> 02:08:43,101
I also know that
he doesn't love you.

1901
02:08:45,139 --> 02:08:47,630
I won't let go of you so easily.

1902
02:08:49,043 --> 02:08:51,375
Reena, I will keep you
very happy. I promise.

1903
02:08:51,445 --> 02:08:52,571
Reena...

1904
02:08:53,714 --> 02:08:55,238
You can talk later.

1905
02:08:55,549 --> 02:08:57,141
Come here. Sit with us.

1906
02:08:57,218 --> 02:08:58,310
And look, sweets are here.
- Yes, dear.

1907
02:08:58,386 --> 02:09:02,220
Yes. - Come quickly and tell us
what plans you both are making.

1908
02:09:10,064 --> 02:09:12,055
Hello.
- Hello.

1909
02:09:28,215 --> 02:09:29,682
Priya, where were you?

1910
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:31,274
Aunt, there was a lot of traffic.

1911
02:09:31,485 --> 02:09:32,577
You are so late.

1912
02:09:32,653 --> 02:09:34,644
Go and check whether Reena is
ready or not. - I'll go right away.

1913
02:09:34,722 --> 02:09:36,383
Get ready quickly.

1914
02:09:36,457 --> 02:09:37,617
We have to catch a flight
for Pune in two hours.

1915
02:09:37,691 --> 02:09:40,319
Yes. Yes. Come on, hurry up.
- Come on. Come on.

1916
02:09:41,662 --> 02:09:42,924
Reena.

1917
02:09:42,963 --> 02:09:44,988
Look what I brought for you.

1918
02:09:47,668 --> 02:09:48,930
Lord Ganesha's idol.

1919
02:09:52,173 --> 02:09:53,231
It is an auspicious sign.

1920
02:09:53,474 --> 02:09:55,305
Lord Ganesha will
make everything alright.

1921
02:09:55,376 --> 02:09:57,435
And where is your cell phone?

1922
02:09:58,145 --> 02:10:00,670
I have also brought a charger
for you cell phone.

1923
02:10:02,316 --> 02:10:05,012
Priya, what would I do without you?

1924
02:10:05,085 --> 02:10:06,677
I am not going anywhere.

1925
02:10:06,954 --> 02:10:08,512
I will always be your friend.

1926
02:10:08,589 --> 02:10:10,022
Don't worry.

1927
02:10:53,934 --> 02:10:55,060
Let me see.

1928
02:10:55,135 --> 02:10:57,160
Who knows we might have
missed calls from Akash.

1929
02:11:01,275 --> 02:11:02,537
No missed calls.

1930
02:11:06,313 --> 02:11:07,712
Don't think about anything now.

1931
02:11:08,415 --> 02:11:10,007
We have to go now.

1932
02:11:10,618 --> 02:11:11,710
Let's go.

1933
02:11:32,339 --> 02:11:34,204
'Yes, sir.
Ms. Reena is getting married. '

1934
02:11:34,275 --> 02:11:35,902
'This Saturday. In Pune. '

1935
02:11:41,248 --> 02:11:42,909
Hello.
- Hello.

1936
02:11:42,983 --> 02:11:44,109
Hello.

1937
02:11:44,451 --> 02:11:45,543
Hello.

1938
02:11:46,153 --> 02:11:47,245
How are you?

1939
02:11:51,325 --> 02:11:52,519
Hello.

1940
02:11:52,593 --> 02:11:54,959
This is wrong.
Why didn't brother come?

1941
02:11:58,933 --> 02:12:00,195
I don't know, Rahul.

1942
02:12:00,501 --> 02:12:01,695
That excitement is no longer there.

1943
02:12:02,236 --> 02:12:03,328
I think this one is too easy.

1944
02:12:04,471 --> 02:12:06,371
Akash likes the challenge.

1945
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:07,498
Exactly.

1946
02:12:08,075 --> 02:12:12,034
After losing Elite if we
don't get this ITC deal...

1947
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:13,578
...then the entire
trip will go for a loss.

1948
02:12:13,647 --> 02:12:15,274
Total waste of time.

1949
02:12:15,983 --> 02:12:17,712
We didn't lose Elite's deal, Donna.

1950
02:12:17,985 --> 02:12:19,247
I left it.

1951
02:12:21,655 --> 02:12:23,145
And I can do as I please.

1952
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:26,251
I don't need to give any
justifications to anyone.

1953
02:12:28,596 --> 02:12:30,086
You are right, Akash.

1954
02:12:30,631 --> 02:12:33,099
This company is yours.
You are this company's boss.

1955
02:12:33,534 --> 02:12:36,935
But all of us here are
thinking about your wellbeing.

1956
02:12:37,471 --> 02:12:39,268
I have been working with
you since the last ten years.

1957
02:12:39,607 --> 02:12:41,939
But in these ten years,
I have done nothing...

1958
02:12:42,176 --> 02:12:44,371
...that had caused you any loss.

1959
02:12:44,445 --> 02:12:45,605
You know that perfectly.

1960
02:12:51,218 --> 02:12:54,016
Dear... Put the
garland around his neck.

1961
02:12:57,291 --> 02:12:59,156
Come on. Go on.

1962
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:05,557
Come on, dear.

1963
02:13:09,003 --> 02:13:11,335
Congratulation.
- Congratulation.

1964
02:13:13,474 --> 02:13:14,566
Excuse me, guys.

1965
02:13:15,542 --> 02:13:18,568
Bank is sending the finance
documents for Akash's signature.

1966
02:13:19,046 --> 02:13:20,206
They are bringing them up now.

1967
02:13:20,247 --> 02:13:22,943
Get him up.
- I know you mean well, Rahul.

1968
02:13:23,484 --> 02:13:25,042
I know all of you mean well.

1969
02:13:26,954 --> 02:13:28,387
But the thing is that...

1970
02:13:28,989 --> 02:13:30,650
...now I don't
want to do such deals.

1971
02:13:32,559 --> 02:13:34,151
I don't want to take
advantage of anyone.

1972
02:13:34,228 --> 02:13:35,286
Not anymore.

1973
02:13:35,362 --> 02:13:39,298
Akash,
ITC's acquisition is almost done.

1974
02:13:39,366 --> 02:13:42,164
We will be making at least
a profit of half a billion.

1975
02:13:42,503 --> 02:13:45,939
And if we take a little
advantage of anyone then...

1976
02:13:46,006 --> 02:13:47,268
...what is the harm in it?

1977
02:13:47,341 --> 02:13:48,535
It is wrong, Donna.

1978
02:13:48,976 --> 02:13:51,171
I have enough money,
Donna. I don't need anymore.

1979
02:13:51,245 --> 02:13:53,372
What are you saying, Akash?

1980
02:13:53,914 --> 02:13:55,472
One can never have enough of money.

1981
02:13:55,649 --> 02:13:57,344
No matter how much money you earn.

1982
02:13:57,451 --> 02:13:59,510
More money brings more power.

1983
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:04,649
'Why not? '

1984
02:14:05,192 --> 02:14:08,184
'There is nothing in this
world more powerful than money. '

1985
02:14:08,228 --> 02:14:11,288
'And one can buy anything
in this world with money. '

1986
02:14:32,219 --> 02:14:34,153
It's time. Call the bride.

1987
02:14:35,255 --> 02:14:36,313
Bring her.

1988
02:14:38,625 --> 02:14:43,289
"My love."

1989
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:50,193
"My love."

1990
02:15:06,687 --> 02:15:12,387
"I under go such a shock."

1991
02:15:12,659 --> 02:15:17,926
"I neither live nor die."

1992
02:15:18,165 --> 02:15:23,569
"I am lost in your thoughts."

1993
02:15:24,071 --> 02:15:28,337
"I only breathe your name."

1994
02:15:29,376 --> 02:15:37,545
"My heart doesn't wish for anything
else from God other than you."

1995
02:15:37,618 --> 02:15:45,354
"My heart doesn't wish for anything
else from God other than you."

1996
02:15:54,234 --> 02:15:55,496
Reena's massage.

1997
02:16:13,654 --> 02:16:14,313
When we were returning from Goa.

1998
02:16:18,125 --> 02:16:19,615
'He will be my life. '

1999
02:16:20,994 --> 02:16:22,518
'Life? '
- 'Yes, my life. '

2000
02:16:22,963 --> 02:16:24,692
'The one who will love me a lot. '

2001
02:16:24,965 --> 02:16:27,229
'And the one with whom I will
spend the rest of my life. '

2002
02:16:29,236 --> 02:16:31,670
The profit that we make
from this online proposal...

2003
02:16:31,939 --> 02:16:34,100
...in the other companies, we can...

2004
02:16:39,012 --> 02:16:41,003
'You can do whatever you want. '

2005
02:16:41,648 --> 02:16:45,015
'I wish you could
understand who is helpless. '

2006
02:16:46,553 --> 02:16:53,117
'Akash, now we will only
be friends. Forever. '

2007
02:17:00,267 --> 02:17:02,531
It's time to take the
wedding vows. Please stand up.

2008
02:17:11,078 --> 02:17:13,046
It's time to take the vows.
Start walking.

2009
02:17:14,548 --> 02:17:16,243
Yes. Yes.

2010
02:17:17,084 --> 02:17:18,176
Come on.

2011
02:18:15,008 --> 02:18:16,976
That's billionaire Akash Gupta.

2012
02:18:17,044 --> 02:18:18,136
What is he doing here?

2013
02:18:41,601 --> 02:18:42,693
Reena.

2014
02:18:46,506 --> 02:18:47,700
Will you marry me?

2015
02:20:01,048 --> 02:20:06,577
"I cannot stay away from you."

2016
02:20:06,686 --> 02:20:11,350
"I cannot tell you
how much I love you."

2017
02:20:12,292 --> 02:20:15,159
"You are my heart.
You are my heartbeat."

2018
02:20:15,228 --> 02:20:18,391
"You are my breath.
You are my life."

2019
02:20:18,465 --> 02:20:22,629
"All my desires are linked to you."

2020
02:20:22,702 --> 02:20:25,535
"You are my life."

2021
02:20:25,605 --> 02:20:28,540
"You are my life."

2022
02:20:28,608 --> 02:20:31,577
"You are my life."

2023
02:20:31,645 --> 02:20:34,409
"You are my life."

2024
02:20:34,481 --> 02:20:37,075
"You are my life."

2025
02:20:37,150 --> 02:20:40,313
"You are my life."

2026
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:43,318
"You are my life."

2027
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:47,087
"You are my life."

2028
02:21:11,084 --> 02:21:16,545
"When I look at you,
I cannot stop staring."

2029
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:22,426
"When I think about you,
I cannot stop thinking about you."

2030
02:21:22,729 --> 02:21:28,429
"I can live and die for your love."

2031
02:21:28,635 --> 02:21:33,698
"I am drowning in your eyes."

2032
02:21:34,174 --> 02:21:37,007
"You are my world.
You are my heaven."

2033
02:21:37,077 --> 02:21:40,308
"You are my dream.
You are my desire."

2034
02:21:40,447 --> 02:21:44,543
"You are my dream world."

2035
02:21:44,618 --> 02:21:47,587
"You are my life."

2036
02:21:47,654 --> 02:21:50,521
"You are my life."

2037
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:53,582
"You are my life."

2038
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:56,424
"You are my life."

2039
02:21:56,496 --> 02:21:59,124
"You are my life."

2040
02:21:59,199 --> 02:22:02,362
"You are my life."

2041
02:22:02,435 --> 02:22:05,404
"You are my life."

2042
02:22:05,472 --> 02:22:09,306
"You are my life."
