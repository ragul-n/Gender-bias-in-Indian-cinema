1
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,694
The Hawk swooped on the
prey and carried it away..

2
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,755
Story sounds believable,
but you don't like to hear it..

3
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,228
The prey then attacked the hawk.

4
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,434
..sounds unbelievable,
but is so pleasing to hear..

5
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,497
A shocking news story,
your heart will skip a beat!

6
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,270
...a story you'll refuse to believe!

7
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,744
The common man will be
forced to ask.

8
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,248
...when 'they' themselves aren't safe,
what is to happen of us'?

9
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:04,415
When he couldn't protect his own home,
hovv then will he protect our homes?

10
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,987
The biggest news-story today!

11
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,617
'Vvhen'? 'Vvhere'? 'Vvhy'?
'l-low?' ..they won't tell...

12
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,293
But this news is certain that.

13
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,233
The Home Minister's
son has been kidnapped.

14
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,232
What!

15
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,628
Watch where you're going!

16
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,539
L-low can anyone just kidnap
the Home Minister's son'?

17
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,511
They're simply spreading rumors.
- What happened?

18
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,277
Swatantra TV is going
to get in trouble with the Cops.

19
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,085
Yes, yes...
It was on a Hindi News Channel.

20
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,316
Dad! Stop it! It can't be true.

21
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,684
You barely understand Hindi.

22
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,191
What if this is a rumour?

23
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,282
A big news story
coming up from Bihaﬁs...

24
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,413
...a big news story
coming up from Mumbai!

25
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,424
A section of the Metro
over-bridge has collapsed.

26
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,156
News of 'Farmer Suicides' are now coming
in from different parts of the country..

27
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,594
'Progress' is nowhere in sight.
Nothing is getting accomplished.

28
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,198
All one hears is 'Scandals
on the News. nothing else to show!

29
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,033
Corruption in India has to stop.

30
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:34,202
It has been going on for too long, and now with
the growing economy, the amount is bigger.

31
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,044
Until and unless someone takes an
initiative, nothing can be done about it.

32
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,051
What can the ordinary people do?
They'll have to bear the five year tenure...

33
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,485
'They' will decide for us
whether the times are good or ugly..

34
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,647
More than twenty-eight
people lost their lives in the.

35
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,283
..bridge collapse across
the Chambal River in Rajasthan.

36
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,452
Six people are dead.

37
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,790
Twelve people have lost their lives.

38
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,657
This terrible tragedy
was a result of negligence...

39
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,324
There is definitely
a lapse somewhere...

40
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,700
Long live the revolution!

41
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,705
We want Justice!

42
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:06,206
There is no help from IVICT...
Some lives can be saved here!

43
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:09,247
The Government is silent. Everything
they are looting! I mean this is high time!

44
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,374
They fill their pockets
up by hiking Diesel-Petrol prices.

45
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,009
The poor get poorer..

46
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,452
But the Government does nothing
to fill the pockets of the poor.

47
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:22,653
Prices of vegetables are so unreasonable,
can't really choose what to cook.

48
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,061
We could survive plainly on Water,
but the taps are running dry too!

49
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,398
The Puppeteer.

50
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,545
Jaya.

51
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,753
Someone will enter
and see you like this.

52
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,030
My tears will violate
your protocol. ls it?

53
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,291
No Prashant! Not this time.

54
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,592
I want my son!

55
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,430
He is my son too, Jaya.

56
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,131
Fine then bring him back to me.

57
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,734
If we were under no threat,
then where is Rohan?

58
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,014
I kept telling you let us
send him to London, at my sister's.

59
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,104
But you wouldn't listen.

60
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,450
It would have ruined
your Socialist image.

61
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:23,352
I have got Nachiket on this, okay.
- Yeah, sure!

62
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,453
He will be here any -

63
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,022
Where the hell is Nachiket?

64
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,733
They had me handle the party,
when I was to become a Minister.

65
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,042
Now they want me
to handle the Minister too.

66
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,539
Where is Nachiket?

67
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,106
Home Minister is meeting him first.

68
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,321
That's the NIA Chief, Raghuvaran.

69
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,185
That's Director of IB, Bakshi.

70
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,121
And what's the RAW chief's name?
Some Singh?

71
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,022
Shivender.

72
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,119
Hello, Mr. Shivender Singh.
- Hello, sir.

73
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,720
Please sit down.

74
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,090
Please, sir.

75
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,063
Sir you first.

76
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,966
Mr. Nimbalkan.

77
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:17,475
Such an important case to the CBI?
To a Joint-Director ranked officer?

78
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,010
And Nachiket is a lot junior to us.

79
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,240
It's a collective responsibility,
why not a collective decision?

80
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,415
<i>Paw!-?</i>

81
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,742
We need a party loyalist right now.

82
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,421
Nachiket is very competent.

83
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:38,254
As a cop he knew all the
kidnapper gangs in his region.

84
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:41,398
In the Court he would address
these thugs by their first name.

85
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,433
In politics, election ticket
is given on the basis of Caste,

86
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,061
while a case, on the basis of Stature.

87
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,267
He will be the team-leader.

88
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:54,675
And he will find out who
kidnapped Rohan, why and where to.

89
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,621
Cheeku.
- Hmm!

90
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,189
It isn't time yet.

91
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,096
Uncle, chicken momo.

92
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:44,783
Phoenix is sleeping.

93
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,148
Phoenix is stationary and safe.

94
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,658
Zero hundred hours,
Phoenix is stationary, safe.

95
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,795
First inspection, midnight.

96
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,263
Get up.

97
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,364
Phoenix is sleeping.

98
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,765
We've got to return before 4:00 am.

99
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,735
Not from here, from back route!

100
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,764
Quick! Run!

101
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,370
Here take this uncle.

102
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,606
Spidi wait for me!

103
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,044
Do cops ask for your license?

104
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,782
Of course they do.

105
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:24,184
Once you pay them off,
they stop asking for it.

106
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,567
One fried rice.

107
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,268
Where can one get a food-cart?
- Lots of places.

108
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,308
I first started on a moped.
- Why?

109
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,813
Sometimes I had to make a run for it.

110
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,655
Here, your money.

111
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,028
Spidey, momos.
- Let us go! It will be 4 o'clock soon.

112
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,731
Babulaal must be on his way.

113
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,378
Hello.

114
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,706
Four hundred hours.

115
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,476
Phoenix is stationary and safe.

116
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,611
Second inspection, sharp 4 o'clock.
Then a gap of four hours again.

117
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:39,129
I will go on my own,
but will you come to pick me up'?

118
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,602
So the kid was abducted
between 12 and 4 am.

119
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:48,737
And it is 8 am right now.

120
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,546
We've been raiding suspects in Dehradun for
the last 4 hours, but haven't found him.

121
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,415
Wasn't he under 24 hour surveillance?

122
00:12:55,475 --> 00:13:00,083
Yes but 
\/Ir. Home Minister withdrew it
after the security reforms last year.

123
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,056
There were just the two of us.

124
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,025
The School threw a tantrum.

125
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:07,155
On school authorities' advice,
security presence inside was reduced.

126
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,257
But Rohan knew both
of us were outside.

127
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,733
The other kids told us he would
sneak out by climbing over a wa

..

128
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,572
..after listening
to his stationary report.

129
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,537
That's how he earned
his nickname 'Spideyi.

130
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,404
Bur the other kids
never hinted a thing.

131
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,046
Boarding school kids have
different codes and ethics.

132
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,682
You shou
d've won over one of
them to keep an eye on Rohan.

133
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,074
Idiots!

134
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,614
They will never use their brains.

135
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,713
People learn after it is over.

136
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:40,290
Who cou
d've predicted that Rohan
would run into his kidnappers himself.

137
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,110
Spidey! Spidey! l-lousie! l-lousie!
Do you Know... Do you Know..

138
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,580
Into 2... Speak up.

139
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,348
Into 2...

140
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,456
Into 2...

141
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,627
Into 2...

142
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,559
Into 2 meaning...
- Spidi...

143
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,064
you are repeating everything twice...
- Spidi things are spinning around...

144
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:56,802
Twice... twice...
- Spidi...

145
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,116
Hello!

146
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,284
Black Day.. Command come in!

147
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,691
Command come in! Black Day!

148
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,390
Did you inform his security outside?

149
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,432
Two kids are missing, sir.

150
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,232
Rohan!

151
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,499
Rohan!

152
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,733
Rohan!

153
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,742
He isn't here, sir!

154
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,179
Rohan!

155
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,088
He has been drugged.

156
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,787
But he should be fine. I will visit
again in half an hour.

157
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,425
What is the status of the Army?

158
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,661
All our units are on standby.

159
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,995
We will cover from Dehradun Cantonment
to 
\/Iodi Nagar and Saharanpur.

160
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,706
No, sir. I don't think
we should deploy the army.

161
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,738
Why not Nachiket?

162
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,337
Only the Army is competent.

163
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,677
Excuse me sir, can l?

164
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,317
Your units will cover these areas.

165
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,255
..and triangulate the kidnappers here. Correct?
- Absolutely, officer.

166
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,587
Kidnappers will realize
that they are trapped.

167
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,186
..their stakes are too high.

168
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,528
And pardon me for
what I am about to say.

169
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,999
They will panic.

170
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,629
...slash the boy's throat
and disappear in the crowd.

171
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,139
And we will never know their faces.

172
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:47,106
Cheeku! Where are you?

173
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,449
Cheekuu!

174
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,546
Cheekuu!

175
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,423
Cheekuuu!

176
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,685
Cheekuuu!

177
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,786
Listen.. You will hurt yourself!

178
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,530
Cheeku!

179
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,429
Cheeku, sky is falling.

180
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,064
Be careful.

181
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:16,176
What do you want?
- Cheeku be careful!

182
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,742
Are you hungry'?

183
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,684
We should keep the units on standby,
but not deploy them.

184
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,461
We should search the kid..

185
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,499
..
ike he is an ordinary
business man's son..

186
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,690
..and not the Home Minister's.

187
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,594
So that's your strategy?

188
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,434
I am sorry, sir.

189
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,504
But there is no strategy yet.

190
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,510
We need half an hour to
absorb and filter the information.

191
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:50,737
The basis on which to act
will decide our strategy.

192
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,083
We will need to setup a central command
office right here at your residence.

193
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,250
Not at the North block.

194
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,048
We may have information
leaks from there.

195
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:01,021
I will need a team,
which I will personally handpick.

196
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,327
Whatever needs to be done,
we'll need to do it together.

197
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,555
Exactly!

198
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,334
Nachiket, I am giving you a free hand.

199
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,736
I want Rohan. I am not interested
in inter-agency politics.

200
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,034
Thank you, Mr. Home Minster.

201
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,702
It is better if the decisions
are made by one person.

202
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,014
But we can decide on a
strategy to find Rohan together.

203
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,452
That is, if he is still in captivity.

204
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,352
This is the Jungle Your Highness.

205
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,422
You have been running
in circles for half an hour.

206
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,993
Did you ever get off your car
to walk this long?

207
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,392
You will tire yourself!
Come along.

208
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,271
Morning.

209
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,273
He

o..

210
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,704
Anything yet?
- No, sir.

211
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,414
Status?
- All the units are on standby, sir.

212
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,743
He is a terrorist.

213
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,283
..that is why there
is no ransom call yet.

214
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,491
Who would dare make a ransom
call to the Home Minister?

215
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,091
Who is dealing with the opposition?
- 
\/Ir. Nimbalkar.

216
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:49,088
Mr. Jogi... you can make
an issue out of this saying..

217
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,998
He couldn't protect his son,
hovv will he protect the country.

218
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,000
But we are all vulnerable in a crisis.

219
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,631
Right now we are very
disturbed and sensitive.

220
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,035
So avoid raising this issue.

221
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,706
Else you know how low
we could stoop.

222
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,173
You do, don't you?

223
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,506
'Long live India'.

224
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,446
Jogi has been tackled.
- Very good sir.

225
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,181
Who is handling the media boses?
- 
\/Ir. Ramasvvamy.

226
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,745
In the interest of the Nation.

227
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,319
Neither confirm the news
nor state that it's a rumour..

228
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,487
The Home Minister was never under
any terrorist threat.

229
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:24,327
Still ask him to speak to
the PM of Pakistan for any chatter..

230
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,194
..from his so called non-state actors.

231
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,270
This is not how terrorists operate.

232
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,607
They would have stormed the
school and abducted the kid.

233
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,336
Shock and awe.

234
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,379
They are hungry for publicity.

235
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,508
Could it be some political riva
..
- No ways!

236
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,641
Dogs don't eat dogs.
- Right!

237
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,248
That Dog! V\/hom the boy was licking.

238
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,450
What about the dog?

239
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,288
No, the boy.
- Make up your mind, boy or dog?

240
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,090
Maybe the kidnapper came
to abduct the other boy!

241
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,458
Mistaken identity!

242
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,495
You are making a mistake.

243
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,591
You have no idea who I am.

244
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,061
You had probably
come to abduct Cheeku.

245
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,033
Even an eight year old
knows what 'Power' is.

246
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,167
Who should, or should not
be kidnapped.

247
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,605
Do you know who I am?

248
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,340
I know who you are.

249
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:14,075
You are the Prince, aren't you?

250
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,254
You bloody kidnapper!

251
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,426
I still have Cheeku with me.

252
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:29,426
Look.

253
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,269
My men are holding him captive.
One phone call and they will kill him.

254
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,274
"Please Spidey, save me!"

255
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,608
"Save me Spidey!"

256
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,443
"Save me Spidey!"

257
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,442
Now cooperate for
the sake of your friend.

258
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,115
Or I will take you back to the School.

259
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,312
Should I take you
back to the School?

260
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,388
Come, I will take you
back to the School!

261
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,682
What do you want?

262
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,423
I will handle my demands.
You just cooperate.

263
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,554
Okay now, go to sleep.

264
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,304
You won't do anything to me, right?

265
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:20,176
Good touch - bad touch!
I know those things. I am not a kid.

266
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,077
What did you say?

267
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,552
Good touch - bad touch..

268
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,215
Quiet! Where did you learn all this’?

269
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,286
We never thought of
such things at your age.

270
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,687
I am more embarrassed
than you are!

271
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,259
Imagine who is feeling embarrassed.

272
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,730
Didn't you feel any
embarrassment while kidnapping me?

273
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:42,297
You better not be sleeping
anywhere near me at night!

274
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,196
Q Kay-

275
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,539
We have been circulating
Rohan's picture in the Police.

276
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,547
Should we distribute some
amongst our party-workers?

277
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,344
Have you guys lost it?

278
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,614
Didn't I tell you... No overt
arrangements, no Red Alert, no Press!

279
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,044
If the kidnappers panic,
the boy will lose his life.

280
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,323
We will lay the trap smoothly.

281
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,460
You mentioned they might
have abducted him by mistake.

282
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,590
They will let him
go when they realize it.

283
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,067
Do you think they made a mistake?

284
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,770
It is best that they did.

285
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,630
People forgive when
their kids are abducted.

286
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,471
They take it to be
their fate and endure it.

287
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,170
But if they find out that
the Home Minister's son is abducted.

288
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,780
...they will take it to
be a law and order failure.

289
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,243
People don't expect Rulers
to have commoner's fate.

290
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,049
They will stop respecting
the Government.

291
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,238
ls that an lpad Air?

292
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,173
I thought it wasn't launched here.

293
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,404
When people buy things before you,
bad times are around the corner.

294
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,479
For whom?
- For your kind.

295
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,117
Anything to eat?
- Why didn't you spare any?

296
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,421
I kept telling you all morning.

297
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,292
You will get to eat when we leave.

298
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,100
When will we leave?

299
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,441
Soon.

300
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:32,407
Had you been someone e
se's son
we could have stayed here for days.

301
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:37,714
But like you said,
you are the Home Minister's son.

302
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,450
So we will have to leave soon.

303
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,054
I understand sarcasm very well.

304
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:46,223
Don't talk to me that way.
I don't like it.

305
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,791
You thank your God
that I am simply talking.

306
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,231
I am surprised at myself
that I am just talking.

307
00:24:55,728 --> 00:25:02,509
If I were to really go ahead and do
what I am itching to do your highness...

308
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,678
Okay fine.

309
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,177
I was just.

310
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,514
Don't say a word right now,
be quiet for sometime.

311
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,714
This childish tone hurts me... here.

312
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,757
Pierces me here.

313
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,283

..
- Shut up!

314
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,428
Not a word.

315
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,726
Not a single word. Quiet!

316
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,087
Sir he had long hair..

317
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,224
He was very vveird..

318
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,496
He was going to setup a cart.

319
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,270
Do you remember
anything else about him?

320
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:46,542
Any other features.

321
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,211
Maybe a cut on his face.

322
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,150
Yes, sir. He used to limp.

323
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,684
Maybe he had polio.

324
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,781
Sir, sketch.

325
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,203
Hide the photo,
someone might see it.

326
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,639
Who is he anyways?

327
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,234
I was making a fast buck out there.

328
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,446
We are uselessly posted here.

329
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,514
Kidnappers don't take
their captives to bus stands.

330
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,506
Don't even think about it?
- About what?

331
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,482
Think about Cheeku before
doing anything stupid.

332
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:59,656
Look... - One phone call
to my men and Cheeku will...

333
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,948
Look, you're still alive.

334
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:07,263
If you try to run, I will shoot
the police first and then you.

335
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,126
And then I will press this
button and jump in the crowd.

336
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,100
Everyone will be blown to bits.

337
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,303
You are a suicide bomber?

338
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,497
Only in an emergency. Come along.

339
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:22,205
Only Swatantra TV managed this CCTV footage
from Dehradun's Champion School.

340
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,076
Because only we show you the truth.

341
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,444
The naked truth.

342
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,176
If everything is fine..

343
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,484
..then what was the Joint-Director
of OBI, Nachiket Verma looking for?

344
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,582
He was looking for Rohan.
Our News is verified.

345
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,456
The Nation is being kept in the dark.

346
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,460
The only one who dares
to speak is Swatantra TV.

347
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:44,193
Ramasvvamy,
why wasn't Swatantra TV stopped?

348
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,266
L-low did Sanjay Jagtap find out'?
Put pressure on him.

349
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:01,414
Let the kid sit on your lap.
- I am not a kid.

350
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,575
Son, move on to your dad's lap.

351
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,484
I have paid for the full seat.

352
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,215
But...
- Please go away!

353
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,552
Do I look like a beggar?

354
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,094
Then stop begging-

355
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,556
He said he is not a kid.

356
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,565
I have always bought a full ticket
for my child. I meant for Him..

357
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,065
Him..

358
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,961
Okay fine.

359
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:24,504
Him..

360
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,241
Mostly checking farmhouses
in and around Dehradun.

361
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,750
We searched for known gangsters,
suspects and their hideouts.

362
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,280
..but we haven't found anything.

363
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,081
Keep trying, I want hourly updates.

364
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,019
No one goes off to sleep, understand.

365
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,023
Or they can collect their resignations
from the Home Minister's residence.

366
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:47,157
Yes Arshad.
- He is all alone, he can't go too far.

367
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:51,267
Saharanpur, 
\/Iodi Nagar, Ivleerut.
We're checking everywhere.

368
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,769
Have you seen this man anywhere?

369
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,288
Nothing so far.

370
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,389
Did anyone say anything
in the interrogation?

371
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:21,556
L-low can we be certain
the man was alone'?

372
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,691
Let's say one of them abducted him..

373
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,795
..the kid could have
been passed on in a chain.

374
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,364
There can be others.

375
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,394
Then how will we catch them'?

376
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,409
The answer to your 'how' is 'why"?

377
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,213
'Why' he was abducted, will
tell us 'who' abducted him.

378
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:41,179
I too am counting on the 'Mistaken
Identity Theory' like those fools.

379
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,286
Ravi, I'll give you instructions
when the time comes.

380
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,149
Listen to me..

381
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,214
Bar-H, Ravi is also on
the conference call with us.

382
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,282
What's the matter brother?
ls Cheeku all right?

383
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,420
Everything is fine.
Cheeku is right here.

384
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,259
lam sending 1O million
in cash with Zakir.

385
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,834
If Cheeku is ever abducted from
Jalandhar or Nagpur, then pay them off.

386
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,295
Think positive.

387
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,102
Think negative for positive to happen!

388
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,367
Just hold on a second..

389
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,035
I am getting a call,
maybe it's Zakir.

390
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,636
One second.

391
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,543
Hello.

392
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,604
Bansal.

393
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,182
Yes, sir.

394
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,118
Listen to me carefully.
- Who is this?

395
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,656
..without interrupting.

396
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,190
Stop! Where to?

397
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,181
Hello. Please sit.

398
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,281
Jaya, did you ask him for tea?

399
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:55,787
Will you have tea?
- No, I get acidity with tea.

400
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,190
Cold milk?

401
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:01,225
No, I am allergic to cold things.

402
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,464
May I begin? - No.

403
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,027
I am expecting someone,
we will start after he comes. - I see.

404
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:13,267
He might understand things from
your information which I may not.

405
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,034
What did he say?
- Jaya!

406
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,405
She is a mother after all.

407
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:20,780
I will narrate now
and repeat it later.

408
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,747
No problem. I'll go ahead?

409
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,313
Did you mention this to anyone.

410
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,353
I had to tell my wife.

411
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,422
She is suspicious by nature.

412
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,360
When she asked where I was off to
so late, I had to tell her.

413
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,423
You'd know the nature of women.

414
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,398
Anyone else?

415
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,198
Not at all! I swear to God.

416
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:44,638
I had my wife swear
on our son Cheeku.

417
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,198
..so that she does
not tell her Father.

418
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:51,270
Her father is like BBC news.

419
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:58,182
ls that the expert?
Has he arrived?

420
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:16,171
Come, let us go.
- I am sleepy, let me sleep!

421
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,478
Sleep in this bus. Up.

422
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,746
Go sleep now.

423
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,644
Excuse me, Mr. Expert.

424
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:39,093
I own a company myself.

425
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,721
..where we manufacture locks.

426
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,327
The setup has modern equipments.

427
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,400
I had a question for you.

428
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,368
What is this for?

429
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,233
So that we can tell the
facts from the fabrications.

430
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,345
So speak the truth at all times.

431
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,376
You go ahead and check.
I will only tell the truth.

432
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,418
Mr. Nachiket,
I have patched you through.

433
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,281
Can you hear me clearly?

434
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,347
'I will only tell the truth',
was that the last thing he said'?

435
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,321
It is clear. Go ahead.

436
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,521
Let me recollect clearly.

437
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,498
I kidnapped him on purpose,
it was not a mistake.

438
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:23,198
I don't want money..
I need information.

439
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,373
My son is missing too.

440
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:33,146
Someone opened up their big
greedy mouth and I lost my son in it.

441
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:39,316
I want the Home Minister to
find the one responsible for this.

442
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,615
Find out how and where
my son went missing.

443
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,458
I don't want any inquiries.

444
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,123
No inquiries.
I want the person responsible.

445
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,598
I will punish the
guilty and free his son.

446
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:59,698
And if this isn't carried out..
..then as a matter of Principle.

447
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,336
..then as a matter of Principle.

448
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,311
Another son will go missing..

449
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,208
What do you make of the phone call?

450
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,215
That we are in big trouble.

451
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:47,283
The comman man,
in fact is the most difficult to find.

452
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,722
But then how will we find him'?
l-low will we catch him'?

453
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,254
The answer to 'how' is 'why"?

454
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,197
He said ‘Someone opened up
their big greedy mouth.‘

455
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,027
He lost his son in some
corruption based tragedy.

456
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,798
Find the tragedy,
and you will find the guy.

457
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,971
This will take a long time.

458
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:07,067
That is precisely his motive.

459
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,974
He wants to play.

460
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:11,344
He wants to teach us a lesson.

461
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,977
Let him play.

462
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,052
The longer he drags the
affair the sooner we'll catch him.

463
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:28,025
Not this.
I have called for bottled water.

464
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,123
Take it..

465
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,167
My mouth is on fire.

466
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,070
What's the point now?

467
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,500
Stop making all my decisions for me!

468
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,076
Just kill Cheeku!

469
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,382
Really?

470
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,783
Sorry! I blurted in anger.

471
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,383
I will drink the water you tell me to.

472
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,786
But please don't kill Cheeku.
- Okay.

473
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,525
He has challenged us using that guy!

474
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,036
We have to show him who is in charge.
What about the Army Units?

475
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,666
He will panic under show of strength.
We have to be patient.

476
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,475
Let him think he is winning.

477
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,146
He will keep Rohan alive.

478
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:18,412
What are the leads?

479
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:22,244
The phone used to make the call
was found in a bus heading for Ivleerut.

480
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:26,546
He replicated a stolen
simcard in Dehradun.

481
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,188
I know. His son is missing
due to some corrupt act.

482
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,990
He demands we find the guilty.

483
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,424
We cannot give in to such demands.

484
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,660
I am interested in the tragedy,
not his demand.

485
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,131
If his son is really missing in a
tragedy and if we find that tragedy.

486
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,539
..then we will find him too.

487
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:51,371
For this, I will need permission
to setup a parallel investigation.

488
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,741
Please, sir.

489
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,314
I told you not to drink that water.
Now your stomach is upset.

490
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,656
Why is it taking so long?
- There is no vvater inside.

491
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,064
You people never provide
water to second-class passengers.

492
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:17,139
Scan every news item.
On the Internet, television.

493
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,267
...shortlist every story that
has any corruption allegation.

494
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,436
Come on!

495
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,744
Nachiket, meet Mr. Mishra.

496
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,115
Please inform him
anything relevant you..

497
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,523
..find in the Internal
Inquiries being carried out here.

498
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,618
I am off to collect the
Input Reports from State Level IB.

499
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,998
Only these many scams.

500
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,064
Then we will find him for sure.

501
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:57,569
Mr. Mishra, a bridge
collapsed due to heavy rains.

502
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,483
Do I put it under natural
calamity or corruption?

503
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:06,114
Mr. Sinha, how old was the bridge'?
- 25 years.

504
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,956
Surely then,
some great soul must have built it.

505
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,184
Put it under natural calamity.

506
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,324
Find bridges that collapsed
within 3 or 4 years.

507
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,260
Yes sir.

508
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,436
Take a deep breath.

509
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,233
Take a deep breath.

510
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,700
Just a minute son.

511
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,474
Sit straight.
- I can't bear it.

512
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,378
ls it paining?
Sit straight.

513
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,178
You will be fine.

514
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,388
We will need to admit him.

515
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,183
Why don't you take some money and
just give me the medicines.

516
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,486
What nonsense!

517
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,188
Don't hospitals admit patients just
to make a bill.

518
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,490
You look educated,
don't talk like ignorant people.

519
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,565
His stomach can't hold food, he ends up
vomiting.. Isn't that what you said?

520
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,434
He needs to be given
Glucose through a drip.

521
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,369
Go take him home
and give him glucose.

522
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,534
You go ahead and admit him then.
- No take him home.

523
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,273
Admit him then.

524
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,439
Okay fine, go.

525
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:06,674
Sister!

526
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,629
Quiet!

527
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,594
Quiet!

528
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,630
Quiet!

529
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,163
What's wrong with you!

530
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,327
He just has a stomach infection.

531
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,292
He will be fine by tomorrow.

532
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,631
Where is his mother?

533
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,437
She has gone abroad.

534
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,175
Be a man. Don't lose courage.

535
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:48,582
Go! Get lost!

536
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,420
He will die!

537
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,618
Everyone will die! I will die!
I'll send them in a bag!

538
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,241
No. I won't go this time.

539
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:14,334
It is really late!

540
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,608
They throw so much torch in my eyes,

541
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:22,618
lam blind by the time
I reach his doorstep.

542
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,076
Then do one thing.

543
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,384
Record this.

544
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,550
Where?

545
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,685
On your phone, where else?

546
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,126
I don't know how to.

547
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,195
I've never tried.

548
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,566
lam a very simple man.

549
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,636
I make locks for a living.

550
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,265
Then you don't have a choice.

551
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,568
Take your phone and go to his place.
Right now!

552
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:48,337
Go!

553
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,434
Come again?

554
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,446
Go!

555
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,639
Sir, mean to say..

556
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,081
Hello! Hello!

557
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,048
Sir?

558
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,784
What the hell!

559
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,216
Home Ministry!

560
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,684
A lot of thought must
have gone into it's name.

561
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,188
That caught my attention.

562
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,758
And then look at the irony.

563
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,065
We are both Fathers.

564
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,664
You haven't given us proof of life.

565
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,706
No need, I know he is alive!

566
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,734
And he will stay that way for now.

567
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,369
You must have run a
polygraph test on my voice.

568
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,605
You must know by now.

569
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,215
He is using an internet phone. IP
address is masked. We need more time.

570
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,347
What happened to my demand?

571
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,320
What will you get out of all this?

572
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,783
Let us talk, we can find a solution...
- Shut up!

573
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,597
I had given you the solution!
Why didn't you search?

574
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,257
These things take time.

575
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:48,795
We are trying our best.
Thousands of files, TV reports and..

576
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,301
You will have to scan
files like common people.

577
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,477
Or you won't be able to?
You are not used to it.

578
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,205
That is why give us some time.

579
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,007
You are asking time to find me,
not to do what I asked.

580
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:03,274
You won't find me.

581
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,555
Technical department must
have told you why.

582
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,021
Then again I am a common man, and
look like one. Hovv will you find me?

583
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:15,264
I look and dress just like
the other 1.25 billion.

584
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,320
You won't find me.

585
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,600
I guarantee you that
you can't find my location.

586
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,434
Don't waste time, get to the point!

587
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:28,734
Did you find out
why my son went missing?

588
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,579
Which state are you from?

589
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,708
Where did this tragedy occur?

590
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,546
Now who was that?

591
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,453
The attitude in the voice
sounds like the Big Boss.

592
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,360
But something in the
voice says it was a Father.

593
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:54,228
Even the Home Minister
doesn't know where my son is?

594
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,269
Why are we wasting
each other's time?

595
00:44:56,461 --> 00:45:00,034
The list is long, if you delay
like this how will we find your son'?

596
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,199
That is true.

597
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,548
So many people must have lost their
sons recently, the list must be long.

598
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:10,278
Otherwise wouldn't you've
got your son back by now?

599
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,588
Make some efforts. Face hardships.

600
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,652
At least you will get an
idea what hardships feel like.

601
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,192
Officer, give me your number.

602
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:26,467
Write it down.

603
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,995
011-62826242.

604
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:45,383
Sister.
- Tell me.

605
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:51,016
Sister.
- ls it paining? Tell me..

606
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,064
This was lying outside.

607
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:03,469
I accidentally dropped it.
- That's okay.

608
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:16,446
What is he trying to say?
- I'll check on him.

609
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,625
Don't do it.

610
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,420
Don't cry.

611
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,265
Don't cry.

612
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,569
DON'T!

613
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,700
You will get better soon.

614
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,403
Everything will turn out fine,
don't cry.

615
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:45,570
I want to go home.

616
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:52,386
Let me go home please.

617
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,205
You won't understand
what I am about to say.

618
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,448
Not today. not tomorrow.

619
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:29,320
Five, ten, maybe fifteen years down the
line my words may affect you.. deeply.

620
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,453
Maybe even change your life.

621
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:39,362
But right now, don't do anything.

622
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,266
Don't say anything.

623
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:51,343
I am scared. I am angry.

624
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:56,418
I might end up doing
something terrible.

625
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:01,020
Only recently have I learnt
what terrible feels like.

626
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,619
Okay?

627
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,033
Jaya, get some sleep.

628
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,539
Jaya.

629
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,417
Okay, fine. I am sorry.

630
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,091
Champion School was my idea.

631
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:40,360
I cut down on the security.

632
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,197
It was a lapse.

633
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,777
Can I talk to my mom?

634
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,120
No.

635
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,020
I hate you.

636
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,396
Your hate doesn't matter.

637
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:26,136
But my hate, it matters..
It is capable of much worse.

638
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,208
"Technical department must
have told you why."

639
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:33,404
It's confusing.

640
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,279
By his style of speaking,
he could be from anywhere

641
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,510
It's a neutral accent,
he could be trained or not.

642
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,354
He talks like a civilian but his clarity of
demand is that of a trained group.

643
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:45,425
So, he can be from any of the locations
we short-listed on the basis of tragedies.

644
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,393
Excuse me sir.

645
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,493
We have zeroed down on Hyderabad,
Nashik, Mumbai, Almora and Jamshedpur.

646
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,267
National Integration.

647
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,537
I don't appreciate your sarcasm.
- I was just...

648
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,201
You be quiet!

649
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,180
Sir.
- Yes.

650
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:11,486
We will need to visit each victim's house
to check if any of their relatives.

651
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,318
..have recently been to Delhi,
Rajasthan, UP or Dehradun.

652
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:18,587
Only your bureau can carry out
this task in these states.

653
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,427
Hold on.

654
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:26,701
..vvhat is more dangerous?
- What?

655
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,397
Let us eat something.

656
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,105
Look, I don't want to fall sick again.
Let us eat there.

657
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,643
Add the bill in your list of demands.

658
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,703
If you don't have the money,
my Father will pay for it.

659
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,480
Now let us go.

660
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,177
Cooked food doesn't spread diseases.

661
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,751
Diseases are spread because of
the dirty water your people provide.

662
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,122
Did you get that Your Highness?

663
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,748
You will be eating here.
- What's your problem?

664
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:52,386
Why should I tell you?

665
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,327
Why should I tell
you what's my problem?

666
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,828
What's my problem!

667
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,130
You people dismiss our needs.

668
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,297
No more asking. From here on,
I will snatch it away!

669
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:07,339
Everyone will listen to me now! Come!

670
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,379
Look, don't force me!
- Come along!

671
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:13,347
I am sorry! I was making excuses.

672
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:18,250
I feel like eating french-fries,
or curry-rice.. Things like that.

673
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,347
Only that will suit me.

674
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,280
My stomach hurts!

675
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:24,223
Okay wait a minute.

676
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,083
Let's go then.

677
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:28,755
Did he buy it?

678
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,027
Got him!

679
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,672
You got your way because you reminded me
of someone. Not because of your cunning ways.

680
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:42,642
French-fries.
Come on.

681
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:45,673
This man is travelling in
the North or North-West Interiors.

682
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:49,240
..and that's why he isn't being spotted
on Airports or Railway Stations.

683
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,617
He is travelling within the interiors,
he is using buses, tempos and autos.

684
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,054
Based on the list of tragedies.

685
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,355
..he is either from Uttarakhand,
Jharkhand, Maharashtra or Telangana.

686
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:04,760
And considering the time after kidnapping,
he can be in Rajasthan, UP or even Delhi.

687
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,398
Cover towns of population
of ten thousand to cities of..

688
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:15,376
..one lakh, using the
police and local agencies

689
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:20,379
For the kid's safety, do not
disclose the reason for the Alert.

690
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,046
Just warn them,
a terrorist of this profile..

691
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:29,785
.. using an eight year
old for cover is on the move.

692
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,029
What are we doing here?

693
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,790
Our train leaves in the evening.

694
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:40,797
What will we do until then?

695
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,802
Everyone is quiet,
no one is speaking up.

696
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,038
Nothing on television either.

697
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,582
So what had happened?

698
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,347
Why are you doing all this?

699
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:00,278
What's your damn freaking story?

700
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,621
Your freaking story..

701
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:05,153
Your story..

702
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,422
I will give you one tight slap!

703
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:11,124
Am I some clown to entertain
you with my stories'?

704
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,329
I will shoot you! And then Cheeku.

705
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,366
DO it!

706
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,336
My Dad will squish you.

707
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,773
I have seen what
your Father is capable of.

708
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,167
Father. Father.

709
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,107
He is the Home Minister,
he will easily find you.

710
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,207
I know he is the Home Minister
and I know he will find me!

711
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:29,716
But he is not a father!

712
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:36,048
A real father would have been on
his knees to get his son back.

713
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,796
I thought he would
definitely do something.

714
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:44,424
..but he isn't a father!

715
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,494
We wouldn't have been comfortably
sitting here otherwise.

716
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,197
No he...

717
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,536
Just shut up!
lam losing my mind.

718
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,406
Don't test my patience.

719
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,013
People know only half the story.

720
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,150
Time to complete the story.

721
00:54:21,225 --> 00:54:23,671
To be born in India is no big deal.

722
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,241
But it is when they are born to us.

723
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,074
Or people like me
make a big deal out of it.

724
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,008
He was so small.

725
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,743
I feared I would lose him
if I touched him.

726
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,387
Sister, would you please
pick him up for me?

727
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,524
Aren't you the father?

728
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,320
You should be picking him up.

729
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,123
No, not me.

730
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:50,761
These are hands of a labourer,
I might hurt him.

731
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:53,134
You will spoil him.

732
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,299
He will disown you when you grow old.

733
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:00,608
Hold him!

734
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,573
Wait a minute!

735
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,168
I'll Will take him?

736
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,369
Wait a minute!

737
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,343
Nothing will happen?

738
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:12,476
So vulnerable, that the parents decide
to become their pillars of strength.

739
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,549
And when this responsibility
comes on a single parent,

740
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,092
he needs double the strength.
Like I did.

741
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,365
ls Mom in Heaven?

742
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:27,599
Some people do call America Heaven.

743
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,234
Why did she go there?

744
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:35,239
She went there to work,
and grew fond of that place.

745
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,570
Did she love me?

746
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,648
Yes, of course she did.
That is what she would tell me.

747
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:50,188
And who wouldn't
fall in love with you.

748
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,488
Knock-Knock.
- Yes?

749
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,262
Hovv much longer?

750
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,032
Who is it? Who are you?

751
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,434
Dad, don't you recognize your son?

752
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,235
It is a family disorder.
My father never recognized me either.

753
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,041
There were so many of us too.

754
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,605
You know what happened one day.

755
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,636
One day I was sneaking in
with a kite, when my Father called -

756
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:12,970
"Who is this?"

757
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,141
"What do you want?

758
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,306
"Who are you?"

759
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,680
I said, "It's me, Nirmal!
Where are your spectacles?"

760
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:24,254
He said "Nirmal, I see.
So you are Bisheswaﬁs son?"

761
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,690
I said "No, I am your son!"

762
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,324
"What, my son?"

763
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,499
I said "Yes, don't you remember
you put me in School last year?"

764
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,437
He said "Yes,
I did do something like that".

765
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,007
"It is getting cold.
Go oil your hair and sit in the Sun."

766
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,667
Dad this is a bluff.
l-low can anyone forget his son's name

767
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,010
I swear this used to happened.

768
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,477
By the time I was born,
my father had turned very old.

769
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,415
No teeth left, poor digestion
and no control over population.

770
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:54,713
There were 2, then 4,
then 8, then 16 of us.

771
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,088
Why can't we all live together..

772
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,718
..in your big joint family?

773
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,292
Joint family.

774
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,358
Dad it is okay to lie.

775
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:11,633
Not to you.

776
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:16,166
You see, I was banished from home.

777
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,403
Your mother was not a Hindu.

778
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,375
So?

779
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:22,506
So! Exactly, that's what I said.

780
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:23,347
So!

781
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,518
You and I think alike,
partner.

782
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,282
Sorry! It flew off by itself.

783
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:04,557
Will you read to me
the story you are writing?

784
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,654
You were screaming for 'Apu'.

785
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:15,404
I saw it on the lpad.
- Why should I tell you?

786
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:20,269
Halfway through my story
and I have lost all my anger.

787
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:21,637
I don't want to complete it.

788
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,739
The Hawk wants to prey
on me and I give up my fight?

789
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,381
I won't complete it!

790
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:33,153
I will give up my peace
but deny the Hawk it's victory!

791
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:42,394
I was naive.
I never troubled anyone for answers.

792
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:45,160
Always kept to my affairs.

793
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,293
<i>Kept away from propaganda
and even the news.</i>

794
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,571
Never indulged in political
views or opinions.

795
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,231
That was not my World.

796
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,370
My World was right in my lap.

797
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,512
I would stroke his hair.

798
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,682
He used to sleep in my lap.

799
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:11,685
Apu!

800
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,170
Apu!

801
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,173
I was the ideal voter!

802
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,287
Lost in a world of my own.

803
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,489
Busy making ends meet.

804
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,657
Believing in the dreams they gave me!

805
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,287
Trusting what was shown on TV
and written in the papers.

806
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:55,268
But you snatch my World away from me,
and I will tear into your World!

807
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,504
I won't complete the story!

808
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,008
I will leave it
incomplete in the middle!

809
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:15,652
You sleep.

810
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:20,092
Sleep.

811
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:51,438
We were the first to tell you that the
Home Minister's son Rohan was kidnapped.

812
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,169
Now Swatantra TV is bringing you..

813
01:03:54,197 --> 01:04:00,478
..the video posted
by that very kidnapper.

814
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,244
Did you see this Father-Son video?

815
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:03,576
Where could his son be?

816
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,418
"
 know where your son is..."

817
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,217
"...but do you know where my son is?"

818
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:13,317
The Home Minister should promise him that
his son will reach home safe and sound.

819
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,355
ls this a clue?

820
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,157
What is the connection between.

821
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,531
..the Home Minister
and the Kidnappeﬁs son?

822
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,660
For the helpless ones..

823
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:25,031
..the only option left
is to turn to violence.

824
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:30,269
The Home Minister must reply, that
is the clear verdict of the people.

825
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,343
If he feels that his
personal situation.

826
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:37,215
..is affecting his work, then
he will quit his office himself.

827
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,250
Nice!

828
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,953
You slapped him but
I felt the thrills.

829
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,584
You seem happy today.

830
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,121
The public opinion might have changed.

831
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,295
But not your Father.

832
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:54,159
"What is the connection between."

833
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,500
"..the Home Minister
and the Kidnappeﬁs son?"

834
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,139
"Keep tuned in - "

835
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:01,940
Hitting the pause button
won't put a pause to all this.

836
01:05:02,165 --> 01:05:03,906
What was he saying earlier?

837
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:06,241
"He is playing a game. Let him play."

838
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,076
Now he is winning the game.

839
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:09,208
He has become a hero.

840
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,550
The smarter he acts,
the faster he will fall.

841
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:12,914
Let him act smart.

842
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,953
I suggest that you
speak to the 
&B Minister.

843
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:17,451
Get this video blocked.

844
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,586
Yes, a few more videos
and he will become an icon.

845
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,362
'John Doe', 'The Fearless One'

846
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,330
..they are making him famous
with all kinds of names.

847
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:25,660
I agree with Mr. Nimbalkar.

848
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,060
I disagree.

849
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,370
The issue is not the videos,
it is Rohan's safe return.

850
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:33,167
On the fifth day now, other than
his growing popularity.

851
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,641
ls there any development
from your end?

852
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:37,669
There is.

853
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:40,243
These videos are giving clues.

854
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,007
And you want to block them off?

855
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:46,014
Will he be providing all the clues, or
can we expect something from you too'?

856
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,386
We found our first
lead in Uttarakhand.

857
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,320
We found Rohan's fingerprints.

858
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:52,323
..and footmarks.

859
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:57,622
We found fingerprints of a man which did
not match with the owner of the hut.

860
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,467
These prints were not found
in any of our criminal databases.

861
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,164
This guy is a first timer.

862
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,534
A vigilante who is
out to prove a point.

863
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,637
Why hasn't he been caught yet?

864
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,502
Because he is constantly travelling.

865
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,106
L-low can you be so sure'?

866
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,111
We have checked every hotel,
every lodge.

867
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:15,339
We need more deployment.

868
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,678
This is not a job for the Police.

869
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,119
What use is that
technological setup of yours.

870
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:22,019
That man is from
a technical background.

871
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:25,351
That is the reason we aren't able to
track his location through his calls.

872
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,425
I said no calls.

873
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:31,499
Sir.

874
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:32,599
L-low is Jaye'?

875
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,534
She is not doing that well,
Mr. Prime Minister.

876
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,265
We pay a heavy
price for our public life.

877
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,367
We are receiving a negative
feeling from the ground workers.

878
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:48,641
The Opposition is giving
it's usual reactions.

879
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,908
Sympathy for your personal life.

880
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:53,917
And a demand for your
resignation in your public life.

881
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,183
Nachiket, you have only two days.

882
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,454
I just spoke with the PM.

883
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,654
Someone is angry.
Did the Home Minister just arrive'?

884
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,431
L-low strange'?

885
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,367
He doesn't even want to talk to
his son. What kind of a father is he?

886
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,104
ls Rohan with you?

887
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,337
So you are present there.

888
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,504
At least you are a
Father enough to speak up.

889
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:17,105
I want to talk to my son.

890
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,146
And I want to talk to my son.
I order you.

891
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,613
First have me talk to my son.

892
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,577
We are looking for him.

893
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,482
Where are you looking for my son?

894
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,579
We have records of
6 cities from 4 states.

895
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:30,385
All the tragedies that happened.
- You can't find a boy?

896
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,118
Write an application to me,
I Will find him!

897
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:35,629
I will do yourjob for you!
What good is your system?

898
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,154
Ask the Home Minister.

899
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,661
ls it only for filling
up your pockets?

900
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,998
My wound is fresh,
and I won't allow it to heal.

901
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,473
I will give you a wound and disappear!

902
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,972
You have until tomorrow. That's it!

903
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,099
The rest is your responsibility.

904
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,138
'My wound is fresh' means
it is a recent tragedy.

905
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:56,946
He could not have taken more
than a month to plan all this.

906
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,245
The kidnapper had
setup his stall fifteen days ago.

907
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:02,415
As soon as we know the
tragedy we will find him.

908
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,990
It is just a matter of time.

909
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:09,152
I will be here for two more days.

910
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:12,194
Someone else might
replace me after that.

911
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:18,495
He is not the only one beaten
down by this system, Nachiket.

912
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,912
Where are you headed?

913
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,112
We are waiting for the train.

914
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:37,625
It will arrive in five minutes.

915
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,616
Be sure to board it.

916
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:43,494
A unit of RTF is arriving
here in 1O minutes.

917
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,297
Why are you telling me all this?

918
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:54,165
You know very well why.

919
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,912
He is my son.

920
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,276
Good.

921
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:02,550
You still have your son.

922
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,579
Many don't have their son with them.

923
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,183
Sir..

924
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,085
You scared me.

925
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:14,126
Nashik or lvlumbaL.

926
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,224
The tragedies that occurred
in Nashik and lvlumbaL.

927
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,160
Everyone is finding the
kidnappeﬁs demand genuine.

928
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,598
Why don't you fulfill it?

929
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:25,599
I cannot setup a Kangaroo
court to give him instant justice.

930
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:28,640
Why don't you understand Jaya,
lam the Home Minister...

931
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,902
You cannot get him justice,
you cannot get me justice.

932
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,441
Are you really the Home Minister then?

933
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:34,607
Shut the hell up!

934
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,575
Not a word more!

935
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,186
Okay, fine. Not a word more.

936
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:48,057
I won't talk to you.

937
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,438
I am a mother.
I will talk to a father.

938
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,607
From a mother... to a father!

939
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,543
Neither your son,
nor mine, are at fault here.

940
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:12,976
I don't know where your son is.

941
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:19,921
And I don't have the
strength to find him for you.

942
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:24,124
But my Rohan paying the
price for it is not fair either.

943
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,426
You told us about your son.

944
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,496
I will tell you about my Rohan.

945
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:37,674
His childhood is being spent in
his Father's political shadow.

946
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:42,007
But that did not make him a grown-up.

947
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,942
He is a kid after all.

948
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,614
That is why you could
get to him so easily.

949
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:51,552
This is a mother's plea to Mr.
John Doe.

950
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:57,897
This video has aroused
the nation's sympathy for Rohan.

951
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:01,401
Will Mr. John Doe reply to this video'?

952
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:05,870
"But my Rohan paying the
price for it is not fair either."

953
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:10,978
ls there a room available?

954
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:11,910
No.

955
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:13,513
Please check.

956
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,382
There are no rooms available.

957
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,042
Damn it!

958
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,079
Damn those sh***y trains!

959
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:24,023
Again you will make me
travel in those trains !

960
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:27,520
Lets go.

961
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:31,497
Rohan!

962
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:32,498
Yes?

963
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,430
Rohan who?

964
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,014
Where was the sighting?

965
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,278
Near Tonk. At a guest house.

966
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,307
We have already informed the team.

967
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,547
Did you cover the highways?
- Yes.

968
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:55,556
Talk to the concerned SP.

969
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:58,558
Deploy Central and Parliamentary
forces at the Checkpoints.

970
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:01,619
Instruct local stations to patrol
all the lanes and neighborhoods.

971
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,488
I hope he doesn't harm the
kid fearing our growing presence

972
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,625
Hope the idiot doesn't panic.

973
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,998
Madam has uploaded a photo.
the kid is now being recognized.

974
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:20,648
How?

975
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:24,381
If he disappears in the crowd
this time, we will be done for.

976
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:27,588
L-low did he know my name'?

977
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:30,216
Even I was wondering.

978
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:34,356
I swear, I didn't turn
around intentionally.

979
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:38,365
When he said Rohan, I naturally...

980
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,459
Sorry.

981
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:56,042
"Neither your son,
nor mine, are at fault here."

982
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,484
"
 don't know where your son is.."

983
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:03,989
And I don't have the
strength to find him for you.

984
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,616
So easily the World switches sides.

985
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:10,029
People change so easily.

986
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:15,468
Mister please stop the truck.
- just a minute.

987
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:17,562
Central command.
- Hello.

988
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,532
An old man from Mumbai had called.

989
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:20,472
Vishwas Poddar.

990
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,272
He said he knows who the kidnapper is.
- Copy.

991
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,979
We have either hit the jackpot
or the old man is bluffing.

992
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:29,015
Arshad you leave for Jaipur.

993
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,150
I will head to Mumbai.

994
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:32,047
Why Ivlumbai?
The sighting was in Rajasthan.

995
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,610
He wanted us to find out the tragedy.

996
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,451
We have zeroed-in on Mumbai.

997
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:37,356
If we don't find him in Rajasthan.

998
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,984
...we will at least find
his identity in Mumbai.

999
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,958
Come on, get going. 'Long live India'.

1000
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:50,326
When will we leave this place?

1001
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,505
There is no one around.

1002
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:57,909
Nothing to eat either.

1003
01:13:58,301 --> 01:14:00,212
Where will we go?

1004
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,507
Your mother played the emotional card.

1005
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,919
We will have to lay low now.

1006
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:04,630
Home Minister's little son is missing.

1007
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:12,510
The man claiming responsibility for the
video, even his little son is missing.

1008
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:22,447
The man I knew, even
his little son was missing.

1009
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:27,124
My son is missing too.

1010
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:38,267
So I think the
same man is behind all this.

1011
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:48,075
If you are angry with the system,
take it out on me.

1012
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:53,018
But tell me that man's name, quick.

1013
01:16:58,381 --> 01:17:00,122
I don't remember his name.

1014
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,322
Do you suspect anyone?

1015
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,456
I remember his number.

1016
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:13,666
Number 3.

1017
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:21,940
Relief Commissioner
Gupte will know his name.

1018
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,976
It is a good thing you showed
up to collect the cheque.

1019
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:29,188
Wait outside, I will call you.

1020
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,682
That's enough, Father.
Stop coming around here.

1021
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,255
Calm down and sit.

1022
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:38,926
There is nothing wrong in this.

1023
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:39,656
But...

1024
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:40,558
Quiet!

1025
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,165
Sit!

1026
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:58,978
Number 3, correct?

1027
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:01,077
Nirmal.

1028
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:04,989
I am number 8, Poddar.

1029
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,652
He was his younger brother.

1030
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,059
He was supposed to go to Boston.

1031
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:22,069
Now we won't have to spend
on Boston and my son...

1032
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:28,240
He was 22 years old.

1033
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:31,251
He argues with me.

1034
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:33,216
Says don't take the money.

1035
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:37,413
Though he was dependent on him.

1036
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,023
I am not collecting compensation
against his life.

1037
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,167
Not his compensation.

1038
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:51,466
I am taking it for this one's future.

1039
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,036
I will draw a FD on his name.

1040
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:59,077
That one has left
us, but this one is right here.

1041
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,443
He is still here.

1042
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:10,154
What will you do with the cheque?

1043
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:17,324
What Will I do'?

1044
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:19,964
I will do a lot.

1045
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:27,107
I will roll the cheque into a dagger,

1046
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:32,275
and stabb it in the chest
of my son's killer.

1047
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:39,545
What Will I do'?

1048
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,486
I will do something for sure.

1049
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,423
Mr. John Doe, they now know your name.

1050
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,864
They will be reaching your home soon.

1051
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:56,536
The man you mentioned the 'dagger' to,
informed them about you.

1052
01:19:57,326 --> 01:20:00,933
He remembered Gandhi bapu's teachings
but forgot his son.

1053
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,470
They ignored my appeal,
but heard your mother's.

1054
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,416
The noose is ready.

1055
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,650
What are you doing
in the jungle at this hour?

1056
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,519
I am asking you.

1057
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,500
We were headed to Jaipur.

1058
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,400
The truck's driver was drunk,
he dumped us here.

1059
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:33,605
It is okay, I will drop you.

1060
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:38,101
Come on, or the both of
you will freeze-up by morning.

1061
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,375
Come on, don't think so much.
Come on, hop in!

1062
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:43,475
ls he your son?

1063
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,243
What is your name, son?
- Rohit.

1064
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,553
<i>Rah“.</i>

1065
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,354
Come on now.

1066
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,190
Come on, let us see what happens.

1067
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,585
Come on, don't think too much.

1068
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,060
<i>Mr. Gupta?</i>

1069
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,110
Kishan Nagar Police Station,
SP Sharma.

1070
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:16,082
Kanta, Satya speaking.

1071
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:19,079
Satya, are you drunk?
- No.

1072
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,047
I am bringing with me, what you have
been looking for all over Jaipur.

1073
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,622
Where are you?
- Closer to Sanganer.

1074
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,155
I will be there in half an hour.

1075
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,258
Are they both with you?
- Yes.

1076
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:30,655
We will talk when I get home.

1077
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,194
I will cover you from three sides.

1078
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,334
Are you coming here directly?
- Yes. Very good.

1079
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,030
Are you with the police?

1080
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:43,908
Come again?
- Are you with the police?

1081
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,069
No, I am a forest officer

1082
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:48,347
at the Tiger Reserve
up ahead, near Tonk.

1083
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:50,974
Show me your phone.
- What?

1084
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,919
Show me your phone!
- Keep your hands off!

1085
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:57,219
Uncle, give it to him,
he is carrying a bomb.

1086
01:21:57,313 --> 01:21:58,451
Uncle, give it to him!

1087
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,953
Let go I said!

1088
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,166
Get down! Give me your phone!

1089
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,136
Get down or I will shoot you!

1090
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:18,271
Listen, return the gun.

1091
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,205
Don't run or I will shoot you.

1092
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,219
You have 'Cop' written
all over your face.

1093
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,535
I know what your
mother is going through.

1094
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:46,901
But she just made
things difficult for us.

1095
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,469
You are in no real trouble here.

1096
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,972
She told her story
and ruined everything.

1097
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:56,913
Does she even know what I have lost?

1098
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:04,886
Now I will tell my story.

1099
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:10,325
When the story ends,
so will this game.

1100
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:24,566
Ready, handsome.
- Who is it? What do you want?

1101
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:27,079
Please Dad. No time for all that.

1102
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:27,910
Let us go!

1103
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,610
My father did not have time for me,
now my son doesn't..

1104
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:32,944
And my wife didn't
have the time for me either.

1105
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:37,286
Partner you are hitting a raw nerve,
I am very sensitive about this.

1106
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,953
Had you shown this sensitivity
back then, she wouldn't have run away.

1107
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,155
My sensitivity was a problem for her.

1108
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:46,595
She wanted an action hero.

1109
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:48,090
Whatever.

1110
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,933
Her loss. Come, let us go.

1111
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,030
Yeah, her loss.

1112
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:55,242
Wait, let me answer this.

1113
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:58,676
Hello.
- Please come setup my vvi-fi, on your way to office.

1114
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:00,914
No, I have to drop my kid to school.

1115
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:03,447
Take 500 extra, it is urgent.

1116
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:04,609
500 extra.

1117
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,385
But you never paid me the last time.
- But I will pay this time!

1118
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,079
Dad go ahead.

1119
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:12,250
I will go to school by myself.
- Wait, I will call you back.

1120
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,521
L-low will you go alone'?
- Dad, I know the way.

1121
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,592
I will go on my own,
but will you come to pick me up'?

1122
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:21,533
Yes, of course I will.

1123
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:25,435
"We will be speaking with
our expert Charanjeet on this."

1124
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:28,031
"But before that, there is bad news".

1125
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:31,977
"Reports are coming in
from Andheri East, Mumbai"

1126
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:35,140
"that 8 have died and 4 are
injured when a bridge collapsed.."

1127
01:24:35,204 --> 01:24:38,117
This is now up.
- But this one just went down.

1128
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:41,254
Breaking news.
Another bridge collapsed.

1129
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,080
The extra fee..

1130
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,322
Thieves, all of them.

1131
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:47,292
This is what happens
when you cheat people.

1132
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:48,454
They are all in it together.

1133
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:51,154
My blood boils when I see such things.

1134
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,221
Doesn't yours?

1135
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:53,289
I don't get the time.

1136
01:24:54,156 --> 01:24:55,260
I have a seven year old kid.

1137
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:57,326
The very sight of him soothes my soul.

1138
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:58,970
I raise him all by myself.

1139
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:00,630
Single-parenting!

1140
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:02,633
Hello.

1141
01:25:22,017 --> 01:25:26,693
They are saying...
- What's wrong? Your extra fee!

1142
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:53,653
Mister...

1143
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:59,490
Mister is there a kid named
Apurva Kumar, Apu Kumar on your list?

1144
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:02,092
Go over to counter number 1.

1145
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:05,936
Mister, accident cases?

1146
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:08,100
Check this board.

1147
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,134
Mister.

1148
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,407
He said, ‘I will go on my own.‘

1149
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:20,447
I said 'No, I will drop you.'

1150
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,114
On the way he said..

1151
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:23,679
Where could he disappear like this..

1152
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,451
They are saying he is no more..

1153
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:30,623
This is all they gave me.

1154
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:35,485
He was with me in the morning.
Doctor.

1155
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:39,656
He was with me.. We left to drop him..

1156
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,458
I went for a job..

1157
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:44,561
Where did he leave me and go?

1158
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,472
Mister.

1159
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:49,269
Doctor. .

1160
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,983
Mister.

1161
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,253
Apu..

1162
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,121
Apu!

1163
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,901
Apu!

1164
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:30,314
Apu!

1165
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:37,651
L-low is this possible'?

1166
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,290
He was right here with me.

1167
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:42,027
Where could he have gone.

1168
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:44,629
Apu! He was right here.

1169
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,459
Apu!

1170
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,932
He was right here.

1171
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,609
Apu!

1172
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,584
I don't want compensation,
return my son.

1173
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:50,086
What do I do with the relief money?

1174
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:52,332
Donate it. Do anything with it.

1175
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:56,569
If you don't want it, then
come and sign some forms at my office.

1176
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,404
Knock, Knock!

1177
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:12,178
Who are you?

1178
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:14,610
Whose son are you?

1179
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:37,475
Handsome.

1180
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:40,011
Apu...

1181
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,169
Apu..

1182
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:43,014
..behind the curtains?

1183
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,877
He has a wound, and it is fresh.

1184
01:33:34,876 --> 01:33:37,152
This is a Taj Mahal for his Kid.

1185
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:39,323
His tomb.

1186
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:43,187
Match the finger prints
on this with the ones in the hut.

1187
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:51,132
I don't have the courage
to say I am proud of you.

1188
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:53,506
I won't console you.

1189
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,276
Don't even wipe your tears.

1190
01:33:56,565 --> 01:34:03,449
Apu may never return, but then, no
one may have to lose their Apu again.

1191
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,517
Apu's mother has written about Apu.

1192
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:24,330
The fingerprints
from the hut are a match.

1193
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:28,530
We will be taking a decision today
itself, that is all the time you have.

1194
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,166
We know the face,
we know the area he is in.

1195
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,108
We just need your permission.

1196
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:35,273
We will shoot him wherever we see him.

1197
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:39,577
Jaipur, Sanganer, Tonk..
We are really close.

1198
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,683
But Rohan's safety.

1199
01:34:41,943 --> 01:34:45,356
After Rohan's photo was leaked,
and after all the provocation

1200
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,558
he didn't hurt him.

1201
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:50,324
The officer from Rajasthan
confirmed that Rohan is fine.

1202
01:34:51,653 --> 01:34:54,065
If in the firing..
- No, sir.

1203
01:34:54,122 --> 01:34:55,066
We will take care.

1204
01:34:55,123 --> 01:34:56,193
He is back on.

1205
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,328
He is using that officer
Satyasheel Puniya's phone.

1206
01:34:58,393 --> 01:34:59,963
Same area.

1207
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:02,473
Yes.

1208
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:04,372
Your son is hungry since last night.

1209
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:06,513
I was feeding him,
but you increased surveillance.

1210
01:35:06,668 --> 01:35:08,204
You will be caught.

1211
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:11,148
Surrender, and I promise
you won't lose your life.

1212
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,516
I promise your son
will lose his first.

1213
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:16,587
Did you do my job? Did you find out?

1214
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:18,989
I am sure you know who is behind it.

1215
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:25,061
It takes time to bring
a culprit to justice.

1216
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,600
Will you take this long
to decide to kill me..

1217
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:29,635
..or have you already
taken that decision?

1218
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:34,463
Look there is a process to follovv.

1219
01:35:34,663 --> 01:35:36,267
We act in accordance with the Law.

1220
01:35:36,331 --> 01:35:39,039
Where was this Law
at the time of my son?

1221
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:43,310
You will get justice,
it may take some time.

1222
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:45,985
If that was the way to get it,
then I would have got it by now.

1223
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:49,521
I want it my way.
Right now, immediately!

1224
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,059
The Press has even announced his name.

1225
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:56,058
Justice cannot be served under
the pressure of press and public.

1226
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:58,259
We follow the Law.

1227
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:00,660
And if we don't,
people have a right to change us.

1228
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:02,026
When? 5 years later?

1229
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,627
When all is lost,
and you have raked in all the cash?

1230
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:09,140
And who will answer for
your plundering and loot?

1231
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:12,171
You have a responsibility.
You are accountable.

1232
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:14,636
Which responsibility
are you talking about?

1233
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:17,949
'Answerable to the people',
it is a figure of speech.

1234
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:20,450
We are accountable, but
only in the assembly,

1235
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:21,612
or in the elections.

1236
01:36:22,077 --> 01:36:26,048
It is not our responsibility to
justify to every Tom, Dick and Harry.

1237
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:28,356
Who will look after the country?

1238
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,622
We are like the doctors.

1239
01:36:29,684 --> 01:36:34,224
If a couple of patients die,
do we stop practicing?

1240
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:37,225
Do you tell the people
all this before the elections?

1241
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:40,336
Do you tell them all this
before taking their votes?

1242
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:45,341
Drunk with power you
have lost your manners!

1243
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:48,641
L-low will you look after
the people or the country?

1244
01:36:49,938 --> 01:36:52,885
You who kidnapped a child.

1245
01:36:53,441 --> 01:36:56,513
You will give me lessons
on 'Rule of Law”?

1246
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,250
Do you know how to manage a country?

1247
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:01,521
L-low would I'?

1248
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:03,623
Never saw it managed efficiently.

1249
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:05,523
Exploiting the masses.

1250
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:07,294
..Come and face the public!

1251
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,233
You are the hero of the masses,
aren't you?

1252
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,100
Fine, come to Delhi.

1253
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:14,000
Come on, and openly debate with us.

1254
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:16,338
That is when you will learn.
- Debate?

1255
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:19,671
Will you debate with someone like me?
In the open?

1256
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:32,082
Yes! I will debate with you.

1257
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,484
Come over to Jantar-Mantar
tomorrow morning.

1258
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:38,259
Protesting at Jantar Ivlantar has become
fashionable for people like you.

1259
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:39,261
I will be there.

1260
01:37:39,621 --> 01:37:40,599
Step down your security.

1261
01:37:41,256 --> 01:37:44,203
Any checking and I will kill
your son and then myself.

1262
01:37:44,259 --> 01:37:45,169
I am coming.

1263
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:50,172
Fine.

1264
01:37:50,432 --> 01:37:53,413
People will witness our debate live.
I am letting them know.

1265
01:38:45,553 --> 01:38:48,898
We have found out who approved
the construction of this bridge.

1266
01:38:48,957 --> 01:38:50,959
Your name is repeatedly
being mentioned in this scandal.

1267
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:52,561
It is said that you are
a shareholder in lndico.

1268
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:53,628
Nonsense. It is all nonsense.

1269
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:55,306
Sabhyata Party claims that.

1270
01:38:55,363 --> 01:38:58,469
..the opposition
is provoking the people.

1271
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:00,877
Step down if you cannot
manage the country,

1272
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:01,970
We will run it with the people.

1273
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:44,350
People all over are staging rallies against
Pratap Singh Nimbalkar and Sabhyata party.

1274
01:39:45,546 --> 01:39:47,184
It is finally going to happen.

1275
01:39:47,382 --> 01:39:48,952
I will be free tomorrow morning.

1276
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:50,495
Both of us will be free.

1277
01:39:50,919 --> 01:39:55,334
You are not as special
as they are making you out to be.

1278
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:58,370
Did anyone seek your
opinion Your Highness?

1279
01:39:58,526 --> 01:40:02,531
So I am a Prince! I will voice my
opinions when I feel like.

1280
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:05,541
Sh“ man! I am talking like you.

1281
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:08,143
I must have Stockholm Syndrome.

1282
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:09,279
What is that?

1283
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:15,645
A strange affection or sympathy
between the kidnapper and the victim.

1284
01:40:16,144 --> 01:40:17,589
Can the kidnapper have it too?

1285
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:19,450
Stockholm Syndrome.

1286
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,358
You say. You will know better.

1287
01:40:37,899 --> 01:40:41,244
All the routes coming in
to Delhi have been covered by snipers.

1288
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:42,906
He is walking straight into the trap.

1289
01:40:43,004 --> 01:40:45,484
L-laryana Bus Depot is
six kilometres ahead of ISBT,

1290
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,449
our snipers will be
waiting for him there.

1291
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:51,923
We will then say that a lady moved
by Ms. Jaya's appeal, spotted him.

1292
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,425
She tried to reason with him.

1293
01:40:53,514 --> 01:40:55,494
He panicked and drew his gun.

1294
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,029
And our duty officer
was forced to shoot.

1295
01:40:58,185 --> 01:40:59,220
The masses won't digest it.

1296
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:02,200
We will immediately run a
news story to distract the masses.

1297
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:03,161
What news?

1298
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:04,897
The news of your arrest.
- What!

1299
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,990
Don't threaten me anymore.

1300
01:41:34,055 --> 01:41:37,434
I know now there
is no bomb under your belt.

1301
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:40,267
But now I have that police man's gun.

1302
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:46,105
But I stayed for Apu.

1303
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,044
It happens.

1304
01:41:56,177 --> 01:41:57,417
It can happen.

1305
01:42:00,081 --> 01:42:01,151
What?

1306
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:04,158
Stockholm...

1307
01:42:06,855 --> 01:42:09,335
One can have the fear of losing
someone twice in this same life.

1308
01:42:12,927 --> 01:42:14,907
Thank you for the compliment.

1309
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,634
You had said,
back in the nursing home..

1310
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:29,020
Five, ten, maybe fifteen years down
the line, I might start to understand.

1311
01:42:30,945 --> 01:42:35,087
You Know..
I already understand some things.

1312
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:40,530
Like I was never really
hungry in the hostel.

1313
01:42:41,122 --> 01:42:43,295
But I would still
run away from school.

1314
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:44,897
Do you know why?

1315
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:47,930
The heavier the shackles
holding us down.

1316
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:50,568
..the higher we want to fly away.

1317
01:42:52,366 --> 01:42:54,539
I had shackles fastened
tightly around my neck.

1318
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:57,110
I know.

1319
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:17,332
It is my job to gather party fund.

1320
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:19,868
If something goes
wrong in the process,

1321
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:21,099
then will you throw me behind bars?

1322
01:43:21,162 --> 01:43:23,233
The news of your resignation
and an immediate inquiry...

1323
01:43:23,298 --> 01:43:25,403
...should be enough, Mr. Nimbalkar.

1324
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,604
For now, let us give
Nachiket the go ahead.

1325
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:49,899
'SUPPORT Mr. JCDI-IN DCDE - RISE NCDVV

1326
01:44:02,437 --> 01:44:05,008
‘JOHN DOE WILL DEBATE FOR US TODAY‘

1327
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,086
'SUPPORT Mr. JCDI-IN DCDE - RISE NCDVV

1328
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:22,621
Go.

1329
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:57,222
Help!

1330
01:46:24,278 --> 01:46:26,315
The Hawk swooped on it's Prey

1331
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,620
and carried it away.

1332
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:31,555
Story sounds believable,
but you don't like to hear it..

1333
01:46:32,987 --> 01:46:34,989
The prey then attacked the hawk.

1334
01:46:35,256 --> 01:46:40,262
..sounds unbelievable,
but is so pleasing to hear..

1335
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:15,299
It is as if the day
never dawned today.

1336
01:48:15,423 --> 01:48:18,233
Neither the Home Minister nor
Nirmal Kumar showed up.

1337
01:48:18,559 --> 01:48:24,532
People are calling in with
the same question, what went wrong?

1338
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:27,306
We have a calL. from Mumbai

1339
01:48:27,368 --> 01:48:29,507
We have a caller from Mumbai.

1340
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:31,379
What would you like to ask?
What is your question?

1341
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:32,974
I need an answer.

1342
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:37,953
I am in my house,
the doors and windows are all closed.

1343
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:38,922
There are two gas cylinders.

1344
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:41,584
I have already opened the valve
of one cylinder and emptied it.

1345
01:48:41,649 --> 01:48:44,220
lam holding a gun in one
hand and a lighter in another.

1346
01:48:44,285 --> 01:48:45,593
Hello! Are you..

1347
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,290
This is the last game left to play.

1348
01:48:47,388 --> 01:48:48,992
If the Home Minister
does not show up to play..

1349
01:48:49,056 --> 01:48:52,230
..then it won't really matter
if the gas cylinder explodes.

1350
01:48:53,127 --> 01:48:55,437
Mr. Nirmal, is that you'?

1351
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,001
Some more cops knocking on my door.

1352
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:02,570
But I want some other people
at my door, as soon as possible.

1353
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:04,507
Starting with you and your camera.

1354
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:07,317
People will see the truth today.

1355
01:49:07,508 --> 01:49:09,010
Live!

1356
01:49:10,011 --> 01:49:12,890
I have a list, and all those
on the list should be here.

1357
01:49:12,947 --> 01:49:15,188
And they must all speak
the truth or no one survives.

1358
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:16,452
The rest depends on you.

1359
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:19,325
First on the list,
Home Minister Prashant Gosvvamy.

1360
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:22,000
I am not showing
you the rule book.

1361
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:25,463
But we cannot let the Home Minister
of India go to any such place

1362
01:49:25,526 --> 01:49:27,938
which holds possibilities
of his assassination.

1363
01:49:28,529 --> 01:49:30,304
If you still insist on going

1364
01:49:30,364 --> 01:49:33,402
then we will blow up Nirma
's building
half an hour before you reach there.

1365
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,913
He wants to play this game
with the Home Minister of India.

1366
01:49:36,971 --> 01:49:38,644
Not with some ordinary politician.

1367
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,408
I will submit my resignation
to the PM before I go.

1368
01:49:42,143 --> 01:49:44,453
But for the sake of Rohan's safety,

1369
01:49:44,679 --> 01:49:46,886
I will request him not to make a
public announcement of my resignation.

1370
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:49,288
Second on the list,
Pratap Singh Nimbalkar.

1371
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:53,492
No, Prashant Goswamy is no
kin of mine.

1372
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:56,162
But if I go there and get killed,

1373
01:49:56,224 --> 01:49:59,967
then at least my son or my son-in-law
can win with the sympathy wave.

1374
01:50:00,027 --> 01:50:01,870
The owner of lndico, Farheed Wadia.

1375
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:04,876
They can't force you.
You don't have to go!

1376
01:50:05,065 --> 01:50:08,069
Contractor Abhay Sahani.

1377
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:15,512
Structural Engineer Sameer Farooqi.

1378
01:50:44,672 --> 01:50:49,280
Come on! Faster!

1379
01:50:57,351 --> 01:51:01,231
Dad is always busy.
I don't have so many pics with him.

1380
01:51:01,489 --> 01:51:03,469
But I have a lot with mom.

1381
01:51:03,924 --> 01:51:06,530
One from Singapore, when
we sat on the roller-coaster ride.

1382
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:09,973
In the roller-coaster, we
went all the way up and then stopped.

1383
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:12,374
We thought the ride
had stopped working.

1384
01:51:12,533 --> 01:51:15,514
Then they brought
us down in full speed.

1385
01:51:15,636 --> 01:51:17,411
Even the giant wheel was a lot of fun.

1386
01:51:17,471 --> 01:51:20,315
All the rides were a lot of fun.

1387
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:26,089
Will you really do it?

1388
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:28,483
Will you really kill me?

1392
01:51:55,509 --> 01:52:01,187
When our goal is set very high,

1393
01:52:03,918 --> 01:52:10,927
then we have to give up all
attachments to loved ones..

1394
01:52:11,425 --> 01:52:16,499
and do things that we ought to do.

1395
01:52:18,932 --> 01:52:20,502
I have lost one already ..

1396
01:52:22,503 --> 01:52:25,279
..and to achieve my goal,

1397
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:29,346
I will have to
be prepared to lose you too.

1398
01:52:29,477 --> 01:52:31,957
Don't you get it?
Should I blow everyone up?

1399
01:52:32,012 --> 01:52:34,322
The guy from Swatantra TV is here.

1400
01:52:37,218 --> 01:52:41,997
Stay back!

1401
01:52:42,389 --> 01:52:44,232
Get back!

1402
01:52:51,131 --> 01:52:53,008
Are you capable of handling this?

1403
01:52:53,533 --> 01:52:56,013
Whatever happens here,
will the people get to see it?

1404
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:15,127
They haven't arrived yet.

1405
01:53:23,364 --> 01:53:25,537
Please, don't do it.

1406
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:28,375
We will choke with gas,
and we have a kid here too.

1407
01:54:13,914 --> 01:54:17,418
I had planned to become the Governor
of Nagaland after my retirement.

1408
01:54:17,484 --> 01:54:20,488
Now I'll happy if I even get a job
in a Security Agency.

1409
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:22,925
It is your fault.

1410
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:25,364
He eluded us for seven days.

1411
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,332
And then suddenly one day,

1412
01:54:27,394 --> 01:54:29,931
..using that police officer's
phone he said he is coming by bus.

1413
01:54:30,331 --> 01:54:33,938
I think you knew very well, he
would not board that bus from Jaipur.

1414
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:36,571
Do you have any proof?

1415
01:54:37,171 --> 01:54:39,242
Circumstantial evidence?

1416
01:54:39,306 --> 01:54:43,015
I feel somewhere you too believe,
that he is doing the right thing.

1417
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:46,150
Doesn't matter what
you or I believe.

1418
01:54:47,147 --> 01:54:51,391
What people believe,
is what matters.

1419
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:15,344
I'll keep this short
and ask questions.

1420
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,914
I will blow up the cylinder at
the first lie and everyone will die.

1421
01:55:20,314 --> 01:55:21,258
You..

1422
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:25,454
You were the structural
engineer for the bridge.

1423
01:55:26,687 --> 01:55:29,224
Was there a flavv in
the design of the bridge?

1424
01:55:29,623 --> 01:55:31,694
No, there was no flaw in the design.

1425
01:55:32,059 --> 01:55:32,696
Then?

1426
01:55:35,229 --> 01:55:36,367
There were other things.

1427
01:55:36,964 --> 01:55:41,379
Substandard material,
hastiness, poor column support.

1428
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:44,439
..we weren't even given
the vehicular traffic calculation.

1429
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:45,973
Why?

1430
01:55:46,206 --> 01:55:48,243
Actually.
- Not you.

1431
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:50,889
I am asking the
contractor of the bridge.

1432
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,617
You have built many bridges.

1433
01:55:52,979 --> 01:55:55,186
What went wrong?

1434
01:55:56,283 --> 01:55:57,660
We made a mistake.

1435
01:55:58,085 --> 01:55:59,655
Mistake?

1436
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:08,030
We had to pay a lot of bribes,
that is why..

1437
01:56:09,296 --> 01:56:10,536
Did you bribe him?

1438
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:17,677
Did you bribe him?

1439
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:33,260
It was me! I took the bribe.

1440
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:37,663
I took the bribe.

1441
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:41,599
Loads of it.

1442
01:56:41,695 --> 01:56:44,141
For the sake of the party fund.

1443
01:56:45,432 --> 01:56:46,968
I did it for myself as well.

1444
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:49,036
But none of the
bridges ever collapsed.

1445
01:56:49,102 --> 01:56:51,605
This was just an accident.

1446
01:56:54,274 --> 01:56:57,221
The bridge under which
my son was crushed to death.

1447
01:56:57,277 --> 01:57:00,349
..your party took a bribe for it,
you took a bribe for it!

1448
01:57:00,547 --> 01:57:01,890
Right?

1449
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:08,327
In party politics,
there are no tabs on money.

1450
01:57:12,325 --> 01:57:13,497
Things that are beyond you..

1451
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,904
What the..!

1452
01:57:21,001 --> 01:57:24,005
No! Please no..

1453
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:25,376
Please no!

1454
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:29,385
Please... My son..

1455
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:30,250
Sir he is safe!

1456
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:31,584
Are you sure?

1457
01:57:33,246 --> 01:57:37,991
I shot inches away from your son
and your heart skipped a beat.

1458
01:57:40,187 --> 01:57:46,263
You people crushed my son under
tons of cement and rubble.

1459
01:57:48,628 --> 01:57:51,438
I could not even bid
farewell to my son.

1460
01:57:53,467 --> 01:57:56,607
The hospital handed him over to me
in a small plastic bag.

1461
01:58:00,507 --> 01:58:04,216
I could not figure whether
to bury or to burn him.

1462
01:58:11,351 --> 01:58:15,163
No more tricks!
Just straight answers!

1463
01:58:15,422 --> 01:58:17,925
Or I will burn everyone
in this room to ashes.

1464
01:58:17,991 --> 01:58:20,631
Listen keep calm. We will
pay you a handsome compensation.

1465
01:58:23,463 --> 01:58:27,673
Tell me what you want...

1466
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:28,912
Truth.

1467
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:32,106
Only the truth.

1468
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:35,043
No more games!

1469
01:58:35,542 --> 01:58:36,486
Truth!

1470
01:58:40,013 --> 01:58:40,991
Truth?

1471
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:45,220
The truth is shocking.

1472
01:58:45,986 --> 01:58:47,431
It will scare you out of your wits.

1473
01:58:54,261 --> 01:58:58,209
It is not true that
the government is corrupt.

1474
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:09,551
The truth is the government exists
solely for corruption.

1475
01:59:18,919 --> 01:59:22,492
So these amounts we hear about
in the papers and on TV..

1476
01:59:23,056 --> 01:59:24,330
700 billion.

1477
01:59:24,524 --> 01:59:26,401
1000 billion. 2000 billion.

1478
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,031
These bizarre,
inconceivable amounts, do they even..

1479
01:59:31,098 --> 01:59:32,441
Yes they exist.

1480
01:59:35,068 --> 01:59:38,413
Many of us have these amounts.

1481
01:59:39,339 --> 01:59:41,012
We shared it amongst us.

1482
01:59:47,948 --> 01:59:50,019
So whether you are in power or not,

1483
01:59:50,417 --> 01:59:53,864
the business of corruption continues?

1484
01:59:55,088 --> 01:59:59,127
If the government is the chief-contractor,
the opposition is the sub-contractor.

1485
01:59:59,593 --> 02:00:02,540
The contracts run into billions.
No one can do it alone.

1486
02:00:02,963 --> 02:00:05,500
No time for the 1.2 billion people.

1487
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:07,208
1.2 billion?

1488
02:00:08,068 --> 02:00:09,411
Your mathmatics is flawed.

1489
02:00:11,037 --> 02:00:14,348
You are all divided by religion,
caste and regions.

1490
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:16,386
We analyze the figures.

1491
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:18,287
Not 1.2 billion!

1492
02:00:19,179 --> 02:00:21,659
You are all divided into small pieces!

1493
02:00:23,083 --> 02:00:26,963
Not bound together but separated,
easy to break.

1494
02:00:27,086 --> 02:00:28,224
That is the reason why we..

1495
02:00:37,998 --> 02:00:41,571
We crush you under our feet.

1496
02:00:41,969 --> 02:00:44,381
So these are not some odd scams.

1497
02:00:44,671 --> 02:00:50,622
This is your actual
primary business. Correct?

1498
02:00:51,378 --> 02:00:54,450
But you do a lot
of things to please us too.

1499
02:00:54,848 --> 02:00:55,451
Yes.

1500
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,092
We even wear uniforms. See!

1501
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:02,192
Have you ever seen anyone
of us wearing denims?

1502
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:07,871
We go to the Parliament,
the Assembly, we debate.

1503
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:09,934
We give speeches
under the scorching sun.

1504
02:01:09,996 --> 02:01:11,407
And ask for your votes too!

1505
02:01:13,066 --> 02:01:15,979
We simply sideline the
good and the honest ones.

1506
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:19,350
They are just decorative
pieces for us.

1507
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:23,543
Power is meant only for
those who can make money for us

1508
02:01:26,213 --> 02:01:28,625
And it is really your fault.

1509
02:01:29,015 --> 02:01:31,188
We show you a dream,
but you fall for it.

1510
02:01:31,251 --> 02:01:33,231
You don't see the truth.

1511
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:37,526
We know before-hand where
new roads will be built.

1512
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:40,036
So we buy the unclaimed
lands around it.

1513
02:01:40,093 --> 02:01:42,300
Sell it to the government
and make profits.

1514
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:43,668
Want more details?

1515
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:52,916
I have sacrificed my political
career for the sake of my son

1516
02:01:53,206 --> 02:01:56,016
But the business won't stop.

1517
02:01:58,011 --> 02:02:01,982
Primary business.
Isn't that what you called it?

1518
02:02:03,216 --> 02:02:06,993
Things like the Law,
the Police, the Constitution.

1519
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,361
..they are all just
to keep you frightened.

1520
02:02:14,261 --> 02:02:15,035
That's it!

1521
02:02:15,295 --> 02:02:16,205
Satisfied?

1522
02:02:17,164 --> 02:02:18,006
Happy?

1523
02:02:18,465 --> 02:02:19,500
You won?

1524
02:02:20,167 --> 02:02:21,339
Happy ending!

1525
02:02:23,303 --> 02:02:24,941
Happy ending?

1526
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:30,516
I have lost everything.
These things mean nothing to me now

1527
02:02:35,616 --> 02:02:37,323
But for those who are listening.

1528
02:02:38,051 --> 02:02:40,122
maybe not today. not tomorrow.

1529
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:43,091
..in five, ten,
maybe fifteen years. Perhaps

1530
02:03:12,385 --> 02:03:13,420
All of you leave then.

1531
02:03:17,123 --> 02:03:19,228
Go on, leave! Get out.

1532
02:03:20,893 --> 02:03:21,871
Leave.

1533
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:31,410
You leave too, son.

1534
02:04:02,469 --> 02:04:04,312
Let us go, Rohan.

1535
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:26,226
It won't take me
15 years to understand.

1536
02:04:28,428 --> 02:04:30,237
I have understood everything.

1537
02:04:55,522 --> 02:04:57,433
Okay go.

1538
02:08:05,211 --> 02:08:08,454
"Speak, for your lips are free"

1539
02:08:09,549 --> 02:08:14,225
"Speak, your tongue is still yours"

1540
02:08:15,388 --> 02:08:18,392
"Your upright body is yours."

1541
02:08:18,658 --> 02:08:23,107
"Speak, your life is still yours."

1542
02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:30,406
"Speak, this little time is plenty."

1543
02:08:31,104 --> 02:08:34,085
"Before the death of body and tongue."

1544
02:08:34,574 --> 02:08:38,215
"Speak, for truth is still alive."

1545
02:08:38,978 --> 02:08:45,418
"Speak, say whatever is to be said."
