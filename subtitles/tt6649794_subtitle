00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,748
A Sunday - In Thalassery

2
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,713
"SUNDAY HOLIDAY"

3
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,271
Today is Sunday.

4
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,606
Normally Sundays are holidays.

5
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,272
But for the last many Sundays,
you've been having special classes

6
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,270
Reason,

7
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:40,583
In the subject I teach,
you should not scoreless is my commitment.

8
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:47,584
Today, we are at the last Economics class
of your wonderful degree (college) days

9
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,576
Each one of you is dearest to me.

10
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,580
So I wish to deliberate on certain aspects
also that are out of your syllabus.

11
00:03:57,133 --> 00:04:03,379
Years later, the Economic classes that I've
been taking for you in the last one year,

12
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,578
may not be the ones that
you will be recalling!

13
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,376
On the contrary, the out
of syllabus topics that...

14
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,276
...I'm going to discuss in
the next half an hour,

15
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,106
may be what you will remember the most!

16
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,042
Come..Come..

17
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,773
What is the problem? Who is it?

18
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,644
Come let's check.

19
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:24,773
Some Director!

20
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,242
A bird sitting on the branch never thinks,

21
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:34,347
whether it is resting on a
dry branch or green one!

22
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,548
The bird won't have any fear
of the branch breaking.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,478
Reason,

24
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,738
It doesn't rely on the
branch it is sitting on,

25
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,408
rather on its own wings.

26
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:48,208
Only those who believed in their own wings,
have conquered the sky.

27
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,506
Whether it is, Bill Gates..or
our Sachin Tendulkar!

28
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,507
Only the stone that tolerates the chisel
becomes a beautiful statue...

29
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,213
Only the heart that tolerates deep wounds
is consistently happy...

30
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:07,079
These lines are from the song that got our
K S Chitra the State award in Tamilnadu.

31
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,208
What does it mean?

32
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,213
Only those stones who have borne
the pain of chiselling,

33
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,710
have turned into beautiful statues.

34
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,507
All who have patiently dealt
with pain and troubles,

35
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,976
have enjoyed the
sweetness of joy and peace of life.

36
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,274
Is this the big director
getting tensed like kids!

37
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,140
That is not it.. the climax
shoot was going on..

38
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,177
But I am told that Climax shoot is over

39
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,036
Who will manage the
things in the Set, then?

40
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,678
What happened? I was in the Church!

41
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,173
The Climax shoot was on, Sir has been
very tensed for the last 2 days.

42
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,280
With more than 350 Junior artists,
Police personnel and Villagers...

43
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,672
It was almost crowded, isn't it?

44
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,341
Before we could say pack
up after the last shot...

45
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,008
He fell flat on the floor.

46
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:10,306
By scrapping money from here and there,
I was managing to keep the shoot going.

47
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,207
I hoped all my troubles will end by today.

48
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,672
But shoot is almost over, sir.

49
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,137
No I just said.

50
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,437
Won't the Producer also have a heaviness?

51
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,303
Excuse me,

52
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,147
is there any one amongst you
who doesn't know the meaning of this?

53
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,671
Sorry..Sorry ma'am

54
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,112
In future when you look back

55
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,644
What you may remember are,

56
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,637
the things you listened silently,

57
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,309
the paths you tread at a slow pace!

58
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:40,443
All Hullabaloo, Protests,
Revolution ends in this Silence.

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,640
I've done bigger films than this before.

60
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,271
The tension which I never had then...

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,207
This is a Casualty! Patients are not
supposed to be disturbed like this.

62
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:52,968
I know

63
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:56,080
You go to the location and
make the settlements.

64
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,076
- We'll move then. - Hmm.

65
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,075
Manager will be sitting outside.

66
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,406
In case if you need anything, inform him.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,205
Sure.

68
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,276
- See you, sir. - Hmm.

69
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,976
Take the car

70
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,268
You call Kammath!

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,207
Doctor, if I'm not suffering
from any fatal disease,

72
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,674
Will you please shift me to any room?

73
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,108
This atmosphere
and everything around disturbs me totally"

74
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,405
I'm admitted in a hospital for
the first time. That's why.

75
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:21,771
Hmm, let me see.

76
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,078
- Greetings sir. - Greetings.

77
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,404
Being a Sunday also, you did come?

78
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,409
Unni sir, I was listening
to your class from outside

79
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,373
It's quite interesting to hear.

80
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,478
Haven't you been for a long
time writing several scripts...

81
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:46,606
...and running after
directors to make film.

82
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,580
Would we be able to see your name
on the screen anytime in the near future?

83
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:58,239
Brother Narayanan, accomplishing dreams
is like breaking a big rock!

84
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,075
Strike with a hammer once,

85
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,374
twice and thrice.

86
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,737
Perhaps the rock might
break at 50th strike.

87
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,576
If one were to ask how the rock broke..

88
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,744
Can you say it was the
50th strike that broke it?

89
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,742
One day... One day"
Any rock will break, brother Narayanan!

90
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,040
On that day you will
read on the big screen.

91
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,541
Story, Screen play,
Dialogues - Unni Mukundan

92
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,038
Hello!

93
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,437
Who?

94
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,712
Director David Paul?!

95
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:37,542
Really?

96
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,211
Moving to the room, ah?

97
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,007
Not in ICU, right?

98
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,348
I will do one thing.
I will reach there in an hour's time,

99
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,205
after going home, ok?

100
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,713
Don't get tensed unnecessarily.

101
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,544
Just think you took rest for a day.

102
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,703
Illness doesn't know that
you are a big director.

103
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,303
"Health is Wealth" isn't said casually!

104
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,173
If no Health, then even becoming
an American President is a waste.

105
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:07,302
Hmm, give.

106
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,305
Do you remember
presenting me with an award last year, Sir?

107
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,171
Havel done such unjust act?

108
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,010
Treating poor tribals, isn't that awful?

109
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,510
Sir, it's your wife! I
told her all is fine!

110
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,974
What is wrong with me?

111
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,976
I just fainted! That's all!

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,146
You don't tell this to your father
and mother and tense them up.

113
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,145
Needn't rush to the hospital now

114
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,672
No..I'm perfectly alright.

115
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,774
I will give the phone to Doctor.
Talk to her.

116
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,976
Then, you will believe, isn't it?

117
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:40,975
It is my wife!

118
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,513
Hello ma'am. I'm Dr. Sridanya

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,974
ls Director David Paul in this room?

120
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,475
Yes, and you?

121
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,145
His close friend!

122
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,475
Hello..

123
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:55,145
Sir

124
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,973
You? What are you doing here?

125
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,077
Isn't this my native, sir?

126
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,143
I also came to know that you are here!

127
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,081
Because of your insistence
I moved you here from the Casualty.

128
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,041
As I already said, you
are a well known figure.

129
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,643
If visitors keeps coming in..

130
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,104
- I'm not a visitor. - Then?

131
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,771
I'm a Screen play writer

132
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,238
whoever you may be, this
is a hospital room!

133
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,205
Sir, do you know him?

134
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,111
- L.. - Of course he knows!
Unni..Unnimukundan!

135
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,647
Doctor, you are wanted.

136
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,441
Oh God! Has he reached?

137
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,441
Don't talk much.

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
Just press the bell in case of emergency.

139
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:31,770
OK.

140
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,238
Around 4.30, all your results will come.

141
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,447
Then decide about the discharge.

142
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,043
If possible, try to be
conscious till such time.

143
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,247
- Sorry.. - Ensure that you don't doze off

144
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,606
- Oh ok! - I will take care of that.

145
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,238
That is also decided!

146
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,202
Tell me.

147
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,737
Why did you come here?

148
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:00,204
In.

149
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,207
Speak up.

150
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,605
For narrating a story!

151
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,741
I have been seeking your appointment
for quite some time now...

152
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,046
If I could narrate that story now“.

153
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,601
Here?

154
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,737
In hospital?

155
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,071
Don't you have any common sense?

156
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,073
You are also perfectly
alright, isn't it, sir?

157
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,741
Falling ill would have been better...!

158
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,671
Don't talk so!

159
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,068
Come on spite it out.

160
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,205
Spit out those inauspicious words!

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,410
Even othenlvise, no harm
will come to you, sir

162
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,412
You are the one who has given us many hits
and turned many artists into Stars!

163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,412
Your old copious stories narrated
to me earlier don't suit my taste!

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,409
But this one will taste super, sir.

165
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,711
Why so? Is it a comedy?

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,571
No.. No.. Sir..all that is already being
made by Siddique Lal and Sreenivasan!

167
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,713
I'm just a simple Unni(small) Mukundan!

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,377
Asmall story..Very small
story is in my hand!

169
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,376
Had this gift of gab been in your script,
you would have done a film long back!

170
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,047
It exists, sir! It is
there in my script, Sir!

171
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,539
You read it, you will understand.

172
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,173
And there is a time for
everything, isn't it?

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,539
Certainly! I too meant that only.

174
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,179
Today is not the ideal time for that.

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,678
Today is Sunday! Even
God rests on this day!

176
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,671
That nobody whispered a story
into God's ear while he rested

177
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,671
is not mentioned in any
sacred books, right?

178
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,378
Get up.

179
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,541
A
Em

180
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,005
Me! - Then, me?

181
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,339
0k, I will get up and go.

182
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,775
In the next three years,
I will be doing just 3 films.

183
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,506
And all there screenplays
have also been finalized!

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,337
Then what is the need
for me to listen to your story?

185
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,340
If you think, you can
take this as a project!

186
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,138
Your are Producer.. a Distributor,

187
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:51,339
If you could get this done by a young
Director you trust, it will surely rock!

188
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,107
Sir, still..

189
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,507
No Still..l don't know how to be
more rude than this.

190
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:01,634
Please.

191
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:02,977
...Leave!

192
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:05,970
Please!

193
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,314
When directors like you and film stars,

194
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,613
ignore listening to our
story and sending us back,

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,978
you fail to remember one thing.

196
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,310
That we also possess Self respect.

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,778
...Emotions etc!

198
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:37,475
And furthermore,
waiting for a happy news on our return,

199
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,610
are anxious wife, children,
father and mother...!

200
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,277
Didn't you ask me, why am
I after you constantly?

201
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,080
That was because of love for your films!

202
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,271
Along with business,
there is also an in it!

203
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:25,736
Shibu

204
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,140
Did you see a man walk out from my room?

205
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,141
Yes sir...with a bag

206
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,641
Bring him to me as soon as possible.

207
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,444
Tell him, I called him.

208
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,773
- Don't miss him at any cost!
- 0k sir. You rest!

209
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:39,241
Why are you standing out?

210
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:42,039
- Didn't a writer come to see me? - Yes

211
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,237
I was a bit rude to him.

212
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,238
In fact I didn't mean to do that..

213
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,241
Hmm B.P..B.P!

214
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,544
Only after he walked out, did I realize
the gravity of that situation!

215
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:59,010
There were times
I had also carried a bag and walked behind,

216
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,405
film stars!

217
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,406
Aworst struggling period of my life!

218
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,408
Good that you called him back.

219
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,203
If he is not that big a bore,

220
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,538
then no harm in giving a ear
to him for a while.

221
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:10,706
Come.

222
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,537
- Sir! -Yes come.

223
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,713
Keep the phone with you.
Give me the calls from home only.

224
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:19,711
Please sit.

225
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,511
- I'm going. Call me if
there is any need. - Okay.

226
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,213
Sir is perfectly alright now.

227
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,380
Even after listening to your story,
he must remain the same, ok.

228
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,211
All the best!

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,479
Why so much passion for Cinema?

230
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,374
Aren't you a College lecturer?

231
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,440
Cinema is not anything like interacting
with 50 - 60 Students in a Classroom.

232
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,169
Cinema is for writing our dreams..

233
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,606
...Expressing our protests,

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,174
...sharing philosophy and reality in life

235
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,977
Sir, making a good cinema is like speaking
at ten thousand stages, isn't it?

236
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,680
Then, don't delay..Begin.

237
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,478
Goddess! Bless..

238
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,475
Sir..

239
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,479
Story unfolds in a hospital.

240
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,437
Buddy, here comes the doctor"

241
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,635
Please sign this.

242
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,778
One of you, go with her.

243
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:50,770
Dude! I will go.

244
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,537
There is heavy internal bleeding.

245
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:15,112
If anybody needs to be immediately
informed, we would recommend that.

246
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,281
I hope you understand its seriousness!

247
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,408
We don't say No ..Still chances are bleak.

248
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,737
Keep praying. 0k.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,499
2 MONTHS BACK

250
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,478
2 MONTHS BACK

251
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,075
Stop it.

252
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,236
When rehearsal is called for,
you all go for other jobs

253
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,539
Even kids born yesterday
will play better than you.

254
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,372
Season of Church Festival
is round the corner

255
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,081
If you do not intend to be beaten by the
Committee people, better practice well!

256
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,545
Listen!

257
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,343
- Call me after reaching! - Hmm.

258
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,442
Bless me, granny.

259
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,340
All things will be fine, son!

260
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,208
Amalu, Pray...

261
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,340
Protect my son O Lord!

262
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,203
- Practice well and come - 0k, Master.

263
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:12,506
Master!

264
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,507
- Keys. - You leave.

265
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,502
- Is it time to leave?
- Hmm

266
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,647
Where are you going? Amalu...

267
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,211
Hey, Shekar do come over.
How long have I been calling ..

268
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,208
Remove paddy from the front yard..

269
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,303
Has this to be told?

270
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,338
Son, day after tomorrow is her marriage..

271
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,475
- Don't create troubles...
- I need to speak to her and leave

272
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,314
Son, you came so early..
Marriage is the day after

273
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,371
Everybody leave this place for two minutes

274
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,213
Right from childhood both
have been great friends..

275
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,075
But as he is going to Ernakulam
for some official work

276
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,541
He will not be there on the wedding day..

277
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,775
Oh No! That is awful..

278
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,369
Let us all leave the place..

279
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,476
Hey.. I will be outside"

280
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,612
I never expected that you would do this..

281
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,112
Someone so loved cannot be murdered
just because they ditched..

282
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,505
Remember that when the knot is being tied..

283
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,041
I am pained..

284
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,276
That does not mean I will be thinking
about this all through..

285
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:50,268
See..

286
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:54,574
Once I leave this room you
will become a memory...

287
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,678
Just a memory..

288
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,510
Son...

289
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,676
The boy is a doctor..from
a renowned family..

290
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,147
When the alliance came,
she did not object"

291
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:21,671
Then even we...

292
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,243
I know you are pained..

293
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,681
Consider it is for the good of both...

294
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,638
"Did the girl whom I wished
to see for a moment,

295
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,479
disappear from my eyes"

296
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,239
"Did the girl who came
with me like a breeze,

297
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:49,970
forget the way?"

298
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:57,278
"She goes away like a story"

299
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:04,983
"Her sweet songs spread pains"

300
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:12,278
"Like the petals of a wandering breeze,

301
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:19,983
Why is she in this path?
,Ails it to say goodbye?"

302
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:27,142
"The paths vanished by
some fingers of shadow,"

303
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:34,380
"In this moment when a dear lamp goes out."

304
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:36,112
Would it rain?

305
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,610
Might not be, Savithri..

306
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,246
It could be the tears of that boy!

307
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,581
"Did the girl who was with me
for everything without a word,

308
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,406
forget speech?"

309
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:02,172
"Did the girl who threw a
thousand dreams in my heart,

310
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,745
forget the story?"

311
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:12,242
"She will wear bangles"

312
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,575
"Paths will vanish with her footprints."

313
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:27,208
"Like the honey drop of a dissolving song,"

314
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,745
"Small birds will now wake up slowly"

315
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:42,211
"By the wings of breeze,

316
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:49,542
dawns are adorned with chillness"

317
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,181
If she can forget you, then even you
could do it in return

318
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,774
Brother Krishnan has through somebody
arranged for a job..

319
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:09,546
Not a job.. a support being provided
to impoverished children

320
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,246
Anyway hold on for two or three months..

321
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,705
Even though you do not enjoy it...

322
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,740
Son, being and interacting with
people is the best medicine...

323
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,474
...to step out of any problems..

324
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,103
The best prayer..

325
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,240
Where the hands are, goes the mind

326
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,269
Where the mind is, goes the expression

327
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:33,344
Where the expression is, goes the mood

328
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,102
Great!

329
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:36,734
Tomorrow you will be awesome!

330
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,011
Cucumber have two uses

331
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:42,978
Ah ah.. so cool..

332
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:45,408
Hey Vinu...

333
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,011
Who is it?

334
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,008
- Brother Krishnan again..-Brother is it...

335
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:51,677
Brother Krishnan.. this is Vinu..

336
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:55,148
Yes.. after getting off the bus,
he had called but hasn't reached

337
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,069
Here..

338
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,140
Brother Krishnan.. let him reach

339
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,475
We will turn him around..

340
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,679
The moment he steps in here,
the change shall begin..

341
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,976
For that we have made some
special arrangements.

342
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,080
- Is itAmal? -Come in..
The door is not shut..

343
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,078
Lets give him a sweet jolt..

344
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:40,442
- Hello...-Step forward child“.

345
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:44,976
Hellooo..

346
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,773
"Oh boy! Come to my home"

347
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,446
"Step into my home and take on me"

348
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,076
What madness is this?

349
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:05,674
Dude.. we know your problems..

350
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,673
Just to have you be out of
that we did this photoshop..

351
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,239
Not Photoshop... Flashmob..

352
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,044
That is what.

353
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:12,975

Amal.

356
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:18,003
Come over..

357
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,174
Dude..This is your room

358
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,510
Our room is this too..How is it?

359
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,011
You are tired after travelling.
Take a bath and then sleep well..

360
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,544
The main item will be introduced tomorrow.

361
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,309
Wondering who is that?

362
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:34,572
Consider this to be forest..

363
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,173
We are like the small animals.
Rabbit, squirrel..

364
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,746
But there is a king here..

365
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,641
That is Le..on... Lion..

366
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,136
Block Buster.. Block Buster..

367
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,208
Whatever you do is a blackbusten.

368
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,107
These people have to just set the tune..

369
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,141
What it takes is to write
the lines to match"

370
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,536
Block is gone.. Block is gone..

371
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:23,543
You came and my life's Block is gone..

372
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,704
Ha ha.. 0k..

373
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:29,071
Block is gone.. Block is gone..

374
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:33,341
You came and my life's Block is gone..

375
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,614
Wow.. Wow...Will Vayalar write like this!

376
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,110
If Allu Arjun's fans hear
this, they will hammer you".

377
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,409
If I offer to write“ then no opportunities

378
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:43,771
You do not notice" this instant poet.

379
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,513
Cinema has changed, technology
has changed.. all have changed

380
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,474
But your this dry stuff
has remained the same..

381
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,704
In that case make a 4 line song and sing...

382
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,510
I will sing..

383
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:52,337
Here listen...

384
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:53,341
Hear the starting lines...

385
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:58,242
With a quintal of laughter.. came a girl..

386
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,345
As a 10mb package with a
smile she took a swirl..

387
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:03,674
How is that!

388
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,344
What is this with a quintal and shovel..

389
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:07,137
Is she into some construction business?

390
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,680
For that you need to have "updation"..
That is what you don't have..

391
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:12,637
Ye..Amal.

392
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,308
Amal last night you arrived
pretty late, didn't you?

393
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:18,309
I, by 11, even if a tsunami hits, am flat..

394
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,138
By the way he is a big artist.

395
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:22,046
- Na Kutty Varayalveli..
- It is not Vayyaveli (trouble)...

396
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,611
- That you may become soon..
- You Get lost..

397
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,313
Narayanan Kutty that is the full name

398
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,077
It was Nazir Sir who
shortened it to Na Kutty..

399
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,979
Varayalveli is the name of my village..

400
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,307
All the dubbed Tamil, Telugu movies
that are released here

401
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,036

This week's Nana (a cine weekly)
carries everything in detail"

407
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:47,645
Take your time and read it..

408
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,740
It is completely made up..

409
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,671
He was a stupendous associate
director in Madras..

410
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:52,636
Not like that.

411
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,480
With the likes of Bharatan, Padmarajan,
Arvindan, Adoor Gopalakrrr..

Ohh.. he will say“.

414
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,741
The dude has made a song about
your current situation"

415
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,578
Which song?

416
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,440
- Tell him that.
- Not able to recall..

417
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,978
"In the world of resigned love
I stood as the chieftain.."

418
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,278
Parent became Goondas.. Gunda. Gunda..

419
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,275
Will the court punish if
I kill him at one slap

420
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,413
Hey Gunda Gunda Gunda..

421
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,112
Stop--

00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,708

00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,405
With a heavy payment.

429
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:34,373
I will die if I see that money..

430
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,144
What is that product?

431
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,969
Must be something that
people don't want to buy..

432
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,646
First, you see my acting and be envious..

433

Where the eyes are, are the hands

505
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,272
Where the hands are, is the mind

506
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,206
Where the mind is, is the expression

507
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,107
Where the expression is, is the mood

508
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,074

This is Prosperous Bead Chain..

520
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,241
Husband's uncontrolled
drinking was my problem..

521
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,777
At a time when I had no idea what to do..

522
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,541
I came to know about this
Prosperous Bead Chain..

523
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,474
- Who are you?
- We are Rahul's friends..

524

- Where is Rahul? - He
would be somewhere around.

525
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,377
One night I kept this Prosperous bead Chain
under his pillow“

526
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,046
From the next day changes
started being noticed.

527
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:52,573
From that day till date he
has not touched alcohol..

528
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,041

My friends used to tease
me as moustache less

558
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,977
Thus when I was down and depressed
the use of this Prosperous Bead chain,

559

matter she has to say?

00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:23,645
My parents are not divorced..

583
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:25,740

better act and leave..

This is "Touch of Love"! Father does this
Charity for the underprivileged".

Thrashings first and then the reasons
for your coming would be asked!

705
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,241
What do you wish to become in Cinema?

706
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,606
To enjoy life a little,
We need some MONEY...MONEY

707
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,308
Look Kavitha,

708
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,044
if I become me a Nivin Pauly
then won't all be fine?

709
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:00,110
What? Nivin Pauly?!

710
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,973
Yes, Nivin Pauly!

711
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:05,215
With a leg in a plaster cast as he stood
in queue to meet Vineeth Sreenivasan..

712
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:08,641
This Nivin Pauly was an ordinary
person like this Rahul!

713
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,638
But he knows acting!

714
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:12,272
Oh! Phooey!

715
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:13,975
Remember one thing.

716
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:17,113
Just because you like Shahrukh khan's
Character names in Cinema

717
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,112
Only for you..l changed my
rocking name V P Vibheesh

718
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,037
to Rahul!

719
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:23,678
You forget it..

720
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,206
O Come on, Rahul!

721
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:29,279
Anyways, when can my daddy meet your daddy?

722
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,078
Can surely meet!

723
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:34,606
You know, he is such a busy man.

724
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,074
Needs to be on land!

725
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,074
Always flying?

726
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,610
Flying and flying!

727
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,438
Always up in the air!

728
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:42,241
Do you understand?

729
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,780
- Where is it? - Look there.

730
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,769
Keep enough money for a bottle!

731
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,407
What is the use of calling him Pop?
He is never on the ground!!

732
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,580
Okay!

733
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,970
Okay I agree your daddy is busy!

734
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,738
But one day, my daddy will surely
visit your home!

735
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,408
Oh God! What happened?

736
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,147
Well, ask your daddy to give
a call before visiting!

737
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:17,037
What for?

738
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:19,736
When daddy visiting home for the 1st time,

739
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:21,577
shouldn't l surprise him?

740
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:24,038
Oh! So sweet!

741
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,371
Love... Is it an original one?

742
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,747
Yes, sir. Play and check it out...

743
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:33,736
- Would like to have something? - No sir.

744
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:37,373
Sir, Can I use the washroom, please?

745
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:38,739
- Bathroom...? - Please.

746
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:40,736
Thank you, sir.

747
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,037
Over there!

748
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,140
Switch is on that side!

749
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,538
Bulb will not glow.

750
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,701
Oh Jesus

751
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,702
- Yes! -Good morning, sir.

752
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,008
At mid noon!

753
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:10,277
Sorry sir!

754
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,275
I'm going to introduce a
slipper for preventing...

755
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,779
...the 24 types of
arthritis found in India.

756
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:17,340
Wow fantastic! ls there such a slipper?

757
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:21,346
Yes sir! That is this slipper
from Amritha Organic Life!

758
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:23,512
Here sir.

759
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,008
Looks splendid isn't it, sir?

760
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,339
What is the cost?

761
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,509
- Hey stand there. - Hello Cd!

762
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,304
Slipper.. Hey CD"

763
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:50,143
Hey stop there or I will call the police.

764
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:51,979
Hey..you..

765
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,145
Which father of your's is a Policeman?

766
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,138
Hey you..

767
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,772
What happened, son? Got Stomach ache?

768
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:15,312
Want to go to the toilet?

769
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,478
My house is close by.

770
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:17,475
You get lost!

771
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:18,475
Get away? Where to?

772
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:19,645
Get lost you!

773
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,638
What sort of a person is this!

774
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,609
Telling me to get away when
I am offering good advisel!

775
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,078
- Get away! -Yes I'm going..

776
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:27,114
Rascal who is unaware of
Swach Bharat mission!

777
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,037
So it was an excellent start to your job!

778
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,280
With a good kick!

779
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:39,105
Take this

780
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,209
Why does your face always look like
as if a wasp has stung?

781
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,107
Can make out from his face that girl
is still being carried in his heart!

782
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:49,738
Forget her, buddy!

783
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,613
I have already forgotten her!

784
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,269
Oh, as if!

785
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:55,613
If you examine history then you will see,

786
00:46:56,034 --> 00:47:00,278
in most of the case in love, ditching
is common by either of the partners.

787
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:01,438
Take a swig!

788
00:47:08,634 --> 00:47:12,241
When the willingness to forget is present,
any tragedy can be forgotten!

789
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:14,610
Take my life for instance!

790
00:47:15,634 --> 00:47:16,738
It was not my lover

791
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,740
But the one who I married
and lived with ditched me!

792
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,011
Eh! Are you married?

793
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:24,746
Yes I am!

794
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,714
Going after Cinema I married very late,

795
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,578
at Madras!

796
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,243
Once during a film shoot,

797
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:39,577
Agirl from a poverty hit Brahmin family
came to act

798
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:42,037
I was the Associate Director"

799
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:47,412
It was from an old hag who accompanied her
that I learnt about her circumstances!

800
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:49,707
I didn't let her act!

801
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:53,305
Instead promised to take good care of her!

802
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,707
But her family strongly objected!

803
00:47:57,234 --> 00:48:01,376
Some days later, myself and Johnson..
Music director"

804
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,706
Got her out of her home at midnight.

805
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:09,046
Married her...lived with her for seven years.

806
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:10,678
Then?

807
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,205
Then what, dude?

808
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,376
There was a boy whom I liked a lot.

809
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:21,212
Was a dancer boy!

810
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:22,534
Smart Q"!!!

811
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,371
In fact he was like a brother to me.

812
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,672
Used to frequent our home
calling us bro and sis!

813
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:29,012
And have food with us!

814
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,378
An enjoyable dude!

815
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:38,014
On one night, after a long
schedule of telugu film,

816
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:42,008
When I reached my home in
Madras from Hyderabad,

817
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,176
in a disgusting situation,

818
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,010
and in an intolerable environment,

819
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:54,344
He and her..

820
00:48:58,667 --> 00:48:59,975
After putting my baby to sleep...

821
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,075
I really felt to kill!

822
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:09,645
But I didn't.

823
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,144
I thought of ending my life.

824
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,502
Then I walked away aimlessly!

825
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,981
At Trivand rum, I had some Cinema Contacts!

826
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,979
I stayed there for some years.

827
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:28,979
During those times, I
craved to see my daughter.

828
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,480
Not even 3 years old
when I walked out of home!

829
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,312
When my longing grew beyond limits,

830
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,609
One day, I returned to Madras.

831
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,473
I searched at all possible places...

832
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,778
...many times.

833
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:48,780
It was all in vain.

834
00:49:53,134 --> 00:49:55,614
Greater than the void between countries,

835
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,041
grows the void between hearts"

836
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:02,274
Between the most loved ones!

837
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,778
Now tell, is your sorrow a bigger one?

838
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:13,772
Oh no! Sharing my story
I spoiled the mood of the day, didn't I?

839
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:16,447
Only he can now lift our moods.

840
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,446
Sing 4 lines from any
of Johnson's old song.

841
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,737
Begin.

842
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,571
"The tiny little songs
wept like stifled sobs"

843
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:40,082
"The misty mountain stream
searched for something"

844
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:45,246
"Seeking someone, fell quivering"

845
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:51,407
"The winds also have been
searching for so long"

846
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:57,547
"In the breeze amidst the
flowers, vanity faded away...

847
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,243
...like ripples of water
under a golden sun"

848
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:08,434
"Silence vainly sobs
for comfort in moments of despair"

849
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:19,707
"Why was there weeping like
a musician's pullorkudam?"

850
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:22,640
"The tears caressed the
cheeks of the flower"

851
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:23,704
Hey

852
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,209
Singing this bloody song at night!!

853
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,538
Why is he hollering?

854
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:29,508
To marry off whom,
are you singing this song for?

855
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:30,508
What the hell are you staring for?

856
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:31,969
What man?

857
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:34,510
Will thrash you to a pulp! Get away..

858
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:36,512
Hell with your song!

859
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:39,611
- No, Amal..Amal.. - Don't go..

860
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:40,670
No Amal!

861
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,209
Amal..Hold him...Hold..

862
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,011
Mother..Hubby, what are you resorting to?

863
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:48,612
- Mother..Come running.
- What nuisance is this!

864
00:51:49,033 --> 00:51:49,511
Stop it, hubby.

865
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:51,673
Take him away..

866
00:51:54,034 --> 00:51:54,671
Move away.

867
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,680
Hubby, listen to me. Please come

868
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:00,374
Mother, you be quiet.

869
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:01,339
Get inside.

870
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,611
Were there any fight in the World
for singing a sad song?

871
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,173
We'll even make Rimi Tomy dance!
Who the hell he is to ask?

872
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:07,345
You be quiet.

873
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,612
Dude! What you did was correct!

874
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:13,377
Group drinking in the neighborhood
is harmful for health...

875
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:15,505
...must have been
realized by that dumbhead!

876
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:16,341
Hey"

877
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,770
Enough! Go and sleep all of you.

878
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,581
If you win, you all will get
Parathas with potato curry!

879
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,344
Where are you taking these
Bengalis this early morning?

880
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,638
Boat race in Chembakara!

881
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,579
If paid 500 per head, they
will row it excellently.

882
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,978
For boat race?

883
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,479
Would you also call them
for performing Kathakali and Oracle dance?

884
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:46,577
Don't underestimate them.

885
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,570
One among this group has written a book!

886
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,140
About the life of a
Malayalee and a Bengali.

887
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:54,143
An inner conflict of a Malamgali

888
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,141
Tomorrow is the launch.

889
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:56,438
Will he pick the Jnanpith award?

890
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:58,136
In the current situation,
nothing can be confirmed...

891
00:52:58,334 --> 00:52:59,438
Drop me at the studio.

892
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:00,441
Aliyar sir will come for dubbing now.

893
00:53:00,634 --> 00:53:01,374
Of course! Come.

894
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,137
Will they all fall down?

895
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:04,772
Falling from the vehicle is fine..
Hope they don't fall from the boat...!

896
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:06,441
Except Swimming, they
know all everything else.

897
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:07,305
Why Only that?

898
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:08,443
Because there is no water in Bengal!

899
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:09,373
That is the reason they don't take bath.

900
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:11,444
Despite having water here,
you don't seem to take bath!

901
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:21,271
Got a job, is it?

902
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,113
I saw others going.

903
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,779
I was also almost leaving.

904
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,614
I came to see you, son.

905
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:33,104
You shouldn't have come and quarreled!

906
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:36,410
Mistake may be on his pan, I'm sure

907
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,576
His father was pure at heart!

908
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,405
For such kind of people,
business never suits, right?

909
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,110
His partner cheated him

910
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:50,738
Eventually he piled up huge liabilities
and breathed his last.

911
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,275
For a very meagre sum, we sold our land
and house to Church people!

912
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,080
In fact it was not sold..

913
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,410
Took over our property
to lend us a helping hand.

914
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,243
One day when we have enough money,
we will take it back Mom, he always says...

915
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:10,577
Now all the time he has only one
thought in his mind.

916
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:16,077
Instead of quarrelling and fighting,

917
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:19,241
if try to read your opponents mind..

918
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:22,741
All are innocents, dear!! Purely innocents!

919
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,078
So..

920
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,242
So please don't come there with the
attitude of quarrelling or fighting.

921
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,235
I am not alone there.

922
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:38,049
His wife is also there...and she is carrying!

923
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,206
I got little snacks for you.

924
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:46,204
Shall I leave?

925
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:14,347
Oh! I am getting darker!

926
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:19,674
Hello!

927
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:21,502
It's been quite a number of days.

928
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,508
You hardly given me any reply.

929
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,008
Hey lass!!!

930
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:27,674
At your residence or tell me your hometown.

931
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,172
I will come along with my mother.

932
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,306
There is no shortage of money...

933
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:34,309
See, I also have a bullet.

934
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,475
I'm a building contractor!

935
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,673
With 10 - 20 regular labourers!

936
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:42,577
Also owns 2 mini tipper and a Cement mixer.

937
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:45,014
I can take care of you with all comforts.

938
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,406
What is your problem?

939
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,408
Oh God! Should I begin from the start?

940
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:52,479
Hey you lass! I wish to marry you.

941
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:55,310
- Okay! You want a reply
for that, is it? - Yes

942
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,411
Then listen! Don't chase me hereafter

943
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,477
Em
a

944
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:02,145
Bacteria!

945
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,480
Eh!! Bacteria?!

946
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,680
M'
m

947
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:11,310
- Trust you know all the shops where the
distribution is to be done! -Yes bro.

948
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:35,640
Benny, it was in a certain emotional state
that I jumped in for a fight..

949
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:41,477
I was drunk and did not realize
the presence of mom and wife..

950
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:44,111
I may not last even one punch of yours..

951
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,112
Nevertheless if that could
take away your anger then

952
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:50,276
you are free to hit me right here..

953
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:52,269
Hit me till your anger subsides..

954
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,440
If you are not hitting me, then all
between us is resolved

955
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:07,271
I acknowledge that it was my mistake

956
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:09,076
Mine alone..

957
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,778
Sorry

958
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:13,612
What did you say..

959
00:57:14,634 --> 00:57:16,079
Mistake is yours alone..

960
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,078
If that was the case"
By morning you would have lost your leg..

961
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:23,245
Doesn't matter...

962
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,406
So then, let be as you say..

963
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:26,339
Doesn't matter"

964
00:57:27,434 --> 00:57:28,606
I like...

965
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,611
People who say things right on the face..

966
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:33,237
- OK then... - OK OK..

967
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:37,768
Stan the car..

968
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,408
See you then..

969
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:50,575
Let's go for the take..

970
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,408
Sir, How is it..

971
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,738
Gigantic...

972
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,746
For a mushy romantic
serial could there be a

973
00:57:58,067 --> 00:57:59,410
Better fake promo line..

974
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,409
Ain't fake...but Vengeance

975
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:05,214
My vengeance against the intellectual
serial watchers of Kerala..

976
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:07,212

This is Radhamani..

979
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,371
Any brother would want her
kind of younger sister.

980
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:18,044
Any husband would desire her kind of wife..

981
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:21,738
Any parent would look for
her kind of daughter

982
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:25,546
But no girl would wish to become her..

983
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:27,042
To be her..

984
00:58:27,234 --> 00:58:30,147
Her heart wrenching, soul stirring story"

985
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,538
"Tearful Sea Gull"

986
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:33,376

Yes.. Tell me..

989
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,374
Would you come early this evening?

990
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:42,012
This scoundrel is hosting a party"

991
00:58:42,134 --> 00:58:43,010
Going to the dance bar.

992
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:44,705
Pubbing.. Pubbing..

993
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,111
Those Bengalis got second
place in boat race!

994
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:48,107

Don't say that. You must come.

00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:53,711
My work hasn't finished..Let
me finish that first..

998
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:54,705

At 7.30 pm..

1003
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,508
Tearful Sea Gull

1004
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:02,508
Do not forget to see..

1005
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,678
OK. Super..

1006
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:04,773
Let's go for the next"

1007
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:06,670
Sir, that is all for you today"
Here Praveen is ready..

1008
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:08,505
Oh OK then"

1009
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,337
You can step in..

1010
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:11,505
- Scene No. 15 - 0k..

1011
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,111
One who loved the night rain...

1012
00:59:13,367 --> 00:59:15,347
Sir, Someone has come to meet you..

1013
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:16,341
To meet me?

1014
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:17,979
Could be Rajamouli!

1015
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:20,340
To treat me for the
success of his Bahubali.

1016
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,077
Benny give a word..

1017
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:28,677
Maximum 2 months"

1018
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,980
During that period if you
do not raise the money

1019
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,238
Then the land will have to
be returned to the factory"

1020
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,479
Rs.2 crores.. where do we
get that kind of amount?

1021
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:44,149
Isn't this land worth at least
5 times what we are due?

1022
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,479
Father, the other day when you called me,
I got down to work for it,

1023
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:50,304
What work?

1024
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,646
What is all that you are saying?

1025
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:55,642
I will let you know that
at the right time..

1026
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,771
So then let us take leave..

1027
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,302
Father, I will come with the money...

1028
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,776
Even if the law and courts
do not understand me,

1029
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,642
the Good Lord will!

1030
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:09,105
May the Good Lord understand"
May he be with you.

1031
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:10,772
Bless you..

1032
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:17,271
Will all this work out?

1033
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:21,113
If, this property handed
down the generations,

1034
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:23,444
cannot be got back,

1035
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:26,774
Then what is the purpose of
having given birth to me...!

1036
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,606
- Isn't your check up tomorrow?
- Hmm

1037
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,601
Brother Lonappan..

1038
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:48,610
Oh.. so you have come..

1039
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:49,739
How much is the currency?

1040
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,013
One Cr..plus Dollar and Ringgit

1041
01:00:53,267 --> 01:00:54,245
Biscuit 15

1042
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:55,606
How much is the Biscuit?

1043
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:56,238
It is of 500 gms

1044
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,003
So then it only seven and a half!!

1045
01:00:58,267 --> 01:00:59,245
I was told it would be ten..

1046
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:01,674
Yes..That is why Dad said he would call..

1047
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:05,413
Shey...This is the root of
the problems between us..

1048
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,578
It is me..

1049
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,408
Hadn't I asked you?

1050
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:15,247
Even if the currency is
reduced it is fine..

1051
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:16,707
The matter is between us..

1052
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:18,705
However about the gold..

1053
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,412
That I need to deliver in
Chalakudy and lrinjalakuda..

1054
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,238
That has to be 10

1055
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:26,415
Now I am leaving for Kaloor Church festival

1056
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:32,209
Then I will be at the fashion show
of Baby's Textiles..at Bolgatty"

1057
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:34,380
You come there with the stuff..

1058
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:36,977
OK then" OK..

1059
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:38,042
Get it here..

1060
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,378
Keep it inside..

When I saw the chicks here,
this poem developed in my head..

1069
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:18,174
Fortunately I got a tissue paper and
I made notes on it..

new throbbing...Dudes..

"See in your eyes a tumult"

1074
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,647
An agitation, a hallucination..

1075
01:02:38,534 --> 01:02:41,981
Heard a humming sound in your ears..

1076
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:47,574
A chaotic confusing commotion"

1077
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:48,336
Thank you Rahul..

A round of applause for Rahul..Mr. Rahul..

1083
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,705
"Did you see in your eyes a tumult,

1084
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:20,614

1088
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,543
I desired utterly butterly"

"You are the best magnet, girl,

1091
01:03:40,634 --> 01:03:42,443
In my heart, it jumps and blooms

1099
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:31,408
are the hills searched by the hunter"

"In the platter of your cheeks,

1101
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:39,240
are the cookies soaked in buttermilk"

In my song, there is the vision
off your garden of Superiorjackfruit,

1103

1112

Here brother"

1132
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:44,772
Hey pull him out..

1133
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,145
Him..

1134
01:06:46,634 --> 01:06:50,309
It is now we realize this guy's talent.

1135
01:06:51,167 --> 01:06:51,770
Hold him..

1136
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:55,781
This is the kind of Amal
that I promised to Nakul

1137
01:06:56,133 --> 01:06:56,770
Who Nakul?

1138
01:06:57,134 --> 01:06:59,307
Hey Nakul is sitting here.

1139
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:01,375
Nakul?

1140
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:02,773
That is brother Na Kutty..

1141
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:04,442
Dance..

1142
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:05,772
Brother, you said you would come, and..

1143
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:07,112
- Who said that?
- Didn't say?

1144
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,779
Did I tell you, I will come?

1145
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,614
Since 8 pm I am...

1146
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,108
...sitting here.

1147
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:17,274
Wherever you go, haven't I told you
to leave the key here?

1148
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:17,775
Where is the key?

1149
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,112
Brother we...

1150
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:19,778
He has the keys

1151
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,336
We had called you over..

1152
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:24,411
Is it a must for me to
come wherever you call?

1153
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,409
Did you listen to what I had said?

1154
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,409
Brother is actually tanked up now..

1155
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,738
Tomorrow when he gets sober we will talk..

1156
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:32,341
Are you the ones who
decide whether l am sober?

1157
01:07:32,534 --> 01:07:34,275
I am not living at your expense"

1158
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:36,573
a
a

1159
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,671
He is fully fit! Come lets go home..

1160
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:43,510
That is not it..

1161
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:44,745
Hey this way..

1162
01:07:45,267 --> 01:07:46,746
Oh the house has moved westwards.

1163
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,376
Someone might've shouted at him!

1164
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,046
Brother Na Kutty.. we had called you

1165
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:14,642
Leave"

1166
01:08:22,234 --> 01:08:23,542
Anything to drink?

1167
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:38,213
Dude.. Sometimes like this...
That volcano may erupt sometimes

1168
01:08:38,367 --> 01:08:41,075
Go and sleep

1169
01:08:42,234 --> 01:08:42,507
Come.

1170
01:09:00,034 --> 01:09:01,274
- Benny..- Don't be scared.. It is me..

1171
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:02,445
I have been standing aside for a while...

1172
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,509
- I need a help of you..-What help?

1173
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,508
Come..Come..

1174
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:07,678
Tell me, what is it?

1175
01:09:08,034 --> 01:09:08,512
There..

1176
01:09:10,034 --> 01:09:11,240
You need to adjust this here for a while..

1177
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:13,003
This is not safe at my place..

1178
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,178
Benny... this..

1179
01:09:14,434 --> 01:09:15,310
Where is all this from?

1180
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:17,012
Burgled..

1181
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,241
The guy who drove us to this state"

1182
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,175
I broke his car's window and took this..

1183
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,475
By then the driver came running..

1184
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,645
He chased me for some distance"

1185
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,408
He has spotted my autorickshaw

1186
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,011
But nobody will come here in search..

1187
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,009
Nothing will happen to you..

1188
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,978
However ..

1189
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,411
I cannot do this without
informing others here.

1190
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:40,975
Not a single soul must know..

1191
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:41,644
Even a single soul..

1192
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,638
Just for a week would be enough..

1193
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:48,213
After a few days we will have a child..

1194
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:53,281
That child must grow up in my own
house is the biggest desire..

1195
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:54,645
That is why..

1196
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,637
Hmm come..

1197
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:17,438
Here..

1198
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:25,271
There..

1199
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:40,242
Wouldn't you take it within a week?

1200
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:41,412
I will come..

1201
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:55,574
When I get drunk, I lose control".

1202
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,110
It has been like that always..

1203
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:01,112
The fight between us took place
solely because of me...

1204
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:03,243
That you know and I know..

1205
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,080
Yet you came to me and apologized

1206
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:09,211
When I got this bag, I was oven/vheirned"

1207
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:12,748
Who within my sight could
I trust and hand over..

1208
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:17,076
It was only your face that
showed up in my mind..

1209
01:11:20,601 --> 01:11:22,740
From now on Benny would be a new man..

1210
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:30,737
I will be back..

1211
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,038
Drink this water...

1212
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:54,177
You keep thinking unnecessarily..

1213
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,173
Something has happened to him,
my mind is saying mom..

1214
01:11:57,367 --> 01:11:59,711
Remember there is a little
one inside you now...

1215
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:02,338
Don't stress yourself up and harm it..

1216
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:04,041
Drink...

1217
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:07,343
Hadn't he called in the evening too?

1218
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:39,506
Been to the toilet...

1219
01:13:44,234 --> 01:13:45,611
Would you have a cigarette on you?

1220
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:50,442
The fear of lungs becoming like sponges
has made me not to smoke..

1221
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,075
In that case lets have some coffee..

1222
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,278
That is better"

1223
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:16,044
If the chutney were less spicy,
it would have been really yummy

1224
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,408
Without being yummy this
is the fifth dosa..

1225
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,974
As if It is spicy...!

1226
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:25,268
Sister"

1227
01:14:26,034 --> 01:14:27,240
Ah who is it? Tendulkar?

1228
01:14:27,534 --> 01:14:28,638
Mom asked me to hand this over..

1229
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:32,044
Ah. Let mom knowl thank her..

1230
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,578
So, no thanks for me..

1231
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,041
Why? As if you got this from America...!

1232
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:37,144
Go.. go and study.

1233
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:43,012
- That.. that.
- What is it.

1234
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:47,113
Sister, do you see stuffs like these?

1235
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:52,376
Aah..

1236
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:56,703
What is the sound I heard there, Anu?

1237
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:59,240
Nothing...Just hit a cockroach here..

1238
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,637
That is all..

1239
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,377
It is time for a second visit
by the pest control man.

1240
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,706
Go and show it to your mom..

1241
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:20,080
HE will take you from the evil
and save you from calamities

1242
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:23,009
With HIS clothes HE will protect you

1243
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,613
You will find shelter under HIS wings..

1244
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:28,614
HIS trust will be your armour and weapon...

1245
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,445
Benny.. Benny..

1246
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:34,271
What is it Shafiq?

1247
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,578
Where is he, sister?

1248
01:15:35,767 --> 01:15:36,245
He hasn't come yet..

1249
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:38,445
What is it?

1250
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:41,774
Tomorrow morning any time
ask him to come to the station.

1251
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,443
What is it? What is the matter?

1252
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:45,614
Sister just tell him to come
in the morning itself..

1253
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:47,439
Carry on with your prayers..

1254
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,074
From there we move to...

1255
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:55,409
How is the story telling going?

1256
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,409
- We are half-way through"
- Sorry.. My shift is over..

1257
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,781
Being Sunday, I have some patients at home...

1258
01:16:02,134 --> 01:16:04,705
This is Dr. Tony. I have
briefed him in detail.

1259
01:16:05,434 --> 01:16:06,003
Nothing to worry..

1260
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:07,577
You could go home today itself...

1261
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,403
Thank you Doctor"

1262
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:10,739
Never got the feeling that
I was in a hospital..

1263
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,078
So we shall meet again..

1264
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,247
That anyway must not be at the hospital

1265
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,547
- May you remain healthy always
- Thank you very much Doc..

1266
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:19,141
So then..All the best"

1267
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:24,742
Let the story telling continue"

1268
01:16:27,434 --> 01:16:28,777
Continue with the rest..

1269
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,578
One evening...

1270
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,504
This is my destiny"

1271
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:46,516
That was my last lottery to seize back
all that I had lost...

1272
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:50,045
To go in search of him..

1273
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,646
May not have gone to Madras,
as we could search there...

1274
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:57,213
Then, where else do we search?

1275
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,380
Nobody in this world can cheat us..

1276
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,479
Let go.. The more you
think, more the hurt.

1277
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,471
Watch out for people who
speak a lot of philosophy..

1278
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,745
People who convince well are
the ones who cheat well..

1279
01:17:16,734 --> 01:17:19,340
Hasn't all this in front
of us been made by man?

1280
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:25,505
If I sincerely work hard
all that I lost can be got back one day".

1281
01:17:30,367 --> 01:17:32,711
So then each one of us on our own..

1282
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:34,675
Everything else should be
wiped out from our mind..

1283
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,370
- Why are you running?
- Leave“

1284
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:37,069
Aren't you a police officer's daughter?
Kick me..

1285
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,647
- Why should a police officer's daughter
fear to kick...? - Leave me..

1286
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,173
I will stand here. Kick me.. Kick..

1287
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:43,644
We will kick you..

1288
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,105
What is it makes you hold girls hand?

1289
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:47,174
- Hold her again!- If you
have the guts hold her..

1290
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,638
Give him two solid ones..

1291
01:18:49,001 --> 01:18:50,446
Brother l did not intend to harm her..

1292
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:52,443
Then.. is it to put henna
that you catch girl's hand?

1293
01:18:52,634 --> 01:18:54,011
- Hold her again...!
- Hold..

1294
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:54,609
Brother I..

1295
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:56,280
- Honestly I .. I saw her here..-What.

1296
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:58,276
Brothers. We are friends..

1297
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,538
We were having fighting for a fun

1298
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,269
Till now was your tongue all tied up?

1299
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:04,276
Just to spoil our day.. Get lost..

1300
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,070
Wasting time behind this girl...!

1301
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,137
- From where do these wastrels come from?
- Could have given a solid one on the cheek!

1302
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:23,248
Hey.. hello... hello..

1303
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:26,974
Sorry.. Really sorry..

1304
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:29,372
Walking on my same route
with the bag strung on...

1305
01:19:29,434 --> 01:19:31,072
...will result in no
business for both of us..

1306
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,401
That is why the other day I..

1307
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,136
So.. will you kick?

1308
01:19:34,767 --> 01:19:36,144
A policeman's daughter!

1309
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:40,246
That was just a ploy to survive..
Take it just that way..

1310
01:19:40,434 --> 01:19:43,074
But then if someone holds my hand.
Then I may kick or beat"

1311
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:45,176
That is not my fault. it is the fault
of the place from where I hail..

1312
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:48,777
Which place is that?
Kannurulritty to be precise“.

1313
01:19:49,267 --> 01:19:51,577
Oh ok.. so you are from my place

1314
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:53,746
Near that there is a
place called Payyanur..

1315
01:19:54,101 --> 01:19:55,102
There is nothing like this

1316
01:19:55,601 --> 01:19:58,207
- Are you joking?
-Wow...

1317
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,036
- What is your name?
- I am Anu..

1318
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,271
So, do not take it to the heart.
Wipe everything off...

1319
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:08,644
How about a coffee.. Filter coffee..

1320
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:09,370
No.. no..

1321
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:13,613
After all I kicked" We
hail from the same place...

1322
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,447
Sir.. that driver boy.. from Tamil Nadu..

1323
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:28,310
I had told that bandana wearing dumbhead
several times not to move from the car..

1324
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,777
Then, he had to peep at
the fashion parade..

1325
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:32,544
See what happened..

1326
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,736
My Rs.2.50 crores is gone..

1327
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:38,172
The portrait is being drawn..
We will pick up the guy..

1328
01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:44,171
- It is our MLA.. -OK pick the phone..

1329
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:46,007
Hellooo..

1330
01:20:46,334 --> 01:20:47,711
- Isn't SI Sir there?
- What is the matter?

1331
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:49,045
He had asked me to come.

1332
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,235
SI is confident of catching
the person immediately

1333
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:53,071
Sir..

1334
01:20:53,334 --> 01:20:55,007
What more to say? Our hard times..

1335
01:20:55,367 --> 01:20:57,574
Gold, Dollar, Ringgit all were there..

1336
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,007
- Rs, 2.50 crores of asset is
what is gone.. - Sit there

1337
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:01,641
That hair needs to be altered a bit..

1338
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:03,069
A
a

1339
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:07,238
One person is drawing the portrait.

1340
01:21:07,734 --> 01:21:08,576
He will be caught for sure..

1341
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:13,581
If I get hold of him there will be
fireworks on him by me..

1342
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,142
Yeah.. ya...

1343
01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:18,241
EU
a

1344
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:21,342
- Sir?
- Sir..

1345
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:23,607
This is the Benny I was mentioning"

1346
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,144
- Bakery items..- Got it, sir

1347
01:21:26,367 --> 01:21:27,368
100% he is the one..

1348
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,610
He is the ASI here..

1349
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:31,973
Has five bakeries on the Vytilla
- Chenala road.

1350
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:34,541
Run by his father-in-law.

1351
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:38,146
If you could supply some items regularly
wouldn't that be good?

1352
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:38,607
Yes..

1353
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,204
So with the intention of connecting
you both, I called you here.

1354
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:46,147
<i>Devan exchange your numbers...</i>

1355
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,310
- Why aren't you lit up?
- Nothing..

1356
01:21:57,134 --> 01:22:00,115
Helloo..Your face seems familiar to me...

1357
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,407
He is my neighbor..

1358
01:22:04,734 --> 01:22:08,614
- Where have we met?
- We have not met..

1359
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,537
- It is ready, Sir..
- Bring it here..

1360
01:22:11,734 --> 01:22:13,304
- So let me take leave..
- What is the hurry?

1361
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,240
Sit there..

1362
01:22:16,134 --> 01:22:17,204
- Is it similar?
- What?

1363
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,175
- Does it match?
- Correct sir!

1364
01:22:22,634 --> 01:22:23,374
Who is it?

1365
01:22:29,467 --> 01:22:30,639
Are you sure this is the guy?

1366
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,980
- With certainty, sir!-Yes.. for sure..

1367
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,081
Hey you cattle headed..scoundrel..

1368
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,544
Where did my money go? Tell the truth...

1369
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,410
Was it KP Ummer (Actor)who flees the money

1370
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,069
Separate them, Stay apart..

1371
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:03,071
Sir, I am leaving

1372
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:10,079
This is a police station"

1373
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:15,308
When one is staying alone
in such big towns,

1374
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:18,414
a
ism

1375
01:23:18,567 --> 01:23:19,443
I throw it on them that
he is in the police..

1376
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:20,772
That doesn't cost much either..

1377
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:22,511
How long is it been..

1378
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:25,409
- God promise.. this has been made today“
-I was speaking to him...

1379
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:30,049
- Has it been some days?
- Just a few days I'm getting fed up!

1380
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:32,214
Fed up! What is the product?

1381
01:23:33,067 --> 01:23:36,173
It is a Priest's devotional song DVD.

1382
01:23:38,234 --> 01:23:38,712
See..

1383
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:40,178
"Touch of Love"

1384
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,402
- I am not doing this as a job..
- Then...?

1385
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:49,272
- I'm screwed up. I do this
to get out of that! -What...?

1386
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,305
Not for salary!

1387
01:23:51,467 --> 01:23:52,241
That sounds great.

1388
01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:55,510
In that case, if I get this sold would
you pay me the commission?

1389
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,209
Just accompany me with that bag..

1390
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,340
Ea

1391
01:24:01,634 --> 01:24:02,237
<i>Yes, Combo'.!</i>

1392
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:04,013
First of all do I have your
word about my commission?

1393
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,304
If yes I will have that
sold like hot cakes..

1394
01:24:09,034 --> 01:24:10,012
If you are not interested then let it be..

1395
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:11,511
I kicked you unknowingly

1396
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,010
Moreover we are from the same place.
So thought of helping out.

1397
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,180
- It is ok.. Here keep it..
- No.. I am interested"

1398
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:19,348
E
Em

1399
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:27,409
Come.

1400
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,480
- Devotional songs..
- No thank you..

1401
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:34,977
- Then take this anti arthritis sandals..
- I don't have arthritis

1402
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:40,980
We sell these two products for the charity!

1403
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,978
Oh is it? Then I'll bring the money

1404
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:45,509
Move fasten.

1405
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,138
Don't you want to sell all this ..

1406
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:49,176
You will need to be smarter
to do the selling..

1407
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,416
"With someone, with whoever"

1408
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,450
"Like a new time when shores unite"

1409
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:13,381
"Birds sang in the heart is someone near'

1410
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,446
"Has she come sweetly near"

1411
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:17,612
Isn't that awesome?

1412
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:18,770
"And walked beside"

1413
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:22,307
"Whenever I see my friend near me,"

1414
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:25,038
"Did she come with me talking"

1415
01:25:26,634 --> 01:25:29,274
"I went to unseen places
who has come close"

1416
01:25:29,467 --> 01:25:33,074
"To search for feathers
in the magical wind"

1417
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:41,116
"Whoever, like colours"

1418
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,510
"Join in these paths, in the eyes."

1419
01:25:46,434 --> 01:25:47,606
The tea is hot..

1420
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,506
0k then Cheers

1421
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:54,305
Your pale face is gone,
now you become too smart, ok!

1422
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:07,308
"Who has come close, near my heart"

1423
01:26:09,767 --> 01:26:15,240
"Like the new sky searched by the stars."

1424
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:24,083
"Are you near slowly with shining wings."

1425
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:29,473
"Did you walk with me
in these roaming waves of path"

1426
01:26:30,267 --> 01:26:33,544
"When I see her every day,
someone sang in my heart of hearts"

1427
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:35,705
"Who is this friend?"

1428
01:26:37,434 --> 01:26:41,712
"Distances change, speed increases,
the closed door in front disappears"

1429
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:43,374
"When we know each other"

1430
01:26:44,734 --> 01:26:51,242
"Whoever, like colours "

1431
01:26:51,734 --> 01:26:57,150
"Join in these paths, in the eyes."

1432
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:58,345
There he is..

1433
01:26:59,067 --> 01:27:01,138
- How is the combo sale going?
- My job has become easier..

1434
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,340
Great. How about alternating?

1435
01:27:03,634 --> 01:27:04,704
Mum?
a

1436
01:27:05,067 --> 01:27:07,206
One day Anu goes out selling with you,
the next day with me..

1437
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,511
What an ideal!

1438
01:27:11,134 --> 01:27:13,580
Children.. Shall I say
face read and predict?

1439
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:14,441
Future!

1440
01:27:17,134 --> 01:27:18,204
No thanks Granny...

01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:22,446
Eta

01:27:23,234 --> 01:27:25,680
But you have not expressed it.

1443
01:27:26,034 --> 01:27:26,671
A
a

1444
01:27:28,234 --> 01:27:32,410
You loved someone deeply for a long time..

1445
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:35,673
But she is no longer with you".

1446
01:27:36,034 --> 01:27:39,447
Must have got married..isn't it?

1447
01:27:42,067 --> 01:27:44,570
I will predict the rest leisurely..

1448
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,114
A bit of face reading even I have done...

1449
01:27:47,701 --> 01:27:48,679
E
a

1450
01:27:49,034 --> 01:27:51,241
Lying son.. Just to avoid me.

1451
01:27:51,434 --> 01:27:52,469
No.. Really..

1452
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,009
Granny.. you have four children..

1453

3 daughters and a son

1454
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:03,307
Your husband.. about 10 years

1455
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:06,641
No.. about 15 years back passed away..

1456
01:28:07,334 --> 01:28:10,577
Further on your stomach
there is a scar of a surgery...

1457
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:13,682
...caused by a glass
piece or sharp rod.

1458
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:18,144
Do you note children this
science does not lie..

1459
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:21,975
0k then..

1460
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:25,971
Granny..

Didn't you mention about your
youngest daughter is getting married?

I do not know how much is it.
But it is gold..

1464
01:28:39,301 --> 01:28:40,336
Good Lord..

1465
01:28:41,634 --> 01:28:42,339
So she left..

1466
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:45,744
Really you have studied??

1467
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:47,612
Of course...

1468
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,610
In that case I have a matter"

1469
01:28:52,034 --> 01:28:52,739
What.

1470
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,005
Tell me

1471
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,213
Would you help me in getting the girl
I want to marry?

1472
01:28:57,634 --> 01:29:02,049
- Which girl? - The girl
in that medical shop.

1473
01:29:04,134 --> 01:29:05,613
A

1474
01:29:05,801 --> 01:29:07,610
Best" A real match"

1475
01:29:09,634 --> 01:29:12,171
Not that girl.. the girl beside her...

1476
01:29:13,267 --> 01:29:13,745
That damsel..

1477
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,570
I go there daily and buy something"

1478
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:20,214
How much ever I smile, she is serious..

1479
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,572
Doesn't even smile once..

1480
01:29:22,134 --> 01:29:24,171
- What do you buy daily?
- Vicks lozenges..

1481
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:26,540
A <i>We</i>
E

1482
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,101
Nonsense...!

1483
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,635
So what do we do?

1484
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,580
A
Ems

1485
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:33,075
Yes.. Rest I will take care of..

1486
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:34,579
Let me see..

1487
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,572
Daily if you buy the same thing
why should she smile!

1488
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,135
Change track"

1489
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,203
Here..

1490
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:51,010
- Will it work? - No guarantee.
Give it a try"

1491
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:00,205
Excuse me..

1492
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:02,545
Yes.. Is it Vicks?

1493
01:30:02,767 --> 01:30:04,610
No..Doctor has prescribed an alternative...

1494
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,236
- Ruby.. here..-Yes..

1495
01:30:10,234 --> 01:30:12,214
Ruby.. Nice name

1496
01:30:12,567 --> 01:30:14,604
Do you really read faces?

1497
01:30:15,134 --> 01:30:18,707
No.. That granny had told me
her entire story two weeks back..

1498
01:30:19,067 --> 01:30:21,479
Being one among the many she shares with
she may not have recalled..

1499
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:24,338
I was all wondering.. what performance...

1500
01:30:24,767 --> 01:30:26,769
Some surgery on the stomach caused
by glass shreds or rod.. some scar...

1501
01:30:27,134 --> 01:30:28,135
and all the craps.

1502
01:30:29,067 --> 01:30:30,273
Leave that.

1503
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:35,977
When she mentioned about that deep love
from your past, I noted the face..

1504
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:43,037
How many do you want? Whatever is needed..

1505
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:43,507
Shall I take one strip? Sure..

1506
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:46,238
Is the medicine a good one?
Definitely it is the best!

1507
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:48,512
A
a

1508
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:50,236
A mild one, possibly!

1509
01:30:50,434 --> 01:30:53,506
A
a

1510
01:30:53,734 --> 01:30:56,044
All the clothes being used need
to be boil washed..

1511
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:56,507
Boil..

1512
01:30:56,734 --> 01:30:57,405
Why so?

1513
01:30:58,700 --> 01:30:59,405

1514
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:01,146

1515
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:03,646
- How much?
- Rs.121.00

1516
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:06,673
- Don't you have something cheaper?
- No..

1517
01:31:07,334 --> 01:31:09,177
There is only one medicine here
for your worm infection“

1518
01:31:09,534 --> 01:31:10,103
For what".

1519
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,210
Worm infection!

1520
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,202
Come... come... come..

1521
01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:16,770
- Take the bag and come - Don't run...

1522
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:17,703
Stay put..

1523
01:31:18,034 --> 01:31:19,240
He will pay you the money.

1524
01:31:20,801 --> 01:31:23,145
Run...Remember that is your last run..

1525
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,010
Scum bags..

1526
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:27,145
Now how will look into these people's face!

1527
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,673
Just that the prescription
got interchanged..

1528
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:48,478
I never thought you would be doing this..

1529
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:49,475
<i>Poor guy--</i>

1530
01:31:59,467 --> 01:32:00,036
Who is it?

1531
01:32:00,234 --> 01:32:01,042
- That is my father..
- Oh..

1532
01:32:02,167 --> 01:32:05,114
- Today it was at Kannamally..
- Tomorrow we have a show in Alapuzha..

1533
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:09,672
On my return was thinking of
surprising you with a visit

1534
01:32:10,701 --> 01:32:12,442
Now it is me who got a surprise..

1535
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,211
Ails
a

1536
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:16,441
She is my friend, Dad.

1537
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:17,338
Working together?

1538
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:18,270
- No..
- Yes.

1539
01:32:20,467 --> 01:32:22,447
Two companies and two offices..

1540
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:23,702
But we work together"

1541
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:28,978
Could be the generation gap...
I did not get what you said..

1542
01:32:29,734 --> 01:32:33,614
- No.. Dad.. We.. -Ah..
Your friend isn't she?

1543
01:32:34,801 --> 01:32:35,336
Hi Amlu!!

They are all from our troupe..

1545
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:43,546
On our return even if it is late night
we will step in to your place..

1546
01:32:43,801 --> 01:32:46,407
A
a

1547
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:52,075
Dad.. How about a cup of tea..

1548
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:54,645
No son.. we just stepped
into Indian Coffee House...

1549
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,603
Must be about 10 minutes"

1550
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,569
See you then..

1551
01:32:59,634 --> 01:33:00,169
Let's move..

1552
01:33:03,634 --> 01:33:05,636
- Shey..
- What...?

1553
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:07,976
What would have father thought?

1554
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,177
What is it for you, if he thinks anything!

1555
01:33:11,467 --> 01:33:12,605
After all it is your father thinking"

1556
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:15,137
He would have felt very happy

1557
01:33:15,334 --> 01:33:16,142
Still..

1558
01:33:16,334 --> 01:33:17,312
Come on...

1559
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,443
If you sit with this anymore,
I will not bother whether I will be hit..

1560
01:33:19,634 --> 01:33:20,772
I will give you one kick..

1561

Film Director Revathi Menon

1564
01:33:27,467 --> 01:33:28,537
What have I got to do there?

1565
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:30,371
- Just for a moral support..
- Na..

1566
01:33:30,567 --> 01:33:31,443
Don't say na.

1567
01:33:31,634 --> 01:33:34,774
If I were to get a character in her movie
all my problems would be solved..

1568
01:33:35,134 --> 01:33:36,340
For that my coming...

Here one guy has gone mad..
That is the thing"

1589
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:27,378
It would be a specific kind of madness
that one gets from co-residents..

1590
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:28,545
Hello...Hello..

1591
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,480

01:34:31,734 --> 01:34:35,079

to a film director's home..

1593
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:36,072
Begging for a chance...

01:34:36,267 --> 01:34:38,247

- Hey.. what is going on here?- Nothing"

1600
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,342
Then why are you standing here?

1601
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:00,042
Are you from this house, Son?

1602
01:35:00,234 --> 01:35:00,712
If so..

1603
01:35:01,234 --> 01:35:02,542
Brother would you help me?

1604
01:35:03,234 --> 01:35:05,714
- Take your hands off...-
Just asked for a help

1605
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:06,442
What?

1606
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:07,712
You do study in college?

1607
01:35:09,734 --> 01:35:12,340
Then you will require quiet some money..

1608
01:35:12,534 --> 01:35:14,036
Money.. Money..

1609
01:35:18,534 --> 01:35:19,035
Where is it?

1610
01:35:19,234 --> 01:35:20,042
Somewhere in this lane..

1611
01:35:20,234 --> 01:35:21,269
I used to have a girl here..

1612
01:35:21,467 --> 01:35:22,002
Then, where is it?

1613
01:35:22,234 --> 01:35:23,679
There is the board.. Stop"

1614
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:27,343
Will the security permit?

1615
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,509
That is all easy...

1616
01:35:30,201 --> 01:35:31,646
Who do you think I am?

1617
01:35:31,701 --> 01:35:33,339
Who is it? What is it?

1618
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:35,002
Who is it? What is it?

1619
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,010
If these two questions were not discovered
security people would have gone jobless!

1620
01:35:39,201 --> 01:35:41,010
Who are you? That is my question"

1621
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,008
Are you new here?

Have got fed up with the people
coming daily seeking a chance..

1627
01:35:56,034 --> 01:35:57,638
Lousy guys...! Sir, you come in..

1628
01:35:58,034 --> 01:35:59,172
It was not you... come..

You need not come.. We will ring the bell.

1630
01:36:05,201 --> 01:36:06,646
After all my dear sister"

1631
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,138
- How was it?
- What?

1632
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,480
Acting means it must be natural.

1633
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:13,639
Acting is not reacting"

1634
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:16,147
It is behaving“ you know?

1635
01:36:17,434 --> 01:36:20,643
I will show how Revathi
Menon can be enticed"

1636
01:36:27,667 --> 01:36:32,980
if I had said for a chance,
the security would not have allowed".

1637
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:35,976
So, please Madam..

1638
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,373
Hmm 0k.. Now leave..

1639
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:38,612
So.. chance?

1640
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,775
See, I was writing relaxedly..

1641
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:42,771
Only if there is a script
can there be a chance..

1642
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:44,612
- Have you got photograph of yours?
-Yes, I have“

1643
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:45,774

- Oh Non-What is it!

1646
01:36:50,634 --> 01:36:51,772
That is how everyone says, Madam..

1647
01:36:52,134 --> 01:36:53,112
But no one calls..

1648
01:36:53,467 --> 01:36:54,775
You must treat me as a special case..

1649
01:36:55,134 --> 01:36:58,604
If I had been your relative wouldn't
you give me a chance in your movie?

1650
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,608
Are you crazy?

1651
01:37:00,134 --> 01:37:01,340
<i>Do you know Gram; Aunty'.!</i>

1652
01:37:01,634 --> 01:37:02,169
Hey"

1653
01:37:02,367 --> 01:37:03,607
She is the wife of my mother's brother...

1654
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:05,109
It was an intercaste marriage!

1655
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:05,606
How do you know her?

1656
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:07,109
Is this guy mad?

1657
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:12,172
Madam, I have seen your film
"Raw Mango" about 10-16 times

1658
01:37:12,367 --> 01:37:13,573
My brothers are upstairs.

1659
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,780
Do you leave on your own or do I call them?

1660
01:37:16,434 --> 01:37:17,777
Madam, why are so getting angry?

1661
01:37:18,134 --> 01:37:19,238
I am not here to burgle..

1662
01:37:19,434 --> 01:37:19,571
What??

1663
01:37:19,801 --> 01:37:22,247
Hey.. Let's go.. Madam said she will call.

1664
01:37:22,434 --> 01:37:23,412

Let's go.

1668
01:37:28,367 --> 01:37:29,744
Madam. May I say one more thing, Ma'm..

1669
01:37:31,367 --> 01:37:33,404
You.. Please wait outside for a minute..

1670
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:34,579
Just a minute..

1671
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:35,741

- Screen Test..- Oh...!

1674
01:37:43,234 --> 01:37:44,212
What is your intention?

1675
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:47,314
Madam you are now a well known
writer and producer..

1676
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:48,136
So..

1677
01:37:48,334 --> 01:37:50,575
Even I know a little about cinema..

1678
01:37:50,767 --> 01:37:51,541
What do you know?

1679
01:37:52,567 --> 01:37:54,205
If you would not tell anyone..

1680
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:56,745
If you would not tell anyone...

1681
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,545
I am ready for any adjustments.

1682
01:38:00,734 --> 01:38:04,204
You rascal..scoundrel..Get lost!

1683

Bloody country"

Inside...inside..

Don't run..Stay there.

1692
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:22,111
Don't leave him. Stop"

1693
01:38:22,301 --> 01:38:23,371
- He is gone.. - Hey!

1694
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,047
Oh no.. Amy has brought her dad..

1695
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:51,014
This is Father Katikatfs Ashram.

1696

I come here twice a month,
to hand over the cheque..

1697
01:38:53,534 --> 01:38:54,274
Awesome place, isn't it?

1698
01:38:54,534 --> 01:38:56,138
Absolutely..isn't it an Ashram?

1699
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:58,006
From now on..

1700
01:39:02,367 --> 01:39:04,005
She is making quite some money..

1701
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:07,304

You know, we are selling Fr.
Kattikattu's songs..

And you did not tell me you teach here..

1706
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:22,010
If I tell all the surprises in one go..

1707
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:24,147
Life would be bland as a poached egg!

1708
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,309
Small surprises still remain..

1709
01:39:28,267 --> 01:39:29,644
I wouldn't be telling you that.

1710
01:39:30,001 --> 01:39:30,638
You will get to know is due time..

1711

Go ahead.. Children are waiting"

from far away come down"

from far away come down"

1716
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:52,281
"Did the magic whisk in
the heart blow slowly"

1717
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:58,982
"Did a lotus bloom in
the honey of the eyes"

1718
01:39:59,467 --> 01:40:05,611
"Did the tunes of the unending pains
dissolve as poems of tears"

1719
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,440
"Who came as the chillness sung by rain?
Is it she?"

1720
01:40:12,634 --> 01:40:19,779
"Who is like the breeze and
shade hereafter? Is it she?"

1721
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:26,779
"As we searched for a lovely feather,

1722
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:34,019
we lost ourselves in the time
we didn't see each other"

01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:40,173
"Who came as the chillness sung by rain?
Is it she?"

1724
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:47,784
"Who is like the breeze and
shade hereafter? Is it she?"

1725
01:40:49,434 --> 01:40:50,572
Don't pull it off!

1726
01:41:19,234 --> 01:41:25,742
"You came hesitatingly like
a breeze of banyan leaves"

1727
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:32,709
"We waited for each other
with a tune unsung"

1728

1732
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:51,708
Like a fruit within reach"

"Did the shining star
from far away come down"

"Who came as the chillness sung by rain?
Is it she?"

1736
01:42:12,201 --> 01:42:18,982
"Who is like the breeze and
shade hereafter? Is it he?"

1737
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:25,981
"As we searched for a lovely feather,

1738
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:33,085
we lost ourselves in the time
we didn't see each other"

1739
01:42:33,334 --> 01:42:39,512
"Who came as the chillness sung by rain?
Is it she?"

1740
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:47,141
"Who is like the breeze and
shade hereafter? Is it he?"

1741
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:53,975
Are you guaranteeing no arthritis?

1742
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:54,975
Sure Sir..

1743
01:42:55,167 --> 01:42:55,474
Yes Sir..

1744
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:58,648
None of the 24 types of arthritis
seen in India will affect"

1745
01:42:59,101 --> 01:43:04,107
Moreover Amritha Organic Life's
Ramzan offer of Rs.400 only

1746
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:06,775
So you wouldn't be interested?

1747
01:43:07,134 --> 01:43:08,477
I need.. But

1748
01:43:08,667 --> 01:43:11,648
Before I buy I will ask
you some questions..

1749
01:43:12,134 --> 01:43:14,273
If you answer them correctly then

1750
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:18,643
These sandals and these songs
I will buy 10 of each..

1751
01:43:20,134 --> 01:43:20,635
Shall I ask?

1752
01:43:22,134 --> 01:43:22,635
Hmm.

1753
01:43:23,067 --> 01:43:27,447
What is the cause of this
arthritis orjoint pain?

1754
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:28,607
That..

1755
01:43:29,301 --> 01:43:29,608
Eh He...

1756
01:43:33,134 --> 01:43:35,614
No point in walking around with this
bag on your shoulders...!

1757
01:43:36,134 --> 01:43:39,741
You must have a minimum knowledge
about the products that you are selling..

1758
01:43:40,634 --> 01:43:42,272
Leave.. Leave..

1759
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,073
Sandals for arthritis!!

1760
01:43:46,634 --> 01:43:48,079
If you get the answer will
you stand by your word?

1761
01:43:49,467 --> 01:43:54,075
Puthedathu Abdul Salam Haji has
one father and one word..

1762
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:56,612
Eh. You know..

1763
01:43:58,034 --> 01:43:58,444
Let's hear the answer..

1764
01:44:03,267 --> 01:44:05,747
Joint pains or Osteo-arthritis...

1765
01:44:06,101 --> 01:44:09,014
There is soft tissue between the joints
to avoid friction..

1766
01:44:09,267 --> 01:44:11,747
In medical science it is
called the cartilage"

1767
01:44:12,101 --> 01:44:15,708
The wear and tear of this cartilage
is the beginning of osteo-arthritis.

1768
01:44:16,433 --> 01:44:21,246
Age, Obseity, lack of exercise
and many other factors can cause this..

1769
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:25,240
Joint replacement is the only
cure, remedy and treatment...

1770
01:44:25,434 --> 01:44:28,745
...for along term
freedom from Osteo-arthritis

1771
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:30,409
Is this enough?

1772
01:44:35,234 --> 01:44:37,976
That is not the way.. That
is not at all the way..

1773
01:44:38,234 --> 01:44:39,212
Arthritis is not caused that way..

1774
01:44:39,434 --> 01:44:41,209
Then how is it? If you know, let's hear..

1775
01:44:42,001 --> 01:44:44,208
Once you got the answer
do not avoid the issue...

1776
01:44:47,234 --> 01:44:47,712
a
a

1777
01:44:48,067 --> 01:44:49,205
- Are we going to be beaten up?- No..

1778
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:50,708
Yes... Grandpa..

1779
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,705
Come down..

1780
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,673
- Did I guess right? Should we leave.?
- Hmm

1781
01:45:00,567 --> 01:45:01,602
Tell her..

1782
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,778
She is a doctor...

1783
01:45:03,234 --> 01:45:05,214
Rig ht now your fraud will be discovered“.

1784
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:09,111
What is this.. with a big bag?

1785
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:12,381
I am into a bit of charity"

1786
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:13,545
This is my friend..

1787
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:14,676
To help..

1788
01:45:15,034 --> 01:45:17,173
Oh Allah.. I was really shocked..

1789
01:45:17,801 --> 01:45:20,543
Mom.. She studies with
me in Medical College..

1790
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:26,341
Oh I see. You are studying to be a doctor"

1791
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,006
Who is this you said?

1792
01:45:29,801 --> 01:45:32,338
I am a resident of an Ashram.

1793
01:45:32,534 --> 01:45:35,174
Madam accompanies us as a volunteer.

1794
01:45:36,034 --> 01:45:36,637
Charity"

1795
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:37,644
Oh..

1796
01:45:39,534 --> 01:45:42,344
Zulfath...two lemonades..

1797
01:45:45,367 --> 01:45:47,347
You girls are a store of suspense...!

1798
01:45:47,767 --> 01:45:49,644
What if you had told me
that you were studying for medicine?

1799
01:45:53,367 --> 01:45:55,347
Can we sit for a while? My back is aching..

1800
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:00,302
Hmmm..

1801
01:46:01,334 --> 01:46:03,507
Do you recall the calamity in lritty?

1802
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:05,305
A land slide..

1803
01:46:06,534 --> 01:46:08,070
I was in Std. 6 then..

1804
01:46:09,001 --> 01:46:11,777
I was returning back home from Kannur
after winning a prize for dance...

1805
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,738
...in the district school festival

1806
01:46:14,334 --> 01:46:20,307
Nearing homel noticed rush ambulances,
fire fighting and police vehicles,

1807
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:22,981
Howling and wailing..

1808
01:46:23,734 --> 01:46:28,308
When I reached my home
there was no house on that spot..

1809
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:34,115
Without leaving behind even a photograph
of my parents and younger brother

1810
01:46:34,734 --> 01:46:37,476
The disaster took away
everything coolly from my life..

1811
01:46:39,134 --> 01:46:41,478
Then for the next two
years was with my aunt.

1812
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:44,614
When they started treating me like a maid..

1813
01:46:45,301 --> 01:46:48,544
I wept in front of the sisters
of the convent where I studied"

1814
01:46:48,734 --> 01:46:50,042
Promised them that I would study well..

1815
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:57,281
It is the vacation time before my final
year in Trichur Medical College.

1816
01:46:57,467 --> 01:47:00,107
Once my classes begin, then this job
will be only on Saturdays and Sundays..

1817
01:47:00,267 --> 01:47:03,111
This work gives you the freedom and
also the necessary income

1818
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:05,105
A bit of tongue wagging is enough..

1819
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:09,271
To tell everything right at
the initial acquaintance

1820
01:47:09,467 --> 01:47:11,276
is not possible for a
certain statured people..

1821
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,280
A human being needs to have an intellect"

1822
01:47:14,467 --> 01:47:16,071
Inside that intellect must be a being..

1823
01:47:16,301 --> 01:47:17,746
This is what the Mothers
who taught me say..

1824
01:47:23,267 --> 01:47:24,575
Is the share marketing over?

1825
01:47:24,767 --> 01:47:25,245
Share marketing?

1826
01:47:25,467 --> 01:47:27,743
Both of you share from the marketing"

1827
01:47:28,434 --> 01:47:30,573
- Come get in.. - Come!

1828
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:33,007
I will get in the front..

1829
01:47:34,434 --> 01:47:35,071
Get in fast"

1830
01:47:35,267 --> 01:47:36,075
Getting in aren't we!

1831
01:47:37,434 --> 01:47:38,742
Yes, move.

1832
01:48:03,734 --> 01:48:05,407
- See you then! - Bye!

1833
01:48:05,734 --> 01:48:06,712
Will give you a call!

1834
01:48:12,734 --> 01:48:13,166
Got it?

1835
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:13,542
Got it?

1836
01:48:14,234 --> 01:48:16,214
Be patient..Since how long...!

1837
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,378
Not lifting yet?

1838
01:48:18,067 --> 01:48:19,045
Keeps on calling!! - Hello!

1839
01:48:19,234 --> 01:48:20,042
Hey Amal..

1840
01:48:20,234 --> 01:48:21,508
I reached.. You cut it

1841
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,509
0k then.. See you tomorrow.

1842
01:48:29,067 --> 01:48:30,375
Hmm.. What is it?

1843
01:48:30,701 --> 01:48:31,509
What happened..

1844
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,202
Amal..eh..

1845
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:46,680
Hey.. do not create a scene..

1846
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:57,612
Do you know what is the
consequence you gave?

1847
01:48:58,034 --> 01:48:59,342
Do you know the deception you did?

1848
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:00,338
I know..

1849
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:02,012
I know it well.

1850
01:49:02,367 --> 01:49:07,180
That is exactly why, despite
my circumstances, I came..

1851
01:49:08,501 --> 01:49:10,174
To hand over that bag and go..

1852
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,470
That day when all of you had been
to the bar and returned late..

1853
01:49:19,667 --> 01:49:23,581
For not leaving the key here do you
recall I had behaved beyond control“.

1854
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:26,345
Since 8 pm I am... sitting here.

1855
01:49:26,601 --> 01:49:29,138
Wherever you go,
haven't I told you to leave the key here?

1856
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:32,311
Have I ever before behaved
like that with you?

1857
01:49:33,667 --> 01:49:35,146
That was a terrible day..

1858
01:49:37,334 --> 01:49:38,369
<i>W?</i>
a

1859
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,978
Sir, Somebody has come to meet you..

1860
01:49:41,167 --> 01:49:42,305
A
a

1861
01:49:42,567 --> 01:49:43,307
Who could it be?

1862
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:52,439
Haven't I told you about her?

1863
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,304
After I left they were
somewhere in And hra or so.

1864
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,110
For all the distress I have caused you,

1865
01:50:06,334 --> 01:50:08,610
I have been punished by God..

1866
01:50:11,301 --> 01:50:14,282
That is why my daughter is like this now..

1867
01:50:17,301 --> 01:50:21,113
My daughter is now about 20 years old.
A big girl now“

1868
01:50:21,534 --> 01:50:24,105
She is critical and is in Vellore Hospital.

1869
01:50:24,434 --> 01:50:27,779
That some big operation is to be
done and it requires a lot of money...

1870
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,772
she cried inconsolably.

1871
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:32,104
I do not have any other way...

1872
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:35,275
...0l' means..

1873
01:50:39,134 --> 01:50:40,670
You can kill me

1874
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:43,747
but do not forget her..

1875
01:50:44,601 --> 01:50:48,071
My daughter did not cause
any trouble for you..

1876
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:50,405
Please do not forget her..

1877
01:50:55,768 --> 01:50:59,580
Though I planned to visit
the hospital and meet her..

1878
01:50:59,767 --> 01:51:02,680
I did not say any of that to them
and ordered them to leave..

1879
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:06,081
My ego did not allow me
to give any surety"

1880
01:51:06,767 --> 01:51:08,542
Stepped in to the bar
and got totally drunk..

1881
01:51:09,267 --> 01:51:10,075
Brother Na Kutty..

1882
01:51:11,101 --> 01:51:12,239
- Brother Na Kutty
- Leave..

1883
01:51:18,034 --> 01:51:19,240
A
Emits

1884
01:51:20,401 --> 01:51:21,471
I have been standing aside for a while...

1885
01:51:21,734 --> 01:51:23,714
- I need a help of you..-What help?

1886
01:51:24,067 --> 01:51:24,374
Come..

1887
01:51:24,734 --> 01:51:25,371
Come..

1888
01:51:26,501 --> 01:51:27,707
You need to adjust this here for a while..

1889
01:51:28,234 --> 01:51:30,043
Benny... this..Where is all this from?

1890
01:51:30,234 --> 01:51:31,042
Burgled..

1891
01:51:31,501 --> 01:51:32,707
However I cannot do this without
informing others here.

1892
01:51:33,067 --> 01:51:34,205
Not a single soul must know..

1893
01:51:34,501 --> 01:51:36,708
I want to get my daughter back to life.

1894
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:39,344
Want to do everything possible for her.

1895
01:51:39,734 --> 01:51:41,543
I realized that destiny was possible.

1896
01:51:42,067 --> 01:51:46,038
Othenlvise why would someone
who has been at loggerheads with us,

1897
01:51:46,467 --> 01:51:48,708
would come here asking for
a bag to be kept safe...!

1898
01:51:51,067 --> 01:51:51,670
Money...

1899
01:51:53,067 --> 01:51:54,341
is not just paper.

1900
01:51:55,234 --> 01:51:57,214
It being available is a
kind of confidence..

1901
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,341
It sometimes can hold an ebbing life..

1902
01:52:02,234 --> 01:52:05,010
I did take about Rs. 12 lakhs from that.

1903
01:52:05,534 --> 01:52:07,343
For returning that I will
ask some time from Benny..

1904
01:52:07,534 --> 01:52:09,013
Are you going to face Benny?

1905
01:52:09,467 --> 01:52:10,502
What else!

1906
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:13,014
Like the confession I did here,
don't I owe one there too..

1907
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:17,180
And then I got to leave at the earliest.

1908
01:52:18,034 --> 01:52:19,172
If could catch the Mail...

1909
01:52:19,701 --> 01:52:21,180
...then I can reach in the morning itself..

1910
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:23,009
Near my daughter.

1911
01:52:25,201 --> 01:52:25,679
You please..

1912
01:52:27,034 --> 01:52:28,012
...Forgive me..

1913
01:52:28,201 --> 01:52:29,475
Come on, bro!

1914
01:52:38,034 --> 01:52:38,478
Sister"

1915
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:40,978
Yes..

1916
01:52:42,001 --> 01:52:45,414
Mother's father is not well.

1917
01:52:45,667 --> 01:52:47,169
So parents have gone to Thodupuzha..

1918
01:52:47,501 --> 01:52:48,411
I am alone at home..

1919
01:52:48,667 --> 01:52:49,577
So..

1920
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,302
Two of my friends would be coming

1921
01:52:51,667 --> 01:52:53,408
We will be playing music at high volume.

1922
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:54,645
Just to dance..

1923
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,411
So what is needed of me?

1924
01:52:56,667 --> 01:52:58,647
Please do not let my parents know...

1925
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:02,278
When your grandfather is unwell,
right time for you to dance...!

1926
01:53:03,301 --> 01:53:04,974
0k 0K..l am not telling anyone..

1927
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:06,441
Thanks sister"

1928
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:15,278
This money is something
I had considered lost..

1929
01:53:16,634 --> 01:53:19,774
If you had not comeback with it,
what would I have done?

1930
01:53:20,634 --> 01:53:21,772
Where would I search?

1931
01:53:22,801 --> 01:53:24,781
Where do I get you?

1932
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:29,782
You are going to your
daughter is what you said..

1933
01:53:31,634 --> 01:53:34,615
So you will need money..won't you?

1934
01:53:37,634 --> 01:53:40,444
Here.. take what you want"

1935
01:53:44,367 --> 01:53:45,402
Not as a loan.

1936
01:53:47,634 --> 01:53:50,240
But for that child who is destined to live!

1937
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:10,241
One, Two, Three.. Five.. Seven..

1938
01:54:10,434 --> 01:54:11,242
Isn't it 0k, Son?

1939
01:54:11,434 --> 01:54:13,345
Brother" I am really scared,
do not create any problems...

1940
01:54:13,601 --> 01:54:14,238
Make it fast"

1941
01:54:14,434 --> 01:54:17,210
I just want to tell her a few
things personally.. That is all..

1942
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:18,572
Go and sit cool..

1943
01:54:18,767 --> 01:54:19,575
Still..

1944
01:54:19,767 --> 01:54:22,213
Ain't I giving you the promised amount?

1945
01:54:22,601 --> 01:54:24,740
Go and open up the music at a high volume..

1946
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:25,738
Go.. Man...

1947
01:54:29,101 --> 01:54:31,741
"Fish curry and its wisps of aroma,

1948
01:54:32,101 --> 01:54:35,742
Breeze from the hills and its chillness.."

1949
01:54:38,534 --> 01:54:39,444
Brother, when would you return?

1950
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:40,975
Won't say when!

1951
01:54:41,234 --> 01:54:42,212
But shall return soon..

1952
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:45,205
What is it?

1953
01:54:45,467 --> 01:54:47,208
Have been calling you several times.
Why aren't you picking up the calls?

1954
01:54:47,468 --> 01:54:49,038
Oh! I was there with the neighbours..

1955
01:54:49,234 --> 01:54:50,110
My phone was kept in here..

1956
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:51,780
Anu has left her bag in the car..

1957
01:54:52,634 --> 01:54:53,442
Will she need anything from it urgently?

1958
01:54:53,634 --> 01:54:55,204
That does not matter..l
will call and let her know.

1959
01:54:55,467 --> 01:54:56,070
Will return it in the morning..

1960
01:54:56,801 --> 01:54:58,439
This is JK. We work together.

1961
01:54:58,634 --> 01:54:59,772
He does mention about you.

1962
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:01,074
Thanks for coming.

1963
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:04,440
We were in fact looking to hire an auto for
taking brother Na Kutty to the station"

1964
01:55:04,634 --> 01:55:06,443
- Would you mind?.. - Come let's go.

1965
01:55:06,634 --> 01:55:08,443
- We will also come..
- Not necessary.

1966
01:55:08,634 --> 01:55:10,079
So late in the night now,
are we going for a march?

1967
01:55:10,267 --> 01:55:11,769
- You all go and sleep.. - Come bro.

1968
01:55:12,201 --> 01:55:13,077
0k, brother"

1969
01:55:13,434 --> 01:55:14,071
OK then.

1970
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:42,746
Don't be scared... Don't be scared..

1971
01:55:43,601 --> 01:55:45,137
Hey. I just came to meet you.

1972
01:55:45,434 --> 01:55:45,969
You.. leave this place..

1973
01:55:46,167 --> 01:55:47,145
I want to marry you..

1974
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:48,139
I told you, I ain't interested"

1975
01:55:48,434 --> 01:55:49,037
Don't say that.

1976
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:51,043
I do not want to listen to anything...
Step out of this place first.

1977
01:55:51,234 --> 01:55:53,043
Why are you hollering this way?

1978
01:55:53,767 --> 01:55:54,575
Just remain quiet..

1979
01:55:54,767 --> 01:55:55,575
You .. leave right now..

1980
01:55:55,767 --> 01:55:57,041
Don't keep shouting this way!

1981
01:55:57,401 --> 01:55:59,210
For who to hear are you shouting like this?

1982
01:56:03,167 --> 01:56:03,975
Stop..l will not do anything"

1983
01:56:04,167 --> 01:56:06,977
Hey girl! Just want to
speak a little with you..

1984
01:56:07,167 --> 01:56:09,204
Open the door dear..l
will not do anything"

1985
01:56:09,567 --> 01:56:10,705
Open

1986
01:56:16,567 --> 01:56:18,774
Why the hell are you creating a scene!

1987
01:56:19,168 --> 01:56:20,374
What else should I do if
you are so inconsiderate"

1988
01:56:23,234 --> 01:56:25,544
In your house do people walk into girls
room in the night to talk about marriage?

1989
01:56:25,734 --> 01:56:27,372
Stop squealing and open the door..

1990
01:56:27,534 --> 01:56:29,013
Get out!

1991
01:56:34,134 --> 01:56:37,013
I told you I wanted to
speak a little with you..

1992
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:38,008
I am leaving now..

1993
01:56:38,434 --> 01:56:41,711
But one day I will take you..You wench..

1994
01:56:55,134 --> 01:56:56,169
I will call you after reaching..

1995
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:57,974
OK then brother"

1996
01:56:58,367 --> 01:56:59,675
- 0k..-See you..

1997
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:01,974
- Brother" - Hmm.

1998
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:04,146
...you wouldn't be alone
next time when we meet?

1999
01:57:07,167 --> 01:57:10,671
Do you know why God has given us fingers?

2000
01:57:11,534 --> 01:57:14,140
So that people who move
away can be held together.

2001
01:57:16,701 --> 01:57:17,509
I take leave..

2002
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:18,976
- See you J K Hmm.

2003
01:57:38,167 --> 01:57:39,145
Again you are running away...

2004
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:42,481
Where are you running to? Stop there...

2005
01:57:43,334 --> 01:57:48,044
Open the door..Better open the door

2006
01:57:48,334 --> 01:57:49,312
Open the door...

2007
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:51,777
WEE
m

2008
01:57:52,134 --> 01:57:53,272
Open the door...

2009
01:57:54,301 --> 01:57:56,281
Whose funeral are you
conducting sitting inside?

2010
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:58,774
There.. the bag's owner is calling..

2011
01:57:59,301 --> 01:57:59,779
Must remembered now..

2012
01:58:00,134 --> 01:58:02,114
We can hand it over now itself..
Aren't her place close by?

2013
01:58:03,467 --> 01:58:04,775
- Hello... - Oh no!

2014
01:58:06,134 --> 01:58:06,635
Hello!

2015
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:09,439
You daughter of a scoundrel
where are you running to...

2016
01:58:10,634 --> 01:58:11,271
Stay there!

2017
01:58:12,067 --> 01:58:12,772
- Hello.. Hellloo.
- What is the matter?

2018
01:58:14,467 --> 01:58:15,605
Whom did you call?

2019
01:58:16,134 --> 01:58:18,114
Tell..You called your other guy?

2020
01:58:18,467 --> 01:58:22,279
Out there I had told you very very clearly

2021
01:58:22,634 --> 01:58:24,739
Then you had your godamm bacteria...!

2022
01:58:25,634 --> 01:58:29,081
Once I desire then I will have it..
That is Martin

2023
01:58:32,467 --> 01:58:33,070
Hey”

2024
01:58:34,267 --> 01:58:35,245
What is this kid?

2025
01:58:35,634 --> 01:58:37,443
Any problem with the ears?

2026
01:58:37,767 --> 01:58:38,006
Yes.. shall reduce...

2027
01:58:38,268 --> 01:58:39,611
Play the music softly"

2028
01:58:44,267 --> 01:58:48,238
Better say you will marry me..

2029
01:58:48,434 --> 01:58:50,573
Otherwise the scene will be damaging..

2030
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:55,570
Stop raising your voice..
No goddam guy will come..

2031
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:10,408
What is this? Music world!

2032
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:12,410
Wha.. what is it brother?

2033
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,971
Anu.. she left her bag..thought of
returning it.. Would you call her?

2034
01:59:17,234 --> 01:59:18,406
She has gone out..

2035
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:21,137
Gone out? Where to?

2036
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,209
A dude came and took her out on his Bullet.

2037
01:59:25,234 --> 01:59:26,372
You call her number..

2038
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,376
No.. Need not call her..l will
hand it over.. Give it to me..

01:59:31,567 --> 01:59:32,375
Please leave..

01:59:37,568 --> 01:59:39,047
Any problem with his ears?

The music is being played at a high volume.

2042
01:59:56,034 --> 01:59:58,014
What is that? Anu!! Its Anu!

2043
01:59:59,567 --> 02:00:01,171
- What is it? Didn't l say no...
- Stand aside..

2044
02:00:01,367 --> 02:00:02,345
Move aside.

2045
02:00:04,567 --> 02:00:05,341
Leave me...Leave me I say.

2046
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:08,338
Open...Open quickly.

2047
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:10,172
People have gathered...Leave

2048
02:00:11,034 --> 02:00:12,172
Don't you understand...

2049
02:00:29,201 --> 02:00:30,339
What happened?

2050
02:00:37,167 --> 02:00:39,340
Come..Bring her..quick...

2051
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,637
Stan the car.

2052
02:00:44,767 --> 02:00:45,643
Get in quickly.

2053
02:01:23,134 --> 02:01:24,272
Excuse me...

2054
02:01:26,301 --> 02:01:27,541
The wound was deep..

2055
02:01:27,734 --> 02:01:30,715
However because of timely medical support.

2056
02:01:31,134 --> 02:01:33,444
I mean..we could do better
than what we had expected.

2057
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,440
Only after 48 hours can we
give you an official promise..

2058
02:01:37,134 --> 02:01:38,272
But I can tell you,

2059
02:01:38,601 --> 02:01:39,443
...she will be back..

2060
02:01:50,767 --> 02:01:52,747
Days later..

2061
02:01:53,300 --> 02:02:00,582
"Like the honey drop of a dissolving song,

2062
02:02:00,767 --> 02:02:07,582
small birds will now wake up slowly"

2063
02:02:08,267 --> 02:02:15,549
"By the wings of breeze,

2064
02:02:16,101 --> 02:02:22,541
dawns are adorned with chillness"

2065
02:02:23,267 --> 02:02:30,651
"Like the honey drop of a dissolving song,

2066
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:37,711
small birds will now wake up slowly"

"By the wings of breeze,

2068
02:02:46,067 --> 02:02:53,679
dawns are adorned with chillness"

2069
02:02:53,734 --> 02:02:56,510
I left home hating all
the girls of the world..

2070
02:02:57,234 --> 02:02:58,645
And see what l am doing..

2071
02:02:59,067 --> 02:03:01,513
What all does life make one do..

2072
02:03:01,734 --> 02:03:09,516
"Like the honey drop of a dissolving song,

2073
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:16,675
small birds will now wake up slowly"

2074
02:03:17,234 --> 02:03:24,516
"By the wings of breeze,

2075
02:03:25,034 --> 02:03:32,509
dawns are adorned with chillness"

2076
02:03:34,634 --> 02:03:37,478
Is this minus 4 degree that cold?

2077
02:03:38,034 --> 02:03:41,572
Sitara.. How did you pass
your degree exam! Terrible!

2078
02:03:42,034 --> 02:03:47,006
Sethu dear! However busy you are there,
do come on skype daily.

2079
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:49,645
Dear.. come here for a while..

2080
02:03:50,667 --> 02:03:51,475
What is it Mom?

2081
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:56,570
What is it Mom?

2082
02:03:57,001 --> 02:03:59,174
That Amal has come home
with a girl in town.

2083
02:03:59,367 --> 02:04:00,573
Na... Can't be..

2084
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,344
Lakshmi told me that. She saw them..

2085
02:04:04,167 --> 02:04:05,145
Now do you see..

2086
02:04:05,367 --> 02:04:06,141
That is all to it..

2087
02:04:06,368 --> 02:04:08,974
Map
mm

2088
02:04:10,668 --> 02:04:12,648
Anyway, we must know the truth...

2089
02:04:13,167 --> 02:04:16,444
After so many days of your marriage
that is one house we have not visited.

2090
02:04:16,601 --> 02:04:18,137
Now Sethu is here..

2091
02:04:18,334 --> 02:04:21,144
We can say that as a reason for our visit..

2092
02:04:21,567 --> 02:04:22,739
The reality can be known..

2093
02:04:23,334 --> 02:04:23,971
What do you say?

2094
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:26,440
Listen"

2095
02:04:27,634 --> 02:04:29,614
Sitara, her husband and all have come..

2096
02:04:30,167 --> 02:04:32,443
- Come fast - Hmmm.

2097
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:34,439
Must have come to find out who you are..

2098
02:04:36,634 --> 02:04:38,307
Don't feel offended...Brother Sudhakaran..

2099
02:04:38,634 --> 02:04:40,375
We were waiting for Sethu to be home
for all of us to come over

2100
02:04:40,567 --> 02:04:44,105
That is why our visit got
delayed and nothing else..

2101
02:04:44,634 --> 02:04:46,773
Sethu is travelling abroad tomorrow.

2102
02:04:47,134 --> 02:04:48,112
For studies"

2103
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:51,281
That is why we fixed up this
visit for today itself..

2104
02:04:52,634 --> 02:04:53,271
What do you do?

2105
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,279
Have a job in Ernakulam.

2106
02:05:06,801 --> 02:05:09,577
SaraswatL. Who is this child?
Haven't seen her before..

2107
02:05:13,601 --> 02:05:15,410
Oh.. Savitri.. you do not know yet?

2108
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,274
No.. Did not hear anything specific".

2109
02:05:18,534 --> 02:05:19,342
Why?

2110
02:05:19,534 --> 02:05:21,411
So then.. you are the only
people left to know..

2111
02:05:21,767 --> 02:05:22,404
Then listen...

02:05:24,301 --> 02:05:26,076
The girl whom our Amal
is getting married to

2114
02:05:32,767 --> 02:05:35,247
They have known each other
for about 3-4 years it appears..

2115
02:05:35,534 --> 02:05:36,740
And we are informed now...

2116
02:05:38,767 --> 02:05:39,370
Isn't it?

2117
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:44,074
Ya. Yes..yes..The children of today!

02:05:47,267 --> 02:05:50,248
To meet granny she accompanied

2119
02:05:50,501 --> 02:05:51,639

Which is the branch for PG?

2126
02:06:09,234 --> 02:06:11,373
Considering to do MD in Emergency Medicine

2127
02:06:11,567 --> 02:06:12,204

- All the best... - Thank you..

2134
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:57,173
Until then there has never been
a happier moment in Amal's life.

2135
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:02,010
- Reached"
-What.. What happened?

2136
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:05,010
Adizzy spell.. that's all.
Didn't I ask you not to come?

2137
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,612
Even if you say so, how do we not come!

2138
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,179
- Sir, Please be seated..- No Thank you..

2139

Let me meet the Doctor. You also come..

2140
02:07:14,034 --> 02:07:15,638
What is the necessity of all this!!

2141
02:07:16,201 --> 02:07:18,306
This is Unni.. a writer..

2142
02:07:18,667 --> 02:07:20,169
I was listening to a story"

2143
02:07:20,667 --> 02:07:22,237
Isn't just a bit left? Complete that..

2144
02:07:22,434 --> 02:07:26,974
As your family is here now,
my presence is an interruption.

2145
02:07:27,201 --> 02:07:30,307
That is why I am handing over
this script to you, sir..

2146
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,308
When you find time finish reading it.

2147
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:32,639
My contact number is also mentioned"

2148
02:07:34,001 --> 02:07:34,979
So be it..

2149
02:07:35,167 --> 02:07:36,145
- OK..
- OK

2150
02:07:40,001 --> 02:07:40,274
Listen"

2151
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:46,138
...one who is good at story-telling
can be a good director too..

2152
02:07:46,667 --> 02:07:48,146
So need not search for anyone else..

2153
02:07:48,467 --> 02:07:49,639
Unni, you take it on..

2154
02:07:51,467 --> 02:07:52,605
Wasn't it your dream?

2155
02:07:57,634 --> 02:07:58,977
I am serious..

2156
02:07:59,167 --> 02:08:00,441
I will produce this movie..

2157
02:08:02,167 --> 02:08:04,374
Be with you and provide all support.

2158
02:08:04,634 --> 02:08:08,605
If you cannot make a film at this age,
then when would you?

2159
02:08:11,134 --> 02:08:13,114
I will not step back from my word..

2160
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,244
Go..

2161
02:08:16,267 --> 02:08:16,768
I will call you..

2162
02:08:26,634 --> 02:08:28,113
I am on my way...

2163
02:08:28,434 --> 02:08:30,778
Dad, I was able to tell
almost the entire story"

2164
02:08:31,134 --> 02:08:32,579
What is most important is that,

2165
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,406
I have been asked to direct the film..

2166
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:37,108
Rest I shall tell in person..

2167
02:08:40,134 --> 02:08:40,578
Hello..

2168
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,738
Any chance..

2169
02:08:47,267 --> 02:08:49,076
He had not completed"

2170
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:52,081
Tale end is left.. Let's see

2171
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:59,740
Listen dear..That was the girl
who placed a rock on his heart.

2172
02:09:00,434 --> 02:09:03,210
When asked about you, all
I said was just made up..

2173
02:09:04,101 --> 02:09:06,081
She just built it up further..

2174
02:09:06,601 --> 02:09:07,375
I got it..

2175
02:09:07,767 --> 02:09:09,747
The intention of their
visit also got clear..

2176
02:09:11,334 --> 02:09:12,210
You come dear..

2177
02:09:15,101 --> 02:09:19,709
Son..lovers can sit face to
face for hours together"

2178
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:24,540
But after getting married that reduces
gradually to a point of no more..

2179
02:09:26,067 --> 02:09:27,978
When the two stop looking
at each other and...

2180
02:09:28,068 --> 02:09:30,412
...start looking together
in the same direction,

2181
02:09:31,068 --> 02:09:33,207
thinking and understanding together"

2182
02:09:34,068 --> 02:09:36,378
That is when life comes alive..

2183
02:09:37,401 --> 02:09:39,039
- Isn't that so mom...?
- Absolutely son..

2184
02:10:28,534 --> 02:10:30,013
5 minutes break..

2185
02:10:34,167 --> 02:10:35,475
Haven't I used to say...

2186
02:10:35,701 --> 02:10:39,148
When you mix a bit of realities
of life into creative imagination,

2187
02:10:39,334 --> 02:10:40,642
A story develops into a story..

2188
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:42,142
True Dad..

2189
02:10:44,667 --> 02:10:46,647
Go.. Go and tell her..

2190
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,639
By then I need to get them polished!

2191
02:11:07,667 --> 02:11:08,270
Daddy..

2192
02:11:10,301 --> 02:11:10,972
Come...

2193
02:11:16,001 --> 02:11:18,447
- Dad, could you tell the
story without seeing? -Yes..

2194
02:11:19,234 --> 02:11:21,271
When I say without seeing
then I am free to act and speak.

2195
02:11:21,467 --> 02:11:23,970
Script is just for a
strength, a confidence..

2196
02:11:24,467 --> 02:11:26,276
Hello.. Mr. Director"

2197
02:11:33,467 --> 02:11:35,447
- Hello.. -Our David sir is admitted here..

2198
02:11:35,634 --> 02:11:37,079
Who..Director David Paul?

2199
02:11:37,301 --> 02:11:38,439
Just a BP variation"

2200
02:11:38,634 --> 02:11:40,170
One who does not give appointments.

2201
02:11:40,467 --> 02:11:41,070
Want to try your luck..

2202
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:43,177
Within one hourl will be there.

2203
02:11:43,467 --> 02:11:44,241
Come quickly.

2204
02:11:45,267 --> 02:11:46,439
You finished so quick..

2205
02:11:46,634 --> 02:11:48,079
He is not interested"

2206
02:11:48,267 --> 02:11:49,610
Let me speak with him.

2207
02:11:50,101 --> 02:11:51,603
Isn't it our requirement? Please wait.

2208
02:11:51,801 --> 02:11:52,779
Why are you waiting outside?

2209
02:11:53,101 --> 02:11:54,171
A writer had come a short while back...

2210
02:11:54,434 --> 02:11:58,246
If he is not a bore, nothing
wrong in giving an ear...

2211
02:11:58,434 --> 02:11:59,572
- All the best ..
- Thank you..

2212
02:12:02,267 --> 02:12:05,077
For having held a director
back for one full day...

2213
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:08,113
...in the hospital just
for a small dizziness

2214
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:09,406
What would you give me?

2215
02:12:10,267 --> 02:12:11,575
When you extended your hand for shaking,

2216
02:12:11,767 --> 02:12:12,575
I folded my hands in greetings.

2217
02:12:12,768 --> 02:12:14,577
Let me clear that debt first"

2218
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:23,579
It is David Sir...

2219
02:12:25,767 --> 02:12:26,575
Hello Sir..

2220
02:12:26,767 --> 02:12:28,747
Trust everyone at home are happy..

2221
02:12:29,434 --> 02:12:30,412
That need not be said at all...

2222
02:12:30,601 --> 02:12:32,137
Do let everyone know l had enquired...

2223
02:12:32,401 --> 02:12:33,038
Sure..

2224
02:12:33,234 --> 02:12:34,736
A

2225
02:12:35,234 --> 02:12:37,305
I have been discharged from the hospital"

2226
02:12:38,234 --> 02:12:42,376
Do thank the doctor for all the support..
