3
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:45,716
Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee,
you have how many brothers?

4
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:47,239
Two.

5
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,418
The younger brother's
name is Devjeet Mukherjee.

6
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,241
What work does he do?

7
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,898
- I don't know.
- It is strange.

8
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,312
You don't even know what your
younger brother's job is.

9
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:07,052
Few years ago he
severed all ties with me.

10
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:13,702
What if I say that you have
created a dim atmosphere..

11
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:17,843
Around yourself because of which
all the family members hate you?

12
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:20,313
This is an irrelevant
question, Your Honor.

13
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:22,918
My qualified friend doesn't
have any right..

14
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,517
To put blemish on a decent man.

15
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,348
Objection sustained.

16
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:28,299
Proceed, Mr. Ghosh.

17
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:34,200
Do you... you know
a girl named Rosy?

18
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,956
Mr. Mukherjee, in which
thoughts you are lost?

19
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,248
- I am asking...
- Yes. I know.

20
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:46,718
Mr. Mukherjee, did Miss Rosy invest
some money in your business.

21
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,780
Yes. A huge amount.

22
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,017
Do you have any proof of that?

23
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:54,191
Documents, agreement.. pro-note.

24
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,142
Legal proceedings are not
required between friends.

25
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,943
Oh! I see.

26
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,187
Will you give introduction of
your friend to this court?

27
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,053
- Where does she stay? What does she do?
- Your Honor..

28
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:08,215
This question is irrelevant
to this case.

29
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,047
There is a deep
relationship, Your Honor.

30
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,902
I will present the stoy of Miss
Rosy's life in this court and prove..

31
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,024
That Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee, who
is a respected member of the society..

32
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,285
Is actually a fraud.

33
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,019
He is a
promiscuous. He is characterless.

34
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:28,945
I will remove the
disguise of decencry from his face..

35
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,491
And expose the true
side of his life.

36
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,374
His house has been ruined
because of the same Rosy..

37
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,032
Whom I mentioned before.

38
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:41,429
He won't give the
introduction of Rosy, Your Honor.

39
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,793
Because she is an
indecent and infamous woman.

40
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:48,604
She is a prostitute.
She is a public woman..

41
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,015
Working as a prostitute.

42
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,909
Daughter may be someone
is outside. Go and check.

43
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,827
- Greetings.
- You? Whom do you want to meet?

44
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,006
Nobody.

45
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,366
I was passing by and suddenly
it started raining.

46
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:45,471
Therefore I stopped
here. I am sorry.

47
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:47,273
Let him come inside, daughter.

48
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:49,769
Come in.

49
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,310
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

50
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,103
- My name is Inderjeet.
- Alright. Hey!

51
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:01,867
You are completely
wet. Remove your coat.

52
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:04,228
- Daughter, give his towel.
- No. No problem.

53
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,365
Alright, come here.
And sit beside the fire.

54
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,998
You sit.
I will stand there.

55
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,663
- Were you playing the piano?
- Yes.

56
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,119
The notes were very melodious.

57
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:20,833
I unnecessarily disturbed you.

58
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,506
Are you interested in piano?

59
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,966
- Yes, I have great interest...
- Then, let's... - Only to listen.

60
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,022
- Rama is interested in piano since childhood.
- Really?

61
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,964
It's not much.
I will get tea for you.

62
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,036
No. Please don't bother.

63
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,940
It won't be a problem.
And it is really very cold.

64
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,272
Do you stay here?

65
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:48,309
No sir. Actually in Calcutta we
have a stop of iron and steel.

66
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,287
I came to see an
officer regarding a tender..

67
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,296
Who came here on vacation.

68
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,439
We are also here on vacation.

69
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:58,979
Nowadays my health doesn't stay
fine. I stay home all day long.

70
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:00,885
If you get time then do come here.

71
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,221
Sure.

72
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,712
For whom are you making this tea?

73
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,893
A gentleman came. He was got
wet in the rain therefore...

74
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:10,755
He got wet in the rain so we
will have to be hospitable.

75
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,967
This is a house, house,
not a hotel.

76
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,238
Hey! Why are you looking there?

77
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:17,101
Didn't you listen?
Turn off the stove.

78
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,305
Turn it off.

79
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,998
I think the rain has stopped.
I don't want tea.

80
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:27,932
- I will go.
- Look, don't fell bad about my wife's words.

81
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,135
No, sir. It is not
like that. Greetings.

82
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,663
- Hey!
- Hey!

83
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,728
You!

84
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,125
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

85
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,394
How come you are here?

86
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,565
For the peace of mind there..

87
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,479
Cannot be a
better place than this.

88
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,199
It is such a coincidence that
our second meeting took..

89
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,891
Place in such a holy place.

90
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,207
May be so that I can
apologize to you.

91
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,358
Apology? For what?

92
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,121
That day mother
said very awful things.

93
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,321
She must have said
so. She is a mother.

94
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,449
May be she was in a
bad mood at that time.

95
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,243
- She is always in a bad mood.
- Why?

96
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,438
Tell me.

97
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,340
May be because
she is my step-mother.

98
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:49,295
Father felt very bad.
We couldn't even offer you tea.

99
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,484
Alright. I will
come again some day.

100
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,463
- Again some day?
- I shouldn't come.

101
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,807
No, no, no.
I mean...

102
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,294
Anyway, forget that.
Come, I will escort you home.

103
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,279
- But...
- No ifs and buts. I have a car. Come.

104
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,799
Come.

105
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,114
Do you go to temple daily?

106
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,467
No. Sometimes.

107
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,227
Did you say something?

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,371
No.

109
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,026
Enough. Pull over
near that hillock.

110
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:25,180
Thank you very much.
I will walk from here.

111
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,018
- I have come so far then let me escort you home.
- No, no. no.

112
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,529
Goodbye.

113
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:32,116
Yes. Listen.

114
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,743
I forgot to tell you a
very important thing.

115
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,437
What?

116
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:39,470
I am staying in Hotel Royal.

117
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:43,248
And the telephone number is 350.

118
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,042
350.

119
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,231
- Hello!
- Hey!

120
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,596
Were you waiting near the phone?

121
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:07,974
Why else did
I give the phone number?

122
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,639
Alright. So you gave the
number for this reason.

123
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,678
Yes.
I can't talk to you at home..

124
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,390
As your mother's
mood is very bad.

125
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,786
Is it important to talk?

126
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:23,124
Now not such conversation but
meeting is also important.

127
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:28,429
Hello. Hello. Hello...

128
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:34,657
You are laughing. See,
the weather is so pleasant.

129
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:39,137
Then go and roam
around. Enjoy the weather.

130
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,246
Alone. Even the weather will
lose its color in solitude.

131
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:47,925
Look, Mal Road is very
close to your house.

132
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:49,859
Yes, it is nearby.

133
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:52,955
I am ready to bet that
I will reach there before you.

134
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,503
Impossible.

135
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:56,929
Really? Let's see then.

136
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:58,768
Let's see.

137
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,232
Mal Road. Fast.

138
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:09,509
Mal Road.

139
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:24,458
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

140
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:29,970
Nothing happens without
any reason.

141
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:35,703
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

142
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:41,680
Nothing happens without
any reason.

143
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:47,847
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

144
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:16,825
By the way both of us are still
strangers for each other.

145
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:27,962
By the way both of us are still
strangers for each other.

146
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,745
But if someone sees us then
he will say that we are..

147
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,812
In love since long time.

148
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:42,639
There has to be
something special in you and me.

149
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:50,719
Or else the flowers don't
blossom in such way.

150
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:56,998
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

151
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:19,632
There is no doubt that
we both love each other.

152
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,012
There is no doubt that
we both love each other.

153
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:36,925
In only 2 meetings these eyes
have lost their sleep.

154
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,720
How will days pass
by in this way?

155
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:54,480
Now it is very hard to
pass even one night.

156
00:15:54,633 --> 00:16:00,401
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

157
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,512
I don't know
from where you came..

158
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:17,560
From where I came.

159
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:23,281
Neither you nor
I know who how hearts united.

160
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,912
I don't know
from where you came..

161
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,888
From where I came.

162
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:43,210
Maybe our path is same or
else we wouldn't have met.

163
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:52,512
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

164
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:58,084
Nothing happens without
any reason.

165
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:03,910
There has to be some
reason for the hearts to unite.

166
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:33,815
Hay by so dressed up
were are you going.

167
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,852
Leela's house
- I know very well your Leela Villa.

168
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,589
I'm watching from four days
your roaming here and their.

169
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,693
Remember if you will go outside
than you will go with me.

170
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,222
Hey what happen why are
you always shouting on her.

171
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,400
You keep quite, because of your
love she've become like this.

172
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,490
I've decided that tomorrow
we'll go from here.

173
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:57,889
And in 8 days we'll
marry her with Ram Dayal.

174
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:02,662
No way! Ram Dayal is father
of two child and his age also.

175
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,694
Your daughter's age
is also not less.

176
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,093
Hey Listen. Wait for few
days, we'll get a good boy.

177
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,501
We'll get good boy when
she will spoil our name.

178
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,557
We'll marry her definitely.

179
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,558
Why are you seeing by standing
here. Go and do your work.

180
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:22,085

181
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:37,916

00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:40,706

199
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,295
Dear Rama now I've got a letter
that my father is not well.

200
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,059
That's why I'm going back.

201
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:12,933
I've written my address in letter.
You write me letter on that address.

00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:17,042
Write definitely.
I'll be waiting.

00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,567
Son, I'm going..

204
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:47,092
I feel bad that, I've given
only problem and not anything else.

205
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:52,180
Son, please return
it in any condition.

206
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:54,125
I'll pay each and every money.

207
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,455
Laxmi, don't cry.

208
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,892
You've son.

209
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,713
Son..

210
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,819
Take care of your mother
and your brother.

211
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:12,685
I am leaving their
responsibility to you.

212
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,100
Father, you should rest.

213
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:19,427
Son. Now I will be resting.

214
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,672
- Inder. Inder.
- Father, father.

215
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,852
- Debo. Debo.
- Father.

216
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:29,861
Laxmi. Where are all of you?

217
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,285
I can't see anything.

218
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,420
- Where are you?
- Father, father. - Laxmi.

219
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,129
There is no news of the boss.

220
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,394
He has not eaten breakfast
nor food since morning.

221
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,608
How long will this go on, Debo?

222
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,863
Now you should find a solution
or else I will leave everything.

223
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,131
Try to leave us.

224
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:14,299
I will file a report in the police
station that uncle Mahavir left..

225
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,192
In the middle of the
storm and fled.

226
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:18,129
- Dead or alive, he should be...
- No, brother.

227
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,183
Alright. He should
be arrested alive.

228
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:22,442
Now we will have to
keep you in bondage.

229
00:22:23,304 --> 00:22:25,169
By the way, uncle
Mahavir is right, brother.

230
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,358
You are neither aware
of yourself nor others.

231
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:28,512
Why? What happened?

232
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,135
You are asking what happened.

233
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:34,101
Just look at the clock.
You don't feel hungry.

234
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:37,593
Old mother is sitting hungry
and thirsty in the house.

235
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,343
Sometimes think about her too.

236
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:40,958
Mother has not eaten food yet.

237
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,860
Debo, you go home immediately.

238
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,641
Tell mother that
I ate food in the hotel.

239
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,464
I will take dinner at home.

240
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:49,229
Are you going out again, brother?

241
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,898
Yes, Debo. I have an important
work with the sir.

242
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:57,328
It is very difficult to make
do work in this small shop.

243
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,328
If I could get some money then
I will start a factory.

244
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,726
You go home and explain
it to mother.

245
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:09,160
Such income is of no use!

246
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,491
Ajit, you are not
a man but a demon.

247
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:16,927
I helped you and you
have started cheating me.

248
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:18,959
Sir, why would I cheat you?

249
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,125
You have forgotten. I have repaid
every penny of you loan.

250
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:23,702
Liar, scoundrel! Get out of here.

251
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,782
I will put this money
in the account of loss.

252
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:28,460
But I won't see your
face again in my life.

253
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,000
Rammohan. Tear his draft
and throw it on his face.

254
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:33,963
- Get lost from here.
- Alright, sir.

255
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:36,537
- Today you are very upset therefore I will leave.
- Fool! Go.

256
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,757
Come on Rammohan.
Give me my drafts.

257
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,093
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

258
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:45,175
- Is sir in?
- Yes. You can go in.

259
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,474
- Greetings, sir.
- Tell me what brings you here.

260
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:55,397
I talked to you on the phone.

261
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:57,370
I came for the same matter.

262
00:23:57,467 --> 00:24:01,665
Yes. Yes. You want to sell your
old shop and start a new factory.

263
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:02,476
Yes.

264
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:03,732
It is a very good thing.

265
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:07,169
But sir I am being offered only
15, OOO Rupees for that shop.

266
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,594
And I need at
least 10, OOO rupees more.

267
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,340
- Therefore I came...
- You want 10, OOO rupees more.

268
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,321
Yes, sir.

269
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:16,711
You can take the money and return
as per your convenience.

270
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,338
What can be more better than
young man like you making..

271
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,625
Progress and
becoming rich and wealthy.

272
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,098
Take these 10, OOO rupees.

273
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:27,710
Take this and sign on this.

274
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:32,292
- May God give you success!
- Okay.

275
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:45,258
- Inder, greetings.
- Greetings.

276
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,809
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

277
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:50,606
Strange. I am Ajit Kumar Verma.

278
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:53,777
I have bought goods from your shop
2-3 times. Don't you remember?

279
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,851
Anyway, let it be.
I too have a small factory.

280
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,539
- Really?
- Yes. And I have drilling and cutting machines.

281
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,664
I heard that you want
to start a factory.

282
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,624
Yes. I want thinking about it.

283
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:06,688
Then do one thing.
Buy my machines.

284
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,321
It is in a brand new condition.

285
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,703
But first I would like
to see the machines.

286
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,237
Of course. Of course.

287
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:15,109
My factory is nearby.
You can come and see it.

288
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:18,399
Not today. You give me your
address. I will come tomorrow.

289
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:21,371
You are being strange. It
won't take more than 2 minutes.

290
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:24,311
You can check the machines today
and make the decision tomorrow.

291
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,060
Taxi! Come. Come. Please come.

292
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:30,493
Sit.

293
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,782
Drive the taxi.

294
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,684
Come. Please come.

295
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:56,289
- Your factory is here.
- No... actually it was very late..

296
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,798
On the way so I thought that
the factory must be close now.

297
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,405
My house is here. Come
and drink a cup of tea.

298
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:04,340
And you can check the
papers of the factory.

299
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,513
- Sardar sir, what is the fare?
- 10. - Take. Take it.

300
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:08,511
Come in. Come in. Please come.

301
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:27,646
Come. Come in.

302
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:29,572
Come in.

303
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,858
You stay here.

304
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,340
Actually my wife is interested
in singing and dancing.

305
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,255
She has opened this dancing school.

306
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:41,276
I am busy whole day long. This
way she keeps herself busy.

307
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,439
You... sit down.
I will come soon.

308
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:44,489
Sit. Sit.

309
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:53,044
I had been disgraced..

310
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:58,341
If I would have screamed.

311
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:07,169
Last night a lover boy
came on the terrace in my dream.

312
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,224
Forget about lover boy.

313
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:19,456
- Think about gathering money.
- What happened?

314
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,299
Master, you can go.

315
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,548
- What is the matter?
- I will tell you.

316
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,225
I have trapped a man
with lots of money.

317
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,591
Really? Did you con someone again?

318
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,332
Yes. His pocket is full of money.

319
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:35,292
And my hand is
itching to get that money.

320
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:36,661
But what will be my share?

321
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,472
Same. 50-50.

322
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,904
- I will make the arrangement.
- That's the spirit.

323
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:49,418
Why did you stop? Why
are feeling shy?

324
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:52,063
He is my old friend.
Come. Come.

325
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:54,910
Come. Come on.

326
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:58,484
Inderjeet, she is my wife, Jamna.

327
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,030
Greetings.

328
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,266
She was sitting inside and
practicing her singing.

329
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,558
- Are you interested in singing?
- Yes. From childhood.

330
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:08,245
Yes, Jamna. Our factory
that is been mortgaged..

331
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,312
I was thinking that we
should see that to him.

332
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,498
- This is a very good thing.
- Where are the papers?

333
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:13,291
Paper?!

334
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:15,633
Today elder brother came. He
took it to show it to someone.

335
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:19,159
What nonsense? I won't sell
the factory to someone else.

336
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,458
I have promised him.

337
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:22,271
Get the papers tomorrow morning.

338
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:23,992
Alright. I will go then.

339
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,170
I will come so other days when
you will have the papers.

340
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:27,422
But what is the rush?

341
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,225
Please sit. You have come to
our house for the first time.

342
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:33,016
- We won't let you go without any hospitality.
- She is right.

343
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,281
Do you want
whiskey in soda or water?

344
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,987
Thank you.
I don't drink.

345
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:40,713
Alright. Then you
can take cold drink.

346
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,159
Jamna, you are strange. You
sing and dance the whole day.

347
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:47,269
But today when we have guest
you are sitting here.

348
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,988
Come. Show your talent.

349
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:50,357
Come. Come.

350
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:53,911
She is very shy.

351
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:09,438
He gave heart and took my life.

352
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:16,000
He gave heart and took my life.

353
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,303
That fraud cheated me and left.

354
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:25,050
That fraud cheated me
and left. Cheated me.

355
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:29,875
That fraud cheated me and left.

356
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:04,840
He came stealthily from
the north direaction.

357
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:09,757
He stole my Bindi and my sleep.

358
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:16,190
He came stealthily from
the north direaction.

359
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:20,861
He stole my Bindi and my sleep.

360
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,595
He stole my
peace. He stole my peace.

361
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:30,125
He stole my peace.
He entered my heart.

362
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:34,945
Becoming a desire and a guest..

363
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:39,688
He stole the things
of the house.

364
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:43,998
He stole the things of the house.

365
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:52,588
That fraud cheated me
and let. Cheated me.

366
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:21,222
He gave me a fake ring of brass.

367
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:26,139
He made many promises and
put me under his hold.

368
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:32,709
He gave me a fake ring of brass.

369
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:37,124
He made many promises and
put me under his hold.

370
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,837
One day in solitude.

371
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:46,711
One day in solitude he made
an excuse to show me..

372
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,258
The buds in the fair of flowers.

373
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:55,900
He stole the
tune from the anklet.

374
00:31:56,294 --> 00:32:00,758
He stole the
tune from the anklet.

375
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:08,989
That fraud cheated me
and let. Cheated me.

376
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:14,284
That fraud cheated me and left.

377
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:19,037
He gave heart and took my life.

378
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:27,367
That fraud cheated me
and left. Cheated me.

379
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:34,969
Ajit's factory?

380
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,195
Not even his father has
ever heard bout factory.

381
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,220
Inder, he committed a
fraud in the office.

382
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:41,456
He was fired from the job.

383
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:43,379
And maybe one day he
will go in prison too.

384
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,207
My fortune is bad, sir.

385
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,918
Do you remember where he
took you in the taxi?

386
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:54,066
Sir, the taxi reached there
after taking many turns.

387
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,873
There was sound of
singing and dancing.

388
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,836
And maybe that
girl's name was Jamna.

389
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:03,338
She is a prostitute.
One day he even brought her here.

390
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,024
I drove her away immediately.

391
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,313
Inder, now there is no hope
of getting your money back.

392
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:11,943
Sir, do you have his address?

393
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:13,575
I will try one time.

394
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:15,321
I will check.
Maybe I have that.

395
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,578
Here...

396
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:36,355
You!

397
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:37,925
Rama.

398
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:43,237
You... how come you are here?

399
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,032
This is Ajit's house.

400
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:52,073
He is my husband.

401
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:54,711
Husband!

402
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:57,515
Come inside.

403
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,607
It is a strange coincidence.

404
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:11,590
We couldn't meet where
we tried to meet.

405
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,415
But I meet you in the place..

406
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:17,553
Where I didn't thought possible
in my wildest dream.

407
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,315
I am also thinking the same thing.

408
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,145
Sit down.

409
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,490
How is your father?

410
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:39,803
He died at that time.

411
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,075
But Rama, yesterday Ajit
took me some place else.

412
00:34:48,234 --> 00:34:51,466
There is introduced to me
some other woman as his wife.

413
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:56,862
He can only answer this question.

414
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:01,413
I understood.

415
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,051
But... but how do you know him?

416
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,067
We met yesterday at a
money lender's place.

417
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,664
He forcibly took to
that woman's place.

418
00:35:14,343 --> 00:35:16,869
He mixed drugs in my
soft drink and stole..

419
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,384
My 10, OOO rupees.

420
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:21,294
What?

421
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:24,669
Yes, Rama.

422
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,451
I came here to take
that money back.

423
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:31,324
It is impossible then.

424
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,105
By now he must..

425
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,910
Have spent that
money in liquor and gambling.

426
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:40,936
You... you lodge a complaint
in the police station.

427
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:46,038
- No, Rama. It is not possible now.
- Why?

428
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:48,451
Because of me.

429
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Maybe!

430
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,830
He has come.

431
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:09,567
I was knocking the door for
a long time. Can't you hear?

432
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,035
What were you doing inside
with the door locked?

433
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,059
- Ajit.
- Ah!

434
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:14,146
Greetings.

435
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:16,032
Who are you?

436
00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:18,531
You are so drunk that you
don't recognize me now.

437
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,935
What is this nonsense?
I have never seen you before.

438
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:23,262
Get out of my house.

439
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
I will go.

440
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,096
But first I will take the money
that you stole from me..

441
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:30,625
After drugging me.

442
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:32,660
What did you say?

443
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:34,918
I stole your money.

444
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:37,432
Scoundrel!

445
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,829
You thought that my house
was a brothel and..

446
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,018
Invited your lover here.

447
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:42,072
- Ajit!
- Hey!

448
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,122
- Lower your voice or else...
- For God's sake please don't fight.

449
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:45,306
You go away from here.

450
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:14,138
Ajit, I have seen a
scoundrel man like you.

451
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:15,719
Now you have seen me.

452
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,692
Boy, go from here now.

453
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:20,658
Get out.

454
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:30,121
Stupid!

455
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,959
Meet me in the evening.
I've to talk very important.

456
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,854
Tell me the truth. Where
did you hide the jewellery?

457
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:18,192
I already gave you all
the things that I had.

458
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:21,327
I am telling you for the last time.

459
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:24,422
Give me that jewellery quietly or..

460
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,358
Else I will beat you
and break your bones.

461
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:32,036
What else you have
given me besides beating?

462
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,498
Don't you feel pity while doing
atrocities on your wife?

463
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:39,364
Wife?

464
00:38:40,264 --> 00:38:41,822
You are my wife?

465
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:46,337
An immoral and promiscuous
woman like you who..

466
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:49,439
Ran away from
home cannot be my wife.

467
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,915
Don't say that.

468
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,239
You married me in the temple.

469
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,005
You made me your wife are putting
garland around my neck.

470
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,935
That garland has been broken.

471
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:02,911
You can say anything.

472
00:39:03,737 --> 00:39:06,205
But I have accepted you as
my husband with true heart.

473
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:11,382
Husband! Yes. Then
I should get dowry too.

474
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:16,154
- Where is that jewellery?
- I said I don't know.

475
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,844
If you don't know then
who know it? Tell me.

476
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:28,553
You don't have any jewellery.

477
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,042
Don't beat me.

478
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,069
I am going to become the
mother of your child.

479
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,090
What? What did you say?

480
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,915
Scoundrel! You are going
be the mother of my child.

481
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:47,848
- You want to put someone else's sin on me.
- No.

482
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:49,953
If you want you can kill me..

483
00:39:50,108 --> 00:39:52,269
But please don't put
this blemish on my character.

484
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:56,100
No, no. Now you
cannot live in this house.

485
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,776
- Get out of my house.
- I won't you.

486
00:39:58,817 --> 00:40:01,817
Scoundrel! You say that you are
going be the mother of my child.

487
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,245
- Get out.
- Don't..

488
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,912
- Get up.
- I won't you.

489
00:40:05,023 --> 00:40:06,217
- You have to go.
- Ajit.

490
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:10,053
You?

491
00:40:11,353 --> 00:40:13,878
Don't you feel ashamed
while beating your wife?

492
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,461
You have sympathy with her.

493
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:25,896
You have put the blame of
stealing 10, OOO on me.

494
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:27,837
And you want to
compensate from her.

495
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:32,478
- Ruffian!
- No, no. You go from here.

496
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:42,529
You slapped me.

497
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,201
Alright. I will see you.

498
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,314
He is going to call his ruffian
friends. Now you should leave.

499
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,221
But Rama, how can I leave
you in this condition?

500
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:00,811
This is not new for me.

501
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:07,585
I... I will find my own path.

502
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,904
You can go.

503
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:12,627
Wait.

504
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:16,321
Wait.

505
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,348
I won't be able to keep it
safely with me for more days.

506
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:31,571
Now you should take it.

507
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:33,078
What is in it?

508
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,056
It will help you
recover your stolen money.

509
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:41,156
- What do you mean?
- Keep it. Keep it.

510
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:42,724
Rama.

511
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:46,879
Rama, listen to me.

512
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,216
Rama.

513
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:55,265
Rama, wait.

514
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,389
Rama.

515
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:37,672
Rama.

516
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:40,461
- No. Leave me. Leave me.
- Rama.

517
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:42,970
- I don't want to live anymore.
- Rama, what is this madness?

518
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:47,501
Life is not so cheap that
you can end it so easily.

519
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:52,380
- You are saying this even after seeing all those things.
- Yes.

520
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:55,185
No, I won't enter that house again.

521
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:57,820
Not that house, Rama.
I will take you to my house.

522
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,799
Come. Taxi!

523
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:07,449
I don't understand, Rama.
Why did you mary such a man?

524
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:09,653
Helplessness.

525
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:12,706
The man with whom my
mother fixed my..

526
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:15,807
Marriage was a father
of 2 children.

527
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:18,945
I was in a dilemma thinking
what I should do..

528
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,214
And what I shouldn't?

529
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,290
Suddenly I met Ajit.

530
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:27,506
He promised to mary me.

531
00:43:28,948 --> 00:43:32,042
I believed him and ran
away from the house.

532
00:43:33,093 --> 00:43:34,924
But you could have written
letter to me.

533
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:36,504
You had my address.

534
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:42,124
That part of your letter in which
you had written your address..

535
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:44,874
Was washed out by the rain.

536
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:47,003
What could I have done?

537
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:51,055
Don't cry, Rama? What had
to happen has happened?

538
00:43:57,557 --> 00:44:00,355
You are home, big brother.
Mother has been...

539
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:02,155
Come.

540
00:44:04,836 --> 00:44:06,064
Uncle, I will...

541
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:12,331
Where were you till now?

542
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:14,472
Who is she?

543
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:19,346
Mother, she is a helpless girl.

544
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:21,435
She was trapped by a ruffian...

545
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,569
I thought
I should bring her to you...

546
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:41,778
Mother, if you will hear everything
about them then...

547
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:46,003
ls there anything to hear
besides what I can see?

548
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,991
Mahavir, take her to my room.

549
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:51,398
Come.

550
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:02,059
Well, I have got
redemption for my sins.

551
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,512
I have made that bundle
to Banaras by train.

552
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:06,263
Whom have you sent, uncle?

553
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:10,239
The same, whom you
got home last night.

554
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:12,457
- What are you saying, uncle?
- Yes.

555
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:14,547
Last night mother
said to me, leave..

556
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:18,098
Her at the station
when its morning.

557
00:45:18,445 --> 00:45:20,310
I followed her instructions.

558
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,339
But she repeatedly kept saying
that she had to meet you once.

559
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:27,037
I too was adamant.
I didn't let her meet you.

560
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:30,085
I am coming here
are the train late.

561
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:32,473
Uncle, you didn't do good.

562
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:35,165
At least, you should have told me.

563
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:39,178
- A orphan girl, this way...
- Enough, leave your kindness

564
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:40,943
A girl from the roads.

565
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:43,730
We have no knowledge of
her husband or her home.

566
00:45:43,893 --> 00:45:46,088
- You just got her at midnight.
- Keep quite, uncle.

567
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:48,162
You don't know anything
about that girl.

568
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,676
Yes. I don't know anything.

569
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,178
- But all I know is that she had a child in her stomach...
- What?!

570
00:45:54,113 --> 00:45:57,014
- Is she pregnant?
- Yes, she is pregnant.

571
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,995
- Listen.
- What is it?

572
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:13,325
- There used to be a man here. Who? Mr. Ajit?
- Yes.

573
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:16,106
The police came this morning
and took away the drunkard.

574
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:18,343
He had stolen money
from his office.

575
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,385
His wife had already
fled from here.

576
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:22,563
Are you his relative?

577
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,194
- What? No, I am not.
- Ok.

578
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:12,999
Today Mr. Avinash had come, Indra.

579
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:15,746
Who is Avinash, mother?

580
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,301
He works in some office.
He was a gentleman.

581
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,747
I went with Mahavir to
see his sister Kamla.

582
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:24,906
For what?

583
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,002
To arrange a sister-in-law
for me, brother.

584
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:31,595
But... but, mother, why hurry?

585
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:33,595
I have just started
a small factory.

586
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:36,311
His education is to be completed.
We have to make a new house.

587
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:37,914
We'll see after that.

588
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:40,072
Will she obstruct your working?

589
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,622
Then, a girl from a
ordinary family cannot..

590
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,446
Be made to sit in her
home for a long time.

591
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:47,109
I like the girl.
I have agreed and come.

592
00:48:01,136 --> 00:48:02,535
Hey, what's this?

593
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:06,472
May I see the face of my wife?

594
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,367
What will you do by seeing it?

595
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:12,563
If you are lost
somewhere, I'll find you.

596
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:15,525
Go away, I won't show you.

597
00:48:24,072 --> 00:48:29,237
Wow, its very beautiful.
Just like a moon.

598
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:34,829
Don't give me false
praise. I know everything.

599
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,246
What do you know?

600
00:48:36,402 --> 00:48:39,303
That you don't
want to get married.

601
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:43,505
Who told you?

602
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
I know everything.

603
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,666
Tell me.
Did you love someone else.

604
00:48:52,506 --> 00:48:56,374
- Yes.
- What? Whom?

605
00:48:58,528 --> 00:48:59,825
With my dreams.

606
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:02,807
Dreams?!

607
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:09,007
Yes, Kamla. Dream of become rich
man and progress in life.

608
00:49:11,835 --> 00:49:13,393
You've been scared me.

609
00:49:17,013 --> 00:49:22,372
Kamla, can I trust you help
me to fulfill my dreams.

610
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,569
It's my duty.

611
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:27,644
One more thing.

612
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:32,804
In life sometime
man forget his way.

613
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:37,669
If it happens with me any
time. Then you help me.

614
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,291
Don't leave me.

615
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:43,301
What are you talking.

616
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:45,194
Your my husband.

617
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,160
Our small home

618
00:50:15,886 --> 00:50:19,065
our small home

619
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:22,643
the dream of our lives

620
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,874
it must not be broken, darling

621
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:33,749
it must not be broken, darling

622
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:37,589
our small home

623
00:50:37,636 --> 00:50:40,470
the dream of our lives

624
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,874
it must not be broken, darling

625
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:51,419
it must not be broken, darling

626
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:17,232
lost in your loving eyes

627
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:22,592
I ty to find myself

628
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:29,184
keeping it in the
temple of my mind

629
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:33,498
I keep worshipping your image

630
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:37,235
due to worship of many years

631
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,405
can such love be received

632
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:45,171
you should not be angy, darling

633
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:52,175
darling, you should
not be angy, darling

634
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:55,286
our small home

635
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:58,129

00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:03,501

637
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:08,785
it must not be broken, darling

638
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:43,033
I left my parents place

639
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:46,097
I made a relation with you

640
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:51,720
my dear, I will
decorate your alleys

641
00:52:52,154 --> 00:52:54,679
at this place of mine

642
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:58,253
selecting them from my eyes

643
00:52:58,463 --> 00:53:02,696
I will spread the
flowers of aspirations

644
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,540
in the nights of
happiness and sadness

645
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:09,672
we are hand in hand

646
00:53:09,713 --> 00:53:14,173
our company should
not be broken, darling

647
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:21,115
darling, our company should
not be broken, darling

648
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:24,446
our small home

649
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:27,310
the dream of our lives

650
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:31,685
it must not be broken, darling

651
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:38,776
it must not be broken, darling

652
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,994
- Tell me, how do you find it to be?
- I liked the house a lot.

653
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,675
What would be its price?

654
00:53:49,805 --> 00:53:51,568
For you I'll make it
done around 3 lakhs.

655
00:53:51,825 --> 00:53:52,825
3 lakhs?

656
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:55,433
I'll show the house to my
mother and have the matter fixed.

657
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:57,255
So should I come to your
office the day after tomorrow?

658
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,042
- Alright. Ok. I'll Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

659
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:03,096
It is good that you came, brother.

660
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:04,985
- Go quickly, mother has lost consciousness.
- What?

661
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,409
Yes. I am going to call the doctor.

662
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:09,546
Mother?

663
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:12,568
- Mother.
- Mother!

664
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:15,272
- Mother.
- Mother...

665
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:17,387
- What happened to mother?
- Look at her.

666
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:19,403
She neither speaks
nor opens her eyes.

667
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,308
She became unconscious
while praying.

668
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:27,250
Open your eyes, mother. Look,
mother. I have come.

669
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,083
Mother!

670
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:08,733
- Mahavir, uncle?
- What is it, daughter-in-law?

671
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:10,814
- Is your elder brother ready?
- Yes.

672
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,750
- Where is Debu?
- He is in his room.

673
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,464
He's getting ready to go somewhere.

674
00:55:15,632 --> 00:55:17,913
- That is why I made him have his breakfast quickly.
- Ok.

675
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:20,380
- You lay the breakfast for him. I'll come soon.
- Ok.

676
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:33,825
- Are you smiling?
- Who is smiling, Debu?

677
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:36,491
- No sister-in-law, no one. You... you are smiling.
- Don't lie.

678
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:38,777
- What are you hiding? Show it to me.
- No, sister-in-law.

679
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:40,493
- It is... take this.
- It is in the other hand.

680
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:42,137
In the other hand? It is
a passport, sister-in-law.

681
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:43,629
I mean, passport photograph.

682
00:55:44,585 --> 00:55:46,349
She is beautiful but who is she?

683
00:55:46,947 --> 00:55:48,972
From where is this
passport? From Premnagar?

684
00:55:49,038 --> 00:55:50,563
- Premnagar?
- Who is she?

685
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,359
- She is a girl.
- I can see that she is a girl.

686
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:55,245
Have you seen it.
Let me keep it back.

687
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,643
Ok, do you dare? Will
you snatch it from me?

688
00:55:57,807 --> 00:56:00,241
I am requesting for it
with folded hands, please.

689
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,816
- From where did you get this photo?
- How did I get it.

690
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,205
I think I got it by mistake.

691
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:06,544
So then your photo must have
reached her also by mistake.

692
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,342
Yes... what?! No-no!

693
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,432
- What is her name?
- Kavita.

694
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:12,238
- Where does she stay?
- In here home.

695
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:13,948
I know that.
What is her address?

696
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,559
The address... why?

697
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,704
Because your elder
brother will have to be..

698
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:18,820
Told about your doing.

699
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:20,229
Oh my God! Wait. One minute.

700
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,311
I don't swear by you
but by me that I won't..

701
00:56:22,352 --> 00:56:25,014
Love anyone else in
my life except Kavita.

702
00:56:25,242 --> 00:56:26,504
Now you have come on track.

703
00:56:26,713 --> 00:56:29,011
But promise me, you will
get her here one day.

704
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:31,703
I will surely get her here. But
only when brother isn't at home.

705
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:33,593
Ok, but if you done get her...

706
00:56:33,673 --> 00:56:34,731
- Young brother.
- Yes.

707
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:37,168
- Elder brother is calling you.
- I am coming. I'll come.

708
00:56:38,043 --> 00:56:39,374
I am doomed.
What will happen now?

709
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:41,174
Don't be afraid.
How would he know?

710
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:42,514
Take this offering.

711
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:45,422
- But you will have to come with me.
- I am coming.

712
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:46,538
You are a coward.

713
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,221
Brother, did you call me?

714
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:53,707
Yes, sit down.

715
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:55,593
I have had breakfast, brother.

716
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:57,832
Ok. Look, Debu.

717
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:00,011
There is still time for
the MA results to come out.

718
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,034
I was thinking, you should understand
all the working of the office.

719
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,726
- What?
- Yes, I have taken a new office.

720
00:57:06,283 --> 00:57:07,511
The work is also increasing.

721
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:10,397
And I cannot look after both
the office and the factory.

722
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,908
Brother, I thought that
if the result is good..

723
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:17,855
I should apply in some
college for lectureship.

724
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:20,961
Lectureship?

725
00:57:22,073 --> 00:57:24,513
Even though there is such a
large business, will you do a job?

726
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:27,646
Brother, I cannot
understand business matters.

727
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:31,292
But a doing a job even when
there is a business to handle?

728
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:33,258
I don't understand anything.

729
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:35,906
If he doesn't understand
business matters..

730
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:37,929
Why are you compelling
him to join business?

731
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:40,362
Hey Debu. You were saying
that you have go somewhere.

732
00:57:40,471 --> 00:57:42,251
You were saying right now
that you are getting late.

733
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:43,360
- Yes, yes.
- Go then.

734
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,130
- Brother, I have to leave.
- Ok, go.

735
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:48,864
Kamla, you are spoiling him.

736
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:50,946
What does this have
to do with spoiling?

737
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:52,966
He had to go somewhere,
so I reminded him.

738
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:55,521
- Did you remind him?
- Yes.

739
00:57:56,484 --> 00:57:57,484
Tea.

740
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:04,430
Kamla, Kamla.

741
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:10,183
Brother, you...

742
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:12,539
- How are you?
- I am well.

743
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,885
Today after so many days you
have remembered your sister.

744
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,539
You don't come to get my
news. Whether I am good or not.

745
00:58:17,937 --> 00:58:19,151
What do I do, brother?

746
00:58:19,214 --> 00:58:20,347
This is such a big family.

747
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:22,635
- I've to take care of everything by my self.
- Leave it.

748
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:24,370
Is it a big family?

749
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:27,042
By now there should have been two
playful children in this family.

750
00:58:27,502 --> 00:58:28,696
Please sit, brother. Sit.

751
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:31,356
So, how is everybody?

752
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,229
Sister-in-law, Nandu, Bela?

753
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,361
- Are they alright?
- They aren't!

754
00:58:35,772 --> 00:58:37,467
I am the sole earner
in the family..

755
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:38,979
And there are so
many people who consume.

756
00:58:39,003 --> 00:58:40,272
What do I say, Kamla?

757
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:43,225
Now-a-day, it is difficult to give
two daily meals to my children.

758
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:46,725
I thought, I would take
a debt from Mr. Inder..

759
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:49,388
- And return it when I get a job.
- No-no, brother.

760
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:52,577
If you beg from him you will
be humiliated and so will I.

761
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:55,552
Ok, I'll think of something else.

762
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:58,651
- Ok, I'll leave.
- Wait, brother.

763
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,803
I only have this much now.
Keep it.

764
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,921
No, no. I won't take money
from my younger sister.

765
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,679
Use it for your work.
Assume it to be a debt.

766
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:16,506
But done tell anyone.
Not even him.

767
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:18,925
Ok. But I am keeping
this as a debt.

768
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:20,019
- Ok.
- Ok.

769
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:21,354
Hey!

770
00:59:21,622 --> 00:59:23,662
- I forgot the job that I had come here for.
- What?

771
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:27,019
Kamla, I have only
one worry all day.

772
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:30,635
God should give my sister a
child. That why I went to a sage.

773
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:32,227
What then?

774
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:34,204
He has said that a
amulet should be made.

775
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:37,268
It is an expense of 300-400rs. Let
it be, I'll have it made from this.

776
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:39,300
No-no. Why should you spend?

777
00:59:39,378 --> 00:59:41,439
You get the amulet,
I'll pay you the money.

778
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:45,526
Alright. God, fulfil
my sister's wish.

779
00:59:46,217 --> 00:59:47,343
Ok, now I'll leave.

780
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:48,699
- Ok, brother.
- Bless you.

781
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,171
Inderjeet, may I come in?

782
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:57,930
Mr. Avinash! Come in.

783
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,543
I'll see this later.

784
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:00,961
Alright, sir.

785
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,925
Wow, wow, wow.

786
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:06,075
Really, your work and
dedication is worth applauding.

787
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:08,588
You have made so much progress.

788
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,335
And me, I haven't been able
to do anything in my life.

789
01:00:12,974 --> 01:00:13,974
Please sit.

790
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:16,265
Tell me, did you apply
for a job anywhere?

791
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:18,792
Yes, I have applied in many places.

792
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,582
But I cannot do a small job.

793
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:23,856
People keep demeaning me.

794
01:00:24,189 --> 01:00:25,759
Why would the older
brother-in-law..

795
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,290
Of Inderjeet
Mukherjee need a job?

796
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:30,176
I had come to you
for an important work.

797
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:31,851
Tell me then.

798
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:33,140
How can I say it?

799
01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:35,418
It is a matter of my
children's milk and their fees.

800
01:00:35,949 --> 01:00:37,917
What is the need to be shy in that?

801
01:00:39,486 --> 01:00:41,613
A man can only spread
his hands before his own.

802
01:00:41,873 --> 01:00:43,807
Not much. Just 4-5 hundred.

803
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:45,967
And it is not a
donation, it is a debt.

804
01:00:46,105 --> 01:00:47,970
I will return it as
soon as I get a job.

805
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,610
Take this, a 1000 rupees.

806
01:00:51,123 --> 01:00:52,284
From me, for the kids.

807
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:56,134
Indra, you have saved my children.

808
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:59,397
My blessing will
always be with you.

809
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,141
But I have a request.

810
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:02,884
Don't tell Kamla about this.

811
01:01:03,023 --> 01:01:06,322
Oh no. This is not a thing
to be told to someone.

812
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:09,610
In fact, Avinash I was
thinking of something else.

813
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:13,275
- What were you thinking of?
- I was thinking...

814
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,007
you a close person.

815
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:18,994
If you take some responsibility,
it will be a big favour.

816
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:21,261
Oh no! Why are you
calling it a favour.

817
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:23,603
I am ready to help
you in every way.

818
01:01:24,815 --> 01:01:26,339
You won't have to
come or go anywhere.

819
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,121
You will only have to take
care of this place and...

820
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:30,655
You will have to
check the accounts.

821
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,136
I will be able to give
you, for now, 1000 a month.

822
01:01:34,432 --> 01:01:35,956
Money is of no consequence.

823
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:38,459
It is a homely job, give
me anything you deem fit.

824
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,098
But I have a request.

825
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,580
What is that?

826
01:01:42,489 --> 01:01:46,482
In the office salary register,
my name shouldn't come.

827
01:01:46,812 --> 01:01:48,780
Otherwise, people will
say that Avinash is..

828
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:50,866
Working at his younger
brother-in-law place.

829
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:54,048
Alright, I accept your condition.

830
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:55,947
Come from tomorrow.

831
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:58,595
- Ok. Alright, greetings.
- Greetings.

832
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,458
Hey, are you asleep?

833
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:13,683
Oh no! I was tired, I felt sleepy.

834
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,655
Why shouldn't you get
tired? You work day and night.

835
01:02:17,164 --> 01:02:19,064
You have made the
factory your second wife.

836
01:02:19,683 --> 01:02:20,946
Don't say that Kamla.

837
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:23,198
I am doing all this for you people.

838
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:26,683
What is this?

839
01:02:29,735 --> 01:02:30,735
An amulet?

840
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:32,869
Its nothing.
Brother had come today.

841
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:35,354
Ok, he has given you that.

842
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:40,843
Do you believe in all this?

843
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:44,199
What do I do? It has been
3 years since marriage.

844
01:02:44,666 --> 01:02:45,826
What would people think?

845
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:49,473
A woman who has no
children is humiliated.

846
01:02:50,577 --> 01:02:53,341
Kamla, children
are a gift from God.

847
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:54,877
What can we do?

848
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:57,787
Still, if you have so
much desire for a child..

849
01:02:58,362 --> 01:02:59,556
We can adopt someone.

850
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:03,012
Better than that would be to
have brother-in-law married soon.

851
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:05,206
- Debu's marriage?
- What else?

852
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:09,156
If he has children, I will
feel them to be my own.

853
01:03:09,612 --> 01:03:12,359
But Kamla... we will
have to find a girl first.

854
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,643
- We will have to like her...
- You need not worry about that.

855
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,760
Brother-in-law has
already decided his bride.

856
01:03:17,078 --> 01:03:18,670
- Really?
- I have seen her too.

857
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:21,451
If you would want, this
marriage can be done tomorrow.

858
01:03:22,543 --> 01:03:25,638
If you people have already
decided everything..

859
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,499
Why are you asking me?

860
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:29,292
Alright, lets marriage be done.

861
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,392
Lets start the
band-music from tomorrow.

862
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,134
Hey, Kavita.

863
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:46,806
After so many days this
day has come, right?

864
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:49,686
- Not days, nights.
- Oh! I forgot.

865
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:53,542
- May I ask you something?
- Yes, ask me.

866
01:03:54,609 --> 01:03:56,509
- Don't feel bad.
- Absolutely not.

867
01:03:58,313 --> 01:04:01,077
This bungalow, factory, property..

868
01:04:01,768 --> 01:04:03,768
- Isn't it all owned by your elder brother?
- Yes.

869
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,422
Why?

870
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:06,158
Wow. everything is
owned by one brother..

871
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:07,599
And nothing is owned by another.

872
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:09,030
No, no, no, Kavita.

873
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:11,101
We brothers have no
differences between ourselves.

874
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:13,691
In fact, brother loves
me more than his life.

875
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:15,396
What is his, is mine.

876
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:16,694
You are very innocent.

877
01:04:17,044 --> 01:04:20,502
I would say that love is
of no value before wealth.

878
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,001
What are you saying?

879
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,049
Why? Did you feel bad?

880
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:27,153
No, but... well, leave it.

881
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:30,335
Look, Kavita. This night
is not for all this.

882
01:04:31,395 --> 01:04:33,386
This night is for
our union. Isn't it?

883
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:35,268
Isn't it?

884
01:04:36,366 --> 01:04:37,366
Isn't it?

885
01:04:38,745 --> 01:04:40,508
- Honeymoon bills pending?
- Is it not?

886
01:04:40,765 --> 01:04:42,062
- Hemant.
- Yes.

887
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:44,366
I have given you all the
instructions for the factory..

888
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,424
Any questions?

889
01:04:45,518 --> 01:04:46,917
No, sir. everything is clear.

890
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:48,488
Inder, did you call me?

891
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,790
Come in, Mr. Avinash.

892
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:52,698
I am going to Delhi for
the Inderjni project.

893
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:54,105
That is good, go on.

894
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:56,146
The deal will be better
if it is done face-to-face.

895
01:04:56,236 --> 01:04:57,828
I may take 6-7 days there.

896
01:04:57,987 --> 01:04:59,883
You need not worry. I'll
take care of everything.

897
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:02,026
If there is something special,
I'll make you a trunk call.

898
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,407
Alright. There is a
Iabour payment in 2 days.

899
01:05:04,448 --> 01:05:07,035
And a few bills are
pending. I have explained it to him.

900
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:09,731
I have signed a cheque
for a lakh rupees for that.

901
01:05:09,956 --> 01:05:11,594
- Get it cashed.
- Ok.

902
01:05:11,635 --> 01:05:13,569
And I have also
signed 2 blank cheques.

903
01:05:14,472 --> 01:05:15,530
Blank cheques?

904
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:19,073
What are the blank cheques for?

905
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:21,502
In case there is
someone's payment pending.

906
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,723
Or there may be an
urgent need for payment.

907
01:05:24,165 --> 01:05:25,845
It is possible that
I may need money there.

908
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,401
If such a matter arises
I will send you a telegram.

909
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:29,617
You send me a draft.

910
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,445
Don't worry at all, Inder.

911
01:05:31,675 --> 01:05:34,195
You've given me a responsibility
I'll comply with it completely.

912
01:05:34,372 --> 01:05:35,372
Alright? Ok.

913
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:40,494
Mr. Mukherjee, I have
gone through your papers.

914
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,871
Your estimate suits us.

915
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,316
And the rate is good too.

916
01:05:44,718 --> 01:05:45,480
Thank you.

917
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,161
But you see, the in-charge for
giving the contract is someone else.

918
01:05:48,357 --> 01:05:51,293
Mr. Khosla. We have
recommended you to him.

919
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:52,789
Do you know him?

920
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:55,515
Well, unfortunately I didn't
have a chance to meet him.

921
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:57,256
You see, Mr. Mukherjee..

922
01:05:57,735 --> 01:06:01,227
There are 2 other parties also
who're applying for the same contract.

923
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:02,332
I see.

924
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:04,829
And Mr. Khosla is
interested in one of them.

925
01:06:07,523 --> 01:06:09,889
Perhaps, then there
is no chance for me.

926
01:06:10,507 --> 01:06:12,566
You meet him personally once.

927
01:06:13,338 --> 01:06:14,499
What would be its use?

928
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:16,698
Without a meeting, no
task can be completed.

929
01:06:17,027 --> 01:06:18,825
Mr. Mukherjee, why
don't you take a chance?

930
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:21,688
Well, if you say, I'll meet him.

931
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,504
Anyway, thank you Mr. Mehra.

932
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:25,954
Thank you..

933
01:06:26,139 --> 01:06:28,767
Mr. Mukherjee. There
is a party tonight.

934
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:30,598
I have been invited there.

935
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:33,758
You come with me, I'll
introduce you to Mr. Khosla.

936
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:36,272
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

937
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:43,882
- Good.
- Mr. Khosla.

938
01:06:44,315 --> 01:06:46,899
Meet my friend Inderjeet
Mukherjee from Calcutta.

939
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:48,593
- How do you do, sir?
- Fine thank you.

940
01:06:48,932 --> 01:06:52,003
- He has also applied for the same contract.
- I see.

941
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:54,619
- I wanted to meet you for that reason.
- Sure, sure.

942
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:03,057
- Yes. Hello, Mr. Khosla.
- Hi man! - What are you doing here?

943
01:07:03,454 --> 01:07:04,887
Nothing. Is something going on?

944
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:05,847
Of course.

945
01:07:05,927 --> 01:07:07,782
Can't you see that there are
colourful butterflies here?

946
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,000
Really? One minute.

947
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:10,456
Excuse me.

948
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:15,753
Hi girls! Sit, sit. Come on.

949
01:07:15,854 --> 01:07:17,515
Thank you. Thank you very much.

950
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:21,783
- Really beautiful looking girls.
- Look at this man!

951
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:23,429
See how he behaves!

952
01:07:23,992 --> 01:07:26,256
- Its ok, Mr. Mehra.
- I am sorry.

953
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,590
Lets forget it.

954
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,766
I will take your leave
now, Mr. Mukherjee.

955
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,293
And good night.

956
01:07:42,152 --> 01:07:44,950
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome
to this hotel tonight!

957
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:47,344
We will be now presenting to you..

958
01:07:47,385 --> 01:07:49,684
The most famous
cabre-dancer, Ms. Leena.

959
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:51,448
Light, please.

960
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:29,295
Yours and mine

961
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:32,371
Mine and yours

962
01:08:32,432 --> 01:08:37,063
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

963
01:08:37,682 --> 01:08:40,150
Yours and mine

964
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:42,424
Mine and yours

965
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:47,142
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

966
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:51,661
Did you recognise me

967
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:57,750
I am the same, who
is crazy for you

968
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:03,731
Oh darling,
darling-darling, oh darling

969
01:09:03,843 --> 01:09:06,107
yours and mine

970
01:09:06,353 --> 01:09:08,651
Mine and yours

971
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:14,068
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

972
01:09:38,019 --> 01:09:39,715
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

973
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:41,350
Haven't we met before?

974
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,620
Perhaps. Don't remember.

975
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:48,357
You... aren't you Rama Sen?

976
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:53,085
She's dead. My name is Rosy.

977
01:09:56,223 --> 01:10:00,785
Tthe eyes have seen and
hearts have been incited

978
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:05,699
We both have changed so much

979
01:10:06,692 --> 01:10:11,220
So many seasons
have come and gone

980
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:15,859
We have changed so much

981
01:10:16,442 --> 01:10:20,845
You have recognised me

982
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:26,678
I am the same forgotten story

983
01:10:26,783 --> 01:10:32,689
Oh darling,
darling-darling, oh darling

984
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,755
Yours and mine

985
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,527
Mine and yours

986
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:42,682
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

987
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:09,551
Time changes a man's
position drastically.

988
01:11:09,977 --> 01:11:12,446
And it changes his
personality too, right?

989
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:18,625
There is no change in the face

990
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:23,449
What they both have gone
through, we don't know

991
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:28,907
They can complain but they don't

992
01:11:29,716 --> 01:11:33,675
What they both have gone
through, we don't know

993
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:38,757
You have recognised me

994
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:44,554
I am the same, queen of dreams

995
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:50,359
Oh darling,
darling-darling, oh darling

996
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,445
Yours and mine

997
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,343
Mine and yours

998
01:11:55,884 --> 01:11:59,989
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

999
01:12:00,326 --> 01:12:04,524
You have recognised me

1000
01:12:05,494 --> 01:12:10,379
I am the same, who
is crazy for you

1001
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:16,478
Oh darling,
darling-darling, oh darling

1002
01:12:16,519 --> 01:12:18,647
Yours and mine

1003
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:21,223
Mine and yours

1004
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:26,853
Yours and mine
friendship is very old

1005
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,522
Today I haven't drunk much.

1006
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,008
Still, I don't know
why I feel drunk.

1007
01:12:48,022 --> 01:12:49,387
Will you leave me to my home?

1008
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:56,838
Come on.

1009
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:06,225
Today don't allow
to come in anyone.

1010
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:08,701
- Anybody.
- Yes, ma'am.

1011
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,480
Come.

1012
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:18,992
Did you get married?

1013
01:13:21,108 --> 01:13:22,108
Yes.

1014
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,059
How is your wife?

1015
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:25,892
Is she very beautiful?

1016
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:27,112
She isn't bad.

1017
01:13:28,634 --> 01:13:29,965
Is she more beautiful than me?

1018
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:33,205
I have never seen in that view.

1019
01:13:38,887 --> 01:13:40,912
- Do you have children?
- No.

1020
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:44,761
Thank God. That's good.

1021
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:49,640
How is your mother, Indra?

1022
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,722
It has been quite a while
since she passed away.

1023
01:13:52,746 --> 01:13:54,737
Oh! I'm sorry.

1024
01:13:57,489 --> 01:13:59,684
She was truly a great woman.

1025
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,190
Whatever she did...

1026
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:06,195
every mother would do
for her children's good.

1027
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,481
I am certain that you
will be very happy.

1028
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:14,148
A man like you can never be sad.

1029
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:17,241
And me?

1030
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:20,540
I too wanted to be happy one day.

1031
01:14:22,187 --> 01:14:23,779
I wished for a small home.

1032
01:14:24,734 --> 01:14:27,931
A good husband and 1-2 kids.

1033
01:14:29,251 --> 01:14:32,846
But why did this happen, Inder?

1034
01:14:34,184 --> 01:14:35,184
Why?

1035
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:39,996
Didn't you have any child, Rama?

1036
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:45,683
She did. Rama did have a daughter.

1037
01:14:47,074 --> 01:14:49,167
But how can Rosy have a child?

1038
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:54,351
Rama's child stays far, far away.

1039
01:14:55,612 --> 01:14:57,580
Rosy can't even reach there.

1040
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:05,843
Rama, why did you take this path?

1041
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:09,468
Due to you! Because of you!

1042
01:15:10,494 --> 01:15:11,518
What are you saying?

1043
01:15:11,746 --> 01:15:14,772
I am right. Why did
you save me from dying?

1044
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:18,061
Rama, this path is not yours.

1045
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,570
- It would be better if you return.
- Oh shut up!

1046
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,634
Don't ty to give me advice.

1047
01:15:23,147 --> 01:15:24,842
I hate all this.

1048
01:15:25,573 --> 01:15:27,666
Today I am Delhi's
greatest call-girl.

1049
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:35,723
Do you want to know
how Rama become Rosy?

1050
01:15:36,853 --> 01:15:37,911
Listen then.

1051
01:15:39,672 --> 01:15:43,733
When your mother sent
me in a train to Kashi...

1052
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:53,877
Ticket please.

1053
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:58,967
Hello mister, ticket.

1054
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:04,911
Ticket.

1055
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:12,970
Ticket please.

1056
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:17,103
Did you not hear? Ticket please.

1057
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:21,403
Master, till this poor woman gets
her ticket... here, check my ticket.

1058
01:16:24,695 --> 01:16:25,890
- Is it alright?
- Yes.

1059
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:31,230
What is this?
This is a ticket to Banaras.

1060
01:16:32,574 --> 01:16:35,304
Banaras has already passed.

1061
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,325
Yes. You will have to pay the
fare till the next station..

1062
01:16:38,577 --> 01:16:40,101
And a fine of 10 rupees.

1063
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:44,059
But... but I don't have any money.

1064
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:46,927
If you don't have the money then
why didn't you get down at Banaras.

1065
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:48,748
Is this your father's train?

1066
01:16:49,284 --> 01:16:51,014
Oh! What are you saying?

1067
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:54,089
If you have sympathy then
why don't you pay the money?

1068
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:57,639
I have sympathy but you
should know how to talk..

1069
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,011
To talk to a lady.

1070
01:16:59,087 --> 01:17:02,420
- Tell me, how much money?
- 6 rupees for the ticket and 10 rupees fine.

1071
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:03,803
Enough.

1072
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:07,606
10 and 16. Take this money, sir.

1073
01:17:08,096 --> 01:17:11,225
- Make the receipt.
- But... but why are you...

1074
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,685
No problem. A human only helps
other human at time of needs.

1075
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,795
I am getting down on the next
station. You come to my house with me.

1076
01:17:18,225 --> 01:17:18,883
At your house.

1077
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:21,232
Don't worry. My
grandmother is also with me.

1078
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:23,273
I will board you on Banaras
train tomorrow evening.

1079
01:17:23,774 --> 01:17:25,503
- Right?
- You have done a favour on me.

1080
01:17:25,544 --> 01:17:27,512
Oh! I have not done
anything. This was my duty.

1081
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:51,297
Who?

1082
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:54,264
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

1083
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:56,684
- Listen to me.
- Leave me.

1084
01:17:56,826 --> 01:17:58,589
- Listen to me.
- For God's sake leave me.

1085
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,372
Listen to me.

1086
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:02,270
For God's sake, leave me.

1087
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:08,033
Help!

1088
01:18:32,072 --> 01:18:33,164
After that.

1089
01:18:35,442 --> 01:18:37,239
After that I ran away from there..

1090
01:18:39,324 --> 01:18:41,622
On a dark and unfamiliar street.

1091
01:18:43,247 --> 01:18:46,648
Helpless and desolate.

1092
01:18:49,748 --> 01:18:51,807
Everyone I met looked
at me with lust.

1093
01:18:53,016 --> 01:18:54,813
They were worse than animals.

1094
01:18:55,995 --> 01:18:57,257
Bloody animals.

1095
01:18:59,821 --> 01:19:02,290
I was roaming crazily
with hunger and thirst.

1096
01:19:03,837 --> 01:19:07,831
And one day. One day
I fell unconscious.

1097
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:13,357
When I regained consciousness
I was in a hospital.

1098
01:19:15,243 --> 01:19:17,939
Rama became a mother
of a child on that day.

1099
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:23,585
I felt like strangling her.

1100
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,990
But it was not her fault.

1101
01:19:28,955 --> 01:19:31,253
I forgot everything and
maternal love was born in me.

1102
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:36,126
But what could I have fed her?

1103
01:19:38,282 --> 01:19:40,273
Where every I tried
to beg for money..

1104
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:42,753
My honour was attacked there.

1105
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:48,644
Then I thought that if
this body is my enemy then..

1106
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,228
I should bet on it.

1107
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:56,980
And after that
everything became easy.

1108
01:20:00,437 --> 01:20:02,735
And one day I became
Rosy from Rama.

1109
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:07,173
After that there
wasn't any scarcity.

1110
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,927
Now I am very happy.

1111
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:14,680
Totally happy.

1112
01:20:16,284 --> 01:20:18,218
With luxuy and comfort.

1113
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:23,559
Rama.

1114
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,035
Rama.

1115
01:20:45,823 --> 01:20:48,348
Take me inside.

1116
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:29,529
Inder.

1117
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,042
Inder.

1118
01:21:33,269 --> 01:21:34,635
Get up. It is morning.

1119
01:21:36,514 --> 01:21:37,514
It is morning?

1120
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,872
You slept here.
You didn't return to the room.

1121
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:43,612
It was late in the night.

1122
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:46,183
And the condition
in which you were...

1123
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:49,802
You care for me this much.

1124
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:53,824
Get up. Wash your
face and drink tea.

1125
01:21:53,933 --> 01:21:55,298
Let's go.

1126
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:07,698
You didn't tell me
why you are in Delhi.

1127
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:13,163
Because of your favour my small
shop changed into a factory.

1128
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,637
For its contract I came here.

1129
01:22:17,588 --> 01:22:19,556
But maybe I won't
get that contract.

1130
01:22:20,999 --> 01:22:21,999
Why?

1131
01:22:22,076 --> 01:22:24,704
Because some Mr. Khosla is
in-charge of that contract.

1132
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,588
And I won't be able
to meet his conditions.

1133
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:29,409
Which Khosla?

1134
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:32,737
The one who was with 4-5
girls in the pam last night.

1135
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:34,529
Yes.

1136
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:37,086
Do you know him?

1137
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:39,654
A little.

1138
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:47,455
May I come in?

1139
01:22:48,449 --> 01:22:50,747
Hi! Rosy Darling.
Come in. Come in.

1140
01:22:52,585 --> 01:22:53,974
Where did you disappear last night?

1141
01:22:53,998 --> 01:22:55,522
I missed you in the pam.

1142
01:22:55,646 --> 01:22:57,807
Liar! You are a liar.

1143
01:22:59,088 --> 01:23:01,113
You were surrounded by many girls.

1144
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:05,205
You didn't have the
time to think about me.

1145
01:23:06,643 --> 01:23:08,976
What else could I have
done? You disappeared.

1146
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,403
I had to entertain myself some how.

1147
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:14,075
It means that you
cannot be trusted.

1148
01:23:14,802 --> 01:23:17,600
I am ready to give
even my life for you.

1149
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:22,856
Life is a very big thing.
There is a small work.

1150
01:23:23,584 --> 01:23:25,575
- Will you be able to do it?
- Why not?

1151
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:27,637
Tell me. What is it?

1152
01:23:28,218 --> 01:23:31,847
You will have to do
whatever I say? Promise.

1153
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,784
Promise.

1154
01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:40,624
- Where did you go?
- To do your work.

1155
01:23:41,095 --> 01:23:43,495
- Congratulations.
- For what?

1156
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:48,431
- The work of your Indo-German plant will be done.
- What?

1157
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:51,094
And you will get
the letter in 2 days.

1158
01:23:51,524 --> 01:23:53,349
But you will have to
arrange 1 Lakh deposit and..

1159
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:54,841
2 Lakh bank guarantee.

1160
01:23:55,412 --> 01:23:56,412
Can you do it?

1161
01:23:57,034 --> 01:23:58,525
I will have to do it somehow..

1162
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,431
How can I miss
such a big contract?

1163
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,928
I will take the evening flight
to Calcutta to arrange the money.

1164
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:05,161
What is the rush?

1165
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,125
Send a telegram And get
a draft from the office.

1166
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:09,874
And you will get
the orders by then.

1167
01:24:10,431 --> 01:24:14,959
- And then you have to come to Simla with me.
- Simla?

1168
01:24:15,703 --> 01:24:18,703
- Why do we have to go to Simla suddenly?
- Is it prohibited to go to Simla?

1169
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:22,816
- It is not prohibited. But let's first go from here.
- Let's go.

1170
01:24:25,066 --> 01:24:26,465
Did it snow there?

1171
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:30,666
Inderjeet.

1172
01:24:31,736 --> 01:24:34,604
Mr. Ashok. Excuse
me. Just a minute.

1173
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:39,894
- Greetings, Mr. Ashok.
- You are here. When did you come to Delhi?

1174
01:24:40,448 --> 01:24:42,780
I came here for one
contract. It's been 5-6 days.

1175
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:44,694
- Is every one fine at home?
- Yes.

1176
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,930
Since I was transferred here you
have stopped writing letters to me.

1177
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:49,866
Inderjeet.

1178
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:52,821
This is my card.

1179
01:24:53,178 --> 01:24:54,941
If you get time then
phone me and come.

1180
01:24:55,218 --> 01:24:56,617
I will surely ty to come.

1181
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,991
I think I have seen the woman..

1182
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:05,682
Who is with you somewhere before.

1183
01:25:05,723 --> 01:25:07,190
Yes, you must have surely seen her.

1184
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,033
She is a resident of this place.

1185
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:10,089
Alright, I will leave now.

1186
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:11,456
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1187
01:25:19,097 --> 01:25:21,190
Uncle Mahavir,
don't push like that.

1188
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,724
In this old age you are
making me play this game..

1189
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,060
What else could I do?

1190
01:25:25,466 --> 01:25:27,024
Son-in-law, you are...

1191
01:25:27,133 --> 01:25:30,068
- Thank God, I found all of you here.
- Brother. Come in.

1192
01:25:30,248 --> 01:25:31,510
Do you know what is happening?

1193
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,961
What happened,
brother? What happened?

1194
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:35,510
What happened, brother?
Why are you so scared?

1195
01:25:37,217 --> 01:25:39,242
- Did you get Mr. Inder's letter?
- No. Why?

1196
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:41,415
How could you get that?

1197
01:25:41,715 --> 01:25:43,075
- Did you receive phone call?
- No.

1198
01:25:43,245 --> 01:25:44,371
But what is the matter?

1199
01:25:45,529 --> 01:25:46,826
I received a letter..

1200
01:25:47,602 --> 01:25:50,503
Not from Mr. Inder but Mr.
Ashok regarding Mr. Inder.

1201
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,493
- Uncle's letter.
- What is written?

1202
01:25:52,703 --> 01:25:54,534
Is he fine? When is he coming?

1203
01:25:54,654 --> 01:25:55,712
He is fine.

1204
01:25:56,473 --> 01:25:58,464
But whatever
Mr. Ashok has written..

1205
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:00,724
Don't states when he will return.

1206
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:03,389
Brother, tell me clearly
what is the matter.

1207
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:07,556
Look Kamla, all of you are my
younger brothers and sisters.

1208
01:26:08,318 --> 01:26:12,220
I am even ashamed to read
this... letter in front of you.

1209
01:26:12,446 --> 01:26:13,640
Kavita, you read it.

1210
01:26:18,014 --> 01:26:20,482
Oh God! Uncle has written..

1211
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:24,108
That I met Mr. Inder
suddenly in front of an office.

1212
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,710
But I am feeling ashamed to
write that he was roaming..

1213
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:29,197
Openly with a famous prostitute.

1214
01:26:30,589 --> 01:26:33,615
No, no. It cannot be possible.

1215
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:36,682
He cannot do it. This is a lie.

1216
01:26:36,955 --> 01:26:39,458
- This is a lie.
- Elder daughter-in-law.

1217
01:26:39,577 --> 01:26:41,637
Kamla. Kamla. Don't worry.

1218
01:26:41,967 --> 01:26:43,628
As long as I am here
no one can harm you.

1219
01:26:43,844 --> 01:26:45,505
Brace yourself,
Kamla. Brace yourself.

1220
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:47,542
Enough. Enough.
Enough. Brace yourself.

1221
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:48,989
Good.

1222
01:27:03,914 --> 01:27:06,508
You sit here. I will be back.

1223
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:11,918
- Good morning Mrs. Sen. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

1224
01:27:12,037 --> 01:27:14,005
This time you have
come after a long gap.

1225
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:15,680
Yes. It's been a long time.

1226
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:17,923
But I tried to come
on parent's day.

1227
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:19,564
But I couldn't find time.

1228
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,942
- Can I meet Minu?
- Yes, sure.

1229
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:24,902
But now she is in class.

1230
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:27,671
After 10 minutes
I'll call her then.

1231
01:27:27,936 --> 01:27:30,804
- Till then you can sit in the office.
- No. You do your work.

1232
01:27:30,994 --> 01:27:33,555
- I will wait outside in the garden.
- Okay. - Thank you.

1233
01:27:40,201 --> 01:27:42,727
- Let's go.
- Not now.

1234
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:47,112
You wanted to know
why I brought you here.

1235
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:52,177
I have brought you
here to meet Minu.

1236
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,835
Minu? Your daughter.

1237
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:56,529
Yes.

1238
01:27:56,959 --> 01:28:01,453
But for her I not
here mother but aunty.

1239
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:03,216
Aunty?

1240
01:28:05,403 --> 01:28:07,735
But why did you hide from
her that you are her mother?

1241
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:10,934
What is in me that
I could be called a mother?

1242
01:28:12,189 --> 01:28:15,716
A woman like me cannot
be anyone's mother.

1243
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:19,982
But she... must have
asked you about her mother.

1244
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:25,804
She always asks. And
I always reply that..

1245
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:30,713
Daughter, God knows
where your mother went..

1246
01:28:31,967 --> 01:28:33,059
Where she is lost.

1247
01:28:34,031 --> 01:28:35,692
And when she asks
about her father..

1248
01:28:36,505 --> 01:28:38,530
Then I tell her that one
day he will surely come.

1249
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:44,495
Inder, do you know..

1250
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,659
What name I have written in
this school for her father?

1251
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:53,900
Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee.

1252
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:56,672
Rama.

1253
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:00,961
Yes, Inder.

1254
01:29:01,697 --> 01:29:05,155
Besides you nobody was
there whom I could trust.

1255
01:29:06,706 --> 01:29:08,867
Therefore I made use of your name.

1256
01:29:09,741 --> 01:29:12,575
I know that I don't
have any rights on you.

1257
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:17,617
But still to make my
daughter's future bright..

1258
01:29:18,552 --> 01:29:20,383
I took this right
without asking you.

1259
01:29:22,907 --> 01:29:26,001
But Rama, but giving Minu
my name you have even..

1260
01:29:26,748 --> 01:29:28,512
Detached her from your name.

1261
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:30,539
There was no other option.

1262
01:29:31,435 --> 01:29:32,561
I was afraid of Ajit.

1263
01:29:33,691 --> 01:29:35,454
One day he will
return from prison..

1264
01:29:35,965 --> 01:29:37,523
And will surely find me.

1265
01:29:38,243 --> 01:29:39,870
And take my daughter away from me.

1266
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:42,119
But now...

1267
01:29:43,259 --> 01:29:45,625
Ajit doesn't have any
relationship with Minu.

1268
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:48,384
By linking Minu's name
with your name I have..

1269
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:50,916
Made her a better person.

1270
01:29:54,391 --> 01:29:56,825
Look Minu. Your aunty
has come to meet you.

1271
01:29:57,233 --> 01:29:59,098
Aunty? My aunty.

1272
01:29:59,504 --> 01:30:00,504
Aunty.

1273
01:30:01,287 --> 01:30:02,287
Minu.

1274
01:30:04,493 --> 01:30:05,493
Minu.

1275
01:30:06,954 --> 01:30:08,581
My sweet, sweet Minu.

1276
01:30:09,996 --> 01:30:12,021
Aunty, I won't talk to you.

1277
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:13,449
Why?

1278
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:15,725
Because you didn't come to
meet her for so many days.

1279
01:30:16,086 --> 01:30:19,180
Oh! I was stuck in a
very important work.

1280
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:23,730
I am sorry. Are
you upset now? Come.

1281
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:28,354
She is Minu. Say
hello to him, child.

1282
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:31,133
Hello.

1283
01:30:31,988 --> 01:30:34,980
- Aunty, who is he?
- Make a guess.

1284
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:41,229
You didn't recognize me.

1285
01:30:42,101 --> 01:30:43,932
Child, I am your daddy.

1286
01:30:46,365 --> 01:30:47,365
Inder!

1287
01:30:48,262 --> 01:30:49,854
Daddy, my daddy.

1288
01:30:50,465 --> 01:30:51,762
Yes, child. I am your daddy.

1289
01:30:52,772 --> 01:30:55,002
Why didn't you come to
meet me for so many days?

1290
01:30:55,244 --> 01:30:56,598
I made a mistake, daughter.

1291
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,664
You aunty didn't tell
me that you are here.

1292
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:03,939
Rama, I will tell the principle.
Today Minu will be with us.

1293
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:14,478
- Head-clerk.
- Yes.

1294
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:15,968
Inderjeet has sent a telegram.

1295
01:31:16,244 --> 01:31:17,963
- Is everything fine?
- Yes, everything is fine.

1296
01:31:17,987 --> 01:31:19,725
Inder went for that German proiect.

1297
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,308
That work has been done. He
has asked for 1 Lakh rupees.

1298
01:31:22,332 --> 01:31:23,332
Check this.

1299
01:31:25,151 --> 01:31:27,119
Then send it. You
have the blank cheque.

1300
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,906
I have the blank cheque
therefore I have come to you.

1301
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,505
You are the accountant.
Fill this cheque.

1302
01:31:30,529 --> 01:31:31,529
Alright.

1303
01:31:38,433 --> 01:31:39,433
Give me.

1304
01:31:40,504 --> 01:31:41,504
I will cash it.

1305
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:43,933
How could it happen?

1306
01:31:44,728 --> 01:31:46,491
What happened. Who
has sent this telegram?

1307
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:49,977
I asked for 1 Lakh rupees to
pay the deposit for the contract.

1308
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:52,581
He has replied that
there is no money.

1309
01:31:53,647 --> 01:31:56,616
Then what is there to worry?
Maybe there is no money.

1310
01:31:56,899 --> 01:31:57,957
How could it be possible?

1311
01:31:57,998 --> 01:32:00,057
Before coming I had deposited
the money in the bank.

1312
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:04,878
Rama, I will have to go to
Calcutta by the morning flight.

1313
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:16,092
We won't resume our work
till we get our salary.

1314
01:32:16,133 --> 01:32:18,465
Yes. We won't work.

1315
01:32:19,182 --> 01:32:21,886
We won't resume our work
till we get our salary.

1316
01:32:21,927 --> 01:32:23,827
Yes. We won't work.

1317
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:27,541
We won't resume our work
till we get our salary.

1318
01:32:27,582 --> 01:32:29,516
- We won't work. We won't work.
- Shut up!

1319
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,212
What is the matter, Shankar?
Why are they not working?

1320
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:33,897
They didn't get their salary, sir.

1321
01:32:34,062 --> 01:32:35,760
What do you mean they
didn't get the salary?

1322
01:32:35,784 --> 01:32:38,014
Hemant, I arranged
everything before leaving.

1323
01:32:38,658 --> 01:32:41,456
Mr. Avinash can only
answer this question.

1324
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:45,405
You don't worry.

1325
01:32:45,548 --> 01:32:47,641
Your salary will be
paid today, go to work.

1326
01:32:47,848 --> 01:32:49,975
Let's go.

1327
01:32:52,297 --> 01:32:53,594
Both of you come with me.

1328
01:32:59,744 --> 01:33:01,974
- Where is Avinash?
- He's not come from two days, sir.

1329
01:33:02,346 --> 01:33:04,872
We've called him he
said he's not well.

1330
01:33:06,807 --> 01:33:08,502
Why didn't send draft on Delhi.

1331
01:33:08,628 --> 01:33:12,325
After your telegram received Avinash
has withdrawal money from bank.

1332
01:33:12,389 --> 01:33:15,586
If money had withdrawn
why he not sent.

1333
01:33:16,747 --> 01:33:19,614
Call to head-clerk. Tell him
bring account book. I'll check.

1334
01:33:20,858 --> 01:33:23,122
Shanker, you go to Avinash's
house and bring him here.

1335
01:33:23,539 --> 01:33:25,648
And listen, if he doesn't
come willingly then bring him..

1336
01:33:25,672 --> 01:33:27,264
- With force.
- Alright, sir.

1337
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,900
Hello.

1338
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,717
Yes, Mukherjee speaking.

1339
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:37,338
What? Payment of your
bill has not been made yet.

1340
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:40,674
But... but I arranged
evening before leaving.

1341
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:45,603
Well, any you
give me a week time.

1342
01:33:46,096 --> 01:33:47,893
Please. Thank you.

1343
01:33:54,537 --> 01:33:55,697
Oh God!

1344
01:33:56,528 --> 01:33:58,223
I have been completely ruined.

1345
01:33:59,564 --> 01:34:01,674
I am totally broke.

1346
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:05,251
If I had know it before then...

1347
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:12,415
- Any, Hemant...
- Yes, sir.

1348
01:34:13,728 --> 01:34:17,129
You go to the bank and take
out all the balance money.

1349
01:34:17,934 --> 01:34:21,131
- And first give the salary to the workers.
- Yes.

1350
01:34:22,263 --> 01:34:23,263
Take.

1351
01:34:24,986 --> 01:34:26,419
- Head-clerk.
- Yes.

1352
01:34:28,182 --> 01:34:29,813
We will have to shut down
this factory from tomorrow.

1353
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:32,204
- What are you saying, sir?
- I have been ripped-off.

1354
01:34:32,686 --> 01:34:33,778
I have been cheated.

1355
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:38,595
I don't have any to run
this factory. Shut it down.

1356
01:34:39,891 --> 01:34:42,451
Sir, if you would talk
to the workers then...

1357
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:45,759
What should I say? That you
work without taking salary.

1358
01:34:46,156 --> 01:34:47,470
Starve your children and
wives to death to maintain..

1359
01:34:47,494 --> 01:34:48,961
My industrialist status.

1360
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:51,229
Maintain my honour on
the foundation of a lie.

1361
01:34:51,508 --> 01:34:54,238
I am not a bloody
hypocrite. I can't do it.

1362
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:58,176
You can go. You...

1363
01:35:02,562 --> 01:35:04,029
What is the matter, Inder?

1364
01:35:05,993 --> 01:35:08,188
Why did you force me to come here?

1365
01:35:10,077 --> 01:35:14,912
Reason! I want to know
the reason from you.

1366
01:35:18,904 --> 01:35:20,304
Alright. Alright. Alright.

1367
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,141
So say that.

1368
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:24,434
Tell me what do you want to know.

1369
01:35:24,774 --> 01:35:27,242
- Accounts.
- Accounts are in front of you. You can see it.

1370
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:29,307
These are all bogus.

1371
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:31,908
If is it bogus then ask your
accountant. Ask your head-clerk.

1372
01:35:33,026 --> 01:35:36,484
I calculate the payment and
gave all that money to you.

1373
01:35:37,193 --> 01:35:38,956
Then why didn't the
workers get their salary?

1374
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:40,964
Why are the payments
of the parties due?

1375
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,061
Why didn't you send me the draft?

1376
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:45,982
Where did all that money go?

1377
01:35:46,286 --> 01:35:47,981
I neither cashed any cheque..

1378
01:35:48,394 --> 01:35:49,918
Nor do I know anything about it.

1379
01:35:50,793 --> 01:35:51,793
Alright. I am going.

1380
01:35:51,862 --> 01:35:53,352
Shanker. Tell the guard..

1381
01:35:53,393 --> 01:35:55,987
That don't let Mr. Avinash
leave from here till I say so.

1382
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:57,425
Yes, sir.

1383
01:35:57,677 --> 01:36:01,010
Oh! So you want to
hold me here with force.

1384
01:36:01,896 --> 01:36:03,420
Alright. I will call the police.

1385
01:36:03,941 --> 01:36:06,876
I'll have to call the police if
I don't get the details of the accounts.

1386
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:12,382
Brother, whom are you threatening?

1387
01:36:13,261 --> 01:36:15,126
To my servant.

1388
01:36:15,893 --> 01:36:18,225
Servant. Who is the servant?

1389
01:36:18,798 --> 01:36:19,798
Whose servant?

1390
01:36:20,243 --> 01:36:23,474
Did I take salary from
you? Do you have any proof?

1391
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:25,358
Any receipt or voucher.

1392
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,148
The truth is that Mr. Inder you
don't know how to do business.

1393
01:36:35,986 --> 01:36:38,319
There is a difference
between doing business and..

1394
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,022
Mery-making with
a prostitute in Delhi.

1395
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:44,255
You scoundrel! Get out of here.

1396
01:36:44,927 --> 01:36:47,157
Alright. I will go if you say so.

1397
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,039
But call me when you need me.

1398
01:36:49,258 --> 01:36:50,452
I say get out.

1399
01:37:13,587 --> 01:37:15,488
What is the matter?
You didn't sleep yet.

1400
01:37:18,235 --> 01:37:20,362
- Are you ill?
- Don't touch me.

1401
01:37:21,197 --> 01:37:22,494
What happened to you suddenly?

1402
01:37:22,535 --> 01:37:24,867
- Something happened to me or to you.
- What do you mean?

1403
01:37:29,607 --> 01:37:31,302
Take this and read your misdeed.

1404
01:37:35,294 --> 01:37:38,525
I never even dreamt that
you could be so immoral.

1405
01:37:39,493 --> 01:37:41,985
I thought you were God. But you...

1406
01:37:42,267 --> 01:37:43,267
Listen, Kamla.

1407
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:47,194
If you can believe
others then you..

1408
01:37:48,011 --> 01:37:49,376
Will have to listen to me too.

1409
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:50,831
There is not need.

1410
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:53,612
Today I found out why
we don't have any child.

1411
01:37:54,396 --> 01:37:57,183
The wife, whose husband indulges
himself with a prostitute..

1412
01:37:57,614 --> 01:38:01,175
Can neither have a
child nor peace of mind..

1413
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:02,216
Kamla.

1414
01:38:19,451 --> 01:38:22,852
Drinking is not a sin.
Serving drink is not a sin.

1415
01:38:23,212 --> 01:38:26,375
But to be conscious
after drinking is a sin.

1416
01:38:26,825 --> 01:38:32,718
- Do you who wrote this?
- Yes, definitely not Tagore.

1417
01:38:33,126 --> 01:38:34,321
One double pack.

1418
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:38,838
Mr. Inder. You?
Greetings, greetings.

1419
01:38:39,405 --> 01:38:41,873
Ah... Hello. Hello Mr. Ghosh.

1420
01:38:42,477 --> 01:38:43,808
Why would you like to drink?

1421
01:38:43,849 --> 01:38:45,988
I always drink something
while sitting, standing..

1422
01:38:46,029 --> 01:38:47,929
Sleeping and waking.

1423
01:38:48,638 --> 01:38:50,401
This cruel thing doesn't leave me.

1424
01:38:51,252 --> 01:38:54,221
But you... how did you
get stuck in her trap?

1425
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,831
Mr. Ghosh, things are
not done for any reason.

1426
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:03,397
We make a reason to
console ourselves.

1427
01:39:03,536 --> 01:39:05,552
Wow! You have said a great thing.

1428
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:07,952
- Did you hear?
- Yes. He said a great thing.

1429
01:39:08,376 --> 01:39:11,903
Bartender. Bring a
whole bottle for that.

1430
01:39:13,358 --> 01:39:14,358
Drink it.

1431
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:20,117
Drink it.

1432
01:39:31,249 --> 01:39:32,318
Where are you going?

1433
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:34,384
Can't you see that your
God-like father is coming..

1434
01:39:34,425 --> 01:39:36,154
Totally intoxicated?

1435
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,680
Let's go.

1436
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:46,767
Where were you? Don't
you care for anyone?

1437
01:39:48,126 --> 01:39:49,559
Who cares for me?

1438
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:52,643
You... you can go.

1439
01:39:54,382 --> 01:39:56,317
I don't need anyone's sympathy.

1440
01:39:58,608 --> 01:39:59,608
You go.

1441
01:40:39,131 --> 01:40:42,259
You must be feeling hatred..

1442
01:40:43,072 --> 01:40:45,233
To see your husband
in this condition.

1443
01:40:45,676 --> 01:40:53,676
Drunkard, characterless,
who indulges with prostitutes.

1444
01:41:00,035 --> 01:41:01,935
Wait. Wait.

1445
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:04,433
Look,

1446
01:41:05,657 --> 01:41:10,822
I brought you in this house
with the dignity of a wife.

1447
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:14,300
This... this is your house.

1448
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:19,102
If anyone has to go from this
house then it will be me..

1449
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,864
Not you.

1450
01:41:23,124 --> 01:41:24,124
Not you.

1451
01:42:42,269 --> 01:42:43,635
Eat the breakfast, elder brother.

1452
01:42:44,038 --> 01:42:46,700
No, uncle. I don't
feel like eating.

1453
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:49,114
You didn't even eat
anything last night.

1454
01:42:49,799 --> 01:42:51,699
If I will fee hungry
I will eat in the office.

1455
01:42:53,849 --> 01:42:55,742
God knows what
happened to both of you.

1456
01:42:55,783 --> 01:42:57,717
He neither eats anything
nor do you say anything.

1457
01:43:06,944 --> 01:43:08,377
Mr. Avinash, why are you here.

1458
01:43:09,059 --> 01:43:10,493
Why have I come? What do you mean?

1459
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:13,221
I have come to meet my
sister, Mrs. Kamla Mukherjee.

1460
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:15,375
She is my wife and
this is my house.

1461
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:17,069
Without my permission you
can neither come here..

1462
01:43:17,093 --> 01:43:18,560
- Nor meet her.
- Get out of here.

1463
01:43:20,047 --> 01:43:21,071
Get out from here?

1464
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:23,502
I have come to meet my
sister and you are saying get out.

1465
01:43:23,889 --> 01:43:27,189
Mr. Mukherjee if you want to stop
me from coming in this house..

1466
01:43:28,295 --> 01:43:29,922
Then give divorce to my sister.

1467
01:43:30,059 --> 01:43:32,426
She won't stay here
and I won't come here.

1468
01:43:33,549 --> 01:43:34,607
Very simple.

1469
01:43:46,855 --> 01:43:48,618
Kamla. Kamla.

1470
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,347
Yes, brother.
What is the problem?

1471
01:43:50,546 --> 01:43:52,208
I say that he has lost his mind.

1472
01:43:53,433 --> 01:43:54,593
Why? What happened?

1473
01:43:54,774 --> 01:43:56,560
What could happen? He is
under the influence of..

1474
01:43:56,584 --> 01:43:58,143
That promiscuous woman
and enjoying himself.

1475
01:43:58,167 --> 01:44:00,829
And he is keen to destroy you
and all the family members.

1476
01:44:01,104 --> 01:44:02,901
What more has happened,
brother Avinash?

1477
01:44:03,137 --> 01:44:04,469
What has not happened?

1478
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:08,292
He is ready to sell house,
factory, business everything.

1479
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:09,482
- What?
- Did you hear?

1480
01:44:09,551 --> 01:44:11,712
I had my doubts.
Now what will happen of us?

1481
01:44:12,835 --> 01:44:15,360
I am a servant and
I should say anything but..

1482
01:44:15,697 --> 01:44:19,326
Elder brother won't do
anything to harm anyone..

1483
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:20,610
Or to hurt anyone.

1484
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:22,849
Uncle Mahavir, don't
talk in the middle.

1485
01:44:23,424 --> 01:44:24,755
Alright, I won't talk.

1486
01:44:27,434 --> 01:44:29,026
He has spoilt this old man.

1487
01:44:29,507 --> 01:44:31,567
Debo, this is not the
time to sit quietly.

1488
01:44:31,713 --> 01:44:32,802
You should be aleftt too.

1489
01:44:33,062 --> 01:44:34,996
Yes, brother. We
have to do something.

1490
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,553
And Kamla, I am telling you again.

1491
01:44:36,859 --> 01:44:38,845
Take the rein of this house
or else you will repent..

1492
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:39,961
For your whole life.

1493
01:45:02,425 --> 01:45:03,790
Do you want to say something?

1494
01:45:03,879 --> 01:45:05,599
Who and what can anyone
say to someone who..

1495
01:45:05,673 --> 01:45:07,301
Doesn't have anytime to listen.

1496
01:45:07,661 --> 01:45:09,595
But I can't face
anyone because of..

1497
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:12,484
What you have started nowadays.

1498
01:45:12,817 --> 01:45:16,583
I am sorry. But you should
know that at present..

1499
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:19,812
I am facing many
difficulties. Because of it...

1500
01:45:19,853 --> 01:45:21,844
You have created
difficulties for yourself.

1501
01:45:22,579 --> 01:45:24,723
It is not humanity for us
to face the problem because..

1502
01:45:24,747 --> 01:45:26,078
Of your misdeeds.

1503
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:29,051
Do you want us to leave this house?

1504
01:45:30,762 --> 01:45:32,821
No. I don't want that.

1505
01:45:34,624 --> 01:45:37,320
But nowadays situation
are such that we will..

1506
01:45:37,361 --> 01:45:38,726
Have to sell this house.

1507
01:45:39,447 --> 01:45:41,506
No. You cannot do that.

1508
01:45:42,078 --> 01:45:43,568
Debo has a share in
this property too.

1509
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:46,968
No one has any share in it.

1510
01:45:47,229 --> 01:45:49,595
This house and this factory
is the result of my hard..

1511
01:45:49,772 --> 01:45:51,171
Work and efforts.

1512
01:45:51,253 --> 01:45:53,084
- No one has any right on it.
- What?

1513
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:55,099
- No one has any right on it.
- No!

1514
01:45:55,469 --> 01:45:57,562
You have degraded
yourself for you happiness.

1515
01:45:57,965 --> 01:45:59,057
But remember,

1516
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:01,481
I won't allow you to do
it as long as I am alive.

1517
01:46:14,766 --> 01:46:17,667
Mr. Inder. You are still here.

1518
01:46:17,821 --> 01:46:19,186
Bravo! Bravo!

1519
01:46:20,728 --> 01:46:24,062
But sir, you are insulting liquor.

1520
01:46:25,848 --> 01:46:28,521
You are drinking
quickly it like water.

1521
01:46:29,744 --> 01:46:34,477
This is liquor. Drink it with
love, with ease, with respect..

1522
01:46:34,665 --> 01:46:36,189
And with comfort.

1523
01:46:38,087 --> 01:46:39,987
Thank you for your
advice, Mr. Ghosh.

1524
01:46:41,736 --> 01:46:43,897
But nowadays
I don't consume liquor.

1525
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:47,493
Liquor is consuming me.

1526
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:51,333
Wow! Marvellous!
Marvellous! You said a great thing.

1527
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:55,077
Bartender. Give me a
whole bottle for that.

1528
01:46:57,071 --> 01:46:58,071
Rama, you?

1529
01:46:58,817 --> 01:47:00,546
What condition you
have made of yourself?

1530
01:47:00,701 --> 01:47:03,135
Condition? Why? I am fine.

1531
01:47:04,192 --> 01:47:06,660
- How come you are here?
- I came with Khosla.

1532
01:47:06,806 --> 01:47:09,138
He went to Madras for 2 days.

1533
01:47:09,701 --> 01:47:13,398
I've called on your home and
factory. But you were not there.

1534
01:47:14,236 --> 01:47:15,932
I didn't hope to find you here.

1535
01:47:16,772 --> 01:47:18,933
It as a desire of a true heart.

1536
01:47:19,463 --> 01:47:21,761
Therefore we met after
I lost all hope.

1537
01:47:22,856 --> 01:47:24,187
You never used to drink before.

1538
01:47:24,931 --> 01:47:26,899
Now you've started
drinking even during the day.

1539
01:47:27,087 --> 01:47:28,087
And this much.

1540
01:47:28,683 --> 01:47:33,052
How much? There is no
restriction on drinking liquor.

1541
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:35,979
And then whether
it is day or night..

1542
01:47:36,764 --> 01:47:37,788
It is the same.

1543
01:47:38,114 --> 01:47:39,604
What are you saying?

1544
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:41,849
Come with me to my room.

1545
01:47:41,929 --> 01:47:43,396
It is really a big tragedy, Inder.

1546
01:47:45,986 --> 01:47:47,544
It is not easily to make reaction..

1547
01:47:48,277 --> 01:47:50,302
If there is a conflict because..

1548
01:47:51,663 --> 01:47:53,663
.Of some misunderstanding
between husband and wife.

1549
01:47:55,709 --> 01:47:58,269
So, what should I do?
What is my fault in it?

1550
01:48:00,327 --> 01:48:02,955
- It is my fault, Inder.
- What do you mean?

1551
01:48:05,097 --> 01:48:08,534
Because of me... because of
me you are in this condition.

1552
01:48:10,748 --> 01:48:13,808
I linked your name with
mine, which disgraced you.

1553
01:48:14,686 --> 01:48:16,847
The peace and happiness of
your house were destroyed.

1554
01:48:18,103 --> 01:48:22,233
For a characterless woman
like me your life was ruined.

1555
01:48:23,501 --> 01:48:26,868
Inder. I cannot forgive myself.

1556
01:48:27,252 --> 01:48:29,447
No, Rama. Don't say that.

1557
01:48:34,391 --> 01:48:38,158
No matter what the world
think of you but I respect you.

1558
01:48:39,723 --> 01:48:41,884
I cannot bear to hear
anything against you.

1559
01:48:45,323 --> 01:48:47,257
I will leave.

1560
01:48:59,953 --> 01:49:00,953
Goodnight.

1561
01:49:04,906 --> 01:49:05,906
Goodnight.

1562
01:49:15,054 --> 01:49:16,054
Poison!

1563
01:49:19,022 --> 01:49:22,048
No Inder, you won't do this.

1564
01:49:36,721 --> 01:49:37,881
Rama. You?

1565
01:49:38,827 --> 01:49:41,262
Now you are engrossed in
thoughts of someone else..

1566
01:49:42,073 --> 01:49:43,713
While sleeping and
while you are awake.

1567
01:49:45,373 --> 01:49:48,570
No, Kamla. This is not the case.

1568
01:49:53,642 --> 01:49:54,700
Just think.

1569
01:49:55,803 --> 01:49:57,563
If you don't support
me and think that I am..

1570
01:49:58,631 --> 01:50:01,031
Wrong after getting
incited by the other people..

1571
01:50:03,034 --> 01:50:04,714
Then what will be
the consequence of it.

1572
01:50:06,257 --> 01:50:07,724
Now what consequence is left?

1573
01:50:08,492 --> 01:50:12,361
That you will remove all
of you from the house.

1574
01:50:13,759 --> 01:50:17,627
And you will settle your
life with some other woman.

1575
01:50:19,965 --> 01:50:22,798
No, Kamla. Don't say that.

1576
01:50:23,881 --> 01:50:25,007
Trust me.

1577
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:29,606
If I had loved
anyone then it's you.

1578
01:50:30,904 --> 01:50:32,030
Only you.

1579
01:50:46,384 --> 01:50:48,579
- I am bored of the atmosphere at home.
- Yes.

1580
01:50:48,919 --> 01:50:51,080
Today we will eat food
outside and watch a movie.

1581
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:53,534
I will take you out for
lunch and show you a movie.

1582
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:55,129
- Junior boss.
- Yes. - Telegram.

1583
01:51:04,677 --> 01:51:07,305
Inderjeet. It is for brother.
I will give it to him.

1584
01:51:07,346 --> 01:51:08,938
Wait. See what is written in it.

1585
01:51:14,635 --> 01:51:19,038
Everything arranged.
Come immediately. Rosy.

1586
01:51:20,228 --> 01:51:22,219
- It is from Delhi.
- Again Delhi?

1587
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:23,559
But who is this Rosy?

1588
01:51:24,898 --> 01:51:26,092
Brother is coming.

1589
01:51:27,394 --> 01:51:29,420
Brother. This telegram is for you.

1590
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:31,858
It was opened in a hurry.

1591
01:51:35,584 --> 01:51:38,451
Uncle Mahavir, pack and suitcase
and send it to my office.

1592
01:51:38,995 --> 01:51:40,995
I will have to go to Delhi
by the afternoon flight.

1593
01:51:41,058 --> 01:51:42,082
Give this to me.

1594
01:51:48,886 --> 01:51:50,582
Brother. You are the
older than all of us.

1595
01:51:51,218 --> 01:51:52,651
Therefore we have called you..

1596
01:51:52,825 --> 01:51:54,520
We don't know what to do.

1597
01:51:55,794 --> 01:51:57,386
The matter is really very serious.

1598
01:51:58,082 --> 01:52:00,550
I couldn't even think
that a man can become..

1599
01:52:00,591 --> 01:52:01,745
So immoral. Shame! Shame!

1600
01:52:02,217 --> 01:52:03,577
What are you tying
to say, brother?

1601
01:52:03,732 --> 01:52:05,990
Kamla, it is clearly
written in the telegram.

1602
01:52:06,071 --> 01:52:08,583
- Everything arranged. Come immediately.
- Yes.

1603
01:52:08,841 --> 01:52:10,985
Do you know its
meaning? everything arranged.

1604
01:52:11,026 --> 01:52:12,865
All the arrangements of
the wedding has been done.

1605
01:52:12,889 --> 01:52:14,448
Come immediately. Come quickly.

1606
01:52:15,293 --> 01:52:18,922
- No. No.
- Kamla, you are very innocent.

1607
01:52:19,457 --> 01:52:23,052
You don't know but before you
marriage Mr. Inder brought..

1608
01:52:23,093 --> 01:52:25,061
A girl named Rama to his house.

1609
01:52:25,521 --> 01:52:28,618
But brother, the name of the person
who has sent telegram was Rosy.

1610
01:52:28,713 --> 01:52:30,682
It could be a mistake
of the post office.

1611
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,650
- They wrote Rosy in place of Rama.
- No.

1612
01:52:33,093 --> 01:52:35,357
It can't be possible.
I cannot believe it.

1613
01:52:35,488 --> 01:52:37,718
If you don't believe me then
ask Debo. Speak up, Debo.

1614
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,221
Yes, sister-in-law.
Brother brought a girl.

1615
01:52:43,171 --> 01:52:46,436
Elder brother had protected
a girl who was in difficulty.

1616
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:49,291
What is the relationship of
that girl with the elder brother?

1617
01:52:49,315 --> 01:52:52,580
Debo, today your servant is
intering in our matter again.

1618
01:52:53,891 --> 01:52:54,983
And I don't like it.

1619
01:52:55,404 --> 01:53:00,052
Alright. I won't interfere.
But daughter-in-law, it is not..

1620
01:53:00,093 --> 01:53:02,493
Right to blame anyone without
seeing and hearing yourself.

1621
01:53:05,823 --> 01:53:09,763
Alright. Debo, I will
go to Delhi today.

1622
01:53:11,239 --> 01:53:13,969
I want to see with my eyes.

1623
01:53:21,331 --> 01:53:22,331
This is bungalow.

1624
01:53:25,604 --> 01:53:26,604
See that.

1625
01:53:44,462 --> 01:53:45,861
Driver, follow them.

1626
01:53:59,030 --> 01:54:00,030
Did you see?

1627
01:54:00,187 --> 01:54:01,716
He is withdrawing
cash from the bank.

1628
01:54:01,757 --> 01:54:03,884
Now I found out why all
the money of the office..

1629
01:54:04,049 --> 01:54:06,330
Has been transferred in
State bank. This is the reason.

1630
01:54:06,477 --> 01:54:07,967
Look there. Look there.

1631
01:54:08,912 --> 01:54:12,076
Rama, you have saved my
honour. How could I thank...

1632
01:54:12,122 --> 01:54:13,122
Enough, Inder.

1633
01:54:15,518 --> 01:54:17,383
They are holding each
other's hand with love.

1634
01:54:17,584 --> 01:54:19,347
Is there are any scope
IeR not to suspect?

1635
01:54:27,943 --> 01:54:30,207
Now do you believe? Do you
want to see anything more?

1636
01:54:30,577 --> 01:54:32,408
No, brother. Let's go home now.

1637
01:54:33,286 --> 01:54:34,514
Driver, come.

1638
01:54:50,705 --> 01:54:51,705
Uncle.

1639
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:55,281
Why is there darkness?

1640
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:58,315
For whom should
I turn on the light?

1641
01:54:58,531 --> 01:54:59,531
Everyone left.

1642
01:55:00,115 --> 01:55:01,515
Left? Where?

1643
01:55:02,282 --> 01:55:03,374
I don't know.

1644
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:06,352
The daughter-in-law might
have gone to her parent's house.

1645
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:12,016
I tried to stop them.
But nobody listened to me.

1646
01:55:13,693 --> 01:55:16,128
Everyone left, uncle.
Why didn't you leave?

1647
01:55:17,807 --> 01:55:20,139
I am an ordinary man, big brother.

1648
01:55:21,067 --> 01:55:23,968
I am not educated
and wise like them.

1649
01:55:25,174 --> 01:55:27,335
I have raised you in my laps.

1650
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:32,111
And now I will keep my
head on you lap and die.

1651
01:55:33,406 --> 01:55:36,375
Take the keys of the
room and cupboard.

1652
01:56:30,364 --> 01:56:32,423
'I am going away from
your life forever ♪

1653

You?

1655
01:56:50,974 --> 01:56:53,167
Why did you take the trouble to
come here late in the night.

1656
01:56:53,191 --> 01:56:54,191
Where is Kamla?

1657
01:56:55,421 --> 01:56:57,252
Kamla... your wife?

1658
01:56:58,522 --> 01:56:59,682
Yes. My wife.

1659
01:57:01,692 --> 01:57:04,388
Do I have to keep the
information of the place..

1660
01:57:04,756 --> 01:57:07,554
Where someone's wife
will go leaving him?

1661
01:57:09,305 --> 01:57:12,001
Kamla is not only my
wife but also your sister.

1662
01:57:12,632 --> 01:57:15,624
- You took advantage of this thing and ruined my house.
- Shut up!

1663
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:20,378
You insulted me in your
factory. I didn't say anything.

1664
01:57:21,502 --> 01:57:24,700
You insulted me in your
house. I was silent.

1665
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:27,669
Remember, this is my house.
If you will utter a word...

1666
01:57:27,779 --> 01:57:30,552
I have not come to
hear your nonsense.

1667
01:57:30,665 --> 01:57:32,428
- Tell me where is Kamla.
- I don't know.

1668
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:33,774
You don't know.

1669
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:35,907
Tell me where she is. Tell me.

1670
01:57:36,722 --> 01:57:38,638
I will tell you.
First leave my neck.

1671
01:57:42,533 --> 01:57:45,367
Kamla, committed suicide.

1672
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:52,163
No. You are lying.

1673
01:57:52,888 --> 01:57:55,550
No. I am not lying.

1674
01:57:57,393 --> 01:57:59,560
These hands raised her..

1675
01:58:00,721 --> 01:58:02,712
And now these hands
lighted her pyre.

1676
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,539
I am so unfortunate.

1677
01:58:06,099 --> 01:58:07,819
But it was good as
she got rid of a..

1678
01:58:08,266 --> 01:58:11,394
Immoral and characterless
husband like you.

1679
01:58:12,052 --> 01:58:13,974
Go away. Get out of here.

1680
01:58:14,033 --> 01:58:15,661
I don't even want to see your face.

This is our small house,
the dream of my life.

This shouldn't be
shattered, my dear.

1683
01:58:49,349 --> 01:58:51,408
Elder brother.. Look,
from where they have come

1684
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:52,939
and what are they saying.

1685
01:58:53,754 --> 01:58:56,120
- Are you Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee?
- Yes.

1686
01:58:56,453 --> 01:58:58,512
- There is summon-order for you.
- Summon?

1687
01:58:58,813 --> 01:58:59,813
Yes.

1688
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:02,074
Sign here.

1689
01:59:07,338 --> 01:59:09,203
Thank you. Let's go.

1690
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:12,768
This court-case. What is
the matter, elder brother?

1691
01:59:16,247 --> 01:59:18,580
I am immoral and dishonest.

1692
01:59:20,336 --> 01:59:22,566
- I have cheated my younger brother.
- What?

1693
01:59:23,052 --> 01:59:25,714
I have confiscated his
share from father's property.

1694
01:59:27,138 --> 01:59:30,369
Uncle, Debo has filed
a case against me.

1695
01:59:32,811 --> 01:59:36,747
I swear to say the truth
and nothing but the truth.

1696
01:59:39,208 --> 01:59:41,803
- What is your name?
- Devjeet Mukherjee.

1697
01:59:42,536 --> 01:59:45,994
- Do you know Rosy?
- Yes.

1698
01:59:46,895 --> 01:59:49,455
Tell me, Mr. Mukherjee,
where did you see Rosy..

1699
01:59:49,496 --> 01:59:51,191
For the first time.

1700
01:59:52,128 --> 01:59:54,119
When I reached Delhi..

1701
01:59:55,153 --> 01:59:57,212
With sister-in-law and
Avinash following brother.

1702
01:59:57,922 --> 02:00:00,152
Why were you following him?

1703
02:00:00,556 --> 02:00:04,287
Because my wife's uncle wrote
a letter first to inform us..

1704
02:00:04,742 --> 02:00:06,872
About the relationship
between brother and Rosy.

1705
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:08,409
And then a telegram from Rosy.

1706
02:00:08,661 --> 02:00:11,095
This letter and the telegram,
both have been deposited..

1707
02:00:11,136 --> 02:00:12,694
With the court, Your Honour.

1708
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:23,735
- Proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

1709
02:00:24,019 --> 02:00:27,779
Mr. Mukherjee, when you
saw Rosy in Delhi then..

1710
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:28,912
What did you think?

1711
02:00:29,708 --> 02:00:32,268
That those people are
so happy and cheerful

1712
02:00:32,946 --> 02:00:34,379
and we are so sad and troubled.

1713
02:00:34,986 --> 02:00:36,419
What do you mean by 'those people'?

1714
02:00:36,703 --> 02:00:41,072
- Bother, Rosy and...
- And?

1715
02:00:41,638 --> 02:00:44,129
And who else? Tell us. Tell us.

1716
02:00:44,334 --> 02:00:45,859
Why are you scared?

1717
02:00:46,737 --> 02:00:49,104
And their daughter, whom
brother had held in his arms.

1718
02:00:49,385 --> 02:00:52,411
Yes, daughter. I hope
this has been recorded.

1719
02:00:55,274 --> 02:00:58,505
Can you tell me from where
did your brother used to get..

1720
02:00:58,546 --> 02:01:00,173
So much money to spend?

1721
02:01:00,898 --> 02:01:02,729
He used to get the
money from the office.

1722
02:01:02,975 --> 02:01:05,307
That day we saw
brother withdrawing..

1723
02:01:05,662 --> 02:01:07,095
Money from the bank.

1724
02:01:07,985 --> 02:01:11,944
And Your Honour, the truth
is that we have filed a case..

1725
02:01:12,464 --> 02:01:14,540
In the court so that brother
won't spend all the money..

1726
02:01:14,564 --> 02:01:16,764
In this manner or else we
would be denied our rights.

1727
02:01:17,209 --> 02:01:18,724
That is all, Your Honour.

1728
02:01:19,385 --> 02:01:21,718
You may cross-examine if you like.

1729
02:01:22,202 --> 02:01:23,202
Thank you.

1730
02:01:29,779 --> 02:01:31,610
Mr. Devjeet Mukherjee..

1731
02:01:32,268 --> 02:01:35,032
When in Delhi your brother was
withdrawing money out of the bank..

1732
02:01:35,607 --> 02:01:36,767
Then where you with him?

1733
02:01:36,886 --> 02:01:37,886
Ah... no.

1734
02:01:38,659 --> 02:01:40,024
So where were you at that time?

1735
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,669
- Outside the bank, in a taxi.
- Alright.

1736
02:01:43,753 --> 02:01:47,383
Do you have a special
microscope through which..

1737
02:01:47,424 --> 02:01:50,979
- You can see through the walls.
- No.

1738
02:01:51,118 --> 02:01:52,966
Then how did you see that
your brother took the money..

1739
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:53,990
From the bank.

1740
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,442
I just made a guess.

1741
02:01:57,483 --> 02:01:58,507
You made a guess.

1742
02:02:00,139 --> 02:02:01,698
Alright. Mr. Devjeet Mukherjee..

1743
02:02:02,509 --> 02:02:06,001
Is it true that while dying your
father left many loans to be paid.

1744
02:02:06,595 --> 02:02:08,893
Yes. But I don't
know the exact amount.

1745
02:02:09,509 --> 02:02:11,875
But you must know that your
brother paid those loans.

1746
02:02:11,916 --> 02:02:13,577
After selling the shop..

1747
02:02:14,119 --> 02:02:16,144
And started the factory
with the help of a friend.

1748
02:02:16,526 --> 02:02:17,823
That's what my brother says.

1749
02:02:18,029 --> 02:02:19,860
- But you don't believe him.
- Pardon...

1750
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,170
No.

1751
02:02:23,428 --> 02:02:27,387
Mr. Devjeet Mukherjee, can
I ask you what would have..

1752
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,584
Been the price of your father's
shop according to your estimation.

1753
02:02:32,243 --> 02:02:33,783
Around 10-15 thousand rupees.

1754
02:02:34,007 --> 02:02:36,805
Your Honour, note this
point that the person..

1755
02:02:37,086 --> 02:02:40,886
Who has half share in the
property of 10-15 thousand rupees..

1756
02:02:41,021 --> 02:02:44,582
Is now claiming half share of his
brother's property of 20 Lakh rupees.

1757
02:02:45,581 --> 02:02:46,673
That's all Your Honour.

1758
02:02:47,048 --> 02:02:48,048
Next witness.

1759
02:02:50,191 --> 02:02:51,556
Mr. Avinash,

1760
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:55,050
were you an employee in
Inderjeet Mukherjee's factory.

1761
02:02:55,526 --> 02:02:56,526
Shame!

1762
02:02:57,118 --> 02:03:00,451
Can a gentleman work at the
place of his brother-in-law?

1763
02:03:00,839 --> 02:03:02,864
Then what work you used
to do in his factory.

1764
02:03:03,656 --> 02:03:06,648
Sir, I used to check his
accounts on his request..

1765
02:03:06,951 --> 02:03:09,191
Sometimes, especially when
he used to travel to Delhi.

1766
02:03:09,548 --> 02:03:10,981
What was his business in Delhi?

1767
02:03:13,402 --> 02:03:14,801
I don't know about business.

1768
02:03:14,965 --> 02:03:17,092
But he used to take
Lakhs of rupees there..

1769
02:03:17,257 --> 02:03:18,451
And return empty-handed.

1770
02:03:19,153 --> 02:03:21,883
When I used to ask him to
which account should I credit..

1771
02:03:22,326 --> 02:03:24,556
The money he used
to say to adjust it.

1772
02:03:24,751 --> 02:03:27,720
Adjust. Have this point
be noted, Your Honour.

1773
02:03:27,854 --> 02:03:29,755
So, do you adjust?

1774
02:03:30,641 --> 02:03:34,008
Can a simple and honest
man like me do such fraud?

1775
02:03:34,706 --> 02:03:38,836
And then, in that money Debo
and my sister had a share.

1776
02:03:39,193 --> 02:03:41,432
I thought about it and refused him.

1777
02:03:41,487 --> 02:03:42,545
And I quit the job.

1778
02:03:43,078 --> 02:03:46,241
Do you know a woman named Rosy?

1779
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:51,730
Rosy? Yes, I saw her
in Delhi with Inderjeet.

1780
02:03:52,131 --> 02:03:53,962
And a small girl
was also with them.

1781
02:03:54,003 --> 02:03:56,056
Small girl! You mean daughter.

1782
02:03:58,331 --> 02:03:59,856
- Yes.
- Their own daughter?

1783
02:04:01,092 --> 02:04:03,219
- Yes.
- That's all, Your Honour.

1784
02:04:04,081 --> 02:04:05,081
Daughter.

1785
02:04:07,334 --> 02:04:09,325
Call girl scandal,
shakes Mukherjee family.

1786
02:04:09,925 --> 02:04:12,486
Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee, a
Calcutta business magnate..

1787
02:04:13,264 --> 02:04:15,631
Is being prosecuted for
having an illicit relationship..

1788
02:04:15,672 --> 02:04:17,867
With Rosy, a Delhi call girl.

1789
02:04:19,256 --> 02:04:20,622
This was very bad.

1790
02:04:22,835 --> 02:04:24,063
What happened, aunty?

1791
02:04:25,645 --> 02:04:26,805
Nothing, Minu.

1792
02:04:27,565 --> 02:04:28,565
Nothing.

1793
02:04:30,799 --> 02:04:34,938
Your Honour, the testimonies
of all the witnesses who..

1794
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:37,540
Have come so far proves
that Mr. Inderjeet Mukherjee..

1795
02:04:37,733 --> 02:04:42,865
Is a liar, fraud, cheat
and characterless man.

1796
02:04:43,899 --> 02:04:47,163
Now I will present a
witness who is herself..

1797
02:04:47,204 --> 02:04:48,671
A victim of his iniustice.

1798
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:52,418
That is his wife,
Mrs. Kamla Mukherjee.

1799
02:05:20,398 --> 02:05:25,229
Your Honour, a victim of
her husband's injustice..

1800
02:05:25,343 --> 02:05:28,104
Helpless and desolate, Kamla Devi
is present in front of the court.

1801
02:05:29,344 --> 02:05:32,802
She was troubled and
cheated every moment.

1802
02:05:33,753 --> 02:05:37,484
Still this goddess-like woman
longed for her husband's love.

1803
02:05:38,523 --> 02:05:41,307
But what did she get in
return? What did she get?

1804
02:05:42,086 --> 02:05:44,612
Insult! Humiliation!

1805
02:05:45,258 --> 02:05:46,816
She got tired of it
and left her house.

1806
02:05:47,056 --> 02:05:50,924
And when Inderjeet Mukherjee
heard that she committed suicide..

1807
02:05:51,073 --> 02:05:53,838
Then he didn't even ty to
find out the truth Your Honour.

1808
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:55,685
But he heaved a sigh of relief.

1809
02:05:55,819 --> 02:05:59,688
Your Honour, will my able
friend keep on giving lecture..

1810
02:05:59,753 --> 02:06:01,793
Or give a chance to the
witness to say something.

1811
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:05,213
Mr. Gosh. Examine
the witness please.

1812
02:06:06,413 --> 02:06:08,916
Yes, Your Honour. In a moment.

1813
02:06:14,186 --> 02:06:20,489
Kamla Devi, your property like
car, bungalow and factory..

1814
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:23,351
Doest it belong to your
husband or father-in-law?

1815
02:06:24,107 --> 02:06:25,734
I don't know the details.

1816
02:06:26,199 --> 02:06:28,099
You are the elder
daughter-in-law of the house.

1817
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:31,030
Still you don't even know this
thing about your family matter.

1818
02:06:31,575 --> 02:06:33,668
It is not the work of elder
daughter-in-law to keep..

1819
02:06:33,756 --> 02:06:35,315
An eye on the property.

1820
02:06:36,472 --> 02:06:39,101
What was the financial
condition of your in-laws..

1821
02:06:39,386 --> 02:06:41,854
.At the time of your marriage?

1822
02:06:42,597 --> 02:06:46,055
Ordinary. After that my
husband established a factory.

1823
02:06:46,519 --> 02:06:47,714
Bought a bungalow.

1824
02:06:47,786 --> 02:06:49,617
Where did the money
come from for this?

1825
02:06:50,782 --> 02:06:53,148
Only my husband knows
that. I don't know.

1826
02:06:56,248 --> 02:07:00,708
Do you know a woman named Rosy?

1827
02:07:03,144 --> 02:07:04,144
Answer me.

1828
02:07:06,969 --> 02:07:11,838
Yes. I saw here in Delhi.
She was with my husband.

1829
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:14,838
He had a girl in his arms.

1830
02:07:15,845 --> 02:07:17,107
Who was that girl?

1831
02:07:20,157 --> 02:07:21,283
His daughter.

1832
02:07:22,392 --> 02:07:25,156
So, did he mary secretly
for the second time?

1833
02:07:27,446 --> 02:07:28,446
Maybe.

1834
02:07:31,273 --> 02:07:32,797
That's all, Your Honour.

1835
02:07:33,734 --> 02:07:35,895
- Your witness.
- Thank you.

1836
02:07:43,497 --> 02:07:44,589
Kamla Devi..

1837
02:07:45,143 --> 02:07:47,778
Can I ask you what is
your accusation against..

1838
02:07:47,819 --> 02:07:50,776
Your husband, Mr.
Inderjeet Mukherjee.

1839
02:07:51,022 --> 02:07:53,253
Ah... nothing.

1840
02:07:53,838 --> 02:07:56,807
Your Honour, please be kind
enough to note the point.

1841
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:03,848
Kamla Devi, do you
love your husband?

1842
02:08:04,944 --> 02:08:08,744
It is a wife's duty to love
and take care of her husband.

1843
02:08:10,568 --> 02:08:13,901
Did your husband drive
you out of the house?

1844
02:08:17,634 --> 02:08:19,101
He is not so heartless.

1845
02:08:19,848 --> 02:08:21,748
I left his house
willingly with my own wish.

1846
02:08:21,812 --> 02:08:22,812
Why?

1847
02:08:23,626 --> 02:08:24,991
For his happiness.

1848
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:27,899
Why did you spread the
false rumour of your suicide?

1849
02:08:30,259 --> 02:08:31,726
It was also for his happiness.

1850
02:08:33,946 --> 02:08:35,914
What joy could your husband
get because of your..

1851
02:08:36,565 --> 02:08:38,533
Leaving the house or death?

1852
02:08:43,748 --> 02:08:44,748
Answer me.

1853
02:08:47,034 --> 02:08:50,595
As I have told you before
he has a second wife..

1854
02:08:51,662 --> 02:08:54,028
Whose name was Rama
before and Rosy now.

1855
02:08:55,401 --> 02:08:59,428
Because of two families my
husband used to be in a dilemma.

1856
02:09:00,218 --> 02:09:02,377
He started drinking liquor.

1857
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:05,738
I couldn't bear to see his pain.

1858
02:09:06,483 --> 02:09:10,604
Therefore I left the house
and spread the news of suicide.

1859
02:09:11,426 --> 02:09:13,792
So that he will be
freed from my obligation.

1860
02:09:14,994 --> 02:09:17,929
You only tell me, iudge.
Did I do anything wrong?

1861
02:09:18,504 --> 02:09:21,064
I did something that
all the wives should do?

1862
02:09:21,812 --> 02:09:23,837
A wife's life is in
her husband's happiness.

1863
02:09:24,909 --> 02:09:28,845
The woman who gave him a child
has the true right on him.

1864
02:09:29,151 --> 02:09:33,393
Not mine. Don't ask
me anything more judge.

1865
02:09:33,434 --> 02:09:36,961
I don't want to say anything else.

1866
02:09:39,855 --> 02:09:41,401
- Sister-in-law.
- Kamla.

1867
02:09:41,547 --> 02:09:43,412
Your Honour, could
you excuse the defence?

1868
02:09:43,609 --> 02:09:45,941
Mr. Sen, don't ask the
witness anything else now.

1869
02:09:46,417 --> 02:09:47,417
Yes, Your Honour.

1870
02:09:49,162 --> 02:09:51,256
- Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law..
- Kamla.

1871
02:09:51,707 --> 02:09:52,707
Come.

1872
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:06,481
Call to next witness.

1873
02:10:06,553 --> 02:10:08,646
Mrs. Rosy come.

1874
02:10:33,112 --> 02:10:34,962
Put your hand on the
Geeta (holy book) and say..

1875
02:10:34,986 --> 02:10:37,284
I will say only the truth
and nothing but the truth.

1876
02:10:37,448 --> 02:10:40,008
I will say only the truth
and nothing but the truth.

1877
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:43,754
By the way I don't say
anything except the truth.

1878
02:10:44,404 --> 02:10:46,737
- What is your name?
- Which name?

1879
02:10:47,326 --> 02:10:48,588
How many names you have?

1880
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:51,389
Whoever calls me by
any name with love.

1881
02:10:52,192 --> 02:10:54,776
Will Your Honour kindly ask the
witness to take off her glasses?

1882
02:10:55,378 --> 02:10:58,006
The witness should be told to
remove the glasses and testify.

1883
02:10:58,784 --> 02:11:00,376
Is it necessay, Your Honour?

1884
02:11:00,799 --> 02:11:02,790
It will be better if
you remove your glasses.

1885
02:11:05,987 --> 02:11:08,854
Tell the court the name
that your mother and father..

1886
02:11:09,990 --> 02:11:11,583
Miss Rama Chaudhari.

1887
02:11:12,185 --> 02:11:13,880
And what are your other names?

1888
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:16,477
Rama Sen after getting married.

1889
02:11:16,809 --> 02:11:18,538
And Rosy at present.

1890
02:11:18,812 --> 02:11:21,007
It means that Rama and
Rosy are the 2 names of..

1891
02:11:21,206 --> 02:11:22,332
The same girl.

1892
02:11:24,092 --> 02:11:26,390
I have many other names, lawyer.

1893
02:11:27,262 --> 02:11:33,135
Darling, Beautiful,
Preety and Fair.

1894
02:11:33,693 --> 02:11:38,528
Some even call me
Sweetheart and Beloved.

1895
02:11:39,096 --> 02:11:41,394
How do you know
Inderjeet Mukherjee?

1896
02:11:43,207 --> 02:11:44,731
What do you mean by 'how'?

1897
02:11:45,317 --> 02:11:46,716
Isn't it enough that I know him?

1898
02:11:47,537 --> 02:11:49,062
Did you ever give him money?

1899
02:11:50,779 --> 02:11:52,804
Yes. I gave him.

1900
02:11:53,545 --> 02:11:54,545
When?

1901
02:11:55,771 --> 02:11:57,932
One time when I was Rama Sen.

1902
02:11:58,977 --> 02:12:01,070
I gave him jewellery of
around 25, OOO rupees worth..

1903
02:12:01,498 --> 02:12:03,967
Which he sold to
start his factory.

1904
02:12:04,878 --> 02:12:07,972
- Then?
- Then few months ago, when someone..

1905
02:12:08,735 --> 02:12:11,033
Did a fraud of 3 Lakh
rupees in his factory..

1906
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:15,260
I forced him to take 3 Lakh
rupees to save his factory.

1907
02:12:15,926 --> 02:12:17,518
Do you have any proof of that?

1908
02:12:18,696 --> 02:12:20,357
Yes, I have.

1909
02:12:21,463 --> 02:12:22,845
This is the statement of the bank..

1910
02:12:22,869 --> 02:12:24,461
From where I withdrew the money.

1911
02:12:27,497 --> 02:12:30,625
Your Honour, this
statement proves her point.

1912
02:12:31,623 --> 02:12:34,285
That's all Your Honour.
My learned friend may take over.

1913
02:12:40,779 --> 02:12:43,270
Rama Devi, alias Miss Rosy.

1914
02:12:43,971 --> 02:12:46,712
Where did you get the 3 Lakh
rupees that you gave to..

1915
02:12:46,753 --> 02:12:49,182
Inderjeet Mukherjee?

1916
02:12:50,385 --> 02:12:51,579
That is the money I earned.

1917
02:12:52,237 --> 02:12:54,900
How and when did you
earn so much money?

1918
02:12:56,064 --> 02:12:57,691
Obviously, not in a day.

1919
02:12:58,709 --> 02:13:01,029
I earned it in many years after
continuous saving of money.

1920
02:13:01,808 --> 02:13:04,972
- Is it necessay to tell how I earned it?
- Yes.

1921
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:06,667
It is necessay.

1922
02:13:07,089 --> 02:13:10,855
The answer is that, I earned
it when I took the path..

1923
02:13:11,565 --> 02:13:13,499
Which is called path
of sin by the people.

1924
02:13:14,247 --> 02:13:15,646
Oh! I see.

1925
02:13:16,128 --> 02:13:18,858
Therefore you came in the
court wearing this dress.

1926
02:13:19,765 --> 02:13:22,928
Why? I didn't get an
order from the court..

1927
02:13:23,596 --> 02:13:25,393
To wear a veil while coming.

1928
02:13:28,853 --> 02:13:31,117
Order. Order. Please proceed.

1929
02:13:32,031 --> 02:13:35,023
You told my able friend
that you know Inderjeet..

1930
02:13:35,064 --> 02:13:38,625
Mukherjee, but you didn't
tell how you know him?

1931
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:45,088
There are few people whom the
heart recognizes at first sight.

1932
02:13:45,192 --> 02:13:49,492
Really? And only because of this
acquaintance a daughter was born.

1933
02:13:50,154 --> 02:13:52,182
That child belongs
to Rama Sen. Not Rosy.

1934
02:13:52,368 --> 02:13:57,526
Don't ty to talk in riddles in
the court. Answer my question!

1935
02:14:00,557 --> 02:14:02,212
My blemish has no
relationship with the..

1936
02:14:02,619 --> 02:14:04,587
Birth of my daughter.

1937
02:14:05,133 --> 02:14:07,966
Your Honour, if you give
permission I would like..

1938
02:14:08,414 --> 02:14:11,008
- To say few more things about myself.
- Speak up.

1939
02:14:13,825 --> 02:14:14,825
Thank you.

1940
02:14:16,062 --> 02:14:19,054
By the way, it is not a new thing..

1941
02:14:20,829 --> 02:14:23,059
But still a burden my
heart might get some comfort..

1942
02:14:23,576 --> 02:14:25,373
By telling it in
front of the court.

1943
02:14:26,669 --> 02:14:29,797
Your Honour, I have
faced many sufferings.

1944
02:14:30,623 --> 02:14:32,454
I have suffered my
many difficulties.

1945
02:14:33,191 --> 02:14:34,658
To save my daughter..

1946
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:37,610
I was forced to take
up this sinful work.

1947
02:14:39,036 --> 02:14:43,735
Today... today I am an
infamous and immoral woman.

1948
02:14:44,707 --> 02:14:46,334
People hate me.

1949
02:14:47,588 --> 02:14:50,312
Maybe... maybe that is the
reason why I didn't make..

1950
02:14:50,353 --> 02:14:52,471
A mistake in
recognizing Inderjeet.

1951
02:14:54,132 --> 02:14:57,124
People play with my body. But...

1952
02:14:58,513 --> 02:15:00,708
but Inderjeet never thought
of me in that manner.

1953
02:15:01,912 --> 02:15:05,507
He could have done many
things but he didn't.

1954
02:15:07,384 --> 02:15:09,864
This society obiects to a
friendship between a man and a woman.

1955
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:13,932
Especially when a rich
and married man is friend..

1956
02:15:13,973 --> 02:15:15,964
With a woman like me.

1957
02:15:17,373 --> 02:15:20,171
Maybe this is the reason
why Inderjeet has to face..

1958
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:21,941
This blemish the court today.

1959
02:15:25,366 --> 02:15:29,769
But... but Inderjeet's wife Kamal
Devi is to be blamed for this.

1960
02:15:31,259 --> 02:15:35,662
I accuse her that she couldn't
understand her husband.

1961
02:15:36,273 --> 02:15:37,831
She didn't even ty
to understand him.

1962
02:15:38,724 --> 02:15:42,057
She didn't love her husband.
She didn't trust him.

1963
02:15:42,896 --> 02:15:44,727
But she doubted him. Hated him.

1964
02:15:45,574 --> 02:15:47,371
Her brother, Avinash,
committed a fraud of..

1965
02:15:47,412 --> 02:15:48,972
3 Lakh rupees in
Inderjeet's factory.

1966
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:53,507
Still Inderjeet didn't take
any legal action against him..

1967
02:15:54,521 --> 02:15:56,113
For her happiness.

1968
02:15:57,802 --> 02:16:01,101
The wife didn't even know
that her husband used to walk..

1969
02:16:02,329 --> 02:16:04,388
Around with a bottle
of poison in his pocket..

1970
02:16:05,388 --> 02:16:07,686
To save his honour
by giving his life.

1971
02:16:10,537 --> 02:16:13,665
Your Honour, the people
for whose happiness..

1972
02:16:14,339 --> 02:16:18,777
Inderi spend his whole life,
what did they give Inder in return.

1973
02:16:19,713 --> 02:16:23,291
Only disgrace, hatred
and accusation of robbey.

1974
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:28,404
If anyone who understood
the pain of this great man..

1975
02:16:28,491 --> 02:16:30,517
Who was on the verge
of destruction then..

1976
02:16:31,757 --> 02:16:36,559
That was this immoral
and dim woman, Rosy..

1977
02:16:37,547 --> 02:16:39,413
Who wanted nothing in return.

1978
02:16:40,602 --> 02:16:44,766
I... I had only one
desire, Your Honour.

1979
02:16:46,254 --> 02:16:50,486
The daughter for whom I had
to take us this dim work..

1980
02:16:51,632 --> 02:16:54,568
No one in this world
except Inder could save her.

1981
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:56,980
Inder...

1982
02:16:58,805 --> 02:17:02,502
lnder only you could
save Minu. Only you.

1983
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:07,409
Save her, Inder. Save her.

1984
02:17:09,559 --> 02:17:10,559
Save her.

1985
02:17:18,815 --> 02:17:20,544
The court is adiourned for the day.

1986
02:17:28,434 --> 02:17:30,493
You wait here. I will
talk to the lawyer.

1987
02:18:16,906 --> 02:18:17,906
Let's go.

1988
02:18:23,512 --> 02:18:25,412
Sister-in-law, what happened?

1989
02:18:27,699 --> 02:18:29,394
You shouldn't have come here.

1990
02:18:30,228 --> 02:18:32,588
What was the need to disgrace
yourself in front of everyone?

1991
02:18:33,995 --> 02:18:36,589
How could I toleftate to see
Minu's father getting disgraced?

1992
02:18:39,016 --> 02:18:41,576
- How is Minu?
- She is fine.

1993
02:18:42,379 --> 02:18:46,213
She is in the hotel. She
was always asks about you.

1994
02:18:47,147 --> 02:18:48,147
Minu is here.

1995
02:18:49,402 --> 02:18:50,402
Brother.

1996
02:18:50,674 --> 02:18:53,234
- What is the problem, Debo?
- Broher, sister-in-law has fainted.

1997
02:19:00,221 --> 02:19:01,221
Kamla!

1998
02:19:01,482 --> 02:19:03,182
Why are you standing and staring
at our face? Go and get water.

1999
02:19:03,206 --> 02:19:04,206
- Yes.

2000
02:19:04,421 --> 02:19:06,446
Kamla, what happened?

2001
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:09,879
Kamla. Kamla.

2002
02:19:29,812 --> 02:19:31,837
- Brother.
- What is the matter, Debo?

2003
02:19:33,573 --> 02:19:37,134
Brother, I am responsible for
sister-in-law's this condition.

2004
02:19:37,722 --> 02:19:39,849
Brother Avinash's words put
a blindfold over my eyes.

2005
02:19:41,266 --> 02:19:42,927
- Please forgive me.
- Dear..

2006
02:19:43,895 --> 02:19:45,590
Whatever happened was for our good.

2007
02:19:45,821 --> 02:19:49,223
The trust that is created
after mistrust never breaks.

2008
02:19:50,578 --> 02:19:53,672
And I think it was needed. Right?

2009
02:19:54,808 --> 02:19:55,808
Brother.

2010
02:19:58,685 --> 02:20:00,744
Brother, please forgive me.

2011
02:20:01,404 --> 02:20:05,670
What is this? You are the daughter-in-law
amd prestige of this house.

2012
02:20:05,832 --> 02:20:09,097
Elder brother, sister-in-law is
conscious now. She is calling you.

2013
02:20:16,233 --> 02:20:18,565
Kamla, are you fine?

2014
02:20:19,179 --> 02:20:20,669
Why did you bring me here?

2015
02:20:22,748 --> 02:20:25,080
A wife's right place is
in her husband's house.

2016
02:20:26,052 --> 02:20:28,331
If I had known that you are
fine then I would have brought..

2017
02:20:28,355 --> 02:20:29,355
You long ago.

2018
02:20:29,686 --> 02:20:32,553
I made a big mistake
by not trusting you.

2019
02:20:33,702 --> 02:20:35,602
But you too broke your pledge.

2020
02:20:36,514 --> 02:20:37,640
Which pledge?

2021
02:20:38,298 --> 02:20:40,199
On our first night
you promised me..

2022
02:20:40,792 --> 02:20:42,817
That we won't suffer
from any suspicion.

2023
02:20:47,742 --> 02:20:51,109
Whatever had to
happen has happened.

2024
02:20:51,765 --> 02:20:53,630
But listen; now don't
fight with me again.

2025
02:20:56,443 --> 02:20:57,443
I won't.

2026
02:20:58,731 --> 02:20:59,731
I won't.

2027
02:21:02,549 --> 02:21:05,211
- Yes. Where did she go?
- Who?

2028
02:21:05,502 --> 02:21:07,026
That... Your Rama.

2029
02:21:07,398 --> 02:21:08,471
What do you want?

2030
02:21:08,512 --> 02:21:10,758
That she should become great
by sacrificing everything for us

2031
02:21:10,782 --> 02:21:12,582
and I should be inferior
in front of everyone.

2032
02:21:13,677 --> 02:21:16,510
- Do you want to meet her?
- Yes. Take me to her now.

2033
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:25,077
Hello.

2034
02:21:25,118 --> 02:21:26,983
Rama. Please forgive me.

2035
02:21:27,116 --> 02:21:29,676
I couldn't meet you while leaving
from the court in a hurry.

2036
02:21:30,155 --> 02:21:33,921
- Inder, how is your wife now?
- She is fine now.

2037
02:21:34,473 --> 02:21:38,409
- Listen, she is restless to meet you.
- Me?

2038
02:21:38,939 --> 02:21:40,338
If you don't mind then...

2039
02:21:41,468 --> 02:21:45,496
No. Why would I mind? It
is a very happy occasion.

2040
02:21:46,473 --> 02:21:48,100
She can come whenever she wants.

2041
02:21:48,397 --> 02:21:51,457
- Alright. We will come now.
- Alright.

2042
02:22:01,259 --> 02:22:03,193
- Minu.
- Yes aunty.

2043
02:22:08,366 --> 02:22:10,061
Do you whom I was talking to?

2044
02:22:10,967 --> 02:22:15,768
- To your father.
- Father? Why didn't you call me?

2045
02:22:15,912 --> 02:22:17,345
I won't talk to you.

2046
02:22:18,910 --> 02:22:23,904
Don't be upset, child. He
is coming here to meet you.

2047
02:22:24,643 --> 02:22:27,203
Really? Father is
coming to meet me.

2048
02:22:29,030 --> 02:22:31,624
Yes, child. He is
coming to meet you.

2049
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:36,141
He will take you along with him.

2050
02:22:38,702 --> 02:22:40,294
He has a very big house.

2051
02:22:41,287 --> 02:22:43,278
There are many toys for you.

2052
02:22:44,388 --> 02:22:47,585
Everyone will love you
there. Love you very much.

2053
02:22:49,247 --> 02:22:52,216
- Will you come with me?
- I?

2054
02:22:53,648 --> 02:22:57,415
How can I go? My house
is somewhere else.

2055
02:22:58,605 --> 02:23:00,664
How can I live with your father?

2056
02:23:02,194 --> 02:23:04,526
Aunty, why are you crying?

2057
02:23:06,684 --> 02:23:10,484
I am afraid, Minu. He
might force me to come.

2058
02:23:11,835 --> 02:23:15,100
Aunty, you do one
thing. You go and hide.

2059
02:23:18,330 --> 02:23:22,494
Hide? Yes. This will be good.

2060
02:23:23,074 --> 02:23:26,237
- But you don't tell them.
- No.

2061
02:23:27,722 --> 02:23:31,351
He will look for me but
he won't find me anywhere.

2062
02:23:32,271 --> 02:23:34,330
It will be fun. Right?

2063
02:23:41,730 --> 02:23:44,221
Tell me Mr. Avinash,
why did you come here?

2064
02:23:44,466 --> 02:23:47,492
When I heard the Kamla was
ill I became very anxious.

2065
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:49,600
- Kamla, how are you now?
- Get away from me.

2066
02:23:49,893 --> 02:23:52,165
You have come to show your
sympathy. Aren't you ashamed?

2067
02:23:52,425 --> 02:23:53,824
What are you saying, Kamla?

2068
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,232
After all he is your elder brother.

2069
02:23:56,471 --> 02:23:58,166
God shouldn't give a
brother like him to anyone.

2070
02:23:58,190 --> 02:24:00,681
- Kamla.
- You ruined our happy life.

2071
02:24:00,952 --> 02:24:03,443
I don't even want to see
your face. Go from here.

2072
02:24:03,726 --> 02:24:04,726
I say go away.

2073
02:24:06,888 --> 02:24:07,888
Mr. Avinash.

2074
02:24:09,374 --> 02:24:11,467
Go. Get out!

2075
02:24:52,754 --> 02:24:54,847
- Minu.
- Father.

2076
02:24:56,138 --> 02:24:57,537
Look, child. Whom have I brought?

2077
02:24:59,146 --> 02:25:00,511
Can you tell me who she is?

2078
02:25:02,277 --> 02:25:03,608
You wanted to meet your mother?

2079
02:25:05,964 --> 02:25:07,124
She is your mother.

2080
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:10,210
- My mother.
- Yes, child.

2081
02:25:11,205 --> 02:25:12,399
I am your mother.

2082
02:25:14,978 --> 02:25:18,744
- Are you really my mother?
- Yes child. I am your mother.

2083
02:25:20,049 --> 02:25:21,658
Now you won't leave me alone?

2084
02:25:21,699 --> 02:25:24,498
Child, I will never
leave you alone now.

2085
02:25:24,772 --> 02:25:26,331
I won't go anywhere.

2086
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:31,835
Aunty, come out. Don't be scared.

2087
02:25:31,899 --> 02:25:33,367
Mother has come with father.

2088
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:39,319
Rama.

2089
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:46,640
Rama.

2090
02:26:06,706 --> 02:26:07,706
Rama.

2091
02:26:25,122 --> 02:26:28,558
'Inder, I don't want to live
as a problem in your life

2092
02:26:30,006 --> 02:26:31,006
'I am going

2093
02:26:32,001 --> 02:26:34,937
'Maybe the path of my life
has reached its destination

2094
02:26:36,671 --> 02:26:39,572
'If I have anything
then it is only Minu

2095
02:26:40,857 --> 02:26:43,052
'I am going giving her
responsibility to you

2096
02:26:44,264 --> 02:26:46,425
'Besides you there is no one
for her whom I can give.

2097
02:26:46,466 --> 02:26:47,865
'..This responsibility

2098
02:26:48,447 --> 02:26:56,354
'But if Kamla obiects then you
can send her to some orphanage

2099
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:02,029
'And listen. Today
I am left with nothing

2100
02:27:03,677 --> 02:27:07,078
'If possible pay the hotel bill

2101
02:27:10,293 --> 02:27:11,293
Where is Rama?
