4
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,909
An twist came in my life too.

5
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,911
A big one twist.

6
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,331
Which changed my life.

7
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,257
Actually, lets start with begining..

8
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,224
Since childhood in this house..

9
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,811
used live with my parents
and grand parents.

10
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,189
when l reached to 8 years,
the parents died.

11
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,317
my grand parents grew me up.

12
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,571
when l was a child,
so obviously l was cute.

13
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:39,034
people used to say while
pulling my cheeks..

14
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,579
and thats sweetness was the
business of my grandpa..

15
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,831

00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,472
the grandpa always poked his
nose in my love life.

19
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:05,769
Sometime l gets his call,
or sometimes he appears like a toad.

20
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,854
couldn't get the chance for romance.

21
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,275
So the marriage questions is
total wront..

22
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,988

23
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,283
i believe that my grandpa was
die hard fan of sachin.

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,870

die word in his life..

25
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,873
the just passed but he didn't passed..

374
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:41,821

375
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,532

sine your child hood.

376
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,576
therefore you dont know tamil

377
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,162
appa seems my story very geniune.

378
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,041

for deciding our future.

379
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:58,171
not decided the future but
taking to ruining my future.

380
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,345

381
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:08,431
now entire the village will
run after you

382
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,309

386
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,157
to see the small family of mina..

387
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,826
i reminded of china's population

388
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,871
mina started to recite the
chennai express's story

389
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,956
as much the story got progressed.

390
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,083
everybody were impressed by me

391
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,543
but l was depressed.

392
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,045
there was stress in mind.

393
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,547
because on the address l had come

394
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:26,593
where's environment was dangerous.

395
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,935
everybody was involved in my serving.

396
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:40,357
but this treatment is also for
the victim

397
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,785
many times l said to bobby,
take the fancy number.

398
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,789
to the person's number l was
trying to contact.

399
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,376
those all were vanished from
my brains pane.

400
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:03,672
mobile's this technology gets
us connect with our mom and sis..

401
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,217
but this technology screwed us too

402
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:08,551
when mobile wasn't exist..

403
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,428

404
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:15,141

00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:17,879

that matter is not about right or wrong.

441
00:47:56,876 --> 00:48:00,547
the matter is of his prestige.

693
01:24:23,271 --> 01:24:25,648
i told them the reason of eloping..

694
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:27,067
