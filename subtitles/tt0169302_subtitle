1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000


3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


4
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,650
Traitor!

5
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,220
Tie him up!

6
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,830
It's a bad omen.

7
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,890
A defector's eyes
should not fall on us.

8
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,870
Kill him!

9
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,540
He must not live!

10
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,880
My brother died
because of this renegade!

11
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,410
Traitor.

12
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,020
Your betrayal
killed seven among us.

13
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,420
velu, Paranthaman,
Pannir, Surya...

14
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,650
they all died.

15
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,860
Chandran was captured
and took cyanide.

16
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,260
You violated your family...

17
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,600
and your blood brothers!

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,410
No turncoat escapes us.

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,940
Your fate will be a lesson
to others like you.

20
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,380
The person who saw it all...

21
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,680
will settle the score.

22
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,720
Malli.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,090
Everyone here is proud of you.

24
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,560
They hero-worship you.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,900
But I am different.

26
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,700
Remember the shoot-out
under the bridge?

27
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,030
I fought like one
possessed by Malli.

28
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,010
The blood surged within me.

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,970
If you were a man,
I'd marry you.

30
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,990
We are surrounded.

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,630
One of them is getting away.

32
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,100
Malli!

33
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,610
The execution is necessary.

34
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,080
That vlP is blocking
our movement.

35
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,940
This time we should not fail.

36
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,950
Fire!

37
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,990
Let us take our decision
to its conclusion.

38
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,260
We need a suicide-bomber
as a volunteer.

39
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,270
Select a girl from Camp 14.

40
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,900
Each one of you is eligible.

41
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,110
The chosen one will meet
and lunch with our Leader...

42
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,780
and embark on the mission
with blessings.

43
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,080
Anuradha.

44
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,090
-Priya.
-Tara.

45
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,610
-Sumitra.
-Malli.

46
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,360
Age seventeen.

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,990
-Twenty.
-Seventeen.

48
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,200
-Nineteen.
-Eighteen.

49
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,700
Five years' experience.

50
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,140
Trained in many Camps.
Now in Camp 14.

51
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,970
I was three years in Camp 7.
Two years now in Camp 14.

52
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,410
I was captured once.

53
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,940
In the struggle, I lost my arm.

54
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,580
I was in jail for two years,
but I escaped.

55
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,590
A child was in the jeep, so...

56
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,490
I hesitated in pressing
the trigger.

57
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,820
It won't happen again.

58
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,920
Thirty operations,
all successful.

59
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm ready for anything.
I want to achieve.

60
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,300
I'll die in the attempt.
I need this opportunity.

61
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,800
Mentally, I'm still strong.
I'll fight to death.

62
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,930
My father was a revolutionary
nationalist poet.

63
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,270
O comrade, be vigilant.

64
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,200
You can sleep after death.

65
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,370
Until then, fight on.

66
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,430
If today, our flesh merges
with the soil...

67
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,270
tomorrow,
this country can be ours.

68
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,340
Select me.
I'll welcome the mission.

69
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,010
I want to die a martyr.

70
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,750
My death should not be
a routine one.

71
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,910
I want to die in glory.

72
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,580
I will give my life
for my country.

73
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,520
Sumitra had hopes, but...

74
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,970
Malli, you won.

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,130
Move out fast!

76
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,100
An army truck is on its way.

77
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,570
Malli, you stay.

78
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,660
Complete the task.
Take all care.

79
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,600
Perumal, keep in touch.

80
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,040
My man will reach you soon.
I need feedback.

81
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,600
Our struggle has a purpose.

82
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,800
Justice is on our side.

83
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,830
Our objectives are unique.

84
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,680
Our aim has a goal.

85
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,680
We are self-confident.

86
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,280
Death will not deter us.

87
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,620
We will shed our blood
but not our tears.

88
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,320
Ramu was fearless in death.

89
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,190
He died a martyr.

90
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,360
He will live in our history.

91
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,160
Such bravery strengthens
our movement.

92
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,540
What's your name?

93
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,840
Malli.

94
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't cry.

95
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,140
Be strong and brave.

96
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,510
Be proud of your brother.

97
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,630
Sit.

98
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,800
Your name is...

99
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
Malli.

100
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,710
Malli, we are fighting
for the future of our people.

101
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,340
We are sacrificing everything--

102
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,790
our youth, families, education,
our lives.

103
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,490
Malli, so many comrades
have given their lives...

104
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,690
but their ranks continue
to be replenished...

105
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,600
because of committed
young people like you...

106
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,760
who come forward
offering their lives.

107
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,100
With that,
our success is guaranteed.

108
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,030
Come.

109
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,550
Sir...

110
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,050
I have met you before.

111
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,360
At my brother Ramu's funeral.

112
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,620
You told me that my brother
died a martyr...

113
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,690
and to be proud of him.

114
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,600
So, you are Ramu's sister.

115
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,620
Patriotism and valor
are in your blood.

116
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,660
Have you seen this person?

117
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,370
In newspapers.

118
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,810
He is a key
and important person...

119
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,340
and a major obstacle
in our struggle.

120
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,820
Your job is to kill him.

121
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,520
We failed once.

122
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,820
But not this time.

123
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,920
I have faith in you.

124
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,160
The world fears violence
and bloodshed.

125
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,690
That fear, that will generate
respect for us.

126
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,530
This assassination
should shake the world...

127
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,100
make headlines over TV
and the media.

128
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,880
When I look at you...

129
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,810
I know we have
an infallible weapon.

130
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,410
You're supreme...
a thinking bomb.

131
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,380
All gone. Dead.

132
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,380
Books.

133
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,080
You're a girl.

134
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,750
You haven't seen one before?

135
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,860
Never this close.

136
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,730
So close, you're like a flash
of light before my eyes.

137
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,530
A traitor betrayed us.

138
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,970
They killed everyone in Camp 7.

139
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,250
But you came to my rescue.

140
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,990
Your breathing,
it's so comforting.

141
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,130
Malli, we'll leave you
at the edge of the forest.

142
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,690
From there,
Lotus will be your guide.

143
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,930
You will take orders
from Lotus since...

144
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,460
there are mines
hidden in the forest.

145
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,810
You will travel two days
by ferry to your destination.

146
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,680
Perumal will meet you
and give you instructions.

147
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,610
Your hair is very long.

148
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,350
When you were three,
your hair was this long.

149
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,550
And grew again
when you were twelve.

150
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,660
How old is this strand
of hair now?

151
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,700
Nineteen.

152
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,180
Your hair is not
letting go of me. See?

153
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,750
Come, let's go.

154
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,100
We have to reach the boat
in two days.

155
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,340
That is Lotus' responsibility.

156
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,080
You know why I am called Lotus?

157
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:50,510
Because I float, carrying folks
safely to the other side.

158
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,580
That's why the Leader
named me Lotus.

159
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,350
I have led twenty-six people
safely by now to the ferry.

160
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,660
You are the twenty-seventh.

161
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,890
It's OK if you don't talk.

162
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,900
Just listen to Lotus.
Do you swim?

163
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,720
Stay here.

164
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,590
Don't move till I return.

165
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,480
Stop! I told you not to move.

166
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,720
There are "apples" (mines)
hidden under the wire.

167
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,420
Just touch and...

168
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,980
Remove your clothes.

169
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,480
Not here! Behind there.

170
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,030
What's your name again?

171
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,290
Malli.

172
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,370
In the forest...

173
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,280
every tree, bird, and leaf
is known to me.

174
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,120
I also know where and how
the mines are camouflaged.

175
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,050
That's why our Leader
has faith in me.

176
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,330
Malli, the sound of anklets
averts suspicion.

177
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,300
It helped us pass
the last checkpoint.

178
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,960
Come, let's go.

179
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,850
That blast!

180
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,900
There'll be blood and flesh
everywhere.

181
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,100
We'll go another way.

182
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,670
This was my home.

183
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,790
All of them left me.

184
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,820
My father, mother, sister.

185
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,120
They burnt the whole village.

186
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,840
I can't bear to leave.

187
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,300
I feel I belong here.

188
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,610
My father was a priest.

189
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,150
They immolated him.

190
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,670
Don't burn my father!

191
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,510
What happened?

192
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,190
Nothing. Just a nightmare.

193
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,210
Seeing you,
I think of my sister.

194
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,880
She loved me very much.

195
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,890
Malli, I really like you.

196
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,800
You listen to all that I have
to say. You don't talk much.

197
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,030
The real name of Lotus is Surya.

198
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,840
You must call me Surya.

199
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,000
Malli, I shouldn't be
asking you this, but I will.

200
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,020
Will you return?

201
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,210
Yes.

202
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,720
All twenty-six I took across
said they would but did not.

203
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,030
I always feel I am alone.

204
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,600
You killed him.

205
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,780
You're a murderer.

206
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,050
You're like the rest of them.

207
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,950
You, too, will not return.

208
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,080
You won't be back.

209
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,730
Stop it.

210
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,330
Let's go before the army
reaches here.

211
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:12,170
Lotus, don't waste time.
Listen to me. Let's go.

212
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,560
Surya.

213
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,550
I will not come back.

214
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,280
It's important that I go.

215
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,680
Your memory
will always remain with me.

216
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,690
My mission is for the future
of our people.

217
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,200
Thyagu, the wireless message
came through.

218
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,840
Malli is expected at 8:.45.

219
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,680
You wait. I'll fetch her.

220
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,460
Your clothes are in this...

221
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,720
stitched to measurements
received by wireless.

222
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,530
You will stay with a farmer
called Vasudevan.

223
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,330
He loves to talk.

224
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,670
People call him Mad vasu.

225
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,760
The assassination venue
is close by.

226
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,470
You are meant to be my cousin.

227
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,600
You are here
to study agriculture...

228
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,840
on a research project.

229
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,040
OK?

230
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,960
Can't you knock
before you enter?

231
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,130
We did.

232
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,690
Perhaps you did not hear us.

233
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,000
So we came in.

234
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,700
You sing very well.

235
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,940
Man can grow old,
but his mind should not.

236
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,280
I belong
to a family of the arts.

237
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,040
Dance is an art form.
So is singing.

238
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,140
Sir, my cousin. She is the one
who will stay here.

239
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,620
He is the landlord.

240
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,560
I don't rent the house
for money.

241
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,720
A well needs water.

242
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,430
A house needs to be lived in.

243
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,300
My son will return.

244
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,800
He travels all over lndia.

245
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,860
He is a photojournalist...

246
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,070
taking pictures of riots
and the war.

247
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,580
Nothing scares him.

248
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,440
Thank you for giving us
your house in our emergency.

249
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,540
We will abide
by your conditions.

250
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,150
Are you here on
an agricultural study?

251
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,810
Yes.

252
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,120
Have you seen the earthworm
work at the soil?

253
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,820
Will your research
be even more thorough?

254
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,050
What is your name?

255
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,250
Malli (jasmine).

256
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,630
A name with fragrance.

257
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,390
Here is the key.

258
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,200
Go left. It's the first room
on the right.

259
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,470
That's my son's room.
You will like it.

260
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't bother to clean up...

261
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,410
or change things around.

262
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,750
Gopal, can't you hear the cow?
Go milk it.

263
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,510
Even if the cow wants to give,
people are too lazy to accept.

264
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,520
Malli, I'll meet you later.

265
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,340
You're very pretty.

266
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,140
Are these tears or the rain?

267
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,500
Raindrops.

268
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,650
These raindrops look so lovely
on your face.

269
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,150
Are you angry?

270
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,450
No.

271
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,790
You were murmuring something
about books.

272
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,330
I used to love books.

273
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,960
I was thirteen.

274
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,940
I buried my books...

275
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,000
and promised my mother that...

276
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,620
only after we attain
our freedom...

277
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,450
would I retrieve them.

278
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,520
I wanted so much to study.

279
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,120
That is my dream.

280
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,990
What is your dream?

281
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,700
If we get used to seeing reality
as dreams...

282
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,000
then all dreams will be real.

283
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,450
Let me see if all is quiet.

284
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,420
You didn't tell me your name.

285
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,320
I will when I am back.

286
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,460
Listen carefully.

287
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,430
This is our assassination plan.

288
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,410
We are at vasu's house.

289
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,110
He is never at home
between 5::30 to 7::30.

290
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,590
It is a good place
for us to meet and talk.

291
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,610
Today is the 16th.

292
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,220
The assassination is fixed
for the 20th.

293
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:47,630
From vasu's house
to the assassination site...

294
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:54,340
we need to take the ferry.

295
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,740
On the 20th, exactly at 9::05...

296
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,270
the vlP will arrive.

297
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,290
9::05 p.m. sharp!

298
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:11,160
This site has been selected
because of reduced security.

299
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,190
All the way from the road to
his being presented on stage...

300
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,460
there will be many women
waiting to garland him.

301
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,560
You, too, will hold a garland.

302
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,300
Your waist will be strapped
with plastic explosives.

303
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,150
You will garland him.

304
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,280
By 9::20...

305
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,050
the assassination will be over.

306
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,850
At 9::30...

307
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:49,160
all broadcasting stations
will announce the news.

308
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,130
Tomorrow we meet again...

309
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,570
for the first rehearsal.

310
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,900
OK?

311
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,710
This tiny seed
contains a huge tree.

312
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,780
This is the miracle of nature.

313
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,260
Certain processes
are inexplicable.

314
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,420
They must be experienced.

315
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,260
Miss Research! Come here.

316
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,260
Do you know
the tale of two seeds?

317
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,030
One was the optimistic seed.

318
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,510
The other,
the pessimistic one.

319
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:33,240
The optimistic seed
spoke of its dream.

320
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,980
"When I am sown,
I'll grow tall and big.

321
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,880
"My roots will go deep
into the earth...

322
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,860
"in search of water.

323
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,880
"My leaves will dance
with the wind.

324
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,260
"Dewdrops will rain on me.

325
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,060
"l will be content
and will salute the earth."

326
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,000
The pessimistic seed disagreed.

327
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,900
"l don't want my roots to go...

328
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,460
"deep within the dark,
suffocating earth...

329
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,870
"to look for water.

330
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,930
"lf I become a plant, I may be
pulled out by the roots.

331
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,910
"lf I blossom into a flower,
I may adorn someone's hair.

332
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,820
"l refuse to grow
unless my safety is guaranteed."

333
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,550
The optimistic seed grew up
to become a big tree.

334
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,520
The pessimistic seed
bided its time.

335
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,030
An alert hen...

336
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,990
ate the pessimistic seed.

337
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,120
Do you get the story?

338
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,930
Man has to have dreams.

339
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,340
Only then can there be
the desire to make them real.

340
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,100
Plant the seed, my dear.

341
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,720
Has it started growing?

342
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,920
Shut up!

343
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,230
One day it will bloom
into a flower.

344
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,000
When you see a flower,
what do you see?

345
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,410
The earth smiling...

346
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,070
through flowers.

347
00:51:50,810 --> 00:52:00,780
O Lord of Seven Mountains,
arise and save us all.

348
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:20,100
O Lord with broad shoulders,
wake up and save the world.

349
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:29,910
O Lord, arise to save
the three worlds.

350
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,460
Miss Research,
is the food tasty?

351
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,610
Do you know how to sing?

352
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,310
I can't.

353
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,320
Can you cook?

354
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,450
Do you talk at least?

355
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,520
Anyway, you can talk very well.

356
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,230
If one talks,
it's called speech.

357
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,460
Only with two
can there be a conversation.

358
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,380
Are you wondering...

359
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,810
why there are four leaves
for just three persons?

360
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,080
Are you expecting guests?

361
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,610
No. It's for my wife.

362
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,210
Is she...?

363
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,780
She used to sit here
to eat with us.

364
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,990
Is she no more?

365
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,830
You really talk too much.

366
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,020
Finish your food.

367
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,070
No, not that way.

368
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,950
It signifies the end
of a relation.

369
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,180
To bond a relationship,
you fold it this way.

370
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,350
The way you
research agriculture...

371
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,450
Iearn about our culture as well.

372
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,920
That's correct.

373
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,830
With plastic explosives,
your belt will be heavier.

374
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,260
It's only a rehearsal.

375
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,870
Thyagu, you are the vlP.
Take your position.

376
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,340
Take the garland.

377
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,770
No, not now!

378
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,580
Many women are waiting in line
to garland him.

379
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:45,980
You are one of them.

380
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,210
Relax.

381
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,710
The vlP has got out of the car.

382
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,160
He is approaching. His arrival
is being announced.

383
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,720
Bands begin to blare their music
in the background.

384
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,350
Keep your eye on the vlP.

385
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,660
Be calm.

386
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,670
You are smart,
just as the Leader said.

387
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,150
But remember two things.

388
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,480
You must smile.
Yes, like that.

389
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,360
And in the last few seconds,
blank out all thoughts.

390
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,260
Focus your entire concentration
and aim on...

391
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,420
pressing the trigger-button.

392
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,630
Malli, have you met her by now?

393
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,930
My wife Padmavathy.

394
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,460
Remember the fourth leaf
while we were eating?

395
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,000
It was for her.

396
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,180
For seven years,
she has not stirred.

397
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,750
When my son did not return,
she held my hand, like this.

398
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:52,490
To console me. I did not cry,
but she went into a coma.

399
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,830
And another nostalgic incident
in my life.

400
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,040
During our marriage ceremony...

401
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,740
she surreptitiously
held my hand, like this.

402
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,580
I felt so ecstatic.

403
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,350
So many doctors!
Medicine upon medicine.

404
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:17,980
But nothing worked.

405
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,720
I am confident...

406
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,090
one day she will be up
and sit with us over a meal.

407
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,030
This is Malli.

408
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,660
She's researching
her agricultural project.

409
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,640
She is staying
in the next room.

410
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,970
Malli, we never know
if God listens. Still, we pray.

411
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:44,210
Nor do we know
if she can understand.

412
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,840
But we keep talking to her.

413
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:59,720
Stop eyeing the working women!

414
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:07,930
Back to work, all of you.

415
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,350
Malli, five to ten times
is not enough.

416
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,620
You must do a count of hundred.

417
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,180
You should keep your body fit...

418
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,220
and your mind under control.

419
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,000
That's how I am.
My father taught me to be so.

420
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,230
And I passed that dictum
to my son.

421
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:42,860
Gopal, go do your work.

422
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,710
Malli, what of your mother
and father?

423
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,970
They're dead.

424
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,920
Gopal, get some water.

425
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:22,000
Malli, are you hurt?
I told you not to strain.

426
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,800
You should
do your exercises slowly.

427
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,540
Drink this.

428
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,080
It's nothing. I'm all right.

429
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,210
Is Thyagu your cousin?

430
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,380
Yes.

431
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:29,160
Your parents are no more.
Any other relatives?

432
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,630
No.

433
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,440
Gopal, do you know
who a true orphan is?

434
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,870
Not the one without relatives...

435
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:46,040
but the one who is alone
despite having them.

436
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,220
That is why I asked.

437
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,980
Take some more curry.

438
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,320
No, enough.

439
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,740
There is a thief out there.

440
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:50,580
Hide in darkness, and one day
the dark will reveal you.

441
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,140
People should trust each other.

442
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,880
But we don't.

443
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,820
Do you trust me?

444
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,120
Do I trust you?

445
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,120
But I know why you are here...

446
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,790
and what you intend to do.

447
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:07,020
Stop, don't run!
Catch the thief!

448
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,480
Did he say that?

449
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,810
That he knows everything?

450
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,050
This is a foolproof plan.

451
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,650
If he knows, then others
may also come to know.

452
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,750
Shall we get rid of him?

453
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,690
That's a risk.

454
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:41,250
Malli,
try with utmost care to...

455
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,960
to see if he really knows
or is trying to get information.

456
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,890
Did you catch the thief?

457
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:26,230
You don't know what happened?

458
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,300
That was no thief,
it was Gopal.

459
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,710
We struggled with each other.

460
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,210
It was some drama.

461
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,480
You said that you knew
something about me?

462
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,780
What is it?

463
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,590
What could be the most
lonely thing on earth?

464
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,270
A seed.
Unless it is sown...

465
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,600
it belongs neither to the earth,
nor to the sky.

466
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,330
It has to wait for the wind.

467
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,600
It has to fall on earth.

468
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,900
And for the rain.

469
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,910
So that it can grow
in the earth's darkness...

470
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:03,910
Iike the embryo
in a mother's womb.

471
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:07,210
Earth is a mother,
just like you.

472
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,850
That day, do you know
why you vomited suddenly?

473
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,250
A sign of motherhood.

474
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,050
You are expecting.

475
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:22,030
A man has to be a father,
a woman has to be a mother...

476
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,660
to fulfill their lives.

477
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,220
Don't hide anything.

478
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,570
Motherhood is to be revered.

479
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,000
Be proud of it.

480
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:21,940
Malli, what are you doing
in the rain?

481
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,640
You will fall ill.

482
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,050
It's only an empty nest.

483
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,180
Its purpose for nurturing
the young ones...

484
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,340
has been served.

485
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:30,880
Now its usefulness is over.

486
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,410
The birds have flown.

487
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,520
Don't research this.
Come inside.

488
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:42,400
There's life in you.
That is important.

489
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,330
The rain isn't good for you.

490
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,800
You are to be a mother!

491
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,200
My blessings.

492
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,720
What did the old man know?
What did he say?

493
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,730
He was curious about us.

494
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,820
About our relationship.

495
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,030
I convinced him.

496
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:13,700
That's his habit.
Old people are nosy.

497
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,740
I spoke to our Leader
through the wireless.

498
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,610
He told me that you
were Ramu's sister.

499
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:24,620
I am proud to hear that.

500
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,020
We grew up
hero-worshipping him.

501
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,420
Ramu was the first
to consume cyanide...

502
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,620
and die for our movement.

503
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,290
Today is the final rehearsal.

504
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,320
The Leader has sent
his blessing.

505
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,700
Tomorrow marks the day
of the assassination.

506
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:45,970
It's time for me to leave.
I'll meet you at 5::30.

507
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,260
What happened?

508
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,260
I heard the cry of a newborn.

509
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,330
Padmavathy,
Malli heard a newborn cry.

510
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,840
It's a good sign.

511
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,400
She is going to be a mother.

512
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,670
The house will be alive again.

513
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,040
Why do you look depressed?

514
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,240
He is dead.

515
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,440
Who?

516
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,020
The father of the child.

517
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,890
Don't worry. I will shoulder
your problems, my dear.

518
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:16,490
I will be the grandpa
of the newborn.

519
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:20,430
I feel it is all for the good.

520
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:48,660
Malli, here is the dress.
Check the fitting.

521
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,600
Go change.
Hurry.

522
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,600
Is it heavy?

523
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:27,630
Lift your hands.
No problem?

524
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,130
Turn to the right.

525
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,660
Check how easily you can
reach the button.

526
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,670
Thyagu, take your position.

527
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,870
Garland him.

528
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:54,280
Quick. The vlP is not there
with you for long.

529
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:03,590
Garland him with a smile.
Avoid raising suspicion.

530
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:12,900
Fall at his feet
to seek his blessing.

531
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,510
Press the switch.

532
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:19,740
Quick.

533
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:10,090
Malli, why hesitate?
Don't think.

534
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,120
Do what you are here for.

535
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,900
The last time,
we failed in our efforts.

536
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,910
This time, we cannot.

537
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,170
All our comrades
are waiting eagerly.

538
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,800
Don't disappoint them.
Don't let down their trust.

539
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:27,110
Don't turn back
on our people's future.

540
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:30,050
Don't betray the martyred dreams
of your brother.

541
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:33,080
Lastly, don't betray yourself.

542
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,520
Your great sacrifice...

543
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,490
your valiant death...

544
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,860
will stir the hearts
of our people.

545
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:42,760
Our future generations
will pay homage to you.

546
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,790
Your death will herald
a new era for our people.

547
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,670
Think only about that.

548
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:55,840
I will do it...
to the finish.

549
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,090
Malli, I offered prayers
for you...

550
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:47,720
and for a safe delivery.

551
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,890
That is this granddad's wish.

552
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:14,950
Malli.

553
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,990
The vlP's schedule
is in the newspaper.

554
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,790
Everything is going as planned.

555
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:22,320
Thyagu will be ready
with the bomb.

556
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,300
We will return in two hours.

557
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,730
Malli.

558
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:29,900
A last wish?
Anything you would like?

559
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:32,730
No.

560
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,840
To eat something?

561
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,940
No. I will eat with the old man.

562
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,180
I'll return.

563
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:23,920
Today, I won't eat.
I fast on this day.

564
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,970
I kept telling you that my son
will return someday.

565
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,800
That's not true.

566
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,400
He died seven years ago.

567
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:44,570
But he still lives
in our hearts.

568
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,080
When people die,
what remains?

569
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,950
Only memories...
good memories.

570
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:53,280
You've been with us just 4 days,
but you've won over our hearts.

571
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,450
I...

572
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,290
Don't talk.
Eat well.

573
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,780
Stay here.
I have plans for you, too.

574
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,230
Do as I say.

575
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,130
Now, drink this milk.

576
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:08,130
I must now administer
her medicines.

577
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:19,000
9::05, the vlP arrives.

578
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,410
9::20 is the time
for the assassination.

579
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,740
It is all in your hands.

580
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:28,210
Tonight is the beginning
of a new era.

581
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,980
That message comes from
our Leader with his good wishes.

582
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,020
Now the time is 7::45.

583
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,920
8:.15, the boat will be ready.

584
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,950
We must reach
the assassination site by 8::30.

585
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,700
At 9::30, the news will spread
to every corner of the world.

586
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:51,470
Your sacrifice will inspire
future generations.

587
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:55,270
I'll be back in a moment.

588
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,060
I'm going.

589
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:26,670
Am I doing the right thing?

590
01:28:34,450 --> 01:28:36,710
I am like you.

591
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,690
You have lost your son.

592
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,720
I am about to.

593
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,200
I must sacrifice my future
for that of the people.

594
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,350
Malli.

595
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,330
I am going.
