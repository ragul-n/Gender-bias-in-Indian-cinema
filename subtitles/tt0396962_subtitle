80
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,998
He has trouble seeing things at far.

81
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,128
Since when?

82
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,002

85
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:26,413
He hurt his knee. Has
to miss the school now.

86
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,687
He gets irritated.

00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,688
Then comes to fields with
me or goes with cattle.

88
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,691
Are you two related?

89
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,696

00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:45,201
He stays home after the
accident last year.

00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:51,234
He can't move around like
he used to. But we manage

94
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,711
School is up ahead of the temple.

Hmm.. Be good son!

251

Who is the patient?

260
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,662
My grandson.

261
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,663
Over there.
- Doctor will tell you everything.

262
00:24:58,277 --> 00:24:59,676
Parashu, don't be so fidgety.

263

Don't go anywhere! Shh..

264
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,687
Shut up.
- Don't cry Parashu. Good boy!

265
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,859
Vichare, You just want to
give the reports, right?

266
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:21,091
Yes.
- Go in right after this patient.

267
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,693
Wait.

268
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:27,700

Let them go first.

270
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:38,107
Give the reports and
come out quickly.

271
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:48,216
Hey, Where is the patient?
She does not look like one.

272
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,389
l wanted to show the reports.
- Oh! Ok. Let me see.

273
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,062
You were supposed to come tomorrow.

275
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,739

276
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,744
Vichare, it's better

277
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,915
l need to check the reports
thoroughly once again.

278
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,753
Also l need to talk
to the eye specialist

279
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,753
So today you won't tell me anything?

280
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,089
No. Come tomorrow. Don't worry.

281

Do not worry.

286
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,776
Take a good night's sleep.

287
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:48,786
Now. Tell me!

288
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,787

289
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,796
What is an Onco Surgeon?

291
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:24,015
What is the phone no. here?
- Here it is.

292
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,826
Vichare, you left your umbrella.

293
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:31,079
Oh dear, did you get hurt?

294
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,358

Yes? lts spleen tomorrow
and APR on Thursday.

296
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:20,332
Did Joshi get it all installed?

297
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,463
Hello Grandpa!

298
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,938
Remember me?

299
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:30,106
Parashuram is sitting outside.
- Hope he's still sitting there!

300
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:34,685
How do you know him?
- We met at the CT scan yesterday.

301
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,615
Asawari... wait!

302
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:47,123
How many patients are there? Don't
send anybody for next 10 minutes.

303
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:58,504
Yes? Tomorrow 7 pm. Yes.

304
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:06,976
Sorry! Will you have some tea?

305
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,377
No. lt's ok!

306
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:14,983
Please. Even l will have. Send
some. Where is Parashuram?

307
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,651
ln the lobby.
- Alone?

308
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:20,996
No. My daughter in law's
brother is with him.

309
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:30,001
There is nothing to be afraid of.
Well, worrying won't help us.

310
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,171
We need to Keep our cool.
Think rationally.

311
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,172
The situation is a little more
serious than you thought.

312
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,177
Just a surgery, right?

313
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,013
Yes...

314
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:46,014
So, he'll be able to see, right?

315
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,022
l'll explain the whole thing now.

316
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:52,361
Go ahead with the surgery.
Don't worry about money.

317
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,422
l will sell some trees,
manage something.

318
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,024
lt is not about the money.

319
00:30:57,202 --> 00:31:00,103
Don't worry! That is
not the issue here.

320
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,202
Have some tea.
- lts ok!

321
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,208
We have to operate on both the eyes.

322
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,054
And he will be able to see?

323
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,058
No.

324
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:28,397
See Parashuram is important
to us, correct?

325
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:32,527
What do you mean?
- l'll explain.

326
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,231
See these are our eyes.

327
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:41,569
These are the pupils and
behind is the retina.

328
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:45,805
See the veins at this joint.
This is where we see from.

329
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:52,152
This is where he has cancer.
lt is called retino-blastoma.

330
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,425
Look here....! Please listen to me!

331
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:13,277
Both the eyes are affected. We
have to remove both of them.

332
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:25,285
And that must be done immediately.
Once the cancer starts spreading..

333
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:29,293
we wont be able to do anything.
So make the decision fast.

334
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,292
Want some tea?
- Can we replace his eyes?

335
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,134
No.

336
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,132
At least one!

337
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:48,145
lt is not possible in this case.

338
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,145
We have to operate without delay.

339
00:32:55,687 --> 00:33:00,750
ls there any other alternative?
- l have checked thoroughly.

340
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,692
Luckily the cancer
is at first stage.

341
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:12,326
He won't lose even a day in
his life after the surgery.

342
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,340
This is one in million case.

343
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:29,585
Parasha is also one in a million!

344
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,188
You have to make the final decision.

345
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,193
What is left to decide now?

346
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,200
Talk to your family.

347
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,369
Operate on him! Right now!

348
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:51,374
No, don't rush. First talk to
your family and let me know?

349
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,746
Please calm down.

350
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,375
Wait! Wait for a minute!

351
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,753
One important thing you must know.

352
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,890
The patient should know about
it before removing any organs.

353
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,904
Do not put this burden on me now!

354
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,407
Try to tell him!

355
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,638
You tell him.

356
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,648
No. You have to do this.

357
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:39,587
The child is in your hands now!

358
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,252
Don't worry!

359
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:54,800
You may go now. Let me know
your decision soon.

360
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:06,280
Send the next patient in.

361
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,289
Come Grandpa!

362
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,942
Yes! Tell me!

363
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,352
Had all the tests done today!

364
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:20,347
What did the doctor say?

365
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,358
Doctor saw the reports!

366
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,358
What did he say?

367
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,364
Said, No reason to worry about!

368
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,366
What about the treatment?

369
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:37,373
A little surgery is needed.
An hour long!

370
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,374
Do they have to?

371
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:46,875
Don't worry and tell Suhaas
also! He must be worried.

372
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,386
He is at the fields.

373
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:53,048
ls Parasha there?
- Yes, he is!

374
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,389
Hold on!

375
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:03,056
Say hello to your mother.
- Hello!

376
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,395
How are you my baby?

377
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:09,796
Mother, did Kusum have a calf?

378
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:15,474
Yes. ln the morning.
lts white and black

379
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,405
You get well and come back soon.

380
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:21,885
My little baby!

381
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:24,421
Does it have a star on its forehead?

382
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:31,161
Yes yes! You love them, don't you?
Come back soon, my baby!

383
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,965
We decided to name it
Chandani. Remember?

384
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:40,597
Yes my dear! You take care.

385
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,434
Where is father?

386
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:44,770
At the fields!

387
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:46,434
Don't talk for too long on phone.

388
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,443
Ok. l am going to hang
up now. Take care!

389
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,451
Try to avoid the operation.

390
00:37:58,623 --> 00:37:59,715
Ok!

391
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,452
Ask some other doctor!

392
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,191
This doctor must be no good.

393
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,464
My poor little child!

394
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,863
Ok. Bye now!
- Take care of my baby!

395
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:12,468
ls he eating properly?

396
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,468
Yes!

397
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,473
Do his eyes become watery?

398
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,940
l am hanging up.

399
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:20,544
Do you give him milk at night?

400
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:21,871
Bye!

401
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,479
Taatyaa?

402
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:12,700
What's the matter?

403
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:19,216
We have to save him come what may.
Let's consult another doctor.

404
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,311
Remember Yashawant Vichare?
Do you have his phone number?

405
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,719
Yes.
- l will see him tomorrow.

406
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,724
We can't lose him.

407
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,258
Excuse me please.

408
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:20,302
Where were you? l was
looking for you..

409
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:26,506
Where is Parashuraam?
- He is with Divakar.

410
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:32,789
How stressed you look!

411
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,783
Why are you avoiding me?

412
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,133
The child has to survive.

413
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:47,965
How are we going to save him, if
you don't show up for 4-5 days?

414
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,542
Did you talk to your family?
- Just a bit.

415
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:59,082
Did you tell Parashuram?
- Not yet. And how can l?

416
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:05,016
The surgery is a must.
We have to decide fast.

417
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:13,562
Should we find another doctor?
- Why?

418
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,996
Removing both the eyes..!!? -
That's why you were hiding from me?

419
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,002
We want Parashuraam.

420
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:36,179
Another doctor said we could try?
- Try what?

421
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:43,851
To save at least one eye.
- l have talked to Dr Sane.

422
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:48,465
Checked all the reports. lt is the
only way to save Parashuram.

423
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,858
How can that be a way?

424
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,131
There is no other alternative.

425
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,863
Who says so?

426
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:02,540
Dr Sane has that much authority.

427
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,875
How can l believe that?

428
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:13,148
l also am attached to Parashuram

429
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:15,158
Just like you are.

430
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:21,559
l have been trying to find you. You
weren't at the hotel at night.

431
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:25,402
ln the morning, you
had left already.

432
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:30,067
How can l tell this to his mother?

433
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:35,378
Even she would want Parashuram
to survive no matter what.

434
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,177
Can't there be another way?

435
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:43,914
No.

436
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:50,384
But then.. afterwards..
how will he...

437
00:45:55,266 --> 00:46:00,397
He can have a great life
even without eyes.

438
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:05,097
We have to work on that.

439
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:08,939
That means..!

440
00:46:12,416 --> 00:46:15,943
Think about it calmly.

441
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:26,128
Close your eyes. Walk for 2 minutes.
- l will after 2 days of practice.

442
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:34,496
What about the whole life?
- You are only creating questions.

443
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,508
Parasha.. Parashuraam..

444
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,979
This is going on since yesterday.

445
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:52,989
Doesn't answer if someone
calls or asks anything.

446
00:46:57,328 --> 00:46:59,159
Yes dear.. What's up?

447
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:12,341
Did you see the kids playing here?
Should we play with them?

448
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,172
Let's join them come on!

449
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,011
Kids stare at his eyes.

450
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,625
l have brought something that
Parashuraam would like.

451
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:38,026
Do you know what it is?

452
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,774
Don't touch your eyes with dirty
hands. Don't you have a kerchief?

453
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:55,208
He has it in his pocket.
- Where? l want to see it.

454
00:47:57,121 --> 00:48:04,789
Parasha, be a good boy. Don't
run. You will get hurt.

455
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:09,465
Parasha, don't you want to get well?

456
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,396
He doesn't listen to anyone.

457
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,337
He is going to do
this more and more.

458
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,089
You need face this with a smile.

459
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:36,253
That will keep him cheerful.

460
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:41,088
Remember what Dr. Sane said,

461
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,426
saving Parasha is most important.

462
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:52,275
l know all that, but
How can l tell him?

463
00:48:56,513 --> 00:49:01,280
Oh Lord Shankara, please
help me. Show me a way.

464
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:08,284
Do something please!

465
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:22,262
How is that patient from Satara?
- Stable sir!

466
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:25,738
Monitor him. See you at 5.
- Ok sir!

467
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,470
Just a minute sir!
- Yes?

468
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:32,640
Your patient Parashuram Vichare.
- The one with Retino-Blastoma?

469
00:49:32,716 --> 00:49:36,208
Yes. His grandfather Keshav
Vichare needs to talk to you.

470
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,888
Send him to my clinic tomorrow.
- lt's closed tomorrow and day after

471
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:42,819
Oh! Send him on Monday.
- No. lt is urgent. We have no time.

472
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:48,688
Yes? l will reach in 15 minutes.
l have to go for a surgery.

473
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:51,326
Sir, he is not convinced
about the surgery...

474
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:55,566
He is not ready for it.
- That happens with every patient.

475
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,166
Yes sir but saving the eyes..
- l am getting late, got to go.

476
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,174
Sir, please listen to me sir.

477
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,644
There could be complications.
- How?

478
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:09,584
They are going for second opinion,
which may affect their decision.

479
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:13,186
lt happens. Eventually
they all come to me.

480
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:17,191
The risk is bigger by then and they
beg me to save the patient.

481
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,359
l agree sir! but....

482
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:30,596
Why do they go for second opinion?
Because they can't trust the doctor.

483
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:31,732
Please.. l have a surgery.

484
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,606
l have to go. Please Understand.
- Sir, please sir!

485
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,220
What's the matter, Grandpa?

486
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,404
Look.. There is no
option for surgery

487
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,404
that too both the eyes.

488
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:11,838
l will not charge a single penny.
But there is no other way.

489
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:17,414
Don't listen to anybody else.

490
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:21,850
We have to act now.
You have to be firm.

491
00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:27,254
Can l leave now?

492
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,659
Parashuram will not lose a
single day from his life.

493
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:38,869
Don't think too much.
Make the decision soon.

494
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:42,941
The longer you wait,
the risk is more.

495
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:47,779
lf you come after 6 months or so
l won't be able to do anything.

496
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:55,288
When can we do the operation?

497
00:51:56,693 --> 00:52:00,288
Soon. Come to the clinic. l
will get the papers ready.

498
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,798
He cannot tell this to Parashuraam.

499
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,837
But you will have to..,
before the operation.

500
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,709
Please, l need your help sir!

501
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:27,983
Why involve me again? You are
well trained. You do it.

502
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:32,859
l tried, but it's not that easy.
- Try again.

503
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:35,398
Grandpa, you try to tell him.

504
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,500
That's sir's car!!

505
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:03,749
You told me to come here.
- Ok. Tell me.

506
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:09,357
l have brought Parashuram with me.
- Why?

507
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:12,360
You tell him sir!
- Tell him what?

508
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,034
About the surgery.
- But..

509
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:20,643
Sir, please talk to him...
What do l do now?

510
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:23,544
We are short of time.
- l need to go for a surgery.

511
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:26,775
Grandpa. come here fast.
He is in a hurry.

512
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:35,715
Shouldn't you create this support?
- Their decision is final sir.

513
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:39,588
When do they want to schedule it?
- Please talk to him sir.

514
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:47,397
When can you admit the patient
into the hospital?

515
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,396
Whenever you say.

516
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:51,404
You decide and let me know.

517
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:54,410
Tomorrow!

518
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:56,402
Does the boy know?

519
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:00,410
What difference does it make?

520
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:02,414
No, You have to tell him.

521
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:07,420
l will see what happens.

522
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:12,152
Asawari, shouldn't you
be trying to help them?

523
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:17,596
l tried sir, but l need

Grandpa, you are very well aware of
his nature, his likes and dislikes

525
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:36,613
You know him from birth.
- That is why it is hard for me.

526
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,047
Parashuram, come here!

527
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:42,455

Thank you sir! l can't
do this alone.

00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:09,878
You are more used to dealing
with patients.

545
00:56:11,882 --> 00:56:18,014
Ok Parashuram, let him go.
- Be a good boy!

Please send a cup of tea for Grandpa,

549
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:48,916
Milind, why are you bringing patients

550
00:56:49,086 --> 00:56:54,581
lt's a sensitive case. l will

551
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:57,591
Yeah, right! You never have
time for home and family.

552
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:07,093
Why are you so quiet today?

553
00:57:08,872 --> 00:57:11,602
You are always mischievous
and talkative!

554
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:24,879
Somebody wants biscuits!
ok have them.

555
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:31,619

Nice & sweet. Don't you want some?

- Tell us about your home.

560
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:53,812
Slanting roofs, backyards, cows?
Here we have only tall buildings.

561
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,985
Nothing else. The city isn't
as nice as your village.

562
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:58,644
Where is Grandpa?

563
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,247

Milind..

You were supposed to drop her.
- Can you do it today? please?

582
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:24,237
Why do you promise her then?
- Please. You please drop her.

583
00:59:28,995 --> 00:59:34,456
Wow, hills! Where is the river?

Cashew? Mango? Coconut tree?

You don't know anything. Can

Yes. Two ones are two, two twos

590
01:00:08,034 --> 01:00:10,559
Six! You don't know anything..

01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:15,503
lsn't she dumb! She doesn't know
anything. Ok lets do this.

592

Oh, Blind man's Bluff..

Why do you think so?

608
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:54,599
Why do you keep making
me close my eyes?

609
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,934
Why do you say that its
ok even if l can't see?

610
01:01:58,077 --> 01:02:01,774
Why does Grandpa hug
me and kiss me often?

611
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:04,143
He is probably worried about you.

612
01:02:05,018 --> 01:02:07,009

613
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:11,019

Other hospitals?

722
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:39,681

723
01:26:39,825 --> 01:26:41,952

What did other patients say?
- None of them know anything.

732
01:27:29,942 --> 01:27:34,345
Sir, CMO Sarode had called
from ABC hospital.

733
01:27:34,513 --> 01:27:39,507
There is a suicide case.
We have to go and check.

734
01:27:40,753 --> 01:27:43,881
For identification..?
- Sarala Ma'am can identify them.

735
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:50,686
Ok send her. No, not Divakar.

736
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:55,366
Please don't cry.

737
01:27:55,534 --> 01:27:57,365
Quiet him down.

738
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:01,369
Ok let's check into the ward.

739
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,892
Are all the things in place? Have
they taken anything with them?

740
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:25,559
Umbrella and the bag.

741
01:28:25,898 --> 01:28:28,924
Let me see the file.. What
time was the round?

742
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:30,730
10 am. All was ok then.

743
01:28:42,581 --> 01:28:44,412
ldentify the body immediately

744
01:28:55,594 --> 01:28:59,587
Dr Sane? This is the fifth run away
case in the last six months!

745
01:29:05,838 --> 01:29:08,500
Cannot say anything as of yet.
They must be around somewhere.

746
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:14,635
5 run-aways in 6 months?
- Ask the hospital management.

747
01:29:24,623 --> 01:29:26,523
Let me do my job. Let me go.

748
01:29:28,627 --> 01:29:31,460
What colour is the frame?

749
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:37,800
Who let the reporters in?
How did they get in here?

750
01:29:39,872 --> 01:29:42,636
They will print anything they like
and complicate the situation.

751
01:29:46,812 --> 01:29:48,473
Was there anyone with the body?

752
01:29:51,817 --> 01:29:56,686
Ask about the face.
- Yes. any details about the face?

753
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:00,491
Call the hospital registrar.
- Yes sir!

754
01:30:02,661 --> 01:30:04,959
Sir, the face..

755
01:30:05,664 --> 01:30:07,495
..is damaged.

756
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:15,838
ls absconding patient a routine?
- What do you mean?

757
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,009
What is your opinion about
improving the hospital?

758
01:30:18,911 --> 01:30:20,503
ls anything spooky here?

759
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,781
ln ABC Hospital today..

760
01:30:33,926 --> 01:30:39,523
l told you to not to push too much
Hello? No. Postpone the surgery.

761
01:30:46,805 --> 01:30:48,534
l have many other patients also.

762
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:52,802
Hello sir! You called for me.

763
01:30:54,613 --> 01:30:56,547
Have a seat.

764
01:30:56,615 --> 01:30:58,549
lts ok!

765
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:01,546
What's the procedure when
a patient is missing?

766
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:06,289
Make an 'abscond note' in register.

767
01:31:06,725 --> 01:31:08,556
That has been done.

768
01:31:08,627 --> 01:31:10,561
Then it is fine..

769
01:31:10,896 --> 01:31:12,557
What about searching the patient?

770
01:31:13,098 --> 01:31:15,896
Sorry sir! but that is not my job.

771
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:18,569
What do you mean?

772
01:31:18,737 --> 01:31:20,762
Mr Povale looks after that.

773
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:23,901
Call him.

774
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:25,566
He is on leave today.

775
01:31:28,046 --> 01:31:29,570
So? Now what?

776
01:31:32,985 --> 01:31:34,976
l also go home at five.

777
01:31:36,088 --> 01:31:38,249
Mr Joshi told me to wait so l did.

778
01:31:38,924 --> 01:31:39,982
Now?

779
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:42,923
We can make the note next week.

780
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:44,595
The incidence has happened today.

781
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:46,594
We can put today's date.

782
01:31:46,932 --> 01:31:48,991
Look. This is my patient.

783
01:31:49,067 --> 01:31:50,591
Yes sir!

784
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:57,999
Yes. Sarode. What's the news?

785
01:31:58,076 --> 01:31:59,600
One minute sir!

786
01:32:00,612 --> 01:32:01,772
Sarode is on other side.

787
01:32:01,847 --> 01:32:03,610
He says the body is very
similar to grandfather's.

788
01:32:03,682 --> 01:32:05,616
No problem then!

789
01:32:07,786 --> 01:32:12,814
Parashuram Vichare is my patient
not his grandfather. Where is he?

790
01:32:15,794 --> 01:32:17,785
Sir, You have an appointment at 6.

791
01:32:22,801 --> 01:32:24,632
The kid is not there sir!

792
01:32:32,144 --> 01:32:33,634
Be in touch!

793
01:32:34,813 --> 01:32:36,644
Mr Sarode, l will call you again.

794
01:32:38,817 --> 01:32:42,184
Divakar, l will be back shortly.

795
01:32:46,925 --> 01:32:50,918
This is too much. l had to move
the surgeries to tomorrow.

796
01:33:04,343 --> 01:33:07,005
Keep informing me. However late.
- l will sir!

797
01:33:57,896 --> 01:34:01,388
No matter how much we help you,
you will always be irresponsible!

798
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:05,998
People have been searching
for you like crazy.

799
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:09,733
The surgery is tomorrow
and you just left!!?

800
01:34:11,143 --> 01:34:12,735
Don't you understand?
Even at this age?

801
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:21,246
What are we supposed to
think? What happened?

802
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:26,756
lt just doesn't matter how
much people do for you!!

803
01:34:27,025 --> 01:34:32,088
What more can l do for you? l
don't have that much of time.

804
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:39,763
l postponed surgeries for this. The
police and press got involved.

805
01:34:40,772 --> 01:34:43,969
Now where are the reporters?
They should see this.

806
01:34:44,943 --> 01:34:46,774
Why blame doctors!!!

807
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,043
lf you didn't want the surgery,
you should have said so...

808
01:34:56,955 --> 01:34:59,947
Please forgive me! l made a mistake.

809
01:35:09,401 --> 01:35:12,336
You sent a message that the
operation is postponed!

810
01:35:12,971 --> 01:35:15,201
We couldn't see you.
- So?

811
01:35:17,075 --> 01:35:18,872
No operation.. so..

812
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:23,311
So you ran away? Schedules
get postponed sometimes.

813
01:35:26,418 --> 01:35:28,409
We were prepared for the surgery.

814
01:35:31,223 --> 01:35:33,157
The child wouldn't listen.

815
01:35:33,992 --> 01:35:37,985
Wouldn't stop crying.
Got all cranky.

816
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,823
l couldn't take it.

817
01:35:41,233 --> 01:35:43,360
What are nurses for?

818
01:35:43,835 --> 01:35:46,360
An injection and he would
have slept peacefully.

819
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,841
Anyway, l am not interested in it.
lf you don't want the surgery..

820
01:35:53,912 --> 01:35:57,177
Tell Asawari. She will complete the
formalities and you can leave.

821
01:35:59,451 --> 01:36:02,443
Parasha had 24 hours left
before going into darkness.

822
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:09,917
What was he supposed
to take with him?

823
01:36:13,031 --> 01:36:14,862
This nasty hospital smell?

824
01:36:17,269 --> 01:36:24,539
Patient's cries? Needles?
Those l.V. tubes?

825
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:30,880
Wait!

826
01:36:37,622 --> 01:36:39,886
After 24 hours would this
child be able to see..

827
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,892
A bird flying in the sky?

828
01:36:44,296 --> 01:36:46,890
A horse carriage on the streets?

829
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:57,909
l thought and decided, 'Let's see
what happens!' and took him out.

830
01:40:31,623 --> 01:40:34,285
What will he be able
to see afterwards?

831
01:40:37,595 --> 01:40:40,792
l tried to show him..

832
01:40:42,667 --> 01:40:46,467
everything that he has
not seen before.

833
01:40:50,542 --> 01:40:52,134
Oh, he was so happy.

834
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:04,546
Saw a temple. Sat on the steps.

835
01:41:06,558 --> 01:41:08,150
Left everything to God.

836
01:41:12,564 --> 01:41:16,830
Decided not to shed
a tear and came back.

837
01:41:19,337 --> 01:41:27,244
For a villager like me,
l did what l felt right..

838
01:41:29,581 --> 01:41:32,846
Right or wrong, l don't know.

839
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,455
Sorry, l caused you a lot of trouble

840
01:41:41,593 --> 01:41:46,792
l wanted to show him the full
moonlight falling over the fields.

841
01:41:51,369 --> 01:41:53,200
ls there any need?

842
01:41:57,408 --> 01:41:59,467
You have given him so
much this evening.

843
01:42:04,482 --> 01:42:06,211
The operation will be tomorrow.

844
01:42:09,621 --> 01:42:12,715
Parasha, we will meet at 7 am.

845
01:42:18,396 --> 01:42:20,227
l am sorry!

846
01:42:40,585 --> 01:42:42,246
Let's do the surgery tonight.

847
01:42:43,655 --> 01:42:45,418
The happy picture of life
that you have shown him,

848
01:42:46,424 --> 01:42:48,415
let him take that into the dark.

849
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:09,610
Shift Parasha to special ward.
Decorate his room

850
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:12,445
with flowers and toys and
as many colours as you can.

851
01:43:16,454 --> 01:43:21,892
Request anesthetist Patankar.
Operation will take place tonight.

852
01:44:08,873 --> 01:44:11,842
Parashuraam's case..
l will handle it

853
01:44:12,844 --> 01:44:15,506
Well then, l don't need to operate.

854
01:44:17,749 --> 01:44:21,685
You social workers only think from
the heart. What about the head?
