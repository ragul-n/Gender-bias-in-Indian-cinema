1
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,240
One. Two. Three.

2
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,400
Welcome to your
Bachelor's Party.

3
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,360
Where's the party?

4
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
It's your last night as a bachelor.

5
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Sit. Have a drink,
listen to some good music. Relax.

6
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,600
Don't sound so depressing.
Tonight is all I have.

7
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,240
I've promised them so much more.

8
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
Think like a guy who's my age,
not yours.

9
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,400
You didn't take me to Vegas,
that's okay.

10
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,800
But the least you could have done
was arrange some strippers.

11
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
How old are you?

12
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,840
32.

13
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
It's been 35 years
since I turned young.

14
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
I've never had to pay for chance
encounters and romantic evenings.

15
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,160
I never pay for sex.

16
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,480
A night that's earned has something
special about its morning.

17
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,400
That's a nice pickup line.

18
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
But seriously,
where are the strippers?

19
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
What's your wife going to say?

20
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
She is not my wife yet.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,920
And she knows.
It's my Bachelor's Party.

22
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
You're so naive.

23
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
Almost dumb..

24
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
He's so naive.

25
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,760
I knew it.

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,160
I knew it, bro.

27
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,120
Who's the groom?

28
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,640
I should have known!

29
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,400
And I knew it and I was right.
Look at what you are doing!

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Aren't you disgusted with yourself?

31
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Like, really.
How are you standing here?

32
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,680
I can't stand you right now!
You pig!

33
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,040
You..

34
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
You..

35
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Which guy would say no to
a stripper on his Bachelor's Party?

36
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,720
Baby..
- I hate you. You ruined my life.

37
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,160
Ruined what?
It's not like I had sex with her.

38
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,440
I can't believe I was going
to get married to a shit face..

39
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Guys, listen.

40
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Don't fight.

41
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,280
Great advice.

42
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
You have better advice?

43
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Are they breaking
up because of me?

44
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,240
They aren't breaking
up because of me either.

45
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
She wanted to test him.
She asked me to do it and I did.

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
But one should be smart
enough to know where to stop.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
Even I threw a Bachelor's Party.

48
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
He asked me to get strippers.
But did I?

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,560
Because you know
your friend too well.

50
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,200
Which guy would say no to
a stripper on his Bachelor's Party?

51
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
What do you expect him to say?

52
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,160
'Sorry, ma'am,
but I am getting married tomorrow.'

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,760
Should we just cancel
the wedding then?

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,840
Listen to me. He is innocent.

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
Babe, I saw what he was trying to..
- It's not what it looked like.

56
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,160
He was not into it.

57
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
Guys often succumb to peer pressure

58
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,600
wondering what their friends
will say.

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,440
He was just pretending.

60
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
But he went for it..
- Trust me.

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
I was sitting on his lap.

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,680
I can tell.

63
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,880
I couldn't feel a thing.

64
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,840
Really?

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240
It had only been 15 seconds, and..

66
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Guys often succumb
to peer pressure.

67
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,160
He had to act happy.

68
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
He was not into it.

69
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Trust me.

70
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
Trust me, baby.

71
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,080
Great time..
- I am getting married.

72
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
Thank you.
- Bye.

73
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
I am getting married.

74
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,120
Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
Good night.

76
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Hi!

77
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,480
Hello.

78
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,520
Hello. Hello. Hello.

79
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,240
Good morning.
- Morning.

80
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
Wild night?
- Coffee?

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,120
Thanks.

82
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't remember exactly,
but I think I had fun last night.

83
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I mean,
I'm sure we must have had fun.

84
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,920
No one's ever complained.

85
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,800
I just want to clarify that you
shouldn't have any expectations.

86
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,240
I mean last night was nice

87
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
but don't think we have a future.

88
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
And don't get me wrong.

89
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
It's not like I didn't enjoy.

90
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,440
But it's just that I am not looking
at a relationship right now.

91
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
I just want to make it clear

92
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,920
in case you have any expectations
that this can turn into something.

93
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,360
And trust me, it's got nothing
to do with you not being so young.

94
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,320
I know this must be sounding
weird and you must be wondering

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
how a girl can say all this after
waking up in a stranger's bedroom.

96
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,720
I guess your bedroom got lucky.

97
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,680
My guest room got lucky.

98
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,840
You were saying?

99
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,960
You mean nothing
happened between us?

100
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Why?

101
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,240
I mean, you don't get lucky with
a hot girl like me everyday.

102
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,520
Plus you're not that old
that you can't do anything.

103
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,400
So you could do me and you didn't.

104
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
There must have been a reason.

105
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,280
I don't sleep with drunk women.

106
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,800
I don't give them the excuse
of not being in their senses.

107
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Whosoever they are, they should
know what they are doing.

108
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
You lost your chance.

109
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,400
You're not going to get
me while I'm in my senses.

110
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,080
"Prancing around without a care."

111
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,360
"Drinking the night away."

112
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,520
"Prancing around without a care."

113
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
"Drinking the night away."

114
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,440
"When my heart insists"

115
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
"I just grab a peg."

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,520
"Makes me blush till I turn red."

117
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

118
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
"I am intoxicating."

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

120
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,720
"I am intoxicating."

121
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,720
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

122
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,400
"I am intoxicating."

123
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,280
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

124
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,520
"I am intoxicating."

125
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,280
"Your feet sway and your
eyes look the other way."

126
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,400
"Because you drink up a storm."

127
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,840
"Your feet sway and your
eyes look the other way."

128
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,120
"because you drink up a storm."

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
"Leaving empty
bottles in your wake."

130
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,120
"Leaving empty
bottles in your wake."

131
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,960
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."

132
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,280
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."

133
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,720
"All I need is
the local specialty"

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,840
"then I am going to dance
till the end."

135
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,800
"All I need is
the local specialty"

136
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,960
"then I am going to dance
till the end."

137
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,200
"Guys keep shouting,
and I just pout."

138
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,040
"I want to just lose control."

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,960
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

140
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,480
"I am intoxicating."

141
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,520
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

142
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,120
"I am intoxicating."

143
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

144
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,120
"I am intoxicating."

145
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,880
"Guys say I am intoxicating."

146
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,720
"I am intoxicating."

147
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,000
"Leaving empty bottles
in your wake."

148
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,280
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."

149
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,200
"Leaving empty bottles
in your wake."

150
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,960
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."

151
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
Trying to drown your sorrows?

152
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,200
Regretting that
you lost your chance.

153
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,160
I know I am hot.

154
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,960
Aren't they looking happy?

155
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,080
God bless those two.

156
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
You almost got
their wedding cancelled.

157
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
Me?

158
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
I am the reason they got married.

159
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
They were almost on
the verge of calling it off.

160
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
I don't get it.

161
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,440
If there is a need to test it

162
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
then how can it be love?

163
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
I have a question.

164
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
Is sleeping together
once enough to fall in love?

165
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Then how can it be
enough to fall out of it?

166
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
True.

167
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,760
What a great thought.

168
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,920
Well, it's hard to answer
that question, but often

169
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
one falls in love
when you don't sleep together.

170
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,200
You are hitting on me.

171
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
As I said

172
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
you don't have a chance
with me while I am in my senses.

173
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
Are you ever in your senses?

174
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,160
Do you have a problem with my
drinking?

175
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
I like alcohol.

176
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,800
You look married and your actions
clearly indicate you're divorced.

177
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,400
How old are you?

178
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,200
I just turned 25
a couple of days ago.

179
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
You see

180
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,680
according to the
constitution of dating

181
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,280
age minus 7 into 2
is the maximum allowed.

182
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
What?

183
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,040
I am 26.

184
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,760
So 26 minus 7 into 2 is..

185
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,800
38.

186
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,440
38 is the maximum allowed.

187
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
Then you have no chance.

188
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I am much older than that.

189
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
That will be a little weird.

190
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,760
By the way,
you've got the formula all wrong.

191
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
It's into 2 minus 7.

192
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
26 into 2 minus 7. 45.

193
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,680
Are you under 45?
- No.

194
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,760
Don't pine too much for me.

195
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,480
I'll call if I'm in the mood.

196
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,120
Seems weird
now that you think about it.

197
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,600
But doesn't feel that way.

198
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,440
24 years' age gap

199
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,320
is a little too much.

200
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,960
But doesn't feel that way to me.

201
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,200
That's called a generation gap,
not an age-gap.

202
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Rich old man, hot young girl.

203
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,440
Hot young girl with daddy issues.

204
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,200
Spare me
the psychological knowledge.

205
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
What daddy issues?

206
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,280
How would I know?

207
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
I'll have to do a
session with her for that.

208
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Give her my card.

209
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,120
And tell her I only meet by
appointment.

210
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Are you out of your mind?

211
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,200
You think I'll refer you
to a girl I've only met twice.

212
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,320
And you're intellectualizing
this for no reason.

213
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,160
It's pretty simple.
A guy and a girl met.

214
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,960
They flirted.
And they liked it.

215
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Let me put that right.

216
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,240
A rich old guy and
a hot young girl met.

217
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,400
She saw the money,
the old guy saw the youth.

218
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,080
And now they are both trying
to achieve what they don't have.

219
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,280
Elementary, my dear Ashish.

220
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,440
You're a very negative person.

221
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,160
But my degree is real.

222
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,840
It's not been photo-shopped
and printed

223
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,520
on a good quality paper for me
to frame it.

224
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Who is the doctor here?

225
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,760
Me.

226
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,520
I handle hundreds
of cases like this.

227
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh, please!

228
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,960
Every week you show
up asking me to lend you money.

229
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,160
Nobody comes to get counselled
by you.

230
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,360
You do, don't you?

231
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,960
Imagine how low you can get.

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
And what are you
trying to assert here?

233
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,120
I'll pay you back every
last penny I owe with interest.

234
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,200
You're going to need it when she
robs you of everything you have.

235
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,960
You are a misogynist.

236
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,960
Of course.

237
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,240
Because no girl has ever
flirted with a guy for his money.

238
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Misogynist.

239
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,960
If I am a misogynist,
then you are a dog.

240
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,520
You think it's love.

241
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
It's just lust. Plain lust!

242
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,040
Who knows your feelings better,
you or me?

243
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,520
I am the doctor.

244
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,160
If you're a doctor, then I.. I..

245
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,800
What?

246
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
Imagining you as a doctor is so
difficult

247
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,600
I can't find an example for it.

248
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
Your time is up.

249
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Get out.
Your time is up.

250
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,200
58 minutes.

251
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Fine, sit.

252
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,440
Pervert old man.

253
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
You..
- Time up.

254
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,880
Sir, we plan on bottling
Arctic Air.

255
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,280
In 2 to 10 litre bottles.

256
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,880
And so, whenever you
want to escape from the

257
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,760
stressful pollution
filled environment you're in

258
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,280
you simply

259
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,760
open a bottle of fresh air.

260
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
It's so clever, isn't it?

261
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,080
And you can have a vacation
in your very own office.

262
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,040
'Hope you weren't
getting restless.'

263
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,480
It's genius, isn't it?

264
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,520
'You were getting restless
to ask this. Weren't you?'

265
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
We're going to call it..

266
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,280
A Breath of Fresh..

267
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,720
'Oh, please.'

268
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,200
'It's okay. You can admit it.'

269
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,120
'Okay, don't act smart.
Meet me at the bar at 12.'

270
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,240
Thank you so much.

271
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,040
I can't have two.

272
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,800
Cheers, mate.

273
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Thank you, good night.

274
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Good night, Bob.

275
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
Bye, love you.

276
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,960
Such decent old guys those two.

277
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
So cute.

278
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,840
They come here every day
and wait until the bar closes.

279
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,200
I thought
my age would be a problem.

280
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,240
But you only find old guys cute.

281
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,720
Do you own the place?

282
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
No. I work here.

283
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,520
I'm poor.

284
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,400
Did you come all the way
here from India to work in a bar?

285
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,760
I came to study.

286
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,320
College got over,
and I started working.

287
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
As a student,
I used to bartend on weekends.

288
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,840
Now I have a job
from Monday to Friday

289
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,040
and this on weekends.

290
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,040
And before you ask any more
questions

291
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,960
the job pays good money,
but it's boring.

292
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
And I do this because it's fun.

293
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,040
I'm an Engineer by degree.

294
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,960
There are two kinds
of people in this world.

295
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,240
Career oriented and job oriented.

296
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,840
I am the job-oriented kind.

297
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
But you look like the career type.

298
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,240
Do tell me. Don't be shy.

299
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,960
I am into investments.

300
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I invest in companies while they
are still young and have a scope

301
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,200
so I can reap the benefits later.

302
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
And I thought my
age will be a problem.

303
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,040
You invest in things
before they grow

304
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,480
so you can take advantage later.

305
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,360
Only if I see scope in it.

306
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,200
Did you invite me
over to do the dishes?

307
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,720
To check the scope.

308
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,040
You made me do the dishes,
clean the place.

309
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,800
Now let me drop you home too.

310
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,240
I am not going home.

311
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
Why?

312
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
My roommate's boyfriend
has come over.

313
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,200
And he's very irritating.

314
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,280
Go ahead and ask, don't be shy.

315
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
What?

316
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
You can stay over at my place.

317
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,720
Even I'll get some dishes done.

318
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,720
So, what's the biggest problem
men have nearing their fifties?

319
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,320
They can't score. Period.

320
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,560
They bought into the lies
of Pharma companies

321
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,320
ever since mid-life crises hit,
but they still can't score.

322
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,960
Problem is they are trying
to score with the younger ladies.

323
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,280
Hello.

324
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Is the offer still on?

325
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
If you promise
I'll be safe with you.

326
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,920
I will try my best.

327
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,320
Send me your address
and I'll pick you up.

328
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,440
I almost bought your pitch.

329
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,040
India.

330
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
Punjabi.

331
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
When did you get here?

332
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
I just got here.

333
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,800
I mean,
when did you come to London?

334
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,320
2001.

335
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,720
Illegal immigrant?

336
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Visa.

337
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,200
Did you get citizenship?

338
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Great.
What brings you here?

339
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
I'm here to pick someone up.

340
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
Me too.

341
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,160
My girlfriend lives here.

342
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,400
She is angry,
but I will make it up to her.

343
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,720
"You still make my heart
skip a beat."

344
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
"I miss you, baby,
from head to feet."

345
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,960
"I admit I was a cheat."

346
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,560
And I'll add a nice line
after this.

347
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,120
Nice?

348
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
I know.

349
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,680
Who are you waiting for?

350
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,400
Your girlfriend's roommate.

351
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,880
Ayesha's roommate.

352
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,440
Ayesha?

353
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,920
Baby.

354
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,680
You didn't tell me
that your dad's visiting.

355
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,840
I told you it's over.
Just leave me alone.

356
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,600
We're done.

357
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,840
Okay, fine.

358
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
But our fight wasn't that serious
that you couldn't tell me

359
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,160
dad is coming.

360
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
And I even wrote a rap for you.

361
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
"You still make my heart
skip a beat."

362
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,840
"I miss you, baby,
from head to feet."

363
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,120
"I admit I was a cheat."

364
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,960
"I admit I was a cheat."

365
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,160
"Swear on my mom,
it will never repeat."

366
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,160
Thank you, sir.

367
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
He's not my dad.

368
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Then who is he?

369
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,200
Why should I tell you?

370
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,680
Where are you going, Ayesha?

371
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
Who is this guy?
Your uncle, older brother..

372
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
Tell me something, Ayesha.

373
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
I have a confession.

374
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,080
I lied to you.

375
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
That wasn't my roommate's
boyfriend, he was my boyfriend

376
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,960
that guy you just met.

377
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,960
He cheated on me within
a month of dating.

378
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,960
It's 10 minutes late for
it to qualify as a confession.

379
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,720
But okay.

380
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,400
"You make my.."

381
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,880
"You make my heart.."

382
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,960
"You make my heart skip.."

383
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,080
Really?

384
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,200
You okay?

385
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,960
Yes, just irritated.

386
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,400
Ayesha. Ayesha.

387
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,520
Please hear me out.
- What the hell are you doing here?

388
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
Do you have no shame?

389
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,560
Get lost and don't
show me your face again.

390
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,720
I really love you.

391
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,480
Let's just give us one more chance.

392
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,400
Please.

393
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,160
Even if you are the last guy on
earth, you won't have a chance.

394
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
Do you understand?

395
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,880
Now go to hell.

396
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,360
At least hear me out.
Ayesha, please hear me out.

397
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,360
Please, just this once.
Open the door, Ayesha.

398
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,680
Ayesha, please.

399
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,560
Ayesha, please.

400
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,040
Please listen to me.

401
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,280
Ayesha, please.
Ayesha, what are you doing?

402
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
Ayesha, please listen to me.

403
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Ayesha..

404
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,240
Hello.

405
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,560
She is all I have, Uncle..

406
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,400
Ashish.

407
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Uncle Ashish, please talk to her.

408
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,480
This is not the way.

409
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
You tell me, is this the way
to behave?

410
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,200
Whatever happens,
happens for the best.

411
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,720
I had even booked a cottage
for us on the outskirts of London

412
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,240
where we would've
lived after marriage.

413
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,120
You may be able to see it
from here also.

414
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,960
There is nothing wrong with you.

415
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
You can find more girls.

416
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,680
And anyway,
Ayesha is not fit for you.

417
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,560
No, Uncle.
She's the right one for me.

418
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,560
Think about it.

419
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,400
Everyone makes small mistakes.

420
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,880
But that doesn't justify kissing a
stranger just to make you jealous.

421
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
Yes. Exactly, Uncle.

422
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,080
Ashish.

423
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
Uncle Ashish,
what kind of behaviour is this?

424
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,080
Who does something like this?

425
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,760
Are you a stranger?

426
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,400
If you are a stranger, then why
is she staying with you, Ashish?

427
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,360
Uncle..

428
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,440
Ashish.

429
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
She is using me too

430
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,360
just like she used you.

431
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,400
And how exactly did Ayesha use me?

432
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,640
What else will you call it?

433
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Till it suited her, she stayed with
you, went out with you, kissed you.

434
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,120
And when she got over you,
she kissed someone else.

435
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,520
If you don't value yourself,
then others won't either.

436
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
It's about your self-respect.

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,520
You must prove to her
that she is the one losing out.

438
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,680
How?

439
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Come on.
- Let's go.

440
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,240
Stop calling her,
stop pleading, stop crying!

441
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,160
Be strong.

442
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
Be very, very strong.

443
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,560
Don't even look back.

444
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,960
Then she will understand.

445
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,080
You are right.

446
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,680
That's the only way
to get Ayesha back, Uncle.

447
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,920
Ashish.

448
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
I am glad you understand.

449
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,640
Now you better leave
before she comes out

450
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,960
otherwise she will think
that you're good-for-nothing.

451
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,920
You're still here after
she said all those things to you.

452
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,760
Thank you, Uncle.

453
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
Only you understand me.. Uncle..

454
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,320
'At the gym,
Alfred will get you.'

455
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,880
All that effort for me?

456
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Don't put so much performance
pressure on yourself.

457
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Elders say that one should
pick a hobby befitting their age.

458
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,360
What's the point of ending up with
broken bones at such an old age?

459
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
Don't insult yourself so much.

460
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,760
And anyway, I changed my
mind after seeing your choice.

461
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,480
I cannot stoop that low.

462
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,200
You are better off with him.

463
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,680
Then why did you drive him away?

464
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,160
If a poor, helpless woman
seeks help, I cannot turn her down.

465
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
I am old-fashioned that way.

466
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,880
You're old in everything?

467
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,120
You are really cheap.

468
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,400
Show me your body.

469
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,160
Show it.
- Shut up.

470
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,640
At least show me your chest.

471
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,760
Are you mad?
- Or your biceps.

472
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,280
Come on. Don't be shy.

473
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
What about abs?
Do you have abs?

474
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,600
Breakfast?

475
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
Unfortunately,
there are no potholes here.

476
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,240
You won't get an excuse
to hit the brakes.

477
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,440
You're really cheap.

478
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,360
What are you doing?

479
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,920
How long have you been here?
- It's been 16 years.

480
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Family?

481
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,760
India.

482
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,200
Kids?

483
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,840
A son and a daughter.

484
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
That's been my only regret.

485
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,120
In order to live my life on
my own terms, I left them behind.

486
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,960
Feeling bad for your kids,
not for your wife?

487
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,280
It was a mutual decision
between Manju and me.

488
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,440
We were in college together.

489
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,840
In the beginning,
we both wanted the same life.

490
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,160
But as the years went by,
we both wanted different things.

491
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,480
The kids had no say in this.

492
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,400
You know, people say I am selfish.

493
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,040
Maybe I am.

494
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,800
I accept I am not a good father.

495
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,960
But I feel if I had stayed back

496
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
then I would've been worse.

497
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,520
I wish I could live this life
with Manju, Ishika, and Ishaan.

498
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,360
But doesn't matter if I can't.

499
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
You are a cool guy.

500
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,720
I mean, very few 50-year-olds
are so happy and so cool.

501
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,280
Try as much as you want,
the fact is

502
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,280
you're struggling with yourself
as to why you can't resist me.

503
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,280
Constantly bringing up
the age-discussion

504
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,800
only to make yourself feel normal,
that you..

505
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
And what?

506
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,720
That you were with me last night
and are with me again this morning.

507
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,080
Shall we order?

508
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,880
What?

509
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,960
You get a text saying
'Come down to the bar'.

510
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,280
When you get there,
you find out that she is a waiter.

511
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,560
Only as a hobby.

512
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,520
Fair enough.

513
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,760
She does it as a hobby.

514
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,680
You spend two hours with her,
cleaning the place

515
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,440
doing the dishes,
and let her rent your room for free

516
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,200
all this for nothing in return.

517
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,800
Are you blind?

518
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,960
Can't you see that she's
trying to take over your home?

519
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
You're out of your mind
and you're over-analyzing it.

520
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,680
Who is the doctor?

521
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,880
Me.

522
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
Should I show you my degree?
- Fine!

523
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
Continue.

524
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,560
People seek support from
their children when they turn old

525
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,880
not from wives that
are their children's age.

526
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
At a time when you should be
walking your daughter

527
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
down the aisle, you are..

528
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
What's the opposite
of walking down the aisle?

529
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,920
Whatever.
You're doing just that.

530
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,440
I am not the first guy in the world

531
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,200
who's thinking of dating a girl
half his age.

532
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,560
There have been others.
Were they all unsuccessful?

533
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,520
Oh, really?

534
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
Name one successful couple.
Come on, tell me.

535
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,520
Michael Douglas and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

536
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
George Clooney and his wife.

537
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,240
Saif and Kareena.

538
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,480
I have nothing to say.

539
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,400
I can't solve your stupid problems.

540
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,920
Exactly. Exactly
what I am talking about.

541
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,880
Just shut up.

542
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,440
I never said I have a problem.

543
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,560
Every time I come over

544
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,440
you make me sit in that
chair and send me the bill.

545
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,400
Now I know why you
feel she is exploiting me.

546
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,680
Because you exploit me, you feel
everyone else exploits me too.

547
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,080
Get out.
Get out now.

548
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,200
Be thankful that I see
you without an appointment.

549
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I handle ten cases like this
every day.

550
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,880
And there will be a problem,
I guarantee it.

551
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,400
If you don't end up in that chair
sobbing your heart out one day

552
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,320
then I'll tear up my degree.

553
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,960
That photo-shopped one.

554
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
It's real.

555
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,440
Smells nice.

556
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,200
Indian?

557
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,040
No, I've made pasta with a
pinch of salt and a dash of pepper.

558
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,280
Indian!

559
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,080
I don't eat lentils.
- Why?

560
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,080
I just don't.
- Who doesn't eat lentils?

561
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,040
I don't.

562
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,640
As you wish.

563
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
What else will you eat?

564
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,080
You eat,
I'll check what else we have.

565
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
I know you put in a lot
of effort to make that.

566
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,160
And it even looks tasty.

567
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,880
But I can't find anything to eat.

568
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,760
Let's go out.

569
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,360
Really? Nothing at all?

570
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,200
I am leaving the lentils
only for your sake.

571
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,560
Now I feel guilty.

572
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I'll have it with curd instead.

573
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,160
No, no. I'll feel guilty
if you don't eat.

574
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,680
Let's go out.

575
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Have a pleasant evening.

576
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
Is he going to leave us with
cutlery for the next three days?

577
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,720
One for the oysters, soup..
- Mr. Fancy.

578
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I know.

579
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,520
We start with the
ones on the outside

580
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,080
and use the ones
on the inside in the end.

581
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,280
You are not the only
sophisticated one here.

582
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,360
I didn't know that when
I came here for the first time.

583
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,480
Illiterate.

584
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,960
The price of a chicken entree is
enough to open my own poultry farm.

585
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,360
Ms. Sophisticated,
I come here for business lunches.

586
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,880
Calm down.
- It's okay.

587
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,840
Even the Indians
out here are so English

588
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,400
that they won't understand Hindi.

589
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
You insisted on coming
to this fancy place.

590
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,840
I wanted some simple Indian food.

591
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,480
I want to eat, not pretend to eat.

592
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,120
What do you expect
me to order from this?

593
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,520
Lentil soup with minced
vegetables, with a hint of mint.

594
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,960
The menu is for English people.

595
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,920
It's not my fault that
they don't know what 'Dal' means.

596
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,360
Your fault is that you thought you
would take me to an upscale place

597
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,560
I'll be impressed
and think you're hot shit..

598
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,360
Shut up. Seriously shut up.

599
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,760
Just tell me what you want to eat.

600
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
Forget it.

601
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,120
Looking at your level, if
I take you where I go to eat

602
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,400
you won't stop cribbing.

603
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,440
Come on.

604
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,960
They serve you 10 pieces of cutlery
to justify their exorbitant prices.

605
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,040
We just want to eat.

606
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,080
It's not like they saute
their food with gold or silver.

607
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,800
It's a 150 years old restaurant.

608
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,440
Seriously, everything in
my life these days is antique.

609
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,960
Can you tell me the time, buddy?

610
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,720
It's 11.

611
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,760
He's asking for the time
and you're giving him your watch.

612
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,720
We're being mugged.

613
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,880
Wallet.

614
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,760
Him?

615
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,440
Even the bouncers at
my club are double his size.

616
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,080
Are they here now?
- You are.

617
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
What's the point of all
that boxing you do?

618
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,960
Will you just let
them take what they want?

619
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I do it for fitness.

620
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,280
I like your coat.

621
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,200
You're simply giving
him whatever he's asking for.

622
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,880
Will you let him take me away too?

623
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
You don't like me?

624
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
"Singham."

625
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,840
"The mind boggles,
the body shivers"

626
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,080
"when they learn of
the arrival of.."

627
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,040
"Singham."

628
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Can we go?

629
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,040
What?

630
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,080
A slap?

631
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Go on.

632
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
I want to see him fly.

633
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
Make him fly.

634
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,280
He fell down here.

635
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,320
And that guy is still moving.

636
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,760
Do you want me to kill them?

637
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
At least knock him out cold.

638
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,440
Like a knockout in boxing.

639
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
Hit him.

640
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
He was going to touch me.

641
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,440
Your wallet.

642
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
This is for looking at my woman.

643
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm asking you to punch,
but you're delivering a dialogue.

644
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
Jacket.

645
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

646
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,280
Of course.

647
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,800
I should have let them
take you away.

648
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,080
Imagine my plight if
you hadn't been around today.

649
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,320
How can I thank you for putting
your life at stake to save me?

650
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,880
This is for trying to be a hero.

651
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,720
There is an age for everything.

652
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,920
You picked a fight
for such a small amount.

653
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,320
Did I challenge them?

654
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,720
I was giving them everything.

655
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,680
But no.

656
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,960
Who said, 'What's the point of
all that boxing you do?'

657
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,680
'Will you let him
take me away too?'

658
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,480
They never even looked at you.

659
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,360
You gave them that idea.

660
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
You are so attention-hungry.

661
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,520
Poor guys
got beaten up for no reason.

662
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,600
Poor guy.

663
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,520
You walk around wearing
an expensive watch

664
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,080
and I am hungry for attention.

665
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
Is it my fault that
I am not poor like you?

666
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,360
Was it my idea to walk?

667
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,680
We could have just given
them the money and left.

668
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,960
That reminds me, where's my money?

669
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
What money?

670
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,480
The ones you took from
them for looking at 'my woman'!

671
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Forget it.

672
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,440
I beat them up, my fingers
are swollen, so I earned it.

673
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,920
You will skim off a woman?

674
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Yes, I will.

675
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,640
Fine.

676
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,120
You can keep it.

677
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,960
And anyway, I am not your woman.

678
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,160
Okay. Okay.

679
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Half-half?

680
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,400
Good night.

681
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,800
"I have witnessed
your beauty in my dreams."

682
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,560
"My heart feels you look familiar."

683
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,440
"Every day I woke up with the image
of your beautiful face in my eyes."

684
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,720
"But I never knew that
you were meant for me"

685
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,360
"and now I feel.."

686
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,960
"Even though we met late"

687
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,440
"at least we did."

688
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,640
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."

689
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,240
"We came closer."

690
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,560
"Even though we met late"

691
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,120
"at least we did."

692
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,200
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."

693
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,160
"We came close."

694
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,240
"I want to be with you every day"

695
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,560
"using any excuse."

696
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,880
"I'll begin to understand myself,
once I understand you."

697
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,920
"I want to see what
you want me to see"

698
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,840
"and hear what you want me
to hear."

699
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,680
"I don't need to breathe"

700
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,480
"because you're my life now."

701
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,800
"Even though we met late"

702
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,400
"at least we did."

703
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,520
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."

704
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,240
"We came closer."

705
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,360
"Even though we met late"

706
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
"at least we did."

707
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,160
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."

708
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,520
"We came closer."

709
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,720
I am sure you must be dealing
with many cases like these

710
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,280
ones with age difference.

711
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,040
Hundreds of them.

712
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,600
But they all come late.
- What?

713
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
I mean they should
come six months earlier.

714
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,480
But they all turn up
after the divorce.

715
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,040
I mean, it's quite amazing.

716
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,240
Even in a highly educated
place like London

717
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,920
the concept of a prenup
is unknown to most of them.

718
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
It's not completely their fault,
you know.

719
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
The first lesson
of every gold-digging session

720
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,560
is about how to avoid
the prenup discussion.

721
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,280
You should call me
to give a lecture one day.

722
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,040
Don't listen to him. He's crazy.

723
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,520
This is why no one ever
invites him to their home.

724
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,080
Really? - I'll get a refill.
- For me too.

725
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,200
Okay.

726
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,880
Have you lost your mind?

727
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,200
You should thank me.

728
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,040
The prenup's going
to come up sooner or later.

729
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,640
This is not your clinic.

730
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,640
Really?

731
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,280
If a cardiologist visits a friend
and his friend gets a heart attack

732
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,320
the cardiologist won't save him

733
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,160
but tell him
to come to his clinic the next day.

734
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,600
A doctor is always a doctor,
whether he's in his clinic or not.

735
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,840
Have your dinner and leave.

736
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,480
Don't make an issue,
I'll tear up my degree.

737
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,440
Fine. Let's get serious
and talk about the next step.

738
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,280
Marriage. Kids.
What have you thought?

739
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,520
No.
- What no?

740
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,960
You haven't thought, or you're not
looking to start a family?

741
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,800
I didn't give it a thought.
- Then do it now.

742
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,880
I don't want to.

743
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,160
What do you mean you don't want to?

744
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,080
Thank you.

745
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,920
The weather seems
to be getting bad.

746
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,200
Did you give it a thought?
- Gave what a thought?

747
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,040
Avoiding the question
won't make it go away.

748
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,120
Do you want to get married now?

749
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,480
Do you want to have kids now?

750
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,600
Not now, but at some point.

751
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
And yes, at some point
I want to have kids.

752
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,080
Some point means

753
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,200
marriage in two years
and kids in four.

754
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,080
Ashish, there's no point of
discussing it with that attitude.

755
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,720
Let it be.

756
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,840
What can I say, Ayesha?

757
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,920
I am 50.

758
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,040
I've been a bad husband.

759
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,080
I've been a bad father.

760
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,920
I don't want to have kids
and not be there for them again.

761
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,520
In two years I'll turn 52

762
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,320
and in four years I'll turn 54.

763
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,120
I don't want to be the father
of a 10-year-old at the age of 65.

764
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,840
By the time he's in college,
I'll turn 70

765
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,360
or I might not even be around
anymore.

766
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,920
I can't.. I mean..

767
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,120
What are we doing then?

768
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,520
I am living the day.

769
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,120
And what about tomorrow?

770
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't know.

771
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,120
There's a big difference
between your tomorrow and mine.

772
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,960
Your tomorrow
is much more than mine.

773
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,360
This won't work, will it?

774
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,640
Everyone will always think
I am with you for your money.

775
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,720
And you're with me
because I am hot and young.

776
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,920
I am immature and you are boring.

777
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,400
I want to explore new things

778
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,040
but you've practically
experienced all of them first hand.

779
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,520
And you'll have to do everything
all over again for my sake.

780
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
You'll have to go back to
the same places again.

781
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
Make the same mistakes again.

782
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,120
Have the same quarrels again.

783
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,840
Cajole me again.

784
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,960
Choose our song again.

785
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
Think of a pet name again.

786
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,800
Tell the same lies again.

787
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,360
Endure the same taunts again.

788
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,440
Laugh for the same joys again.

789
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,080
Shed tears over the
same sorrows again.

790
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,600
You will be forced to relive
your life all over again

791
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,920
and I'll feel I am living
an already lived, stale life.

792
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,840
Aren't you going to say anything?

793
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,640
What can I say?

794
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,920
You have already made up your mind.

795
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,760
That's the sensibility
I don't want.

796
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,320
I won't make fake promises
of efforts I know I can't make.

797
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,720
But I know that I love you.

798
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,200
I know that life doesn't come to
a standstill when someone leaves.

799
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,640
It's just a matter of habit.

800
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,160
You will get over it soon.

801
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,840
And so will I.

802
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,960
"I know we've parted ways,
sweetheart"

803
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,960
"but I still want you to know."

804
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,200
"I know we've parted ways,
sweetheart"

805
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,600
"but I still want you to know."

806
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,960
"If you ever miss me"

807
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,240
"just come over."

808
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,640
"If you think I'll ever forget you"

809
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,960
"then you are wrong."

810
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,280
"If you ever miss me"

811
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,120
"just come over."

812
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,400
"I had no one
except for you."

813
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,160
"You had become more
important to me than breathing."

814
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,080
"I may not mean anything to you"

815
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,960
"but you meant everything to me."

816
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,120
"Don't ever leave me"

817
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,480
"is what you always used to say."

818
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,840
"I have no more reasons to smile"

819
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,160
"as even you moved on like time."

820
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,480
"It had fallen for you,
and still is"

821
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,960
"my heat's crazy, you know."

822
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,200
"If you ever miss me"

823
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,480
"just come over."

824
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,800
"I did as you said"

825
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:59,800
"only I know how
I consoled my heart."

826
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,320
"Be happy, wherever you are."

827
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,800
"There was never anything
between us anyway."

828
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,920
"Doesn't matter how far away
we are from each other's eyes"

829
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:26,520
"we will meet everyday
in the world of dreams."

830
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,960
"This is as far as
we were meant to be."

831
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,200
"Now you must return."

832
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,520
"If you ever miss me"

833
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,760
"just come over."

834
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Seriously? Her?

835
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,960
This is all
you could find after me?

836
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,760
You think she can
help you get over me.

837
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,960
You have no standard, but think
about my reputation.

838
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,520
You can settle for anything?

839
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,720
I can't believe that
from this, you've gone to this.

840
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,120
I can't get over you.

841
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,880
You said I will get over you,
but I can't.

842
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,960
See, you don't know everything.

843
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,720
You can't know everything.

844
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,600
I am not asking for much.

845
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,920
If nothing else, then make me
a habit you can't give up.

846
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,880
You are a total amateur.

847
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,960
I was thinking I should introduce
you to Manju and the kids.

848
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,080
Why?

849
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,160
I mean, how come suddenly?

850
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,800
Just..

851
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,240
I never imagined something like
this would ever happen in my life.

852
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,200
But now that it has

853
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,760
I would want them to know.

854
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,200
I mean, if you are comfortable.

855
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,280
When was the last time
you met them?

856
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,080
It's been a couple of years.

857
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,160
Never had a chance to
go and meet them recently.

858
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,280
Do you need their blessings?

859
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,520
That's not it.

860
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,760
I was joking! Let's go.

861
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,040
Not today. We'll leave next week.

862
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,000
Okay.

863
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
Don't worry.

864
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,440
Nowadays it's not a
big deal to meet the family.

865
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,600
It's cool.

866
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,320
I am not from 'nowadays'.

867
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,840
'I am not from 'nowadays'.'

868
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,720
We need a better story.

869
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,880
What story?

870
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,920
Our story,
which you will tell them.

871
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,960
About how we met.

872
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,040
Meaning?

873
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,320
I mean, what are you going
to say when they ask how we met?

874
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,960
Look at the mountains.
It's so pretty.

875
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,320
See.

876
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,200
She came home dressed as a stripper

877
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,480
and then you found her unconscious
in your home the next day.

878
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,880
That story won't work here.

879
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,320
That story won't work anywhere.

880
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,280
Exactly.

881
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,400
So then?

882
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,880
I said we'll tell them the truth

883
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,720
but I never said
we'll tell them details.

884
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,960
We met through common friends,
simple.

885
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,960
Too boring.
Think of something else.

886
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,480
Hey, look at the clouds.

887
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,720
How are you, Pintu?
- Fine.

888
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,800
Get the luggage.

889
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,360
I'll say we met at
the temple while praying.

890
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,880
That will make a
good impression on them.

891
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,120
Don't worry, I love you,
you love me.

892
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,400
No one's going to
ask any more questions.

893
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,400
Ishika.
- Who called you?

894
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,480
Ishika?
- Who the hell called you here?

895
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
My daughter.
- Pintu.

896
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,360
Keep the luggage back.
Do it now.

897
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,640
Who told you to get their luggage?

898
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,360
If any random guy walks in here,
will you get their luggage inside?

899
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,080
Who called him here?

900
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,520
It wasn't me.

901
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,160
Who else could it be?

902
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,040
You can't stop smiling.

903
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,400
I wanted to call him,
I even gave it a thought.

904
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,160
But I swear on you,
I didn't call him.

905
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,040
Of all the days,
did it have to be today?

906
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,320
I didn't call him, Ishu.

907
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,200
Munna, who called you here?

908
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,800
Am I not welcome in my own home?

909
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,360
And what does she mean
by today out of all the days?

910
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,720
You can come whenever you like.

911
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,360
Just ask us first.

912
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,720
I'll be right back.

913
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,600
Your home?

914
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,880
What is the colour of
the walls of 'your' home?

915
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,400
I don't care who called him here,
tell him to go back.

916
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,800
Where are your manners?

917
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,360
What's the point now?

918
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,200
Dad.

919
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,440
Hi!
- Ishaan!

920
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,960
Hi, I am Ishaan. His son.

921
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,640
And that's my mom.

922
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,400
Did you call him here?

923
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Why did you?

924
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,080
I told you it was her.

925
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,960
Look at how she is welcoming him.

926
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,040
Traitor.

927
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,320
I didn't call him.

928
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,120
Please tell him to go back,
I don't want him here right now.

929
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,760
Go inside. Don't make
a scene in front of the staff.

930
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,880
What's wrong with her?

931
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,600
Her boyfriend and his father
are coming over tomorrow

932
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,560
to discuss the wedding.

933
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,960
But..

934
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,520
Manju.
- Ayesha.

935
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,240
My wife.

936
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,360
My secretary.

937
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,120
Ishika is getting married and
no one even bothered to tell me.

938
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,360
She isn't getting married.

939
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Her boyfriend's coming
over with his father to meet us.

940
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,600
Even we are meeting
them for the first time.

941
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,680
And what was the point
of having told you?

942
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,280
Would you have come down
from London to meet them?

943
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,680
You couldn't respect any
relationship while you were here

944
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,440
and now you're saying you'd fly
down from London to see the boy.

945
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,280
Does he really think I
need his approval to get married?

946
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,360
This is not about my approval

947
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,000
but I would definitely
like to meet the guy.

948
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,320
What will you say when
they ask about the father?

949
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,360
Were you planning on inviting
me to the wedding, or..

950
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,160
I've already told them
that my father is no more.

951
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,320
Not even separated.

952
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,320
Just dead.

953
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,560
Not dead.

954
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,280
We said he's no more.

955
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,040
Meaning
you're no longer her father.

956
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,440
That's so absurd.

957
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,440
Just because Manju
and I are separated

958
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,040
am I not her father anymore? Give..

959
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,160
Thank you.

960
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,440
Very good.

961
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,120
Make a scene in front of
the outsiders

962
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
so you can look
like the victims.

963
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,160
I will wait outside.

964
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,560
Hello, ma'am. - Bless you, dear.
- Sir..

965
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,200
They're fresh

966
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,520
just the way you like them.

967
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,520
VK, that's Ashish.

968
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,600
Ishika and Ishaan's father.

969
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,680
I see.

970
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,960
How are you?

971
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,680
I am VK.

972
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,400
VK lives in our cottage.

973
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,280
Hi.

974
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,480
Can you excuse us
for a minute, sir?

975
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,640
We're in the middle
of an important discussion.

976
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,240
Mr. VK can stay.

977
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,440
But you just said we won't
discuss this in front of outsiders.

978
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,720
He's not an outsider.

979
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,960
Six months ago
I came here on a holiday.

980
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,160
But after seeing Manju, I realized
that actually life's out here.

981
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,360
So I paid for the entire year.

982
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,600
I've never heard about him.

983
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,160
I've never heard about you either.

984
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,440
I mean they never mentioned you.

985
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,880
By the way, what do you do?

986
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,440
Right now I am trying to
solve an important family matter.

987
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,280
He's asking about your profession.

988
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,200
Go ahead, tell him. Don't be shy.

989
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,280
I am into finance.

990
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Finance! That's fantastic.

991
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,880
Even I am into finance!

992
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,680
I've lent around two myself in the
market at an interest rate of 2%.

993
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,000
How much do you charge?

994
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,200
This is not that kind of finance.

995
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,160
Maybe you're into something else.
But you remind me of a few lines.

996
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,160
"Neither wife, nor kids,
neither father, nor mother"

997
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,360
"the whole thing is that,
his only priority is money."

998
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,600
I knew it right away
that he's a thief.

999
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,120
I mean you steal others' poems.

1000
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,800
Can we finish our discussion now?

1001
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,960
What were you discussing?

1002
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,880
He just found out that
Ishika told Rishi and his father

1003
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,800
that her father is no more.

1004
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,000
Oh, yes, that topic did come up.

1005
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,480
But no need to worry.

1006
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,000
By the way, how long
are you planning on staying?

1007
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,400
He needs to go.

1008
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,720
They are arriving tomorrow morning.

1009
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,040
I am not going anywhere.

1010
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,720
Why are you hell-bent
on messing up my life?

1011
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,480
Let's just lie.

1012
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,800
And anyway, he's going to
stay at a hotel or a guesthouse.

1013
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,120
Just say that he's a tourist.

1014
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,080
Right, sir?

1015
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,480
Not a bad idea.

1016
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,800
Are you all out of your mind?

1017
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,120
Whenever we meet again

1018
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,240
won't they think
what the guest is still doing here?

1019
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,720
Are you going to meet them again?

1020
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,400
I am your father and that's
how I am going to meet them.

1021
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,160
Ashish, she has already told them.

1022
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,480
Whether right or wrong,
it's already done.

1023
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,240
We can't tell them as soon
as they come that she lied to them.

1024
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,960
And even you didn't
inform about your arrival.

1025
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,720
Otherwise,
we would've thought of something.

1026
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,480
My daughter's getting
married and I am her father.

1027
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,960
I want to see who she is marrying.

1028
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,480
You will have to manage.
- You dropped in uninvited.

1029
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,640
Why should we manage?

1030
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,320
But he is right.

1031
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,080
We cannot call him a guest.

1032
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,880
Nor can we ask him to leave.

1033
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,880
Why? Why can't we ask him to leave?

1034
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,200
He cannot come and go as he wishes.

1035
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,880
I have an idea,
we'll say he's a distant relative.

1036
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,240
They won't even meet
that often. This lie will pass.

1037
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,360
And no one will ask questions.

1038
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,240
But no one will invite a distant
relative to the first meeting.

1039
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Then there's just one solution.
Say he's your brother.

1040
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,800
You..

1041
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,560
Only for their sake.

1042
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,480
The uncle can definitely come over.

1043
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,360
And anyway, there's nothing
left between you and Manju.

1044
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,480
Feelings aren't an issue either.

1045
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,960
That's a good idea.

1046
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,160
What's good?

1047
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,320
Stop repeating yourself.

1048
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,680
What do you think
you're doing here?

1049
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,600
You'll make your own son
the brother of his wife?

1050
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,400
Ayesha, I am really sorry.

1051
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,160
Ishika only targeted you because..

1052
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,880
Ayesha, I apologise
for Ishika's behaviour.

1053
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,400
Please don't feel offended.

1054
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,720
It's okay, I understand.

1055
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,520
Have dinner with us
before you leave.

1056
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,480
Leave?

1057
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,800
If she could stay here as well..

1058
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,440
Here? At the cottage?

1059
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,720
No?

1060
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,440
Two cottages are already occupied.

1061
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,800
And I've reserved the third
one for Rishi and his father.

1062
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,440
Book a hotel for her.

1063
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,880
It's okay. I'll manage.

1064
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,120
Sure?

1065
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,600
I don't want to be a burden.

1066
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,680
What are you saying?

1067
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,280
We're trying to manage.

1068
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,880
This is her first trip here.

1069
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,520
She is my responsibility.

1070
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,080
It's not right
to put her in a hotel.

1071
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,880
What's wrong?

1072
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,840
Nothing.

1073
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,080
Ishaan.

1074
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,000
Take dad's luggage to your room.

1075
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,880
And put Ayesha's luggage
in Ishika's room.

1076
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,280
Are you seriously doing this?
- Ishu.

1077
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,720
Let's not make her uncomfortable.
- Ayeshu.

1078
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,000
Ayesha.

1079
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,680
Sorted.

1080
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,760
Sorted.

1081
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,360
Shall we?

1082
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,000
Shall we?

1083
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
So Mr. VK suggested
that we call dad our uncle.

1084
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,040
And we all readily agreed.

1085
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,200
Great idea.

1086
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,240
So, this is your room.

1087
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,040
My room is right next door.

1088
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,200
Please let me know
if you need anything.

1089
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,960
Bag.

1090
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh..

1091
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,400
Thank you.

1092
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,280
You've lost weight.

1093
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,880
Nonsense.

1094
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,120
Thank you, Ayesha.

1095
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,160
Ashish, I was thinking,
I will check into a hotel.

1096
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,120
Why?

1097
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,000
Don't you like your room?

1098
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,120
No, I just don't want to..

1099
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,440
Don't stress yourself,
and eat your food.

1100
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,880
I don't know how things are
in London

1101
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,480
but out here, men who are 20 years
older to you are called 'uncle'.

1102
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,000
She is a colleague.

1103
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,280
How can she call me uncle?
- Let her call you sir.

1104
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,560
You're older than her,
and her boss as well.

1105
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,880
You don't deserve any respect

1106
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,320
but that much respect
she can give you.

1107
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,640
He doesn't like lentils.

1108
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,200
He likes mine.

1109
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,200
Dad.

1110
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,080
Do you know how old Ayesha is?

1111
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
Good night.

1112
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,480
'We need to talk.'

1113
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,440
'Come out through the kitchen,
not the main door.'

1114
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,120
What the hell!

1115
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,280
What the hell!

1116
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,000
What the hell!
I mean, secretary? Seriously?

1117
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,160
What happened?

1118
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,080
I never planned to tell them
everything as soon as I arrived.

1119
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,400
And I never imagined
Ishika would react this way.

1120
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,520
And her in-laws would show up.

1121
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,280
I couldn't have at that moment.

1122
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,520
What?

1123
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,400
Well, after hearing
about Ishika's wedding..

1124
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,440
How is Ishika's wedding
connected with us?

1125
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,440
Come on, you know it was weird.

1126
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,880
So you introduced me as your
secretary.

1127
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,560
Do you know how stupid
this is for me?

1128
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,640
And why am I here?

1129
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,400
Why do I feel I am the only one

1130
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,600
who's uncomfortable
with all of this?

1131
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,560
You think I was comfortable?

1132
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,240
You think I was enjoying it.

1133
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,680
Why would you feel uncomfortable?

1134
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,680
You ate lentils,
which you apparently never eat.

1135
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,080
Oh, so it's about the lentils.

1136
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,800
No. It's about me
being your secretary

1137
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,840
it's about you being a coward,
and it's about your lie..

1138
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,800
I know.

1139
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,120
I will tell everyone about
us as soon as things get normal.

1140
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,520
It's why we're here.

1141
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,200
What do you mean normal?

1142
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,400
I mean as soon as
her in-laws leave.

1143
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,120
Of course.

1144
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,560
What are they going to think?

1145
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,360
Ishika's father is with a
girl that's as old as her daughter.

1146
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,880
Sorry, uncle!

1147
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,320
You are her uncle.

1148
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,520
Your wife is now your sister,
and your lover is your secretary.

1149
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,400
You're never going
to tell them in this life.

1150
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,240
Ex-wife.

1151
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,720
Ex-lover.

1152
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,720
Baby..
- And

1153
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,080
why didn't you tell me
that your kids are my age?

1154
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,880
I told you I have
a daughter and a son.

1155
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,960
Do the math yourself.

1156
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,520
I got separated 18 years ago.

1157
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,480
Ishaan was three
and Ishika was seven.

1158
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,520
7 plus 18 is 25.

1159
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,080
You..

1160
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,400
Just a little more time.

1161
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,120
I love you.

1162
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,640
Good morning, baby.

1163
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,520
I thought it was you.

1164
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,200
I am not your baby.

1165
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,240
Why are you wearing
Ishika's night suit?

1166
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,360
Because I didn't bring mine.
- Why?

1167
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,400
Because I imagined that I'd be
sleeping in your room, next to you.

1168
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,720
And not in Ishika's room,
next to her.

1169
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,760
I am carrying what I
wear when I sleep with you.

1170
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,120
Would you like me to wear that?

1171
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,880
Calm down, baby.

1172
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,960
What?

1173
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,440
Is anybody around?

1174
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,000
It's a bit weird.

1175
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,040
Ishika's clothes.

1176
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,840
Go to hell.

1177
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,960
Don't worry. They will be here.

1178
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,160
Please don't try
to be a part of this.

1179
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,120
And I'm not worried
because of them.

1180
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,360
They are here.

1181
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,080
They are here.

1182
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,840
Rishi did tell me
that you own cottages.

1183
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,680
But I never imagined
anything like this, Manju.

1184
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,080
This is a premium property.

1185
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,880
How big is this property?

1186
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,880
Atul, that's Ishika's grandfather.

1187
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,080
Hello. Hello.
- And that's her grandmother.

1188
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,120
Hello.
- Bless you.

1189
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,680
And that's Ashish, my brother.

1190
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,880
Ishika's uncle.

1191
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,480
You didn't tell me that
her uncle's coming as well.

1192
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,120
Rishi's aunt wanted
to come along too.

1193
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,480
We had a hard time
explaining to her.

1194
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,960
That this is just a family meeting.

1195
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,240
Which made her angry.

1196
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,720
She said, 'Am I not family?'

1197
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,560
She is very close to Rishi.

1198
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,960
If we had known,
we would've brought her along too.

1199
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,880
It was a surprise visit.

1200
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,040
He lives in London
and just arrived yesterday.

1201
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,160
Ishika, wasn't your
dad's name Ashish as well?

1202
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,880
Yes. Coincidence.

1203
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,400
Just a coincidence.

1204
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,120
But you never told me, so..

1205
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,440
It's not something
to hide or tell.

1206
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,000
We never spoke about uncle,
so I never told you.

1207
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,680
Did you tell him about your father?

1208
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,080
She doesn't have
many memories about him

1209
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,040
since he died at an early age.

1210
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,000
Did your family come along too?

1211
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,520
They would if he had one.

1212
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,080
He abandoned them long ago.

1213
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,320
Dad.

1214
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,960
He's separated.

1215
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:43,720
Hello. Hello. Hello, everyone.

1216
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,040
Sir.

1217
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,640
He's our neighbour.

1218
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,280
VK.

1219
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Young lad.

1220
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,480
Apples from our orchard.

1221
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,840
Totally organic.

1222
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,360
Actually, he's not a neighbour,
he's a customer.

1223
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,680
He's on holiday and is
staying in the cottage.

1224
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,360
Bless you.

1225
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,440
He's like your uncle too.

1226
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,960
What are you saying?

1227
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,160
I admit we're close, but

1228
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,480
there's nothing like that.

1229
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,760
And you?

1230
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,960
Are you Ishika's friend or..

1231
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,080
She is his secretary.

1232
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,480
She travels everywhere with him.

1233
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,200
Ayesha.

1234
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,040
Why did we leave your aunt behind..

1235
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,440
Anyway..
- You two get some rest first.

1236
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,120
We can talk later.

1237
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,880
So, Manju,
how do you want to do it?

1238
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,120
Let's do it the way
these two want to do it.

1239
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,960
Fine, they can do it
any way they want to.

1240
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,080
But just do it.

1241
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,440
Big or small destination,
whatever they want.

1242
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,880
I don't think delaying
too much is a good idea.

1243
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,000
Yes, but what's the hurry?

1244
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,320
I mean, we just wanted
all of you to meet first

1245
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,560
so that everyone's satisfied.

1246
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,800
But why delay it?

1247
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,760
Actually, we were thinking of
living together

1248
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,680
for some time before.

1249
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,680
Are you two unsure?

1250
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,840
We're not unsure.

1251
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,280
It's just that we don't
want to lie to ourselves.

1252
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,640
We know we want to
spend our lives together..

1253
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,840
But that's absurd.

1254
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,280
It's out of the question, dear.

1255
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,880
I think they are sure
about their love for each other

1256
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,960
but they only spend
a few hours together.

1257
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,440
And there's a big difference
between spending some time together

1258
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,040
and living together for a lifetime.

1259
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,560
Often there's love,
but no compatibility.

1260
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,320
And live-in is not
a big deal nowadays.

1261
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,320
If they live together before
marriage

1262
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,080
they will only get
to know each other better.

1263
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,280
Ashish, we are not in London.

1264
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,480
What else is there to know?

1265
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,640
If they don't know much about
each other, then why are we here?

1266
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,040
Exactly. You're absolutely right.

1267
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,600
After living all those years
in London, he's lost his mind.

1268
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,480
Live-in is legal in India as well.

1269
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,280
And what is your problem?

1270
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,560
What do you think they will do now
which they haven't already done?

1271
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,880
In fact, if they live in together

1272
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,800
they will have a better
understanding of each other.

1273
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,080
Stop talking nonsense.

1274
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,080
Think before you speak.

1275
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,240
What are you guys saying?

1276
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,800
It's a good thing that
the children are smart.

1277
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,040
Right.

1278
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,480
You and the kids are
the only smart ones.

1279
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,520
Ashish.

1280
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,800
You shouldn't be giving advice
about relationships and marriage.

1281
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,560
Would you have said the same
thing if she was your daughter?

1282
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,200
Yes, I would have.

1283
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:50,400
Then thank God this is not
about your daughter, but hers.

1284
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,920
Excuse me.

1285
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,400
Atul, I didn't know the children
had something like this in mind.

1286
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,520
Can we continue this
discussion tomorrow?

1287
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,000
I'll talk to Ishika as well.

1288
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,880
Are you okay?

1289
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,520
The kids are being sensible.

1290
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,200
They knew
what their reaction would be.

1291
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,280
And yet they mustered
the courage to say it.

1292
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,600
At least give it a thought
before rejecting the idea.

1293
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,240
What's going on for generations
doesn't have to be right

1294
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,400
and what's new is wrong.

1295
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,160
Let's order a hit on his father.

1296
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,600
We'll pick him up.

1297
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,080
End of problems.

1298
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,680
If someone upsets my boss,
and I do nothing about it

1299
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,280
then what kind of a
secretary does that make me?

1300
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,240
I wonder what kind
of a mess I made!

1301
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,880
I'll go take a look.

1302
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,400
Manju must be cleaning it up.

1303
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,240
He wanted to see who I am marrying.

1304
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,120
So why didn't he just do that?

1305
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,400
Why did he have to open his mouth?

1306
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,840
Why did you have to get into it?

1307
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,120
Couldn't you have stayed quiet?

1308
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,520
But I was only trying
to support you.

1309
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,960
I don't need your support.

1310
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,640
This is my life and
I can take care of myself.

1311
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,400
Can we talk?

1312
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,280
Go on, I'll join you.

1313
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,600
It's not easy.

1314
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,240
You can't suddenly come,
and you know..

1315
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,840
I know.

1316
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,000
She wants to do the right thing.

1317
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,600
You should support her.

1318
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,480
That's what I do.

1319
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,200
She is not afraid to express
her views

1320
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,800
of being called wrong.

1321
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,080
She won't listen.

1322
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,800
My daughter.

1323
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,320
Atul, I spoke with Ishika.

1324
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,640
I explained to her.

1325
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,400
They both work in the same city.

1326
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,200
They don't live with us.

1327
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,480
They can meet whenever they want.

1328
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,960
As long as they live separately.

1329
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,440
And then, whether they spend
their days together, or nights

1330
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,360
there is no need to tell us.

1331
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,440
They can live together
without our knowledge.

1332
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,840
We are their parents.

1333
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,200
They can keep that
much from us.

1334
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,600
Right?

1335
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,880
Shall we get them engaged?
Then they can live together.

1336
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,320
We'll try to understand them,
they will try to understand us.

1337
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,320
How do you do it, Manju?

1338
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,000
Fine, let's get them engaged.

1339
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,120
And when they are sure that
they can tolerate each other

1340
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,440
and won't run away,
then we'll get them married.

1341
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,360
Cheers.

1342
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,880
Cheers, Atul.

1343
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,080
Welcome. Welcome.

1344
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,040
Good morning.

1345
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,520
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1346
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,280
Dad, Atul just gave
me a fantastic idea.

1347
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,040
Let's get them engaged,
and then they can live together.

1348
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,320
If you guys don't
have a problem with it.

1349
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,800
Atul, we're too old
to understand any of this.

1350
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,040
But we trust her.

1351
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,400
What are you doing?

1352
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,840
Just making breakfast.

1353
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,440
Thought I should eat something
healthy for a change.

1354
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,520
Why are you cooking?

1355
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,880
She wants to eat something healthy.

1356
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,400
Because she's been eating
unhealthy food for two days now.

1357
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,840
What are you going to eat?

1358
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,640
Are you in the mood
for something healthy too

1359
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,360
or will you eat what we are eating?

1360
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,800
Whatever everyone's eating.
What's for breakfast?

1361
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,360
Lentils stuffed 'Parathas'.

1362
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,160
She's intentionally
trying to mess with me

1363
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,120
I am telling you.

1364
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,480
No, she isn't.

1365
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,880
What did you tell her?

1366
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,040
Oh..

1367
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,400
So now you want to
know what I said to her.

1368
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,200
No. - I am telling you she's
trying to mess with me

1369
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,560
and now you stay out of it.

1370
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,000
Well, there's nothing much
you can do.

1371
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,320
Go ahead and stuff
your face with lentils.

1372
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,480
But if she takes a jab at me again,
I will show her.

1373
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:01,440
"I met her on the way."

1374
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,200
"I met her on the way."

1375
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,920
"What I was afraid of,
has happened."

1376
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,600
"You, with the crooked hat.."

1377
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,440
"You, innocent man.."

1378
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,240
"You, with the crooked hat.."

1379
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,440
"You, innocent man.."

1380
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,240
They don't make such songs anymore.

1381
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,160
Like the ones in our generation.

1382
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,360
Which generation?

1383
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,280
There are three generations here.

1384
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,000
Mom and dad's.

1385
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,600
Yours and mine.

1386
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,680
And then the kids like Ishika,
Ishaan and Ayesha's.

1387
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,240
Which generation
are you talking about?

1388
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,840
You know, Ayesha, we were still
in college when this song came out.

1389
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,320
Ashu used to hear it on repeat.

1390
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,560
I am sure you weren't
even born back then.

1391
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,080
I've heard this song on
Retro Special.

1392
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,800
But seriously, were you really
in college when this song came out?

1393
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,480
Are you that old?

1394
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,680
How old are you?

1395
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,040
She doesn't look a day older
than 35.

1396
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,440
47.

1397
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,080
She does.

1398
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,360
26.

1399
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,400
Ayesha is 26.

1400
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,560
I found out.

1401
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:48,960
Good night.

1402
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,240
Weren't you only 20 years old
when you met mom?

1403
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,040
Grandpa got married
at the age of 19.

1404
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,880
Any career plans yet?

1405
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,600
I look after the resort.

1406
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,880
And now I am thinking
of settling down.

1407
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,880
Thank you, Dad.

1408
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,480
I knew you wouldn't show up empty
handed after my 21st birthday.

1409
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,720
Dad?

1410
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,800
This is still here?

1411
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,560
Yes.

1412
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,320
I take it out for a spin sometimes.

1413
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Does it still work?

1414
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,840
Smooth as ever.

1415
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,560
Our first car.

1416
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,240
Let's go for a drive.

1417
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,240
Come.

1418
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,200
Let's go.

1419
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,720
Whatever one might say,
nothing beats your first car.

1420
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,800
You feel so comfortable driving it.

1421
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,840
You know, Ayesha

1422
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,800
we bought this car on our wedding.

1423
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,400
It's been so many years, but
it still runs like it always did.

1424
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,560
Right, Ashu?
- Yes.

1425
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,360
They really built them well
back then.

1426
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,600
Right?

1427
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,400
Durable, reliable, faithful.

1428
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,840
Right, Ashu?
- Yes.

1429
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,720
And still stable as ever.

1430
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,680
See.

1431
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,560
Yes, but one needs to
upgrade from time to time.

1432
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,480
Nostalgia is one thing

1433
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,400
but the features grow
old over a period of time.

1434
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,040
The body grows old,
doesn't look attractive anymore

1435
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,880
the engine rusts.

1436
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,680
And it cannot be compared with
the comfort, joy

1437
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,160
and excitement of the new one.

1438
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,760
And on top of that, the old
ones need extra maintenance.

1439
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,760
And the new one
comes with a warranty.

1440
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,200
Right, Ashu sir?

1441
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,800
We did buy a new one.

1442
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,880
Worked fine for a year.

1443
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,200
But then something or the
other needed to be repaired.

1444
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,760
We spent a fortune
on its maintenance.

1445
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,440
Let's just say, the money
we spent on that car in one year

1446
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,840
was more than what we have spent
on this one till now.

1447
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,960
Right, Ashu?

1448
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,480
No..

1449
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,760
I mean, yes.

1450
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,120
Old has its own place.

1451
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,320
And the new has its own
advantages.

1452
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,560
What advantages?

1453
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,240
Better suspension.

1454
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,520
Better looks.

1455
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,680
And better safety.

1456
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,000
No, you can't beat the
old in terms of safety.

1457
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,520
Back then we had no such thing as
airbags, but it still kept us safe.

1458
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,560
Us, the kids.

1459
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,160
Most importantly,
it has never broken down midway.

1460
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,840
Right, Ashu?

1461
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,080
What's wrong, Manju?

1462
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,880
Did you sprain your back?

1463
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,760
Why don't you let Ashu sir
give you a massage?

1464
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,640
He's really good.

1465
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,680
Ashu, will you give me a massage?

1466
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,880
Sure.

1467
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,040
Let's go.

1468
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,160
You are really good.

1469
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,480
Where did you learn?

1470
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,360
Dated a masseuse for a while.

1471
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,240
So, is it a part of
every employee's package?

1472
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,320
How much do you commit every month?

1473
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,960
One massage a month,
or two, or maybe only on weekends.

1474
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,040
Or is it only reserved
for the young..

1475
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,480
Manju, we were travelling
and she got hurt.

1476
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,440
That's it.

1477
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,600
A little more to the left.

1478
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,960
Ashu, a little below.

1479
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,840
Yes.

1480
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,080
Here?
- Yes, there.

1481
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,120
Don't be shy, Ashu.

1482
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,640
Nothing you haven't touched before.

1483
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,760
I know, I am not being shy.

1484
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,040
Oh, wow!

1485
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,480
Thanks, Ayesha.
- Welcome.

1486
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,800
Doesn't matter what Ishika says,
but I love you, Dad.

1487
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,160
I love you too.

1488
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,440
Dad, I need to talk to you.

1489
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,400
No.

1490
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,160
I never asked you for anything,
just this once.

1491
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,240
No.

1492
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,600
I am in love with Ayesha.

1493
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,840
No.

1494
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,080
Wow, Dad, this feels so good.

1495
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,560
I love Ayesha.

1496
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,000
Not possible.

1497
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,040
But why?

1498
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,720
Because she is my employee,
and it's against company rules.

1499
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,080
But after she says yes,
she will settle down in India.

1500
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:34,920
End of problem.

1501
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,160
Not possible.

1502
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,720
I know, five years age
difference is too much..

1503
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,160
It's not about the age difference.

1504
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,960
What are you saying, Dad?

1505
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,560
It's important for age difference
to be minimal in a relationship.

1506
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,120
Otherwise,
things only get complicated.

1507
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,840
What gets complicated?

1508
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,320
How does age difference matter?

1509
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,160
Love is important.

1510
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,880
Micheal Douglas and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

1511
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,240
George Clooney and his wife.

1512
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,440
Saif and Kareena.

1513
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,520
So you admit it's possible.

1514
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,440
I said it's not possible.

1515
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,360
Ishika is right.

1516
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,080
You don't deserve
to be called a father.

1517
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,160
You..

1518
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,840
I didn't know
you were also into bikes..

1519
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,000
What's going on?

1520
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,960
'Rakhi'.

1521
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,440
Manju, are you ready
with your platter?

1522
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,000
Aren't you going to
tie a 'Rakhi' to your brother?

1523
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,280
'Rakhi' is only for the kids.

1524
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,520
Not for..
- You are being too modern.

1525
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,120
This festival is the
foundation of sibling love.

1526
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,480
And since you're here,
why not go ahead with it!

1527
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,040
This is why he's here.

1528
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,480
I told you he gave her a surprise.

1529
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,160
This is how he surprised her.

1530
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,720
Manju, set up the platter.

1531
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,080
Sibling love doesn't
need the seal of 'Rakhi'.

1532
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,160
We..
- Shut up!

1533
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,760
I said shut up!

1534
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,960
Stop this nonsense.

1535
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,560
And go get the gift
you brought for Manju.

1536
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,160
The gift can be given later, Dad.

1537
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,840
And I'll use Ishika's platter.

1538
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,440
Ishika, you and Ishaan go first.

1539
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,880
Good idea.

1540
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,120
We are committing a sin.

1541
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,120
Let her tie it.

1542
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,720
Doesn't make a difference to us.

1543
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
Because if he doesn't,
then Atul will wonder

1544
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,560
why the brother isn't
letting his sister tie the 'Rakhi'.

1545
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,040
The mother will tie 'Rakhi' to
her husband in front of the kids?

1546
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,080
Come, Manju.

1547
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,200
Wait a minute.

1548
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,840
Hasmukh. Go and fetch
my guitar right away.

1549
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:29,800
Of course.

1550
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,440
Let's set the mood.

1551
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,280
He's celebrating 'Rakhi'
after all these years.

1552
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,800
It's a big day.

1553
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,960
It's wrong. It's just wrong.

1554
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,160
That was the last 'Rakhi'.

1555
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,120
We bought only one.

1556
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,160
Only one?

1557
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,160
Anyway, Manju, our love
doesn't depend on some thread.

1558
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,080
What emotion! Wow!

1559
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,480
But don't worry.
I am there.

1560
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,160
Do you carry 'Rakhis'
in your pocket?

1561
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,240
Such opportunities come
only once in a lifetime, ma'am.

1562
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,480
The other hand.

1563
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,400
The right one, not the left.

1564
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:49,240
"Even the sun, moon, and stars say"

1565
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,640
"my sister's one-in-a-million."

1566
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:02,400
"We're going to stay
together forever and ever."

1567
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,840
"Even the sun, moon,
and stars say.."

1568
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,440
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1569
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,480
Great weather, fresh air, sunlight

1570
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,080
we're on a picnic here,
aren't we, sir?

1571
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,160
Let's go check the prices
of potatoes and onion.

1572
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,080
Oh! Sir, fresh tomatoes.

1573
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,920
Can I buy a dozen of them?
I'll make some juice for you.

1574
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,040
Great for health.
- Stop it, Ayesha.

1575
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,080
At least tell me what's wrong.

1576
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,720
Well, for starters,
I became your secretary.

1577
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,440
Without me realizing, I got into
a competition with your ex-wife

1578
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,440
about who knows Ashish better.

1579
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,880
All this while I thought you wanted
to introduce me to your family

1580
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,240
when actually you
wanted their approval.

1581
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,520
Ayesha, I didn't know that
Ishika is getting married.

1582
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,800
I'll sort things out
as soon as they leave.

1583
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,520
No way you'll sort things out.

1584
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,280
You let your children's
mother tie you a 'Rakhi'.

1585
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,160
And you still claim
you'll sort things out.

1586
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:13,960
"My dad says
I'll achieve something in life."

1587
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,960
"That his son will be successful."

1588
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:27,720
"But no one knows where
my destiny will lead me."

1589
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,440
Let it be, dear. She will manage.

1590
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,160
Uncle, mom's calling you.

1591
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:48,160
Atul, I've tasted potatoes
all over the world, but

1592
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,320
nothing like Manju's potatoes.

1593
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,080
Only organic is good.

1594
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,920
Seriously, Manju

1595
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,880
thank you for
making me a better man.

1596
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,560
"You have made me complete"

1597
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,040
"otherwise I would've
always remained incomplete."

1598
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,920
"While walking amongst the crowd"

1599
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,520
"I would've sailed down
a different path altogether."

1600
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,520
"I would've been incomplete."

1601
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,880
Wow! On which truck
did you read that?

1602
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,840
Brother..

1603
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,920
Manju, your brother is here?

1604
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,960
You were going to take
me for the local wine tasting.

1605
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,920
Let's go.

1606
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,040
Let's avoid it in front
of the kids.

1607
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,640
They are at an impressionable age,
especially her son.

1608
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,880
I know that all of us drink.

1609
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,480
In fact, I personally offered
Rishi his first beer.

1610
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,840
So that he's aware of the
effects when he's drinking outside.

1611
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,520
He's their uncle,
he won't understand.

1612
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,320
They meet only once a year.

1613
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,800
The parents have to take
care of them all the while.

1614
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,840
Absolutely.

1615
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,280
Those who come over once in a while

1616
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,360
won't know a thing about
children's responsibility.

1617
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,480
Right?

1618
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:11,920
I'll be right back.

1619
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,680
You embarrassed him.

1620
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,240
Yes, I'm the one who embarrassed.

1621
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,040
The distillery guys called.

1622
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,320
Can we discuss the points?
- Yes. They're on my phone.

1623
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,200
We can discuss it now.

1624
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,560
Come on.

1625
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,960
Tell me honestly how important
Manju's approval is for you.

1626
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,120
I am not looking for her approval.

1627
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,680
I just want you to get
to know her and the kids.

1628
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,560
Kids.

1629
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,520
These kids?

1630
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,000
Ishika looks like my older sister.

1631
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,120
And that Ishaan..

1632
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,040
Do you know what
Ishaan was saying to me?

1633
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,120
'Your name ends at 'Isha'
and mine begins with it.'

1634
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,960
'If we add an 'L', it will become
'Alishaan' (grand).'

1635
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,360
Go ahead.

1636
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,640
What do I say to him?

1637
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,960
'Dear, I am here to become
your mom and not your wife.'

1638
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,520
Ishika doesn't look older than you.

1639
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,960
I love you!

1640
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:35,000
"O sweetheart, your
eyes are miniature."

1641
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:39,600
"Just two sips were enough
to raise my temperature."

1642
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,400
"O sweetheart, your
eyes are miniature."

1643
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:44,760
"Just two sips were enough
to raise my temperature."

1644
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,000
"You got me all high."

1645
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,600
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight.."

1646
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:59,520
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1647
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:04,400
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1648
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:09,320
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1649
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,520
"Stop bragging like this."

1650
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:28,240
"All the heroes of
Bollywood hit on me."

1651
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,000
"When I move my waist"

1652
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,560
"it's a treat for many eyes."

1653
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,880
"When I move my waist"

1654
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,280
"it's a treat for many eyes."

1655
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:43,000
"You should thank Lord that such
a great guy's crazy about you."

1656
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,640
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight.."

1657
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:53,480
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1658
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:58,360
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1659
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,480
"But your very sight.."

1660
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,800
"But your very sight.."

1661
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,400
"But your very sight.."

1662
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,960
"But your very sight.."

1663
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:12,680
"Every night you call me"

1664
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,720
"and say you've brought a ring."

1665
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,320
"Every night you call me"

1666
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,560
"and say you've brought a ring."

1667
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:27,640
"He had to say no,
but he said yes to me."

1668
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:32,560
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1669
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:37,120
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1670
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:42,400
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1671
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:46,960
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."

1672
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,800
"But your very sight.."

1673
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:56,760
"But your very sight.."

1674
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,720
Ishika, calm down.

1675
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,240
I will not calm down.
Do not ask me to calm down.

1676
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,600
Ask this man to leave.

1677
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,080
Come inside. Let's go inside and..

1678
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,560
This man is a liar.

1679
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,960
He lied when he said he
will always be there for me.

1680
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,480
He lied when he left
and said nothing will change.

1681
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,080
'Everything will be fine.
I will make everything right.'

1682
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,480
And he's still lying.

1683
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,400
She is not his secretary.

1684
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,800
And even if she is, then
these two are having an affair.

1685
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,680
She is not my secretary.

1686
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,040
I came here to introduce
her to all of you.

1687
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,400
But my intentions..
- Please don't say anything.

1688
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,400
I beg of you.

1689
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,840
You are a liar!
And I will not be a liar like you!

1690
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,560
I won't lie.

1691
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:47,200
You don't lie to your kin.
You don't cheat on them.

1692
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,680
Regardless of how good
your intentions are.

1693
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,640
Rishi, he's not my uncle.

1694
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:56,960
He's my father.

1695
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,480
My parents separated
when I was young.

1696
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,680
I kept lying to you because
honestly, he was dead to me.

1697
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,240
And when he suddenly showed up

1698
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,520
I was scared to tell you the truth.

1699
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,320
I am sorry.

1700
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
Manju, I was beginning
to respect you.

1701
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,680
So I won't say much.

1702
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,280
And there isn't much to say.

1703
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,280
But this won't be possible for me.

1704
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,560
I can't get into the details, but
this doesn't seem right for Rishi.

1705
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,560
Rishi, I am waiting in the car.

1706
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,720
Pintu.

1707
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,960
Keep her luggage in the cottage.

1708
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,680
Why did you come
here in the first place?

1709
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,800
Why?

1710
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,080
She is as old as Ishika.

1711
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,960
Don't you feel ashamed?

1712
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:44,560
What did you think?

1713
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,560
You will drop in unannounced

1714
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,920
introduce your girlfriend
as your secretary

1715
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,560
we will start liking her
and tell you to marry her?

1716
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,360
Why can't you ever do
anything right?

1717
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,040
I told you to send him back.

1718
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,960
I told you he shouldn't be here,
but you never listen.

1719
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,920
Will you just shut up?

1720
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,120
You two broke up
because of your lie.

1721
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,560
Not because of him.

1722
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,360
And we broke up because of us,
not just him.

1723
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,920
When we separated,
you had to choose between one of us

1724
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,360
so that you could
justify our separation.

1725
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,600
And maybe I was really happy that
you all thought he was wrong

1726
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,960
and chose me over him.

1727
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,600
But when two people separate

1728
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:41,080
only they know why
they are separating.

1729
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,760
And why is divorce
such a big issue?

1730
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,120
Rather than dragging a relationship
all your life, blaming each other

1731
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,720
it's better to separate.

1732
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,480
And try a new life.

1733
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,560
Did he share a bond only with you?

1734
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,840
What about us?

1735
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,720
When did he leave us, Dad?

1736
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,480
You chose me.
He didn't even try to fight it.

1737
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,960
And he brought Ayesha
here because he still cares.

1738
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,680
He could've just sent a picture
saying this is my new wife.

1739
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,600
And as for the kids

1740
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:20,640
kids inherit their parents'
property, money, status.

1741
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,720
Similarly, they inherit
their broken relationships.

1742
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:28,960
If they reap the rewards
of our right decisions

1743
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,680
then they will have
to tolerate our mistakes as well.

1744
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:34,040
All I know is, at the age
of getting his daughter married

1745
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,560
he's marrying
someone who's as old as..

1746
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,800
You wouldn't have
minded if she was my age?

1747
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,680
Weren't married couples
10 to 15 years apart in your time?

1748
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,560
In fact, some couples
would even be 25 years apart.

1749
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,600
Back then girls had no option.

1750
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,320
But they both want to be together.

1751
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,200
Frankly, all this is pointless.

1752
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,720
This is his life. And he can live
it the way he wants to.

1753
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,360
We need to stop blaming
him for everything.

1754
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,480
He isn't responsible
for this broken relationship

1755
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:10,360
nor was he for ours!

1756
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,240
I wanted to say something.

1757
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,320
Please don't get me wrong.

1758
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:01,200
Rather than starting a new life

1759
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
maybe it's time
you complete this one.

1760
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,160
And trust me

1761
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,720
if you feel for even a moment
that this is what you want to do

1762
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,120
and this is where you want to be

1763
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,080
then I'll understand.

1764
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:24,560
Get some sleep.

1765
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,240
I'll go and meet Manju.

1766
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,880
Thank you.

1767
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,240
I didn't come here to..
- I know.

1768
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,880
I am sorry.

1769
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,480
I am tired.

1770
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,280
I am tired

1771
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,320
of always being
the responsible one.

1772
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,600
Why should I always
be the sensible one?

1773
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,640
Why should I
understand every time?

1774
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:25,520
For once,
I want to not care about anyone!

1775
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,280
For once..

1776
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:44,840
All I want is one day when
I don't have to worry about anyone.

1777
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,560
Why can't..

1778
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,000
Why can't I just be?

1779
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,760
Shit.

1780
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:26,080
I am tired, Ashu.

1781
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,200
I know.

1782
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,960
Don't worry.

1783
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,760
Don't tell her.

1784
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,480
She won't be able to understand.

1785
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,000
You didn't come back last night.

1786
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,200
I sat down to talk to Manju.

1787
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,760
Is she fine?

1788
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,720
What's wrong?

1789
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:35,960
Last night

1790
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,880
Manju and I..

1791
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,400
We slept together.

1792
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,160
Slept together,
as in on the same bed?

1793
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,400
Ayesha, what are you doing?

1794
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,120
I should leave.

1795
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:07,680
I told you, if you
want to stay with Manju..

1796
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,240
It isn't that.

1797
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,080
It didn't mean anything.

1798
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,920
We are not getting back together.

1799
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,800
What do you mean?

1800
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,240
I mean, it just happened.

1801
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:20,240
It didn't mean anything.

1802
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,680
If you don't want to get back to
her, then why are you telling me?

1803
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,320
What?

1804
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,320
I mean, what did you want
to achieve by telling me?

1805
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,560
What am I going to
do with this information?

1806
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,400
You shouldn't have told me.

1807
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,200
What are you saying, Ayesha?

1808
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:37,160
We're going to get married.

1809
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:38,680
I think you deserve to know.

1810
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,080
I deserve to know.

1811
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,320
I deserve to know.

1812
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,080
You know what I deserve?

1813
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,840
I deserve that you shouldn't
have slept with her.

1814
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,760
I told you not to tell her.

1815
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,440
Manju, we're solving this.

1816
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,960
Wow, she said don't tell me.

1817
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,160
Nice.

1818
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,720
So you two even discussed
whether to tell me or not.

1819
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:57,960
We didn't discuss anything.

1820
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,200
She just said..
- Said what?

1821
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,360
Don't tell her,
she won't understand.

1822
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,000
Yes, how would I understand?

1823
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:05,800
Because you two are the
only sensible people around.

1824
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,960
You do understand, then?

1825
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,480
Of course, I do.

1826
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:12,440
What did you understand?
- Manju, why don't you understand?

1827
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,640
Don't over-react.

1828
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:16,960
It just happened.

1829
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,240
And it didn't happen
for the first time.

1830
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,000
It's happened thousands of times.

1831
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:22,800
How do you think
these kids were born?

1832
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,520
Seriously?

1833
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,240
Is she crazy?

1834
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,440
What is she saying?

1835
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,720
If you were in my shoes and he had
cheated on you with another woman

1836
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,640
would you have explained
the same thing to yourself?

1837
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,920
He didn't cheat.

1838
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,400
Technically,
you are the other woman.

1839
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,520
I am still his wife.
We are not divorced.

1840
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,560
You told me you are divorced.

1841
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:45,920
I told you we are separated.

1842
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,640
Not divorced?
- I mean, actually

1843
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,520
I also just realized that.

1844
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,840
We never felt the need,
so we never signed the papers.

1845
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,880
And since it's been so long,
the thought never crossed my mind.

1846
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,960
And I swear, nothing has happened
between us in the last 15 years.

1847
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,520
Honestly, it's just a technicality.

1848
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,360
So technically,
you are still married

1849
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,200
and last night
you slept with your wife.

1850
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,520
And I am the other woman.

1851
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,680
Lovely.

1852
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,320
Ayesha..
- Please shut up.

1853
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,360
You are older, and everyone made
me feel I am much younger to you.

1854
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,200
But I never felt it around you.

1855
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,520
But today you made me feel
smaller than

1856
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,600
I've ever felt in my life.

1857
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:36,000
I feel I am just a small
anecdote in your life

1858
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:38,240
who mistook herself to be a story.

1859
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:12,320
"You are not a part of my life"

1860
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:17,480
"and I don't know why."

1861
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:22,160
"You are not a part of my life"

1862
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:26,960
"and I don't know why."

1863
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,520
"All I know is I'm your wrong"

1864
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,800
"and you are my right."

1865
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:39,560
"Without you,
life's full of sorrows"

1866
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,000
"life feels burdened."

1867
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:47,080
"You seem to be fading
away from my life more than ever."

1868
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:52,000
"My heart's weeping"

1869
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:56,480
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."

1870
01:55:56,640 --> 01:56:01,680
"My heart's weeping"

1871
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,240
"drowned in your memories."

1872
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,960
"Life without you moves on"

1873
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:44,800
"but I don't feel alive anymore."

1874
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:50,200
"Two hearts that agree, but"

1875
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,320
"destiny is against us."

1876
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:58,360
"Life without you moves on"

1877
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:04,960
"but I don't feel alive anymore."

1878
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:10,120
"Two hearts that agree, but"

1879
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:14,120
"destiny is against us."

1880
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:18,800
"The tears of love
convey our story."

1881
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,400
"Everyone sinks close to the shore"

1882
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,840
"but some make it across."

1883
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:28,960
"My heart's weeping"

1884
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:33,520
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."

1885
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:38,280
"My heart's weeping"

1886
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,120
"drowned in your memories."

1887
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,480
I know I am not a good father.

1888
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:39,080
I don't know if what
I did was right or wrong.

1889
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,520
I don't know whether it's true
or false.

1890
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,720
But I do know that
my daughter is crying.

1891
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,360
I can either do it the easy way

1892
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,560
or the hard way.

1893
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:28,640
"Your daughter yearns for"

1894
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,960
"your finger and your arms."

1895
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:39,800
"Your daughter yearns for"

1896
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:44,000
"your shoulders to sit on."

1897
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:51,080
"Resting her head on your chest,
swinging in your arms"

1898
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,520
"your tickling.."

1899
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:02,040
"Your daughter yearns"

1900
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:06,480
"to hold your hands."

1901
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:11,680
"Your daughter yearns.."

1902
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:17,760
"Your daughter yearns.."

1903
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,840
Thank you.

1904
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,200
Don't be crazy.

1905
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,760
She is my daughter too.

1906
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:40,320
My entire life will
be spent in thanking you.

1907
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:42,760
That's true.

1908
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,400
Do you miss her?

1909
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:53,520
I am not some 16-year-old
to miss her.

1910
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,360
No, you're not. Still
you're standing here like this.

1911
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,640
Hence, I am asking.

1912
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:07,520
Yes, I do miss her.

1913
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:15,960
You do know that 10 years later
she will still be young

1914
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,520
and you won't be in
a position to do anything.

1915
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:23,480
And she won't have any option
other than cheating on you.

1916
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,600
You..

1917
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:34,640
"When you're not my companion"

1918
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,360
"the paths are filled
with hurdles."

1919
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:42,240
"Without you, even peace
and sleep have abandoned me."

1920
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:47,120
"I don't know how these
rifts crept up between us."

1921
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:51,280
"Without you,
my heart feels empty."

1922
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,800
"Without you,
life's full of sorrows"

1923
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,280
"life feels burdened."

1924
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,080
"You seem to be fading
away from my life more than ever."

1925
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:05,800
"My heart's weeping"

1926
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:10,680
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."

1927
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,520
"My heart's weeping"

1928
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,200
"drowned in your memories."

1929
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:25,360
"My heart's weeping"

1930
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,680
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."

1931
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:35,080
"My heart's weeping."

1932
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:39,960
"My heart's weeping."

1933
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:55,240
Sorry, the bar is closed.

1934
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,920
I am the mother of his children.

1935
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,000
He loves me a lot.

1936
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,600
Not in the same way he loves you.

1937
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:39,080
But he loves me to the extent
that he couldn't say no that day.

1938
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:46,800
He wasn't cheating on you.

1939
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,480
He was only supporting me.

1940
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,640
He didn't become weak
in my weak moment.

1941
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,000
Maybe because of
the guilt of leaving me

1942
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,680
he couldn't walk out on me again.

1943
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:16,360
Just understand that he
had a responsibility towards me

1944
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,200
which he has now fulfilled.

1945
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:30,160
I've started the divorce process.

1946
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:41,320
He is still yours.

1947
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,920
You just have to believe it.

1948
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:53,640
I know it's hard to accept, but..

1949
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,360
Is sleeping together
once enough to fall in love?

1950
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,960
Then how can it be
enough to fall out of it?

1951
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,320
Have you two taken a pledge that

1952
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,200
at any given point of time, only
one of you will act responsibly?

1953
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:28,360
Where is mom?

1954
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,960
Ishika, she said that
she's just going away for a day

1955
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,960
and that I should
take care of things.

1956
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,280
Now, if she's going
away only for a day

1957
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,600
why would I ask where and why?

1958
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,760
I can't wait.
I am getting on with my engagement.

1959
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,120
You're so selfish.

1960
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:39,000
Won't you wait for
the mother who raised you?

1961
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,200
I am selfish.

1962
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:41,160
Ishika..

1963
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,280
You have no shame at all, do you?

1964
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,200
You sent your ex-wife
to convince me?

1965
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,280
We aren't divorced yet.

1966
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,880
Why did you call me back?

1967
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:46,600
I am ready to do
everything all over again.

1968
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,440
Visit the same places again.

1969
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,240
Make the same mistakes again.
Have the same arguments again.

1970
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:57,800
Even convince you again.

1971
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:00,000
Choose our song again.

1972
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:02,960
Think of a pet name again.

1973
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,920
Tell the same lies again.

1974
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,280
Endure every taunt again.

1975
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,800
Laugh on the same jokes again.

1976
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:13,640
Cry for the same sorrows again.

1977
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,640
Without you,
life already feels lived and stale.

1978
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,920
Let me live once again.

1979
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:23,200
With you.

1980
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:32,800
I know
it's a very emotional moment.

1981
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,280
And that was a great dialogue.
But please, let's go.

1982
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,680
You too. I mean, please get ready.

1983
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,360
But I don't have any clothes.

1984
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,080
I'll lend you mine. Wear those.

1985
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:58,480
Cheers!

1986
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:00,360
Look, your new mother.

1987
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:06,800
How are you going
to look at her now?

1988
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,720
How will you live now?

1989
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:11,160
Grandpa, stop ragging me.
- I am not ragging you.

1990
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,360
Your own father..

1991
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,280
You got what you wanted.

1992
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:26,200
Now put in a good word for me too.

1993
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,400
I can't help you.

1994
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:29,720
Keep trying.

1995
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:30,880
Now?

1996
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,520
Manju, how do you manage all this?

1997
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,480
Atul..

1998
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:51,680
Your competition.

1999
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:56,800
Finally, everything is sorted.

2000
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,560
So when do you want to do it?

2001
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,280
What do you mean?

2002
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:01,560
Do I look like an orphan?

2003
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,200
Don't I have a family?

2004
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,280
Seeing the mess here,
I am scared to even think

2005
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,280
what will happen at my place.

2006
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:07,360
What?

2007
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,360
I mean I'll have to
introduce you to them.

2008
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:17,080
I am not coming. - You'll have to
come over to my house.

2009
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:18,200
Why not?
- Your family is crazy.

2010
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:19,560
How can I?
- My family is crazy?

2011
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:21,120
Didn't I come all the way here?
- Never..

2012
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,520
Isn't your family crazy?
- My family's so nice..

2013
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,560
What are you saying?
Your son was hitting on me.

2014
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:26,280
Forget it..
- I did so much.

2015
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,640
"I want to hear you!"

2016
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:10,280
"I'm a bad girl and
I am a little naughty."

2017
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,680
"I am the life of every party."

2018
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,200
"I don't shy away from anything"

2019
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,400
"and today I've
had a little Bacardi."

2020
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:20,200
"I'm all decked up for you today."

2021
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,720
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."

2022
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,760
"Beware, boy"

2023
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:27,800
"as my moves light up the party."

2024
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:30,280
"Slowly-Slowly.."

2025
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:32,520
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2026
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:35,400
"and don't sprain your waist."

2027
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,560
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2028
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:40,400
"and don't sprain your waist."

2029
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,640
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2030
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,440
don't sprain your waist."

2031
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,520
"Yes, baby."

2032
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:58,400
"When you sway your
waist up and down"

2033
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,920
"my heart skips a beat."

2034
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,480
"Through your eyes,
you say yes, no, maybe."

2035
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:05,640
"But I know your heart's
reserved for me."

2036
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:08,240
"You dance at the club so
graciously"

2037
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,640
"I can't take my eyes off you."

2038
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,240
"When you wear red bangles
with your red dress"

2039
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,560
"the boys lose their heart."

2040
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:18,280
"I'm all decked up for you today."

2041
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:20,880
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."

2042
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,920
"Beware, boy"

2043
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,880
"as my moves light up the party."

2044
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:28,320
"Slowly-Slowly.."

2045
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,640
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2046
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:33,240
"and don't sprain your waist."

2047
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,680
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2048
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,440
"and don't sprain your waist."

2049
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,800
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2050
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,480
"don't sprain your waist"

2051
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,640
"Yes, baby."

2052
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,520
"I'm a bad girl and
I am a little naughty."

2053
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:59,000
"I am the life of every party."

2054
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:01,440
"I don't shy away from anything"

2055
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,600
"and today I've
had a little Bacardi."

2056
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:06,280
"I'm all decked up for you today."

2057
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,840
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."

2058
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:10,920
"Beware, boy"

2059
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,880
"as my moves light up the party."

2060
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:16,080
"Slowly-Slowly.."

2061
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,640
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2062
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:21,480
"and don't sprain your waist."

2063
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,680
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2064
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,520
"and don't sprain your waist."

2065
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,800
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

2066
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:30,640
"don't sprain your waist."

2067
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:31,840
"Yes, baby."
