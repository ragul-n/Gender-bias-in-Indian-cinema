3
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,400
Shamu!

4
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,490
Shamu!

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,306
Coming, ma'am! Coming!

6
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,610
'Coming, coming.'

7
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,190
I've been calling
out 'Shamu' all day long.

8
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,640
Can't you hear?

9
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,716
You've lost your head just
because you're getting married.

10
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,120
Can't you see?

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,930
I was changing, mother.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,476
Change your clothes?

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,440
It is so bright and
there's so much to be done.

14
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,090
When will you arrive at your in-laws?
At midnight.

15
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,140
The cart isn't even ready yet.
The cattle haven't been fed.

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,986
Even the cushion hasn't
been laid out in the cart.

17
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,080
Who will do it if not you?

18
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,100
Do we have servants on call?

19
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,110
What are you still waiting for?

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,890
Get moving or I'll smack
you in front of the guests.

21
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,220
Mr. Raghunath, let's see
whose cattle win at your in-laws.

22
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,270
Who won at Shankar's wedding?

23
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,940
Never mind that.
My Dulari was unwell that time.

24
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,720
A bad worker blames his tools.

25
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,740
Hey!

26
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,666
I came in first.

27
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,296
How could you be first?
We won. I say so.

28
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,050
Who cares what you say?
Everyone saw who won.

29
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,220
Tell us Bhola,
whose cattle came first?

30
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,540
Why are the two of you fighting?

31
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,260
Both of them will be fed. Happy?

32
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,270
He isn't going to feed them.
He's stingy.

33
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,770
Where is my Shamu's cart.
Take a look.

34
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,370
Feed them. Feed them.

35
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,590
He won't feed them.
He's come here to get married.

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
He is extremely miserly.

37
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,130
Wedding chants

38
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:49,030
Why do you tarry, guests?

39
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,270
You are going to
your darling's town

40
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,980
The path is treacherous

41
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,500
Lest we be late

42
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,880
Why do you tarry?

43
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,190
Why do you tarry, guests?

44
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,650
Why?

45
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,610
They showed great courage
getting her married.

46
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,150
Why wouldn't they?
They have only one daughter.

47
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,060
They gave her plenty
of jewelry as well.

48
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,950
Bracelets, bangles, armlets,
anklets, etcetera.

49
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,300
I don't care about that stuff.

50
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,140
I could never pay it all back.

51
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,980
I liked the girl.

52
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,490
It would be acceptable to me...

53
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,780
even if they didn't give her anything.

54
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,540
But aunty,
even you showed generosity.

55
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,680
What do you mean?
Wouldn't she get her son married?

56
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,546
Of course she'd get him married...

57
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,130
but to do so during
such times is a big deal.

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,930
And she mortgaged her land.

59
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,040
Oh really? Who told you that?

60
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,370
To whom did I mortgage the land?

61
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,340
How would I know, aunt?

62
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,730
The villagers are saying
you mortgaged the land...

63
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,790
to Sukhi Lala.

64
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,690
'Sukhi Lala!'
Let him say it to my face.

65
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,950
I'll break all his teeth.

66
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,010
As though aunt Sundar has nothing.

67
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,560
She was begging.

68
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,480
'Mortgaged the land.
Mortgaged the land.'

69
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,920
Yes, it is true.

70
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,640
I mortgaged and repossessed
the land several times.

71
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,400
Lord knows whether I will
be able to repossess it now?

72
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,290
If it is in my fate,
I'll get it back.

73
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,720
If not, then I won't
be able to get it back.

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,490
God...

75
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,490
please uphold my honor.

76
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,460
Hope has appeared in my life

77
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,820
Cool winds blowing
and flowers abloom

78
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,170
I am the garland
around my darling's neck

79
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,200
It is the spring of my life

80
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:49,230
Listen to me, bird.
The cuckoo calls

81
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:55,676
Listen to me, bird.
The gardens are abuzz

82
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,620
These are the tales of leaves

83
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,830
Garlands here are
made from flower gems

84
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,230
Listen to me, bird.
The cuckoo calls

85
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,700
Water has been
showered onto my fields

86
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,590
My eyes are wounded
and my heart is stabbed

87
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,490
Your beloved is working for you

88
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,550
My eyes are wounded
and my heart is stabbed

89
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:03,770
Listen to me, bird.
The cuckoo calls

90
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,010
I won't say it but
my darling is unique

91
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,440
My darling is unique.
My lord is unique

92
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,630
I won't say it but
my darling is unique

93
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,350
Don't go to the fields
in the afternoon, my darling

94
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,230
If it is sunny my
darling will feel thirsty

95
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,660
I won't say it but
my darling is unique

96
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,770
My darling is unique.
My lord is unique

97
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,630
I won't say it but
my darling is unique

98
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,040
Walk slowly or the water
might spill out of your pot.

99
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,200
Careful you don't
sprain your slim waist.

100
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,760
You are jesting today.
What's the reason?

101
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,290
It's not my time to jest.
This is your time to do that.

102
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,950
The more you work and
the more you move about...

103
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,570
the better it is for you.

104
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,600
Of course.
I know how knowledgeable you are.

105
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,250
Only you know these things,
others know nothing.

106
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,820
Let's go.

107
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,070
Hey Shamu, is your lunch here?

108
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,340
No, it must be on the way.

109
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,320
Bansi, God should bestow
every man with a wife like yours.

110
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,450
She's so pretty and so capable.

111
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,300
And in the very first year...

112
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,040
- Do you have good news?
- Yes.

113
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,490
Bravo, tiger! Bravo!

114
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,720
It's simple logic.

115
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,310
The more fertile the land,
the faster the tree will grow.

116
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,756
Yes, that's right.

117
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,730
But Shamu, our land is so barren.

118
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,490
It's been five years
but no hope yet.

119
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,090
You're talking like a failure.

120
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
You should never despair.

121
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,090
It had better be a boy.

122
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,470
That's not in our hands.

123
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,686
I don't want any excuses.

124
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,410
If it's a girl
I'll strangle someone.

125
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,890
Me or the baby?

126
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,076
The girl?

127
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,010
Oh lord!
That would be murder.

128
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,306
Whatever.

129
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,160
And what will you do if it's a boy?

130
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,970
You'll make a nose ring?

131
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes.

132
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,390
It'll be a boy. I know it.

133
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,740
How?

134
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,780
The moment I stepped out
of the house this morning...

135
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,880
I was confronted by a man.
It'll be a boy.

136
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,780
Is that so?

137
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,670
Radha still has six months to go.

138
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,270
There would be.

139
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,260
- But you should be ashamed of yourself.
- Why?

140
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,560
- It's been five years since we got married and...
- Okay, okay, let it be.

141
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,310
We've had nothing.

142
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,650
How is it my fault? It's god's wish.

143
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,090
Sure, call it god's wish
or that you had two dozen sons...

144
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,080
in your last life,
that's why god didn't give you...

145
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,530
even one in this life.

146
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,170
You shouldn't get so upset.

147
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,890
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

148
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,200
A mango tree.
Yes, yes, a lemon tree

149
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,650
In my courtyard

150
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,890
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

151
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,340
Come, my darling

152
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,090
Don't dance during the day.
Sing, my darling

153
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,356
Swing on this

154
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,160
In my courtyard

155
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,310
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

156
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,890
Poor me has to wander
from pillar to post

157
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,280
Why do I need?

158
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,090
In my courtyard

159
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,120
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

160
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:29,280
My life was very content

161
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,540
Alone for months

162
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,260
In my courtyard

163
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,530
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

164
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,966
The darkness is gone,
giving way to light

165
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,220
I was alone.

166
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,196
I ran into my sweetheart

167
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,910
In my courtyard

168
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,950
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

169
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,150
A mango tree.
Yes, yes, a lemon tree

170
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,160
In my courtyard

171
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,880
There's a mango
tree in my courtyard

172
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,770
Uncle Shamu! Uncle Shamu!

173
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,170
The baby is born. It was crying.

174
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,850
What is it? A boy or a girl?

175
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,770
I don't know.

176
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,946
You didn't ask me to find
out whether it was a boy or a girl.

177
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,220
Go find out whether
it's a boy or a girl.

178
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,960
- I'll go right away.
- Listen!

179
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,680
- Yes?
- Don't say I want to know.

180
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,510
My baby's hair is curly

181
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,220
Long live the mother.
Long live the father

182
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,840
May the newborn's
entire family live long

183
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,810
Aunt Sundar. Aunt Sundar.
Is it a boy or a girl?

184
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,250
Have you lost your mind?

185
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,190
Uncle Shamu wants to know.

186
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,720
Oh lord! These modern times!

187
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,120
Boys these days have
no shame whatsoever.

188
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,690
He wants to know whether
it's a boy or a girl.

189
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,610
Go tell him it's a boy.

190
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,250
Your sister-in-law
Kamla says it's a boy.

191
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,100
She's summoned you to see him.

192
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,420
And tell him he has a big moustache.

193
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,356
My baby's hair is curly

194
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,410
What happened?
Tell me what happened.

195
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,690
- Curly hair!
- Are you going to tell me or not?

196
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,950
It's a boy! A boy!

197
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,200
- A boy!
- Yes!

198
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,490
Chandu! Mohan!
Chuni! Come here, come here.

199
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,610
And uncle Shamu, aunt Kamla
said he has a big moustache.

200
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,506
My baby's hair is curly

201
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,176
What happened?

202
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,466
- What happened?
- What happened?

203
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,360
It's a boy! A boy!

204
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,720
Here.

205
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,360
You shameless man!
How dare you peek at your wife!

206
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,330
His father was like that too.

207
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,580
He did the same when he was born.

208
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,390
Shyam plays with colors
on the banks of the Yamuna

209
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,930
There is revelry in Brindavan.
Red color dispersed in the air

210
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,730
Say, Hail Lord Krishna!

211
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,400
There is revelry in Brindavan.
Red color dispersed in the air

212
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,590
Radha fills the water gun and aims it
at Shyam, causing his eyes to go red

213
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,870
Yes, red color dispersed in the air

214
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,990
Shyam plays with colors
on the banks of the Yamuna

215
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,710
lnnocent Radha was
drenched in colors

216
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,570
Praise lord Krishna!

217
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,340
Lord Krishna makes things exciting.
It is the festival of colors

218
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,780
Shyam plays with colors
on the banks of the Yamuna

219
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,170
Praise lord Krishna!

220
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:39,690
Come and put my little one to sleep

221
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Coming, coming.
I'll come and put baby to sleep

222
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,126
Grandma, grandma!
Jamnadas is going to the post office.

223
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,440
- Why not join her, aunt?
- Oh no, not now.

224
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,940
It's almost evening
and neither your mother...

225
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,610
nor your father has returned yet.

226
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,890
They've put all the
responsibility of the house on me.

227
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,730
Were it not for me,
dogs would take over the house.

228
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,886
Come, too, with me.

229
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,770
Not now.
Nobody to look after the house.

230
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,210
No, grandma.

231
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,070
Nandu, I'll beat you.

232
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,950
Look, Chandu is such a good boy.

233
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,850
He is sitting quietly by his grandma.

234
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,100
- Grandma.
- Yes?

235
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,106
I'll play with the top
on your head.

236
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,890
You're going to play with the top,
my sweetheart?

237
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,550
You are a prince.

238
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,650
Henceforth I'll only give
your younger brother and you things.

239
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,950
I won't give anything
to naughty Lallu.

240
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,640
But who is his younger brother?

241
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,426
Who is our younger brother?

242
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,700
Your brother, of course.

243
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,746
Where is he? When will he come?

244
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,310
Where is he? When will he come?

245
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,930
Not yet. He'll be arriving
during the monsoon.

246
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,120
And won't my younger brother get wet?

247
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,470
No, no, he won't get wet.
He will bring an umbrella.

248
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,770
Mother! Mother!

249
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,170
Daughter-in-law, take your children.

250
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,040
I've grown so old but I've
never seen such kids before.

251
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,900
They can't keep their
mouths shut for one moment.

252
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,720
Sure, even my Shamu was obstinate...

253
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,630
but nothing like your kids.

254
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,360
Why complain to me, mother?

255
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,600
They are your boys.
To whom would I complain?

256
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,100
Mother! Mother!

257
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,720
See that? See that?

258
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,010
Mother! Mother! Mother!

259
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,810
I am hungry. Give me food.

260
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,300
You're hungry? Come.

261
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,650
Sit here.

262
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,430
Here.

263
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,790
Remove some from there.

264
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
Mother won't yell, will she?

265
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,610
No, no.

266
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,810
Mother, he's stealing from there!

267
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,290
Daughter-in-law,
what are you cooking?

268
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,616
Curry and rice.

269
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,670
Look, you must add more chile...

270
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,730
or my Shamu will remain
hungry, just like yesterday.

271
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,390
How will the kids eat
if it's too spicy?

272
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,980
They can eat milk with their rice.

273
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,110
You are more concerned for the boys.

274
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,150
Grind some chutney as well,
daughter-in-law.

275
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,670
Mother, I'm very hungry.
Grind some chutney as well.

276
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,770
Aunt Sundar! Aunt Sundar!
Are you at home?

277
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,660
Welcome, Sukhi Lala. Welcome.

278
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,130
Sit down. Sit.

279
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,320
What's the point of sitting, aunty?

280
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,990
It's been six years.

281
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,620
Never mind the loan...

282
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,740
I've yet to receive even any interest.

283
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,870
It will be all of six years
this monsoon, you understand?

284
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,600
So why are you panicking, Lala?

285
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,410
Aunt Sundar isn't dying.

286
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,200
And even if I die I'll pay off
every paisa I owe you before I die.

287
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,430
You should be ashamed of yourself.

288
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,390
You come here all the time.

289
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,940
I told you so many times to
be patient for a couple of months.

290
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,340
Why?

291
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,810
Six years have passed
waiting for a couple of months.

292
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,590
If it was anyone but me
he would have seized your house...

293
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,540
your field, cart and cattle by now.

294
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm not that kind of person.

295
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,650
I believe in god and
that's why I'm silent.

296
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,770
And you're asking me to be patient?

297
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,030
You've been very gracious, Lala.

298
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,670
What gracious?
Will you listen to aunty?

299
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,100
She owes me and
she's lording it over me.

300
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,590
Look Lala, being stern
with me will do you no good.

301
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,090
If you want the money
you need to be tolerant.

302
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,146
I wasn't being hostile, aunt.
You became antagonistic.

303
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,980
Antagonistic nothing.

304
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,130
Lord knows how much I've
paid off in bits and pieces...

305
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,100
but you're behaving like
I've never given you any money.

306
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,420
That's not true.

307
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,716
Everything you've paid me has
been written in the account books.

308
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,390
The account books are yours.
You write what you please.

309
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,270
After all, none of us can read.

310
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,930
If you're so honest...

311
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,430
then give me a receipt
for the money I pay you.

312
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,970
Excellent! If I make out
receipts for two or three rupees...

313
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,510
I'll never get any work done.

314
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,310
I only issue a receipt when
the entire borrowed sum is repaid.

315
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Okay Lala, do as you see fit.

316
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,490
Aunt, according to me
some of this is your fault.

317
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,330
It has been six years.

318
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,060
If you'd given me
some grain every year...

319
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,110
you wouldn't be so burdened now.

320
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,750
What are you saying, Lala?

321
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,550
The amount of grain
we have is meager.

322
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,180
If I gave you the grain,
what would I feed the kids?

323
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,470
Look aunt,
I'm a professional moneylender.

324
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,480
How would I survive
if I let you off the hook?

325
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,800
And aunt...

326
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,760
you could give me one
thousand rupees right now...

327
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,250
if you had any intention
of paying me off.

328
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,616
If you don't have anything,
send your daughter-in-law...

329
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,410
to my house for housework.

330
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,270
What did you say?

331
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,050
Have you taken leave
of your senses, Lala?

332
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,580
- Aunt, you...
- Silence!

333
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,640
You have no wife, mother nor sister.

334
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,650
You are a lone man.

335
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,470
You expect my daughter-in-law
to do your housework?

336
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,700
Don't you think before you speak?

337
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,300
Lala, just because
we are poor today...

338
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,610
does it mean we have no dignity?

339
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,676
What will the villagers...

340
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,710
the neighbors
and the community say?

341
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,250
Mother will lose her dignity.

342
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,990
Very well. The day you get date...

343
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,540
we shall see whether
you can uphold your dignity.

344
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,580
Even if everything is sold
off I refuse to lose my dignity.

345
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,116
When you are starving
then I'll want to see...

346
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,170
whether you'd be willing
to lose your dignity.

347
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Go! Go! Do what you want to do!

348
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,936
What's the most you'll do?

349
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,850
Take away our cattle
and carts or sell the house.

350
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,560
As long as we are healthy
god will give us more.

351
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,930
Bansi, I'm fed up.

352
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,090
I thought I'd settle
down and my family would grow.

353
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,690
So what's wrong with getting married?

354
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,670
God has blessed you
with a wife so pretty...

355
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,180
that one couldn't find
in tens of villagers around.

356
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,370
And by god's grace you have
two kids and are expecting a third.

357
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,790
Ask me. I gawk all around
but I'm unable to see a thing.

358
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,710
The house feels so desolate.

359
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,800
You're right, Bansi.

360
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,800
But it's nice to have
kids when one has food to eat...

361
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,240
and clothes to wear.

362
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,890
Poverty seems to be gaining
on me with wide eyes.

363
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,640
And I keep having
one kid after another.

364
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,890
If it were up to
me I'd strangle them.

365
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,930
Grandma, Come eat if you're hungry.

366
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,130
Why don't you sit down
to eat as well, grandma?

367
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,470
Come here, grandma.

368
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,670
Alright, give me. Serve me.

369
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,180
Give me some more.

370
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,430
Mother, I want to eat some too.

371
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,150
Sit.

372
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,770
My darling little prince

373
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,050
He will have a car

374
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,590
Daughter-in-law.

375
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:02,110
Daughter-in-law,
bring me a little water.

376
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,260
I've got a cough.

377
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:14,589
Why not? I won't live much longer.

378
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,950
Oh god!

379
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,220
I can die peacefully.

380
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,650
Hey!

381
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,600
What is it?

382
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,880
Every day I tell you
to bring me a sari.

383
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,546
Why haven't you got me one yet?

384
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,470
If you like I could
bring you a sari...

385
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,610
that would attract
the entire village.

386
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,890
I don't care whether the villagers
are attracted to it or not.

387
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,920
All I want is for you
to be attracted to it.

388
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,290
Are you saying I'm
not attracted otherwise?

389
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,770
You are. But you would
be more attracted to me then.

390
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,970
Really? You think you're
still young, do you?

391
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,020
And why not?

392
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,470
Has my hair become grey
or have I lost my teeth?

393
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,310
Why wouldn't I think so?

394
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,280
A married woman
considers herself young...

395
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,220
even if she turns
a hundred years old.

396
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,430
My, my! Sweet sixteen.

397
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,960
If you had kids you
would be 10 by now.

398
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,600
My handsome darling

399
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,060
Buy me an ensemble

400
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,360
I'll put a veil on you
and make you my wife

401
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,210
The whole village
will come to watch

402
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,380
Let me give you a veil

403
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,010
I hope nobody casts
an evil eye on you

404
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,040
Let me give you a veil

405
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,000
I am delicate so
get me a light color

406
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,650
I'll wear the veil to the market

407
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,500
Buy me an ensemble

408
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,150
I hope nobody casts
an evil eye on you

409
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,900
Buy me an ensemble

410
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,750
Let me give you a veil

411
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,460
You didn't feel like working today.

412
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,650
You ran home from the fields.

413
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,470
It's a very beautiful baby.

414
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,320
He's even nicer
than Lallu and Chandu.

415
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,130
His eyes are exactly like yours.

416
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,680
Very beautiful,
very beautiful, very beautiful.

417
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,870
How are you feeling?

418
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,810
I'm okay, mother.

419
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,350
Even after all this,
life doesn't let go of me.

420
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,890
I'm disturbed now.

421
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,560
Why are you disturbed?
What do you mean, you're disturbed?

422
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,430
A baby is born in the family.

423
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,720
Don't you dare utter such bad words!

424
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,840
A child is born, mother.

425
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,740
I don't have money to feed us.
How will I feed this child?

426
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,490
You're speaking rubbish again!

427
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,720
Son, a child is a
successor and god's boon.

428
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,900
They 'e the ones who
will carry on our family name.

429
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,030
They'll carry on our family name...

430
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,420
if we can nurture
them and raise them.

431
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,230
And why not, son?

432
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,340
Children are born with their fate.

433
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,330
You watch, this child
will be so blessed...

434
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,810
all our sorrows will disappear.

435
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,370
Sure mother, you said that
even when the first two were born.

436
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,380
But we're still barely getting by.

437
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,220
How long will we appease
ourselves this way?

438
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,650
Father! Father!

439
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,430
What is it? What?

440
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,160
Will you shut up or shall I hit you?

441
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,410
'Father! Father! Father!'

442
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,820
I'll bind your legs
together if you cry.

443
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,140
Not even god knows
what to do with this lot.

444
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,440
Father, come celebrate
the festival of colors with us.

445
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,016
Quiet!

446
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,070
Why are you getting upset?

447
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,070
- Mother.
- Yes.

448
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,550
Father gets very upset.

449
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,020
Go play with grandma.

450
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,550
You haven't eaten anything
since this morning.

451
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,680
Eat something now.

452
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,246
What's the matter with you?

453
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,470
Go! All of you distress me.

454
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,150
Neither I nor you lot are dying.

455
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,960
Why are you cursing yourself?

456
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,370
I'm the one to blame for everything.

457
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,470
Nonsense!

458
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,650
I'll celebrate the festival
of colors with my darling today

459
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,960
With my darling. With my darling

460
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,960
I'll celebrate the festival
of colors with my darling today

461
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,130
I fill the water
gun and aim it at him

462
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,240
This color makes
my heart beat fast

463
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,680
He puts color on his lover
on the festival of colors

464
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,230
I'll celebrate the festival
of colors with my darling today

465
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,800
With my darling. With my darling

466
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,680
What is the matter with you, Radha?

467
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,980
Do you know what's going on?

468
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,960
Today is the festival of colors.

469
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,120
Holi is for the youth.

470
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,100
What's it to me?

471
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,000
You aren't old.

472
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,390
I'm worse than an old woman.

473
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,380
I celebrated Holi...

474
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,260
and the festival of
lights at my parents' home.

475
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,830
So what's happened now?

476
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,590
Now I have no joy, happiness
or excitement about anything.

477
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,070
Everything feels good
when we have food to eat.

478
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,510
But I feel even worse
when I look at my husband.

479
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,650
How can I be happy when he is sad?

480
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,830
Mother!
Mother!

481
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,340
Mother, mother,
won't you come to see the dance?

482
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,240
Please change your clothes, mother.

483
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,900
I told you to change your clothes
before giving the sweets.

484
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,810
And I told you to pay.

485
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,940
Mother!

486
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,560
Won't you come to watch the dance?

487
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,650
To whom should I leave them?

488
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,230
Listen!

489
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,130
You are asleep just like my fortune.

490
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,530
My heart questioned me.

491
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,140
Dear...

492
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,470
You are sati.

493
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,040
Your existence depends
on the well being of your husband.

494
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,490
Based on this belief...

495
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,320
Lord?

496
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:58,850
My darling left me high and dry

497
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,130
Don't be afraid of sorrow

498
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:22,940
The one to whom you always said this,
"You mean more than life itself"...

499
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:39,550
you turned away
and broke the heart...

500
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:48,060
of a fragile girl

501
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,450
You also took half with you

502
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,310
Mother, I'm hungry.

503
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,320
Go to sleep, son.

504
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,510
You're hungry today but
you will be full tomorrow.

505
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,550
Your father will bring food tomorrow.

506
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,176
'Father will bring food.
Father will bring food.'

507
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,190
From where will he bring food?
Nothing is grown in our fields.

508
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,530
I won't wait for much longer.

509
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,980
I'll acquire the land
within a day or two.

510
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,120
But Lala, the poor chap's
kids will starve to death.

511
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:57,390
Brother, as long as the
lady is young, the kids won't die.

512
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,150
I put my faith in
god and got married.

513
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:04,360
You strut like a masochist.

514
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,300
Father! Father!

515
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,450
Shut up!

516
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,070
Why are you behaving this way?
He is hungry.

517
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,690
What am I supposed to do
if he's hungry? Let him die!

518
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,720
You shouldn't say such things.

519
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,310
God will be offended.

520
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,330
If he gets offended
then complain to him.

521
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,260
Why do you get so cross?

522
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,716
When we haven't had anything for
so long what will we get now?

523
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,160
Let them starve to death.

524
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,730
How can I let them die?

525
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,366
God has given us...

526
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,010
If he's given them to us, let him
fill their stomachs. Why ask me?

527
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,080
You brush God aside and
you're talking about sins.

528
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,630
Shut up! Damn you.

529
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,700
You're aware, Lala,
I haven't reaped a crop this year.

530
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,480
I don't want to know about the crop.

531
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,470
Simply sign the land over to me...

532
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,010
or I'll sue you and
you'll have to pay expenses.

533
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,350
I'll get your house auctioned
along with your fields.

534
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,840
Give me.

535
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,560
Have some consideration
for my kids, Lala.

536
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,600
I've given sufficient
consideration to the kids.

537
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,940
What have you planned?

538
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:28,850
It's almost dawn.

539
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,920
You don't sleep yourself
or let me get any sleep.

540
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,830
What do you gain from it?

541
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,430
Tusli.

542
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,920
You've already decided on a name?

543
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,220
- Does it mean it's a girl?
- Yes.

544
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,350
How did you know?

545
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,780
My heart says so.
And the goddess is herself a female.

546
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,550
She won't bless us with a boy.

547
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,621
I don't mind even if it is a girl.
I wish she'd bless us with a child.

548
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,170
Radha and I will deliver
within a few days.

549
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,836
Does it mean?

550
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,700
Of course.
They're going to have a child.

551
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,200
Poor Shamu is very
perturbed these days.

552
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,050
And even my poor
Radha is very depressed.

553
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,810
I haven't seen her
smile for a long time.

554
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,480
She was very happy
before she got married.

555
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,920
So who's to blame for it?

556
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,890
Nobody. It is karma.

557
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,680
That's the way of the world.

558
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,570
Some laugh and some cry.

559
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,000
Some sad women can't sleep
all night due to abject sorrow.

560
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,990
And some married women like me...

561
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:42,800
lay their heads at their
husband's feet in moonlight...

562
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,010
and pray.

563
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,140
This life can't be trusted.

564
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,380
Daughter-in-law.

565
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,070
Why is your vermilion spot messed up?

566
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,336
Brother,
have you seen Chandu's father?

567
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,910
No. What's the matter, sister Radha?

568
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,610
Chandu's father! Chandu's father!

569
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,400
Brother Bansi,
have you seen Chandu's father?

570
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,330
No, what is the matter? Where is he?

571
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,830
Radha! Radha! Radha!

572
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,670
Listen to me!

573
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,680
Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother!

574
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,620
Mother, where has father gone?

575
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,370
- He's gone on a pilgrimage.
- Where?

576
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,290
To Brindavan, son.

577
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,840
When will he return?

578
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,520
He'll be back in a couple of days.

579
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:43,020
Mother, are you crying
because he didn't take you?

580
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,580
Did you learn anything?
Has he gone away?

581
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,850
Yes, defeated by the world.

582
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,710
What will become
of the poor man's child?

583
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,380
Radha.

584
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,346
Radha.

585
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,366
Aunt.

586
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,150
Radha, why are you so restless?

587
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,470
Aunt, sister Radha, don't panic.

588
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,600
He must have gone out on an errand.
He'll be back.

589
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,940
All of us are here for you.

590
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:28,480
There's no reason to panic.

591
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,030
- Mother!
- Mother!

592
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,790
We're taking the yoke
to go till the land like father.

593
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,030
Yes, I'm going too.

594
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,890
Not now, son. Grow up first, son.

595
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,380
Will father be back
from Brindavan by then?

596
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,930
Grandma. Grandma.

597
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,780
Grandma. Here.
You asked for water, didn't you?

598
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,760
Take the water.

599
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,320
Grandma.

600
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,080
Chandu, I don't know what's
the matter with grandma.

601
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,670
She isn't talking.

602
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,910
Grandma isn't talking?

603
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,530
No.
Come, I'll show you.

604
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,690
Grandma.
Grandma, why aren't you talking?

605
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,970
Grandma.

606
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,650
Come, let's tell mother.

607
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,870
Mother, mother,
grandma isn't talking.

608
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,780
Mother, mother, grandma is asleep.

609
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,210
She's sound asleep.

610
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,880
Okay, okay. You wait here.

611
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,070
Mother, open up! Mother, open up!

612
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:11,720
Mother, open the door!

613
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,230
Open. Mother!

614
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,010
Let us come in, mother.

615
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,370
No, my boys.

616
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,720
Why?

617
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,016
- Why?
- Grandma has left us.

618
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,630
Where?
To join father?

619
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,290
To join father?

620
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,250
Mother, why are you crying?

621
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,250
Uncle, please weigh this.

622
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:46,050
What are you doing?
You have only a few things left.

623
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,640
Will you sell these as
well to feed the Brahmans?

624
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,800
How will she achieve salvation
if I don't feed them, uncle?

625
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,440
And this is all I can do for mother.

626
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,840
Mother, you give us dry
bread and serve sweets to them.

627
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,840
- We want sweets too.
- Mother, we want sweets too.

628
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,290
Yes, I'll feed you sweets.

629
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,160
Mother!

630
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,660
Open the door. Open.

631
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,410
Mother, open the door.

632
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,810
What is it? Go play outside.

633
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,730
We are afraid.

634
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,220
Aunt Kamla,
has my younger brother arrived?

635
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,660
Aunt Kamla,
has my younger brother arrived?

636
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Not yet.
Go out. He'll come from there.

637
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,620
Mother! Mother! Let us enter.

638
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,290
Mother! Mother! Let us enter.

639
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,100
Let us enter.

640
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,556
Kamla!

641
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,580
- Let us enter, mother.
- Let them enter.

642
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,970
Lala, please be patient.

643
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,910
What can she do all by herself?

644
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,240
I don't care.
She is shirking every day.

645
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,650
Life is not to be trusted.

646
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,090
I could die or she might...

647
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,646
Stop it already, Lala!

648
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,410
Why should she die?
The poor thing has young children.

649
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,890
Why don't you die? If you
die half the village will come alive.

650
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:48,340
If people could be cursed to death...

651
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,490
by now I would have died
at least forty to fifty times.

652
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,150
You need not be afraid, Lala.

653
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,990
You'll kill the entire
village before you die.

654
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,740
You talk big.

655
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,910
Why don't you tell your
husband to give me my money?

656
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,130
Why tell me? Talk to him.

657
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,720
I'll surely talk to him.

658
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,830
Never mind all that.
Tell her to give me my money.

659
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,780
I don't care about
the rest of the world.

660
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,150
Lala, does excess wealth
make people blind as well?

661
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,460
Can't you see?
What does she have to give you?

662
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,270
She sold what little she had.

663
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,446
Some of it went towards
repayment of small loans.

664
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,130
The rest was used
for the aunt's death.

665
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,030
What does she have now to give you?

666
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,370
Of course she has.
She can sell the land and pay me.

667
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,880
And what will she feed the kids?
Your heart?

668
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,060
I'm not responsible for the kids.

669
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,460
Whether she feeds them
my heart or her own head...

670
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:36,700
is not my problem.

671
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,840
I am cautioning you,
Shamu had signed the deed.

672
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,816
I'll bring a court
order within a few days...

673
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,460
and have them sell
the house and land.

674
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,180
She'll get only a tenth of the value.

675
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,600
And that will make you happy,
won't it?

676
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,310
Lala, I ask you, will you...

677
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,860
take all that wealth
with you when you die?

678
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,920
Why are you victimizing
the poor, Lala?

679
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,310
I often wonder about that, Kamla.

680
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,490
May I say something
if you don't mind?

681
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,440
Look, Shamu was an honorable man.

682
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,760
He probably went and
drowned himself somewhere.

683
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,230
Aunt Sundar was left,
and she passed away too.

684
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,000
That leaves her alone.

685
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,396
If she wishes she
could take my wealth.

686
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,440
Lala!

687
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,920
You scoundrel!

688
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,480
Get out of my house.

689
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,036
God has given you so much wealth...

690
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,860
you lust over ladies
from other families.

691
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,590
Thank god your kin died.

692
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,450
Else you would lust for them as well.

693
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:41,790
Rogue!

694
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,710
Very well.

695
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,790
Radha.

696
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,630
Kamla.

697
01:02:57,470 --> 01:03:00,580
I wouldn't have to take
this if he were here today.

698
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,850
Don't be dejected, Radha.
They'll grow up.

699
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,100
Oh god...

700
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:15,480
give me strength...
to live this cruel life.

701
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,950
Save my honor.

702
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:41,070
Mother, why did you give him half?

703
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,250
We're the ones who tilled the land.

704
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:47,910
Son, we tilled his land.
That's why we gave him half.

705
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,940
Mother, who is this?

706
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,496
Son, this is the
priest from the temple.

707
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,740
And him?

708
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,500
- He's come from the farmhouse.
- And him?

709
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,450
He is the guard
who took care of the land.

710
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,020
What do we have in our share?

711
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,230
We have god and you in our share.

712
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,246
Here, take him.

713
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,090
Can't you see I'm busy?
How do I take her?

714
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,640
You were so excited about
a child before she was born...

715
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,820
and now she's born,
you don't want to lift her.

716
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,660
Really? You think
you've achieved a feat?

717
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,910
We have a child after all
these years and it's a girl.

718
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,520
First you raise them.

719
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,470
Then you give dowry and
hand them over to others.

720
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:32,360
Don't you know a girl
is born with her own destiny?

721
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,720
She'll take away
whatever is in her destiny.

722
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,376
- A girl is akin to a goddess.
- 'A girl is akin to a goddess.'

723
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,010
- Sister Radha is also a goddess.
Shut up. Never mind that.

724
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:42,550
How is she to blame? Damn you.

725
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:48,180
Hush, my dear. Your mother
fights with me, my dear. Hush.

726
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:52,310
Mother, give us new clothes
at the next festival of lights.

727
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,486
Me, too.

728
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,080
Yes, yes, I'll get some for you all.

729
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,160
Won't you speak?
Don't you want new clothes?

730
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,240
Okay, I'll get new
clothes for you as well.

731
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:06,490
No mother,
he remains nude and urinates.

732
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:12,730
Oh god, you've been very
merciful towards poor me.

733
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,240
Give me the strength to
make these little kids capable...

734
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,170
so that they may earn
an honest living for themselves.

735
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,530
I want nothing more in this world.

736
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,850
I am happy.

737
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,890
Very happy.

738
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,190
Mother, you said it would rain.

739
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,820
That's right,
mother, when will it rain?

740
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,160
Lala, we are starving.
We are here for your advice.

741
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,770
What can man say
about god's decisions?

742
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,020
And you are a Brahmin.

743
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,090
Can't you understand
something so simple?

744
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,540
If god wants us to starve to death...

745
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,520
then we should certainly die.
We are duty bound.

746
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,470
But Lala, helping people
during their bad times...

747
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,120
and feeding the
hungry is also our duty.

748
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,840
No, no, no, no.
Feeding the hungry is not my duty.

749
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,740
It cannot be my duty.

750
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,540
If god wants you
to die and I feed you...

751
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:47,600
that would be the greatest sin.

752
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,090
Lala, you could call us sinners,
but please give us something.

753
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,786
Our children are starving to death.

754
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,820
Lala, you have no
sense of duty whatsoever.

755
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,180
You can't take this wealth
with you when you die.

756
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:00,050
The world is dying
because of the famine.

757
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,090
Radha, how is he?

758
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,740
Mother! Mother!

759
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:14,780
No! No! No!

760
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,810
The land is arid anywhere you look.

761
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,820
The trees have burned in the sun.

762
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,360
The starving animals
stray here and there...

763
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,350
looking for green pastures...

764
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:31,879
and they find nothing
but dry mud and stones.

765
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,356
Cows are being murdered.

766
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,890
Thousands have starved to death.

767
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,380
If you have eyes then
look at the buffalo carcasses.

768
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,759
The dogs lick them but
find them dry and turn away.

769
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,500
The crows claw at them
but find no joy in them...

770
01:08:58,529 --> 01:08:59,959
like they were dry sticks.

771
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,526
There's no food as it is but now
finding water, too, has become a task.

772
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:03,926
The lakes have dried up.

773
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,496
No water remains in
the rivers and canals.

774
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,960
Dust has settled over the wells.

775
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,700
Even a stone would thaw at
the sight of this, never mind man.

776
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,500
But you're sitting
tight on a treasure.

777
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:17,910
Lala, have some mercy on
the cattle if not these men.

778
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,030
These are the cattle
that god used to herd.

779
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,060
This is our only wealth.
This is our only asset.

780
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:28,330
How will we have bulls
if we don't have them?

781
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,680
And how will we till the
land if we don't have bulls?

782
01:09:30,990 --> 01:09:32,850
Please leave.
Don't pick on my brains. Go away.

783
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,530
You should be ashamed of
yourselves for begging from man.

784
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,070
Can't you see that huge temple...

785
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,930
where the god who
runs the world resides?

786
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,880
Why don't you approach him?
What do I have?

787
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:43,839
Go over there.

788
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,530
Mother, where did brother Lallu go?

789
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,440
To visit grandma.

790
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:57,030
I will go too.

791
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:58,380
No!

792
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,200
No, god! No!

793
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:48,470
God, you have given us
this life and you will take it...

794
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:52,100
but it is very unbecoming
of you to make us starve.

795
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,470
God, we are sinners.
Please give us some grace time...

796
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,080
so we might redeem
some of our sins...

797
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,110
to prepare ourselves
for our next life.

798
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,810
Radha! Radha!

799
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,040
What about the money?

800
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,630
These days you have a good excuse.
To say that there's a famine.

801
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,590
But Sukhi Lala doesn't
care about the famine.

802
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:19,150
By the grace of god
everything is well with me.

803
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,466
Here.

804
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,890
You're giving me a corpse.

805
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:27,100
I'd take him if you
adorned him with gold jewelry.

806
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,690
There are plenty of starving
corpses in the village.

807
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,630
It's still not too late.
I'll tell you again.

808
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,450
There's no scarcity at my house.

809
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:41,040
Come over.
Why are you killing your children?

810
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,370
Save the remaining two kids.

811
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,770
God! Won't rain ever pour here again?

812
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:53,120
Have you heard our cow died too?

813
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,700
Their cow also died?

814
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:59,900
We dug up the roots of trees
all this time to feed them...

815
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,390
and yet we couldn't save them.

816
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,800
The poor thing finally died.

817
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,540
It's still not too late.
I'll tell you again.

818
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,210
There's no scarcity at my house.

819
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,080
Come over.
Why are you killing your children?

820
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,740
Save the remaining two kids.

821
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,910
Welcome, welcome, Radha.

822
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,380
My dream turned out to be true.

823
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,060
Come in. Come.

824
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:27,550
Last night I dreamed you
were dressed up like a bride.

825
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:33,290
You're here to brighten my house
just like the moon.

826
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,480
You made the dream come
true partially by coming here.

827
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,860
But you didn't groom yourself.

828
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,140
Lala, what do you care about grooming?

829
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,920
I've come to sell
my body for my children.

830
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,030
Okay, Radha, okay.

831
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,310
But when a business person
sells his product...

832
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,760
he packages it nicely
before selling it.

833
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:09,170
You're only looking at the exterior,
not the soul.

834
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:16,290
Soul? Radha, god looks at the soul...

835
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,800
while the world
only looks at beauty.

836
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,460
It's a miracle.

837
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:23,980
Come.

838
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,060
Come, come. Come.

839
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,450
Radha, this is really good.

840
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,660
Fortune leaves people's home at dusk.

841
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,530
But voluntarily walks
to Sukhi Lala's house.

842
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,260
Who are you calling a goddess?

843
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,100
You, of course.

844
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,660
Yes, Lala, you're right.

845
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:13,830
The poor goddess couldn't
protect her own in the evening.

846
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:21,110
She's here to lose
her dignity to you today.

847
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,890
Goddess, you lost your dignity
in your incarnation of Radha.

848
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,340
I made a mistake.

849
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,620
Radha!

850
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,140
Radha!

851
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:01,370
Sister Radha!
Sister Radha, help me out!

852
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:04,650
Sister Radha! Sister Radha!

853
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,850
Sister Radha! Sister Radha!

854
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,100
Sister Radha! Sister Radha!

855
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,590
Sister Radha!

856
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:22,770
Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty.
Give us water

857
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,180
Give us water. Give us water

858
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:37,470
Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty.
Give us water

859
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,410
The soil is thirsty

860
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:47,300
Fill the dry lakes

861
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:58,050
Fill the dry lakes, God.
Give us water

862
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:07,706
Give us water. Give us water

863
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:12,420
Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty.
Give us water

864
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:22,030
Let the fields become
green again with your blessings

865
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,710
Please fulfill our wish

866
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:37,350
Let the fields become
green again with your blessings

867
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,760
Give us water. Give us water

868
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,140
Please fulfill our wish

869
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,920
Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty.
Give us water

870
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,860
All the trees thirst for water

871
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,450
Water showers with thunder

872
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,080
Give youth to these gardens

873
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,790
All the trees thirst for water.
Give youth to these gardens

874
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,170
Give us water. Give us water

875
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,440
Give youth to these gardens

876
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:21,250
Our pots are dry, the cattle thirsty.
Give us water

877
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,916
That day you beat me
because I was alone.

878
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,360
I beat you badly.

879
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,810
That day you beat me
because I was alone.

880
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,720
Dear, I can beat all of you.
Don't even dare.

881
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,110
Come on!

882
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,536
What do you think to me. Come on!

883
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,770
Come on! Come on!

884
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:03,300
I'd like to see who is so brave.
Running away now!

885
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,170
They think they're very brave.
Come. Come forward, son.

886
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,090
I forbid you a thousand
times not to gamble...

887
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,150
but you always ignored me.

888
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:17,700
Rascal! I'll break all your bones.

889
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:21,210
You should be ashamed of yourself
for playing with the untouchables.

890
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,780
This is how you make
your father proud?

891
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:27,080
I swear by you,
uncle I wasn't playing.

892
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,810
What were you doing if
you weren't playing? Rascal!

893
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:34,490
Uncle, I swear by you I
wasn't playing. I swear by god.

894
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,416
I was teaching those
boys how to throw.

895
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,890
You think you're a teacher!

896
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:42,440
Go home directly or I'll
beat you all night.

897
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,160
Scoundrel!

898
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,826
Uncle, if you're
going to the market...

899
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:50,130
please find out the
price of millet and wheat.

900
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,600
Get lost!

901
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,920
Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! What a boy!

902
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:16,970
Talk, talk.
Please talk, bird of the forest

903
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:32,390
Your songs sound so sweet.
Your songs are very lovely

904
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:43,900
Sing in my ears, bird

905
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:58,680
Please talk, bird of the forest

906
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:14,160
Talk, talk, darling,
even if the forest catches fire

907
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:28,950
Your song is priceless, oh bird.
Priceless

908
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,110
Please talk, bird of the forest

909
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,650
The bird of the forest
is crazy about you

910
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,820
The bird of the
forest is your devotee

911
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,880
Please open your mouth, sweetheart

912
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:21,720
Please talk, bird of the forest

913
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:33,450
The forest bird is
crooning on the branch

914
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:37,060
Sing to the body, bird of the mind

915
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:48,680
I am frantic

916
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:02,820
Please talk, bird of the forest

917
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,480
Oh, so you were
singing all this while.

918
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,190
I thought my darling
Jamuna was singing.

919
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,040
Come to me, darling.
Let me embrace you.

920
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:35,670
You sound exactly like
my sweetheart Jamuna.

921
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:38,720
And look at your face.

922
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:44,490
Your nose, your eyes, your ears.
Brilliant! Your teeth.

923
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:50,750
You will be my wife hereafter
while I shall be your husband.

924
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,780
What did you say?

925
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:54,920
It won't happen?

926
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,590
You want to marry me without
checking out my birth chart?

927
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:02,050
Oh Ram! Which priest
do I summon for you?

928
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:07,426
Who called you here?

929
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,086
You're feeling edgy at
the sight of your competition.

930
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,016
You're feeling jealous.
Let go off me!

931
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,010
I'll check out the birth
charts of Jamuna and Dhoka...

932
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,876
and then marry
the one most compatible.

933
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,250
What are you doing Jamuna?
What are you doing?

934
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,926
You killed her!
You destroyed everything.

935
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:25,190
Let her go! Let her go!
Let her go! The poor thing is dead.

936
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,620
She's dead. She's dead.

937
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,120
So much jealousy! So much hostility!

938
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,470
So much jealousy!
So much hostility for poor Dhoka!

939
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:41,100
Let's go. Jamuna, tell me the truth.

940
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,470
You're under youth's oath.

941
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,690
Were you or weren't you
Dhoka in your last birth?

942
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,430
Okay, now go. Go. Go.

943
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,180
Greetings, aunt.

944
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:10,020
- Bless you, son. Bless you
- Come in.

945
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:12,280
- You're quite late.
- I couldn't help it, son.

946
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,550
I bumped into sister
Kashi on the way here.

947
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,160
I stood there talking to her.

948
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:17,760
Tell me, how is Parvati today?

949
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:21,040
Thanks to your mercy she is well.
Mercy on us.

950
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,640
Sit.

951
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:30,640
What mercy can man do, son?
It is god's mercy.

952
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,680
Did you bring the medication?

953
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,290
How could I? I was waiting for you.

954
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:38,710
Here. Hurry up and
bring the medication.

955
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,820
I'll sit with her in the meanwhile.

956
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,400
Lord Krishna accosted me

957
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:56,370
I was disgraced on the street

958
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,390
What are you doing over there?

959
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,260
Couldn't you find another
place in the village?

960
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:02,910
There are plenty of places...

961
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,840
but there's no better place
than this right now.

962
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,150
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Birju!

963
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,240
- Have you no shame?
- Shame for what?

964
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,960
Lord Krishna is
sitting here watching...

965
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,846
while goddess Radha
is bathing over there.

966
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,900
Don't say that.
Aunt's name is also Radha.

967
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,240
Hey!

968
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,490
Don't you dare say such things!

969
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,800
Don't you know I'm a very evil man?

970
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,530
Who cares?
If you're evil then go home.

971
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:27,996
Why have you come here?

972
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:31,130
Very well! I'll teach
you a lesson someday that...

973
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:33,420
Leave now. I'm coming out.

974
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,960
So, come out. I won't go.

975
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,340
- I'd like to see what you'll do.
- Look, Birju...

976
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:44,020
I'll complain to aunt Radha.

977
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:49,540
Sure, go tell her what you want.
I'll remain here.

978
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,840
Stay there or rip out your eyes.
You can't harm me.

979
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:09,350
I pray you slip and your pot breaks.

980
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,640
This isn't a man's foot,
it's a woman's foot.

981
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:21,730
I forgot what I came to tell you.

982
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,370
What is it?

983
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:27,140
I came here to complain about Birju.

984
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,256
What?

985
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,840
Do you know what happened yesterday?

986
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,730
- What happened?
- I mean it when I say...

987
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,970
if he wasn't your brother
I'd tell him off.

988
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,520
What did he do?

989
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,970
I was going to the fields yesterday...

990
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:43,940
and he was coming from
somewhere swaying like this.

991
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,230
The moment he got close to me...

992
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:49,780
he said to me,
"Where are you going, sister-in-law?"

993
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,700
Walk a little slower.

994
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:56,240
I told him, "Behave yourself, Birju."

995
01:27:56,910 --> 01:28:00,210
He says, "I am behaving myself.
Did I tell a lie?"

996
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:02,970
"Are you saying you
aren't my sister-in-law?"

997
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,456
Then I could say nothing.

998
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,670
You should have told him
you weren't his sister-in-law.

999
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,410
I felt like asking him
who was his sister-in-law?

1000
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,160
But I couldn't get the words out.

1001
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:15,760
- You liar!
- And I started walking.

1002
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,450
I told him to get out of my way.

1003
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,470
He says, "I won't move.",
and he started singing a son.

1004
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:23,940
Singing? Which song?

1005
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,770
- No.
- Sing it.

1006
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,960
- No.
- Sing it.

1007
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:29,290
- No.
- Sing the song. Which one?

1008
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,170
Sing it. You're under my oath.

1009
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:35,510
"Lord Krishna accosted me."

1010
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,386
"I was disgraced on the street."

1011
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:42,440
"Lord Krishna accosted me."

1012
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,440
"I was disgraced on the street."

1013
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,140
"Lord Krishna accosted me."

1014
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:53,050
Careful. Be careful.

1015
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:57,310
This is getting ruined.
Set this properly.

1016
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,100
- Mother!
- Who is it?

1017
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,880
Let go of me.

1018
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:06,170
Where have you been
since morning, Birju?

1019
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,610
I went to the market on
an important errand, mother.

1020
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,640
And what was this important errand?

1021
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,740
Let go of me!

1022
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,280
I'll fall.

1023
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,160
How could you fall?
I'm holding you.

1024
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,720
Let go. Let go.

1025
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:23,400
I went to the market
to find out the market price.

1026
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,850
The crop will be ready
within a couple of days...

1027
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,760
and I've spoken to a few
people about this.

1028
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,180
You were discussing since morning...

1029
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,730
and just now uncle Bansi told me...

1030
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,460
that you were gambling
with the untouchables.

1031
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:40,340
Uncle Bansi has nothing better to do.

1032
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:41,750
He's always hounding me.

1033
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:44,750
I mean it, mother,
I know nothing about gambling.

1034
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,406
Do you think I gamble?

1035
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:47,666
No, not at all.

1036
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:49,730
Mother, can I tell you
the truth about where I went?

1037
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:52,620
But don't tell anyone
or the surprise will be ruined.

1038
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,290
- Tell me already.
- No mother. Promise me first.

1039
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,180
I won't tell anyone.

1040
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,110
Look mother, it's like this.

1041
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,860
A saint has come to a
place two miles from here...

1042
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:03,700
next to the river bank.

1043
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,140
He has big locks,
long hair and big eyes.

1044
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,620
He is a very gifted saint, mother.
I forgot to tell you, mother.

1045
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,850
I've been watching
him for the past fifteen days.

1046
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:18,210
He's been standing on one leg.
And not on the ground.

1047
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,730
So what is he standing on, son?

1048
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:21,790
On such a large iron spike.

1049
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,870
I said to him,
"Baba, please bless us as well."

1050
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,660
He says to me,
"Come another day, child."

1051
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,820
Mother, I said to him, "Okay, Baba."

1052
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,450
Then he says, "Look up."

1053
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:36,776
I'm speaking the truth.

1054
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,150
It was noon and I could
see huge stars in the sky.

1055
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:48,040
Then he said, "I will show you god
after four days", mother.

1056
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:55,400
I will be seeing god
in a few days time, mother.

1057
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:56,970
Wait there, Manglu.

1058
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:59,290
Birju. Listen.

1059
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,240
Birju, take me there as well.

1060
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,360
Birju, take me with you tomorrow.

1061
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:25,410
I want to ask him something.

1062
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:28,540
Look mother, don't tell brother Ramu,
or I won't take you.

1063
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:29,810
No, no.

1064
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,000
Mother! Mother!

1065
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,406
Look at the handsome
bulls I bought, mother.

1066
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:40,056
The whole village
was complimenting them.

1067
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,240
- Lies, mother. Total lies.
- Stop it, Birju! Be quiet!

1068
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:44,720
They're very handsome, son.

1069
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:47,470
They are, aren't they?
My mother! My mother! My mother!

1070
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,140
They are, aren't they?

1071
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,080
Look at how handsome
the bulls are, mother.

1072
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,746
Mother, tell brother Ramu
to return the rest of the money.

1073
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:57,886
What money, mother?

1074
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,516
- They cost two hundred rupees.
- All of two hundred.

1075
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,036
He's cheating you, mother.
He's cheating you.

1076
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:02,756
This pair of bulls couldn't
be worth more than one fifty.

1077
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,866
Look mother, Birju is
arguing with me for no reason.

1078
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,286
- Arguing?
- Don't fight, son.

1079
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,636
I'd have paid 150.

1080
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,126
Mother, he's accusing me of stealing.

1081
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,430
- Stealing?
- No, my boy.

1082
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,980
So what does he mean?

1083
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,610
Don't fight, son.

1084
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,290
Mother, he's spoiled
because of your pampering.

1085
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,610
Sure, she only loves me.
She doesn't love you.

1086
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,530
God...

1087
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:27,210
you've been very merciful to me.

1088
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,750
I have everything
I wanted in this world.

1089
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,350
I want nothing now.

1090
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,210
I worked day and night
and paid off everybody's loans.

1091
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,450
You have been benevolent.

1092
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:48,510
I have everything,
our land, fields, cows and bulls.

1093
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,900
I ask for nothing more.

1094
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:59,980
Just get my Ramu and
Birju married to good girls.

1095
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,080
And let me see him.

1096
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:16,610
Aunt Radha,
I haven't seen Kashi for many days.

1097
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,970
The poor thing must be
busy with her worldly matters.

1098
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:24,570
Let it go.
She has no worldly matter but one.

1099
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:27,750
She will only talk about
her daughter when she gets here.

1100
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,780
Be quiet. She's coming.

1101
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,780
Welcome Kashi. Welcome.

1102
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,640
You will live a long time.
We were talking about you just now.

1103
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,880
So where were you all these days,
sister Kashi?

1104
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,650
You left on Monday
and only showed up today.

1105
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,260
What can I say, sister?
I have an unmarried daughter at home.

1106
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,690
How can I get out
of the house every day?

1107
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:55,160
My legs are shackled.

1108
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,566
Who did you leave her with today?

1109
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,950
With whom? I locked her inside.
She's asleep inside.

1110
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:02,850
Wake up darling

1111
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,990
Wake up darling. Open the door

1112
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,810
Your man is at the door

1113
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:24,960
My eyes. My eyes are full of sleep

1114
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,890
Why is someone calling out to me?

1115
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:44,790
Your man is at the door

1116
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,380
I have no man

1117
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:56,450
Why is someone calling out to me?

1118
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,130
I'll get upset and leave, darling

1119
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,000
Leave. Who are you trying to scare?

1120
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,840
I implore you. I implore you

1121
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,350
Just please come to me

1122
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,170
Wake up darling

1123
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,056
Wake up darling. Open the door

1124
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,570
Your man is at the door

1125
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,260
Jamuna. Jamuna.

1126
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,236
Aunt Kashi has gone to my house.

1127
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,660
She's locked you in.

1128
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,720
Yes, yes, I know. Please leave.

1129
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:08,170
Are you sleepy?

1130
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,426
Yes.

1131
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:11,090
Are you going to sleep
so late in the day?

1132
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:16,110
But why have you
shut the window, Jamuna?

1133
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,620
Ramu, you're a very good man.

1134
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,110
Go home now. I'm sleepy.

1135
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,020
Very well.

1136
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,640
- You really want me to leave?
- Yes.

1137
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,760
But please drop in
at the temple on the way.

1138
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,440
What can I tell you, sister Kamla?

1139
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,270
I've shown their
birth charts three times.

1140
01:36:36,970 --> 01:36:39,770
Ramu and Tulsi are
totally mismatched.

1141
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:42,680
Well, I didn't complain to you.

1142
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,210
If they don't match, let it be.
It's god's wish.

1143
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,361
Sometimes I feel like putting my faith
in god and getting him married.

1144
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:51,640
Oh no, sister. Please don't do that.

1145
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,990
I'll give you an example you know of.

1146
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:56,790
Nathu's son got
married in this manner.

1147
01:36:57,410 --> 01:37:00,350
You remember what they went through.

1148
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,510
Within one year both
boy and girl passed away.

1149
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,160
They sob over their fate now.

1150
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,520
That's right, sister. I, too, doubt.

1151
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:09,910
If it's his destiny, he'll marry.

1152
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:11,956
Try matching her
birth chart with Birju...

1153
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:13,480
if it doesn't match Ramu's.

1154
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:16,290
Sister Shanti, you've
grown old but you've no sense.

1155
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,196
How will she get her
younger son married...

1156
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,620
if her older son is unmarried?

1157
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:23,040
Yes, that's true.
I'm losing my mind these days.

1158
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,760
I worry about my
Jamuna day and night.

1159
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,636
That's right, sister Radha.

1160
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,560
Even sister Ganga's
daughter has come of age.

1161
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,580
- Try matching their birth charts.
- No need for your advice.

1162
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,250
I've already told sister Radha...

1163
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:36,146
if his birth chart
doesn't match anyone Tulsi's...

1164
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:38,070
then we'll match
it with my daughter Jamuna's.

1165
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:39,610
She's right here. Ask her.

1166
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,480
And what's wrong
with my Jamuna anyway?

1167
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:46,440
Yes, yes. I didn't deny it.
Call the priest tomorrow.

1168
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,620
Sure, I'll call the priest tomorrow.
For sure.

1169
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,840
Where did you go, Tulsi?

1170
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:02,550
You're past the age for playing.

1171
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,366
You'll go to another
house in the near future.

1172
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:05,886
Will you play there also?

1173
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,310
Where will I go, mother?

1174
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,600
You want to argue on top of it?

1175
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,540
I'm warning you, you're not
to leave the house after today.

1176
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:13,990
What happened?

1177
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:17,760
What could it be?
I slog with housework all day long...

1178
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,690
and your darling daughter
won't stop playing.

1179
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,820
So what? She's only a child.

1180
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,690
Have you forgotten your time?

1181
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,570
Listen.

1182
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,680
Go light the stove.

1183
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:39,720
Are you going to do something
about Tulsi's wedding?

1184
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,270
What can I do?

1185
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:43,500
I can't go and buy a groom
in the market.

1186
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:45,810
And her birth chart
doesn't match Ramu's.

1187
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,506
Else she'd be married by now.

1188
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:49,196
Just because their
birth charts don't match...

1189
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:51,740
- doesn't mean there are no other boys in this world.
- Why not?

1190
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,420
Let's tell sister Radha if
Ramu's birth chart doesn't match...

1191
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,380
then let's try
matching it with Birju's.

1192
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,440
Really? I don't want
to kill my Tulsi.

1193
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,870
Else I would marry
her to that drunken slob.

1194
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:04,850
Even if it meant sister
Radha was offended.

1195
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,280
She's your daughter.
Do as you please.

1196
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:00,790
- Is everything okay?
- It sure is.

1197
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,120
I've heard he owns a gun.

1198
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,686
He does, but it's useless.

1199
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,280
It's a relic from his grandfather.
He doesn't used it.

1200
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,910
Don't worry about it.

1201
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,400
Okay, let's go.

1202
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,420
Gulabchand!

1203
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,960
Gulabchand!

1204
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:49,570
Bring the gun! Bring the gun!

1205
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:51,190
Something seems to be wrong.

1206
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,340
- Hurry up.
- Coming, sir.

1207
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,490
- Hurry up.
- Coming, sir.

1208
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:01,810
Hold the lamp, hold the lamp.

1209
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:04,970
Hold the lamp, hold the lamp.

1210
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:13,490
Gulabchand. Gulabchand.

1211
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:15,320
Shine some light here.

1212
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,850
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1213
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,980
What are you looking for over here?
What's here?

1214
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,120
Go away.
What's your business here?

1215
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,690
Brother! Brother!

1216
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,250
Brother!

1217
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,340
What is here? Go.

1218
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,250
This is exactly what I needed, uncle.

1219
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:42,620
I can't do anything without this..

1220
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:46,180
Here, brother, keep this.

1221
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:52,310
Where have you hidden
all the rest, uncle?

1222
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,450
- I have nothing.
- Nothing?

1223
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,080
You hear that?
He says he has nothing. Come here.

1224
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,900
Tell us where it is, uncle?

1225
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,980
Tell us, uncle. Tell us, tell us.

1226
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:10,260
It's in the stove.
It's in the stove.

1227
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:11,810
Under the stove?

1228
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:14,320
Okay, then you dig it out, uncle.

1229
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:15,770
Sorry for the trouble.

1230
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:28,330
This is where it is?

1231
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,530
Bring our digging tool.

1232
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:38,760
Uncle, the money that
you've saved under the stove...

1233
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:43,660
every day told you get it out,
get it out.

1234
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:45,430
We're in big trouble.

1235
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:48,936
Uncle, money is supposed
to be venerated...

1236
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,770
but you've buried
it under the stove.

1237
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,460
Dig! Dig!

1238
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:59,080
Uncle is having trouble.
Help him a little, okay?

1239
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:07,250
Brother, tell me your name.

1240
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,090
Shut up!

1241
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,840
Okay, don't tell me.

1242
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:14,570
Take it.

1243
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,310
It belongs to your sister-in-law.

1244
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,486
You're experiencing
too much trouble, uncle.

1245
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:20,910
Let me remove it.

1246
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,330
Brothers, we've grown
this old but I've never known...

1247
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,760
of such an incident
to take place in our village.

1248
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,020
We've seen many petty thieves arrive...

1249
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:37,400
but such a huge plunder,
no brother...

1250
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:39,090
that's never happened
in our village.

1251
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:40,646
Isn't that right, sister Radha?

1252
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:42,680
Yes, Lala. You're right.

1253
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:47,190
I'm old, too, but I've
never known this to happen.

1254
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:49,470
Sister Radha,
we villagers must do something...

1255
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:50,920
about this very soon.

1256
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:54,270
Brother, I'm certain this
is the work of a known person.

1257
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,980
It must be someone
from our village.

1258
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:58,860
How would an outsider
know things about our village?

1259
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,680
That's right, uncle.
That certainly makes sense.

1260
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:03,526
It's someone we know.

1261
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:04,750
That's right.

1262
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:07,610
Brothers, I can think of a solution.

1263
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:10,820
If everyone agrees
then let's follow it...

1264
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:12,606
or we'll think of something else.

1265
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:14,230
Tell us the solution first, uncle.

1266
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:16,210
No uncle,
listen to my solution first.

1267
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,480
What if we dig around
our individual houses?

1268
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:24,086
Listen to that. Listen to that,
Radha. Is this a joke?

1269
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:25,206
Shut up, Birju.

1270
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:27,430
So Lala, tell us the solution.

1271
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:32,410
The solution is
that we get together...

1272
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:33,706
Yes.

1273
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:35,826
And write an application
and hand it to the Collector.

1274
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:36,946
Okay.

1275
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:40,600
That he give four or five
people licences to keep guns...

1276
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,650
for the protection of the village.

1277
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:44,430
Which people, uncle?

1278
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:47,740
- For example, you.
- And I.

1279
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:51,940
Thakur Bansidhar, Lala Ramkishor...

1280
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:56,180
Mukul Maharaj,
Lala lshwardayal, Lala Mukundlal...

1281
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:58,300
Lala Phoolchand.

1282
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:02,020
Brother, I had a gun
but they took that away, too.

1283
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:04,436
They took it away? Then
you should keep a cannon this time.

1284
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:05,560
Silence!

1285
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:08,550
So uncle,
that makes all the good people.

1286
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:11,880
No brother. Uncle hasn't
mentioned his own name as yet.

1287
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,226
Sure, me too.

1288
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:18,020
No uncle, you better not
buy a gun or raise your expense.

1289
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:21,666
And uncle, listen to me.
Also employ a servant to use it.

1290
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:23,566
Silence, Birju!
You're talking too much.

1291
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:24,606
Begone!

1292
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:26,550
- You see, mother? Uncle Bansi...
- Get lost! Go!

1293
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:35,010
Lord, please give
something to your devotees

1294
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:39,450
Sure, offer them,
offer them, offer them

1295
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:57,370
I yearn to see you,
dweller of my dreams

1296
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,920
Offer them some ambrosia

1297
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:17,300
Sure, offer them,
offer them, offer them

1298
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:26,340
Welcome to the garden of my life

1299
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:30,780
And resurrect the ruins

1300
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:44,730
Come and make the
withered bud bloom

1301
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:53,890
Sure, make it bloom, make it bloom

1302
01:46:58,870 --> 01:47:03,610
The place where that river flows

1303
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:13,010
The river that found its banks

1304
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:30,850
Bring joy to my mind

1305
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:39,670
Sure, let it flow, let it flow

1306
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:49,010
Lord, please give
something to your devotees

1307
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:53,330
Sure, offer them,
offer them, offer them

1308
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:09,960
What's this? Ramu? Ramu! Ramu!

1309
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:14,990
I'm afraid.
Ghosts dwell in this tree.

1310
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:18,290
What? A ghost dwells here?

1311
01:48:19,330 --> 01:48:21,770
But I can see a witch
on it at this time.

1312
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,640
Look Ramu,
I'll get back at you for this.

1313
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,860
- When?
- After we're married.

1314
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:31,440
Is that so?

1315
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:33,520
Really? In that case I'm going.

1316
01:48:35,570 --> 01:48:38,430
No, Ramu! No! No, Ramu!

1317
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,180
My Ramu.

1318
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,140
Repeat that.

1319
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:47,280
My Ramu.

1320
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:49,070
Okay, I'll wait here
while you climb down.

1321
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:55,400
You must save me if I slip.

1322
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:07,290
Well done! Well done!

1323
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:11,770
Now let's go.

1324
01:49:12,810 --> 01:49:15,790
Let's go where? This is your path.

1325
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:18,430
And my path is that way.

1326
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:25,300
Ghost! Ghost!

1327
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:35,780
Go. Why don't you go? Go. Go.

1328
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,740
Good.

1329
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,500
Do you think I really got scared?

1330
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:47,180
No, you're very brave.

1331
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:51,630
And Jamuna, I'm going to
the priest with our birth charts.

1332
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:55,350
What if our birth charts don't match?

1333
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:57,140
Why wouldn't they?
Are you joking?

1334
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:00,130
I presented two kilos
of gram to the priest.

1335
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,840
And I've promised him
another two kilos.

1336
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:09,370
Do you think the priest will
lie for four kilos of gram?

1337
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,060
I'm not asking him to lie.

1338
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:16,390
I'll tell him it's up to him
to make the calculations.

1339
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:21,020
Do the calculations in such
a way so they match.

1340
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:23,030
Wedding chants

1341
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:43,750
Brother Ramu. Brother Ramu.

1342
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:46,006
What's the matter?

1343
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:47,820
I am warning you to curb Birju.

1344
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:50,456
I let him get away today for your
sake and even took a beating.

1345
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:51,880
Tell me what happened.

1346
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,466
What do you think?
First they gamble.

1347
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,066
And when they lose
they start cheating.

1348
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:56,460
We bet fifty rupees today.

1349
01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:58,086
I bet on seven while
they bet on nine.

1350
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:00,560
It was a seven and he said
it was nine and ruined the board.

1351
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,580
And when I complained he beat me up.

1352
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,620
Has anyone ever won
against Kanhaiya so far?

1353
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:05,946
It is regrettable.

1354
01:51:05,970 --> 01:51:07,940
They sold millet for money.
They lost it all.

1355
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:10,860
How dare you gamble!

1356
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:13,130
I'll break the heads of
all the gamblers in this village!

1357
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:15,730
I'll break your leg
if I catch you gambling.

1358
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:17,480
You hear that?

1359
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,300
Mother...

1360
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:34,500
whether you like this or not...

1361
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,690
I'm going to take
Birju's limbs apart.

1362
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:38,190
Why? What happened?

1363
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:41,670
Very soon your son will
sell you and me to gamble.

1364
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,350
He sold grain worth two hundred
rupees and gambled it away.

1365
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:46,340
Oh god!

1366
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:49,230
I wondered where he
went early this morning.

1367
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:51,450
He's spoiled because you pamper him.

1368
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:54,590
You always take his side
like he's your only son, not I.

1369
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,560
What are you suggesting?

1370
01:51:56,810 --> 01:51:59,170
That I strangle him?
That I kick him out of the house?

1371
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:00,306
For sure!

1372
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:02,716
If my son were a scoundrel
who brought disgrace...

1373
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,580
I wouldn't let him
stay at home another minute.

1374
01:52:05,370 --> 01:52:06,570
Okay, son.

1375
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,040
If he were here, he wouldn't say this.

1376
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:14,480
Birju! Wait!

1377
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,590
Birju, where's the money?

1378
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,280
- Money?
- Yes.

1379
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:27,626
What money?

1380
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,610
The proceeds from
the sale of millet today.

1381
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:32,440
- Sold millet? Who sold it?
- Yes.

1382
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:40,360
Birju, I'm asking you
where the money is.

1383
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,800
You gambled away two hundred today,
didn't you?

1384
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,760
I gamble? Mother.

1385
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:49,290
Look mother, tell brother to stop.

1386
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,310
He has started bothering
me very much nowadays.

1387
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:54,450
And if I say anything you tell me off
for misbehaving with my older brother.

1388
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,460
Birju, where is the money?

1389
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,280
How is that money your concern?

1390
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,220
I sold my share of the grain. Who
gave you the right to question me?

1391
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:03,750
Ramu!

1392
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:06,530
Shut up, scoundrel!
Talking about his share.

1393
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:09,290
How many days did
you work on the fields?

1394
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:12,630
You're exhausted when it's time
to work but first to demand a share.

1395
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:18,620
Very well.

1396
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:22,560
Right from the start I knew
I couldn't stay in this house.

1397
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,880
Anyway, I'll go somewhere.

1398
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,980
Oh god!

1399
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:34,270
I never imagined I would
see my family split in my lifetime.

1400
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:41,050
I thought my kids would
bring me joy at this age.

1401
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:50,460
Mother, I knew you would
lay all the blame on me.

1402
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:54,830
No, son, I'm not blaming anyone.

1403
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:00,550
My destiny is to blame.

1404
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:07,250
Birju?

1405
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:09,320
Let me go, mother. Don't stop me.

1406
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:12,210
Ramu.

1407
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:18,520
Mister, where are you going? Kashi?

1408
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:20,310
None of your business. Anywhere.

1409
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,170
Okay, forgive me. You're big.

1410
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:28,240
This has nothing to
do with being big or small.

1411
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,520
Birju, you want me
to hit you some more?

1412
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:33,090
Come here. Let go of this.

1413
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,720
Ramu, embrace him.

1414
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:40,610
How dare you go away?

1415
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,250
Don't you care about mother?

1416
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:53,090
My dear.

1417
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,910
Pull. Pull harder.

1418
01:55:01,390 --> 01:55:02,590
Pull harder.

1419
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:09,880
Listen. How will we manage if
Birju continues this way?

1420
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,026
We'll manage everything. I'll
tell mother to get Birju married.

1421
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:17,190
He'll mend his
ways once he's married.

1422
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:19,470
He won't mend his ways now.

1423
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,990
Today he sold grain
so he could gamble.

1424
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,180
Tomorrow he'll
sell the land to gamble.

1425
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,640
I know you won't
distribute your land.

1426
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:30,350
Why should you do his work as well?

1427
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,330
He'll never do any work...

1428
01:55:32,460 --> 01:55:34,730
but he'll always stand
in front to take his share.

1429
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,820
Daily arguments and daily fights.

1430
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,346
It would be best if you built
another house and live in it.

1431
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:42,920
Jamuna! You've said this today...

1432
01:55:43,370 --> 01:55:45,070
but I don't ever
want to hear it again.

1433
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:48,510
Good or bad, Birju is my brother.

1434
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:50,810
You're talking about grain?

1435
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:53,660
I wouldn't split from
him even if he sold me.

1436
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:57,800
Jamuna, you can't separate
the sea beating it with a stick.

1437
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,590
We are both the sons
of the same mother.

1438
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,470
Birju, stop being such a cad!

1439
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:17,130
Move out of my way!

1440
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:20,930
Look Tulsi, think before you speak.

1441
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:25,350
Anger will get you nowhere.
You get that?

1442
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:27,920
The village is one mile from here.

1443
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,600
I'll chop you up and bury you.

1444
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:33,090
I was only joking.

1445
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:37,240
I swear by you,
Tulsi, I've given up all my vices.

1446
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,946
Cannabis,
marijuana, gambling and alcohol.

1447
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:41,470
And what about eye-teasing?

1448
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,750
I swear by my youth.
I shall only eye-tease you.

1449
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:48,370
All females are akin to sisters
and mothers other than you.

1450
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,190
Why do you eye-tease me?

1451
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,020
That's an entirely different matter.

1452
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,850
Very well.
I'm getting late. I'm going.

1453
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,960
Listen to me.
Where are you going? Listen!

1454
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,650
I swear by god you
are very fortunate.

1455
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:06,130
Being my wife is
not something ordinary.

1456
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:10,600
All the girls in the village
will be green with envy.

1457
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,390
All of them had high hopes.

1458
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:15,390
And what if my birth
chart doesn't match yours?

1459
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:19,140
Of course it will!
I'll burn down the priest's house.

1460
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:23,130
You just said you've
given up your vices.

1461
01:57:24,190 --> 01:57:25,690
I'm a gentleman with gentlemen...

1462
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:27,440
and a scoundrel with rogues.

1463
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,056
Anyway, never mind that.

1464
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:32,910
I've brought you something very nice.

1465
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:36,040
Here. Take it.

1466
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:39,236
How does it matter whether
you take it before marriage...

1467
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,760
or after marriage. Take it.

1468
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:42,550
Take it in your hand.

1469
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:49,690
Listen.

1470
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:51,090
What?

1471
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,300
Will you tell me what the matter is?

1472
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:57,970
My bangles are lost.

1473
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:00,130
Your bangles are lost.
They must be around.

1474
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:02,890
I searched every corner of the house.

1475
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,820
What? You searched
the whole house?

1476
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,540
So, where have they gone?

1477
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:08,730
That's a hundred fifty rupees
and you say they're lost?

1478
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:11,740
Ask the person who bought them
how he feels.

1479
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:13,680
Why? What happened?

1480
01:58:14,830 --> 01:58:16,580
Your daughter-in-law
lost her gold bangles.

1481
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:18,960
That's very strange!

1482
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,940
Something goes missing
from the house in broad daylight?

1483
01:58:22,650 --> 01:58:24,410
And who goes in her room anyway?

1484
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:26,870
Either you or she herself.

1485
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:31,700
And sometimes Birju.
But Birju wouldn't do such a thing.

1486
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:33,970
- Why not?
- Don't you dare say that!

1487
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:36,380
- What did she say?
- Nothing, mother.

1488
01:58:40,810 --> 01:58:42,010
Greetings, aunty.

1489
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,696
Bless you, my girl. Bless you.

1490
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,690
Did Kamla send you here on an errand?

1491
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:49,150
No. I came here to demand
sweets from sister-in-law.

1492
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:52,580
Sister-in-law,
did you lose something?

1493
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:55,560
She lost her bangles today, my dear.

1494
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:57,630
Take this, aunt.

1495
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,330
Why did you have to hide,
sister-in-law?

1496
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:02,550
You should have said clearly.

1497
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,140
Brother Birju gave them to Tulsi.

1498
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:09,240
How did you come across
these bangles, my girl?

1499
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:11,810
What can I tell you, aunt?

1500
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:15,430
I haven't complained
so far because of you.

1501
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,990
But he has made it difficult...

1502
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,450
for me to leave
the house or go anywhere.

1503
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:23,760
He teases me all the time.

1504
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:26,930
I was returning from the field...

1505
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:29,450
when he accosted me
and blocked in my path.

1506
01:59:29,700 --> 01:59:31,506
And told me to take the bangles...

1507
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:33,480
and he said he brought them for me.

1508
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:37,260
You hear that, mother?
This is the kind of son he is.

1509
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,240
And what would happen if
uncle Bansi were to find out?

1510
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:45,200
I'll talk to him when he comes,
my girl.

1511
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:47,370
He'll never tease you again.

1512
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:51,270
Okay, aunt, I'll go now. Goodbye.

1513
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:53,160
Bless you, my dear. Bless you.

1514
01:59:57,050 --> 01:59:58,346
You see, mother?

1515
01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:00,830
I had my doubts but I said
nothing as I was afraid of you.

1516
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:03,266
Mother, anybody who
can sell off the grain...

1517
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:05,716
and gamble with the money without
fear won't care about the bangles.

1518
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:07,240
He's really doing you proud.

1519
02:00:08,780 --> 02:00:14,070
Why are you hounding him?
I'll scold him when he returns.

1520
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,940
You only scold him.

1521
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:21,090
Lord Krishna accosted me

1522
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,380
Tulsi!

1523
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,700
Lord Krishna accosted me

1524
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:31,840
I was disgraced on the street

1525
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:36,010
Lord Krishna accosted me

1526
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:39,970
Tulsi, I went to see the priest.
Get that?

1527
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:42,210
Our birth charts match.

1528
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:46,010
And listen.
Don't wear those bangles. Understand?

1529
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:51,670
Lord Krishna accosted me

1530
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:57,550
I was disgraced on the street

1531
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:01,590
Lord Krishna accosted me

1532
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:07,400
I was disgraced on the street

1533
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:09,900
Lord Krishna accosted me

1534
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:12,320
Never mind the song.
To whom did you give this?

1535
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:13,840
What is this, mother?

1536
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:16,200
Of course. How would you know?

1537
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,570
Lord Krishna.

1538
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,910
I asked you who you gave
your sister-in-law's bangles to.

1539
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:25,180
Sister-in-law's?

1540
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:30,320
I don't know, mother

1541
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,400
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Birju.

1542
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,350
You are lying to my face.

1543
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:36,980
Do you want a beating
even at this age?

1544
02:01:37,950 --> 02:01:39,970
You're getting upset
for nothing, mother.

1545
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,800
I told you once I don't
know and you still ask me.

1546
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:47,110
You don't get it, mother.

1547
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,890
These bangles walked
to Tulsi of their own accord.

1548
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,110
How would poor Birju know anything?

1549
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:56,670
Look mother,
forbid brother Ramu from interfering.

1550
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,860
Of course. Nobody is
to interfere in yourbusiness.

1551
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,930
Even if you bring disgrace
to the entire family.

1552
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:04,370
You should be ashamed for stealing
the bangles and giving them away

1553
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:08,200
Pay attention to me, Birju.

1554
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:10,616
If you do anything
like this again...

1555
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,570
you'll have to deal with me.
Get that?

1556
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:16,820
The female gender!

1557
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,250
Mother. Mother.

1558
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:27,690
Why did I steal it?

1559
02:02:28,110 --> 02:02:29,986
Ever since sister-in-law
has come to this house...

1560
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,870
he acts high and
mighty all the time.

1561
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:33,510
Give me food.

1562
02:02:41,730 --> 02:02:43,130
What have you cooked?

1563
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:47,420
I'll serve you what I've cooked.
Why ask me?

1564
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:50,400
Quick, give it to me.

1565
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,670
If you were so desperate
for the bangles...

1566
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:58,250
you could have asked me.

1567
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:05,546
This is how you cook food?

1568
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,600
The rice is half cooked,
there's no salt or chilli.

1569
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:12,210
I eat once a day and
even that's no good.

1570
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:22,630
What happened?
He's hit you.

1571
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:27,220
You look after your house.
I didn't come here for a beating.

1572
02:03:27,450 --> 02:03:30,790
- I'm going to my house.
- Sit down. Why are you going?

1573
02:03:31,190 --> 02:03:33,000
He's young.
He's your brother-in-law.

1574
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:35,580
Are brothers-in-law supposed
to hit you with shoes?

1575
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:37,800
Lies! He didn't hit you with a shoe.
He slapped you.

1576
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:41,070
Okay, you hit me. Hit me.

1577
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:45,310
Silly girl.

1578
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,510
Brothers-in-law and
sisters-in-law have spats.

1579
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:49,140
That's no reason to be cross.

1580
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:56,550
You are cross. You are cross,
my darling. You are cross

1581
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:09,980
My sweetheart, my sweetheart.
You are cross

1582
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:16,640
You are cross. You are cross,
my darling. You are cross

1583
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:21,750
Just go, I'm not your sweetheart

1584
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:30,450
My gloomy darling

1585
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:38,990
My sweetheart, my sweetheart.
You are cross

1586
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:45,600
You are cross. You are cross,
my darling. You are cross

1587
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:54,470
Let me embrace you, my cross one

1588
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,510
Stop patronizing me

1589
02:04:56,940 --> 02:05:01,090
My pretty darling,
my beautiful darling

1590
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,580
What good is this sweetheart?

1591
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:15,800
My sweetheart, my sweetheart.
You are cross

1592
02:05:16,510 --> 02:05:22,390
You are cross. You are cross,
my darling. You are cross

1593
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:30,180
Sister Radha, I've been to your house.

1594
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,836
While there I learned
you were at the barn.

1595
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:34,380
- Why? What's the matter?
- Something unbelievable has happened.

1596
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,720
Send someone quickly
or he'll mortgage it.

1597
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:38,110
Who'll mortgage what?

1598
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:39,860
Birju, of course.

1599
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,320
What's the matter, uncle?

1600
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,630
Son, Birju came to
see me this morning...

1601
02:05:43,930 --> 02:05:46,810
and told me to mortgage
his share of the land.

1602
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:48,770
He said he needed two thousand rupees.

1603
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,060
I flatly refused.

1604
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:53,600
I asked him if he had
sister Radha's permission.

1605
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:55,810
He told me it was none of my business.

1606
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:57,666
That he owned half of it.

1607
02:05:57,690 --> 02:06:00,090
That he could keep it,
sell it or set fire to it.

1608
02:06:00,290 --> 02:06:02,160
I told him I couldn't keep it.

1609
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:04,920
Secondly I don't
have that much money.

1610
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:07,450
He got upset and asked if...

1611
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:11,430
I was the only moneylender
in the village?

1612
02:06:11,700 --> 02:06:13,350
He said he'd mortgage it with Keshavmal.

1613
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:15,860
He said that and left.

1614
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:19,150
Ramu, go talk to
him and bring him back.

1615
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:21,070
That's right, son, please go.

1616
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:23,480
What good will going
there now do, mother?

1617
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:26,480
He must have mortgaged it already.

1618
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:29,740
No. Go take a look.
It hasn't been too long.

1619
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:32,820
Ramu! Listen, my boy.

1620
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:37,250
Reason with him calmly.
Don't get down to fist-fighting.

1621
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:43,870
Son, what is going on in your mind?

1622
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:46,790
I have already signed
over the land to you.

1623
02:06:47,980 --> 02:06:50,410
You could at least
wait for me to die.

1624
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:52,970
How do I explain to you...

1625
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:57,290
the difficulties I
endured to acquire this land?

1626
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:01,250
There was no difference
between night and day.

1627
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,410
For whom is all this?

1628
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:05,400
For your happiness.

1629
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:08,580
Don't I have any joy in my life?

1630
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:11,700
Your father took
away everything I had.

1631
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:16,060
You two mean everything to me now.

1632
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:19,630
If I were alone
I would live off alms.

1633
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:26,290
Son, I request you not
to do this as long as I live.

1634
02:07:27,010 --> 02:07:29,510
Just let me live in peace.

1635
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,200
- Birju!
- Ramu!

1636
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:32,750
Why did you mortgage the land?

1637
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,980
- Did you hear what I asked you?
- Ramu?

1638
02:07:38,550 --> 02:07:40,550
- I ask you, why did you mortgage the land?
- Ramu!

1639
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:42,790
I needed money.

1640
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:44,310
- To gamble?
- Yes.

1641
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,760
- Yes?
- Ramu!

1642
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:47,750
Birju! Birju!

1643
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:51,680
Birju. Birju.

1644
02:07:55,130 --> 02:07:56,706
- Move aside, mother!
- No, no, Ramu!

1645
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,930
- Mother!
- No!

1646
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:00,670
- Birju!
- Ramu.

1647
02:08:00,830 --> 02:08:03,210
- Give me the money.
- Let him be. Don't fight.

1648
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,336
- Give me the money!
- I don't have it. - Let it go!

1649
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,456
Ramu!

1650
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,350
Ramu!

1651
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:08,690
- Birju! Birju!
- Ramu!

1652
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:10,050
Mother.

1653
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,330
Mother. Mother.

1654
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:22,310
My baby. My baby.

1655
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:25,310
My baby is gone.

1656
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,690
My Birju will not return.

1657
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:29,220
- Birju!
- Mother.

1658
02:08:29,250 --> 02:08:30,246
- Birju!
- Mother!

1659
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:31,370
Birju!

1660
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:35,260
Please return. Look,
your mother is calling out to you.

1661
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:38,390
Don't you have any compassion at all?

1662
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:42,430
Can't you hear the
call of a heartbroken soul?

1663
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:44,490
Birju!

1664
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:48,310
God will never forgive
you for this transgression.

1665
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:54,490
You are dashing an old
mother's hopes by leaving.

1666
02:08:55,490 --> 02:08:57,500
Birju! My baby!

1667
02:08:57,670 --> 02:08:58,870
- Birju!
- Mother. Mother.

1668
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:00,506
Mother, brace yourself.

1669
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:02,570
Calm down.
Don't be so despondent, mother.

1670
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:08,660
Ramu, my hope is
distancing itself from me.

1671
02:09:09,230 --> 02:09:12,700
Go, bring back my hope for me.

1672
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:14,630
You are older.

1673
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:17,010
Coax your younger brother
and bring him back.

1674
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:18,770
Go.

1675
02:09:19,140 --> 02:09:21,670
My baby is annoyed
with me because of you.

1676
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,020
Birju, mother is calling you.

1677
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:52,780
Briju, I'm not afraid of this.

1678
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:56,430
You'd be better off stabbing
your mother with this knife.

1679
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:59,720
She'll be silenced forever.

1680
02:10:00,780 --> 02:10:03,800
Birju, come back. Please forgive me.

1681
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:07,730
Brother! Brother Birju!

1682
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,530
Come back!

1683
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:49,740
I am destroyed, sister Radha.
I've had it.

1684
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,900
Look, your Birju
has written me a letter.

1685
02:10:53,410 --> 02:10:56,450
My Birju has sent a letter?
What has he written?

1686
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:58,040
He has written...

1687
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,440
He has written...

1688
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:07,890
Leave two thousand rupees
at the old ruins at midnight.

1689
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:14,650
If you don't,
I shall strangle you to death.

1690
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:18,030
Sister Radha, what should I do?

1691
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:21,020
Find some solution, sister Radha.
He is your son.

1692
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,120
Try to recall your bad times.

1693
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:25,170
I helped you in times of need,
sister Radha.

1694
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:27,210
I'd like the same
favor from you now.

1695
02:11:27,370 --> 02:11:31,050
Look, I don't have that much money.

1696
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,120
If it were a question
of a few rupees...

1697
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,000
I'd manage it somehow
and give it to him.

1698
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:38,370
How do I give him two
thousand rupees, sister Radha?

1699
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:44,100
And I shall die even if
I give it to him, sister Radha.

1700
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:46,550
Please save me somehow.

1701
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:53,640
The rascal didn't leave the money.

1702
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:56,540
What can the poor chap do?

1703
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:00,720
When it is time to die,
the mind stops functioning.

1704
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:04,090
Let's go take it from his house.

1705
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:11,290
Who is it? Mother!

1706
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:16,730
Mother!

1707
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:17,880
Son.

1708
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,700
Mother! My mother!

1709
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:22,200
Mother.

1710
02:12:24,830 --> 02:12:26,520
What brings you here, mother?

1711
02:12:27,660 --> 02:12:31,170
Son, I came to see you son.
Are you alright?

1712
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:34,630
Mother, you've lost a lot of weight.

1713
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:37,230
How did you know I was coming here?

1714
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,200
The rogue must have told her.

1715
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:42,840
Birju, have some
mercy for the poor chap.

1716
02:12:44,410 --> 02:12:47,490
He helped me in times of need.

1717
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:52,550
Mother, you have no idea.
That old man is a scamp.

1718
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:57,510
He has oppressed people
and amassed thousands of rupees.

1719
02:12:57,760 --> 02:12:59,160
He's a tyrant, mother.

1720
02:12:59,670 --> 02:13:05,080
If he's a tyrant,
god will punish him, son.

1721
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:08,290
Why are you getting your
hands soiled with blood?

1722
02:13:10,270 --> 02:13:13,480
Mother, blood doesn't
bother me anymore.

1723
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:16,700
These hands have become black...

1724
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:19,890
after being soiled
with the blood of hundreds.

1725
02:13:20,230 --> 02:13:21,820
Go home now, mother.

1726
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:25,530
No, my boy, I shall take you with me.

1727
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:27,370
No, no, mother!
Don't be obstinate. Go!

1728
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:31,950
You are talking to your mother.

1729
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,980
Don't be so merciless.

1730
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:40,950
Don't forget this
old mother raised you...

1731
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:48,740
and made you capable
of holding the gun in your hand.

1732
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:53,200
But my boy, I didn't raise you...

1733
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:56,720
to do this after you grew up.

1734
02:13:58,370 --> 02:14:02,850
I thought my Birju would
grow up and bring me joy.

1735
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,580
He would be by my side when I die.

1736
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,760
I wouldn't die in the dark.

1737
02:14:10,910 --> 02:14:13,930
My children's brightness
will be in my eyes.

1738
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:20,940
I fall at your feet, son.
Please have mercy.

1739
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:23,460
Give up all this.

1740
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:28,280
The villagers swear
at your mother now.

1741
02:14:29,690 --> 02:14:35,490
They curse me.
They don't call me Radha aunty.

1742
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:38,480
Brave men don't play
with toys of love.

1743
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,590
- No mother, please go!
- Come with me.

1744
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:43,686
A mother's lap is always
available for her child.

1745
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:44,716
Birju!

1746
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,736
I told you once not to interfere
in my matters. I won't go.

1747
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:48,160
I'll take you with...

1748
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:49,870
- Mother!
- Birju!

1749
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:11,990
Oh god!

1750
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:16,560
Can a child kill his mother?

1751
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,400
I didn't take one
paisa by hurting anyone.

1752
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,390
I'm very innocent, goddess.

1753
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:44,060
- Greetings, uncle. Greetings.
- Greetings. Welcome. Come sit. Sit.

1754
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:49,930
Brother Birju, my eyes would
look all over for a glimpse of you.

1755
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:57,760
Brother, I received your letter.

1756
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:01,130
That's why I got delayed
in answering it, uncle.

1757
02:16:01,190 --> 02:16:03,546
So I hoped nothing
untoward had happened.

1758
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:06,010
Oh no, god has been merciful.

1759
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:08,400
Keep that away. It will hurt.

1760
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,750
As for the answer, only I know...

1761
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:16,320
I can no longer write even one word.

1762
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:19,360
My hands tremble.

1763
02:16:24,110 --> 02:16:28,490
I've been looking for
you for many days now, son.

1764
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:30,810
I've arranged your marriage.

1765
02:16:31,550 --> 02:16:33,105
I told sister Radha several times...

1766
02:16:33,129 --> 02:16:35,089
of course, uncle. Of course.

1767
02:16:35,549 --> 02:16:38,749
That's why I wanted to come see you.

1768
02:16:39,150 --> 02:16:44,540
And collect everything
uncle has amassed over the years.

1769
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:46,670
It will be useful at the wedding.
Right, uncle?

1770
02:16:50,389 --> 02:16:53,919
It's like this,
uncle, you are old now.

1771
02:16:54,309 --> 02:16:58,919
If you die in the middle
of the night it will be a disaster.

1772
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:02,250
If some other walks
away with everything...

1773
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:04,710
then your poor nephew
will be left high and dry.

1774
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:06,720
I swear by your youth, brother...

1775
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:10,430
the house and property are yours.
But I have no money whatsoever.

1776
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:15,410
The house is mine but
I'm not to touch the hut.

1777
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:16,650
No, no.

1778
02:17:16,820 --> 02:17:19,780
Well uncle, I'll tell these
people to search the house.

1779
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:22,460
- Tell them, brother.
- Okay, go and search the house.

1780
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:24,270
Search for it.
It's your house. Search.

1781
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:32,570
So, tell me where is the cash, uncle?

1782
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:35,390
Cash?
I have no cash.

1783
02:17:35,639 --> 02:17:37,099
After uncle's...

1784
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:40,080
Damn you, uncle! Look!

1785
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:48,170
I'll chop you up
into pieces like this.

1786
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:51,690
There's nothing in the safe.

1787
02:17:55,250 --> 02:17:57,420
Where have you stashed it, old man?

1788
02:18:00,469 --> 02:18:03,009
Look Birju, I have nothing.

1789
02:18:03,139 --> 02:18:04,959
- Tell me.
- I have nothing, Birju.

1790
02:18:05,059 --> 02:18:06,456
- Tell me!
- I don't.

1791
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:07,890
- Tell me!
- I don't.

1792
02:18:25,799 --> 02:18:27,329
This is appalling, Mr. Pandey.

1793
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:28,916
Sukhi Lala was killed yesterday.

1794
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:30,880
Who knows? We might be next.

1795
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:33,200
I can't sleep at night, brother.

1796
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,406
Living in this village
has become difficult now.

1797
02:18:35,430 --> 02:18:37,370
We can't think of a solution,
Mr. Pandey.

1798
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,810
What's the solution?

1799
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,600
We don't know where they are.

1800
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,190
There is one solution, Mr. Pandey.

1801
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:46,430
We'll tell the villagers to gather
and beat Radha and Ramu someday.

1802
02:18:46,639 --> 02:18:48,309
- Then we'll know.
- Yes, that's right!

1803
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:51,790
No. But I know they don't know, either.

1804
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:10,600
Rascals! You should
be ashamed of yourselves.

1805
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:11,950
Scat!

1806
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:13,640
Get lost! lmps!

1807
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:15,600
- Shameless! Scram!
- Let it be, son.

1808
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,920
Wait, wait. Try to understand.

1809
02:19:35,059 --> 02:19:36,559
Understand what? Let me go.

1810
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:38,970
I'll break all their heads today.

1811
02:19:39,379 --> 02:19:41,389
Brother Shamu's wife
won't be treated cruelly...

1812
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:43,180
for as long as I am alive.

1813
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:45,040
Come to your senses.
Come to your senses.

1814
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:46,820
You think you're the village headman?

1815
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:48,870
Who can defeat the boy's flunkies?

1816
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:52,110
Brothers,
you should be ashamed of yourselves...

1817
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:53,760
for troubling my old mother.

1818
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:57,060
A few days ago you
addressed her as aunt.

1819
02:19:58,390 --> 02:20:00,040
Today you're pelting her with stones?

1820
02:20:01,570 --> 02:20:02,970
It is very unfortunate.

1821
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,720
As time passes we
too will pass, mother.

1822
02:20:08,220 --> 02:20:11,830
Do you like it when people
throw stones at you or abuse you?

1823
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:13,630
I can't tolerate this.

1824
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:17,780
Son, I shall remain in this house...

1825
02:20:19,630 --> 02:20:22,590
waiting for your father
for as long as I live.

1826
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:28,200
Lord knows when he might miss you.

1827
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:32,860
If I leave the house and he comes...

1828
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:35,510
the house will be deserted.

1829
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:38,160
Where will he go?

1830
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:42,730
Even they must be old by now.

1831
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:47,300
Nobody will even offer
him water in this village.

1832
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,710
Look sir, he's been loitering around
our den for a long time.

1833
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:01,850
When we asked him his
name he tried to fool us.

1834
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:03,720
Take off his mask.

1835
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:11,010
- Birju.
- Brother Ramu.

1836
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:18,150
Who invited you here?

1837
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:19,540
Nobody.

1838
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:22,010
An older brother has come
to see his younger brother.

1839
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:24,820
I don't know of any brother. Leave.

1840
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,950
Birju, mother is on her deathbed.

1841
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:33,930
Lord knows she takes your
name and cries all day long.

1842
02:21:35,290 --> 02:21:36,890
She's at home all the time.

1843
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,790
Birju, the villagers
have restricted her movements.

1844
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:44,450
All the boys throw stones at her.

1845
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:46,610
They shower abuse on her.

1846
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:48,640
They call her a witch and occultist.

1847
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:52,740
Birju, your mother is
being tormented because of you.

1848
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:55,020
For the sake of god, come home.

1849
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:56,510
Give up all this.

1850
02:21:56,730 --> 02:21:58,380
I'm saying it for your wellbeing.

1851
02:21:59,770 --> 02:22:01,980
I am saying this for
mother's sake, Birju.

1852
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:08,460
Brother Ramu,
I'm not a child anymore...

1853
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:18,220
who might be affected
by your sob stories.

1854
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,960
There's joy and sorrow in the world.

1855
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:27,240
These things don't bother me.

1856
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,050
- Go now.
- Birju!

1857
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:33,880
I left the house determined
to bring you home with me.

1858
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:37,570
Either you or I will survive today.

1859
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:40,460
Brother, you are married.

1860
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:46,400
It's a grave sin to willingly
make your young wife a widow.

1861
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:50,320
It would be in your best
interest to leave quietly.

1862
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:51,710
Birju.

1863
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:54,500
- I'll take you with me.
- I am warning you. Leave!

1864
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:56,930
- You have to come with me, Birju.
- I'm warning you. Leave!

1865
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:58,620
I'd like to see you stop me. Come.

1866
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:02,010
Talk. Will you come or won't you?

1867
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,790
Don't you dare!

1868
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,160
Escort him out.

1869
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,850
This isn't right, Birju.

1870
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:17,370
Come for your mother's
sake if not for me.

1871
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:19,750
Concede. Concede now, Birju.

1872
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:38,260
Spruce up the bride
for the groom is here

1873
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:46,070
The groom is here.
The groom is here

1874
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:53,690
Spruce up the bride
for the groom is here

1875
02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:02,130
What are you doing, sister Radha?

1876
02:24:02,350 --> 02:24:05,750
Your daughter's getting
married and you're still at home?

1877
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,100
Get up. As though you didn't know.

1878
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:13,410
Why wouldn't I know, sister?
But don't take me there.

1879
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:19,206
I heard that the villagers
said they wouldn't come if I do.

1880
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:20,326
So what?

1881
02:24:20,350 --> 02:24:22,660
Would my Tulsi's marriage
stop if they don't come?

1882
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:26,180
Great! That's a good excuse you have.

1883
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:28,490
Get up. I didn't expect this of you.

1884
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:34,940
Kamla, I didn't come because
I don't want friction...

1885
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:36,910
at the wedding
because of one person.

1886
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:39,240
Wouldn't I attend Tulsi's
wedding otherwise?

1887
02:24:39,430 --> 02:24:41,030
Yeah, yeah. Get up, get up.

1888
02:24:56,930 --> 02:24:58,940
Wedding chants

1889
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:08,260
Sister Radha.

1890
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:13,760
Radha.

1891
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:16,936
Then we can't stay here.

1892
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:19,670
Brother Bansi, you attend
the wedding all on your own.

1893
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:20,800
We're leaving.

1894
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,980
Come on, brothers! Get up!
Get up, get up!

1895
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,920
But will you tell me
what the matter is, Lala?

1896
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:26,440
Did I make a mistake?

1897
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,970
'Mistake.' You're asking
us if you made a mistake?

1898
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:32,670
We warned you we wouldn't
attend the wedding...

1899
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,196
if Radha attended.

1900
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:35,980
Come on, brothers! Get up!

1901
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:39,180
Get up! Let's go.

1902
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:42,300
What are you saying, Lala?

1903
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:45,630
Is sister Radha an untouchable?

1904
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:47,790
Is sister Radha an untouchable?

1905
02:25:47,970 --> 02:25:49,876
She's worse than the untouchables.

1906
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,426
- The untouchables are better than her.
- Yes.

1907
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:53,170
Sure Lala, you are right.

1908
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:56,310
The untouchables are better than me.

1909
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:59,320
Sister Kamla, I'm leaving.

1910
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:01,720
I already told you
not to bring me here.

1911
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:04,160
No, no, this is impossible.

1912
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:06,510
Okay, okay, we'll leave.

1913
02:26:06,610 --> 02:26:08,310
But brothers,
what has sister Radha done?

1914
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:10,080
What has she done?

1915
02:26:10,250 --> 02:26:14,130
She gets her son to plunder
the village and commit murder.

1916
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:16,330
And you want to know what she's done?

1917
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:19,080
But brother, she is herself
frustrated with that scoundrel...

1918
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:20,570
but she's helpless.

1919
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:21,990
Be careful.

1920
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:26,270
Restrain everyone
until I get far away.

1921
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:27,860
Let's go.

1922
02:26:30,010 --> 02:26:32,426
Let's leave. Let's leave. The
wedding will only take place afterwards.

1923
02:26:32,450 --> 02:26:35,650
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1924
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,700
Birju!

1925
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:49,280
- My daughter! My daughter!
- Birju! What are you doing?

1926
02:26:49,310 --> 02:26:50,906
Birju!
Where are you taking her?

1927
02:26:50,930 --> 02:26:51,930
Birju!

1928
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:53,460
- I'm ruined.
- Birju!

1929
02:26:57,870 --> 02:26:59,590
What are you waiting for?

1930
02:27:00,190 --> 02:27:05,400
Go around the house
and surround these people.

1931
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:07,400
Go! Why are you standing here?

1932
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:09,230
What are you waiting for?

1933
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:10,910
Shame on you cowards!

1934
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:12,650
You got scared of these four thieves?

1935
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:14,940
Nab these rascals! Hit them!

1936
02:27:15,630 --> 02:27:19,530
Nab these rascals! Hit them!

1937
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:24,830
Hit them! Hit them! Hit them!

1938
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:30,776
- Birju, Birju, what are you doing?
- Can't you see I'm getting married?

1939
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:32,566
You can't.
She's another man's wife now.

1940
02:27:32,590 --> 02:27:34,316
Brave men don't care.

1941
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:36,460
I won't let you take her away.
Run, Tulsi, run!

1942
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:39,300
Sister Radha, I am destroyed.

1943
02:27:39,850 --> 02:27:42,810
It is good thing. Serves you
right for inviting sister Radha.

1944
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:44,630
Someday he'll carry you away, too.

1945
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:46,260
He went because of this witch.

1946
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:48,636
That's right.
Tell her to bring him back.

1947
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,426
If they don't bring him,
then burn down her house.

1948
02:27:50,450 --> 02:27:52,050
That's right! That's right!

1949
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:55,730
I'll take my Tulsi back from you.
Help me.

1950
02:27:55,940 --> 02:27:58,650
I'll bring her.
I will surely bring her.

1951
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:00,516
You'll bring her?
When will you bring her?

1952
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:02,610
When he brings disgrace
to this village!

1953
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:04,350
In any case, who'll marry her now?

1954
02:28:04,510 --> 02:28:07,180
No. My Birju is not evil.

1955
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:09,670
Hit her!

1956
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,760
How dare you lord over me!

1957
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:15,240
Don't you dare.

1958
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:18,260
Birju!

1959
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:38,550
Ramu!

1960
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:40,340
Ramu!

1961
02:28:44,110 --> 02:28:45,210
Birju!

1962
02:28:45,740 --> 02:28:46,840
Birju!

1963
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:54,200
Birju!

1964
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:56,010
Birju!

1965
02:28:56,310 --> 02:28:57,410
Birju!

1966
02:28:58,190 --> 02:28:59,290
Birju!

1967
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:01,076
For the love of god,
please don't take her.

1968
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:02,600
- Leave me alone, mother.
- Birju!

1969
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:05,360
Birju! Birju! Birju!

1970
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:07,180
Kamla has only one child.

1971
02:29:07,290 --> 02:29:08,956
I won't let you snatch
someone's child...

1972
02:29:08,980 --> 02:29:11,240
because god will snatch my child.

1973
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:12,760
Birju!

1974
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:13,826
Birju!

1975
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:15,550
- Out of my way, mother!
- Birju!

1976
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:16,920
- Move, mother!
- Birju!

1977
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:20,130
Birju!

1978
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:25,820
Birju! Don't take Tulsi away!

1979
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:28,300
I've given my
word to the villagers.

1980
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:55,720
Here, mother.

1981
02:30:00,430 --> 02:30:08,430
Mother, your Birju
has kept your word.

1982
02:30:15,810 --> 02:30:23,560
God upheld your word.

1983
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:29,130
Mother...

1984
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:36,910
What have you done, mother?

1985
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:45,970
A woman gave her
word to the villagers.

1986
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:50,240
She fulfilled it.

1987
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,380
Kamla.

1988
02:30:58,600 --> 02:30:59,700
Here.

1989
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,320
Mother!

1990
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:07,300
God, you snatched
a son from his mother...

1991
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:11,150
to defend another woman's honor.

1992
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,780
Now defend the mother's dignity, too.

1993
02:31:17,130 --> 02:31:18,226
Mother!

1994
02:31:18,250 --> 02:31:19,350
Mother!

1995
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:24,580
- Mother! - Mother!
- Mother! - Mother!
