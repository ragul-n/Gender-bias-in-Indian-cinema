that we are trying to escape.

throw bets at each other.

has been sanctioned by your college.

Though he is not wealthy,
he must be very loving & caring.

104
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,695
He must love me so much that if l die,
he must build a Taj Mahal for me.

105
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,305
There are no funds to clean the
existing Taj Mahal. Another one?

head & l will give few strands only.

00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,657
Come l say.
- l won't come. You go.

177
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:15,183
He might be his friend.
- Yes. He's scared to ask you.

178
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,513
He is scared because
he made a mistake.

179
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,189
May be he made a mistake.

180
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,119
That's why l brought him
here to apologise.

181
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,353
Say sorry.

182
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,522
Say it.

183
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,858
Say it. Don't get scared.
l'm there with you.

184
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,364
The moment he sees girls...

185
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,865
He's too scared to even apologise.

186
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,669
Give me.
Take it.

187
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,377
l apologise on behalf of him.

189
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:52,949
She came in between
at the right time.

00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,388
Sorry. That girl was very beautiful.
l couldn't shout at her.

191
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,393
You don't know what to say & when.
You can never become a good writer.

192
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,997
You say that because you're angry.
- Get lost.

193
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,230
Where is he?
- Went to coffee bar.

194
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,896
Bar is fine.
Why coffee?

195
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,304
Take a snap of mine with them.

196

People won't believe
that even if l take one.

197
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,410
They would think it is doctored.

198
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,175
They are nothing. The girl who
scared our boys is too beautiful.

199
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,249
Then why did you come here.
You should've stayed there.

200
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,684

to fall in love or not.

Do you have any brain?

204
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,026
Can't you look after her for a minute?

205
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,632
l'm busy chatting with my sister.
What's there for you to peek through?

206
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,135
You're fit for nothing
except eating & drinking.

207
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,738
Find the one who
ate her chocolate.

208
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,465
lf you can't find him,
get lost.

209
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,968
l'll find him and
bring back your chocolate.

210
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:42,156
Hey, go slow.
Dhruv, l might fall down. Slowly...

211
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,503
Where did you go suddenly?
l thought of taking a snap.

212

ls it to garland my photo?

213
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,845
You ate the chocolate the moment
you saw it. He will devour me.

214
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,344
He is like one of those twin towers.

215
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,674
No matter how much ever l drink,
l don't feel the kick.

216
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,182
When looking at girls, no one looks
at biscuits & chocolates.

217
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,354
People look at girls by eating them.
- Now you know what fear is.

218
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,024
The one you are scared of is
different from the one l'm scared of.

219
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,957
One beer for this lean boy.
- And for you?

220
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,197
That's for me.
He just smells it.

221
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,363
Cancel it.

222
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,194
Let's check in first & then relax.

223
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,804
l can't carry the luggage.

224
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,534
Even l can't walk with
this luggage.

225
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,472
We had a bet long back but you're
still making me to carry yours.

00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,879
Buddy, you will lose anyway.
You're already exhausted.

Why do you waste your
energy unnecessarily?

229
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,785
Okay. What is the bet?

He is thinking like the great Einstein?

231
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,788
Shall we climb that one?

232
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,393
lt's not about climbing up & down.
Now l've a new scheme.

never let it fall down.

- Stay near the luggage.

Tell me who is first.

air hostess stops you.

You're still thinking about her.
But l've decided.

Liking someone
at first sight is fine.

How could you fall in
love at first sight?

Yes, he can fall in love.

concept is completely wrong.

He has brains. That's why
he understood my heart.

who had no idea about love.

whether he's really in love or not.

- First look.

adjusted her bag on the shoulder.

sending you out of the country?

coming for your engagement.

345
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,953
His love at first sight
gone at second sight.

346
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,583
l'll kick you.

347
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,991
The girl is going to lndia
for her engagement.

348
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,262
Girls are always like that, they free
just now and get engaged next.

349
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,165
Nobody knows it.
Very confusing.

350
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,512
Why should l forget her?

351
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,708
There's still 2 hours for
her to board the flight.

352
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,878
She must check in and board in
and enter the flight.

353
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,385
There's lot of time.

354
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,854
Anything can happen in that time.

355
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,186
She may like me also.

356
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,193
You may threaten and
convince someone,

357
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,993
You can't love and
convince someone.

358
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,102
l've hope, help me or not but
please don't discourage me.

359
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,797
How can we encourage
impossible things?

360
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,810
Let it happen or not, l'll make a try,
got any idea, buddies?

361
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,592
lt's not an idea but l'll tell you
eight segment formula.

362
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,657
Go ahead!

363
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,895
We take around a year or two to follow
a girl and propose love to her,

364
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,032
l've shrunk the two years
into two hours,

365
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,865
First 15 minutes,
you must see the girl,

366
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,668
Exchange looks,

367
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:12,510
Next 15 minutes, talk to her somehow,
and develop little friendship,

368
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:17,981
Third 15 minutes, do something good and
create an impression of a gentleman,

369
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,650
Fourth 15 minutes,
take her to a cinema or a coffee,

370
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:29,094
Fifth 15 minutes, flirt a little,
make her enjoy your company,

371
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,028
Okay?

372
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:36,037
Sixth 15 minutes, she must come
to you and talk to you freely.

373
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,941
Seventh 15 minutes, make your colourful
background much colourful to her,

374
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,977
And make her feel you're
the most eligible bachelor.

375
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,048
Eighth, this is the most important one,

376
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,380
You must select good romantic
moment and propose to her.

377
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,445
What an idea!

378
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,718
Great!

379
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,852
You're all brains!

380
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,566
One minute, he said to do many things,
but never said how to do it?

381
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,505
l just showed you a direction,
you must find the way yourself.

382
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,975
Whatever it is, l feel it is possible.

383
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,507
Then, come with me.

384
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,339
A moment lost in this
love thriller is danger.

385
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,847
lf anything goes wrong in
this thrilling love story,

386
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,451
lt's you who dies in the end.

387
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,146
l'll stay away.
- You'll not come.

388
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:29,189
You'll experiment your ideas
on others to know the result.

389
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,922
Come...
- Leave me.

390
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,524
How to talk to her?

391
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,074
l'll start with headache.

392
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:59,518
l went around, right?
l feel giddy...

393
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,021
Got any tablet...

394
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,937
Will it give immediate relief?

395
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,741
lt's first time for me.

396
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,608
Never took a tablet till now.

397
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,178
You want water?

398
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,154
Any other pain?
- Other pain?

399
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,587
Why did he leave suddenly?

400
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:39,956
May be because of head ache?

401
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,266
She's very reserved, doesn't talk much.

402
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,838
Not reserved but hesitant
to talk to strangers.

403
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,734
She'll talk if she gets
to know properly.

404
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,402
Will it take 6 months for
her to know properly?

405
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,510
l think she'll take minimum 3 months.

406
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,441
Then, be prepared.

407
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,580
May be we need to kidnap her for
3 to 6 months if it is necessary.

408
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,247
No, talk to her even if she
talks to you or not.

409
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:13,260
He'll interpret her silence for you.
Let's follow till she understands it.

410
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,230
But please remove the ideas of
kidnap and murder from your mind.

411
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,695
l convinced you in 2 seconds,

412
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:24,032
But l've 2 full hours
to convince her,

413
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,540
l'll make her turn towards
me in that time.

414
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,942
Do something quickly,
the first segment time is elapsing.

415
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,716
Hey you lean,
don't rise my tension.

416
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,114
Take this tablet,
l'll think up something.

417
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:43,057
lf a girl walks here and there,
one can meet her often accidentally.

418
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,654
How?

419
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,547
What do you want?

420
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,914
No relief from pain.
Can l get one more tablet?

421
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,181
Can't you ask that straight?
Will pain get relieved if you sit there?

422
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,952
l don't know you much,
l didn't want to disturb you often.

423
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,823
Do you want to know us for tablets
or asking tablets to know about us?

424
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,093
No, know you for tablet...
to know you...

425
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,169
Give him the entire strip.

426

427

when l got last

428
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,915
May be it was 7 years ago

429
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,747
l got it suddenly now,

430
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:49,621
l get it quite often, useless
conversations give me the most.

431
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,893
Take 5 or 6 at a time,
your head will go away.

432
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,696
Bye.

433
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,803
She looks like a villain to me,
who is she?

434
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,066
Why is he still rubbing his forehead?

435
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,039
What happened?
Not responding?

436
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,973
Yes, little stubborn.

l don't know about her but
the girl sitting next to her,

00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,951
She's a carnivore,
we'll be on her dinner table.

441
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,489
Yes, not only her body language
but also her language is agressive.

442
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,489
Yes.

443
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:28,664
Hey! Why is he coming so aggressively?
Hold it, l'm going away!

l put the kerchief there first, right?

Where do such people come from?

Why to fuss so much for this?

457
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,007
Go away!

You...

464
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,485
You're giving more tension
than my love for her.

465
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,215

instead of giving me tension.

third segments right now.

Stay with Kailash, okay?
- Okay.

Chocolates will increase the headache.

lt's not for her but for me.

00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,235
You should never eat chocolates.

Will you please give these chocolates
to some old lady in lndia?

00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,789
He used to give it personally
when he was alive,

My grandpa doesn't like foreigners.

515
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,650
For the next step you need to
know how you impressed her.

516
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,254
Only then we can go further.

517
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,917
A small idea.

518
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,753
lt may not be decent
but l'm sure it'll work out.

519
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,254
Think carefully and tell me,
if you put me in trouble, you're gone.

520
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,660
Will you finish him?
You tell me.

521
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,562
l'll make a call to your cell phone,

522
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,534
Switch on the speaker and
keep it secretly near them,

523
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,333
From then on we can hear
their conversation.

524
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,935
You say you did impress her,
so they'll surely talk about you,

525
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,910
We can think about next plan then.

526
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,516
ldea is good but l'll not
keep the phone there.

527
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,116
What?
- You come...

528
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,880
l'll not come...
- You come man...

529
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,457
You sit here only, no matter how much
he may over act, don't get up.

530
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,457
Wait.

531
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,793
Why is he so thin
like a dried jelly fish?

532
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,965
By any chance, would he fight
like Bruce Lee?

533
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,835
Easy prey!

534
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,807
l can manage him easily.

535
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,986
He's okay...

536
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,058
What about you man?

537
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,793
Should l fear you also?

538
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,225
Come near me.

539
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,298
You fool!

540
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,061
Hey, take this!

541
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,455
l'll divert her attention,
you silently keep the phone.

542
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,682
And slip out.

543
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,487
Do it carefully.
Or else we'll be in soup.

544
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:23,098
l warned you but forced me to come
an hour earlier and l'm bored now.

545
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,945
l think this head ache will hover
around me till l board the flight.

546
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,723
What does he think of himself?
James Bond?

547
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,655
To flatter girls.

548
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,691
Leave it, Sandhya.

549
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,386
Thank God, we are flying in
a different flight.

550
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,624
lf it had been same flight,
he would come and sit in my lap.

551
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,800
Hey Kailash...what...

552
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,299
l'll eat the chocolates he gave
immediately on boarding the flight,

553
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,634
Does he think we'll believe
his stupid stories.

554
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,113
Boys are like that only,
you don't get angry so much.

555
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,477
That thin boy is very irritating.

556
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,982
He and his lousy hairstyle,

557
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,314
l don't know if he's wearing clothes or
clothes are carrying him inside.

558
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,120
lf l get him alone, l'll fold him
and keep in his own pouch.

559
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,264
That third one isn't seen much
but he's a big flirt.

560
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,832
Hey, they are watching us.

561
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,602
How long can we sit here?
Come, let's take a stroll.

562
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,433
There's photo exhibition going on.

563
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,802
My legs are paining after walking
long distance, l'll not come.

564
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,602
Okay, l'll go alone.

565
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,705
Now you've to start
from second segment,

566
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,713
You passed only the first segment,
and failed all other segments.

567
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,943
Already it's time to
take her to a coffee.

568
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,412
No more second and third segment,
l'm going straight to coffee segment.

569
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,425
Thin boy, you smile and
you keep the phone.

570
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,767
Going to the final segment is the best,
matter is settled in a minute.

571
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,401
How?
- Say l love you.

572
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,196
Got it?
- You bloody!

573
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,876
l spilled your coffee little while ago,

574
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,380
So a coffee for you with sorry.

575
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,020
This is for your friend,
l think she's not here.

576
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,658
No problem, you take it.

577
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,160
This is yours.

578
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,368
l think you too love
travelling like me.

579
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:46,304
l travelled in Malaysian Airlines,
Singapore Airlines, and this one...

580
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,704
Almost every airline.

581
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,210
Except lndian Airlines and Air lndia.

582
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,407
Coffee isn't good in any other airline.

583
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,755
Not in your flight too.

584
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:05,191
Atleast take it and throw it away,
l'll have satisfaction of giving it to you.

585
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,093
Can l also have it?

586
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,503
Your coffee, your wish.

587
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,506
You talk very little.

588
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,502
Can l say something
if you don't mind?

589
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:28,547
Though you talk very little,
they are hard hitting like slaps.

590
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,890
l talk to strangers like that only.

591
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,120
My name is Dhruv and
l'm from Hyderabad.

592
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,731
My friends are Kailash and Raman.

593
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,395
My father's name is Krishna Rao,
and mother's name is lndira.

594
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,966
What are you called
as in your home?

595
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,275
Thanks for the coffee.

596
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,277
Time to check in, bye.

597
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,352
After knowing about my details,

598
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:10,891
The few words you spoke
to me were very sweet.

599
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,504
Oh no! Why is he coming with him?

600
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,376
Hello, it's me Harish.
- Tell me.

601
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,280
Will you send the fashion story you
wrote for Shahrukh Khan in Telugu,

602
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,681
My friend wants to make a film,

603
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,379
Emotions aren't easy
to catch on paper,

604
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,114
l'll narrate you the short version,

605
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,189
l'll send the script later,

606
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,122
Then talk to him straight,

607
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:52,629
The basic point is the villain plans
to bomb one place but misplaces it,

608
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,463
Hero's family is wiped out,
revenge starts

609
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,970
Film starts with a big bomb blast,

610
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,768
A peacock comes out from the fire
with fully spread wings.

611
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:04,105
Peacock?- A little boy comes
walking behind the peacock,

612
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:10,275
The kid who comes tottering, picks
a bomb and throws it on next city,

613
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,613
Again a big blast,

614
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,290
Entire screen is on fire with bomb blasts
and strewn with dead bodies,

615
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,424
All are dead, sir,

616
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,218
Rain starts in slow motion,

617
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,656
Blood is spilling out sir.

618
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,921
ls the boy safe, sir?

619
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,794
Amidst the fire and peacock's cries,
our titles roll out sir,

620
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,834
'Ugranaram', the man with muscle!

621
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,871
We cut here and after 40 years,

622
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:36,569
The day we stopped teaching school children
about morals, justice, and duty.

623
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,305
Women don't have any protection,
Men don't have courage,

624
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,815
Animals don't have shelter,
All are living alike then,

625
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,386
People expect someone
will come and save them,

626
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,924
After few days their desires turn into despairs,
and they all decide to migrate to US,

627
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:54,585
ln that great depression,
suddenly there's a change in the atmosphere,

628
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,890
Hero makes his entry.

629
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,828
Sun hides behind the clouds,

630
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,262
The new dawn breaks open,

631
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,165
When hero re-enters,

632
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,102
When hero walks on land,
clouds make way in the sky,

633
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,276
You can use few bombs
there for effect,

634
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,375
No need of any logic,

635
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,706
When he walks, electric poles short circuit
and a transformer blasts off,

636
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:16,146
Lower your voice, l think he understands
only bombs and blasts in the story.

637
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,184
You go away man,
you carry on sir.

638
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,788
ln that confusion,
even blind started to see,

639
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,219
Offered sacrifices in all the worlds,

640
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,555
Tata Sumos, AK-47's, local bombs...
- l think it's better to stop now.

641
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,125
Signals are weak here,
l'll call you later sir.

642
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,700
What happened next sir?
- Lower your voice sir.

643
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,572
lf you cut here...
- Wow! Friends already?

644
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,069
No clarity.

645
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,513
You've been talking so closely.

646
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,149
Story discussion,
didn't want to trouble others.

647
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,245
l passed the coffee segment successfully.

648
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,920
Just now we started to talk.

649
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,723
Already lost 5 minutes
in the fifth segment.

650
00:54:55,692 --> 00:55:00,026
l'll also check in along with them
and wait on the other side.

651
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,855
Victory be ours!

652
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,426
Please carry on sir,
with deadly weapons...

653
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,972
With deadly weapons, villain's gangs
start chasing hero waving hands.

654
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,731
Hero who is standing a mile away,

655
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,774
He comes to know they are notjeeps
but bullets to kill him,

656
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,607
He flattens the tyres with his breathe.

657
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,750
Villain gets irritated and throws
a big bomb on the hero,

658
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:24,419
Hero dives to catch it and
squeezes it with his hands.

659
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:29,649
What? Catches a bomb?
Squeezes with bare hands?

660
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,885
Super! Theatre will go blast!

661
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,963
Can you come with us sir?

662
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,468
No need to fear sir.
Just a general check up.

663
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,002
We'll clarify in office
if you've any doubt.

664
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,644
What? Do you've power to
arrest an lndian?

665
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,443
He didn't use the word arrest,
please don't complicate the case.

666
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,081
Why is he scaring us?

667
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,978
Are we terrorists to get scared off?

668
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,277
Bloody fools!

669
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,234
ls it that serious matter?

670
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,668
Then, we'll follow you, come on boys.
Come.

671
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:22,908
lf l say it happened because of you,
won't you stop?

672
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,448
You said your flight is at 9 pm,
what would you do sitting inside?

673
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,676
l just wanted to buy in
the duty free shops.

674
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:33,815
l think he'll not leave us.

675
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,686
Do you want to marry?

676
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,226
Not me...l asked generally.

677
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,298
l find your face glowing
with marriage blushes.

678
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,527
Don't know, l may marry.

679
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,136
Love marriage?
- No.

680
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,771
lf we see someone, we must feel
like spending time with them.

681
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,378
We must feel elated and
must enjoy their company,

682
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,205
Only then we can be very happy.

683
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,510
lf it has to happen,
we ought to know each other a little.

684
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,277
Didn't you feel like that
after meeting someone?

685
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,287
Near your home?

686
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:08,887
ln college?

687
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,759
What about in this airport?

688
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,659
Look at him!

689
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,064
Fair, bulky, sweet and dull.

690
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,534
What if you feel like
marrying him suddenly?

691
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,799
l'll not feel.

692
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,141
May be you'll feel in future?

693
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,773
Don't agree for an arranged
marriage suddenly?

694
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,415
And never marry anyone from US.

695
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,017
lf you ever feel like seeing your mother,

696
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,620
All you can do is to watch on webcam
and nothing else you can do.

697
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:43,725
Marriage is not a decision to change
at will on seeing someone.

698
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,029
There are many things
to think about,

699
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,722
Will he understand me?
Will he help me in my career?

700
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,334
Will he look after me very well?
Like that...

701
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:09,675
[ -= DDR =- ]

702
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:39,815
Why? How then?

703
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,388
He's asking about marriage...

704
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:52,990
You come.

705
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,720
May be it's very important.

706
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:09,407
Harika! Read this!

707
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,347
Read this!

708
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,801
Your story has touched my creative nerve.

709
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,443
Did any research in the same line?

710
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,512
Will you please tell us
what's happening?

711
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:49,549
My uncle works with lndian High Commission,
please inquire about us with him sir.

712
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,456
Actually l was narrating a story.

713
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,785
The film's title is...
- 'Ugra Naram'

714
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,894
You can call him as Tiger's son.

715
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,860
What's this? l didn't tell all this.

716
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,626
l added it myself for action.

717
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,247
Don't get emotional, sir.

718
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,354
Won't you believe our Tiger man?

719
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,252
We are lndians, you've to believe it.

720
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:40,997
No...no...

721
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,406
You keep quiet sir, you don't know
the pulse of the audience.

722
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,041
What do you know sir?
l'm explaining it to him, right?

723
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,945
What's this man?- He's narrating
your story better than you.

724
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:58,684
How is it possible logically?

725
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,356
What is logic?
Why are you talking about logic?

726
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:02,854
Bloody logic.

727
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,361
We don't know who is he sir.

728
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,192
Are we not friends?

729
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,528
Ask the Tiger man.

730
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,642
Return my passport also sir.

731
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,873
Why to that room sir?

732
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,589
Bloody idiot!

733
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:46,435
Where are you guys?

734
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,264
Just now they released us
from the police station.

735
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,234
Where are you now?

736
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,841
Just now l too got released out.

737
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,233
Come to the smoking zone.

738
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,840
Why delay? Let's inquire.

739
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,009
Are we travelling free
to take us at their will?

740
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,124
What can they do if weather is bad?

741
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,129
Think it's good for us, come.

742
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,705
They stole most precious
an hour and half from my life,

743
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,049
She would be flying now
forgetting about me.

744
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,387
You met her an hour earlier and
will remember for an hour more,

745
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,555
you'll forget her after that.

746
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,890
Shall we cancel tickets to lndia
and fly to Singapore?

747
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:42,819
What do you say?

748
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,994
l'm totally confused
hearing your tales,

749
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,058
Please do something.

750
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,560
Okay, let's think coolly
after a visit to the toilet.

751
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,240
Get caught or else l'll kill you.
- l'll push him.

752
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,173
Catch him...stop him...

753
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,517
l'm not in mood, let's go back to lndia.
Don't want to go to Singapore.

754
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,091
We have lot of time for our flight,
let's go out.

755
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,929
You carry on, l'll wait near
the boarding lounge.

756
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:24,688
l don't feel like coming out.

757
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,930
l don't think it's good idea
to leave him alone.

758
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,505
He's disturbed and
may harm himself.

759
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,172
Are you saying right?

760
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:36,871
Can't you see his mannerisms?

761
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,277
l don't know if you're good at Psychology
or not but you do scare us a lot.

762
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,279
Hey Dhruv! Stop!

763
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,120
Catch it.
- Stop!

764
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,962
What did you scribble on the trolley?

765
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,035
What man?
Why isn't anyone coming in?

766
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,706
Why did you leave me alone here?

767
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,807
Are you scared of me?
Why are you scared?

768
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,985
Already so many farmers have committed
suicide unable to bear hunger.

769
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,254
But are you planning to
murder people also?

770
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,488
l don't care anyone!

771
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,489
But before l die,

772
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:33,158
...l'll die only after killing 5 people.

773
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,064
l know that.

774
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:39,268
l know you're listening
what l'm saying now,

775
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:46,003
where are you listening it,
behind this wall, or this wall or top?

776
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,351
be it anywhere,
you come out l say!

777
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,286
Let's settle it...
have you come?

778
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,711
They are my friends...
we meet often in meetings.

779
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:32,550
Oh fate! My fate!
ls his photo also in it?

780
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,902
lf anyone reads what you wrote,
ghosts will fall in love with you,

781
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:51,909
...not girls!

782
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,815
l'm not a writer like you,
l wrote it in a hurry.

783
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,585
There's no witness for my love,
will you become one?

784
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,421
or only truth is exchanged
between hearts,

785
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,251
will you make me
a part of your heart?

786
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,927
l've so many lines like that
ask me if you want next time.

787
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:06,685
My foot!

788
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:10,090
lf girls read what you said,
they will turn into ghosts.

789
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:19,765
Here...

790
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,716
l think he's very disturbed as you said.

791
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,285
You were trying to say
something little while ago.

792
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,624
l wanted to know what it was.

793
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,052
For my sake...

794
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,134
He wants to buy something...
- You go.

795
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,065
You're over reacting in excitement.

796
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,632
We'll go to the shop.

797
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:54,142
You..?

798
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,744
Our flight got delayed and
we were just roaming aimlessly.

799
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,406
l saw you here suddenly.

800
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,477
Just want to know if it's important.

801
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,644
Nothing important, just said bye.

802
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,484
You wrote something on the trolley...

803
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,886
l saw you writing something.
- Did you?

804
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,260
l was playing scribbling
something on the trolley.

805
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:20,497
You're hesitating to come out.

806
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,006
No...no...actually
what l mean to say is...

807
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:37,242
[ -= DDR =- ]

808
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,356
Not this one, some other trolley.

809
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:50,193
But still, why are you
scared of scribbling?

810
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,861
No, l wrote happy journey.
That's all.

811
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,865
lf it was your message,
why not say it?

812
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,371
l scribbled as well as
wished you happy journey.

813
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:00,469
Shall we go?

814
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,809
Here comes the pain.

815
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,882
l asked if you'd forgotten anything
to say with chocolates.

816
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,380
But you're floundering now,
it means you've written something.

817
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,716
No, l'll only compliment,
l never pass comments.

818
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:19,825
Don't worry, l'll not feel bad for it.

819
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,080
That couple look like lovers to me.

820
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,308
Do you see anything in the
world in some language?

821
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:44,747
They could be friends, right?

822
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,989
Watch now, their bodies touch and
then legs will come closer.

823
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:48,986
That's body language.

824
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,486
l think his body has no language.

825
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,098
l think he's languishing between
tension and fright.

826
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,432
What sir?
Did they release you so early?

827
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,769
l thought they will keep you for
some time seeing your creativity.

828
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,536
Who are you?

829
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,275
Did they give him any electric shock?

830
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,607
May be used Narco test to get
truth from him. ln that shock...

831
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,116
You said you don't know me
a little while ago.

832
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,286
l forgot you in tension,
now l remember you sir.

833
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,684
Hands off me, l'm tensed now,
so l don't know who you are.

834
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:22,619
How about him?

835
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,629
What about him? What about this man?
What's all this nonsense?

836
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,397
Flights getting delayed,
we meeting again,

837
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,969
l think all this magic has been created
by God exclusively for us.

838
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,144
Few more moments and
we would've become good friends.

839
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,812
But that Judo came in at the
right time to take her away.

840
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,915
Tell me if Judo comes next time,
let's send our He Man!

841
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,209
One shot and you'll get amnesia,
l'm serious.

842
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,646
Yes, he must tell us where he
punched us after he punches.

843
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,582
Hey you stop...
- Are you making fun of me?

844
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,393
l'm telling you seriously
and you're having fun.

845
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,993
Okay, tell me
what's the next plan?

846
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,830
l got little time to propose,
so l told her l wrote happy journey.

847
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:10,835
Good.

848
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,403
But she's not believing it,
she thinks l wrote something else.

849
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,601
Anyone would get doubt seeing your
expressions just a while ago.

850
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,006
So l'll draw few lines and
write happy journey on a trolley.

851
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,844
You bring the trolley before that girl.

852
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:26,686
l'll join her coming from behind.

853
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,687
l'll act like l saw the trolley unexpectedly,
and start the conversation.

854
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,851
Your idea is good, why draw lines?
She may think you're confused.

855
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,189
Draw some good design.

856
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,528
Already l told her that in confusion,

857
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,701
lf l change the design now,
she may get confused.

858
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:41,967
Silly lines is perfect
for your silly love.

859
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,367
Bloody!
- Stop it.

860
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,708
Let's split up here and
take three directions,

861
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,706
call me immediately
on seeing her.

862
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:01,719
Oh my God!

863
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,051
You...?!

864
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,391
You said you don't know me,
why did you come to me again?

865
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,894
l left the story midway,
l want to continue it.

866
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,499
Continue? l went through hell
for half story.

867
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,565
l don't know what will happen
if l listen full story.

868
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,394
l don't want to hear it.

869
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:19,567
Villain gets scared after seeing the hero
squeezing a bomb with bare hands,

870
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,141
comes to hero says sorry and
promises never to do it again.

871
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,075
Hero says, it's okay and hugs him.

872
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,077
They become friends.

873
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,253
Just a minute sir.

874
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,348
What?
- l found Harika.

875
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,684
She's between duty free
liquor shop and gold city.

876
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,590
Come immediately.
- l'm coming.

877
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,760
Villain who goes to hero's home coffee,
slips and falls down,

878
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:46,764
and forgets his past,

879
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:51,036
he gets up to beat the hero thinking he's
enemy forgetting that he's a friend now.

880
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,708
Hero gets confused seeing this
and unable to do anything...

881
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,447
...he goes like this
and escapes.

882
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,777
Then...? l'll continue
after l finish running.

883
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,384
How long will he run?

884
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,789
Always leaves midway,
don't know what's wrong with him.

885
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,725
Can you take me to him?

886
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,730
Your friend is a thief.

887
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,403
ls he a thief?

888
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,798
ln this 1000 acre airport...

889
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,804
But he doesn't look like a thief.

890
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:33,748
Anyway, why should l bother about him?

891
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,501
Why is he staring at me?

892
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,171
ls he watching me only?

893
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,339
l don't want any trouble.

894
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:10,417
How did he attract this big man's ire?

895
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,677
l thing it's better to leave this place.

896
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:24,027
Escape from here...
he's following me...l'll just check...

897
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,040
Won't he leave me?

898
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,371
Thank God! Go sir.

899
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,386
Hey Judo is in deep sleep here.

900
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,392
Harika is not here.
- Harika is here. Stay with Judo.

901
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,395
l don't know how you do it,
ensure that Judo doesn't come here.

902
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,398
How can l stop her?
Send Kailash here.

903
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,572
l've a job here for Kailash.
Do this for me, cut the call.

904
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,594
Keep it perfectly, she mustn't
feel we had arranged it.

905
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:30,590
Be careful!

906
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,620
l think we must stop saying hi!

907
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,284
As if we are the only people
in the airport.

908
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,124
l was also about to say it, we needn't
have to say hi or thank you.

909
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,130
Because we are close...

910
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:14,804
...l mean we feel like close...
passengers.

912
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,763
They are awesome but little short.

913
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,129
l'm filming for their hairstyles.

914
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,031
ls it your hobby?
- My profession.

915
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,533
l'm doing masters in
Hair and beauty technology.

916
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,368
Wow! l've done MBA.

917
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:22,368
After doing...?

918
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:23,372
After doing...

919
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,373
...didn't do anything yet.

920
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,549
lt doesn't mean l'll do nothing.
l told you l love travelling.

921
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:40,893
May be l'll open a holiday resort or
something connected with tourism.

922
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,393
But still...Oh no!

923
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,399
His hairstyle is not good.

924
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,900
There's no perfect plan,

925
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,913
l may get an idea today
and it may change tomorrow,

926
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:01,076
l want something new everyday.

927
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,477
Completely opposite.

928
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,413
There will not be any may be
in my life like in yours.

929
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,086
Everything is planned.

930
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,745
Next is marrying and then opening
a chain of beauty parlours.

931
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:13,417
Like opposite poles attract each other,
we have become close friends, right?

932
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,756
Just now you said passengers
and now you say we are friends.

933
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,847
This is the trolley on which
l wrote happy journey.

934
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,851
These scribbling were written by me.

935
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:44,857
lsn't it very obvious that your friend
wrote & pushed it to catch my attention?

936
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,958
Did you felt like that?

937
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,458
lt's screw is lose,
it came rolling here.

938
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:53,291
l felt like that.

939
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,461
Fallen in love and
has been reciprocated too...

940
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,405
Why is the heart still scared of love?

941
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:03,968
Tell me.

942
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,806
Shall we have lunch?
- Okay.

943
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,978
lt's lunch time, shall we have lunch?

944
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:13,885
l'm not hungry.

945
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,893
Unnecessarily l rushed off.

946
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,093
What? Did she believe you?

947
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,658
How can she?
Does it look like believable?

948
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:28,002
lf she had believed this, l would've
gone looking for another girl.

949
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,668
l think l went little overboard.
- Not little, look there.

950
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,009
She over acted like
your story's hero,

951
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,677
beat the bald man not me.

952
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,184
Bald man did nothing wrong,
you did...

953
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:45,847
What happened man?

954
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,352
l think he's having fever.

955
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,916
ls it salt or pepper?

956
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,591
l'm sure it's pepper.

957
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,131
ln this small world,
in this smaller airport,

958
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:06,872
we are bumping into each other
though we don't want to.

959
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:10,711
Are you following me?

960
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,479
You said you weren't hungry,
l think you're following me.

961
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,212
When is your flight scheduled?
- An hour and half more.

962
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:23,550
My flight is at night 8 pm.
l'm getting bored.

963
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:24,892
Shall we play a game?

964
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,394
What games can you play with us?
- l think you love war games.

965
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,829
We play soft games
like dumb shellers.

966
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,568
Everytime packing bags,
catching a taxi,

967
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,834
coming to airport,
wait for the flight.

968
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,244
l played dumb shellers
as a little girl.

969
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,741
Let's divide ourselves
into two teams,

970
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:55,246
my team member will whisper a word
into the ears of your team member,

971
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,426
without talking to each other,
without showing anything,

972
01:19:58,627 --> 01:19:59,594
you must act and show it.

973
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,095
lf you fail to do it...

974
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,766
You say your team,
are we not in the same team?

975
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,936
lf you're in the same team,
there may be match fixing,

976
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,604
we mixed up the team.

977
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,266
l think you're principled
like your grandpa.

978
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,604
l think so.
Shall we start?

979
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:17,369
Where are your friends?

980
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,605
lf you say yes, they'll be
here in a flash.- Okay.

981
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,448
Excuse me, a request,

01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,113

l think he'll live few more days.

983
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,288
Turn...
- Turn this side man.

984
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:36,630
Look!

985
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,798
Hold this.
- Bloody, l'll kick you.

986
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,805
Losers must buy coffee
to the winners.

Auspicious thread!

- But l don't want to play anymore.

''l'll marry you only''?

You were murmuring something.
- Nothing.

You called me a friend a while ago.
Did you fall in love so soon?

But you think about it
with a cool mind.

1016
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,544
Neither there is anything
to be tensed about

1017

nor is there anything to think about.

1018

Forget about this right away.

Do you know me?

- You're lying.

1022

Whether l'm lying or trying to escape
from you is none of your business.

1023
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,727
You expressed your feeling.
Good.

1024
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,223
But this is my feeling.
l'm not interested.

1029

Her behaviour is little confusing.

You only understand happy
and sad gestures.

1031
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:25,919
She said ''No'' & left angrily.

That's normal.

1033
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:28,922
We must fear only if she had said ''Yes''.

1034
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:32,251
Did l struggle so hard to get a ''No''?

1035
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:33,659
Next step is ''Yes''.

1036
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,863
She has only 2 options.
Yes or No.

1037
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,189
She has said ''No''.

1038

She has no other choice
other than saying ''Yes''.

understand his logic.

Someone with a horrific face is
chasing me all over the airport.

lf l tell him that you're here,
my tension will reduce.

1196
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:53,845
No matter how far you may go...

1197
01:40:55,049 --> 01:41:04,014
l always remain close to you...

1198
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:18,036
Can a shadow be separated?

[ -= DDR =- ]

1200
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:48,558
lt's confirmed that
l'm not myself anymore...

1201
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:00,903
l knew this change is
all because of you...

1202
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:10,488
When will you turn towards me?

1203
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:18,588
ls happiness waiting for that moment?

1204
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:28,606
Will she leave me without
becoming my love?

1205
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:38,445
l walk where my heart takes me to...

1206
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:48,455
Will it have the courage
to break the ice?

1207
01:42:49,029 --> 01:43:01,305
Will this journey of love end here?

1208
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,987
Thank God! They have made
the announcement. Let's go.

1209
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,655
Just 5 more minutes.

1210

[ -= DDR =- ]

1211
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:42,513
When you die, l'll build
a Taj Mahal for you.

1212
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:44,674
l love you so much.

1213
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:49,185
All my stories have happy endings.
No tragedies.

1214
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:53,750
Since she is thinking about
you all the time,

1215
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:56,129
you have made an impact for sure.

1216
01:43:56,396 --> 01:44:01,595
But we can create time.
Atleast if l had 1 more day.

1217
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,460
You still have 20 minutes more.

1218
01:44:09,509 --> 01:44:12,706
There are few questions relating
to your tastes & interests.

1219
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,540
Your answers must match with mine.

1220
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,213
Wait...

1221
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:21,983
lt's enough if 50% matches
for a husband & wife.

1222
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:24,552
Both will adjust the remaining 50%.

1223
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:26,225
But this is an extra ordinary situation.

1224
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,951
100% should match.
Only then l will take a chance.

1225
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:30,322
1000% will match.

1226
01:44:32,232 --> 01:44:34,996
Don't be so over confident.
Only a miracle can save you the day.

1227
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:37,170
lt will happen, for sure.
Because all my life...- Why?

1228
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,732
l was born on 7th of July.

1229
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:42,738
When l was in 7th std.,
l stood first entire academic year.

1230
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,911
My bike number is 7.
My car number is 77.

1231
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,079
Your cell number must also be 7.

1232
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,313
And you're my 7th lover.

1233
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:59,248
l was over confident that
l would pass, so l said that...

1234
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,588
He must show her all the
7 wonders of the world.

1235
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:05,695
Give me that paper.

1236
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,160
l was justjoking.

1237
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,262
Those 6 girls were only
attracted towards me.

1238
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:13,098
Aishwarya Rai, when l was young.
Kareena Kapoor, when l was growing up.

1239
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:15,104
Then it was Fair & lovely model.

1240
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:18,272
A lady constable,
when l was in my 10th class.

1241
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:23,107
lt's not about that.
l want to add some more questions.

1242
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,342
Once the question paper is given, you're
supposed to take only the answer sheet.

1243
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:26,280
You're not suppose to take
the question paper back.

1244
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:27,510
l'll reduce the number of questions.

1245
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,850
No...don't open it.

1246
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:45,202
ls your lucky number 7?

1247
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:49,798
lt was. Not now. Still 15 minutes.
l'll wait in the coffee shop.

1248
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:59,880
Harika, today's date is also 7.
- You only have 14 minutes.

1249
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:06,492
What if the girl you love leaves you?

1250
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:07,986
a. Die

1251
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,389
b. Kill her

1252
01:46:10,764 --> 01:46:12,493
c. Spend life with her memories.

1253
01:46:12,933 --> 01:46:14,491
d. Find another girl.

1254
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:16,897
She is bang on point.

1255
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:21,168
Choosing a or b will prove that
you're have a weak mind.

1256
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,843
lf you choose to find another girl,
she would brand you a fickle minded.

1257
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,512
Timely question.
Very intelligent girl.

1258
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:29,841
Love & sacrifice go hand in hand.
No bullshit or no fickle mind.

1259
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,017
Choose option c.

1260
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,947
Thinking that you're a Devdass,
she will love you instantly.

1261
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:34,620
l will neither die nor kill her.

1262
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:37,352
l will never think about the girl
who has left me.

1263
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,026
l love her whole heartedly.

1264
01:46:40,427 --> 01:46:43,828
But if l don't get what l want,
l will not be disappointed.

1265
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:45,861
l will be in pain for a while.

1266
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:48,830
Later l will find another girl.
- Well said.

1267
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:50,970
Tick 'D'.

1268
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:54,031
Let me read the 2nd question.

1269
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:56,572
lf you have the TV remote,
what will you watch?

1270
01:46:57,277 --> 01:46:58,869
a. News, b. Serials,
c. Sports, d. Music.

1271
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,774
c. sports.
- Stop it.

1272
01:47:00,981 --> 01:47:03,142
lt might look easy & simple question.

1273
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,317
But actually it is a very tough question.

1274
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:06,247
Yes. lt is an emotional question.

1275
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:08,250
Every channel captures an emotion.

1276
01:47:08,455 --> 01:47:12,084
Your choice will make her decide
your character.

1277
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:13,623
Yes. Let's do one thing.

1278
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:15,488
Most of the girls like serials.

1279
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:18,789
Whether you like it or not,
choose serials to match her wavelength.

1280
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,557
Do you want me to lie?

1281
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:22,257
Are you heir of Mahatma Gandhi?

1282
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:24,164
Even 1000 lies are okay
for a marriage.

1283
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:27,534
l don't want to succumb to
1000 serials by telling one lie.

1284
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:40,918
What?

1285
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:42,084
What do you want?

1286
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,756
You're tall & well built.

1287
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:48,287
But when l was young,
l was taller than you.

1288
01:47:48,495 --> 01:47:49,655
What do you think of yourself?

1289
01:47:55,368 --> 01:48:00,169
You pig face!
You bear! l will kill you.

1290
01:48:00,373 --> 01:48:01,635
Who do you think you are?

1291
01:48:05,745 --> 01:48:07,144
Why did l say ''Bomb''?

1292
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:09,905
Hope no one heard me.

1293
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:16,715
What?

1294
01:48:17,224 --> 01:48:18,816
Why are you standing infront me?

1295
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:20,556
Do you think l will get scared?

1296
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,387
Hey you...

1297
01:48:22,596 --> 01:48:24,325
Where are you taking me to?

1298
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:27,866
Where are you taking me to?

1299
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:31,465
l think Harika likes sports.
l will choose sports.

1300
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:32,160
Are you sure?

1301
01:48:32,372 --> 01:48:34,397
No more discussions.
Please.

1302
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:40,842
When you're free at home,
what would you like to do?

1303
01:48:41,047 --> 01:48:43,379
a. Gardening, b. Cooking
c. Marketing, d. Cleaning

1304
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:48,248
Did she give me the question
paper meant for a servant?

1305
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:49,887
Marriage is not a joke.

1306
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:51,682
When you have children,
you need to clean them.

1307
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:54,849
l'll choose cooking.

1308
01:48:55,061 --> 01:48:56,585
She will dislike my cooking
if she eats twice.

1309
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:11,469
l beg you.

1310
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:13,006
Don't hold it tight.

1311
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:16,612
Where the hell did l find you?

1312
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:22,521
What did he steal from you?
Tell me.

1313
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:25,520
l'll buy you that.
That's much better than this.

1314
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:29,725
What will you do if you have Rs. 100?

1315
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,091
a. Spend it fully
b. Save fully

1316
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:36,292
c. Spend half & save half
d. Give it to wife.

1317
01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:39,602
What will we get for Rs. 100?

1318
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:41,706
Stop it.

1319
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:44,399
Others might think that we are
selling something here.- No.

1320
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:45,873
What will Harika do with Rs.100...

1321
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,309
We were talking about you.
100 years.

1322
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:49,311
Haven't you finished it yet?

1323
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:51,575
Finish it quickly.
lt's getting late.

1324
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:53,581
We can't understand your questions properly.

1325
01:49:53,787 --> 01:49:56,415
And you're tormenting us
like an exam invigilator.

1326
01:49:56,623 --> 01:49:58,215
l'm tensed that my flight will leave.

1327
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,689
lt is your wish to give
your answers or not.

1328
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:02,293
l'll be waiting at the boarding lounge.

1329
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:08,898
ln one of my stories, the hero at last....
- l've only 7 minutes.

1330
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:12,560
lf you have any stories,
narrate it to Harika & stop her for a while.

1331
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:14,933
l will complete it by then.
Go.

1332
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:16,005
Go l say.

1333
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:17,802
Boarding must have started.

1334
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:21,774
lf you don't mind,
may l join you till there.

1335
01:50:21,982 --> 01:50:24,109
Will you love him if his
tastes matches yours?

1336
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,785
l will take a chance.
But matching 100% is too tough.

1337
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:29,478
What if they match?
- That's almost impossible.

1338
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:32,317
lf you are his destiny,
impossible will become possible.

1339
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:37,330
You keep going.
l will join you.

1340
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:43,061
Forgive me, Sweety.

1341
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:50,932
Why are you so tensed?
- l don't understand.

1342
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:57,481
l feel l will miss something in my life.

1343
01:50:57,951 --> 01:50:58,645
lt's okay.

1344
01:50:59,185 --> 01:50:59,913
Okay.

1345
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:03,679
Don't you think he matches
you atleast 1% ?

1346
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,551
Matches are made in heaven.

1347
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:09,718
You said that if l am his destiny, it's possible.
All he has to do is match it.

1348
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:11,325
What's your opinion on divorce?

1349
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,132
a. wrong.
b. not wrong.

1350
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:15,129
c. unavoidable in certain situations

1351
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:16,534
d. l don't know.

1352
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,270
The marriage is not over.
But she is talking about divorce.

1353
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:29,777
Let's go.
They are announcing the names.

1354
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:32,312
We might miss the flight.
Let's go.

1355
01:51:32,519 --> 01:51:34,749
You sit down. There is time.
Don't worry.

1356
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:41,789
lf we keep discussing about it,
we will not get the answer.

1357
01:51:41,995 --> 01:51:43,155
Think what should be done.

1358
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:45,762
Why are we taking so much time?
The answer is right here.

1359
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,794
d. l don't know

1360
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:50,663
We might miss the flight.
- Just wait a minute.

1361
01:51:51,004 --> 01:51:52,596
Just wait for a minute.
l will call him.

1362
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:56,703
She is leaving.

1363
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,343
The time is over.
What are you doing there?

1364
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,604
Come fast.
- l am coming.

1365
01:52:00,814 --> 01:52:04,181
Please. l am on the way.
Stop her. l am coming.

1366
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:06,284
But she is not listening to me.
You come.

1367
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:08,344
To whom will you give more
importance in your life?

1368
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:09,852
a. parents
b. wife

1369
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:11,523
c. brothers & sisters
d. friends

1370
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:12,749
What question is this?

1371
01:52:12,959 --> 01:52:14,256
How can l say one is more
important than the other?

1372
01:52:14,461 --> 01:52:15,257
Everyone is important to me.

1373
01:52:15,462 --> 01:52:18,124
May be she wants a man
who says that wife is important.

1374
01:52:18,331 --> 01:52:20,561
We don't have time.
Stop thinking & choose wife.

1375
01:52:20,767 --> 01:52:24,396
lf it is about making a choice,
parents are the first choice.

1376
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:28,503
Without them, neither l nor this
airport or this journey can exist.

1377
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:30,876
There is no point in her existence.

1378
01:52:32,445 --> 01:52:34,140
Think again.

1379
01:52:34,347 --> 01:52:35,279
A man who respect parents
will also respect his wife.

1380
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:38,815
lf she doesn't understand this,
l don't need that girl.

1381
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:45,223
They have announced my name.

1382
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:47,393
Please leave me.
l beg you.

1383
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:49,425
Please sir. l might miss the flight.

1384
01:52:53,366 --> 01:52:54,856
l might miss the flight.
- He is coming.

1385
01:52:57,871 --> 01:52:59,634
My mail id is harika78@yahoo.com

1386
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:01,739
Tell him to mail me.
- Just a minute.

1387
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,674
She leftjust now.

1388
01:53:13,486 --> 01:53:14,510
Give me the ticket.

1389
01:53:14,721 --> 01:53:17,019
Give me the ticket, it is enough.

1390
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:35,599
Come.

1391
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:42,144
He must be Swami.

1392
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:43,315
Let's give the paper to him.

1393
01:53:43,516 --> 01:53:44,483
Then stop him.

1394
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:48,650
Mr. Swami...
Please do us a small favour.

1395
01:53:48,855 --> 01:53:51,016
You again? l don't want to
hear anymore stories.

1396
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:52,816
We are very sorry
for all that happened.

1397
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:54,792
Just give this paper to
a girl in that flight.

1398
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:56,621
l wonder how many dangerous
stories are in this paper.

1399
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:57,819
l want to hear only the facts.

1400
01:53:58,031 --> 01:54:00,158
l beg you, sir.
- Wait.

1401
01:54:00,867 --> 01:54:03,995
This is not a story.
l fell in love with a girl.

1402
01:54:04,204 --> 01:54:06,502
l had only 2 hours time to convince her.

1403
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:07,797
Just 2 hours?

1404
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:10,001
Yes.

1405
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,705
l saw her in this airport
just 2 hours back.

1406
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:16,975
Before l could answer
the questions & come here,

1407
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:19,040
she has boarded the flight.

1408
01:54:19,385 --> 01:54:20,283
Then what?

1409
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:24,786
lt's in your hands.

1410
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:26,952
Take this & give it to that girl.

1411
01:54:28,361 --> 01:54:32,354
l don't know what would
happen after that.

1412
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:33,589
Hope there is no problem.

1413
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:37,099
Last thing she would do is
to tear this paper.

1414
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:39,969
And nothing else.

1415
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:45,604
Please trust me this time.

1416
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:49,515
lf anything goes wrong,
don't trust anyone in your life.

1417
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:51,042
Please sir. This small help.

1418
01:54:51,251 --> 01:54:52,843
What is the name?
- Dhruv.

1419
01:54:53,052 --> 01:54:57,011
Not yours. Her name.
- Harika.

1420
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:09,392
Look, l am a farmer.

1421
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:11,029
No matter how many defeats l face,

1422
01:55:11,838 --> 01:55:13,863
but l still trust man & earth.

1423
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:43,131
She gave us her email lD.
Let's send a mail.

1424
01:55:43,336 --> 01:55:44,826
The mistake happened somewhere.

1425
01:55:45,638 --> 01:55:49,836
Whatever it is,
l can't forget this journey.

1426
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,407
Let's go to Singapore.

1427
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:58,675
What happened to you?
- That's like Dhruv.

1428
01:56:11,197 --> 01:56:21,163
[ -= DDR =- ]

1429
01:56:42,028 --> 01:56:43,962
Didn't l tell you that my answer
will match yours 1000% ?

1430
01:56:44,163 --> 01:56:46,961
l will buy tickets for you too.
Let's go together.

1431
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:49,361
We will take your friend
along with her luggage.

1432
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:06,211
Shall l tell you the truth?

1433
01:57:07,987 --> 01:57:10,683
None of your answers
matched with mine.

1434
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,883
Only two things matched.

1435
01:57:15,228 --> 01:57:17,662
1 . our lucky number.
2. my Taj Mahal.

1436
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:22,334
lt was all his fault.

1437
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:26,596
l chose as he said.
He told me to chose the wrong choice.

1438
01:57:29,275 --> 01:57:30,469
Give me that question paper.
