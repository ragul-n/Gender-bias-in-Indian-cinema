2
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,575
So... You think you are too big?

3
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,108
Too proud?

4
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,373
Very powerful?

5
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,911
It's an illusion...

6
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,311
Now Watch!

7
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,241
How I break your arrogance!

8
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,838
You ruined my whole life...

9
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,280
I will slice you through!

10
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:25,140
Now watch the show!

11
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,011
Your game is over...

12
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,578
Now watch the show!

13
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,107
Hey Dashrath!

14
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,576
Have you lost your mind'?

15
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,541
Why have you started this fire?

16
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,943
You will die in this fire.

17
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,071
Even your body won't be found.

18
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,512
Have you lost your mind'?

19
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,945
Now watch the show!

20
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,374
Now watch the show!

21
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:31,803
Dashrath...

22
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,743
You sold off the last goat
to buy a hammer and chisel?!

23
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,243
I'm asking you...

24
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,872
Son of a pig... I'm your father!

25
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:41,905
Where are you going?

26
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,237
Shuklaji,

27
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,144
This is the most backward
region of Independent India.

28
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,337
Nothing has
changed here for centuries.

29
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,209
It's 13 years since independence
but not a whiff of it here.

30
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,837
No school, no hospital,
no road either here.

31
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,074
Do you see this mountain?

32
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,004
It has enslaved Gehlore village.

33
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,671
Nearest town Wazirgunj, is
just 4 miles across the mountain.

34
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:11,681
But one has to go 40 miles around
the mountain to reach there...

35
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,771
So many have died...
trying to cross this mountain.

36
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,804
What is this?

37
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,973
So you want to wear shoes
& feel like a lord'?

38
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,445
I made a mistake, Sir
It won't happen again.

39
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,803
How can we believe you'?

40
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,007
I swear on my mother.

41
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,048
Make him wear such shoes that
he doesn't need them ever again.

42
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,238
Forgive me Sir.

43
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,779
Nail a horse shoe onto him.

44
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,743
Get lost.

45
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,438
Forgive me Sir.

46
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,203
How are you Mukhiyaji?

47
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,144
We are honored sir...

48
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:51,971
How are you'?

49
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,743
What is going on here?

50
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,711
Just some minor repairs.

51
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,008
Your first visit here
since winning the election!

52
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,808
What do I say Mukhiyaji?

53
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,345
Politics!... It just sucks you in.

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,706
You literally have to hold on
to the damn chair.

55
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,303
But then you get to eat
the cream too don't you'?

56
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,802
Just win the election once...

57
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,679
Your house turns
into the Taj Mahal!

58
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,871
Shukla ji... get a ticket for
my son Ruab in the next election.

59
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,674
Yes... yes... oh meet him.

60
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,302
Who is he?

61
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,007
Alok - a very good journalist!

62
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,974
He's asking me to get a road
made from Gehlore to Wazirgunj.

63
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,306
Now think.

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,844
If the project is so big,
how "big" the planning will be!

65
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,813
You are having a lot of fun!

66
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,802
Take a picture...

67
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:42,868
Come son.

68
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,811
Name - Dashrath Manjhi.

69
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,678
Village - Gehlore.

70
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,175
District - Gaya.

71
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,177
State - Bihar.

72
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,171
The first time I saw him...

73
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:07,010
I knew-he was crazy.

74
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:08,809
Hey Dashrath.

75
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:09,971
Lower your head <i>***!</i>

76
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,569
Can't you see who is sitting here?

77
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,211
What are you doing Ruab?

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,080
At least don't hit him
in my presence!

79
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,044
I am a Legislator
and he is my vote

80
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,838
I was doing it out
of respect for you.

81
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,880
Forget the respect.

82
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,970
You don't know the reality.

83
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,648
Yesterday that fool set the
whole mountain on fire.

84
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,906
He's eaten so many rats
that they've got into his brain.

85
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,207
We know how to handle
these villains Leave them to us.

86
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,674
For your sake.

87
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,005
Dashrath, what are you doing?

88
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,607
Breaking the mountain.

89
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,837
What! You'll break the mountain?

90
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,935
Yes.

91
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,673
Alone?

92
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,870
Yes.

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,673
Have you gone mad?

94
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,803
Yes.

95
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,705
You will die...

96
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,006
The devil has got into him!

97
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:33,612
Dashrath was born in a very poor
farm laborer's house.

98
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,404
The lowest of the low caste-
'Moosahar' - or 'The rat eaters'.

99
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:41,005
As per tradition,
he was married off as a child

100
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:44,844
30 bottles of liquor & 5 pigs
that was the deal.

101
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,945
Get up Dashrath...

102
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,008
Making a fool of me are you'?

103
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,780
The name of his child bride was
'Phaguniya'

104
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,043
What happened?

105
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,004
Sir, you called
me and I came running.

106
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,076
When will you repay the money
you owe Mukhiya ji?

107
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,476
I don't have anything sir.

108
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,113
You can check.
Not a single penny. See...

109
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,074
You have money to get drunk.

110
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,705
What are you saying sir?

111
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,337
If I don't drink, how do I live?

112
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,879
& if I don't live,
how will I repay you'?

113
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,379
Idiot, talking nonsense.

114
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,814
My lord the child
will hurt his hands

115
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,869
I'll hit myself.

116
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,971
You wretched Magru... you worm...

117
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,910
Son of a pig...

118
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,844
Take this!... and this.

119
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,436
Get kicked...

120
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,002
Get kicked and die.

121
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,808
Hey drama queen!

122
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,507
Are you going to pay up
or you want to be shod'?

123
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,012
<i>I'll</i> pay up... <i>I'll</i> pay up.

124
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,410
Stay away...

125
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,811
But how?

126
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,345
My life is already bonded to you.

127
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,735
Well then get your
son's bonded now!

128
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,604
Take him... take him...

129
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,738
Now he will pay your debt.

130
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:12,512
Mother I won't go.

131
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,875
Mukhiya beats me.

132
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,276
Really?

133
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,539
Shut up you bum!

134
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,513
You have fun and I get kicked?

135
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,340
You are now bonded to the Mukhiya

136
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,434
I won't go.

137
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,307
Won't go?

138
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,275
And who will repay the debt?
Your father?!

139
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,470
I won't go.

140
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:28,577
<i>Mu 1:11:</i>

141
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,839
You won't go'?

142
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,844
Come on...

143
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,304
Run Dashrath... run...

144
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,571
Catch that son of a Swine.

145
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,310
Going to break the mountain again?

146
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,747
It's been 2 years now-
has anyone come to help you'?

147
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,973
Don't you understand?
Or has your brain turned to stone?

148
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,737
One day you'll die
breaking those rocks.

149
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,746
Once there was a monkey king
who lifted a mountain

150
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,644
and now we have Dashrath here
who'll break one! Mad man! Mad man!

151
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,344
Here - I'm back.

152
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,269
Is everything fine'?

153
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,938
Good.

154
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,247
You thought I won't return?

155
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,372
Wrong!

156
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:58,271
I will not rest till I break you.

157
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,678
We are in for a very long battle...
You and I.

158
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,212
So are you ready?

159
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,146
He's ready!

160
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,904
Being smart with me?

161
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:39,573
I'll not leave you,
I'll never forgive you.

162
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,879
See what you have turned me into.

163
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,206
I can't forget anything...

164
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:58,769
That's the damn problem.

165
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,078
Like a film it's got into my head.

166
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,109
It starts playing from any point.

167
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,772
Backwards, forwards
forwards, backwards...

168
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,172
Damn thing keeps dancing around
in my head...

169
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,441
I remember everything...

170
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,539
Everything...

171
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,513
As if it was yesterday...

172
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,240
Yesterday...

173
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:47,138
Toys... magical toys
to stop the kids crying.

174
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:52,239
Toys... soft toys
to keep your wife smiling.

175
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,437
Toys... toys...

176
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:59,806
Elephants, horses, palanquins...
how great is my lord...

177
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,371
Toys... toys...

178
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:20,778
You blind Scoundrel!
Wait till I cool you down...

179
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:31,240
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

180
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,177
First wash your face.

181
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,211
Hello brothers!

182
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,409
"The back of
untouchability is broken."

183
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:11,606
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

184
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,305
What are they celebrating?

185
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,108
End of untouchability!

186
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,113
The Government has passed a law.

187
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,305
All are equal.

188
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,142
What? We can touch anybody?

189
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,079
See! It's printed
in the newspaper.

190
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,339
'END OF UNTOUCHABILITY'

191
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:26,613
Oh my god.

192
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,635
We can touch anybody!

193
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,338
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

194
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,643
"untouchability is
Gone with the wind!"

195
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,614
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

196
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,407
Dreaming of entering the temples...

197
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,205
The <i>***</i> won't pipe down
until 10 -20 of them are hacked.

198
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:09,041
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

199
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,208
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

200
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,210
"All are Equal...
Equal... Equal..."

201
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,912
Want to come up?

202
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,176
You an outsider?

203
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,243
No, I'm very much from here...

204
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,239
Ran away as a child to Dhanbad.

205
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,877
Worked in the coal mines.

206
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,340
Coal mines...

207
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:59,172
They call it "Black Diamond."

208
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,241
It's hard work...

209
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,246
If you do it well - you get money!
Hard cash

210
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,343
and if you work hard,
you get respect too.

211
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,443
But I am free spirited.

212
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:18,214
Just felt like it...
so coming back home.

213
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,940
Which village?

214
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,574
Gehlore.

215
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,205
- Gehlore'?
- Yes.

216
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,440
You'll cross the whole mountain?

217
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,071
- Sure!
- My God...

218
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,278
What name did you say'?

219
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,074
What name did you say'?

220
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,942
When did I say anything uncle?

221
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,935
Now I am saying it.

222
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,280
Dashrath is my name.

223
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:28,042
After 7 years when he returned, the
village had not changed a bit...

224
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,971
As if it had been
forgotten by time.

225
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,814
Your shoe... keep it on my head.

226
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,842
What are you saying Mukhiyaji?

227
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,810
Keep it... keep it...

228
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,242
Please don't make me sin, sir.

229
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,371
It is not your fault.

230
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:03,242
What happened?

231
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,076
The Government has abolished
the 'caste system'...

232
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,977
Next they will
abolish the landlords.

233
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,213
The country will burn.

234
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,177
Has everyone gone mad?

235
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:17,108
Don't worry.
So what if a law is made?

236
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,145
Who will implement it?

237
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,113
Damn fools...

238
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,169
Good Morning Mukhiya ji.

239
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,903
How are you'?

240
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,876
You have not changed a bit.

241
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,737
Still the same glow...

242
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:34,768
And you!

243
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,838
You have changed completely.

244
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:41,079
Handsome... healthy...
Manly smile on the face.

245
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:43,837
Son...

246
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,402
Forgive me.

247
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,206
I... didn't recognize you.

248
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,837
How will you recognize me?

249
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,709
We are meeting after 7 years.

250
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:54,710
How?

251
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,305
I'm Dashrath.

252
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,836
Magru Manjhi's son.

253
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,101
You “WI.

254
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,805
Get away! You scum

255
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,744
I heard, the government made
everyone equal...

256
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,642
We can touch anybody.

257
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,111
You son of worm,

258
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,147
Can a frog become a horse
by wearing a horse shoe'?

259
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,771
Government loosens the grip...
so will you piss on my head'?

260
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,613
Give him such a thrashing that...

261
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,078
he never ever...

262
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,777
forgets his caste!

263
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,780
Eyes down... eyes down.

264
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,608
Hey the government has said...

265
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:26,645
What government?

266
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,179
The government says
we can touch anybody...

267
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,337
What did it say'?

268
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,943
That all are equal...

269
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,603
You scum.

270
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,642
Hey the government has said...

271
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,810
They ruined everything...

272
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,838
Hey! Who is this'?

273
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,803
Dashrath!

274
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,868
I'm Jhumru.

275
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,675
How are you brother'?

276
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,646
Great... Fantastic... Alive!

277
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,108
What happened to you'?

278
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,671
Got a great welcome
from the villagers! See...

279
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,140
So did you get hitched or not?

280
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:02,907
Bhura come here.

281
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,104
Hey uncle.

282
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,270
How are you father? Long live!

283
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,147
Where did you go... You <i>***'?</i>

284
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:19,539
My fate is bad...

285
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:22,140
Your mother died and left me...

286
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,270
I heard...

287
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:24,705
The cursed one...

288
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,212
Now how will I live?

289
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,042
I'm here now babe... I'm here.

290
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,203
Hey Uncle!

291
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,679
I won't live... I will die.

292
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,679
Why are you worried?

293
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,903
Now that he is back
we'll get his bride.

294
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,140
She'll feed you hot food.

295
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,180
In a week you'll be fine.

296
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,677
Hey... Lauki.

297
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,144
She is mine.

298
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,270
- Which one'?
- This one.

299
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,809
And this is mine, the slow train.

300
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,107
Get lost...

301
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,112
Oh My goodness,

302
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,612
Who is this'?

303
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,873
We thought some English man
has come,

304
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,935
But this is a local rowdy.

305
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,672
You are looking absolutely
bombastic.

306
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:06,110
Come wash up.

307
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,644
Did you find a girlfriend?

308
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,112
Torn his clothes while having fun!

309
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,713
Yes I met up with your sister!

310
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:18,075
<i>"Smart *" *</i>

311
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:19,636
Here eat some food.

312
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:22,213
Eat first - then have your fun.

313
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,135
Uncle...

314
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,650
Hey what is life...
without a wife...

315
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,943
Eating and sleeping...
Eating and sleeping...

316
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,209
Eating and sleeping...
Eating and sleeping...

317
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,913
Eating and sleeping...
Eating and sleeping...

318
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:51,945
We have come to take
Dashrath's wife.

319
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,502
He ran away...

320
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,478
What's the guarantee,
he won't run away again?

321
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,238
Let it be...

322
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,178
I've seen a better boy in the city.

323
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,112
He has a government job in Gaya

324
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,509
a watchman in the municipality.

325
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,509
What does this wastrel do'?

326
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,604
You bloody pig thief,

327
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,407
You steal pigs from villages & sell
them to the butcher in the city

328
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,071
and you dare to call
my son a wastrel!

329
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:14,104
You drunkard! Don't make me lose
my head or I'll thrash you.

330
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,169
- What's the problem?
- Hold your tongue

331
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,107
or I'll pull it out you cheat.

332
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,908
They gave 100 rupees for her.

333
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:24,073
If you have any guts,
pay up 200 and take her.

334
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:26,614
- Forget it babe, I don't want her.
- No... no.

335
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:30,615
What does he think of himself?
I spit on him...

336
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:33,140
God knows who you got
me married to as a child'?

337
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,040
Let's go.

338
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,445
You keep your princess at home.

339
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,840
That's your wife...

340
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,038
Phaguniya...

341
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,908
This is Phaguniya?

342
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,510
This is my wife?

343
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,078
How is it possible?

344
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,601
She is mine...

345
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,078
You dare marry her to anybody else.

346
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,502
Just now you said
you don't want her.

347
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:03,511
When did I say that?

348
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:04,568
Where did I say that?

349
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,671
Must have said in as a child.

350
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,938
Hey Phaguniya...

351
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:10,971
You understand, don't you'?

352
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:12,777
You come with me.

353
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,837
Kalua... Bilua come here quick.

354
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,812
Get lost or your corpses
will leave this house.

355
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,810
You watch!

356
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,938
I will carry her away.

357
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,039
You dare marry her to anyone else!

358
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,040
A fair is not meant to be
enjoyed with one's father!

359
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,037
Come with me, we'll have some fun

360
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,878
I thought you were going to
take me away.

361
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,278
Working on it

362
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:26,375
I'll throw money on your
father's face and take you away.

363
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,007
Phaguniya... Phaguniya.

364
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:30,940
What is it mother?

365
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,308
See this.

366
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:25,510
- How much for this'?
- 10 Rupees

367
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,777
I have only 5 rupees.

368
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:31,545
Leave it.

369
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,601
Wait...

370
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,704
2nd one we will buy next year!

371
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,278
I got a gift for you.

372
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,370
This is the Taj Mahal.

373
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,344
An Emperor built it
in the memory of his wife.

374
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,503
So small?

375
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,401
This is a toy.

376
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:28,640
The real one is
as big as our mountain

377
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:34,271
I can't bear it any more...

378
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,471
Tell me one thing...

379
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,307
Are we not married?

380
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,474
Are you not my wife?

381
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,878
Then why does your father not
send you with me?

382
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,803
Babe says you don't earn.

383
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,346
How will you support me?

384
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:48,605
You don't worry,

385
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,504
I'll go across
the mountain to Wazirgunj

386
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,604
I'll beg, borrow, steal

387
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,580
I'll sell myself
but will keep you happy

388
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,643
I know... but...

389
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,340
No ifs and buts...

390
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,340
I can't live without you...

391
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:06,409
You come now.

392
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,444
Or I will eat you alive.

393
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,577
What are you doing?

394
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,273
Someone will see.

395
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,369
Let them see...

396
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,843
I'm on fire...

397
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,406
Tell me the truth.
What is in your heart?

398
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,275
Show me.

399
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,241
Phaguniya.

400
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
Phaguniya.

401
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,406
Where are you'?

402
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,710
Is there an animal in the bushes?

403
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,339
Yes mother...

404
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,176
When do I see you again?

405
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,244
What for'?

406
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,208
To play with toys?

407
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,811
If you want me,
speak to my father.

408
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,337
Or if you have the guts
then elope with me.

409
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:53,373
Oh how she drives me crazy!

410
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,576
Hey Bhura what are you doing?

411
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:00,241
It has been two years.

412
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,280
You still don't have any brats.

413
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:06,304
We'll see when your wife comes -
how many brats you produce!

414
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,672
You'll go straight into the pit...

415
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,270
Water, Jhumru bring some water.

416
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,540
Bring some water.

417
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,171
Hey idiot, you want
to put off the fire?

418
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,772
If the bricks get wet,
I'll throw everyone in.

419
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:24,611
Get back away...

420
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,341
He is dying sir...

421
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,380
He will die.

422
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:30,070
So'?

423
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:32,307
Let him die if he
doesn't know how to work.

424
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,075
What you will do'? Eat him'?

425
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,703
You'll have to give compensation.

426
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,710
Get back.

427
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,670
What will she eat?

428
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,213
How will she live?

429
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:46,805
<i>*** -</i> wants to be a leader!

430
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,302
The chicken is trying
to be a tiger...

431
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,710
You want compensation?

432
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,305
Get back.

433
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,240
Damn it!

434
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,476
What kind of life is this'?

435
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,577
Bhura's life is made.

436
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,407
At least he is out of this hell.

437
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,573
What game is this?!

438
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,241
How much more will you torture us?

439
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:26,639
What's the use of killing the dead!

440
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,440
If you have the guts,
then stop the powerful!

441
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,570
Want to be called God?

442
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,475
Is this your world?

443
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,310
If you give life,
why this torture?

444
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,238
Is there any kindness or not?

445
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,042
You make mistakes
& we get punished!

446
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,309
Why'?! Why'?!

447
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:47,505
Hey! Look at that...

448
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,069
See-that's Bhura... Our Bhura...

449
00:33:49,134 --> 00:33:51,136
He died & become a star.

450
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,479
His whole life, he was bonded...

451
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,513
He's shining after his death...

452
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,540
He is shining...

453
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:14,769
Dashrath...

454
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,644
Are you a man or a mouse?

455
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,137
Mouse... no man.

456
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:23,376
Your father in law is marrying
off your wife to a city man.

457
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,513
Then you can keep shaking it.

458
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,037
- What did you say'?
- Then you can keep shaking it.

459
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:42,640
Scoundrel! You'll marry my wife
to someone else?

460
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,078
Let's see.

461
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:52,212
Hey-Kalua! Bilua!

462
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:53,541
Catch him.

463
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,569
Move away,
I want to speak to Phaguniya.

464
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,476
Phaguniya - What do you say'?

465
00:34:58,267 --> 00:34:59,974
Go-go inside.

466
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,873
Don't you dare!

467
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,081
You think <i>I'll</i>
give you my daughter?

468
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,904
Don't know where your next
meal is coming from.

469
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,071
How you will take care of her?

470
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:11,204
With Love.

471
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:13,213
Love will fill her stomach?

472
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,070
Phaguniya.

473
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,643
Open the door Phaguniya.

474
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:19,247
Get lost you looser.

475
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:23,508
Hey... you villagers.

476
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:27,146
He is marrying off my wife
to someone else.

477
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,406
Tell me... is it fair?

478
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:31,240
This greedy old man

479
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,973
is selling his own daughter.

480
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,342
Tell me... is it fair?

481
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,477
He'll ruin her life...

482
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,207
Tell me... is it fair?

483
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,604
Tell me Phaguniya...

484
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,974
Will you come with me? Or
rot here for the rest of your life?

485
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,472
Tell me.

486
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,911
What are you thinking? Get up.

487
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,910
You dare come closer,
I'll hack you to bits.

488
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:04,544
Move!

489
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,540
I'll cut you.

490
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:15,038
Stop him!

491
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,138
The rat has bitten off our nose.

492
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,911
Let's go.

493
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:33,073
"Oh my beloved!"

494
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,374
"I want to tell you."

495
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:42,180
"I'm covered in your color."

496
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:46,412
"I'm wearing your color."

497
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:51,409
"My body is adorned."

498
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:57,907
"With your arms."

499
00:38:00,434 --> 00:38:04,348
"Oh my beloved!"

500
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,939
"Oh my beloved!"

501
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,409
"Oh my beloved!"

502
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,204
"Oh my beloved!"

503
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:40,792
You laugh after making me cry?

504
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:45,986
Now laugh!

505
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:49,189
Laugh!

506
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:50,849
Laugh!

507
00:38:54,879 --> 00:39:00,158
As I break you from top to bottom.

508
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,484
There's a limit to everything.

509
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:41,325
How long can we bear your madness'?

510
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,218
Till the mountain is broken.

511
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,521
What have you achieved in 5 years?

512
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,991
Have you even
scratched the mountain?

513
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:52,126
What the British couldn't
do in a 100 years...

514
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,592
the Government couldn't
do in 20 years...

515
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,217
You think you can do it alone?

516
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,988
Stop it old man, I'm tired.

517
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:03,457
You aren't bothered about us...

518
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:05,118
At least take care of your self

519
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,626
I can't bear to see you like this.

520
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:10,588
You feel sad looking at me?

521
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:13,521
Fine.

522
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,121
You won't see me anymore.

523
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:33,488
"Phaguniya... Phaguniya...
Calls out your beloved."

524
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,056
"You live in my heart."

525
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:51,421
"You are my world."

526
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:34,225
How much for this toy?

527
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,451
I'm not a toy.

528
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:40,021
But I want to play with this.

529
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,521
Let go of my hand.

530
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,391
Leave it or I'll cut off your
you know what?!

531
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:46,256
Then you can play with it forever.

532
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:49,588
Come on you'll have fun.

533
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,190
Leave my hand!

534
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:54,927
Come on stop resisting.

535
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:00,293
Dashrath.

536
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:04,484
Dashrath leave him.

537
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:27,054
Don't you trust me?

538
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,482
Phaguniya.

539
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:46,984
O' Phaguniya!

540
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,858
You are my life... life

541
00:42:51,747 --> 00:42:56,253
I love you so much,
so much, so much...

542
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:57,952
How much do I love you'?

543
00:42:58,014 --> 00:43:00,290
Should I tear open
my heart to show you.

544
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:01,756
Get away.

545
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,218
Look...

546
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:06,086
For you.

547
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,854
A soft, soft pillow...

548
00:43:12,147 --> 00:43:15,993
If we sleep with our heads together
on it-it will be so much fun!

549
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:19,327
Why get a pillow? Get a
stone to break my head instead.

550
00:43:19,414 --> 00:43:22,258
When you are angry,
you get wild...

551
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:28,284
Don't touch me.

552
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,182
Why'? I am your husband.

553
00:43:31,914 --> 00:43:33,154
If I don't touch you who will?

554
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,450
You think I am some lemon tree?

555
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,694
Squeeze it whenever you wish'?

556
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:42,417
OK. I made a mistake.
I lost my head.

557
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,217
If anyone touches you,
can I just sit and watch?

558
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,089
How many will you beat up Dashrath'?

559
00:43:47,214 --> 00:43:49,820
Mukhia, the land lord,
the merchant, priest?! Who all...

560
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,188
Everyone has an evil eye.

561
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:54,023
Whoever looks at you with
an evil eye I'll pull his eyes out.

562
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:55,688
- Oh...?
- Yes.

563
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,750
You are so powerful?

564
00:43:57,814 --> 00:43:58,349
Yes.

565
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,681
Big wrestler eh'?

566
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:01,690
Sure.

567
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,790
- Really?
- Yes.

568
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:04,854
Let me check your strength.

569
00:44:04,914 --> 00:44:08,088
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

570
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,252
Hit him!

571
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:12,684
He deserve It...

572
00:44:12,747 --> 00:44:13,885
The pig brings a pillow

573
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:16,689
I was stupid to elope with him.

574
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,117
You will remain an animal!

575
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,690
I won't stay another
minute with you.

576
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:23,392
<i>I</i> am going.

577
00:44:26,314 --> 00:44:27,315
Where?

578
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,385
To hell...

579
00:44:28,647 --> 00:44:29,853
I'll come with you.

580
00:44:30,347 --> 00:44:31,917
We'll play pillow games.

581
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,658
Where are you going in the dark?

582
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,057
Some wolf will eat you.

583
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,352
At least I'll be rid of you.

584
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:37,751
A scorpion will bite you

585
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:39,820
I don't want to talk to you.

586
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:43,660
Listen, Phaghuniya.

587
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,852
Forgive me.

588
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,317
Stop or I will jump off from here.

589
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,354
Is that why you eloped with me?

590
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:55,854
If anything happens to you,
what will I do'?

591
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,216
He has brains in his heels

592
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,816
and wants to become a father.

593
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:04,651
Oh what a miracle!

594
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,688
Show me, show me...

595
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,719
Hey this is your father speaking.

596
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:13,858
What?

597
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,253
He says 9 months.

598
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,127
That's too long come out soon...

599
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:20,055
What?

600
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,058
"Boom?"

601
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:22,591
What?

602
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,015
"Boom Boom?"

603
00:45:25,547 --> 00:45:26,685
"Boompati - Boom - Boom!"

604
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,951
O' Phaguniya...

605
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,023
Where is Dashrath'?

606
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:42,751
Come out...

607
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,651
Where is the rat hiding'?

608
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,657
Find him! Get everyone out!

609
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:49,655
I'll burn down
the whole settlement!

610
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,950
Come out.

611
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,715
You dare raise your hand on me?

612
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,690
What is it?

613
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,884
Get him.

614
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:56,749
Check there.

615
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:58,088
The rat scuttled away.

616
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:00,758
Only this bag of bones is here.

617
00:46:01,214 --> 00:46:03,558
You've bred a snake!

618
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:04,786
Where is Dashrath'?

619
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,758
I swear I don't know.

620
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:08,054
- You don't know?
- No.

621
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,581
Fool!

622
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,958
Leave him.

623
00:46:13,114 --> 00:46:14,616
Why are you looking for Dashrath'?

624
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:16,824
A broken nose wasn't enough?

625
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,154
Want your leg broken too?

626
00:46:18,214 --> 00:46:21,559
You damn swine.

627
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,685
Hey Jhumru, stop.

628
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,783
Go inside...

629
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:30,590
Hey Lauki -
Now here is a delicious one!

630
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:31,887
Everything is public property.

631
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:33,483
Get her.

632
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,721
Leave me... leave me...

633
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,023
After few years when I
went back to Gehlore

634
00:48:58,347 --> 00:49:00,725
I heard he was still breaking
the mountain

635
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,854
I was amazed

636
00:49:04,814 --> 00:49:07,385
& felt like meeting this crazy man.

637
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,959
Are you Dashrath Manjhi?

638
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:11,586
How are you'?

639
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:14,826
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

640
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,393
I'm a journalist.

641
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,485
Name is Alok Jha

642
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:21,793
I write for the "Bharat Samachar"
newspaper...

643
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,951
Heard you've been breaking
this mountain for years.

644
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,552
Why?

645
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,720
Digging my own grave...

646
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:29,720
You are joking...

647
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,987
What should I say'?
That I'm making a Taj Mahal'?

648
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:33,691
You are offended.

649
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:35,689
Everyone says that I'm a mad man.

650
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:37,454
Wasting my life...

651
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:40,427
You don't waste your time.

652
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,925
It is an internal wound.

653
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,056
Till I break this mountain...

654
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,482
It won't heal.

655
00:49:51,813 --> 00:49:54,054
You have taken on a big task...

656
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:55,885
OK...

657
00:49:56,014 --> 00:49:57,721
Let me know when
you are finished...

658
00:49:57,914 --> 00:49:59,916
I'll print
your photo in the newspaper.

659
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,052
Trying to be a well-wisher?

660
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:04,748
Then come.

661
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,520
I end me a hand...

662
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,688
Hold her... hurry.

663
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,857
The baby is coming out!

664
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,052
Hold her in water.

665
00:50:44,547 --> 00:50:45,855
Careful... careful...

666
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:48,053
Call her husband! Hurry!

667
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:52,685
What happened?

668
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:56,394
Don't shout! Hold her.

669
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,428
Breath heavily, once more...

670
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,417
Once more...

671
00:51:28,347 --> 00:51:29,325
What are you doing?

672
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,381
Dear Goddess.

673
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,750
One request...

674
00:51:32,514 --> 00:51:34,892
Give me one daughter just like you.

675
00:51:35,647 --> 00:51:37,490
Then you can take my life.

676
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:38,882
Get lost.

677
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:43,357
Melodrama!

678
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,259
It has been a long time...

679
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:51,984
I really want to...

680
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,292
Let's play pillow games.

681
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:59,628
Your games lead
to my bloated belly.

682
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,824
Nothing to eat &
wants to breed a battalion!

683
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,721
Don't worry
I got work across the mountain.

684
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:12,260
Once the daughter is born.

685
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:14,623
We will go to the city
and earn a lot.

686
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,656
We'll make our son an officer
and daughter a teacher!

687
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:19,590
Life will sparkle.

688
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:21,553
Come on...

689
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:24,587
Now when we go to the city.

690
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,284
My baby...

691
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,282
I will take you to the city.

692
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,460
So you'll never
need to climb a mountain...

693
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:23,319
You won't need to
stay in the dark...

694
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:27,827
We'll eat good food.

695
00:53:28,147 --> 00:53:30,218
Drink sweet water.

696
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:32,649
And have a lot of fun my baby.

697
00:54:03,214 --> 00:54:04,716
Dashrath!

698
00:54:05,714 --> 00:54:08,558
Your wife has fallen
from the mountain!

699
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:30,659
What happened, Phaguniya?

700
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,385
The mountain was too high

701
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:36,484
I couldn't climb it

702
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,686
I slipped.

703
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,057
Doctor..

704
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,660
Hold on, don't give up.

705
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,357
Soon we'll reach the hospital.

706
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,082
Move! Move!

707
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,254
Where is the doctor?

708
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:02,058
We couldn't save her...

709
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:04,590
But your daughter is saved.

710
00:56:31,414 --> 00:56:32,916
You think you are too big?

711
00:56:35,014 --> 00:56:36,254
Too powerful?

712
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:39,951
Very proud?

713
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:44,454
It's an illusion...

714
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,520
Watch! How I break
your arrogance!

715
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:59,060
You ruined my whole life...

716
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:02,588
I will break you.

717
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:07,927
You watch the show now!

718
00:57:08,447 --> 00:57:10,154
Your game is over...

719
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:39,225
Must admit.

720
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,282
He is true to his word...

721
00:57:41,347 --> 00:57:44,351
He's cut the climb
by at least an hour.

722
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,983
So Dashrath'?

723
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,354
How much longer?

724
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,258
Till I break it.

725
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:50,258
The brave one!

726
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:51,883
Keep it up kid!

727
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:55,258
When you finish the road,
We'll name it after you.

728
00:57:55,314 --> 00:57:56,452
Rajkumaria...

729
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:59,589
How many times have I told you
not to climb the mountain.

730
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,391
You may break your leg...
get hurt...

731
00:58:02,447 --> 00:58:04,290
What will I tell your mother then?

732
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:06,426
Mother has gone to God's house.

733
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,460
You eat quietly.

734
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:14,220
Stop this tomfoolery!

735
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,850
Enough!

736
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:19,225
Driving me crazy!

737
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,284
Can't you see'?
Do I take care of myself...

738
00:58:22,347 --> 00:58:23,883
or your kids?

739
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,956
Listen...

740
00:58:25,014 --> 00:58:26,220
Get married again.

741
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,886
Or find some work
& look after your kids.

742
00:58:29,014 --> 00:58:31,255
Don't ever talk
about a second marriage.

743
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:32,759
What will I tell Phaguniya?

744
00:58:32,814 --> 00:58:34,487
Moron! She is dead.

745
00:58:34,747 --> 00:58:36,249
Not for me.

746
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,456
And regarding work...
Now this is my work.

747
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,491
What will you feed your kids?

748
00:58:41,747 --> 00:58:43,055
These rocks?

749
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:46,894
Here! Nurse the buggers
and feed them rocks!

750
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:48,392
I can't handle your kids

751
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,017
I will take care of my kids!

752
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,058
I Will!

753
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:52,752
Do it then! I'm off!

754
00:58:52,813 --> 00:58:54,815
You don't need to go crazy.

755
00:58:55,047 --> 00:58:56,082
Come Bhagirath,

756
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:59,321
See I am nursing them! Happily!

757
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,384
Stop... Stop...

758
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:08,387
<i>***</i> mountain cutter-

759
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,353
Why are you blocking
my path like a rock?

760
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:11,051
Move aside

761
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,286
I can make you profit.

762
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:13,291
Profit?

763
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:14,155
Yes.

764
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:16,421
Takes you 4 days to lug
goods from the market?

765
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,124
Yes.

766
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,091
In a bumpy Bullock can ride'?

767
00:59:19,147 --> 00:59:19,818
Yes.

768
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,086
And additional expenses?

769
00:59:21,147 --> 00:59:22,182
Yes so?

770
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:23,783
I'll get them across in a day.

771
00:59:23,947 --> 00:59:25,893
Really? How?

772
00:59:26,014 --> 00:59:28,051
The mountain is my friend.

773
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:33,996
"The earth is his seat."

774
00:59:34,914 --> 00:59:40,728
"And sky, the tent."

775
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:48,086
"He is covered with dust."

776
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:53,827
"And still remains pure."

777
01:00:13,414 --> 01:00:14,688
Little more.

778
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:17,725
Baba.

779
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,418
Why does everyone call you mad?

780
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,751
Those who do can't see.

781
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,915
What baba'?

782
01:00:23,047 --> 01:00:23,957
Magic.

783
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,888
Want to see'?

784
01:00:24,947 --> 01:00:25,891
Yes!

785
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:27,051
Then close your eyes.

786
01:00:28,414 --> 01:00:32,760
"Abraca dabra"
Show magic to my kids,

787
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:34,316
Show them a path
through that mountain!

788
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,017
See it?

789
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,024
Yes!

790
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,923
See the Bullock can racing!

791
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,856
Yes!!

792
01:00:38,914 --> 01:00:39,858
What else do you see'?

793
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:43,127
Cycle... Motor Carl! Bike!

794
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:57,292
"God is great! God is great!"

795
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:06,960
"God is great! God is great!"

796
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:20,751
Baba, what was mother like?

797
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,956
Exactly like you.

798
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,987
When will mother come back'?

799
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,960
When the road is ready.

800
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:31,219
Mother will be back too.

801
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:43,088
How are you brother'?

802
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,660
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

803
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,286
Tell me one something.

804
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:50,052
Yes.

805
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:51,991
There are so many
jobs in the world.

806
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:55,057
You found nothing better than
breaking the mountain'?

807
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,057
Everyone has their own skills.

808
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,790
You read and write

809
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,816
I break mountain.

810
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:04,925
How do you get so much strength?

811
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,220
It's love.

812
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:10,852
First for my wife.

813
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,853
Now for this mountain.

814
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,624
Such a deep thought
and you put it so simply.

815
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,557
Look at me,

816
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,023
I wanted to be
an honest journalist.

817
01:02:24,547 --> 01:02:26,288
But became a pimp
of the politicians

818
01:02:28,014 --> 01:02:29,755
I hate myself.

819
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,785
Why not start
your own newspaper?

820
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:37,026
You think it's easy'?

821
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,651
Is it more difficult than
breaking a mountain?

822
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,426
Long live the saint in the sack!

823
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,620
Let the earth split...
the sky fall... the floods come.

824
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,024
But the saint in the sack
remains unaffected!

825
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,889
Great is the saint in sack.

826
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:11,928
Let me fall at your feet!

827
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,584
What are you doing baba'?

828
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:15,183
You fool.

829
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:17,017
There is a drought you <i>***!</i>

830
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,991
All the villagers are leaving.

831
01:04:19,047 --> 01:04:20,549
There is no water

832
01:04:20,614 --> 01:04:22,093
and you are still digging!

833
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:23,022
Come to the city.

834
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,923
You won't remain alive here!

835
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,618
I can't leave the mountain.

836
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,182
What?

837
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,017
I can't leave the mountain.

838
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,592
Are you completely crazy?

839
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:34,593
Trying to be a hero?

840
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:36,422
In this scorching heat,
you want to break a mountain?

841
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,925
What will
you eat? What'll you drink?

842
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,789
Fool! You'll burn to death!

843
01:04:39,847 --> 01:04:40,848
So you go!

844
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,424
Go..

845
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,950
Here's some money...

846
01:04:50,714 --> 01:04:52,022
Don't give them any grief

847
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,090
I will stay here
and break the mountain.

848
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:57,694
Then break it you idiot! I'm off!

849
01:04:58,614 --> 01:05:01,390
Don't know what treasure
he'll find here.

850
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:02,755
A path...

851
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:06,849
I will find the path.

852
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:11,020
Come on kids! Let this fool die.

853
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:19,420
Tinkle... tinkle...

854
01:08:23,547 --> 01:08:26,426
Tinkle... tinkle...

855
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,452
Tinkle... tinkle...

856
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,751
Tinkle...

857
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,423
I had only one dream.

858
01:08:49,147 --> 01:08:51,423
To buy the second anklet
for your other foot.

859
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:56,689
Don't have food to eat and...
dream of ornaments!

860
01:09:04,114 --> 01:09:07,391
With the tinkle of your anklet...
I've spent my whole life...

861
01:09:08,647 --> 01:09:11,127
Tinkle... tinkle...

862
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,720
You saved my life!

863
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,319
Now you've become a true friend.

864
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,557
Come... let me give you some love.

865
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:21,187
"Phaguniya..."

866
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,991
"You fair maiden of Gehlore."

867
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:42,084
"Will you come with me?"

868
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:55,655
"For you I made this path."

869
01:12:56,114 --> 01:12:58,617
"Which goes to Wazirganj."

870
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,857
O my God... wonder of wonders.

871
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:13,552
The power of passion.

872
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:15,184
Cutting through hard rock.

873
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,253
Great my son -

874
01:18:23,714 --> 01:18:24,818
You have shown the world.

875
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:26,616
We were blind.

876
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,560
Couldn't see the road
hidden in the mountain.

877
01:18:30,714 --> 01:18:31,692
Babe!

878
01:18:31,847 --> 01:18:32,848
For you.

879
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:35,060
Saved it for you hammer
& chisel.

880
01:18:35,314 --> 01:18:38,193
Thank you my child...

881
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,021
Long live!

882
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,151
Long live!

883
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,794
Shut the door! Hurry!

884
01:18:57,847 --> 01:19:00,521
Babe! The Naxalites are here!

885
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,523
Go to your posts.

886
01:19:02,581 --> 01:19:04,492
We are attacked.
The damned Leftists are here.

887
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,116
Shut up! As if you didn't
have your fun...

888
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,625
Come inside!

889
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:11,225
Leave none of them.

890
01:19:22,747 --> 01:19:25,819
So what did you think?
That I ran away?

891
01:19:26,547 --> 01:19:27,890
See <i>***!</i> I'm back.

892
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:30,694
To fix you.

893
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:32,687
This is a revolution.

894
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:33,748
It's spread like
fire in the country.

895
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:35,691
Now everything will change.

896
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:38,091
No more rich! Or poor!

897
01:19:38,147 --> 01:19:39,717
No high... No low.

898
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:40,758
All equal!

899
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,017
Think!

900
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:43,749
We do the slogging...

901
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:45,684
and he has the fun?

902
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,088
We sweat and cry...

903
01:19:47,514 --> 01:19:48,754
and he makes the money.

904
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:50,526
No more!

905
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,853
Today you will decide.

906
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:54,684
Speak up.

907
01:19:54,781 --> 01:19:57,921
Anyone wants to say anything about
this 'landlord' Nirbhay Singh'?

908
01:19:58,114 --> 01:20:00,788
This village head
gobbled up my land!

909
01:20:01,214 --> 01:20:03,717
He killed my father and burnt him.

910
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:07,092
His son Ruab kidnapped
my daughter.

911
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:09,918
You have anything to say'?

912
01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:13,022
Forgive me.

913
01:20:13,747 --> 01:20:15,124
Appeal rejected.

914
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,889
The people's court
sentences the accused to death!

915
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,527
- Long live... revolution.
- This is wrong!

916
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:23,525
This is wrong.

917
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:25,015
Dashrath.

918
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,488
Stop right there

919
01:20:26,547 --> 01:20:27,685
or I'll forget everything

920
01:20:28,147 --> 01:20:29,751
<i>***</i> is a blood sucker!

921
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,086
Killed my Lauki!

922
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,491
Ruined our lives

923
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:35,155
I'm not going to spare him.

924
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,720
Gun gives one power, does it?

925
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,989
" Power flows from
the barrel of a gun."

926
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:43,720
If I can break the mountain

927
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:45,788
I can break your head too.

928
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:46,755
Leave the Mukhiya.

929
01:20:46,814 --> 01:20:48,885
The time to talk is over.

930
01:20:49,214 --> 01:20:50,659
Now it's time to act.

931
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,582
Hang him.

932
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,084
Long live revolution!

933
01:21:18,414 --> 01:21:20,087
They hanged my father.

934
01:22:23,047 --> 01:22:24,754
Dashrath... brother.

935
01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:27,354
What happened?

936
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:30,020
Great, Fantastic, Alive...?

937
01:22:30,814 --> 01:22:32,794
Got scared of the guns'?

938
01:22:33,647 --> 01:22:35,490
I came to report

939
01:22:35,547 --> 01:22:36,924
about yesterday's incident.

940
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:38,892
But no one is saying anything.

941
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:41,085
Tell me one thing.

942
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:43,825
Whatever happened...

943
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:45,949
was it right or wrong?

944
01:22:47,414 --> 01:22:48,791
Hey! Dashrath brother!

945
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:50,722
I'm a mad man.

946
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:54,924
Why ask me about right or wrong.

947
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:58,359
Am I responsible for all
the filth in the world?

948
01:22:59,514 --> 01:23:02,518
I don't even know
what I am doing here

949
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:06,418
asking me about
right and wrong...

950
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,822
Go mind your own business.

951
01:23:17,447 --> 01:23:18,585
You asked me.

952
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:21,649
Why I don't start
my own newspaper?

953
01:23:25,447 --> 01:23:26,755
I've published my own newspaper.

954
01:23:27,047 --> 01:23:28,492
"The New Dawn."

955
01:23:32,914 --> 01:23:33,984
Alok babu.

956
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:41,758
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

957
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:44,960
Can I take a photo?

958
01:23:45,014 --> 01:23:47,290
Sure... how do you want it?

959
01:23:47,947 --> 01:23:49,358
- This way?
- Yes...

960
01:24:02,714 --> 01:24:04,785
Long Live! Long Live!

961
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:09,693
He said if I ask "Madam",
the road will be made.

962
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:15,954
Fool-see all the cops here?
They'll put you in jail!

963
01:24:16,214 --> 01:24:18,353
Long Live! Indira Gandhi!

964
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:20,394
Long Live Mother India!

965
01:24:20,447 --> 01:24:22,757
Long Live! Indira Gandhi!

966
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:31,453
I've come here to you,

967
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:37,526
To fulfill the dreams of
Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru...

968
01:24:37,881 --> 01:24:42,887
It's a tragedy that even after
25 years of independence.

969
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:44,351
People

970
01:24:44,414 --> 01:24:48,260
are fighting for basics like
food, clothing and housing.

971
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:52,290
Whenever I say "Remove Poverty."

972
01:24:52,714 --> 01:24:56,389
The opposition says
"Remove Indira"

973
01:24:56,447 --> 01:24:58,586
I want to know from you,

974
01:24:58,947 --> 01:25:00,551
What do you want'?

975
01:25:05,914 --> 01:25:09,418
Help! Hurry!
Lend a shoulder... its falling.

976
01:25:12,614 --> 01:25:15,595
This hand is your hand.

977
01:25:16,614 --> 01:25:20,152
A symbol of your strength &
your labor.

978
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:23,161
This is the hand that will
bring about change.

979
01:25:23,214 --> 01:25:27,390
This hand will write the
golden future of India.

980
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:29,387
This very hand

981
01:25:29,847 --> 01:25:31,383
will eradicate poverty.

982
01:25:31,747 --> 01:25:34,819
Today...
the entire nation is screaming -

983
01:25:35,514 --> 01:25:37,494
Remove poverty!

984
01:25:42,781 --> 01:25:44,658
Indira Gandhi...

985
01:25:44,714 --> 01:25:45,818
Long Live!!!

986
01:25:48,147 --> 01:25:50,184
Mother India...

987
01:25:50,247 --> 01:25:51,624
Long Live!!!

988
01:25:58,847 --> 01:26:00,554
Long live Indira Gandhi.

989
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,184
Long live Mother India.

990
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:04,227
Long live Indira Gandhi.

991
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:13,155
Madam, I'm breaking a mountain...
please make a road there.

992
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:14,852
Madam, he is Dashrath Manjhi.

993
01:26:15,114 --> 01:26:16,286
He's been breaking
a mountain for 12 years.

994
01:26:16,347 --> 01:26:17,724
Alone...
for the wellbeing of people.

995
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:19,351
If you can help him...

996
01:26:23,547 --> 01:26:24,582
Move... Move away.

997
01:26:35,414 --> 01:26:37,223
Dashrath... brother!

998
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:40,385
Come here.

999
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,784
See this.

1000
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,287
You have become famous
my friend.

1001
01:26:47,581 --> 01:26:48,787
See this...

1002
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,423
Your photo in the paper.

1003
01:26:53,214 --> 01:26:55,751
You have aged.

1004
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:58,352
Sit. Sit down. Relax.

1005
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:03,025
Now you need government help

1006
01:27:03,547 --> 01:27:05,458
I will help you.

1007
01:27:06,047 --> 01:27:08,357
There's an officer -
very big - the BDO

1008
01:27:08,414 --> 01:27:10,121
I've spoken to him.

1009
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:13,227
You'll get a government grant
to break the Mountain.

1010
01:27:14,214 --> 01:27:15,386
The Government will help?

1011
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:16,391
Yes.

1012
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:17,551
For making the road?

1013
01:27:17,614 --> 01:27:18,615
Yes.

1014
01:27:18,781 --> 01:27:20,590
Then it'll break in a jiffy!

1015
01:27:20,647 --> 01:27:21,648
Of course.

1016
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:24,388
Now I am the village head.

1017
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,427
Can't see just
my own profit & loss.

1018
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:30,757
Forget whatever
happened in the past.

1019
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,352
If the road is made,
everyone will benefit.

1020
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:37,587
Yes, then a proper
road can be made.

1021
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:38,625
Yes.

1022
01:27:39,014 --> 01:27:41,221
Motor cars will zip around
in our Gehlore.

1023
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,317
Reaching the hospital
will get easy.

1024
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:46,054
Zip! & you'll be in Wazirgunj!

1025
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:48,416
Zip and you're in Wazirgunj'?

1026
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,515
Yes.

1027
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,651
Dashrath is doing a noble job.

1028
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:01,559
He's breaking the mountain
in memory of his wife,

1029
01:28:02,947 --> 01:28:05,223
She was like a... Goddess.

1030
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:07,183
Sit brother Dashrath, sit.

1031
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:08,992
Sit...

1032
01:28:16,181 --> 01:28:17,387
You're very hard working.

1033
01:28:18,614 --> 01:28:20,321
We are happy with you work

1034
01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:24,193
I'm writing to the government
to help you.

1035
01:28:24,247 --> 01:28:25,191
You'll get money.

1036
01:28:25,247 --> 01:28:27,193
The Government is like a parent.

1037
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:31,186
Once the road is made
I can die in peace.

1038
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:34,093
Now everything will change.

1039
01:28:34,614 --> 01:28:36,059
Everything will change!

1040
01:28:36,447 --> 01:28:37,585
Now you go.

1041
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:41,258
And listen, work diligently.

1042
01:28:41,981 --> 01:28:45,519
When the money comes from Delhi
I'll send it through Mukhiya

1043
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,253
I am an illiterate
Don't understand money matters.

1044
01:28:49,414 --> 01:28:50,722
But I will break the mountain.

1045
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:54,451
Just get a permanent road made.

1046
01:28:57,447 --> 01:28:58,949
Consider it done.

1047
01:29:08,447 --> 01:29:09,926
Mukhiyaji...

1048
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,192
We are sanctioning two million.

1049
01:29:14,514 --> 01:29:18,394
He won't know, how many
zeroes in two million.

1050
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:22,460
BDO sir, this is called finding
a diamond in a coal mine.

1051
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,384
Hello baba.

1052
01:29:26,014 --> 01:29:27,152
Bless you.

1053
01:29:29,547 --> 01:29:31,083
<i>Baba recognize me?</i>

1054
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,286
I'm Gopal.

1055
01:29:37,614 --> 01:29:40,390
As a kid, I used to
throw stones at you, Baba.

1056
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,126
And call you
"The mad mountain man"

1057
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:47,087
I was wrong.

1058
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:49,557
Bless you

1059
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:54,626
I want to say something to you.

1060
01:29:54,881 --> 01:29:56,087
Yes tell me.

1061
01:29:58,514 --> 01:30:01,154
Even I love someone as you did.

1062
01:30:01,614 --> 01:30:02,957
So do it.

1063
01:30:04,614 --> 01:30:06,116
Want to marry her.

1064
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,588
Do it with grand.

1065
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,889
But my parents are not ready.

1066
01:30:12,947 --> 01:30:14,085
What should I do'?

1067
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:19,485
I eloped with Phaguniya.

1068
01:30:22,614 --> 01:30:24,525
Love has a lot of power, my child.

1069
01:30:29,414 --> 01:30:31,621
Can I say something?
You won't mind'?

1070
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,518
Why are you talking in riddles?

1071
01:30:34,214 --> 01:30:35,318
Tell me.

1072
01:30:36,614 --> 01:30:38,651
The one I love...

1073
01:30:41,147 --> 01:30:42,490
is... Rajkumaria.

1074
01:30:56,014 --> 01:30:58,517
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

1075
01:31:00,014 --> 01:31:03,257
Shut up dimwit.
You'll fix my son's marriage?

1076
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:07,290
Stupid, I'm not fixing it.
They have fixed it.

1077
01:31:07,514 --> 01:31:09,221
I've just come to give you
the good news.

1078
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,418
Here! Have some sweets

1079
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,960
I don't agree... Get lost.

1080
01:31:15,547 --> 01:31:17,288
They are new age kids.

1081
01:31:17,547 --> 01:31:20,858
What if they elope or
jump into the well?

1082
01:31:21,814 --> 01:31:23,851
For 16 years I've been
breaking the mountain

1083
01:31:23,914 --> 01:31:24,824
I can break anything

1084
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,860
but not the kid's hearts.

1085
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:30,490
Understand? Don't insult yourself
& eat some sweets.

1086
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:32,254
You're threatening me?

1087
01:31:32,381 --> 01:31:33,883
Why are you getting irritated?

1088
01:31:34,147 --> 01:31:35,956
Even I have a daughter.

1089
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,493
Who will marry her without money?

1090
01:31:38,547 --> 01:31:40,584
How will I get the money?
Will you give it?

1091
01:31:40,914 --> 01:31:42,518
Oh God..

1092
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,059
Two birds and one stone!

1093
01:31:44,147 --> 01:31:45,125
Tell me one thing.

1094
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:49,223
Your son my daughter...
and my son your daughter?

1095
01:31:50,114 --> 01:31:51,218
Fine?

1096
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,950
So what are you thinking?

1097
01:31:53,014 --> 01:31:54,152
Have some sweets!

1098
01:32:04,014 --> 01:32:05,084
Live long...

1099
01:32:06,047 --> 01:32:07,492
Make your own path.

1100
01:32:29,014 --> 01:32:31,255
Phaguniya would have danced...
all night.

1101
01:32:34,414 --> 01:32:35,893
Why don't you dance?

1102
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,418
Dance... dance.

1103
01:32:43,847 --> 01:32:45,918
Why are you standing like a statue.

1104
01:32:45,981 --> 01:32:47,289
The kids are getting married.

1105
01:32:47,347 --> 01:32:49,020
You need to bless them.

1106
01:32:49,414 --> 01:32:51,416
You are even older than me.

1107
01:32:55,114 --> 01:32:56,388
You won't change.

1108
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:58,153
Let me fix you.

1109
01:32:59,247 --> 01:33:00,248
What?

1110
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:01,723
Let it be today?

1111
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,154
OK I'll leave you today...
Enjoy!

1112
01:33:18,681 --> 01:33:21,218
No more than 2 sips...
now you come.

1113
01:33:22,014 --> 01:33:24,255
Go... throw the stones.

1114
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:27,816
You'll get more sweet water.

1115
01:33:30,047 --> 01:33:31,958
Remove all the stones.

1116
01:33:49,314 --> 01:33:51,157
We'll have more stones.

1117
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:53,420
Come next week and collect them.

1118
01:33:59,747 --> 01:34:04,025
To maintain peace and order,
all necessary steps will be taken.

1119
01:34:04,081 --> 01:34:07,688
Anyone who protests

1120
01:34:07,747 --> 01:34:10,353
will be jailed.

1121
01:34:10,614 --> 01:34:13,754
The Govt. Has declared
a state of Emergency.

1122
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,759
Hello.

1123
01:34:15,814 --> 01:34:18,727
Hello Reporter Sahab.

1124
01:34:19,847 --> 01:34:21,019
Welcome.

1125
01:34:21,814 --> 01:34:22,656
Tell me.

1126
01:34:22,814 --> 01:34:24,691
A grant was approved in his name.

1127
01:34:24,947 --> 01:34:26,290
We've come to collect the money.

1128
01:34:27,814 --> 01:34:28,292
What is the name?

1129
01:34:28,347 --> 01:34:29,690
Dashrath Manjhi.

1130
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:37,658
Dashrath Manjhi.

1131
01:34:37,914 --> 01:34:38,915
Exactly.

1132
01:34:39,081 --> 01:34:40,958
For breaking a mountain right?

1133
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:42,049
Yes...

1134
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,918
But You have already
taken the money.

1135
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,921
I... didn't get any money.

1136
01:34:48,014 --> 01:34:49,755
Must be a mistake,
do check again.

1137
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:51,760
There's an entry in the register.

1138
01:34:52,047 --> 01:34:52,991
Here see "paid."

1139
01:34:53,047 --> 01:34:54,924
But I got no money.

1140
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,392
Trying to cheat the government?

1141
01:34:58,714 --> 01:35:00,625
But I didn't get any money.

1142
01:35:01,747 --> 01:35:03,920
Wolf in a lamb's clothing eh'?

1143
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,891
- Relax.
- Trying to teach me?

1144
01:35:05,947 --> 01:35:06,891
Go away.

1145
01:35:06,947 --> 01:35:08,187
OK... understood.

1146
01:35:08,247 --> 01:35:09,749
Go - Understood.

1147
01:35:11,647 --> 01:35:12,648
We'll speak to the BDO come on.

1148
01:35:12,714 --> 01:35:14,625
But I didn't get money.

1149
01:35:16,647 --> 01:35:17,990
Ruaab babu...

1150
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,583
BDO sir...

1151
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:22,957
Why are you pissing fire?

1152
01:35:24,081 --> 01:35:26,891
The money the Govt. Sent to
break the mountain, where is it?

1153
01:35:28,647 --> 01:35:31,025
What nonsense are you talking?

1154
01:35:31,081 --> 01:35:32,617
I went to the office.

1155
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,660
They said the money's gone!
So where's it gone?

1156
01:35:34,714 --> 01:35:36,557
Gone? How would I know?

1157
01:35:36,614 --> 01:35:38,116
Do you think I'm stupid?

1158
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:42,318
Can't I see'?
New car... This gold chain...

1159
01:35:42,847 --> 01:35:44,690
I want the money to
break the mountain.

1160
01:35:44,747 --> 01:35:46,055
What money?

1161
01:35:46,614 --> 01:35:47,786
Which money?

1162
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,819
Go. Bang your head against
the mountain.

1163
01:35:51,114 --> 01:35:53,321
Does the Govt. Have no other work'?

1164
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:55,318
You are trying to cheat me?

1165
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,025
What will you do'?

1166
01:35:57,581 --> 01:35:59,891
There is an 'Emergency'
in the country.

1167
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:03,518
If I put you in the jail
You won't come out in this life!

1168
01:36:03,581 --> 01:36:05,652
- I'll complain.
- To whom?

1169
01:36:06,047 --> 01:36:07,685
There's no government in Bihar.

1170
01:36:07,747 --> 01:36:10,956
Go-go to Delhi... (30 bang
your head there.

1171
01:36:11,014 --> 01:36:13,051
The government is listening
to everyone these days

1172
01:36:13,114 --> 01:36:14,787
I'll go to Delhi... If I have to.

1173
01:36:14,847 --> 01:36:16,485
But I won't spare you!

1174
01:36:18,014 --> 01:36:20,722
Delhi is very far you moron...

1175
01:36:20,881 --> 01:36:22,827
Do you even know
which country it is in'?

1176
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,087
I'll find out and I will get there!

1177
01:36:25,147 --> 01:36:26,922
- Go find it.
- The <i>***</i> a dog.

1178
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:28,119
Trying to cheat me?

1179
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,091
Throw him out.

1180
01:36:56,914 --> 01:36:58,018
Ticket?

1181
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,850
Ticket?

1182
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,081
Yes ticket.

1183
01:37:05,047 --> 01:37:06,117
That... I don't have sir.

1184
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,181
Where are you going?

1185
01:37:07,847 --> 01:37:09,849
Delhi... to meet the Prime minister

1186
01:37:10,014 --> 01:37:12,551
20 Rupees for ticket
& 20 Rupees fine-shell out 40

1187
01:37:14,114 --> 01:37:15,559
I've no money sir.

1188
01:37:15,614 --> 01:37:16,854
Is this your dad's train?

1189
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:17,949
Look at his guts!

1190
01:37:18,014 --> 01:37:19,994
They want a free ride!

1191
01:37:20,047 --> 01:37:20,718
Get down you bum

1192
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,783
I'm going to meet
the Prime minister, sir.

1193
01:37:22,847 --> 01:37:23,723
<i>Oh'?</i>

1194
01:37:23,781 --> 01:37:25,727
<i>***</i> beggar! Get down...

1195
01:37:55,414 --> 01:37:57,121
That was a little extreme...

1196
01:38:01,114 --> 01:38:03,355
Have some tea.

1197
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:06,889
Doesn't matter

1198
01:38:08,114 --> 01:38:09,457
I'll go to Delhi.

1199
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,388
On foot.

1200
01:38:13,481 --> 01:38:14,721
Are you out of your mind'?

1201
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:15,848
Why?

1202
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:17,951
It is 1300 km.

1203
01:38:18,047 --> 01:38:20,960
Think it's a joke? Walk to it!

1204
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:25,952
I need to go, so I will.

1205
01:38:28,914 --> 01:38:31,986
"Longing for a glimpse,."

1206
01:38:32,847 --> 01:38:35,885
"Crazed."

1207
01:38:36,747 --> 01:38:39,990
"An ecstatic Fakir."

1208
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:47,627
"Standing alone..."

1209
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:53,390
"Embracing the sky."

1210
01:38:56,714 --> 01:38:59,388
"O' traveler... O' traveler."

1211
01:39:00,847 --> 01:39:04,522
"The soldier of light."

1212
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:18,856
"Walk, and a path will emerge."

1213
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,456
"Your dreams will
illuminate the world."

1214
01:39:49,981 --> 01:39:51,927
"Come, get up you fool."

1215
01:39:51,981 --> 01:39:54,325
"Make your path."

1216
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,951
"Smile, and celebrate life."

1217
01:40:01,547 --> 01:40:03,584
"The world will change."

1218
01:40:03,647 --> 01:40:05,354
"Only if you change."

1219
01:40:05,413 --> 01:40:10,658
"The story now
will start with you."

1220
01:40:12,614 --> 01:40:16,756
"If there is a spark,
there will be a fire."

1221
01:40:45,414 --> 01:40:50,329
"Destination is just a limit
of your determination."

1222
01:40:50,447 --> 01:40:54,395
"Desires too many
& Wishes boundless."

1223
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,385
"Who know what will happen...
& when."

1224
01:41:01,447 --> 01:41:05,418
"Only you know what
you will do now."

1225
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,295
"Your deeds will create
your story."

1226
01:42:33,714 --> 01:42:36,217
Come on. Move from here.

1227
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:38,261
This useless government...

1228
01:42:38,314 --> 01:42:41,227
Took your votes in the name of
removing poverty.

1229
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,816
But removed the poor!

1230
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,292
This poor villager...

1231
01:42:45,514 --> 01:42:47,687
all by him self

1232
01:42:47,747 --> 01:42:50,523
has cut a path
through the mountain!

1233
01:42:50,614 --> 01:42:54,687
He has walked with us all the way
from Bihar.

1234
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,159
If it can't give
us food or clothing

1235
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:00,194
the government is useless!

1236
01:43:00,247 --> 01:43:01,783
Break up all of you!

1237
01:43:01,847 --> 01:43:03,554
Get lost! Get away!

1238
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:06,615
What is it?

1239
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,422
I need to meet the prime minister.

1240
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,653
I know her... look at this.

1241
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,318
Thousand comes here every day!

1242
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:16,552
By the Kilo!

1243
01:43:16,614 --> 01:43:17,592
Crazy coot!

1244
01:43:17,647 --> 01:43:19,422
It's their job to get photographed.

1245
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:21,256
And you useless sod!

1246
01:43:21,347 --> 01:43:23,725
Get one photo clicked and you think
you are a leader?

1247
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,591
"Long live mother India."

1248
01:43:27,414 --> 01:43:28,358
Take this!

1249
01:43:28,414 --> 01:43:29,654
And after today,

1250
01:43:29,747 --> 01:43:33,160
If I see you here, I'll shove you
into the jail.

1251
01:43:33,414 --> 01:43:34,620
Load him onto the train to Bihar.

1252
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,216
Move.

1253
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,282
The ***...take him away.

1254
01:44:07,414 --> 01:44:08,415
Dashrath.

1255
01:44:20,747 --> 01:44:22,226
Phaguniya!

1256
01:44:25,114 --> 01:44:27,253
You've come... after so many days!

1257
01:44:28,081 --> 01:44:29,389
What happened?

1258
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,524
You were making a road,
weren't you'?

1259
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:34,528
Enough... enough already...

1260
01:44:36,348 --> 01:44:38,259
No hope anywhere.

1261
01:44:39,214 --> 01:44:40,454
Nothing will ever change.

1262
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,183
Every one called me Mad...

1263
01:44:43,247 --> 01:44:46,592
Everyone else was right.
I was wrong.

1264
01:44:48,447 --> 01:44:51,223
A little stumble and
you shatter?

1265
01:44:52,047 --> 01:44:57,121
The world is a web of deceit...
ruled by the powerful.

1266
01:44:57,447 --> 01:44:59,085
And I'? I'm alone...

1267
01:45:00,214 --> 01:45:01,557
I'm tired...

1268
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:04,154
And old.

1269
01:45:06,047 --> 01:45:07,492
Can't do this anymore.

1270
01:45:08,581 --> 01:45:10,356
Remember Dashrath.

1271
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:12,992
You took an oath to make the path.

1272
01:45:14,214 --> 01:45:17,093
This path will be made and
you will make it.

1273
01:45:17,147 --> 01:45:19,525
It's no use..

1274
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,552
No one cares...

1275
01:45:25,647 --> 01:45:28,025
Nothing will change

1276
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:31,460
I thought.

1277
01:45:31,947 --> 01:45:34,655
You are making me a Taj Mahal.

1278
01:45:44,014 --> 01:45:46,324
Why are you staring wide eyed'?

1279
01:45:47,214 --> 01:45:49,694
Pick up your hammer and chisel
and break the mountain.

1280
01:45:51,381 --> 01:45:54,191
Or I will never talk to you again.

1281
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:40,886
Babe, you are not alone anymore!
Everyone is with you.

1282
01:46:40,947 --> 01:46:44,121
This path will now
be made very soon.

1283
01:46:47,581 --> 01:46:51,552
Great! Fantastic! Alive!

1284
01:47:08,914 --> 01:47:10,154
He broke the damn mountain.

1285
01:47:10,214 --> 01:47:11,989
And that's their leader
Dashrath.

1286
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,821
You start the proceedings.

1287
01:47:14,114 --> 01:47:15,218
Hey! Stop it.

1288
01:47:15,281 --> 01:47:17,818
With whose permission are
you breaking this mountain?

1289
01:47:17,881 --> 01:47:19,918
This property belongs
to the Forest department.

1290
01:47:19,981 --> 01:47:21,255
You trying to grab it?

1291
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,221
Who is this Dashrath Manjhi?

1292
01:47:24,347 --> 01:47:25,451
Catch the bugger!

1293
01:47:25,514 --> 01:47:26,959
Tie him up.

1294
01:47:27,381 --> 01:47:28,985
Bring him here.

1295
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:33,551
Is this your dad's mountain?

1296
01:47:34,081 --> 01:47:35,560
And where are all the stones?

1297
01:47:35,814 --> 01:47:37,054
<i>***.</i> .. gobbled them?

1298
01:47:37,114 --> 01:47:38,024
Sold them?

1299
01:47:38,081 --> 01:47:41,153
He wants to become
the stone mafia...

1300
01:47:41,414 --> 01:47:42,984
No sir,

1301
01:47:43,047 --> 01:47:46,256
We were making a path
for the village

1302
01:47:46,947 --> 01:47:47,925
to make it easy.

1303
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:48,924
Make it Easy eh'?

1304
01:47:48,981 --> 01:47:50,119
Easy...

1305
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,181
Fool!

1306
01:47:51,414 --> 01:47:53,291
Let me make it easy for you.

1307
01:47:53,414 --> 01:47:55,189
Stealing a mountain?

1308
01:47:55,414 --> 01:47:56,893
You think it's a joke?

1309
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:59,460
If anyone even steps here again.

1310
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:03,360
Your properties will be confiscated
and you'll rot in jail.

1311
01:48:03,514 --> 01:48:06,085
Take him.

1312
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,217
Get in...

1313
01:48:10,747 --> 01:48:12,886
Messing with the law eh'?

1314
01:48:16,147 --> 01:48:17,854
Bloody mountain thief.

1315
01:48:18,114 --> 01:48:20,321
For 20 years he's been breaking
government's property.

1316
01:48:20,747 --> 01:48:22,954
Politics of the hammer!

1317
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:26,252
Prosecute him in such a manner
that he dies in jail.

1318
01:48:27,014 --> 01:48:28,322
Hanged till death.

1319
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:31,191
Oh, die!

1320
01:48:35,214 --> 01:48:36,784
Now sing your hymns.

1321
01:48:37,381 --> 01:48:39,054
Your story is over.

1322
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,951
Once you mess with the govt.

1323
01:48:44,014 --> 01:48:46,051
Even God has to surrender.

1324
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:08,819
Phaguniya...

1325
01:49:10,747 --> 01:49:13,284
I feel I have lost...

1326
01:49:15,747 --> 01:49:17,385
I'll die before the task is done...

1327
01:49:20,247 --> 01:49:22,853
May be my love lacked something...

1328
01:49:23,914 --> 01:49:26,292
Maybe I was too weak...

1329
01:49:29,147 --> 01:49:31,320
May be the God didn't want it.

1330
01:49:32,247 --> 01:49:33,851
May be...

1331
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,319
It makes no difference.

1332
01:49:44,147 --> 01:49:46,058
Release Dashrath Manjhi!

1333
01:49:46,114 --> 01:49:47,787
Release him! Release him!

1334
01:49:50,047 --> 01:49:51,390
Who are they? What do they want'?

1335
01:49:51,447 --> 01:49:52,687
Don't know.

1336
01:49:52,747 --> 01:49:54,385
Then don't just stand!
(30 find out!

1337
01:49:54,447 --> 01:49:55,221
Yes sir.

1338
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:59,090
Calm down.

1339
01:49:59,147 --> 01:50:01,286
Why've you arrested him'?
He's innocent.

1340
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,082
Until you release him,
nobody'll go from here.

1341
01:50:08,247 --> 01:50:10,249
Sir they have come
to get him released.

1342
01:50:10,314 --> 01:50:12,885
They say he's falsely implicated...
he's a saint.

1343
01:50:12,947 --> 01:50:16,759
They'll go on a hunger strike
until he's released.

1344
01:50:16,814 --> 01:50:19,317
Sir I think he is a political man.

1345
01:50:23,047 --> 01:50:24,720
Release the joker! Hurry.

1346
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:26,055
What about the forest department?

1347
01:50:26,114 --> 01:50:30,119
They stuff their <i>***</i>
with bribes and we face the crap.

1348
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,158
Get him out.

1349
01:50:31,214 --> 01:50:33,194
Move... move.

1350
01:50:33,281 --> 01:50:35,921
Dashrath Babe! Long Live!

1351
01:51:16,014 --> 01:51:17,288
Come on!

1352
01:51:18,681 --> 01:51:20,683
With all your might... "Haissa."

1353
01:51:20,747 --> 01:51:22,124
All together... "Haissa."

1354
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:24,160
Louder now... "Haissa."

1355
01:51:37,947 --> 01:51:40,188
Dashrath Babe! Long Live!

1356
01:52:44,647 --> 01:52:46,888
An age has gone by...
In your memory...

1357
01:53:14,914 --> 01:53:17,019
How much I love you!

1358
01:53:17,214 --> 01:53:18,591
So much...

1359
01:53:19,214 --> 01:53:21,717
"That no mountain can stop it..."

1360
01:53:22,614 --> 01:53:25,151
That sky cannot contain it...

1361
01:53:25,614 --> 01:53:27,992
That no one can imagine

1362
01:53:30,881 --> 01:53:32,155
I know...

1363
01:53:59,747 --> 01:54:01,021
You've performed a miracle!

1364
01:54:01,147 --> 01:54:05,095
Dashrath Manjhi you are
a super man! You are Mr. India!

1365
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,957
Alone with a hammer and chisel!

1366
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,553
Tell me... after making
the impossible, possible.

1367
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,954
What would you like to say'?

1368
01:54:16,047 --> 01:54:19,551
What can an illiterate
man like me say'?

1369
01:54:20,614 --> 01:54:21,854
Say something

1370
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:26,154
I say - Don't depend
too much on God...

1371
01:54:27,681 --> 01:54:29,888
May be God depends on us...

1372
01:54:29,912 --> 01:54:45,912
