1
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,710
There she is.

2
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,364
Morning Sweetheart, how is the number?

3
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,968
Inspirational.

4
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:18,039
You spoil me.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,974
So have a heart attack.

6
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:22,176
I'm gonna try adjusting your dose.

7
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:23,778
How long have you been awake?

8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:25,179
I never really slept.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,249
Yeah, I could feel you obsessing all night.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,384
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:31,752
Problems at the office.

12
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:34,522
Aw, poor you.

13
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:36,858
I'm about to replace a
nine-year-old's liver.

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,060
Oh.

15
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,263
Remember... 30 minutes of cardio.

16
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:45,231
Do I get to pick which kind?

17
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,873
Inflation looks fine.

18
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,875
But tell BLS I want those wage numbers

19
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,277
as soon as they come in. Oh, Andy...

20
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:00,081
have my cappuccino ready
when I get to the office.

21
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:01,849
Let me bottom-line this for you:

22
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,317
you want the first lady to use

23
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:04,919
your flowers in her arrangements,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,587
grow 'em in America.

25
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:09,624
Senator... Senator, I think
the national science advisor

26
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,727
is a little more qualified
to speak on this topic.

27
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,663
Well for starters, he's a scientist.

28
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,404
Senator, I'm gonna have to call you back.

29
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:31,644
Okay.

30
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:36,017
Okay.

31
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,551
That'll work.

32
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,553
A meeting at 7:00 a.m.

33
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:41,622
On a Monday. I mean, who does that?

34
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:45,359
â™ªBesides you. That would be the
president's cybersecurity czar.

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,161
He does know he's not
an actual czar, right?

36
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:48,296
Yes.

37
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:50,965
If he was an actual
czar, he would delegate.

38
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,100
- He's briefing us in person.
- Why would he do that?

39
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,436
Ah. Take a wild guess.

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,141
Oh, good morning.

41
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,510
- Morning.
- Early morning.

42
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,646
So let's make this, uh, brief.

43
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,582
Of course. Uh, major government breaches,

44
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,252
including the one at OPM,

45
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,887
have been traced

46
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,855
to personal accounts on UNCLASS

47
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:17,825
government computers.
So, starting tomorrow,

48
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,894
the State Department and
other government agencies

49
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,395
will expand

50
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:24,031
the two-step verification
system from SIPRNet

51
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:25,499
to all personal accounts accessed

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,335
on government computers, including

53
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:29,537
e-mail, banking, and social media.

54
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:33,240
So I need a 16-digit,
alphanumeric password

55
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,842
just to log in to Facebook?

56
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,911
Or compose a tweet? That's ridiculous.

57
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,079
So is Facebook.

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,581
Okay, Inspector Gadget.

59
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:43,250
- Any other questions?
- Um, yes.

60
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,987
Do I need to worry about my car

61
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:49,155
being hacked remotely?

62
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,260
I heard it's a thing.

63
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,795
Mr. Moran.

64
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,998
Honestly, yes.

65
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,900
If you want to play it safe,
you can bike to work, like me.

66
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,302
Uh, Mr. Shaw, you're needed

67
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:03,337
immediately at the White House.

68
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:04,472
Is the secretary coming?

69
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,773
She'll meet you there.

70
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,344
I'm gonna have to cancel
tonight, I'm sorry.

71
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:11,645
What is it?

72
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,115
It's complicated. I...
I mean, it's classified.

73
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:16,851
- Sorry.
- It's fine. You should go.

74
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,251
I'll call you.

75
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:24,524
Uh... Uh, can someone give me a ride?

76
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,629
My apologies, Mr. President.

77
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,932
All right, let's get started.

78
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,634
Director Ware?

79
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:35,770
As you know, we've had a lot
of near misses in the hunt

80
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,372
for George Lasko, aka Dash,

81
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:41,876
the man responsible for the
cyber attack on Air Force One.

82
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:44,612
One hour ago, we pinpointed his location

83
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,814
in Koh Kong, Cambodia.

84
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:49,650
Is this human or signals intelligence?

85
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:51,485
It's both. Mr. Shaw?

86
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,155
Two weeks ago, we got a
tip from an ex-associate

87
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:56,323
that Dash was somewhere in Southeast Asia.

88
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,858
So I designed an algorithm

89
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,527
to hunt through Interpol
surveillance footage.

90
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,896
And using that search tool, CIA

91
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,432
focused its attention on ports of entry.

92
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,300
Today we got a hit.

93
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,903
This is Lasko entering Cambodia

94
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,838
yesterday under an assumed name.

95
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:14,108
We traced that same name to
a location near this river,

96
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,177
where we believe he is still residing.

97
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,079
How long do we have?

98
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,147
Not long. Ever since the attack,

99
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:23,017
Dash has never stayed in one
place for more than 48 hours.

100
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:25,619
And this footage is already a day old.

101
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,455
Sir, SEAL Team 4

102
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:30,124
is on a JSOTF mission in the Philippines.

103
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,227
We could redeploy them to the
target in less than three hours.

104
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:35,729
In a highly sensitive area.

105
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,198
Your point being?

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,067
A military extraction is risky.

107
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,602
Loud and m-messy.

108
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,371
I would suggest a CIA Ops team.

109
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:45,606
Small,

110
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:47,541
- quiet and effective.
- Like the one in Turkey,

111
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,543
that left one American dead.

112
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:52,646
Um...

113
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,482
Ephraim, how-how quickly

114
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:56,150
could we get a Black Ops team ready?

115
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:58,385
Nearest assets are at Bangkok Station.

116
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,835
12 hours, minimum.

117
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,756
- All the more reason to send in the SEALs.
- Mr. President,

118
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,126
our relationship with Cambodia is crucial

119
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,627
to keeping China in check.

120
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:09,263
We go in guns blazing, and
we're dealing with more than

121
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,398
just a few broken windows...
we're looking at the death

122
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,835
of our diplomatic strategy in the Pacific.

123
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,670
Honestly, who cares?

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,573
This guy hacked Air Force One.

125
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:22,543
I'm with Craig on this. Get Dash now,

126
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,377
mend fences later.

127
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,047
I agree with Secretary McCord.

128
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:28,682
The quieter the better.

129
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:31,744
- Go on.
- Look, we have two objectives here.

130
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,988
We want to get the man,
sure. But we also need

131
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,589
access to his data. That's the only way

132
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,258
to find out the truth about what happened

133
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,593
with Air Force One. If anything
happens to his equipment

134
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,961
or if Dash gets killed...

135
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:43,164
We'll be back to square one.

136
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,964
Point taken.

137
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,236
Let's let the CIA take the
lead on this one, Craig.

138
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,308
Better hope to God he's still there.

139
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:57,978
You heard the news about Admiral Hill,

140
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm assuming?

141
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,150
Yes. I'll, uh, be sad to see her go.

142
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:05,119
Yeah, I won't.

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,155
Hill and Secretary McCord
were natural allies.

144
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:09,557
Have a seat. Coffee?

145
00:06:09,558 --> 00:06:11,358
Uh... yes, please.

146
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,626
With the admiral gone,

147
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,261
there's room for a new voice

148
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,664
that comports with
POTUS's better instincts.

149
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:17,998
Meaning yours.

150
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,501
Yours, too.

151
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:23,537
That little Cuba stunt notwithstanding.

152
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,838
I don't follow.

153
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,474
Sure you do.

154
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,310
You and Senator Parisi

155
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,278
tried to sabotage the Cuba deal.

156
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,846
That's absurd.

157
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,015
Do you really think I would

158
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,517
stab the president in the back?

159
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,186
I know you did.

160
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:42,690
But you're lucky.

161
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,458
We've got an election coming up.

162
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,228
We can't afford another
Andrew Munsey situation.

163
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,930
So you get a pass. One.

164
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,932
In other words, you have no proof...

165
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,302
for whatever it is you think I did.

166
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:58,439
McCord knows about Cuba, too.

167
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,108
She wants to go to the president.

168
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:05,045
Your word against his star pupil from CIA?

169
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:08,616
I don't like your odds there, sport.

170
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:11,352
I shut her down, obviously, but...

171
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,653
I expect something in return.

172
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,024
Right now...

173
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:20,127
she thinks I'm working against you.

174
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,129
But if we play our cards right,

175
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,530
we can turn the tables.

176
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,566
Box her out for good.

177
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,934
Which you want because?

178
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,673
Because of that extraction in Cambodia,

179
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:34,441
which is just the latest example

180
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,910
of her pulling POTUS
into reactive positions

181
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,546
that are bad for national security,

182
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,415
not to mention his reelection prospects.

183
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,386
'Cause you're less of
a liability than she is.

184
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:47,488
And 'cause I don't like her.

185
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:50,758
And that brings us to
Ellen Hill's replacement.

186
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,360
I think General Reeves is our guy.

187
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:57,431
Kelsey Reeves to chair the Joint Chiefs?

188
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:00,501
I'd have to vet him.

189
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:03,537
Trust me, he's clean.

190
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,773
And he gets what we're trying to do.

191
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:08,575
POTUS still values your counsel.

192
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,744
A good word from you would go a long way.

193
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,612
Well, I'll think about it.

194
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,681
Don't piss me off, Craig.

195
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,353
Why not?

196
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:21,654
What are you gonna do?

197
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,392
My job is to provide the
president an impartial opinion.

198
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,995
If Reeves is the right candidate
for the job, I'll back him.

199
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:31,397
If not... I won't.

200
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,570
Thanks for the coffee.

201
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:55,289
I've been officially summoned to Moscow.

202
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,225
My flight leaves this afternoon.

203
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,493
We knew this was coming.

204
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,297
I'm not ready.

205
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,799
Do you remember how to
get to the secure phone?

206
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,670
Men's room past security,
near carousel four.

207
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:13,674
Toilet paper dispenser,
Second stall past the sinks.

208
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,376
Dmitri.

209
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:17,176
You're ready.

210
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:28,088
There's a rumor that Maria
Ostrov might appoint Doroshevich

211
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,591
as the next chief of the general staff.

212
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,660
If that's true, you'll have access

213
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,563
to the military planning
at the highest level.

214
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,632
That's good news, Dmitri.

215
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:41,234
That's what we planned.

216
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,543
Dmitri, I know what you're
putting at risk here.

217
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:51,945
And I promise I will do everything

218
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:53,747
in my power to keep you safe.

219
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:56,816
That's me talking, that
is not the U.S. government.

220
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,288
I spoke to my sister Talia this morning.

221
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:04,124
Her tumors are shrinking,

222
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,527
but you probably knew that.

223
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,395
I heard from the team in Stockholm.

224
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:10,330
They're predicting a full remission.

225
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:13,267
Yes.

226
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,234
She is very happy.

227
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:19,138
Thanks, professor.

228
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,810
For everything.

229
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:25,111
Good-bye.

230
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,583
Do svidaniya.

231
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,565
Up there.

232
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,474
Sterling's not there yet.

233
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:55,808
Why not?

234
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,245
You can lead a horse to water...

235
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,450
So now what?

236
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:06,086
I think it's pretty
obvious... we give him a nudge.

237
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,655
And when the moment comes...

238
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:11,290
we gut him like a pig.

239
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:20,547
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

240
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,803
What kind of a nudge are we talking about?

241
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:33,424
We can't exactly blackmail Sterling

242
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,526
- to back Reeves.
- Unless Russell knows

243
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,760
something I don't know.

244
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,909
I vetted him myself. There are rumors,

245
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,544
but nothing a reporter would care about.

246
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,180
Which in Washington, makes Craig
Sterling a bona fide unicorn.

247
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:44,176
A unicorn

248
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,343
that has to endorse General
Reeves for Joint Chiefs.

249
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,568
Until he does, my part
of the plan can't happen.

250
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,403
The essential problem is Sterling

251
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:52,805
- doesn't view you as a threat.
- Not yet, anyway.

252
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,240
So where's the nudge?

253
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:56,709
- I don't have it yet.
- Then what good are you?

254
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,978
You're the one who brought
Judas to the White House.

255
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,814
A lecture on loyalty from
the Dark Prince of K Street?

256
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,516
I want this guy gone.

257
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:05,718
Traitors are like serial
killers; they don't stop at one.

258
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,387
Exactly. So let's tell Dalton.

259
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:11,190
- That's not possible.
- Not if we want to win an election.

260
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:13,192
If the Cuba thing leaks, it's a scandal.

261
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,694
The president needs plausible deniability.

262
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,028
No reporters asking him

263
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,334
what he knew and when he knew it.

264
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,639
Trust me, we've gamed it out.

265
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,333
Sterling has to go of his own volition.

266
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,834
That's the only way to eliminate him

267
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,803
and protect the president at the same time.

268
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:26,305
Well, frankly, that's not my
problem at a certain point.

269
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:29,208
Tensions with Russia are escalating daily,

270
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,944
and the longer Craig Sterling
stays in the situation room,

271
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,546
the closer we get to war.

272
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,114
If he doesn't resign,

273
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:36,415
and fast,

274
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,218
I'm going directly to the
president. Are we clear?

275
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,953
Well, I'll look forward to
putting that on his schedule.

276
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,392
Don't tell Carol.

277
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,630
A wise man once said, "The stiffest tree

278
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,964
is the most easily cracked."

279
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,535
What is that, Sun Tzu?

280
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:56,569
Actually, it's Bruce Lee.

281
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,436
The point is, I've got the nudge.

282
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:01,207
You want to take Sterling down?

283
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,577
Let's see how far he'll
bend before he breaks.

284
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,422
Guess who was in my office this morning.

285
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,958
McCord's hatchet man.

286
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,593
Mike Barnow?

287
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,361
And his stupid dog.

288
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:24,426
My assistant's allergic...
it caused a hell of a...

289
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,965
What did he want?

290
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,200
Copies of my official schedule

291
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:31,904
from last week, when we were
meeting about the whole...

292
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:33,272
Don't say it.

293
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:35,840
Not here.

294
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,478
I thought Russell Jackson
had her under control.

295
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,148
He does. She's just
looking for a back door.

296
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,916
You mean like going to the press?

297
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:47,486
Maybe. But we have to
play this very carefully.

298
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:50,256
What did you tell him? Barnow.

299
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:53,526
That I was taking some personal
time for prayer and reflection.

300
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,461
He didn't buy it.

301
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,430
Well, he doesn't have to.

302
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,966
Unless there's something to find?

303
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,001
Of course not.

304
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:03,970
Hey, I handled things at my end.

305
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,870
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

306
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,540
Thanks, Jamie.

307
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,943
I mean it.

308
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:23,321
_

309
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:52,769
_

310
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:55,011
_

311
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:56,942
_

312
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:58,507
_

313
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:08,734
CIA capture team ready to breach.

314
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,605
They're entering now.

315
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,552
Clear!

316
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:27,753
He's gone.

317
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,989
What did we expect? We were too slow.

318
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,895
Hang on. We got something here.

319
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,662
It's a body.

320
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,300
What the hell?

321
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:42,568
Polonium.

322
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:43,836
I've seen it before.

323
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,605
Ephraim, do your guys have
a Geiger counter with them?

324
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,207
Shelby, radiation check.

325
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,375
Stand by.

326
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,779
He's crapped up.

327
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,181
He's hot.

328
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,383
- Get them out of there.
- Bag and tag.

329
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:58,951
Roger that.

330
00:15:58,952 --> 00:16:01,721
Polonium poisoning.
There's only one country

331
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,823
that uses that method of assassination.

332
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,323
Russia.

333
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,828
They were obviously behind
the hack on Air Force One.

334
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,330
Now they're covering their tracks.

335
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:15,900
Mr. President, I think it's time
to consider retaliatory options.

336
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,772
Elizabeth, do you think this is actionable?

337
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,575
Polonium in and of itself isn't proof,

338
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,810
but... if we get secondary confirmation

339
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,812
from that tech, yes, sir.

340
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,147
Evacuating now.

341
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:30,249
I think we should retaliate.

342
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,151
Good. General Kohl.

343
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,552
I want strike options

344
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,821
from CyberCom on my desk in 12 hours.

345
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,323
Yes, Mr. President.

346
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:53,263
- I'm going to the president.
- We're not there yet.

347
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:54,531
You heard him.

348
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,368
We are on the verge of
a cyber war with Russia.

349
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,270
I... If that's where it goes, fine.

350
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,873
But Craig Sterling is
just a little too excited

351
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,376
- at the prospect for my taste.
- Mine, too.

352
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,578
Well, then let's end it now.

353
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,114
Let's expose the scheme
with Senator Parisi...

354
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:11,815
And destroy Conrad's legacy.

355
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,751
Is that really what you want?

356
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:15,252
Come on, listen, listen.

357
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:17,921
I once spent two days in a deer blind

358
00:17:17,922 --> 00:17:20,057
near Lake Wissota,
nothing but caffeine pills

359
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:22,326
and squirrel jerky to keep me awake.

360
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,561
I came home with a ten-point buck.

361
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:25,796
You what?

362
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,765
Some things are worth the wait.

363
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,533
Not with Maria Ostrov on the throne.

364
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:31,969
She's already amassing troops
on the Ukrainian border.

365
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,103
Either we...

366
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,139
What do you think about General Reeves?

367
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,673
Craig Sterling just proposed him

368
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:38,442
to replace Ellen Hill.

369
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:41,245
Excellent. That's a...

370
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:43,347
good choice, I'm thinking.

371
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:44,281
Russell?

372
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,283
I agree with the secretary on this one.

373
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,485
- He's a fine candidate.
- Good.

374
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,454
He was on my short list, too.

375
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,790
Have OGC get into it.

376
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,225
Yes, sir.

377
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,463
See? Nudge worked.

378
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:01,398
Now you're a threat.

379
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,668
I'm gonna call Mike and tell
him to tee up the reporter.

380
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,770
I would say I told you so,

381
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:08,538
but you know I'm above that.

382
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:12,709
Squirrel jerky. Really?

383
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,678
Yeah.

384
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,146
I wouldn't recommend it.

385
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,446
_

386
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,387
You hear anything?

387
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:26,356
No. But Dmitri's now been MIA

388
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:28,358
for more than eight hours.

389
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,461
It's possible there's
an innocent explanation.

390
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,496
Well, I admire your optimism, Professor.

391
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:35,265
Look, Dmitri will lay low
until he sees an opening.

392
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,667
That's how he was trained.

393
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,502
I'm sure he'll recover the phone soon.

394
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:39,636
Problem is, he can't.

395
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:42,973
- Why's that?
- We had the phone removed.

396
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,008
We couldn't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

397
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,244
How the hell is he supposed to contact us?

398
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:49,746
There's a strong possibility
Dmitri's been exposed.

399
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,649
- Or he defected.
- No. We can't make that assumption.

400
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,718
Either way, we're in a holding pattern.

401
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,153
What does that mean?

402
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:57,754
We just sit on our hands?

403
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,790
No. We have agents retracing his steps,

404
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,725
hacking into his service records.

405
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:05,661
But, Henry, the simplest
explanation is... we lost him.

406
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:09,533
I refuse to believe that.

407
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:12,134
Let me know when you have something.

408
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,774
Harvest Glow

409
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,110
melon extract... the natural rejuvenator.

410
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,082
...discover the natural...

412
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,251
You think this stuff really works?

413
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,887
- Not a chance.
- See, that's what I thought.

414
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:33,290
But the melon doesn't age.

415
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,391
It's weird.

416
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,726
How much did you buy?

417
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:36,793
I...

418
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:39,228
Just... the sample pack.

419
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,733
Two sample packs.

420
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,136
So...

421
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,905
you've had a lot of...

422
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,540
extra work lately.

423
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,577
Are there any actual TV shows on?

424
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,879
Because God forbid we should talk?

425
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,619
You have a bad day?

426
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,389
Just your typical national security opera.

427
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,358
Puccini or Strauss?

428
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,794
What's the one where
they all die in the end?

429
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:16,832
Well, if it's any consolation,
I had a rough day, too.

430
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,435
I'm listening.

431
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:23,005
You first.

432
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,913
You know, I get we're
duty-and honor-bound,

433
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:32,549
committed to lives of service and all that,

434
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,152
but this part where we can't talk

435
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,921
about the most important
things that we do all day,

436
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,891
uh, that... cannot be healthy for us.

437
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:44,460
The most important part of
my day is this, coming home.

438
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:47,731
Oh, you're good.

439
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,299
And your skin looks beautiful.

440
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,802
- Pushing it.
- It's so smooth.

441
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,770
Wait till you see it

442
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,005
after a bucket of that stuff.

443
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,476
Sorry I had to cancel on you the other day.

444
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:02,279
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- Oh, no apologies necessary.

445
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,748
- But go on.
- Uh, there's this vineyard in Mount Airy

446
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,283
that's actually supposed to be pretty good.

447
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,052
- I figured we would drive up there...
- Not bike?

448
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:11,088
Yeah. Uh, no.

449
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:12,889
I actually figured we'd Zipcar.

450
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,759
Did you know the average car goes unused,

451
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,394
like, 90% of the day?

452
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,662
It's crazy inefficient.

453
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,664
So kind of like an all-day thing?

454
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:23,467
Yeah. We could... do a tasting,

455
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,935
enjoy a picnic.

456
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,870
I have cleared my schedule accordingly.

457
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,039
Well, I got to check mine.

458
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:35,512
Aw, Saturday's no good. I'm sorry.

459
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,648
Oh, that's no problem.
What about next week?

460
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,018
Pretty bad, too.

461
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:42,819
How about if I call you?

462
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,454
Uh, no, sure. Yeah.

463
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,322
Absolutely.

464
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,526
Well, I will... I will talk to you then.

465
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,631
Are you blowing me off

466
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:55,877
because you think I blew you off?

467
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,334
Because, but for matters
of national security...

468
00:21:57,335 --> 00:22:01,271
I know. It was an unintentional,
classified blow-off.

469
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:04,274
Got it. Uh, Nadine.

470
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,442
Excuse me. I got to...

471
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:08,744
Oh. Absolutely. Uh, peace.

472
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,682
Peace?

473
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,985
- Didn't mean that.
- This article

474
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:17,287
is why God made expense accounts.

475
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:21,157
I need an extension. Yes, another one.

476
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:23,960
You... Oh. Crap.

477
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,495
Let me call you back.

478
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:27,464
Gordon, you remember Vanessa, don't you?

479
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,199
Hi, Mike.

480
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,500
I know what you're thinking.

481
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,669
Is this a friendly hello,
or is it the other thing?

482
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,571
Spoiler alert: it's the
other thing. You're due.

483
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:36,206
Geez. Already?

484
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:38,442
You owe me a favor, not a birthday card.

485
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,843
You're due when I say it's due.

486
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:42,312
Yeah, I was sort of hoping
you'd get hit by a bus first.

487
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:43,714
Tough luck.

488
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,215
Got a job for you.

489
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:47,084
And what happens if I refuse?

490
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:51,154
Nothing. Your dull, uninspiring
life will continue as ever.

491
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,190
Oh. So there's incentive.

492
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:57,794
Mmm. There's an opening in
Public Affairs at the Pentagon.

493
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:00,297
Deputy Communications
Director to the SecDef.

494
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,399
Just a hop, skip, and
a jump away from a gig

495
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,834
on a major news network.

496
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:06,603
What's the pay grade on that, GS-12?

497
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,471
More like 14.

498
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:08,838
Are you serious?

499
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:12,608
Are you gonna throw that ball?

500
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,651
There you go. See?

501
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,452
It's easy.

502
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:28,225
I have Vanessa Chung

503
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:29,792
from The Chronicle on the line.

504
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,464
You know they have
software for that, right?

505
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:37,333
I'm old-school.

506
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,439
Vanessa.

507
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,774
How can I help you?

508
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,742
Hi, Craig. It's been a while.

509
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:49,579
I'm, uh, doing a profile on that
nominee for the Joint Chiefs,

510
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,815
General Reeves. I
understand you endorsed him.

511
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:52,949
That's right.

512
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,785
Was there a quid pro quo on that?

513
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:57,821
Because I have information that
he bribed you for your support.

514
00:23:57,822 --> 00:23:59,456
That's absolutely ridiculous.

515
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:01,858
Can I quote you on that?

516
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,828
No. Who the hell is your source?

517
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,229
Mm, it's high-level, Craig.

518
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,731
- You care to comment?
- No.

519
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:10,934
And if you print any of
this, I'll sue your ass.

520
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:14,337
- You hear me?
- Nice try. It's running tomorrow.

521
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:18,675
When exactly did this
alleged bribery take place?

522
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:22,444
Last Thursday, Dryden House in Georgetown.

523
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,683
I wasn't even there.

524
00:24:26,684 --> 00:24:27,651
Do you have proof?

525
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,152
What, for every minute of the day?

526
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,453
Yeah.

527
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,890
Craig.

528
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,393
You there?

529
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:38,027
Craig?

530
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,731
You set me up.

531
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,700
I beg your pardon?

532
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,769
Reeves is dirty, isn't he?

533
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,605
That's why you made me
endorse him before I was ready.

534
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,875
That's why I am getting phone
calls from Vanessa Chung.

535
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:52,943
From The Chronicle?

536
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:54,377
She just accused me

537
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:57,280
of meeting Reeves last
week and taking kickbacks.

538
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,850
And you think I'm the source?

539
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:02,519
This is funny to you?

540
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,888
This is my career we're talking about.

541
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:06,923
Take a breath. You really think

542
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,758
I'm gonna expose the president to a scandal

543
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,261
with an election coming
up? Come on. It's a bluff.

544
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:15,397
How much you want to bet that
reporter is working for Mike B.?

545
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:21,838
Just to screw me.

546
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,609
Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.

547
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,310
What about the story?

548
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,079
Just to screw me.

549
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,849
Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.

550
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,785
What about the story?

551
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,320
Give her an alibi.

552
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,188
I can't.

553
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,526
It involves a certain
senator from Illinois.

554
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:48,197
Well, that's unfortunate.

555
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,569
All right.

556
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,037
I can kill the story.

557
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:57,741
The editor and I go way back, but Chung...

558
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:59,109
Chung is a bulldog.

559
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,511
She's not gonna stop
until she has the truth.

560
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,747
What do you want me to do?

561
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,382
Handle it.

562
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:11,034
How do I know you're
not playing me right now?

563
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:14,090
Well, I gues you don't.

564
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:18,549
But, if you want to save your skin
you don't really have a choice, do you?

565
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:39,694
Dmitri's gone.

566
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:41,562
What? What-what do you mean?

567
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,999
I mean his file's been wiped
from the Russian system.

568
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,267
It's like he doesn't exist.

569
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:48,302
Damn it.

570
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:52,306
Someone wanted him to disappear,
and it sure as hell wasn't us.

571
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:55,376
That's why I'm pulling his support team

572
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:56,510
from Moscow.

573
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,845
Already? You can't do that.

574
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,714
It's my operation. I'll
do whatever I need to.

575
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:02,216
There are Russian troops
amassed on the Ukraine border.

576
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:04,185
We need solid Intel,

577
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,120
- now more than ever.
- Exactly.

578
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:09,223
And I can't afford to keep
assets in place for a kid who,

579
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:10,524
let's face it, is probably dead.

580
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,059
What if you're wrong?

581
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,761
You just want to write him off?

582
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,930
No. But if it comes to it,

583
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,998
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

584
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,833
Or do we have a problem?

585
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:24,003
No.

586
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,808
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

587
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,643
Hey.

588
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:32,646
I learned the hard way,
don't make this personal.

589
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,014
Okay.

590
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:35,649
Dmitri is in a position

591
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,486
to become the most highly
placed U.S. intelligence asset

592
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:39,820
we've ever had in Russia.

593
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,756
He deserves every chance we can give him.

594
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:45,626
Just... Come on. A couple
of days to make contact.

595
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,828
That's all I ask.

596
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:50,498
You have 24 hours.

597
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:53,366
If he doesn't make contact
by then, I'm shutting it down.

598
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:09,984
I definitely spooked him.

599
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:11,185
And the surveillance?

600
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:12,286
Already in place.

601
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,988
If he takes the bait, we'll be ready.

602
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,557
Good. What about our hacker?

603
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,359
Any word on the Russia connection?

604
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,060
We're still going through his effects.

605
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:22,696
It looks like he converted
20 million rubles, cash,

606
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:24,432
into bitcoin over a week ago.

607
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,066
Still not definitive.

608
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:28,836
Not until we know exactly
where that money came from.

609
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,571
I agree.

610
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:33,240
We need decrypts on that laptop.

611
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,508
Oliver Shaw is into it.

612
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:36,744
All right. Let me know
when you have something.

613
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:38,211
Yeah.

614
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:11,970
_

615
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:19,550
_

616
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:22,974
_

617
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:27,751
_

618
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:32,383
_

619
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,338
_

620
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,734
_

621
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:15,698
_

622
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:41,000
Petrov.

623
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,440
_

624
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:51,837
_

625
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,291
_

626
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:21,334
Oh. Uh...

627
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,339
_

628
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,260
_

629
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:46,854
_

630
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:00,340
Uh, Mr. Goodwin?

631
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:02,543
This is Arkady from the
Russian Fur Exchange.

632
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:05,946
I'm sorry for the delay, but
I just joined a new sales team.

633
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:07,548
Your custom order is ready,

634
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:09,616
and it includes an additional bonus gift.

635
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:11,351
We will be shipping

636
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:13,721
in a half hour with full tracking.

637
00:33:13,722 --> 00:33:15,723
Thank you. Good-bye.

638
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:37,444
Oh.

639
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,012
Oh. Hey, what's up?

640
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,582
Got a signal from Dmitri. He's okay.

641
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,517
Well, are you sure?

642
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:45,719
Yeah, he left a coded voicemail.

643
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,555
And he's been transferred to the GRU.

644
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:50,524
Okay, is he operational?

645
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,292
Yes, and he has something.

646
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:53,894
What is it?

647
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,864
I don't know. He's on his
way to the dead drop now.

648
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,499
Okay. ETA?

649
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,000
30 minutes.

650
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,102
Great. Thank you.

651
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,281
- What's going on?
- Sir,

652
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:23,115
you need to come with us.

653
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:30,357
Thanks, Armando.

654
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,961
Both of you.

655
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:36,430
I should have known.

656
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:39,900
Remember when I said you get a
pass for betraying the president

657
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,102
in the middle of negotiations with Cuba?

658
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:44,638
Well, I lied.

659
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,609
And you're detaining me, why?

660
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,277
Because you committed a crime.

661
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:53,080
No, I had a conversation
with a senator from Illinois.

662
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,381
Yes.

663
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:56,817
But then again...

664
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:58,752
there's this.

665
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:01,622
That's the planner you shredded
in your office last night.

666
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,056
Planner that contained

667
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:05,359
evidence of your conspiracy
with Senator Parisi.

668
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,995
"Contained" being the operative word.

669
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:10,597
You can't prove anything.

670
00:36:10,598 --> 00:36:12,933
- Thing is, we don't have to.
- That planner

671
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:15,936
also had notes of official
White House meetings.

672
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:19,806
By destroying it, you violated
the Presidential Records Act

673
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,341
of 1978.

674
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,644
It's a little thing they
introduced after Watergate.

675
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,612
Which, if I'm not mistaken, carries

676
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,614
a prison term of up to three years.

677
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:30,684
Probably more like 18 months
when all is said and done,

678
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:32,653
but still.

679
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,322
You can't do this.

680
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,324
We just did.

681
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,993
Way I see it,

682
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:43,664
you can leave out the back
door with your dignity intact,

683
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:46,967
or you can go out the front in handcuffs.

684
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:48,968
It's really up to you.

685
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,677
Son of a bitch.

686
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:59,112
Not bad,

687
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:01,148
as far as resignations go.

688
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:04,717
He always was a plain-spoken man.

689
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,623
Never should have trusted him.

690
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:12,626
I would say "I told you so,"

691
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:14,561
but you know I'm above that.

692
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,396
Ha!

693
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:18,899
Russell, this may be

694
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,600
the most relaxed I've ever seen you.

695
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:21,868
What can I say?

696
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,204
Career assassination is good for my heart.

697
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,607
Hello.

698
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:31,345
I see.

699
00:37:31,346 --> 00:37:33,646
Right away.

700
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:39,686
That was the Pentagon.

701
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:42,489
They've decrypted Dash's laptop.

702
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,958
We have secondary confirmation.

703
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,060
It was Russia.

704
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:49,361
They paid him.

705
00:37:57,394 --> 00:37:59,230
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this.

706
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:00,965
That makes two of us, sir.

707
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:03,551
By the way... Craig's resignation.

708
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,854
That was... sudden.

709
00:38:05,855 --> 00:38:08,122
Yes, Mr. President.

710
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,093
General Reeves still on track?

711
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:13,227
He'll breeze through the senate.

712
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:15,264
My team at CyberCom

713
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,900
has come up with three
possible retaliatory strikes

714
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,335
against the Russian Federation,

715
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:21,837
which we've designated Phases X, Y

716
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:23,305
and Z.

717
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:25,040
X is our least aggressive option.

718
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,409
We target the Ostrov administration itself,

719
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,347
initiating DNS attacks
against government Web sites.

720
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,848
Phase Y:

721
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,152
we expand that attack to
military infrastructure.

722
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:36,935
Deactivate satellites

723
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,737
and interrupt communications networks.

724
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:40,307
That alone should give them

725
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:42,907
serious thoughts about attacking
our interests in Ukraine.

726
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:44,409
And Phase Z?

727
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,678
The kitchen sink.

728
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:50,982
We do all of the above, plus,
we hit the Moscow power grid.

729
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,984
Give 'em a night they'll never forget.

730
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,722
Oliver,

731
00:38:57,723 --> 00:39:01,126
how prepared are we to
withstand a counterattack?

732
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:03,294
Sensitive networks have all been upgraded.

733
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:05,330
We're as ready as can be.

734
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:07,532
Good.

735
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:10,067
Because I want to make the Kremlin go dark.

736
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:15,707
Sir, I would strongly suggest

737
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,809
that you consider Phase Y instead.

738
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,144
Phase Y

739
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:21,279
is proportional, sir.

740
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,594
I'm aware of that.

741
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,482
I'm not looking for a
proportional response.

742
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:25,850
I want to send a message.

743
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:27,252
Going after the military

744
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:31,089
is one thing, but if we
publicly humiliate Maria Ostrov

745
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,425
in front of 12 million
of her fellow countrymen,

746
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:35,427
she'll have to retaliate.

747
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:37,996
I think she'll crumble
after the first punch.

748
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:41,900
Either way, it's time to
see what she's made of.

749
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,869
Conrad, I think this is a mistake.

750
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,073
You have eight hours to remove
our key personnel from Moscow.

751
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,208
Meanwhile, summon the Russian ambassador.

752
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,977
I want them to know
exactly what this was about.

753
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:54,145
Sir.

754
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:55,647
General Kohl, start the clock.

755
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,314
Yes, Mr. President.

756
00:39:57,824 --> 00:39:59,250
You need to talk to him.

757
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:00,819
There's nothing to discuss.

758
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,216
Then look me in the eye and tell me

759
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,351
that you're not afraid
of where this is going.

760
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,872
Come on. We got rid of Sterling

761
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:09,775
because we wanted to stop a
war. We can walk this back.

762
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,410
I got rid of Sterling

763
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,046
because he was sabotaging
the president's agenda.

764
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,647
And right now, that agenda

765
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:18,215
is sending the strongest
possible message to Moscow.

766
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,055
When the president makes a decision,

767
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:26,023
it's my duty to fall in line.

768
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,226
I suggest you do the same.

769
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,369
As you can see, Ostrov's
plans are much more aggressive

770
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,104
than anyone at the Pentagon anticipated.

771
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,274
She won't stop, not till
she has all of Ukraine

772
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,508
under military occupation.

773
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:45,477
Henry, this is a major intelligence coup.

774
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,980
Yeah, thanks, but I'm not the
one putting my life on the line.

775
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:52,317
We do owe a great deal to
your asset, that's true.

776
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:54,219
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,

777
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,388
because Dmitri left a handwritten note

778
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,356
with the plans in his dead drop.

779
00:40:58,357 --> 00:41:00,257
Saying what?

780
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,930
I hope he knows what that means.

781
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:07,532
That we can't protect him?

782
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,968
Oh, yeah. He knows.

783
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,241
Where will he go?

784
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:19,743
Best guess? He'll seek asylum
in Sweden with his sister.

785
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,280
At the end of the day,

786
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,915
she's pretty much all he's got.

787
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,495
Madam Secretary, the Ambassador of Russia.

788
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,101
Elizabeth.

789
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:18,036
I hope this is quick.

790
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:20,701
One of my girlfriends has
tickets for tonight's recital

791
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:22,035
at the Kennedy Center.

792
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:24,637
Oh, don't worry. It will be.

793
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:37,884
Mr. Ambassador, you have been summoned here

794
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:41,521
to answer for the illegal and
unconscionable cyber attack

795
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:44,458
your country made on Air Force One.

796
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,197
Air Force One was hacked?

797
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:49,896
In a deliberate assault... by your country.

798
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,312
I thought it was a solar flare.

799
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:53,769
Don't play games with me.

800
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,805
Please, Madam Secretary,
I'm merely trying to...

801
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,873
Just listen.

802
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:00,475
I have a message for your president.

803
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:04,947
The United States maintains its right

804
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:08,217
to retaliate when we deem it necessary.

805
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,219
Tonight...

806
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,088
we deem it necessary.

807
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:20,529
When is this happening?

808
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,032
Right now.

809
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:45,568
