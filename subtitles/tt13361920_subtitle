1
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:49,064
What sparked the origin of
a human from an ape was…

2
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:50,671
The fire in him.

3
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:53,812
Man has fulfilled the need
for food by lighting a fire.

4
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,807
Also spreading light by
converting it into a lamp.

5
00:00:57,923 --> 00:00:59,845
From time to time, he adds fuel
to the flames of desire within him…

6
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,252
Thereby kindling a blazing fire.

7
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:09,269
This flame that burns with emotions
like lust, anger, greed, pride and envy…

8
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,165
It turned him into ashes.

9
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:16,908
A gleaming beam of light has
become this blazing flame of fury.

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,380
This fire doesn’t mark
the beginning of this film.

11
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,061
In fact, it calls for the end.
And the reason behind it is…

12
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,892
"Desire is the root of misery"

13
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,470
"Desire is the root of misery"

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:39,001
"Desire only leads to greed"

15
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:46,478
"And avarice follows greed"

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,557
When desire intensifies, it’s greed.

17
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,612
And when greed intensifies, it’s avarice.

18
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,304
Desire is the foundation of misery.

19
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,259
This desire that’s the root of all misery…

20
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:04,093
lies in the deepest layers of our heart.

21
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,917
When you have a baby…

22
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,728
You desire to distribute sweets.

23
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:11,786
And when it’s a baby girl…

24
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,898
You desire to find her a suitor.

25
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,347
In case it’s a baby boy…

26
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,775
You desire to find him a beautiful woman.

27
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:22,701
After marriage,
you desire for them to have kids.

28
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,273
And if it’s  a baby girl,
you desire it should’ve been a baby boy.

29
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,131
Hey! Sit properly.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,875
Desires keep popping
in our heads all the time.

31
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,790
Is it possible to survive without desires?

32
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:44,746
Is it?

33
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,203
You tell me. Is it possible?

34
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,089
No.

35
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,618
Exactly!

36
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,652
Not possible!

37
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:54,430
No creature on Earth can do that.

38
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:55,812
Because…

39
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:59,059
The God who created us also created desire.

40
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:02,208
Hey!

41
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,748
He’s so engaging and you’re falling asleep?

42
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,989
He’s doing it ‘cause
he’s getting paid for it.

43
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:11,380
Ask him to do it for free.

44
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,171
I bet he wouldn’t talk shit.

45
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:15,990
Shut up!

46
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:18,248
It’s not like we’re paying him.

47
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,987
He manipulates the well-off for money.

48
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,527
And people like us for attention.

49
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,381
Such a despo!

50
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:28,750
Yeww! Stop it!

51
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,213
Don’t just blurt disgusting things.

52
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,860
I was born with disgust.

53
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:35,738
Can’t help it.

54
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,478
Shut up and listen.

55
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,013
We all decide to shut up and move on.

56
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,194
But, the heart wants what it wants, right?

57
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,378
Lust sees no divide.
Desires see no threat.

58
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,373
Lust is the origin of birth.

59
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,629
Desire is the origin of lust.

60
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,861
Desires are as common as lust.

61
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,408
But, ‘cause we’re living
in a civilized society…

62
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,926
We should have control
over lust and desire.

63
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,077
Otherwise, how are we
any different from animals?

64
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,612
Common, huh?

65
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,320
We should have control, is it?

66
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:18,351
I dare him to look into
my eyes for 2 minutes.

67
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:21,298
Let’s see if he’s got
his lust under control.

68
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:25,145
Or if he’s got his tool up.

69
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,889
Shut up!

70
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,962
Don’t say whatever comes to
your mind and embarrass me.

71
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:33,585
Let’s go home.

72
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,333
Venkayamma… we’re heading back.

73
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,740
Okay. Let’s go.
Hmm.

74
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:48,886
Where did you find that?

75
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,982
It was staring at me from the tree.

76
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,782
Pleading to come closer.

77
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,649
So I went ahead and plucked it.

78
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,872
I wish I got everything
I wanted this easily.

79
00:04:58,023 --> 00:04:59,460
You know, I don’t get you.

80
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:02,718
Your dad would be waiting for us.

81
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,977
Your alcoholic husband
would be waiting for you.

82
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:07,219
Not me.

83
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:11,395
If I were lucky enough to
find someone who cared…

84
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:17,228
I would’ve had 3-4 kids by now,
like the rest of my friends.

85
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:20,891
Malli, it should be in your destiny.

86
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,526
Your time should come.

87
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:25,816
If you stand and stare,
house is not coming any closer.

88
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,160
We should only walk to it.

89
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:29,707
Same goes for time as well.

90
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:33,004
Instead of being hopeless about it…

91
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:35,067
We should change our own destiny.

92
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:36,809
What are you looking at?

93
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:39,363
You wouldn’t get my pain.

94
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,985
What kind of a mother are you?

95
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,557
You’ve been my age once.

96
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,816
How could you still not get my pain?

97
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:47,930
Let’s go.

98
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:52,329
We have 3 more miles to cover.

99
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:53,996
Walk and think.

100
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:54,861
Come on.

101
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,169
Malli, I hear some
vehicle rattling outside.

102
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,939
Go take a look.

103
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,503
My life is depressing anyway.

104
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:19,058
Now I can’t even get a good night’s sleep?

105
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,635
Just go!

106
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,022
We're here. Endure for some time.

107
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,476
I can't walk, mom.

108
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,441
Mom, it’s Mr. Raju’s vehicle.

109
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,150
Oh! Mr. Raju’s daughter Sarasu is carrying.

110
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,838
Maybe she went into labor.

111
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,327
I’ll go and heat up some water.

112
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,246
You go and get a knife for
cutting the umbilical cord.

113
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,471
Go!
-Bear it a little longer.

114
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,999
Subbaiah, wake up! Subbaiah!

115
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,806
Go take a look.

116
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:04,056
Go away!

117
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:07,235
Come in, dear.

118
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:16,378
Be strong.

119
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,236
Sarasu, we’re almost done.

120
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,245
Just for a little longer.

121
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:25,394
Calm down, Sarasu. We’ll be done.

122
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,982
I can’t do it.

123
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:30,949
Stop screaming so much!

124
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:33,309
I won’t drink from tomorrow.

125
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,552
Sarasu! Push a little harder.

126
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:40,961
Malli, hold her hand.

127
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,998
Sarasu, it’s almost over.
It feels like I’m dying! Oh, god!

128
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,680
You could die if I drink again tomorrow.

129
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,383
Sleep for now.

130
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:54,819
Malli, tell your dad to
shut up for some time.

131
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:58,210
If he just listened, he wouldn’t be my dad.

132
00:07:58,742 --> 00:07:59,638
Mind your business.

133
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,748
Just a little longer.
It’s almost over, dear.

134
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:23,179
What the hell!

135
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:26,110
Why are you crying like a baby?
Go to sleep.

136
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,775
You’ve been a blessing.

137
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,489
It all went smoothly because of you.

138
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:34,817
I’m just like a Messenger.

139
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,811
My job is only to deliver the
almighty’s Creation to you.

140
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,532
Baby looks so cute!

141
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,352
Goes after his mother.

142
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,864
If the son looks like his mother…

143
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:47,615
He is said to be lucky.

144
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,699
“Go to sleep, my love”

145
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,994
“Go to sleep”

146
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,366
“Go to sleep, my dear”

147
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:28,055
“Go to sleep”

148
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:36,799
“I’ve given birth with love”

149
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:42,299
“I lay here with hope for your life”

150
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:48,141
“As the wind sways towards our tale”

151
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:53,607
“I just hope for a better future for you”

152
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,423
“Go to sleep, my love”

153
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,912
“Go to sleep”

154
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:02,052
“Go to sleep, my dear”

155
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:04,807
“Go to sleep”

156
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:44,566
“This poisonous world tries to spill venom”

157
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:50,108
“I hope you reign and conquer your life”

158
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:53,052
“The world is at your feet”

159
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,930
“Be one in a million”

160
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:04,242
“Mother’s love is always with you”

161
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,078
“Go to sleep, my love”

162
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:09,293
“Go to sleep”

163
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:12,681
“Go to sleep, my dear”

164
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,764
“Go to sleep”

165
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:21,282
“I’ve given birth with love”

166
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:26,865
“I lay here with hope for your life”

167
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,673
“Go to sleep, my love”

168
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,824
“Go to sleep”

169
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:35,345
“Go to sleep, my dear”

170
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:38,471
“Go to sleep”

171
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,972
Who’s there?

172
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:52,155
Who is it?

173
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,194
They left their footwear back here.

174
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,839
I don’t think they’re anywhere nearby.

175
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,780
Is anybody out there?

176
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:05,727
Sir!

177
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:12,703
Oh, no! Did they lose hope
on life and jump into the water?

178
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:14,079
Help!

179
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,764
Somebody jumped into the water. Help!

180
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,727
Somebody help!

181
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:20,417
Oh, no!

182
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:22,928
Sir…!

183
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,681
Somebody jumped into the water. Help!

184
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,673
Hey! Hey! Why are you yelling?

185
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,266
Oh, you’re alive!

186
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:37,400
Thank god!

187
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,213
I’ve been asking you to get out.

188
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:41,776
I thought maybe you were dead.

189
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,188
How can I respond from underwater?

190
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:46,037
Oh, yes.

191
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:49,012
For me, there’s not much difference.

192
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,085
Anyway…

193
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,459
Why did you leave all your
stuff out here and go underwater?

194
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:57,190
I was doing a procedure where
you hold your breath  underwater.

195
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:58,413
I was practicing.

196
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,405
Even Duryodhana from Mahabharata
used to perform yoga underwater.

197
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,354
You seem to be his disciple.

198
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:06,752
Nice! You know a lot of stuff.

199
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,188
God didn’t give me eyesight.

200
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,220
But he gave the art to learn.

201
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:13,741
By the way, you sound new here.

202
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,709
Where are you from?

203
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,344
I’m not from anywhere.

204
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,475
Yet, I belong everywhere.

205
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:20,378
I travel from place to
place to enjoy Nature.

206
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,637
You could call me a wanderer.

207
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:25,289
How do you afford your means then?

208
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,078
I’ve earned more than I’d need.

209
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,544
Thought it was high time
that I started travelling.

210
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:34,459
Oh. I hope your journey is a smooth one.

211
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:36,366
Your name?

212
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,000
Srinu. Srinivas.

213
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,379
And you?
Kannappa.

214
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:41,652
I get it.

215
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,109
You’re wondering if my parents
gave me that name or I did?

216
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,997
It’s the name I gave myself.

217
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,588
Lord Shiva gave Kannappa’s eyes
back to him when he offered them.

218
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,195
So, I named myself after him in the
hope that Lord Shiva will give me eyesight.

219
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,904
Your hope will be answered.

220
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,704
I see you’re holding flutes.
Is there a good artist in Kannappa?

221
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:02,340
Most definitely.

222
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:05,059
The flutes on my shoulder
are for making a living.

223
00:15:05,285 --> 00:15:07,520
The flute in my hand is for practice.

224
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,346
Well said! Play a nice song for me.

225
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:11,132
Let me see.

226
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:12,847
Will you see or listen?

227
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,472
I’ll listen while I see.
Just play.

228
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:16,113
Alright.

229
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,850
[gibberish chanting]

230
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,696
'Goddess of Wealth is
bestowing you with grace.'

231
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,340
Hear me out, sir.

232
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,376
Tell me if it’s true or false.

233
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:04,823
There’s no way it’d be a lie.

234
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,777
No lie would come out from this mouth.

235
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:13,441
I am the manifestation of Lord Shiva.
I was born with a purpose.

236
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,997
We don’t have the time to get to know you.

237
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:18,975
Or the patience to fulfill your wishes.

238
00:17:19,145 --> 00:17:21,069
Move on. Find someone else.

239
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,526
Don’t say you’ve got nothing.

240
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,258
I can see that the Goddess
of Wealth is in your favor.

241
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:28,370
Stop it, man!

242
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:29,889
What do you see?
Goddess of Wealth, huh?

243
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:30,448
Yes.

244
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:31,355
Come inside. Come on.

245
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,908
Hey! Search the entire house.

246
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:35,564
If you find a single penny…

247
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:36,920
I’ll give you 5 pennies.

248
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,003
If you don’t, just give me 2 pennies.

249
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:40,106
What say?

250
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:42,358
Goddess of Wealth, my foot!

251
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:44,232
Don’t say that, sir.

252
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,449
I’m definite when I say that
Goddess of Wealth is in your favor.

253
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,338
But if you’re not quick to act,
she will leave before you know.

254
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:59,224
But it’s quite late in the day.

255
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,809
Curses can’t kill us.

256
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:04,458
We’ve been dead for 15 years now.

257
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:08,192
Goddess would never curse you two.

258
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,504
In fact, she’s going to grant you a boon.

259
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:16,587
I’m just here to tell you
not to turn it into a curse.

260
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,157
She’s going to grant us a boon, huh?
Yes.

261
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,820
Is she going to fill our house with gold?
Yes.

262
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:26,267
There’s going to be a
shower of gold in your house.

263
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:30,316
It’s your responsibility
to protect that treasure.

264
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,690
We don’t have a locker to keep it safe.

265
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:34,500
We would need to dig a pit.

266
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:36,353
How deep do you think it should be?

267
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,429
Depends on what goes into the pit, sir.

268
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:42,298
Watch out and dig.

269
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,849
Come on! I’ve had enough of you two.

270
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,589
Didn’t I ask you to leave?

271
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,868
Dear…
Hey! Who are you?

272
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,688
Shut up and leave when you’re asked to.

273
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:57,741
If you cross your limits,
I’ll feed your tongue to my dog.

274
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:02,076
It’s Wednesday. Meat day for my dog.

275
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,052
Don’t do that, dear.

276
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,754
My tongue is my bread and butter. You know…

277
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,342
Hey! Shut up and get out of here.

278
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,314
You could gloat all you want.
But eventually,  we all end up in the soil.

279
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:11,478
True. In the soil.

280
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,783
But, it’s not ordinary soil.

281
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:14,893
In fact, it’s sacred.

282
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,985
You could make a playing
doll with it or an idol to worship.

283
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:21,376
It’s in your hands.

284
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:25,277
The dirt you’re going to get your hands on…

285
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,051
It will improve the quality of your lives.

286
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,770
You’re not just cursing anymore.

287
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,540
Now you’re trying to terrify us.

288
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:33,812
Get out of here!

289
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:36,173
If you make me furious…

290
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:38,765
I’m going to burn you
under a mountain of cotton.

291
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:41,976
Cursing us, is it?

292
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:28,314
Excuse me.

293
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,983
Hey! I said get lost!

294
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,844
Who are you?

295
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,143
What do you want?

296
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,694
Can I get some water?

297
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:41,725
Come in.

298
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,585
Thanks, amma.

299
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,627
Are you coming from the city?
Yes, amma.

300
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,385
You look educated.

301
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:05,606
What brings you here?

302
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,629
My name is Srinivas.

303
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:11,853
I travel across several villages
and write articles on my experiences.

304
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,770
I also draw cartoons.

305
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:15,003
What are cartoons?

306
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:17,554
Cartoons are comical pictures.

307
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:27,309
Oh! Those extremely animated
pictures in the newspaper.

308
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,665
Oops. I totally forgot.

309
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,564
I went to the temple here.

310
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,398
They gave the holy offering.
Please have it.

311
00:21:37,486 --> 00:21:39,711
Priest gave you the holy offering.

312
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:40,641
You should keep it.

313
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:43,329
Holy offering is meant to be shared.

314
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:46,089
We’re destined to be in this moment.

315
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:47,076
Please have it.

316
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,924
Amma, please don’t mind.

317
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:01,771
I’m feeling rather weak.

318
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:03,910
It will be night by the time
I reach the next village.

319
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,668
Can I spend the night here?

320
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:12,633
Whoa! Don’t you think
you’re taking advantage?

321
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,277
You’re too fast.

322
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:15,939
Please don’t get me the wrong way.

323
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:20,151
Listen, dear. We’re a poor family.

324
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,712
If you walk through the night,
you’ll reach the next village.

325
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,523
You’ll have all kinds of facilities there.

326
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:28,107
You won’t be able to stay here.

327
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:34,696
I travel across villages hoping
for some food, water and shade.

328
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,134
Even a rich house has a roof.

329
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,045
But my roof is beyond all roofs.

330
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:41,864
And that’s the sky.

331
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,691
I’ll not cause any trouble.

332
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,645
Just feed me some of what you eat.

333
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:49,911
I’ll sleep out here.
All I’m asking for.

334
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:00,492
I get it, amma.

335
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,002
You have a young lady in the family.

336
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:06,758
So you’re scared to let
a stranger into the house.

337
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,009
Am I right?

338
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:11,216
What did you say? We’re scared?

339
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:15,568
There’s not a single house
until a couple of miles.

340
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,976
Even if somebody
yells, not a soul will hear.

341
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,815
Do you know what I’m known for around here?

342
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,670
This isolated house.

343
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,296
We don’t fear ghosts.

344
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,174
Humans can do us no harm.

345
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,263
We’re not scared or anything.

346
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:34,675
Just hesitant ‘cause you’re a stranger.

347
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:36,971
Am I right, Malli?

348
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:41,177
Due to God’s grace,
we can afford to feed another soul.

349
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,764
We’ll just cook some extra rice for you.

350
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:47,458
Am I right, Malli?

351
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,613
Come on, guys! Not fair!

352
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,795
Don’t you two put this on me.

353
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:57,971
Do you want him to stay or leave?
It’s totally up to you.

354
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:06,357
Alright. Come inside, dear.

355
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:08,998
It’s okay, amma. I’ll sleep out here.

356
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:10,869
It’s okay. Come in.

357
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:14,827
You can see the sky from
inside our house as well.

358
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,213
[singing randomly]

359
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,448
Oh, no! Why are you doing this work?

360
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:08,380
‘Cause this is the only way
I’ll get to drink in the evening.

361
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,083
You want to join me?

362
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,850
No! No! I don’t drink.

363
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,275
I didn’t mean alcohol.

364
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:15,066
Do you want to have coffee or tea?

365
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,779
Oh, that would be nice.

366
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:17,789
Dear…

367
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,258
Yeah?

368
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,895
He wants a cup of tea.

369
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:22,318
He just said he’ll eat
whatever we give him.

370
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:25,367
Now he’s making demands.

371
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,029
What’s with him?

372
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,645
It’s not his demand.

373
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:29,530
It’s your dad’s.

374
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:34,590
Dear, we’ve got milk.
But there’s no tea powder.

375
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:37,738
We’re poor. We drink jaggery tea only.

376
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,549
We can’t afford sugar.

377
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,967
Come on! He is tired and wants some tea.

378
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,708
You didn’t have to talk to him like that.

379
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:49,483
Give me money and I’ll go get tea powder.

380
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,200
Make tea for him.

381
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:53,601
I know who wants tea here.

382
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,535
You’ve got money, right?

383
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,814
Buy your own tea powder.

384
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:57,960
I’ll make tea for you.

385
00:25:57,971 --> 00:25:59,277
No way! I don’t want your tea then.

386
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:02,978
Oh, no! It’s okay. I have
money. Here you go.

387
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:08,248
No. You’re our guest.
We can’t take your money.

388
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:09,536
It’s okay. Come on.

389
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:19,987
Shall I tag along?

390
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,626
No. My cycle can’t pull the weight of two.

391
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:24,071
I’ll be right back.

392
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,612
Alright.

393
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:25,260
Dad!

394
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,896
Get me orange candy with the change.

395
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:35,665
What are you looking at me for?

396
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:37,992
Don’t you want me to
milk the cow for your tea?

397
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:50,952
Your name is Malli, right?

398
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:52,853
It’s Mallika.

399
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,959
Mom and dad call me Malli.

400
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:56,968
Oh.

401
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,785
Then what should I call you?

402
00:26:58,895 --> 00:26:59,519
Huh?

403
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:01,121
Malli or Mallika?

404
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,962
Call me whatever you like.

405
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,888
But first, let me milk this cow in peace.

406
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,015
Alright, Mallka.

407
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:44,975
What’s this?

408
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:45,734
What’s what?

409
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,137
This.

410
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,521
Oh, that. It’s like a dumbbell.

411
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:53,862
Who works out here?

412
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:58,829
My dad used to. You
know, to be good in bed.

413
00:27:59,285 --> 00:27:59,734
What?!

414
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,032
He used to do it for strength.

415
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,825
You’re from the city, right?
You wouldn’t get it.

416
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:07,037
Forget it.

417
00:28:56,382 --> 00:28:57,567
Hey, dear!
What?

418
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:58,580
I bought tea powder.

419
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,478
Hey! Orange candy.

420
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:12,522
Give it to Malli.

421
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,135
Hmm.

422
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:52,548
Tea.

423
00:29:58,612 --> 00:30:00,067
It’s yummy. Thanks.

424
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:01,329
Thanks to you too.

425
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,393
Why?

426
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:07,619
Dad bought me orange candy with the change.

427
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,700
I also love orange candy.

428
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,061
Want me to get it?

429
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:12,750
Uh-huh. No.

430
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:15,670
If I eat anything sweet now,
I can’t enjoy the tea.

431
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:45,439
Not bad. Looks like the city lad works out.

432
00:30:46,587 --> 00:30:51,810
People who work out
shouldn’t drink tea and stuff.

433
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:53,505
Then?

434
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,745
You should drink milk.

435
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:57,879
Let me know if you want.

436
00:30:58,668 --> 00:30:59,583
I’ll milk it for you.

437
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,344
I’ll milk it for you!

438
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:09,895
I knew it!

439
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:13,660
I knew it was all cock and bull stories.
Somebody’s yelling.

440
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,952
It’s some crazy guy.

441
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:16,801
Doesn’t sound crazy.

442
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:20,289
Not everyone can see
how crazy some people are.

443
00:31:21,903 --> 00:31:24,640
Finish the tea. It’s cooling down.

444
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:30,124
Malli! Hey, Malli! Veeranna is here.

445
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,586
You stay here, son.

446
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:42,637
Where did she go?

447
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:46,469
Hey! Do you have any sense at all?

448
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,929
I asked you to water the crop last night.

449
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,580
What were you up to, huh?

450
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:54,100
It was a no-moon day last night.

451
00:31:55,182 --> 00:32:00,752
Pandit asked me not
to step out of the house.

452
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,540
You get all superstitious when
you have to water my crop.

453
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:07,664
But when you need money,
there’s no such superstition.

454
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:10,247
You’re not at loss here.

455
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,734
I have to bear the
damages if the crop dries out.

456
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,888
Money is more important to me than time.

457
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,022
You know me.

458
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:20,303
I’ll tolerate this only as long as I do.

459
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,935
If you keep this up,
I’ll rip your skin off.

460
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,832
Mind your tongue, Veeranna!

461
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:28,894
Don’t go on and on about your crop.

462
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,185
We mortgaged it to you ‘cause of the debt.

463
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:36,774
We’re not your gardeners
to take all your crap.

464
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,963
Don’t just blurt whatever
comes to your mind.

465
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:44,092
Sister, what did I say now?
I swear on my curly mane, I said…

466
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:49,059
‘You can’t be like ignorant.
You have a daughter to take care of.’

467
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,943
Stop it! That’s enough advice for a day.

468
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:53,442
Take a look in the mirror.

469
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,506
Everybody knows the kind of person you are.

470
00:32:55,949 --> 00:32:57,502
We don’t need a moral lecture from you.

471
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,018
It’s not like that, sister.

472
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:04,333
I know how much you’re struggling
‘cause of his mistakes and debts.

473
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:05,388
That bothers me.

474
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:08,711
There’s a way to end your struggle.

475
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,424
Only if you change your mind about…

476
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:14,894
But he’s not ready to do that!

477
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,465
Stupid!

478
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,357
Stupid dog!

479
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:22,615
Just drink your milk.

480
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:24,502
Why are you licking my hand?

481
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:28,669
Look at your face.

482
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,566
You’re a dog. Better act like one.

483
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:35,242
Just ‘cause you have the liberty,
don’t act all mushy.

484
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,986
I’ll chop it off.

485
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,498
Your tongue!

486
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:45,053
Mr. Veeranna…

487
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:45,454
Huh?

488
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:50,867
I’ll make sure dad goes
to work from tomorrow.

489
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:52,259
You can go now.

490
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,465
It’s rather humid these days.

491
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,801
I wouldn’t suggest you to step outside.

492
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:01,992
Go home, have buttermilk and take a nap.

493
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:04,581
The heat in your body will subside.

494
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,688
Hey, dog! Drink it.

495
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,054
Dad!
Hmm?

496
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:23,490
You’ve been pounding
that thing for hours now.

497
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:26,800
Like you’re the only one working here.

498
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,915
You can’t live without making mistakes.

499
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:30,524
Or get a work done without any noise.

500
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:34,248
I’m very well aware of all
the things you do in silence.

501
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:34,769
Hey!

502
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:38,577
I loved your tea, amma.

503
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:42,784
It was filled with love and affection.

504
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,024
Mm-hmm.

505
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:47,206
You could sense all
of that in a cup of tea?

506
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:49,215
I’ve never had the
fortune of my mother’s love.

507
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:53,100
Even a small greeting
feels like a shower of love.

508
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,315
Excuse me...

509
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,690
I could see that the man who
came earlier really bothered you.

510
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:01,921
Who is he?

511
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:03,098
Loan shark.

512
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:05,400
Hold this.

513
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,637
A farmer’s life is really tough.

514
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,989
I own this house and
the 9 acres surrounding it.

515
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,336
We were really well
off at one point of time.

516
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,646
So much so that maybe even God got jealous.

517
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,102
He started troubling us.

518
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,024
First, he damaged our crop.

519
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:29,793
Then, he went for our health.

520
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:33,871
So much money went into
hospital expenses and medicines.

521
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,082
We were helpless.

522
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:38,853
I had to take a loan.

523
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:40,895
We slow down for a second.

524
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,880
And the debt keeps piling up.

525
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:47,543
Interest kept on increasing.

526
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:49,799
We couldn’t afford to pay it anymore.

527
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:53,838
We had to mortgage the
house and land to the loan shark.

528
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:58,578
Our misfortune took a toll on us.

529
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:01,882
We had to put our self-respect
aside and take the insults.

530
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:04,171
This is a sad way to live.

531
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:05,713
We can’t just die either.

532
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,033
Consider it passing with the stream.

533
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:11,458
Forget it.

534
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,820
Now we’re the labor in our own land.

535
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:19,644
Our family was one to aspire for.

536
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,694
Now we’re a token for misfortune.

537
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,623
When will our problems go away?

538
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:34,545
Soon, amma.

539
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,457
All your problems will go away.

540
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:39,394
When? After I become old?

541
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,345
Amma, how much money
do you need to pay your debt?

542
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:07,034
Let’s not talk about that now.

543
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,502
It’s okay. Tell me.

544
00:37:08,513 --> 00:37:11,131
25,000 rupees debt. 35,000 rupees interest.

545
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,131
We told you that we’re in trouble.

546
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,897
But we didn’t ask for your donation.

547
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,808
It’s not like that, Mallika.

548
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:12,664
I’m an orphan.

549
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,876
I’ve worked hard and earned
this all by myself since I was a kid.

550
00:38:16,888 --> 00:38:17,850
There’s three of you.

551
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,399
You guys are strong.

552
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:21,107
Good-hearted.

553
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:22,848
Money is not permanent.

554
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:24,649
I have it today.

555
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:25,789
Tomorrow, it will be yours.

556
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:28,982
Man can make anything possible.

557
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,773
What matter is trust and hard work.

558
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:35,115
You took me in, though I’m a stranger.

559
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,950
Good happens to the good-hearted.

560
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,306
I’m not saying I’ll
give you all this money.

561
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,700
If I could earn so much alone…

562
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:49,316
Imagine what the three of you could do.

563
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:53,723
If you think I’m being
unreasonable, forgive me.

564
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:56,104
That’s not necessary, dear.

565
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:59,305
We can see that it’s hard earned money.

566
00:39:01,844 --> 00:39:03,750
Oh, no! It’s bad omen.

567
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:05,908
Malli, go take a bath.

568
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:06,375
Hmm.

569
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:09,543
Dear, keep all this inside and take a bath.

570
00:39:09,554 --> 00:39:10,270
Why?

571
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:12,361
You should take a bath
when a lizard falls on you.

572
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:13,412
It’s a superstition.

573
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:14,780
Go!

574
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:16,161
Alright.

575
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,489
Hey, Malli!

576
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,916
I asked you to bathe for the sake of it.

577
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,697
What’s taking you so long?

578
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,855
Almost done, mom. Coming.

579
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,762
Me and your dad are going to the field.

580
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,977
Okay. Come back fast.

581
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:12,226
Ask dad to stick to work.

582
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:13,153
Shut up!

583
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:16,394
You’re becoming a loose tongue day by day.

584
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,752
Keep an eye on the house.

585
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:20,196
Be careful!

586
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,466
Got it.

587
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,693
You don’t have to stress so much!

588
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,896
You know me!

589
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:28,786
I do! But it’s my
responsibility to tell you.

590
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:29,617
See you.

591
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:30,606
Hmm!

592
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,287
If I had known about the lizard…

593
00:41:50,536 --> 00:41:51,732
I would’ve heated some water for you.

594
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:55,073
I don’t think you’re used to cold showers.

595
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:57,020
Of course, I am.

596
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,168
I don’t get hot water every place I go to.

597
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:00,784
Be it a river, lake or well…

598
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,402
I dive into whatever I can find.

599
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:05,233
You believe in all this stuff?

600
00:42:07,477 --> 00:42:10,110
You know… bad omen, etc.

601
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:12,629
You shouldn’t look for
logic in ancient sciences.

602
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,629
Everything our ancestors
said had a reason to it.

603
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:16,949
I believe in that.

604
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:21,181
On top of that, amma insisted.
So I had to oblige.

605
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:25,606
You look tough on the outside.

606
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:28,402
But you’re good at heart.

607
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:29,830
You too.

608
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:31,847
You sound harsh.

609
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,031
But the get the image of
Goddess Lakshmi when I see you.

610
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,330
Stop lying!

611
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:41,426
Goddess Lakshmi is decked in gold.

612
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:44,298
She doesn’t have a bare neck like me.

613
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,061
If gold is all that’s missing…

614
00:42:46,826 --> 00:42:47,671
I have gold with me.

615
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,283
Let’s adorn you in that.

616
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,988
No way!

617
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,342
I want to try it on once though.

618
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,223
Shall I?

619
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:46,621
What’s wrong?

620
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:49,717
Stepped on a thorn.

621
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:51,967
It hurts.

622
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:52,903
Where?

623
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,389
What do you think you’re doing?

624
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,607
Aren’t you ashamed to
do that in front of a guy?

625
00:44:36,636 --> 00:44:37,426
What did I do?

626
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:40,671
Are you seriously asking me that?

627
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:43,840
I’ve been watching you ever since I came.

628
00:44:44,576 --> 00:44:45,711
Your glances are deceiving.

629
00:44:46,974 --> 00:44:48,506
You look at me with the wrong intentions.

630
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,453
When a young lady acts like this…
That makes me a whore, huh?

631
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:54,117
So you’re calling me a whore now.

632
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:54,998
Am I right?

633
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:57,832
My leg was hurt.

634
00:44:58,511 --> 00:45:00,703
So I pulled my clothes up to take a look.

635
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,110
That was it.

636
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:05,705
I wasn’t trying to flash
my thighs and seduce you.

637
00:45:07,498 --> 00:45:08,755
I wanted to try on the jewelry, right?

638
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,811
So you think my character is loose.

639
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:13,765
It’s true that I’m not married yet.

640
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:19,505
But I never once thought of
throwing myself at someone.

641
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,579
So I never did.

642
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,270
Mallika…

643
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:54,600
Hmm?

644
00:45:56,614 --> 00:46:00,316
I’m sorry if I was hurtful.

645
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,871
It’s okay.

646
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,937
That made it pretty evident
that you’re a good man.

647
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:08,360
You can’t obviously be
with someone you don’t like.

648
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:09,401
Forget it.

649
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:10,049
What did you say?

650
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:11,628
Nothing.

651
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,241
Your parents aren’t  back yet?

652
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:17,937
Any minute now.

653
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:43,485
Hey! Playing snake and ladder
after sunset brings misfortune.

654
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:44,017
Keep it away.

655
00:46:44,793 --> 00:46:46,821
Is that going to make us lucky?

656
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:47,677
You’ll never change!

657
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:49,617
Enough! Mind your business.

658
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:57,470
Dear…

659
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:58,884
Amma…

660
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:01,789
I’m making steamed rice balls for dinner.

661
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:02,619
You’ll eat, right?

662
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,700
Yes, amma.

663
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,119
Don’t worry. It tastes good.

664
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,372
I know, amma.

665
00:47:08,513 --> 00:47:09,048
Alright then.

666
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:12,859
Amma…

667
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:14,805
Yes?

668
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:20,813
I initially said that I’d
eat whatever you give me.

669
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:23,496
Please don’t mind that
I’m asking differently now.

670
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:28,304
I wish to eat your chicken curry.

671
00:47:28,373 --> 00:47:29,246
Can you make it for me?

672
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:30,558
What did you say?

673
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:31,932
Chicken curry?

674
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,059
You can’t just wish for
chicken curry and have it served.

675
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,929
This is not a hotel , dear.

676
00:47:39,184 --> 00:47:39,965
It’s our house.

677
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:41,019
Not possible.

678
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,984
Oh, no! Don’t let the idea baffle you.

679
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,055
Tell me what the expenses are. I’ll pay.

680
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:45,701
How much will it cost?

681
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,279
Around 20 rupees.

682
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:51,767
No big deal. Take 200 rupees.

683
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:53,994
200 rupees?!

684
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,747
Buy what all you need for the curry.

685
00:47:57,345 --> 00:48:00,186
With the rest, buy what you love.

686
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,008
Hey! Return his money. Right now!

687
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,642
Why are you insulting
us by giving us money?

688
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,802
Oh, no. That was not my intention.

689
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:11,522
I feel like eating chicken.

690
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:12,645
That is why I gave the money.

691
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:15,771
It’s alright. He wants to eat chicken.
Make it for him.

692
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,128
She’ll make it. Don’t worry.

693
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:18,973
Tell me what all you need.

694
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,462
When have you ever listened to me?

695
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,069
Well, we’ve got garlic and ginger.

696
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:27,048
Get masala spices and onions.

697
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:28,330
Hmm. Okay.

698
00:48:28,562 --> 00:48:30,262
You chop the chicken and marinate it.

699
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,234
I’ll be right back.

700
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,808
Malli, come here.

701
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,367
Hmm.

702
00:48:33,553 --> 00:48:35,121
Excuse me... Listen!

703
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:38,718
Yes? You want a bottle?

704
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:39,467
No.

705
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:42,332
My stomach is upset.

706
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,065
I don’t know where the washroom is.

707
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:45,389
Can you show me?

708
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:47,481
There’s a small lake in the back.

709
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:48,755
Do it there.

710
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:51,132
Be careful. There might be bugs.

711
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:52,347
Take a lantern with you.

712
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:53,667
Alright.
Go. Go. Quick.

713
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:56,134
I asked for 20 bucks and he gave 200.

714
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,971
He might’ve given 1000
bucks if I asked for 200.

715
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:58,924
Of course!

716
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:02,084
He has loads of cash
and jewelry in his suitcase.

717
00:49:13,286 --> 00:49:16,080
Goddess of Wealth is
going to present you a boon.

718
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:20,007
There’s going to be showers
of wealth in your house.

719
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:24,765
It is your responsibility
to safeguard that treasure.

720
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,709
The dirt you’re going to get your hands on…

721
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:32,082
It will improve the quality of your lives.

722
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,986
Why do you look lost, dear?

723
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:42,992
Are you angry that I yelled at you earlier?

724
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,000
I don’t take such petty things to heart.

725
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,553
Yeah, right. You put on a good act.

726
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:51,577
Done grinding the spices?

727
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,352
Hey! Don’t make it too smooth.

728
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,834
Mom, have you ever given 200
rupees when they only need 20?

729
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,505
I’m not crazy to do that.

730
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:04,600
I know, right?

731
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:07,107
Then why did he give 200 bucks?

732
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:10,888
I have a feeling it’s not
his hard earned money.

733
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,864
But he said that it was.

734
00:50:14,123 --> 00:50:17,744
If it was his money,
he wouldn’t spill it like that.

735
00:50:18,543 --> 00:50:19,602
That money belongs to somebody else.

736
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:21,891
He’s just having fun with it.

737
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:24,290
It’s not his hard earned money.

738
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:25,898
He stole it.

739
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:27,795
Hey! He’ll hear you.

740
00:50:28,145 --> 00:50:29,105
He’s not home.

741
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,417
He went out.

742
00:50:31,648 --> 00:50:33,517
Why do we care how he got his money?

743
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:38,840
If we don’t care,
our lives will never get better.

744
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:39,609
What?

745
00:50:40,944 --> 00:50:44,168
What if his money and gold became ours?

746
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:46,726
How is that possible?

747
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,040
If he’s alive, it belongs to him.

748
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:50,067
What if he’s not?

749
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:55,448
He said we’re destined
to share the holy offering.

750
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,420
I say we’re destined to take his wealth.

751
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,173
You chop the chicken for the curry.

752
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:06,164
And the guy who eats the curry…

753
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:32,872
You’re acting insane.

754
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,094
You’re right. I’m tripping on desire.

755
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:37,382
You don’t have the right to talk.

756
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:39,670
You enjoyed your youth.

757
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:42,571
Nobody cares about my pain.

758
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,540
None of you have any idea what I desire.

759
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:48,112
I can’t be any honest than this.

760
00:51:48,124 --> 00:51:51,488
It will make the both of us uncomfortable.

761
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,558
There’s only one solution
to all our problems.

762
00:51:56,445 --> 00:52:00,001
And that’s… killing him!

763
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,361
Hey! No!

764
00:52:06,431 --> 00:52:08,890
If you still can’t get it into your head…

765
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,113
I can’t help it.

766
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,711
Veeranna has a thing for me.

767
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,032
To repay the debt you guys took…

768
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,728
I’ll go sleep with him.

769
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:22,473
So, you’re saying we kill him?

770
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,689
You heard that fortune teller this morning.

771
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:30,527
Goddess of Wealth is
going to present you a boon.

772
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:33,104
The dirt you’re going to get your hands on…

773
00:52:33,678 --> 00:52:36,369
It will improve the quality of your lives.

774
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,492
That’s not it.

775
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:43,981
A lizard fell on my left
shoulder and his right palm.

776
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,280
You always said that…

777
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:49,332
When a lizard falls on your left shoulder,
you’ll get wealth.

778
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:52,287
And on the right palm, it’s death.

779
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,253
He’s fated to die in our hands.

780
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,568
And that’s his destiny.

781
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:00,364
Malli…

782
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:02,290
I’m…

783
00:53:02,992 --> 00:53:04,471
I’m somehow scared.

784
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:06,331
Hey…

785
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:13,107
Dear…

786
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:15,675
I bought 100 grams of coriander powder.

787
00:53:16,288 --> 00:53:17,475
You know what she’s saying?

788
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,554
A bunch of coriander

789
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,597
and curry leaves.

790
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,128
Are you even listening to me?

791
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,449
I also bought cloves,
cinnamon and poppy seeds.

792
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:30,270
She wants to kill him.

793
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:37,767
Let’s kill him.

794
00:53:46,046 --> 00:53:47,902
It’s not so easy to do it.

795
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,141
It’s like an opportunity came knocking.

796
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:53,156
Why miss it?

797
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:58,873
Even I want be done with Veeranna.

798
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,288
Sweetheart,

799
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,382
as a father,
I never fulfilled any of your wishes.

800
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:10,532
If this will do you good,
I will go to any lengths.

801
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:15,163
As women, you do what you have to.

802
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,394
As a man, I’ll do my part.

803
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:23,291
Feed him chicken curry,

804
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:25,535
you also eat some and go to sleep.

805
00:54:26,727 --> 00:54:27,614
By dawn…

806
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,103
Excuse me!

807
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:33,737
Looks like you’re absorbed
in the conversation.

808
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:38,739
You didn’t forget about my curry, did you?

809
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:43,970
I was just telling her
how much the spices cost.

810
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:45,661
And the change…

811
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:48,616
I asked you to keep it for later.

812
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:51,657
You were going to get
something for yourself, right?

813
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,055
Didn’t you?

814
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,102
I’ll go now.

815
00:54:56,853 --> 00:54:57,697
Go fast.

816
00:54:58,022 --> 00:55:00,139
Chicken curry will be waiting for you.

817
00:55:02,414 --> 00:55:03,577
You guys do your thing.

818
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:06,398
I’ll be right back.

819
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:49,578
Amma…

820
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,167
What is your opinion on killing?

821
00:55:55,283 --> 00:55:57,853
I mean,
we’re killing this hen for chicken now.

822
00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:00,219
I want to know your thoughts on that.

823
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:05,196
You only asked us to kill it.

824
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,446
Of course.

825
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:12,329
But I feel it’s wrong to kill
another creature to feed ourselves.

826
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,655
Aren’t you going to eat the curry now?

827
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,549
Of course, not.

828
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:18,087
Just trying to make conversation.

829
00:56:18,552 --> 00:56:19,796
Wouldn’t starve myself.

830
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:22,922
This has to die if you want to eat curry.

831
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,384
You’re right.

832
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:27,981
But I wish we could relish that
taste without having to kill the hen.

833
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:29,660
If one thing has to survive…

834
00:56:29,984 --> 00:56:31,457
Something else has to die.

835
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:32,717
That’s the Law of Nature.

836
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:38,083
The bigger creatures
feed on the smaller ones.

837
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:40,365
Man is also a creature.

838
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:43,090
Man doesn’t feed on man.

839
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:44,929
Those times aren’t here yet.

840
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:52,100
That is why we’re feeding
on chicken or mutton.

841
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,654
If it makes you so uncomfortable,
don’t eat it.

842
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,642
No. No. I wouldn’t make that mistake.

843
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:04,478
Just thought I’d say a prayer
in that poor hen’s name.

844
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:06,040
Will you keep talking?

845
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:07,692
Or will you let us cook?

846
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:10,794
Curry is important. You carry on.

847
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:30,551
Subbaiah…

848
00:57:30,562 --> 00:57:31,132
Huh?

849
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,347
Me and my dad had a small bet.

850
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:36,124
You should tell us who will win.

851
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:39,019
Dad bet that you will
not drink from tomorrow.

852
00:57:39,428 --> 00:57:40,893
I bet that you will.

853
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,999
Who’s going to win that bet?

854
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:45,597
Me or my dad?

855
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:49,990
Are you father-son trying to mock me?

856
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:51,317
No, listen.

857
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:53,838
A guy in pain has a reason to drink.

858
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,455
Why would a happy guy do, tell me?

859
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:02,910
I say a drunkard needs no reason to drink.

860
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,699
Stop it, you two!

861
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,647
You can choose not to sell liquor to me.

862
00:58:08,936 --> 00:58:11,636
But you have no right to stop me.

863
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:15,978
Oh! Now I get the twist.

864
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:19,930
You want to confuse me…

865
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:22,662
So much so that I don’t
feel the kick anymore…

866
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:26,243
Eventually making me drink more.

867
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:29,091
It’s not going to work out.

868
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:34,072
I have to do something important tonight.

869
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:35,808
Really important.

870
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:41,184
In order to do that, I need to drink less.

871
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,305
I won’t drink.

872
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:48,579
Raju, get me another bottle.

873
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:00,978
Annapurnamma…

874
00:59:01,342 --> 00:59:02,835
O’ Annapurnamma…

875
00:59:03,754 --> 00:59:06,846
We have to harvest the crop
in Mr. Naidu’s field tomorrow.

876
00:59:06,945 --> 00:59:08,349
I’ll get you a good wage.

877
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:09,896
Will you and your daughter tag along?

878
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:12,188
Yeah, sure.

879
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:13,074
At what time?

880
00:59:13,776 --> 00:59:16,955
Venkayamma,
we won’t come to work from tomorrow.

881
00:59:17,158 --> 00:59:18,569
Oh, is it?

882
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:21,122
But I’ve promised to bring you both.

883
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:22,348
What do I do now?

884
00:59:22,418 --> 00:59:23,957
Find somebody else.

885
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:25,646
We’re not available.

886
00:59:25,957 --> 00:59:27,657
I get it. See you later.

887
00:59:29,872 --> 00:59:31,986
Amma, I won’t be here tomorrow.

888
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:34,333
Maybe you’re cancelling work assuming so.

889
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,866
You will not be here.

890
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,256
There will be no need to work either.

891
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:41,445
That is why we’re not going.

892
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:46,729
Err… We’ve got work in our own field.

893
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:48,729
That is why we refused to go.

894
00:59:49,094 --> 00:59:51,316
Oh. That’s alright then.

895
00:59:51,723 --> 00:59:53,450
I just don’t want to bother you.

896
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,858
Then you should definitely die.

897
00:59:57,122 --> 00:59:57,703
Amma...

898
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:01,145
How long until the chicken is ready?

899
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:03,326
Just a little longer.

900
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:04,516
It’s almost cooked.

901
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,176
I’m damn hungry.

902
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:10,817
Then you’re going to die hungry.

903
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:26,203
He’ll be here.

904
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:27,891
I don’t think so.

905
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:31,223
Your husband is not coming home tonight.

906
01:00:32,064 --> 01:00:33,711
He’s got money in his pockets now.

907
01:00:34,366 --> 01:00:38,089
He must’ve gotten drunk
and puked till he dropped.

908
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,145
What do you want to do now?

909
01:01:11,038 --> 01:01:12,047
Malli…!!!

910
01:01:13,287 --> 01:01:15,020
Oh, it was a dream!

911
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:18,219
What did I tell them?

912
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:21,714
Just cook and serve.

913
01:01:22,573 --> 01:01:26,655
They wouldn’t dare to go beyond.

914
01:01:29,775 --> 01:01:30,975
No chance!

915
01:01:33,282 --> 01:01:34,118
Raju!

916
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:55,139
Amma, looks like it will be
dawn before the chicken’s ready.

917
01:01:55,588 --> 01:02:00,111
If you boil it too much,
it might just come back to life.

918
01:02:00,122 --> 01:02:00,877
Be careful.

919
01:02:01,106 --> 01:02:02,576
I’m straining the rice.

920
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,437
Will serve the dish in some time.

921
01:02:04,663 --> 01:02:05,429
Sure, amma.

922
01:02:13,423 --> 01:02:18,028
You seem to be growing soft for him.

923
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:23,723
What do I do?

924
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:26,758
You said we’d just have to feed him.

925
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:28,358
And your dad will take care of the rest.

926
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,897
You mean my drunkard of a dad?

927
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,046
You seriously think he’ll show up?

928
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:36,806
He’s not coming home until
he spends every penny he has.

929
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,855
We can’t depend on him.

930
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,163
What do you want to do then?

931
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,608
If he’s really destined
to die in our hands…

932
01:02:43,919 --> 01:02:46,060
Nobody can stop it.

933
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:48,865
Whatever it is, we’d only have to do it.

934
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:51,270
No, Malli.

935
01:02:51,315 --> 01:02:52,630
Don’t say that, mom.

936
01:02:53,509 --> 01:02:56,409
We can’t solve our problems
without getting blood on our hands.

937
01:02:58,952 --> 01:03:00,255
I’m not saying you shouldn’t do it.

938
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,916
I’m saying, don’t get blood on your hands.

939
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:05,915
You mean?

940
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:10,946
Poisonous herb.

941
01:03:18,368 --> 01:03:22,032
"Want to hear a tale of atrocity?"

942
01:03:22,057 --> 01:03:25,828
"There's no near or dear
on the battlefield of desire"

943
01:03:29,415 --> 01:03:33,141
"How long can you keep the secret hidden?"

944
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:36,883
"You think you can get away with this?"

945
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:40,563
"Your desperation will get you nowhere"

946
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:44,219
"It's like building castles in the air"

947
01:03:44,244 --> 01:03:47,875
"As the dark abyss takes
over, your true colors shine"

948
01:03:54,884 --> 01:03:58,305
"In this moment of desolation"

949
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:01,969
"A cloud of oblivion spreads"

950
01:04:02,274 --> 01:04:05,703
"Like a call for havoc"

951
01:04:05,962 --> 01:04:09,407
"Evil is deaf to the truth"

952
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:13,078
"Cries of agony go unheard"

953
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:17,250
"It all leads to this moment of absolution"

954
01:04:22,718 --> 01:04:25,850
Why do you have dirt on your hands?

955
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:27,657
Err…

956
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:29,768
I was sketching earlier.

957
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,459
Must be the ink.

958
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:32,797
I’ll go wash and come.

959
01:04:38,282 --> 01:04:39,433
Are you out of your mind?

960
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,767
Have you lost it completely?

961
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:51,673
It’s pretty dark. Watch your step, sir.

962
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:54,398
I don’t need your advice. Let’s go.

963
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:57,472
Mom, cops are here.

964
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:10,822
Listen!

965
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:11,634
Amma…

966
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,773
Stay where you are.

967
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,802
Don’t come out till I tell you so.

968
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:16,605
What happened?

969
01:05:17,677 --> 01:05:19,334
We have guests over.

970
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:22,263
You can’t be seen here at this time.

971
01:05:23,047 --> 01:05:24,797
You know how corrupted people’s minds are.

972
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:26,310
Try to understand.

973
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,030
It’s okay. I get it.

974
01:05:28,439 --> 01:05:29,987
I’ll stay put till you call me.

975
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,280
Okay.

976
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:37,829
I don't think I'll get
to eat chicken today.

977
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:43,403
What brings you here, sir?

978
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,483
A thief snuck into
Mr. Naidupeta Shetty’s house.

979
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:47,363
We got information that
he’s hiding in this area.

980
01:05:47,726 --> 01:05:48,794
We’re looking for him.

981
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:50,595
Have you come across
any new face in this area?

982
01:05:56,797 --> 01:05:58,938
Annapurnamma, it smells delish.
Is it meat?

983
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:01,174
Sir...

984
01:06:02,352 --> 01:06:03,450
I made chicken curry.

985
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:04,415
That’s amazing.

986
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,678
Aren’t you going to let me taste some?

987
01:06:06,446 --> 01:06:07,391
Can I also…?

988
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:11,031
Why are you barking?

989
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:12,598
It doesn’t bite.

990
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,943
Who knows? It might.

991
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:16,585
They says a dog that barks doesn’t bite.

992
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,027
My sir does both, you know that?

993
01:06:20,086 --> 01:06:21,324
Let’s go. Come on.

994
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:22,312
Let’s eat some chicken.

995
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:26,031
"Trust has been broken"

996
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:29,991
"Manipulation has dominated"

997
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,819
"Fake smiles mask
the evil intentions within"

998
01:06:33,844 --> 01:06:35,932
Oh! It’s already served. Perfect!

999
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:38,116
Oh, no. Don’t eat that.

1000
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,309
I’ll get you a new plate.

1001
01:06:40,352 --> 01:06:42,646
Why? I’m not an outsider. I don’t mind.

1002
01:06:42,907 --> 01:06:44,157
Wow! Chicken is piping hot.

1003
01:06:44,157 --> 01:06:45,074
Let me eat in this.

1004
01:06:45,074 --> 01:06:46,473
Get him a different plate.

1005
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:51,397
This is defiled. It’s not good manners
to feed defiled food to the guest.

1006
01:06:52,044 --> 01:06:53,380
I’ll go get a new plate.

1007
01:06:53,828 --> 01:06:55,499
Malli, get two plates.

1008
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,865
Get some curry as well.

1009
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,910
Annapurnamma, why are you rushing?

1010
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,758
Hand slipped, sir.

1011
01:07:11,076 --> 01:07:12,472
Malli, clean this up.

1012
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:14,105
I’ll get the curry.

1013
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:32,484
"Times have lured the barbarity in them"

1014
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:36,273
"No good deed can wash
away this sin of desire"

1015
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:43,750
"Times have lured the barbarity in them"

1016
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:47,718
"No good deed can wash
away this sin of desire"

1017
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:54,070
"A tale unknown of spins its way"

1018
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:57,593
"Destiny surrenders in despair"

1019
01:07:57,735 --> 01:08:01,492
"It's a crime uncalled for"

1020
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,015
Annapurnamma,
I’m not sure if it’s the hen or the spices.

1021
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,597
But you’re a wonderful cook.

1022
01:08:13,894 --> 01:08:15,382
Hey! Ramu, no!

1023
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:21,292
Go away!

1024
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,639
Let it eat. It’s on the floor anyway.

1025
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:55,501
It was delicious.

1026
01:08:55,722 --> 01:08:57,036
You fed us as soon as we asked.

1027
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:58,709
God bless you!

1028
01:09:00,457 --> 01:09:03,734
Sir, I’m feeling drowsy already.

1029
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:05,947
Shall we take a small nap and go?

1030
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:06,986
Shut up and come.

1031
01:09:08,655 --> 01:09:09,276
What is this?

1032
01:09:09,415 --> 01:09:11,003
It was barking till now.

1033
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,433
Now it’s already asleep.

1034
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,488
That’s how it is.

1035
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:15,234
Sleeps immediately after eating.

1036
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,753
Bloody dog!

1037
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:17,778
Heard that?

1038
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,356
If we sleep here,
that’s what she’ll call us.

1039
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:19,793
Let’s go.

1040
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:22,902
"Trust has been broken"

1041
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:26,792
"Manipulation has dominated"

1042
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:30,917
"Fake smiles mask
the evil intentions within"

1043
01:09:30,941 --> 01:09:34,167
"Story ends before the plot takes off"

1044
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:38,050
"Times have lured the barbarity in them"

1045
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:41,753
"No good deed can wash
away this sin of desire"

1046
01:09:41,793 --> 01:09:45,457
"Times have lured the barbarity in them"

1047
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:49,308
"No good deed can wash
away this sin of desire"

1048
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:00,486
Malli, what happened?

1049
01:10:01,871 --> 01:10:02,629
It puked.

1050
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:04,045
You go and eat.

1051
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:05,732
Mom’s calling you.

1052
01:10:14,528 --> 01:10:18,257
"Want to hear a tale of atrocity?"

1053
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:22,035
"There's no near or dear
on the battlefield of desire"

1054
01:10:25,676 --> 01:10:29,215
"How long can you keep the secret hidden?"

1055
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:33,067
"You think you can get away with this?"

1056
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:36,762
"Your desperation will get you nowhere"

1057
01:10:36,787 --> 01:10:40,418
"It's like building castles in the air"

1058
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:44,160
"As the dark abyss takes
over, your true colors shine"

1059
01:10:51,106 --> 01:10:54,488
"In this moment of desolation"

1060
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:58,207
"A cloud of oblivion spreads"

1061
01:10:58,489 --> 01:11:01,988
"Like a call for havoc"

1062
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,684
"Evil is deaf to the truth"

1063
01:11:05,856 --> 01:11:09,301
"Cries of agony go unheard"

1064
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:13,215
"It all leads to this moment of absolution"

1065
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:17,672
It’s delicious, amma.

1066
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:46,980
Amma…

1067
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:51,752
What is this?

1068
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:54,611
I wanted to get your
blessings in the afternoon itself.

1069
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:45,059
So you didn’t add the poison.

1070
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,913
You don’t care about your daughter’s life.

1071
01:12:49,581 --> 01:12:52,923
You just want to keep some stranger alive.

1072
01:12:54,779 --> 01:13:00,484
So you don’t really care even if I have
to sleep with someone to repay the debt.

1073
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,244
Malli...

1074
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:05,326
Why do you say stuff
like that and make me cry?

1075
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,023
When I saw the dog die, I got scared.

1076
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,197
I couldn’t get myself to kill this man.

1077
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:17,903
Of course. Why would
you do anything for me?

1078
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:21,678
I should drink the poison for
being born as your daughter.

1079
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:22,607
Hey!

1080
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:24,467
Don’t worry.

1081
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:26,752
I won’t kill myself.

1082
01:13:27,626 --> 01:13:31,278
No matter what, I will do what I want to.

1083
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:47,542
Hey, Raju! Get me another bottle.

1084
01:13:53,283 --> 01:13:54,432
Enough, Subbaiah!

1085
01:13:54,589 --> 01:13:55,960
You’ve had way too many already.

1086
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:58,970
‘Cause you won’t be coming from tomorrow…

1087
01:13:59,196 --> 01:14:02,850
My owner and his son are
provoking you deliberately.

1088
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:07,803
But by the looks of it,
I’m afraid you’ll drink your way to death.

1089
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,639
Shut up, you fool!

1090
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:12,761
I drank yesterday.

1091
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,314
I’m drinking today.

1092
01:14:16,228 --> 01:14:18,194
And I’ll drink tomorrow.

1093
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:21,587
If you want, I’ll pour you a glass.

1094
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:23,766
I’ve got money now.

1095
01:14:23,766 --> 01:14:24,821
It’s not about the money.

1096
01:14:25,759 --> 01:14:28,464
If you hear this,
you’ll forget all about alcohol.

1097
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:31,670
In fact, you’ll run home right away.

1098
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,625
Tell me.

1099
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,086
Go ahead. Come on!

1100
01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:40,684
A guy visited your house today, right?

1101
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:43,877
What?

1102
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:47,188
You know, that guy who
came in the afternoon.

1103
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:48,697
Do you know who he is?

1104
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,977
How do you know that
somebody dropped by our house?

1105
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:11,438
Wondering who I am?

1106
01:15:13,203 --> 01:15:14,993
Subbaiah’s son Chinni Krishna.

1107
01:15:16,507 --> 01:15:17,615
You’re Subbaiah’s son?!

1108
01:15:18,676 --> 01:15:20,390
The kid who ran away years ago.

1109
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:21,671
You’re that kid?

1110
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:22,419
Yes.

1111
01:15:22,756 --> 01:15:26,137
Your mom weeps every day for you.

1112
01:15:27,726 --> 01:15:31,090
And your dad, he drinks here every night.

1113
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,775
Your sister isn’t married yet.

1114
01:15:34,756 --> 01:15:35,349
Alright.

1115
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,219
You’re home now.

1116
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:38,620
Things will fall into place.

1117
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,674
They should.

1118
01:15:40,213 --> 01:15:41,909
That is why I’m here.

1119
01:15:43,274 --> 01:15:45,326
I ran away due to some fight.

1120
01:15:46,112 --> 01:15:49,785
My parents should think
that it was for our own good.

1121
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:51,831
Mr. Kasi...

1122
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:55,981
Don’t tell them about me until I do so.

1123
01:15:58,477 --> 01:15:59,190
Why?

1124
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:00,417
Please don’t.

1125
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:04,312
So you’ve decided to do it your way.

1126
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:09,121
Goes with your name, Krishna. You’re sly.

1127
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:10,613
Go ahead.

1128
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:12,626
See you around.

1129
01:16:14,773 --> 01:16:20,021
"It's all an illusion!"

1130
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:28,999
"An illusion that makes you kill your own"

1131
01:16:31,531 --> 01:16:36,351
"An illusion that leaves you dazed"

1132
01:16:39,046 --> 01:16:49,390
"It's too late before you realize it"

1133
01:16:51,677 --> 01:16:55,848
"It's all an illusion!"

1134
01:16:57,543 --> 01:17:01,927
"An illusion that turns human into evil"

1135
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:08,923
Hey!

1136
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,018
This knife is used to
cut the umbilical cord.

1137
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,382
It was also used to cut that hen tonight.

1138
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:23,434
Let go and he’ll die.

1139
01:17:24,165 --> 01:17:25,926
Otherwise, I’ll die.

1140
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:36,898
"It's all an illusion!"

1141
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:41,281
"An illusion that turns human into evil"

1142
01:17:41,977 --> 01:17:49,609
"Unaware of her relation with the guest"

1143
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:57,734
"She falls prey to the
blinding desire of money"

1144
01:17:57,977 --> 01:18:05,590
"In this game where you eat
one of your own to survive"

1145
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:09,598
"A mother's existence is questioned"

1146
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:13,489
"It's all an illusion!"

1147
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,929
"An illusion held close to heart"

1148
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:42,549
Sounded like Poorna sister.

1149
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:50,782
Poorna sister…

1150
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,211
Hey, Poorna sister…

1151
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:03,975
Why isn't anybody responding?

1152
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,856
Your name?

1153
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:26,617
Srinu. Srinivas.

1154
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,848
Why are his boots here?

1155
01:19:30,116 --> 01:19:32,389
Subbaiah must be at the toddy shop.

1156
01:19:33,054 --> 01:19:33,897
I should meet him.

1157
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:39,030
Hey…

1158
01:20:40,832 --> 01:20:41,498
Listen!

1159
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:43,639
Where is he?

1160
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:52,075
Chinni!

1161
01:21:53,447 --> 01:21:54,849
Chinni!

1162
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:01,181
Chinni!

1163
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:07,124
Chinni!

1164
01:22:09,756 --> 01:22:10,939
Chinni!

1165
01:22:28,795 --> 01:22:30,628
It’s our Chinni.

1166
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,382
It’s our Chinni.

1167
01:22:50,982 --> 01:22:52,305
Chinni!

1168
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,849
"It's all an illusion!"

1169
01:23:10,974 --> 01:23:14,177
"It's all an illusion!"

1170
01:23:30,787 --> 01:23:31,900
Money is not permanent.

1171
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:33,692
I have it today.

1172
01:23:33,897 --> 01:23:34,764
Tomorrow, it will be yours.

1173
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:51,873
Our Chinni!

1174
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:55,254
Chinni!

1175
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:01,887
Chinni!

1176
01:24:33,113 --> 01:24:34,379
It’s gone! It’s gone!

1177
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:37,980
Mom, Chinni cut my hair.

1178
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:42,866
Oh, no! How could you cut her hair?

1179
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,165
What’s wrong with you?

1180
01:24:45,249 --> 01:24:46,034
Idiot!

1181
01:24:46,626 --> 01:24:48,571
Why are you laughing when I’m hitting you?

1182
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,498
You idiot! You’re still laughing?

1183
01:24:52,456 --> 01:24:57,143
You’re so dead! I’m going to beat you up.

1184
01:24:57,143 --> 01:24:57,780
Stay here.

1185
01:25:02,433 --> 01:25:03,266
Where is he?

1186
01:25:08,168 --> 01:25:09,308
Hey, Chinni! Stop!

1187
01:25:09,873 --> 01:25:11,583
You think I’ll spare you?

1188
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:14,140
Hey, stop! Chinni!

1189
01:25:14,247 --> 01:25:15,022
Stop right there!

1190
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:19,651
Go away! Don’t come back!

1191
01:25:20,076 --> 01:25:22,777
I’ll kill you if you do.

1192
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,583
Don’t touch him!

1193
01:25:42,558 --> 01:25:43,485
Don’t touch him.

1194
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,455
None of us have the right to touch him.

1195
01:25:50,535 --> 01:25:51,502
No.

1196
01:25:52,475 --> 01:25:56,171
It’s my fault, mom.

1197
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:59,428
No. It’s my fault!

1198
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,873
It’s my fricking fault! My fault!

1199
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,506
Giving birth to him was my fault.

1200
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:14,616
My fault!

1201
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:26,656
Chinni!

1202
01:26:27,518 --> 01:26:32,240
"It's all an illusion!"

1203
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:37,143
"It's a never-ending
stream of hopelessness"

1204
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:42,557
"It's all an illusion!"

1205
01:26:44,463 --> 01:26:48,564
"An illusion that turns human into evil"

1206
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:33,328
"Wash away your sins with fire"

1207
01:28:33,786 --> 01:28:37,711
"No level of karma can nullify this"

1208
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:45,711
"What are you going to
take with you when you die?"

1209
01:28:45,736 --> 01:28:53,256
"You have been enslaved by a tale of greed"

1210
01:28:53,843 --> 01:29:01,709
"The path of moral was yours
to choose in this pool of trickery"

1211
01:29:09,786 --> 01:29:13,129
"It's all an illusion!"

1212
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:17,410
"An illusion that drowns you in grief"

1213
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:21,067
"It's all an illusion!"

1214
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:25,692
"An illusion bound by human nature"

1215
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:32,550
‘Today is an unforgettable day in my life.’

1216
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:36,405
‘It’s the day I met my family for
the first time after 15 long years,’

1217
01:29:36,561 --> 01:29:38,719
‘The minute I saw mom, dad and Malli…’

1218
01:29:38,859 --> 01:29:40,818
‘I wanted to hug them tightly…’

1219
01:29:40,971 --> 01:29:43,565
‘and tell them that I was their Chinni.’

1220
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:50,145
‘But my cute little wish to spend a day
with them like a stranger, stopped me.’

1221
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,409
‘When Veeranna was yelling at dad,
I got more furious than mom.’

1222
01:29:55,601 --> 01:30:00,000
‘I wanted to throw money at his face
and take our house and land back.’

1223
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:03,030
‘But my silly wish stopped me.’

1224
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:06,022
‘Later, I realized that,
that was my mistake.’

1225
01:30:06,459 --> 01:30:09,571
‘Like many girls out there,
with burning desires…’

1226
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,756
‘when my sister felt attracted to me…’

1227
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:13,924
‘I wanted to tell her the truth.’

1228
01:30:14,304 --> 01:30:17,310
‘But enough damage was done already.’

1229
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:18,969
‘If the tell the truth now…’

1230
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:21,480
‘More than feeling happy about
her brother returning home…’

1231
01:30:21,735 --> 01:30:24,408
‘Her mistake will haunt her forever.’

1232
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:26,760
‘I don’t want to hurt her.’

1233
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:28,472
‘I came here as a stranger.’

1234
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:31,803
‘And I will remain a stranger to them.’

1235
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:37,252
‘So, I’ve decided to leave the
money and gold with them…’

1236
01:30:37,381 --> 01:30:43,062
‘And set out on my
journey again at sunrise.’

1237
01:30:43,343 --> 01:30:49,245
‘God, please make sure that my
sister doesn’t see me that way again.’

1238
01:30:49,484 --> 01:30:54,141
‘Also that my family is happy and
prosperous, even in my absence.’

1239
01:31:48,548 --> 01:31:54,011
"It's all an illusion!"
