1
00:00:01,118 --> 00:00:06,078
"It is the slogans necessary
for our nation...

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,152
that I reiterate before you.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,624
I hope you will raise the
slogan after me."

4
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:15,324
Long live the soldiers!

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:18,594
Long live the farmers!

6
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,694
So sacred and pure
is this land...

7
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:59,334
on which culture first
made its mark.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,713
And whose light spread
far and wide.

9
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,245
This is a story
of this very land...

10
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,487
of this very nation
...of India.

11
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:27,233
Malang uncle!
Malang uncle!

12
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:51,552
Wake up! It's daytime
already!

13
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,032
Another day, eh?

14
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:14,240
Look at that, Bharat!

15
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:21,214
Dhaniram, the hypocrite, is
praying to the rising Sun.

16
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,424
No one cares for
the Sun that is setting.

17
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,754
Why not?
- You'll know that...

18
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,692
when you grow up.

19
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,193
What if I don't?

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,901
I'll shave off my beard and
call you my elder instead!

21
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,569
But I want you to wake me up
all the time.

22
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,809
What if I don't?
- I'll continue sleeping.

23
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,635
Should I still not
awaken you?

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,238
I'll never awaken,
in that case.

25
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:52,144
Take this lamp, for example.
It is lit, when I light it.

26
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:55,013
Similarly, I wake up,
when you awaken me.

27
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,383
You're philosophizing again,
aren't you?

28
00:02:57,894 --> 00:03:00,294
You'll find people lecturing
you over food...

29
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,326
but there's no lecture
over lecture itself!

30
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,658
Which is why I speak my mind!
Okay?

31
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,727
Go on now... you're getting
late for school.

32
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,539
My God!

33
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,709
You're a butcher...
not a barber!

34
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,573
My hands waver when I'm
dealing with a customer...

35
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,148
who's using my services
on credit.

36
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,910
Well, all right.
Get on with you work.

37
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:29,455
I gave your sons a
haircut, Mr. Sundarlal.

38
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,590
I haven't been paid for it.
- How much is the money?

39
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,596
It's only 3 annas!
- Only 3 annas?!

40
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,059
D'you realize the worth...

41
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,495
of this blood that
you've made me lose?

42
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,032
It took 2 big boxes of
clarified butter...

43
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,036
to create so much of blood.
How much would that cost?

44
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,344
You're going to be
the loser...

45
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:52,045
if you insist on talking business.
Get on with your work!

46
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,477
Hold it! Wait...

47
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,084
Hello, dear!

48
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,447
Mind your business, Sunder!

49
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:05,328
But, of course! You roast
the grains...

50
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,325
and I sell them!

51
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:11,701
You've got going so early
in the day, haven't you?

52
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:13,933
Welcome, O Father
of the Village!

53
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,966
I thought I'd have some
buttermilk in your house.

54
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,503
Buttermilk?!
- Why? Is something wrong?

55
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:23,370
We've never had yogurt in the
house, since my wife died.

56
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,111
How'd we have
buttermilk, then?

57
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,383
Never mind... I can have it
in the marketplace instead.

58
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,948
Give me the money, then.

59
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:34,386
You've nicked me again!
Here you are...

60
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:40,261
Take it, Labbu. It's for the
shave you've given him.

61
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,155
I'll have the buttermilk
with Ramu in the fields.

62
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:47,225
Say, Ramu! Why are you quiet?
What're you thinking of?

63
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,902
It's you I'm thinking of.
- Me?!

64
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:56,238
Why don't you get
married again, Krishna?

65
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,878
Marry again?
- Of course!

66
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,377
For your daughter's sake.
You may not need a wife.

67
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,552
But your little girl
will need a mother.

68
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,488
You're right, Ramu.

69
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:14,194
But what happens my daughter
doesn't have a mother...

70
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,624
even after I marry again?

71
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,200
Don't talk about yourself.

72
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,933
There's hardly anyone
in the world...

73
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,705
who's been happy after
a second marriage!

74
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,372
Not every woman is like
your wife, Radha...

75
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:31,280
who'd shower more affection
on her stepson, Bharat...

76
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:35,006
than she gives her
own son, Puran.

77
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,216
I was told, too, that the
Stepmother...

78
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,614
would make life
miserable for Bharat.

79
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,286
But the affection Radha
has for Bharat...

80
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:46,460
has silenced everyone!

81
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:52,099
Radha! You've been hearing
your praise in silence, eh?

82
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,505
Let's eat, Bhishen!

83
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,171
Go ahead. I'll free
the animals.

84
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,047
Greetings, Lalaji!

85
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,117
Greetings, yourself.

86
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,650
How are you, Radha?

87
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,386
Please have lunch
with us, Lalaji.

88
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,523
It's you people who are
my diet, my friend...

89
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,563
I mean, it's your
yield.

90
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,265
Get on with the harvest
as soon as possible...

91
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,437
so I give you some money,
and keep a penny for myself.

92
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,034
Right, Lakhpati?
- Right ho!

93
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,274
It's only when my boss
gets his penny...

94
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,308
will he give a coin
to this manager!

95
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:47,349
Why worry, Lalaji? I could
let you have two pennies!

96
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:52,394
A lakhpati (millionaire) by
name and a pauper at heart!

97
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:55,822
I'll buy you a cot instead!

98
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,132
But you'd rather be
working at a place...

99
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:01,461
where they're honest.
Understand?

100
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,700
You shouldn't be hopping
around at everyplace.

101
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,975
You have just one leg.
Take care you keep it!

102
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,611
There are lectures on
rations...

103
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,915
but no rations on lectures!

104
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,249
Which is why I always
speak my mind!

105
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:22,989
Besides, I straighten out
guys with my kicks!

106
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's go, Ramu.
I'll eat with you instead.

107
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,564
Dhaniram lives only
on money.

108
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:35,061
How was that? Didn't
I let him have it?

109
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:40,406
Believe me, sister...
I'm not lying.

110
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,167
I'll now mend my ways and will
never be a bad man again.

111
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,503
I swear by you.

112
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,744
This is the last time
I've been to prison.

113
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,910
Forgive me this once.
I assure you...

114
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,121
you will be ashamed to
call me your brother again.

115
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,257
You've been saying that
all the while.

116
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,082
I swear by God
this time!

117
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,488
You've always sworn.

118
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,862
But why are you assuring me
this time?

119
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:08,201
Whom can I call my own,
but you, Radha?

120
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:11,507
You're the only one I have...
my flesh and blood.

121
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,068
Come to the point.
What do you want?

122
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:19,341
I swear! I want nothing!
All I wanted to know...

123
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,741
is when is the festival
of "Raakhi"?

124
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,517
Can I come to have the sacred
thread tied on my wrist?

125
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:28,321
Raakhi is still six
months away.

126
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:33,596
Sit down while I go and
get some buttermilk for you.

127
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,863
You're a gem of a person,
Radha.

128
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,788
Keep my jewelry back there!
Or else...

129
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:24,770
Get out!

130
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:31,847
Shameless man! Don't step
in this house ever again!

131
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,189
We have nothing to do
with you anymore!

132
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,959
Thank God, Bharat saw you
stealing the ornaments...

133
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,659
and hurried to tell me.
Or else...

134
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,196
Get out, I say
Get out!

135
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,196
Mother!

136
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,302
Well, you brat!

137
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,937
Couldn't you shut up for
some more time?!

138
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,243
Why should I?
- Why should you?!

139
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,418
You bastard! I'll beat you
black and blue today!

140
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,581
Why did you squeal
to your Mom?

141
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:06,685
Why did you steal?

142
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,116
You call me a thief?!

143
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,256
Father!
- Call your old man!

144
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,094
I'll deal with both of you!

145
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,624
Mother!

146
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,729
You scoundrel! You dare raise
your hands on my son?!

147
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,706
Father!

148
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,715
My son! Step aside!

149
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,032
Father!

150
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,564
Father!

151
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,806
Father!

152
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,794
Don't worry, Radha.

153
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,464
Your fields will always be
ploughed, so long as I live.

154
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:46,673
I will plough them for you.

155
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,739
I can't help you plough
the fields, Kishan.

156
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,683
But I can fetch food for you
in the fields...

157
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:59,044
serve you well, and even
guard the yields.

158
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,326
Man can achieve everything...

159
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,859
but you're never through
with what you're saying.

160
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,663
I speak the truth, Kishan.

161
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:16,829
These kids will repay you,
once they are grown up.

162
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:21,307
Go ahead, kids...
It's time for your school.

163
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:26,309
Take Puran along, Bharat.

164
00:15:52,101 --> 00:17:06,397
Bharat! Bharat!
Where are you?

165
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,443
What is it, Som and Mangal?

166
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,710
There's a letter from your
brother in the city!

167
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,957
What does it say?

168
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,327
My brother has passed his
tests this month.

169
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,372
Well, guys... do you know
what it means to "pass"?

170
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,143
No.

171
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,714
Why don't you move further
from Class 6?

172
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:54,850
You don't want us to spoil our
father's reputation, do you?

173
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:57,189
How is that?
- Listen.

174
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,924
Suppose we study more than
our father has...

175
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,388
won't we subjecting him
to a lot of ridicule?

176
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,700
But he'd be happy if you
studied hard and succeed!

177
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:08,332
You are educated. But you
still slog in the fields.

178
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,799
We've got to handle our
father's business, right?

179
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,537
Till our aunt is at
the oven...

180
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,568
our old man won't allow
us in the shop!

181
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,374
The Major?

182
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,531
Greetings, Major.
- How are you, Bharat?

183
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm fine. How are you?

184
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,934
I thought I'd meet you
before I left for the city.

185
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:46,569
Bharat! Lunch has arrived!
Do come over!

186
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:47,831
I'm coming over!

187
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:49,937
Let's have lunch
together, Major.

188
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:51,937
Sure. Let's go.
- Call the other men, too.

189
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,908
Come over, soldiers.
Let's have some food.

190
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:58,012
It was a coincidence that I met
you here, 5 months ago.

191
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:01,389
And we've had food together,
whenever I've met you.

192
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,792
But although I've invited
you to dinner so often...

193
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,421
you just don't find the
time from your farms!

194
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,356
I'll surely come over, once
Puran returns from the city.

195
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:12,327
It's only 15 minutes away.

196
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:13,996
The farmers must see how
the soldiers...

197
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,431
are making out
on the borders.

198
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,362
I see them, whenever
I'm passing by.

199
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,675
God willing, I'll surely
come over some day.

200
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:27,175
Greetings, Major!
- Greetings! How are you?

201
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,882
God is kind, I must say!

202
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,878
What will you have first?
The bread or the buttermilk?

203
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:35,451
I'll have them both
together.

204
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:36,883
Let me wash my hands.

205
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,284
There's a letter
from Puran, Mom.

206
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,288
He's said to have done very
well in his exams.

207
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,665
He has asked me to
send him 200 Rupees.

208
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:52,334
I'll fetch some money from the
post office, while you eat.

209
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,335
Please give it to Puran.

210
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,338
Wait, Bharat.

211
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,580
I'll give Puran the money
from my pocket.

212
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,210
You can repay me
when I return.

213
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,141
Don't you have faith in me...

214
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,677
that I'd really give
the money to Puran?

215
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:12,291
Faith? Faith binds human
beings together, Major.

216
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,124
Why me alone?

217
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:17,661
The nation pins its
hopes on you, Major.

218
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,264
All I was saying was that...
- Look at that, Bharat.

219
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,199
The plough and the gun.

220
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,437
You have faith in
our guns.

221
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:32,544
And we have faith
in the farmers.

222
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:37,410
Together, they're the faith
of the whole nation.

223
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,916
What's up, Puran?
You look glum.

224
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,286
Hasn't your brother sent
the money to you?

225
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,821
No! The money arrives
even before I need it!

226
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,058
The Major has given me
the money today itself.

227
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,229
Let's go, then!
- Where to?

228
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,998
From one place to another.

229
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:59,003
No, thank you. I'd rather
not waste any time.

230
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,506
With the exams ahead, we must
concentrate on our studies.

231
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:07,814
Studies, my foot!
You're a bookworm!

232
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,516
But your dreams aren't going
to be fulfilled by studies.

233
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,750
Studies alone can't buy you
cars and bungalows.

234
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,918
You must see the world
outside the hostel.

235
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:22,123
And change your name, too.

236
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:28,703
I'm sorry, but Puran is
terribly out-dated.

237
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,635
You must call yourself
Puran Kumar...

238
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,802
and have all the fun
with the new name.

239
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:53,856
This is my friend, Mr. Kumar.

240
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,432
And she is Kavita, who has
completed her studies...

241
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:00,735
in medicine only recently.

242
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,503
But she wants to stay
in the rural areas...

243
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,499
and gain experience
in medicine.

244
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,371
Haven't your brother and
his wife come today?

245
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,137
They're sitting there.

246
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,530
This is Mr. Kumar.
And this my uncle, Robin.

247
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:32,392
This is my brother
...and that's his wife.

248
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,902
Please come and sit down.

249
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,106
Welcome.

250
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:27,281
By day, you say we are all
tied to one another as humans.

251
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,824
And by nightfall...

252
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:33,922
you say these relationships
are all fake...

253
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,254
that they mean nothing.

254
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:38,358
Why do you say that?

255
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:44,963
I say only which I must.

256
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:49,500
But by nightfall, I speak
the truth.

257
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,740
I advise you, too...

258
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:56,174
do favors to everyone
as you must.

259
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:59,350
But think of yourself first.
Do you understand?

260
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,118
What does that mean?

261
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:08,854
Mean? I mean, you must be
careful of the ways of...

262
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:12,095
the world and the people
who inhabit it.

263
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,996
Well, never mind.
It's very late.

264
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:18,873
Go home. You've got to leave
for fields early tomorrow.

265
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,242
Here you are...

266
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,674
This is the money I owed you.

267
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:47,847
Can I have a sweetmeat?
- Sweet? Here you are...

268
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,427
Say, darling...
- What is it?

269
00:31:55,897 --> 00:32:00,163
You've roasted so many grains
from my shop in your oven.

270
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,899
Heed my heart, too, darling!

271
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:05,500
Shame on you!

272
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,366
So when do we have
the wedding?

273
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:11,906
There's no one to stop
either of us!

274
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,576
If not your own old age,
think of mine!

275
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,847
She's right!

276
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:24,419
You?! What cursed hour was it
when you were born to me?!

277
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,556
It was the time when our
mother passed away, dad!

278
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,496
Talk to your father, boys.
Or else...

279
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,563
Or else?! What?

280
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:40,806
Will you stop roasting
my grains in your oven?

281
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:45,205
No! You'll stop getting
your supplies.

282
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,072
The old man has no vices.

283
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,475
But grains will undoubtedly
be stopped!

284
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:52,513
Shut up! You dare talk to
your father in that manner?!

285
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:56,814
Get lost!
Go on, both of you!

286
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:57,887
You, too!

287
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:03,257
When you get married,
do adopt these boys.

288
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:04,687
I'm fed up of them.

289
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,762
Had it not been for them...

290
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:10,604
how'd you have changed
the topic?

291
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,869
Stop teasing the old lady.
- But...

292
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:17,371
Do you understand?
- Sure! I do!

293
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:19,905
The doctor!
She has just arrived...

294
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:23,308
and she's already pestering
us to keep things covered!

295
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,179
Greetings, doctor!
- Greetings.

296
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:31,819
Just a moment, please!
Do listen to me!

297
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,285
Don't you know him?

298
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,960
No.

299
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,896
Then you'd better know him.

300
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,768
Or you can't get by
in the village.

301
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,728
This is Malang.
The free-bird.

302
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,500
Bless you, dear.

303
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:48,805
And this is Bharat.

304
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,075
They're the conscience-keepers
of the village.

305
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:53,470
Bharat has been
to High School.

306
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,045
He's the most educated farmer
in the district.

307
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:58,543
May I leave now?

308
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:02,252
Excuse me...
you're a guest in our village.

309
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,683
Should you need something,
do let us know.

310
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,842
You've lost weight. Don't
you eat well in the city?

311
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,274
You say that each time
I return from the city.

312
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,119
I'm fine, of course.

313
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:44,092
What are you doing here?
- I belong to this village.

314
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,633
But what are you doing here?

315
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:48,731
Didn't I say I've got to gain
experience in medicine...

316
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,196
in the villages?

317
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:54,103
You're here for experience
in medicine, then, are you?

318
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,340
That's my brother, Bharat.

319
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:58,704
I've already met him.

320
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:04,243
How do you manage here?

321
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,710
There's no club,
nor a restaurant?

322
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:08,755
Don't you get bored
with the monotony?

323
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:10,224
Not at all.

324
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,319
The clubs and restaurants
have their own place...

325
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,027
and life in the villages
has its own charm.

326
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,828
It's very peaceful here.

327
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,996
And the folks around here
are good, too.

328
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,673
I must leave now.
- Sure. See you soon.

329
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:32,937
It's only good people who
call others good, too.

330
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,806
These folks are as good
as they are rich, Bharat.

331
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,811
For all his riches, her
brother still does a job.

332
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,813
He's a top Central
Investigation officer.

333
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:48,660
Why did the doctor call you
Kumar and not Puran?

334
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:54,662
Puran is considered to be
an old and outdated name.

335
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,731
Kumar is the most
happening one.

336
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:58,800
So I thought I'd call
myself Kumar, too.

337
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,705
Father!

338
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,835
Are they doing a
favor to me?

339
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,108
Look where you're going!
You're gonna be fixed, too!

340
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,344
Know what?

341
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,114
I came here for some medicine
for my younger one and the...

342
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:45,281
lady-doctor says I mustn't
have anymore kids!

343
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,713
What else do I do?
- She said the same to me.

344
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,714
Really?
- Me, too.

345
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:54,355
Good God! She has said that
to all the women in town!

346
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:58,328
But why is she misleading us?

347
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,299
It's for your own welfare.
- Our welfare?!

348
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,795
Had you my welfare
at heart...

349
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,104
you'd have asked me to
bear a dozen kids!

350
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,873
A dozen kids?!
- Of course!

351
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:11,543
My grandma had 12 sons
and 4 daughters.

352
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:14,571
She was even given a reward
by the Government, for that.

353
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,539
But times have changed.

354
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:19,715
No one in the village
has 12 sons anymore.

355
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:23,421
How many children you have?
- I?!

356
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,022
A son and a daughter, a son
and a daughter...

357
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:28,328
I have 8 and was trying
to meet the challenge...

358
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,860
and you've started
lecturing me!

359
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:33,391
What does your husband do?

360
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:37,865
He's a clerk for Dhaniram.

361
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,998
How much does he earn?
- 140 Rupees.

362
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,072
But he's a millionaire
by name.

363
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,938
How do you manage?
- Easily!

364
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:49,750
We eat well and make merry!

365
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:53,451
I mean, how will you manage
once your children grow up?

366
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,080
What do you mean?
- I mean...

367
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:58,823
what about their marriages?
And their education?

368
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:02,663
We have a free-school for
kids in the village.

369
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:05,622
I could've gone, too.
But I felt shy.

370
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:10,500
If you only had 2 children,
instead of 8...

371
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:15,272
you could possibly have sent
one of them to college.

372
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,076
Come here.
- What is it?

373
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,311
See how happy they are,
with just two children.

374
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,241
Yes! They're all smiling!

375
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,712
Those who have many
children...

376
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,354
are in trouble themselves,
and so are the children.

377
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,355
They're all crying!
It's a bloody battlefield!

378
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,990
God! Isn't that what
happens in my house, too?

379
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,897
You're right. And listen...

380
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,137
They've all fled!
But never mind.

381
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:53,508
I understand a bit of what
you're saying, doctor.

382
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,510
The day I learn more, I'll
drag them all to you.

383
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,919
But I must leave now.
Good-bye.

384
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,113
They're scared of you.
But I'll drag them over.

385
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,790
Greetings, lady.
- How are you, Bharat?

386
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:08,392
Greetings!
- Puran?!

387
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,731
What funny clothes have
you got from the city?

388
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:13,557
Don't you have a loincloth
and a "kurta"?

389
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:18,671
We were listening
to you speak.

390
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,405
You have a nice way of
making them see reason.

391
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,003
You have commendable ideals.

392
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,339
The villagers praise
the doctor, and...

393
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:26,636
The doctor praises
the villagers!

394
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,815
That's good! Let's praise
each other.

395
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:32,978
There's no better way to
compromise with one's life.

396
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,113
But we must leave now.
Let's go, Puran.

397
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:40,087
Puran? So your name
is Puran, is it?

398
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:43,826
Actually, I'm known as Puran
in the village.

399
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,127
That's a better name.
- See that, Puran?

400
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:48,969
Only good people can
appreciate good things.

401
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,941
Bharat!
- Greetings, Lala!

402
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,474
Greetings, yourself.

403
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,814
Talk to them!
They've gone crazy!

404
00:40:38,086 --> 00:40:39,018
What's wrong?

405
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,686
They refuse to sell
their harvest this year!

406
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:47,125
Nobody sells a harvest.
We sell the grains we grow.

407
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,396
And I sell grains, too.

408
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:53,799
Businessmen like you buy our
hard-earned grains cheap...

409
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,103
and hoard them
in your stores.

410
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:59,663
That leads to a scarcity of
foodgrains in the city.

411
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:03,740
You take advantage of
the situation...

412
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,138
and sell the grains at
four times the cost.

413
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:10,107
You use our sweat to
fleece the others, Lala!

414
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,817
I pay you, don't I?
You don't starve!

415
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:16,985
Then why must you worry
about others?

416
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,357
Talk to them!

417
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,389
They insist that they'll
do just what you say!

418
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,387
They're right, too.

419
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,227
This season, we will sell
our yield...

420
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:29,594
directly in the marketplace.

421
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:32,197
It's okay even if our
payments are delayed.

422
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:35,371
People will have to spend
less to buy the grains.

423
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,311
You may leave! We will not
sell our yield to you!

424
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,306
I see! So you're going to
hoard your yield...

425
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,139
like the other farmers, eh?

426
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:49,015
Hoard the yield?
What do you mean?

427
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,688
Ask Banwari! Ask the others!

428
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:54,492
Haven't they been stocking
the yield every year!

429
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:55,955
Ask them!

430
00:41:56,397 --> 00:42:01,926
Is it true, Banwari?

431
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:04,395
And you, Shyamu?

432
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:10,242
What's gotten into you?

433
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:18,647
Look at the bust of this
great man, and you will know!

434
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,556
The dreams of such great
men are never fulfilled...

435
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:26,854
thanks to farmers like you
and businessmen like Dhaniram!

436
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,600
You have no right to do
this on a land...

437
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:38,528
where these men have
laid down their lives.

438
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,700
It's a national asset!

439
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:44,834
It's the people's property
which must reach them!

440
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:48,013
Forgive me, Bharat!

441
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:51,413
I swear! I'll never do
such a thing again!

442
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:54,453
Such a thing will never
be repeated again!

443
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,782
Have you heard them, Lala?

444
00:42:58,626 --> 00:42:59,854
You may leave now!

445
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,999
What happens when word spreads
to the neighboring village?

446
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:17,844
Lt'll gradually spread
all over.

447
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:21,075
And no one will sell their
yield to us anymore.

448
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,507
You must always think
of the worst!

449
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:28,720
If I don't make money,
how will I pay you?

450
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,750
Then what are we to do?
- Do?

451
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:35,425
Bharat will simply
not see reason.

452
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:38,492
And nor will the others,
so long as he's around.

453
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,232
In that case...

454
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,006
Lakhpati!
Go and beg of Shyamu!

455
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:49,099
Plead with Banwari!
Or I'm going to lose face!

456
00:43:49,744 --> 00:43:52,645
How am I going to face the
merchants in the city?!

457
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,814
Go and make them agree...

458
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,808
or your kids are
going to starve!

459
00:43:57,418 --> 00:44:01,286
I have no children, Lakhpati!
You will inherit all I have!

460
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:03,750
Go on! Hurry up!

461
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:08,687
How are you, Lakhpati?

462
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,323
I'm in a hurry.
I'll talk to you later.

463
00:44:14,168 --> 00:44:20,073
Greetings, Lala.
- Greetings. Sit down.

464
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,809
What brings you here?

465
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:25,404
I've returned to the
village after ages.

466
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:27,711
I thought I'd
look you up.

467
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:29,977
Is everything okay?

468
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:36,550
I need your blessings to
get things in order, Lala.

469
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:42,322
And I'll fix anyone...
you want me to.

470
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:45,157
What does that mean?

471
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:53,507
I didn't like the manner in
which Bharat spoke to you.

472
00:44:54,075 --> 00:45:00,036
Times have changed, you know.
What can I do anyway?

473
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:05,408
You can do a lot.

474
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:08,617
I've spent 12 years
in the prison, Lala.

475
00:45:09,023 --> 00:45:12,083
And I've sworn to myself
throughout the 12 years...

476
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,490
that I'd avenge myself, once
I was released from prison.

477
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:26,371
From whom?
- From Bharat.

478
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:30,066
How will you?
- With this!

479
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:32,105
Good God! Put it away!
It scares me!

480
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,569
Scared, eh?

481
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:38,810
No one will ever know!

482
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,515
I'll have avenged myself...

483
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,121
and you'll have accomplished
what you want, too.

484
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,255
No one will instigate
the villagers anymore.

485
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:52,723
This is my challenge!
- God bless my soul!

486
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:56,001
Give me the instructions.
- Instructions for what?

487
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,306
I'm a miserable man;
and you're wise man who...

488
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,199
can understand the
plight of others.

489
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:07,239
You can always tell me,
if you need some money.

490
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:12,049
Money flows like
water, Lala.

491
00:46:12,787 --> 00:46:15,881
Before the streams
of money dry up...

492
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,054
here's what you want!

493
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:39,243
What've you been
thinking of?

494
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,240
I was only admiring your
photograph. It's beautiful.

495
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,213
Really? There's the rat
turned tiger, isn't it?

496
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:51,488
How is that?

497
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:54,589
You couldn't even the muster
courage to speak in the city.

498
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:56,656
Now that you've returned
to your village...

499
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,964
you've learnt to
weave a yarn, too.

500
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,430
I have always felt like
talking, Kavita.

501
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,904
But it was out of shyness
that I couldn't speak up.

502
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:06,865
Have you become
shameless now?

503
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,803
What's wrong in lavishing
praise, where it is due?

504
00:47:12,113 --> 00:47:13,705
Your brother was right.
- What did he say?

505
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,548
"Let's praise each other"

506
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:22,354
"What better compromise with
life could one find?"

507
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:24,185
Never mind that.

508
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,722
My brother and his wife are
coming from the city tomorrow.

509
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:33,834
But I must leave now.
See you tomorrow.

510
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:47,505
Bharat...
- Yes?

511
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:51,483
Without tractors
or tube-wells...

512
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:53,978
doesn't farming require a lot
of hard work from you?

513
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:56,016
Every profession requires
hard work.

514
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,857
Besides, if a farmer
does not work...

515
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,725
where will the
grains come from?

516
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:02,928
My brother is happy with
the hard work he puts in.

517
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:07,059
But that ought to be a matter
of pride for you, too, Puran.

518
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,835
You're right.
But just look at him.

519
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:14,774
He's always slogging away,
like a pair of animals!

520
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:16,735
He's here before dawn.

521
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:20,807
And leaves the fields
after the sun has set.

522
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:23,006
Meaning?
- I mean...

523
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,614
even after giving farming
the best years of his life...

524
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:28,546
what has he stood to gain?

525
00:48:29,023 --> 00:48:30,581
The sweat that stains
his soul?

526
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,687
You have never listened
to me, Bharat.

527
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,054
Let's have our say. And let's
have her opinion.

528
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:38,498
About what?

529
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,565
Bharat is an educated man and
has never been a shirker.

530
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,234
Why shouldn't the two of us
start a trade in the city...

531
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:47,402
that helps us improve
our lifestyle?

532
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:52,745
You can't neglect your culture
out of selfishness, Puran.

533
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,104
But I...
- Puran!

534
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:57,778
Why do you want to
settle in the city?

535
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:01,283
To make money and earn
a livelihood, isn't it?

536
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,454
People in the city may either
be employers or employees.

537
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:11,661
But they're all striving
to sate their hunger!

538
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,497
And you can sate your hunger
only with bread...

539
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:21,533
with the grains you grow
in these fields.

540
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:25,601
Our migration to the city
won't cause a famine!

541
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:30,281
If every farmer thought
in the manner you do...

542
00:49:30,818 --> 00:49:33,343
do you know what
would happen?

543
00:49:33,854 --> 00:49:39,019
You'd breed hunger here,
instead of human beings.

544
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,194
Our nation faces an acute
shortage of foodgrains.

545
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,658
We have to import
our sustenance.

546
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,430
While it is indeed a favor
of those who support us...

547
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,465
it's a matter of shame
for us...

548
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:56,206
that we lack foodgrains
in a land of farmers!

549
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,636
Who is responsible for
this state of affairs?

550
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:03,346
It's the farmers who love the city,
more than they revere their lands.

551
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,481
It's those who hoard
the foodgrains.

552
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:11,649
It's those who think
of growing more...

553
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:16,155
but never give a thought
to the growing population!

554
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,964
Concentrate on the
fields, Puran!

555
00:50:21,302 --> 00:50:22,326
You know what the two
of us can do together?

556
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,462
Double our income?!
- Not the income...

557
00:50:25,973 --> 00:50:28,066
we can have double
the yield!

558
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:30,102
When we work together
shoulder to shoulder...

559
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:31,739
there will be a day...

560
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,147
when no one in this country
will ever starve!

561
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:39,842
See? Hasn't he started
lecturing me over it?!

562
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:45,347
And what are you
thinking of, doctor?

563
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,289
It's true, Puran.

564
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,424
This land is like the palm...

565
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:52,855
on which the farmer ploughs
his ware...

566
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,599
and changes the destiny
for man.

567
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:01,264
Meaning?
- I mean...

568
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:05,009
you can wear trousers
and still be a farmer!

569
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:06,604
Hear that?

570
00:51:07,181 --> 00:51:10,412
Lunch is served, Bharat!
- Come along.

571
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:16,445
Do come.

572
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:19,958
It hurts!

573
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:23,453
It's over... Be patient.

574
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:30,394
I've done it.

575
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,166
You're Mangal.
And you're Som.

576
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,940
I hope you will remember
your names now, won't you?

577
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,536
Let's go...

578
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:39,344
Hey, uncle!
- How about the money?

579
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,308
What for?
- For the tattoo, Uncle!

580
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,785
If I'm your uncle, what
would they mean to you?

581
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:47,645
Cousins, of course.

582
00:51:47,988 --> 00:51:49,114
Would you ask your
cousins for money?

583
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:50,185
Forget your dough!

584
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:54,483
Right, Som?
- Absolutely, dad!

585
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:55,624
Just come along...

586
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,660
Give him the money, dad.
He's gone yellow in the face.

587
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,331
It's not for money that
he's gone yellow!

588
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:05,500
It's the season of harvesting
that's done it to him!

589
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,898
He has a yellow face; I wear a
yellow turban. All is yellow!

590
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,301
Yellow, all!

591
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,747
I'm sick of these
illnesses, doctor.

592
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:58,015
If one has a sore-throat,
another has a stomachache!

593
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,978
It's I who has the
Stomachache, dad!

594
00:59:01,388 --> 00:59:02,446
Okay. I know...

595
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:03,847
Let me see your tongue.

596
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:08,390
I can maintain all the
accounts for my employer...

597
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:11,253
but I can't keep track of
how many children I have!

598
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:15,763
I wish you had come here
eight years ago...

599
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,730
I wouldn't have had a
caricature every year!

600
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,567
Am I a caricature, dad?
- No, son. I am!

601
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:29,877
Too many children are burdens
on the nation and the parents.

602
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,482
What'll I do, when I already
have a battalion of them?

603
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:36,517
But never mind.
I can warn my neighbors!

604
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,030
Uncle?

605
01:00:34,915 --> 01:00:37,679
I was worried when I saw
the blood you had lost.

606
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,985
Thankfully, you're
not seriously hurt.

607
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,754
How did this happen?

608
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:53,761
I slipped when I was going
towards the fields.

609
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,995
I fell on something
hard which hurt me...

610
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,233
and I came over to bother
you, so late in the night.

611
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:00,870
I must leave now.

612
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,276
I'll return this piece
of cloth tomorrow.

613
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,544
Very well.
- Thank you.

614
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:14,546
Excuse me...

615
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,984
Should you not sleep out of
pain tonight, have a pill.

616
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:35,174
Bahadur... can you check if
there's someone outside?

617
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,605
What if there is someone?
- What?

618
01:01:40,847 --> 01:01:42,246
I'll request who it is...

619
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,710
to tell anyone, but
not my mother about this.

620
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:46,815
Why?

621
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:49,314
She'll be worried sick, if
she gets to know of this.

622
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,585
I have a very nice mother.

623
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:54,291
You are very nice, too.

624
01:02:09,275 --> 01:02:13,336
Only good people can call
others good, too.

625
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,540
Isn't that why you call
everyone a good person?

626
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,854
When will you come again?

627
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:26,418
I'll have to now.

628
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,763
You're the doctor and
I'm the patient, after all.

629
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,100
There's no one around, sir.

630
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:46,302
Both of you are
terribly shy.

631
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,440
But I'll help
the two of you.

632
01:02:57,624 --> 01:03:02,118
My sister-in-law told me that
you have called me here.

633
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:06,254
And she told me that
you had called me over.

634
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:12,999
Why did she say that?
Why did she lie?

635
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,940
She did that for me.

636
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,877
Now look, madam.
You are a doctor...

637
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:26,911
and I'm a mere farmer.

638
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,890
In a world where man snatches
other's livelihood...

639
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:34,919
to sate his own hunger...

640
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:42,257
a farmer feeds so many others,
so he can earn his own living.

641
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,636
He feeds millions.

642
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:51,733
You're right.

643
01:03:52,178 --> 01:03:58,811
But you have moved to the
village, from the cities.

644
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:02,052
But perhaps I don't deserve
to spend my life in the city.

645
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:07,516
I do hail from a family
of progressive thinkers.

646
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:11,122
But our faith in the holy epics
is as strong as your own.

647
01:04:12,232 --> 01:04:16,635
In the environment
of the cities...

648
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:19,197
we may have undoubtedly
come to dress differently.

649
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:21,439
But we have not changed
our culture.

650
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:24,670
Had Puran been here now...

651
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:29,037
he'd have accused you of
lecturing him like me!

652
01:04:29,516 --> 01:04:31,143
You have evaded my question.

653
01:04:32,485 --> 01:04:35,477
Who can evade a doctor?

654
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:39,049
You haven't answered
my question either.

655
01:04:48,168 --> 01:04:50,261
Do you know what I'm carrying?

656
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:51,637
What is it?

657
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:59,273
The sleeping pill.
I didn't have it last night.

658
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:03,170
But I'm sure going to
need it tonight.

659
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,147
Let's forget the past, son.

660
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,181
Your father was hurt
quite accidentally.

661
01:06:16,623 --> 01:06:18,113
And, as you know...

662
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:22,588
I've spent 12 years in prison
to pay penance for that.

663
01:06:22,996 --> 01:06:26,397
But if you still haven't
gotten over your anger...

664
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,601
here's a knife. Give
vent to your feelings!

665
01:06:32,505 --> 01:06:35,372
By God, Puran... he has only
your welfare at heart!

666
01:06:35,842 --> 01:06:38,436
That's the only reason
why I've called you here.

667
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:44,044
Right! You want to live in
the city. Don't you, Puran?

668
01:06:44,384 --> 01:06:47,512
And you're terribly
fond of cars, right?

669
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:49,411
You can certainly have
a car for yourself.

670
01:06:50,356 --> 01:06:57,558
How? Bharat is just not
willing to sell the land.

671
01:06:57,897 --> 01:07:00,263
God forbid! You don't have
to do that at all!

672
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:04,069
I have business spread all
over the big cities.

673
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:07,439
The old man that I am, I can't
handle everything on my own.

674
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:10,375
Don't I need a man to handle
my business then?

675
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:12,710
Since you are educated, you
can take over the affairs...

676
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:14,913
in the city, and I'll handle
business in the village.

677
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:17,947
According to Lala...

678
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:22,185
you will easily get a salary
of 1500 or 2000 Rupees.

679
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,485
Really?
- Absolutely!

680
01:07:25,892 --> 01:07:28,690
Just arrange for the money
and get on with your work.

681
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,959
Arrange for money?
What for?

682
01:07:31,397 --> 01:07:32,523
I'll explain!

683
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:39,663
You will handle thousands of
Rupees for me in the city.

684
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:42,131
As security, therefore,
you will have to...

685
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,533
deposit 20000 Rupees with me.

686
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:47,179
20,000 Rupees?!

687
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,845
It's child-play for you, son.
Bharat is a rich man.

688
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:55,952
Whatever little Bharat could collect
he spent it all on my education.

689
01:07:56,255 --> 01:07:57,882
Good Lord!

690
01:07:58,257 --> 01:08:01,351
Look up the accounts, Lakhpati,
and tell me...

691
01:08:01,728 --> 01:08:04,526
how much Bharat deposited
with me and just how much...

692
01:08:04,897 --> 01:08:07,195
he took away including
the interest.

693
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:08,861
In a moment, sir!

694
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:16,738
He deposited the money
with you last year...

695
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:19,008
and took it away
only last week.

696
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:22,414
The principal was 20,000
and the interest is 3,000.

697
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:34,193
23,000 Rupees?!

698
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:45,767
Does Bharat have
so much of money?!

699
01:08:46,139 --> 01:08:48,266
He's been saving it
for years, son!

700
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:51,633
Bharat works hard and
even saves his money!

701
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:55,376
Bharat will give me the money,
if he really has it...

702
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,273
He will! Certainly!

703
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:08,350
The fish has taken the bait!

704
01:09:08,694 --> 01:09:15,623
It was dangerous to try and
kill Bharat, wasn't it?

705
01:09:16,102 --> 01:09:20,038
Yes. But there are things
I still can't figure out.

706
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:22,466
You'd better understand
that which you haven't.

707
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,469
Puran will now ask
Bharat for the money.

708
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:28,640
How will Bharat give it to
him, when he has none?

709
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:32,278
Puran will then demand the
accounts from Bharat.

710
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:35,051
And then?
- Bharat has a battle royal!

711
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:37,788
But how do we stand to
benefit from their war?

712
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:42,353
The foreign powers have
always taken advantage...

713
01:09:42,728 --> 01:09:45,925
of the fights we have with
one another in the country.

714
01:09:46,299 --> 01:09:48,096
And this chap is
a mere mortal!

715
01:09:53,372 --> 01:09:57,274
When must you leave for Delhi?
- Tomorrow morning.

716
01:09:57,743 --> 01:09:59,438
How many days will
you stay there?

717
01:09:59,846 --> 01:10:01,871
A week, perhaps.

718
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:04,181
That's quite a long
time, isn't it?

719
01:10:04,517 --> 01:10:06,610
A very close friend of mine
is getting married.

720
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,520
That will obviously
take time then.

721
01:10:09,155 --> 01:10:14,024
Yes. But I can't say whether
I'll like it there.

722
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:16,588
While you think of
leaving the city...

723
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:22,194
I'll think of your return here.
That'll take care of the time.

724
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:34,173
Kamli's father came here
this morning...

725
01:10:34,514 --> 01:10:36,209
offering her hand in
marriage to Puran.

726
01:10:36,749 --> 01:10:38,478
Even when Puran and
Kamli were kids...

727
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:40,751
your father had fixed
their alliance.

728
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:44,318
Let's just get
him married then.

729
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,950
How can I do that?

730
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:50,156
The elders marry first and
the younger ones, later.

731
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:54,728
Not I, Mom!
- Stop blabbering away!

732
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:57,227
As soon as I find a girl...

733
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,130
I'll get you married first
and Puran's turn comes next.

734
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,873
If you have a girl
in mind, just tell me.

735
01:11:04,277 --> 01:11:06,438
I won't waste time looking
for a bride for you.

736
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,672
Am I such a nincompoop...

737
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,247
that no one comes
to you with a match?

738
01:11:14,053 --> 01:11:15,520
There are so many!

739
01:11:15,922 --> 01:11:18,948
But I don't seem to
approve of any of them.

740
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:22,528
If one of the girls is tall,
the other is short.

741
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,796
Some are fat, yet
others are skinny!

742
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:28,490
What's wrong with you, Mom?

743
01:11:28,968 --> 01:11:32,096
I never used to think
of these things earlier.

744
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:34,831
But ever since I've seen
the lady-doctor...

745
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,768
it has set my mind thinking.

746
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:41,542
That's the kind of bride
I would want for you.

747
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,508
Wouldn't you like that, too?

748
01:11:46,519 --> 01:11:49,079
Puran! Come on inside...

749
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:51,287
Mom has been talking
about your marriage.

750
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:01,463
I want to see the
books of account.

751
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:06,804
The books of account?
- That's right.

752
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,008
I want to know how much
of money we have made...

753
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:15,337
how much we have spent and
just how much we've saved.

754
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:18,809
What are you talking about?

755
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:22,250
I've only asked Bharat
for the accounts, Mom.

756
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,724
I want to know how much
of money he has saved.

757
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:30,629
Saved, my foot! He slogs
through the days and nights.

758
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:34,123
He has spent whatever he had
saved on your studies.

759
01:12:35,368 --> 01:12:39,304
What made you ask
for the accounts?

760
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:43,497
Because I'm a partner, too.
- A partner?

761
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,310
Have I no right over
the property?

762
01:12:47,813 --> 01:12:50,179
Have I no right
to ask you anything?

763
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,380
Everything belongs to you!
What do you want? Speak up!

764
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:59,115
25,000 Rupees.
- So much of money?!

765
01:13:00,326 --> 01:13:02,021
It's a question of
my life.

766
01:13:02,428 --> 01:13:03,918
I could lay down my
life for you!

767
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:07,356
But what do you need
so much of money for?

768
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:11,225
Even if I burn the money...
I still want it!

769
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:17,265
So much of money, Puran?

770
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:23,337
Bharat has a lot of money, Mom.
This is easy for him.

771
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,447
I swear I have...
- Don't take false oaths!

772
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,985
What has gotten into you?

773
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:32,219
All I want is the money.

774
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:36,061
How do I convince you...
- You can't convince me!

775
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:41,532
But I can provide the proof.
- What proof?

776
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:45,200
Proof of the fact that
you're a rich man!

777
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,028
If what I say is a lie...
just come with me!

778
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:50,668
Where to?
- To Dhaniram!

779
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:57,044
Well, okay. Let's go!

780
01:14:02,388 --> 01:14:05,619
Why must I lie
to you, Bharat?

781
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:09,018
You had deposited 20,000
Rupees with me last year.

782
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,830
And I paid you 23,000
with interest last week!

783
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:14,093
It's a lie! A white lie!

784
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,663
I've got face God, son!

785
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:18,264
And I've got to show my books
to the Government.

786
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:21,630
You're an educated man!
Take a look at it!

787
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:37,120
You, your books and everything
about you is a falsehood!

788
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:40,657
Praise the Lord!

789
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:43,358
You can have your little
fights in your home.

790
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,955
Why waste the Lala's time?

791
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:47,697
Who are you to interfere?

792
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:53,167
I'm your brother.
And the Lala's employee.

793
01:14:53,773 --> 01:14:57,937
If you wanted to hide this
transaction from Puran...

794
01:14:58,277 --> 01:14:59,471
you should have told me!

795
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:01,105
Neither would I have
told Puran...

796
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,938
nor would there be a
fight between yourselves.

797
01:15:03,282 --> 01:15:05,944
You are lying again!

798
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:08,646
You have turned against me...

799
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:10,888
only because you can't get
grains from this village...

800
01:15:11,157 --> 01:15:12,215
for your black-market!

801
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:15,053
And you're my
enemy because...

802
01:15:15,394 --> 01:15:17,589
although you attacked me with
a knife, I am still alive!

803
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:20,628
Knife? What nonsense?!

804
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:30,674
You attacked me last night.

805
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,935
I didn't say a word
about this...

806
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,473
because I didn't want to
bother Puran and my mother.

807
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:38,908
This is a lie!

808
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:41,016
I was away in another village,
running an errand for Lala!

809
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,845
Ask him!
- He's right!

810
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,020
I will ask no one!

811
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:48,549
You will never succeed
in your designs, Lala.

812
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:54,556
I've a raised a voice in
this village today.

813
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:58,696
Very soon, it will be the
call of every farmer!

814
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,571
Foodgrains will go
to the needy!

815
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:06,742
Not to the dubious
stores you have built!

816
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,204
I want an account of
our holdings...

817
01:16:09,582 --> 01:16:11,948
not of the stores
the Lala has built.

818
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,181
Believe me, Radha!

819
01:16:15,688 --> 01:16:17,849
No matter how much of
affection you shower on him...

820
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:20,715
he considers you both to be
his step-relatives!

821
01:16:21,126 --> 01:16:22,718
Or why would he want to
swallow his share...

822
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:25,021
Shut up! I know you hold
a grudge against him!

823
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,265
My God! Why must I hold
a grudge against anyone?

824
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:29,434
I'm an uncle to him, just
as I'm an uncle to Puran!

825
01:16:29,902 --> 01:16:32,769
Uncle, you are.
But the Evil Uncle.

826
01:16:33,405 --> 01:16:36,101
Don't let them mislead you.

827
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,672
They've poisoned your ears
for their selfish gains!

828
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,208
Whatever they have told me
is the truth!

829
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,708
I'm glad I've awakened
to the truth about you!

830
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,448
Do you see what the
Stepson has done?!

831
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:53,084
Stepson? You are
the stepson! Not he!

832
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:55,153
Let him go, Mom!
Stop it!

833
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:59,690
Try to understand, Puran...
- Don't you touch me!

834
01:17:01,233 --> 01:17:03,599
Hear me out, both of you!

835
01:17:04,136 --> 01:17:07,572
I you don't give me my share,
I'll drag you both to the courts!

836
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,773
Don't give me the money,
if you don't want to.

837
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:11,908
Let there be a division
of our land!

838
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:15,480
You've gone mad!

839
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:18,275
You want us to divide the land?

840
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:21,445
The land... that is
like our Mother?

841
01:17:22,021 --> 01:17:23,955
How can anyone
divide a mother?!

842
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,457
I beg of you, Puran...

843
01:17:26,759 --> 01:17:28,488
There's no need to
beg before him!

844
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:32,160
He wants his share, doesn't he?
He will have it!

845
01:17:32,498 --> 01:17:33,795
Let there be a division!

846
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,668
That is my decision.
- Just settle my account.

847
01:17:38,203 --> 01:17:40,671
I don't want to live
in this village anymore!

848
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,164
You can't!

849
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:47,940
The villagers will slipper you
if you wish to live here!

850
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:53,845
The barefooted ones
will spit on you!

851
01:17:56,355 --> 01:18:00,553
You've learnt your lesson.
Haven't you, Bharat?

852
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:02,488
I asked you to do others
a favor, as you wished to...

853
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:05,126
but only after you had
looked after yourself!

854
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:10,502
The naive man that you are,
you could never realize...

855
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:14,464
that although the virtuous
ones were born in every era...

856
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:17,432
his supportive brother
was never born again!

857
01:18:17,509 --> 01:18:18,942
As for you, Puran...

858
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:25,046
You should have asked for a
share of Bharat's virtues!

859
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:28,112
A share of his humanity!

860
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,321
If there is anything you
should have asked for...

861
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:36,126
it should have been his
compassionate heart...

862
01:18:36,662 --> 01:18:39,495
that could have you
blessed, too!

863
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:44,162
Let's go, son...
This is disgusting.

864
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:48,637
Let's go away...

865
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:54,913
from this place of sin...
where dwell the evil men.

866
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,251
God Almighty!

867
01:19:08,594 --> 01:19:10,323
This piece of land will
now belong to Bharat...

868
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,255
and that one
belongs to Puran.

869
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,023
Mom!

870
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,696
Go on, Mom.

871
01:19:46,932 --> 01:19:48,456
Stop it for a while.

872
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:54,366
These are legal matters, son.

873
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:57,071
Step aside for a minute, Lala.

874
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:01,612
Go away, all of you.

875
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,185
Listen to me, Puran.

876
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,848
Hear me out, Puran!

877
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,720
I've heard everything!
That's enough for me.

878
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:16,219
You can speak instead,
if you don't want to listen!

879
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:17,854
Say it then!

880
01:20:18,297 --> 01:20:23,758
Say that I've betrayed you!
That I have cheated you!

881
01:20:24,136 --> 01:20:30,041
That I have turned out to
be a cheap double-crosser!

882
01:20:30,309 --> 01:20:35,042
But I am not as bad
as you think I am...

883
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:40,316
or people have misled
you into believing.

884
01:20:40,786 --> 01:20:45,086
Had I ever hankered
after money...

885
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:49,551
I'd have taken your advise
and moved to the city.

886
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:53,087
There was no need for me
to slog in the fields!

887
01:20:53,532 --> 01:20:57,491
If I had to eventually
betray you...

888
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:01,268
I wouldn't have
raised you either.

889
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:08,412
I sent you away to the city,
for your welfare.

890
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:11,111
I know what I've
been through...

891
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:13,678
having sent you so far away.

892
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:18,584
Had a letter from you to
be delayed for two days...

893
01:21:18,857 --> 01:21:20,347
I spend anxious time
at the post-office.

894
01:21:20,759 --> 01:21:23,455
Why did I do all that?
Only to betray you?

895
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,560
No... it's not true.

896
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:29,026
Everything is still the same.

897
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:32,460
Just come and apologize
to Mom...

898
01:21:32,871 --> 01:21:34,964
Let's put an end
to her agony.

899
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,472
I cannot change my decision!

900
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,935
Besides, I've only asked
for my share!

901
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,802
Why must that bother you?

902
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:55,260
It does hurt a man... when
one's limbs are severed.

903
01:21:57,863 --> 01:22:00,093
It is a blow to one's soul!

904
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:05,869
But, then... I'm
a man of honor.

905
01:22:06,205 --> 01:22:09,606
I have always opposed a
division; and still do.

906
01:22:11,143 --> 01:22:14,806
Here you are... Take this.

907
01:22:16,048 --> 01:22:17,948
This the Title Deed
of the entire property.

908
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:20,476
I have already
willed it away.

909
01:22:20,986 --> 01:22:22,613
I have willed my share of
the property...

910
01:22:23,121 --> 01:22:28,423
in your children's name.

911
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:36,400
That too, because I don't you
to sell the fields...

912
01:22:36,802 --> 01:22:41,637
and heap humiliation
on our motherland!

913
01:22:42,674 --> 01:22:46,269
Our mother has shed tears
on his piece of land!

914
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:50,605
It has the sweat and blood
of our forefathers!

915
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:07,530
This land belongs to
our future generations.

916
01:23:07,866 --> 01:23:10,096
It is our bounden duty
to preserve it.

917
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:12,968
It is our duty to
plough the land.

918
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:19,672
Promise me, that you will
never neglect the fields.

919
01:23:20,712 --> 01:23:26,082
I implore you, in the
name of this soil!

920
01:27:48,454 --> 01:27:50,012
I have been transferred.

921
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:53,891
I thought I'd meet you,
before I left for the city.

922
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,120
I got to know everything,
when I visited the village.

923
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:00,422
It's thanks to the rains that
I've got meet you today.

924
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:03,700
You didn't tell anyone
that you were leaving...

925
01:28:04,003 --> 01:28:07,336
not even your mother.
Why?

926
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:09,336
I couldn't muster the
courage, Major.

927
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:11,600
My mother's tears would
have shackled me.

928
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:15,777
I think things will improve
if I stay away for some time.

929
01:28:16,682 --> 01:28:18,115
But how did you get here?

930
01:28:18,618 --> 01:28:20,381
I arrived in the
Sikh's truck.

931
01:28:21,854 --> 01:28:23,219
The truck belongs to God,
my friend.

932
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:24,582
I was only at the wheels.

933
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:29,394
Where will you go now?
- Anywhere.

934
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:32,960
And what will you do?
- Anything.

935
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,360
Do you have something to
get on with anything?

936
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:42,407
I have two able hands.

937
01:28:42,742 --> 01:28:48,476
These are my goodwill
and my investment, Major.

938
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:51,182
What are you
thinking of, Major?

939
01:28:55,154 --> 01:28:58,851
I was wondering if a farmer...

940
01:28:59,258 --> 01:29:04,025
could be a soldier.
Is that possible?

941
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:08,998
Really?
- Of course! Let's go.

942
01:29:09,502 --> 01:29:11,936
How much for the tea?
- I have already paid him.

943
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:35,123
This way...

944
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:36,792
This is our store, son.

945
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:39,822
Follow me...

946
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,429
We have ten stores
as big as this one.

947
01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:46,566
We stock wheat in 8
and rice in the other two.

948
01:29:46,906 --> 01:29:48,203
Follow me...

949
01:29:51,644 --> 01:29:53,771
It's for you to handle
the show now.

950
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:57,616
I'll introduce you to my
other partners this evening.

951
01:29:58,017 --> 01:29:59,814
Work hard and honestly...

952
01:30:00,152 --> 01:30:05,522
and just make sure you keep
everything a secret.

953
01:30:07,126 --> 01:30:09,151
So you have joined
the army, have you?

954
01:30:09,462 --> 01:30:14,058
Yes. Farmers and soldiers...
both yield to the land.

955
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,058
When are you visiting
the village?

956
01:30:18,004 --> 01:30:21,371
I will, during my leave,
after the training.

957
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:23,739
During the leave?

958
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:31,376
When are you going
to the village?

959
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,382
Tomorrow.

960
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,782
Would you do me a favor?
- What is it?

961
01:30:37,256 --> 01:30:42,023
I just got this address from your
clinic when I left the village.

962
01:30:42,628 --> 01:30:45,426
I met no one else.

963
01:30:46,098 --> 01:30:47,998
Not even my mother.

964
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:52,932
Please look after her,
if that's possible for you.

965
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,533
I won't be able
to do that.

966
01:30:59,378 --> 01:31:02,541
It's my duty to serve
your mother.

967
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:05,315
I can very well do that.

968
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:06,677
Anything else?

969
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,323
Tea is served, Kavita!
Come over quickly.

970
01:32:58,964 --> 01:33:01,262
Come along... let me
show you my new house.

971
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:16,910
I couldn't wait for you
to visit the village.

972
01:33:17,316 --> 01:33:18,340
So I came over myself.

973
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:19,707
When did you come
to the city?

974
01:33:20,152 --> 01:33:23,087
I came this morning.
But I've arrived just now.

975
01:33:23,622 --> 01:33:25,385
How's Mom? And Mr. Malang?

976
01:33:25,658 --> 01:33:28,218
They're all fine. And they
miss you a lot, too.

977
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:32,061
I'm getting a leave of 2
months in a couple of days.

978
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:34,229
I'll sprint to the village,
the moment it comes through.

979
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:35,864
Should you be
against sprinting...

980
01:33:36,202 --> 01:33:37,760
you can drive with me
in 10 days time.

981
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,771
Between the family in which
you've been brought up...

982
01:33:49,115 --> 01:33:51,675
and the one you intend
to marry into...

983
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:54,575
there's a lot
of difference.

984
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,547
Differences, there are...
but no obstacles.

985
01:33:59,225 --> 01:34:03,787
Please don't misunderstand me.

986
01:34:04,964 --> 01:34:10,459
I admit, Bharat possesses
all the good qualities.

987
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:14,729
Feelings of humanity, ideals,
and principles...

988
01:34:15,141 --> 01:34:19,669
but you need much more to
live comfortably in society.

989
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,910
Is he capable of that?

990
01:34:29,088 --> 01:34:32,114
I'd have been happier
if you had asked...

991
01:34:32,758 --> 01:34:42,861
if I'm worthy of a man who
has ideals and principles.

992
01:34:43,502 --> 01:34:46,665
You're right.

993
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:55,111
We can get the richest of
men, should we want to.

994
01:34:56,782 --> 01:35:03,688
Besides, we forge such
ties, only once in life.

995
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:12,462
Such ties are never forged;
they happen on their own.

996
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:16,333
As happened, in my case.

997
01:35:33,919 --> 01:35:37,878
I went home, but Mom wasn't there.
Would you know where she is?

998
01:35:39,091 --> 01:35:40,752
She has gone to the city.

999
01:35:42,828 --> 01:35:44,523
You seem to be angry.

1000
01:35:44,964 --> 01:35:47,023
Your father spoke
of our marriage...

1001
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:49,026
He did speak of it...

1002
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:54,495
And it was meant for Puran;
not someone called Kumar.

1003
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:00,640
How's the car?

1004
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:05,079
It's good... very good.

1005
01:36:05,484 --> 01:36:13,914
Cast a glance at your fields, Puran...
and see how they are.

1006
01:36:42,721 --> 01:36:45,121
Why are you quiet, Madam?

1007
01:36:45,557 --> 01:36:47,320
We have even invited some guests...

1008
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,394
and what could you
be thinking of?

1009
01:36:51,196 --> 01:37:01,436
I've been thinking of the vast
difference between you and us.

1010
01:37:01,874 --> 01:37:04,672
You have given me such
respect and joy...

1011
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:11,677
that I can't bring myself
about to express anything!

1012
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:17,313
We must have been related
in our previous birth, too...

1013
01:37:17,756 --> 01:37:23,251
that we have got to have a
daughter-in-law like Kavita...

1014
01:37:23,529 --> 01:37:29,559
Neither will we find a boy
like Bharat anywhere in India.

1015
01:37:30,903 --> 01:37:39,572
What was that?
I didn't follow you...

1016
01:37:39,912 --> 01:37:43,143
For purpose of
"Dhanyamaan"...

1017
01:37:45,517 --> 01:37:48,042
"Dhanyamaan"? What is that?

1018
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,287
It was a similar word...
Now, what was it?

1019
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:52,887
Kanyadaan (giving the girl
away in marriage).

1020
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:55,616
Yes! It was giving the
girl away in marriage!

1021
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:58,759
Whom, but Bharat, could we
give away our girl to?

1022
01:37:59,765 --> 01:38:01,232
I understand!

1023
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:04,092
You've told Bharat about
this evening, I hope?

1024
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,307
The battalion has
assembled here, sir!

1025
01:38:57,289 --> 01:38:59,223
I have orders for you.

1026
01:38:59,658 --> 01:39:01,853
The enemy has attacked
our nation!

1027
01:39:02,361 --> 01:39:05,922
Our integrity is being
challenged by the offender!

1028
01:39:06,365 --> 01:39:08,629
We will give them
a fitting reply!

1029
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:11,468
Anyone who sets foot on
our sacred land...

1030
01:39:11,837 --> 01:39:13,737
shall be wiped out!

1031
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:17,102
We have just 8 hours.

1032
01:39:17,509 --> 01:39:18,999
Be prepared.

1033
01:39:19,478 --> 01:39:24,040
We leave at anytime for
"Operation Area"

1034
01:39:36,562 --> 01:39:39,895
Who's that? Daman?
- Yes, this is Daman here.

1035
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,291
This is Bharat here.

1036
01:39:43,035 --> 01:39:44,969
I'll be there by
six, this evening.

1037
01:39:45,571 --> 01:39:48,267
But I'll have to return soon.

1038
01:39:48,674 --> 01:39:49,834
Why is that?

1039
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:53,437
My leave has been cancelled.

1040
01:39:53,712 --> 01:39:55,475
What for?

1041
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:56,839
We are into war.

1042
01:39:57,716 --> 01:40:00,742
We are on a notice of
just eight hours.

1043
01:40:01,553 --> 01:40:06,354
The C.O. Has given me
4 hours...

1044
01:40:06,658 --> 01:40:08,683
after getting to know
of everything.

1045
01:40:09,027 --> 01:40:10,392
Will you be going
to war, too?

1046
01:40:10,762 --> 01:40:12,286
Yes, I will.

1047
01:40:13,098 --> 01:40:18,161
But please don't mention this
to Kavita or my mother.

1048
01:40:18,704 --> 01:40:21,400
I'll explain it personally.

1049
01:40:24,877 --> 01:40:28,643
Something wrong, Bharat?

1050
01:40:28,947 --> 01:40:30,574
Nothing.
- What are you thinking of?

1051
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:35,177
Just that my mother has a
happy day after ages today.

1052
01:40:35,854 --> 01:40:37,788
But naturally. A mother
goes crazy with joy...

1053
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:39,452
when her son is engaged
to be married.

1054
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:41,283
Yes, but I mean...

1055
01:40:41,593 --> 01:40:43,618
Are you worried?
About the war?

1056
01:40:43,896 --> 01:40:45,295
Not at all.

1057
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:46,863
I consider myself fortunate...

1058
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,633
that I have been called upon
to perform my duty.

1059
01:40:50,035 --> 01:40:52,765
What I am worried about is
how I will reveal...

1060
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:58,906
all this to my mother,
on a day like this one?

1061
01:40:59,311 --> 01:41:00,903
What will I tell Kavita?

1062
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:07,715
What kind of a test are
we being subjected to?

1063
01:41:17,062 --> 01:41:25,470
Look, dear... my son will
be here in a little while.

1064
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:34,840
Let not our eyes reveal the
turmoil we're going through.

1065
01:41:36,782 --> 01:41:40,582
Let's leave him happy.

1066
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:46,915
Let's allow him to be happy.

1067
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:19,956
How are you, Kavita

1068
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,154
How are you?

1069
01:42:24,563 --> 01:42:28,363
Who wouldn't be happy
on such a day?

1070
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:32,602
Congratulations...

1071
01:42:33,171 --> 01:42:35,935
I got to know over the phone.
- What is that?

1072
01:42:36,408 --> 01:42:38,342
That Mom has consented
to our match.

1073
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:43,377
Mom had once told me
in the village...

1074
01:42:43,815 --> 01:42:47,046
that she'd find me a wife
just like you.

1075
01:42:47,486 --> 01:42:51,513
And there she is! She's
bringing me Kavita herself!

1076
01:42:51,923 --> 01:42:54,824
She must be thrilled...
isn't it?

1077
01:42:56,461 --> 01:43:01,626
But there is something
I can't figure out.

1078
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,160
What is that?

1079
01:43:03,602 --> 01:43:05,229
You fell in love
with a farmer...

1080
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:09,505
you're getting
engaged to a soldier...

1081
01:43:09,941 --> 01:43:13,035
but whom will you
eventually marry?

1082
01:43:17,015 --> 01:43:21,475
Marry? Must I tell you?

1083
01:43:21,987 --> 01:43:23,852
I'll marry a man...

1084
01:43:24,323 --> 01:43:32,628
who will bring the fields to
life, when he ploughs them.

1085
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:39,163
Who will emerge victorious
when he turns a soldier...

1086
01:43:39,604 --> 01:43:41,572
and prompt the nation
into saying...

1087
01:43:41,907 --> 01:43:43,841
"Glory to the soldier;
glory to the farmer"

1088
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:48,943
Bharat! My son!

1089
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:55,853
Mother!

1090
01:44:01,326 --> 01:44:06,389
Mother!
How are you?

1091
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:10,930
Now that I have seen you,
I am happy.

1092
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:15,067
I am delighted.

1093
01:45:05,824 --> 01:45:09,624
Mr. Bharat will sing
a song for us!

1094
01:45:17,736 --> 01:45:20,728
When I was engaged,
I sang a song, too.

1095
01:45:21,173 --> 01:45:25,007
Now that you're getting
engaged, you must sing!

1096
01:49:54,446 --> 01:49:57,006
Why are you quiet, Mom?

1097
01:49:57,449 --> 01:50:00,782
There's nothing to
be worried about.

1098
01:50:02,454 --> 01:50:04,513
Don't be scared.

1099
01:50:04,956 --> 01:50:06,253
History is witness...

1100
01:50:06,658 --> 01:50:10,355
that every mother of this
country has blessed her son...

1101
01:50:10,795 --> 01:50:17,724
to go and protect
the motherland.

1102
01:50:18,203 --> 01:50:23,038
I was not destined to toil
in the fields...

1103
01:50:23,441 --> 01:50:29,778
but this is how I will
perhaps serve the motherland.

1104
01:50:30,882 --> 01:50:35,842
When you meet Puran...
do forgive him.

1105
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:45,193
I met everyone today...
except him.

1106
01:50:46,564 --> 01:50:50,864
Give him my regards,
when you meet him.

1107
01:50:51,669 --> 01:50:54,502
I wonder if we will
ever meet again...

1108
01:50:54,839 --> 01:50:59,833
No! Don't ever say that!

1109
01:51:03,515 --> 01:51:07,076
You have the blessings of
millions of this country...

1110
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:10,785
nothing can ever harm you!
Nothing can!

1111
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:20,794
Go on, my son.

1112
01:51:21,099 --> 01:51:25,058
There's little time. And you
have to meet a challenge.

1113
01:51:25,904 --> 01:51:31,672
Mother...
- Yes, my son.

1114
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:33,172
Go on...

1115
01:52:02,607 --> 01:52:05,872
O Lord! Protect him!

1116
01:52:32,604 --> 01:52:37,234
In the name of the Lord...
victory shall be ours!

1117
01:52:57,462 --> 01:52:58,258
Let's retreat!

1118
01:52:58,596 --> 01:53:01,622
The Indian forces are
advancing in great numbers!

1119
01:53:23,888 --> 01:53:26,288
Glory to India!

1120
01:53:28,226 --> 01:53:30,524
We do believe in peace.

1121
01:53:30,962 --> 01:53:39,802
We will try to maintain
peace, if possible.

1122
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:45,402
But there is no room for
cowardice and spinelessness!

1123
01:53:45,743 --> 01:53:52,273
We will answer their guns
with our own bullets!

1124
01:53:57,322 --> 01:53:59,984
Congratulations!

1125
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,351
Now is when we get the right
price for our grains!

1126
01:54:04,762 --> 01:54:06,354
A war has been declared.

1127
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:08,660
If prices have
doubled today...

1128
01:54:09,033 --> 01:54:10,728
they will increase
four-fold soon.

1129
01:54:11,102 --> 01:54:14,367
We stand to make 16 Rupees
for every Rupee we invest!

1130
01:54:14,772 --> 01:54:16,364
What do you think?

1131
01:54:17,075 --> 01:54:20,101
It's a good idea,
but dangerous, too.

1132
01:54:20,511 --> 01:54:22,638
Danger? Danger from whom?

1133
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:24,676
From the Government.

1134
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:27,779
The police have been
carrying out raids recently.

1135
01:54:28,252 --> 01:54:31,744
The police will never be
able to reach our stores.

1136
01:54:32,757 --> 01:54:34,952
How many places
will they raid?

1137
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,853
The villages? Our
stores in Delhi...

1138
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:40,687
Bombay and Calcutta?

1139
01:54:41,232 --> 01:54:44,201
How many places can
they reach anyway?

1140
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:48,033
Greetings, Mr. Lakhpati!
- Greetings, sir.

1141
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:49,564
Please sit down.

1142
01:54:49,907 --> 01:54:50,874
What brings you here.

1143
01:54:51,242 --> 01:54:53,267
I came here with
Mr. Dhaniram...

1144
01:54:53,611 --> 01:54:56,171
and I thought I'd
look you up, too.

1145
01:54:56,447 --> 01:54:58,711
That's kind of you. But
where are you put up?

1146
01:54:59,317 --> 01:55:01,308
We're staying with Puran.

1147
01:55:01,619 --> 01:55:03,348
He's become a big man!

1148
01:55:03,788 --> 01:55:08,418
Had Bharat listened to
his brother's advise...

1149
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,320
he'd have been
a happy man today.

1150
01:55:12,063 --> 01:55:13,189
What business is Puran into?

1151
01:55:13,664 --> 01:55:16,929
He trades in foodgrains
with the Lala.

1152
01:55:17,402 --> 01:55:19,370
It was always a very
lucrative business.

1153
01:55:19,737 --> 01:55:23,002
But since war broke out,
it's become even better.

1154
01:55:24,275 --> 01:55:29,269
Puran said they'd make 100
for what is worth 1 Rupee!

1155
01:55:29,614 --> 01:55:30,638
How is that?

1156
01:55:31,015 --> 01:55:34,951
They've locked up all the
stores with foodgrains.

1157
01:55:35,553 --> 01:55:38,147
Inflation will set in when
there is a famine...

1158
01:55:38,623 --> 01:55:42,320
and foodgrains will sell for
many times their cost!

1159
01:55:42,794 --> 01:55:46,753
And they have many stores
in so many cities!

1160
01:55:47,265 --> 01:55:50,598
Where does Puran live?
- On Nehru Road.

1161
01:55:51,169 --> 01:55:52,636
What's the name of
the building?

1162
01:55:53,004 --> 01:55:54,562
It's called Seva Sadan
(House of Service).

1163
01:55:55,206 --> 01:55:59,575
Wonderful! A right place
for the right man!

1164
01:56:01,245 --> 01:56:04,646
I must take your
leave now, Mr. Lakhpati.

1165
01:56:05,016 --> 01:56:07,780
I've got to attend to
something urgent. Good-bye.

1166
01:56:08,119 --> 01:56:09,313
Good-bye.

1167
01:56:11,722 --> 01:56:14,156
I haven't made a mistake by
telling him, have I?

1168
01:56:14,559 --> 01:56:16,959
Not at all. You've done
the right thing.

1169
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:34,835
I won't spare you!
Take that!

1170
01:56:35,113 --> 01:56:37,809
Why are you beating him up?
Why?!

1171
01:56:38,349 --> 01:56:39,907
I gave him food yesterday!

1172
01:56:40,318 --> 01:56:41,785
And he's back to
asking for more!

1173
01:56:44,188 --> 01:56:45,553
Food?!

1174
01:56:59,137 --> 01:57:00,331
Why aren't you eating?

1175
01:57:00,771 --> 01:57:02,671
I'm on a diet.

1176
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:06,537
It doesn't look like it.

1177
02:00:02,086 --> 02:00:05,180
In the shadows of a
night so intoxicating...

1178
02:00:05,823 --> 02:00:09,224
what a nightmarish night
do these youngsters spend!

1179
02:00:09,593 --> 02:00:13,359
So dark it is!

1180
02:02:29,233 --> 02:02:32,964
Issues as this one relating
to the nation...

1181
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:38,501
are often dismissed lightly
by these vicious characters.

1182
02:02:39,043 --> 02:02:40,772
These men who drink...

1183
02:02:41,312 --> 02:02:43,940
drink not liquor...

1184
02:02:44,348 --> 02:02:46,282
but the blood of
innumerable human beings!

1185
02:02:47,985 --> 02:02:52,012
And now that children
starve for a morsel...

1186
02:02:52,456 --> 02:02:57,291
such men trample precious
food under their feet!

1187
02:02:59,296 --> 02:03:03,357
Several such roses are
crushed in their hands!

1188
02:03:12,476 --> 02:03:16,936
People have not even
clothing to cover themselves.

1189
02:03:17,381 --> 02:03:21,579
And these gentlemen are
not fond of dressing!

1190
02:03:30,094 --> 02:03:33,427
These men of the
intoxicating nights...

1191
02:03:33,831 --> 02:03:35,822
also responsible for
the dark nights for many...

1192
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:43,538
are drunk on wine
and women...

1193
02:06:52,262 --> 02:06:54,457
I want this stock
increased four-fold.

1194
02:06:55,032 --> 02:06:59,332
Mix thrice the quantity
of tiny stones.

1195
02:07:00,037 --> 02:07:03,302
Buy all the stocks of rice
available in the market.

1196
02:07:03,807 --> 02:07:05,741
Buy it at any price
it is available.

1197
02:07:06,043 --> 02:07:07,476
Sir!

1198
02:07:07,711 --> 02:07:09,269
The police are here!

1199
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:12,478
Police?! Run away!
Escape!

1200
02:09:28,018 --> 02:09:29,849
For God's sake!

1201
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:32,279
Why did you have to go
and tell him everything?!

1202
02:09:33,023 --> 02:09:37,289
I didn't know that Mr. Daman
is a policeman.

1203
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:41,089
I was only bragging!

1204
02:09:41,465 --> 02:09:44,730
I didn't know we're into
something illegal!

1205
02:09:45,102 --> 02:09:46,899
Lakhpathi has deliberately
done this!

1206
02:09:47,304 --> 02:09:48,931
Why should I do that?

1207
02:09:49,273 --> 02:09:52,140
Couldn't I tell Puran
that the two of you...

1208
02:09:52,509 --> 02:09:56,843
instigated a fight between
brothers by lying to him?

1209
02:09:57,281 --> 02:09:59,374
You have been paid
by my boss!

1210
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,717
But what have I received?

1211
02:10:01,351 --> 02:10:05,685
If you begin to suspect me,
I'll spill the beans to Puran!

1212
02:10:15,332 --> 02:10:18,233
He's joking, Puran!

1213
02:10:18,702 --> 02:10:22,570
But even if we have lied,
it was for your own welfare!

1214
02:10:23,907 --> 02:10:29,436
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you?

1215
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:31,313
It was for your own
welfare, I say!

1216
02:10:31,615 --> 02:10:33,776
And now that you've grown
rich, you act smart with me?

1217
02:10:34,451 --> 02:10:37,614
Whatever he has done has been
for your own good, son!

1218
02:10:37,988 --> 02:10:41,219
Besides, think of what you
are... and what you were!

1219
02:10:44,795 --> 02:10:47,355
What have I come to be?

1220
02:10:48,598 --> 02:10:50,589
Where have I landed?

1221
02:10:54,237 --> 02:11:01,905
Lt'd be best for us to
flee to the village!

1222
02:11:02,379 --> 02:11:05,109
If the police land here,
we'd be in real trouble!

1223
02:11:06,516 --> 02:11:08,643
Lakhpati! You are
accompanying us!

1224
02:11:12,022 --> 02:11:15,856
Our enemy is silent
since this morning.

1225
02:11:16,393 --> 02:11:18,293
The enemy has
captured the Major.

1226
02:11:19,296 --> 02:11:22,265
The enemy laid siege to the
jeep we were travelling in.

1227
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:24,190
They overpowered the Major.

1228
02:11:24,601 --> 02:11:25,693
I followed them quietly...

1229
02:11:26,203 --> 02:11:28,296
they're now hiding
behind the hills.

1230
02:11:29,072 --> 02:11:31,199
The Major was carrying
some important documents.

1231
02:11:32,275 --> 02:11:33,401
We must save him.

1232
02:11:34,111 --> 02:11:36,341
Get ready, Bharat!

1233
02:11:39,483 --> 02:11:42,850
This is where they are
holding the Major captive.

1234
02:11:43,587 --> 02:11:46,317
The enemy troops number
not less 25 to 30 men.

1235
02:11:48,025 --> 02:11:49,890
Set off a fire
on the other side.

1236
02:12:41,778 --> 02:12:43,075
Where did the gunfire
come from?

1237
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:44,847
From yonder!

1238
02:13:02,632 --> 02:13:03,428
What's up?

1239
02:13:59,222 --> 02:14:01,156
The Indian Major
refuses to speak...

1240
02:14:01,691 --> 02:14:05,457
and we can't decode this
message and this map.

1241
02:14:06,129 --> 02:14:07,824
Go and bring the Major
here again.

1242
02:14:13,203 --> 02:14:15,000
Who are you?
- Bharat

1243
02:14:15,438 --> 02:14:18,430
What do you want?
- The Major... hurry up!

1244
02:14:35,926 --> 02:14:37,894
Bharat!
- Let's go, sir!

1245
02:14:38,328 --> 02:14:40,262
The map and the documents
are very important, Bharat!

1246
02:14:40,664 --> 02:14:41,722
Go ahead, sir.
I'll fetch them!

1247
02:14:42,032 --> 02:14:43,363
You'll find a soldier
waiting outside.

1248
02:14:43,667 --> 02:14:44,634
...Map?

1249
02:14:50,006 --> 02:14:50,870
Let's go, sir.

1250
02:14:51,274 --> 02:14:53,003
Hurry up, Bharat!

1251
02:14:53,643 --> 02:14:55,008
Not there, sir.
This way, please.

1252
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:50,253
What kind of men are you?

1253
02:16:50,727 --> 02:16:54,185
Why don't you give me
some water to drink?!

1254
02:16:54,597 --> 02:16:57,122
You will get the water
when it arrives.

1255
02:16:57,567 --> 02:17:00,627
Why have I been kept in darkness?
Why is there no light?

1256
02:17:01,137 --> 02:17:04,629
Till the lamp arrives,
you will stay in darkness.

1257
02:17:58,895 --> 02:18:00,192
Take him away to the HQ!

1258
02:18:00,530 --> 02:18:02,589
If you try to escape again,
you will be killed!

1259
02:18:03,099 --> 02:18:05,863
Soldiers are not
afraid of death!

1260
02:19:07,497 --> 02:19:09,397
You are given time
till dawn tomorrow.

1261
02:19:09,699 --> 02:19:12,190
If you still don't
answer our questions...

1262
02:19:12,502 --> 02:19:13,867
you can imagine
the consequences!

1263
02:19:19,742 --> 02:19:22,302
No!

1264
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:27,578
When I woke up from my
slumber today, I realized...

1265
02:19:28,151 --> 02:19:33,953
that life itself has treated
me like a poisonous snake!

1266
02:19:34,457 --> 02:19:40,191
The devil whose world
revolved around...

1267
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:42,295
riches, cars and bungalows...

1268
02:19:42,699 --> 02:19:47,898
today stands defeated,
dead and vanquished!

1269
02:19:50,273 --> 02:19:59,477
I have come to you.
To hand myself over to you.

1270
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,881
Ask the Government...

1271
02:20:02,452 --> 02:20:06,354
to parade traitors like
me in public...

1272
02:20:06,756 --> 02:20:10,214
and heap shame on me!

1273
02:20:10,527 --> 02:20:12,757
So no Puran ever tries
to be a Kumar again!

1274
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:19,896
So no brother suspects his
God-like brother ever again!

1275
02:20:35,885 --> 02:20:38,945
The Indian Service Society:
Hospital

1276
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:55,661
Brother?! You?

1277
02:20:56,205 --> 02:20:57,763
I came to take him away.

1278
02:20:58,408 --> 02:20:59,898
Praise the Lord, Lala!

1279
02:21:00,276 --> 02:21:02,073
I'm doomed, lady!

1280
02:21:02,445 --> 02:21:05,505
Talk to your brother,
will you? ...Well?!

1281
02:21:05,949 --> 02:21:07,246
My brother is a wise man.

1282
02:21:07,650 --> 02:21:09,174
Whatever he does
is right.

1283
02:21:10,053 --> 02:21:11,543
Listen to me, Kavita.

1284
02:21:12,322 --> 02:21:15,621
Tell Puran's mother that
his life has changed.

1285
02:21:16,059 --> 02:21:18,550
How?
- He has turned an approver.

1286
02:21:18,962 --> 02:21:20,088
He is the one who revealed
the names of the Lala...

1287
02:21:20,396 --> 02:21:21,658
and other blackmarketers.

1288
02:21:22,098 --> 02:21:24,896
It is with his help that
we have unearthed...

1289
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:27,132
foodgrains in millions of
tons from various stores.

1290
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:28,960
All that in just one night.
- And where is Puran.

1291
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,839
He's in the city, but will
be here in a day or two.

1292
02:21:32,642 --> 02:21:34,610
Have you any news of Bharat?

1293
02:21:36,913 --> 02:21:38,778
No.

1294
02:21:50,126 --> 02:21:51,286
Look there!

1295
02:21:51,628 --> 02:21:53,789
Our pilots have waylaid
two Indian aircraft's!

1296
02:22:10,279 --> 02:22:11,007
And what is that?

1297
02:22:13,049 --> 02:22:16,109
The Indian pilots have made
away with their aircraft's!

1298
02:25:11,527 --> 02:25:13,119
Malang uncle!

1299
02:25:22,672 --> 02:25:26,369
What state are you in?!

1300
02:25:26,976 --> 02:25:30,070
I was captured
by the enemy.

1301
02:25:30,713 --> 02:25:32,544
I've had great difficulty
in reaching this place.

1302
02:25:32,949 --> 02:25:34,883
You have lost
a lot of blood!

1303
02:25:36,919 --> 02:25:39,080
Which village is this?

1304
02:25:39,989 --> 02:25:44,756
Village? It used to be...
it does not exist anymore.

1305
02:25:45,261 --> 02:25:48,196
The few houses that
existed here...

1306
02:25:48,631 --> 02:25:50,997
were bombed without
respite...

1307
02:25:51,434 --> 02:25:56,633
The village and its citizens
lie in ruin and disaster!

1308
02:26:00,109 --> 02:26:01,701
How did you get here?

1309
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:07,007
I had accompanied a music party
and somehow got here.

1310
02:26:07,516 --> 02:26:10,610
We distributed the food we
got from the residents...

1311
02:26:11,053 --> 02:26:14,921
among the needy and
the soldiers, too.

1312
02:26:18,094 --> 02:26:19,925
How far is our village
from here?

1313
02:26:20,463 --> 02:26:22,260
4 miles.

1314
02:26:22,798 --> 02:26:23,890
We were about to return...

1315
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:27,497
when the enemy planes blew up
the bridge across the river.

1316
02:26:27,837 --> 02:26:29,395
Som and Mangal were
with me, too.

1317
02:26:29,739 --> 02:26:31,229
They've gone to find
another route.

1318
02:26:50,126 --> 02:26:51,787
What happened, son?

1319
02:26:53,362 --> 02:26:55,159
What's wrong?

1320
02:26:55,431 --> 02:26:58,025
Water...
- I'll get it!

1321
02:27:02,204 --> 02:27:05,196
I'll fetch it in a minute!

1322
02:27:22,358 --> 02:27:25,725
Here you are, Bharat!
Have some water!

1323
02:27:29,999 --> 02:27:32,627
Blood!

1324
02:27:39,709 --> 02:27:43,042
For all the people who
died in the well...

1325
02:27:43,412 --> 02:27:46,813
it has turned the
water, red, too!

1326
02:27:47,717 --> 02:27:52,518
Where are the devils
who wage a war?

1327
02:27:53,456 --> 02:27:57,790
Where are the wolves who
thirst for human-blood?!

1328
02:27:58,427 --> 02:28:01,885
If I were to meet them,
I'd say...

1329
02:28:02,231 --> 02:28:06,258
if you still aren't satisfied
with the lives lost...

1330
02:28:06,669 --> 02:28:12,539
come and sate your thirst
with this blood!

1331
02:28:13,209 --> 02:28:20,342
Man has now gone
beyond the Moon...

1332
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:26,689
but humanity has sunk to the
levels of the bloody-water!

1333
02:28:26,989 --> 02:28:28,320
Water...

1334
02:28:28,791 --> 02:28:31,453
I'll go and bring some
water for you, son!

1335
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:23,938
Shame be on you, you swine!

1336
02:29:24,413 --> 02:29:28,509
People cremate or
bury the dead!

1337
02:29:28,884 --> 02:29:33,947
But you are robbing them
even after they are dead!

1338
02:29:34,323 --> 02:29:37,554
She was a newly-wed bride
who was killed...

1339
02:29:37,927 --> 02:29:41,021
and her husband must be
lying dead somewhere, too.

1340
02:29:41,497 --> 02:29:44,022
It won't make any difference
even if you take away...

1341
02:29:44,533 --> 02:29:46,592
her matrimonial necklace.
- You're crazy, Malang.

1342
02:29:47,002 --> 02:29:48,765
You can't get such
opportunities everyday.

1343
02:29:49,505 --> 02:29:50,904
Fill your pockets!

1344
02:29:51,373 --> 02:29:53,398
You'll find many expensive
things lying around!

1345
02:29:53,843 --> 02:29:57,108
Sure. Many expensive
things indeed!

1346
02:29:57,646 --> 02:30:00,774
But there is something
more expensive, too.

1347
02:30:01,117 --> 02:30:02,084
Let's take him
to the village.

1348
02:30:02,451 --> 02:30:04,180
Who is it?
- Bharat.

1349
02:30:04,653 --> 02:30:08,851
He's badly wounded.

1350
02:30:09,425 --> 02:30:11,154
Let's carry him
to the village.

1351
02:30:11,827 --> 02:30:13,488
Do a good deed...

1352
02:30:13,796 --> 02:30:16,788
and it'll wash away
all your sins!

1353
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:19,494
Where is he?
- Lying by the well.

1354
02:30:19,969 --> 02:30:22,529
Let's go to him.
- Go on...

1355
02:30:22,838 --> 02:30:25,204
I'll go and find
some water for him!

1356
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:34,577
Recognize me?

1357
02:30:35,851 --> 02:30:37,045
Uncle?

1358
02:30:38,154 --> 02:30:39,451
The evil uncle!

1359
02:30:41,757 --> 02:30:43,884
The legendary evil man could
not slay his nephew...

1360
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:47,195
but I will not spare you!

1361
02:30:51,133 --> 02:30:52,623
Look at this!

1362
02:30:54,270 --> 02:30:59,139
See this? Do you?!

1363
02:32:20,289 --> 02:32:21,950
No!

1364
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:16,271
Get up!

1365
02:33:20,349 --> 02:33:23,318
Face me!

1366
02:33:24,119 --> 02:33:26,087
Face me, my foot!

1367
02:33:26,355 --> 02:33:28,323
Go away!
Get lost, you scoundrel!

1368
02:33:28,891 --> 02:33:31,223
Get the hell out of here!

1369
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:07,727
Let me see who
saves you now!

1370
02:35:39,455 --> 02:35:41,980
Malang uncle!
- Malang uncle!

1371
02:36:21,096 --> 02:36:24,088
Open your eyes, my son!

1372
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:25,924
Talk to me!

1373
02:36:30,005 --> 02:36:33,907
Why doesn't he speak?
What's wrong with him?!

1374
02:36:43,285 --> 02:36:47,722
He's all right, isn't he?

1375
02:36:48,557 --> 02:36:54,587
We have only one bottle
of blood in our stocks.

1376
02:36:54,930 --> 02:36:57,797
And this blood does not
match his blood group.

1377
02:36:59,868 --> 02:37:00,960
What do we do now?

1378
02:37:01,336 --> 02:37:05,796
I'm here! Drain me of every
drop of blood!

1379
02:37:06,508 --> 02:37:09,841
But please bring my son
back to his senses!

1380
02:37:10,245 --> 02:37:13,305
There's no time
to lose, my dear!

1381
02:37:13,749 --> 02:37:17,207
Look at his face! It's
drained of all the color!

1382
02:37:18,854 --> 02:37:20,378
Follow me.

1383
02:37:26,595 --> 02:37:28,085
We can't use her blood.

1384
02:37:28,897 --> 02:37:33,061
It doesn't match
his blood group.

1385
02:37:33,468 --> 02:37:34,400
How can you say that?!

1386
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:37,002
How can't a mother's blood
match her son's?!

1387
02:37:37,472 --> 02:37:41,306
I'm his mother...
It's on my milk that...

1388
02:37:43,378 --> 02:37:44,902
No...

1389
02:37:45,347 --> 02:37:47,440
No!

1390
02:37:55,490 --> 02:37:59,927
He has not grown up
on my milk!

1391
02:38:00,596 --> 02:38:03,087
I have not been
fortunate enough!

1392
02:38:03,832 --> 02:38:06,027
He was not born
of my womb!

1393
02:38:09,404 --> 02:38:12,635
But haven't I raised him
with my tears and sweat?

1394
02:38:13,408 --> 02:38:18,175
Is it necessary for a woman
to bear the child...

1395
02:38:18,413 --> 02:38:20,142
to really consider him
as her son?!

1396
02:38:20,449 --> 02:38:23,111
Are her affection and
love worth nothing?

1397
02:38:23,518 --> 02:38:25,179
I beg of you, Kavita!

1398
02:38:25,454 --> 02:38:28,617
Save my son!
Save Bharat!

1399
02:38:29,958 --> 02:38:32,017
Please save my son!

1400
02:38:32,494 --> 02:38:34,291
Don't lose hope!

1401
02:38:34,763 --> 02:38:38,699
Everything will be all right.

1402
02:38:44,573 --> 02:38:47,599
He who has the blessings
of a mother like you...

1403
02:38:47,976 --> 02:38:51,343
is bound to be
protected by God.

1404
02:38:51,713 --> 02:38:54,307
But where will we
bring the blood from?

1405
02:38:55,817 --> 02:38:59,583
From me! From my body!

1406
02:39:01,123 --> 02:39:06,459
Take my blood, doctor...
but save my brother!

1407
02:39:07,229 --> 02:39:12,758
We may be step-brothers...
but we share the same blood!

1408
02:39:13,435 --> 02:39:16,893
Take every drop of
blood from my body...

1409
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:22,074
but save my brother!
Please save him!

1410
02:39:24,646 --> 02:39:27,774
We can use Puran's blood.

1411
02:39:31,553 --> 02:39:37,514
Mother...

1412
02:39:57,746 --> 02:39:59,270
Take him to the
operation theatre.

1413
02:39:59,648 --> 02:40:02,515
The case is even more
complicated now.

1414
02:40:09,725 --> 02:40:14,094
I don't think we must
lose any more time.

1415
02:40:14,696 --> 02:40:17,893
I don't know what to do.

1416
02:40:18,233 --> 02:40:19,359
I can understand that.

1417
02:40:22,537 --> 02:40:23,902
This is a moment
of your test.

1418
02:40:24,873 --> 02:40:29,936
You will have to control yourself
and perform the operation.

1419
02:40:30,445 --> 02:40:31,673
What?!

1420
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,672
Yes, doctor.

1421
02:40:34,316 --> 02:40:37,774
The latest reports reveal
that the poison...

1422
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:40,748
has spread to other
parts of his body.

1423
02:40:41,223 --> 02:40:43,020
His wounds have
turned gangrene.

1424
02:40:44,092 --> 02:40:46,959
If his arms are not amputated
immediately, he might...

1425
02:40:47,229 --> 02:40:48,218
No!

1426
02:40:50,665 --> 02:40:51,632
No!

1427
02:40:55,504 --> 02:41:02,637
Let the poison spread...
if it will.

1428
02:41:03,678 --> 02:41:11,050
It will only result in death;
I will merely lose my life.

1429
02:41:11,419 --> 02:41:14,081
Talk to him, mother!

1430
02:41:14,523 --> 02:41:22,658
What kind of human-beings
are you?

1431
02:41:23,098 --> 02:41:26,693
You want to severe the
arms of a soldier...

1432
02:41:27,202 --> 02:41:30,399
so he can never
carry a gun again?

1433
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:36,739
You want to severe the
arms of a farmer...

1434
02:41:37,145 --> 02:41:42,583
so he can never plough
his fields again?

1435
02:41:42,918 --> 02:41:44,613
No!

1436
02:41:44,886 --> 02:41:46,581
Puran! My brother...

1437
02:41:47,622 --> 02:41:52,525
Tell them that my arms
will never be amputated!

1438
02:41:52,861 --> 02:41:54,021
Why are you being stubborn?

1439
02:41:55,130 --> 02:41:56,654
Haven't I told you?

1440
02:41:57,365 --> 02:41:58,627
My arms will never
be amputated!

1441
02:41:59,334 --> 02:42:01,564
Never!

1442
02:42:02,470 --> 02:42:05,234
Don't be stubborn, my son!

1443
02:42:06,341 --> 02:42:07,808
I place you under
an oath, my son!

1444
02:42:08,109 --> 02:42:10,805
You are beholden
to me, my son!

1445
02:42:30,232 --> 02:42:33,201
My hands...

1446
02:42:36,638 --> 02:42:46,513
Without my hands...

1447
02:42:46,882 --> 02:42:57,520
I will never be able to
touch this sacred soil again.

1448
02:42:58,293 --> 02:43:01,091
Never will I touch this
sacred soil again!

1449
02:43:05,066 --> 02:43:05,862
Mother...

1450
02:43:07,168 --> 02:43:08,032
Mother...

1451
02:45:42,824 --> 02:45:45,918
He's out of danger. The
operation was successful.

1452
02:45:46,327 --> 02:45:48,056
You may leave now and
return tomorrow morning.

1453
02:46:11,753 --> 02:46:15,951
Didn't I tell you that
you'd be all right?

1454
02:46:17,492 --> 02:46:21,553
Where is Puran, mother?

1455
02:46:22,330 --> 02:46:23,092
I'll call him.

1456
02:47:28,129 --> 02:47:31,587
Bring your hands
closer to me...

1457
02:47:41,643 --> 02:47:45,101
Who can ever say that
I have lost my arms?

1458
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:52,413
Here they are...

1459
02:47:52,754 --> 02:47:54,745
My arms have today
been restored to me!

1460
02:47:55,690 --> 02:47:57,851
Look at this Mother!

1461
02:47:58,259 --> 02:48:00,454
I have found my arms again!
