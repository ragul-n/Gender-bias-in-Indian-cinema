1
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,360
There is no motive for psychopathic murder

2
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,110
Crime is his motive

3
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,220
Give me a kilo, too

5
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,970
Hey, hey suraj

6
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Suraj is now out of class

7
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,130
Go ahead and get the number

8
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,960
Please go

9
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,170
Or tomorrow .. go

10
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,810
Go on.

11
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,010
Hey, keep him here

12
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,150
When the class was over, my mother stopped her to pick her up

13
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,420
Okay ... go right ... go

14
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,920
Go...

15
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,800
Come on

16
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,840
Suraj

17
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,630
Saw the dance,

18
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,410
Do you practice new dance techniques?

19
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,210
Yeah, I'll train your number.

20
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,410
Let me wait

21
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,170
I'll call, okay

22
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,660
I will go

23
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,490
Give it

24
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,140
The girl is very happy

25
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,280
Not happy

26
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,730
Where is the divine?

27
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,010
Divine ... Divine ...

28
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,540
Come on,

29
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,320
Look around

30
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,270
Did you see the divine?

31
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,510
Not

32
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,500
Did you see the divine?

33
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,980
Not me

34
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,240
To him we are,

35
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,050
He was going to wait for us

36
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,210
Looking back

37
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,890
I thought I was going with friends

38
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,300
But he wasn't anywhere

39
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,470
Nobody has ever seen a divine dance class

40
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,690
Then who is this friend of Divya?

41
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,370
Does he have another friend?

42
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,100
not,

43
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,990
He was with us

44
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,550
Keerthi,

45
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,640
To what I'm about to ask you

46
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,290
You have to answer well

47
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,550
It's very important

48
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,030
Right? Hmm ...

49
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,140
Divya your friend, how long do you know?

50
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,720
His friends ..

51
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,210
Only a friend knows

52
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,680
Ritika - Sir

53
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,860
It's all upsetting

54
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,050
You have to find him

55
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,070
Tell me about this

56
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm doing my best, sir

57
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,820
Come on

58
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,800
Notify all police

59
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,860
Human trafficking, extortion, and extortion

60
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
Collect all the details from the begging mafia

61
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,760
Where is he in the next 48 hours?

62
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,030
Actually speaking, we probably won't find him alive

63
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,600
So let's hurry this up

64
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,580
Come on,

65
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,450
Got it

66
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,260
You just hit it off

67
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,960
What we found was a child's body

68
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,940
The rest of the work will begin only after the ACP's order

69
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,790
It's the worst murder in the city, 8 years,

70
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,400
It is the body of a little girl who has disappeared from the dance class

71
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,050
What about the forensic information?

72
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,550
Ma'am, on your way

73
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,410
Get out! Get out!

74
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,440
A child's body has been found today in a garbage dump

75
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,130
A team including the ACP is investigating the matter

76
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,860
Because it happened to the Divya Divakar case

77
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,820
This is a case file, sir

78
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,760
A six-year-old girl has been kidnapped

79
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,110
Killed without paying a ransom call

80
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,550
It is also the daughter of our Alander Sub-Collector Rahul Naad

81
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Here

82
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,870
This is a copy of the baby's autopsy report

83
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,260
Our Samlar sir is the autopsy

84
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,690
The death was done with a cut

85
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,360
The wound is about 12 millimeters in body

86
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,790
With a single blade weapon similar to a knife used in the kitchen

87
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,620
Shallow cut of 8 cm due to the death of blood is wrong

88
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,850
Along with that, the center's got another child's body

89
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,390
And that is Samlal Sarma who is the autopsy

90
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,930
6 year old child,

91
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,450
The cause of death

92
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
To the heart

93
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,740
10 inches deep into the grave ...

94
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,590
20mm wide

95
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,680
Unnatural assault with a single-shot weapon

96
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,690
This is the child's family background

97
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,430
I belong to a middle class family

98
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,540
But

99
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,070
Sir at the conclusion of my first test

100
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,560
Behind both murders

101
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,760
There's only one weapon

102
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,060
There is only one murderer

103
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,510
Yes sir,

104
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,940
We are looking for a very different kind of crime

105
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,320
Kalekṭar rāhulnādan entered in a case to be this

106
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,760
He also asked me to start an investigation with a group

107
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,970
not

108
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,750
You do it personally

109
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,250
But keep quiet

110
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,910
The media cannot, for any reason, make this point

111
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,970
Sir, of course

112
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,480
I can try to keep it quiet

113
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,640
But the information in this case is already socialized

114
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,610
But we know about this relationship

115
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,940
No reporter knows

116
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,060
If you find it

117
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,570
That's the main news on every channel

118
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,420
That the city of Trivandrum is murderous

119
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,410
There's something else, sir. - Yes

120
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,800
I am in court

121
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,650
My team needs a full-time member

122
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,050
Look at Ritika

123
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,380
Because this is an unofficial investigation,

124
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,500
If there were eight judicial officers

125
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,280
This province cannot control this case

126
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,510
I can only put one case on you

127
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,900
But .. You don't know if you like him too much

128
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,600
Our legal counsel

129
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,870
Samuel John Kartuca

130
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,180
My wife and I had dinner while leaving the office

131
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,520
While trying to go to bed at night, someone entered the house

132
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,290
To my wife's head

133
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,880
That guy hit a hit

134
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,450
Someone with a mask

135
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,150
I tried a lot to stop it

136
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,440
I tried to stop him

137
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,520
But then he hit my head against the wall

138
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,790
I fainted

139
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,760
When she was unconscious, she was lying on the floor

140
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,830
All the valuables of the house were stolen

141
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,230
Then this is my mouthpiece

142
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,380
Sir's wife has lodged a complaint with Sir before

143
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,800
In the case of domestic violence

144
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,620
I don't need to say,

145
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,140
It is known

146
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,200
But this,

147
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,980
Sir, we have not received any evidence

148
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,340
Do you oppose me?

149
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,530
Either ..

150
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,550
You are my interrogation

151
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,670
I'll do as I say

152
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,200
or

153
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,700
Tell me this

154
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,020
Just a little bit of evidence

155
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,430
Not both,

156
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,700
Stop this questioning here

157
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,170
I am,

158
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,860
Your top officer

159
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,990
You're an officer under me

160
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,820
Great

161
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,100
Should we do what he says, sir?

162
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,300
Bring a doctor,

163
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,480
Check his condition,

164
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,810
Sir, interrogate him, sir

165
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,730
Makers Randolph is done a by-pass to be done is high

166
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,530
A heart patient

167
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,700
When we make an application for charges

168
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,190
That its lawyers are physically weak

169
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,310
Takes a doctor's certificate and presents it to the court

170
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
that is all

171
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,570
I don't think it will

172
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,010
Sam,

173
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,100
You haven't gone to work yet?

174
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,470
I got bored and took a look at an old case file

175
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,170
Come back soon

176
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,140
Sir, you have to ask a few questions

177
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,100
Listen

178
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,190
Is this a pacemaker or an ICD?

179
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,900
ICD ..

180
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,580
Wait, sir

181
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,490
Where does this transplant,

182
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,490
From DC Hospital

183
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,450
Sir .. hmm ..

184
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,010
Sir, what can we do with the situation ?

185
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,050
Sir she has her own device for detecting sir's lies

186
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,050
Sir's heartbeat may have been recorded in this pacemaker

187
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,970
Sir's heartbeat at the time of the murder

188
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,370
Unusually scary

189
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,910
That's when a serious murderer commits a crime

190
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,980
Check for the heartbeat pattern

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,050
Then you will know

192
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,230
SP's statement was false

193
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
Drink now, sir?

194
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,520
Hello Rajiv sir

195
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,160
All right

196
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,790
I'll definitely come, sir.

197
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,710
All right

198
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,160
Sir, who is the officer in charge of the investigation?

199
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,620
Nikanmayi always come do not bring anything

200
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,970
It's not really a habit

201
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,650
Looks like you haven't given up on old age

202
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,170
They won't change

203
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,520
Nothing was done to change that

204
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,880
She'll give him enough to get home from school .

205
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,510
What are you doing now

206
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,290
No headquarters duties from tomorrow

207
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
Got a new case

208
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,470
Where is Xavier?

209
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,470
He's still cooking in his program

210
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,650
This section is our special presentation

211
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,220
For the traditional taste ...

212
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,710
Meat, tomatoes, onions,

213
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,790
The whole collection is made of this

214
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,060
It's really delicious,

215
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,490
Xavier. A jar

216
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,290
My work's not over

217
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,870
This is practically the time when people are looking more and more

218
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,690
Dad ... Dad ...

219
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,220
Xavier. Yeah

220
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,540
Giving you ... there's more

221
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,800
It's not,

222
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,600
Give him something to say

223
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,320
Hold it

224
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,030
All right

225
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,690
I've solved a case of a previous murder

226
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,050
Yes,

227
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,060
I have more ..

228
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,440
I got an appointment for an autopsy

229
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,000
Along with that ...

230
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,970
What's the matter?

231
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,160
Who knows the head of the group?

232
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,250
Who is

233
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,650
Ritika Xavier IPS

234
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,870
Thanks Teacher,

235
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,230
Did Daniel tell him?

236
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,610
Still questioning, madam, let's see,

237
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,970
Like Samuel Kattukaran

238
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,800
Legal Consultant

239
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,040
Hmm

240
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,950
A recommendation from the Commissioner

241
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,870
we will see,

242
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,290
I am a Judicial Judge

243
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,060
Someone asked

244
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,360
Let's see

245
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,150
Samuel has two things,

246
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,830
one..

247
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm the investigating officer in this case,

248
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,590
And you are my legal counsel

249
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,750
That's your part

250
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,570
No need to head for anything else

251
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,600
Then two,

252
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,620
You need to arrive early for a meeting, right?

253
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,510
All right

254
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,120
Go

255
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,590
When the leopard disappeared

256
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,340
Belongs to the parents who came to pick up the children,

257
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,390
There were like nine cars

258
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,140
The only way to get to the vehicles is from here

259
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,780
Get out of this main gate and onto the road

260
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,190
Yes

261
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,640
Yes ma'am

262
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,890
Did it take a scene?

263
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,650
There is no need for it, madam

264
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,010
Divya was abducted, not in a car

265
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,120
According to the autopsy report, samples of the leopard's body were found

266
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,150
The pieces of rust are some kind of iron balance

267
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,380
And something like a white stamen

268
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,010
And these are the scars of discarded water, like mud

269
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,510
At the same time he had some rust marks on his salwar

270
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,800
Those rust marks were on the right side of the salwar

271
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,040
There's no mud on this side

272
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,330
This path must have taken the divine

273
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,020
All right

274
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,650
Something like the white stamens we got from Divya's body

275
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,400
It was said that there was something like clay in the clothes

276
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,070
It could be from this

277
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,720
The muddy scars in Divya's clothes,

278
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,000
They must have been made of this

279
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,400
Look at that,

280
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,300
This is where the divine has been abducted

281
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,380
Yes,

282
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,610
Why don't you call?

283
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,230
Do you know how many calls?

284
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,550
for me? Hmm ...

285
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,190
Hello

286
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,530
Sam, what the hell are you doing?

287
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,620
Mum I was in the lab,

288
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,630
Go to Westmore Hospital today and get the letter from the psychiatrist.

289
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,830
Then something else

290
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,870
Another member joins the group

291
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,230
He'll work with you, as usual

292
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,430
Give him the phone

293
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,560
All right, madam

294
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,950
Hello,

295
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,940
Yes Zika ... write down my number

296
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,060
Definitely madam

297
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,510
Ma'am, I'll write you down

298
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes, say it, madam

299
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,460
My land number

300
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,050
Write ... - All right

301
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,040
You know the reason you were appointed

302
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,860
Ok ma'am

303
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,870
The medical consultant Sam's always on the alert

304
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,930
That's the main reason you're on this team

305
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,680
Sam's day-to-day operations I want to call the number I just gave you

306
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,010
You have to do this very secretly,

307
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,530
Mum, the phone's on the speaker

308
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,290
What

309
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,290
You really, ...

310
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,080
Call me Modi,

311
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,530
A spy

312
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, really ...

313
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,870
Not a department vehicle

314
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,880
Don't wear a seatbelt?

315
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,250
Don't mind

316
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,730
The airbag will not open if there is an accident in the seat belt

317
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,620
Do you know?

318
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,600
know that

319
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,810
Where are you going?

320
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,290
I'm going to see a psychiatrist

321
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,790
Where's Mr. Sam going?

322
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,720
Sorry

323
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,710
What's in Dr. Alfons' room?

324
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,410
Thank you. Okay

325
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,250
Wait

326
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,010
The judicial section, right?

327
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,840
Yes,

328
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,920
Sit down ... Sit down ...

329
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,300
Ritika said to me

330
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,570
Say,

331
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,910
For Keerthi's report,

332
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,720
It needs a doctor's letter

333
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,760
The police need all the evidence

334
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,920
There must have been reports of the child's condition

335
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,130
See, Rithika's interrogation

336
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,530
Keerthi's time was about two hours

337
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,020
Except he loses

338
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,710
His mental condition is perfectly fine

339
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,940
All right

340
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,940
Then the letter from the doctor who wrote about Keerthi's condition

341
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,550
Absolutely

342
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,900
I'll give you this case information.

343
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,790
I'll get it

344
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,810
Hello

345
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,880
Divya's case is asking for information

346
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,920
Don't send WhatsApp, I'll write

347
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,680
Tell me

348
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,400
Okay. Wait a second

349
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,510
Don't say that

350
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,470
All right

351
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,400
The marker has althylene

352
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,100
Acids in coffee ...

353
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,540
If you wash it with acid, you can erase the aldehydes

354
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
Taught in school,

355
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,450
Right?

356
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,660
Here,

357
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,500
Thank you

358
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,730
Isn't that what the name said?

359
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,330
SAMUEL JOHN COURT

360
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,070
The scoundrel is our Ibrahim sir,

361
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,010
Grandson ...

362
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Xavier John's little

363
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,800
May I come, then?

364
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,050
All right

365
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,920
All right

366
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,870
Okay. Thank you

367
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,160
come here

368
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,450
Be nice

369
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,870
Just smile

370
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,400
Daughter.

371
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,230
Give me one, too.

372
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,240
In my opinion,

373
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,490
Because the media is paying so much attention to this case

374
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,250
The killer keeps on abducting

375
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,330
That is,

376
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:27,200
Somehow we have to stop the next incident

377
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,790
This is the main reason why Divya's murder received so much media attention

378
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,350
The company owns garbage on the site ...

379
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,900
Because the body was brought to an open place

380
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,080
So it is difficult to control the spread or spread of it

381
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,670
And with our resources,

382
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,290
This is what's missing from Amusement Park

383
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,670
Now that's our lead

384
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,910
I'm looking into it, sir

385
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,400
All right

386
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,730
You come with me

387
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,840
They were specifically asked to come at 8.00

388
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,050
It's not,

389
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,580
This here,

390
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,440
Did Madam see this?

391
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,860
It's a better place to put your body

392
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,120
Up that garbage dump,

393
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,970
So why didn't the killer do it,

394
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,660
Where the body was found,

395
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,690
The height of that concrete wall with dirt

396
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,470
At least six feet, right?

397
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,590
So,

398
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,620
You're right

399
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,130
6 feet above this wall,

400
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,080
The killer does not have the physical strength to turn his body

401
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,300
Just think,

402
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,470
It was the children of Divya's dancing,

403
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,990
Security at the Water Think Park,

404
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,720
There is no evidence in any of these cases

405
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,330
When the kidnapping happens,

406
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,380
Even so, the killer was abducted

407
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,580
How?

408
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,720
These mud markings in Divya's asthma

409
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,790
Take ran side by side can be progressed gǣvunā

410
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,260
That's why it's so bad

411
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,410
And

412
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,620
In the little lane from the dance class

413
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,110
The wall is 4 feet up,

414
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,280
That is,

415
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,970
A man who cannot move his body beyond the six-foot-tall wall

416
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,770
Only children continue to be abducted

417
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,020
This murderer we're looking for,

418
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,360
Behind these crimes

419
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,290
There's a kid

420
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,900
Look, Sam, I told you this before,

421
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,920
Government salary,

422
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,630
If there is such a qualified police force to investigate

423
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,190
Don't try to solve the Indian case by watching Hollywood movies

424
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,330
There was a boy named Madam Amarajith Sara

425
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,410
But there is no age limit for the perpetrators, ma'am

426
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,220
This is him

427
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,790
Amarajith Sara

428
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,870
He is the youngest person in the world arrested for a serial murder

429
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,570
He was 8 years old

430
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,620
This guy who studied with him had three people close by

431
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,550
The head was cut off and killed

432
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,770
It's not Europe or America, madam

433
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,560
This is our India

434
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,930
In Bihar

435
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,170
He's not the only one

436
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,440
Mary Bell,

437
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
Robert Thomas twins

438
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,390
10, 12 .. have been child murderers at the ages

439
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,690
Prisons are everywhere in the world

440
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,170
Children are definitely capable of committing serious crimes

441
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,820
That's why Madam has a separate rule for us

442
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,720
All right, Sam

443
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,640
That's enough,

444
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,770
Read nonsense,

445
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,690
A jungle theory that can't even be imagined

446
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,540
Do you and your family pull down the theories?

447
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,000
Have you known him before?

448
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,340
Hmm,

449
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,050
Brother's wife ...

450
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,190
On the way back out of the academy

451
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,080
My brother, Ritika Madam's got married

452
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,340
Just like Rhithika didn't have a problem with her job

453
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,460
They had no other problems

454
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,370
They had one more child,

455
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
Because of Rithika's infamy

456
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,180
The boy's gone

457
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,750
Then they got into trouble

458
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,110
Last Randu .. Family Court ... Divorce

459
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,680
Seven years now,

460
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,300
After that, Ritika is no longer in the family again

461
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,250
Sam,

462
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,190
This is Abdul Wakhab sir

463
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,740
Hello .. Retired FB Cecid

464
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,970
Sir has some DNA samples

465
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,970
We've taken samples from a nearby case

466
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,760
Sam needs to check those two out

467
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,980
Absolutely

468
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,940
This

469
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,680
Whose DNA is it, sir?

470
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,400
This is from the cases we received while in the crime branch

471
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,550
The only evidence from a case that has not been resolved

472
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,810
Ritika's

473
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,790
The first case of the profession,

474
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
I did tests before retirement last case that

475
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,110
It’s like early 2013

476
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,970
At Burma Colony outside Thiruvananthapuram

477
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,800
And they found them when they were killed

478
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,320
The nature of the wounds on the bodies of these victims

479
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,330
The killer's killing pattern,

480
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,930
These are the serial killer's we,

481
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,960
They found a pattern of prey

482
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,510
The killer based on that,

483
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,510
Then we find out where the kidnapping takes place

484
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,990
In search of the roads in this Burma colony,

485
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,770
Out of a school van parked outside,

486
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,020
The driver of that school van was arrested

487
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,720
Here he is,

488
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,100
Ubedan Ahmed,

489
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,020
That he caught the cereal murderer in Burma Colony

490
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,430
In the newspapers

491
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,370
Channels have been published

492
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,270
Ubedan is still in prison

493
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,150
That's the pattern of injuries

494
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,400
It's the same pattern of victimization

495
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,310
Not even the police

496
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,110
That's the highlight of it

497
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,400
This fifth victim's nails were inside

498
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,260
We got a blood sample

499
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,940
The killer's,

500
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,650
A sample that matches the DNA of the blood in the clothes of the first and second victims

501
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,390
It didn't match Ubuden's DNA in prison

502
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,190
Another unidentified person has committed the murder

503
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,850
But finally

504
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,370
We couldn't solve it

505
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,790
But the message is very clear

506
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,300
We got one loser

507
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,760
So I stored the murderer's DNA in my possession

508
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,830
I've done hundreds of DNA tests

509
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,720
But,

510
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,150
No matter how hard I try

511
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,930
I couldn't find that killer

512
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,820
Here

513
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,080
Ubeydan Ahmed

514
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,250
While in prison, this too was destroyed

515
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,350
After my retirement, I kept mine

516
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,680
This is our life, Sam

517
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,470
That is what confuses us on the one hand

518
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,200
On the other hand we have to solve for ourselves

519
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,370
Ma'am, this guy lives on this side

520
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,260
He works at a factory called Sport

521
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,960
They have entered the factory without anybody

522
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,220
I saw an incident there

523
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,370
Fun tells Madam what you've seen

524
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,650
He is.

525
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,760
Do you know or know?

526
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,580
Madam,

527
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,780
Because the night of the event

528
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,380
I didn't see that face, ma'am

529
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,400
But ..

530
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,690
He's not a big man,

531
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,970
He's a 10 to 15 year old kid, madam

532
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,900
Is the police trying to cover up this as a kid?

533
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,580
Is this a story told by the police?

534
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,260
If you see the guy in this photo somewhere

535
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,820
Call our police emergency and inform

536
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,750
When the press conference is over, we will give a copy of this to every channel

537
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,570
All right

538
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,710
Thanks Daniel, it's over

539
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,930
Murali - Yes madam

540
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,120
Send it everywhere

541
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,050
Send this to all the channels, - Okay madam

542
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,220
Each patrol was sent to Madam polakaṭama - right

543
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,820
- Sam

544
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,050
In my situation, I was a little hasty,

545
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,870
But this case was solved today because of Sam's jungle theory

546
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,760
It belongs to you

547
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,830
What are you doing here?

548
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,470
There's Alfons sir's class today, right?

549
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,370
It's 1.00 now is the break

550
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,640
Yes, .. come on then

551
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,530
I'll show you someone

552
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,450
Tell me ...

553
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,770
Where's he cutting meat?

554
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,770
Say hi to dad

555
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,870
Hi

556
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,860
Hi there

557
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:22,930
How are you?

558
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:24,680
What are you doing today?

559
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,750
Lamb .. Lamb ..

560
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,190
A tasty meal

561
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,460
A tasty meal

562
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,430
Daughter,

563
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,320
I haven't forgotten my daughter's father

564
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,140
Don't visit dad?

565
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,430
Hello,

566
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,610
Yes, Doctor

567
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,940
I'll be right back

568
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,540
Daughter is not angry

569
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,460
His mother's very angry,

570
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,730
Doctor, can I come?

571
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,480
Come on, yes

572
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,470
I'm not asking Ritika to come by me if that's not important - all right

573
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,680
Got any info on the sketch released today ?

574
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,940
No ... not yet

575
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,470
Upon first seeing the sketch

576
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,540
It's a boy who came with Jubileus for counsel

577
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,520
The name is Reuben Elias

578
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,080
He's gone now

579
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,320
Looking at her case,

580
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,680
Dr. Jayaraman, Clinical Therapist

581
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,150
He's on vacation now

582
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,150
A few years ago

583
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,730
I was handed a student case

584
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:52,860
Where the kids were playing together,

585
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,480
Two of his friends were severely injured

586
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,990
Then this kid was 8 years old

587
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,350
I remember well the day I saw her for the first time

588
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,940
He looked so innocent to me

589
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,010
I still can't forget

590
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:09,080
Somehow I started the therapy process

591
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,160
With a lot of time and effort

592
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,900
I was very close to him

593
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,960
I continued to do so

594
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,220
Get him under my watch

595
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,630
About a year

596
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,720
He was rescued by my side

597
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,810
But one day ..

598
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,250
It's all changed

599
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,710
Rubin ...

600
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,120
Who hadn't felt that many years ...

601
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,470
The fierceness in his eyes

602
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,110
I saw it again

603
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,620
Rubin ...

604
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,530
Rubin ...

605
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,550
That was the last time I saw him

606
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,310
I've been looking for Rubin's safe for so long

607
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,480
Until I hear about this,

608
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,730
Sam,

609
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,300
Get your child killed

610
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,490
This is enough

611
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,240
His name and details are all in our hands

612
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,310
Now I think this should be allowed in time

613
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,290
For a little boy to be alone without any help

614
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,020
You can't hide from such a large police force

615
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,320
How's your mother?

616
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,660
Can't say anything yet

617
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,710
Is now in the ICU

618
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,950
You come. All right

619
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,110
Come on, wait here

620
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,310
Mummy will be back soon

621
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,800
Don't go anywhere, all right

622
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,440
Transferred to ward today

623
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,690
If you do ...

624
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,690
Daughter.

625
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,270
Malavika Das ... 6 years

626
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,170
The last time I saw this kid was

627
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,010
The place is now under our protection

628
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,830
While the child is in the waiting room

629
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,760
Mom, the kid disappeared while attending the ICU

630
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,390
A chocolate from the coffee counter at the hospital, Malavika sir

631
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,460
Missing at 10.15, yeah

632
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,180
Then we ..

633
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,110
I found a chocolate with a stick at the Wesmar Hospital

634
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,170
Isn't that SP Ajayakal?

635
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,690
They can do whatever they want with the money

636
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,780
We have to do our job

637
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,710
Isn't that the bill he got? Yes, sir

638
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,590
With a boy, yes,

639
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,580
Stay with him

640
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,540
He was wearing hair

641
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,820
Yeah, it was like that

642
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,200
The evidence matches that crime

643
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,580
Madam I have the same doubt

644
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,700
This is a piece of chocolate from the counter,

645
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,580
Cokalṭ bākōḍ one scan to the sense that

646
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,050
She took the bill

647
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,550
Malavika has also taken a packet of chocolate

648
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,410
And then the guy at the counter ..

649
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,190
Malavika confirms she's seen with Ruben

650
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,350
Ma'am, there's nothing to think ... from the place where the chocolate was given

651
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,640
Until Malavika's abduction,

652
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,330
Reuben himself is quite clear that this is done

653
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,250
Sir ...

654
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,440
Leaving that chocolate,

655
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,520
You can lead us astray

656
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,940
What are you saying, Sam?

657
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,630
Didn't find that chocolate in the trash?

658
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,470
With my experience so far,

659
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,510
Any bill or ticket

660
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,760
see,

661
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,440
There are only a few fresh roads

662
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,250
Put it in your pocket,

663
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,080
It's done throw trash basket dānakoṭa 's not like this little

664
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:37,500
This child has disappeared

665
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,830
Only at 10am

666
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,150
A lot of people might just walk away

667
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,230
No one's going to throw it in the trash

668
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
Even if there was such a bill,

669
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,760
It's mixed with other garbage

670
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,740
This is the obvious thing

671
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,400
Take it out of the hand and put it in the trash

672
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,510
This is chocolate

673
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,620
There is nothing dirty

674
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,610
What does it mean

675
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,650
What's Sam's idea?

676
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,040
Malavika's abduction at a different time,

677
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,330
This chocolate,

678
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,330
That means we got this chocolate from the trash can at the front gate

679
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,180
He's not hiding who he is

680
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,990
That proves this

681
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:19,580
Malavika's abduction

682
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,360
What are you saying

683
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,940
By 2:00 pm the province was in the police

684
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,950
Hello,

685
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,650
Does that mean Reuben brought the chocolate and left it?

686
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,640
Of course,

687
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:30,710
Meeting with the Commissioner,

688
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,440
This is about it, come on, let's go

689
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,580
What Damien said was true

690
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,370
what?

691
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,960
Whoever touches the chocolate buries his fingerprints

692
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,650
As distinguished from the machine

693
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,050
There is evidence that two people have this

694
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,450
Malavika, touching one side of this cover,

695
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,150
And the one who brought this,

696
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,940
But his plan is to mislead the police

697
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,750
Leaving that,

698
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,830
It has

699
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,170
The reason is this chocolate covered surface

700
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,030
There are 5 - 7 mm size cotton pieces

701
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,960
He might be using a glove

702
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,750
If so, his fingerprints wo n't be covered in chocolate

703
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,940
Bringing in a glove means he's trying to ruin his fingerprints

704
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,600
But it's not that hard to find in the forensics department

705
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,690
It's a cotton glove,

706
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,580
It should be stored in his skin

707
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,540
It must be DNA

708
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,050
Get that device

709
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,270
All right

710
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:03,920
What kind of device is this for the labs?

711
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,630
What's going on,

712
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:06,570
Yes,

713
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,670
This is a device that can be used to extract DNA

714
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,870
Phonasic Vacuum Palm

715
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,130
When we touch our clothes and weapons,

716
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:17,240
The cells of our skin are deposited in the body

717
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:21,880
So we can use this tool to distinguish it completely

718
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,120
It touches the surface and contains the DNA of the one who touched it

719
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Yes, ma'am

720
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,460
All right, madam

721
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,090
Sam ..

722
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,440
All right

723
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,630
These are the DNA samples from the chocolate

724
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,890
This is the DNA of Malavika from a piece of chocolate

725
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:34,640
This is the DNA from the old asthma from the Jubilee Home

726
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,580
The DNA of the person who touched the chocolate leaf

727
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,150
Let's see if this fits in,

728
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,570
The second time the chocolate hit,

729
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,930
Not the series,

730
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,120
Not Reuben

731
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,220
There is an unidentified third

732
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,520
Now we need to forget about Reuben

733
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,190
We need to find out now ...

734
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,770
A killer,

735
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,670
We're in front of Wesmos Hospital now

736
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,840
Unable to find a kid,

737
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:24,570
When the police can't solve it

738
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,380
The girl, who is publicly known as Malavika Das, has disappeared

739
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,810
With this case in charge,

740
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,020
About Ritika Xavier,

741
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,870
There are accusations that they cannot be trusted

742
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,700
Ma'am, the people are getting upset

743
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,570
Looking to protect their children

744
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,560
The parents of Den Lennie's school

745
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:48,130
I am against sending children in school vans

746
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:50,880
We have to get Reuben anyway

747
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,440
Yes Sam,

748
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,120
Mam, we got some clear evidence

749
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,980
Lenny, get out of there

750
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:15,690
not,

751
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,730
This investigation has resolved,

752
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,410
Don't make it worse

753
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:24,160
The investigation team's goal is to capture Reuben Elias

754
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,910
That's just it

755
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:27,990
All right ma'am

756
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,370
Sam,

757
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,880
Forget about chocolate

758
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,420
Indirectly saying that the judiciary does not need help,

759
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,030
Come on some labs

760
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,670
Duwa Nayani ...

761
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,380
Sample the samples again

762
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,190
I've checked this three times,

763
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:26,300
Sam's DNA and DNA from Wahab Sir Burma's killer's bow samples

764
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,780
Fits exactly,

765
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,030
Sir,

766
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,430
DNA from Malavika's chocolate leaf

767
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,320
Sir has DNA

768
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,130
Fits exactly,

769
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,200
It's the same thing

770
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,650
Even the murderers of the Burma murders 10 years ago

771
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:51,310
Even the murderers behind the murder of children in this city

772
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,600
One

773
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:10,460
Is this what you guys Burmah murderers bodies'll place

774
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,490
Hmm .. Ararikum,

775
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,580
Niserville

776
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:23,690
We got the bodies of three children right here

777
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,790
He had been stabbed to death with a weapon

778
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:56,830
Coming from the city to such a great environment,

779
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:00,280
The killer's bringing bodies to such an open space

780
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:06,560
While investigating the sir's police team in those days

781
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,240
Not as much going into the interior

782
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,030
So, naturally, their signs are gone

783
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,020
the truth

784
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:20,030
Contact a pipe company and tell them to bring an underground search tool

785
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:20,810
Hmm

786
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,080
Let's find the story on this lake

787
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:42,850
Yes ma'am

788
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,220
Hello Zika

789
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,930
How did I get you to work?

790
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,130
What kind of information

791
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,620
Madame Sam is trying to compare the child's autopsy

792
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,320
All right

793
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:54,230
Recently, I went to Shika Karyakulam with Sam

794
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,400
Hello,

795
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,170
Mam, we went on a little trip

796
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,430
See your personal belongings on vacation

797
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,350
Send me those reports when they're done

798
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,990
Definitely, right

799
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,390
Who's talking?

800
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,050
It's a personal call

801
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,140
Ritika Xavier

802
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,070
Tanuma Murali Mohan Kumar

803
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,240
What's this, Sam?

804
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,950
So far in this case, there is nothing we can do

805
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,530
We have to try

806
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,740
But we need help from Wagab and Alfonsu

807
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,540
The day Malavika's abduction took place

808
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,460
Vesmōr hospital CCTV camera had been recording

809
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,900
Here is a list of people who came along with the police

810
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,000
One name from this list,

811
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,090
The name of the murderer we're looking for

812
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,170
So

813
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:45,030
All of the DNA here is assembled

814
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,970
Must match the killer's samples

815
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,810
There are 60 to 70 names on this list

816
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,560
Does the murderer, whoever he is, give us samples of DNA?

817
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:55,340
not

818
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,380
So we have to collect samples without them knowing

819
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,790
Half of the list included samples of myself and Shikai

820
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:07,180
Wahhab sir collects the rest of his DNA

821
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:11,340
Alphonse's Doctor Wellsmore Hospital

822
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,710
Absolutely

823
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:15,280
The chocolate leaf is the killer's DNA

824
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,270
All you need to do is mix it up

825
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,040
Along with us

826
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:20,530
There is no shortage

827
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,640
Shika,

828
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:32,110
Now we need to collect samples of the remaining ones on this list

829
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:34,960
Until the killer's DNA is found,

830
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,670
What happened?

831
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,090
The last group checks

832
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:26,110
There's no match

833
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:45,830
Sam,

834
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,380
one minute...

835
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,630
Given by an anonymous person

836
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:02,240
In a raid by Cbcid a few moments ago

837
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:09,790
ACP Ritika Xavier has just arrived

838
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:13,350
The media has not yet been allowed to cover it

839
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,670
Ruben

840
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,300
The Devil has done his job.

841
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,780
I am,

842
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,500
He made a confession

843
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,020
Because all of a sudden,

844
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,590
Check out that video of the boy confessing

845
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,720
Look at it a little better

846
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,670
You killed them, right, Reuben

847
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,170
He's heading

848
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,810
Ruben's ears are weak

849
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,100
That's why he has a listening device

850
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,990
Now, what if the hearing aids

851
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,080
A standard Bluetooth headset from Marg

852
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:29,950
That is

853
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,650
This is what I mean

854
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,430
You can send a voice message using a cell phone

855
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,760
Malavika was abducted from the hospital

856
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,380
Take it from there

857
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,040
Reuben can't do it alone

858
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,610
Who controls him,

859
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:53,840
Someone's on his back

860
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,000
He's the devil's voice speaking inside his head

861
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,310
You need to find out who he is

862
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:15,780
He took everything he had with him to prison

863
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:16,780
Except for one

864
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:18,150
His listening device,

865
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,960
Rubin

866
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,760
You just did what I told you to do

867
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,510
This is Rubin, the last duty I will give you

868
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,490
That listening device is in his ear

869
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,670
He can control him

870
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:46,020
It's late, Rubin

871
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,320
Hurry Up

872
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,250
Hurry Up

873
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,110
Hurry Up

874
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:56,950
Rubin.

875
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,620
Sir we have no problem taking care of him

876
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,780
There is no sound

877
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,770
Sir I took Rubin's medical report

878
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,450
I had no intention of running into it

879
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,610
This is not something you should think about

880
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:15,840
see

881
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,280
I told you this case when I gave it to you

882
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,540
No media, don't be a leak,

883
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,240
What happened now?

884
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,210
Now it's gone from Sub-Collector to DGP

885
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,560
Reuben is your responsibility

886
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,190
There will be an internal investigation into the matter in a separate group

887
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,210
It's not in my hands right now

888
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,440
Sam,

889
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,670
What?

890
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,050
Investigate,

891
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,390
Shika , this case is going to get out of our hands

892
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,530
Let me do one thing

893
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:55,640
Remote Bluetooth device

894
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:57,680
It controls Reuben's listening device

895
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,790
Reuben's run out

896
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,410
Find out who was around

897
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,270
Check the CCTVs near you

898
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,260
On the way there, the men's vehicles. Sam

899
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,320
Where's madam, Nayani?

900
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,420
What is he here?

901
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,030
It must have been Mother

902
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,870
I think the kid may have remembered Mom

903
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,160
Come on

904
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,720
Look at that,

905
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:33,680
Madam ...

906
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,770
Madam ...

907
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,850
What's he here?

908
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,550
Cousiller is on leave

909
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,490
Go home for his urgent work

910
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,170
It's also this time

911
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:53,650
Madam,

912
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,470
I'll take him to our house for two days

913
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,380
No, that doesn't work

914
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:04,960
Madam ...

915
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,090
When I join this group

916
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,810
Even after all these years, I still call myself an idiot

917
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:19,420
But now he wants to think about it

918
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,330
He'll make a difference,

919
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,380
At least until the end of the investigation

920
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,090
For me or for

921
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,320
Here's our fish curry

922
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,570
Ready the fish

923
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:15,960
The daughter likes it

924
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,240
Do you have to divide?

925
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,940
Wait, wait

926
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,260
Don't we

927
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,990
There's everything

928
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,050
Here ...

929
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,040
Daughter,

930
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,020
Shall we go to bed now

931
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,060
Where ... Get up

932
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,630
Daughter,

933
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,970
Get up, daughter

934
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,730
Come on, let's go to bed

935
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:49,980
Get up early

936
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,390
Good night ... good night

937
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:56,680
Come on, come on

938
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,350
Tomorrow's program is fully planned

939
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,700
Tomorrow we're all going out

940
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,240
Park, shopping, movies .. Walking everywhere

941
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,130
How long did it take

942
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,550
Not seeing them

943
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:16,560
This is exactly how I was when I left home with Ritika's daughter

944
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,540
I don't understand

945
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,940
I feel like I've lost my life

946
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:25,990
I left the office and started making these youtube programs

947
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:29,070
These two days,

948
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,900
It must be two unforgettable days of his life

949
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,420
These days should be the best days of his life

950
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,720
Come back soon

951
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:48,640
Hello shika

952
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,770
Hello Sam

953
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,350
Sam's got the footage,

954
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,100
From the Reuben cell,

955
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,010
A short distance away from suspicious vehicle and seemed

956
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:59,780
It is that time of death is the nearest apartment

957
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,250
Driver, a plate is clearly not visible

958
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,920
It's an old blue Honda Civic car

959
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,520
Hello ...

960
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,450
Hello sam ...

961
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,350
Zika I'll get after you , okay

962
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,720
Sir what's the matter?

963
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,790
Who kidnapped our Dano sir's daughter

964
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,650
When is the school bus arriving at 8:00 am?

965
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,030
How is your wife

966
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,780
We'll find him to be brave

967
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,920
The whole team's with you, hello.

968
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,850
We'll look into that,

969
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,370
Yeah, well,

970
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,030
Mam, yes,

971
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,490
If it is phone school has taken

972
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,780
He's given the phone after warning

973
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,000
All right

974
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,730
But these days the boy's school bag was brought back,

975
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:37,210
That means we need to trace the GPS. Come on, come on

976
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,630
Did you wake up

977
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,200
John is biting,

978
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,340
You will not stop following me

979
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,490
That's why

980
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:50,800
Here today,

981
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:14,990
You know him, right?

982
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,780
This is what it did,

983
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,810
The four missing girls were killed

984
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,200
Now ...

985
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,670
You,

986
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,690
There is a place called Kalair Wildlife,

987
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,670
Five kilometers from here

988
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,360
Wesmore is a mental hospital

989
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:35,570
You are Rita's daughter

990
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:38,380
It's the same place that has been doing coworking for years

991
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,630
By the time he gets here,

992
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:42,640
This is murder,

993
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,900
Is that true?

994
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:53,630
Do you or your family show anything strange?

995
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:54,730
The new ...

996
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,820
Novelty Xavier ...

997
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:17,730
the name...

998
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,380
The new ...

999
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,170
Rithika thinks he's dead now

1000
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,700
He was in the video you just saw

1001
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,780
It's the same family

1002
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,930
It is the workforce

1003
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,090
I had my doubts,

1004
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:35,850
Rubber is not a child killer

1005
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:38,490
Rithika's daughter

1006
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:39,780
This is proof of that ...

1007
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,530
Someone who's lost

1008
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,710
Towards a ruthless killer,

1009
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,380
My family is my dream

1010
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:00,120
All lost

1011
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,950
And that's all it takes,

1012
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:06,490
His kid who knows nothing should be a terrible murderer

1013
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:12,690
You don't have to

1014
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,530
Where's Nava?

1015
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:34,260
If I die,

1016
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:37,460
Ritika does not know about her daughter

1017
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,590
I won't kill you.

1018
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,750
I'll let you know,

1019
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,490
Tell me ...

1020
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,820
Because the average person has so many cases ..

1021
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:54,780
You won't know the truth ...

1022
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,950
Sam ...

1023
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,210
The river ...

1024
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:39,680
Daughter.

1025
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:51,690
Hold on

1026
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,410
The car and the driver took over the police

1027
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,170
Stop him, hurry up

1028
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,600
Like we lost him

1029
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:01,980
Block all roads in this province

1030
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,090
It's a yellow DHI vehicle to catch him

1031
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,140
Two days later ...

1032
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:54,670
Where's Ben?

1033
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,290
Where do you want to get from here?

1034
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,860
Yes yes, love ..

1035
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:25,990
Sam,

1036
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,800
The lawyer said that there is hope for bail

1037
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:33,710
But you can't make it here

1038
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:36,900
Better to be there than stay here,

1039
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:54,330
Come on,

1040
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,880
Because Wahab sir suddenly asked,

1041
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,920
I'm actually at the commissioner's office

1042
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:01,950
Sam,

1043
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,040
Sir what is he here?

1044
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,710
The whole police are looking for him

1045
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,090
A little bit of what she says

1046
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:25,160
But I ...

1047
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,850
He can't be this

1048
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,830
This isn't him,

1049
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,100
This video is a fake

1050
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,600
not,

1051
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,360
The video is real,

1052
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:33,480
But the girl in it,

1053
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,770
Not Nayani ...

1054
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,020
The new ...

1055
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:43,980
the name...

1056
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:45,540
The new ...

1057
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,280
We don't know where Navya is now

1058
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:00,250
Video taken from Ubuden's cell phone,

1059
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,680
Novena has a 2014 newspaper

1060
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:06,010
That night Ubudan disappeared,

1061
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,250
Where he was,

1062
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:09,120
According to the tagging I put on that phone,

1063
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,030
Show that within these 10 meters,

1064
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,520
There is an opportunity for our child

1065
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,000
So,

1066
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,560
That's where we need to look

1067
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,740
No more time to waste,

1068
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:24,450
By now the murderer may have known that I had taken Ubuden's cell phone

1069
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:26,760
The police also found Ubedan's body

1070
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:28,750
Navya's life could be in danger

1071
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,400
We'll go now

1072
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:37,130
You need legal advice to get this video out

1073
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,940
Nayani's counseling history and her mental state are good

1074
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:42,230
Let's get a certificate from Doctor Alfonsu

1075
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:43,450
And I ... Jai .. No ..

1076
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:44,860
Well, Sam

1077
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,970
I lost my daughter

1078
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:50,740
I have to find my own child

1079
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,690
Then follow the instructions now

1080
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:01,490
Keep the best of things in mind

1081
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:03,090
Need to clear up - Okay doctor

1082
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,050
Sam,

1083
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,710
Doctor, there's some work

1084
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,250
Shall we go to the lawyer?

1085
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:11,180
Give me two minutes. - I'll wait

1086
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,580
Is that right to do as you say? - All right

1087
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,060
Doctor, I've found two things,

1088
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,450
The killer's gone,

1089
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:52,510
We found the corpses in the jungle

1090
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,510
Found one thing,

1091
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:57,200
It's a change of years,

1092
01:38:57,620 --> 01:38:59,480
While examining the remains

1093
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:02,220
There was no soil

1094
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,320
They were buried in their bones

1095
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:07,760
There were signs of red soil

1096
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:11,330
The soil was mixed with chemicals

1097
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:12,840
90% of the time

1098
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,170
Could be due to an environmental problem,

1099
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:18,990
There is only one chemical plant in Titan

1100
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,400
Doctor, look at this,

1101
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,720
Chemical waste disposed of in a chemical factory

1102
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:28,560
It has dangerous environmental impacts

1103
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,960
There were many protests

1104
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:34,920
The company to escape the protests,

1105
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,770
From Thomas, who was surrounded by it

1106
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:39,340
Land was purchased at a high price

1107
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:42,090
But it's one Thomas,

1108
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,960
Everything else, in secret,

1109
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,000
Dig the ground

1110
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,130
The body that was taken from it

1111
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,560
The rest of the bodies are buried

1112
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,860
In addition to the other four,

1113
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,060
That's what made this body special

1114
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,570
This is Thomas' list

1115
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:13,180
He 's the one who made the list

1116
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:15,310
We've been looking so long,

1117
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:16,720
A vicious murderer,

1118
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:11,640
Sophia

1119
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,010
Love of my life

1120
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:17,120
That's what changed me as a man

1121
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:21,290
I was alive when he closed his eyes,

1122
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:22,430
For him,

1123
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:24,540
For my niece

1124
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,560
He's been my world since then

1125
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,400
Before the report on cancer

1126
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,950
I've enjoyed my world,

1127
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,230
Everything has changed since then

1128
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:17,640
Congratulations. Increasing signs

1129
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:20,940
You come here, my daddy is home 'll drop

1130
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:21,990
Thank you

1131
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,550
Get up

1132
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,690
Mom ..

1133
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:02,840
You don't need to say this

1134
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,690
To have a chance,

1135
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,130
We wish

1136
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:14,380
Mom, sit down , daughter

1137
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,630
What's this, Mom?

1138
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:16,870
Come on Mom - No, daughter

1139
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,770
Come on, Mom

1140
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:20,860
Dad,

1141
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:22,370
Where did you go with mom?

1142
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,780
My mother and I were there - oh ...

1143
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:33,380
Oh, there's a kitten

1144
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:39,000
Oh wait

1145
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:40,430
What's your name

1146
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:41,490
Tell me ...

1147
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:43,030
No name yet?

1148
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:44,610
Dear daughter

1149
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:47,410
What's this give here?

1150
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,970
Oh, what's this?

1151
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,490
Why don't you smile

1152
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:54,630
Just smile ...

1153
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,140
Just smile

1154
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:58,620
Uncle smile.

1155
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:01,060
Laugh a little ... laugh

1156
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,380
Please laugh

1157
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,320
Just smile ...

1158
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:46,250
While I am in pain I have this disease

1159
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:47,760
My son

1160
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:50,860
He taught me to live well

1161
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,410
I thought I would never allow her to be punished for my mistakes

1162
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:05,520
Naveen ...

1163
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:07,180
Why son?

1164
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,520
Come on,

1165
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,170
Come on

1166
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,940
Good luck

1167
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,650
In the Burma murder case we found one pattern

1168
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,880
We will arrest those responsible

1169
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:22,280
Without failure

1170
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:24,450
Stop ... Stop ...

1171
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,930
Inspector, it's all vehicles

1172
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,350
Never send a single vehicle without checking

1173
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:30,800
Immediately take the suspect into custody

1174
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,640
Let me know

1175
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:33,310
Back then ...

1176
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,600
There was no way out of him

1177
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:38,340
Ritika Xavier IPS

1178
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:46,130
Yes, Doctor

1179
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,160
Alphonse

1180
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,740
You're not going to believe this

1181
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:51,210
Blood samples taken from you are the result

1182
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:54,480
Most of the reports are very positive

1183
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:58,160
This is the history of police in Kerala,

1184
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,950
There was a challenging case

1185
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:03,390
This is a serial murder,

1186
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:05,760
To find a psycho killer

1187
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:07,760
On the one hand, local

1188
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:10,560
We can say we have won

1189
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,250
A bone marrow transplant

1190
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:15,410
Completely well again and can be life better

1191
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,460
Alphonse .. Doctor

1192
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:19,650
I'll call in two minutes or something ...

1193
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,480
This is a case of a headache in Kerala for over a year ,

1194
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,590
This case was investigated thoroughly and solved

1195
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:31,920
Because of the hard work of our talented police team

1196
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,120
Naveen,

1197
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:33,540
Son ..

1198
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,270
one...

1199
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,980
Daddy, who loved him,

1200
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,160
He looked like a beast

1201
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:00,180
The death of Naveen ...

1202
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:03,650
I didn't have to do it all alone

1203
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,590
Tell God

1204
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:09,750
In the jungle,

1205
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,420
His body was secretly buried

1206
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,060
Rithika

1207
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,890
None of this would have happened if he hadn't

1208
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:43,360
I thought they must have felt the pain

1209
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:44,380
But no,

1210
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,290
She deserves something more

1211
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:57,360
Daughter, look ...

1212
01:53:10,930 --> 01:53:12,090
But after a while,

1213
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:14,100
A boy called Reuben came to the hospital

1214
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:20,000
Upon seeing her, I came up with a different plan

1215
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,500
Abducted kid in Burma Colony

1216
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,550
Ubeydan is the killer

1217
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:32,010
The day he is released,

1218
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,640
Going to prison to welcome Ubudan,

1219
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:35,090
I went

1220
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,800
Ruben and Uben

1221
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:49,600
A good plan was made to teach Ritika a good lesson

1222
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:51,590
That's what everyone saw so far,

1223
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:57,910
That's all I did,

1224
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,720
The only reason I survived,

1225
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:07,810
Novel

1226
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:11,760
Wherever you track Ubden's cellphone

1227
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,590
You can't find him where I hide him

1228
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,820
So...

1229
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:38,960
It is

1230
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,370
My insurance policy,

1231
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:53,680
Saved it

1232
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,520
What are you doing now?

1233
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:29,870
Daughter ...

1234
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:31,840
Daughter ...

1235
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:34,190
Daughter ...

1236
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:35,780
Daughter ...

1237
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:39,480
Daughter ...

1238
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:45,810
Daughter ...

1239
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:49,950
Daughter ...

1240
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:53,620
Nothing will happen to you

1241
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:21,320
Sir's insurance policy is expired

1242
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:26,280
I can't do anything about losing her

1243
01:57:26,690 --> 01:57:29,860
There is no evidence to suggest I'm involved in this case

1244
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,190
It closes as an indirect child disappearance

1245
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,520
What else?

1246
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:40,120
Every legal system in the world finally looks at it,

1247
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,770
DNA report

1248
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:44,420
A person's official identification mark

1249
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,340
But there's a problem

1250
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:49,010
Bone marrow transplant

1251
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:53,330
If someone has transplanted someone else 's bones as a cancer treatment

1252
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,430
The DNA in the patient's blood changes

1253
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,670
The donor's DNA belongs to him, but not immediately

1254
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,480
In his skin.

1255
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,470
The DNA in it.

1256
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:03,770
It's her old DNA that won't change

1257
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:07,090
Two different types of DNA in one body

1258
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:08,600
A rare occasion

1259
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,350
Found in Malawi's Chocolate,

1260
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:13,560
Through the skin of his old DNA

1261
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,870
He gave us the test that day

1262
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,870
Blood collected from new DNA

1263
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:20,580
That's Doctor Alphonse's weak spot

1264
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:34,000
The DNA in Doctor Alfons' skin

1265
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:37,490
The Burma murders match the DNA of the murderer

1266
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:44,440
Don't think that you win yourself,

1267
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,380
Someday they have to lose

1268
02:00:55,020 --> 02:01:02,180
Transcription and Subtitling by Lahiru Udayanga ( bornuu7@gmail.com )

1269
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,360
Today we're going to make a Mexican meal at Xavier's Kitchen

1270
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,600
Can Amodada,

1271
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:08,570
Great

1272
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:20,850
Hello Ritika, where are you? When is it coming

1273
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,060
Yes it is. It's finished

1274
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:25,730
I 'll meet Rajesh sir now, okay?

1275
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:26,750
All right

1276
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:29,960
This is what I wanted to give you

1277
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:33,590
This is an old case file,

1278
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:37,940
There's been a lot of work these two months,

1279
02:01:38,030 --> 02:01:39,910
But study this while on vacation

1280
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,790
Sure, sir, I can take care of it

1281
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,830
Thank you

1282
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:50,410
But sir

1283
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,370
Yes,

1284
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:54,200
My team needs two forensic doctors

1285
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:05,760
Hello Shika - madam

1286
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,100
There's a new case

1287
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:08,010
All right ma'am

1288
02:02:08,110 --> 02:02:09,580
Is Sam free?

1289
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:10,830
No, I'm in

1290
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:11,520
All right

1291
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:13,410
Still questioning

1292
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,740
I'll call it over, okay ...

1293
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:17,080
Okay, take your time

1294
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,910
That was when I found out that Alfonson was the killer

1295
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:28,870
Sam should have informed the police

1296
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:30,680
We could handle it

1297
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:34,340
Now we can't find answers to Ubuden's death

1298
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:36,090
We don't have many answers

1299
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:38,390
He lost everything with his death

1300
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,200
The murderer, as soon as you get in the car,

1301
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:42,870
I didn't know Doctor Alfonsu

1302
02:02:45,130 --> 02:02:47,590
Trying to kill you,

1303
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:53,690
It's not going to be as sir thinks

1304
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:57,730
I've tried a lot

1305
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,030
Doctor Alfonsu dies from the accident

1306
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:07,410
This is sir.

1307
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,660
My reply
