Hey, who is that?
Where are you going?

10
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,059
Didn't you borrow money
for your daughter's marriage?

11
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,060
If you can't repay,
go and work as a pimp

12
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,062
You are trying to outwit us

13
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,064
Don't talk bad,
I'll somehow repay before next month..

14
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,067
- Every month you repeat the same story
- Repay by tomorrow

15
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,070
Else we will be with the
women folk at your house

16
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,574
Arul, Rowdy Gurusamy's
men have entered the mill

17
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,577
They have ill treated
Manickam and have assaulted him

18
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,577
-Open the Gate
-He has asked me to close -Who?

19
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,105
Tresspassing into a
peaceful work area is wrong

20
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,099
Assaulting a guy,
in front of 1 000 men is a greater mistake

21
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,111
Above all talking bad to a man who is..

22
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,614
..old enough to be your
dad is all the more wrong

23
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,117
Why do you talk like a big....?(CENSORED)

24
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,109
God does not like atrocities
Arul does not like dirty talks

25
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,122
Is Arul a big....?(CENSORED)

26
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,125
- Look at me and repeat it
- Are you a big....?

27
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,128
- Look at my eyes and say that
- Are you a big....?

28
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,238
If you lay your hands on workers
I will chop your hands off

29
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,240
How much you have to pay?

30
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,233
Out of Rs 50000,
I have repaid, 38000, balance is 1 2000

31
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,750
For him Rs 1 2000 is a debt

32
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,753
For rest of us
it is one day's expenditure

33
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,262
For his sake I contribute Rs 50

34
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,301
Om Sakthi,
Goddess Kamatchi bless us

35
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,307
He must be
the only guy in the whole world

36
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,310
Sleeping to the
invocation for wake up of Almighty

37
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,303
That invocation is over
now 'Kanda shashti kavasam' is played

38
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,319
You blow and melt gold
He watches attentively and spins yarn

39
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,311
Although we blow and melt
we are our own masters

40
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,816
Even after marriage
these boys obey me

41
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,331
They are gems,
but he alone is a scrap

42
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,833
- He has become rusty
- For us all 4 children are alike

43
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:20,829
If you plead for him,
Even at this age, I may drive you out

44
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,856
Uncle, Grandma asked,
whether you need..

45
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,359
..'ldli' or 'Dosa' for breakfast?
- Tell her 'ldli'

46
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:47,355
Uncle, mom asked whether you need
coconut sauce or tomato sauce

47
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:53,361
- 'Tomato sauce'
- Bloody tomato sauce!.

48
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,376
What dress are you going to wear?
I will iron it for you

49
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,377
It is kept on the chair

50
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,381
You hear the wake up
invocation and sleep

51
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,383
Your dad is shouting at me

52
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,378
What can I do?
This 'margazhi' season, I got used to it

53
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,390
Now I can't sleep
without hearing devotional songs

54
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:17,385
Not only that, this will
help me not to hear dad's shouts

55
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,399
Mom I will be at Sanker's house
when lunch is ready sent word

56
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,401
- What gravy you want?
-Fish gravy -yes

57
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,904
Go with the fish net
to the pond to catch fishes

58
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,408
Only on holidays he has lunch at home

59
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,409
What is wrong in
cooking his favorite dish?

60
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,412
Senthil, has Thangam opened his shop?

61
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,915
No, he has gone to
Peelamedu for ear boring

62
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,418
Oh Casanova,
Don't pinch my heart

63
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:56,424
Slowly, with your eyes
don't measure me..

64
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,438
-Who are you?
-That doesn't matter, you dance

65
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,440
Stop it, this is my house,
who are you?

66
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,943
- Is it house no 1 3? -Yes
- Are you Paramasivam? -Yes

67
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,945
- Wanted someone 'for ear boring'?
- Yes

68
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,948
- I am the guy -ls it so?
- Tell me for whom I should do

69
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,950
- For my girl
- Is it her?

70
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,953
What is this?
Her nose and ears has already been bored

71
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,455
Why do you want to do again?

72
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,457
That is all old style
do you know the latest style?

73
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,459
-What is it?
- That is at the navel

74
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,466
Bondage between the mother
and the child is the umbilical cord

75
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,968
Why are you
such a mean minded dad?

76
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,972
-Did I ever say I am the dad
-You said she is your girl

77
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,476
- Did I say I am her father?
- What do you mean?

78
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,478
Today it is Karnataka,
tomorrow it is Andhra

79
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,980
- Day after?
- Kerala

80
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,483
Then it should be
done for you and not her

81
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,985
-Where?
- Here

82
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,981
Don't lock me
in your soul with my anklet

83
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:58,987
Oh Casanova!

84
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,500
-Subbu send 2 fags
- will send it

85
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,004
You have breakfast at your house
but want coffee of ours?

86
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,007
Yes, because your filter coffee is superb

87
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,510
-But seems it is not prepared by you
-Might be by her dad

88
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,011
Mind your business

89
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,516
Shouldn't smoke in public places

90
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,517
If the legs are out,
it is public place

91
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,019
If it is in, it is private

92
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,022
Tomato,Brinjal,
Raddish, drumstick, beans

93
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,527
Ladies finger,
snake gourd,....

94
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,528
What Ponni,
You were not to be seen?

95
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,530
It's nothing, Arul

96
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,033
I had a marriage proposal

97
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,535
Did you like the groom?

98
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,539
When we gave snacks
They asked for liquour

99
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,541
What happened then?

100
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,034
My dad smacked
and they ran away

101
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,047
That is why
I am asking you to marry me

102
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,549
But you don't listen at all

103
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,050
Don't kid with me

104
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,552
I am not going to get married

105
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,553
I may love someone

106
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,056
Don't spoil your life
with love affairs

107
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,287
-I won't be taken for a ride
-Listen to me

108
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:09,557
At the foothills of Maruthamalai
Arul has incarnated

109
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,062
Through Oppanakkara street..

110
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,568
..Dream beauty goes

111
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,572
Ponni's mind is ruined..

112
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,577
..By the love in her eyes

113
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,087
Oh pappad of Ukkadam, spinned top

114
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,600
Ask for grace from Arul

115
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,604
Oh Peelamedu chariot
The drum adorned with a dot

116
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,106
Love is a boredom

117
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:54,102
Oh Avinashi Madam
don't breach my word

118
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,615
Looking at eyes and colour

119
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,618
Don't believe it as Love

120
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,115
Don't do Ponni,
this love is troublesome

121
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,622
This Arul's words
will come true, listen Ponni

122
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,628
Don't do Ponni,
this love is troublesome

123
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,633
This Arul's words
will come true, listen Ponni

124
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,649
Oh pappad of Ukkadam,
spinned top

125
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,652
Ask for grace from Arul

126
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,156
Oh Peelamedu chariot
The drum adorned with a dot

127
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,659
Love is a boredom

128
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,701
Even if you smile a little

129
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,205
He will cook up
stories to heights of lighthouse

130
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,707
Even if glance at them

131
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,211
He will concoct
stories about roses blooming

132
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,714
Will call you dear and darling

133
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,218
Talk about marriage
He will run away

134
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,224
Will call you dear and darling

135
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,227
Talk about marriage
He will run away

136
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:56,724
It is pulling
If you peel off, it is nothing

137
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,736
Love is like an onion

138
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,739
Oh pappad of Ukkadam, spinned top

139
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,742
Ask for grace from Arul

140
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,246
Oh Peelamedu chariot
The drum adorned with a dot

141
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,749
Love is a boredom

142
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:23,284
Because she is excited
She is asking for the garland

143
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:29,757
A garland

144
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,795
After 5 comes 6
And from cotton comes yarn

145
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,298
Oh lady, likewise,
desires come from heart

146
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,801
Among rivers it is 'Siruvani'
If 'achi' it refers to Pollachi

147
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,304
But love refers to lies, listen

148
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,800
Don 't love a stranger
Don 't trust an unclaimed land

149
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:22,310
Don't love a stranger
Don't trust an unclaimed land

150
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:28,316
Ponni madam, love is like hot water

151
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,830
Marry the boy suggested by parents

152
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,832
Oh pappad of Ukkadam, spinned top

153
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,835
-Ask for grace from Arul
-Ask him

154
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,838
Oh Peelamedu chariot
The drum adorned with a dot

155
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,342
-Love is a boredom
-It is a bore

156
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:50,338
-Oh Avinashi Madam
don't breach my word - Tell her

157
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,851
Looking at eyes and colour

158
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,843
-Don't believe it as Love
- Yes my dear

159
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,851
Don't do Ponni,
this love is troublesome

160
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,357
This Arul's words
will come true, listen Ponni

161
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,363
Don't do Ponni,
this love is troublesome

162
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,870
This Arul's words
will come true, listen Ponni

163
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,385
Stop

164
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,887
You are riding at high speed

165
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,389
Why do you drive like a......... (CENSORED)

166
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,393
Will you not stop instantly?
come here

167
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,397
-Arul, please don't
-Hold the kerchief

168
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,900
-Listen to me, he is a cop
-Leave me

169
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,902
Arul has invoked the grace

170
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,403
What did you say?

171
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,405
Why did you go and stop there?

172
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,907
Why do you stare at me?

173
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,909
God does not like atrocities
Arul does not like dirty talks

174
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,411
If you don't like what will you do?

175
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,914
Look at me and repeat it
You......? (CENSORED)

176
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,416
Look at my eyes and say that
You.....? (CENSORED)

177
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,919
Are you assaulting a cop?

178
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,923
Come

179
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,924
Note down the number

180
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,019
At the village we used to steal

181
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,931
chicken by hurling wet gunny bags

182
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,932
Your face tells me
you are a chicken thief

183
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,934
You may not last for even 3 minutes

184
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,936
The vehicle has stopped
please push the vehicle

185
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,938
Go away, whom are you asking to...

186
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,440
Come

187
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,448
Only the song is loud, push with vigor

188
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,452
Thanks a lot

189
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,961
Thanking us!

190
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,963
Look here
How arrogant you are?

191
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,965
Were you sitting in
the car and asking us to push?

192
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,967
Will your legs sprain
if you alight from car?

193
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,973
Ask these two
to push the vehicle and start it

194
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,474
Atleast let their flab come down

195
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,967
Do they have any sense?
Those two sit like water melon

196
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,980
-Hello sir
-Who is that?

197
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,490
I am lame

198
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,993
So I sat in the car
while you were pushing it

199
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,996
If I am at fault, forgive us

200
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,497
I have done a mistake

201
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,499
I didn't know your leg has a deformity

202
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,001
It is alright

203
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,993
I am a ruffian, Short tempered
some times talk like this

204
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,006
You were with me
You could have informed

205
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,508
-You may go
-Yes sir

206
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,510
Don't mistake me, careful

207
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,012
Come here

208
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,513
Careful

209
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,015
Poor girl

210
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,023
Many thanks to you

211
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,025
Careful

212
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,527
Poor girl

213
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,032
Sister, why did you
deceive them that you are lame?

214
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,535
Wanted to avenge them,
for they scolded us

215
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,538
I think he lives in this area
You will be trapped

216
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,052
People normally brush their teeth

217
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,553
That guy is brushing his hand

218
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,056
Perhaps he is brushing his dentures

219
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,058
Look there

220
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,560
A beautiful woman
like lyengar's bakery's bun

221
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,062
Come let us see

222
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,564
Customers are coming in car to our shop

223
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,566
Welcome, What do you want?

224
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,068
Three packets of 'Murukku'

225
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,069
One packet of 'Kamarkattu'

226
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,572
Does this look like a snack bar to you?

227
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,574
Is this not a petty shop?

228
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,576
Look behind
Kamatchi Silver Sales

229
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,079
Will you open only on Friday?

230
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,580
OK, note down the list

231
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,083
1 kilo toe rings, 3/4 kilo nose screws

232
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,584

233
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,586
Look, this contains Acid

234
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,589
If I splashed it on your face
It will be a bloodbath

235
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,091
Who are you
and what do you want?

236
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,592
We have moved to the opposite house

237
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,094
I am Kanmani
And she is Neelaveni

238
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,595
I am Thankam
Will roar like a lion

239
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,097
But will look ugly

240
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,600
They deliberately
pick up quarrel on arrival

241
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,602
Mani, does it take
so much time for shopping?

242
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,106
I told you not to call me
with the masculine name Mani

243
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,607
You have pierced
my nose also at an young age

244
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,609
If you don't like it
Remove the nose screw

245
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,111
But how can I close the hole?

246
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,612
Close it with calcium

247
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,115
If you call me Mani again
I won't mind you are my mom

248
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,116
-I will punch you
-Will you?

249
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,121
Invite neighbours for
tomorrow's house warming

250
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,622
That we can do
tomorrow morning

251
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,125
Mom, we have moved
from Tiruppur to Kovai

252
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,126
Have you written
to your husband in Rangoon?

253
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,628
Yes I have

254
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
Infact, mom and we are alike

255
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,132
How?

256
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,633
We are studying
through correspondence

257
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,136
Mom loves dad through correspondence

258
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,140
Came to get a
recommendation letter from the MLA

259
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,642
For how many persons he can give?

260
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,179
He has borrowed
1 lakh rupees a month ago

261
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,647
He has come to repay the amount

262
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,149
Sir, here is the amount

263
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,651
Am I your nail to
scratch whenever it itches you?

264
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,154
If you borrow from me
You can repay only after an year

265
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,655
Until then pay the interest

266
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,157
Borrowed it for 1 0%% rate

267
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,658
If I pay interest for a year
how can I return the principal?

268
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,161
Didn't you get the money
by mortgaging your house?

269
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,662
Sell it and go

270
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,164
Owner of Ganapathy theatre

271
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,666
How is your business?

272
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,168
Saturday and Sunday
it runs house full

273
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,669
Rest of the week, it is very less

274
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,171
What do you mean by very less?

275
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,172
You could as well play a VCD at home

276
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,674
Why do you run a theatre for that?

277
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,676
-Sir?
-I need that place

278
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,178
That is our family property

279
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,180
So what, are you going to be buried there?

280
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,683
We are going to demolish it
and build a shopping complex

281
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,685
That's what I have planned too

282
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,188
Assess a rate and get it

283
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,189
Party men are waiting for you

284
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,693
One brother is the MLA
and the other is the party leader

285
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,696
Both of them have planned
to buy half of Coimbatore

286
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,198
Gandhipuram Krishnamurthy

287
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,699
Kinattukadavu Ramachandran,

288
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,701

You may go now

290
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,215
Iyer, what are you looking at?

291
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,716
It's Government's egg

292
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,718
It can break stone grinder
and lyer's head too

293
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,221
No one to dare you
Your savageries are too high

294
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,223
Greetings

295
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,724
All you have come together

296
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,726
As if you are
the guardians of mother Tamil

297
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,228
Please be seated

298
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,731
Block level, Taluk,
executive council member

299
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,767
General council member,
district secretary

300
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,236
Even Chenniappan is there

301
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,238
Then, what is the matter?

302
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,739
You are going to the assembly tomorrow

303
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,241
So they have all come to meet you

304
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,742
Who are they?

305
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,245
These are the ones
who complained to the Collector

306
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,248
If you give it to me
It will reach the assembly

307
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,750
If you give it elsewhere
It will reach my pocket

308
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,252
What is your problem?

309
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,253
There is no water supply in our area

310
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,255
Keep it right in front of the house

311
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,757
What is this?

312
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,259
why are you keeping
the water tank in front of my house?

313
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,761
You complain to the collector?
Face the consequences

314
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,763
The roads are in
poor condition in our area

315
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,766
Why do you place
the tar barrels at my door?

316
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,268
Didn't you ask for roads?

317
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,769
Next month will get stone pebbles....

318
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,272
Will the stork eat the fish?

319
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,274
Or will the fish eat the stork?

320
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,276
Man will eat both....

321
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,779
-What do you want now?
-I want Arul now

322
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,281
Why does the Satan riding the cycle

323
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,782
ask for the cockroach riding the bike?

324
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,284
I must get Arul now

325
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,286
To get grace go to the temple
Or do a fire walk

326
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,288
-I will walk upon you
-Should not talk like that

327
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,790
I will talk like that only

328
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,292
Won't you respect your brother?

329
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,793
You call yourself a brother

330
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,295
Who said you are my brother?

331
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,297
Look at his ugly face
They have named a tin as 'Gold'....

332
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,309
Sir, are there no female members here?

333
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,312
-Swarnam
-Yes coming

334
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,314
What do you want?

335
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,817
We have moved to your opposite house

336
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,319
We are doing house warming today

337
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:42,820
All of you must come

338
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,823
I may not be able to come
why don't you go and attend?

339
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,327
Mom said a senior
like you should conduct the Pooja

340
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,830
OK we will come

341
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,336
Why do you look through a lens?

342
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,337
Because the stone is too small

343
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,340
If use bigger stones
you may not require lens

344
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,848
Only ladies have come?

345
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,350
What about the male members?

346
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,351
He is a merchant at Rangoon

347
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,353
He will come once
in three years only

348
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,357
Bye, visit frequently

349
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,358
Quick, If you delay like this
you will be late for school

350
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,861
-Look there
- How did he come here?

351
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,367
Why are you standing here?

352
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,870
This is my house
We are the new tenants

353
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,373
-ls that so?
-OK, you may go

354
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,374
Careful, leg, gently

355
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,378
Bye

356
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,380
Mom,you have gone there
without giving me breakfast

357
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,373
That girl insisted that
I must attend the house warming

358
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,888
Poor girl, she is one legged, bye!

359
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,892
One legged?
What is he saying?

360
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,894
-She had both the legs, right?
-Yes

361
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:58,725
What do you think about yourself?

362
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,899
Will you give us the
amount demanded by us or not?

363
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,401
Do you know who we are?

364
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,902
If you donate funds for us
you are saved, otherwise...

365
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,404
Let us see how
you run this factory

366
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,405
You are talking over phone
as we are screaming from here?

367
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,408
Creating mischief?
will tear you apart

368
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,910
Boss, did you call me?

369
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,412
-Greetings Sir
-Greetings

370
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,914
If I die suddenly
It will be because of them

371
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,416
What are you saying?

372
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,417
Are they deliberately creating mischief....

373
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,919
I am slightly tense
will be back in a minute...

374
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,421
I will be back in a minute

375
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,925
Sir, white and
white man, I am calling you

376
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,427
Wait for a minute

377
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,931
I didn't see your faces inside

378
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,933
Now I have seen clearly,
you may go

379
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,435
Just a moment

380
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,936
Just listen to what I have to say

381
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:46,934
If anything happen to our boss
We will tear you apart

382
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,446
We are the ruling party

383
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,447
Do you know
what will happen, if you oppose us?

384
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:55,442
You ask for votes, We cast votes

385
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,955
There are 5000 members in our union

386
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,458
Along with family members
it's more than 20,000 votes

387
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,961
We could make an empty guy an MLA

388
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,963
and make an MLA empty also

389
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,965
You can not spin your yarn here

390
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,967
We are already spinning a lot
Leave the place

391
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,969
This husk has gold
Quick, they might come

392
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:13,471
They have come....

393
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,972
What are you doing here?

394
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,474
Can't you see
we are scooping the husk?

395
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:17,975
Was it you behind
stealing the husk so far?

396
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,477
Whom do you call a thief?

397
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,978
Why should I steal
from my own house?

398
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,481
Don't I have rights to scoop
even the husk in this house?

399
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:24,982
What have you done for me?

400
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,484
We have given you a silver shop

401
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:27,985
What silver store?

402
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,488
You have looted all gold
and named me gold

403
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:31,989
You have given me
this useless silver shop

404
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,491
Are you trying to cheat me?

405
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:34,992
Don't talk as you like
In addition we have given

406
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,494
The ear piercing section too

407
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:37,995
What a big section that is..

408
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,497
The total fee for
piercing is Rs. 500 only

409
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,999
Out of the 500 you take 450
and giving me only 50

410
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,002
-What are you up to?
-What?

411
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,505
Don't want your kinship
Partition the assets now

412
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,007
Asset? What Asset?

413
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,509
We have got 80 acres land in Pollachi

414
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,011
Keep 40 acres for you
and give me 40 acres, I will go

415
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,014
40 acres for four of us
and for you alone 40 acres?

416
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,016
Your dad has fathered 4 children in haste

417
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,018
My dad has patiently fathered only me

418
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,520
And that too a lion cub

419
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,021
Don't abuse our dad

420
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,024
How can you talk bad about our father?...

421
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,029
He is talking too much...

422
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,531
For scooping handful of husk

423
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,532
all of you have turned against me

424
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,534
All this is because of my dad's brother

425
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,038
I have prepared a wedge for you

426
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,542
Leave me, I am going

427
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,044
Let it go if it goes...

428
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,037
That flour mill guy gazes at us
Should pluck his eyes

429
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,552
Why do you stare?

430
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,555
Mani doesn't like red colour

431
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,057
Can I go nude for that?

432
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,059
I have heard dogs
can see in black & white only

433
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,061
Is this dog an exception?

434
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,563
Sister, come

435
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,567
If you make noise I will break your head

436
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,579
Stop

437
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,080
Who are they?

438
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:05,583
They are guests to our area
Why do you chase them?

439
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,586
I can understand

440
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
That poor girl wore a red color dress

441
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,591
You should not have
chased a one legged girl

442
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,092
One legged?

443
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,095
Were you not running?

444
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,589
Running? No, I am one legged?
How can I run?

445
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,602
Let me think about it

446
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,605
Oh no, it seems you have come running

447
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,608
Holding my sister I was leaping

448
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,112
You might not have
noticed the leg because of the skirt

449
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,616
You are right, you may go

450
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,124
She is one legged

451
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,627
You are deceiving him as one legged....

452
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,628
The truth will come out one day

453
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,130
He is going to make you one legged

454
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,632
-Be careful
-Let us see

455
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,634
Can't find a place in
Ukkadam to start the party office?

456
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,137
Half of the city has
already been acquired by us

457
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,639
Stop

458
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,141
Whose building is that?

459
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,643
Belongs to Dr. Nallamuthu

460
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,645
How is his background?
Will anyone represent?

461
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,147
A very frail man,very average background

462
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,650
If it is a cinema theatre
can be vacated easily

463
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,151
But to vacate an operation theatre

464
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,653
We have to throw out the patients

465
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,654
Even outskirts will do for us...

466
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,158
Have not they vacated yet?

467
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,160
We have cut down
water supply and electricity

468
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,162
It seems they won't vacate
unless we cut down their necks

469
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,165
Anyway we have got
6 acres within the city

470
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,170
- That rogue has just left
- Whose property is this?

471
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,163
If it is closed then it must be ours
It is apt for party office

472
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,177
Facing east and with
direct sun light, we will reach heights

473
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,681
After Tirupathi abode
only this place has 3 perfect corners

474
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,682
Oh my goodness

475
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,685
How atrocious?
Why are you breaking the lock?

476
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,189
- lyer, is this your house?
- This is Anantharaman's house

477
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,191
Since he is in Delhi,
he has asked me to take care

478
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,694
Iyer's house seems
more perfect than this

479
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,696
Will vacate in 2 weeks
after starting the office

480
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,689
Make the foundation strong
Make a call to the leader

481
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:09,195
-Leader
-Long live

482
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,208
Leader!

483
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,214
Opposite party Chathappan has come
to join us with 30 MLAs

484
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,717
Very glad

485
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,720
-Leader
-Long live

486
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,224
Come Chathappa
Hereafter you are my captain

487
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,718
Long live Leader Sethupathy
and brother Chathappan

488
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:36,723
From today I'll be an ordinary worker
and work for your party

489
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,736
Don't say 'my' party & 'your' party
Hereafter it is 'our' party

490
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,239
With dynamic persons like you..

491
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,743
..Why Tamilnadu, I can
grab power, even in Delhi

492
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:55,242
Were you not abusing me on every stage?

493
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,755
How much trust Eswara Pandian had on you?

494
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,757
You have betrayed your leader

495
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,760
How can I be certain that
you won't join another party?

496
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,263
This is the punishment
for joining our party

497
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,767
- If you defect from us, I'll kill you
- I'll be your slave till the end

498
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:15,762
The press is waiting outside
Wash your face & pose for photo, go

499
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,267
- Your brother is calling
- Brother - Tell Gajapathy

500
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,782
- I have seen a place for party office
in Ukkadam - I am so happy

501
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,783
- You must inaugurate it
- I will

502
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:34,281
Ruling party men have encroached
your house for their party office

503
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,293
I am in a fix, don't now what to do?

504
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,797
- I will talk in person
while I come to Coimbatore - OK

505
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,299
- Shall I do?
- It is on the line

506
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,292
- It is on the line, look there
- No you are out

507
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,805
See there

508
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:59,305
- You jump and play
- Get lost - Shall we play later?

509
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,818
I will beat you

510
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,325
- Look there
- My goodness

511
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,318
What are you looking
through lens at the opposite house?

512
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,832
Do you know
how good she plays the limp game?

513
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,834
Poor girl,
she is one legged and can limp only

514
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,837
-One legged? -Yeah
- Whom are you referring?

515
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,341
With two eyes I saw her
playing with two legs!

516
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,845
- I too saw
- What happened to your family?

517
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,846
Your brothers rage
if I talk about your dad

518
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,849
- You call a normal girl one legged
- One leg only

519
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,854
They have started
Let us go and see

520
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:46,854
Whatever we see
doesn't belong to our eyes!

521
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:52,859
Doesn't belong to our eyes!

522
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:58,865
Since you have
become a pupil of my eyes...

523
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,379
You can't be
separated from the eyes...

524
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,873
And you can't be separated from me

525
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,895
Oh God!

526
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,403
Neelaveni, why did you stop?
Dance until the pestle break

527
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,906
Dance until the mortar rolls
Dance until the house get crumbled

528
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,407
Shut up your mouth

529
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,904
-It's really one leg
-I'll tell if it is one leg or two legs

530
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:41,919
What for?...

531
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,929
Catch her

532
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:56,934
Catch

533
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,942
Don't leave

534
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,448
Like that

535
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,954
- Don't leave her till evening
- The right verdict - Get lost

536
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,458
You sinners
Will you prosper

537
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:27,954
Your father's niece Malathi..
Can we propose her for our Arul?

538
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,466
I have already asked them

539
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,971
Said they will accept
a self employed goldsmith only

540
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:42,469
You may attend the marriage
tomorrow morning at doctor's house

541
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,984
I am going out of station and
you have come like Goddess Lakshmi

542
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,478
- Where are they going?
- They are going to Calicut to buy gold

543
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,492
-All of them are going?
-Because they carry a huge sum

544
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,494
Come inside

545
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,992
We had water scarcity at Tiruppur
We had to wander with pots daily

546
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,504
Is that so?

547
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,508
- Welcome Doctor
- Greetings

548
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,511
With wedding scheduled for tomorrow
you have come here now

549
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,014
- Is sir there?
- No he has gone outstation

550
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:18,515
What is the matter?

551
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,508
The wedding chain was there
until the pooja time

552
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,521
Thereafter it was missing

553
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,523
It must have been
taken by some relatives

554
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,026
We don't want to
create a scene by checking them

555
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,029
We can go ahead with the marriage
using the tamarind coated thread

556
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:36,021
But missing of the chain
would be considered a bad omen

557
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,034
The chain was made by sir

558
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,537
Before dawn we want a similar one

559
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,040
I can understand your plight

560
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,043
But all the members
have gone out of station

561
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,547
Arul has come,
let us ask him to make it

562
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,550
Greetings doctor, why at this hour?

563
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,554
-Come here
-What mom? Why all of you are worried?

564
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,057
You must immediately
make a wedding chain

565
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,058
Mom you know everything... I can't

566
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,562
Don't be adamant
make the wedding chain

567
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,066
-Mom, I can't, you know I won't do it
- Don't shout, they are here

568
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,568
- It's very urgent,
Will you do it or not? - I can't

569
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,570
Will you not obey your mom?

570
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,073
-They have come out of trust in us
-Leave my hands, I am going

571
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,074
Wedding is scheduled for tomorrow, do it

572
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,076
-I can't
- Do it for your mother's sake

573
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,069
- I can't and that is final
- If you can't, don't meet me hereafter

574
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,583
- Mom
- Don't give me reasons

575
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,576
- Why do you ask me....?
- You don't do it, right? - OK

576
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,600
- We will collect it in the early morning
- OK - Thanks a lot

577
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,627
Does he know to make a wedding chain?

578
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,130
Wedding chain? He knows all jobs

579
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,624
Capable of earning thousands a day

580
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,639
Working at a mill for Rs. 4500 per month

581
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,142
- Adamant
- Why mom?

582
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,644
He doesn't like dirty talks

583
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,139
Are the chains for
Palakkad Ganga jewellery ready?

584
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,652
- Yes
- Parcel it and give it to him

585
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,655
-Be careful while going
-Yes dad

586
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,161
How will it be lost?

587
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,663
If someone can steal 2
will he leave the remaining 8

588
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,666
-I don't know dad
-Have you sold it & frittered the money?

589
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,668
Don't lie that you don't know about it

590
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,661
-What can I say, if I don't know
-You are capable of stealing & lying

591
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,175
To whom have you given the money?

592
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,676
Please don't talk dirty

593
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,179
What self esteem
is there for a thief like you?

594
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,180
I am a thief and my hands are not clean

595
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,183
I don't want to do this goldsmith's job
Hereafter I won't touch this gold

596
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,188
I stole the chain
Had some problems at her house

597
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,189
Father will not give assistance so easily

598
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,192
You sinner
He was blamed unnecessarily

599
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,195
- You inform dad first
- No, wait mom

600
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,697
If I am insulted
that will be limited to me

601
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,200
If he is insulted then his
whole family will be humiliated

602
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,702
Leave it like that
Don't let anyone else know about it

603
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,200
After that incident
he has touched gold only today

604
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,716
My son lives like
a guest at his own house

605
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,219
He gives his monthly salary to me

606
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:47,213
Otherwise he comes home
for food and sleeping only

607
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,231
Stay on

608
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,749
- Mom!
- What?

609
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,252
What was the length they wanted? 7 or 8?

610
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,253
I did not ask them

611
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,259
Mani, come here

612
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:28,765
Sit down

613
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,292
You got 10 fingers

614
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,296
Why only one finger is sweet?

615
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,801
The finger that
touched you is sweet to me

616
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,805
All other fingers are starving

617
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,809
Oh bee of the bamboo forest
The crab that jerks my brain

618
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,813
Am I the feast to contain
the starvation of your 1 0 fingers

619
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:34,320
Oh Bandit darling
The girl who commit light murders

620
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,323
Will I leave if you keep away?

621
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,830
I am obliged to hide my arrogant beauty

622
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:49,335
It's your ability to pluck
with out unveiling the screen

623
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,840
It's cruel to hide the beauty

624
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:59,344
You got 1 0 fingers

625
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,849
Why only one finger is sweet?

626
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,853
The finger that
touched you is sweet to me

627
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,358
All other fingers are starving

628
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,397
Oh man who pinches my mind

629
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,900
Do you know Cupid's lingo?

630
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,895
With the eyes
that could penetrate the dress

631
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,899
Stroking upto the soul

632
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,903
All that are to be done with fingers..

633
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,907
..are done with your sight

634
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,921
By age you are so young

635
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,426
But you are broad-minded than your age

636
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,920
You got 1 0 fingers

637
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,091
Why only one finger is sweet?

638
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,928
The finger that
touched you is sweet to me

639
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,433
All other fingers are starving

640
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:04,470
My shyness is missing
Was it you who stole it?

641
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,974
So far I lived in solitude like mercury..

642
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,978
.. which won't allow anything to stick

643
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:20,987
Like a silent shadow
you fell into my mind

644
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,500
Will go much deeper inside

645
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,505
and will take
the treasure from your heart

646
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,999
- You got 1 0 fingers
- I got 1 0 fingers

647
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,504
-Only one finger is..
-.. Sweet but why?

648
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,507
The finger that
touched you is sweet to me

649
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,511
All other fingers are starving

650
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,515
Oh bee of the bamboo forest
The crab that jerks my brain

651
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:55,020
Am I the feast to contain
the starvation of your 1 0 fingers

652
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:01,026
Oh Bandit darling
The girl who commit light murders

653
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:06,032
Will I leave if you keep away?

654
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,548
You are obliged to
hide your arrogant beauty

655
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:16,041
Plucking without
unveiling the screen is my ability

656
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:20,546
Hiding the beauty is cruelty

657
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:46,072
Don't twist our hips
Go straight

658
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,585
What a nice scene in the early morning

659
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,087
Eyes would remain intact
if I could see it daily

660
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,590
- I will give you one slap
-I will give two on your cheeks

661
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,092
- Will you, I am leaving
- Hold it

662
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,596
- Kanmani
- Mom is calling me, I will go

663
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,598
I was holding
the cycle for you to learn

664
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,101
-Who will teach me then?
-Am I not here?

665
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,103
-You?
-Yes I am

666
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,106
- Do you know how to ride a cycle?
- Are you asking me?

667
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,108
I will give you
a list of things I can ride

668
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,612
Bike, Car, Lorry, Bus,
Train, Aeroplane, Helicopter...

669
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,115
- Do you know to ride a cycle?
- Why are you so doubtful?

670
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,618
Trusting you,
if I ride and suppose if you..

671
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,119
..push me on someone and run away?

672
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,112
I won't go to jail after
pushing you over someone, listen to me

673
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,627
- You ride and show me first
- Move away, see now

674
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:36,622
From that day to this day
The sky has not changed

675
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:43,629
Man has changed
Has mounted on the cycle...

676
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,144
Go singing like this

677
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,147
Oh God!

678
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,655
- Oh God!
- Dirty pig

679
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,658
Were you trying to cheat me?

680
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,663
Festival at coniamman temple
Give donation

681
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,665
You don't look like people from temple

682
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,168
To prove that
should we have a bell in hand?

683
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,171
- Give us the money
- Why do you drop 50 Rs? Drop 500 Rs

684
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,173
I can afford 50 rupees only

685
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,677
Aren't you making ornaments
by mixing copper in it?

686
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,678
If you Pay 500 Rs
we will pour porridge at temple

687
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,680
Else we will pour
milk for your last rites

688
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:28,184
- Son!!
- Come out, we will smack you

689
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,187
Then you'll spend 500 to 1 000Rs as
making charges to the hospital

690
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:38,685
Looks like he is the stingiest of all
Come out you miser dog

691
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,697
What is this,
they use abusive language?

692
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,203
-Brother -What?
- They have abused dad

693
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,205
-Who?
-Singanallur men

694
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,210
It is those people

695
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,311
In the name of God, you beg...

696
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,313
On top of it, do you behave rudely too?

697
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,317
-Apologize now
Forgive us sir

698
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,322
Go, If seen in this area...

699
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,324
Will you not mend yourself?

700
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,326
When will you change your attitude?

701
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,828
Please be quiet

702
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,830
This dog has bitten
those street dogs for they barked

703
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,332
Why do you shout?

704
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,334
Instead of letting
the hooligans have their way

705
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,337
He has dragged them here
and fought with them

706
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:02,839
Please keep quiet

707
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,341
Mom, he must be crazy

708
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,343
He fought them because they scolded him

709
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,846
He drags in all the troubles
that goes through the road

710
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,848
Why do you do all these atrocities?

711
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,850
I want to live honorably in this street

712
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,855
See, even after all this,
he is quiet and rock like

713
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,873
Come on good sardine is available

714
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,875
We are vegetarians,
we don't eat fish and meat

715
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,378
Don't mistake me

716
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,872
I have seen children
who don't respect parents

717
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,885
Even when his dad
admonished him like anything

718
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,888
Your son kept quite
Only your son can behave that way

719
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,890
Your son is like a diamond

720
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,893
It can be used as
a cutting tool and also as a decoration

721
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,387
Please ask him
not to scold Arul in public

722
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,901
It occurred to me...

723
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,905
I keep telling,
don't you have brain at all?

724
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,907
Don't talk too much I will tear you apart

725
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,902
I have got four brothers
They won't leave you easily

726
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,914
Did you brush your teeth this morning?

727
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,416
Why?

728
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:21,918
Why do you start so early?...

729
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,915
Are my four brothers
there as pallbearers?

730
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,928
Was I not pampered
as the only girl child?

731
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,930
He has smacked very badly

732
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,935
What can I do now?

733
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,438
You prepare wedding chain in gold for all

734
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,441
Did you prepare my wedding chain in clay?

735
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,444
I shuttle between Tiruppur and Kovai

736
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,446
and don't know when it will snap?

737
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,450
Won't someone pay and send the auto?

738
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,453
See, your sister

739
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,455
Mom, Even here she talks like this

740
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,457
Who knows how badly she talked there?

741
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:02,959
Alright, you take her there

742
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,461
Your brother-in-law
won't listen to others

743
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:06,963
Arul kumara

744
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,464
My voice would have reached the ears of..

745
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,466
Lord Muruga in Maruthamalai
Hasn't it reached your ears yet?

746
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,969
Shut up your mouth

747
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,973
My husband has become mad
Is he a human being?

748
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,474
At the drop of a hat, he smacks me

749
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,977
He fears no one other than you

750
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:22,478
You must tell him

751
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:23,980
Whoever it may be, tear into two

752
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,482
Tear apart to two
in one strike, that is our style

753
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,484
Why do you buy meals from outside?

754
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:29,986
Is your wife not at home?

755
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,978
I don't want food
if I have to forego my esteem

756
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,491
Seems sister in law has come

757
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:36,993
Where will she.....?

758
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:38,494
Hold it

759
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,496
Do you want to leave your sister at home?

760
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:41,998
Here is the key

761
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,992
It was not intentional
You know about your sister

762
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,004
She has got
a mouth bigger than this factory

763
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,006
I slightly patted over
her mouth and that's all

764
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,508
I will go home at 5'o'clock

765
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,010
Look at his face

766
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:56,011
I won't touch her again

767
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,013
Come home I will teach you

768
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,018
You were talking like a tiger

769
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:03,519
Cooled down like a wet mouse

770
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,021
when you saw your brother-in-law

771
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,522
Then what to do

772
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,515
- At the age of 1 2 he made a plot
to revenge me - How was it?

773
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,029
One day I scolded his sister

774
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,030
Keeping that in mind

775
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,533
He made his cousin
run across and on the pretext

776
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,036
of striking him hit me with a stone

777
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,037
Still that scar remains

778
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,541
If you use filthy words
can never escape from him

779
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,534
Very brilliant,
he will rock Kovai one day

780
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,545
Why is she here?
Near the Biriyani shop?

781
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,060
Here is the parcel

782
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,063
Said she is a vegetarian
and is now buying biriyani?

783
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,075
Go away
It is nothing

784
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,585
What is she carrying in the bag?

785
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,587
Could be vegetable

786
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,589
Why does the dog sniff,
if it is vegetable?

787
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,091
It must be meat

788
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,592
They are pure vegetarians

789
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:18,594
I have bought the milk cakes

790
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,596
Come upstairs with the water bottle

791
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,098
OK Sister

792
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:23,599
Did you hear? It is milk cake

793
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,101
Idiot, is milk cake
available at the biriyani shop?

794
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,109
I got the leg

795
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,610
One leg for you and one for me

796
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,112
Don't shout

797
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,113
In case mom watches us
we may have to enact a weeping

798
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:39,615
Eat silently

799
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,117
See they are smashing chicken thighs

800
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,618
I told you, did you believe me?

801
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,621
It's our house,
how could you come upstairs?

802
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,623
I will shout

803
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,125
Let your mom come over here

804
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,626
Let her know about
the chicken biriyani secrets

805
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,129
Will you eat only the leg piece?

806
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,130
Is this biriyani called milk cake?

807
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,633
When you can make idli,a rice meal

808
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,135
and make the beer as butter milk

809
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,136
Shouldn't they make
biriyani as milk cake?

810
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,638
I am asking you

811
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,641
From when did you start this?

812
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,143
When studying at 12th standard

813
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:10,145
My friends fooled me
by giving chicken as yam

814
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,148
I liked the taste
and continuing since then

815
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,150
Got a story for every mischief

816
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,652
Two packets a day

817
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,156
If a packet costs 40 Rs
2400 Rs per month

818
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,657
If a person who draws 4500 Rs salary..

819
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,159
..marries you how could he afford it?

820
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,160
This should be a matter
of concern for her fiance

821
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,163
Why does he bother about it?

822
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,164
I am not eating it daily

823
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,166
Once in a week, 4 times a month

824
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,168
It costs only 320 Rs

825
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,672
Is spending 320 Rs a month
for wife an extravagance?

826
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,174
Give the salary to me

827
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,675
I will show how to run the family

828
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,669
Besides I don't eat on Saturdays
and am fasting

829
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,682
Fasting on Saturdays
and on Sundays you eat like a glutton...

830
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,184
will it not affect your health?

831
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,685
As if you are married and begot children

832
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,687
You two talk about
income and expenditures?

833
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,690
What is this talk while eating?

834
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,192
Get out

835
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,196
Peoples' party's State executive meeting

836
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,698
welcomes all participants

837
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,701
-Long live
-leader

838
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,204
Leader, I am 55 years old

839
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:09,705
Can I change my career now?

840
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,707
Helped the party grow by pasting posters

841
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,209
and hosting flags

842
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,710
But has the party helped me to grow?

843
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,713
Talk about the party problems only

844
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,215
This too is a party problem

845
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,216
You are the party leader
and you stay at Chennai

846
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,719
Besides your brother is the MLA of Kovai

847
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,222
He is the district secretary too

848
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,223
Call from the leader

849
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,725
Brother

850
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,228
If you grab all
the portfolios then where do we go?

851
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,229
That's why we have
given various honorifics

852
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,231
Iike Lightning warrior,
Thunderbolt, downpour

853
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,234
Keep those honorifics
with you and give us positions

854
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,237
Throw your brother
from district secretary's post

855
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,239
Else people will talk about
our party as one run by

856
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,741
money lenders and sundry arbitrators...

857
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,743
The party will vanish
from your own constituency too

858
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,247
When will that fellow come?

859
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,748
Usually he comes by car

860
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:56,252
He must get down
at least thrice to urinate

861
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,254
We must finish him
on his way to Kovai from Erode

862
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,265
Stop

863
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,768
Stop

864
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,318
Come, my leg piece

865
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,812
Mani, come here

866
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,826
Come Mani

867
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,332
Do you want leg piece?
That too from Anganna's shop

868
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,334
You tell lies too

869
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,338
If you are angry,
it is the temple bell (kovil mani)

870
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:23,839
You are going to draw
the design on floor (kola mani)

871
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,341
Hello agnate

872
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:26,842
You are ringing the bell with bell (mani)

873
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,344
Yes

874
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,345
Single bell for
the neck of buffalo (otha mani)

875
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,347
Twin bells for
the neck of mother-in-law(rettai mani)

876
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:33,849
For the concubine
give pearl (muthu mani)...

877
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,351
If you fall flat it is
the apple of throat (chanku mani)

878
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:36,852
For kids it is anklet (kolusu mani)

879
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:38,354
If bell rings in jail it is food time

880
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,355
- Great actor Sivaji ganesan acted in
- Alayamani

881
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,357
I will take leave of you Thankamani

882
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:49,354
Iittle cuckoo, you walk like a peacock

883
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:50,866
Where is my pair?

884
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,868
Why do you sing
as cuckoo...ooo, my darling

885
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,371
-Dear
-What?

886
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:56,872
Will you sing all songs?

887
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,374
-Which song you want?

888

890
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,370
Darling, your lover

891
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,386
Darling are you OK, here I am OK

892
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,887
Stop it

893
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,391
Poetry flows as I peep you

894
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,393
As I try to write it, words struggle

895
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,396
As I look at you, poetry downpours

896
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:25,389
What you are yelling Mani?

897
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,403
Will you sing songs with the words Mani?

898
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,905
Will you sing?

899
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,407
What is the matter?

900
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,408
Kanmani is in marriageable age

901
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,911
We have to accumulate
jewels for her marriage

902
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,413
Yes

903
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:38,914
Her dad has sent 30,000 Rs from Rangoon

904
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,417
Please make a coin necklace
in 8 sovereign gold

905
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,418
Sure, we can make it perfectly

906
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:49,414
First time you are making jewels
why do you do in 8 sovereigns?

907
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,426
Better do it in 1 1 sovereigns of gold

908
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,430
Add 3 sovereigns extra and make it

909
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,932
when you have said, it is done

910
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,437
- Look there
- What is this?

911
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,952
Why do you stay looking at?

912
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,454
Keep quiet

913
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:19,955
Beat

914
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,457
Lift him

915
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,469
Why do we invite trouble?

916
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:35,971
In broad day light
they have beaten and dragged him away

917
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,473
Do you want me to keep quiet?

918
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:38,974
-So, will you dare an MLA?
-ls MLA a special creature?

919
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,976
He is the MLA in this constituency
for the last 1 2 years

920
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,480
Has he done anything good?
Atleast one voter should question him

921
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,481
If all of you hide in front of him
he will behave only like this

922
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,485
He brutally assaults
all those who question him

923
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,487
To vacate us he has instigated
Hindu -Muslim communal riots

924
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:53,989
But no one did fall a prey to his designs

925
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,992
This annoyed him and he has
stopped water and electricity supplies

926
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,495
The entire lot is against the MLA

927
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,496
and are waiting for
a chance to exhibit their anger

928
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:02,998
They will subdue only if opposed

929
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,009
If you want water,
take it from the adjacent house

930
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,011
If you want electricity
take it from the opposite house

931
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,013
Inspector Ramanathan is coming

932
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:19,515
-Greetings
-To hell with your greetings

933
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,517
Leader is expected in
2 days time to inagurate party office

934
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,019
Security measures must be foolproof

935
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,021
Pollachi Road, Vincent Road
and Town hall Road

936
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,523
All these roads must be blocked

937
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,524
Pollachi Road and Vincent Road are OK

938
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,026
It's hard to block the Town hall road

939
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,028
It's very crowded and can not be blocked

940
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:34,530
Won't you obey me?

941
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,032
I am sorry sir, public may
create problems over this...

942
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,034
Get out if you don't obey me

943
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,036
Get out

944
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,539
Ask him to get out from here

945
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,540
Don't stay before me, get out

946
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,544
What do you think of me?

947
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,548
I am an MLA

948
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:58,543
Wait,l have been waiting for you

949
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,055
Kanmani has correspondence exam today

950
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,559
Bharathiar university is on your enroute
Please drop her there

951
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,060
Come on

952
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,563
She doesn't know the bus routes properly
might even get lost

953
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,565
Don't fall on the way,
I can't answer your mom then

954
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:20,565
Don't forget to pick me up
while you return home

955
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,577
Can I keep my hand on your shoulder?

956
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,579
I have an esteem in this area
Don't damage it

957
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,581
No grips to hold, then how can I sit?

958
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,083
There are no speed breakers on the way

959
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:29,585
Also I am not going to drive fast

960
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,086
-Sit 2 inches away
-OK

961
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,588
Are you in love with someone?

962
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,089
If you do silly talking

963
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,592
I will demand fare
more than the meter reading

964
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,094
I am loving a guy

965
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,598
Hey bell, if someone gets you
biriyani, you will go with him

966
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,600
-Are you in love?
-Start, it's getting late

967
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,103
These days it's hard to
distinguish good and bad

968
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,105
Can't find
who drinks alcohol and uses drugs

969
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,607
Can't find who is a terrorist

970
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,608
Don't get trapped, tell me who he is?

971
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,111
I will find out whether he is good or bad

972
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,614
-He is from which area?
-Ukkadam -Where in Ukkadam?

973
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,115
-Sannathi street
-That's our street!

974
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,618
Is it that corner house Pandi
or neighbor Kannan?

975
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,619
Or is it that
fat ugly fellow with french beard?

976
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,622
-No, it's the opposite house
-Opposite house?

977
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,627
-That's our house!Oh that must be Thankam

978
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,630
Has he trapped you
by showing silver anklet?

979
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,631
It's neither gold nor brass

980
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,133
Who will love that black man?

981
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,635
Then, I am there in the opposite house

982
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,636
-ls that me?
-Yes

983
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:26,631
I love you
I won't come behind if buy me a biriyani

984
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,644
Make me an ornamental belt
I will come after you

985
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:47,662
You have fallen in love!

986
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,167
You have fallen in love!

987
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,672
I will make an ornamental belt
for you, will you come?

988
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,174
Will you give me some place to stick on?

989
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,181
I will make an ornamental belt
for you, will you come?

990
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,684
Will you give me some place to stick on?

991
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,186
Why do I need an ornamental belt?

992
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,689
Don't you have two hands
to put around my waist?

993
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:18,182
Darling with beautiful nose and eyes
The best bet for kisses

994
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:23,188
Shall I measure your chest
and give a pearl necklace?

995
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:28,192
One in great heights,
and beau with lucky moles...

996
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,697
While you measure
the chest, touch a little

997
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:37,702
Oh silver pot, golden chain
turn to this 'chiyaan' side

998
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:42,206
If given a chance, will come & strike
This is Coimbatore mischief

999
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,720
I will make an ornamental belt
for you, will you come?

1000
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,222
Will you give me some place to stick on?

1001
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,725
Why do I need an ornamental belt?

1002
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,227
Don't you have two hands
to put around my waist?

1003
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,753
Melting pure gold, placing a star stone

1004
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,267
I will get you
an ornament for your forehead

1005
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,770
Will you be after me?

1006
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,272
Ornament for forehead is not necessary

1007
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,274
Blue stone too is not necessary

1008
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,268
Will you sport
the 'kumkum' dot on my forehead?

1009
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:49,273
Shall I bore your sharp nose
for pearl nose screws, will you come?

1010
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,287
Your pearl nose screw won't work out

1011
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,289
Will you come to rub nose to nose?

1012
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,791
I will give you the golden ear stud

1013
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,294
Will you come with your bod?

1014
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:04,289
Whisper the auspicious date
in the ear that wears the stud

1015
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,434
I will make an ornamental belt
for you, will you come?

1016
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,804
Will you give me some place to stick on?

1017
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,306
Why do I need an ornamental belt?

1018
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,809
Don't you have two hands
to put around my waist?

1019
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:08,352
I will make silver toe rings
and golden anklets....

1020
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,866
will you come with me?

1021
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:15,860
To come along with you,
no need for anklets

1022
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,364
Will you touch my toe
with your toe like a crab?

1023
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:25,369
Hey lady, I will give bangles
for your hands, will you come?

1024
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:30,374
Don't want bangles, will come now
will you give your right hand?

1025
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,379
I will give you a golden chain,
will you give a little bit?

1026
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:39,883
If you will give the sacred thread
I will peel of myself for you

1027
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,889
I will make an ornamental belt
for you, will you come?

1028
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,904
Don 't you have two hands
to put around my waist?

1029
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,398
Darling with beautiful nose and eyes
The best bet for kisses

1030
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:59,404
Shall I measure your chest
and give a pearl necklace?

1031
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:04,408
One in great heights,
and beau with lucky moles...

1032
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:08,913
While you measure
the chest, touch a little

1033
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,417
Oh silver pot, golden chain
turn to this 'chiyaan' side

1034
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,931
If given a chance,
will come and strike

1035
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,933
Let us not do that mischief here

1036
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,963
I don't like love and such affairs

1037
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,964
I have not moved
with you with such intentions

1038
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,467
I considered you as a friend
Don't talk to me hereafter

1039
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:53,969
Wait a minute

1040
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:55,970
I can understand, if you don't like me

1041
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,972
But why do you ask me
not to talk with you?

1042
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,974
Have I behaved so badly with you?

1043
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,479
No, if you had that in mind once
it may not be alright

1044
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:05,981
Why not?

1045
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,484
You considered me as a friend
You remain as a friend

1046
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:10,986
I will continue to love you

1047
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,988
If you feel like loving me,
you can change yourself

1048
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,490
In case if I feel like become a friend

1049
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:16,992
I will change myself

1050
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:23,998
But, I will never change

1051
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,008
They drive as if
this street is a high way

1052
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,010
Ruling party men will do only like that

1053
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,012
Their car procession
will become a funeral procession

1054
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,514
Hi Arul, come Arul

1055
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,516
Why they have pasted the poster here?

1056
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,520
They are opening the party office
from morning it is a nuisance

1057
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,522
It was whitewashed
for next week's marriage

1058
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,025
See how dirty it looks
Keep quiet or it may cause trouble

1059
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,528
Why do you do that?
Let the cattle eat it

1060
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,532
Lighting arrangements are over

1061
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,034
From where do we take power connection?

1062
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:00,535
I will connect it from lyer's house

1063
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,544
Hello, who are you?
You enter he house just like that

1064
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,046
Where is the main board?
Why do you ask?

1065
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,048
For power should l
insert it in your...........?(CENSORED)

1066
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,051
Why do you talk like that?

1067
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,560
You have assaulted my men
Wait, I will show you

1068
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,062
-They have beaten me
-Who?

1069
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,564
When I went to connect power
They have beaten me

1070
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,569
We did not do anything wrong
They have come and beaten us

1071
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,071
Those are the guys

1072
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,581
Connect the other end
of the wire to the bunk shop

1073
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,598
Our government gives you the power supply

1074
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,600
Will it affect
if we take little power?

1075
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,637
Are you giving electric shock?

1076
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:58,153
Who is Arul?
That's me

1077
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:00,154
-Get into the vehicle
-What for?

1078
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,157
Sitting on the wall, do you eve tease?

1079
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:05,159
Don't talk unnecessarily

1080
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:06,661
We have received a complaint
Who gave?

1081
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,165
Should I explain it
all on the road? Come, get in

1082
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,171
Get down

1083
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,173
Why do you bring me here?

1084
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,176
For us police, court,
advocate, judge are all our MLA

1085
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,178
You may take me to
the police station for inquiry

1086
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,681
With whom do you talk about rules?
You debris eating dog

1087
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,184
-Look at me and repeat it
-You debris eating dog

1088
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,688
Look at my eyes and say that
-You debris eating dog

1089
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,193
Brother please don't

1090
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,194
Be a police don't be a vandal

1091
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,697
Leader is coming for
opening the party office

1092
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,199
This guy belongs to that area

1093
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:47,202
Let us handle him
once the leader's visit is over

1094
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:48,703
I will kill you

1095
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:01,716
Go

1096
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,721
Come,let us go

1097
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,227
Why did you bring here
without taking him to station?

1098
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,230
Sir, the MLA...
Is the MLA giving you salary?

1099
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,231
This uniform has a dignity

1100
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,245
-Long live
-Leader

1101
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,750
-Long live
-Leader

1102
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,771
What is this bandage?
Had a fall

1103
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,273
Shouldn't you be careful?

1104
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:03,767
-That is Singanallur Rajavelu
-How are you Rajavelu?

1105
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,281
I am fine
He remembers my name too!

1106
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,297
I am not asking you not to meet friends

1107
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,289
Why do you sit
on the wall and invite trouble?

1108
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,303
Please don't get
perturbed unnecessarily, bye

1109
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,308
I want to talk with you

1110
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:35,810
What?

1111
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,812
Please don't sit
on the compound wall again

1112
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:40,315
Will you not listen to your friend?

1113
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:45,309
When you were caught by police
I couldn't sleep throughout night

1114
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,321
I felt like crying

1115
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,325
I cried, don't know, why?

1116
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,829
I was more concerned about your safety

1117
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:02,827
I said I will try to become a friend
But I could not..

1118
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,339
seems it may not be possible

1119
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:12,847
- Will you change instead?
- Go home

1120
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:18,842
-When you grow up what will you study?
-I'll study for prime minister

1121
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,858
Gajapathy, you are trying to
bring under control Coimbatore

1122
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,361
But your daughter is trying for lndia

1123
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:30,854
Uncle, if sister was alive now

1124
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,369
This house would have been
blessed with two more kids

1125
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:39,864
No,These children are there
to take care of the last stages

1126
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,878
For me, my brother is everything...

1127
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,382
Bye

1128
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,888
We have negotiated
the price for Ganapathy theatre

1129
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,890
The intelligence
you show in buying property..

1130
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,892
-..must be there in
keeping the accounts too - OK

1131
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:07,392
- Leader
- Long live

1132
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:08,698
- Tell me where is he?
- Anthony street...

1133
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,908
Dear, Wait for a moment
Give it

1134
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,911
You may go now

1135
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:33,928
Start the vehicle

1136
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,435
Coming 28th is an auspicious day

1137
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,437
The ceremony at
our temple too is on that day

1138
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,442
- We have informed all our relatives
- What is the function?

1139
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:52,936
Our family deity is in Chethumadai
There is an annual festival

1140
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,451
It will be very special for 2 days
All of you must come without fail

1141
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,459
- Come - Brother, going to buy
clothes for marriage, you also come

1142
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,461
We are buying dress for you too
You come and select it yourself

1143
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,463
You go, we will come by bike

1144
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:21,465
Find out where he is
Where is he?

1145
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,478
Sir, why are you doing like this?

1146
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,481
What do you want?
Why do they break everything?

1147
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,985
How dare he touches our men?

1148
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,988
- Are you so gutsy?
- He is not here

1149
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,491
How many children have you begotten?

1150
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,993
Don't hit him
He doesn't know anything

1151
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,496
Prepare the bier with green plantain tree
I will send your son's corpse

1152
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,997
Come

1153
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:53,508
-Where are those boys?
- Gone to Maharaja textiles to buy dresses

1154
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,012
Is it a marriage at your friend's home?

1155
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,014
-How is your dad?
-He is fine

1156
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,526
That one is better than the blue

1157
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,535
Greetings Sir
Please be seated

1158
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,037
A minor problem, have come to clear that

1159
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,543
Why the MLA is
sitting in the opposite shop?

1160
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,549
The MLA is sitting in your shop
What is the matter?

1161
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:39,542
- Has a boy named Arul, come there?
- Yes, son of Balan goldsmith

1162
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,056
They are waiting to
beat him up when he comes out

1163
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,059
- Please go upstairs
- No, we have made our purchase

1164
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:49,553
No, all of you go upstairs
wait for 1 0 minutes, listen, go

1165
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,065
Take them upstairs
and provide them seats

1166
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,573
- Hello, is it Balan goldsmith?
- Yes

1167
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:02,076
MLA has come to assault your son
If you come now, we can pacify him

1168
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:06,570
Even if they beat him to death
Please don't inform me

1169
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,588
-Brother, you start immediately
- You asked us to go upstairs

1170
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,089
Now you want us to leave immediately
What is the problem?

1171
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:18,092
MLA is waiting outside to beat you

1172
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,599
I called and asked your dad to come
Dad...

1173
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,601
What did he say?
Tell me

1174
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,104
He said no need to inform him,
even if you die

1175
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,112
Senthil, What happened?

1176
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,615
The MLA and his men came
and damaged the workshop

1177
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,617
They have beaten our dad too

1178
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:46,120
Did they beat dad?

1179
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,123
-Arul don't go
-Leave me -Listen

1180
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:51,626
Whatever happens,
none of you should come out, go

1181
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,627
- Let us not
- Go in, do what I say

1182
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,684
-I will..
-Brother, you just sit here

1183
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,756
How dare you touch the MLA?

1184
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,761
Have you beaten my dad?

1185
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,762
How dare you touch my dad?

1186
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,812
How unfairly they have beaten you up?

1187
01:21:58,346 --> 01:21:59,813
B-1 Police Station
Ukkadam

1188
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:10,324
MLA Gajapathy came to beat me
I have hit him back

1189
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:11,826
So I surrender

1190
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:19,333
The MLA is already dead

1191
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,338
- Who hit him?
- Someone called Arul Kumaran

1192
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:33,347
INTERMlSSlON

1193
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:39,842
MLA's party men and
the press are anxiously waiting..

1194
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:42,356
..to know his condition
What can we tell them?

1195
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:49,853
- I will tell them
- Sir what happened?

1196
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,869
Your husband is alright

1197
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,872
All of you need not worry

1198
01:22:58,406 --> 01:22:59,873
I will give you
all details after one hour

1199
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,378
Doctor, why did you lie to them?

1200
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:06,881
He is very bad
The guy who has hit him, Arul is good

1201
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,884
If the cause of death is revealed

1202
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:11,885
Arul's life will be spoilt by litigations

1203
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,880
So, we must create an atmosphere
for two days that he is alive

1204
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,393
All of you must co-operate for that

1205
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:21,896
-As a professional...?
-lt is not a betrayal

1206
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,398
It is wrong to say someone alive as dead

1207
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:28,391
Nothing wrong in saying
the dead as alive to save a good man

1208
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:30,404
Connect the ventilator immediately

1209
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:34,898
It may look as if he is breathing
Start lV fluid drips

1210
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,411
Connect the ECG of
some other patient to the monitor

1211
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:39,413
Find out his blood group
and hang a bottle

1212
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,433
-What is the case?
-Sir, he has beaten the MLA

1213
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:03,926
- Why did you beat?
- He hit me, I hit him back

1214
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:07,941
So you have hit him
for self defense, is that so?

1215
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,447
-Under what section he is booked?
-Under 307, attempt to murder

1216
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:15,950
The beaten MLA is still alive

1217
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,453
He has beaten for self defense

1218
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,956
File it as
grievous hurt under section 324

1219
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:37,961
Leader, MLA beaten up on the road badly

1220
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:48,482
Uncle..

1221
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,990
No one should touch him in this condition

1222
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,490
Don't cry
Nothing will happen to my brother

1223
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:12,006
Did you see your brother, how is he?

1224
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,509
No problem for my brother
He is fine

1225
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,012
Your MLA will be back soon
Don't worry

1226
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,013
-Where is he?
-He is in the police station

1227
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,528
Leader, he is the one

1228
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:44,027
How dare you touch my brother?
I will kill you here itself

1229
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,541
- Open the door
- No sir, keep quiet

1230
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:50,044
- It will be a problem if I let him out
- Won't you listen to me

1231
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,548
Please be patient
The Press and TV personnel are there outside

1232
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,142
They will exaggerate and defame us
Please be patient

1233
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,554
You have tilted my brother
who stood like a mountain

1234
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:03,057
You are staying alive
only because he is alive now

1235
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,560
If anything happens to him
I will burn you inside the prison...

1236
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:09,062
You went inside to meet him
What did he say?

1237
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,565
You met the one who hit your brother
What happened?

1238
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,568
Nothing
That boy expressed his regret

1239
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,071
Don't blow this
out of proportion, leave it

1240
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:22,076
Isn't he your son?
Won't you try to release him?

1241
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,077
You can meet him at least to console

1242
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:27,081
Mom, why all of you are silent?

1243
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,085
No one from this house will go to see him

1244
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:37,581
Because they are all good
Only he is bad

1245
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,095
He is bad

1246
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,597
I can't undertake this case
Please leave me

1247
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:46,600
- If you decide to help him.....
- First you go away from here

1248
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,604
- Sister, this is Senthil speaking
- What is the matter?

1249
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,107
Brother is caught in a police case
That is why brother in law..

1250
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,109
Oh God! He has gone to
attend a meeting in Villupuram

1251
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:59,112
He will be back in the morning
I will bring him as soon as he comes

1252
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:02,115
- Senthil, What happened?
- He is not in station

1253
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,120
All advocates refuse to come
They are afraid

1254
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,122
They will take you
to jail tomorrow morning

1255
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:13,115
In a fix, called Thiruppathy uncle,
he is not in station

1256
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:15,128
Why did you inform him?
We didn't inform

1257
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:19,121
-Kanmani & Senthil informed them
-Fortunately nothing happened to MLA

1258
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:22,636
-Else it could have been a big problem
-MLA died -What are you saying?

1259
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:27,141
When I dragged his body itself,
his pulse stopped

1260
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:32,134
God is helping me in some form
Nothing will happen to me

1261
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,647
You may go

1262
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,150
Tirupathi, don't worry

1263
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,151
- I will arrange for bail through
our company's advocate - OK

1264
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,654
Balakrishnan, I am Ramasamy speaking

1265
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,656
Must go to
Coimbatore immediately, come soon

1266
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:44,658
Doctor, what are you
going to write in the report?

1267
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:46,660
In their caste do they bury or cremate?

1268
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,163
They will cremate

1269
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:06,179
Mourning for Gajapathy

1270
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:17,691
Come let's go

1271
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,698
- Greetings
- Come Tirupathi

1272
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:28,202
I saw the FlR
filed under section 324, grevious hurt

1273
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:32,695
With 50000 Rs & 2 ration cards
we can easily bail him out by evening

1274
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:36,699
-Arrange for money first
-Thankam, I have only 1 0000 Rs

1275
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,212
Go home and get 40000 Rs

1276
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:41,214
40000 Rs?
Whose money it is?

1277
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:43,717
Am I working as
a gold smith in Coimbatore..

1278
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:45,219
..or printing counterfeit currencies?

1279
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:48,722
Let him stay behind bars for 1 year
Let us see if he reforms

1280
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:53,215
Are you all dumb?
Can't you tell him to give money?

1281
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:57,720
He is also your brother
What harm has he done to you?

1282
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:12,246
Please take it
Why do you..?

1283
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:15,248
It is alright, please take it
Have it

1284
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,269
On condition the accused
Arul Kumaran must report to the..

1285
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:39,261
..concerned police station
& sign registers, I release him on bail

1286
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:42,276
- Uncle
- Yeah

1287
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,278
Our advocate has fired
the plaintiff's advocate like anything

1288
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,281
- Dr.Viswanathan only helped us..
- Get an auto

1289
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,284
Why an auto?
Our vehicle is there

1290
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,787
Your job is over
I will take care of the rest, you go

1291
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:57,780
Why do you send home now?
Are you concerned about my family?

1292
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,293
Please listen to me

1293
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:03,285
I know you can counter
1 0 opponents simultaneously

1294
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,298
But whom have you beaten this time?

1295
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,301
-Brother of the one who holds
the reign of this state -You are right

1296
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:12,294
The proverb 'with uncle's help
you can climb hill' is right, come on

1297
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,312
Come dear

1298
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:23,306
How did you stay for
4 days inside the police station?

1299
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:25,318
I am not worried about
4 days confinement

1300
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:27,821
No one came to
see me at least for one day

1301
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,824
That makes me sad
what wrong I have done?

1302
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,326
If I haven't hit him,
he would have killed me

1303
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:36,318
- Then would you all been happy?
- Don't talk like that son

1304
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,332
Dad did not give money to bail me out

1305
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:42,324
Mom, I have given my salary
4500 every month to you

1306
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,839
You could have given from that
Did I eat for the entire amount?

1307
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,344
You will never overrule your hubby

1308
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,846
There is no place in this house
for those who have gone to the jail

1309
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,348
Ask him to go out

1310
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,851
Is this a family?
You have some defect in your tongue

1311
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,853
But for your dad
the entire body is defective

1312
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:03,356
If one does not help
his son in distress, is he a dad?

1313
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:05,358
- Tell that to him
- Those who have driven their wife..

1314
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:06,860
..out of home is talking about morals

1315
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,862
There is nothing wrong in
a hubby beating his wife

1316
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:11,365
But the hubby should guard her
when a third person tries to beat her

1317
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:16,359
Neither your dad
nor these stoopers will understand

1318
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,372
Don't look down and blow all the time

1319
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,375
At times look up also, you will know
whether the crow is excreting

1320
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,377
or the vulture drops the snake

1321
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:28,370
None of you have concern even to
the extent of girl in opposite house

1322
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,389
Whenever I quarrel with him
I used to tell him, I have 4 brothers..

1323
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:36,890
..and they will let you go scot free

1324
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:40,394
If I trust you all,
I will be on the streets

1325
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:45,388
For my kids, there is only one
maternal uncle and that is Arul only

1326
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:49,391
-Ask your hubby to leave for Tiruppur
-Of course we are leaving

1327
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:51,404
Don't think we are
going to stay here and dine

1328
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:53,907
Go and bring the kids
come brother-in-law

1329
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:55,409
Wait

1330
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,413
He has come from jail
He should not land in problems again

1331
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,915
All his bad days should be over
he should have a holy shower

1332
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,918
Without doing this,
all of you are firing him, you sit down

1333
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:30,432
My son will stay here only
He will not go anywhere

1334
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,449
Come, we are waiting for you only

1335
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:41,455
For an ordinary ear boring ceremony
You have sent a car for me

1336
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:45,447
You are great subbiah
For whom I should do?

1337
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:47,460
-lt is for my mother
-For your mother?

1338
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,463
-What is her age?
-70 -70?

1339
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:53,466
She wanted to do at
a very young age, but couldn't do it

1340
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:56,970
- Now we want to do it
-You want to fulfill your mom's desire..

1341
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:58,972
..even when she is 70 years old

1342
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:01,975
You are not an ordinary son
Great son of a mother

1343
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,478
Son who doesn't disobey mother
Son who has saved the mother

1344
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,981
- Just a minute,
let me also dance my part -Be quick

1345
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:15,489
Come before the auspicious time is over

1346
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,490
Yes, yes, come quick

1347
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,496
-What is this?
-She is my mother

1348
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:25,999
For whom did you ask to do nose boring?

1349
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,002
- For my mother only
- Did you bring me to do for a corpse?

1350
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:32,005
- Are you calling my mother a corpse?
- What else can I say?

1351
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,508
Are you calling it a corpse?
Come do it

1352
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:41,014
Leader

1353
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:46,509
-Arul has come out on bail
-Even before my brother's rites are over..

1354
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:48,021
How did he come out on bail?

1355
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,525
Court has said
he has not died due to the hits

1356
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,027
-What are you saying?
-ln the doctor certificate...

1357
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:56,530
What is written in doctor certificate?

1358
01:33:57,064 --> 01:34:01,023
Because he used to drink heavily,
liver failure has caused the death

1359
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:02,536
Oh God!

1360
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:09,532
He doesn't drink because of that
he didn't auction any wine shop

1361
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:13,046
Some mistake has happened

1362
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:16,550
Hey, who is the doctor
who made that report? Bring him

1363
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:23,056
Where is your chief doctor?

1364
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:28,550
But for you,l would have been
tormented by litigation

1365
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:32,566
- My life would have been spoiled
- Someone will help good people

1366
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,068
I might be one among them, that is all

1367
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:37,571
Come

1368
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:43,076
Ruling party men came
searching for you here

1369
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:45,078
Now they might be
on their way to your home

1370
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,581
- Be alert doctor
- OK

1371
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:53,587
Immediately lodge a complaint
with police that Sethupathy's men..

1372
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,089
..have damaged your property
and has made an attempt on your life

1373
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:57,591
I will deal with the rest
Come

1374
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:02,095
Bring stones and sticks

1375
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:12,606
Break everything

1376
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:23,617
Arul what is all this?

1377
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:28,121
Oh God, dear

1378
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:38,631
What is all this?
It is all broken

1379
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,669
Commissioner, what does that
inspector think about himself?

1380
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,172
Knowing pretty well, they are my men
He has arrested them

1381
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:22,676
Ask him to release them immediately
FlR is filed, public has also seen

1382
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,678
He is not an ordinary man and is
equivalent to a sub collector in rank

1383
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:29,182
He is the Government hospital dean
This government is mine, don't you know?

1384
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,686
I will produce him in
court tomorrow and bail him out

1385
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,189
Please don't interfere in that
doctor's matter, it'll become a big issue

1386
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:40,694
Send any number of persons

1387
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:43,696
Tomorrow morning
I should get the news that Arul is dead

1388
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:49,692
Should we go for
their family deity function?

1389
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,698
He didn't agree to your proposal
He has come from jail now

1390
01:36:57,244 --> 01:37:00,702
You only think
about him always, leave him

1391
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:06,708
- I will leave, this world
- Sister

1392
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:09,722
That world (Heaven) is not for
those without GRACE

1393
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:14,227
For those with no money, this world....

1394
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:20,222
I will not come to the temple
My esteem has been damaged here

1395
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:24,727
In my native place, in front of
relatives, should I get disgraced?

1396
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:28,241
The court has acquitted him
then why does he shout like this?

1397
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:30,744
I will not come to a place
where he is present

1398
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:34,247
I don't know what sin we committed
My son is suffering like this

1399
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,251
By not worshipping the family deity
Should we invite God's wrath again?

1400
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:40,754
Don't know what will happen
First quit this place & reach there safely

1401
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,758
- You have begot a fantastic uncle
- Was it me?

1402
01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:48,261
Uncle, he is not coming,
Let us go, come

1403
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:54,257
Get in, load it carefully

1404
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:56,769
Careful, child

1405
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:58,771
Wait, let everyone get in

1406
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:13,836
They stand like the yarn loaded on a loom
Shall we weave them?

1407
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:19,341
Go & tell your leader 1 000 men are
coming with wedges for him

1408
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:21,854
We will come and screw those wedges

1409
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:23,856
Get back with your life intact

1410
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:59,382
- Sethupathy
- Down down

1411
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:19,412
Are you surprised to hear shouts
against you in your own den?

1412
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:21,915
God will not tolerate atrocities for long

1413
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:24,417
Yesterday you have sent 1 0 persons
30 policemen came

1414
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,920
Today you have sent 1 00 persons
1 000 people have come

1415
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:29,422
Tomorrow you send 1 000 persons
In the same constituency..

1416
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:30,924
..I can make 1 lakh people assemble here
Do you want to see that?

1417
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,919
You can do that only in this place
I have 1 000 people in each place

1418
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:39,932
They are hired hands

1419
01:40:41,468 --> 01:40:44,926
All these people have
sacrificed one day's wages

1420
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:48,441
Look here I have no
enemity with your brother

1421
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,443
He came to hit me
I have hit him back

1422
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:51,945
That is all over
Leave at this

1423
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:54,947
Politics, property,
happiness, government, power

1424
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:57,950
It is all nothing
before my brother for me

1425
01:40:58,485 --> 01:41:00,953
You have killed him
I will not leave you

1426
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:04,946
The agony I suffered
must be felt by you daily

1427
01:41:05,492 --> 01:41:09,451
I want to see you lit the
funeral pyre for each member of your family

1428
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:14,467
Have you heard this?
Heard the echo for one shout of Arul?

1429
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:19,462
If he does it again, all of us will
enter your house and tear apart

1430
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:22,475
We have not come for fighting
Only for peace

1431
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,478
So control yourself and go in

1432
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:26,980
Go in

1433
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:31,985
He said something about the family

1434
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:34,987
He might say, don't take it seriously

1435
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:37,990
No you get back immediately

1436
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:48,001
Play a good tune fit for dancing
come on play it

1437
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:03,005
His family and entire kinship has
assembled at the temple festival

1438
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:06,018
Send Muthumari and finish him off

1439
01:42:17,064 --> 01:42:19,032
Come, are you coming only now?

1440
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,034
Are you fine?
Heard you got into some problem

1441
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:23,536
And you have hit some one

1442
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:25,038
Enough,even if you talk more
he will hit you

1443
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:27,039
Come, let us go and worship God

1444
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:30,043
How are you?
who are you?

1445
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,044
Muthu's brother in law
Muthu's brother in law?

1446
01:42:38,585 --> 01:42:40,553
Nothing will happen
But we must be alert

1447
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:43,055
You said, you won't come to the temple

1448
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:44,557
-But you have come
- What If I come?

1449
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:46,559
No, you said, you will not come
what if I said?

1450
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:48,061
No uncle
What do you mean by no,uncle?

1451
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:49,562
-Uncle
-what uncle?

1452
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:51,064
-Why, this to me?
-What do you mean by why this to me?

1453
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:52,565
-No uncle
-what, no uncle?

1454
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,067
-Gosh
-What gosh?

1455
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:55,568
-Aha
-what Aha?

1456
01:42:56,103 --> 01:42:57,070
I will smack you

1457
01:42:57,604 --> 01:42:59,071
-Worship God
-What do you mean by worship God?

1458
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,574
Smart guy, has become alert

1459
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:07,079
Was this girl not named so long?

1460
01:43:07,614 --> 01:43:08,581
They name her only now

1461
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:10,083
This is a tradition followed by us

1462
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:13,085
For newly married,before the family deity

1463
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:16,088
She will be named again, same name only

1464
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:19,592
After marriage,
you will also be named like this

1465
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:28,100
Why did he come here?
Has he come to defame me?

1466
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:30,603
Ask him to go out
He said, he will not come

1467
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,106
But he has come,
but how can we send him out?

1468
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,107
Will he not keep quiet?

1469
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:36,609
If you put stone mortar in his mouth
he will keep quiet

1470
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:38,111
But he will not
keep quiet, when he sees Arul

1471
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:44,105
Is it soup?
How about the cooking?

1472
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:47,119
May I know who you are?
I am Muthu's brother in law

1473
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:48,621
I will take care, ok

1474
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,627
What he is doing beneath the palmyra tree

1475
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:57,630
Tell this black chap what are you doing?

1476
01:43:58,165 --> 01:43:59,132
We are selling palmyra sap
would you like to have?

1477
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:01,133
Does it include lime
It does not

1478
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:03,636
Then it is toddy,
give him a mug, let him drink

1479
01:44:04,171 --> 01:44:06,139
We have to get back to temple, don't drink

1480
01:44:06,673 --> 01:44:08,641
If drinking is defilement
Bathing is the cure for it

1481
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:13,635
Not only that your dad
scolded you in front of all

1482
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:19,152
-You might bear it
But we can't bear it -Then die

1483
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:20,653
Pour some more

1484
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:24,157
Even if he calls me an
oilcake I don't mind

1485
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:27,660
Is there a dad who
doesn't admonish the children?

1486
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:39,172
Even if he calls me a clod
I don't mind

1487
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:43,164
After all my dad called me so, so what?

1488
01:44:51,218 --> 01:44:54,187
Even if dad's club criticizes, never mind

1489
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,690
You can react like U.N.

1490
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:01,683
Kinship is always testing

1491
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:05,687
Your dad would have been
kicked by his dad

1492
01:45:06,233 --> 01:45:09,691
If it is said to me,
looking at my eyes

1493
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:13,206
If it is not my dad
I will thrash him

1494
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,709
Even if he calls me an
oilcake I don't mind

1495
01:45:17,244 --> 01:45:20,702
Is there a dad who
doesn't admonish the children?

1496
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:24,217
Even if he calls me a clod
I don't mind

1497
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:28,221
After all my dad called me so, so what?

1498
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:10,752
July-August wind
will make even the grinding stone fly

1499
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:14,267
If your dad becomes nutty
his eyes will feel darkness

1500
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:17,770
The cow will kick the calf

1501
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:21,763
Even if it pains the calf
cries only as 'Ma'

1502
01:46:22,309 --> 01:46:25,278
If you are ill treated
it pains me

1503
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:29,270
Even 5 bottles have not
given me any stupor

1504
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,789
If the rails are not
in place, the train will derail

1505
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,293
If dad is not respected
entire life will become slippery

1506
01:46:40,827 --> 01:46:44,285
If it is said to me, looking at my eyes

1507
01:46:44,831 --> 01:46:47,800
If it is not my dad
I will thrash him

1508
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:51,304
Even if he calls me an
oilcake I don 't mind

1509
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:55,296
Is there a dad who
doesn 't admonish the children?

1510
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:58,811
Even if he calls me a clod
I don't mind

1511
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:04,807
After all my dad called me so, so what?

1512
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:37,350
The best toddy is
the toddy from a single tree

1513
01:47:37,884 --> 01:47:40,853
Fathers are always like that
Leave it buddy

1514
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:44,846
The best bow is that of Arjun

1515
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:48,428
The best word is that of dad

1516
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:52,353
The biggest tyre is that of the lorry

1517
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:56,357
The biggest snob is that of your dad

1518
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:03,876
What is between me and dad
is our private affair

1519
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:07,380
Whoever talk ill of this
will find their teeth flying

1520
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:10,883
If it is said to me, looking at my eyes

1521
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:14,876
If it is not my dad
I will thrash him

1522
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,399
Even if he calls me a clod
I don't mind

1523
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:29,902
After all my dad called me so, so what?

1524
01:48:30,437 --> 01:48:33,895
Even if dad's club criticizes, never mind

1525
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:37,410
You can react like U.N.

1526
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:41,402
Kinship is always testing

1527
01:48:41,948 --> 01:48:45,406
Your dad would have been
kicked by his dad

1528
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:48,921
If it is said to me, looking at my eyes

1529
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:52,425
If it is not my dad
I will thrash him

1530
01:48:56,463 --> 01:48:59,432
What were you doing?
I was just checking the salt level

1531
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:01,934
The 'pooja' is not yet over
why do you taste it before that?

1532
01:49:07,974 --> 01:49:10,442
Some guy said he is a relative
He has tasted the sambar

1533
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,946
What were you doing then?
What can I do?

1534
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:15,448
He said he is Muthu's brother in law

1535
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:18,450
I thought he is your relative
We thought he is your cook

1536
01:49:18,985 --> 01:49:21,453
What has happened?
A guy with towel was around here

1537
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:23,455
He has tasted the food and polluted it

1538
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,957
He claims, he is Muth's brother in law

1539
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:28,950
Muthu has no brother in law
Call uncle

1540
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:30,463
Might have done some mischief

1541
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:31,964
Must catch him and
inquire to know details

1542
01:49:32,999 --> 01:49:33,966
Search every where
You all go this side, search

1543
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:35,468
We are going towards bus stand

1544
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:40,472
Did anyone with a towel
come here? Looks like a cook

1545
01:49:41,007 --> 01:49:41,974
He just boarded the bus

1546
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:43,976
-Should have caught him
-Why should I catch him?

1547
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:45,478
Look at his explanation

1548
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:46,979
Don't waste time by talking
Quickly intercept the bus

1549
01:49:47,514 --> 01:49:48,481
Go fast

1550
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:59,492
Wait, It is said,
should not move when hit by a crow

1551
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:00,993
Get me a mug of water

1552
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:02,995
Seems the crow is in agony

1553
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,998
Must have consumed something

1554
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:08,501
Seems it has consumed rice

1555
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:12,505
Can't hear the drum beats
then 'pooja' is over

1556
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:14,006
Would have offered first food to the crow

1557
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:15,508
-Perhaps....
-You are right

1558
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,009
-Oh god...
-He has brought water

1559
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:24,005
Don't eat the food
Some one has poisoned the food

1560
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,519
Some party fellow might have done it
Don't eat

1561
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:29,021
Why do you torment me like this?

1562
01:50:29,556 --> 01:50:33,014
To kill you,
they would have killed 500 people?

1563
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,527
Who asked you to come here?

1564
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:37,529
I don't know what sin I have committed?

1565
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:40,532
All sins have come in your form

1566
01:50:41,067 --> 01:50:42,534
My honour and prestige has gone

1567
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:44,536
All because of him

1568
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:46,038
What are you talking?

1569
01:50:46,573 --> 01:50:48,040
Any other dad would have been proud

1570
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:49,542
If his son saves 500 lives

1571
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:54,035
But you are admonishing him
put the entire blame on him

1572
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:55,548
He has beaten the MLA,
because he has hit you

1573
01:50:56,082 --> 01:50:57,549
I have seen dad's who feel for..

1574
01:50:58,084 --> 01:51:00,052
..their ward even if he is a thief

1575
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,555
But I am seeing a dad here

1576
01:51:03,089 --> 01:51:05,057
who hates his son
who is like by all

1577
01:51:05,592 --> 01:51:06,559
Stop you young girl

1578
01:51:07,093 --> 01:51:09,061
His siblings are quiet

1579
01:51:09,596 --> 01:51:11,063
You talk loudly as if you
have shared his bed

1580
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:15,568
Dad

1581
01:51:18,104 --> 01:51:19,071
Don't cry

1582
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:21,573
Kanmani, don't cry

1583
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:05,606
Not sharing bed
But going to share life with me

1584
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:30,642
To kill our family,
he has targeted the whole village

1585
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:32,144
Will he keep quiet?

1586
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:35,648
Before he strikes us
We must strike him

1587
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:38,150
Then only he will have a fear over us

1588
01:52:38,685 --> 01:52:41,153
Don't worry
I can bring the entire Tiruppur to coimbatore

1589
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:54,166
Break the boards first

1590
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:02,675
Break everything

1591
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:07,179
If you hide, will we leave you?

1592
01:53:09,716 --> 01:53:11,183
Arul has entered
the party office and is assaulting all

1593
01:53:11,718 --> 01:53:13,185
What are you doing there?

1594
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,188
In the name of party
have you not swindled public money?

1595
01:53:16,723 --> 01:53:19,191
No one should be inside
Drive them all out

1596
01:53:21,728 --> 01:53:24,697
Thanks Arul
You have got back my house for me

1597
01:53:25,732 --> 01:53:27,199
This is the house document.

1598
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:29,702
Give back when I return from Delhi

1599
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:33,705
People's party office
has been encroached by you

1600
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,207
I have received complaints to this effect

1601
01:53:35,742 --> 01:53:37,710
We know, who has send you
And why you have come

1602
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:39,711
See this, the agreement
we have signed with the house owner

1603
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:51,724
Stop it

1604
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,227
He is asking us to vacate the shop

1605
01:53:55,762 --> 01:53:56,729
And is atrociously attacking us

1606
01:53:58,264 --> 01:54:01,233
If you extract money
in the name of exorbitant interest

1607
01:54:01,768 --> 01:54:03,235
I will kick you,
your leader and party men in the streets

1608
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:04,737
Go away

1609
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:17,750
In today's circumstances,
running the mill is very difficult

1610
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:21,253
Sethupathy's men demanded
party funds, election funds

1611
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:23,255
And has troubled us a lot

1612
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:24,757
Because we didn't give money
They have instigated

1613
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:26,758
Workmen to go on strike
against the management

1614
01:54:27,293 --> 01:54:29,761
They forced us to pay unwanted taxes

1615
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:31,763
Today Arul is opposing sethupathy

1616
01:54:32,298 --> 01:54:33,265
We must rally behind him

1617
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,268
Must provide him money and support

1618
01:54:36,803 --> 01:54:38,270
Look, the party office colour has changed

1619
01:54:38,805 --> 01:54:40,272
Take her inside

1620
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:46,278
What is all this?

1621
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:47,780
Though the marriage was not done formally

1622
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:49,781
We should honour the traditional routines

1623
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:51,283
Sit down

1624
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:52,785
Though my daughter has
gone for an independent house

1625
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:54,286
Her in law's place is this only

1626
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:58,290
When my son married
your daughter on that day

1627
01:54:59,325 --> 01:55:01,293
I was worried that you would block it

1628
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:03,796
on the grounds,
that he has been imprisoned

1629
01:55:04,831 --> 01:55:09,791
If I were to do that
I should do that for my hubby also

1630
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:12,804
Kanmani's dad is in Rangoon jail

1631
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:18,299
Two years ago, in a business scuffle

1632
01:55:18,845 --> 01:55:21,313
He attacked him and was jailed

1633
01:55:21,848 --> 01:55:23,816
Now my brother is
looking after that business

1634
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:25,317
Next year he will be released from jail

1635
01:55:26,352 --> 01:55:29,321
Till date, even my daughters
don't know about this

1636
01:55:31,858 --> 01:55:35,316
Who has not done wrongs?
Circumstances make them do so

1637
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:40,332
Auntie come,
Are you fine? - I am fine

1638
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:45,326
We have a tradition
to name the new daughter in law

1639
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:47,339
at our family temple

1640
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:51,332
What is it?
Before God, you would be named again

1641
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:53,345
when can we go?

1642
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:55,848
That is for those
who marry at a different place

1643
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:58,350
I have married her at our temple

1644
01:55:58,885 --> 01:55:59,852
That can be done later

1645
01:56:00,386 --> 01:56:01,353
-Not that
- Dear.. Iisten to me

1646
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:05,357
Aunty wants us
to do some naming at temple

1647
01:56:05,892 --> 01:56:06,859
Why do you refuse?

1648
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:10,362
Don't you know what it is?
I don't know

1649
01:56:10,897 --> 01:56:11,864
I will smack you

1650
01:56:12,398 --> 01:56:13,365
you were asking about it to sister in law

1651
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,368
How do you know that?

1652
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:19,872
I eavesdropped
Naughty guy

1653
01:56:20,406 --> 01:56:22,374
You have married me twice
Do you know?

1654
01:56:22,909 --> 01:56:24,877
-How?
-One is an yellow thread

1655
01:56:27,914 --> 01:56:29,381
And the other one a white thread

1656
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,888
Do you still keep it with you?

1657
01:56:39,926 --> 01:56:42,394
So far nothing good has happened
in our constituency

1658
01:56:42,929 --> 01:56:45,898
After his death,
now it is a good time for us

1659
01:56:46,432 --> 01:56:48,400
People need not get
loans for exorbitant interest

1660
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:49,902
and forego their property
against the loan,hereafter

1661
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:52,404
We should follow whatever Arul says

1662
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:54,406
If Arul is contesting against Sethupathy

1663
01:56:54,941 --> 01:56:56,408
It is good for Jeeva nagar people

1664
01:56:56,943 --> 01:56:59,912
If Arul has a problem
All of us should join together

1665
01:57:01,948 --> 01:57:03,916
You should
have weeded him out when he was a plant

1666
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:06,418
Now he has
grown like a tree and is opposing you

1667
01:57:07,453 --> 01:57:10,911
Ukkadam and
Jeeva nagar people support him

1668
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:12,925
Show him what will happen

1669
01:57:13,459 --> 01:57:14,426
If he opposes one in office

1670
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:16,929
Stop electricity, water,
ration & everything

1671
01:57:17,463 --> 01:57:18,930
Let them not have water for bathing

1672
01:57:19,465 --> 01:57:21,433
drinking and even in toilets
Let it stink

1673
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:24,436
He thinks, this will solve the problem

1674
01:57:25,972 --> 01:57:28,941
What is this?
whether is night or daytime, there is no power

1675
01:57:29,475 --> 01:57:31,443
EB people say,
if you oppose ruling party men

1676
01:57:31,978 --> 01:57:33,445
You will have to bear the consequences

1677
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,449
Water has stopped, what to do?

1678
01:57:37,984 --> 01:57:39,451
Grandma, is there no water here also?

1679
01:57:39,986 --> 01:57:40,953
No water at all

1680
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:43,455
Sit down

1681
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,957
What is the matter?

1682
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:46,458
There is no water
and electricity in our area

1683
01:57:46,993 --> 01:57:47,960
And we are suffering a lot

1684
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:49,961
This is all because of Sethupathy

1685
01:57:50,496 --> 01:57:52,964
You only have the courage
and boldness to oppose them

1686
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:54,966
You can bring light to us

1687
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:56,468
Yes I will take care

1688
01:58:11,017 --> 01:58:11,984
Give water

1689
01:58:19,025 --> 01:58:21,994
Are you not ashamed to say
nothing can be done

1690
01:58:23,029 --> 01:58:27,489
At the opportune time
set fire to the Jeeva nagar huts

1691
01:58:28,034 --> 01:58:30,502
If you do like this
no one will vote for us

1692
01:58:31,037 --> 01:58:33,005
We can cast those votes

1693
01:58:42,048 --> 01:58:44,016
All of you come quick

1694
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:46,017
They have set fire to huts

1695
01:59:02,068 --> 01:59:04,536
Save my child

1696
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:07,039
My house is on fire
save my child

1697
01:59:22,088 --> 01:59:24,556
Fortunately she came out and saw him

1698
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:27,059
Otherwise entire huts
would have been burnt

1699
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:32,064
That people's party men has set ablaze

1700
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:36,068
He has killed my child

1701
01:59:46,612 --> 01:59:48,580
Party leader Sethupathy
is coming to console

1702
01:59:57,123 --> 02:00:00,581
Stop there, if you step forward
I will cut off your legs

1703
02:00:01,627 --> 02:00:03,094
You have killed the child
Have you come now to console?

1704
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:05,597
After setting fire,
have you come to console?

1705
02:00:06,132 --> 02:00:09,101
Just because they support me,
you have burnt their house

1706
02:00:09,635 --> 02:00:11,603
If all of them unite,
do you know what will happen?

1707
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:13,105
Did I set fire?
what basis you say this?

1708
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:14,606
There is an eyewitness, to the incident

1709
02:00:15,141 --> 02:00:16,108
They have seen your man setting fire

1710
02:00:17,143 --> 02:00:18,110
You have named
your party as People's Party

1711
02:00:18,644 --> 02:00:20,111
What have you done for the people?

1712
02:00:21,147 --> 02:00:23,615
Because you are in power and in office
you are behaving like this

1713
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:28,120
You have killed my child
You will be doomed

1714
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:29,621
Have you seen this child?

1715
02:00:31,157 --> 02:00:34,126
Take it from me
If your party men contest here

1716
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:36,628
I will kill him, whoever he may be

1717
02:00:39,165 --> 02:00:44,125
I swear on this dead child, go away

1718
02:00:47,173 --> 02:00:49,641
I could have shot him
the other day when he has hit me

1719
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:54,135
But my dependent invalid,
30 year old sister and..

1720
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:55,647
Another sister who refuses to get married

1721
02:00:56,182 --> 02:00:57,149
When elder sister is yet to be married

1722
02:00:57,683 --> 02:01:03,144
have tied down me
I am tolerating their atrocities

1723
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:06,658
If they are alive,
no one can live peacefully

1724
02:01:07,193 --> 02:01:09,661
You are doing what I could not do
I am very happy about it

1725
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:13,665
Whatever help you need I will do

1726
02:01:17,203 --> 02:01:20,661
What is it you are thinking so seriously?
Nothing, 5000Rs is missing

1727
02:01:21,207 --> 02:01:23,675
-5000 missing, when?
-Yesterday night

1728
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:27,179
You claim you are
a union leader for 5000 people

1729
02:01:27,713 --> 02:01:29,180
Can't you keep 5000Rs safely?
Don't you have common sense?

1730
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:33,185
Have you found out who has taken it?
I have found out

1731
02:01:33,719 --> 02:01:36,187
Then kick him and get the money
He is a relative, so I am hesitant

1732
02:01:36,722 --> 02:01:39,190
Don't look for all this,
when he is doing this

1733
02:01:39,725 --> 02:01:40,692
Thrash him
so you want me to hit him

1734
02:01:41,227 --> 02:01:43,195
When you have said it,
why should I hesitate?

1735
02:01:43,729 --> 02:01:47,187
I have taken it
why didn't you say this earlier?

1736
02:01:47,733 --> 02:01:50,201
I was trying get away, but couldn't do it

1737
02:01:50,736 --> 02:01:51,703
What have you done with that money?

1738
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:53,205
I have purchased silver for Rs 5000

1739
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:54,706
I landed in a small problem
What is that?

1740
02:01:56,742 --> 02:01:59,711
How did you get this?
My brother in law has send it from Singapore

1741
02:02:00,246 --> 02:02:02,714
I will give 50,000 Rs
worth silver for Rs 5000

1742
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:05,217
I don't want this
will get trapped in police case, go

1743
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:06,718
Are you worried about that?
Yes

1744
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:08,220
I will give in writing that I have sold it

1745
02:02:08,754 --> 02:02:09,721
You give in writing
that you have purchased it

1746
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:12,224
That is right, you give in writing
Have this

1747
02:02:12,758 --> 02:02:15,226
Do you keep it ready?
All shop keepers ask for it

1748
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:16,728
Do they ask for it?
All shopkeepers are brilliant people

1749
02:02:17,263 --> 02:02:22,223
Sign it
Get Rs 5000

1750
02:02:22,768 --> 02:02:24,736
Hold it
Bring it

1751
02:02:25,271 --> 02:02:26,238
Ah! this is a brick

1752
02:02:26,772 --> 02:02:29,240
- Useless fellow
- Why this? - For being a fool

1753
02:02:29,775 --> 02:02:33,233
If you have spent
Rs 5000 usefully I can understand

1754
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:35,747
But you have purchased
a brick for Rs 5000

1755
02:02:36,282 --> 02:02:37,249
Are you trying to assault me?

1756
02:02:37,783 --> 02:02:39,250
stay there

1757
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:41,753
stay there, you fool

1758
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:46,758
He is dead

1759
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:50,762
I used to walk through streets with fear

1760
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:55,757
Never knew when a
decayed egg or acid filled egg will be thrown at

1761
02:02:56,302 --> 02:03:00,762
Now I come very peacefully
All this is because of your son

1762
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:06,267
Like 'soorasamharam' by Lord Muruga
He has thrashed the MLA

1763
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:09,781
You should be very proud as Arul's father

1764
02:03:22,828 --> 02:03:24,796
-Aunty
-How are you?

1765
02:03:25,331 --> 02:03:27,299
What do I lack?
Your son looks after me very well

1766
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,300
How are you uncle?

1767
02:03:33,339 --> 02:03:37,298
You are just 4 streets away
Can't you come to our house once?

1768
02:03:38,344 --> 02:03:42,303
Seems uncle is still angry with us
I will come later

1769
02:03:42,848 --> 02:03:43,815
Ok

1770
02:03:51,357 --> 02:03:54,815
Today I saw uncle
The one in Rangoon?, has he come?

1771
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:56,828
I saw your parents at the temple

1772
02:03:57,363 --> 02:04:01,322
Say Father in law
Yes I should thank him really

1773
02:04:01,867 --> 02:04:04,836
Had he not admonished you
will you have dragged me

1774
02:04:05,371 --> 02:04:06,838
married me and brought me here?

1775
02:04:07,373 --> 02:04:09,341
Even now you have married me,
because he scolded you

1776
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:12,343
Have you ever said to me 'l love you '?

1777
02:04:13,379 --> 02:04:16,348
If I don't love you,
will I get biriyani for you?

1778
02:04:16,882 --> 02:04:18,850
Biriyani? I don't eat biriyani

1779
02:04:19,385 --> 02:04:20,852
Then have you forgotten those leg pieces?

1780
02:04:21,387 --> 02:04:22,854
That was before marriage,
now I have changed

1781
02:04:23,389 --> 02:04:24,856
-Eat for my sake
- I can't

1782
02:04:25,391 --> 02:04:26,858
I am telling you, come on eat

1783
02:04:27,393 --> 02:04:29,361
God does not like atrocities
Arul does not like dirty talks

1784
02:04:29,895 --> 02:04:31,362
Kanmani doesn't like if you boss over

1785
02:04:31,897 --> 02:04:33,364
What will you do?
Look at me and say that

1786
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:35,867
What will you do?
Look at my eyes and say that?

1787
02:04:36,402 --> 02:04:37,369
What will you do?

1788
02:05:23,949 --> 02:05:26,417
Sudaamani, you are blowing hot

1789
02:05:26,952 --> 02:05:29,420
Don't rage, you have become red

1790
02:05:33,959 --> 02:05:36,427
Sudaamani, you are blowing hot

1791
02:05:36,962 --> 02:05:39,430
Don't rage, you have become red

1792
02:05:39,965 --> 02:05:42,934
You are threatening me like a rogue

1793
02:05:43,969 --> 02:05:46,437
Injuring my cheeks with your moushtache

1794
02:05:46,972 --> 02:05:49,941
I will get you chicken Biriyani, come

1795
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:52,944
Don't eat like a glutton and sleep

1796
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:59,440
Don't yearn for it
after dawn, you will have it

1797
02:05:59,985 --> 02:06:05,946
Give your concurrence with fondness

1798
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:25,966
On a white horse I will come majestically

1799
02:06:26,512 --> 02:06:29,481
Coimbatore girl, I will run away with you

1800
02:06:30,015 --> 02:06:32,984
Even if you beg, I will not let you go

1801
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:35,987
Why do you behave arrogantly?

1802
02:06:36,522 --> 02:06:38,990
Why do you unnecessarily wag?

1803
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:42,983
I will not lose the hide and seek game

1804
02:06:43,529 --> 02:06:46,498
Even if you beg I will not give myself

1805
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:52,493
If I kiss you like ants
Sweet sugarcane what will you do?

1806
02:06:53,038 --> 02:06:58,999
You are showing all your skills
and trying to gauge me

1807
02:06:59,545 --> 02:07:06,007
Shall I come near
shall I come near you?

1808
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:13,014
- Shall I contain you?
- Gosh!

1809
02:07:13,559 --> 02:07:15,527
Sudaamani, you are blowing hot

1810
02:07:16,061 --> 02:07:19,030
Don't rage, you have become red

1811
02:07:20,065 --> 02:07:22,533
You are threatening me like a rogue

1812
02:07:23,068 --> 02:07:25,536
Injuring my cheeks with your moustache

1813
02:07:43,088 --> 02:07:45,056
You are a hot betel leaf

1814
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:47,558
Oh my dear!

1815
02:07:49,595 --> 02:07:51,062
Oh my dear!

1816
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,567
Has your desire not subsided?

1817
02:07:56,602 --> 02:07:58,570
Has your moustache not drooped?

1818
02:08:00,105 --> 02:08:02,573
Male hands are always naughty

1819
02:08:03,108 --> 02:08:05,576
If a girl is near
males will try to fondle her

1820
02:08:06,612 --> 02:08:08,580
You are stirring my age

1821
02:08:09,615 --> 02:08:12,083
You are churning my mind

1822
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:19,079
Women always talk more
when they see males, talk innuendo's

1823
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:25,586
If housewife become adamant
what will you do?

1824
02:08:26,131 --> 02:08:29,100
Even if you do mistake
will fondle you and enjoy

1825
02:08:29,635 --> 02:08:32,103
If you are not alert,
will bite your ear

1826
02:08:32,638 --> 02:08:37,598
You are a ruffian and are trying to steal

1827
02:08:38,243 --> 02:08:45,206
If I request you go overboard
when I become tough you request

1828
02:08:46,151 --> 02:08:48,119
Sudaamani, you are blowing hot

1829
02:08:49,655 --> 02:08:51,122
Don't rage..

1830
02:08:52,658 --> 02:08:55,126
Sudaamani, you are blowing hot

1831
02:08:55,661 --> 02:08:58,630
Don't rage, you have become red

1832
02:08:59,665 --> 02:09:01,633
You are threatening me like a rogue

1833
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:05,136
Injuring my cheeks with your moustache

1834
02:09:05,671 --> 02:09:08,640
I will get you chicken Biriyani, come

1835
02:09:09,174 --> 02:09:11,642
Don't eat like a glutton and sleep

1836
02:09:12,177 --> 02:09:18,138
Don't yearn for it
after dawn, you will have it

1837
02:09:18,684 --> 02:09:25,146
Give your concurrence with fondness

1838
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:26,680
By-election in Kovai west constituency

1839
02:09:28,694 --> 02:09:30,662
Official announcement
by Election Commission

1840
02:09:31,697 --> 02:09:34,666
We have assembled here
to decide the candidate

1841
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,668
For the ensuing by-election

1842
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:40,671
Why did you laugh?

1843
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:43,174
I thought about the scapegoat and laughed

1844
02:09:43,709 --> 02:09:45,176
Can Arul compete with
ruling party candidate?

1845
02:09:45,711 --> 02:09:47,679
He has killed
the party leader's brother in the streets

1846
02:09:48,213 --> 02:09:50,181
and is still going strong
what you couldn't do then

1847
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:51,683
will you do now?

1848
02:09:52,217 --> 02:09:53,684
If all of you keep quiet
what does it mean?

1849
02:09:54,219 --> 02:09:55,686
This is my family's constituency

1850
02:09:56,722 --> 02:09:59,691
Block secretary, you have
fractured your hands for party's sake

1851
02:10:00,225 --> 02:10:01,692
It is your cherished wish
to become an MLA

1852
02:10:02,227 --> 02:10:03,194
You can contest
Do you mean me?

1853
02:10:03,729 --> 02:10:06,698
More than me KM can
get more community votes here

1854
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,200
If he contests, would defenitley win

1855
02:10:09,735 --> 02:10:12,704
I don't have any such desires
I will remain as a party worker

1856
02:10:13,238 --> 02:10:15,206
Even the last party worker
must participate in governance

1857
02:10:15,741 --> 02:10:16,708
That is my desire

1858
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:21,201
KM you are the candidate
This is an order by your party chief

1859
02:10:21,747 --> 02:10:23,214
I propose his candidature
I second his candidature

1860
02:10:31,757 --> 02:10:33,224
Which party people?

1861
02:10:33,759 --> 02:10:37,718
When election is announced, they will
become busy, Look how fast they walk

1862
02:10:38,263 --> 02:10:40,731
Stop, why do you go
in a procession inside the office?

1863
02:10:41,266 --> 02:10:42,733
- Who are you all?
- We belong to opposition party

1864
02:10:43,268 --> 02:10:45,236
-Which means?
-We will sit opposite & block proceedings

1865
02:10:46,271 --> 02:10:48,239
- Where are you going now?
- To get support

1866
02:10:48,774 --> 02:10:50,742
-After getting support?
-Will become MLA

1867
02:10:52,778 --> 02:10:55,246
We could not get that support
that is why we are waiting here

1868
02:10:55,781 --> 02:10:57,749
For your face, who will give support
all of you go out

1869
02:10:58,283 --> 02:11:00,751
-Why should we go out?
-Those who have rushed in will rush out

1870
02:11:01,286 --> 02:11:02,753
Shouldn't you give him way?
Go away

1871
02:11:03,288 --> 02:11:04,255
Like assembly,
why do you strip your dhoti?

1872
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:07,759
In politics, it will happen everywhere
So what?

1873
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:10,261
Will your big moustache frighten me?

1874
02:11:10,796 --> 02:11:13,264
Don't think I will be scared
Stingy fellows

1875
02:11:14,299 --> 02:11:16,767
Once they come out,
take them away, else I'll kill you

1876
02:11:17,803 --> 02:11:20,271
If you can extend your support
to us in the ensuing election

1877
02:11:20,806 --> 02:11:23,775
We will meet your expectations
and do good to the people

1878
02:11:24,309 --> 02:11:26,777
I am not a politician
and I don't know politics

1879
02:11:27,813 --> 02:11:28,780
But I know one thing for sure

1880
02:11:29,815 --> 02:11:32,784
For 1 2 years Sethupathy's brother
As MLA has spoiled this constituency

1881
02:11:33,318 --> 02:11:34,785
We will surely do good
Believe us

1882
02:11:35,821 --> 02:11:37,789
If they contest the election
I will kill them

1883
02:11:39,825 --> 02:11:43,283
Your party men can contest
But after winning the election..

1884
02:11:43,829 --> 02:11:46,297
If you do wrongs,
I will kill him also

1885
02:11:47,833 --> 02:11:50,802
I am not opposing politics
I am opposing bad politicians only

1886
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:56,797
If people have trust on you,
you will definitely win, bye

1887
02:11:59,845 --> 02:12:01,813
-What is the matter?
-Greetings, commissioner wants to meet you

1888
02:12:02,347 --> 02:12:03,314
Inform I am coming

1889
02:12:05,851 --> 02:12:07,318
-Sit down
-No thanks

1890
02:12:07,853 --> 02:12:10,822
Did you threaten
people's party Krishnamurthy?

1891
02:12:11,356 --> 02:12:13,824
I am an ordinary person
Why should I threaten him?

1892
02:12:14,359 --> 02:12:16,827
- I have not even seen him
- So you have surely not threatened him

1893
02:12:17,362 --> 02:12:19,830
- No sir
- OK you may go

1894
02:12:23,869 --> 02:12:26,838
Sir, so far I talked officially
I want to talk with you unofficially

1895
02:12:27,372 --> 02:12:28,339
Will you switch off the tape recorder?

1896
02:12:34,379 --> 02:12:36,347
Are you wondering,
how I know that you are recording?

1897
02:12:37,382 --> 02:12:39,850
I know the strengths of officials
and the weaknesses of politicians

1898
02:12:40,886 --> 02:12:44,845
Sir, tell me honestly
were you not unhappy over the atrocities..

1899
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,857
..committed by Sethupathy and Gajapathy

1900
02:12:47,893 --> 02:12:49,861
Have you not felt,
they should be put behind bars even once?

1901
02:12:50,896 --> 02:12:53,865
Even if you want, you can't do it
Because you are a government official

1902
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:56,867
I am just fulfilling
your helpless emotions

1903
02:12:57,402 --> 02:12:59,370
It might be wrong
in the eyes of your department

1904
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:00,872
But deep in your heart,
you will feel what I do is right

1905
02:13:01,406 --> 02:13:04,864
I don't want your support
but be a silent spectator, that will do

1906
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,877
Take it from me

1907
02:13:07,913 --> 02:13:10,882
From Sethupathy's party
who ever contests, I will kill

1908
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:13,384
Bye

1909
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:16,887
Ask that Krishnamurthy to come

1910
02:13:17,422 --> 02:13:18,389
come

1911
02:13:18,924 --> 02:13:21,893
Arul says he has never threatened you
file your nomination boldly

1912
02:13:22,427 --> 02:13:23,894
Rest we will take care
which one, my death?

1913
02:13:29,434 --> 02:13:31,402
Will commissioner be with you for 24 hrs?

1914
02:13:31,937 --> 02:13:33,404
Do you sleep hugging him?

1915
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:36,907
Even then, if the ceiling fan
falls on your head, what will you do?

1916
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:41,913
-lt will surely fall
-He is again threatening me

1917
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,419
You are alright,
you have no cardiac problems

1918
02:13:48,954 --> 02:13:50,421
I also know that
But if I go out, I will be killed

1919
02:13:50,956 --> 02:13:52,924
I will lie here for 10 days
Say I have a cardiac attack

1920
02:13:53,959 --> 02:13:58,419
This was a ruse done by me
Is he showing me the same trick?

1921
02:13:59,464 --> 02:14:00,931
No point in
trusting you guys, who fear death

1922
02:14:01,466 --> 02:14:03,934
- Call up Palayamkottai Kasilingam
- Yes leader

1923
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:06,938
I will make him the candidate
who can oppose him?

1924
02:14:08,473 --> 02:14:10,441
Line is busy, seems his phone is engaged

1925
02:14:10,976 --> 02:14:14,935
-Have you seen him? Follow him
-I am trailing him -Tell me the location

1926
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:16,447
He has crossed the twin bridge

1927
02:14:16,982 --> 02:14:17,949
I'll also join,
I've crossed the twin bridge

1928
02:14:18,483 --> 02:14:19,450
Chellapandian is going
near the traffic island

1929
02:14:19,985 --> 02:14:23,944
-Where is he going?
-He is going to the right - Go fast

1930
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:25,956
-He is crossing the road
-I have come close

1931
02:14:26,491 --> 02:14:27,958
He is the guy, hit him

1932
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,968
-Poor fellow, untimely demise
Pay the fine and come -OK

1933
02:14:39,004 --> 02:14:40,471
Kasi, I am sethupathy here

1934
02:14:41,006 --> 02:14:44,464
-Tell me leader
-lmmediately come to Coimbatore - OK

1935
02:14:45,510 --> 02:14:48,968
Why are you standing in hot sun dear?
I was waiting for you only

1936
02:14:49,514 --> 02:14:51,482
Were you waiting for me?
What is the matter?

1937
02:14:52,017 --> 02:14:53,985
My ear stud has fallen in the tank

1938
02:14:54,519 --> 02:14:56,487
Will you take it out for me?
Is your stud in this tank?

1939
02:14:57,522 --> 02:15:00,980
For your sake, I will jump
into the sea also, just see

1940
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:06,497
I will not come without the stud

1941
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:18,999
Is it stinking too much?
this is our house septic tank

1942
02:15:20,545 --> 02:15:21,512
Is it a septic tank?

1943
02:15:23,048 --> 02:15:25,016
It is ok, after all it is our tank

1944
02:15:26,551 --> 02:15:28,519
What a stink is this?

1945
02:15:29,054 --> 02:15:30,021
This is a trade secret

1946
02:15:30,555 --> 02:15:34,013
- Just like we sieve the gold sand
I can get your stud - Take it

1947
02:15:41,066 --> 02:15:45,025
Thank God! This is the last bucket
this must be seived thoroughly

1948
02:15:47,072 --> 02:15:49,540
Has the tank been cleaned?
Many thanks

1949
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:51,042
Yet to get your ear stud,
why do you thank me now?

1950
02:15:51,576 --> 02:15:53,043
-You have already taken it
-Which one?

1951
02:15:53,578 --> 02:15:56,046
- The sludge
- What about stud? - Here it is

1952
02:15:57,582 --> 02:16:00,050
Don't be upset,
the drain was blocked for the last 1 0 days

1953
02:16:00,585 --> 02:16:03,053
..the corporation guys asked for Rs 50

1954
02:16:03,588 --> 02:16:08,048
So I told you I have lost my ear stud
But you are really fast

1955
02:16:08,593 --> 02:16:11,061
You have cleaned it
Good boy!

1956
02:16:12,597 --> 02:16:14,064
Sinner

1957
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,068
She has made me clean this sludge

1958
02:16:18,603 --> 02:16:19,570
Come, what do you want?

1959
02:16:20,105 --> 02:16:22,073
Want to check the voter's list
Give us your ration card

1960
02:16:22,607 --> 02:16:26,065
We are newly married,
we don't have a card for us

1961
02:16:26,611 --> 02:16:29,079
-Come after 1 0 minutes,
I'll get card from my in-law's place -OK

1962
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:31,582
- Brother
- What?

1963
02:16:32,117 --> 02:16:35,086
- Get ration card from
our house and his house - Yes madam

1964
02:16:36,121 --> 02:16:38,089
-Your name?
- Kanmani - It is there

1965
02:16:38,623 --> 02:16:40,090
Your husband's name?
Arul Kumaran

1966
02:16:40,625 --> 02:16:44,584
Baladhandayuthapani, Sornammal,
Thirukumaran, Velkumaran, Senthil

1967
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:47,098
-Before that Arul Kumaran will be there
- It is not there

1968
02:16:47,632 --> 02:16:51,090
Check again
I have checked, check for yourself

1969
02:17:00,145 --> 02:17:01,112
Mom!!

1970
02:17:03,648 --> 02:17:06,116
Mom, am I not your son?
Did you not give me birth?

1971
02:17:06,651 --> 02:17:10,109
Is that man my dad?
My name is not there in ration card

1972
02:17:10,655 --> 02:17:13,624
How come it is missing?
Who gave names? Am I so unwanted?

1973
02:17:17,162 --> 02:17:19,630
Atleast girls can have
husband's name in initials after marriage

1974
02:17:20,165 --> 02:17:22,633
But males, have to use
dad's name in initials, no other go

1975
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:26,136
He may say I am not his son

1976
02:17:27,172 --> 02:17:31,131
But for me, till my death he is my dad

1977
02:17:32,677 --> 02:17:34,144
Otherwise it will be a stigma on you

1978
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:36,147
I don't want to defame you

1979
02:17:39,184 --> 02:17:40,651
Go, all of you

1980
02:17:43,188 --> 02:17:44,155
Have you heard him?

1981
02:17:44,689 --> 02:17:47,157
No one can give troubles to
one's son more than this?

1982
02:17:47,692 --> 02:17:53,153
For some of his wrongs,
in my anger I didn't give his name

1983
02:17:54,199 --> 02:17:56,167
I have even said my son is dead

1984
02:17:56,701 --> 02:17:58,669
But have I ever said he is not my son?

1985
02:18:01,206 --> 02:18:02,173
Uncle..

1986
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:06,176
The jewels were not stolen by Arul

1987
02:18:07,712 --> 02:18:09,179
It was done by him

1988
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:14,685
Arul also knows about this

1989
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:19,179
But till date he has not
talked a word about it..

1990
02:18:19,724 --> 02:18:22,192
..and has safeguarded his esteem

1991
02:18:23,228 --> 02:18:24,195
Safeguarding it

1992
02:18:39,244 --> 02:18:40,211
Greetings

1993
02:18:41,246 --> 02:18:43,214
- Greetings leader
- Come Kasi

1994
02:18:43,748 --> 02:18:45,716
I was roaming with weapons
You have now called me to politics

1995
02:18:46,251 --> 02:18:49,220
-Bless you
- Bring that, all of them call me bad

1996
02:18:49,754 --> 02:18:51,221
But you have displayed
huge hoardings for me

1997
02:18:51,756 --> 02:18:54,224
You come victoriously
I can get you a ministerial berth

1998
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,728
After the public meeting,
file nomination tomorrow

1999
02:18:58,263 --> 02:18:59,730
Leave it to me
I'll show my prowess in the public meeting

2000
02:19:00,265 --> 02:19:03,234
This is not an introductory meeting
This must be Arul's doom

2001
02:19:08,773 --> 02:19:11,241
- Change the route and finish him off
- Arul has come to meet you

2002
02:19:13,778 --> 02:19:17,236
Ask him to come,
check him thoroughly before you let him

2003
02:19:23,788 --> 02:19:26,757
Why so many mobile phones?
Are you running a brothel?

2004
02:19:27,292 --> 02:19:28,759
All guys are caught with mobile phones

2005
02:19:29,294 --> 02:19:30,261
Sit down

2006
02:19:32,797 --> 02:19:34,765
Heard you would
kill me if I contest elections

2007
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:37,768
How many you have killed so far?
Do you know about me?

2008
02:19:38,303 --> 02:19:40,271
You are a big rowdy
and is eking out a living with a sickle

2009
02:19:42,307 --> 02:19:44,775
You have a roaring profession
why do you interfere in this?

2010
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:47,277
Are you counselling me?

2011
02:19:47,812 --> 02:19:50,781
I am not counseling
telling you to run away wisely

2012
02:19:51,316 --> 02:19:54,774
-What are you saying?
-You might be a big thug in Tirunelveli

2013
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:56,787
But as for as
Coimbatore is concerned, I know

2014
02:19:57,322 --> 02:19:58,289
I know which is 'one way',
which is a no parking area..

2015
02:19:58,823 --> 02:20:00,791
.. and number of speed breakers
and signals, do you know?

2016
02:20:01,826 --> 02:20:04,795
I can drive blind folded
and reach the target, can you?

2017
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:08,299
- I am from Tambiraparani river banks
- I am from Siruvani river banks

2018
02:20:08,833 --> 02:20:10,801
You have grown with sickle
But I have grown amidst bomb blasts

2019
02:20:11,336 --> 02:20:13,304
If I kick you on the run
do you know to get back to your place?

2020
02:20:13,838 --> 02:20:14,805
Do you know..........(CENSORED)

2021
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:17,808
God does not like atrocities
I don't like abuses -What will you do?

2022
02:20:18,343 --> 02:20:19,310
Look at me and repeat it
..................(CENSORED)

2023
02:20:19,844 --> 02:20:20,811
Look at my eyes and say that
..................(CENSORED)

2024
02:20:26,351 --> 02:20:28,319
Put it down
Put the phone down

2025
02:20:31,356 --> 02:20:32,323
Put it down

2026
02:20:42,867 --> 02:20:43,834
Hey you!

2027
02:20:48,873 --> 02:20:50,841
4 bombs are known
Do you know how many more are there?

2028
02:20:52,377 --> 02:20:53,844
Get back to your place

2029
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:58,349
If you conduct a public meeting
Do that and see what happens........

2030
02:21:03,388 --> 02:21:05,356
What is this?
He has blasted bombs and is going

2031
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:08,859
I am not scared of these toy bombs
Arrange for the meeting

2032
02:21:10,395 --> 02:21:14,354
I am garlanding leader Kasilingam

2033
02:21:16,401 --> 02:21:19,859
I am prepared to toil
for you day in and day out

2034
02:21:20,405 --> 02:21:23,374
Whatever may be the hurdles
I will return victoriously

2035
02:21:23,908 --> 02:21:24,875
Thanks

2036
02:21:27,912 --> 02:21:31,370
Kasilingam is
a jasmine nurtured at Nellai

2037
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:32,883
He is a water lily blossomed in the night

2038
02:21:33,418 --> 02:21:35,386
He has come here hopping

2039
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:36,887
He will win the elections.......

2040
02:21:37,922 --> 02:21:40,891
- You have defied me and
conducting the meeting - Who are you?

2041
02:21:41,426 --> 02:21:42,893
Just see,
now there will be a power failure

2042
02:21:48,433 --> 02:21:51,891
-Where are you?
-See now, your hoarding will be blasted

2043
02:21:52,937 --> 02:21:56,896
Now it is the turn
for your leader's hoarding

2044
02:22:01,446 --> 02:22:02,913
You......(CENSORED)
Where are you?

2045
02:22:03,448 --> 02:22:07,908
-Leave that
The dias won't be there now-Escape if possible

2046
02:22:08,453 --> 02:22:10,421
Get down & run

2047
02:22:19,964 --> 02:22:21,431
Start the vehicle

2048
02:22:28,973 --> 02:22:30,941
Are you running away scared?

2049
02:22:31,476 --> 02:22:33,944
Who is scared?
Right now I'll bring 5 lorry loads of men

2050
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:35,946
and see to it that you are finished

2051
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:37,448
Before you bring the lorry...

2052
02:22:38,483 --> 02:22:39,450
..see whether a lorry is in front of you?

2053
02:22:41,986 --> 02:22:42,953
Is there a lorry behind you?

2054
02:22:45,490 --> 02:22:48,948
If the lorry in front stops and
the lorry behind rams into your car

2055
02:22:49,494 --> 02:22:51,962
Do you know what will happen?
- Where are you?

2056
02:22:53,498 --> 02:22:54,465
Just turn behind

2057
02:22:56,501 --> 02:22:59,470
You will hit men with your car
But I will hit car with lorries

2058
02:23:00,004 --> 02:23:00,971
Shall l?

2059
02:23:07,512 --> 02:23:08,479
Driver stop the car

2060
02:23:21,526 --> 02:23:24,984
Arul leave me, I know only
about daggers and sickle

2061
02:23:25,530 --> 02:23:28,499
I don't know about bombs
I will go

2062
02:23:29,033 --> 02:23:30,500
Ok, I will let you live

2063
02:23:31,035 --> 02:23:32,502
Start the vehicle quickly

2064
02:23:35,039 --> 02:23:37,507
That guy got admitted in hospital

2065
02:23:38,042 --> 02:23:41,011
Then people went
raving about Palayamkottai Kasilingam

2066
02:23:41,546 --> 02:23:43,013
But he has also
run away fearing your brother

2067
02:23:43,548 --> 02:23:47,507
- Are you not scared?
- No I am not

2068
02:23:48,052 --> 02:23:50,520
But your eyes doesn't reveal
the courage of your lips

2069
02:23:51,556 --> 02:23:55,014
I am daily praying God for his well being

2070
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:58,028
Nothing will happen to him
My husband is with him

2071
02:23:58,563 --> 02:23:59,530
He will take care

2072
02:24:03,568 --> 02:24:04,535
-What?
-I want to know either of the two

2073
02:24:05,069 --> 02:24:07,537
- What is that two?
- Will you marry me or not?

2074
02:24:08,072 --> 02:24:11,530
When did I say I will marry you?

2075
02:24:12,076 --> 02:24:14,044
Then is your dance,
songs and talks with me a farce?

2076
02:24:14,579 --> 02:24:15,546
- You can take it that way
- Sir..

2077
02:24:17,582 --> 02:24:18,549
Sir..

2078
02:24:19,083 --> 02:24:24,544
If you don't marry
I will marry her and make her my wife

2079
02:24:26,090 --> 02:24:28,058
Don't worry, I have
40 acres of ancestral property share

2080
02:24:28,593 --> 02:24:30,060
I will transfer that to your name

2081
02:24:31,596 --> 02:24:34,565
Why did you marry that beggar in haste?

2082
02:24:35,099 --> 02:24:36,566
I am loving you dearly

2083
02:24:37,101 --> 02:24:38,068
- Really
- Yes

2084
02:24:38,603 --> 02:24:42,061
- Then swear on my head
- Not true

2085
02:24:42,607 --> 02:24:45,576
Dont feel for it
If we give 1 0 Rs she will give it back

2086
02:24:46,611 --> 02:24:47,578
Have this 1 0Rs and give me the chain back

2087
02:24:48,613 --> 02:24:51,582
Is the sacred thread so cheap to you?

2088
02:24:52,116 --> 02:24:55,085
For each lady that is the protection
I am a Tamilnadu beggar

2089
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:57,587
Come and live with me

2090
02:24:58,623 --> 02:25:01,592
All of you come
what happened?

2091
02:25:02,126 --> 02:25:03,593
He is trying to decieve me
after marrying me

2092
02:25:04,128 --> 02:25:07,097
After marrying,is he deceiving?
Are beggares so mean to you?

2093
02:25:07,632 --> 02:25:09,099
Don't leave him, lift him
Wait

2094
02:25:12,637 --> 02:25:14,605
When you beg along
with your wife, come to our house

2095
02:25:15,139 --> 02:25:16,606
I will give you 4 idli's extra

2096
02:25:19,143 --> 02:25:21,611
Kasilingam has fled without giving information
CM is on the line

2097
02:25:22,146 --> 02:25:26,606
You brought a rowdy from Palayamkottai
He has run away

2098
02:25:27,151 --> 02:25:30,609
This has spoiled the party's image
I am the party chief,mind it

2099
02:25:31,155 --> 02:25:34,124
Lot of them question us in party meetings
I don't know what to do?

2100
02:25:34,659 --> 02:25:35,626
Seems there will be inner party squabbles

2101
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,128
Today is the last day for filing nomination
What have you decided?

2102
02:25:42,667 --> 02:25:44,635
In my own soil,
despite being the ruling party

2103
02:25:45,169 --> 02:25:46,636
Couldn't find a candidate to contest

2104
02:25:48,172 --> 02:25:49,639
I am going to contest
Leader

2105
02:25:50,174 --> 02:25:51,641
I will contest

2106
02:25:53,177 --> 02:25:55,645
You said you will not contest the electons
Why do you contest now?

2107
02:25:56,180 --> 02:25:57,147
circumstancial compulsions

2108
02:25:57,682 --> 02:26:00,651
Because Arul has popular support
It is said you couldn't do anything

2109
02:26:01,185 --> 02:26:02,652
You go away
Go all of you

2110
02:26:05,189 --> 02:26:08,158
Your partyman's refusal has not made you wise
Are you going to contest?

2111
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:11,662
File the nomination and see the fun
I will kill you on the spot

2112
02:26:12,196 --> 02:26:13,163
Are you going to kill me?

2113
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:18,168
At 4'O'clock I am going to
file the nomination

2114
02:26:18,703 --> 02:26:20,671
Before that his family members
count must come down

2115
02:27:08,753 --> 02:27:09,720
Push him into the car

2116
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:29,239
Take him to the same place
where they have killed my brother

2117
02:27:33,778 --> 02:27:38,238
Senthil,my son
what has happened to you?

2118
02:27:40,284 --> 02:27:42,252
Oh my son, Senthil

2119
02:27:44,789 --> 02:27:47,781
Who did this?
Why did they kill my son?

2120
02:27:52,797 --> 02:27:55,265
Senthil

2121
02:27:56,801 --> 02:27:57,768
Oh God!

2122
02:28:02,306 --> 02:28:03,273
Mother

2123
02:28:09,313 --> 02:28:10,280
Oh God!

2124
02:28:15,386 --> 02:28:18,617
Rowdies strike frequently
Politicians wait for the right time to strike

2125
02:28:19,824 --> 02:28:21,792
I am a politician
you must cry

2126
02:28:22,326 --> 02:28:24,294
People must die in your house
That is your destiny

2127
02:28:24,829 --> 02:28:26,296
Those with brothers
need not fear any force

2128
02:28:26,831 --> 02:28:28,799
With uncle's support
you can climb any mountain

2129
02:28:29,333 --> 02:28:30,800
You will not have that uncle also

2130
02:28:33,337 --> 02:28:37,296
Why do you cry?
Don't weep dear, Get him 2 baloons

2131
02:28:42,847 --> 02:28:44,314
Uncle where are you?
I am in the exhibition

2132
02:28:44,849 --> 02:28:48,307
Who are all with you?
Your sister and children

2133
02:28:48,853 --> 02:28:51,321
None of our men are with you?
Why,is there any problem?

2134
02:28:53,357 --> 02:28:56,326
They have killed senthil
How did it happen?

2135
02:28:57,862 --> 02:28:58,829
Uncle

2136
02:29:03,367 --> 02:29:04,334
Go fast

2137
02:29:09,874 --> 02:29:11,341
What happened?
why are you running?

2138
02:29:11,876 --> 02:29:13,343
Have attacked a man
Attacked?, Oh God

2139
02:29:19,884 --> 02:29:20,851
Dear

2140
02:29:22,887 --> 02:29:23,854
Bakkiam

2141
02:29:27,391 --> 02:29:28,358
Dear

2142
02:29:49,413 --> 02:29:50,380
Move

2143
02:29:50,915 --> 02:29:51,882
Move away

2144
02:29:57,355 --> 02:30:00,882
-Arul
-Keep quiet

2145
02:30:01,926 --> 02:30:02,893
Start the vehicle

2146
02:30:03,427 --> 02:30:04,894
Don't leave them

2147
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:10,390
If you leave them, even these
children will not survive

2148
02:30:10,935 --> 02:30:11,902
It is nothing

2149
02:30:14,438 --> 02:30:15,905
-Bakkiam
-Daddy

2150
02:30:28,452 --> 02:30:31,910
Do you know one thing?
If you lose your partner,everything is lost

2151
02:30:32,957 --> 02:30:34,925
You would have understood the next target

2152
02:30:36,961 --> 02:30:38,929
You be here
Move away

2153
02:30:51,475 --> 02:30:53,443
Where is Kanmani?
she has gone to her mother's house

2154
02:31:11,495 --> 02:31:12,462
Dear

2155
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:17,467
Dear

2156
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:37,988
Body has not yet come from the hospital

2157
02:31:48,032 --> 02:31:49,499
Kanmani, my life is gone

2158
02:31:51,035 --> 02:31:53,003
My life has become like this
Children have become orphans

2159
02:31:53,537 --> 02:31:54,504
What will I do?

2160
02:32:35,079 --> 02:32:39,539
Don't weep
I only killed your husband

2161
02:32:40,084 --> 02:32:42,052
I didn't intend to kill him
But he died

2162
02:32:42,586 --> 02:32:44,554
Do you know for his death, you only cry

2163
02:32:45,089 --> 02:32:48,058
But the entire village is happy
No one has found fault with me, why?

2164
02:32:48,592 --> 02:32:51,561
Do you know, he has made
how many women widows?

2165
02:32:52,096 --> 02:32:55,065
Don't worry about the dead
and spoil the life of your children

2166
02:33:10,614 --> 02:33:13,583
I am arresting you
for injuring Sethupathy's men

2167
02:33:17,621 --> 02:33:18,588
Beloved Arul - Release him

2168
02:33:19,623 --> 02:33:23,582
Beloved Arul - Release him

2169
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:28,594
Arul kumar'supporters
indulge in agitations

2170
02:33:29,133 --> 02:33:32,591
as cited by police,
to avoid deterioration of Law and order

2171
02:33:33,137 --> 02:33:36,595

Why this much crowd
Leader himself is contesting the elections

2180
02:34:32,696 --> 02:34:34,163
He will have a sweeping victory

2181
02:34:34,698 --> 02:34:35,665
Move away

2182
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:37,167

02:36:48,332 --> 02:36:51,301
Normally they shout
only when they see him

2190
02:36:51,835 --> 02:36:53,803
Now they shout even after he has gone in

2191
02:37:08,352 --> 02:37:11,321
What are you doing outside?
One guy is on a chopping spree inside

2192
02:37:11,855 --> 02:37:13,322
What are you saying sir?

2193
02:37:31,375 --> 02:37:32,342

How can he come there when he is with me?

02:38:15,419 --> 02:38:18,877
Give the phone to him
As per lPC I need not give he phone to an accused

2201
02:38:19,423 --> 02:38:20,890
If you want you can meet him in person

2202
02:38:24,928 --> 02:38:26,896
At Avinashi road our van is waiting
We will go in that

2203
02:38:27,431 --> 02:38:29,899
We have to prove Arul was not

2204
02:38:30,434 --> 02:38:31,401
Inform Avinashi check post
