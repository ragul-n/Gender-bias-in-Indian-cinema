00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,100
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,230
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,600
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,300
All praise is due to God alone.

5
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,160
God forbid that if Ertugrul had been hurt
and agreement hadn’t arrived there...

6
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,040
...it wouldn’t have been like this, my Bey.

7
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,300
It does not look like
the doings of a few guards.

8
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,500
It is clear that something we don’t know
is happening in Aleppo.

9
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,800
We need to find out the reason why
we were not accepted into the city.

10
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,930
The tribe must have started the migration.

11
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,000
We cannot sit here with our hands tied.

12
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,400
We need to find a way to enter Aleppo.

13
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,830
If you give permission, my Bey...

14
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,300
...can I try to enter the city all alone?
Maybe we can pass the guards this time.

15
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,930
It does not seem likely but...

16
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,300
...there is nothing else to do but try.

17
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,030
I can go.

18
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
If you give me permission, my Bey.

19
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,960
We do not know
what is going on in Aleppo.

20
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,900
We cannot send you into the unknown.

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,100
You know much better, my Bey but...

22
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,460
...no one would suspect
a young woman on her own.

23
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,930
I can say that I am from another
tribe and came to the city...

24
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,500
...to find a cure for my mother's illness.

25
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,360
If you give permission,
I would like to accompany Aykiz.

26
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,130
We can be more cautious
when we are together.

27
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,200
When the situation asks for it,
the Kayi women can be...

28
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,560
...as brave as their men
and fight as good as the Alps.

29
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,360
Thank God.

30
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,460
We had the chance to stand up like men
for our tribe when we were young.

31
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,130
My Bey, you know better.

32
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,600
The Kayi women have strengthened their men
in every era, sure we know this.

33
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,030
Yet...

34
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,000
...we cannot leave our girls all alone
in these foreign lands.

35
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,000
Deli Demir...

36
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
...take Aykiz and Gokce with you...

37
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,800
...set off together.

38
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,530
Let us pray that the guards
show mercy to a man...

39
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,300
...who is traveling
with his daughters.

40
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,000
Of course, my Bey.

41
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,230
The weather is getting worse.

42
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,460
This time the journey
will test our limits.

43
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,900
Do not worry, Hatun. We shall reach
Aleppo with God's permission.

44
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,960
I am scared for my baby.

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,060
How can I endure
the cold in this condition?

46
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,000
You will.
All three of us will overcome this.

47
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,960
Do you think they reached Aleppo?

48
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,930
They must have, with God's permission.

49
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,560
I wish I listened to my mother
and send you with them as well.

50
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,460
It is better this way.

51
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,800
For better for worse.

52
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,160
Nothing will happen to me
as long as I am with you.

53
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,560
We should be on our way
without too much delay.

54
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,930
Hamza!

55
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,600
Alpargu.

56
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,930
Do you remember the address
Ertugrul gave in Aleppo, Deli Demir?

57
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,260
A bookseller in the Aleppo market, my Bey.

58
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,960
The owner of the bookstore is
Abdulqadir El Halabi.

59
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,360
We will ask him about Ertugrul.

60
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,530
May God speed you.

61
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,860
Go fast and come back fast.

62
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,400
May Mother Fatima’s holy hand
be on you all times.

63
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,560
Amen.

64
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,200
Return with good news.

65
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,930
-May God be with you.
-Amen.

66
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,400
Go on, my girl.

67
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,960
God, protect them.

68
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,530
My Bey...

69
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,960
...you seem calm like still waters.

70
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:17,430
Small ponds of water ripple
when a man blows a bit hard.

71
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,560
But are the big seas like that, Alpargu?

72
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,100
Do you not remember the Caspian Sea?

73
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,380
It may be calm sometimes
but when it heaves up...

74
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,880
...nothing can stop it.

75
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,340
Do not be sad because
it is the time of the low tide now.

76
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,130
The time will come for the high tide
and we will heave up once again.

77
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,860
Up until this day I never doubted
even a word you said.

78
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,360
But I do not understand
how you can be so hopeful.

79
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,600
Whatever we tried,
we failed and returned to our tent.

80
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,330
That is correct.

81
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,530
You are right, Alpargu.

82
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,530
We almost lost our own lives
while trying to take lives.

83
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,430
But your Bey...

84
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
...has not played his last card yet.

85
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,930
We still do not have
any news from Kara Toygar.

86
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,200
Maybe Kara Toygar will return
from Konya with good news.

87
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,300
Of course the good news may mean
a wedding celebration for some...

88
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,600
...and mourning to death for others.

89
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,200
I am going to Leila Hanim's room.

90
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Their guest has woken up with a good
appetite. I am taking some food to her.

91
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,130
Did you come to take him?

92
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,500
No...

93
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
...I came to take your head.

94
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,460
Justice always prevails here.

95
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,130
A killer who killed Aleppo's
most respected trader...

96
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,600
...and the guards of the palace
shall surely be punished.

97
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,330
Just like a bird,
you flew into the trap we set up for you.

98
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,560
We don’t hunt birds, we use them
as a bait for our traps.

99
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
While you were intending to hunt a bird...

100
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,130
...you fell prey to a wolf.

101
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,330
You!

102
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,460
Don't think that I forgot you!

103
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
Ertugrul.

104
00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,200
Put this man in the dungeon for killing
the innocent witnesses who did nothing...

105
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,330
...but to tell the truth as well as
the guards of his highness the Ameer.

106
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,360
Now with all these guards here...

107
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,860
...made me concerned about the security
of the palace.

108
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,530
What do you say, Nasir?

109
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,530
I am coming from the Kayi tribe.
Ertugrul Bey gave us your name.

110
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,500
Ertugrul?

111
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Ertugrul.

112
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,860
Why did you bring us here?

113
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,400
Why are we not going
to the secret passage?

114
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,800
Do not panic, brother Bamsi.

115
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,300
This room was chosen
by our people on purpose.

116
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,900
It is not a room that is used frequently.

117
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,830
Shut up, woman!

118
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,900
She fainted.

119
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,100
With this woman, we can sneak through an
army of guards. Let us wear these clothes.

120
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,400
Let us take a carpet out on the way
out so that we will not attract attention.

121
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,960
Open the door!

122
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,800
Open the door!

123
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,960
-I am telling you, open at once!
-Are these your men?

124
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,930
Open the door! I am talking to you!

125
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,960
Open the door, then, brother Bamsi.

126
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,500
Obviously, this is
the last day of his life.

127
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,330
You are right, brother Dogan, he shouted
too much, he is giving me a headache.

128
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,330
So, it must be taken care of.

129
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,930
-I'm telling you!
-Great God!

130
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,360
Bamsi...

131
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,230
...we would harm our Bey like that.

132
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,000
We do whatever he told us to.

133
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,230
My Bey...

134
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
...will you voluntarily go to the trap of Nasir?

135
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,160
I do not want any objection
to my orders, Dogan.

136
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,560
You shall do what I say.

137
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,260
This is a big trap that is set not only for our tribe
but also for the Islamic world.

138
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,360
We must spoil the game of the ones
who carried out that ruse.

139
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,600
In such a mission, neither my life
nor the life of any of us, cut any ice.

140
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,530
At any cost, you will bring the woman
who would take us to the snake’s hole.

141
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
My Bey?

142
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,360
Nasir will mass the men here who he trusts most
in the palace to catch me.

143
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,860
That will pave the way of your entrance
to the palace.

144
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,800
While Nasir is boasting of catching me...

145
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,230
...you will get the woman out of there.

146
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,500
Wait!

147
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,030
Where are you taking these?

148
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,800
His highness the Ameer and Leila Sultan's
governess Ummulhayr Hanim ordered us...

149
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,160
...to change the carpets of
their living quarters.

150
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,060
They told us to give away
the old carpets to those in need.

151
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Aleppo's poor people will pray for you.

152
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,460
Carry on.

153
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,900
Dogan and Bamsi came before us.

154
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,230
We came with Ertugrul but...

155
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,500
...my son Yigit and Turgut Alp...

156
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,160
...have never made it to Aleppo.

157
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,900
They were captured by the Templars.

158
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,960
-The Templars...
-Aykiz...

159
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,430
I knew it. Turgut!

160
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,260
Turgut!

161
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,300
Turgut!

162
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,560
Don’t tell me that the betrayers
defeated us again, Nasir.

163
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,960
No, your highness. We caught Ertugrul.

164
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,060
He was put in prison for killing the ones
who testified against Sahabeddin.

165
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Do you think you can get
any information from Ertugrul?

166
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:58,500
There is no power that can stand against
the absolute and swift justice of Aleppo.

167
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,130
Ertugrul will see talking as
the only solution to save his own life.

168
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,300
Why are you so tense, your highness?

169
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,600
Traitors have suffered a great loss.
When we take Sahabeddin in...

170
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,200
...this network of traitors
shall be completely disbanded.

171
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,960
For God's sake, while my uncle
roams freely in the city...

172
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,960
...how can I relax, Nasir?

173
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,060
You know how loyal the soldiers are to him.

174
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,360
What I fear is the arousal of disunion
in the army.

175
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,960
Did you think you would
lay around in the dungeon?

176
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,430
-We will clean you down to your bones!
-Even your dog won’t be able to pick up your scene.

177
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,230
Move!

178
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,600
Brothers, the woman woke up.

179
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,060
Give it to me, Aykutluk Bey.
Let me take over.

180
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,100
What is in it?

181
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,030
What can it be, commander?
A carpet and some dust on it.

182
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,060
There might be a female tick. The kind
that sticks and sucks your blood.

183
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,560
Put the carpet down.

184
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,100
-Shall I put it down?
-You suckling veal...

185
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,930
...didn't our Bey tell us
to bring the woman in one piece?

186
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,000
-But the soldier said put it down.
-I said put it down!

187
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,230
Our Bey gave himself up for this woman.

188
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,030
-Bamsi, you take the carpet and go.
-How is that possible, brother?

189
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,430
Do what I say, Bamsi.

190
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,230
Great God then!

191
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,230
Have a good fight, brothers!

192
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,500
I entrust Aykiz to you, Gokce.

193
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,200
And you are entrusted first to God,
then to the bookseller.

194
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,000
I need to inform Suleyman Shah
immediately.

195
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,230
Do not worry.

196
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,160
From now on, they are the daughters
of our lodge.

197
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,560
Look, Gokce.
You are the only one with Aykiz.

198
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,430
When you stay strong like you do now,
I will not worry about you on the road.

199
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,530
We should go then.

200
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,530
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

201
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,800
When Master went after you in a hurry,
I don't know how I completed the sermon.

202
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,930
-Hold it straight.
-Alright.

203
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,060
How did you manage to escape from there?

204
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,500
While we were trying to save the wolf
from the trap, he saved us from there.

205
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,060
Tell this fiddle-faddle to that priest here.

206
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,430
I don't care about the good tidings
of your father in the skies.

207
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,600
Thank God,
I know both my father and my God.

208
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,960
Pull.

209
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,260
-In the name of Jesus!
-In the name of Jesus!

210
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,400
Arrow.

211
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,330
The Ustad-i Azam is a clever man.

212
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,360
He will bring up Yigit as a Knight Templar...

213
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,230
...and use him against the Seljuk.

214
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,960
What about the young man in the dungeon,
Afsin Bey? What will they do to him?

215
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,900
I do not know what they will do to him...

216
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,540
...but I hope we get out of here
before we witness that.

217
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,820
We will also not let Yigit
to be oppressed any more.

218
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,520
-With God's permission, my Bey.
-With God's permission.

219
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,360
Yigit!

220
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,060
Let brother Turgut go!

221
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
I said let him go!

222
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,530
Enough!

223
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,500
You descend from the murderers of my father...

224
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,430
...in fact, you deserve to die ever so much.

225
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,200
Be thankful that you are Yigit's friend.

226
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,830
Shahzada's friend is our friend.

227
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,000
Come on, Yigit.

228
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,400
If someone from us killed your father,
he must have deserved it.

229
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,500
Killing someone who doesn’t deserve it,
is not something we would do.

230
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,500
My father respected your religion.

231
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,200
He spent all his life in these lands
to understand the Muhammadans.

232
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,300
If he was someone
who respected our religion...

233
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,100
...search for his killers among people who
do not even respect their own religion.

234
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,530
Are you ready?

235
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,960
He will be ready soon, sir.

236
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,830
I am guessing that we are acquiring
a friend from the enemy side.

237
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,930
Please be rest assured, Hayme.

238
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,930
With God's permission, our tribe has never
been left without a homeland or future...

239
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,460
...and it shall never be.

240
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,060
A whole life that was spent to survive the Mongols...

241
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,200
Every homeland has taken a piece of me
from the Caspian Sea to here.

242
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,900
Just like tearing my heart out.

243
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,500
It tore out and took them.

244
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
My father...

245
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,330
...my brothers...

246
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,300
...my sisters.

247
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,900
Then...

248
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,560
...my son.

249
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,860
My Sungurtekin.

250
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,200
I don't even know whether
he is alive or not.

251
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,000
Trying to live on...

252
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:20,100
...without knowing whether
my brave son is alive or not...

253
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,830
As if these were not enough...

254
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,930
...now Ertugrul.

255
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,560
If anything happens to him...

256
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,060
Thank God, Deli Demir is back.

257
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,600
Come on, have a seat.

258
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,400
Welcome.

259
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,060
Thank you, my Bey. Thank you but...

260
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,060
...the news are not that good.

261
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,960
Tell us then. Is Ertugrul alright?

262
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,460
Is my brave son alive, Deli Demir?

263
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,160
Deli Demir!

264
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,300
Is Ertugrul alive?

265
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,560
I saw him with my own eyes.

266
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,900
He is alive.

267
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
But...

268
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,930
...he is in the dungeon.
-What?

269
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,230
What are you saying, Deli?

270
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,060
Do you hear what you are saying?

271
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,230
I wish I swaged my tongue
with an anvil, my Bey...

272
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,030
...but that is just the way it is.

273
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,360
Rahman, go to the tribe
on the migration road immediately.

274
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,100
Tell Gundogdu...

275
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,230
...to take Kurdoglu and the other
Beys and come here in the quickest manner!

276
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,360
Now...

277
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,430
...tell everything
from the beginning, Deli Demir.

278
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,830
Whatever you saw, whatever you heard.

279
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,490
Did he speak?

280
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,160
Pity...

281
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,500
What a pity, Ertugrul.

282
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,460
I don’t find it in my heart to see
a brave man like you being tourtured.

283
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,900
Vizier Sahabeddin who you have suffered
so much for...

284
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,460
...deceived not only you but all of us.

285
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,060
However, I see that you are
still under his thumb.

286
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,860
Who could think that Sahabeddin Tugrul
would collaborate with those infidels?

287
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,060
We got caught by someone
who we have never expected from.

288
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,130
We are thankful to God,
who forced him to make a mistake...

289
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,160
...and reveal how the Templars
nested in our palace.

290
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,860
I hope you open your eyes before it is
too late and see what kind of a man he is.

291
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,460
Will you shake me up by the tales
with which you put El Aziz to sleep?

292
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,200
You do not act wisely, Ertugrul.

293
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,960
If you do not care for yourself,
at least care for your tribe.

294
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
They fell in the gutter on migration path
in the dead of winter.

295
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,500
Yes, your tribe reached
the Aleppo borders.

296
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,030
Their settlement in their new homeland
depends on...

297
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,560
...what El Aziz will utter.

298
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,530
His highness Ameer's only wish is
to see the so called uncle of his...

299
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,400
...who collaborated with
the murderers of his father, executed.

300
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,830
If you correct your mistake
and hand Sahabeddin Tugrul over to us...

301
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,930
...I would politely request your new homeland
from his highness Ameer.

302
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,830
A land won by betrayal would not
be a home but only hell to Kayis.

303
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,400
These fabrics are very nice.

304
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,500
We should order a couple of
new dresses for you with these.

305
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
We can also order one for Halime.

306
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,100
It would be a present.
It would cheer her up.

307
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,160
Look, Halime regained consciousness.

308
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,300
Get well soon. How are you?

309
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,130
Do you have any pain?

310
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,100
I am better, thank you.

311
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,100
My name is Leila.
I am the sister of Aleppo's Ameer.

312
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,100
So you are a sultan.

313
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,230
Yes.

314
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,060
How did it happen?

315
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,830
We were ambushed on the way to Aleppo.

316
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,930
I do not remember the rest.

317
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,860
You are very lucky.
You were on the brink of death.

318
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,330
The arrow hit you right above the heart...

319
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,130
...and you are being treated
in the palace.

320
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,960
Moreover, you are in my room.

321
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,000
I wonder whose idea that was.

322
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,830
Thank you.

323
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,930
I am recovering thanks to you.

324
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,600
I will never forget your good deeds.

325
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Did you come to our palace before?

326
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,530
No.

327
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
But I do not like palaces.

328
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't believe that anyone
can really be happy behind stone walls.

329
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,530
I also did not believe that anyone
could be happy in this palace, too.

330
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,200
And I turned out to be right.

331
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,200
My uncle was casted aspersions on.

332
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,200
He had to escape.

333
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,130
Now I do not even know where he is.

334
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,500
This is why I like loneliness.

335
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,430
Please do not take
her words personally, my girl.

336
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,230
She has no bad intention against you
in her words.

337
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,060
After her father and mother
were killed right in front her eyes...

338
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,130
...she has locked up herself in this room.

339
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,160
I see that our patient has recovered.

340
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
I am glad.

341
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
Thanks to you, your highness.

342
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,100
I am grateful.

343
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,300
I’m grateful to you for rising up like sunshine...

344
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,100
...to the lifeless rooms of my gloomy palace.

345
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,830
Leila.

346
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,600
I see that you are enchanted as usual.

347
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,060
I am in a high spirits today,
my dear governess.

348
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,100
Nasir has caught the goat herder
who abducted Sahabeddin.

349
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,960
Who was this brave man?

350
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,230
A troubler from the Kayis.

351
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,260
Kayi Bey's son Ertugrul.

352
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,560
Halime? Halime, my girl?

353
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,530
What happened?
