00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,030
"Vande Mataram" -"Vande Mataram"

2
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:44,248
India celebrates as an Independent country.

3
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:52,121
India announces
Hockey as it's National game.

4
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,127
Independent India wins it's first
World Cup for Hockey

5
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:02,033
"Vande Mataram"
-"Vande Mataram"

6
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,261
"Vande Mataram"
-"Vande Mataram"

7
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,866
On the occasion of the
64th anniversary of our

8
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,725
famous and historic
Chittibabu Hockey ground,

9
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:50,784
and to honor the patron of our village,
Late. Chittibabu,

10
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,034
our beloved leader and
sports minister, Rao Ramesh

11
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,350
is gracing us with his
presence as the chief guest.

12
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,346
He is the beloved son of
Yanam's soil and the saviour

13
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,201
of the lower communities
and our beacon of light

14
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,600
there is our leader!

15
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,433
My respects to my brothers, sisters,
elders present here today...

16
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:40,534
Seeing the youngsters gathered here today..

17
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:43,808
I'm reminded of the
Great Poet Sri Sri's words.

18
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:48,308
"Love your nation, spread the goodness."

19
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,284
Sir that quote is by Gurujada Apparao.

20
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,284
That's why I said that.

21
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,534
Unless I blabber that
Valmiki wrote the Mahabharata

22
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:58,326
and Bhagavata was written by Vemana,

23
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,600
The media won't show
my face on their channels.

24
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:07,350
I decided to turn that around
And they'd publicize about this ground.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,117
I give you my word today.

26
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:17,351
Our sportsmen's hockey sticks may be bent

27
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,750
I'll stand for you so
You don't have to bend.

28
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:26,042
I couldn't impede the freedom of players.

29
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,250
This historical ground as witness,

30
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,583
May we win the Cup this time!

31
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,625
I take leave.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,875
Sir... Byte...

33
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,917
Sir... Byte...

34
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,208
What a waste...

35
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,458
Sir... you..

36
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,542
What brings you here?

37
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,476
They say this ground is historical?

38
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,060
Yes, Sir!

39
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:01,809
I wanted to ask the Minister about that...

40
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,042
But who'll give the information now...

41
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,809
You want this ground's history?

42
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,625
Yes!

43
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,309
I know the right person.

44
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,173
- Come with me! I'll introduce him.
- Let's go.

45
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,393
Come! This is the Grandpa!

46
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,184
- Namaste!
- Namaste, Son!

47
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,893
Grandpa.. The Chittibabu
story you tell everyone

48
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,393
- tell him too..
- Alright...

49
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,583
Sure!! Definitely!

50
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:22,727
- I take leave.
- Okay.

51
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,917
- Thank you!!
- Tell them.

52
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,625
- Drink this juice first, son!
- Thank you!

53
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,809
- Chittibabu Sir...
- One Minute!!!

54
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,809
- Speak on the mic!
- Really?

55
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,226
Will it record everything I say?

56
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,458
We'll also show you on TV!

57
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,583
OK!

58
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,684
Chittibabu is not just a statue..

59
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,792
He's our God.

60
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,917
I was 16...

61
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:08,608
Even though India became
independent of British Rule in 1947...

62
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:15,197
The areas ruled by the French
weren't independent till 1954.

63
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:20,852
Including Yanam, they
remained French colonies.

64
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,977
It was the advent of
Genetic Farming in India.

65
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,494
The French Businessmen believed that
setting up Fertilizer factory

66
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,602
would reap rich profits.

67
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,518
That's when the real problem started.

68
00:06:40,518 --> 00:06:43,977
The effluents from the factory

69
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,869
were let into to the rivers and the oceans.

70
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:52,935
They decided to build
the factory on this ground...

71
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:57,143
In the region where
the ocean and river met.

72
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,810
But we wouldn't let go of our ground!

73
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:05,203
In that era, when land disputes arose...

74
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:07,203
They'd organize some competition,

75
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,268
and the winner won the land.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,893
If it was Cricket for the British
The French had Hockey.

77
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:20,994
So the Fisherfolk and the Frenchmen

78
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:23,018
had a Hockey match.

79
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,119
The Frenchmen were strong.

80
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:26,352
They had money.

81
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:27,977
What did we have?

82
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,352
Who was there to help?

83
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,643
At the 1948 Olympics...

84
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:36,685
The only Telugu man to play for India
was Chittibabu.

85
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:40,268
The town's hopes were pinned on Chittibabu.

86
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:43,060
Not only did he play for the team...

87
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,060
He was also the coach.

88
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:48,453
He saw me & said
"I see no fear in your eyes".

89
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,643
He said I should be the
Goalkeeper for the team.

90
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,518
I didn't let them score a single goal!

91
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:58,310
The French lost to us by 3 goals.

92
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:02,352
Thereafter, The Governor
started supporting us.

93
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:06,328
He said, Sports make people healthy.

94
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,018
He returned our Ground to us.

95
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:14,268
This is not a mere ground to us.

96
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:16,810
This is our Chittibabu's temple.

97
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:44,977
Hello?

98
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:47,203
- Hello, Brother?
- Yes, my dear?

99
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,102
Why'd you call at this hour?

100
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:51,435
Sanju's coming to Yanam on work...

101
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:53,935
Please take care of him...

102
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:01,328
Sanju's coming to Yanam??!

103
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,119
Why trouble him?

104
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,244
I'll do the job he's coming here for!

105
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,685
You're a college Principal.

106
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,977
You'd be busy...

107
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:11,643
He'll do it...

108
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,352
As you say...

109
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,810
You should be happy
your nephew is coming...!

110
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:21,227
He's like the festival
that falls on a Sunday.

111
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:23,435
Should we be happy for the festival..

112
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,852
Or be sad that it fell on a Sunday?

113
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,852
What did he do, Sir?

114
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,536
What will you be when you grow up?

115
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,328
Doctor... You?

116
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:39,727
I'll be an astronaut!

117
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:41,810
What about you, Sanju?

118
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:43,768
I...

119
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,602
I'll marry your sister.

120
00:09:49,852 --> 00:09:52,935
He's coming here with a plan...

121
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,268
If my daughter ends up liking him...

122
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,411
'I'll be your daughter's husband'
(On Tv)

123
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,477
And become your...

124
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:04,310
So funny...

125
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,477
My dear...

126
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,060
The exam tomorrow

127
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:09,185
- are you prepared?
- Yes, Dad!

128
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:11,036
What is (a + b)2?

129
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,036
A2+b2+2ab!

130
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,060
Who discovered it?

131
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,060
You don't know!

132
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,852
What the heck did you study?!

133
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:25,018
It felt like Mike Tyson hit me...

134
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,869
Depression over Bay of Bengal...
(On TV)

135
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,893
To cause Cyclones.

136
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:34,935
It's boiling hot and a cyclone is coming?!

137
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:30,477
Right... right.

138
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,417
Serve me some lentil stew(Sambar)...

139
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,518
I need more!!

140
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,477
- Careful...
- Now, it's enough.

141
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,185
Would like some Sambar?

142
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,768
Aunty!! Your Sambar is matchless!

143
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,393
Reminds me of my childhood!

144
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,227
We had a great time, no?

145
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,994
He wanted to be an astronaut, Uncle!

146
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,060
He said he'd be my sister's ...!

147
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,662
Bugger!

148
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,286
How many time have I told you!?

149
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,203
Don't speak while eating!

150
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,768
You won't be able to swallow properly!

151
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:13,102
You were the one spoke first, Father!!!

152
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,078
I'm older, you ass!

153
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,935
I've experience in eating. You're a kid!

154
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:20,161
It'll choke your throat and you'll die!

155
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,185
Eat silently!

156
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,435
Eat silently!!!

157
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,435
One must eat silently.

158
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:39,602
Sir!

159
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,227
Welcome, Sir!

160
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,518
- How're you?
- Good!

161
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,866
You come, very, very happy!

162
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,060
This is Mr. Arvind.

163
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,227
GM of Tetrostar Medical Company.

164
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,518
Sir! Welcome, Sir!

165
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,102
Please come in.

00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,079
Please...!

167
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,661
- Don't worry... OK?
- Sir!!

168
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,685
Mr Sharma has come from Delhi.

169
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,310
I'll take care of it.

170
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:03,768
See you.

171
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:05,185

172
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:08,518

00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,102
Please tell him, yourself.

183
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,786
Namaste, Rao Ramesh ji.

184
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,518
I'm Arvind.

185
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:40,935
Marketing Head, TetraStar.

186
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,786
Let's not talk shop.

187
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,810
And talk business.

188
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:49,435
The State of Andhra has...

189
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:51,703
Not a fruit to pelt,

190
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:55,369
Not a fruit to ripen
Not a bud to flower.

191
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:56,744
Not a Scorpion to bite...

192
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:57,953
Not a snake to crawl...

193
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:59,161
Not a leg to move...

194
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,185
Not the fate for anything.

195
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,994
Sir... They didn't get a thing!

196
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:09,411
You won't learn 2000 year old Telugu.

197
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:11,411
And you'll learn a newborn Hindi.

198
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,810
Is this right?

199
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,744
Sir is saying... you
anyway don't know Telugu.

200
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:17,352
Sir doesn't know Hindi!

201
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:20,352
Speak business in English.

202
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,643
- I can speak Telugu.
- Speak, Speak.

203
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:26,352
Tetra Star Medical Company
wants to build a factory in Yanam.

204
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:29,477
We need Mr Chittibabu Hockey Ground.

205
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:30,810
Which Ground?

206
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,935
The one you were invited to...

207
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:37,185
Talk.. Talk...

208
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:39,661
There are going to be
a lot of opportunities.

209
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:43,036
Like Hospitals, Shopping
malls, Multiplexes...

210
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,810
It'll help development.

211
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,810
That may be...

212
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,810
What about My development?

213
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,935
- He understands nothing!
- I'll explain!

214
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,185
What's your project value, Sir?

215
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,018
100 crores.

216
00:14:58,643 --> 00:14:59,643
Wah!

217
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,643
It's a big project!

218
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:06,578
Yes. 10% is your share.

219
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,435
If the work is smooth, 2% extra!

220
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:11,435
So, 12 crores?

221
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:12,518
Yes...

222
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,060
Let's do it!

223
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,536
But, why THAT ground?

224
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,893
I'll show you another site.

225
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,536
15 acres in the centre of the city.

226
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
- Prime. Take it for free.
- Sir!

227
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:30,477
They'er taking care of us! We
need to take care of them too!

228
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:31,935
Take it... OK!

229
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:35,727
Sharma ji.. What's
this! I need that ground!

230
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,185
- Ask him!
- Hello!

231
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,935
- You don't want it?
- No, Sir.

232
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:41,911
- You want that ground?
- Yes Sir!

233
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:44,869
I want that ground alone. Nothing else.

234
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,893
See..

235
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,935
Now tell me the real worth of your project!

236
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,977
Er... that...

237
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:56,018
I'll tell you. 500 crores!

238
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,477
Right?

239
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:02,268
I'm a PhD in corrupt politics.

240
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,643
That was a nice game
with a Sports Minister.

241
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,477
Now let's talk!

242
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:09,602
What's the percentage?

243
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,286
12% Sir.

244
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,536
- For 500 crores it'd be?
- 60 crores, sir.

245
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,494
Plus 1% for lying to me.
Plus 2% for speaking in Hindi,

246
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:21,828
15%, Sir!

247
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,352
75 crores fix!

248
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,227
Sir, GST!

249
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,994
That has to be paid!
It's uploaded in the system!

250
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:32,619
- Why...?
- Sharma Ji...

251
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,369
We're all in business.

252
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,744
He runs a company, I run a party.

253
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,328
Everyone needs money.

254
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:40,203
Work will done smoothly, Tell him...

255
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:42,786
I need 2 days,

256
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,768
to discuss with my boss and tell you.

257
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,661
Your boss...?

258
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:49,227
So you aren't the head?

259
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,060
Just the bed...

260
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:57,411
Sharma Ji, Why'd you waste my time
with this man?

261
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,018
Time waste...

262
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:02,768
Mr. Rao!

263
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,203
If I see you outside my house again,

264
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:16,036
No one will ever see you again.

265
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,536
Eh, that's quite a threat from your Uncle!

266
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,786
Have you learned a magic trick, Uncle?

267
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,578
- Magic... Bugger!
- Start the bike!!!

268
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:25,602
Go.. Go.. Go.!!!

269
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:30,018
Buggers! Not just them...

270
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,810
I'll break the bones of anyone
who dares look at my daughter.

271
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,370
You called?

272
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:36,578
I am talking about another idiot!

273
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,911
Idiots? Sathya... Your
dad's talking to you.

274
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,477
Yes, Dad?

275
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,619
- Are you an idiot?
- NO!

276
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,643
- Play your game!
- Ok.

277
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,310
Sathya, come...

278
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:52,935
Who was that about and
why does uncle seem tensed?

279
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,701
It's about my sister's classmate, Mahesh.

280
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,852
He is a nice chap but is a bit dark.

281
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,369
Yeah, right! Like we are qualified
to talk about colour.

282
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:02,633
If you have his photo, show me.

283
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,185
Instagram.

284
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,727
He dares flirt with a girl
from this household?!

285
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,768
Tell me what to do.

286
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,435
- But why?
- Say.

287
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,643
- Why?
- Say.

288
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,435
Shall we go and hit him?

289
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,143
Yup, hit him.

290
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,727
- Yes, hit him.
- Let's go and hit him.

291
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:22,286
(movie playing on the television)

292
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,411
If you are Nanda,
I am Bhadri…Bhadrinath (on TV)

293
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,435
So what?

294
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,643
Sanju, stop the bike. Stop!

295
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,619
- You…
- Why did he come here suddenly?!

296
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,328
Stop! Stop!
Where will you run off to?!

297
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:32,893
Stop!

298
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,518
Brother-in-law, I get the picture.

299
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:35,786
You are here to hit me.

300
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,227
But, have I ever misbehaved with Divya?

301
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,786
I am genuinely in love
with her, brother-in-law'.

302
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,953
Who do you think you are
calling me 'brother-in-law'?!

303
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:41,994
Satya. I am Satya, here.

304
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,786
If you are Satya, I am
Vitta... Mahesh Vitta.

305
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,727
- So waht...?
- What nonsense!

306
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:48,036
Let him go!

307
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,352
Hey, sit down. Sit down.

308
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,810
Sit down.

309
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,578
Why are you shouting? He is right here.

310
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:53,768
I've gone mad.

311
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:54,893
Get your phone.

312
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:56,352
Get your phone out.

313
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Look at this girl here.

314
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,185
I don't want this girl. I want his sister.

315
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,352
Come here.

316
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,310
Who was talking about you?

317
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,227
I like this girl.
Do you know her?

318
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,188
- You said you came for me…
- Bro, not this girl…

319
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,453
Look at the girls beside this one.

320
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:22,786
Look how beautiful they
are with that makeup on.

321
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,227
Oh shit!

322
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,078
If you want, I can fix you up with
any one of those girls.

323
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:25,954
Forget about this girl.

324
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,352
That is exactly what I'm saying.

325
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:28,717
Look at those girls beside her.

326
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:32,977
They have a lot of make up on and have
their hair in weird hairdos and look fake.

327
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,310
But look at this girl.

328
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:37,286
She looks very natural without make up
and has a sweet smile.

329
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,310
She looks very real.

330
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:42,185
In this day and age,
I don't if we can find good people or not.

331
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:44,036
But finding people who
are real is very difficult.

332
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,602
It's rare to find a girl like that.
Shouldn't I introduce myself to her, then?

333
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,935
You saw all that in a single photo?

334
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,227
Wow! All knowing one!

335
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,477
But just between us,
let me tell you something.

336
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,185
That woman is a very big goon.

337
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,435
We are specialists in dealing with goons.

338
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:59,602
What's that girl's name?
What does she do?

339
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,143
Where does she live?

Where she has gone to...?

377
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:14,460
She's looking at us...

378
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,418
Heyy!!!

379
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:18,264
She's gonna hit us!

380
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:18,973
I am not that one.

381
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:20,473
Why us? Sathya...

382
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,598
Sathya...

383
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:24,515
Sathya!!!

384
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:28,723
You wait!!! Where do you
think you're going?!

385
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,973
You cheated me!

386
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:32,223
How dare you?!

387
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:34,431
I'll kill you today!
- Stop it, Madam.

388
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:35,598
What should I do?!

389
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,473
Praise the Lord...

390
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:42,640
Madam.. Please, please stop!!
Hit him!!! Not me!!

391
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:43,431
Stop you...

392
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:44,765
Please stop her anyone.

393
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:46,598
Madam, please listen me.
- Let me go.

394
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,972
Please understand...

395
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,056
Madam! What is this?!
Don’t do this, madam!

396
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,056
Hands up.
Hands up, madam.

397
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,640
Who the hell are you guys?

398
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,473
We…we…we are…

399
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,722
We are your fans, madam.

400
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:58,306
Fans?!

401
00:23:58,473 --> 00:23:59,473
…yeah…fans…fans…

402
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,640
What do you mean?

403
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,430
A while ago, you overtook two
fellas on your bike, right?

404
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,015
We are the ones who lost to you, madam.

405
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,723
But when I saw you
riding a bike better than me,

406
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:09,680
I came to tell you that …I became your fan…

407
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,286
I have many such kind of fans.

408
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:15,353
If you don’t mind, can we sit down
and talk for two minutes?

409
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:16,586
I am tired.

410
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,116
What do you want to talk about?

411
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,890
Well... why did you hit him?

412
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,681
I am a Hockey player.

413
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,948
I have to focus on my game.

414
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,873
I practice morning and evening!

415
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,648
How'd I get time to study?

416
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,239
That idiot... his name is Vishnu

417
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:42,987
The college topper!

418
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:47,890
He fell in love, didn't study
I copied his paper and failed!!

419
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:49,890
He deserved to be thulped!

420
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,535
Great... Great...
- Great... Great...

421
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,223
I have another exam tomorrow!

422
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,470
I don't how I'll manage that!

423
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,503
Madam... Please calm down.

424
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,348
Please don't raise the stick...

425
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:05,853
Please sit.

426
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,401
Listen to me, Please.

427
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,384
Is that all?

428
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:12,193
You'll write the exam tomorrow.

429
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:12,890
Pass,

430
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,473
I'll make sure you do.

431
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:15,931
You?!

432
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,098
Madam! Those who trust their
fans have never been cheated!

433
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:20,626
We are very special fans.

434
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,015
Trust me.

435
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,074
A daughter-in-law, devoid a
mother-in-law, is noble. (Telugu Proverbs)

436
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:27,972
A Mother-in-law, without a daughter-in-law,
is virtuous. (Telugu Proverbs)

437
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:28,973
What!?

438
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:31,083
For one, who is starving gruel is ambrosia.
(Telugu Proverbs)

439
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:31,907
Why are you quoting irrelevant
and meaningless examples?

440
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,547
Is your conversation meaningful?

441
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:34,597
Is there a connection
between us and studies?

442
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:36,032
How are you going to
her pass the examinations?

443
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,096
I don’t know the nitty-gritty details…
I like her...

444
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:39,696
and I have given my word
that I will help her pass.

445
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,204
That means, you will help her study.

446
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,430
Hey, this idea sounds good???

447
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:48,031
You mean… now, you will help her study
and make her pass the exam.

448
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:04,731
Did you bring slips?

449
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:08,347
I swear, I know nothing, Sir.

450
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:10,716
I know, you know nothing.

451
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:12,553
That's why...

452
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:18,426
Sir...
Take it. Use it.

453
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,490
Copy from it.

454
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:35,345
Uncle...
- What, Son?

455
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,011
Do you know why I came to Yanam?

456
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,303
I swear, I know nothing.

457
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:45,885
Well, I wanted to get married to Divya…

458
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:46,886
What?!

459
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:48,553
No…

460
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:50,601
Unfortunately, I
have fallen in love with

461
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,465
another girl and decided
to get married to her.

462
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,595
Thank god!

463
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:56,737
She said that she wouldn’t get married
until and unless she clears her exams.

464
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:57,946
She is a student in
the college you work at.

465
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,302
Will she definitely
marry you, if she passes?

466
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,095
I swear, Uncle
-Oh God!

467
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,401
I swear on myself, Uncle.

468
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:04,761
Thank God!!!

469
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,136
Sir... Sir, Sir!!!!

470
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,053
Yes, Son?

471
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,511
She's cheating, Sir.

472
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:21,803
Lavanya... Hide it!!!

473
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,511
Where, Son?
- With her, Sir!

474
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Where, Son?

475
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:29,844
It was there, Sir.

476
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:35,595
What's your jealousness?
Concentrate on your paper!!!

477
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:38,838
You go ahead.

478
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,678
Hi..Hi..Hi.

479
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:06,761
Hi...

480
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,969
Hey, why did you come here?

481
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,760
My coach is really strict.
No one can come inside!

482
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,386
I made you pass. You couldn't say thanks?

483
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,511
I won't.

484
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:18,928
Why?

485
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,636
You did it because you like me.

486
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:26,802
It wasn't some great social service.

487
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,427
Hello..Hello... Madam!

488
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,094
You have too much expectations.

489
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,303
I'm not interested in you.

490
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,386
Like Mr Venkatesh in the movie 'Raja'.

491
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:37,261
I can see your success from
a distance like your friend.

492
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:38,761
Oh?

493
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:40,845
A fan yesterday

494
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,595
A friend today.

495
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,636
What's your plan for tomorrow?

496
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:46,136
See...

497
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,095
Every relationship needs an upgrade.

498
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:49,654
One needs to get to the next level.

499
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:51,547
A fan yesterday, Friend today.

500
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,511
Who knows about tomorrow?

501
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:56,636
Let's see.

502
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,678
That's my number.

503
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Save it under 'friend'.

504
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:16,677
Hey, play well...

505
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:17,428
Give me...

506
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:18,803
Throw like this... not like that

507
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,470
Okay?

508
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,469
Lavanya... get up.

509
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,470
Present Sir.

510
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:38,678
Sorry sir.

511
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:59,928
[Humming Song]

512
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,178
You!

513
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,345
Why are you here?

514
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,095
I came for you... because you came
into my dream last night.

515
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:14,302
Shut up bro, I know you
came to see Lavanya.

516
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,010
Then, why are you asking me?

517
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:17,095
Show her to me.

518
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,011
On one condition,

519
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:21,011
If you help my love life, I'll help yours.

520
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,678
Come on time..
- Good lord. The Coach!

521
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Hey Mahesh!

522
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:26,428
Mahesh!

523
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:27,928
Good morning, Sir!

524
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:30,261
You guys carry on.
- OK, Sir.

525
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:32,344
Why'd you skip practice?

526
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,385
Sir.. Err...
- Who is this?

527
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:36,052
Cousin, Sir
-Cousin?

528
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,760
Yes, Sir..
- He doesn't look like your cousin...

529
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:41,510
I was born at midnight, he, at dawn.

530
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:42,678
Correct Sir... 6:30am.

531
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,469
He is famous body builder, Sir.

532
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,636
Cousin, show him your muscles!
- Yes, Sir?

533
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,469
Cousin, not like that!

534
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,220
Oh!

535
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,678
Sir!

536
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,052
Yes.. I'm a body builder, Sir.

537
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:52,553
Yes, Sir

538
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:53,719
He is great bodybuilder.

539
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,802
He hasn't practiced and has become weak.

540
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:56,844
That's why you can't see them.

541
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:58,345
If you could permit him...

542
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:00,969
Well, running around this track twice,
will help reduce body fat.

543
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,770
But, only if you agree to it.
If you don’t approve, we will not do it.

544
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,928
Run on the track alone
without disturbing anyone.

545
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:07,761
OK, Sir!

546
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:08,678
Done, Sir.
- Okay, Sr.

547
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:09,595
Lower your hands.

548
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:10,885
Sorry...
- It's OK!

549
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:11,970
15 rounds daily.

550
00:31:12,095 --> 00:31:13,095
OK Sir.

551
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:15,261
Come...

552
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:17,035
I'll show my play ground, follow me.

553
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Hold it like this

554
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:20,135
and hit it like that...

555
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:22,220
If that doesn't work, listen to the Coach.

556
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Vita!!

557
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:24,886
Who's he?

558
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:26,969
My cousin Sir. I took
the Coach's permission.

559
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,427
That won't be enough.

560
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,510
I'm incharge!

561
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:30,678
Did you take my permission?!

562
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,885
Bro, Just say Good morning!

563
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:35,344
Good morning, Sir!
- Good morning!

564
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:36,760
Have a good run!

565
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,970
Sir, Crow droppings is there on your head.

566
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,136
What?

567
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:49,095
Who's that? He's threatening children.

568
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:52,427
He just looks like King Kong,

569
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:53,548
but he's like Kung Fu Panda.

570
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:56,970
Where's your shoe?!

571
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,886
Who's that Vita?

572
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:01,261
My friend, Sir. Sunny Leone.

573
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,594
Bye, Sir!
- Bye Sunny!

574
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:05,345
2 more rounds, Vita!
- OK!

575
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,552
You won't be allowed
here again without shoes!

576
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,385
He's a School PT master.

577
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,386
Our Coach lets them to use the ground.

578
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:14,053
Your coach has a big heart.

579
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:16,011
Who is he?

580
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:19,678
Asif. He transferred here from Bengaluru.

581
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,302
District Vice Captain.

582
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:22,345
Coach's Pet.

583
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:24,719
But he has more airs than the Coach.

584
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,011
He scared of me.

585
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,761
Asif... Vitta calling you Justin Bieber.

586
00:32:29,553 --> 00:32:32,136
Why Bro?
- That's why... to rag you!

587
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,261
Just finding who is afraid of whom.

588
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,011
Bro.. Lavanya, Bro!

589
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:37,886
Here, take.

590
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:38,636
Come on.

591
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:40,011
Bro... No!!

592
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,761
Don't worry... now I'm
her friend, not a fan.

593
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:45,928
Hello!

594
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:49,261
Why are you here?

595
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,719
I called you thrice and
messaged you 4 times. No reply.

596
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,303
Why?

597
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:54,553
Tell me why?

598
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,886
Do friends do this?

599
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,771
It’s ‘cause you are my
friend, I was confident

600
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:57,885
enough to come up
to you and ask you.

601
00:32:57,886 --> 00:32:59,594
If I was really interested in you...

602
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,475
I would worry about you getting offended
or not speaking to me anymore.

603
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,420
That's the freedom in Friendship!

604
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:05,838
I have a song for you in this mood.

605
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:12,629
"Love means caring... friend means sharing"

606
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,296
Vitlapuram Mahesh Rao!

607
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:15,421
Grandpa!

608
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:17,671
How many times have I told you,
Call me Vitta!

609
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,213
Mahesh Vita
-Get lost!

610
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:22,130
I named you after me and my dad!

611
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,046
I WILL call you that!
- Your grandpa?

612
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,671
Yes Bro... You see the Chittibabu statue?

613
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:31,879
The last of his generation.

614
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,170
80 not out!
He was a good friend of his!

615
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:36,004
You're a hockey player, Grandpa?

616
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,004
Yes, I am!

617
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:41,255
Oh God! You had to ask him!!

618
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:47,296
Chittibabu is a God for this town.

619
00:33:55,255 --> 00:34:00,087
You're standing on the soil
the God walked on, you know?

620
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:01,504
Grandpa, someone is calling you.

621
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,088
Hey, come on... run...
- Who's it?

622
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:11,713
Sucks...

623
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,170
What's this?

624
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,379
Please see the next one...

625
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,505
Nothing to see here.
Make something that'll go viral!

626
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:22,796
Rao Ramesh is the political
mentor for Jagan and Chandrabu!

627
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,130
Do that..

628
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:25,379
So that's over the top...

629
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,045
One when it's over the top, would it trend
you're getting paid for it!

630
00:34:29,046 --> 00:34:29,505
OK, Sir.

631
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:31,045
Go...

632
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,755
Sir, A call.
- Turn on the speaker...

633
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:36,255
Sir, Chittibabu Hockey
Ground has a hoary history!

634
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:37,421
Who the heck is that?

635
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:39,588
Sports Director Raghu, Sir.

636
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,130
Raghu, Yes, Tell me.

637
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:45,963
An Academy on that Ground
has given the State many players.

638
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:46,921
Yes...

639
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:49,670
A few days ago, you gave
a speech at that Ground, Sir.

640
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,671
Yes...

641
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,338
The ground has a great history, Sir!

642
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,005
Enough with the history!!!

643
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:58,713
Have you never seen my cutouts "The living
legend, leader that created history."?!

644
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:01,629
Enough with the bullshit.

645
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,087
I need that ground for Lease for
a Hospital. Can you get it done?!

646
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:06,921
Tell me that first!

647
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:10,796
Nothing illegal.

648
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,045
There's only one way.
Only legally.

649
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,296
Tell me that first!

650
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:18,671
We do only legally, not illegally.

651
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,588
Sir...

652
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:24,046
This Academy is authorized
by the Govt to select State players.

653
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:28,046
If an Academy doesn't perform well,

654
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:30,545
It gets pushed to the
Under-performing category.

655
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,088
Such Academy Grounds go up for lease.

656
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,046
Then do it...
But, Sir...

657
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,170
At least 2 players per
year from the past 4 years...

658
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,005
have been selected from this academy.

659
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:45,421
The Coach gives fantastic training too.

660
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:46,713
Who?

661
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,005
Shahrukh Khan?

662
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
Sir...

663
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:54,170
Most Indians think Shah Rukh
Khan is the Hockey Coach.

664
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:56,005
No one cares about the coach.

665
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:01,383
Tell me what to do, to push the
academy in Under-performing category.

666
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:06,590
They shouldn't participate
in any tournament.

667
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:10,966
None of their players
should be selected in A category

668
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,050
Let's do it, then.

669
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,067
Sir, the players will
definitely get selected!

670
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,550
They MUST NOT!

671
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,925
Sir...?
- Make sure they don't.

672
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:21,424
But they'll question who's doing this...

673
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,050
Manage the situation...

674
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,258
What shall I say, Sir?

675
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,883
Say, Illuminati.

676
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,383
The Illuminati?!

677
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,966
If we get caught red-handed,

678
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:36,007
blame something that can't be seen,

679
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:40,341
and people will keep
wondering and we escape...

680
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:41,633
That is Illuminati.

681
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,133
Oh!

682
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,133
Proof sir?

683
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,840
Proof is only for the Truth.

684
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:49,549
Lies don't.

685
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,716
Whose quote is this?

686
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,633
Must be some great poet, Sir.

687
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:56,675
Aravind Swamy did. In the film Dhruva.

688
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,091
Yes! I remember.

689
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,508
Go do the job.

690
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:05,341
Sir... My promotion...

691
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:08,466
Get the job done first.
- What kind of sports director he is...?

692
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,591
Hello... Angry bird!

693
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:16,883
You want me to drop you?

694
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,008
Get lost!
You flirt.

695
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:31,508
I'm flirt, right!

696
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:33,633
But not stupid.

697
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:39,633
Okay.

698
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,550
Why do you like me?

699
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,633
Lav...

700
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,132
Everyone has two characters in their soul.

701
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,550
1. Someone whom everyone knows

702
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,883
2. Someone whom we alone know!

703
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,257
Each time I meet you...

704
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,883
That second person come.

705
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:01,800
I like him very much.

706
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:04,966
So, pure selfishness!

707
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:09,550
Elders always say...

708
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:13,216
to never trust a man... and
to be careful around them...

709
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:14,925
Because of men like you.

710
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:17,591
Lav!

711
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:18,925
Lav!

712
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,716
At first, boys like me
will rouse your suspicions.

713
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,026
But as you keep meeting us,
you would begin to trust us.

714
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,466
Give it some time,
I am sure you would definitely like me.

715
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Oye!

716
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:42,800
What?

717
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:48,133
Whenever you hear my call
and turn to look at me...

718
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,675
I have to undivided
attention for 3 seconds.

719
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:54,341

745
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:04,091
Beer?

746
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:06,091
I don't drink...

747
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:09,133
Really?!
I drink rarely

748
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,258
I thought you'd give me company...

749
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,091
It's OK.

750
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:14,340
It's made with Barley, no?

751
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,341
Heard it's good for the heart. I googled it

752
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,716
I'll start today

753
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,257
Really?!

754
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:21,883
I can't make up a better lie.

755
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:26,258
Cheers!
- Thank you.

756
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,174
Why this beer sitting?

757
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,175
All OK?

758
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:35,975
I'm OK.

759
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:37,508
I'm done.

760
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,383
I have been confused since morning.

761
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,196
That's why... this is my second beer.

762
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:55,489
Ok, My parents will be here..

763
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:56,508
Let's go..

764
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:57,716
Wait.. Wait..

765
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,716
Your parents aren't home?

766
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:01,008
No!

767
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:02,609
Why did you ask me to climb the ladder?

768
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,113
I could have taken the stairs, right?

769
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,925
I wanted to see if you
could scale the wall for me.

770
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:09,341
It's OK.

771
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:10,966
You did struggle.

772
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,059
You aren't interested in me at all?

773
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,355
You aren't interested in me at all?

774
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,300
No.

775
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,684
You're lying.

776
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:02,545
Open your eyes.

777
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:04,530
If I open you can't move

778
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:06,586
Go.

Oh... He came with Vitta.

787
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,169
He's been with Lavanya quite a bit.

788
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,170
Lavanya too...

789
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:37,795
Lavanya...

790
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:39,295
Who's he?

791
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:40,003
What?

792
00:44:40,128 --> 00:44:42,003
This is a ground.

793
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:44,003
Players have a discipline.

794
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,920
It'll become a market if
all and sundry come here.

795
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Look, Asif.

796
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,503
You're in the men's team,
I, in the Women's Team.

797
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:54,378
That's All. Correct me in my game.

798
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,461
But my personal life is not your business.
Understood?

799
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:00,711
Go...

800
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,687
Good news!

801
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:14,645
An open tournament for all clubs in India.

802
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:17,853
Dhyanchand Memorial Academy
has hosting it for 60 years!

803
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:28,395
Namaste, Sir!

804
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:29,811
Namaste. Is Raghu in?

805
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,477
He's talking about the tournament.

806
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,561
Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Trivandram,
Chandigarh, Amritsar...

807
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:36,686
Chennai 6 times hosting this tournament.

808
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:40,478
Now, Mohali from Punjab state
is hosting this tournament.

809
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:42,103
I'll wait here

810
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,102
They didn't allow us to come for trials.

811
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:46,853
I wonder if they've cornered us in purpose

812
00:45:47,603 --> 00:45:50,353
Our ground is in the
underperforming category.

813
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:54,812
Everyone's speculating this ground
will be leased to someone.

814
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:57,227
But Raghu didn't tell me...

815
00:45:57,228 --> 00:45:59,228
How could he? He signed the order...

816
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:01,895
See.

817
00:46:05,603 --> 00:46:07,228
The kids are good!

818
00:46:07,603 --> 00:46:09,770
You didn't select even one?

819
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,230
They have sidelined Dist. Captain, Nasser.

820
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,520
Hey...

821
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,186
His tea is good!

822
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:17,788
Biscuit, even better! Come!

823
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:20,270
Don't change the subject.

824
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:25,811
What can I do if the Board didn't select?

825
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:29,812
Why is our Ground in the
Underperforming Category, Raghu?

826
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:32,895
The Academy has no funds.

827
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:34,895
Give me the tea!!

828
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,894
If there are no funds...

829
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,353
a Ground goes into the
Underperforming Category,

830
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:43,937
Lease it out and develop
another ground with that Money

831
00:46:44,145 --> 00:46:46,102
The rules and regulations are clear.

832
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,103
But why our ground?!

833
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:49,728
We didn't get selected this year alone!

834
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:51,437
They get selected every year!

835
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:55,603
The kids that come to
practice are dirt poor!

836
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:59,603
They can't afford an education
without an achievement in sports!

837
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:00,687
Why are you doing this?!

838
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:04,062
You don't know the
difficulties of being a G.O.

839
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:07,062
Politicians, Superiors and their pressure!

840
00:47:07,395 --> 00:47:10,562
After a lifetime of signing
wherever they ask me to sign...

841
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,895
my hands are ready for surgery!

842
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,895
Let it go...

843
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:17,227
I can only do you a favour as a friend.

844
00:47:17,228 --> 00:47:18,852
So you will help me?

845
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:20,145
Not with the Ground.

846
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:21,228
No way!

847
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:23,937
I'll speak to the Sports Minister myself.

848
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:25,936
What?

849
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:29,103
You'll talk to the Sports
Minister yourself?!

850
00:47:29,895 --> 00:47:32,187
He's the one who asked me to sign!

851
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,144
Who's this Raghu?

852
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,145
Sir... I told you about Mr Murali...

853
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,937
The Coach

854
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,686
The Army Man?

855
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,895
Namaste, Sir
- Tell Me...

856
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:49,520
Tell me...

857
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,227
Our kids went for selection...

858
00:47:52,228 --> 00:47:53,770
But no one got selected, right?

859
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,978
If they play irresponsibly,
how will they be selected?

860
00:47:57,353 --> 00:48:00,019
The Govt's funds, your hard work...

861
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,644
all gone to waste...

862
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,144
No, No Sir... The boys were good..

863
00:48:03,145 --> 00:48:04,812
Then they should've been selected.

864
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:08,020
The selection process was wrong.

865
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,395
Let me...
- Sir... Let me tell them, Sir!!!

866
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:13,145
If the kid fails, the teacher is at fault.

867
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,145
Not the Education Minister.

868
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:17,145
Sir is a Minister!

869
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,811
Sir, that's not what he meant.

870
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:21,312
Then?

871
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:23,812
I'll tell you sir, in a way
you can understand.

872
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:27,437
Why is our Ground in the
Underperforming Category?

873
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:29,603
Every year 4 players get selected.

874
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:30,852
This was the only year...

875
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:32,853
That's why the Underperforming Category.

876
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:34,270
Look...

877
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:37,561
The money from Leasing
an Underperforming Ground

878
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:39,853
can be used to develop 6 grounds!

879
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:42,270
We'll make sure you remain Coach.

880
00:48:42,312 --> 00:48:44,478
And the Lease is for a good cause.

881
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,812
For a Hospital...

882
00:48:46,312 --> 00:48:48,853
How long can people
travel for medical facilities?

883
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:51,353
We too need a Multi Specialty Hospital!

884
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,728
You know...

885
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,062
A farmer's son...

886
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,187
couldn't reach a hospital in time...

887
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,270
and lost his life.

888
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:00,103
His parents too died of grief.

889
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,102
His brother became a naxalite.

890
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:04,062
Sir.. That's a movie script.

891
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,727
These memes, I tell you...

892
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:15,103
Make movie scripts
look like real life stories.

893
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:17,103
Look...

894
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:19,103
I'll do you a favour.

895
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:22,645
There's a ground near the Bus Stand

896
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:24,644
I'll sanction the funds..

897
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,020
And make it an Academy.

898
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:28,561
Let's take the students
and the Statue there..

899
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:29,727
And practice there happily...
- Good idea, Sir...

900
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:30,728
No Sir...

901
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:33,218
Give that Ground to the
Hospital and let ours be. Please.

902
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,187
Logic...

903
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:38,102
I know what to do...

904
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,687
What the heck is this...
- Sorry, Sir.

905
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:42,019
Sir, Take him away!
- Come, Let's go!

906
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,645
One minute...

907
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:48,478
What are you staring at?

908
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:50,645
You're angry?

909
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,311
You want to kill me?
- Sir... No Sir...

910
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:56,895
Take it...
- NO... NO Sir!!!

911
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,228
Shoot.

912
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:01,478
Take the Gun. It's OK. Take it

913
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:03,852
Take it, My dear.

914
00:50:03,853 --> 00:50:05,853
What's this?!!!

915
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:08,394
He took the gun, to shoot me!

916
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:10,395
He's an Army man, Sir!

917
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:13,352
Yes, The Army
You couldn't advice him?

918
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:15,352
I'll tell him Sir... I will...

919
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:17,352
Get up.. Get Up!

920
00:50:17,353 --> 00:50:19,352
Come... Let's go.

921
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:21,353
Sir. Sorry Sir. We'll leave.

922
00:50:27,187 --> 00:50:29,812
You wanted to shoot him?

923
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:31,811
We were fortunate!

924
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,269
The Minister has other plans.

925
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,227
His plans are none of your business.

926
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:38,644
Is it his business to
say my players are bad?

927
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:41,644
So your players are
the best in the world...

928
00:50:41,645 --> 00:50:43,644
A Tendulkar, a Rohit Sharma..

929
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,311
What?
- It's done Sir.

930
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:46,312
OK. Leave.

931
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:50,769
Didn't you say your players were amazing?

932
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,062
Here. The Dhyanchand Tournament Fixers.

933
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,978
Play, win the tournament
and get your recognition.

934
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:01,311
Then the people will say,
your players are the best

935
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:03,312
Not you! Understood?

936
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:14,727
The Hospital next to a
bus-stand makes sense...

937
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:16,312
It does.. But...

938
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,728
I think the Hospital is a
front for something bigger.

939
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:22,937
I just can't figure what it could be...
Sir!

940
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:24,187
What if we file an RTI?

941
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:26,520
RTI?
- Yes, Sir.

942
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,187
Asif's Brother is a lawyer.

943
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,395
Maybe he could help us legally...

944
00:51:30,603 --> 00:51:32,353
Would he help?
- Let's ask, Sir

945
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:34,728
The LS Mills Girl's
Tournament is coming up...

946
00:51:34,812 --> 00:51:35,812
We need to select the team

947
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:37,102
What are you on about?!

948
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:39,102
I don't know how to save the Ground.

949
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:39,937
And you come...

950
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:42,125
Bhoopal...
State Players list is ready sir.

951
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,936
So what?

952
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:45,937
I need to select the Girl's team, Right?
Yes, Sir.

953
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,978
I'll do it then.

954
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:48,520
Asif.
- Sir!

955
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Come here.

956
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:51,827
Select the players for the
LS Mills Girls tournament.

957
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:52,770
Yes Sir.

958
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:53,812
OK?
- Yes, Sir.

959
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,312
Asif's decision is final.

960
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:56,478
Come, Bhoopal.

961
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,978
Sneha, Ramya Pair Up.

962
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:16,062
Come On.

963
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,145
Girls

964
00:52:20,353 --> 00:52:21,728
Forwards Pair up.

965
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,727
If you beat the Center Line
Defence, You're selected Asif!!!

966
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:26,103
Asif!!

967
00:52:26,145 --> 00:52:27,185
What about the Boy's team?

968
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,103
Ask them to get ready first.

969
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:29,978
Go...

970
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:30,728
You go and tell the goalkeeper.
- Okay.

971
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:31,103
Asif!

972
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:32,145
Keeper...

973
00:52:32,353 --> 00:52:34,936
What are boys doing here
during Girls' Selection?

974
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:36,561
Get out! Out!!!

975
00:52:36,562 --> 00:52:37,562
Asif!
- Get out!!

976
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,062
Hey... yeah?

977
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:41,978
Who's my partner?

978
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:45,103
You aren't selected. Get out.

979
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:47,728
So girls. Get ready.

980
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:49,353
Why?

981
00:52:50,312 --> 00:52:51,228
Didn't you say...

982
00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:53,478
That I could question the game
and not your life?

983
00:52:53,853 --> 00:52:56,937
Your performance is
bad. So not selected. Sorry

984
00:52:57,353 --> 00:52:59,186
You're making a mistake, Asif.

985
00:52:59,187 --> 00:53:01,186
Excuse me? What do you mean?

986
00:53:01,187 --> 00:53:03,686
Didn't you hear what Sir said?
My decision is final.

987
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:06,062
You are out of the team. Leave.

988
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,395
Dude... she's angry

989
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,020
You're angry? Is it a warning?!

990
00:53:13,312 --> 00:53:14,645
I asked you to get out!

991
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:17,227
You're holding a grudge against me!

992
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,227
What's she on about?!

993
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,227
Get out...
- Get out!!!

994
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:23,687
Don't you understand?!
Waste of time!

995
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:36,312
Let's go

996
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:37,478
What happened?

997
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:38,562
Nothing. Let's go.

998
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,687
Tell me...

999
00:53:42,812 --> 00:53:43,812
Asif.

1000
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,853
You're not selected. Get out!

1001
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:47,853
He says my game is bad

1002
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,519
That I have no discipline.

1003
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,519
No Discipline? What's
he thinking about himself?!

1004
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Chuck him up, Come on!

1005
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,062
I'll handle it.
- Okay.

1006
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:55,603
Let me talk to him.

1007
00:53:55,687 --> 00:53:56,687
No need.

1008
00:53:56,728 --> 00:54:00,812
Listen to me... Lavanya.
I'll talk to him. Come.

1009
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,519
I want all the markings to be set.

1010
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,812
No changes in the last minute.

1011
00:54:04,853 --> 00:54:06,437
Not another word...
Keep quiet!

1012
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:07,478
Asif...

1013
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,894
What do you want?

1014
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,643
Lavanya...
Huh?

1015
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:11,978
Lavanya has to play.

1016
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:13,687
So?

1017
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,270
Bro...

1018
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:16,186
The thing is...
Hands off...!

1019
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:18,187
OK.. Cool

1020
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,562
The thing is...

1021
00:54:19,645 --> 00:54:21,561
Please take her in the team, Bro.

1022
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:23,562
No.
- You sure?

1023
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:25,562
Confident?
- Yes..

1024
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,145
Ok, Lavanya. Bro is scared. Let's go.

1025
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:30,603
Come here...

1026
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,602
Who's scared?
- You, Boss!

1027
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,852
If you reject a player without trials,
it means you're scared.

1028
00:54:35,853 --> 00:54:37,852
It's OK, Bro. I understand you're a sissy.

1029
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:40,102
Let's go, Lav.
I'm ready for trials.

1030
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:40,603
OK...

1031
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,728
But who's ready to play with her?

1032
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:43,687
Bro...

1033
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:44,645
Girls...

1034
00:54:44,812 --> 00:54:46,892
You'll be selected in the
team if you play with her.

1035
00:54:47,228 --> 00:54:48,603
Is anyone ready?

1036
00:54:50,812 --> 00:54:51,312
See?

1037
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:53,562
No one wants to play with her, Boss.

1038
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:56,644
Because everyone knows she's a dummy.

1039
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:57,312
Hey

1040
00:54:57,313 --> 00:54:59,520
Wait.. I'm still talking...

1041
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:01,228
Bro...

1042
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:03,394
Why don't YOU play?

1043
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:04,853
Me? I can't.

1044
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:05,645
Why?

1045
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:07,687
Why because... Why because...

1046
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:09,686
Because Bro is a Warrior!

1047
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:11,227
He's gallant!

1048
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,144
He won't play with women.

1049
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:14,936
Send the men if you have any...

1050
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:18,937
The boys have left... So don't worry!

1051
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,270
Boys!

1052
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:24,103
Boys!

1053
00:55:24,395 --> 00:55:26,019
Oh no! Still, Boys are here...
I need to escape.

1054
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,144
Hey Mahesh!!!!

1055
00:55:27,145 --> 00:55:28,425
Hey Mahesh!!!!
- Bro, Sorry Bro!!

1056
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:29,937
Listen, Son.

1057
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,811
He can't even hold a stick...

1058
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:35,769
I would catch it if I saw it.

1059
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:36,478
Where do they come from?!

1060
00:55:36,479 --> 00:55:38,102
Asif. I'm ready.

1061
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:38,853
Oh!

1062
00:55:39,062 --> 00:55:40,520
Girl. Don't do this...

1063
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:41,728
It's OK. Hold the stick.

1064
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:42,812
I'll take care.

1065
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:43,520
No listen..

1066
00:55:43,521 --> 00:55:44,770
Listen to me!!!
Come.

1067
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:46,743
Please listen to me, Lavanya.

1068
00:55:47,312 --> 00:55:49,978
Please listen to me...
- First, you don't worry.

1069
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,520
Hitting during the game is a foul...

1070
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,562
It's not a fight. Be careful...

1071
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,020
Hold it properly!

1072
00:55:58,728 --> 00:55:59,978
It's OK if we lose.

1073
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:02,103
But we'll have self respect.

1074
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:05,437
I'll run to the front.

1075
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:08,103
Pass the ball immediately.

1076
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:09,978
I'll take care of the rest.

1077
00:56:10,478 --> 00:56:12,770

1081
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:25,145

Zero seriousness!

1083
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,895

Grandpa... This is beyond you...

01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,852
I've been running around
with the State Players list.

1152
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:35,312
He's no player. It
was a fluke.. That's all!

1153
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:39,187
How will you find him
in the State Players list?

Vicky, don’t swing the bat.

1155
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:47,041
Sir, this is Abdulla, Asif’s brother.

1156
01:02:47,152 --> 01:02:48,170
Hello Sir...
- Hello Sir, how are you?

1157
01:02:48,194 --> 01:02:49,587
I am good and what about you?
- All good sir.

1158
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:51,837
We have filed RTI, as you know sir.
We have received report.

1159
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:52,611
What did the report say?

1160
01:02:52,612 --> 01:02:54,132
The whole area is around 10 acres sir.

1161
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:56,318
Leaving only ½ acre to hospital...

1162
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,026
they allotted the rest of 9 ½ acres to
Tetra Star Medical Company.

1163
01:02:59,027 --> 01:03:00,526
What is Tetra Star, sir?

1164
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,367
Tetra Star is a multinational
Medical company.

1165
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:04,611
Many countries have banned this firm sir.

1166
01:03:04,944 --> 01:03:07,624
Even in our country too, most of the
states have banned the company.

1167
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:10,236
If that Company sets its foot here,
not only this ground...

1168
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:13,089
but the adjoining 14 villages
will get adversely affected, sir.

1169
01:03:13,277 --> 01:03:15,277
How to stop this company
from making an entry, sir?

1170
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:16,559
There is only one way to do it.

1171
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:19,235
This ground should be delisted from
the underperforming category.

1172
01:03:19,236 --> 01:03:21,860
To achieve that, we don’t require
to win the Dhyan Chand tournament...

1173
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:24,652
but only need to defeat
Francis club in qualifier.

1174
01:03:26,194 --> 01:03:28,914
Then, we will have the chance
to get ‘gag order’ from the court, Sir.

1175
01:03:37,277 --> 01:03:38,652
Yes man! This is the only way out.

1176
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:41,753
But, one thing only registered clubs
can participate in the tournament.

1177
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,897
If that is so, shall we
start a club and register it.

1178
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:44,944
What!!!

1179
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:46,444
Don’t take so lightly.

1180
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,527
To start and register a club,
you should possess a home ground.

1181
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:52,651
Even to consider the academic ground on
which you practice regularly as yours'...

1182
01:03:52,652 --> 01:03:55,052
you have to shell down 12
lakhs to our department as rent...

1183
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:57,277
5 lakhs for registration...

1184
01:03:57,527 --> 01:03:59,253
and miscellaneous amounts to
various people to get work done.

1185
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:00,902
Total expenditure will be 20 lakhs.

1186
01:04:01,361 --> 01:04:03,527
You mean to say, if money is there,
we can achieve it.

1187
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:05,361
You are taking about Money!

1188
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:10,944
To pay fees for your daughter,
when you sold your bullet, I bought it.

1189
01:04:10,986 --> 01:04:12,274
To this day, my wife nags
me about why I bought

1190
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:15,152
the vehicle, when
don’t know how to ride it.

1191
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,902
Are you contemplating
about selling your house?

1192
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:24,401
Even if you planning to sell it,
I don’t have the money.

1193
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,486
You may ask why?

1194
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:27,572
I have kept the cheque
book in my wife’s locker.

1195
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,402
Here take the money.

1196
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:32,111
What is this?

1197
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:33,736
I sold my home.

1198
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:41,194
Are you insane?

1199
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:43,561
Don’t deliver shocking news to me…
I am a sugar patient.

1200
01:04:43,611 --> 01:04:46,611
How could you sell your house?
You have two nubile girls at home.

1201
01:04:46,694 --> 01:04:47,671
How can you perform
your daughter’s

1202
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:48,920
marriage, if you have
sold the lone property?

1203
01:04:48,944 --> 01:04:51,068
Money will not help now.

1204
01:04:51,069 --> 01:04:53,295
Application should have been registered
six months earlier.

1205
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:57,694
Listen to me, give their money back and
get you house re-registered on your name.

1206
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:01,196
Here, see the application … bears
date of registration as six months back.

1207
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:05,861
Will you know sign...
Or should I pay any kickbacks to you.

1208
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:11,736
You will not progress.

1209
01:05:12,277 --> 01:05:13,277
You will not progress.

1210
01:05:13,486 --> 01:05:14,526
You will not progress.

1211
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:15,527
Go.

1212
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:17,152
Thank you.

1213
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:21,944
You will come back with same speed
with which you are proceeding now.

1214
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:26,486
To play that tournament,
five state players are required.

1215
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:28,069
What is his name?

1216
01:05:28,111 --> 01:05:29,111
Asif...!

1217
01:05:29,527 --> 01:05:31,318
You may manage by including
a jack, jill or somebody.

1218
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:31,861
Ok?

1219
01:05:32,236 --> 01:05:35,902
But a national player is a must in
the squad. How do you overcome that?

1220
01:05:37,444 --> 01:05:40,361
Not just a national player,
I have an international player with me.

1221
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:42,402
Who is he?

1222
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:43,694
Sundeep Naidu.

1223
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,111
Ex-captain.

1224
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,777
India-A under 21 team of 2014.

1225
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,902
He is bigger wacko than you.

1226
01:05:51,111 --> 01:05:54,111
Do you know he was expelled from the
team because of his mental instability?

1227
01:05:55,736 --> 01:05:56,819
Now he is back.

1228
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:58,944
Back!!!!

1229
01:06:01,194 --> 01:06:02,194
Oh God!

1230
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:06,361
What these two mental
people will do together?

1231
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:13,819
Grandpa...

1232
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,194
What a pleasant surprise?

1233
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:17,962
They said you will not venture out?
You have come to Wedding!!!

1234
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:21,152
Aa, but his lover’s
marriage is underway, right?

1235
01:06:21,402 --> 01:06:23,486
So came to witness
his emotional outpouring.

1236
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:25,402
Hi-five.

1237
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:33,027
Don’t worry my boy, my
first love too was a flop.

1238
01:06:33,111 --> 01:06:34,819
Didn’t I marry your granny?

1239
01:06:34,944 --> 01:06:36,735
Your father’s love too was a fiasco

1240
01:06:36,736 --> 01:06:38,526
He has married your mother then, right?

1241
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:42,611
Love failure is in our hierarchical genes.

1242
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:46,569
You will find a very good and noble girl.

1243
01:06:46,694 --> 01:06:49,026
Ha.. Don’t feel distraught, my boy.

1244
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:50,944
Bro... Bro...

1245
01:06:51,902 --> 01:06:54,819
you know, you will feel bad,
then why did you come for wedding bro.

1246
01:06:55,152 --> 01:06:57,736
No Bro, I loved her from my heart.

1247
01:06:57,861 --> 01:07:00,569
She too sincerely told that
our love will not work out…

1248
01:07:01,027 --> 01:07:03,319
but bro… what to do?
Pain still exists.

1249
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:07,527
Anyhow, You boys are great bro?
- Stop grieving, my child.

1250
01:07:13,152 --> 01:07:15,402
Mother, She is Lavanya.

1251
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:19,902
Hey, Introduce her to me.

1252
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:23,527
Wait Mom, I doubt whether
she will talk to me or not, now.

1253
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:31,736
I'll try.

1254
01:07:32,902 --> 01:07:33,902
Lavanya…

1255
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:35,277
Lav…

1256
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:36,444
Listen to me.

1257
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:39,861
Ok, Sorry.

1258
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:42,444
I have apologised, right.

1259
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:44,319
Hi Sir...

1260
01:07:44,652 --> 01:07:46,986
you are ex-hockey player Sanju…

1261
01:07:47,194 --> 01:07:49,361
Oh, Sorry, Sundeep, right?

1262
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:52,486
I know an acquaintance by name Sanju.

1263
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,319
I like him very much.

1264
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:58,191
He is the first male person
to pillion-ride my bike.

1265
01:07:58,611 --> 01:08:01,111
He doesn’t know how to play hockey.

1266
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,027
A small confusion with the name…

1267
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,402
Now I got clarity.

1268
01:08:05,986 --> 01:08:06,986

Guys...

1335
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:42,527
good news for you.

1336
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:45,111
We are registering our academy as a Club.

1337
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:48,319
Ok.

1338
01:11:49,277 --> 01:11:52,902
So we are going to participate in the
Dhyan chand memorial tournament.

1339
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:54,486
WoW. Super.

1340
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:55,694
Yes!

1341
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:56,861
First time...

1342
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:00,027
First time we are going to represent Yanam.

1343
01:12:00,069 --> 01:12:01,069
How?

1344
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:04,902
Every district has its own club. And
Francis club Vizag represents it, right?

1345
01:12:05,069 --> 01:12:06,069
Yes, Khayyum.

1346
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:08,602
That’s why we are playing
qualifier match against them.

1347
01:12:09,027 --> 01:12:13,276
Winning that match will enable our ground to
be delisted from the underperforming category.

1348
01:12:13,277 --> 01:12:13,736
Hi, Sir..

1349
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:15,101
Sorry for the late...
- Sundeep…

1350
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:16,402
He is my cousin.

1351
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:17,069
Hi Sir...

1352
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:18,943
Hi…
Come.. Join the team.

1353
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:20,486
How is that possible sir..?

1354
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:23,236
We don't have a national
player to form a club.

1355
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,319
We do have.

1356
01:12:24,902 --> 01:12:27,111
2014, Junior Indian team captain...

1357
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:28,402
Mr. Sundeep Naidu.

1358
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:30,276
Welcome to the team Sundeep.

1359
01:12:30,277 --> 01:12:31,777
Sir... sir.. Sorry Sir.

1360
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:33,526
If I had been told this before,
I would not have come here.

1361
01:12:33,527 --> 01:12:34,920
I thought that you call
me for a casual meet.

1362
01:12:34,944 --> 01:12:39,319
That day I helped Lavanya
while she was in trouble.

1363
01:12:39,694 --> 01:12:42,027
Now, I can't play hockey.

1364
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:43,526
Please Sir... sorry.

1365
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:44,818
Sundeep, Once listen to what I am telling..

1366
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,611
Let me finish...
- Please sir.

1367
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:47,861
Please sir.

1368
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:49,985
I need to settle down...

1369
01:12:49,986 --> 01:12:50,986
I should take​ care of my Mom...

1370
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:52,467
I have a lot of responsibilities Sir.

1371
01:12:54,777 --> 01:12:55,694
Don't take me wrong.

1372
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,277
Sir, why are you pleading with him..?

1373
01:12:57,819 --> 01:12:59,939
Only one who is passionate
about his nation can play?

1374
01:13:00,652 --> 01:13:01,361
What is he?

1375
01:13:01,361 --> 01:13:02,361
Get lost.

1376
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:03,069
Hey Asif...

1377
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:04,651
Behave yourself. Just a minute.

1378
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:05,611
Sir please… please…

1379
01:13:05,612 --> 01:13:07,795
Why are you trying to stop him sir?
He is telling truth.

1380
01:13:07,819 --> 01:13:09,194
Why are you requesting me sir?

1381
01:13:09,694 --> 01:13:12,512
If they had played well initially,
neither this ground would have fallen

1382
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:15,235
into this category nor the situation
has arisen to request my help.

1383
01:13:15,236 --> 01:13:16,694
What did you say, bro?

1384
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:19,236
Nation... passion...
Rhyming is superb

1385
01:13:19,611 --> 01:13:21,776
If he had focused this much…
he would have won the world cup.

1386
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,194
Hey what are you taking?

1387
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:24,486
Hey Asif... Wait.

1388
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:27,151
How dare you, you lay hands
on my team member, you rogue.

1389
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,152
Do you think there is nobody to question?

1390
01:13:29,236 --> 01:13:29,944
Listen to me.

1391
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:30,861
What do you know about him?

1392
01:13:30,944 --> 01:13:32,901
You don’t have an iota of skills as
compared to sublime artistry in hockey.

1393
01:13:32,902 --> 01:13:35,068
You don’t even deserve to watch him play.

1394
01:13:35,069 --> 01:13:36,902
Do you know why he left playing hockey?

1395
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,444
Sir, please save me.

1396
01:15:36,277 --> 01:15:37,944
See sir, how they thrashing me?

1397
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:41,944
Hey Idiot!, you have started the quarrel
and now you playing abominable games.

1398
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:44,069
What???

1399
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:44,944
What???

1400
01:15:45,111 --> 01:15:46,236
Exhibiting intimidated?

1401
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:48,907
If you have guts, show
your skills in the game.

1402
01:15:49,694 --> 01:15:52,110
Don’t indulge in petty activities.

1403
01:15:52,111 --> 01:15:54,031
Sir., we too trying to
highlight the same point.

1404
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:57,036
They couldn't tolerate their defeat and
thrashed him when he was alone.

1405
01:15:58,319 --> 01:15:59,319
What about you?

1406
01:15:59,527 --> 01:16:00,152
What..!?

1407
01:16:00,277 --> 01:16:02,527
Feeling egoistic because of
playing in a national squad?

1408
01:16:03,027 --> 01:16:04,067
We too played in our time.

1409
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:07,027
To this day, I am the district coach here.

1410
01:16:10,486 --> 01:16:11,486
Sir...

1411
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:13,811
We too telling the same point.

1412
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,027
Being District Coach...

1413
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:17,371
why are you involving
in petty activities..?

1414
01:16:17,986 --> 01:16:18,819
Okay Sir.

1415
01:16:18,986 --> 01:16:20,277
I respect your eldership...

1416
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:21,777
I'll ask you one thing?

1417
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:23,514
If you give the correct answer...

1418
01:16:23,694 --> 01:16:24,777
we will apologise you.

1419
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:25,402
Okay..?

1420
01:16:25,652 --> 01:16:26,652
Okay.

1421
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:28,819
They are accepted, Sir.

1422
01:16:30,027 --> 01:16:31,027
Sir...

1423
01:16:31,444 --> 01:16:34,069
If some piece of shit comes and
hits your friend...

1424
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:36,657
would you or would you
not avenge your friend?

1425
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:42,902
If some piece of shit comes
and hits your friend...

1426
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:45,866
would you or would you
not avenge your friend?

1427
01:16:46,652 --> 01:16:47,772
You must avenge your friend.

1428
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,116
A true friend is someone
who does exactly that!

1429
01:16:55,317 --> 01:16:56,317
Sir...

1430
01:16:57,567 --> 01:16:58,567
Sorry sir.

1431
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:00,859
See you, Sir.

1432
01:17:12,392 --> 01:17:15,809
I thought you would enjoy eating these.
So I worked hard all morning to make them.

1433
01:17:16,517 --> 01:17:19,809
But, you guys created such a mess.

1434
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:23,146
Why don't you cut your hair?

1435
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:24,692
Look at your hair...

1436
01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:26,151
Looks like a hooligan.

1437
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,276
His life is anyways ruined.

1438
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:31,192
And now are you going
to ruin yours as well?

1439
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:32,816
Okay, mother. We understand.

1440
01:17:32,817 --> 01:17:33,817
You are going to punish us today.

1441
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:35,639
We are not allowed to
sleep in our beds and

1442
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:35,960
you are not going to
feed us. Isn't that it?

1443
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,526
Done.
Let's go, guys.

1444
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,359
Hey, Hurry.

1445
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:41,276
Take that...

1446
01:17:41,277 --> 01:17:42,359
Darshi, bring rice.

1447
01:17:42,567 --> 01:17:43,984
Every says ‘Friends like family’

1448
01:17:44,984 --> 01:17:46,276
But for me, friends are family.

1449
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:49,034
Most people find their
friends in classrooms.

1450
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:52,067
But I found my best friend
on the hockey ground.

1460
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:39,751
Darshi was the one who taught me hockey.

1461
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:42,900
He and Rahul were defenders
and I was the striker.

1462
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:44,316
Please, I have no patience left.

1463
01:18:44,317 --> 01:18:45,484
Hey fool...

1464
01:18:45,984 --> 01:18:49,067
Only if you play defense, you would
understand the mindset of a defender.

1465
01:18:49,276 --> 01:18:51,566
Only then you can succeed
in playing an attacking game.

1466
01:18:51,567 --> 01:18:52,442
Well, I really have no energy left now.

1467
01:18:52,484 --> 01:18:52,942
Let's move.

1468
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:53,692
Please leave me alone.

1469
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:55,191
Come on…
Please no.

1470
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:55,859
Rahul, tell him.

01:18:55,859 --> 01:18:56,484
Hey, Get up.

1472
01:18:56,485 --> 01:18:58,441
Darshi, no. Please.
- Hey! Get up! Come!

1473
01:18:58,442 --> 01:18:59,234

1483
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,984
I scored 9 goals in a club match.

1484
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:45,292
They said that it was a national record.

1485
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:47,502
With that match, I caught the
attention of national selectors.

1486
01:19:47,526 --> 01:19:49,502
They took me directly from
there to the Indian camp.

1487
01:19:49,526 --> 01:19:51,929
It took me 2 years and
gradually, in due course,

1488
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:54,234
I became the captain
of India A under 21 team.

1489
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:57,776
For the 2014 Under 21 World Cup,
we went thr0ugh heavy practice.

1490
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:00,567
During that time, I really
didn’t talk to anyone much.

1491
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,070
Brother, no one from
our team is listed in that.

1492
01:20:15,084 --> 01:20:16,500
Even brother Darshi name...

1493
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:19,459
Hey.

1494
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:21,084
That is the final list.

1495
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:23,334
Look at that.

1496
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:33,834
No one from our team is listed in that.

1497
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:36,500
It is quite evident...

1498
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:01,527
Ok sir. I will make a move.
- Okay.

1499
01:21:03,459 --> 01:21:04,459
Greetings sir.

1500
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,792
Hey Darshi, come.

1501
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,834
Sir…

1502
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:09,810
They have displayed
the list in the notice board.

1503
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:12,292
My name is not there in the list, sir.

1504
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,250
Look Darshi...

1505
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,584
I know you are an excellent defender.

1506
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,917
But I don’t know what criteria selectors
have considered while selecting.

1507
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:24,334
All these selectors have come from
different states and I cannot ask them.

1508
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,999
Last two years, what
you said may be right sir.

1509
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,750
But, this time you presided
as the defence selector, sir?

1510
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:34,959
Hey?

1511
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:37,709
Idiots. Do what I say?

1512
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:41,941
Are you day dreaming
of catching the national

1513
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:43,458
selectors’ eye and getting
a place in the national camp,

1514
01:21:43,459 --> 01:21:45,250
just as how your friend did?

1515
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,999
Are you all trying to
follow in his footsteps?

1516
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Huh…what?

1517
01:21:50,067 --> 01:21:51,859
If so, what are we supposed to do here?

1518
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:53,025
Not like that sir.

1519
01:21:53,026 --> 01:21:55,026
What do you mean?
Have you come to question me now?

1520
01:21:55,512 --> 01:21:57,088
I have not come to question you, sir.

1521
01:21:57,267 --> 01:21:58,809
I have come to seek justice.

1522
01:21:58,934 --> 01:21:59,934
What is Justice?

1523
01:22:02,142 --> 01:22:03,475
What does your father do?

1524
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:06,309
My father, sir.
- Yes, your father only.

1525
01:22:07,225 --> 01:22:08,308
My father is a fisher men sir.

1526
01:22:08,309 --> 01:22:09,309
Ohh!!!

1527
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:11,395
Does he own a boat?

1528
01:22:11,809 --> 01:22:12,809
No sir.

1529
01:22:13,017 --> 01:22:14,267
We hire a boat and run it.

1530
01:22:14,725 --> 01:22:16,005
You have rented the boat, right?

1531
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:17,823
Then, don’t you aspire for own boat?

1532
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,600
If you own a boat, your lives will prosper.

1533
01:22:21,309 --> 01:22:22,338
In that case, why aren’t
you living with your

1534
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:23,391
father and supporting
him in realising this?

1535
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:24,475
What are you doing here?

1536
01:22:25,642 --> 01:22:28,309
Listen Darshi, Things have changed now.

1537
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:31,828
Destitute should not entertain big dreams.

1538
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,350
Go… go…

1539
01:22:33,559 --> 01:22:36,100
Go and catch fish with your father.

1540
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,349
Let’s forget about hockey
and other such things.

1541
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:41,100
Meet me after 1 year, if any job
vacancy arises, will look into it.

1542
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:42,934
Sir… Sir… Sir… Please sir…

1543
01:22:44,184 --> 01:22:45,267
Sorry sir… Sorry.

1544
01:22:45,934 --> 01:22:47,809
Please understand sir.

1545
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:50,975
There is nothing in my
life other than hockey.

1546
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,861
Hockey is my life sir.

1547
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,433
Please pardon my mistake, if any sir.

1548
01:22:54,434 --> 01:22:55,434
Hey...

1549
01:22:56,892 --> 01:22:58,350
Please understand sir.

1550
01:22:59,142 --> 01:23:01,101
Hockey is my childhood dream, sir.

1551
01:23:03,059 --> 01:23:06,952
If this chance slips by,
I will not get a second chance in my life.

1552
01:23:07,559 --> 01:23:09,441
Please show empathy, sir.

1553
01:23:09,892 --> 01:23:13,634
If I don’t get now, then
death is the only option.

1554
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:19,891
Ramakrishna sir, look here sir.

1555
01:23:19,892 --> 01:23:22,267
Darshi is resorting to
emotionally blackmail us.

1556
01:23:22,434 --> 01:23:26,434
He is saying he will commit suicide,
if we don’t select him in the team.

1557
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,350
Hey Darshi...

1558
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:33,434
First figure out, whom you are
speaking to and what you are speaking?

1559
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,892
Hey! You guys, You too going
to blackmail us tomorrow like this?

1560
01:23:38,642 --> 01:23:39,642
Get out all of you.

1561
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,809
You go and die Darshi sir.

1562
01:23:44,392 --> 01:23:45,934
The biggest hockey player??

1563
01:23:45,975 --> 01:23:46,559
Sir...

1564
01:23:46,642 --> 01:23:48,350
Sir... please listen to me
Please Sir…

1565
01:23:48,475 --> 01:23:49,600
Sir... please listen to me.

1566
01:23:49,684 --> 01:23:51,368
Beg you to condone me,
in case I had committed any blunder sir…

1567
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:52,558
Hockey is my passion.

1568
01:23:52,559 --> 01:23:54,224
Please pardon my mistake, if any sir.

1569
01:23:54,225 --> 01:23:55,809
Plead you to listen me sir…

1570
01:24:05,517 --> 01:24:09,517
He is saying he will commit suicide,
if we don’t select him in the team.

1571
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,517
You go and die Darshi sir.

1572
01:24:18,442 --> 01:24:20,984
Darshi, Rahul called me many times.

1573
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,545
I am quite busy in practice session
that's why I didn't attend calls.

1574
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:27,784
If I attend their calls...

1575
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,700
Darshi…

1576
01:24:52,742 --> 01:24:54,409
Hey! Do not be foolish.

1577
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,492
Darshi…

1578
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:01,784
Darshi…

1579
01:25:01,784 --> 01:25:02,784
Please come.

1580
01:25:04,492 --> 01:25:06,409
Rahul, please leave me.

1581
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:07,659
Go...

1582
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:08,992
Go...

1583
01:25:14,534 --> 01:25:15,034
Rahul...

1584
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:16,534
Rahul...

1585
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:17,742
Doctor...

1586
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:18,867
Doctor...

1587
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,385
What happened to Darshi, bro…?

1588
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:23,575
Nothing, man.

1589
01:25:23,909 --> 01:25:24,991
He was in the next room.

1590
01:25:24,992 --> 01:25:26,034
You take rest.

1591
01:25:26,534 --> 01:25:27,534
Doctor...

1592
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:29,325
Sister...

1593
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:31,492
Give me some water…

1594
01:25:33,492 --> 01:25:37,534
It is an accident case… One lost life…
another one's leg fractured.

1595
01:25:40,825 --> 01:25:41,867
Take rest.

1596
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,950
Sister...

1597
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:44,159
Sanju...

1598
01:25:44,534 --> 01:25:46,158
Hey Sanju, Tell me truth…
What happened to Darshi?

1599
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,700
Nothing befell Darshi.

1600
01:25:47,992 --> 01:25:50,325
He was in the next room.
- Tell truth.

1601
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:51,950
I will call him.

1602
01:25:51,951 --> 01:25:53,283
Tell truth…
what happened to Darshi?

1603
01:25:53,284 --> 01:25:54,700
Nothing happened to Darshi.

1604
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,700
Take me to him. First take me there.

1605
01:25:58,075 --> 01:25:59,075
Doctor...

1606
01:25:59,325 --> 01:26:00,325
Darshi…

1607
01:26:00,492 --> 01:26:01,200
Darshi…

1608
01:26:01,367 --> 01:26:03,199
Reveal the truth? What befell Darshi?

1609
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,200
Tell me what befell Darshi?
- Nothing happened to him.

1610
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:14,899
Sanju, what happened to my leg?

1611
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:17,117
What happened to my leg, sanju?

1612
01:26:18,575 --> 01:26:20,241
What happened to my leg, sanju?

1613
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:20,950
Sir, please you go out.

1614
01:26:21,117 --> 01:26:22,575
What happened to my leg, sanju?

1615
01:26:24,534 --> 01:26:25,534
Sanju...

1616
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:27,367
Sanju...

1617
01:26:27,825 --> 01:26:28,825
Sanju...

1618
01:26:34,784 --> 01:26:35,784
Sanju...

1619
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:39,409
Darshi was killed.

1620
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:42,784
Don't leave anyone who
related Darshi's death.

1621
01:26:43,242 --> 01:26:44,700
Sanju...

1622
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,825
Sanju...

1623
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:57,534
Sanju...

1624
01:26:58,617 --> 01:27:00,075
Sanju...

1625
01:27:01,367 --> 01:27:04,284
Darshi was killed.

1626
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,700
No, Sundeep, no…

1627
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:48,784
if you beat me, you would
have to answer to a lot of people.

1628
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,450
You will never ever
play hockey in your life.

1629
01:28:57,784 --> 01:28:59,659
Your career will be ruined.

1630
01:29:01,284 --> 01:29:02,909
Darshi is dead.

1631
01:29:04,242 --> 01:29:05,909
He was killed.

1632
01:29:06,409 --> 01:29:07,784
You killed him.

1633
01:29:16,034 --> 01:29:17,075
You killed him.

1634
01:29:17,367 --> 01:29:18,742
You killed him.

1635
01:29:42,784 --> 01:29:43,867
Strike him.

1636
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:47,117
Don’t leave him, beat him…

1637
01:29:48,825 --> 01:29:52,074
He pounded so savagely that 4 people
got hospitalized. All are Govt. Employees.

1638
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:54,034
The whole incident in
recorded in CCTV cameras.

1639
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,200
Hey, Manoj... what are you talking?

1640
01:30:01,075 --> 01:30:02,699
Our Darshi lost his life.

1641
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:03,908
He lost his life.

1642
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:05,659
Please listen me...

1643
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:09,242
Do not let Sanju attend inquiry
under any circumstances.

1644
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:12,497
They are apprising they
will withdraw the case.

1645
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:15,534
If we reject their offer and go to court...
No one will save him.

1646
01:30:15,617 --> 01:30:17,200
His career will go to the dogs.

1647
01:30:18,409 --> 01:30:19,575
This is grave injustice.

1648
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:26,117
They declared that I was mentally unstable
and banned me from the sport for five years.

1649
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:28,242
And you think you can ban me?

1650
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,219
Sir, I left the game because
it didn’t make sense to

1651
01:30:30,243 --> 01:30:32,093
continue it when Darshi, who
taught me the game, was no more.

1652
01:30:32,117 --> 01:30:33,117
One died...

1653
01:30:34,117 --> 01:30:36,317
and it’s been five years since
I spoke to the other one.

1654
01:30:44,075 --> 01:30:46,760
In the politicking that engulfed you,
you have lost only the ground sir,

1655
01:30:46,784 --> 01:30:49,144
but in this politicking, we
have lost our best friend, sir.

1656
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:55,200
You don’t know who I am, till he revealed.

1657
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:59,533
If I was a substitute player in IPL who
ran on the ground with a water bottle...

1658
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:01,614
you would have created a fan page
and an army for me.

1659
01:31:02,659 --> 01:31:04,325
I am not telling you about players fame.

1660
01:31:05,075 --> 01:31:08,409
But they don’t pay the minimum
respect that a sportsman deserves.

1661
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:11,489
The world cup winning
women’s Kabaddi team went

1662
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:13,218
to their homes in share
auto. What does it imply?

1663
01:31:13,242 --> 01:31:15,200
Because, there was no one to receive them.

1664
01:31:15,909 --> 01:31:18,001
“This sport is big…
this is small”, I am not

1665
01:31:18,025 --> 01:31:20,117
notifying such petty
complaints to you, sir.

1666
01:31:20,617 --> 01:31:23,284
In our country, sports became
a business a long time ago.

1667
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,284
The companies and
businessmen decide which

1668
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:27,367
sport deserves an
audience and which doesn’t.

1669
01:31:28,325 --> 01:31:30,007
All that talk about making
money and get a job

1670
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:31,676
in sports is a discussion
that comes after.

1671
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,034
But, a sports person has to pay
a lot of money to get on the team.

1672
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:38,725
Our country will not change, Sir...

1673
01:31:40,325 --> 01:31:41,367
nothing will change.

1674
01:31:42,242 --> 01:31:43,242
We cannot change.

1675
01:31:43,742 --> 01:31:44,909
Sundeep, I am really sorry.

1676
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:45,617
Sir... sir...

1677
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:49,409
Why are you apologizing sir,
I don’t harbor anger against you?

1678
01:31:49,825 --> 01:31:51,617
I only feel pity.

1679
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,850
I was beaten and I
learned and healed from it.

1680
01:31:57,642 --> 01:32:00,267
Now you are in trouble then,
you too can get out of them.

1681
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:02,267
It will take some time.

1682
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:07,450
See you, Sir.

1683
01:32:27,934 --> 01:32:28,934
What is all this?

1684
01:32:29,084 --> 01:32:31,250
Allow us to do our work.
Please understand us, sir.

1685
01:32:31,334 --> 01:32:34,666
Without any notice, how can you come here?
It’s not allowed. Get last from here.

1686
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:37,038
We too possess a notice.
Whose permission do we need, sir?

1687
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:39,908
I am the in-charge of this ground.
My permission is required.

1688
01:32:39,909 --> 01:32:40,992
Who is this person?

1689
01:32:41,034 --> 01:32:42,075
Sir, Inspector sir…

1690
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:45,159
What is the problem?
Let them do their work. Go from here.

1691
01:32:45,325 --> 01:32:46,617
Wait.. One second.

1692
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:47,659
Officer, what happened..?

1693
01:32:48,117 --> 01:32:48,950
Why are you quarrelling?

1694
01:32:48,992 --> 01:32:50,325
We have court orders, sir.

1695
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:51,575
We have a court notice...

1696
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,366
Hold on… One minute… One minute…

1697
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:55,367
One minute…

1698
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:59,616
We have court orders with us, sir. After
verifying the facts, we can discuss, sir.

1699
01:32:59,617 --> 01:33:02,617
Hey, why are you creating
ruckus by calling police personnel.

1700
01:33:02,784 --> 01:33:03,991
This is our ground.

1701
01:33:03,992 --> 01:33:06,241
Don't dare to enter our ground.

1702
01:33:06,242 --> 01:33:08,562
Hey no one shall go to work.
Ask to come all of our people.

1703
01:33:08,617 --> 01:33:09,908
You are committing a big mistake.

1704
01:33:09,909 --> 01:33:11,283
Officer, just a minute…

1705
01:33:11,284 --> 01:33:13,950
Khayyum, call our attorney.
Ask him to come here.

1706
01:33:15,409 --> 01:33:16,909
Sir, Lawyer sir...

1707
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:20,658
Sir, Aravindji from Delhi
called on my phone.

1708
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:22,741
He said delegates from France
are going to visit the place.

1709
01:33:22,742 --> 01:33:24,325
Work hasn’t begun on the site, sir.

1710
01:33:25,034 --> 01:33:25,784
Didn’t start?

1711
01:33:25,909 --> 01:33:28,241
I spoke with department
officials and sent surveyors.

1712
01:33:28,242 --> 01:33:29,200
What surveyor’s sir?

1713
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:31,260
That lawyer instructed to carry
the notice and sit in the ground.

1714
01:33:31,284 --> 01:33:34,468
Not only players, now public has also
assembled in the ground and making a hullabaloo

1715
01:33:34,492 --> 01:33:37,866
Long live Chitti babu…
- Long live Chitti babu…

1716
01:33:37,867 --> 01:33:40,659
Stop... Listen to me.

1717
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:43,158
I request you all… please listen to me once.
- Long live Chitti babu… Long live Chitti babu…

1718
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,450
Stop...

1719
01:33:44,492 --> 01:33:45,575
Please listen to me once.

1720
01:33:46,534 --> 01:33:48,033
These people have no job or work…

1721
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:50,135
Now-a-day they are resorting to boycott
and strike for every small reason.

1722
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:51,867
Who is the lawyer, you said?

1723
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:53,409
Abdulla sir.

1724
01:33:54,034 --> 01:33:55,034
Abdulla...

1725
01:33:57,909 --> 01:33:58,909
Abdulla...

1726
01:34:01,034 --> 01:34:02,159
Send our people there…

1727
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:04,659
Ok sir.

1728
01:34:09,075 --> 01:34:10,617
Turn right... right...

1729
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:14,533
Have you booked rooms
for foreign delegates?

1730
01:34:14,534 --> 01:34:15,409
Yes sir.

1731
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:17,824
Take care everything carefully.

1732
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:20,450
It's Ok Sir... I'll take care everything.

1733
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:24,117
Why are giving breaks in between…
Pour them drinks without any outages.

1734
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:25,866
Those public there are on a ‘sit down’
and creating a commotion.

1735
01:34:25,867 --> 01:34:27,885
What are these people doing here,
coolly gulping drink after drink?

1736
01:34:27,909 --> 01:34:29,669
They will get hurt, if
they hear your words.

1737
01:34:29,784 --> 01:34:32,992
These are the people, who insinuate
and arouse public and divide them.

1738
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,760
They are creating a
chaotic situation there, sir.

1739
01:34:34,784 --> 01:34:38,700
I can’t foretell what is going to happen? But
I think, Govt. Is committing some blunder.

1740
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:40,547
This ground is of utmost importance to us.

1741
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,659
This ground is our identity.

1742
01:34:43,867 --> 01:34:46,617
They are together but in unison.

1743
01:34:46,867 --> 01:34:48,324
There are disagreements between them.

1744
01:34:48,325 --> 01:34:50,449
They are 100 ways to disassociate them…
you don’t worry.

1745
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:53,909
This ground news in presently
trending in Social media, sir.

1746
01:34:54,409 --> 01:34:57,200
Most of the people eagerly waiting
for that match, sir.

1747
01:34:57,617 --> 01:34:58,784
Aravind Sir...

1748
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:01,700
Can spectators start a game?

1749
01:35:02,534 --> 01:35:03,894
Player should be there too, right?

1750
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,200
Now regarding social media…

1751
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:10,825
I will arrange people to troll 10 messages
on Power Star and 10 trolls on Super Star…

1752
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:12,533
The fans of both the stars
will engage in bickering.

1753
01:35:12,534 --> 01:35:14,241
In the ensuing commotion… everybody
will forget about this ground issue.

1754
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:16,742
Then we can nonchalantly complete our work.

1755
01:35:16,784 --> 01:35:18,504
It appears this strategy doesn’t work, sir.

1756
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:22,534
If this doesn’t work,
then we will use the local emotion.

1757
01:35:22,742 --> 01:35:23,742
What is it?

1758
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:25,909
Stir local feeling…

1759
01:35:26,284 --> 01:35:31,284
Are you all eating food or crap,
He is an outsider and trying to divide us?

1760
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,242
Are you a local?

1761
01:35:33,325 --> 01:35:35,449
Hey sit down.
What are you talking?

1762
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:36,658
Sit down.
- Sit down.

1763
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:39,909
One minute… be quiet.
I'll talk to him.

1764
01:35:41,784 --> 01:35:42,992
What you asked is correct?

1765
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:45,075
I am not from this region.

1766
01:35:46,242 --> 01:35:51,075
But, when I worked on border, no one…
No one asked me this question.

1767
01:35:52,742 --> 01:35:54,158
I have not instigated anyone.

1768
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:56,409
They voluntarily came
forward for their ground.

1769
01:35:59,534 --> 01:36:01,294
Now shall we discuss
about the ground issue.

1770
01:36:01,409 --> 01:36:03,742
Sir, if even this also doesn’t work…
- doesn’t work…

1771
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:06,992
Then I have another weapon
of national importance.

1772
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,450
‘Caste’.

1773
01:36:08,742 --> 01:36:10,366
Whoever did it, he did an awesome job?

1774
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:12,200
Hey, you are Srinu's son, right?

1775
01:36:12,492 --> 01:36:13,034
Yes bro.

1776
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:14,324
Hey man, what happened?

1777
01:36:14,325 --> 01:36:16,033
While she is trudging with heavy work,

1778
01:36:16,034 --> 01:36:18,824
he is sitting with a person belonging
to another caste and creating trouble.

1779
01:36:18,825 --> 01:36:21,449
Caste?? What caste? You assigning
caste to little children?

1780
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,450
Go… Go away from here.

1781
01:36:22,575 --> 01:36:23,659
Sir, I am feeling panicky.

1782
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:25,909
Okay...

1783
01:36:26,075 --> 01:36:28,235
If any of these doesn’t
bring in the desired result...

1784
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,158
International matter.

1785
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,324
Who are you to interfere and tell us?

1786
01:36:32,325 --> 01:36:33,325
Get lost…Go away from here.

1787
01:36:33,326 --> 01:36:35,116
Who are you to expel me from the here?

1788
01:36:35,117 --> 01:36:36,324
You don’t belong to us.

1789
01:36:36,325 --> 01:36:37,617
You are a Pakistani. Go…

1790
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,700

I will do the same as long as I can.

1816
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:57,784
If you give me power once and
I'll not let the down from that power.

1817
01:37:57,867 --> 01:37:59,867
I'll come every 5 years

1818
01:38:07,867 --> 01:38:09,866
I'll change the system.

1819
01:38:09,867 --> 01:38:11,699
I'll do whatever I want

1820
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,949
I'll give tremendous speeches.

1821
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:15,992
Sold the country...

1822
01:38:16,575 --> 01:38:18,075
Where is your conscience?

1823
01:38:18,409 --> 01:38:20,075
Where did you hid that?

1824
01:38:24,534 --> 01:38:25,784
Where is your conscience?

1825
01:38:26,117 --> 01:38:27,784
Where did you hid that?

1826
01:38:32,117 --> 01:38:39,284
Oh! Citizen...

1827
01:38:39,992 --> 01:38:47,992
Won't you change?

1828
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:03,617
Grandpa!

1829
01:39:04,409 --> 01:39:05,950
Grandpa! Look at me.

1830
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:08,325
Grandpa!

1831
01:39:09,742 --> 01:39:10,742
Sanju!

1832
01:39:13,492 --> 01:39:15,242
See, what happened to him?

1833
01:39:19,659 --> 01:39:20,659
Grandpa...

1834
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:23,450
Grandpa...

1835
01:39:23,992 --> 01:39:24,992
Grandpa... get up...

1836
01:39:25,284 --> 01:39:26,284
Grandpa...

1837
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:28,742
Grandpa...

1838
01:39:30,325 --> 01:39:31,659
Grandpa... get up.

1839
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:10,325
Let’s all go together…

1840
01:40:10,784 --> 01:40:11,909
let’s not spare anyone.

1841
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:13,200
Let’s not spare anyone…

1842
01:40:13,659 --> 01:40:14,659
Let's go.

1843
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:15,534
Call every one of our people.

1844
01:40:15,534 --> 01:40:16,534
Hey, stop.

1845
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:17,700
Wait.

1846
01:40:17,867 --> 01:40:19,950
What you want to accomplish?
Where you want go?

1847
01:40:20,909 --> 01:40:23,829
You have stoked emotions in every aspect
and brought things to this level.

1848
01:40:24,742 --> 01:40:26,950
These fighting’s, and
blood are nothing new to me.

1849
01:40:27,159 --> 01:40:28,534
I saw these daily at the borders.

1850
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:34,742
At the borders, soldiers are putting their lives
at risk to save our people from enemy nations.

1851
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:38,617
By indulging in-fighting among ourselves,
we are belittling their sacrifices.

1852
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:41,408
Should we let go a person,
who committed grave crime unpunished?

1853
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:42,409
Hey... hey... hey...

1854
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,784
Try to find solution to every problem
by thinking with mind rather than heart.

1855
01:40:49,075 --> 01:40:50,760
Why are you stopping an aggressor
from seeking justice, sir?

1856
01:40:50,784 --> 01:40:53,051
Today we have come to this stage…
because we remained submissive.

1857
01:40:53,075 --> 01:40:55,475
Why are you stopping them
when they are fighting for justice?

1858
01:40:55,659 --> 01:40:57,324
To stand up against
injustice and fight is important.

1859
01:40:57,325 --> 01:41:00,354
But equally important are
why to fight and how to fight.

1860
01:41:01,034 --> 01:41:03,301
Anyhow why are you indulging in it?
What are you doing here?

1861
01:41:03,325 --> 01:41:05,885
You are anyway going to France and
will be settling there, right?

1862
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:08,074
Born here, brought up here.

1863
01:41:08,075 --> 01:41:10,480
Yet after completing
studies…people you fly off

1864
01:41:10,504 --> 01:41:12,909
to richer pastures like
UK, USA and settle there.

1865
01:41:13,784 --> 01:41:16,784
Thereafter, occasionally you post
a message in either face book or twitter…

1866
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:20,559
complaining such and such facility is not
there in our village and this should change…

1867
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:25,325
“If you give me 100 youths, I will change
this nation” said swami Vivekananda.

1868
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:27,991
Do you know, our country accounts
for maximum number of youths?

1869
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,533
But still we haven’t been
able to bring about any change.

1870
01:41:29,534 --> 01:41:30,075
Why???

1871
01:41:30,492 --> 01:41:34,575
The reason is it is easy to preach virtues,
but it is difficult to practice.

1872
01:41:35,992 --> 01:41:38,242
Very one craves for change…

1873
01:41:39,075 --> 01:41:43,909
but change is possible, if only each
one of us change… each one us change.

1874
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:50,742
To me your safety is as
important as this ground.

1875
01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:55,242
Please go … go back to your places.

1876
01:41:55,867 --> 01:41:56,867
Please… go back.

1877
01:41:58,242 --> 01:41:59,242
Please… go.

1878
01:42:13,278 --> 01:42:15,694
Sir, Sir. The entire media is here.
It might turn out to be a problem later on.

1879
01:42:15,695 --> 01:42:16,695
I'll manage them.

1880
01:42:18,486 --> 01:42:21,194
Sir…Sir…Sir…
- Sir, please clarify our doubts.

1881
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:22,829
I will answer all your questions.

1882
01:42:22,953 --> 01:42:24,910
I have arranged breakfast for all of you.

1883
01:42:24,911 --> 01:42:27,745
I will answer all your
questions after having breakfast.

1884
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,786
Why the mess?

1885
01:42:28,787 --> 01:42:29,952
Lower the mike...

1886
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:30,578
Lower the mike.

1887
01:42:30,578 --> 01:42:31,536
Lower the mike, please.

1888
01:42:31,536 --> 01:42:32,328
Lower it. Come on!

1889
01:42:32,329 --> 01:42:35,870
Stop filming! Stop filming!

1890
01:42:36,078 --> 01:42:37,785
We shall talk after we have our breakfast.

1891
01:42:37,786 --> 01:42:38,953
Go on, leave.

1892
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:39,786
You come.

1893
01:42:39,786 --> 01:42:40,578
What's wrong with him?

1894
01:42:40,745 --> 01:42:42,078
I didn't understand.

1895
01:42:43,745 --> 01:42:45,245
Check if they have stopped filming.

1896
01:42:45,786 --> 01:42:47,620
Don't know what he will answer.

1897
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:48,821
All of them are switched off.

1898
01:42:49,536 --> 01:42:50,911
Are you sure?
- For sure.

1899
01:42:52,911 --> 01:42:54,453
Hey! What’s your problem?

1900
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,078
What do you guys want?

1901
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,953
Like a gangster holding a gun...

1902
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:00,120
Does everyone who holds
a cameraphone become press?

1903
01:43:00,161 --> 01:43:01,519
You guys shoot a video
that claims that ‘A disastrous

1904
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,952
fire struck the village and
there is no one to save it’.

1905
01:43:02,953 --> 01:43:04,471
Everyone who watches the video
starts creating a ruckus.

1906
01:43:04,495 --> 01:43:07,120
You then force people to like
and subscribe to your content.

1907
01:43:07,161 --> 01:43:08,471
What do you think
happens because of all this?

1908
01:43:08,495 --> 01:43:09,745
Absolutely nothing!

1909
01:43:10,036 --> 01:43:11,256
Once some new
trouble comes to the fore,

1910
01:43:11,257 --> 01:43:12,596
All the incidents of
the past are forgotten.

1911
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,995
Do you know when people were happy?

1912
01:43:15,453 --> 01:43:18,744
Remember those days when Doordarshan
had news telecasted for 25 minutes?

1913
01:43:18,745 --> 01:43:21,869
People really paid attention to the news
then and felt something about the issues.

1914
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:26,619
But now, all 24 channels telecast ‘breaking
news’ all through 24 hours of day.

1915
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:27,827
What do you think happens because of that?

1916
01:43:27,828 --> 01:43:31,328
People just don’t feel anything and
they don’t care about any struggle.

1917
01:43:31,953 --> 01:43:34,078
Do you see any national
TV channels here today?

1918
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:36,054
All of you are local channels, right?

1919
01:43:36,078 --> 01:43:38,994
You guys place your ads on the top
and on the bottom of the screen.

1920
01:43:38,995 --> 01:43:40,333
Do you think people
understand the politics

1921
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:41,762
you keep telecasting in
that place in between?

1922
01:43:41,786 --> 01:43:43,546
Why do you even bother
telecasting politics?

1923
01:43:43,786 --> 01:43:45,708
Why don’t you stick to
telecasting songs, movies and

1924
01:43:45,709 --> 01:43:47,702
bits of comedies on your
channels instead of politics?

1925
01:43:47,703 --> 01:43:51,828
If you telecast news about hockey ground
and hospitals...

1926
01:43:52,245 --> 01:43:54,495
I will get your licenses cancelled!

1927
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:55,328
Get out of here!

1928
01:43:55,453 --> 01:43:56,120
Leave!

1929
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:58,369
Sir, Sir…I’ll take care
of it. I’ll take care of it.

1930
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,078
Go on, then. Go on...

1931
01:44:00,328 --> 01:44:01,328
Send them away!

1932
01:44:10,495 --> 01:44:13,786
That ground is not
just for playing Hockey.

1933
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:18,120
You guys grew up playing in that ground.

1934
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:20,703
That is our Identity.

1935
01:44:22,703 --> 01:44:27,911
You guys are known to go to extreme
lengths for your friends.

1936
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:31,353
Isn’t this grandfather like your friend?

1937
01:44:32,395 --> 01:44:36,895
Could you not give up on
that ground for your grandpa?

1938
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:41,895
Promise me that you
will not stop fighting for it.

1939
01:44:42,895 --> 01:44:44,561
Promise me.

1940
01:44:52,186 --> 01:44:54,228
…Promise me.

1941
01:44:55,395 --> 01:44:58,603
Why are you being this way?
We are saddened looking at you.

1942
01:44:58,728 --> 01:45:00,684
Didn’t lawyer tell us
that winning the match

1943
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,727
would guarantee the
protection of this ground?

1944
01:45:02,728 --> 01:45:05,810
Sir, we have complete faith in you.

1945
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:08,477
We will definitely win this tournament.

1946
01:45:08,478 --> 01:45:10,770
That lawyer was in jail
because he supported us

1947
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:12,853
This isn’t a simple tournament.

1948
01:45:13,061 --> 01:45:14,520
It’s a national level tournament.

1949
01:45:14,853 --> 01:45:16,537
It’s going to have hundreds
of rules and regulations.

1950
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:17,645
This is our ground.

1951
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,519
We shouldn’t ever let it go.

1952
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:26,435
We shouldn’t ever lose it.
(All together)

1953
01:45:26,436 --> 01:45:27,436
One minute... please.

1954
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,186
Well, this is not a small issue...

1955
01:45:29,603 --> 01:45:30,436
One minute...

1956
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,186
Hello.. Tell me

1957
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:33,497
In the midst of all these
protests, you’ve managed

1958
01:45:33,498 --> 01:45:35,358
to register your team
for the tournament, huh?

1959
01:45:36,686 --> 01:45:37,895
Registration?

1960
01:45:37,936 --> 01:45:40,228
Don’t play innocent with me!

1961
01:45:42,145 --> 01:45:43,352
What are you talking about?

1962
01:45:43,353 --> 01:45:44,061
Are you joking?

1963
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:45,061
Sir!

1964
01:45:45,145 --> 01:45:46,270
Murali, sir!
- Murali, sir!

1965
01:45:46,395 --> 01:45:47,811
Murali, sir!

1966
01:45:47,853 --> 01:45:49,728
Sir... Murali, sir!

1967

Our application has been submitted.

1968
01:45:51,936 --> 01:45:53,727
If you could give it a look over...

1969
01:45:53,728 --> 01:45:56,561
our match on the 28th of this month...
We are going to win it!

1970
01:45:57,936 --> 01:45:59,728
Khayyum, what is this?

1971
01:46:00,436 --> 01:46:04,603
If we want to play,
We need to have national level player.

1972
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,685
National level?

1973
01:46:06,686 --> 01:46:08,561
We have an international level player.

1974
01:46:09,311 --> 01:46:10,311

They have blackmailed three of our players
and made sure that they don’t play.

1983
01:48:00,053 --> 01:48:02,928

Okay.

1999
01:48:40,303 --> 01:48:42,510
We have four national players with us, sir.

2000
01:48:42,511 --> 01:48:45,719
If we join them in our team,
we will definitely win.

2001
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,594
There are eight national players in total.

2002
01:48:47,595 --> 01:48:49,928
Four of them are from Punjab.
Two from the west zone.

2003
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:52,636
This is a mini-India team
that’s going to be playing for us.

2004
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:56,279
In that team, there are two
national players from Haryana...

2005
01:48:56,303 --> 01:48:58,595
three from Punjab and two from West Zone.

2006
01:48:59,011 --> 01:49:01,011
And all of them are outstanding players.

2007
01:49:01,428 --> 01:49:05,220
But the thing they lack and
we possess is Chemistry.

2008
01:49:05,845 --> 01:49:07,386
To them, this is just another match.

2009
01:49:08,095 --> 01:49:10,345
But our lives are tied to
the outcome of the match.

2010
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,470
So, boys...

2011
01:49:12,803 --> 01:49:14,095
Who are going to win today?

2012
01:49:15,053 --> 01:49:17,053
Who is going to win this match?

2013
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:33,135
Dhyanchand Tournament
is going to start soon.

2014
01:49:33,136 --> 01:49:36,469
Me, your Suma, is going to be
the one covering this match for you.

2015
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:38,885
And your Viva Harsha... we are ready.

2016
01:49:38,886 --> 01:49:41,595
You must be wondering what’s the
big deal about this Hockey match.

2017
01:49:41,636 --> 01:49:42,885
There is a reason...

2018
01:49:42,886 --> 01:49:46,594
an entire village’s self-respect and honor
are tied to the outcome of this match.

2019
01:49:46,595 --> 01:49:48,885
If Team P. Chittibabu
Club loses this match,

2020
01:49:48,886 --> 01:49:51,083
they will not be able to move
out of the underperforming

2021
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:53,279
category and they would
lose their claim to this ground.

2022
01:49:53,303 --> 01:49:55,886
That is why they have no other choice
but to win this match.

2023
01:49:56,303 --> 01:49:58,637
We have a sports minister
who is well-versed in the

2024
01:49:58,638 --> 01:50:00,927
field of hockey who will
grace the match as a VIP.

2025
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:03,398
Is it? Does he have that much knowledge?
Let's see...

2026
01:50:09,545 --> 01:50:10,961
Grandpa... watch the match.

2027
01:50:19,836 --> 01:50:22,202
Today, we have a lot of players
from different states and top

2028
01:50:22,203 --> 01:50:24,835
players from all over India, who
have come to play for Team Francis.

2029
01:50:24,836 --> 01:50:25,545
Right Harsha...!

2030
01:50:25,546 --> 01:50:28,854
On one hand, we have a lot of young players
with raw talent in Team Chittibabu club.

2031
01:50:28,878 --> 01:50:32,003
The entire team is dependent
on their Captain, Sundeep Naidu.

2032
01:50:32,128 --> 01:50:35,836
Sundeep Naidu has played for India A
under 21 division as captain.

2033
01:50:37,086 --> 01:50:39,460
And it’s time for toss now.

2034
01:50:39,461 --> 01:50:41,127
Harsha... let's see who will win.

2035
01:50:41,128 --> 01:50:42,835
The referee has flipped the coin.

2036
01:50:42,836 --> 01:50:45,170
It looks like Sundeep has won the toss.

2037
01:50:50,961 --> 01:50:55,086
Looks like the players are warming up
and getting ready for the match.

2038
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,377
The match has commenced now
with the referee’s whistle.

2039
01:51:19,378 --> 01:51:23,335
Chittibabu club’s Vice-captain, Asif has
given the opening pass directly to Sundeep.

2040
01:51:23,336 --> 01:51:26,086
Sundeep has taken the ball and
gave it back with a negative pass.

2041
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:31,169
The players of Chittibabu’s team
are still in their half of the ground.

2042
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:33,410
They haven’t crossed the half way line
and come forward.

2043
01:51:35,586 --> 01:51:36,378
Come on... Come on...

2044
01:51:36,461 --> 01:51:39,919
Is Chittibabu’s team
playing hockey or Kabaddi?

2045
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:42,585
They have continuously been giving
each other negative passes.

2046
01:51:42,586 --> 01:51:43,128
Raghu...

2047
01:51:43,211 --> 01:51:44,211
Sir...

2048
01:51:44,378 --> 01:51:45,898
Look at the players of the other team.

2049
01:51:46,211 --> 01:51:48,878
Look how they are playing with harmony.

2050
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:52,253
Why is it that our players are
not in tune with one another?

2051
01:51:53,045 --> 01:51:54,295
Nothing of that sort, sir.

2052
01:51:54,461 --> 01:51:57,187
The other team’s players are too close
to one another and are making mistakes.

2053
01:51:57,211 --> 01:51:58,437
Our players are correct
in their strategy and game.

2054
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:00,419
Chttibabu club's negative passing game...

2055
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,377
has been broken by Francis
club’s Number 32 player.

2056
01:52:02,378 --> 01:52:04,461
The ball is currently in
Francis club’s possession.

2057
01:52:07,586 --> 01:52:10,460
We can see a lot of maturity in the
way Francis Club passes the ball.

2058
01:52:10,461 --> 01:52:13,821
Chittibabu’s team doesn’t seem to be able
to match the intensity of their opponents.

2059
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:18,045
Hey! Super.

2060
01:52:18,046 --> 01:52:19,700
Francis club team members
have passed around the

2061
01:52:19,701 --> 01:52:21,354
ball brilliantly and are
now in the attack mode.

2062
01:52:21,378 --> 01:52:24,502
Francis club players have come almost
close to D line of Chittibabu’s side.

2063
01:52:24,503 --> 01:52:27,463
Chittibabu Club players are unable
to snatch the ball from their opponents.

2064
01:52:31,795 --> 01:52:34,753
Sundeep is instructing his teammates
to be in their respective positions.

2065
01:52:35,003 --> 01:52:37,710
But, Asif has gone towards Francis club
players side from his position…

2066
01:52:37,711 --> 01:52:39,295
…and it’s a goal!

2067
01:52:41,336 --> 01:52:43,496
Chittibabu club’s strategy
hasn’t worked out for them.

2068
01:52:43,545 --> 01:52:46,253
Francis club has used
their experience to break the

2069
01:52:46,254 --> 01:52:48,960
defenses of Chittibabu
club and have an early lead.

2070
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:51,253
It must be said that, this
is a well-deserved goal.

2071
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:52,586
Good job boys.

2072
01:53:01,211 --> 01:53:02,878
Come on, come on boys!
Come on!

2073
01:53:03,378 --> 01:53:04,670
Okay boys... it's oaky.

2074
01:53:04,961 --> 01:53:06,771
Get back into the game.
Get back into the game.

2075
01:53:06,795 --> 01:53:09,503
Chittibabu Club’s score is zero
and Francis club’s score is one.

2076
01:53:11,003 --> 01:53:12,252
The game has started off one again.

2077
01:53:12,253 --> 01:53:14,002
Francis club are moving
forward with the ball...

2078
01:53:14,003 --> 01:53:16,002
Let’s see how Chittibabu’s
club players respond.

2079
01:53:16,003 --> 01:53:17,483
Now the ball is with Chittibabu club.

2080
01:53:18,895 --> 01:53:20,561
Spread... spread.. Spread out!

2081
01:53:23,186 --> 01:53:26,020
As expected, they have
passed the ball to Sundeep.

2082
01:53:26,145 --> 01:53:29,225
Sundeep has brilliantly dribbled the ball
from left side and is going forward.

2083
01:53:30,653 --> 01:53:33,171
Sundeep has scooped the ball from
the left to Asif who is in the right wing.

2084
01:53:33,195 --> 01:53:36,028
Asif has received the ball
and is charging forward.

2085
01:53:36,611 --> 01:53:39,070
Sundeep is waiting to receive the ball.

2086
01:53:41,395 --> 01:53:43,020
Asif passed the ball to the center.

2087
01:53:45,236 --> 01:53:46,570
Ball is now with Sundeep…

2088
01:53:48,286 --> 01:53:49,286
Shot!

2089
01:53:50,087 --> 01:53:53,036
And wow! It's a goal!

2090
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,120
Yes! Yes!

2091
01:53:59,120 --> 01:53:59,786
Grandpa...

2092
01:53:59,787 --> 01:54:01,286
No.. No... you take rest.

2093
01:54:03,786 --> 01:54:04,786
Damn!

2094
01:54:22,203 --> 01:54:23,870
All the officials are on our side.

2095
01:54:24,245 --> 01:54:25,245
Play aggressively!

2096
01:54:25,286 --> 01:54:25,911
Agressive...

2097
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:26,578
Come on.. Come on...

2098
01:54:26,579 --> 01:54:28,078
Go... go...
Move... move...

2099
01:54:28,953 --> 01:54:31,450
Just because they have
lost a goal, Francis club’s

2100
01:54:31,451 --> 01:54:33,703
coach has called the
entire team for counsel.

2101
01:54:33,786 --> 01:54:35,328
Francis club very strong team.

2102
01:54:35,495 --> 01:54:37,786
We can expect an aggressive
response from this team.

2103
01:54:38,036 --> 01:54:39,995
Sundeep is charging forward with the ball.

2104
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:47,244
Chittibabu’s players are
appealing for stick lock foul.

2105
01:54:47,245 --> 01:54:48,535
But the referee isn’t reacting at all.

2106
01:54:48,536 --> 01:54:50,370
That's a foul.
- That's a foul.

2107
01:54:52,161 --> 01:54:53,619
There is an expression
that Young Telugu

2108
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,327
people use in this
situation, “Are you blind?!”

2109
01:54:55,328 --> 01:54:56,911
But the referee’s decision is final.

2110
01:54:58,828 --> 01:55:00,910
Sundeep is going to take a free hit now.

2111
01:55:00,911 --> 01:55:03,078
Free hit isn’t something
that comes after a ‘no ball’.

2112
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,995
It bears no relation to that.
- Push him.

2113
01:55:05,161 --> 01:55:07,828
Francis club is marking
vice captain Asif very tightly.

2114
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:08,703
Oh!

2115
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:09,953
What is this?

2116
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:14,910
There is a chance that Kuldeep might get
a red card and go out of the game.

2117
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:15,286
Hey!

2118
01:55:15,287 --> 01:55:19,036
Asif holds the Kuldeep's collar. It looks
like Asif and Kuldeep are going to fight.

2119
01:55:25,745 --> 01:55:28,453
Very puzzling to see that Asif has
been shown the green card.

2120
01:55:28,786 --> 01:55:29,786
Hey, Raghu...

2121
01:55:30,286 --> 01:55:31,660
You said all referees are on our side.

2122
01:55:31,661 --> 01:55:34,137
But why is he appreciating the opposite
player by showing him a green card?

2123
01:55:34,161 --> 01:55:37,179
Sir, actually it's a foul by our player.
Referee supposed to punish our players.

2124
01:55:37,203 --> 01:55:38,577
But referee is our side...

2125
01:55:38,578 --> 01:55:40,596
So he is showing the green
card to the opposite team.

2126
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:43,620
Now the player should
follow his punishment.

2127
01:55:43,953 --> 01:55:45,745
He is one side referee.

2128
01:55:46,328 --> 01:55:48,120
He is one side referee.

2129
01:55:48,203 --> 01:55:49,953
This is a very strange decision.

2130
01:55:50,078 --> 01:55:51,078
Sundeep!

2131
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,120
Sundeep!

2132
01:56:08,495 --> 01:56:11,536
The free hit for Francis club is going
to be taken by Captain Kuldeep.

2133
01:56:12,953 --> 01:56:16,702
Chittibabu club’s team is tightly marking
the players of Francis team.

2134
01:56:16,703 --> 01:56:18,244
It’s a good turn and a forward pass…

2135
01:56:18,245 --> 01:56:19,286
Flick and it’s a goal!

2136
01:56:24,578 --> 01:56:25,578
Focus!

2137
01:57:09,953 --> 01:57:10,953
Sundeep!

2138
01:57:12,786 --> 01:57:13,786
Stay calm.

2139
01:57:20,953 --> 01:57:23,586
To undermine the confidence
of Captain Sundeep, players

2140
01:57:23,587 --> 01:57:26,078
of Francis club continue
to celebrate targeting him.

2141
01:57:26,203 --> 01:57:28,323
Let’s find out how Sundeep
is going to react to this.

2142
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:31,370
Chittibabu club One;
Francis club Two.

2143
01:57:31,786 --> 01:57:34,619
Asif has kicked off the game
and gave the pass to Sundeep.

2144
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,452
Oh! Sundeep was unable to receive the ball.

2145
01:57:37,453 --> 01:57:40,828
It looks like Sundeep's
focus is getting distracted.

2146
01:57:41,161 --> 01:57:43,035
Did you see? I have
made our players play a

2147
01:57:43,036 --> 01:57:44,994
mind game on him and
break his concentration.

2148
01:57:44,995 --> 01:57:46,035
Wow! Superb, sir!

2149
01:57:46,036 --> 01:57:47,429
Put your hand in! Put your hand in!

2150
01:57:47,453 --> 01:57:48,613
We are surrounded by cameras.

2151
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:50,411
Pretend to be sad.

2152
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:00,370
Sundeep!

2153
01:58:02,745 --> 01:58:03,745
Come here.

2154
01:58:21,536 --> 01:58:23,336
What happened, Sundeep?
What's wrong with you?

2155
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,370
What is this?

2156
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,245
What happened to your game?

2157
01:58:41,161 --> 01:58:42,161
Raghu...

2158
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,078
Looks like M.S. Dhoni is walking out.

2159
01:58:44,536 --> 01:58:47,036
Sir, M.S. Dhoni is a cricketer.

2160
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,620
Of course, I know that!

2161
01:58:50,245 --> 01:58:54,995
Chittibabu Team’s captain and star player
Sundeep has unexpectedly left the pitch.

2162
01:58:55,161 --> 01:58:56,785
Yes! This is very strange.

2163
01:58:56,786 --> 01:58:58,471
We are not able to understand
why Sundeep has left.

2164
01:58:58,495 --> 01:59:00,370
Let's wait and see what is going to happen.

2165
01:59:00,453 --> 01:59:02,313
It can be said that it
would be very difficult

2166
01:59:02,314 --> 01:59:04,173
for Chittibabu’s team to
give a good comeback.

2167
01:59:10,161 --> 01:59:13,077
Shot and it's another
goal for Francis club!

2168
01:59:13,078 --> 01:59:15,327
This is what salting
one’s wounds would mean.

2169
01:59:15,328 --> 01:59:18,745
Chittibabu’s club has been at the
receiving end of the onslaught.

2170
01:59:19,328 --> 01:59:22,453
Chittibabu club one;
Francis club three.

2171
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:30,591
Unless there is a
miracle, it is very difficult

2172
01:59:30,592 --> 01:59:33,369
for Chittibabu’s team to
get back into the game.

2173
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:34,495
It's half time.

2174
01:59:34,661 --> 01:59:35,827
45 minutes done!

2175
01:59:35,828 --> 01:59:36,995
45 minutes to go!

2176
01:59:40,745 --> 01:59:41,745
Sanju!

2177
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,120
What happened?

2178
01:59:45,411 --> 01:59:47,786
Everyone is waiting for you.

2179
01:59:48,578 --> 01:59:49,578
Let's go.

2180
01:59:50,328 --> 01:59:51,328
LET'S GO!

2181
02:00:05,218 --> 02:00:06,426
Their captain left his team.

2182
02:00:07,134 --> 02:00:09,301
Without him, his team is weak.

2183
02:00:09,426 --> 02:00:10,551
You and Asif attack;

2184
02:00:11,301 --> 02:00:13,021
Both be around the D-line, okay?
- Yes, sir.

2185
02:00:22,384 --> 02:00:23,551
Well…Sundeep left.

2186
02:00:27,884 --> 02:00:28,884
Boys, remember that...

2187
02:00:29,843 --> 02:00:31,384
the team is bigger than any player...

2188
02:00:31,509 --> 02:00:33,009
always…I mean always!
Remember that.

2189
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:35,390
It’s okay.

2190
02:00:36,301 --> 02:00:38,925
Every player in our team
is extraordinary. Right?

2191
02:00:38,926 --> 02:00:40,166
All of us are national players.

2192
02:00:40,384 --> 02:00:42,472
It’s true that there are
outstanding players in the

2193
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,584
opposite team but our team
has understanding players.

2194
02:00:44,968 --> 02:00:46,069
You have friends among your team.

2195
02:00:46,093 --> 02:00:47,884
They…They mustn’t win!

2196
02:00:48,259 --> 02:00:50,860
Let’s make sure that the very thought
of Francis Club scares their pants off!

2197
02:00:50,884 --> 02:00:53,194
Do you remember the fight the other day?
Or have you guys forgotten?

2198
02:00:53,218 --> 02:00:53,801
So, you forgot about it?

2199
02:00:53,884 --> 02:00:54,718
No, sir. We remember. We remember.

2200
02:00:54,718 --> 02:00:55,593
So, you remember. Good!

2201
02:00:55,676 --> 02:00:57,276
Do you remember how angry everyone was?!

2202
02:00:57,759 --> 02:00:58,759
Isn’t that true?

2203
02:00:59,718 --> 02:01:02,218
The place to show your anger is here;
Right in this field.

2204
02:01:04,884 --> 02:01:06,009
Two goals, boys…

2205
02:01:06,801 --> 02:01:08,009
Just two goals.

2206
02:01:09,051 --> 02:01:12,051
First, we go for the equalizer
and then we go for the winning goal.

2207
02:01:12,718 --> 02:01:14,551
Make sure there are no penalties, okay?

2208
02:01:16,051 --> 02:01:17,258
Can we do this much?
- Yes, sir.

2209
02:01:17,259 --> 02:01:17,759
Yes, sir.

2210
02:01:18,093 --> 02:01:19,217
Can we do this much?

2211
02:01:19,218 --> 02:01:20,051
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

2212
02:01:20,051 --> 02:01:21,051
Can we do this much?

2213
02:01:21,468 --> 02:01:22,301
Can we do this much?

2214
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:23,093
Yes, sir!
[Together]

2215
02:01:23,093 --> 02:01:24,093
Can we do it?

2216
02:01:24,301 --> 02:01:25,301
Can we do it?

2217
02:01:25,509 --> 02:01:25,968
Yes, sir!
[Together loudly]

2218
02:01:25,968 --> 02:01:26,468
Louder!

2219
02:01:26,468 --> 02:01:27,343
Yes, sir!
[Together loudly]

2220
02:01:27,343 --> 02:01:27,843
Louder!

2221
02:01:27,843 --> 02:01:28,593
Yes, sir!
[Together loudly]

2222
02:01:28,594 --> 02:01:30,176
Go! Go! Go!
- Come on, boys.

2223
02:01:30,843 --> 02:01:32,051
Come on, boys!
Come on!

2224
02:01:32,134 --> 02:01:32,593
Move!

2225
02:01:32,968 --> 02:01:33,426
Move!

2226
02:01:33,968 --> 02:01:35,259
Second half has begun.

2227
02:01:35,301 --> 02:01:38,043
During the halftime, both
coaches have motivated their

2228
02:01:38,067 --> 02:01:40,758
teams just like Rajiv
Kanakala in that movie ‘Sye.’

2229
02:01:40,759 --> 02:01:44,801
Both the teams have come back to the pitch
highly motivated and have started the game.

2230
02:01:45,218 --> 02:01:47,550
This is a positive start
from Chittibabu’s club

2231
02:01:47,551 --> 02:01:49,383
They are attacking with very good passes.

2232
02:01:49,384 --> 02:01:51,175
But… with a good interception...

2233
02:01:51,176 --> 02:01:53,300
Chittibabu club players
attack has been broken.

2234
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:56,341
Now Francis club players will not let
Chttibabu's players come near the ball.

2235
02:02:14,176 --> 02:02:16,509
Why have you left the game and come..?

2236
02:02:16,759 --> 02:02:19,008
Did I come to you after
five years to witness this?

2237
02:02:19,009 --> 02:02:21,676
If Darshi was here, do you know
how ashamed he would have been?

2238
02:02:22,218 --> 02:02:23,938
Will your team win the match without you..?

2239
02:02:24,134 --> 02:02:26,509
If idiots like those win
once, that would be enough.

2240
02:02:27,134 --> 02:02:29,218
But people like us need to win every time.

2241
02:02:32,884 --> 02:02:34,604
Enough with this self-pity!
Come on, get up!

2242
02:02:37,926 --> 02:02:39,343
Our team is losing there!

2243
02:02:41,218 --> 02:02:43,499
I got your stupid face a gift!
Wear it and get on with it!

2244
02:03:06,718 --> 02:03:09,425
Francis team is dominating the game.

2245
02:03:09,426 --> 02:03:10,952
Chittibabu club’s
players are trying really

2246
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,758
hard to get the ball from
their opponents but...

2247
02:03:12,759 --> 02:03:14,217
so far, it’s been hopeless.

2248
02:03:14,218 --> 02:03:17,384
We can see the vacuum created by
the absence of Captain Sundeep.

2249
02:03:17,718 --> 02:03:19,676
Yes, you are right.

2250
02:03:19,926 --> 02:03:24,301
But it look impossible for Chittibabu club
to win even if Sundeep comes back.

2251
02:03:24,509 --> 02:03:26,968
Because they need to score
two goals to win this game.

2252
02:03:27,134 --> 02:03:28,676
But they have only 20 minutes.

2253
02:03:40,259 --> 02:03:43,425
Everyone here is very confused about
what is going on in the stadium.

2254
02:03:43,426 --> 02:03:46,066
The entire crowd in the stadium
has started chanting ‘A1 express’.

2255
02:04:33,009 --> 02:04:34,634
Meet my A1 Express, Sir.

2256
02:04:39,468 --> 02:04:44,384
Sundeep has given a cinematic entry.

2257
02:04:54,843 --> 02:04:57,342
Asif has returned the
captain’s band to Sundeep.

2258
02:04:57,343 --> 02:05:01,634
I am as excited as the
crowd in the stadium.

2259
02:05:01,759 --> 02:05:03,717
There are only twenty minutes left.

2260
02:05:03,718 --> 02:05:06,134
Chittibabu club is completely
dependent on Sundeep.

2261
02:05:34,926 --> 02:05:37,050
Grandpa, didn’t I tell you that the
victory is going to be ours!

2262
02:05:37,051 --> 02:05:39,008
Fool!
You just said it!

2263
02:05:39,009 --> 02:05:40,593
But I said it a long while back.

2264
02:05:40,676 --> 02:05:43,328
If anyone is in doubt
as to what Sundeep is

2265
02:05:43,352 --> 02:05:46,384
called A1 express, It
must be clarified by now.

2266
02:05:46,593 --> 02:05:49,509
A goal after a long time
for Chittibabu’s team.

2267
02:05:50,884 --> 02:05:54,508
Sundeep is returning Kuldeep’s
moves during his first goal.

2268
02:05:54,509 --> 02:05:56,801
They say Karma is a boomerang goal!

2269
02:05:56,968 --> 02:05:59,926
Chittibabu club is inching closer
towards Francis club’s score.

2270
02:06:00,093 --> 02:06:02,551
Chittibabu club Two;
Francis club Three.

2271
02:06:03,343 --> 02:06:05,051
Momentum is with Chittibabu club now.

2272
02:06:05,176 --> 02:06:06,588
Francis club have to
make sure that they

2273
02:06:06,612 --> 02:06:08,576
don’t give a single
goal to their opponents.

2274
02:06:08,801 --> 02:06:12,093
If not, there is a chance that they
might lose control over the game.

2275
02:06:12,843 --> 02:06:14,342
Attack seems to be their best defence.

2276
02:06:14,343 --> 02:06:16,342
So Francis club players are charging
ahead towards the goal…

2277
02:06:16,343 --> 02:06:17,343
OUCH!

2278
02:06:18,676 --> 02:06:20,996
When the goalkeeper tried to stop the ball,
he was injured.

2279
02:06:21,218 --> 02:06:24,468
We don’t know if Chittibabu’s team has
a substitute goalkeeper or not.

2280
02:06:26,426 --> 02:06:31,384
Looks like the goal keeper needs to be
substituted because of the serious injury.

2281
02:06:33,509 --> 02:06:34,509
Vitta, come here.

2282
02:06:35,009 --> 02:06:37,319
They aren’t allowing a privileged goal
keeper. Go and wear you helmet and come.

2283
02:06:37,343 --> 02:06:39,593
Bro, Count me out.
There are other players, right?

2284
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:42,239
Vitta, it’s vital that the other players
remain on the ground.

2285
02:06:42,426 --> 02:06:43,259
Go on, hurry. Wear it and come.

2286
02:06:43,343 --> 02:06:44,925
Bro, never mind that. I
don’t know what to do.

2287
02:06:44,926 --> 02:06:47,259
We are all here. Be brave and proceed.

2288
02:06:48,009 --> 02:06:48,676
Go!

2289
02:06:48,884 --> 02:06:50,004
Looks like I can’t avoid it.

2290
02:06:50,801 --> 02:06:53,800
Coach! Coach! Please, I don’t know a thing.
Count me out and give it someone else.

2291
02:06:53,801 --> 02:06:55,121
Please try and understand, Coach.

2292
02:06:56,509 --> 02:06:57,884
Coach, please.

2293
02:06:58,051 --> 02:06:59,133
I don’t think I can do it.
- Stick.

2294
02:06:59,134 --> 02:07:00,343
I am really scared.

2295
02:07:00,468 --> 02:07:02,301
Coach, please. Please, try and understand.

2296
02:07:02,926 --> 02:07:03,926
Come on.

2297
02:07:04,009 --> 02:07:05,110
Come on... Come on... Come on.

2298
02:07:05,134 --> 02:07:08,051
For a normal player to be turned
into a privileged goal keeper...

2299
02:07:08,176 --> 02:07:10,508
He mustn’t have any
padding or guards on him.

2300
02:07:10,509 --> 02:07:11,883
He must only wear his helmet.

2301
02:07:11,884 --> 02:07:12,634
That is the rule.

2302
02:07:12,759 --> 02:07:13,884
Boys, ready?

2303
02:07:14,509 --> 02:07:15,551
We have to take care.

2304
02:07:15,843 --> 02:07:16,551
We are leading.

2305
02:07:16,552 --> 02:07:17,759
Keep your spirits up!

2306
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:23,093
Wear it properly.
- I am scared, bro.

2307
02:07:23,384 --> 02:07:23,884
Okay now?

2308
02:07:24,176 --> 02:07:25,277
You wore the guard to protect
yourself down there, right?

2309
02:07:25,301 --> 02:07:27,926
No, bro. They didn’t give me a guard.
They only gave me a helmet.

2310
02:07:28,718 --> 02:07:30,050
Well, skip that. It’s okay.

2311
02:07:30,051 --> 02:07:30,468
Get ready.

2312
02:07:30,468 --> 02:07:31,218
Bro! Bro! Bro!

2313
02:07:31,219 --> 02:07:33,259
If you give me two minutes,
I will wear and return.

2314
02:07:34,134 --> 02:07:36,777
If I make a mess of things,
the entire village will beat me to pulp.

2315
02:07:36,801 --> 02:07:38,176
There isn’t a goal keeper either!

2316
02:07:38,259 --> 02:07:39,925
The entire team must get
together and attack them!

2317
02:07:39,926 --> 02:07:41,176
Attack!
Come on!

2318
02:07:43,009 --> 02:07:44,925
Oh God!
Don't let the ball come near me.

2319
02:07:44,926 --> 02:07:47,030
Chittibabu’s club doesn’t
have a substitute goal

2320
02:07:47,054 --> 02:07:49,384
keeper Hence, they appointed
Mahesh as goal keeper.

2321
02:07:50,134 --> 02:07:52,343
According to the rule,
he hasn't put on any padding.

2322
02:07:52,718 --> 02:07:55,342
It is difficult to stop the ball with
no padding on but…

2323
02:07:55,343 --> 02:07:57,634
…Wow!
What a brilliant save!

2324
02:08:00,009 --> 02:08:01,343
He's my Grandson!

2325
02:08:01,593 --> 02:08:02,676
My Grandson!

2326
02:08:06,593 --> 02:08:08,718
One more shot and save again!

2327
02:08:09,009 --> 02:08:12,093
Mahesh is doing this
with just his hockey stick.

2328
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:14,636
Just like I did, he
made sure of not giving

2329
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:16,759
them even a single
opportunity to score a goal.

2330
02:08:16,926 --> 02:08:18,051
He is a tiger!

2331
02:08:18,218 --> 02:08:21,842
Not just once but twice.
He has saved his team twice.

2332
02:08:21,843 --> 02:08:25,926
They say "Fortune favours the brave" Mahesh
has saved two goals despite being shaky.

2333
02:08:26,009 --> 02:08:28,009
The score is now Two – Three.

2334
02:08:28,301 --> 02:08:32,968
To ensure that Chittibabu’s club doesn’t
lose, they have to score another goal.

2335
02:08:33,384 --> 02:08:34,551
Go right... go right.

2336
02:08:35,884 --> 02:08:38,331
Chittibabu’s players have
used long passes to bypasses

2337
02:08:38,355 --> 02:08:40,801
Francis players to move
the ball towards their goal.

2338
02:08:42,718 --> 02:08:44,925
From the deep right, they
moved into the circle to low cross…

2339
02:08:44,926 --> 02:08:46,801
Sundeep has flicked it towards Asif.

2340
02:08:46,884 --> 02:08:49,218
Asif has pushed the ball
towards the goal while diving.

2341
02:08:49,968 --> 02:08:51,509
Wow! It’s a goal!

2342
02:08:51,718 --> 02:08:52,259
Damn!

2343
02:08:52,384 --> 02:08:53,759
I'll take a leave, Sir.
- Sit down!

2344
02:08:54,009 --> 02:08:57,134
What a team! What a spirit!

2345
02:08:57,259 --> 02:09:00,310
Chittibabu’s team hasn’t
given up and fought to

2346
02:09:00,334 --> 02:09:03,384
almost snatch the match
from Francis club’s team.

2347
02:09:03,593 --> 02:09:06,033
From a two-goal lead, Chittibabu’s
team has equaled the score.

2348
02:09:06,426 --> 02:09:10,468
Chittibabu club Three; Francis club Three.

2349
02:09:11,968 --> 02:09:13,590
Because the ball has
gone out of play due to

2350
02:09:13,614 --> 02:09:15,235
Francis club, Chittibabu
club has a free hit.

2351
02:09:15,259 --> 02:09:16,884
Guys, this is the last chance.

2352
02:09:17,301 --> 02:09:20,301
Even if it is a foul...
don't worry about it.

2353
02:09:20,759 --> 02:09:22,343
You have to win.

2354
02:09:22,634 --> 02:09:23,968
You must win the game.
Understand!

2355
02:09:24,009 --> 02:09:27,122
Chittibabu’s team will now
make sure they score the

2356
02:09:27,146 --> 02:09:30,259
fourth goal at any cost
without taking any penalties.

2357
02:09:30,509 --> 02:09:33,393
Chittibabu’s team has
started to dominate the game

2358
02:09:33,417 --> 02:09:36,301
which was up until now
in favor of Francis club.

2359
02:09:37,718 --> 02:09:39,593
Asif has given a long scoop...

2360
02:09:39,801 --> 02:09:42,718
Sundeep is running into
the D line to receive that.

2361
02:09:42,801 --> 02:09:47,676
Francis club need to work hard to stop
the goal if Sundeep was received the ball.

2362
02:09:49,384 --> 02:09:50,967
Sundeep is about to receive the ball.

2363
02:09:50,968 --> 02:09:53,675
But Francis club player has pushed Sundeep,

2364
02:09:53,676 --> 02:09:54,676
What the F...

2365
02:09:54,926 --> 02:09:56,217
Sorry, I am not able to control my anger.

2366
02:09:56,218 --> 02:09:57,633
But it's a blatant foul!

2367
02:09:57,634 --> 02:09:59,884
It's ridiculous how
openly they are cheating.

2368
02:10:10,884 --> 02:10:14,884
We thought they would get a penalty strike
but they only got a penalty corner.

2369
02:10:15,176 --> 02:10:17,468
This is really very unfair.

2370
02:10:17,676 --> 02:10:19,343
Sundeep is going to strike.

2371
02:10:20,051 --> 02:10:23,759
Now, the only thing you have to do is
just keep your eyes on Sundeep.

2372
02:10:23,884 --> 02:10:25,384
Don't let him make the goal.

2373
02:10:25,593 --> 02:10:26,593
Ok?

2374
02:10:26,759 --> 02:10:27,968
This is the last chance.

2375
02:10:28,384 --> 02:10:29,384
Last chance.

2376
02:10:29,551 --> 02:10:30,801
Come on! You can do it.

2377
02:10:30,968 --> 02:10:31,759
You can do it.

2378
02:10:31,843 --> 02:10:33,134
Move... Move...

2379
02:10:33,259 --> 02:10:35,218
Asif takes the penalty corner.

2380
02:10:35,259 --> 02:10:37,468
This is a golden chance
for Chittibabu’s club.

2381
02:10:57,384 --> 02:10:58,384
Venkat...

2382
02:10:58,426 --> 02:10:59,426
Out! Out!

2383
02:10:59,593 --> 02:11:00,593
Bhupal...
- Sir...

2384
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:03,718
Substitution for Chittibabu club.

2385
02:11:03,801 --> 02:11:05,884
Sundeep is calling Asif
to discuss something.

2386
02:11:06,176 --> 02:11:06,843
No!

2387
02:11:06,884 --> 02:11:08,724
The both of them are
swapping their positions.

2388
02:11:11,426 --> 02:11:13,426
Why are they changing their position?

2389
02:11:17,676 --> 02:11:20,801
It’s puzzling to see
Sundeep taking this decision.

2390
02:11:20,968 --> 02:11:22,925
Like Virat Kohli bowling the final over...

2391
02:11:22,926 --> 02:11:26,009
Sundeep taking this
penalty corner is very strange.

2392
02:12:12,551 --> 02:12:14,883
Chittibabu club has won the match.

2393
02:12:14,884 --> 02:12:15,593
It's all over.

2394
02:12:15,593 --> 02:12:16,593
Yeah!

2395
02:12:20,009 --> 02:12:21,093
Yes! Yes! Yes!

2396
02:12:35,343 --> 02:12:36,343
I love you, Grandpa.

2397
02:13:31,301 --> 02:13:38,176
That day, when we really needed help,
our friend, Chittibabu came and helped us.

2398
02:13:38,801 --> 02:13:44,259
When a friend needs help, a true friend
will certainly come and have his back.

2399
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:46,968
A true friend will always
have his friend’s back.

2400
02:14:01,176 --> 02:14:02,176
Give me the garland.

2401
02:14:03,843 --> 02:14:04,843
Shawl? Shawl?

2402
02:14:07,509 --> 02:14:08,343
Bravo!

2403
02:14:08,509 --> 02:14:09,801
Hail Sundeep Naidu!

2404
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:11,343
Hail Sundeep Naidu!

2405
02:14:11,593 --> 02:14:12,884
Hail Sundeep Naidu!

2406
02:14:16,218 --> 02:14:18,133
What’s with all that
nasty glare from you guys?

2407
02:14:18,134 --> 02:14:19,301
I am not the villain here.

2408
02:14:20,009 --> 02:14:21,093
I am a politician.

2409
02:14:23,718 --> 02:14:26,718
Why do you look so serious?
You won the match. Laugh a little.

2410
02:14:27,009 --> 02:14:29,718
I’ve accepted it. I lost.

2411
02:14:30,593 --> 02:14:31,926
I lost my position of power too.

2412
02:14:32,051 --> 02:14:33,301
But will I stay calm?

2413
02:14:33,468 --> 02:14:34,593
I am a practical guy.

2414
02:14:34,759 --> 02:14:36,634
I will go and join the opposition party.

2415
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:38,610
I will badmouth the
ones in my previous party.

2416
02:14:38,634 --> 02:14:41,175
I will badmouth the ones in my previous party.
My new party mates will sing my praises.

2417
02:14:41,176 --> 02:14:43,384
That is all there is to it.
We are all of the same kind.

2418
02:14:48,426 --> 02:14:49,634
Never mind all that.

2419
02:14:50,009 --> 02:14:51,968
I will genuinely go and serve the country.

2420
02:14:52,634 --> 02:14:55,259
Are you all honest enough to vote
for me without taking my money?

2421
02:14:55,884 --> 02:14:56,884
Are you Ready?

2422
02:15:05,509 --> 02:15:06,509
Sir!

2423
02:15:11,468 --> 02:15:12,468
Come!

2424
02:15:13,343 --> 02:15:13,801
Boss!

2425
02:15:13,968 --> 02:15:15,759
Our honourable sports minister…

2426
02:15:16,468 --> 02:15:22,426
Ex-sports minister... is donating a sum of 30
crores for the benefit of poor sportspersons.

2427
02:15:22,718 --> 02:15:24,259
Sir! What a move!

2428
02:15:27,343 --> 02:15:28,343
Sir, you are Super!

2429
02:15:30,301 --> 02:15:31,676
Thank you! Thank you.

2430
02:15:37,634 --> 02:15:40,133
Sir, when the British
occupied our country...

2431
02:15:40,134 --> 02:15:41,922
we began our struggle
for Independence after a

2432
02:15:41,946 --> 02:15:44,094
century and and got our
independence after 200 years.

2433
02:15:44,301 --> 02:15:46,384
But, freedom? We haven’t earned that yet.

2434
02:15:47,134 --> 02:15:48,574
What a pity, the fate of our people!

2435
02:15:48,801 --> 02:15:50,852
They are tired after such
a long fight and they have

2436
02:15:50,876 --> 02:15:52,926
made peace with these
circumstances in their lives.

2437
02:15:53,634 --> 02:15:57,801
What I meant to say is, you
are the one who led us astray.

2438
02:15:58,468 --> 02:15:59,842
Why don’t you put in
your sincere efforts once?

2439
02:15:59,843 --> 02:16:03,343
Forget about votes; You might even
have your face printed on our currency.

2440
02:16:06,218 --> 02:16:07,218
Thank you, sir.

2441
02:16:17,468 --> 02:16:18,468
Yes!
