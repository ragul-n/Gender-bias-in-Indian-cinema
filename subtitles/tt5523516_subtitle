00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:15,846
Sri Ranjith Movies.
Production No. 16.

2
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,145
All the best!

3
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,288
Kalyana Vaibhogame 
<i> Grandeur Of Marriage </i>

4
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:01,353
Hello, Suman! Can you hear me?

5
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:05,513
A 24 year old youth is
hanging from a building here.

6
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:08,553
It seems he works for
a gaming software company.

7
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:09,793
Is there another way
to go to the terrace?

8
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:13,193
We still don't know if this
is a suicide or a murder attempt.

9
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:16,233
If this is a suicide,
the reason might be love failure.

10
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:21,753
Everyone is watching him.

11
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,770
My name is Shourya.

12
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:27,193
The day I was born
was 29th December, 1992.

13
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,313
The day I will die is today.

14
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,633
There is a small line
between these two days.

15
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,713
That is life.
A small beautiful life.

16
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,593
Game over.

17
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:52,193
They say a person sees
his whole life before his eyes

18
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:53,831
just before his death.

19
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,873
Darn! This is the story of my life!

20
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,894
It is my bachelor's party
but they are bouncing him.

21
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,779
Abhay! This is your party.

22
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,793
Our friends got very
excited after seeing

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,833
the wonderful gift I brought
for you. Please don't mind.

24
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:09,993
A gift? - Hmm.

25
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:11,273
For me? - Yes. - Abhay

26
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,633
Abhay! Abhay!

27
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,833
This is my gift?

28
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,473
From tomorrow,
this will be your Taj Mahal

29
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:20,873
your White House
and your permanent house.

30
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,033
You will have a house
but it won't be yours.

31
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:25,222
You will have a TV,
but the channels won't be yours.

32
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,193
Your cupboard and
bedroom won't be yours.

33
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,953
In fact, your own life
won't be yours anymore.

34
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,833
So this will be the
only place left for you

35
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,393
to cry your heart
out and to wipe your tears.

36
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,113
The throne is yours, O King!
Go ahead and sit on it.

37
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,473
Come on, I say.
- Hello! I chose love marriage.

38
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,553
Nothing of that sort
is going to happen to me.

39
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:41,033
Your life takes a twisted
turn as soon as you place

40
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:42,873
the ominous word marriage
beside the word love.

41
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,913
If I've to describe this
to you in the gaming language

42
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,713
from now onwards your
life is like Temple Run.

43
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:48,993
You'll die if you stop running.

44
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:51,993
God Himself can't save
you from this Angry Bird.

45
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,673
Basically Bro,
your candy is crushed forever.

46
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,073
See!

47
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,729
How?

48
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:20,320
‘Baby, where the hell are you?’

49
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,505
‘I’ve been waiting for from 8:30.’

50
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:23,362
‘You told me that you’ll be
here in half an hour.'

51
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:24,179
'You know how much
time it takes to get here?’

52
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,348
‘You’re never come on time.
I’ll never trust you again.'

53
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:26,577
'I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.’

54
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:31,015
He can change his cell phone
but not his wife. He’s done for.

55
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,922
Shut up!

56
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,792
Are you married? No.

57
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,437
Are you married? No.

58
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,999
Are you married?

59
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:10,273
Then why the bloody crazy fish fry the
Istanbul sentimental space ship of the

60
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,592
condemnation of dictation of
the examination of your faces?

61
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,089
Wow, man!

62
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,470
“I married lady named Lily.”

63
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:18,888
“She’s my best friend’s sister.”

64
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,343
“I thinner, she thicker.
I blacker, she whiter.”

65
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:25,045
“I and she so romantic but yeah.”

66
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,614
Really?

67
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:28,957
“I love to wash the clothes.”

68
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,225
“She loves to hand me the soap.”

69
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,500
“Every day I cook the food.”

70
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,860
“And happily, she eats full meals.”

71
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,308
“I washer, I cleaner,
I cooker, I scrubber.”

72
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,170
Scrubber?

73
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,756
“She getting anger,
doesn’t hold it for longer.”

74
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,226
“Pinching me, hitting me,
kicking me, punching me.”

75
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,786
So cute, dude.

76
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:51,253
“She calms down on the spot.”

77
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,573
“Another word from her and I get angry.
Sweet life with cute wife.”

78
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,112
This is not a sweet life.
It’s hell, man. Sucker!

79
00:08:56,938 --> 00:09:00,039
“She’d kill me if I don’t say that!”

80
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,332
That’s why this is my kind
advice to all humankind.

81
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:07,960
“Advice, advice, advice.”

82
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,913
Poor Abhay!

83
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,925
He looks like a lost chicken
found at Panjagutta Flyover.

84
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:41,735
Your words must have
confused him even more.

85
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,753
Friends are supposed
to help each other.

86
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:45,261
Even though my words
hurt him today

87
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:47,513
later he'll keep my photo
as a wallpaper and worship me.

88
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,993
You rascal! Jhansi in 7th class.
Swathi in 10th class.

89
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,575
You knew I was interested
in them but you snatched them up.

90
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,233
This time around,
I was very careful and for 3 years

91
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:55,833
I secretly dated Soumya
without informing any of you.

92
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:59,193
I fell in love with her
and convinced her to marry me.

93
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:00,153
But what did you do?

94
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,313
You tried to ruin that as well.

95
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,833
You'll get married before
me and you will suffer badly.

96
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:09,753
You will wash pajamas,
skirts and live a miserable life.

97
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:12,633
This is Abhay's curse! I curse you!

98
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:15,073
Curse my foot!

99
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:17,633
I'm a Superman
wearing red underwear.

100
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,633
Nobody can harm me.

101
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:26,073
I will get a one million dollar US
project in two months.

102
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:29,753
Once I step into New York,
I will never come back.

103
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:32,913
Catching me will be difficult,
impossible even.

104
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,890
Run like in the movie
'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'.

105
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:39,433
Like him.

106
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,081
What?

107
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,233
No!

108
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:58,873
No!

109
00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:12,921
How could she do that?

110
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16,017
She did it as easily as
popping a mint in her mouth.

111
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,449
It looks nice in
video games and movies

112
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:23,789
but seeing a lady beat
up a man in real life was scary.

113
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:26,073
Abhay!

114
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,538
I have a doubt.

115
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:30,553
You better see if Soumya
is capable of such action.

116
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,239
How could she do that?

117
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,353
I don't think he'll
want to get married now.

118
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:35,833
How could she do that?

119
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,753
Huh!
- Brother!

120
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,153
What? Didn't you like it?

121
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,553
I made the corrections you wanted.

122
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,715
Oh dear!
What else do you want me to do?

123
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,273
Answer me. - I want

124
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:45,593
Shourya!
When are going for the demo?

125
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:46,713
Hey! Who is this Spiderman?

126
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,073
The gaming expert who
tested Road Ramper game

127
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,233
and helped me to fix it.
My little brother.

128
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,907
Meet Kartik. - Hi, Kartik!

129
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,073
He hugs anyone who
says hello to him.

130
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,676
He had 4 days holidays,
so he came to Hyderabad.

131
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,713
Going back today.
- That's enough. Go bring your bag.

132
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:01,953
Otherwise you will miss your flight.

133
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:03,940
Come - Let's go, Spiderman.

134
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,713
What is that look?
Are you feeling sorry for him?

135
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,673
He is not dying from cancer.
Just Down's Syndrome.

136
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:09,033
It is a condition he was born with.

137
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:10,633
He has more chromosomes than us.

138
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:12,453
That's why he does things
in a different way. That's it.

139
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:15,953
I see. - Did you feel
anything when he hugged you?

140
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,722
I felt something.
- Really? Check your phone.

141
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,513
Huh? - He stole it.

142
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,193
He will crack your password

143
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,193
and read all your messages.
Go bring your phone.

144
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:26,445
Go quickly.

145
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,993
Hello! Yes, dad!

146
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,473
What?

147
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:36,492
Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?

148
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,393
Uncle, I'm Ramu from Vizag.

149
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,393
Grandma Jhansi Laxmi
is very serious.

150
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:43,913
No, no, the doctor said
that she will die this time.

151
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:46,535
He said that she has
only a couple of hours left.

152
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,153
All of you please come
here as soon as possible.

153
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,155
Hello! Hello!

154
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,193
I lost my mother when
I was just 5 years old.

155
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:57,473
My grandma raised me
and my brother so lovingly.

156
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:01,673
Now I have to pour Holy
Basil water in her mouth.

157
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:04,633
By the way, did anyone
bring the Holy Basil water?

158
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,503
Shourya! - Hmm?

159
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:07,713
Where is your brother?

160
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:09,153
He is at Aunt Laxmi's house, mom.

161
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,233
Is Mr. Shyam's family
coming from America?

162
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,413
I informed everyone.
But it is difficult for them

163
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,673
to come immediately.
They will come for the main ritual.

164
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,273
I feel these are just excuses.

165
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:20,193
Last minute flight
tickets will be expensive.

166
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,353
And they don't spend a
single rupee without discount.

167
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,953
You know that well. - I want
to know who all are coming because

168
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,433
then we can decide if
we should wait for everyone

169
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:27,633
or take grandma's
body today itself.

170
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,885
No, no, let's finish it today.

171
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:30,713
Gnyanapuram is close-by.

172
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,073
They have electric cremation there.

173
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:33,153
Everything will be done in a second.

174
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:37,833
Listen! Whenever we
bought fish in the market

175
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:40,633
she always insisted that
she would cut the fish herself.

176
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:43,593
She cleaned the scales
with ashes and then cooked them.

177
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,633
When she cooked fish curry

178
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:48,993
the whole street could
smell the delicious aroma.

179
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:52,873
She told me a thousand
times to learn the recipe.

180
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:56,113
I was a lazy woman.
I didn't listen to her.

181
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,793
Now she can't tell me
even if I'm ready to learn.

182
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:03,553
I'll never have the chance
to eat her fish curry again.

183
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,833
I'm so unfortunate.
What can I do?

184
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,433
Satti! - Yes, mother?

185
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,113
They have 'Samosa' (stuffed
and deep fried dumplings)

186
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:13,353
in the canteen.
Buy them for me and call me outside.

187
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:16,454
I'll come out.
Don't let anyone see them.

188
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:18,633
Otherwise everybody will
just be jealous. Come on, go.

189
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:20,366
Okay. - Oh dear!

190
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:22,673
Hello, Doctor! - Yes?

191
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,393
You said that she has only
a couple of hours left. - Hmm!

192
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,353
Now the time is 10:30 am.

193
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,633
Will grandma die
by 12:30 or 1:00 pm?

194
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:32,793
What is your doubt?

195
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,033
No. After what you said,
I've no doubt that she will die.

196
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,873
But then,
actually you know how it works.

197
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,164
We want to go for
the electric cremation.

198
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:40,633
And there are power-cuts
in Vishakapatnam

199
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,553
between 2:00 to 6:00 pm.

200
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:46,113
So, if she dies before that

201
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,633
Do you want me to kill her?
- Not at all.

202
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:49,793
I'm not asking you to do that.

203
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,609
I know that she will definitely
die as you said. - Huh?

204
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:53,449
Forget it. We will do what we can.

205
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:57,897
Brother! Actually, we don't
have confirmation that she will die.

206
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:02,560
Action!

207
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:05,354
Excuse me, the patient is conscious.

208
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:06,753
Huh?

209
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:09,273
Grandma! Grandma!

210
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:12,258
We are 100% sure that
she will die this time. Yes.

211
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,633
No, the doctors are good.
I told you, she will die.

212
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:18,913
Everyone ran inside now
to see her for the last time.

213
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,513
Oh dear! Listen to me.
Just take the next flight

214
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:23,553
Excuse me!
She is out of danger. - What?

215
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,633
Out of danger?
What kind of torture is this?

216
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:27,953
This is the third
time in this month.

217
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,823
You take that old lady
and put her on a bed.

218
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:31,833
I call up everyone like a crazy man.

219
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:33,393
Everyone comes rushing
in a flight or a train.

220
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:34,993
When everyone is finally
here the old lady sits up again.

221
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:36,273
What is going on?
Answer my question.

222
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:37,543
What kind of torture is this?

223
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,993
Grandma! Grandma!

224
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:55,153
Hmm? JLo Darling! What is this?

225
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,473
How are you feeling?

226
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,394
You're making everyone crazy.

227
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,873
You should've been
named Jennifer Lopez

228
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:04,153
instead of Jhansi Laxmi Bai.

229
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,993
If you can make people
crazy at this age

230
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:07,993
I wonder what you would've
done when you were young.

231
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:11,273
You never let anyone catch you. You
make everybody dance to your tunes.

232
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,713
I should pull your cheeks.

233
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,393
Okay, are you on Facebook? No?

234
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,953
Keep yourselves updated.

235
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:24,838
We used to take 3 months
to say hi to a girl.

236
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,393
Now, they say hi to us
when we send a friend request.

237
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:29,513
I've been meeting
all my old friends.

238
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:32,033
Even total strangers
are my friends now.

239
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:33,073
Really? - Yes.

240
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:34,633
I'm here. - Oh!

241
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:36,913
I will call you later.
- What are you doing on FB?

242
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:37,793
You opened an account
for me so that

243
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:38,713
I can stay in
touch with my friends.

244
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,433
I asked you to stay in touch
with your friends not my friends.

245
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:41,393
I know your friends too.

246
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,393
So? You'll send a
request in FB and say Hi?

247
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:44,793
Why did you post Dipti's photos?

248
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,713
I didn't post those. She tagged me.

249
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,433
Sweety saw all the
photos that you tagged.

250
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:49,873
Why wasn't Sweety
there in those photos?

251
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:51,793
Dipti and Sweety
can't stand each other.

252
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:53,793
You are a common friend.
Help them to patch up.

253
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:57,033
Don't let them fight like that.
- They are fighting for me.

254
00:16:57,113 --> 00:16:58,713
Huh? Oh I see.

255
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:01,313
But why are you chatting
with my friends, dad? - Wait!

256
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,093
Looks like your
mom is in a good mood?

257
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,673
Sir, there is a
curfew in the kitchen.

258
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:06,393
Don't go there. I'm warning you.

259
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,353
A person should scold or
hit someone when he is angry.

260
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:09,793
Why does madam prefer
to cook when she is angry?

261
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:12,353
She has made 12 curries
and 3 kinds of stir-fry.

262
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,673
It's okay if she just
cooks and forgets about them.

263
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,513
She gets upset if we
don't eat all that food.

264
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,433
But I like her style of revenge.

265
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,473
My grandma raised
me with so much love.

266
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:25,373
I was so scared to see
her in the hospital that day.

267
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,233
She is alive.
Why are you crying now?

268
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:31,153
I'm glad that she is alive.
If something happened to her

269
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,753
What is my grandma's wish?

270
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:36,442
She wants to see Shourya's wedding.
That's it.

271
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:39,553
I've been begging them
for the past 6 months.

272
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:42,193
But nobody in this house
is paying any attention.

273
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,473
They will listen, don't worry.

274
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:45,873
What is Shourya's age?
He is same age as my eldest son.

275
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:48,393
Shut up. I already gave
birth to him at that age.

276
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,073
But times have changed.

277
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,793
Nothing has changed.
I'm an unfortunate woman, that's it.

278
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:54,593
So much is going on

279
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,315
but do you know
what my husband said?

280
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:57,753
He didn't say a word.

281
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,856
He will not ask his
son to get married.

282
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:03,033
After retiring he
became like a young boy.

283
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,313
Your husband is not so old.

284
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,313
Get up.

285
00:18:08,273 --> 00:18:09,513
Don't you have a
husband and a family?

286
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,913
Will you sit in my house
24 hours a day? Go away.

287
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,233
Possessiveness. I like it.

288
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,943
Stop! Will you go if
I ask you to go? Sit down.

289
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,090
Sit down.

290
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:21,273
Look, Prasad!
You both can continue your romance.

291
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:22,393
Why do you want to
force me into marriage?

292
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:23,431
You have no choice, my son.

293
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:27,113
A man should endure all such things,
even marriage. - Dude!

294
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,713
Hi, Nagamani! I'm here!

295
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:32,753
Hi! - Oh dear! - Come on.

296
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,313
I was just thinking of you.

297
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:37,393
I-pad Ammakka will appear
as soon as you think of her.

298
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:39,233
Who is this?

299
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,633
My friend Laxmi.

300
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,233
You are a beautiful woman.

301
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,133
Look at me. Oh, my God! It’s so
hot and I’ve got to wear this wig.

302
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:48,343
I hate these summers, these
wigs and these troubles. - Ma'am

303
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,393
Nagamani is my friend.
We can talk freely before her.

304
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:51,873
That won't be a problem at all.

305
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:53,913
This is something called
a corporation look.

306
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:55,353
This girl made me
dress up like this.

307
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,233
Corporate look, ma'am.

308
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:57,718
Oh dear!

309
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,873
Since I deal with rayal
families all the time

310
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,353
I have to look a particular way.
- Royal families, ma'am.

311
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,448
Oh God! I can't take this anymore.

312
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:09,313
I called her from Kerala
to teach me English.

313
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:10,673
I haven't learnt to
speak any English yet

314
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,713
but she found a Telugu boy,
got married to him

315
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,667
and learnt to speak Telugu.

316
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,233
Please find someone for my son,
Ammakka.

317
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,033
Of course, Nagamani.

318
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:23,633
This is I-pad 2. It has photos
of all average looking girls.

319
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:30,953
This is I-pad 3. All high-class
families. Posh looking girls.

320
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:34,193
This is Apple. You have seen
ripe guavas bitten by parrots

321
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,313
similarly they are selling
this with an apple bitten by a rat.

322
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,273
It is very expensive.

323
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:42,713
If we put your son's degrees,
complexion, height

324
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,913
and photos in this and run it,
it will make farings. - Ma'am

325
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:47,033
Be quiet. I know.

326
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:50,673
Watch the show.
- Look at this girl. Isn't she nice?

327
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:54,193
She is okay. But she is a bit dark.

328
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,313
She looks better now.

329
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:58,793
Her complexion improved
a lot after she bought

330
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:01,833
10 kilos of Fair and
Lovely cream and applied it.

331
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:05,633
After a month, she will
look like a whitewashed wall.

332
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,473
What is this, Ammakka?

333
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:09,833
None of these girls are good.

334
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:14,113
Don't say that. Within a week,
if I don't impress you

335
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,953
by bringing a beautiful
girl to meet your son

336
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:21,193
I-pad Ammakka
will change her name.

337
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:23,433
I swear on Laxmi. Done.

338
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,553
Your mom is on a roll.
- I don't care what she does.

339
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,193
Once I go to Hyderabad
I will never come back here.

340
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,000
What if you mom calls you?
- That will be a definite no.

341
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,111
Then I’m definitely not coming.

342
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,433
Stop it.

343
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,917
The girl's father is Mr.
Umamaheshwar Rao. - Oh!

344
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:42,913
He is on a very
big post in Bejawada.

345
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:47,803
He has power plants,
lands, fields and lots of property.

346
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:51,433
He has a very good
name in politics too.

347
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,953
Do you think it is wrong
for youths to desire freedom?

348
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,193
You tell me what freedom is.

349
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:57,993
Is it freedom to roam
around the city at nights

350
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:00,353
forgetting if you
are a girl or a boy?

351
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,133
In our society,
especially girls have more freedom

352
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,753
but lesser values today.

353
00:21:04,993 --> 00:21:06,313
Then why did you send
your daughter to another city

354
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:07,633
to study medicine?

355
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,473
She is Umamaheshwar Rao's daughter.

356
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:12,473
I'm sitting here but I can
tell you what she is doing there.

357
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,193
Education brings knowledge.

358
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,913
But it is our responsibility
to teach them good values.

359
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,651
Now let's talk about
the girl's mother.

360
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:21,193
Her name is Prameela. Prameela Devi.

361
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:26,633
She is from a family of kings.
But she is very simple.

362
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:30,672
She looks like Goddess
Laxmi draped in a cotton sari.

363
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,233
Forget the girl's parents.
Tell us about the girl.

364
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:37,633
She is a very beautiful girl.
Incomparable beauty. -Wow.

365
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,513
She is studying to be
a doctor in our Hyderabad.

366
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:42,953
She is not like the girls of
this generation. - A Hyderabad girl.

367
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,273
She will give her life
for culture and values.

368
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:46,713
'So we are going
to see a dead body.'

369
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:51,513
Her way of talking, her grace,
it is so beautiful to see.

370
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,793
You can't take your eyes off her.

371
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,633
She is like Angelina.

372
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,273
Angel, ma'am.
Angelina is a Hollywood actress.

373
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:00,815
She looks even better than her.

374
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,207
Brother, please ask them
any questions if you want. Ask.

375
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:31,393
You studied in
St. Anne's College in Eluru, right?

376
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:36,553
1992 batch.

377
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,793
Yes. - Yes.

378
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:40,768
Please have some drinks.

379
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,033
You said that your daughter
is studying medicine.

380
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,393
What is she planning
to do after her college?

381
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,473
In intermediate college
she came first in the whole state.

382
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:48,713
We let her continue studying

383
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,635
because we didn't want
to make her sit at home.

384
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:53,273
We can stop it as soon
as the wedding date is fixed.

385
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:56,365
My brother in law doesn't
like girls to go out of the house

386
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:57,513
and take up a job.

387
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:09,873
The girl looks exactly
like her mother.

388
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,273
She looks even prettier in person
than in photos. See her. See her.

389
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,913
I won't see her even if I die.

390
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,256
Lift your head, dear.

391
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:25,033
See her now, son. Please.

392
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,353
I won't.
I came because you asked me to.

393
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,899
Is it the same girl? Are you sure?

394
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:49,033
She is the same girl.

395
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,273
She has an unpretentious
family like you see

396
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,433
in those Kala Mandir
sari advertisements.

397
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,873
I'm scared that they have
a factionist style flashback.

398
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,153
Rowdy-ism is more famous
in Vijayawada than faction-ism.

399
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,793
Take my advice and
escape from there.

400
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:02,273
I have a doubt.
I'm sure you fell in love with her

401
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:03,859
after seeing her kidnap that man.

402
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,593
So every girl looks
like her to you. Lol.

403
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:13,033
Okay. If you want to ask
me anything, send me a text.

404
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,553
I will reply.
- Actually I

405
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:18,713
I need
I need to ask you something.

406
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:21,873
That day That day There

407
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,153
Which day? Where?

408
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:24,673
There Outside that pub

409
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:27,193
you dragged one man into
a Sumo and took off, right?

410
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:29,193
What pub? What pub? What Sumo?

411
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,593
A man was running like in
the movie 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag'

412
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:32,713
you were chasing him,
then the Sumo, kidnap

413
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:34,473
do you remember it now?
- What nonsense?

414
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,661
You must be mistaken. I'm a doctor.

415
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:38,473
But I think you
are a better actress.

416
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:39,753
Alright, I will ask your dad.

417
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:41,033
Wait! - Hmm? - Please.

418
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:43,713
I'm working as an intern
in Hyderabad Gandhi Hospital.

419
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:46,273
Please save him, Doctor.- Okay,
okay. He will be fine.

420
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,913
Did you give him the injection?

421
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,153
Sir, we got the new
stock just two days back.

422
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,153
How can it be over so soon?

423
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:51,393
There's a shop outside the hospital.

424
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:52,313
Ask them to buy it from there.

425
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:54,073
If they had the money to
buy why would they come here, sir?

426
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:55,353
They would go to private hospitals.

427
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,953
I don't need to give
you an explanation.

428
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,393
I refuse to accept this.
- Get out! - Sorry, sir.

429
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,033
I'll definitely complain about this.
- Get out! - Come out.

430
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:01,433
You can't do whatever
you want to do. - Get out!

431
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:03,433
'Later I came to know
that the medical shop'

432
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:04,873
'outside the hospital
belongs to his younger brother.'

433
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:08,033
'He was sending 80% of
the medicines to the shop.'

434
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,513
'Then I decided that the
best way to deal with a thief'

435
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,234
'is to steal from him.'

436
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:17,311
'But due to my bad luck
the watchman caught us.'

437
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,753
Who is that?

438
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,513
Oh no!

439
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:25,202
'And you saw me while
I was trying to catch him.'

440
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:26,873
Did you kill him?

441
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,433
No, that wasn't necessary.

442
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:30,953
I gave him a bottle of
liquor and 5,000 rupees in cash.

443
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,513
Now he is quiet.
- Thank God! You are too good.

444
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:37,633
So, since we are confessing things

445
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,233
I need to tell you something.

446
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,033
I don't want to get married.

447
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:45,673
I mean it is not about you.

448
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:47,993
Basically I don't want
to get married at all.

449
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:49,633
That's what I meant.

450
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:51,873
That's exactly what I wanted to say.

451
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:55,473
I don't want to get married as well.
- That's a big relief.

452
00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:59,193
It would be so awesome
to smoke a cigarette right now.

453
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:01,953
Is Kings okay?
- Even Lights is okay.

454
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:03,993
What did you say?
- You want it or not?

455
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:05,073
Yes.

456
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,593
You are very brave.

457
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,233
This house was built long back.

458
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,833
My grandfather had built it.

459
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:14,953
Made each other, aren't they? - Yes.

460
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,393
Ma'am! Made for each other.

461
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:17,633
I know.

462
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,633
Just look at them. They
are imagining us singing a duet.

463
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,913
We are dead. - There's
another big balcony there. Come.

464
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,153
Right.

465
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,793
Hmm.

466
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:38,913
Do you want me to light it?

467
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:41,786
No need. Just this
feeling is enough for me.

468
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:43,393
Huh? What kind of madness is that?

469
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,193
If I really smoke this cigarette,
my lungs will become like this.

470
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:51,297
Oh God! Darn! Horrible!

471
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:54,833
Hello! Choose medicine
or photography, one of them.

472
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,248
Is it necessary to
combine both of them?

473
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:57,930
My wish.

474
00:26:58,353 --> 00:26:59,553
Why don't you want to get married?

475
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:02,759
Do you have a girlfriend?
Or is it something else

476
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:03,938
Nothing of that sort.

477
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,713
My family is trying
to get me married

478
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,567
because my mom's
grandmother is going to die.

479
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,153
Tomorrow they will
ask me to have children

480
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,817
because my mom has
diabetes and my dad has BP.

481
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:18,633
I'm just 23.
I need to see and do so many things.

482
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:20,313
I have to travel around
this beautiful world.

483
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,816
I have to share my
love with many girls.

484
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,473
I have to start a
million dollar company.

485
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:29,069
Hmm. Basically I have
to live my life for myself

486
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:31,495
like how I want to live it.
Isn't that correct?

487
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:37,593
I'm a selfish guy. But you
look like a simple family girl.

488
00:27:37,673 --> 00:27:38,624
Why don't you get married?

489
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:41,153
This! This is what I hate!

490
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,713
Everyone wants to
decide what I have to do.

491
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:45,593
What did you study?

492
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:46,953
Bachelor of Computer Science.

493
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,353
I studied MBBS. - Oh.

494
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,553
State topper.

495
00:27:50,353 --> 00:27:51,673
I got admission
to do Masters Degree

496
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,113
in the famous John
Hopkins University in US.

497
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,193
We can't buy an admission
there with money.

498
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:58,513
My dad announced it on
TV like it is a national issue.

499
00:27:58,673 --> 00:27:59,553
He said that after my marriage

500
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:02,153
my husband will decide
what I should do next.

501
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,553
What the hell!

502
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:06,673
Until I get married I
have to listen to my parents.

503
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,833
After marriage my husband owns me.

504
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:15,313
Why can't I have the right
to decide what to do in life?

505
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:18,633
That's why I decided that
if I can escape from this

506
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,033
wedding nuisance
for about three months

507
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,753
I can then run away to US.

508
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,393
If I feel like seeing my mom,
I will talk to her on Skype.

509
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,313
- I will never come back to India.
- That's best.

510
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:28,993
I will come to US as soon
as my project is approved.

511
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,593
We can have fun there.
Keep in touch.

512
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:31,713
We can think about US later.

513
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:33,033
What should we do with
the present problem in India?

514
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:36,113
You mean our parents?
Let me handle it.

515
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,233
Story, screenplay,
direction by Shourya.

516
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,053
Why do the mangoes taste sweet?

517
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:43,313
Are you chopping them
for the pickle? - Yes, sir.

518
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:45,751
Which tree did you pluck them from?
You idiot. Idiot.

519
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,473
I'm a girl too, aren't I?

520
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,953
In the little time
that we sat there

521
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,941
wouldn't I know if he
was chatting with a girl or a boy?

522
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:53,993
He got calls and texts
from five girls. - What?

523
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,057
When I was there with him.

524
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,313
How will I feel, mom?
I wish I had slapped him

525
00:28:58,393 --> 00:28:59,433
When I asked her why she said

526
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:01,313
After marriage I don't
want to live with your parents.

527
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:03,753
It's okay, son.
She will talk in English

528
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,233
and walk around the
house like Goddess Laxmi.

529
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:07,473
What? She said she'll throw you out.

530
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,090
She said in English that
she wants to live separately.

531
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,913
What? - Yes. - Did she say that?

532
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,193
But you both have to
live separately in Hyderabad

533
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:15,513
after the marriage.

534
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,713
Right. - Yes.

535
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:20,213
That's right.
But who is she to say that?

536
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:21,393
Imagine what will
happen if that man

537
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:22,833
becomes the son
of law of this family.

538
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:26,054
Your dad will shoot him
with your grandfather's gun.

539
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,073
And if dad goes to prison for that,
we will sit and cry

540
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:31,993
you in a white sari
and I in a white coat.

541
00:29:32,073 --> 00:29:34,313
Then people like me
will look at you with pity.

542
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,923
Will mom be able to bear all that,
uncle? Tell me.

543
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:40,953
What if she kills you
when I'm not in the house

544
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,993
like in the daily soap
'Sadist Daughter in Law'?

545
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,993
Look at him
- Nothing of that sort will happen.

546
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,713
You are praying to God
for a good daughter in law.

547
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:49,193
What will you do if you
get a wicked daughter in law?

548
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:50,753
What should we do now?

549
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:53,516
As you wish.
I will marry him if you want me to.

550
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:55,673
If he goes around with other women,
burns me

551
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:58,221
with cigarettes,
gets drunk and beats me

552
00:29:58,913 --> 00:29:59,873
I will never complain to you.

553
00:29:59,953 --> 00:30:01,713
Because you told me that
a wife should hide everything

554
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:02,884
for her husband's honor.

555
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,713
So I will hide them.
I will hide everything.

556
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:11,405
I said that. But after hearing
what you said, I'm scared.

557
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,393
I don't care what
happens to me, mom.

558
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:14,593
But if anybody talks against
my goddess-like mother

559
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:18,264
and god-like father, I won't
tolerate it. I will die. That's it.

560
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:20,073
Huh? Oh God!

561
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:21,913
The let's refuse this proposal.

562
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:24,061
Oh yeah! - Yes!

563
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:27,558
Yes, Prabha. I'm leaving now.
Give the keys to Anita.

564
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,433
Bye. - Should I pack anything else?

565
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,873
There's a lot of place in the bag.
Come with me.

566
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:34,833
Why? You will come again.

567
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:38,193
Again? - Do you remember
dad's friend in Australia?

568
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:39,753
Suresh uncle? - Did he die?

569
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:40,757
Shut up.

570
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,013
His son Balu is coming
to Hyderabad next week.

571
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:43,953
What?

572
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:46,353
Is this a game to you?
I have my exams next week, mom.

573
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:48,113
Do you really want me
to get married immediately

574
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:49,513
and serve tea and
coffee to some fool?

575
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:50,913
For God's sake, mom.

576
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:52,833
Please stop all this
nonsense for a few more days.

577
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,179
Your dad asked me to tell you this.
- Shut up, mom.

578
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,619
For everything you just say dad,
dad, and dad.

579
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:58,873
Go tell your husband that

580
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,633
Divya doesn't want
to get married so soon.

581
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:03,273
If you force me,
I'll never get married.

582
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,073
Oh! You won't talk because
I asked you to shut up?

583
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:10,427
Fine, don't tell him.
I'm not like you.

584
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,753
I'm his daughter.

585
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:14,828
I'm not scared.
I will speak my mind.

586
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:18,033
Once Divya says no, it is a no. Yes.

587
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:23,273
I wanted to tell
them no on their faces.

588
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:25,073
I didn't like that boy at all.

589
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,833
I was very sure that he
is not as innocent as he appears.

590
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:31,996
I didn't tell you this before
but Hyderabad boys are bad.

591
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,433
What time are you leaving?
- As soon as I finish lunch.

592
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:46,713
You remember Uncle
Suresh from Australia?

593
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,273
Yes. I remember, dad.

594
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:50,953
His son Kiran is coming
to Hyderabad next week.

595
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,553
Okay, dad. - Meet him once.

596
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:54,692
Okay.

597
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,473
They are a good family.
I saw the boy. He looks good.

598
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,730
And moreover we know
their family very well.

599
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,713
Okay, dad.

600
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:15,033
Is that so? Oh dear!
I thought it was a good match.

601
00:32:15,353 --> 00:32:17,673
Oh dear! Don't be sad, sister.

602
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:19,473
If I can't find a sentimental
match for Shourya

603
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:24,353
where is she?
Yes. I will shave her head.

604
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,753
Not sentimental, ma'am.
Say sensational match.

605
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,713
A shaved head won't suit my face.

606
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,473
I will shave my head.
You can wear my wig.

607
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:33,633
You are ready to jump
into all conversations.

608
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:36,833
Sister, please don't

609
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,953
Inky Pinky Ponky,
Shourya is a donkey.

610
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,125
Shourya tried but mom cried.

611
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,553
'I-Pad Aunt promised
to get you married.'

612
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,673
'Enjoy crocodile festival, son.'

613
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,433
You are dead.

614
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:57,273
Now the game begins!

615
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:58,673
Item No. 1.

616
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:00,313
Hi! I'm Jyoti. - Hi!

617
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,353
Facebook friends call me Jo.
- Shourya.

618
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:04,073
Actually I casually
posted your name yesterday

619
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:06,193
asking, How is the name Shourya?

620
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:10,273
I got 200 likes.
That's why I decided to meet you.

621
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:12,553
Can you come this side? - Why?

622
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,513
Let's take a selfie
and post it on FB.

623
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,653
If our pair gets
at least 500 likes

624
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:19,033
then we can decide about marriage.
- Is that compulsory?

625
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:20,833
Item No. 2. - Hmm!

626
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:23,593
Hi! I'm Divya.

627
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,553
Yes, mummy. Shall I start?

628
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:31,075
Okay, mummy. Love you, bye.

629
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:34,073
Mummy told me that
it was inauspicious time.

630
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,310
That's why. - Hmm.

631
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,273
Hi! I'm Balu.
Son of Satyamurthy and mummy.

632
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:39,713
I mean Malini.

633
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:43,673
Yes, mummy. I didn't
tell her about my salary yet.

634
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,713
Should I say it including
the cuttings or

635
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,393
Okay, mummy. Love you, bye.

636
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:50,509
Mummy says hi to you.

637
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,522
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

638
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:54,233
My salary package is 24 per annum.

639
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:56,593
200,000 every month. - Oh, great.

640
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:58,073
I know.

641
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,311
Okay, mummy. Love you, bye.

642
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,833
One personal question. - Hmm.

643
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,033
Mummy asked me to just
ask in a friendly manner

644
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,433
as to how much dowry your
parents are planning to give.

645
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:11,343
I see.

646
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:14,353
In Vijayawada,
the land from Krishna Barrage

647
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:16,033
to Bandar Road is all ours.

648
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,433
Since I'm the only daughter,
everything will be yours.

649
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:20,593
Fantastic! I mean, thank you.

650
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:22,153
I mean, welcome.

651
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,184
Item No. 3.

652
00:34:25,657 --> 00:34:29,753
Till date, like I had 8
8 and half boyfriends.

653
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,833
Huh? Half?

654
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:33,619
By half I mean, there was
a boy in intermediate college.

655
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:37,316
His name is Kiran or Karan,
or something.

656
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:39,816
But I didn't like him much.

657
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:43,233
Okay. I allowed him to
call me his girlfriend on FB.

658
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:47,593
You know, like photos etc
But no touching.

659
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,113
Hmm? - Item No. 4.

660
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:58,113
Don't misunderstand
my age based on how I look.

661
00:34:58,393 --> 00:34:59,593
I'm still 25.

662
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:02,393
I became like this because
I didn't meet anyone like you.

663
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:04,913
That's it, nothing else. - Hmm.

664
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:07,833
I already finalized a
200,000 rupees package in VLCC.

665
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,713
They are basically
going to fix everything

666
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,913
from my hair to my stomach. - Hmm!

667
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:15,433
It might take 6 months but
I'll look like this after that.

668
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:18,233
Hmm.

669
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:21,513
You may wonder why
I didn't do this earlier.

670
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:23,393
But I've been waiting till
now because I wanted to do it

671
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:25,692
after committing
to someone like you. - Hmm.

672
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:27,870
So, shall we commit to each other?

673
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,073
Aha! - Item No. 5.

674
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,113
What? Are you confused? - Huh.

675
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,313
I had lovely hair in the
photo and a shaved head here.

676
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,753
Actually one rascal
spent two years with me

677
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:48,868
in the name of love and
now found another girl. - Hmm.

678
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:53,968
He was a big fan of my hair.
So I chopped it off.

679
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:56,353
I got this tattoo for that idiot.

680
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,073
I decided that whoever
I will marry in the future

681
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,713
I will lovingly call him Bava.

682
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,313
But no problem,
I decided to marry you.

683
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:06,893
So this is for you. Muah!

684
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:09,036
Hey! Where is the drink?

685
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:14,152
Actually, I was fed up of
this meeting the groom nuisance.

686
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:18,873
But I was very tempted
after seeing your photo.

687
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,662
Shall I tell you what
my inner feeling was?

688
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:24,993
What a handsome guy!
Yes, that's what I felt.

689
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:26,873
I've decided.

690
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,913
You are the right man for
a girl like me. You are lucky.

691
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:31,899
Hey! What is taking so long?

692
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:33,873
Hmm.

693
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:36,273
Every guy I meet is a bigger
fool than the previous one.

694
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,713
I think my dad is
handpicking them for me.

695
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,592
I don't want to get married at all.

696
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:43,153
Mom! She is dead.

697
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,393
What is it, mom?
Did you select another fool for me?

698
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,113
I won't meet anyone.
I'm so - Hello! Divya!

699
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:50,513
Dad!

700
00:36:50,593 --> 00:36:52,673
Chalapati.
Mangala Textiles owner's son.

701
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:55,153
They are our relatives.
He is going to meet you.

702
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:57,063
Talk to him. - Okay, dad.

703
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:59,153
Will it be a problem? - No.

704
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,593
If these meetings and talking
are difficult, just say it.

705
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:04,593
We can stop them. - Uh

706
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,153
I will select a good boy
from the proposals and finalize it.

707
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,393
Okay?

708
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,353
I gave your number to Chalapati.

709
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,913
He'll call you.
Meet him and talk to him. Bye, dear.

710
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,233
Okay, dad.

711
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:22,405
Hmm. Dealing with parents is an art.

712
00:37:22,553 --> 00:37:25,289
They should feel that we
are listening to them. That's it.

713
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:28,113
They should feel that we
are agreeing to it. That's it.

714
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,873
They need to feel that
they are controlling the game.

715
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:32,193
But the remote should
be in our hands. -Aha.

716
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:36,068
Yes. Learn how to deal
with daddies and mummies.

717
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:45,633
Shourya! - Yes?

718
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,953
Hi! - Huh? Mom?

719
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:55,264
The watchman was correct
when he said you'll be here.

720
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:56,969
Continue drinking, dear. It is okay.

721
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,397
Mom, what are you doing here?

722
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,157
Yuck! What is this? It has no
chili or salt. It tastes horrible.

723
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:07,233
Everyone come to
my house from tomorrow.

724
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,513
Don't eat this tasteless food.

725
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:11,593
I'll make piping hot onion
fritters to go with beer. Yum.

726
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:13,233
Wow! - Mom! What are you doing?

727
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:14,518
Nothing, son.

728
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:17,713
You've met
at least a dozen girls till now.

729
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:21,713
You've found fault
with every girl you met.

730
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,193
You got a letter
from the US yesterday.

731
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:26,553
Then I understood your plan. - Yes.

732
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,993
You wanted to give excuses
and fool me for 3 months

733
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,111
so that you can
somehow escape to US.

734
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:33,953
Even though I'm not
a well educated woman

735
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:36,193
God has given
me some intelligence.

736
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,193
Actually you inherited
your intelligence from me.

737
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:41,193
- I didn't do anything such.
- No? Okay, swear on me.

738
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:43,553
Swear on me that you will
get married before going to US.

739
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:44,593
Swear on JLo.

740
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:46,473
I don't want to swear on you or JLo.
I don't believe in it.

741
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:47,593
But I believe in it.

742
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:50,473
Say it or I will stay
here until you select a girl.

743
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:52,073
What about Kartik?
- Your dad will take care of him.

744
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,353
What about JLo?
- I will bring her here.

745
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,393
To the pub? - No, to our apartment.

746
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,393
Huh? - You have
three bedrooms there.

747
00:38:58,473 --> 00:38:59,953
He is the only one
that lives there. - Huh?

748
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:01,113
Why waste all that space? - Huh.

749
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:03,393
What do you say? I will
cook delicious food for everyone.

750
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:07,193
Eating outside food will
cost you a lot of money.

751
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:08,913
And it is not good for health too.

752
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:10,833
Satyanarayana sir said
that on television recently.

753
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,313
Okay, I will get married.

754
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,233
I swear on JLo. I will get married.

755
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,513
Really? - Hmm.

756
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,193
May you get married very soon!

757
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,753
This is my first visit to a pub.
It is very good.

758
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:30,713
Mom, I've been waiting
here for 30 minutes. I'm leaving.

759
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:31,713
'He is our relative.'
- So what if he is our relative?

760
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,793
Divya!

761
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,033
Divya!

762
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:44,393
Do you remember this?
Did you forget?

763
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:46,353
You came to Uncle Seenu's
wedding when you were little.

764
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,793
You stabbed me with this
for snatching a sweet from you.

765
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:50,593
Did you really forget it?

766
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,193
They had to do a surgery
to remove it out.

767
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:54,513
I was so angry that
I wanted to slap you hard.

768
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:58,673
But my mother told
me that you are my cousin

769
00:39:58,753 --> 00:40:00,753
and that you are a relative.
That's it.

770
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:02,873
The movie 'Mansanta'
was released at that time.

771
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:04,713
Do you remember at least that? - No.

772
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,073
Why will you remember?
You were too small.

773
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:08,593
You used to reach
up to my knees then.

774
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,033
What's the matter, Divya?

775
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,948
I heard that you are rejecting
all marriage proposals.

776
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,193
Did you give your heart
to me when you were a little girl?

777
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:20,993
Secret smile. Sly looks.

778
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,953
Hello! Yes, I'm with her.
I'm talking to her.

779
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,793
She came here because
her father asked her to.

780
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,393
She is our relative. She has given
her consent. I'll call you later.

781
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,393
Don't do that.
You already stabbed me once.

782
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:33,474
I almost lost my shoulder.

783
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:36,113
I can see that you are very eager.

784
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:37,553
I have some urgent
work in the hospital.

785
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,873
How much did you pay for this dress?

786
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,033
Did you spend about 10,000?

787
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:43,753
It costs 150 rupees
per meter in our shop.

788
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,353
You can stitch a pretty
dress in just 5 meters.

789
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,633
And the stitching
will cost you 250 rupees.

790
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:49,393
You will get this dress
in just 1,000 rupees.

791
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:51,673
Don't waste money. I've been
telling you this from childhood

792
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:53,258
You never listen to me.

793
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:54,233
Bring all your friends
when you come next time.

794
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:55,473
We can give them discount.

795
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:59,153
Wait, you don't need discount.
The shop is yours.

796
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:02,033
Let's gift clothes to all
your friends for our wedding.

797
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:03,008
They will be happy.

798
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,153
I said I will call you later.
I will break your head.

799
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:09,557
Just a minute.

800
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:16,499
Hello! She is very
impressed with my talking.

801
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:19,368
Her photo?
Yes, I'll definitely show you.

802
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:22,993
I'm so sorry.

803
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,393
Hey, Divya! What a surprise!

804
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,233
What are you doing here?
- I came to meet a friend.

805
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,233
Why didn't you call
or text me after that?

806
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:31,584
Divya!

807
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:35,593
My friend from Kakinada
is waiting on the line.

808
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:37,033
He doesn't believe that
we are getting married.

809
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:38,393
Just talk to him once.

810
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:39,633
Everybody at the village is waiting.

811
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,837
Should I ask him to bring
dry fish from Kakinada?

812
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:44,753
You used to lick up
the plate in childhood

813
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,417
when they cooked dry
fish with tamarind leaves.

814
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,676
I think you forgot. Yes, send them.

815
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:51,353
What's the matter?

816
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,513
Is he my brother?
Looks like a rich man.

817
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:55,873
Stupid donkey.

818
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:57,033
He looks like a good man.

819
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:59,833
I can't bear it even when
my mom talks to me like that.

820
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:01,873
How dare this fool
talk to me like that?

821
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:03,535
Divya! Shall we go?

822
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:05,353
Who is this? Your friend?

823
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:06,593
Hi! - Hello! - Shourya.

824
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:07,993
Shourya! Good name, like 'Arya'.

825
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:09,793
I like your shirt.
My name is Chalapati.

826
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,313
Is this an imported shirt?

827
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,953
Footpath shirt. - Footpath?

828
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:14,393
I have everything in my shop.

829
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:15,393
Any brand you want.

830
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:17,393
Kelvines, Jack and Jone

831
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:18,913
there's another one
with a hill something

832
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,738
Tommy Hilfiger.
- Yes, Tommy or Jimmy.

833
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:21,953
You will get whatever you want.

834
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:24,153
Tell me two days in advance
and I will get the stamp on it.

835
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,033
Any brand you want. Tell him, Divya.

836
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:27,633
It is our shop.

837
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:29,993
Hello, father.
My work is done. I'm coming.

838
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:31,273
We have lot of customers today?

839
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:33,109
I'll be there in five minutes.
I'm leaving.

840
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:34,473
I'm going to the shop, Divya.

841
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,433
Talk to him and go home soon.

842
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:38,193
Come to my shop. Don't forget.

843
00:42:38,273 --> 00:42:39,153
Hmm. - Okay? - Hmm.

844
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:40,304
See you later. - Hmm.

845
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:42,193
Hanumanth! We have to do something.

846
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,393
Is this funny to you?

847
00:42:44,553 --> 00:42:45,633
Your candidate is superb.

848
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:46,509
Shut up.

849
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:48,913
I will wrap him with all
the saris in his shop and

850
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:52,953
put him on fire.
Fool! He doesn't know me yet.

851
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:55,793
So, finally you are trapped
with Chapalati. Good.

852
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,353
No way! If I get married to him

853
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:59,633
I will divorce him
on the second day. Buffalo!

854
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:01,073
If you put a buffalo
in pants and shirt

855
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:03,873
it will look better than him.
Beggar fellow!

856
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:07,113
It is better to marry
an idiot than to marry him.

857
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,701
Fool! - Divya! I love you! - Huh!

858
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:14,993
Actually I think we
misunderstood Divya, mom.

859
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,793
You misunderstood her, not we.
- Yes, me.

860
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,873
It seems Shourya's cousins
were calling him, mom.

861
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:23,033
We talk freely with cousins,
don't we?

862
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:25,186
No. That fellow will change
his story every minute, dear.

863
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:26,593
Be happy that you escaped from him.
Forget him.

864
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,553
No, uncle. He called
me so many times after that.

865
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,673
How can I answer his calls
after you told me not to?

866
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:32,953
So I didn't answer them.

867
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:36,193
Shourya's cousin studied
in the same college as me.

868
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:39,433
She came to me,
requested me and convinced me.

869
00:43:39,638 --> 00:43:42,433
Really? - You are too innocent,
sister. Don't believe him.

870
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:44,153
I didn't believe him at first,
mom. I swear.

871
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:45,633
Why? Why didn't you believe her?

872
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:47,228
You are like the
yester-year actress Savitri.

873
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:48,833
How could she talk
like that about you?

874
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,433
I warned her not to
fool me with her fake tears.

875
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:53,386
Correct. Never see her face again.

876
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:56,113
Dear, when you said
no to them the first time

877
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:59,553
I agreed with you.
I'm still suspicious about them.

878
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:00,953
I'm sure they cast a spell on you.

879
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:02,193
What do we do now?

880
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,033
Mom, you taught me that
if we give up on humans

881
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:05,073
when they make mistakes

882
00:44:05,153 --> 00:44:06,953
we will have nobody left
on this earth to talk to us.

883
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:11,673
Me? When did I say that?
I don't know such wise things.

884
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:14,393
Mom! Don't you remember
Thursday 1st March, 1995?

885
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:15,873
You said this while you
were showing me the moon

886
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,633
and feeding me.
I remember it very well.

887
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:19,753
That's right. I remember it.

888
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:22,833
Alright, then.
What do you want to do now?

889
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,313
Your wish is my wish, mom.

890
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:27,393
I somehow feel that Divya
will take good care of you.

891
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,473
But I leave it up to you.

892
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:29,793
What do we tell your father?

893
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:31,593
Let's file a complaint
with the police stating that

894
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,473
they are torturing our
girl and throw them behind bars.

895
00:44:34,126 --> 00:44:36,353
Uncle, please stop.
This is our family matter.

896
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:40,029
Mom, you know that only
you can talk to dad directly.

897
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:41,513
I'm very scared of him.

898
00:44:41,753 --> 00:44:43,553
He left the decision to us.

899
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:49,073
I think
Let's do one thing. - What?

900
00:44:50,673 --> 00:44:52,193
Let's say yes. - Hmm!

901
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:56,313
Okay. Your happiness
is my happiness.

902
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:58,073
Go ahead. Let's do it.

903
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:05,747
'Chants'

904
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:11,654
'Chants'

905
00:47:56,088 --> 00:47:58,033
How is your knee pain now?

906
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:00,153
My older son recently paid
for my kneecap replacement.

907
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:02,273
I can take part in
any running race now.

908
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:03,393
Stop your bragging.

909
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:04,673
Who was the doctor?
Was it Prasad Reddy?

910
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:06,189
Shut up! Don't you have any shame?

911
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:09,113
Prasad Reddy and I
studied together in school.

912
00:48:09,322 --> 00:48:11,073
How can I show my knees to him?

913
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:12,993
I saw an NRI doctor named Ramesh.

914
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:14,593
That's right!
You are still a college girl.

915
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:16,313
See how she is blushing.

916
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,328
Stop it.

917
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:19,473
Did you add carom seeds?

918
00:48:19,553 --> 00:48:21,913
We add carom seeds to our fritters.
They are delicious.

919
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:22,839
Yes, we did.

920
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:26,113
Nowadays even actors
are crazy of cricket.

921
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:28,393
Our Telugu heroes won the
cup this time. Did you see it?

922
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:31,785
No, I didn't see.- Are you
going to say no to everything I ask?

923
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:32,513
What are you talking about?

924
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:33,753
We came to Vijayawada
with high expectations

925
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,273
since it is your
daughter's wedding.

926
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:36,673
But after we came
here we were given

927
00:48:36,753 --> 00:48:39,273
a house to stay, a plate
to eat and a bed to sleep on.

928
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:42,433
Where are the wedding tent,
lighting and decorations?

929
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:43,593
When I asked about
it I was told that

930
00:48:43,673 --> 00:48:44,633
the wedding is taking
place in the temple.

931
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,073
Why are you looking
to finish it off so cheaply?

932
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,809
I didn't get your name.
- I'm Ram Mohan Rao.

933
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:50,913
Everyone calls me Ramu.

934
00:48:50,993 --> 00:48:53,193
I'm the groom's uncle.
That makes me your brother.

935
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:54,753
I'm from the groom's family.

936
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,718
Actually the kids - Hello, there!

937
00:48:57,814 --> 00:48:59,553
Is this fellow picking your brains?
- What's the matter?

938
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,033
I asked him why he is doing
the wedding in the temple

939
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:02,673
without spending money.

940
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,233
Why are you worried about
it when we both are not?

941
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:06,113
We are the groom's family.

942
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:07,313
Tell me something.

943
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:08,553
When a man and woman
decide to live together

944
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:09,433
why do they need to get married?

945
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:10,313
Can't the start
living together directly?

946
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:11,273
Can't the start living
together directly?

947
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:12,793
What kind of a question is it?

948
00:49:13,085 --> 00:49:14,753
How can they be a husband
and wife if they don't marry?

949
00:49:15,608 --> 00:49:16,753
Then we can ask the boy
to tie the wedding chain

950
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,753
in their house or our house.

951
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,673
What rubbish! If you hold
the wedding in your house

952
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:21,353
how will the public
know that they are married?

953
00:49:21,473 --> 00:49:22,713
Isn't that what we are
doing now by inviting everyone

954
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,053
to the temple and doing
it in the presence of God?

955
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:26,593
If this is a wedding,
what do you call

956
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,593
spending thousands to
print beautiful invitations

957
00:49:28,673 --> 00:49:32,273
spending millions
to find the perfect venue

958
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:35,073
filling it with many lights
that even night looks like day

959
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,913
cooking 150 dishes and
celebrating with great pomp?

960
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:39,553
It is called blowing your
own trumpet in public. - Huh?

961
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:41,806
Wedding is a tradition,
not a pompous display.

962
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,673
It is a festival where
we invite family and friends

963
00:49:44,753 --> 00:49:46,458
and celebrate our
happiness with them.

964
00:49:46,753 --> 00:49:48,593
We should build
our own wedding tent.

965
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,949
We should invite our
family and serve them food.

966
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:52,753
The whole family
should get together

967
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,393
share the work load
and do it as our own work.

968
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:57,833
Wedding is a happy occasion
when Aunts and Uncles

969
00:49:57,913 --> 00:49:59,152
older ones and youngsters
all get together and

970
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:02,553
celebrate it like
the festival of 'Sankranti'.

971
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:04,513
In the world, another
person takes all the decision

972
00:50:04,593 --> 00:50:05,706
even though it
is our family wedding.

973
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:08,633
A stranger comes and
does useless decorations.

974
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:10,700
A total stranger serves you food.

975
00:50:11,513 --> 00:50:13,073
When we arrive at
our family wedding

976
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:15,614
a stranger comes and
looks at us like we are guests.

977
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:17,793
We spend millions of
rupees for the wedding

978
00:50:17,873 --> 00:50:18,926
but we go there like guests

979
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:22,233
not knowing who is a
friend and who is a stranger.

980
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,033
That is really unfortunate.

981
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:25,673
Our elderly ones were
wrong when they decided

982
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:27,353
the rules and
regulations for a wedding.

983
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:29,233
They should've stressed
that in a wedding

984
00:50:29,313 --> 00:50:30,833
three knots and seven
steps are important

985
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,393
not how much we spent
on food and other things.

986
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:35,993
Their girl shouldn't come
to our house walking on money.

987
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:37,553
Even if she has to
walk on fiery coals

988
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:38,793
she should do so with
a big smile on her face.

989
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:41,073
He should be proud that
he got his daughter married

990
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:42,913
into our family.

991
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,273
He should visit our home for us,
not for his daughter.

992
00:50:45,353 --> 00:50:46,633
I will be right back.

993
00:50:47,273 --> 00:50:50,433
I'm going to receive
some of my wife's relatives.

994
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:52,033
You be with him. - Okay.

995
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:53,873
Ramu, come with me.
- I'm coming.

996
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,713
What's wrong?
Did he back out of the wedding?

997
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:58,513
Just tell me. Our Rambabu
is sitting in the tent outside

998
00:50:58,593 --> 00:51:00,513
with 25 men. Say the word.

999
00:51:00,593 --> 00:51:03,473
When son in law came
to me and told me to educate

1000
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:05,873
four kids instead of
wasting millions on the wedding

1001
00:51:06,393 --> 00:51:10,033
I was very happy that
my girl found a good husband.

1002
00:51:10,353 --> 00:51:13,553
But now I'm really
proud that my daughter

1003
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:19,009
is going to such a honorable
and respectable family.

1004
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:22,233
You are a horrible dancer.
- You can laugh at me all you want.

1005
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:24,530
I feel that this is the last
time you'll be laughing in life.

1006
00:51:25,073 --> 00:51:25,873
Hi, darling!

1007
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:27,513
Even if you say you love
me I can't accept it now.

1008
00:51:27,593 --> 00:51:28,713
Because I'm getting
married tomorrow.

1009
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:30,313
Don't act too smart.
Uncle Suri will get suspicious

1010
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:31,953
if he hears such dialogues.
- Who is Uncle Suri?

1011
00:51:32,313 --> 00:51:35,113
You saw him at our house.
He was sitting with dad.

1012
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:41,953
Don't worry. He is keeping
an eye on me and following me.

1013
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,511
What is he doing there?

1014
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:47,873
He is looking at me like
the villain eyes the club dancer

1015
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:49,065
in the olden movies.

1016
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:50,593
Do something, Shourya.

1017
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:53,633
Actually, no. Don't do anything.
Stay calm. Okay? Bye.

1018
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,033
Do I ever do anything?

1019
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,593
I just find an idiot
to have some fun with.

1020
00:51:58,673 --> 00:51:59,833
You?

1021
00:52:01,673 --> 00:52:02,473
Is sister inside?

1022
00:52:02,593 --> 00:52:05,006
Yes. She is changing
money for saris. Go inside.

1023
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:07,034
Changing saris for money?

1024
00:52:11,153 --> 00:52:12,953
Come in. You came at the right time.

1025
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:13,935
We are a missing a player.

1026
00:52:14,153 --> 00:52:16,833
She said something about
changing saris for money.

1027
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:21,073
Score is 201.
Drop 20. Mid-drop 40. Game 1000.

1028
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:23,439
Laxmi is in line.
Beat her if you can.

1029
00:52:25,193 --> 00:52:26,233
Don't be confused.

1030
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,913
Changing saris for money
is our secret code for cards.

1031
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,033
She came up with that name. - Hmm!

1032
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,604
Otherwise these men
won't let us play cards.

1033
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:34,361
I don't know this game.

1034
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,993
You will money if
you don't know the game.

1035
00:52:37,273 --> 00:52:39,353
If you know the game,
you tend to do calculations

1036
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:40,561
and lose all your money.

1037
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:43,550
No. Actually the engagement
sari hasn't been delivered.

1038
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:44,993
Did the tailor say something

1039
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:48,513
The sari will be delivered.
Sit here and play the game.

1040
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:50,393
If we become too busy
with the wedding arrangements

1041
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:52,610
we will forget to have
some fun with little things.

1042
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:54,353
You don't know something.

1043
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:57,473
Prameela's husband looks
serious all the time

1044
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,633
but he is crazy about her.

1045
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:02,993
I know everything.
Now stop talking and drop a card.

1046
00:53:03,073 --> 00:53:06,193
People are cranes, sister.
They spread gossip.

1047
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,586
Crows, ma'am, not cranes.
- Oh dear!

1048
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:12,273
This is Telugu language.
I will say whatever I want.

1049
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:14,473
She corrects me in everything
and increases my BP.

1050
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:23,073
Oh God! Why do I need
to wear all this jewelry

1051
00:54:23,153 --> 00:54:27,073
drape saris that weigh 200 kilos?
Why get married?

1052
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:28,229
The wedding is tomorrow morning.

1053
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:32,397
I'll get up at 9 am tomorrow.
My legs are paining.

1054
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,757
You are the bride.
- Don't I know that?

1055
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,473
Please don't send Baby
to help me get ready.

1056
00:54:39,553 --> 00:54:40,993
Wear this, my dear.
Put this on, my dear.

1057
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,005
She will just kill
me with this torture.

1058
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:44,903
In your in-laws' house
no one will plead you to do work.

1059
00:54:45,193 --> 00:54:46,553
I can do my own work.

1060
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:49,753
Not just your work,
you've to do their work too.

1061
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:51,553
I won't have time for that.

1062
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:54,073
After going there,
don't throw tantrums saying that

1063
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:55,369
you didn't like this or that.

1064
00:54:56,353 --> 00:54:58,350
Prameela Devi! Turn around.

1065
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,153
Why are you crying?

1066
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,337
Because of you.

1067
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,318
You troubled me a lot
during my delivery time.

1068
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:10,645
You were born two months in advance.

1069
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,793
You were so little that
I was scared to hold you.

1070
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,754
After you were born,
doctors said that

1071
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:21,633
they can't say if you will
live or die until after four days.

1072
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:24,634
What if you couldn't survive?

1073
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:26,853
Are you remembering
that now and crying?

1074
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:29,549
Shut up! Are you trying to tease me?

1075
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:33,873
Go. Why wait till tomorrow?
Go away right now.

1076
00:55:33,953 --> 00:55:35,833
Oh, that is your problem.

1077
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,873
Shall we cancel the wedding?

1078
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:40,141
Such foolish talk from
you used to scare me.

1079
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,913
No matter how naughty
you were at home till now

1080
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:44,759
I overlooked it
because I'm your mother.

1081
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:48,673
Now you are going to another
house as the daughter in law.

1082
00:55:49,473 --> 00:55:51,844
Please don't hurt
anybody's feelings, dear.

1083
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:54,393
Henceforth if you make any mistake

1084
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:58,153
they won't blame you, they
will say I didn't raise you well.

1085
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:00,258
Be careful, dear.

1086
00:56:20,473 --> 00:56:21,358
Shourya!

1087
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:24,091
Hey! Your phone is ringing!

1088
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:30,695
Divya? Why so many calls
and texts at this time?

1089
00:56:31,913 --> 00:56:32,753
Crap!

1090
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:35,268
'I can't go ahead with this wedding,
Shourya. I can't.'

1091
00:56:36,113 --> 00:56:39,673
'This is a big lie.
Deception. I'm sorry.'

1092
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:42,873
'I'm leaving.
Don't try to contact me.'

1093
00:56:42,953 --> 00:56:44,113
Shit.
- What happan?

1094
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:08,033
You are right. This is a lie.
Deception. This is wrong.

1095
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:10,033
What did we talk that day?

1096
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:11,553
Oh God! Let me finish.

1097
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:13,233
What is the common problem
that we both are facing?

1098
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:14,753
Marriage. Right? - Hmm!

1099
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:16,553
We both are rejecting
all the proposals on purpose

1100
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:17,993
but our parents are
still not giving up. Right?

1101
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:19,633
So? -Let's get married.

1102
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:20,513
What?

1103
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:21,553
Let me finish.

1104
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:22,993
There is something called
Mutual Consent Divorce.

1105
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:24,193
After getting married,
if we decide to go separate ways

1106
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:25,873
they will give us
divorce within six months.

1107
00:57:26,153 --> 00:57:26,953
Hmm?

1108
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:28,433
Trusting him will be
like committing suicide.

1109
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:30,593
Earlier he made a plot
to cancel the wedding.

1110
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:32,873
Now he is making another
plot to get married.

1111
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,473
Why didn't anyone attempt
it till now if it is so simple?

1112
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,593
People who do it don't
announce it to the world.

1113
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,965
They do it quietly
like we are doing it.

1114
00:57:39,313 --> 00:57:40,833
If you say no to him,
you will be forced to marry

1115
00:57:40,913 --> 00:57:42,233
that cloth merchant.
Think about it.

1116
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,193
Okay. But I have some conditions.

1117
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:46,953
Accepted.

1118
00:57:47,273 --> 00:57:49,193
Okay. What is done is done.

1119
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:51,193
This wedding is a farce.
Let's stop it.

1120
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:52,633
Let's confess the
truth to our parents.

1121
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:55,913
Don't worry. I will tell
them that this was my plan

1122
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:56,979
and take the whole blame.

1123
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,376
Hmm?

1124
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:01,713
I will tell them that
you had nothing to do with it.

1125
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,473
I'll also say that
I convinced you to do it.

1126
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,673
Don't worry.

1127
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,753
What could be the worst outcome?

1128
00:58:06,873 --> 00:58:08,033
They will scold me or slap me.

1129
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,353
That's okay. Everybody will
forget about it in a few days.

1130
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,131
After that,

1131
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:14,513
they will get you
married to someone

1132
00:58:14,593 --> 00:58:16,113
without taking your opinion.
Am I right?

1133
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:17,593
Won't that wedding be a farce?

1134
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,168
That boy will think that
you married him willingly.

1135
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:22,393
Isn't that deception?

1136
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:26,913
You will be deceiving
each other all your lives.

1137
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:28,033
Is this what you want?

1138
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:31,193
Even though we lie
to the whole world

1139
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:32,639
we can try to be truthful
to each other at least.

1140
00:58:33,153 --> 00:58:34,913
We are not doing this
to hurt or deceive someone.

1141
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:36,071
This is our life!

1142
00:58:37,153 --> 00:58:38,553
We told our parents that
we don't want to get married

1143
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:39,833
so soon in life,
but did they listen to us?

1144
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:40,793
Did they give us some time?

1145
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:43,205
They are pressurizing
us in one way or the other.

1146
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:44,953
What did you say that day?

1147
00:58:45,553 --> 00:58:47,713
Don't we have the right
to decide about our lives?

1148
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:49,113
Didn't you say that?

1149
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,473
So we are deciding our lives.

1150
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:54,313
Our parents want us to get married.
We are doing that.

1151
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:56,873
We want freedom.
So we are going for the divorce.

1152
00:58:57,753 --> 00:58:59,909
We are deciding what
to do with our lives, Divya.

1153
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:02,913
We are not killing
anyone by doing this.

1154
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:03,965
I'm clear.

1155
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:08,273
If you want your life, trust me.
This is the only way.

1156
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:09,464
Nothing will go wrong.

1157
00:59:11,793 --> 00:59:12,873
Trust me.

1158
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:54,673
What is this? Hey! The famous
3 setup. Fruits, flowers and milk.

1159
01:00:54,753 --> 01:00:56,113
I need to take a selfie!

1160
01:00:58,572 --> 01:00:59,962
So annoying.

1161
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:03,687
They made me do thousand
prayers since morning

1162
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:04,971
carrying that 100
kilo hairdo with flowers.

1163
01:01:06,873 --> 01:01:08,463
I have a terrible headache.

1164
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:12,713
Oh God! This is summer
and I have molasses in my hair.

1165
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:16,151
It is stuck to my hair. Darn!

1166
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:20,713
Why don't you shampoo your hair?

1167
01:01:21,873 --> 01:01:23,913
You put it on my head.
Come and wash my hair.

1168
01:01:24,273 --> 01:01:25,553
Don't give advice.

1169
01:01:29,993 --> 01:01:32,153
I imagined my first
night to be a romantic one.

1170
01:01:32,433 --> 01:01:34,593
This is exactly how
I wanted it to be. Wow!

1171
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:41,993
Is everything okay?
Do you want something else?

1172
01:01:43,193 --> 01:01:46,233
I thought so.
I knew it. Himabindu warned me too.

1173
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,593
You'll get me drunk,
get me to sleep with you

1174
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,033
then say Sorry,
it happened when I was drunk

1175
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:55,197
Hello! Hello!
I don't have any such intentions.

1176
01:01:55,473 --> 01:01:57,254
Himabindu is the one with
the magnifying glasses, right?

1177
01:01:57,433 --> 01:01:58,793
Her ideas are like her face.

1178
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:01,279
Put the light off and go to sleep.
I beg you.

1179
01:02:01,993 --> 01:02:03,029
Hmm.

1180
01:02:05,913 --> 01:02:07,233
I can't sleep.

1181
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:08,353
Why? Are you seeing
your friend's face

1182
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,393
as soon as you close your eyes?

1183
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,300
Just shut up. - Okay.

1184
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:15,313
Shall we do one thing?
Shall we open the gifts?

1185
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:16,393
What gifts?

1186
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:17,731
There!

1187
01:02:26,113 --> 01:02:26,957
Why do we need all these?

1188
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:28,835
To open a shop.

1189
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:30,690
Have they gone crazy?

1190
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:32,953
That's why our country
will never progress.

1191
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:34,953
I heard that in America
they give a store's address

1192
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:36,553
along with the wedding invite.

1193
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:38,113
They see the list of gifts
that the wedding couple wants

1194
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:42,393
select one and gift it to them.
That's the right way.

1195
01:02:49,153 --> 01:02:50,789
Why is the light still on?

1196
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:53,033
Who is it?
- Your suspicious Uncle Suri.

1197
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:54,153
Uncle Suri?

1198
01:02:54,213 --> 01:02:56,313
Hmm. He is checking
up on our nuptial night.

1199
01:02:56,393 --> 01:02:57,167
What do we do now?

1200
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,193
Are you mental? - Please,
please, please, just say it once.

1201
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:05,433
No, no, no. - Please, please.
It will be fun. Please, please

1202
01:03:06,673 --> 01:03:07,953
Come here.

1203
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:09,193
No, please.

1204
01:03:09,273 --> 01:03:10,473
I said come.

1205
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:13,313
I'm scared. This is my first time.

1206
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:14,553
You think this is my tenth wedding?

1207
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,846
Come to me.

1208
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,933
Mummy! No, please. Please.

1209
01:03:19,993 --> 01:03:21,673
No use calling your
daddy or mummy. Come.

1210
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:23,389
Your parents took millions
of rupees as dowry.

1211
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:25,233
Didn't they teach you what to do?

1212
01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:26,288
Come on.

1213
01:03:26,673 --> 01:03:28,673
No! Please, please

1214
01:03:28,753 --> 01:03:30,553
Mummy Mummy Mummy!

1215
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:36,553
Subba Rao!
Come here! - My daughter Divya.

1216
01:03:36,633 --> 01:03:37,793
Hello! - Hello!

1217
01:03:37,873 --> 01:03:38,846
She was my classmate.

1218
01:03:42,173 --> 01:03:43,209
Mr. Shekhar

1219
01:03:48,633 --> 01:03:50,296
'So, the wedding is done.
What is next?'

1220
01:03:55,753 --> 01:03:57,129
'Honeymoon in Shimla.'

1221
01:03:58,316 --> 01:03:59,953
'Horrifying Murder in Shimla.'

1222
01:04:00,122 --> 01:04:00,926
'Did you see that movie?'

1223
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,745
'A public warning. I like it.'

1224
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:11,993
'Okay, okay.
I fixed a meeting with the lawyer'

1225
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:13,473
'at 10 am on Thursday.
Is it okay?'

1226
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:15,379
'Okay.'

1227
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:21,353
So, do you know this lawyer well?

1228
01:04:21,555 --> 01:04:22,913
Don't worry.
I don't know him at all.

1229
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:24,633
You don't know him?

1230
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:26,713
Come. Fast.

1231
01:04:27,513 --> 01:04:28,753
I came to Hyderabad this morning.

1232
01:04:29,113 --> 01:04:30,619
Your case hearing is on
- May I come in, sir?

1233
01:04:30,753 --> 01:04:33,193
Come to the court with
the documents I asked you.

1234
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:34,593
Have a seat.

1235
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:36,438
See you. See you tomorrow.

1236
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:38,313
Yes? What can I do for you?

1237
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,073
My name is Shourya, sir.
She is Divya.

1238
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,153
We want a simple,
sweet and superfast divorce.

1239
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:43,673
How long have you been
- It's been exactly one year.

1240
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:44,953
It is our anniversary today.
- Then

1241
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,393
Here are our birth certificates,
marriage certificate

1242
01:04:47,473 --> 01:04:48,753
and all the other documents.

1243
01:04:51,073 --> 01:04:51,953
Where did you get them from?

1244
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:53,833
Once we apply, they grant
us a divorce in six months.

1245
01:04:53,993 --> 01:04:55,913
But we need to be married
for one year in order to apply.

1246
01:04:57,513 --> 01:04:59,313
Don't change your
expressions so quickly.

1247
01:04:59,887 --> 01:05:01,273
We can get anything
done by giving money.

1248
01:05:02,387 --> 01:05:03,633
Why didn't you tell
me all this before?

1249
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:04,633
I gave you just half
the details and you ran away

1250
01:05:04,713 --> 01:05:06,405
before marriage registration.
I couldn't take the risk.

1251
01:05:07,393 --> 01:05:10,113
So - So we want divorce.
No complications.

1252
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,194
Look, kids. Please think it over.

1253
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:15,953
Marriage is a relationship
with responsibility in our society.

1254
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,193
We want divorce.
You can take your fee happily.

1255
01:05:18,273 --> 01:05:19,393
And our parents
will do the lecturing.

1256
01:05:19,473 --> 01:05:20,513
Hmm. - Hmm.

1257
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:22,473
Take an application from
the front-desk and sign it.

1258
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:23,993
Okay, thank you.

1259
01:05:25,273 --> 01:05:26,673
Hello! - Are you at office?

1260
01:05:26,753 --> 01:05:27,553
Yes.

1261
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,753
It is on the ground floor, right?

1262
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,150
Yes, on the ground floor.
Come straight in.

1263
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:32,713
I reached. I'm coming in.

1264
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:35,009
Mr. Rao! How are you? - Yes.

1265
01:05:35,153 --> 01:05:36,233
Don't write your home
address in Vijayawada.

1266
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:37,661
Write Himabindu's
house address. - Okay.

1267
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:40,353
Submit the file there and go.

1268
01:05:40,433 --> 01:05:41,873
My assistant will do the rest.

1269
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:44,033
He will be in touch with you.
- Thank you, sir.

1270
01:05:55,964 --> 01:05:57,193
Come in, have a seat.

1271
01:05:57,273 --> 01:06:00,913
You said you will come
to the wedding. Did you forget?

1272
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:03,593
Sorry, my friend.
I had some work in the High Court.

1273
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,113
I saw your daughter
when she was little.

1274
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:06,613
Are they in Bejawada now?

1275
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:08,993
No, they came to Hyderabad.

1276
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:10,653
I didn't inform
them that I'm coming

1277
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:11,797
because they are
a newly married couple.

1278
01:06:12,193 --> 01:06:13,273
I came this morning on
some work with regard to

1279
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:14,473
our Rice Mill Association.

1280
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,033
Mr. Sridhar's office is close-by.

1281
01:06:16,113 --> 01:06:17,393
So I thought I will meet you too.

1282
01:06:51,962 --> 01:06:55,702
Intermission

1283
01:07:01,907 --> 01:07:03,587
Recheck everything
and submit it in the court.

1284
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:04,507
Okay, sir.

1285
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,427
Sometimes I want feel
like giving up my practice.

1286
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:07,987
Why? Are they not paying your fee?

1287
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,027
It's not that.

1288
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:10,907
They are paying us
money and asking us to sin.

1289
01:07:11,587 --> 01:07:13,267
Did you see the wife
and husband that just left?

1290
01:07:13,347 --> 01:07:15,227
Who? - Both of them are
not older than 25 years old.

1291
01:07:15,556 --> 01:07:17,027
They got married just one year back.

1292
01:07:17,187 --> 01:07:18,267
They applied for a divorce.

1293
01:07:18,347 --> 01:07:20,377
They casually said
that it is mutual consent.

1294
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:23,147
Celebrating our divorce, my friend.

1295
01:07:23,227 --> 01:07:25,067
This is the latest fashion in India.

1296
01:07:25,147 --> 01:07:27,507
She is my wife.
Oh sorry, my ex-wife Divya.

1297
01:07:27,587 --> 01:07:30,627
And he is my XYZ Shourya.

1298
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:32,107
This generation views
marriage as fun

1299
01:07:32,187 --> 01:07:33,587
and divorce as party.

1300
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:34,987
Serves them right for
asking us to get married.

1301
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:36,627
We have to get married
and give birth to children.

1302
01:07:36,854 --> 01:07:38,227
Which convent is
your child studying in?

1303
01:07:38,307 --> 01:07:39,663
How much fees did you pay?

1304
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,247
Will they give discounts
if you have Aadhar Card?

1305
01:07:42,408 --> 01:07:44,627
They want us to live in
slow motion with all such rubbish.

1306
01:07:44,987 --> 01:07:46,307
It is not their mistake.

1307
01:07:46,387 --> 01:07:47,467
Actually their parents
should be blamed.

1308
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:49,867
They should be taught about
family and family values

1309
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:51,147
right from their childhood.

1310
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:53,547
They deceive us even
if we teach them everything.

1311
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:55,467
In front of us they will behave
as if they are listening to us

1312
01:07:55,547 --> 01:07:57,139
but they ultimately
do what they want to do.

1313
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:58,707
How can we be sure what is true?

1314
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:00,507
What we see in front
of us or what they do outside?

1315
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:03,372
Please stop. It is very
scary to imagine all that.

1316
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:05,899
Let's be happy that
our kids are not like that.

1317
01:10:26,027 --> 01:10:27,227
Darling! What's wrong?

1318
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,347
This thing
- What's wrong, darling?

1319
01:10:28,427 --> 01:10:30,307
Did this Aunt scare you? My baby!

1320
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:33,147
Does anyone keep
a hen in the apartment?

1321
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:34,187
Why not?

1322
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:36,107
By the way, her name is Kamakshi.

1323
01:10:36,347 --> 01:10:38,450
They have one in
every house in Venice.

1324
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,147
Eat this, my darling. Eat.

1325
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:43,027
Feed it. Feed it nicely.

1326
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,627
One day someone will
turn your hen into Chicken 65.

1327
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,771
Please don't call her a hen.
She is my roommate.

1328
01:10:48,507 --> 01:10:50,147
Do you know how pretty she looks

1329
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:53,307
when she does ramp walk
in the hall with her sexy legs?

1330
01:10:54,707 --> 01:10:56,627
She is just jealous that
your legs look better than hers.

1331
01:10:56,747 --> 01:10:59,827
Ignore Aunt words.
She is still drunk from last night.

1332
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:00,925
You made me drink it.

1333
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,747
It is just almond
milk with a little hemp.

1334
01:11:02,827 --> 01:11:04,667
Nothing will happen.
- I told you to drink one glass.

1335
01:11:04,747 --> 01:11:06,747
But you liked the taste
and drank three glasses.

1336
01:11:06,907 --> 01:11:07,619
My darling

1337
01:11:07,907 --> 01:11:08,835
Okay, whatever.

1338
01:11:09,027 --> 01:11:10,915
I wish you and your Chicken
Fritters all the happiness.

1339
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:12,252
I'm going.

1340
01:11:16,987 --> 01:11:19,667
Okay, then. I'm going to
the hostel as we agreed upon. Okay.

1341
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:22,267
So soon? Maybe you forgot
to say something to me.

1342
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:25,107
Try to remember it.

1343
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:26,707
I gave you an extra-ordinary idea

1344
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,398
brought you back when
you ran away from home

1345
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,947
retrieved your life
from your dad's pocket

1346
01:11:30,027 --> 01:11:31,357
and gave it to you - So?

1347
01:11:31,907 --> 01:11:35,707
Shourya, you are great.
You are a genius. Thank you.

1348
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:37,227
Can't you say that? I'm hurt.

1349
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:38,867
What if my parents call you?

1350
01:11:38,947 --> 01:11:40,067
I will say that you
are in the bathroom.

1351
01:11:40,147 --> 01:11:42,505
What if your parents call me?
- Say that I'm in the bathroom.

1352
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:44,107
What if they both
call at the same time?

1353
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,507
They will think that
we both are in the bathroom

1354
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:47,699
and imagine us singing a duet.
- You are so sick.

1355
01:11:48,147 --> 01:11:50,467
It is a natural talent. Nobody will
come here and nothing will go wrong.

1356
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:52,737
Be happy.
Go without any worries. Trust me.

1357
01:11:53,027 --> 01:11:54,448
Hmm? The truth.

1358
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:57,749
Shourya! Surprise!

1359
01:11:57,829 --> 01:11:58,789
Train! - How are you?

1360
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:00,469
Uncle! Come, come -Train! Train!

1361
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,349
Yes, Prasad.

1362
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:02,949
Wait here.
- Shourya was shocked to see us.

1363
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:03,949
Wait a minute. - Stop.

1364
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:05,149
She is pretty. I'm looking at her.

1365
01:12:05,229 --> 01:12:06,749
So nice. - Yes, she is nice.

1366
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:08,389
Wow, so cute.
- Yes, I'm giving it to Shourya.

1367
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:09,909
Shourya, talk to your daddy.

1368
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:13,189
Were you surprised?
When Uncle Singh

1369
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:14,309
came to Hyderabad from Bangalore

1370
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:16,429
you told him that there's
a flat in your apartment.

1371
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:18,669
Mom is so happy that
they'll be there with you.

1372
01:12:18,749 --> 01:12:20,709
You remember every
word I say. Thanks.

1373
01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:21,749
I will talk to you
when I come there.

1374
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:24,469
When Shourya was a kid
we were neighbors in MBP Colony.

1375
01:12:24,669 --> 01:12:26,549
And now Shourya helped
us to get this flat.

1376
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,989
Thank you, son.
It is a really nice flat.

1377
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,789
By the way, my wife Mandeep Kaur.

1378
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:35,069
Hello! Both of you come
for dinner at my place tonight.

1379
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:36,109
We'll play with this.

1380
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:38,909
My children. Pepsi Singh.
Candy Singh. Cookie Singh.

1381
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:13,309
Tell me. Tell. Tell me.

1382
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,389
Love you, sister.

1383
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:16,709
I told you that she will
be the first one to talk.

1384
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:18,269
Give me money. You can continue.

1385
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:21,589
Ignore him.
Tell me. What did he do? Tell me.

1386
01:13:21,743 --> 01:13:22,909
Tell me.

1387
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:25,669
After we had dinner last
night at Uncle Singh's house

1388
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:27,709
I'm leaving.

1389
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:29,162
What?

1390
01:13:29,723 --> 01:13:30,789
What should I say if
anyone asks me about you?

1391
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,389
That is your problem, not mine.

1392
01:13:32,549 --> 01:13:34,269
We got married.
Then we applied for divorce.

1393
01:13:34,389 --> 01:13:35,829
After that we will
go our separate ways.

1394
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:37,029
That was our agreement, right?

1395
01:13:37,229 --> 01:13:38,469
That's right. But

1396
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:39,386
But what?

1397
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:41,269
Should I sit here like an idiot

1398
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:42,575
when you dig up
a new hole every day?

1399
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:44,294
Your problem, you solve it.

1400
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:45,429
This problem will affect both of us.

1401
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:46,829
Are you threatening me? - What?

1402
01:13:46,949 --> 01:13:48,909
Yes, this is what guys like you do.

1403
01:13:49,109 --> 01:13:52,189
Yes, I'm a conman. I'm a thief.

1404
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:53,989
I made this plan to trap you.

1405
01:13:54,189 --> 01:13:56,502
Let's call your dad
and tell him everything.

1406
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:59,389
We got married. We made this plan.

1407
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:01,189
We applied for a divorce too.

1408
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:02,469
Let's call your dad
and tell him everything.

1409
01:14:02,549 --> 01:14:03,669
Then we can be out
of this stupid problem.

1410
01:14:04,509 --> 01:14:06,548
Shourya! Shourya!

1411
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:09,126
No! I'm not in the mood
to accept your apology.

1412
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:10,970
I can't bear this constant drama.

1413
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:12,830
You are going out of control
because I'm being quiet.

1414
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:20,532
Actually I didn't understand
what you were talking.

1415
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,109
My Telugu is a bit weak.
I'm still learning.

1416
01:14:25,349 --> 01:14:27,549
Is this the first fight
between husband and wife?

1417
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:30,909
Now you are real husband and wife.

1418
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:33,629
You didn't eat dessert.
So, I brought it for you.

1419
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:35,309
Please have it. - Yes.

1420
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:38,296
After a fight, the romance
is very nice. Enjoy yourself.

1421
01:14:39,829 --> 01:14:42,469
You should be buried alive! - Idiot!

1422
01:14:42,629 --> 01:14:43,869
You will have a problem
if I get married.

1423
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:45,469
You got married, involved
us all in this stupid plan

1424
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:48,842
and now you are planning
to back out of it. I will kill you.

1425
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,452
Shut up, you donkey. Sit down.

1426
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:53,281
Everyone wants to do their
own thing. Don't you have any sense?

1427
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,350
Why will he trap you?

1428
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:58,469
If this news gets out, he
will be in trouble along with you.

1429
01:14:58,789 --> 01:14:59,589
Will you talk nonsense
when you are angry?

1430
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,109
Won't you think before
you say something?

1431
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:03,389
Ask her that.

1432
01:15:03,469 --> 01:15:05,429
Shut up. You are no less.

1433
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:06,630
Irritating fool.

1434
01:15:07,349 --> 01:15:09,749
Listen, both of you!
You both wanted freedom

1435
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:11,709
and came up with
a plan to achieve it.

1436
01:15:11,869 --> 01:15:13,465
We warned you against
it but you didn't listen.

1437
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:15,469
Now you are creating
more problems for yourselves

1438
01:15:15,549 --> 01:15:18,029
with this stupid
and idiotic behavior.

1439
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:19,909
You have to live together
for just six months.

1440
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:21,109
What difference will
it make where you live?

1441
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:22,629
Can't you live like friends?

1442
01:15:22,909 --> 01:15:25,309
You can go your separate
ways after your divorce.

1443
01:15:25,469 --> 01:15:26,579
There won't be a problem.

1444
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,374
Otherwise do whatever you want.

1445
01:15:32,749 --> 01:15:34,429
Okay, I'm sorry.

1446
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:36,509
I was rash with my words.

1447
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:37,835
It's okay.

1448
01:15:41,589 --> 01:15:42,675
I'm sorry too.

1449
01:19:22,309 --> 01:19:24,469
Yes, dad. - When are you coming?

1450
01:19:24,589 --> 01:19:25,669
What? Do you want
me to meet another girl?

1451
01:19:25,749 --> 01:19:27,989
Someone is coming to
meet your mom and me. Idiot.

1452
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:29,629
Day after tomorrow is our marriage
anniversary. Did you forget?

1453
01:19:29,709 --> 01:19:31,389
That's right. I'll be there, dad.

1454
01:19:31,509 --> 01:19:32,869
No. Say that you both will be here.

1455
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:34,709
Are you still planning
to enjoy a bachelor's life?

1456
01:19:34,789 --> 01:19:35,829
Bring Divya with you.

1457
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:37,349
Divya? - Yes.

1458
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:38,349
Divya

1459
01:19:38,429 --> 01:19:40,749
Dad! Divya might
be busy at the hospital.

1460
01:19:40,829 --> 01:19:42,313
Tell her the occasion. She'll come.

1461
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:45,449
Why trouble her, dad? It
is our family function. I will come.

1462
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:46,309
No need.

1463
01:19:46,429 --> 01:19:49,109
It is my family function.
My wife and I will celebrate it.

1464
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:51,308
You can disconnect the call.
- No, dad. Wait a second.

1465
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:53,669
Day after tomorrow
is my parents' anniversary.

1466
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,909
They are asking me to bring you.
I will handle it.

1467
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:57,229
That's okay. Let's go.

1468
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:59,549
Don't be silly. I can handle my dad.

1469
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,469
What's your problem when
I want to come? - Are you sure?

1470
01:20:01,549 --> 01:20:02,829
What? You don't want
me to come to your house?

1471
01:20:02,909 --> 01:20:03,749
Be my guest.

1472
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:06,029
But later don't say that
it was my plot and a trap.

1473
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:07,044
Stupid!

1474
01:20:11,629 --> 01:20:13,309
Kartik! Kartik! No, no

1475
01:20:13,389 --> 01:20:15,189
Kartik, please.
I will cook 'Chicken' tomorrow.

1476
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,029
What is going on?
- Please stop throwing things.

1477
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:18,069
Why are you giving
him the things again?

1478
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:20,429
If I don't give him steel bowls,
he will break glass things, sir.

1479
01:20:20,509 --> 01:20:21,669
That's true.
- When did the movie start?

1480
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:22,709
Just now, sir.
- Wow!

1481
01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:23,829
So it will continue
for another half an hour.

1482
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:24,989
I'm going inside.

1483
01:20:25,509 --> 01:20:27,749
Junior sir asked for
'Chicken' Lollypop yesterday.

1484
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:29,829
But madam forgot to make it for him.
This is the result.

1485
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:31,709
Kartik, please. - I want 'Chicken'.

1486
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:35,069
I'm bringing it, sir.
- No. No, please. Kartik, please.

1487
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:36,789
Mom, let me handle this.

1488
01:20:45,388 --> 01:20:47,069
Throw it now. Let me see.

1489
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:51,989
My God! Kartik, you are so strong.

1490
01:20:52,309 --> 01:20:53,849
You are as strong as Spiderman.

1491
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,909
Wait a minute.
Are you the real Spiderman?

1492
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,109
Yes.

1493
01:20:57,389 --> 01:21:01,589
Oh my God!
I knew it. I'm so tired. I'm hungry.

1494
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:07,029
I want to eat 'Chicken'.
I make superb 'Chicken'. Friends?

1495
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:09,629
Friends. - Yay!

1496
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:12,869
But let's eat something first,
Kartik. - Hmm.

1497
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:14,549
Okay? - Okay, let's go. - Let's go.

1498
01:21:17,549 --> 01:21:19,229
You take some. - This one?

1499
01:21:20,269 --> 01:21:21,989
Take for yourself first. - Okay.

1500
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:24,429
Shall I give you some? - Yes.

1501
01:21:25,509 --> 01:21:26,309
Who made this?

1502
01:21:26,389 --> 01:21:28,669
My mom cooked it.
Is it nice? - Yes.

1503
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:31,309
Now that your daughter
in law is here, you can relax.

1504
01:21:35,469 --> 01:21:36,589
Just take care of me. That's it.

1505
01:21:37,069 --> 01:21:38,109
Hey!

1506
01:21:39,549 --> 01:21:40,429
What is this, darling?

1507
01:21:40,589 --> 01:21:41,822
Don't you take care of
yourself when I'm not here?

1508
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:43,549
See how weak you became.

1509
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,385
You are just 90 but you
are behaving like an old lady.

1510
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:48,949
Don't neglect your beauty.

1511
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,029
Two, one.

1512
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:56,429
Don't you love me anymore
now that she is here?

1513
01:21:56,509 --> 01:21:58,109
Why are you looking at
her when I'm talking to you?

1514
01:21:58,309 --> 01:21:59,669
Divya! - Yes?

1515
01:21:59,989 --> 01:22:00,989
Come here for a minute.

1516
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:06,509
She is abusing you because
you didn't greet her.

1517
01:22:06,669 --> 01:22:07,989
Hello! - It's been
a while since we came home.

1518
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:09,149
Did you touch her feet? -No.

1519
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:10,189
Sorry, grandmother.
- Touch her feet.

1520
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:12,629
Touch both her feet.
Show me your hand. This way.

1521
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:13,949
Yes.

1522
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:15,829
Don't look at me. Apply
it to my grandma to appease her.

1523
01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:16,751
Apply it.

1524
01:22:17,949 --> 01:22:18,909
What did you say?

1525
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:20,669
She is pretty but I'm
better looking than her?

1526
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:23,229
Stop it, grandma.
She also has above-average looks.

1527
01:22:23,309 --> 01:22:24,669
Grandma didn't say anything.

1528
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:26,989
She said it.
I hear it. Nobody else can hear it.

1529
01:22:28,826 --> 01:22:31,909
Dr. Divya, basically she
lost her hearing 3 years ago

1530
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:33,469
and lost her speech a year ago.

1531
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:35,629
So we talk to each other
with our eyes in a romantic way.

1532
01:22:36,029 --> 01:22:37,829
So, when you said
grandma abused me

1533
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:39,309
You are such a

1534
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:40,749
Don't use bad words before grandma

1535
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:41,869
Sorry, sorry.

1536
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:47,909
Done.

1537
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,069
Sir, they said 2 spoons.
You should add 2 spoons.

1538
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:51,869
That's a TV show.
They add too much of everything.

1539
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:53,549
We are improving the dish. - Huh!

1540
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:57,109
Just smell the aroma.
Isn't your mouth watering?

1541
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:58,789
We feel the same way when
we are about to vomit too.

1542
01:22:58,869 --> 01:23:01,029
Go out. Get out.

1543
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:03,429
Madam, sir is burning
the whole kitchen down.

1544
01:23:03,549 --> 01:23:04,746
Will you please come?

1545
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,509
He asked me not to come
in until he finishes cooking.

1546
01:23:07,589 --> 01:23:09,309
I won't enter the kitchen. Go away.

1547
01:23:10,549 --> 01:23:11,549
That's like my wife.

1548
01:23:11,789 --> 01:23:12,949
Did you see how
much she respects me?

1549
01:23:16,309 --> 01:23:17,389
How is it going?

1550
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:19,269
I'm almost done. Just five minutes.

1551
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:22,229
If I simmer it for five minutes
on low flame and put it off

1552
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:24,349
you will forget
rice and flat bread

1553
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:25,749
and eat only the 'Chicken'.

1554
01:23:26,429 --> 01:23:29,149
Divya, I cook only on
this day in the whole year.

1555
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:31,829
Your mother in law waits
for this day the whole year.

1556
01:23:32,309 --> 01:23:33,709
She loves my cooking.

1557
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:35,749
Okay, you can go now.
Go and freshen up.

1558
01:23:35,829 --> 01:23:37,149
I will put the stove off.
- I'm warning you.

1559
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:38,973
Don't add any of you spices in it.

1560
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:40,869
Understood? - Got it.

1561
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,829
Put the stove off exactly
after four minutes.

1562
01:23:43,869 --> 01:23:46,309
Turn it towards your right.
Don't get confused.

1563
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:48,869
I will know it if
it tastes any different.

1564
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:52,949
Oh God! Take a look!

1565
01:23:53,509 --> 01:23:55,374
It is not cooked.

1566
01:23:56,549 --> 01:23:59,413
Your father in law should
just feel that he did the cooking.

1567
01:24:00,029 --> 01:24:01,989
Otherwise we'll be
forced to eat what he made.

1568
01:24:02,749 --> 01:24:05,469
It's okay since I have
to endure this just once a year.

1569
01:24:05,748 --> 01:24:08,069
Otherwise if I had to eat
this every day I would've died.

1570
01:24:08,829 --> 01:24:09,795
Divya!

1571
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:12,949
Hi!

1572
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:16,989
Hey, Kartik!
Your 'Chicken' is ready. Shall we eat?

1573
01:24:17,709 --> 01:24:18,741
High five!

1574
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:20,252
Kissy!

1575
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:21,779
Here?

1576
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:23,109
Yay!

1577
01:24:23,509 --> 01:24:25,622
Go quickly and call Shourya. Okay?

1578
01:24:28,349 --> 01:24:31,405
He loves you very much. I know it.

1579
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:36,309
It has been 10 years
since he was born, dear.

1580
01:24:36,829 --> 01:24:39,033
I didn't sleep peacefully
even a single night.

1581
01:24:40,469 --> 01:24:42,079
But I'll sleep peacefully today.

1582
01:25:02,669 --> 01:25:04,709
When Nagarjuna cleans
the dishes with Tabu

1583
01:25:04,789 --> 01:25:06,126
in 'Ninne Pelladutha' movie

1584
01:25:06,429 --> 01:25:08,869
wow, I found that so
romantic when I was a kid

1585
01:25:08,949 --> 01:25:10,349
and thought that if
I can do the dishes well

1586
01:25:10,429 --> 01:25:11,709
beautiful girls will fall for me.

1587
01:25:11,909 --> 01:25:13,429
But as my luck would have it,
my mom was so impressed

1588
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:14,309
that she made me wash the dishes

1589
01:25:14,389 --> 01:25:15,309
when the servant
girl took a day off.

1590
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:18,396
That's life. Everything
doesn't go according to our plans.

1591
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:21,309
I'm sharing my life's
secrets with you.

1592
01:25:21,389 --> 01:25:22,429
What is that expression
on your face?

1593
01:25:23,269 --> 01:25:24,669
I'm scared, Shourya.

1594
01:25:24,949 --> 01:25:26,749
Huh? Will you run away
to the railway station again?

1595
01:25:26,909 --> 01:25:28,669
Please don't.
We are leaving anyway tomorrow.

1596
01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:31,669
Not that. When your mom saw me

1597
01:25:31,749 --> 01:25:34,149
being affectionate to Kartik

1598
01:25:34,383 --> 01:25:35,509
What did she say?

1599
01:25:35,749 --> 01:25:37,149
She said she can relax now

1600
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:38,749
because I'm there
to take care of Kartik

1601
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:40,069
Did she say that?
Of course, she will.

1602
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:42,081
You took her words to
heart and started worrying.

1603
01:25:42,749 --> 01:25:46,509
No, Shourya. Everyone thinks
that our marriage is real.

1604
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:49,069
What do we do?
What if there is a problem?

1605
01:25:49,229 --> 01:25:50,949
My mom is big drama queen.

1606
01:25:51,909 --> 01:25:53,149
There's no need for
anyone to take care of him.

1607
01:25:53,229 --> 01:25:54,909
He will take care of us.
I'm there for him.

1608
01:25:54,989 --> 01:25:56,989
I'm there to take care
of him when the need arises.

1609
01:25:57,629 --> 01:25:59,928
Why are you scared? Smile.

1610
01:26:03,349 --> 01:26:04,389
God's offerings in this
temple are simply delicious.

1611
01:26:05,349 --> 01:26:06,788
Lord, the Lemon Rice looks tempting.

1612
01:26:07,749 --> 01:26:09,109
I'm a family man.
Serve me some more.

1613
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:13,509
Divya, you know something?

1614
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:16,429
Yesterday after seeing
you with Kartik, mom and dad

1615
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:18,349
I felt that you are
a perfect family girl.

1616
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:20,949
I'm a dirty, rotten scoundrel.

1617
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:22,229
But you are not like me.

1618
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:24,743
Why don't you find
a good guy and marry him?

1619
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:31,629
My mom was an award
winning Kuchipudi dancer.

1620
01:26:31,829 --> 01:26:33,908
She was a gold-medalist
in rifle-shooting too.

1621
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:35,829
You can't guess that
when you look at her, right?

1622
01:26:36,469 --> 01:26:39,509
She left all her hobbies
and interests after marriage.

1623
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:42,033
She changed into a
woman that my father likes.

1624
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:44,709
She feels that is love and
that is how a marriage should be.

1625
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,709
My mom left everything for my dad

1626
01:26:47,789 --> 01:26:49,989
and she views him
as her whole world

1627
01:26:50,269 --> 01:26:51,949
but my dad talks to her
only when it is necessary and

1628
01:26:52,109 --> 01:26:53,659
gives her money
to manage the house.

1629
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:57,029
She stands at the table
and serves him food each day.

1630
01:26:57,229 --> 01:27:00,349
But he never asks if she
has eaten or serves her food.

1631
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,029
My mom is just another
thing that he gave his name to

1632
01:27:04,109 --> 01:27:05,869
and brought home
after the wedding.

1633
01:27:06,529 --> 01:27:07,709
If this is what
marriage is all about

1634
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:10,584
I'd prefer not to get married.

1635
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,290
It is not necessary that
every man is like him, Divya.

1636
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,419
You might find a man
who is very understanding.

1637
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:18,309
That's what my mom thought
when she got married.

1638
01:27:18,589 --> 01:27:20,269
Anything is possible if
we put our mind to it, Divya.

1639
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:21,349
I will talk to my close
friend Shiva Kumar

1640
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:22,829
and ask him to find a
good man for you. - Shiva Kumar?

1641
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:24,349
Shiva Kumar! Lord Shiva!

1642
01:27:24,549 --> 01:27:26,470
Hey, Shiva! Divya!- Divya! Shiva!

1643
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:28,589
It is your duty to find
a good man like me for her.

1644
01:27:28,669 --> 01:27:30,829
I know you won't find a man like me.
He doesn't exist.

1645
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:33,029
But try to find someone like me.
What do you say?

1646
01:27:33,309 --> 01:27:34,469
The truth. The bell rang.

1647
01:27:34,909 --> 01:27:35,949
Shourya! - Yes, dad?

1648
01:27:36,109 --> 01:27:37,549
It is time for the prayer.
Come up. - Okay.

1649
01:27:37,722 --> 01:27:42,037
'Chants'

1650
01:27:42,188 --> 01:27:44,750
'Chants'

1651
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:46,903
'Chants'

1652
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:51,167
'Chants'

1653
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:56,454
'Chants'

1654
01:27:56,696 --> 01:27:59,124
'Chants'

1655
01:28:09,509 --> 01:28:11,549
He packs her lunch box
and writes a cute message on it.

1656
01:28:11,629 --> 01:28:14,232
Did you see the glow
in her face after marriage?

1657
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:18,669
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a handsome man.

1658
01:28:18,749 --> 01:28:20,624
You'll have a problem
if you fall in love with me.

1659
01:31:34,549 --> 01:31:36,109
But Soumya's office is in Ameerpet.

1660
01:31:36,389 --> 01:31:37,429
What is she doing in this studio?

1661
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:39,869
Her company's product's
ad shoot is going on.

1662
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:42,829
Wow, an ad shoot?
I'm sure there will be models there.

1663
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:44,182
That's why I love you.

1664
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:09,309
Why is he here?
- We came in his car

1665
01:32:09,389 --> 01:32:10,589
Sister! - Hey!

1666
01:32:10,669 --> 01:32:11,469
What's wrong?

1667
01:32:11,549 --> 01:32:13,749
Who is the beauty shining
in a Kala Mandir sari, sister?

1668
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:15,389
Model Vaidehi. She is from the US.

1669
01:32:15,469 --> 01:32:16,469
Why do you want to know?

1670
01:32:16,589 --> 01:32:17,829
What will a serpent
say if you ask it

1671
01:32:17,909 --> 01:32:19,189
why it wants to
know about pigeons?

1672
01:32:19,309 --> 01:32:20,189
What?

1673
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:22,589
Won't you introduce us?
- Go find some work.

1674
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,869
Do you see that guy?
His name is Shourya.

1675
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:29,069
He is a big flirt. In five
years time he called me sister

1676
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:31,789
for the first time because
he wanted me to introduce you.

1677
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:34,549
He is a total rascal. Be careful.

1678
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:36,469
I'll text his number to you.

1679
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:38,709
He will definitely call you.
Don't answer it.

1680
01:32:38,909 --> 01:32:39,951
Okay?

1681
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:48,749
The concept of love
at first sight is true.

1682
01:32:49,269 --> 01:32:51,029
She looked at me with so much love.

1683
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:52,520
Abhay! Shall we go? - Yes.

1684
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:54,629
What was her response, sister?

1685
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:56,930
You will get a call.
Spray perfume and be ready.

1686
01:32:58,374 --> 01:32:59,659
Not a call, I got a love letter.

1687
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,030
Hi! This is Vaidehi.
What about 'Coffee' tomorrow?

1688
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:05,309
I love you so much, sister.
- Hey. -No.

1689
01:33:05,469 --> 01:33:07,709
I love you, Abhay! - Hey! Oh God!

1690
01:33:12,029 --> 01:33:14,589
I can only see stones
and rocks everywhere.

1691
01:33:14,949 --> 01:33:16,525
But the address says this place.

1692
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:18,909
Is the map wrong or the girl wrong?

1693
01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:20,309
Hey, Shourya!

1694
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,629
Shourya! Up here!

1695
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:24,349
Come on! Come on!

1696
01:33:24,429 --> 01:33:25,629
Oh God!

1697
01:33:26,069 --> 01:33:27,949
Wild is good but this is too wild.

1698
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:31,749
'Coffee' on the rocks! Come on! Come
on, let's move it. - I'm coming.

1699
01:33:31,829 --> 01:33:34,149
Hold it. Keep your legs straight.
Yes, that's right.

1700
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:40,135
Hi! I'm Vaidehi from Chicago.

1701
01:33:40,509 --> 01:33:41,829
Hi! Shourya!

1702
01:33:42,029 --> 01:33:44,469
I'm sure you've had
'Coffees' with many girls.

1703
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:47,029
I thought,
this has to be something different.

1704
01:33:47,349 --> 01:33:48,149
Am I right or wrong?

1705
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:49,469
You are so beautiful
that even if you say wrong

1706
01:33:49,549 --> 01:33:50,509
it feels right.

1707
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:52,669
Do you always flirt like this?

1708
01:33:52,749 --> 01:33:54,389
Not always. Every Friday.

1709
01:33:54,469 --> 01:33:55,669
And today is Friday
so I have no choice.

1710
01:33:55,949 --> 01:33:56,972
Shourya, 'Coffee.'

1711
01:33:57,441 --> 01:33:58,342
Thanks.

1712
01:33:59,109 --> 01:34:01,029
Soumya said that
you are a bit dangerous.

1713
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:03,149
But you are very dangerous.

1714
01:34:03,389 --> 01:34:04,642
But still you called me for a date.

1715
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:07,509
I like people who do what
they want without any fear.

1716
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:11,149
I can't hide what I
truly feel inside my heart.

1717
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,669
I'm clear. I don't have
time for commitments and

1718
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:16,629
emotional dramas right now.

1719
01:34:16,809 --> 01:34:18,109
I want to travel the whole world.

1720
01:34:18,349 --> 01:34:19,909
I want to have
photography exhibitions

1721
01:34:19,989 --> 01:34:21,069
in London, Paris and Rome.

1722
01:34:21,149 --> 01:34:22,509
I just want to enjoy my life, man.

1723
01:34:22,589 --> 01:34:25,069
Hey, where did I see you?
I think we met somewhere.

1724
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:26,549
What? Where?

1725
01:34:26,749 --> 01:34:28,949
In the mirror.
You are my mirror image.

1726
01:34:29,149 --> 01:34:31,549
It feels so good to hear
my ideas from a girl's lips.

1727
01:34:31,629 --> 01:34:32,829
That's why I met you.

1728
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:33,709
This is the first and last time.

1729
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:35,789
Don't call me for dinner
and take me to a desert. Okay?

1730
01:34:39,488 --> 01:34:40,869
Should I call him or not?

1731
01:34:41,549 --> 01:34:44,148
We are friends.
We can call each other. It's okay.

1732
01:34:47,269 --> 01:34:48,471
Shourya, look at this t-shirt.

1733
01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:51,189
Cute, no? I think we should buy it.

1734
01:34:51,989 --> 01:34:53,232
I like it if you like it.

1735
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:56,596
Three, four.

1736
01:34:56,989 --> 01:35:00,669
Kamakshi, the snake bit you.
Your game is finished.

1737
01:35:01,389 --> 01:35:03,626
I won! Yes!

1738
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:07,156
Looks like your
boyfriend is very busy.

1739
01:35:08,109 --> 01:35:10,486
He didn't have time to
answer my calls the whole day.

1740
01:35:11,949 --> 01:35:14,618
He will be very tired
when he comes home.

1741
01:35:16,469 --> 01:35:17,806
Shall we make dinner
to give him a surprise?

1742
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:21,135
Hmm. What should I cook?

1743
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,309
'Biryani'?

1744
01:35:24,509 --> 01:35:27,269
Oh dear! I was thinking
of making 'Veg Biryani'.

1745
01:35:27,949 --> 01:35:29,088
Don't give me that look.

1746
01:35:29,509 --> 01:35:33,349
You have such a dirty mind,
Kamakshi. Seriously.

1747
01:35:34,069 --> 01:35:35,909
I've a dirty mind? What did I say?

1748
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:38,709
You said that I'm your
mirror reflection, so

1749
01:35:38,789 --> 01:35:42,909
Huh? You have a dirty mind.
Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Stop!

1750
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:18,575
Divya, I'm sorry.
I spent the whole day with a friend.

1751
01:36:19,349 --> 01:36:22,229
I couldn't take your calls.
I hope it wasn't urgent.

1752
01:36:22,469 --> 01:36:25,229
You would've texted
me if it was urgent. Right?

1753
01:36:26,449 --> 01:36:28,819
Oh God! Why are you doing
this dangerous breathing?

1754
01:36:30,029 --> 01:36:31,909
If you do some
beautiful yoga poses

1755
01:36:31,989 --> 01:36:34,936
my heart rate will increase
and I can burn calories too.

1756
01:36:36,549 --> 01:36:37,349
Okay, okay.

1757
01:36:37,429 --> 01:36:39,589
Stop behaving like an idiot,
Shourya. I got it.

1758
01:36:39,789 --> 01:36:41,764
Today is a holiday.
I'll make lunch for us.

1759
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:44,109
Followed by caroms. Okay?

1760
01:36:44,309 --> 01:36:46,549
No other plans. No phones. Nothing.

1761
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:47,770
Hmm?

1762
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:50,709
Hey, Vaidu!
You will live for 100 years.

1763
01:36:50,789 --> 01:36:51,909
I was just thinking about you.

1764
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:54,922
Huh? Hello! I didn't get you.

1765
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:56,887
‘Hello? Yes, Byju. Good. Tell me.’

1766
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:59,257
She filled it with dresses.

1767
01:36:59,774 --> 01:37:01,493
Why will I be busy?

1768
01:37:01,829 --> 01:37:03,109
Tell me where you want to go.

1769
01:37:03,349 --> 01:37:05,429
Watch a movie? Anything is okay.

1770
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:08,029
Sister, the snake bit you.

1771
01:37:08,109 --> 01:37:10,021
The whole town is
filled with snakes.

1772
01:37:10,629 --> 01:37:13,429
Sister, why do you both
have two separate rooms?

1773
01:37:13,509 --> 01:37:15,086
We don't do that in our home.

1774
01:37:16,109 --> 01:37:17,109
Go ask uncle about it.

1775
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:18,789
The t-shirt you selected
is very good. - Uncle!

1776
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:19,949
You selected me - Hi, Pepsi!

1777
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:22,789
Uncle, why do you and Aunt
sleep in separate bedrooms?

1778
01:37:22,869 --> 01:37:24,949
We don't do that in our home.

1779
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:27,029
You are a Punjabi family.
We are a Telugu family.

1780
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:28,061
This is how we sleep.

1781
01:37:29,269 --> 01:37:30,509
Go. Go and play.
I'm coming in a minute.

1782
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:32,943
Sister, I want to pee.

1783
01:37:34,278 --> 01:37:35,709
Shourya will take you. Go to him.

1784
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:37,629
We will have a great
time in New York. Okay?

1785
01:37:37,709 --> 01:37:39,326
I want to pee urgently.

1786
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:40,909
Go home and pee.

1787
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:43,031
It is coming.
I want to do it right now.

1788
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:44,675
Divya!

1789
01:37:46,186 --> 01:37:47,869
Divya! Help him.

1790
01:37:47,949 --> 01:37:50,005
Uncle, it's urgent. Urgent.

1791
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:54,549
You drink everything you
see and pee a hundred times.

1792
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:55,709
What is this?

1793
01:37:56,789 --> 01:37:57,791
Darn!

1794
01:38:00,142 --> 01:38:02,996
Oh I see.
I know who he is talking to.

1795
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:05,989
How do you know?

1796
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:08,909
He posted a thousand selfies
with a new girl on Facebook.

1797
01:38:08,989 --> 01:38:10,033
Didn't you see them?

1798
01:38:12,069 --> 01:38:13,109
Please.

1799
01:38:14,069 --> 01:38:15,029
I don't care.

1800
01:38:15,949 --> 01:38:17,469
I don't have the time

1801
01:38:17,749 --> 01:38:18,879
or the interest to
see his Facebook account.

1802
01:38:43,903 --> 01:38:45,772
Darling! Where were you?

1803
01:38:46,509 --> 01:38:47,469
Since today was a holiday

1804
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:49,085
I made your favorite
'Egg Fried Rice.'

1805
01:38:50,589 --> 01:38:52,109
I've to show you something first.

1806
01:38:52,309 --> 01:38:53,789
Where have you been for the
past two days? I hardly see you.

1807
01:38:53,949 --> 01:38:54,828
Darling!

1808
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:56,489
Darling! Wait.

1809
01:38:57,069 --> 01:39:00,909
See this, darling. Sexy body.
Vaidehi. Superb personality.

1810
01:39:00,989 --> 01:39:02,909
If you see her and
tell me to proceed

1811
01:39:02,989 --> 01:39:04,149
I'll take my romance
to the next level.

1812
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:05,281
Hey! Remove your hand.

1813
01:39:06,069 --> 01:39:08,589
You've been calling
me darling and baby.

1814
01:39:08,669 --> 01:39:10,643
Am I your girlfriend?
Am I your wife?

1815
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:13,389
Don't try to handle me
like you handle the others.

1816
01:39:13,469 --> 01:39:14,469
Hey, what did I say now?

1817
01:39:14,549 --> 01:39:15,629
Don't touch me.

1818
01:39:15,829 --> 01:39:18,709
I hate it when a cheap
guy like you touches me.

1819
01:39:18,909 --> 01:39:20,429
What? I'm a cheap guy?

1820
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:22,172
Don't talk rubbish
because I'm being nice.

1821
01:39:22,429 --> 01:39:24,309
Do you think you are
Katrina Kaif or Sunny Leone

1822
01:39:24,389 --> 01:39:26,189
so that I'll get
tempted and fall on you?

1823
01:39:26,971 --> 01:39:28,907
Ant bitten lips and eyes
the size of one rupee coins.

1824
01:39:29,269 --> 01:39:30,629
You don't reach my shoulder
when you stand straight.

1825
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:32,149
But you think you are a sexy woman.

1826
01:39:32,802 --> 01:39:34,429
Men are dying waiting
in a queue for you.

1827
01:39:34,749 --> 01:39:36,509
Bland face with crazy hair!

1828
01:39:37,669 --> 01:39:40,269
This is how a woman should look.
She has a hot figure.

1829
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:42,629
First of all, you are not my type.
She is my type.

1830
01:39:42,789 --> 01:39:43,749
Even a dead man will
get up and start dancing

1831
01:39:43,829 --> 01:39:44,989
after looking at her.

1832
01:39:45,069 --> 01:39:46,109
But if someone sees you at night

1833
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:47,469
he will die of a heart attack.

1834
01:39:47,549 --> 01:39:50,740
Got it? Now bang the door! Hmm.

1835
01:39:53,949 --> 01:39:54,879
She is crazy.

1836
01:39:55,605 --> 01:39:56,899
How can he say that to me?

1837
01:39:57,389 --> 01:39:59,309
Of course, I'm not Katrina Kaif.

1838
01:39:59,909 --> 01:40:02,138
But I'm above average.

1839
01:40:03,657 --> 01:40:05,229
I'm the best looking
girl in our group, aren't I?

1840
01:40:06,109 --> 01:40:07,749
In intermediate college,
didn't Venkatesh follow me

1841
01:40:07,829 --> 01:40:09,109
for three months?

1842
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:12,549
He humiliated me so badly.
Stupid basket!

1843
01:40:13,069 --> 01:40:15,389
How dare that monkey
face comment about me?

1844
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:19,669
He will pay for it.
He is dead. I'll teach him a lesson.

1845
01:40:19,869 --> 01:40:21,429
And she's some bimbo called Vaidehi.

1846
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:23,109
Looks like a c-grade item girl.

1847
01:40:23,389 --> 01:40:25,789
How dare he shows
her face and insults me?

1848
01:40:26,349 --> 01:40:30,069
I won't be called Vaidehi
if I don't bury him alive.

1849
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:31,709
Darn! I won't be called Divya.

1850
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:33,309
Okay, bye.

1851
01:40:34,109 --> 01:40:35,047
Hmm.

1852
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:40,469
Kamakshi! Kamakshi!

1853
01:40:40,549 --> 01:40:41,709
I gave you your notes.

1854
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,789
Kamakshi! Ramulu! - 'Yes, sir?'

1855
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:45,189
Did you see Kamakshi
in the building?

1856
01:40:45,269 --> 01:40:46,389
'No, sir. I didn't see it here.'

1857
01:40:46,909 --> 01:40:48,549
You know me, Hima. -'Hmm.'

1858
01:40:48,629 --> 01:40:50,229
He messed with me, so he is dead.

1859
01:40:50,309 --> 01:40:51,229
I will make his life miserable.

1860
01:40:51,309 --> 01:40:52,549
'Are we going to the movie or not?'

1861
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:54,984
Lunch? I made tasty 'Chicken fry.'

1862
01:40:55,509 --> 01:40:57,349
Fresh 'Chicken' tastes so yum.

1863
01:40:57,429 --> 01:40:59,269
'What did I ask you and
what are you talking about?'

1864
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:02,149
'Chicken legs' are my favorite.
It smells sexy.

1865
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:04,389
'I think you've gone deaf.
I'm hanging up. Bye.'

1866
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:09,349
Why would Divya eat Kamakshi?

1867
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:10,469
Have you gone mad?

1868
01:41:10,549 --> 01:41:11,669
Girls will do anything
if they get angry.

1869
01:41:11,749 --> 01:41:12,709
We are talking about Divya here.

1870
01:41:12,789 --> 01:41:13,949
Did you forget that Sumo incident?

1871
01:41:14,029 --> 01:41:15,549
But what did you
do to make her so angry?

1872
01:41:15,629 --> 01:41:17,349
Actually we had a small fight.

1873
01:41:17,509 --> 01:41:18,469
Why?

1874
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:20,229
I got irritated when
she said stupid things to me.

1875
01:41:20,309 --> 01:41:22,109
What's wrong in what I said?
I just spoke the truth.

1876
01:41:22,189 --> 01:41:24,309
You should never tell
the truth to girls

1877
01:41:24,509 --> 01:41:26,469
when it comes to height,
weight and beauty.

1878
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:27,909
You should say things
that sound like the truth

1879
01:41:27,989 --> 01:41:29,629
but never the truth.
Always remember that.

1880
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:30,869
Alright. What do I do now?

1881
01:41:30,949 --> 01:41:32,829
Do one thing.
The face that you are making now

1882
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:35,829
yes, that face.
Maintain the same expression

1883
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:39,235
and say I'm very sorry
in a sweet and sincere way.

1884
01:41:39,589 --> 01:41:40,996
At least act sincere
while saying it.

1885
01:41:42,869 --> 01:41:44,793
He is so worried about you.

1886
01:41:45,509 --> 01:41:46,869
He searched the whole house for you.

1887
01:41:48,069 --> 01:41:49,309
You are better than me.

1888
01:41:50,429 --> 01:41:52,829
You don't have to be so happy.

1889
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:55,029
This is temporary too.

1890
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:58,749
Once that Vaidehi enters the house,
you will be finished.

1891
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:02,069
I found Kamakshi, darling.

1892
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:03,869
It crept into a carton under my bed.

1893
01:42:03,949 --> 01:42:06,805
Stupid bird.
She had me so worried. Oh God!

1894
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:11,109
Of course, baby.
How can I forget your birthday?

1895
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:14,029
I booked a beautiful candle
light dinner in Taj Krishna.

1896
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:16,509
So get ready for a beautiful,
super romantic birthday.

1897
01:42:17,229 --> 01:42:19,108
We'll have lots of fun.
What do you say?

1898
01:42:25,749 --> 01:42:27,949
Be ready, darling.
I will come to pick you up.

1899
01:42:31,389 --> 01:42:32,860
I love you, Shourya. - Huh!

1900
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:36,865
I really didn't have these
feelings until I met you.

1901
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:40,269
But you and your words

1902
01:42:40,909 --> 01:42:42,271
I'm just so happy with you.

1903
01:42:42,749 --> 01:42:45,989
I don't know when
I fell into this process.

1904
01:42:50,027 --> 01:42:51,709
Did you expect that I'll
say something like that?

1905
01:42:52,389 --> 01:42:53,789
That will never happen.

1906
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:56,629
Vaidehi! Mirror image of Shourya.

1907
01:42:57,709 --> 01:42:58,909
Thank God!

1908
01:42:59,389 --> 01:43:00,309
You are the only one that
gave me such a big shock

1909
01:43:00,389 --> 01:43:01,629
for the first time in my life.

1910
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:03,029
Good. Very good.

1911
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:04,989
With me, you will experience
a new thrill every day and

1912
01:43:05,149 --> 01:43:07,000
a new shock every hour. - Shourya.

1913
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:09,321
Hmm? Divya! What are you doing here?

1914
01:43:09,589 --> 01:43:10,389
Vaidehi, Divya!

1915
01:43:10,469 --> 01:43:11,469
Divya, Vaidehi! - Hello!

1916
01:43:11,549 --> 01:43:12,789
Hi! - Who is she?

1917
01:43:13,389 --> 01:43:14,229
Cousin.

1918
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:16,589
Yeah, my cousin. Sit down, Divya.

1919
01:43:16,669 --> 01:43:17,909
This table won't be enough. - Why?

1920
01:43:17,989 --> 01:43:19,229
We are three of us
and there are four chairs.

1921
01:43:19,309 --> 01:43:20,549
What about them? - Who?

1922
01:43:20,869 --> 01:43:22,069
Hi!

1923
01:43:22,149 --> 01:43:23,837
Hi, Shourya uncle!

1924
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:25,229
Any problem?

1925
01:43:25,309 --> 01:43:27,989
Yeah. No. Absolutely no problem. No.

1926
01:43:28,269 --> 01:43:29,269
Not yet.

1927
01:43:29,629 --> 01:43:30,509
Who are they?

1928
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:31,706
Friends.

1929
01:43:31,989 --> 01:43:34,049
No, they are more than that.
Almost family.

1930
01:43:34,109 --> 01:43:35,429
How can your family be Punjabis?

1931
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:37,669
This is interstate marriage
like inter-cast marriage.

1932
01:43:37,749 --> 01:43:38,789
How interesting!

1933
01:43:38,989 --> 01:43:40,109
Right? - How?

1934
01:43:40,189 --> 01:43:41,989
How - Tell her, Shourya.

1935
01:43:42,069 --> 01:43:43,189
We'll tell her after
we come back, Divya.

1936
01:43:43,549 --> 01:43:44,629
One minute. - Yeah, sure.

1937
01:43:45,069 --> 01:43:45,909
Come with me.

1938
01:43:45,989 --> 01:43:47,709
What is this nuisance? - We heard
that it is Divya's birthday today.

1939
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:49,589
Why didn't you tell us before,
Shourya?

1940
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:50,869
She suddenly invited us for dinner.

1941
01:43:50,949 --> 01:43:51,949
We couldn't bring her a gift.

1942
01:43:52,029 --> 01:43:53,749
Your coming is like
a gift for Shourya, uncle.

1943
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:55,149
Who is that girl?

1944
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:56,709
A friend. - Divya's friend?

1945
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:58,429
No, she's a cousin, Aunt.

1946
01:43:58,909 --> 01:44:00,149
Divya's cousin? - Yeah.

1947
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:01,389
No, Shourya's cousin.

1948
01:44:01,469 --> 01:44:03,189
Yeah, cousin. - Cousin sister?

1949
01:44:03,269 --> 01:44:04,469
You don't have sisters, right?

1950
01:44:04,549 --> 01:44:06,629
There's Vaidehi, Divya. Shall we go?

1951
01:44:06,709 --> 01:44:07,869
Mummy, 'Juice'! - Hello, Aunt!

1952
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:09,709
Hello! - She is very cute, son.

1953
01:44:10,429 --> 01:44:12,429
Uncle! You know Shourya's
family very well, right?

1954
01:44:12,509 --> 01:44:13,429
Of course, dear.

1955
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:14,909
We were their
neighbors for 15 years.

1956
01:44:14,989 --> 01:44:16,109
Their family is like my family.

1957
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:18,269
Then tell uncle how Vaidehi
is related to you, Shourya.

1958
01:44:18,349 --> 01:44:20,229
I'm sure uncle knows her parents.

1959
01:44:20,589 --> 01:44:21,829
Yes. Tell me, son.

1960
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:23,989
My dad's cousin brother

1961
01:44:24,069 --> 01:44:25,789
Srinivasa Rao.
I met him in Bangalore recently.

1962
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:27,151
So it is not him.

1963
01:44:27,789 --> 01:44:29,469
My mom's younger brother - Ramu!

1964
01:44:29,909 --> 01:44:31,669
Ramu uncle's daughter
- Ramu doesn't have children.

1965
01:44:31,749 --> 01:44:33,349
Right. But Ramu's older brother has.

1966
01:44:33,429 --> 01:44:34,812
But your dad said
that they are still kids.

1967
01:44:35,949 --> 01:44:37,389
He said that? I'm sure he did.

1968
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:38,709
Then he must be right.

1969
01:44:38,789 --> 01:44:41,389
Okay. I still didn't understand
how she is your cousin.

1970
01:44:41,469 --> 01:44:42,389
I just told you. - No, you didn't.

1971
01:44:42,469 --> 01:44:43,269
I didn't?

1972
01:44:43,349 --> 01:44:44,829
You know my dad's family
and my mom's family?

1973
01:44:44,909 --> 01:44:46,229
I know. - Hmm?

1974
01:44:46,549 --> 01:44:48,069
And my Aunt in Pune?
- I don't know her.

1975
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:50,189
Yes! She is her daughter.

1976
01:44:50,269 --> 01:44:51,808
So what is this
Pune girl doing here?

1977
01:44:52,451 --> 01:44:53,069
She is studying here.

1978
01:44:53,149 --> 01:44:54,549
But she told me she is a model.

1979
01:44:54,949 --> 01:44:56,231
She is studying modeling.

1980
01:44:57,469 --> 01:44:59,269
How can anyone study modeling?-She
is modeling while studying, uncle.

1981
01:44:59,349 --> 01:45:00,149
Studying modeling.

1982
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:02,052
Aunt, are you a model?

1983
01:45:02,349 --> 01:45:03,949
Yes. Didn't Shourya tell you?

1984
01:45:04,029 --> 01:45:04,909
No, he didn't.

1985
01:45:05,309 --> 01:45:06,869
He didn't even tell
me that you are coming.

1986
01:45:06,949 --> 01:45:07,949
He didn't tell me too.

1987
01:45:08,029 --> 01:45:09,549
He didn't tell us anything
as well until we came here.

1988
01:45:09,629 --> 01:45:11,029
Shourya! Where is the birthday 'Cake'?

1989
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:12,869
Did you tell them
that it is my birthday?

1990
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:14,469
What? Today is your birthday too?

1991
01:45:14,549 --> 01:45:16,173
Yours too? - Yes.

1992
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:18,589
Wow, Shourya! So exciting!

1993
01:45:18,669 --> 01:45:19,829
Yes, it is too much.

1994
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:21,549
He didn't tell me about you

1995
01:45:21,629 --> 01:45:23,189
so how will he tell
me about your birthday?

1996
01:45:23,269 --> 01:45:25,509
Happy birthday, Divya!
- Thank you. Same to you.

1997
01:45:25,589 --> 01:45:28,350
You are welcome. - 'Divya,
please do something. Save me.'

1998
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:31,549
'How, Shourya? I have eyes
the size of one rupee coins'

1999
01:45:31,629 --> 01:45:34,185
'and a pea-sized brain.
How can I help you?

2000
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:37,109
'I'm sorry, really sorry.
I will never be rude to you again.'

2001
01:45:37,189 --> 01:45:39,069
'After seeing my bland
face and crazy hair'

2002
01:45:39,229 --> 01:45:42,690
'even a healthy man will die.
So, what can I do?'

2003
01:45:43,069 --> 01:45:45,069
'You look like an angel.
You look like'

2004
01:45:45,149 --> 01:45:46,309
'a heady mix of Miss
World and Miss Universe.'

2005
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:47,629
'Please ignore everything I said.'

2006
01:45:47,709 --> 01:45:49,229
'I said that because I didn't
want to be tempted, darling.'

2007
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:51,869
'Hmm. I don't think you
are saying that wholeheartedly.'

2008
01:45:51,949 --> 01:45:54,269
'Please.
Please, I will touch your feet.'

2009
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:57,069
'Okay, go ahead.'

2010
01:45:57,709 --> 01:45:58,909
'What? Me? No way.'

2011
01:45:59,189 --> 01:46:00,589
Shourya, did you tell
them about the marriage?

2012
01:46:00,669 --> 01:46:02,229
Marriage? - Whose marriage?

2013
01:46:02,509 --> 01:46:03,416
Hmm?

2014
01:46:12,189 --> 01:46:12,989
I found the spoon.

2015
01:46:13,069 --> 01:46:15,549
Okay? Happy now?
Shall we cut the 'Cake'?

2016
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:19,189
Happy birthday to you!

2017
01:46:19,389 --> 01:46:22,909
- Let's cut it together.
- Happy birthday to you!

2018
01:46:22,989 --> 01:46:24,185
The older ones first.

2019
01:46:45,529 --> 01:46:47,029
Divya, I'm - Sorry.

2020
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:51,258
Me too. I spoke rubbish.
I didn't mean all that.

2021
01:46:52,389 --> 01:46:53,909
It is true that I irritated you.

2022
01:46:54,438 --> 01:46:55,869
But what if Uncle Singh
got suspicious after today

2023
01:46:55,949 --> 01:46:58,869
and told dad about it?
We both will be in a problem.

2024
01:46:59,109 --> 01:47:02,109
I'm sorry. I'll never do that again.

2025
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:03,629
I behaved in a very foolish manner.

2026
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:06,549
I vented out my anger in
a wrong way. I'm really sorry.

2027
01:47:06,749 --> 01:47:07,749
PMS?

2028
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:08,989
What?

2029
01:47:09,269 --> 01:47:12,265
I mean, monthly I know about it.

2030
01:47:12,549 --> 01:47:15,761
Hello! Every mood swing that
a girl has is not PMS. Stupid.

2031
01:47:16,949 --> 01:47:18,749
Whatever the reason was,
don't let it happen again.

2032
01:47:18,949 --> 01:47:20,309
The mood is yours but
the swings will come to me.

2033
01:47:20,389 --> 01:47:21,549
It is very difficult to handle.

2034
01:47:21,629 --> 01:47:22,629
Hmm.

2035
01:47:23,974 --> 01:47:25,660
This is why I told you no.
But you didn't listen to me.

2036
01:47:26,549 --> 01:47:28,509
What? Are you totally
in love with him?

2037
01:47:28,789 --> 01:47:29,749
What are you talking about?

2038
01:47:30,109 --> 01:47:31,269
Don't pretend before me.

2039
01:47:31,389 --> 01:47:32,789
I don't know what you are thinking.

2040
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,869
Shourya and me are just friends.

2041
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,069
Did I say Shourya?
You are saying that.

2042
01:47:40,589 --> 01:47:42,829
Why do you get upset
when anyone mentions Vaidehi?

2043
01:47:43,309 --> 01:47:44,924
Why have you been so
dull for the past four days?

2044
01:47:45,942 --> 01:47:47,549
There are hundred
reasons for my bad mood.

2045
01:47:47,869 --> 01:47:49,749
None of those reasons
are about Shourya.

2046
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:52,949
What we have between
us is just a contract.

2047
01:47:53,829 --> 01:47:55,557
Four documents and two signatures.

2048
01:47:59,429 --> 01:48:00,789
We will get a divorce in a month.

2049
01:48:01,429 --> 01:48:02,229
Finish.

2050
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,709
Looks like you are trying
hard to convince yourself.

2051
01:48:04,989 --> 01:48:06,069
Wish you all the best.

2052
01:48:06,469 --> 01:48:07,423
Bye.

2053
01:48:12,349 --> 01:48:14,069
Darling,
honey, I know that you are busy.

2054
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:16,309
I will take 2 mins, But
after yesterday's dinner episode

2055
01:48:16,538 --> 01:48:18,709
I took a decision
to avoid such confusions.

2056
01:48:18,789 --> 01:48:20,285
That was to meet Vaidehi.

2057
01:48:20,989 --> 01:48:22,669
I braced myself for whatever
the consequences might be

2058
01:48:22,909 --> 01:48:24,149
and told her the whole truth.

2059
01:48:24,309 --> 01:48:25,109
At first she was shocked.

2060
01:48:25,189 --> 01:48:26,709
After that she burst out laughing,
you know.

2061
01:48:26,949 --> 01:48:28,749
She said, I usually talk
about breaking the rules and so on

2062
01:48:28,909 --> 01:48:30,949
but what you both did
is totally the next level.

2063
01:48:31,029 --> 01:48:32,949
I even told her how you
put me in trouble last night.

2064
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:34,149
She couldn't control laughing.

2065
01:48:34,229 --> 01:48:36,349
She said, Divya is perfect
to handle your crazy behavior.

2066
01:48:36,429 --> 01:48:38,749
Anyway, Vaidu wants
to meet you this evening.

2067
01:48:38,829 --> 01:48:41,789
So 8 pm I'll pick you up.
After that we all can party.

2068
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:42,789
What do you say?

2069
01:48:42,869 --> 01:48:44,342
I will call you later. Bye.

2070
01:48:45,069 --> 01:48:46,804
Hello? Hello, Divya?

2071
01:49:22,029 --> 01:49:23,149
Shourya! Shourya! Get up!

2072
01:49:23,229 --> 01:49:25,645
Shourya! Shourya! Shourya! Get up!

2073
01:49:31,469 --> 01:49:32,630
Shourya?

2074
01:49:33,429 --> 01:49:35,189
Shourya? Shourya!

2075
01:49:35,429 --> 01:49:37,295
Shourya, get up! - Divya!

2076
01:49:38,349 --> 01:49:39,189
Divya!

2077
01:49:39,269 --> 01:49:40,316
What is this?

2078
01:49:40,749 --> 01:49:42,189
What are you doing
in Vaidehi's flat?

2079
01:49:42,378 --> 01:49:43,789
She is in our flat, stupid.

2080
01:49:44,629 --> 01:49:47,629
I thought I dropped her home.
Did she drop me?

2081
01:49:47,709 --> 01:49:50,349
No problem.
Anything is fine. Good night, baby.

2082
01:49:50,669 --> 01:49:53,149
Go to sleep. - Oh God! Shourya!

2083
01:49:54,174 --> 01:49:56,149
What?- Mom and dad are here.

2084
01:49:56,229 --> 01:49:57,429
Why did my parents come here?

2085
01:49:57,509 --> 01:49:59,162
My parents are here, Shourya.

2086
01:50:00,149 --> 01:50:01,349
Still switched off.

2087
01:50:01,909 --> 01:50:03,589
The watchman said they were at home.

2088
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,909
I don't know. - What do I do?

2089
01:50:04,989 --> 01:50:06,629
Darling, wake up. -Shourya!

2090
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:07,989
Let's hide her in the storeroom.

2091
01:50:10,669 --> 01:50:11,923
Sorry. Sorry.

2092
01:50:14,629 --> 01:50:15,989
Go open the door. Go.

2093
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:23,789
Were you still sleeping?

2094
01:50:23,869 --> 01:50:24,935
We slept late last night, mom.

2095
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:27,349
I was at the hospital.

2096
01:50:31,029 --> 01:50:31,997
Don't move.

2097
01:50:37,313 --> 01:50:38,749
Divya, did you make 'Coffee'?

2098
01:50:39,069 --> 01:50:42,189
Mom! Dad!
What a surprise! When did you come?

2099
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:43,109
How are you, son?

2100
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:44,549
Divya takes good care of me.

2101
01:50:44,749 --> 01:50:46,149
Mom, how is your health?

2102
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:47,149
It is good, son.

2103
01:50:47,229 --> 01:50:48,829
That's right. Even diseases
visit us for a few days

2104
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:50,069
and go back like guests.

2105
01:50:50,872 --> 01:50:52,149
We came for a small
check-up in the hospital.

2106
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:53,029
We will go back tomorrow.

2107
01:50:53,109 --> 01:50:54,949
No, dad.
I don't mind. I was just joking.

2108
01:50:55,029 --> 01:50:55,949
This is your daughter's home.

2109
01:50:56,029 --> 01:50:56,964
Excuse me.

2110
01:50:59,158 --> 01:51:00,629
Yes, we reached.

2111
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,629
Mom, shall I make 'Coffee' for you.

2112
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:06,892
No, dear.
I'll make breakfast for your dad.

2113
01:51:07,229 --> 01:51:10,149
No, mom! Please sit. This
is your first visit to our home.

2114
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:11,549
Please don't start cooking so soon.

2115
01:51:11,629 --> 01:51:13,029
What is happening in our Vijayawada?

2116
01:51:13,109 --> 01:51:13,929
Do you watch daily soaps?

2117
01:51:13,989 --> 01:51:15,309
I don't watch daily soaps, son.

2118
01:51:15,389 --> 01:51:18,149
Oh dear! There is one
daily soap that is being aired.

2119
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:19,989
'Fake Marriage. I don't
know if you watch it

2120
01:51:20,069 --> 01:51:21,869
but my mom and
I watch it regularly.

2121
01:51:21,949 --> 01:51:24,229
What do you say, Divya?
Do you know about it? No?

2122
01:51:24,309 --> 01:51:25,309
Okay.

2123
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:27,749
Divya, I want to take bath.

2124
01:51:27,829 --> 01:51:30,389
Divya, dad can use my room.
Take mom to your room.

2125
01:51:32,949 --> 01:51:34,389
There are two bedrooms because

2126
01:51:34,589 --> 01:51:36,709
girls are every
greedy for more space

2127
01:51:36,789 --> 01:51:38,865
she filled all the cupboards
with saris and dresses.

2128
01:51:39,174 --> 01:51:40,249
Come with me, Dad.

2129
01:51:40,309 --> 01:51:41,229
Hmm.

2130
01:51:46,669 --> 01:51:48,149
Mom! Where are you going? Sit down.

2131
01:51:48,643 --> 01:51:50,629
He had diabetes.
I have to give him breakfast

2132
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:51,629
and give tablets before 9.

2133
01:51:51,709 --> 01:51:52,909
I will make breakfast
while he is taking a bath.

2134
01:51:52,989 --> 01:51:54,789
Oh dear! You don't
have to take that trouble.

2135
01:51:54,869 --> 01:51:55,869
We have a good hotel
right beside our house.

2136
01:51:55,949 --> 01:51:57,789
They make good breakfast.
I'll go bring it.

2137
01:51:57,869 --> 01:51:59,309
He doesn't like outside food, son.

2138
01:51:59,669 --> 01:52:00,949
Divya! Where is the storeroom?

2139
01:52:01,029 --> 01:52:02,115
No, mom!

2140
01:52:08,029 --> 01:52:10,149
Sorry, mom. I remembered my mom.

2141
01:52:11,229 --> 01:52:12,269
It's been four months
since I got married

2142
01:52:12,349 --> 01:52:13,589
but she didn't
come to visit me yet.

2143
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:15,349
She loves Kartik more than me.

2144
01:52:15,469 --> 01:52:17,507
He is her world. Am I not her son?

2145
01:52:20,189 --> 01:52:22,309
I have been hiding
this pain from four months.

2146
01:52:22,909 --> 01:52:25,709
But it came out after I saw you.

2147
01:52:26,189 --> 01:52:28,109
Basically I look like a normal guy.

2148
01:52:28,519 --> 01:52:31,389
But I'm too emotional.
Am I right, Divya?

2149
01:52:31,469 --> 01:52:32,789
'My foot.'

2150
01:52:32,949 --> 01:52:34,669
Mom, he will keep talking
if you stand here.

2151
01:52:34,749 --> 01:52:37,269
Come, take bath.
I will make breakfast for dad.

2152
01:52:37,349 --> 01:52:38,149
No, dear. Son in law is

2153
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:40,594
I know. Come with me. Come on.

2154
01:52:43,589 --> 01:52:45,109
Wow, I managed the
situation so beautifully.

2155
01:52:45,269 --> 01:52:47,789
If you start a MBA college,
you'll be the king there.

2156
01:52:47,869 --> 01:52:49,269
What a talent! You are a smart guy!

2157
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:51,509
Stop this extra drama
and throw her out

2158
01:52:51,589 --> 01:52:52,869
before they come out.

2159
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:54,069
How can I do that when
she is in that condition?

2160
01:52:54,269 --> 01:52:57,269
I don't care. You have
your useless friends. Call them.

2161
01:52:57,989 --> 01:52:59,509
Useless friend Abhay!

2162
01:53:04,949 --> 01:53:06,669
Singh uncle is father
in law's friend.

2163
01:53:06,749 --> 01:53:08,789
This is his son Candy.
They live in the adjacent flat.

2164
01:53:09,029 --> 01:53:10,149
Get up. Get up.

2165
01:53:11,109 --> 01:53:13,189
Do you have 'Chicken's'
in your home too?

2166
01:53:13,389 --> 01:53:14,469
We have many.

2167
01:53:14,549 --> 01:53:15,909
What do you eat?

2168
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,469
Uncle, are you Telugu or Punjabi?

2169
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:19,589
Telugu.

2170
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:21,379
Oh God!

2171
01:53:21,439 --> 01:53:24,033
‘Do you have lots of
bedrooms in your house too?’

2172
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:25,769
‘You’

2173
01:53:25,829 --> 01:53:27,669
Do you sleep in two bedrooms?

2174
01:53:27,749 --> 01:53:29,389
Like Shourya uncle

2175
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:30,949
You came?

2176
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:32,909
He comes here at this
time every day to pee.

2177
01:53:32,989 --> 01:53:34,349
This is the fashion
for kids nowadays.

2178
01:53:34,429 --> 01:53:35,749
Shall we go?

2179
01:53:36,286 --> 01:53:38,629
Bad manners. You should
pee in your own house. Go.

2180
01:53:39,629 --> 01:53:40,892
Yes. Now go.

2181
01:53:42,528 --> 01:53:44,309
He did his job. - Shourya!

2182
01:53:49,812 --> 01:53:51,149
It is amazing to have
'Coffee' here every morning.

2183
01:53:51,349 --> 01:53:52,791
This is a telescope, isn't it?

2184
01:53:53,029 --> 01:53:55,127
Yes, dad. I love astronomy.

2185
01:53:58,082 --> 01:53:59,869
Please try it. It is superb.

2186
01:54:00,309 --> 01:54:01,509
I can't see anything.

2187
01:54:01,629 --> 01:54:02,637
Turn it that side.

2188
01:54:03,789 --> 01:54:05,549
Divya, is the breakfast ready?

2189
01:54:05,629 --> 01:54:06,684
Yes.

2190
01:54:10,269 --> 01:54:12,869
Dad, turn it that side.
You will see Birla Mandir.

2191
01:54:12,949 --> 01:54:14,589
Where, son? I can't see anything.

2192
01:54:14,669 --> 01:54:16,349
Turn Right. Turn right. More right.

2193
01:54:16,429 --> 01:54:18,269
Exactly 22 degrees. There! - Where?

2194
01:54:18,349 --> 01:54:19,869
Don't turn this way. Look that way.

2195
01:54:19,949 --> 01:54:20,869
Someone is at the door.

2196
01:54:20,949 --> 01:54:21,909
The sun will come
up in five minutes.

2197
01:54:21,989 --> 01:54:22,989
You won't be able to see the God.
Keep looking.

2198
01:54:23,069 --> 01:54:23,869
I will open the door.

2199
01:54:23,949 --> 01:54:25,109
Shourya! Shourya!

2200
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:26,229
Abhay! - What happened?
Why did you call me urgently?

2201
01:54:26,309 --> 01:54:27,389
Come in. Come in.

2202
01:54:27,509 --> 01:54:29,229
Shourya!
- Thank you so much.

2203
01:54:29,309 --> 01:54:31,229
What is she doing here?
- Hey, baby! How was your night?

2204
01:54:31,309 --> 01:54:32,469
Save me. - Long night.

2205
01:54:32,549 --> 01:54:34,229
Try to understand. Save me.

2206
01:54:35,429 --> 01:54:36,869
Divya!

2207
01:54:38,989 --> 01:54:41,349
I don't think the
temple is this side. Son!

2208
01:54:41,429 --> 01:54:43,122
Vaidu, my friend Abhay.

2209
01:54:44,029 --> 01:54:45,149
Why did you close
the door like that?

2210
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:46,749
I was actually going
to open that door.

2211
01:54:46,869 --> 01:54:50,149
Take her away.
Please take her away. We are caught.

2212
01:54:52,072 --> 01:54:53,389
Dad! Mom! Abhay!

2213
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:54,789
Abhay! Mom! Dad!

2214
01:54:54,869 --> 01:54:56,669
Divya! Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Divya!

2215
01:54:56,789 --> 01:54:58,829
You met them. Okay?
Done? Bye! - Who is this new girl?

2216
01:54:58,909 --> 01:54:59,709
Hello, everybody!

2217
01:54:59,789 --> 01:55:00,789
You can meet them later.
Come for dinner.

2218
01:55:00,869 --> 01:55:01,669
Who are you sending me with? - Bye!

2219
01:55:01,749 --> 01:55:02,909
Love you. Take care.

2220
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:04,669
I beg of you. Drop her at home.

2221
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:06,675
Oh God! Oh God!

2222
01:55:06,909 --> 01:55:09,029
Why did you send them away?
- They talk too much, mom.

2223
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:10,869
They are like Fevicol.
They will get stuck here.

2224
01:55:10,949 --> 01:55:11,909
They will not leave at all.

2225
01:55:12,669 --> 01:55:14,792
We have a lot of work.
Am I right, Divya?

2226
01:55:32,497 --> 01:55:34,707
Shourya! Dad! Dinner ready.

2227
01:55:35,309 --> 01:55:36,718
Dad! - Yes? - Just wait.

2228
01:55:37,909 --> 01:55:38,989
What did you say?

2229
01:55:39,869 --> 01:55:40,909
What did I say?

2230
01:55:40,989 --> 01:55:42,269
Should I come and eat
as soon as you call me?

2231
01:55:42,549 --> 01:55:43,829
Should I sit when you say,
Shourya sit

2232
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:45,229
or stand and wait for your orders?

2233
01:55:45,669 --> 01:55:46,709
What happened now?

2234
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:49,509
Why do ladies dominate
us like this, dad?

2235
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:51,229
You pampered her too much.

2236
01:55:52,029 --> 01:55:55,069
What will be left of our
honor if you cook and serve daily?

2237
01:55:56,109 --> 01:55:57,072
Answer me.

2238
01:55:58,629 --> 01:56:00,829
We have small desires
and tastes of our own.

2239
01:56:00,909 --> 01:56:01,989
Tell her, dad.

2240
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:03,109
What should I say, son?

2241
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:06,069
Why be scared, dad?
Let's say it bravely and openly.

2242
01:56:06,389 --> 01:56:07,309
I'm here with you.

2243
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,389
Look, I'm not a good
person like you all

2244
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:12,309
to sit and eat
whenever you ask me to.

2245
01:56:12,509 --> 01:56:13,789
All the rules will
be changed from today.

2246
01:56:14,234 --> 01:56:16,869
We both will serve you
food and you two have to eat.

2247
01:56:16,949 --> 01:56:17,837
Hmm?

2248
01:56:18,709 --> 01:56:19,714
Come, dad.

2249
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:21,509
Mom, sit down.

2250
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:24,112
Divya, sit. Sit.

2251
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:29,924
Dad, don't be scared.
Serve food to mom. Do it, dad.

2252
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:31,029
Hmm.

2253
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:33,112
Don't stop even if she says no.
Serve the food.

2254
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:37,265
Eat. Hmm?

2255
01:56:47,749 --> 01:56:48,789
Enough, son.

2256
01:56:52,949 --> 01:56:53,989
Eat this poppadum.

2257
01:57:13,029 --> 01:57:16,109
We got confused after
seeing his confusion.

2258
01:57:16,509 --> 01:57:17,589
In my whole life

2259
01:57:17,829 --> 01:57:19,389
This is the first time I've
seen him laughing like this

2260
01:57:19,709 --> 01:57:21,798
in 25 years of our marriage.

2261
01:57:22,949 --> 01:57:25,029
God granted you a husband
who is 100 times better

2262
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:27,469
than the one I wanted for you.

2263
01:57:36,829 --> 01:57:40,305
Good entertainment
for the whole family.

2264
01:57:43,869 --> 01:57:47,149
Listen, I packed everything.
You said we'll leave by 9.

2265
01:57:47,229 --> 01:57:49,589
Is it 9 already?
Oh, I didn't realize it.

2266
01:57:49,752 --> 01:57:52,109
Ask son in law about Divya

2267
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:53,189
I forgot.

2268
01:57:53,269 --> 01:57:55,949
Next month we have
Divya's cousin's wedding

2269
01:57:56,149 --> 01:57:57,146
in Vijayawada.

2270
01:57:57,429 --> 01:57:59,589
Since she has holidays now

2271
01:58:00,033 --> 01:58:02,109
we will take her along
so that she can meet everyone.

2272
01:58:02,189 --> 01:58:03,709
Sure. Divya is your daughter.

2273
01:58:03,789 --> 01:58:05,009
You can take her whenever you want.

2274
01:58:05,469 --> 01:58:07,237
Okay, Divya?
Go and have a good time.

2275
01:58:09,269 --> 01:58:10,269
I will call you once I reach.

2276
01:58:10,349 --> 01:58:12,429
Divya, did you tell uncle
that we will reach by 1?

2277
01:58:12,509 --> 01:58:13,389
Yes, I told him.

2278
01:58:13,469 --> 01:58:15,516
Did we keep everything?
Divya, the bottles

2279
01:58:16,069 --> 01:58:16,949
What bottles?

2280
01:58:17,077 --> 01:58:21,074
I mean I asked if you
kept water bottles in the car.

2281
01:58:21,441 --> 01:58:22,389
Yes, I kept them.

2282
01:58:22,575 --> 01:58:23,989
'Thank God she kept them.'

2283
01:58:24,962 --> 01:58:26,749
Shall we go? - See you later, son.

2284
01:58:26,829 --> 01:58:27,869
Okay, dad.

2285
01:58:28,509 --> 01:58:29,409
Divya!

2286
01:58:29,749 --> 01:58:30,728
Yes? What?

2287
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:52,029
I didn't find the 'Beer' bottles.
Where did you hide them?

2288
01:58:54,749 --> 01:58:56,438
In the bathroom cabinet.

2289
01:58:57,469 --> 01:59:00,989
Darling, that is a superb idea.
That's why I love you.

2290
01:59:01,069 --> 01:59:02,429
Be happy and enjoy yourself.

2291
01:59:03,829 --> 01:59:05,538
Divya, call me once you reach.

2292
01:59:08,989 --> 01:59:12,709
Mom, send her soon.
I can't do without her.

2293
01:59:14,269 --> 01:59:15,950
Bye, Divya. - Okay.

2294
01:59:25,589 --> 01:59:26,839
Bye, darling!

2295
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:31,587
Yes!

2296
01:59:44,229 --> 01:59:46,029
Don't put the 'Juice' bottle
in your mouth directly.

2297
01:59:46,249 --> 01:59:47,789
Pour it in a glass and
drink it like a human being.

2298
01:59:48,898 --> 01:59:50,967
Your Aunt should've
been a teacher, not a doctor.

2299
01:59:52,044 --> 01:59:55,332
All her anger is just for show,
she is soft inside.

2300
01:59:56,024 --> 01:59:58,389
She acts like Gabbar
Singh before everyone

2301
01:59:58,469 --> 02:00:00,668
but she becomes a
lamb in front of her dad.

2302
02:00:03,614 --> 02:00:04,869
I know what you are thinking.

2303
02:00:05,069 --> 02:00:07,429
No, no, no, I'm not missing Divya.

2304
02:00:08,549 --> 02:00:09,909
I don't have diseases
like emotional attachments

2305
02:00:09,989 --> 02:00:12,273
and missing people.
I will never have them.

2306
02:00:13,149 --> 02:00:14,309
I just got used to her. That's it.

2307
02:00:15,229 --> 02:00:17,509
It's a habit.
Habits come and go. That's it.

2308
02:00:19,509 --> 02:00:22,476
Cheers! Cheers! - Woohoo!

2309
02:00:23,069 --> 02:00:25,349
After a month,
you guys will miss me very much.

2310
02:00:25,429 --> 02:00:26,749
I wonder how you will live.

2311
02:00:26,989 --> 02:00:28,025
How?

2312
02:00:28,389 --> 02:00:30,189
How do you guys bear him?

2313
02:00:30,379 --> 02:00:31,589
When you have a big gutter
flowing beside your house

2314
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:33,829
you slowly get used to the stink.
It's the same with him.

2315
02:00:34,309 --> 02:00:35,429
Right.

2316
02:00:36,109 --> 02:00:37,309
Crap! Call from US.

2317
02:00:37,469 --> 02:00:38,215
Hello?

2318
02:00:38,669 --> 02:00:39,909
Yeah, John. What?

2319
02:00:40,109 --> 02:00:41,629
That's That's awesome news.

2320
02:00:41,829 --> 02:00:43,029
Thank you. Yeah, I'll be there.

2321
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:44,269
Sure. Thank you.

2322
02:00:44,469 --> 02:00:45,709
Yes! Hello, New York!

2323
02:00:45,789 --> 02:00:48,076
What? It's a million
dollar contract.

2324
02:00:48,668 --> 02:00:49,909
What superb news!

2325
02:00:49,989 --> 02:00:52,549
Wait, Divya will be so
happy when I tell her this.

2326
02:00:54,029 --> 02:00:55,955
I like this.
- Where did you go? - Send me, okay?

2327
02:00:56,909 --> 02:00:58,200
Boys, one more. - Yeah.

2328
02:00:58,669 --> 02:01:00,549
What happened?
Everything okay? Why are you tense?

2329
02:01:00,789 --> 02:01:02,496
Nothing.
My US contract has been approved.

2330
02:01:02,556 --> 02:01:03,309
What? - Wow!

2331
02:01:03,389 --> 02:01:04,749
The US contract has
been approved? - Hmm.

2332
02:01:04,829 --> 02:01:07,709
Why are you saying it so
casually? Celebration! Woohoo!

2333
02:01:07,789 --> 02:01:09,509
Whoa! Bro, I'm happy for you.

2334
02:01:09,589 --> 02:01:11,429
Okay, calm down. - Celebrations!

2335
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:14,949
Divya

2336
02:01:15,469 --> 02:01:16,309
Calling Divya?

2337
02:01:16,389 --> 02:01:18,309
Yeah. She told me two days back

2338
02:01:18,516 --> 02:01:19,869
that I'll get
confirmation this month.

2339
02:01:20,069 --> 02:01:22,309
Did you call your parents?
- No, I'll call them later.

2340
02:01:23,269 --> 02:01:25,266
Divya should've reached
Vijayawada by now.

2341
02:01:25,469 --> 02:01:26,949
Why is her phone not reachable?

2342
02:01:27,149 --> 02:01:30,589
So, you didn't share this
big news with your parents first.

2343
02:01:30,789 --> 02:01:32,029
You didn't share it
with your close friends.

2344
02:01:32,469 --> 02:01:33,509
You didn't tell me.

2345
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:35,429
When you wanted to
share the good news

2346
02:01:35,509 --> 02:01:36,749
that you have been
waiting to hear for so long

2347
02:01:36,829 --> 02:01:38,608
the first person you
thought about was Divya.

2348
02:01:39,629 --> 02:01:41,709
Find out what's in your heart,
Shourya.

2349
02:01:42,069 --> 02:01:43,589
I feel it is time for you to think.

2350
02:01:47,309 --> 02:01:48,305
Take care.

2351
02:01:50,149 --> 02:01:50,992
Bye.

2352
02:03:44,455 --> 02:03:45,509
Hello!

2353
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:47,269
What?

2354
02:04:24,029 --> 02:04:24,909
Are you okay?

2355
02:04:25,189 --> 02:04:26,624
Sister!

2356
02:04:31,062 --> 02:04:32,948
She’s no more.

2357
02:05:07,066 --> 02:05:08,829
She died with a satisfied heart.

2358
02:05:09,829 --> 02:05:10,989
She saw your wedding.

2359
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:14,149
She met Divya who
loves us all so much.

2360
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:16,652
She died in peace.

2361
02:05:19,549 --> 02:05:21,629
I never thought that
you will become so mature.

2362
02:05:23,509 --> 02:05:24,708
It is all because of Divya.

2363
02:05:26,469 --> 02:05:29,429
You rejected the proposal
at first but accepted it later.

2364
02:05:29,909 --> 02:05:31,229
That's destiny.

2365
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:34,029
Very few men are so lucky in life.

2366
02:05:34,549 --> 02:05:35,829
Don't lose it.

2367
02:06:05,837 --> 02:06:06,938
Dad!

2368
02:06:12,838 --> 02:06:14,509
Brother! What's wrong?

2369
02:06:14,669 --> 02:06:15,749
What's wrong?

2370
02:06:16,349 --> 02:06:18,349
See what they are showing
on TV since an hour.

2371
02:06:18,749 --> 02:06:20,269
There was a time when
they used to celebrate

2372
02:06:20,349 --> 02:06:21,469
when a wedding was fixed.

2373
02:06:21,629 --> 02:06:23,389
But now they are celebrating
the breaking of a marriage

2374
02:06:23,469 --> 02:06:25,389
and the taking of a divorce.

2375
02:06:25,709 --> 02:06:28,589
Brain Halls from Australia
has posted a video on Facebook

2376
02:06:28,669 --> 02:06:31,509
about an Indian couple
and it has gone viral on internet.

2377
02:06:31,589 --> 02:06:34,069
Celebrating our divorce, my friend.

2378
02:06:34,349 --> 02:06:36,469
This is the latest fashion in India.

2379
02:06:36,549 --> 02:06:38,909
She is my wife.
Oh sorry, my ex-wife Divya.

2380
02:06:38,989 --> 02:06:42,149
And he is my XYZ Shourya.

2381
02:06:42,669 --> 02:06:44,109
Serves them right for
asking us to get married.

2382
02:06:44,869 --> 02:06:46,429
We have to get married
and give birth to children.

2383
02:06:46,509 --> 02:06:48,229
Which convent is
your child studying in?

2384
02:06:48,429 --> 02:06:49,709
How much fees did you pay?

2385
02:06:49,789 --> 02:06:52,389
Will they give discounts
if you have Aadhar Card?

2386
02:06:52,669 --> 02:06:56,149
They want us to live in
slow motion with all such rubbish.

2387
02:06:56,509 --> 02:06:57,309
Dad, actually

2388
02:06:57,389 --> 02:07:00,309
I will kill you. I will
kill you if you say another word.

2389
02:07:00,669 --> 02:07:02,074
Do we look like fools to you?

2390
02:07:02,349 --> 02:07:04,509
Who gave you the right
to disgrace us publicly?

2391
02:07:04,589 --> 02:07:05,589
Who gave you the right?

2392
02:07:06,749 --> 02:07:09,469
You'll get married for
us and separate for yourselves?

2393
02:07:09,549 --> 02:07:11,789
After that?
Who will you live for after that?

2394
02:07:11,869 --> 02:07:12,949
Who will you live with?

2395
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:17,349
On the wedding invitations
we print your names

2396
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:19,469
along with parents'
names and addresses

2397
02:07:19,709 --> 02:07:22,189
and also the best wishes
of all the relatives in the end.

2398
02:07:22,269 --> 02:07:23,469
Do you what that means?

2399
02:07:25,829 --> 02:07:28,429
Our families are following
the tradition of marriage

2400
02:07:28,509 --> 02:07:30,469
trusting that our
children will respect it.

2401
02:07:30,549 --> 02:07:32,189
So, please come and shower
them with your blessings.

2402
02:07:32,269 --> 02:07:34,789
Give them place as a
wedded couple in the society.

2403
02:07:34,869 --> 02:07:36,549
They will continue to uphold
our honor and reputation.

2404
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:37,669
This is what it means.

2405
02:07:37,869 --> 02:07:39,189
But what did you do?

2406
02:07:40,509 --> 02:07:42,789
You didn't get married
to do us a favor.

2407
02:07:42,989 --> 02:07:44,949
You did it to give
meaning to your own lives.

2408
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:47,189
If everybody starts
thinking like you

2409
02:07:47,389 --> 02:07:49,229
marriage will become
a ghost very soon.

2410
02:07:51,909 --> 02:07:53,912
Today I lost everything
that I earned in the

2411
02:07:54,549 --> 02:07:57,669
past 45 years of my life.

2412
02:08:02,549 --> 02:08:06,229
My daughter is equally
to be blamed for this.

2413
02:08:06,829 --> 02:08:08,869
That's why I'm sparing you.

2414
02:09:23,070 --> 02:09:24,429
The divorce is granted.

2415
02:10:02,109 --> 02:10:03,784
Here are the divorce papers.

2416
02:10:04,652 --> 02:10:06,861
Your daughter will get
married in Hyderabad next week.

2417
02:10:12,309 --> 02:10:13,829
I heard that you
decided to go to US.

2418
02:10:14,689 --> 02:10:15,709
Mom told me.

2419
02:10:17,269 --> 02:10:18,149
All the best.

2420
02:10:19,509 --> 02:10:21,058
I didn't want to hurt anyone, dad.

2421
02:10:21,829 --> 02:10:22,735
I'm telling the truth.

2422
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:25,943
But this is my fault.
I'm responsible for this.

2423
02:10:28,789 --> 02:10:30,189
At least half of the
mistakes we do in life

2424
02:10:30,269 --> 02:10:31,910
are not done to hurt others,
Shourya.

2425
02:10:33,589 --> 02:10:36,016
We just do what we feel
is right in that moment.

2426
02:10:39,185 --> 02:10:41,589
We don't have the desire
or the discernment

2427
02:10:41,669 --> 02:10:43,116
to understand what
that will result in.

2428
02:10:44,429 --> 02:10:46,120
The marriage may
have been a lie to you.

2429
02:10:47,143 --> 02:10:49,269
But the time that you both
have spent together is true.

2430
02:10:50,269 --> 02:10:52,029
The love and affection
that you shared

2431
02:10:52,109 --> 02:10:53,243
with our families is true.

2432
02:10:54,269 --> 02:10:56,590
The friendship between
you and Divya is true.

2433
02:10:57,909 --> 02:11:00,168
It is true that you
are in love with her.

2434
02:11:01,709 --> 02:11:03,589
You don't have to tell me,
I can see it in your eyes.

2435
02:11:07,269 --> 02:11:09,709
You feel that marriage
is a burdensome responsibility.

2436
02:11:09,789 --> 02:11:11,069
Do you know what
you need to understand?

2437
02:11:12,509 --> 02:11:13,789
Friendship is more
important in a marriage

2438
02:11:13,869 --> 02:11:15,309
than love and responsibility.

2439
02:11:17,389 --> 02:11:19,526
Anything can change
but not friendship.

2440
02:11:21,949 --> 02:11:23,824
Friendship is what
you both have achieved

2441
02:11:24,309 --> 02:11:25,469
by rejection your marriage.

2442
02:11:27,029 --> 02:11:28,806
Anyway, good luck, son.

2443
02:11:33,222 --> 02:11:34,829
Will your problems be
solved if you leave everyone

2444
02:11:34,909 --> 02:11:36,309
and run away to US?

2445
02:11:37,949 --> 02:11:39,330
Can you forget Divya?

2446
02:11:40,909 --> 02:11:42,470
Her wedding is happening
in Hyderabad today.

2447
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:46,017
Think about it for a second.

2448
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:50,309
If you talk to Divya once,
I'm sure

2449
02:11:50,389 --> 02:11:51,246
What should I say to her?

2450
02:11:53,869 --> 02:11:57,669
How should I face Divya?
Tell me. I will go.

2451
02:11:58,029 --> 02:11:59,469
Divya, please trust me again.
Come, let's elope.

2452
02:11:59,869 --> 02:12:00,989
Is that what I should say?

2453
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:05,469
I constantly asked
Divya to trust me

2454
02:12:05,949 --> 02:12:07,349
but I ruined her
life with my stupid ideas.

2455
02:12:09,330 --> 02:12:13,693
I hurt my parents,
Divya's parents and everyone else.

2456
02:12:17,309 --> 02:12:18,429
I didn't listen to anyone.

2457
02:12:19,629 --> 02:12:20,669
I didn't think at all.

2458
02:12:22,013 --> 02:12:23,389
I just did what I wanted to.

2459
02:12:28,629 --> 02:12:29,669
No more.

2460
02:12:31,717 --> 02:12:32,870
It is right for me to leave.

2461
02:13:06,629 --> 02:13:08,210
Stop near the ATM. - Okay, sir.

2462
02:13:12,669 --> 02:13:14,109
Sorry, sir. Out of service.

2463
02:13:14,189 --> 02:13:15,869
There's another ATM
on the third floor.

2464
02:13:34,469 --> 02:13:35,469
Who are you?

2465
02:13:35,549 --> 02:13:37,709
Give me your phone. - One minute.

2466
02:13:37,869 --> 02:13:40,029
Do you know what is happening?

2467
02:13:40,109 --> 02:13:40,989
How did I come here?

2468
02:13:41,069 --> 02:13:42,869
Hey! The gun is in my hand.

2469
02:13:42,949 --> 02:13:44,349
Why are you asking the questions?

2470
02:13:44,429 --> 02:13:45,429
Didn't you study science?

2471
02:13:45,509 --> 02:13:48,749
Brother, you are cute.
Don't be scared of the gun.

2472
02:13:48,967 --> 02:13:51,029
I'm not a villain.
I'm a real gentleman.

2473
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:54,869
She will get married again.
Do you know that?

2474
02:13:54,989 --> 02:13:57,469
How does he know that
Divya is getting married again?

2475
02:13:57,549 --> 02:13:58,789
You also know?

2476
02:13:58,949 --> 02:14:00,629
Does that mean that
she tells it to everyone?

2477
02:14:00,789 --> 02:14:01,789
That's why I'm leaving for US.

2478
02:14:01,869 --> 02:14:04,709
Huh? Why are you going away to US

2479
02:14:04,789 --> 02:14:05,869
when my wife is getting married?

2480
02:14:05,949 --> 02:14:07,749
Your wife? - Your wife?

2481
02:14:08,029 --> 02:14:10,189
Oh God! Not now. We are divorced.

2482
02:14:10,429 --> 02:14:12,189
My wife divorced you too?

2483
02:14:12,269 --> 02:14:13,909
Why will your wife divorce me?
My wife divorced me.

2484
02:14:13,989 --> 02:14:14,949
I mean our

2485
02:14:15,029 --> 02:14:17,029
Brother, don't confuse me. Clarity.

2486
02:14:17,239 --> 02:14:19,269
Our wife - What our wife?

2487
02:14:19,949 --> 02:14:21,069
I will miss my flight.

2488
02:14:21,149 --> 02:14:23,309
You will just miss a flight.
I'm going to die.

2489
02:14:23,429 --> 02:14:24,869
I'm here to commit suicide.

2490
02:14:24,949 --> 02:14:26,229
Suicide? - Yes.

2491
02:14:26,429 --> 02:14:28,309
Our wife divorced you
without divorcing me and

2492
02:14:28,389 --> 02:14:30,749
now she is marrying another man.

2493
02:14:30,829 --> 02:14:32,269
Let's commit suicide together.

2494
02:14:32,349 --> 02:14:35,109
Let's tell our family
story to this world and die.

2495
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:37,109
You kill me and I will kill you.

2496
02:14:37,189 --> 02:14:39,749
But we have only one gun.

2497
02:14:39,829 --> 02:14:42,149
How?
- Brother, you are very confused.

2498
02:14:42,469 --> 02:14:44,309
No, you are confused.

2499
02:14:44,389 --> 02:14:46,869
She ditched both of us, brother.

2500
02:14:47,149 --> 02:14:48,629
Brother,
don't talk about Divya like that.

2501
02:14:48,709 --> 02:14:49,989
Why will Divya marry you?

2502
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:51,989
Who is Divya?

2503
02:14:57,989 --> 02:14:59,349
My wife is marrying another man.

2504
02:14:59,429 --> 02:15:00,909
Similarly, your wife
is marrying another man too.

2505
02:15:00,989 --> 02:15:03,669
Is that it? - Is your wife
getting married to the same man?

2506
02:15:03,749 --> 02:15:05,109
She is marrying someone else.

2507
02:15:05,429 --> 02:15:07,389
And you are still alive?
- What else should I do?

2508
02:15:07,469 --> 02:15:09,069
Shame on you.
Let's jump down and die.

2509
02:15:09,149 --> 02:15:11,269
I forgot an important thing.
Make a call urgently.

2510
02:15:11,349 --> 02:15:12,509
Call who? - The media.

2511
02:15:13,189 --> 02:15:15,229
The media will tell the
whole world and my wife

2512
02:15:15,309 --> 02:15:16,709
about our suicide.

2513
02:15:16,789 --> 02:15:19,189
Brother, I have had a few drinks.

2514
02:15:19,269 --> 02:15:21,749
Nobody will believe me,
so I brought you here.

2515
02:15:21,829 --> 02:15:23,751
Come on, call up the media urgently.

2516
02:15:24,429 --> 02:15:26,989
How can you do that?
What should I do now?

2517
02:15:28,309 --> 02:15:29,949
Wait, hold the line.
I will tell you.

2518
02:15:30,709 --> 02:15:32,029
Hello! - Hello! Is it N TV?

2519
02:15:32,109 --> 02:15:33,669
Yes, tell me.
- Sir, there's a man here.

2520
02:15:33,749 --> 02:15:35,309
It seems his wife
is marrying someone else.

2521
02:15:35,389 --> 02:15:36,825
He came here to commit suicide.

2522
02:15:37,069 --> 02:15:39,329
He unnecessarily kidnapped
me and brought me here.

2523
02:15:39,909 --> 02:15:41,856
The gun. - He has a gun too, sir.

2524
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:43,469
Suicide? What is his name?

2525
02:15:43,629 --> 02:15:45,469
What is your name?
- Gautam, software.

2526
02:15:45,549 --> 02:15:47,309
His name is Gautam, sir.
- What is your name?

2527
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:48,629
Sir, my name is Shourya.

2528
02:15:48,709 --> 02:15:49,509
Area?

2529
02:15:49,589 --> 02:15:51,869
At Madhapur, sir.
On the terrace of Teja Towers.

2530
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,989
Naveen! - Yes, sir?

2531
02:15:53,069 --> 02:15:54,909
Suicide case.
Go get a live covering. - Okay, sir.

2532
02:15:56,349 --> 02:15:57,309
Got it? - Sir.

2533
02:15:57,589 --> 02:15:59,669
I will kill you if you
ask stupid doubts. Write it down.

2534
02:15:59,749 --> 02:16:02,709
Fresh news!
A software engineer called Shourya

2535
02:16:02,789 --> 02:16:04,269
is committing suicide.

2536
02:16:04,549 --> 02:16:06,869
We heard that he kidnapped
another software engineer

2537
02:16:06,949 --> 02:16:09,589
named Gautam at gunpoint.

2538
02:16:09,949 --> 02:16:12,509
We still don't know
what his demands are.

2539
02:16:12,589 --> 02:16:14,589
Nobody listened to me when
I said we'll go to the airport.

2540
02:16:14,669 --> 02:16:15,909
Now call Divya.

2541
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:20,575
Hello!
- Shourya is committing suicide.

2542
02:16:21,749 --> 02:16:23,349
He climbed a building
to commit suicide

2543
02:16:23,429 --> 02:16:24,789
because you are
getting married again.

2544
02:16:24,869 --> 02:16:25,869
What?

2545
02:16:26,669 --> 02:16:28,629
Leave immediately and come here.

2546
02:16:30,189 --> 02:16:32,189
Please ask him to stop
these dramas and plots.

2547
02:16:32,309 --> 02:16:35,029
You mental girl!
It is coming live on TV. Watch it.

2548
02:16:35,189 --> 02:16:37,538
I don't care. Please leave me alone.

2549
02:16:43,309 --> 02:16:44,189
Oh God!

2550
02:16:44,269 --> 02:16:45,847
Take us to the Registrar's office.

2551
02:17:10,349 --> 02:17:11,989
Hello! - Hello, sir! How are you?

2552
02:17:12,069 --> 02:17:13,909
I'm fine.
- Is Mr. Rao inside? - Yes.

2553
02:17:14,069 --> 02:17:16,549
Divya! Shourya is really
committing suicide for you.

2554
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:18,389
Please trust me. Honestly.

2555
02:17:28,789 --> 02:17:29,944
Don't think about it, Divya.

2556
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,069
We don't have the heart
to give you that freedom.

2557
02:17:37,149 --> 02:17:39,756
We can never agree that
a girl knows everything

2558
02:17:40,269 --> 02:17:41,516
even if she is a grown up.

2559
02:17:43,909 --> 02:17:45,171
We've the courage to
point out your mistakes

2560
02:17:46,269 --> 02:17:50,589
but we don't have the
courage to accept our own.

2561
02:17:51,829 --> 02:17:55,627
So I'm making this decision for you.

2562
02:17:57,469 --> 02:17:58,509
Go.

2563
02:18:00,269 --> 02:18:01,949
I have total confidence
in the way I raised you.

2564
02:18:02,509 --> 02:18:04,229
You will see me dead
if you climb another step.

2565
02:18:05,785 --> 02:18:06,909
Go.

2566
02:18:13,229 --> 02:18:14,349
Go.

2567
02:18:15,709 --> 02:18:18,883
Come on, quick.
Get in quickly. - Come on, let's go.

2568
02:18:29,829 --> 02:18:31,189
Hello, Suman! Can you hear me?

2569
02:18:31,589 --> 02:18:34,269
Hello! How long will it take
for the extra force to come in?

2570
02:18:37,709 --> 02:18:38,509
Shourya!

2571
02:18:38,589 --> 02:18:39,869
It is becoming difficult
to control the crowd. - Stop it!

2572
02:18:39,949 --> 02:18:41,229
Quick! Send them quickly, sir!

2573
02:18:41,309 --> 02:18:42,389
Shourya! - Okay, sir.

2574
02:18:42,469 --> 02:18:43,269
Shourya! - Come fast.

2575
02:18:43,349 --> 02:18:44,549
Shourya! Shourya!

2576
02:18:44,629 --> 02:18:45,869
Who are you? - Sir, I'm Divya.

2577
02:18:45,949 --> 02:18:47,469
What? - Shourya is
committing suicide for me.

2578
02:18:47,549 --> 02:18:48,645
Shourya?

2579
02:18:49,269 --> 02:18:50,069
Hello? - Hello!

2580
02:18:50,149 --> 02:18:51,589
I'm the SI. I'm speaking
from downstairs. - Shourya!

2581
02:18:51,669 --> 02:18:52,669
Your wife is here. - Shourya!

2582
02:18:52,749 --> 02:18:54,069
It seems your wife is here.
- Oh, yes.

2583
02:18:54,469 --> 02:18:55,429
Talk to her.

2584
02:18:55,629 --> 02:18:57,029
Here, talk to him. - Hello!

2585
02:18:57,309 --> 02:18:58,909
Hello? - Are you mad?

2586
02:18:58,989 --> 02:19:00,629
Yes, I'm mental, I'm crazy.

2587
02:19:00,785 --> 02:19:02,429
Any man will become
crazy after marrying you

2588
02:19:02,509 --> 02:19:03,629
he won't become a scientist.

2589
02:19:03,709 --> 02:19:04,509
Are you drunk?

2590
02:19:04,589 --> 02:19:06,469
I'm drunk. I will drink until I die.

2591
02:19:06,549 --> 02:19:07,349
Please come down.

2592
02:19:07,429 --> 02:19:09,549
There is no chance
of that happening.

2593
02:19:09,629 --> 02:19:10,509
Shourya, no!

2594
02:19:10,589 --> 02:19:12,389
Go ahead and get married.

2595
02:19:12,549 --> 02:19:15,349
Just remember that
I'm dying for you.

2596
02:19:15,429 --> 02:19:17,349
Listen to me. I didn't get married.

2597
02:19:17,429 --> 02:19:19,794
Come down. - I already decided.

2598
02:19:20,189 --> 02:19:23,309
The media,
the audience and brother

2599
02:19:23,497 --> 02:19:25,389
will be disappointed if
I don't commit suicide, you know.

2600
02:19:25,469 --> 02:19:26,989
Please I have to talk to you,
Shourya.

2601
02:19:27,069 --> 02:19:28,771
Shourya? Oh, brother.

2602
02:19:29,789 --> 02:19:30,669
Sir, please talk to him.

2603
02:19:30,749 --> 02:19:31,909
Your sister in law
wants to talk to you

2604
02:19:31,989 --> 02:19:34,229
give me if she takes
my name again. - Hello?

2605
02:19:34,309 --> 02:19:35,509
Will you commit suicide

2606
02:19:35,589 --> 02:19:36,529
even after your
wife begged you not to?

2607
02:19:36,589 --> 02:19:38,429
Sir, I'm not committing suicide.
It is the other man.

2608
02:19:38,509 --> 02:19:39,309
Yes, me.

2609
02:19:39,389 --> 02:19:41,309
Why did you take the phone?
Give it to him.

2610
02:19:41,389 --> 02:19:42,509
He wants to talk to you.

2611
02:19:43,389 --> 02:19:45,289
Hello? - Your wife is crying here.

2612
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:47,189
Sir, I believed her tears
and got married to her

2613
02:19:47,269 --> 02:19:49,229
and I'm still crying
because of that decision.

2614
02:19:49,309 --> 02:19:50,749
Oh God! He is not listening to me.
You convince him.

2615
02:19:50,829 --> 02:19:53,549
Hello! - What hello?
I've had enough. Go.

2616
02:19:53,629 --> 02:19:54,869
Listen to me please. My wedding.

2617
02:19:54,949 --> 02:19:57,129
Go and marry that buffoon.

2618
02:19:57,189 --> 02:19:59,044
Did you see my situation,
brother? Goodbye.

2619
02:19:59,509 --> 02:20:00,309
Shourya

2620
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:01,189
He cut the call, sir.

2621
02:20:01,269 --> 02:20:02,909
Go to the terrace
of the adjacent building.

2622
02:20:02,989 --> 02:20:04,349
Maybe he will change
his mind after seeing you.

2623
02:20:04,429 --> 02:20:05,349
Stand back. Stand back.

2624
02:20:05,429 --> 02:20:07,109
Okay, brother.
My job is done. I'm going.

2625
02:20:07,189 --> 02:20:10,049
Hey! You can't go
down until I go up.

2626
02:20:10,109 --> 02:20:12,109
Okay, I will die right now. - Stop.

2627
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:14,029
Why do you love me so much?

2628
02:20:14,109 --> 02:20:15,469
I'm going to die anyway.

2629
02:20:15,549 --> 02:20:18,789
Use my credit cards and my money.
Spend it all.

2630
02:20:18,869 --> 02:20:20,029
Shourya! Shourya!

2631
02:20:20,109 --> 02:20:21,429
You don't have to pay the interest.

2632
02:20:21,909 --> 02:20:22,949
Divya, what are you doing here?

2633
02:20:23,029 --> 02:20:25,149
Will you kill yourself if
I marry another man? Are you mad?

2634
02:20:25,229 --> 02:20:27,069
No, I'm not dying.
He is killing himself.

2635
02:20:27,149 --> 02:20:28,309
Yes, me. - What?

2636
02:20:28,389 --> 02:20:29,289
Gautam, software.

2637
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:30,549
Why did you say that on the phone?

2638
02:20:30,629 --> 02:20:31,989
Oh! Was it you on the phone?

2639
02:20:32,069 --> 02:20:34,069
Wasn't it Saroja on the phone?
- Gautam.

2640
02:20:34,311 --> 02:20:36,149
Software, it's me.
- What is this confusion?

2641
02:20:36,229 --> 02:20:38,229
His wife is marrying
someone else like you.

2642
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:39,749
That's why he came
here to commit suicide.

2643
02:20:39,989 --> 02:20:41,949
I was leaving for US but
he kidnapped me on the way.

2644
02:20:42,029 --> 02:20:43,829
But you thought I was going to die.
That's it.

2645
02:20:44,389 --> 02:20:46,229
Were you running to US
because I was getting married?

2646
02:20:46,309 --> 02:20:47,229
I mean - You!

2647
02:20:47,309 --> 02:20:48,549
What is she searching for, brother?

2648
02:20:48,629 --> 02:20:49,749
Oh no, a stone.

2649
02:20:49,989 --> 02:20:51,309
The gap is too much to jump there.

2650
02:20:51,389 --> 02:20:52,429
Otherwise I would've
come there to push you.

2651
02:20:52,509 --> 02:20:53,309
What did I do?

2652
02:20:53,389 --> 02:20:54,969
He is better than you.
He is committing suicide

2653
02:20:55,029 --> 02:20:56,269
because his wife
is marrying someone else.

2654
02:20:56,349 --> 02:20:57,909
But you just scolded him
for trying to commit suicide.

2655
02:20:57,989 --> 02:20:58,829
Why are you supporting him now?

2656
02:20:58,909 --> 02:20:59,749
That's how ladies are, brother.

2657
02:20:59,829 --> 02:21:01,549
They get confused
and confuse us too.

2658
02:21:01,629 --> 02:21:03,070
Divya! - What?

2659
02:21:03,309 --> 02:21:04,949
I came to a decision.

2660
02:21:05,029 --> 02:21:07,829
You regret marrying this buffoon.

2661
02:21:07,909 --> 02:21:11,029
And I regret marrying
that useless woman.

2662
02:21:11,189 --> 02:21:14,909
Same situation.
Same feel. Same love. Same climax.

2663
02:21:14,989 --> 02:21:16,309
Let's ditch both of them

2664
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:19,549
and we both can get married
if you say okay. What do you say?

2665
02:21:19,629 --> 02:21:21,189
Hey! I will smash your head.

2666
02:21:21,269 --> 02:21:22,509
Why will you beat him up?

2667
02:21:23,269 --> 02:21:25,789
Wow! Divya darling
is already supporting me.

2668
02:21:26,029 --> 02:21:27,549
Nobody knows when
and where love starts.

2669
02:21:27,629 --> 02:21:29,589
I will stab you in the
ribs if you call this love.

2670
02:21:30,109 --> 02:21:31,269
Reverse again.

2671
02:21:31,349 --> 02:21:33,429
Did you see that, brother? We
can't trust women. Come, let's die.

2672
02:21:33,509 --> 02:21:35,549
Wait a minute.
I need to talk to Divya.

2673
02:21:35,629 --> 02:21:36,509
I'll be happy if
I can convince her

2674
02:21:36,589 --> 02:21:37,669
or we both can die together.

2675
02:21:37,749 --> 02:21:39,429
You can never convince
me with your words.

2676
02:21:39,594 --> 02:21:41,219
It was a big mistake
to enter your life.

2677
02:21:41,279 --> 02:21:43,708
Correct. Why did you enter my life?

2678
02:21:44,589 --> 02:21:46,069
You ruined my life.

2679
02:21:46,429 --> 02:21:47,480
I hate you, Divya.

2680
02:21:49,589 --> 02:21:51,749
I was happy until now. 24 years.

2681
02:21:51,949 --> 02:21:53,229
I had innumerable friends.

2682
02:21:53,429 --> 02:21:55,269
Meet, eat, drink and finish.

2683
02:21:55,669 --> 02:21:57,509
I didn't care much about anybody.

2684
02:21:58,639 --> 02:21:59,829
I didn't care if someone
was with me or not.

2685
02:22:00,629 --> 02:22:02,252
I wanted to be like
that with you too.

2686
02:22:03,549 --> 02:22:05,709
But I couldn't do that. Why?

2687
02:22:06,949 --> 02:22:07,843
That's why I hate you.

2688
02:22:09,349 --> 02:22:11,269
Anju and Abhay have been
my friends from childhood.

2689
02:22:11,949 --> 02:22:14,029
I used to share everything
with them first.

2690
02:22:14,309 --> 02:22:15,389
But now?

2691
02:22:15,909 --> 02:22:17,669
I want to share
everything with you first.

2692
02:22:18,029 --> 02:22:19,909
Why? Are you that important to me?

2693
02:22:20,909 --> 02:22:22,269
That's why I hate you.

2694
02:22:23,549 --> 02:22:25,349
When your dad was dragging
you away that day

2695
02:22:25,709 --> 02:22:28,589
I was worried about you,
not about myself.

2696
02:22:28,669 --> 02:22:31,829
I was sick with worry
that they will scold you.

2697
02:22:32,669 --> 02:22:35,549
Till now I thought I knew
what I wanted in life, Divya.

2698
02:22:37,029 --> 02:22:40,462
But after you left I
realized that I know nothing.

2699
02:22:43,589 --> 02:22:46,269
That's why I hate you.

2700
02:22:47,512 --> 02:22:49,239
I hate you too.

2701
02:22:51,949 --> 02:22:54,109
I love you! Yes!

2702
02:22:54,549 --> 02:22:56,509
Shourya! Shourya, come down.

2703
02:22:56,589 --> 02:22:58,389
Shourya, please.
- I was born for a reason.

2704
02:22:58,469 --> 02:23:00,269
Shourya! - I was alive
till now so that I can unite you.

2705
02:23:00,349 --> 02:23:01,909
Now I will die.
This is enough, brother.

2706
02:23:01,989 --> 02:23:05,709
Listen to me. Come down.- Give
me your phone. Give me your phone.

2707
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:06,869
Last picture, brother.

2708
02:23:06,949 --> 02:23:09,058
Shourya, careful. - I just
want to take a selfie. -Shourya!

2709
02:23:09,469 --> 02:23:10,749
Brother, post this on Facebook.

2710
02:23:10,829 --> 02:23:12,389
Saroja should see it.

2711
02:23:12,469 --> 02:23:13,989
He is going to jump.

2712
02:23:14,069 --> 02:23:15,629
He is going to jump.

2713
02:23:15,789 --> 02:23:16,629
Come down, brother.

2714
02:23:16,709 --> 02:23:18,389
You board your flight.
I will board my flight.

2715
02:23:19,469 --> 02:23:20,429
Shourya!

2716
02:23:22,789 --> 02:23:23,749
I won't come.

2717
02:23:23,829 --> 02:23:25,568
Shourya!

2718
02:23:30,366 --> 02:23:32,069
Shourya! - Shourya!

2719
02:23:35,149 --> 02:23:36,848
Shourya, please!

2720
02:23:38,149 --> 02:23:39,535
Shourya!

2721
02:23:40,509 --> 02:23:43,269
Kapileshwaramma! You are
the one that pulled the zip

2722
02:23:43,389 --> 02:23:46,869
without checking if our
son had his underwear on or no.

2723
02:23:46,949 --> 02:23:49,229
What can I do from
here if you call me now?

2724
02:23:49,469 --> 02:23:51,936
Please don't torture me.

2725
02:23:56,669 --> 02:23:59,309
Don't you have anything
else to talk about on phone

2726
02:23:59,389 --> 02:24:01,389
other than how to wash
his bum or pull his zipper?

2727
02:24:01,469 --> 02:24:03,349
Your stupid torture has turned
me into a stupid truck driver

2728
02:24:03,429 --> 02:24:05,310
from a professional killer.

2729
02:24:11,149 --> 02:24:12,149
Shourya!

2730
02:24:12,229 --> 02:24:13,469
Shourya!

2731
02:24:13,549 --> 02:24:14,949
They say a person sees
his whole life before his eyes

2732
02:24:15,029 --> 02:24:16,100
just before his death.

2733
02:24:19,149 --> 02:24:22,389
Hey, move aside!

2734
02:24:32,053 --> 02:24:34,989
I killed someone. Finished.

2735
02:24:40,269 --> 02:24:42,509
Kapileshwaramma,
you pulled the zip on our son

2736
02:24:42,589 --> 02:24:44,349
now the police will
pull the trigger on me.

2737
02:24:44,509 --> 02:24:46,389
Because of your phone torture

2738
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:47,589
I lost control over the
truck and rammed into someone.

2739
02:24:47,669 --> 02:24:48,669
What did I do to deserve this?

2740
02:24:48,749 --> 02:24:49,749
Shourya! Are you okay?

2741
02:24:49,829 --> 02:24:51,669
Sir! I didn't kill him on purpose.

2742
02:24:51,749 --> 02:24:54,109
Kapileshwaramma pulled
our son's zipper up

2743
02:24:54,189 --> 02:24:55,429
without seeing if he
had his underwear on or no.

2744
02:24:55,509 --> 02:24:57,549
Listen to me, sir.
You didn't kill anyone.

2745
02:24:57,709 --> 02:25:00,149
In fact, you saved someone, sir.
You are a real hero.

2746
02:25:00,229 --> 02:25:01,029
Hero? - Yes, sir.

2747
02:25:01,109 --> 02:25:02,469
What did you say?
I'm a hero?

2748
02:25:02,549 --> 02:25:03,553
Congratulations.

2749
02:25:03,829 --> 02:25:05,869
Sir, she tortured me on the phone.

2750
02:25:05,949 --> 02:25:07,500
Get down.

2751
02:25:09,229 --> 02:25:12,349
Are you okay?
- Are you hurt? - Hey, are you okay?

2752
02:25:12,536 --> 02:25:13,749
Shourya! - We all were so worried.

2753
02:25:13,909 --> 02:25:15,748
Why did you do this?- Shourya!

2754
02:25:44,747 --> 02:25:46,269
Yay!

2755
02:25:46,349 --> 02:25:49,229
Time for celebration!

2756
02:25:49,309 --> 02:25:50,829
Divya! Yay!

2757
02:25:53,635 --> 02:25:57,429
Yay! Yay! Yay!
