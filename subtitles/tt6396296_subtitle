1
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:42,081
Oh no!
Let me keep it here.

2
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:01,961
'BYOMKESH PAWRBO'

3
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,721
Receive the call, Mr. Ajit.

4
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:16,401
Hello!
- Greetings, Mr. Byomkesh.

5
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,201
I am Sasadhar Bakchi.

6
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,401
Greetings.
I am Ajit speaking.

7
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,281
How are you, Mr. Ajit?

8
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,601
I am fine.

9
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:25,961
Byomkesh isn't at home.

10
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,681
He has gone
to the literary meet.

11
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:32,361
Shall I.. Will he be at home
in the morning?

12
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,201
I would like to meet him.
- Sure..

13
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,721
You can come.
I will inform him.

14
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,601
Thank you.
I will be there at around 11 a.m.

15
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:42,041
Sure. - I will hang up.
- All right.

16
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,561
Sasadhar Bakchi,
from Writers' building gave a call.

17
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,721
Oh!

18
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:59,081
You should have attended
the literary meet.

19
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,921
He may start writing books
very soon.

20
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,721
I may look after the book store.

21
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,801
His speech
might have started by now.

22
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,801
Maybe everyone is listening
to him with rapt attention.

23
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,721
Everyone is listening
to his speech in awe.

24
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,681
She is just a kid.

25
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,081
I don't treat them as human

26
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,881
whoever hurt kids like her.

27
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,881
It's up to you.

28
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:50,121
You can't blame that
I didn't warn you beforehand.

29
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:42,721
Give it to me.

30
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,481
Hey. Don't do that.

31
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,281
She is Binti,
her mother.

32
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,601
Go to mother.

33
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,481
What are you doing!

34
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,201
Thank you very much.

35
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,121
Go and take care of your daughter.

36
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,241
Come with me, dear.

37
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,881
Mr. Gopen, search house number

38
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,121
three and six properly.

39
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,161
You will get to know
about other girls.

40
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,361
All right.
I will look into it.

41
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:16,961
Shall I book a car for you?

42
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,201
I need clean clothes before that.

43
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,841
How was your speech?
- It was wonderful.

44
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,201
Was there enough audience?

45
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,161
Yes, there was a huge crowd.

46
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:36,521
Did they like your speech?
- Yes, they loved it!

47
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,641
I am starving, Satyabati.
- I will arrange the dinner.

48
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,201
I guess the discussion
was about Kurukshetra.

49
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,241
What do you mean?

50
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,521
Mr. Sasadhar gave a call and he
will be coming in the morning.

51
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,241
Is he the chief secretary?
- Yes.

52
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,841
Byomkesh, you are quite renowned.

53
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:02,921
Why do you think so?

54
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,001
Is the arrival of chief secretary
a sign of being renowned!

55
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:10,881
A government car
in front of this rental house.

56
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,401
For whom has it come? - It's
for the guy staying upstairs.

57
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:15,841
It's a foreign car.
- Look how it's shining!

58
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:18,241
Whose car is this?
- Don't touch it.

59
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,441
You could have called for me.

60
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,441
It's all right.

61
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:30,801
Here is a cup of tea for you.
- Yes. Thank you.

62
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,441
What can I do for you, sir?

63
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,681
The name of the place
is Santalgola.

64
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,401
After second world war
the American soldiers

65
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:49,161
sold their arms and ammunitions

66
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,401
like hand grenade,
rifle, revolver

67
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:56,041
to the locals while leaving.
- All right.

68
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,401
This happened a long ago.

69
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,961
Yes. It wasn't a problem earlier.

70
00:10:02,121 --> 00:10:03,521
After the country is free
some people think

71
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,201
that they can do
whatever they wish.

72
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,641
These illegal arms are
being smuggled to different places.

73
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:13,681
This is leading to rail
robberies, murders.

74
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,921
A few men were arrested but..
- The arms weren't seized.

75
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,921
Mr. Byomkesh, the West Bengal
Government wants you

76
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,641
to take the responsibility.

77
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,401
The scars of Tevaga revolt
haven't healed yet.

78
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,921
The matter is pretty sensitive.
- Oh.

79
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:39,481
I am lighting up a cigarette.
- Sure.

80
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,921
Buying arms isn't that easy.

81
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,481
Yes. For that reason..

82
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,721
A list of all
the wealthy people

83
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,641
is prepared.

84
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,001
Nafar Kundu has a rice mill.

85
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,281
Badrinath Das owns a tea garden.

86
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:01,841
Biswanath Mallik
has a sawmill.

87
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:04,841
Jamuna Das Gangaram
is the owner of a rice mill

88
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,721
but his actual business
is pawning.

89
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:08,681
Thank you.

90
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:12,681
Police is suspicious about these
four businessmen

91
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,841
along with a few distinguished men
from Santalgola.

92
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:18,481
What about searching
their residences?

93
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,481
We don't have any proof.

94
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,561
These are all
renowned personalities.

95
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,241
They control the market.

96
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:29,841
We can't get any information
regarding the arms smuggling.

97
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:34,001
The situation will turn worse
if we can't stop it.

98
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,881
You make the arrangements.
I will go there.

99
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,921
The tea was really good, ma'am.
- Thank you. - Bye.

100
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:52,241
There is an officer named
Sukhamoy Samanta. - This way.

101
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,761
He will take care of you.

102
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:58,481
Call me if you face any problem.

103
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:03,401
I will leave now, Mr. Byomkesh
and Mr. Ajit. - All right.

104
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,321
Wish you all the very best.
- Thank you.

105
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:10,881
Goodbye..

106
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,281
Shall we prepare to travel
to the mountains?

107
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,481
Yes. Forest is also there.

108
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,921
Am I included in this trip?
- This is a government issue.

109
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,881
This trip is quite risky.
- Is it so?

110
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,401
It isn't risky for you.
How can it be risky for me?

111
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,321
I will come along with you
to Santalgola.

112
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,601
Handle her now!

113
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,361
Are you fine, sir?
- Yes.

114
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:28,121
Spread the fertilizers properly.

115
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,921
Work fast..

116
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,201
Hey, Sadananda.

117
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:38,121
Where are you going?

118
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,481
I am going to Kolkata.
- Oh!

119
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,441
When will you return?
- Within a few days.

120
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,521
You are going to Kolkata
very frequently nowadays.

121
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,441
I am supposed to get on
the down train.

122
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:52,721
I am getting late.

123
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:57,081
I think he is very busy.

124
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,641
We will have fun, Mother.
- Don't trouble me.

125
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,361
Hey, good morning.

126
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,401
Leave that.
- Why?

127
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:08,041
A detective is coming
to investigate.

128
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,401
What are you saying?
He can't catch you.

129
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,161
Mr. Byomkesh.

130
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,721
I am Sukumar Samanto, Inspector
of Santalgola police station.

131
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:31,601
Greetings.

132
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,881
There was a trunk call
from Writers' building.

133
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:34,761
Come with me.

134
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,841
Come.

135
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,081
Let me have a look.

136
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:49,401
Pronotosh. - What?
- Look.

137
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,841
He is Byomkesh Bakshi.

138
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:54,961
He will prosecute the criminals
very quickly.

139
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,041
I am really lucky to be with you.

140
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:57,801
Come..
- Come.

141
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:05,241
This is a small hilly area.

142
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:08,481
It's a cakewalk for a detective
as great as you.

143
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:11,841
My presence here has caused you
trouble, I believe.

144
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:14,121
What do you say!

145
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,961
I am a mere cop.
I'll retire from the post soon.

146
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,401
You are the seeker of truth.
Get in.

147
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,841
Should I spend my time in these
or should I perform my duties!

148
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:26,161
Get me a cup of tea.

149
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:30,641
Let's go.

150
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,321
These parts were previously part
of Bhutan.

151
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,201
This is Dooars, right!
- Yes.

152
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,921
In maybe 1864 or 1865 the British
took over this place.

153
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,001
This place was in the news some
time back. You must've read it.

154
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,241
Yes, the farmers had revolted
against the tyrants.

155
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:05,801
Greetings, sir.
Greetings, ma'am.

156
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:06,601
Greetings.

157
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:18,361
Greetings to you all.
- Yes.

158
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:19,601
Greetings.

159
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,961
Ratan.
- Y-Yes, sir.

160
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,801
Keep in mind that these people
shouldn't face any difficulty here.

161
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,361
Y-Yes, sir. - She will take
care of your food. - Okay.

162
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:38,321
Oh my goodness, ma'am.
You've got such a pretty face.

163
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:42,001
What's your name? - Basanti.
- She is a very good cook.

164
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:45,361
Let's start work from tomorrow.

165
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,841
Don't you think you are getting
too excited, Mr. Samanta?

166
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,641
You've already made it known
to everyone that I'll be here.

167
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,961
If we have to begin the search,
I have to let everyone know.

168
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,961
Will letting everyone know help
us in the search? - Definitely!

169
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,881
The police is baffled
with the matter.

170
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:03,121
The people would like to check
his capabilities in that case.

171
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,521
Anyway, take rest.
I'll have a word with you later.

172
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,001
Did you search for it?

173
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,161
I've searched every
nook and corner.

174
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,921
There's nothing to be found.
There's absolutely nothing.

175
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:17,441
Oh, by the way. Don't take any
step without informing me.

176
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,641
They are powerful business men.

177
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:22,241
The merchant association here
is very powerful.

178
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:25,561
Kindly, keep this in mind.

179
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:35,041
Rude! - He is cunning.
He is as sly as a fox.

180
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:37,961
Let's go.
- Salute, sir.

181
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,401
Wow! There's a writing desk
and fireplace too.

182
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,801
This is beyond imagination.

183
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,841
Ma'am, what should I cook
for lunch? - Say it.

184
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,561
As of now, get us tea.
- Okay.

185
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,201
Don't add much sugar to it.
- Ajit

186
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,161
what do you want
to have for lunch?

187
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,761
Don't you get good mutton here?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:01,961
It's available.
- Prepare that.

189
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,801
Satya tell her to get good mutton
for this author. - Yes.

190
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,321
You go.
I'll see to it.

191
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,761
Sir, my brother has sent this
for him.

192
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,721
Wow!
- Here, show it to me.

193
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,721
Wow! This is wonderful.
- Let me see.

194
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:23,921
This is excellent.
- I'll visit the station now.

195
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:27,481
Should I accompany you? - No,
you take care of your lunch.

196
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,441
Why do you want to visit
the station all of a sudden?

197
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,681
The station is far off.
How will you reach there?

198
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,601
A lot of news do the rounds
of the station, Satya.

199
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:35,161
It is the gateway to the crime.

200
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:38,281
When we came in, I had observed
that the guard has a cycle.

201
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,441
I'll leave now.

202
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:01,681
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

203
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,521
Oh, you are going for hunting.

204
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:07,161
Yes. I am going
to Bagmari jungle. - Oh!

205
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,361
Some of my goods will arrive
from Calcutta.

206
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:11,161
Keep it in the godown
separately. - Okay.

207
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:12,921
Tea will be exported tomorrow.

208
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,561
Get the booking done properly.
- Yes, okay.

209
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,601
You say it's okay
but you end up messing it.

210
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:23,361
You all are hopeless bunch
of haggards. Hey! - Yes.

211
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:33,841
I'll go now. - Have you got
a matchstick? - Yes.

212
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,881
He is a powerful man, it seems.
- Yes, of course.

213
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,481
He is Mr. Badrinath Das. He is the
owner of B N Das tea estate.

214
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,201
My, goodness.
- Thank you. - I'll leave now.

215
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:53,921
Hey, Basanti.
- Yes, ma'am.

216
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,521
Tell me of places we can visit
here.

217
00:20:56,721 --> 00:21:00,681
We have beautiful mountains here,
surrounded by forests.

218
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:02,921
There are splendid tea
estates. This is a beautiful place.

219
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,641
Doesn't it scare you
to return home

220
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,521
through the forests, all alone?

221
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:09,161
Yes, there are wild
elephants, rhinos

222
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,761
snakes and cheetah.
- Elephants!

223
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:15,441
However, I don't fear them.

224
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:18,881
I fear the human beings here.

225
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:21,561
Murders and other crimes
are regular affairs.

226
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,921
The police officer doesn't do
anything about it! - Police!

227
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:26,961
Don't talk of the police officer.

228
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,121
He goes about feasting on food
here and there.

229
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,161
You think he'll work!

230
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,761
You are laughing, you idiot!

231
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:38,841
Nyara would've bashed you up.
- Why? - Give me.

232
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,801
Nyara's newly wed wife was
having a shower.

233
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,041
Amrito climbed up the tree
and passed lewd comments.

234
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,001
He is crazy!

235
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,361
You roam about at odd hours.

236
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:52,881
Don't you feel scared?

237
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,761
Whatever! - Hey, this implies
you aren't afraid of ghosts!

238
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,681
Hey, let's go..
- Yes, let's go.

239
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,161
Let's go..
Come on, let's go.

240
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,641
Hey, Amra.
- Amra, come along.

241
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,961
Hey, you didn't answer me.
- I am not afraid of anything.

242
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:17,801
What I've witnessed would have
frightened you all beyond words.

243
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,321
A ghost resides in this forest.

244
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,121
What!
What is he saying!

245
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,481
Rubbish! - What do you mean
by rubbish! I've seen it.

246
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:29,681
There's a pitch black ghost
riding a black horse.

247
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:32,001
His head is covered up.
He goes about with a booming sound.

248
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:34,641
I've seen it twice.

249
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:39,401
I am not afraid of anything. You
all are cowards. - Really! - Yes.

250
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:46,041
Take this stone and go to the tree
at the entrance of the jungle

251
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,961
behind Sadananda's residence.
Here, take it.

252
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,961
Go. Make a mark there.
- Go.. - Go..

253
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,521
Go..
- Go..

254
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:00,361
Now it'll be fun.

255
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:04,081
Let's go..

256
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:08,281
Go..
Keep God in mind and go on.

257
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:11,561
He has been trapped now.
He'll learn a lesson now.

258
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:43,561
Amra..
- Amra.. - Hey, Amra.

259
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,161
Hey, Amra.

260
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,041
How much would you charge for it?
- The vegetables are so fresh.

261
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,921
What are these?
Aren't those squash?

262
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,641
Yes, ma'am.
- Yes. Let's go that way.

263
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:13,561
How much is it for? - Two anas,
ma'am. - Hey, Satya. - Yes.

264
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:15,761
Don't buy things in such huge
quantities. It'll be wasted.

265
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:19,601
The roller mill has worn out.
We need a new one.

266
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,401
Basanti, where's the market
for spices? Is it that way?

267
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,521
It's that way, ma'am.
- Come along with me. - Go.

268
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:37,521
Oh my! Here they are.
- You go ahead. - Okay.

269
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,521
Hey, if you are done shopping,
go back home with Ratan.

270
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:42,081
We have work to finish off.
We'll be back soon.

271
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:44,441
Oh. Don't be late.
Come back soon.

272
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,041
I am sorry.

273
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:00,161
I-I am sorry.

274
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,921
Are you from Kolkata? Isn't
he Mr. Bomkyesh Bakshi?

275
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:08,921
Yes.
- I am Juthika Mallick.

276
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,761
I am Mr. Biswanath Mallick's wife.

277
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:13,441
Is it done?
- It's impossible.

278
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,401
Sir, which way is
Jamuna Das's rice mill?

279
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:19,161
Go straight and then take a
right. - Thank you. Let's go.

280
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,241
Come..
I had to inform you.

281
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:36,281
He is Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. This
is his friend, Ajit Bandhopadyay

282
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,681
Come. Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

283
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:45,241
Have a look at this.

284
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:48,161
Someone has threatened me
through this letter.

285
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:51,801
I received it by the morning mail.
I don't mingle in any matter.

286
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,201
Why have they targeted me?

287
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:56,961
I am aware of all of your
activities.

288
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,201
He isn't the only one.

289
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,681
Every reputed man has been
threatened via letters.

290
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:04,441
Badrinath Das, Biswanath Mallick,
Nafar Kundu and everyone else.

291
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,521
Do all the letters say the
same thing? - Yes it's the same.

292
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:11,081
I don't have any arms,
Mr. Bakshi. I am a businessman.

293
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:13,561
I religiously follow
Lord Hanuman. - What?

294
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,801
Why do you feel the letter
is concerned about arms!

295
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:19,041
No, this topic is discussed widely
here.

296
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,521
You go on.

297
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:24,121
You are in no way involved
in dealing with illegal arms!

298
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:26,281
No, sir. - That's it.
There's nothing to fear.

299
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:29,561
There are so much going on about
arms. What if they kill me?

300
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:31,641
I don't mingle in any matter,
sir.

301
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,801
What if I search the mill?

302
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,241
Search every nook and corner.
Lachman, get the keys.

303
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,121
There's no need of that.

304
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:41,841
You've been running this business
for a long time.

305
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:45,201
You won't be stupid enough
to hide illegal arms here.

306
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:48,201
Come, Mr. Subhomoy. - However,
what am I supposed to do?

307
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,241
Follow Lord 'Hanuman'.

308
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,641
Is this a blackmail
or warning letter?

309
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,041
Even if it's blackmail,
who is writing these letters?

310
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,481
It might be the one
selling the illegal arms.

311
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,641
That's possible only if they have
bought the arms.

312
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:10,921
What is the reaction of the other
men who received the letters?

313
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:15,681
They don't seem much
bothered. - It's but obvious.

314
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,161
Everyone is aware of my presence
owing to you.

315
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,441
Ajit, do you think they'll keep
the arms now!

316
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:23,481
No, I don't think so.
- They'll have it moved to a place

317
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,321
that is not easily discoverable.

318
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:28,721
Yes, now we'll sit idle. We'll
gorge on good food and read novels.

319
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:31,241
We don't have much work other
than that. Right, sir? - Yes.

320
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,641
By the way,
I forgot to inform you.

321
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,841
The merchant's association
has arranged for a program

322
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,081
in your honour. - Light it.

323
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,321
Everyone be there. You'll get
introduced to each other.

324
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:41,041
It's around 7 p.m.
- You would be there, right!

325
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:44,561
I'll see if I can be there.
I'll have to go to Bagmari.

326
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:47,361
Where is that?
- It's about two miles from here.

327
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:50,521
It's a village by the jungles.
There has been a murder there.

328
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,161
He was a mad man.
I'll be back soon.

329
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,401
Hey, where's your car?

330
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:59,841
It's broken down.
I'll leave now. - Yes.

331
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:04,521
The handwriting in the letter
tells me it's you.

332
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,881
Yes, however the bait failed
me.

333
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,361
What would've been the case
had the bait not failed you!

334
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:12,001
It would've taught them a lesson
though others might've suffered.

335
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:20,001
Rice, sir. - What fish is this?
- It's 'Bronali'.

336
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,081
Basanti got me to buy it
from the market. - Serve it.

337
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,481
Isn't it delicious!
- Wait, let me taste.

338
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:25,361
This is delicious.

339
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,881
Have your food and doze off.
- Serve a small portion.

340
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:29,601
Sleep!
There are so many jackals around.

341
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:32,601
They have been howling all
night. You slept peacefully.

342
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,961
I didn't hear any jackal.

343
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:35,721
I guess you didn't have
a good sleep.

344
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,961
No. - It's obvious.
- I feel scared.

345
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,161
You all will be going around
as soon as it's day time.

346
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,881
Should I serve this, ma'am?
- Yes, serve this.

347
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:44,961
That's it.

348
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,601
I feel bored here!

349
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:50,161
There's a program
in the evening.

350
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:52,281
It has been arranged
in the honour of our guest.

351
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,321
You come with us today.
You'll like it.

352
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:59,721
"The night will fall
upon the soil."

353
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,721
Nafar Kundu is always present
in all issues.

354
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:07,241
I don't trust him at all.

355
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:09,921
You mean he might write
those anonymous letters. - Why not!

356
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,601
He is not human, Mr. Byomkesh.

357
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,681
You've no idea of things
he deals in.

358
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:18,361
Mr. Biswanath, come here.

359
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,681
Come, introduce yourselves.

360
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:22,041
This is Mr. Biswanath Mallick.
- You are here.

361
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,241
He is a reputed business man.
- How are you?

362
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,561
He is Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi.
- You..

363
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,521
Greetings..
This is my wife, Juthika.

364
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:30,521
You must be Satyabati.

365
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,801
Greetings.

366
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:37,321
"The grounds will break, tonight."

367
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,441
I've heard you've been threatened.
- Yes, I threw it in the dustbin.

368
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,201
I've got nothing to do
with arms!

369
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:48,921
I run a mill.

370
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:50,681
Do you doubt anyone?

371
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:54,601
"The grounds will break, tonight."

372
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,721
"Tonight.."

373
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:59,441
We went to Kolkata
few months back.

374
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,561
We watched the movie 'Spellbound'
by Hitchcock, at Metro.

375
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,161
It's a brilliant movie.

376
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,201
It stars Gregory Peck
and Ingrid Bergman.

377
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:07,041
They are such great actors!

378
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:09,801
Yes, you are right.
- I feel suffocated here.

379
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,161
I don't like it here.

380
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:12,721
I hail from Baghbazar.

381
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:16,241
Then I give priority to my duties
as a wife.

382
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,201
My husband is always
busy with his work.

383
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:21,841
The beats of the tom-tom
makes my heart skip a beat.

384
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:25,281
"Where does the king
get his jewels?"

385
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:29,361
"Where does the king
get his jewels?"

386
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:33,081
What's the matter!
- Hey!

387
00:31:34,321 --> 00:31:35,161
I can't do it..

388
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:42,881
"Where does the king
get his jewels?"

389
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:48,401
"Where does the king
get his jewels?"

390
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,921
"Where does the king
get his jewels?"

391
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:53,321
Come..

392
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:54,681
I was waiting for you.

393
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,481
Where is Mr. Mallick?

394
00:31:57,321 --> 00:31:58,121
There he is.

395
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,641
If it wasn't possible for you,
I could've constructed

396
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,401
the boundary wall.

397
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,281
You should've given it a thought
before promising me. Right!

398
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,161
Don't worry. I'll get it done.
- I've to worry.

399
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:15,641
It's been a long time. I don't
like shabby properties unlike you..

400
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:19,001
Who is it?
Are you Mr. Byomkesh? Oh!

401
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,881
Greetings. I am Nafar Kundu.

402
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:22,361
You've been here
with your clan.

403
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:24,001
It's good. Did you get it?

404
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:25,801
Did you find any arms?

405
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:27,521
No, I didn't find it yet.
I'll soon lay my hands on them.

406
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,081
Are you a cop?
- I seek the truth.

407
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:34,041
Yes? Seeker..
- Yes.

408
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,161
He is rich but illiterate.

409
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:40,881
He is exactly so.

410
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:42,281
Damn my fate!

411
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,681
My car hit the boundaries
of his tea estate.

412
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:47,601
I've promised to repair it.

413
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:51,241
I lack time.
Wherever he'll spot me..

414
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,041
Nafar is his ally.

415
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,001
He is a crooked man.

416
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,761
It's not easy to track arms.

417
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:07,721
It's been really tough.

418
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:10,081
He said he'll investigate.
I too allowed him to do so.

419
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,921
Who fears him!
- Sukhomoy didn't have a word

420
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,481
with me at my place.

421
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:18,961
Let him come to me.

422
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:21,601
I'll let him know
who is what!

423
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,561
The fragile man from Kolkata or
the powerful man from Dooars!

424
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,601
"Women, come out."

425
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,721
Badrinath loves hunting, isn't it!

426
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,281
He says he hunts birds.

427
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,921
He had been to Bagmari
jungles, yesterday.

428
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:41,321
What! - Yes.
- The murder took place yesterday.

429
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,841
Badrinath might export arms,
hidden in sacks of tea.

430
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:53,961
He might do that.

431
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,881
"Women, come out."

432
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:57,961
Maybe that's what makes you
prioritize the station.

433
00:33:58,561 --> 00:33:59,681
Yes.

434
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:01,961
Do you know the trouble is,
author?

435
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,881
It's all uncanny till now.

436
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,041
It's translucent.
It's not clear.

437
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,841
How do you plan
to solve it?

438
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:18,001
We need a major clue.

439
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:22,281
Else it's..
- It's tough.

440
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,921
Do you suspect any of these
four men?

441
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,041
Answer me who told Yudhisthir
of 'Ramayana'?

442
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,601
Who?
- Answer me.

443
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,481
It was Markandeyo.
It was during the forest episode.

444
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,121
Come to think of it!

445
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:47,681
Ages ago, in a cave, sage Vyas
dictated

446
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,441
and Ganesha wrote it down.

447
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:50,841
It's strange.

448
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:53,201
There's a difference
between the two caves.

449
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,401
One is located at Basar near
Nisamabad.

450
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:59,081
The other is located at Managram
at the Himalayas. - Yes, Managram!

451
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:00,441
It's called Lord Ganesha's cave.

452
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,001
It's there on the way
to Gomukh.

453
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,721
They are situated at two
ends of the country.

454
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,481
It's obvious it will be so.

455
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:06,881
It's the great 'Mahabharata'.

456
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:08,401
The whole India..
- Mr. Byomkesh..

457
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:16,921
Greetings.
We are residents of Bagmari.

458
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:19,241
We have resorted to you
in times of distress.

459
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,961
One of our friends Amrit..
- I'll leave.

460
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:28,721
...got murdered in the jungle
two days ago.

461
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:30,521
Yes, Mr. Sukhomoy had gone
to investigate the matter!

462
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,681
However, we seek help from you.

463
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,801
Actually, Amra has been shot.

464
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,201
Shot!
- Yes.

465
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:40,081
He has been shot at a spot
behind Sadananda's residence.

466
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,681
If you could..

467
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,001
I am here on a different case..

468
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:47,961
Sir,
we are partially responsible

469
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:50,841
for Amra's death.

470
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,721
How are you all
responsible for it?

471
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,081
None of you have seen
the ghost!

472
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,961
No, only Amra saw it.

473
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:05,481
Balaram allowed him to roam about.
He wandered about in the forests.

474
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:06,441
Who is Balaram?

475
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:07,641
He is Amrita's maternal uncle.

476
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:08,961
He used to stay with his
maternal uncle.

477
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,161
Does anyone in the village
own a horse?

478
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:16,161
No.

479
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:20,121
Does anyone own a gun?
- No. - No.

480
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,161
Potol, you mentioned
Sadananda's house. Who is he?

481
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:27,361
He is a miser. He doesn't
contribute towards festivals.

482
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:30,281
He frequently visits Kolkata
with a trunk.

483
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,921
You think the gun is a stolen
one, Byomkesh!

484
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:37,521
Since no one in the village owns
a gun, this is possible. - Yes.

485
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:40,321
Go right from the next road.
- Go right..

486
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:49,601
Mr. Balaram..

487
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,081
Who is it?
- Come fast.

488
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:52,401
Wait.. I am coming.

489
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,521
It's Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi
here.

490
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,041
Oh..

491
00:36:58,361 --> 00:36:59,481
Greetings. Have a seat.

492
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,161
Hey, everyone.
- Yes.

493
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,681
Get him a glass of water.
- Okay.

494
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,721
Ma'am, come here.
- I got to know

495
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,001
Amrit used to roam the forests.

496
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:07,441
You never stopped him
from doing so!

497
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:09,201
I have tried to stop him
multiple times.

498
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:14,161
He is an orphan. How much
can I take care of him!

499
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:18,561
Moreover, he was mentally ill.

500
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,401
Thank you. There's no need
of that.

501
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:24,081
Potol, let's go to the spot
where Amrit was..

502
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:26,481
Yes.
- Let's go.

503
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:28,081
Let's go.
- Okay.

504
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:29,481
Let's go.

505
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,881
Come along..

506
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,321
Did Amrit work for a living?

507
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:40,841
Yes, he worked as a labourer for a
few days in Badrinath's tea estate.

508
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,561
Then they kicked him out.
- Why?

509
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,401
He was a mentally ill man, sir.
His words might've offended them.

510
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:50,481
This is Sadananda's house.

511
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:54,121
The forest behind this house..
I have warned him so many times.

512
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:57,601
There might be wild animals.
Don't roam about at night.

513
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,001
He never paid heed
to me.

514
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:01,841
Didn't Amrit tell you
of the ghost?

515
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,561
What?
- Ghost.

516
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:05,441
Yes, he told me of it.

517
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,441
However, I didn't believe him.

518
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:12,721
He said a ghost is visible
on a black horse in the forests.

519
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,921
He told me once or twice.

520
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,561
Potol, which way is it?

521
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:19,161
It's this way. Come.

522
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:25,721
His corpse was found here.

523
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,561
This is the stone I had given him.

524
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,161
That's the tree.

525
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,201
Be careful, there are thorns.
- Okay.

526
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:02,481
Aren't these 'Manasa' plants?
- Yes.

527
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:14,521
Sir..
- Let's go..

528
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:35,841
Isn't Sadananda home?

529
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,241
Sir, he's gone to Kolkata.

530
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:55,281
What might these be!

531
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,521
These are imprints
of a horse's hooves.

532
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,961
It's the ghost!

533
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:03,441
If it be a ghost how can it leave
imprints, Potol!

534
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,681
When did Sadananda go to Kolkata?

535
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:10,361
Sir, he's been away for more than
seven days.

536
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,321
Let's go.

537
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:19,201
The post mortem report
will tell me

538
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:20,841
he was shot with which revolver.

539
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:24,961
This will further tell me whether
it's linked to illegal arms.

540
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:28,481
Black market, black ghost
and black horse.

541
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,881
There are many horses here,
at few places.

542
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,161
Where is it?

543
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,041
The horses are worked
in the mills.

544
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,921
They are there in Nafar's mill
and Badrinath's tea estate.

545
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:38,881
There is Sadananda.

546
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,561
There he is.
Sadananda.

547
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,201
Yes, say.

548
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:49,361
Sadananda, Amrit is dead.

549
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:55,081
A-Amra..
- Two days back

550
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:57,521
he was shot
at a place behind your house.

551
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,601
What was he doing there
behind my house?

552
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:07,201
He told us he has seen a ghost
rider in the forest.

553
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,561
He said he isn't scared.
We are cowards.

554
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,721
We challenged him to make a mark
on the tree there.

555
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:15,361
He agreed.

556
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:16,601
Then..

557
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:18,561
Have you seen the ghost rider,
Mr. Sadananda?

558
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:19,561
What?

559
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:25,401
N-No..
I didn't see anything.

560
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:31,241
Amra..

561
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:42,321
Potol.
- Yes.

562
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,441
I'll leave today.

563
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,481
Don't worry.
I'll look into this matter.

564
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,041
Okay.
- Keep an eye on everything.

565
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,161
If need be, let me know
immediately.

566
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,081
Okay.
- I'll leave, Mr. Balaram.

567
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:22,041
Did you observe Sadananda?

568
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:24,041
What is it?
- Where's his trunk?

569
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:40,601
Sadananda..
- Sadananda..

570
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:44,121
Sadananda..
- Sadananda..

571
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:55,481
Sadananda..
- Slow down. Don't touch him.

572
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,641
Potol, call for Sukumar Samantha,
immediately.

573
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,481
It's a hand grenade.

574
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,841
Be careful, Ajit.

575
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,361
You all don't come in.

576
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:41,561
Be very careful, Ajit.
It might be dangerous inside.

577
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,481
These are herbs.

578
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:36,841
Have a look at these,
Ajit.

579
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,441
Be careful.

580
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,561
The door is locked from inside.

581
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:32,881
The trap was set at the entrance.

582
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:35,641
This implies..

583
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:41,041
They got into the courtyard
via the branches of this tree.

584
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,441
They crossed the courtyard
and reached the entrance.

585
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,361
The grenade has been so planted
that it would've

586
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:57,961
gone off
on opening the door.

587
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,201
This is a booby trap.

588
00:47:04,161 --> 00:47:06,441
The horse was outside!
- Yes.

589
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:10,841
He entered the house on a horse
by jumping over the wall.

590
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,521
Then he sets up a booby trap
at the entrance.

591
00:47:20,681 --> 00:47:24,361
Is anything fishy!
- It seems so.

592
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:30,161
Illegal arms,
hand grenade, bullet

593
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:36,001
two murders
and a ghost rider.

594
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:38,241
There's a trunk too.

595
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,521
Didn't Sadananda have
any relatives?

596
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:43,361
He has a sister.
She doesn't visit him.

597
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,241
She stays out of town.
- Does she stay in Kolkata?

598
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:47,161
I don't know.

599
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:49,241
What did Sadananda
do for a living?

600
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:52,241
He dealt in herbal
medicines.

601
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:55,681
He used to work for Nafar Kundu
previously.

602
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:57,841
He lost his job after a legal
case against him.

603
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:59,241
Why a legal case all of a sudden!

604
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:02,281
We don't know that, sir.

605
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:07,041
Do you know if Sadananda
frequented the racing fields?

606
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:08,401
Race!

607
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,281
The books at his house
says he did visit the racing field.

608
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:13,601
How did he have so much money
to visit racing fields!

609
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:15,481
Take a left, sir.
- Yes.

610
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,801
Ajit, we have to visit
Nafar Kundu tomorrow. - Yes.

611
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:20,921
Baramali.
- Yes, sir.

612
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,201
Where are you?
- The goods are ready, sir.

613
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,161
Why have you got this here!

614
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:27,001
Go and hide it in the sacks
of rice. Go.

615
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,561
It will be exported by the train
in the evening. Go..- I'm going.

616
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,001
Are you doing good?
- Yes.

617
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:36,921
Did you know Sadananda Sur?

618
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:40,281
Yes, how won't I not know him!

619
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:42,401
He used to work in my mill
and steal my money.

620
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:44,961
Sir, you are falsely accusing me.

621
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:46,641
I didn't steal your money.

622
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,481
You didn't take it?
You didn't take it?

623
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:50,521
Did the money vanish in thin air?

624
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:54,881
Go away from here.
- Hey! I despise your money.

625
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:57,481
You'll suffer for this sin
of yours.

626
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:00,601
There's no use, threatening me.
- You don't know me.

627
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:03,521
I'll avenge this.
- I'll hit you with my shoes now.

628
00:49:03,601 --> 00:49:04,441
You idiot.

629
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:06,961
Don't pay heed to Sadananda.

630
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:08,441
What did he say against me?

631
00:49:08,601 --> 00:49:10,441
He might've told I'm a wicked
man. I am a horrible person.

632
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:13,641
Pay heed to me, he is the one
to write those letters.

633
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:15,201
Is it so?
- Yes.

634
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:17,961
However, Sadananda died
yesterday. - Oh!

635
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:19,761
What?

636
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:22,201
He has been killed
by a hand grenade.

637
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:25,961
Therefore it doesn't seem that
he wrote those letters.

638
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:27,361
Oh no.!

639
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:30,441
Are your goods carried to the
station via horses?

640
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,761
Yes.
- Isn't it a black horse?

641
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,041
The horses are white.
There are two of them.

642
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:37,841
White horses!
- Yes.

643
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:38,961
Let's go.
- Okay.

644
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:47,081
The man who owns white horses

645
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:50,961
might borrow a
black horse as well. - Yes.

646
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,441
It reminds me of knights
on black horses.

647
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:58,121
It reminds me of Scotland
and Sir William Wales.

648
00:49:58,801 --> 00:49:59,881
Yes, you are right.

649
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:03,761
We know someone here
who owns a black horse.

650
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:05,361
Sukumar Samanta.
- Yes.

651
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:09,201
What motive might he have
to kill Sadananda?

652
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,201
He is a cop.

653
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:15,161
A cop's role is vital
when it comes to illegal arms.

654
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:19,961
It won't work this way.
We need to free our minds.

655
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,801
Let's review the case from the
beginning. - Okay.

656
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:23,921
First Amrit is murdered.

657
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,921
He wouldn't have died had he
not gone to the forests. - Yes.

658
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:32,321
His murder wasn't planned.

659
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:35,961
Then Sadananda was
murdered. It was pre planned.

660
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:37,881
Yes, but he wasn't home.

661
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,801
Therefore, his murder was planned.

662
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:42,921
You are talking in riddles.
- Okay, I'll put it simply.

663
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,761
Assume the man got to know
Sadananda isn't home.

664
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:50,361
He rode a horse and then entered
the house over the wall.

665
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:52,721
He set up the grenade at the
entrance. It's a booby trap.

666
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,321
Sadananda will return home, open
the door and then die. - Fine.

667
00:50:56,481 --> 00:51:00,881
I believe Amrit caught
sight of the assailant

668
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,961
while he was leaving. Therefore..
- Why would anyone kill Sadananda?

669
00:51:05,321 --> 00:51:07,361
Come to the point.

670
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:12,241
What if I say Sadananda
dealt in illegal arms? - How?

671
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,641
The trunk that went missing

672
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,961
might contain illegal arms.

673
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:21,081
One man visits racing fields
in Kolkata.

674
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:23,481
What might be his
source of income?

675
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:29,161
He earned by dealing in
illegal arms! - Yes, maybe.

676
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:34,681
It's complex. Damn!
Will we get a ride back home?

677
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:41,161
Byomkesh. - Let's go.
- H-Hey..

678
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:42,881
Hello..

679
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:04,081
I hope we don't get malaria.
Oh no! Rain would be troublesome!

680
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:08,161
You do weird things!
- Quiet!

681
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:31,881
Ajit.

682
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:21,921
I know you are daunting.
Why did you drag him along?

683
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:22,881
What if something fatal
had happened?

684
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:24,401
Hey, everything will be fine.

685
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:25,921
What do you mean by everything
will be fine!

686
00:53:26,241 --> 00:53:28,801
There's grenade, bullets
and ghosts all around.

687
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:30,641
We would've been better off
at the house at Harrison Road.

688
00:53:30,681 --> 00:53:33,121
I had asked you not to come.
You were adamant.

689
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:38,281
Had I not been so, you would've
to seek the truth, being hungry.

690
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,161
What's wrong with you?

691
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:53,041
Two days back I saw it clearly
at night, without glasses.

692
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:57,281
The ghost's kids were alive
were playing in moonlight.

693
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:02,401
I saw that too. Who
might be this person?

694
00:54:02,441 --> 00:54:04,121
Sadananda knew him.

695
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:05,801
Do you realize how Sadananda

696
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,201
is gaining importance
in the matter? - Yes.

697
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:12,361
The books from racing fields,
shoe shop in a Chinese market

698
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:16,001
and perfume has been
found. Where is the trunk?

699
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,041
It might be somewhere around
Santhalgola.

700
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,761
It might be somewhere else too.

701
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:23,201
Who knows if he returned
with the trunk or not?

702
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:28,281
Oh! - Yes, that one.
Keep it here.

703
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,721
Oh, what luck! - Good morning.
- Good morning.

704
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:37,721
I am Monotosh
Bhattacharya. - Yes, I know you.

705
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:41,441
What is going on! Sadananda
died in all of your presence.

706
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,641
I mean the grenade exploded
while you all were there?

707
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:44,521
No we didn't witness it.

708
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,081
We did hear it.
- Oh! - You knew him, right?

709
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:48,481
Yes, why won't I not know him?

710
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:50,481
He got off here, from the train
in the afternoon.

711
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:54,681
I enquired how his visit
to Kolkata was!

712
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:55,881
He was a witty man.

713
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,321
He replied people don't visit
Kolkata. They just go.

714
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:01,721
The same man will die some time
later.. - Yes..

715
00:55:01,761 --> 00:55:04,041
Do you remember what he carried
while he went to Kolkata?

716
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:08,121
Yes, I do. He had a steel trunk,
bedding and bag.

717
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:09,441
He always carried these things
while travelling.

718
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:11,641
What did he carry on
returning? - Returning..

719
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:18,881
No, he didn't have the steel trunk
while returning. Why do you ask so?

720
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,841
Do you know what his trunk
contained?

721
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:29,041
Oh, the trunk was..

722
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:31,281
Nafar Kundu's sacks..

723
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:33,801
What?
- Mr. Manotosh, come here please.

724
00:55:33,841 --> 00:55:36,081
I've got work. Give me a minute.
I have some work there.

725
00:55:36,161 --> 00:55:37,721
Work!
- Yes.

726
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,521
Check it well.
There mustn't be any mistake.

727
00:55:41,561 --> 00:55:44,681
Nafar Kundu's sack..
- Softly. Speak softly.

728
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,721
Let's go have tea.
- Keep the sacks there.

729
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:49,441
Tea!
Let's go.

730
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:52,841
Two cups of tea, please.
- Okay.

731
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:57,241
This tea is from my plantation.
Have it. You'll like it.

732
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,241
Good morning, Mr. Bakshi.
- Good morning.

733
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:04,321
What brings you here?

734
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:08,721
Are you looking for arms
at the station? - No.

735
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:10,521
We both have come out
for a walk.

736
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:14,121
Of course. You are a guest
in our state.

737
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,721
You will have a good trip
at the State's expense and return.

738
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:17,601
It suits you.

739
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,201
By the way someone got murdered
here. Do you know of it?

740
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:25,801
You got it wrong. - Two
people have been murdered.

741
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:29,081
A boy named Amrit
and Sadananda Sur has been killed.

742
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:31,801
Do you know them?
- By Jove, no.

743
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:36,081
I don't mingle with these
cheap idiots.

744
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:40,241
I should consider that you have
nothing to do with illegal arms.

745
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:46,761
Do you know Nafar Kundu? Do
you know Jamuna Das Gangaram?

746
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:49,401
You don't know anyone.
Yet you're here to investigate.

747
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:55,961
Mr. Bakshi, Nafar Kundu's good
pass by the railways.

748
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,401
No one cares to check it. Okay.
Good day, Mr. Bakshi.

749
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:01,561
What about your sacks of tea,
being sent to Kolkata!

750
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:03,441
Is it checked?

751
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,841
Your attitude speaks otherwise.

752
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,721
We'll leave, Mr. Das.

753
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,481
Mr. Ajit.
- Yes.

754
00:57:55,521 --> 00:57:58,201
When will the case end?
- End!

755
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:01,441
We are beating about the bush.
We didn't even start.

756
00:58:02,201 --> 00:58:06,721
In the forest episode, do you know
in which river Kunti put Karna in?

757
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:09,921
It was Ashwa river.

758
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:13,521
Strange! We are dealing
in episodes of horses too.

759
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:14,721
It was river Ashwa
in 'Mahabharata'

760
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:16,401
and it's a black horse here.

761
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:19,081
I'll go mad.

762
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:22,601
He doesn't have time to talk
to me.

763
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:26,161
I have asked him to get me
hair oil ever since we came here.

764
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:30,921
Look at him. He has set up
his world in the bottle of perfume.

765
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:02,241
I will go to Kolkata.
I'll go alone.

766
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:07,561
What? - You'll leave us
here in this unknown land!

767
00:59:07,561 --> 00:59:09,041
What will I do now?

768
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:19,321
A well-stocked mind is free
from boredom.

769
00:59:22,681 --> 00:59:24,201
There are many books here,
Satya.

770
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,241
Read them.
You'll have a good time.

771
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:34,161
I have been appointed by the
government for this case.

772
00:59:34,921 --> 00:59:36,601
This is my responsibility
towards my nation.

773
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:41,881
If you refuse, I'll lose all
respect. Do you wish for that?

774
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,241
Did I mean that!

775
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,641
It would've been different
had you had an ordinary job.

776
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:57,601
Have a safe journey.
Okay! Don't make us worry.

777
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:04,641
What should I tell Mr. Sukhomoy?

778
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:06,121
What should I tell him
of your whereabouts?

779
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:14,761
Tell him I have gone
for hibernation.

780
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:55,721
Come this way.

781
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,001
You have to provide me
an information.

782
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:32,961
Did anyone by the name
of Sadananda Sur, come here?

783
01:02:35,561 --> 01:02:37,761
He is from the rural areas.
He has a mole on his cheek.

784
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:39,401
He has been here even
few days back.

785
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:46,561
Yes.
- Where did he come to?

786
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:48,681
A man with a mole on his cheek

787
01:02:49,121 --> 01:02:50,201
has been visiting us
for the past few months.

788
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:53,201
Whom did he meet here?
- He used to meet Gulab.

789
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:56,561
Gulab..
- Come along. - Okay.

790
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:10,281
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

791
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:13,961
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

792
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:18,041
"My lord, if you don't visit me"

793
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:21,681
"I shed tears and feel saddened."

794
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:25,801
"Don't reject a loving heart."

795
01:03:25,841 --> 01:03:33,441
"Don't reject a loving heart.
Let the eyes meet."

796
01:03:33,481 --> 01:03:37,721
"My young body craves for you."

797
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:45,601
"The heart lusts and craves for
you. My young body craves for you."

798
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:50,081
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

799
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:08,601
"You are a jolly person, sir
and so am I."

800
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:12,801
"You are a jolly person,
sir and so am I."

801
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:20,241
"Elope with me, sweetheart.
Elope with me, sweetheart."

802
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:24,241
"I'll sway my hips to the tunes."

803
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:31,881
"I'll sway my hips
to the tunes."

804
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:35,961
"I'll sway my hips to the tunes."

805
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,881
"I'll sway my hips
to the tunes."

806
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:43,721
"Let your heart be as deadly
as snake venom."

807
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:47,681
"Let your heart be as
deadly as snake venom."

808
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,721
"Your love.."

809
01:04:51,641 --> 01:04:55,721
"Your love has trapped me."

810
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:59,881
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

811
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:17,241
"The heart lusts
and craves for you."

812
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:20,921
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

813
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:24,961
"My lord, if you don't visit me"

814
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:28,721
"I shed tears and feel saddened."

815
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:32,401
"Don't reject a loving heart."

816
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:36,481
"Let the eyes meet."

817
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:40,441
"My young body craves for you."

818
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:44,161
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

819
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:48,521
"My young body craves for you."

820
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:52,961
"The heart lusts and craves
for you."

821
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:55,481
Wow! What a performance!
- Great!

822
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:58,241
No one visits at this hour
without informing, sir.

823
01:05:59,241 --> 01:06:02,601
Yes, I need something
from you.

824
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:06,681
Tell me, what you want.

825
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:11,361
Sadananda mentions you
quite often.

826
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:15,241
Who is Sadananda?
- Sadananda Sur.

827
01:06:15,441 --> 01:06:18,361
He has a mole on his cheek.

828
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:22,401
Yes..
He visits me.

829
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,201
He comes with a friend
named Dinesh.

830
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:35,321
Mr. Dinesh Baral!
- Yes.

831
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:37,801
It's Dinesh Baral who is regular
at the racing fields.

832
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:43,161
How do you know Sadananda?

833
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:46,281
He is doing all these here.

834
01:06:46,321 --> 01:06:48,921
His wife gets cross
whenever he bets on races.

835
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:52,161
Oh my God! He is a married man!
- Yes.

836
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,841
He is such a wicked man.
- Why?

837
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:59,641
Yes, who tells the truth
to a mistress like me!

838
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:02,201
Sadanand lied to me.

839
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:05,321
He said he has only a sister.

840
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:09,961
He said he has no one else
for family. - Yes, he has a trunk.

841
01:07:12,921 --> 01:07:14,801
You'll be staying here,
right?

842
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:19,841
Yes, for a day.

843
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:22,041
Move aside.

844
01:07:23,841 --> 01:07:26,761
What's the matter!
- There's always some issue.

845
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,081
We are fed up. We have
to manage it somehow.

846
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:31,201
Anyway I am here for you all.
- I'll leave, sir.

847
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:35,481
Then it will be done.
- Yes, you needn't worry.

848
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:40,401
It will be as you say.
- It will be either four or five.

849
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:43,161
Okay..
- I was thinking of it too.

850
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,881
I'll leave, sir.
- Yes.

851
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:53,641
Whom did you bet on?
- Yes?

852
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:56,641
Whom did you bet on? - I am
a happy go lucky person.

853
01:07:56,681 --> 01:07:58,361
I bet on the horse who stood first
last time.

854
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,241
Black Prince was better.

855
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:04,441
No, Dinesh advised me.
So I played double gamble.

856
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:06,761
Who is Dinesh?
- Dinesh Baral.

857
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:12,561
You bet on a horse
abiding by Dinesh's words!

858
01:08:14,161 --> 01:08:16,961
He and his jockey,
both are wasted. - Jockey!

859
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:20,081
Jockey..
It's his friend.

860
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,201
He mingled with..

861
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:25,361
Where is Dinesh?
I didn't spot him around.

862
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:30,281
Where he must be!
He lays intoxicated, by the stable.

863
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:35,041
However.. - Hey, mister.
I owe you.

864
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,401
Who is it?
- Police.

865
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:49,201
Answer me properly.

866
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:52,321
Do you know Sadanada Sur?

867
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,961
Yes, I know him.

868
01:08:57,361 --> 01:08:59,241
He was regular at the
racing field, right?

869
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:02,801
Yes, he visited once or twice
every month.

870
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,601
He used to bet on horses.

871
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,121
He used to bet on the horses
as per my suggestion.

872
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:10,281
He used to lose sometimes.
He won too.

873
01:09:10,321 --> 01:09:11,761
How did he get the money?

874
01:09:55,201 --> 01:09:57,921
If you try acting over smart
you'll end up in jail.

875
01:09:59,881 --> 01:10:00,921
How did he get the money?

876
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:04,121
I-I don't know, sir.

877
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:12,081
I'll tell you.. He got the
money from a friend of his.

878
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:16,521
Which friend? - His
name is Badrinath Das.

879
01:10:16,681 --> 01:10:21,521
Sir, he got Sadananda
here. - Badrinath Das!

880
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,521
How long has he been visiting
this place?

881
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:32,441
Why should he come here?
The race course was home to him.

882
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:36,761
Y-Yes, sir.
He was a reputed jockey.

883
01:10:37,201 --> 01:10:39,201
The horse performed excellently
under him.

884
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:44,201
Y-yes, he left everything
behind and went away, suddenly.

885
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:46,761
He returned
about five years later.

886
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,481
He owned tea plantations by then.

887
01:10:50,481 --> 01:10:52,921
There was another man
from Sadananda village.

888
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:56,241
He races two horses.
He comes here too.

889
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:01,441
His name is Biswanath Mallick.

890
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:11,161
He'll return soon, right!
- Yes.

891
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:18,441
Had it been that I could've
reached

892
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:20,481
you via phone, everywhere!

893
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:21,721
How would it have been?

894
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:24,841
You are reading too much
of Arthur C Clarke.

895
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:26,641
It's science fiction.

896
01:11:27,561 --> 01:11:29,441
People will be on the phone
on the move!

897
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:32,961
Wouldn't it have been great?
- It would've been great.

898
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:36,281
Then the wait would've been
worth it.

899
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:39,081
Good morning. - There he is.
- You are done with hibernation!

900
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:43,961
Yes, it's done.
Did you start writing? - No..

901
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:47,801
I'll have tea. - I'll make tea.
- Should I make tea for you too?

902
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:50,041
Yes. - Here you are.
- My goodness.

903
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:54,601
You mustn't be getting
it here. - Oh! I feel relieved.

904
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:59,401
Did you find out something?
- Everyone seems to be a suspect.

905
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:02,761
Badrinath was a jockey.

906
01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:05,001
He introduced Sadananda
to the racing fields.

907
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,921
Dinesh Baral met him
via Badrinath. - Oh!

908
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,921
He said he doesn't even
know Sadananda. - Wait.

909
01:12:10,961 --> 01:12:14,081
It's not the end here. Biswanath
Mallick has two of his horses

910
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:17,721
running the races.
- What are you saying! - Yes.

911
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,761
Who knows who is concealed
where like Meghnad!

912
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,801
Where did I visit?
- Kolkata.

913
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:30,841
No, I mean what did Satya tell
them?

914
01:12:31,721 --> 01:12:34,881
You had asked her to tell Sukhomoy
that you are hibernating.

915
01:12:40,641 --> 01:12:44,801
What's the matter!
- Something had taken place!

916
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:53,641
Hello.
- Yes, hold on. He's here.

917
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:55,161
Someone is asking for you.

918
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:04,201
Hello. - Hello, Mr. Byomkesh.
This is Biswanath Mallick.

919
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:06,761
Are you busy? - Yes
say, Mr. Mallick.

920
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:12,241
Can you meet me today
at 4 p.m. at European Club?

921
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,841
I need to talk to you.

922
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,321
Good shot!
- Thank you.

923
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:24,001
I called you here for something
important.

924
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:27,441
I don't know if you are
aware of it.

925
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,961
Are you talking of the two horses
that run the races?

926
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:35,761
My goodness!
You surprised me.

927
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:38,281
How did you come to know
of it?

928
01:13:38,521 --> 01:13:40,961
There are many things we need
to find out, Mr. Mallick.

929
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:44,601
Now tell me. What do you
want to let me know?

930
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:49,161
I.. - Mr. Mallick, have you joined
the cops?

931
01:13:49,881 --> 01:13:53,081
You're finding arms
in European Club!

932
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:56,281
I don't know why Jamuna
is not here yet!

933
01:13:57,281 --> 01:14:00,201
I think we can't talk here.
- Give me tea.

934
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:04,081
There's a desolated cemetery
nearby. We can have a word there..

935
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:07,961
Hey, you seeker of truth. Did you
proceed with the investigation?

936
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:13,281
Do you need more chances? - You'll
get to know when the bomb blasts!

937
01:14:13,641 --> 01:14:14,441
Let's go.

938
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:27,241
This isn't very well-maintained.
This cemetery has a history.

939
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,961
You didn't bring me here to tell
me of the history, Mr. Mallick.

940
01:14:31,521 --> 01:14:36,361
You're right. - I don't
know how to convey it to you!

941
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:42,241
Sadananda met me before going
to Kolkata.

942
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:46,801
He said something which I didn't
pay attention to, back then.

943
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:49,761
Now, after his death, it feels..

944
01:14:52,761 --> 01:14:57,201
He said he saw a black horse
in the forest.

945
01:14:57,441 --> 01:15:02,201
Yes.
- He saw a bodiless man

946
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:06,961
on the horse
dressed in black.

947
01:15:07,321 --> 01:15:09,721
Do you believe in spirits?
- No, it's not that.

948
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:13,241
What exactly he witnessed..
- Who owns black horses here?

949
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:17,041
I have four horses.
One is chestnut and the other one

950
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:18,441
is white. The rest two..

951
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,641
They are at the racing course
in Kolkata.

952
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:25,001
Yes. - Here only one person owns
a black horse.

953
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:26,601
That's Sukumar Samanta.

954
01:15:29,201 --> 01:15:32,441
That's not a ghost, Mr. Biswanath.
It's some human being.

955
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:36,761
To ride a horse
in the forest darkness..

956
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:40,801
It's quite difficult. - Yes.
- If the man is experienced..

957
01:15:44,121 --> 01:15:47,201
Do you know why Badrinath Das
gave up being a jockey?

958
01:15:50,041 --> 01:15:52,641
He lost a race on purpose
for a large amount of money.

959
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:58,401
He came here and bought
tea estates with the money.

960
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,401
He settled down here.

961
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:02,641
He introduced Sadananda
to the racing fields.

962
01:16:03,201 --> 01:16:05,201
Isn't the friendship weird?

963
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:08,161
No, it's not weird if they
have a give and take policy.

964
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:11,681
They may be of use to each other
while dealing in illegal arms.

965
01:16:13,441 --> 01:16:17,161
I should've informed
you earlier. Come.

966
01:16:18,481 --> 01:16:19,281
Thank you.

967
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:30,241
Do you wish

968
01:16:30,321 --> 01:16:31,801
to let Sukhomoy Samanta
of Badrinath Das?

969
01:16:36,481 --> 01:16:38,241
How strange it is here!

970
01:16:38,521 --> 01:16:40,881
It's sunny one moment
and raining the next.

971
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,961
I hope everything's fine. - You
all have a word. I'll be back.

972
01:16:58,961 --> 01:16:59,801
Okay.

973
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,281
You aren't available these days.

974
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:11,001
You aren't reporting me
of your whereabouts.

975
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:13,881
Sadananda Sur was killed by a hand
grenade, right?

976
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:20,041
Yes, I know, you've been
to Bagmari.

977
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:23,481
I had asked you not to go
anywhere without informing me.

978
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:27,361
Why? Who do you
think you are?

979
01:17:27,961 --> 01:17:31,161
I am a police officer
here. - Yes, maybe you are.

980
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:34,441
You have no right to dictate me,
Inspector.

981
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:38,241
The government has appointed me.

982
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:41,601
You are not helping me at all.

983
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:45,521
You are continuously causing
hindrances. I am warning you.

984
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:01,441
If I find you behaving awkwardly,
I'll have you fired.

985
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:05,281
No..
Hey, why should I cause hindrances?

986
01:18:05,321 --> 01:18:08,441
You investigate as you
wish to. Investigate.

987
01:18:09,121 --> 01:18:12,321
Who has horses in this village?
- Horses..

988
01:18:12,361 --> 01:18:16,961
Badrinath Das, Biswanath Mallick
and Jamuna Das own horses.

989
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:20,921
Who owns a black horse?
- I own it. Why do you ask so?

990
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:25,761
Don't you know why? A bodiless man
roams the forest on a black horse.

991
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:30,921
Forest.. - I hope you understand.
I suspect you too.

992
01:18:32,761 --> 01:18:34,521
Where is Amrit's post mortem
report?

993
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:38,681
Yes. He has been shot
with a bullet of point 38 calibre.

994
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:41,361
Excellent! It's
point 38 calibre.

995
01:18:41,401 --> 01:18:44,801
Ajit! Wasn't it used during
the wars? - Yes, of course.

996
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:48,881
Do you know of Sadananda's sister?

997
01:18:48,961 --> 01:18:52,721
I'll have to ask.
- Ask Sadananda? - No, why him?

998
01:18:52,801 --> 01:18:54,641
I have to find out.
- You must.

999
01:18:56,881 --> 01:19:00,201
Both Sadananda and Amrit have been
killed for illegal arms.

1000
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:04,601
Is it due to enmity?
- Amrit had worked

1001
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:07,721
for a few days for Badrinath,
Biswanath

1002
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:10,521
and Jamuna.

1003
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,281
He used to be kicked out
due to his weird behaviour.

1004
01:19:14,761 --> 01:19:19,081
Sadananda was into business.
He used to sell digestive pills.

1005
01:19:19,361 --> 01:19:20,721
Nothing more than this..

1006
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:25,041
It's an ancestral house
yet the condition is pathetic.

1007
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:29,841
Despite this, Sadananda used
to visit a place in Kolkata.

1008
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:32,361
Despite having courage and desire
visiting the place

1009
01:19:32,401 --> 01:19:35,241
is beyond your economical limits.

1010
01:19:38,161 --> 01:19:41,841
How did Sadananda manage such huge
amount for entertainment?

1011
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:49,321
'Jhalmuri'.. - Here you are.
You asked for me?

1012
01:19:49,361 --> 01:19:50,841
I need to have a word with you.

1013
01:19:50,921 --> 01:19:52,681
I don't get to leave
this place so..

1014
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:55,601
Yes, say. - I couldn't
tell you, that day.

1015
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:58,081
Sadananda has a relative here.

1016
01:19:58,121 --> 01:20:00,041
It's a few stations from here
at Ramdighi.

1017
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:04,601
The trunk you mentioned
might be with them.

1018
01:20:05,161 --> 01:20:06,921
What do you mean by relatives!
- No, it's okay.

1019
01:20:06,961 --> 01:20:09,761
His name is Prankesto.
He is Sadananda's brother-in-law.

1020
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:11,161
What kind of a human being is he!

1021
01:20:11,201 --> 01:20:13,281
He didn't even visit here
when his brother-in-law died.

1022
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:14,761
It made me really cross..

1023
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:17,641
There he is, no sooner
than I spoke of him.

1024
01:20:17,681 --> 01:20:19,521
Is it him?
- Yes. He is Prankesto.

1025
01:20:19,601 --> 01:20:20,761
Sadananda's brother-in-law.

1026
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:24,081
He is a line inspector. Just
a minute. Hey, Mr. Prankesto.

1027
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:27,561
What's the matter! You didn't
come when Sadananda died.

1028
01:20:27,641 --> 01:20:29,081
The police burnt his dead body.

1029
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:31,281
Why should I come?
Don't I have work!

1030
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:34,201
The one who was here, died.
Would he return!

1031
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:37,361
He is speaking rubbish!
Hey, move on.. We are late.

1032
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:44,441
How strange! He doesn't mourn
his brother-in-law's death.

1033
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,001
Where does this man stay?
- He stays at Ramdighi,

1034
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:51,441
near the junction.
- Oh. Fine. We'll leave. - Okay.

1035
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:04,641
Is Mr. Biswanath Mallick here?

1036
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:07,681
You all wait for some time. Sir
has gone out. He'll be back soon.

1037
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:10,241
Who are you? - Yes?
- How long have you been here?

1038
01:21:10,361 --> 01:21:12,201
I have been here since
donkey's years.

1039
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,921
You must be knowing Sadananda Sur.
- Yes, I do know him.

1040
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:20,321
He used to visit sir, at times
to sell pills for dyslexia.

1041
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:22,721
When did he last visit
this place? - Last..

1042
01:21:23,721 --> 01:21:27,841
How does he run his business?
- The business runs..

1043
01:21:27,921 --> 01:21:31,161
He borrowed Rs. 1,000
from sir, few days back.

1044
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:33,801
He respects sir, a lot.

1045
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:36,361
Who asked you to speak
so much, Nilkantha?

1046
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:40,481
Go, get tea for them.
Come.

1047
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:45,761
You can't find the arms!

1048
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:48,361
I believe they are still
at Santhalgola.

1049
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:52,201
Search the places you wish to.

1050
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,881
Yes, I was thinking of doing
the same.

1051
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,281
Did Sadananda borrow money
from you?

1052
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:00,761
Nilkantha speaks too much.

1053
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:04,281
Yes, he begged for money.

1054
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,761
He said he owes money to people
in Kolkata and is unable to pay.

1055
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:10,361
I told him I can give him the
money but he has to return it.

1056
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:14,481
He used to carry a trunk
to Kolkata.

1057
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:16,521
Trunk!

1058
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:21,641
Oh. He used that to..

1059
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:26,921
Before I came here, the trunk was
used to..

1060
01:22:28,241 --> 01:22:29,681
May I say something?

1061
01:22:29,801 --> 01:22:33,241
Get a search warrant.
The truth will be revealed.

1062
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:38,481
Mr. Biswanath, the problem is
the arms aren't in the houses.

1063
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:39,801
Oh!

1064
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:52,881
Have you read Mr. Bipin Lahiri?

1065
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:58,121
'Gulmohar' is the king of trees.
The banyan tree is blessed.

1066
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:02,041
The running forests has set up
a trap, laden with uncanniness.

1067
01:23:02,481 --> 01:23:04,761
Darkness prevails on the land
even during the day.

1068
01:23:05,121 --> 01:23:07,641
The nights are cautious.

1069
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,561
That's great.

1070
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,841
Search the forests.
Employ people to do so.

1071
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:15,201
I'll co-operate with you
on all terms. - Make it fast.

1072
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,881
I might search the forests
tomorrow or day after.

1073
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:19,721
Fine.
- This place is beautiful.

1074
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:22,761
Do you find something new,
Mr. Ajit?

1075
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:25,641
No, I was studying
the 'Mahabharata'.

1076
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:26,801
I didn't lay my hand on something.

1077
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:30,521
'Mahabharata'! That's great.
It's one of my favourite books.

1078
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:35,121
I haven't informed you
but my wife wishes to meet

1079
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:36,921
you once again.

1080
01:23:37,001 --> 01:23:40,841
That can be done, any day.
- Satyabati would love to meet you.

1081
01:23:40,921 --> 01:23:44,321
Are you free this evening?
- Today evening! - We can meet up.

1082
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:45,361
Thank you so much.

1083
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:51,081
I pray to God that you rescue
Santhalgola from this.

1084
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:54,521
It is possible only if the arms
are in the jungles.

1085
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:57,201
I'll see you in the evening.

1086
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:17,241
Wow! This Bengali man has
distorted his name.

1087
01:24:17,281 --> 01:24:18,521
He has written it
as Badri. N. Dos.

1088
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:20,921
He has distorted the name
beyond fixation.

1089
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:23,361
Hey, mister.

1090
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,601
Greetings, Mr. Badrinath.

1091
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,961
I had to inquire
regarding few things.

1092
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:40,121
You were a jockey at the race
course! - Yes, I gave that up.

1093
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:43,521
What! Why? - It's my wish.
- Did you know Amrit?

1094
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:47,401
Yes. - Did you know
Sadananda Sur? - No. - Is it?

1095
01:24:50,281 --> 01:24:51,961
Do you have a black horse?

1096
01:24:54,921 --> 01:24:57,641
I have two brown and three
white horses.

1097
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,681
Horse is my favourite animal.

1098
01:25:04,081 --> 01:25:05,801
The day Amrit died

1099
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:08,361
you had visited
Bagmari jungle for bird hunting.

1100
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:11,401
Listen, Mr. Bakshi.

1101
01:25:13,961 --> 01:25:15,841
If I aim at birds, they die.

1102
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:19,041
If I wish to kill human beings
they die too.

1103
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:24,521
I had gone to the forests
to hunt birds. - Excellent.

1104
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:29,561
By the way, let me tell you,
we are getting the search warrants.

1105
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:35,961
I have a mouser pistol,
Mr. Bakshi. It's licensed.

1106
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:40,721
I can aim in the dark too.
I never miss the target.

1107
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,041
Exactly like it didn't miss Amrit
that day.

1108
01:25:46,081 --> 01:25:49,841
Good bye, Mr. Bakshi.
Please..

1109
01:25:58,081 --> 01:26:02,721
Sir, few men are like waste
to mankind.

1110
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:06,081
The man was a jockey at the race
course, once upon a time.

1111
01:26:07,721 --> 01:26:09,281
He aims perfectly.

1112
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:14,801
It's easy for Badrinath to ride
a horse in darkness.

1113
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:18,921
Don't you think the missing
pieces are fitting in too easily.

1114
01:26:20,201 --> 01:26:21,001
That's good.

1115
01:26:21,481 --> 01:26:23,601
Since it's fitting in, why do we
need to search the jungles!

1116
01:26:23,641 --> 01:26:25,921
No, I just mentioned it
to Mr. Biswanath.

1117
01:26:27,161 --> 01:26:28,441
It's such a huge forest.

1118
01:26:28,481 --> 01:26:30,401
I can't dig up the forest
to search for arms.

1119
01:26:32,881 --> 01:26:35,121
There are four people
associated with Sadananda.

1120
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:39,441
There's Badrinath Das, Jamuna Das,
Nafar Kundu and Biswanath Mallick.

1121
01:26:39,481 --> 01:26:43,241
There's rice, mutton and
sweet dish. - Wow! That's great.

1122
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,041
Is it fine?
- The night's made.

1123
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:49,521
Why are you treating Mr. Mallick
so well?

1124
01:26:52,601 --> 01:26:54,281
If I don't manage the internal
affairs how do I search

1125
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:58,121
for the arms outside?
She'll get a partner to chat with.

1126
01:26:58,161 --> 01:27:00,241
We would be free to concentrate
on the case.

1127
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:05,201
You are capable of these
things! I'll get up.

1128
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:09,961
It would be a sin not to sleep
now. A hectic episode is up next.

1129
01:27:10,961 --> 01:27:13,081
Hectic episode! - Yes. - The
Pandavas have set out already.

1130
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:14,761
They have disguised themselves
and adopted pseudo names.

1131
01:27:36,361 --> 01:27:39,001
Sir. - Hey, the food is delicious.
- Excellent.

1132
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:43,841
Have you made it all? - No,
Basanti helped me too.

1133
01:27:43,921 --> 01:27:45,841
I am totally fed up here.
- Enough..

1134
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:47,761
I at least got something
to do.

1135
01:27:47,921 --> 01:27:49,641
Mr. Byomkesh.
- Yes.

1136
01:27:49,921 --> 01:27:52,681
Now you have to visit
our place. - One..

1137
01:27:52,961 --> 01:27:55,481
Yes, we can visit it. However, let
me be done with the investigation.

1138
01:27:55,841 --> 01:28:00,441
It can be done later.
Let us go out somewhere tomorrow.

1139
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:01,721
I-I am ready for it.

1140
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,881
This is such a wonderful evening.
Won't there be some music!

1141
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:10,481
Yes, this is a great proposal.
- My wife sings very well.

1142
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:12,401
She has been trained in music
under a British governess.

1143
01:28:12,481 --> 01:28:14,241
She doesn't sing if you ask
her to. You need to request her.

1144
01:28:14,321 --> 01:28:16,641
You..
- Now it is your choice.

1145
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:29,921
"There's sunshine on the mountains
and a breeze that calls to me."

1146
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:37,681
"There's a heart that beats
forever. It says, come be free."

1147
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:44,561
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1148
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:52,041
"The heart flows with time.
He is waiting for you."

1149
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:59,201
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1150
01:28:59,241 --> 01:29:06,761
"The heart beats to the rhythm
of the southern winds."

1151
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:14,081
"Oh what dreams adorn your eyes,
lady."

1152
01:29:14,321 --> 01:29:21,281
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1153
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:28,481
"I know not where I wander.
Your light shines true for me."

1154
01:29:28,561 --> 01:29:35,121
"You hold my hand through
darkness and say, come be free."

1155
01:29:43,401 --> 01:29:50,281
"My beloved.. Where is my beloved?
Where is my beloved, they ask."

1156
01:29:50,361 --> 01:29:54,521
"The hearts bond over care."

1157
01:29:54,561 --> 01:30:01,441
"The hearts bond over care."

1158
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:08,601
"He touches me in my dreams
and enchants me."

1159
01:30:08,921 --> 01:30:12,041
"he enchants me."

1160
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:19,241
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1161
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:26,401
"The heart flows with time.
He is waiting for you."

1162
01:30:26,481 --> 01:30:34,161
"The heart beats to the rhythm
of the southern winds."

1163
01:30:34,361 --> 01:30:41,401
"Oh what dreams adorn your eyes,
lady."

1164
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:48,841
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1165
01:30:48,881 --> 01:30:56,841
"Hey lady, open the doors.
He is waiting for you."

1166
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:03,321
I don't know what goes
on, on your mind!

1167
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:05,521
Suddenly why do you want
to search the jungle tomorrow?

1168
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:07,801
I'll be ending the hibernation.
- You speak in riddles again.

1169
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:09,801
Okay. I won't speak in riddles.

1170
01:31:10,121 --> 01:31:12,001
Tell me the Bengali term for the
flora called 'Somigach' locally.

1171
01:31:12,081 --> 01:31:14,121
'Somigach'! - Yes. - Tell
quickly. - It's a thorny plant..

1172
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:16,481
Are you off to somewhere?
- Yes.

1173
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,521
We are going to Ramdighi.
I've got some work there.

1174
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:19,561
What are you doing here?

1175
01:31:19,601 --> 01:31:22,121
I am here for your client.
- Who?

1176
01:31:22,401 --> 01:31:23,361
I am here for Nafar Kundu.

1177
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:25,921
He was exporting sacks of rice.

1178
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:28,841
One of the bags burst out
and it had two kilos of opium.

1179
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:29,881
Great!
- Two kilos of opium!

1180
01:31:29,961 --> 01:31:31,641
I am here regarding this matter.

1181
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:33,801
Excellent.
It's good that I met you.

1182
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:35,241
Tomorrow we'll search the jungle.

1183
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:38,841
I believe the arms are there.
- Jungle.. - Yes.

1184
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:42,041
We'll return late, tonight.
It'll be almost 10 p.m.

1185
01:31:42,321 --> 01:31:43,601
We'll begin it tomorrow,
early morning.

1186
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:46,881
Kindly don't let everyone
know of this.

1187
01:31:48,561 --> 01:31:49,801
Fine, I'll arrange for it.

1188
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:05,681
He'll tell it to everyone.
- That's exactly why I told him.

1189
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:09,281
Let's go.
- Oh!

1190
01:32:13,401 --> 01:32:15,201
Where are you off to?
- We are going to Ramdighi.

1191
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:16,241
We want to question Ramakrishna.

1192
01:32:16,401 --> 01:32:19,401
Yes, we'll be searching
the Bagmari jungle tomorrow.

1193
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:20,761
The arms are there!

1194
01:32:20,961 --> 01:32:22,481
Do you have any idea about it?
- No.

1195
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:25,121
I was commenting casually..

1196
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:26,601
When will you return?

1197
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,521
I'll return late tonight.
I'll leave now. - Okay.

1198
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:35,081
Two tickets to Ramdighi, please.
- Three anas, please.

1199
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:51,241
Has the third world war began,
Mr. Nafar?

1200
01:32:52,081 --> 01:32:53,801
You've exploded the bomb.

1201
01:32:59,121 --> 01:33:02,881
Damn the fool.
This man vexes me.

1202
01:33:03,081 --> 01:33:04,001
He'll rot in jail
for a few days.

1203
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:05,361
That's Mr. Badrinath.
- Oh, no.

1204
01:33:05,441 --> 01:33:07,041
It's good that we met you here.

1205
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:09,561
We'll search the jungles
tomorrow.

1206
01:33:09,601 --> 01:33:11,641
Be careful.
- Why?

1207
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:14,161
It'll be tough for the hunter
to accept himself as the victim.

1208
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:18,441
You are here too.

1209
01:33:19,161 --> 01:33:21,441
Mr. Nafar Kundu has been arrested.
I guess you know that. - Yes.

1210
01:33:22,201 --> 01:33:23,961
Are you off to somewhere?
- We are going to Ramdighi.

1211
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,081
Oh, why?

1212
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:27,761
Sadananda's sister
and brother-in-law stays there.

1213
01:33:27,841 --> 01:33:30,281
Oh.
- We want to enquire.

1214
01:33:30,961 --> 01:33:32,321
We'll return late, tonight.

1215
01:33:32,601 --> 01:33:33,521
We'll return around 10 p.m.
Isn't it so Ajit!

1216
01:33:33,561 --> 01:33:37,641
Yes. Oh, by the way,
we'll search the jungles tomorrow.

1217
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:40,121
It should be kept a secret,
keep in mind.

1218
01:33:40,441 --> 01:33:43,681
Good. I'll help
with the search too. - Okay.

1219
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:45,521
I'll leave. I need to collect
a 'challan'. - Okay.

1220
01:33:50,761 --> 01:33:52,841
The centre stage has been lit
brightly.

1221
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:56,721
The main characters are all
present on stage one after another.

1222
01:33:58,281 --> 01:34:02,841
Some have worn mask and some are
disguised as knights on horses.

1223
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,281
Why were we discussing the plant
locally called 'Somigach'?

1224
01:34:13,761 --> 01:34:16,241
Where did the Pandavas
hide their weapons during the war?

1225
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:17,841
Arms..

1226
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:29,561
We are near Bagmari.

1227
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:31,201
Where have we stopped?

1228
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:34,361
Byomkesh. Hey, where are
you going? - Excuse me.

1229
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:36,841
Hey, Byomkesh.

1230
01:34:38,601 --> 01:34:41,161
Go to Ramdighi and enquire
Prankesto. - Okay.

1231
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:43,921
Ask him where the trunk is.
Don't be afraid.

1232
01:34:44,001 --> 01:34:44,921
Yes, you..

1233
01:35:01,681 --> 01:35:03,641
Mr. Prankesto.
- Yes.

1234
01:35:03,721 --> 01:35:04,961
I had to have a word with you.

1235
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:09,001
How have you been?

1236
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:12,361
Yes, I am good.
- I am Ajit Bandhopadhya.

1237
01:35:12,401 --> 01:35:14,721
I am a cop.
- What!

1238
01:35:16,441 --> 01:35:18,601
The death of your brother-in-law
is sad.

1239
01:35:19,961 --> 01:35:21,961
You must be in pain.
- Yes?

1240
01:35:23,521 --> 01:35:25,361
Yes, of course.

1241
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:28,641
Will all of Sadananda's properties
be handed over to your wife?

1242
01:35:30,761 --> 01:35:32,081
What?
- Properties.

1243
01:35:33,161 --> 01:35:35,001
Properties..
- S-Sheila.

1244
01:35:37,241 --> 01:35:39,681
Sushila.
- When did he come here last?

1245
01:35:41,321 --> 01:35:43,801
Hey, you.
Last..

1246
01:35:43,841 --> 01:35:45,321
I can't remember anything.

1247
01:35:45,361 --> 01:35:46,761
He was here about 10 to 15 days
back.

1248
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:52,681
No.
No..

1249
01:35:56,441 --> 01:36:00,601
This way.
Mr. Byomkesh.

1250
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:03,281
You are here.
- You are here.

1251
01:36:03,361 --> 01:36:04,241
Pay attention.

1252
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:07,001
The three men, Jamuna Das,
Badrinath Das, Biswanath Mallick.

1253
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:10,241
Their bungalow, and business

1254
01:36:10,321 --> 01:36:12,321
should be under strict
surveillance. - Okay.

1255
01:36:12,521 --> 01:36:15,521
They all know we'll be searching
the Bagmari Jungle tomorrow.

1256
01:36:15,601 --> 01:36:17,161
I am not at Santalgola today.

1257
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:20,601
The criminal will go the jungle
tonight to get his arms back.

1258
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:23,921
Get back the arms from the
jungle.. - Arms from the jungle!

1259
01:36:24,801 --> 01:36:28,641
Why would a man roam about the
forest on a horse in darkness!

1260
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:33,081
Gather the rest of your friends
and get divided in small groups.

1261
01:36:33,281 --> 01:36:34,601
Keep an eye on their homes
and workplace.

1262
01:36:34,681 --> 01:36:38,001
Keep an eye on the visitors too.

1263
01:36:38,441 --> 01:36:40,201
Go for now. I'll instruct
you further.

1264
01:36:40,241 --> 01:36:41,841
Be careful while doing this.
- Okay. - Go.

1265
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:44,401
We are leaving, Mr. Byomkesh.
- Let's go..

1266
01:36:46,521 --> 01:36:47,841
Why are you getting nervous?

1267
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,241
Answer my question properly.

1268
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:54,241
Didn't Sadananda leave behind a
trunk before leaving for Kolkata?

1269
01:36:55,721 --> 01:36:57,361
Trunk!
- Yes.

1270
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:01,481
Trust me, I don't know anything.

1271
01:37:02,321 --> 01:37:04,321
I have digestion issues.

1272
01:37:04,721 --> 01:37:08,161
I can't remember anything
due to cataract in my early years.

1273
01:37:08,441 --> 01:37:09,641
You are changing the topic.

1274
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:11,761
Why are you getting nervous!

1275
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:13,441
Where is the trunk?

1276
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:17,161
My husband is a coward.
He gets scared by strangers.

1277
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:18,801
Speak to me.

1278
01:37:19,241 --> 01:37:21,641
If someone dies, are we supposed
to take its responsibility!

1279
01:37:22,361 --> 01:37:24,801
Sadananda didn't leave behind any
trunk ort anything else.

1280
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:26,401
You may leave now.

1281
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:28,521
Okay.
- We too are close to the cops.

1282
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,921
Ma'am.
- Yes, Basanti. Tell me.

1283
01:37:35,761 --> 01:37:37,761
Someone is asking for sir.

1284
01:37:38,401 --> 01:37:39,401
Someone is here at such odd hours!

1285
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:43,441
Okay. Let's go.
I'll see to it. - Okay.

1286
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:49,961
Yes, say.

1287
01:37:53,441 --> 01:37:55,521
Mr. Bakshi is here?
- He's not home.

1288
01:37:55,561 --> 01:37:56,761
He has gone to Ramdighi.

1289
01:37:58,601 --> 01:38:01,601
When will he return?
- He'll get late.

1290
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:03,321
Should I convey any message?
Tell me.

1291
01:38:04,401 --> 01:38:05,401
No, thanks.

1292
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:16,961
Mrs. Bakshi.
- Yes.

1293
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,081
I am sorry to disturb you.

1294
01:38:19,161 --> 01:38:21,001
I know Mr. Byomkesh and Mr. Ajit
are not home.

1295
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:22,961
Mr. Badrinath was here.
What did he say?

1296
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:26,121
He came here and asked
for Mr. Bakshi.

1297
01:38:26,201 --> 01:38:27,921
He enquired when he'll return.

1298
01:38:28,281 --> 01:38:31,881
Why are you standing here!
Come in. Have tea. - No..

1299
01:38:31,961 --> 01:38:33,201
Thank you.

1300
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:37,041
I am here to ask you
to stay indoor

1301
01:38:37,121 --> 01:38:38,601
until Byomkesh and Ajit returns.

1302
01:38:38,641 --> 01:38:39,441
Keep the door locked.

1303
01:38:39,601 --> 01:38:40,641
Why do you say so?

1304
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,841
Is anything wrong? -
No, nothing is wrong.

1305
01:38:44,681 --> 01:38:46,081
It's better to stay indoors.

1306
01:38:46,761 --> 01:38:48,681
Oh.
- Let them return.

1307
01:38:50,601 --> 01:38:51,481
Greetings.

1308
01:39:58,841 --> 01:40:00,481
Hey, when did you come?

1309
01:40:12,921 --> 01:40:14,841
It's a jackal.
- What's the colour?

1310
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,041
It's black.

1311
01:40:16,881 --> 01:40:20,601
Jackals are never black in colour.
- Right, they are brown.

1312
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:23,561
The quick brown fox..
- Yes.

1313
01:40:23,961 --> 01:40:26,481
I met the assailant in the jungle
some time back, Ajit.

1314
01:41:22,881 --> 01:41:25,241
It's not that only black horses
will appear black.

1315
01:41:26,401 --> 01:41:28,801
In the dark, we might mistake
a brown horse to be black.

1316
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:42,361
Mr. Biswanath.

1317
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:48,521
Hey, Mr. Byomkesh. Say.

1318
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:51,161
Did you get back your arms
from the dead tree?

1319
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:54,681
We have started searching
the Bagmari jungle.

1320
01:41:54,761 --> 01:41:58,681
Yes? I don't deal in illegal
arms. I've men for other work.

1321
01:41:59,881 --> 01:42:01,921
I'll keep an account
of your men.

1322
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:07,001
First, tell me. Didn't Sadananda
Sur see you hiding the arms there?

1323
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,321
What? I'm right!

1324
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:13,401
When he started blackmailing you,
you shut him up with bribes.

1325
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,401
You didn't lend him money
like a kind man.

1326
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:17,481
I don't get you.

1327
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:21,081
What were you doing in the jungle
last night?

1328
01:42:22,241 --> 01:42:24,041
Jungle!
Me!

1329
01:42:25,321 --> 01:42:26,361
I was at home.

1330
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,281
I met your wife
in the guest house.

1331
01:42:30,721 --> 01:42:32,201
Yes, but the time doesn't match.

1332
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:38,081
You left home around 10:30 p.m.
Potol and their friends saw you.

1333
01:42:38,961 --> 01:42:40,801
You entered the jungle
around 11 p.m.

1334
01:42:41,081 --> 01:42:43,761
You return with all the arms
around 11:30 p.m.

1335
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:46,481
You might've not noticed,
Biswanath Mallick.

1336
01:42:46,921 --> 01:42:48,881
A group of boys kept
a check on you.

1337
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:56,241
What are you trying to prove!

1338
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:12,361
You met another bodiless
ghost rider.

1339
01:43:13,241 --> 01:43:15,001
Police officer Sukhomoy Samanta
witnessed it.

1340
01:43:15,961 --> 01:43:17,121
The black horse belongs to it.

1341
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,441
Nilkantha, hit him.

1342
01:43:36,321 --> 01:43:37,481
Hit him.

1343
01:44:50,401 --> 01:44:54,521
Halt. Hands up!

1344
01:45:01,001 --> 01:45:01,841
This is why they say
that every fox

1345
01:45:02,521 --> 01:45:03,881
must pay his skin to the furrier!

1346
01:45:04,201 --> 01:45:06,961
Mr. Shukhamoy, all the
smuggled arms are kept there.

1347
01:45:07,001 --> 01:45:08,681
Hey, check the entire place.
- Hurry up!

1348
01:45:12,041 --> 01:45:14,881
Had there not been the 'Manasa'
plant beside that dead tree

1349
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:17,401
and had Mr. Ajit Bandhopadhay
not been a litterateur

1350
01:45:18,041 --> 01:45:20,281
catching you would have been very
difficult, Mr. Biswanath Mallick.

1351
01:45:20,321 --> 01:45:21,721
What was my contribution
in all this?

1352
01:45:22,361 --> 01:45:24,601
Getting one man arrested won't
ensure you victory, Mr. Byomkesh!

1353
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:28,321
You can't suppress our protests
by just arresting me.

1354
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:30,321
Your idea of independence
is flawed.

1355
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:32,121
And so is your concept
of a republic.

1356
01:45:32,521 --> 01:45:34,121
Trying times are inevitable.

1357
01:45:34,321 --> 01:45:36,081
Concentrating on your situation
would be wiser, Mr. Biswanath!

1358
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:39,681
Hey, take him away.
- Hold on!

1359
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:44,281
How was Amrito becoming a
problem for your movement?

1360
01:45:45,121 --> 01:45:46,481
You can't justify
an innocent man's death

1361
01:45:46,561 --> 01:45:48,401
by citing political reasons.

1362
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:51,761
Politics that gets people killed
has always been unacceptable.

1363
01:45:52,121 --> 01:45:55,121
And it will be so in future as
well. Please.. - Take him away.

1364
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:12,521
Amrito couldn't recognise the man
who was riding the black horse

1365
01:46:12,881 --> 01:46:16,001
despite seeing him.
It was Sadananda Sur

1366
01:46:16,081 --> 01:46:19,481
who saw Biswanath Mallick hiding
the weapons on the tree at night.

1367
01:46:25,321 --> 01:46:27,801
Sadananda had started
blackmailing Biswanath

1368
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,201
after seeing him
hide the weapons.

1369
01:46:29,681 --> 01:46:31,921
The story surrounding
Rs. 1,000 being lent.. - Yes.

1370
01:46:32,161 --> 01:46:33,521
...wasn't exactly given as credit.

1371
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:35,921
The money was paid
to keep smuggling a secret. - Oh!

1372
01:46:35,961 --> 01:46:38,121
Sadananda took some of that
money with him to Kolkata

1373
01:46:38,201 --> 01:46:39,641
for a little shindig.

1374
01:46:40,601 --> 01:46:44,321
He took the rest of the money
in a trunk to his sister's house.

1375
01:46:44,761 --> 01:46:45,921
He had planned to take it
back from his sister

1376
01:46:45,961 --> 01:46:47,281
as and when he would need it.

1377
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:49,761
But Biswanath Mallick
had grown suspicious

1378
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:51,921
and wanted to clip
Sadananda's wings.

1379
01:46:52,241 --> 01:46:54,881
There was always
the risk of people

1380
01:46:54,961 --> 01:46:56,641
knowing that he smuggled weapons.

1381
01:46:57,761 --> 01:47:00,441
Thus, Biswanath Mallick entered
the forest one more time.

1382
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:05,921
This time his plan was to set a
booby trap in Sadananda's house.

1383
01:47:13,841 --> 01:47:15,921
When Biswanath was coming
out of Sadananda's house

1384
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:17,641
after setting up the booby trap

1385
01:47:18,041 --> 01:47:20,281
it was probably then, when things
started going wrong for Biswanath.

1386
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:27,641
After that we started looking
for the black horse.

1387
01:47:27,881 --> 01:47:31,561
Mr. Shukhamoy, nobody in this area
has a black horse except you.

1388
01:47:31,801 --> 01:47:33,041
Thus, I was a little apprehensive.

1389
01:47:33,921 --> 01:47:37,561
I also got to know that Badrinath
Dos worked as a jockey in Kolkata.

1390
01:47:37,961 --> 01:47:41,201
Thus deep in the forest
in absolute darkness.. Careful..

1391
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:44,401
Who else but Badrinath Das could
ride a horse with such ease?

1392
01:47:45,081 --> 01:47:48,521
But it was not that I hadn't
suspected Biswanath Mallick!

1393
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:50,961
Amrito was murdered
in this very forest.

1394
01:47:52,321 --> 01:47:55,401
And Sadananda died
while entering his house.

1395
01:47:56,601 --> 01:48:00,641
In that case, was Sadananda
involved in the smuggling of arms?

1396
01:48:01,401 --> 01:48:02,921
There were hoof marks
on the ground

1397
01:48:02,961 --> 01:48:03,921
near Sadananda's house.

1398
01:48:04,281 --> 01:48:05,601
Thus after hearing
about the black horse

1399
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:09,121
and it's rider with amazing
equestrian skills I had felt that

1400
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:12,921
the forest might
have a connection with all this.

1401
01:48:13,401 --> 01:48:16,161
But if that was so, where did
all the smuggled arms go?

1402
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:22,041
'Mahabharata'! - Exile!
- Bravo.

1403
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:24,681
The Pandavas had hidden
all their weapons

1404
01:48:24,761 --> 01:48:28,281
inside a tree when they were
sent on exile. Inside a tree!

1405
01:48:29,001 --> 01:48:31,121
I was going through a book
one afternoon.

1406
01:48:31,601 --> 01:48:33,121
And that was when I found
the clue I was looking for.

1407
01:48:33,281 --> 01:48:36,401
The tree mentioned in
'Mahabharata' was a tree of thorns.

1408
01:48:36,481 --> 01:48:40,761
You must be aware that beside
Sadananda's house was a dead tree

1409
01:48:40,841 --> 01:48:42,801
and beside that tree
was a thick shrub.

1410
01:48:43,521 --> 01:48:44,921
It might have been a coincidence.

1411
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:47,721
But with that clue in mind,
I told everyone

1412
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:49,921
that a search would be
carried out in the forest.

1413
01:48:49,961 --> 01:48:52,161
In fact, Ajit had helped me out
a lot in this regard.

1414
01:48:52,881 --> 01:48:55,361
Ajit and I boarded a train,
to go to Ramdighi.

1415
01:48:55,721 --> 01:48:57,761
The entire thing was planned
to serve as a bait

1416
01:48:58,081 --> 01:49:01,041
so that the people in Santhalgola
think that I'm out of town.

1417
01:49:01,681 --> 01:49:05,401
If the culprit had really hidden
the weapons in the forest

1418
01:49:05,441 --> 01:49:09,481
then he would go to the forest
that very night to take them out.

1419
01:49:09,521 --> 01:49:10,801
Was that the reason why you
got off from the train? - Yes.

1420
01:49:10,841 --> 01:49:12,561
You didn't go to Ramdighi!
- No.

1421
01:49:13,081 --> 01:49:14,401
I had asked Potol
and his friends

1422
01:49:14,441 --> 01:49:16,841
to keep an eye on all
the mills in the area.

1423
01:49:17,121 --> 01:49:20,481
By the way, thanks, Mr. Shukhamoy
for letting me borrow your horse.

1424
01:49:22,881 --> 01:49:25,081
But the horse wasn't black,
was it?

1425
01:49:25,841 --> 01:49:28,681
A fox in the darkness at night

1426
01:49:28,721 --> 01:49:31,721
made me realise where I
was making a mistake.

1427
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:36,721
By Jove!
- Wow! Hail The Almighty!

1428
01:49:38,201 --> 01:49:41,961
Thank you!
- Hello.

1429
01:49:42,481 --> 01:49:46,921
Yes, give him the phone.
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

1430
01:49:47,161 --> 01:49:50,121
He is right in front of me.
It is the Chief Secretary.

1431
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:54,601
Greetings, Mr. Bagchi!

1432
01:49:54,641 --> 01:49:57,121
Congratulations and thank you,
Mr. Byomkesh.

1433
01:49:57,801 --> 01:50:00,481
Only you could have
solved this case.

1434
01:50:00,721 --> 01:50:02,521
The Chief Minister has thanked
you as well.

1435
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:06,161
He wants to have you over for tea
once you return.

1436
01:50:06,521 --> 01:50:08,961
Thank the Chief Minister
on my behalf. - Of course.

1437
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:13,721
See you once you are back in
Kolkata. - Of course, see you!

1438
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:18,561
Sir, we are ready.
- Oh! Come with me.

1439
01:50:18,601 --> 01:50:20,721
The program is about to begin.

1440
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:23,001
First anniversary of our
independence.

1441
01:50:32,401 --> 01:50:33,641
Please!

1442
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:55,881
When our civilisation became
independent

1443
01:50:56,281 --> 01:51:00,961
it didn't just become independent
from the tyranny of the British.

1444
01:51:01,441 --> 01:51:04,961
In fact, it was our independence
of thoughts and choices.

1445
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:07,841
We must keep one thing in mind!

1446
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:11,361
Independence should not
make us autocratic.

1447
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:14,361
The rationale behind
independence

1448
01:51:14,521 --> 01:51:16,281
is instilling qualities like
honesty in one's self.

1449
01:51:16,801 --> 01:51:19,521
Giving in to greed
and the desire

1450
01:51:19,761 --> 01:51:23,081
to gain power is
not independence.

1451
01:51:24,121 --> 01:51:26,401
Honesty is of utmost
importance

1452
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:28,361
if you want to build the country
of your dreams

1453
01:51:28,761 --> 01:51:31,961
and equally important
is self-control.

1454
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:34,641
The deeds of today

1455
01:51:34,881 --> 01:51:37,921
will decide the fate of our
civilisation will be decided.

1456
01:51:38,321 --> 01:51:39,321
One must not forget

1457
01:51:39,681 --> 01:51:41,761
the main ideals that
make up our civilisation.

1458
01:51:42,281 --> 01:51:44,161
Neither must anyone
forget role of nature

1459
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:48,561
society and culture
in shaping our civilisation.

1460
01:51:48,801 --> 01:51:51,481
One should not part
with one's values

1461
01:51:51,601 --> 01:51:53,161
even if there is a price
for it in the market.

1462
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:56,281
Hope Rabindranath lives on in us.

1463
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:03,121
'Where the soul is without fear
and head is held high..'

1464
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:07,241
'Where knowledge is free..'

1465
01:52:07,801 --> 01:52:10,841
'Where the world has not been
broken up into fragments'

1466
01:52:11,481 --> 01:52:15,121
'by narrow domestic walls..'

1467
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:19,801
'Where words come out
from the depths of truth..'

1468
01:52:20,361 --> 01:52:21,961
'Where the tireless and striving
stretches'

1469
01:52:22,121 --> 01:52:24,561
'aims towards perfection..'

1470
01:52:24,801 --> 01:52:29,921
'Where the clear stream of reason
has not lost its way'

1471
01:52:30,761 --> 01:52:33,601
'into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit..'

1472
01:52:33,721 --> 01:52:36,681
'Where the mind is led
forward by thee'

1473
01:52:37,081 --> 01:52:43,921
'into ever-widening thought
and action..'

1474
01:52:44,281 --> 01:52:51,241
'Into that heaven of freedom,
my Father, let my country awake.'
