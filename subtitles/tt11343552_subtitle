Hey Danny, congratulations!

19
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,140
* Claps *

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,120
A girl wore saree for one day and what a reaction!

21
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,140
What a wow!

22
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,480
Oh hello! It's not about your saree

23
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,240
Then?

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,840
By mistake you are awarded 'Best Employee'.

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,260
Are you serious?

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,840
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much! 
- (What's going on there?)

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,600
(Excuse me?)

28
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,580
Why dd they all run away?

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,660
He is Rakendu Mouli. He is a hauk.

30
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,740
He is an ethical hacker here.

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,400
If anyone touched his ego, 
he hacks their mail or phone...

32
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,120
...he'll play with their weakness.

33
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,960
Hey, my macholety apple pie!

34
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,320
Congratulations!

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,840
But she stayed? 
- She's his lover.

36
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,920
You wanted Best Employee award!

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,560
I made you get it.

38
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,480
Thank you, Rocky!

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,720
Is that it?

40
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,960
There is more.

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,800
My sister went out of town.

42
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,620
She found out that you hacked her phone 
and synced it to my phone.

43
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,320
She kept her phone switched off from 2 days.

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,660
So your task is to...

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,160
hack her email and,

46
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,800
find out where is she, what is she doing, etc. That's all!

47
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,320
Dhanya
! Dhanya! Dhanya!!

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,480
'Is that it?' doesn't mean that.

49
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,280
Then, what else?

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,440
You....

51
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Well... How do I tell you here?

52
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,600
No need. I understood.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
First, go and hack my sister's mail.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,340
Sister! Sister! What the heck?!

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,200
We've been dating for a week. We didn't even kiss yet.

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
2 weeks and nothing yet?

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
Eewwww!

58
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,640
How dare you insult me in front of everyone 
for not doing anything in 2 weeks?

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,460
Alright! you want to kiss? Come.

60
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,040
Kiss me. Come!

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,700
Here?

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,020
Of course! here's where you insulted me.

63
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,680
Come. Kiss me now. Come.

64
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,640
How do I kiss without feeling it? Don't force me.

65
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,040
Who waits for your feel? Come, kiss me.

66
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,260
Hey, turn around.

67
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,740
I beg you all. Turn around.

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,100
Why? Can't you kiss? Aren't you a man? Come on.

69
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,920
Hey, don't make me question myself.

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,760
How long

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,580
Are you there? 
- (He is here.)

72
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,720
Consider that a lipkiss.

73
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,860
Shut up!

74
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,920
Break up!

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,980

You are already late. Go, get ready.

83

You have to interview porn star Padma Sri.

84

What?

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,160
I should interview a porn star?

86
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,960
My journalism is not to interview a porn star.

87
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,800
Hello! I am paying you to work for me.

88
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,940
I still have your certificates. You know it, don't you?

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,380
Sir!

Sir, madam is here.

This idiot thinks the maid is madam too.

Si,r it is our 'Madam', sir!

95
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,720
Padma Sri porn star madam.

96

Madam, welcome!

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,040
Welcome madam. We are happy to have you.

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,640
I am more happy for the fact that you are Telugu girl.

99
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,520
Thank you! 
- Madam, I think I saw you somewhere.

100
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,060
Funny guy!

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,620
Sir, I think I saw her somewhere.

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,780
I'll tell you.

103
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,220
Your phone battery keeps dying, doesn't it?

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,380
It's because you were watching her clippings.

105
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,020
Sir, but somewhere else... 
- I am getting late for the interview, you...

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll kill you. Come.

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,880
I am very excited for this interview with a porn star.

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Sir, I saw her somewhere... 
- Shut up.

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,040
Greetings! Welcome to our channel.

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,900
Thank you!

111
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,340
Why did you select this field of work?

112
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,300
I love porn.

113
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,620
To watch and to act.

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,040
Me too!

115
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,520
Do yo have any inspiration?

116
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Inspiration?

117
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,600
Mr. Shyam Gopal Verma.

118
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,040
Mr. Shyam Gopal Verma?

119
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,960
He is my inspiration to do porn videos.

120
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,680
Exciting!

121
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,760
SGV is an inspiration to a porn star?

122
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,180
What a combination!

123
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,300
It'll trends as much as GST did.

124
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,160
TRP rating too!

125
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,840
But sir, I... 
- Shut it.

126
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,180
Watch it.

127
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,340
How is he your inspiration?

128
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,660
I like SGV a lot. But I didn't know how to approach him.

129
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,880
That's when I heard he starts his day watching porn.

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,560
Oh!

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
*Crack head!*

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,360
I strongly determined to be visible to him.

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,480
Is it?

134
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,000
*Why do I deserve this?*

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,620
That's when I started doing porn videos.

136
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,180
Super!

137
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,540
*You dirt rag!*

138
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,580
I couldn't make him watch but rest of the world did.

139
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,040
They made me a porn star.

140
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,060
That's it.

141
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,120
Your videos didn't reach SGV yet. 
What are you planning to do now?

142
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,260
I'll keep doing more videos until he watches me.

143
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,800
Bravo, Padma Sri.

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,900
You reminded us our duty.

145
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,580
We will make SGV start his day with your video.

146
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,820
Thank you, sir.

147
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,140
Miss. Padma Sri,

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,120
You are talking like a lunatic, you know that?

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
Did you just wall me a lunatic?

150
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,800
You are lunatic.

151
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,840
Your whole office is lunatics.

152
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,040
Your anchoring is lunatic. 
- I am lunatic?

153
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,260
F^%$ off!

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,480
What? No!

155
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,980
Get out of this place.

156
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,140
Sir, I remember now.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,240
She is the daughter of Kunti Yenkadu from our village.

158
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,460
She watched too much of SGV interviews 
and gone mad.

159
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,380
Everyone thought she ran away.

160
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,540
But here, she became a huge porn star.

161
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,720
So what if she is mad?

162
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,660
She reminded us our duty.

163
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,260
I'll make sure Padma Sri's videos reach SGV at any cost.

164
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,080
Aunty! Aunty!

165
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,260
How can you die like that, Aunty?

166
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,780
You died without seeing me happy... Aunty!

167
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,860
You used to get me breakfast every morning, Aunty!

168
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,360
You died without getting me lunch today, Aunty!

169
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,420
How did this happen, Aunty?

170
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,860
Who will take care of me like you did, Aunty?

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,760
Aunty!!

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
That's how you cry.

173
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
What an acting, director sir! You are a natural!

174
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,440
Why did you get so emotional, Narayana? 
- For your performance, sir.

175
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,480
Sir!

176
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,760
Instead of her son or husband, 
why would I cry being just a neighbor?

177
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,340
That is a cult film.

178
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,280
It's the rise of the cult.

179
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,300
That is public pulse.

180
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,900
Narayana, what'll be the costume for dead body?

181
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
As usual, we'll make her wear a saree 
and cover with a white cloth.

182
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,040
No.....

183
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,900
Why so much negligence towards 
dead-bodies since ages?

184
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,860
It's time to sing end chorus for all these practices.

185
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,840
I will sing. I will make you sing.

186
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,300
Give her a swim suit.

187
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,780
Sir!

188
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,920
Sir... Swim suit on a dead body?

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,140
Now you live up to your name, Cult Kameswara Rao!

190
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,160
Won't the critics criticize this?

191
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,020
Sir!

192
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,360
It's exciting, sir! Let's do a take in this flow.

193
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Is the food here yet?

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,380
Yes, sir. 
- Let's finish that first.

195
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,160
Narayana... What's her name?

196
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,140
Costume Designer Komali. Where is she?

197
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,020
(Miss Komali!)

198
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,580
(Director is calling you.)

199
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,160
Up. More up.

200
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,740
Sir?

201
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
What dress did you give heroine?

202
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Since the character is from North,

203
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,280
Plus it is a sad scene.

204
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,000
I gave her a nice long skirt, bangles,

205
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,780
and accessories... 
- Stop there. Did you even look at the scene paper?

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,380
Isn't it the scene where heroine gets 
emotional when her mother dies?

207
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,180
Won't you go to the depth of the scene?

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,340
What is this Narayana? Won't they change at all?

209
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,580
Tough luck, sir!

210
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,560
Heroine's mother who's been swimming in 
swim suit dies with heart stroke,

211
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,400
when the heroine, who's been partying in 
Bangkok beaches learns about it

212
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,780
in that trauma, without noticing if she 
is wearing any clothes or not,

213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,760
she'd reach in a Bangkok-Hyderabad flight and

214
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,880
when the heroines in bikini is crying for 
her dead mother lying in swim suit,

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,220
That is emotion!

216
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,200
wow! wow! wow!!

217
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,020
What a cult emotional scene, sir!

218
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,120
You think I became a cult director for nothing?

219
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,840
Go! Go and get a Bikini.

220
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,080
Madam, come.

221
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,260
Let's go, Madam.

222
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Catching your pulse or beating your stamina is impossible for any director, sir.

223
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,380
Sir, Bikini.

224
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,380
Isn't it a little too big?

225
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,440
Why don't you wear and show. Let's see how it looks.

226
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,900
Oh! I appreciate it.

227
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,980
She is cult like me.

228
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,760
What are you eating? What are you drinking?

229
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,340
Pass me that.

230
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,000
That.

231
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,860
That director... That director...

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,200
I should just... 
- Ok, cool!

233
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,380
First tell me what happened there.

234
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,780
How dare he asking me to wear a bikini and show?

235
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
Such a senseless fellow!

236
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,820
Somewhere back in ancient times

237
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,740
he just gave one hit film.

238
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,000
He keeps blabbing that he gave hit film 
to an unlucky heroine.

239
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,580
So, did you walk out from this film too?

240
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,300
I am somehow not able to be like you.

241
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm bound to work there, no matter how 
much that Bhargav is yelling at me.

242
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,540
You should do whatever your heart tells you.

243
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,820
In front of everyone...

244
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,280
Then, they'll leave you.

245
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,420
What is your frustration now?

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,840
What happened?

247
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,720
Break up!

248
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,980
What? You said he is handsome, 6-pack, hero, etc?

249
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,320
May be she's bored.

250
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,260
Huh? He should do something to get bored, right!

251
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,400
At least...

252
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,180
He can't even kiss properly. Useless!

253
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,600
When a girl says, 'Kiss me', a boy would kiss here.

254
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,940
A man would kiss here.

255
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
He kissed here like a loser.

256
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,600
What about that Raghu Ram?

257
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,880
You said he does everything right?

258
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,020
He was loser 2.0

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
He knows only kissing. Nothing else.

260
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,700
Murali?

261
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,940
Murali was...

262
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,700
He was caring a little too much.

263
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,320
He keeps calling me for every 30 minutes,

264
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,960
he keeps asking 'Did you wake up? Did you eat?'

265
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
and keeps calling me with pet names like I was a puppy.

266
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,500
Plus, each time he calls  
'What did you wear? What color?'

267
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Whatever color I say, he says 'Same pinch'

268
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,520
He is all talks and no action. So, broke up with him.

269
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,820
Actions?

270
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,800
Same thing what Srinu keeps asking...

271
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,240
Ew.

272
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,480
By the way, what happens after that?

273
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
(blabbers) ...well,

274
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,680
What now?

275
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,040
Your itching in ear must be gone.

276
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,080
Same thing!

277
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Is it?

278
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
Why did you change the location suddenly?

279
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,740
We could get drunk at home.

280
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,240
I get kick only when I drink in open air like this.

281
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,680
Yes!

282
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,340
It's time to open the beer. Give me that.

283
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,940
Cheers!

284
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,640
Isn't it silly to scream cheers for each beer?

285
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,520
Huh?

286
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,140
How many did we drink so far?

287
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,320
Darling!

288
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,280
Every moment,

289
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,620
should feel like a fresh beginning.

290
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,420
Yes. We are girls!

291
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,980
We should always say it's a fresh beginning.

292
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,780
Yes! 
- Cheers!

293
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:45,460
♪ Playing 'Katama Rayuda' ♪

294
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,980
Hey, good morning! 
- Good morning!

295
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,380
Where are we off to, girl?

296
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,520
We are going Goa, girl!

297
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
What?

298
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,460
Goa?

299
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,840
Goa??

300
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,960
We'll be in Goa in another 2 hours.

301
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
Hey, couldn't you give a heads up?

302
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,700
I did. Have a flash cut!

303
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,980
Hey, Dhanya whats up? 
- What's the matter?

304
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,120
I am getting married.

305
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,080
I'll send you wishes on Whatsapp. Bye! 
- Hey, Hey! Dhanya!!

306
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Won't you come for my wedding? 
- Hey!

307
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,180
What's fun in a wedding? 
- It's destination wedding. We planned it in Goa.

308
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,000
In Goa?

309
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,380
Hey girls, we are going to Goa.

310
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,620
Alright!

311
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,340
That's how you told us?

312
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,160
Yes!

313
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
If you gave us enough time, 
we would've packed clothes at least.

314
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,660
Won't we get something there to cover these bodies?

315
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,340
What the phone?

316
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,300
So many messages!

317
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,240
(laughs) Listen to this.

318
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,740
I am lunatic?

319
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,240
What are you so shocked about?

320
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,560
He used this for publicity too!

321
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,160
he should be killed.

322
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,940
Screw him.

323
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,680
Hello! 
- You bugger!

324
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
Your face should be burnt on stove.

325
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,500
You and your shit face. You old lump!

326
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,120
What do you even think of yourself?

327
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,000
Do you think it's a news channel or a brothel house

328
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,380
Hey, do you know who are you talking to?

329
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,460
I am your boss.

330
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,020
Boss? My foot. You old faggot.

331
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,620
You are a buffalo.

332
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,780
Relax! Cool! Breathe! 
- Oh my god!

333
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,900
Tridha! You've lost it man!

334
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,140
Ok, Ok! Cool.

335
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,940
Good job, baby!

336
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,520
Share this stress with a beer.

337
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,860
Take it up.

338
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,640
Take it easy. Breathe in, Breathe out!

339
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,740
I think it's him.

340
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,780
Don't be scared. I am with you.

341
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,460
Pick it up. Give him another round. Listen to me.

342
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,000
Hello?

343
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,760
How are you, dear?

344
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,100
Dear, is Komali with you?

345
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,440
One second, sir. Hold on.

346
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Where is your phone?

347
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,220
Battery died. Why? 
- Call for you.

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,360
Talk. Talk.

349
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,240
Hello! 
- What is it you, fish face?

350
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,980
Are you a fashion designer with your frog face?

351
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,700
What do you think of yourself?

352
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,940
I'll slack you like a shark fish.

353
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,620
You, your ugly face and your ugly fashion.

354
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,180
Its that director.

355
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,420
What did you do to get him to fired up?

356
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,400
Last time, in a frustrated mood,

357
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,060
I attached a bikini body to his face 
and posted it on Facebook.

358
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,980
Good!

359
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,160
Have you gone mad?

360
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,860
You have no idea how crazy he is.

361
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,880
He is such a pain in my....

362
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,800
Huh? 
- my head.

363
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,140
Hey, keep that phone away. he called 99 times til now.

364
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
Hey, you stop the car somewhere.

365
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,720
Why?

366
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
I lost count of my beers. My bladder is full.

367
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,120
I'll stop at some hotel. 
- What the hell?

368
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,900
We never care for such things. You stop here.

369
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,420
How will you go without a toilet?

370
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,420
You stop and I'll show you how.

371
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,920
Ew.

372
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,980
Shameless!

373
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,040
What? Why should I?

374
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,440
You stop the car. 
- Ew

375
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,520
You stop or I am gonna pee in the car. 
- What?

376
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,160
Oh no!

377
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,640
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there.

378
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,960
Who are you calling? 
- You'll know.

379
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,620
Why don't you tell me now?

380
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,500
If you can't hold it, you can go and pee too.

381
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,260
Why did you stop the car? Huh?

382
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,140
What happened suddenly?

383
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,180
Why did you stop? Madam...

384
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,640
Hey, look over there.

385
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,140
Siddhi?

386
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,540
Hi...

387
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,320
Hi!

388
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,840
* What she is doing here? *

389
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,400
What the heck are you doing here, bro?

390
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,140
Hey! 
- What is this sudden surprise?

391
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,820
Danny called me so, I made an entrance.

392
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,320
why didn't you tell us you called her?

393
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,940
Didn't I?

394
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,060
Super dear!

395
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,380
Hey, Siddhi is in.

396
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,580
You told us this in the same state?

397
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,840
Uh... Guys, pick up this luggage.

398
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,620
Please!

399
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,800
Sure, madam. 
- Thank you!

400
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,840
Why that big suitcase?

401
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,540
Are you planning to sleep in it while coming back?

402
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
I should pack everything for the tour, right!

403
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,880
Swimwear, cosmetics, toiletries, bags...

404
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,500
Hold it. Let's go.

405
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,080
Danny, Danny, Danny,

406
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,960
We met for the first time after my wedding.

407
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,480
Let's take a selfie?

408
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,680
You don't have to make a puppy face for that.

409
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,980
Come. Let's do it.

410
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,320
Say Goa!

411
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,700
Goa!!

412
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,960
One more!

413
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,260
Ah, stop it!

414
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
If you can hold the phone there, 
they can pose until dawn.

415
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,780
They won't be conscious to check their clothes too.

416
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
This woman here didn't even let us pack clothes.

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,440
She brought way too many, any way!

418
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,040
Those are my dresses.

419
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,620
I will kill you.

420
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,560
Danny, is it your's or your sister's phone? 
- Mine.

421
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,800
But it has more of her tour pictures.

422
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,820
She is too doubtful about everything.

423
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,900
She hacks and syncs her sister's phone shamelessly.

424
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,580
By the way, is your husband taking good care of you?

425
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
He is coming home in time?

426
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
Is he doing everything in time?

427
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,340
She meant is he giving everything you want?

428
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,680
Is he at least in bed ... 
- Ugh. Stop it!

429
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,780
What's with your 'Time' nonsense?

430
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,380
Are you going to link everything to time?

431
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,900
What are you saying? You said...

432
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,880
He values time and punctuality a lot.

433
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,020
You married him coz he said 
'Time is precious' in your first meeting.

434
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,760
You stop it now and no one gets hurt.

435
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Hey??

436
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,880
Time to sleep.

437
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,460
Please... Please... Please!!

438
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,320
Time's up!

439
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,560
How can you say 'Time's up' before pack up?

440
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,700
I had 2 minutes for this in my time table. I am done.

441
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,140
You are leaving for camp tomorrow, right!

442
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,400
Just 5 minutes? 
- 5 minutes??

443
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,680
No way!

444
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,660
Time is time. Time table is Time table.

445
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,940
Time is precious. Time is valuable.

446
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,120
Even here?

447
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,620
Here? I stay this way anywhere.

448
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,080
Once I fix my time, my body doesn't even listen to me.

449
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,800
It will snooze automatically like an alarm.

450
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,600
Okay? 
- It is unfair Shyam.

451
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,400
It's alright!

452
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,080
I need to leave for my camp tomorrow.

453
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,240
I have a flight to catch.

454
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,740
We'll discuss this in the next schedule.

455
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,620
Will it be this bad if someone is high on punctuality?

456
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,340
Even though you are excited every time,

457
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,720
you are ending up disappointed every time. Am I right?

458
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,960
That's why, 
I decided to enjoy Goa to the fullest with you all.

459
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,820
With us?

460
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,420
Not 'with' you.

461
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,100
That's a relief!

462
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,060
Alright! Goa!!

463
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,280
Greetings to you too!

464
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,120
Thank you!

465
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,680
3...4... Yo!

466
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,240
Hello, Meghana! Where are you?

467
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,480
We've reached the hotel.

468
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,940
(Hey, sorry. I just had to step out for something.)

469
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,020
(You don't worry. Your rooms are booked.)

470
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,060
(You guys get freshen up. I'll come and join you.)

471
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,140
So you aren't around now?

472
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,760
You at least booked the rooms. Thank you!

473
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,860
Ok, bye! 
- Hey, that's nice, isn't it?

474
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,680
Tridha! Go hit on him.

475
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,080
Mam!

476
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,760
I am looking for reservations. 
It's under name of Meghana.

477
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,140
Ok, mam. Just a minute.

478
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,060
Hey, where are you going? 
- One minute.

479
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,380
Komali, what is she asking him?

480
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,960
I think she is inquiring apart from pubs and beaches, 
if there are temples in Goa.

481
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,300
Really?

482
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,180
Then how would I know?

483
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,480
There? 
- Yes, mam.

484
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,860
Okay, thank you. 
- Welcome.

485
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
There she is coming. You ask her yourself.

486
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,300
Hey, what were you asking him about?

487
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,260
I asked apart from pubs and beaches, 
are there any temples in Goa?

488
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,800
Hell.

489
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,240
You are so arrogant.

490
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,440
Excuse me, mam!

491
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,920
You have reservations. But the check-in time is 2 PM.

492
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,480
Time? Ask him not to mention time.

493
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,220
Hey, you wait here.

494
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,960
What do you mean? You want us to wait 2 more hours?

495
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,320
No way! We need the rooms right now. 
We have reservations.

496
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,380
Bloody! We are asking nice and you are being up tight.

497
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,340
If you let us in 2 hours early,  
your hotel's gonna burn down?

498
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,720
Sorry mam. You'll have to wait.

499
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,140
Change your damn expression. 
Saying the same thing over and over?

500
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,100
If this was Hyderabad, I would have killed you by now. 
- Hey, hey. Relax.

501
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,700
I am sparing you because it is Goa.

502
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,220
What the hell do you eat?

503
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,480
I will see your end. 
- Mam, please!

504
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,180
Relax! Relax!

505
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,960
I am the manager of this hotel. What happened?

506
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,040
What happened?

507
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,140
Cool.

508
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,500
He says the check-in is at 12.

509
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,740
Where the hell should we be until then?

510
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,820
Oh, are you a Telugu?

511
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,960
One minute, mam. I'll check it, Please wait.

512
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,520
Do they have reservation? Yes, sir.

513
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,320
Check immediately. 
- Sir, I already told them the check-in time is...

514
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,300
He is talking about time again...

515
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,120
Mam, please wait for a minute. 
- You stay back.

516
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
I will check it myself.

517
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,420
Ma, I am really sorry.

518
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,200
The room you booked isn't vacated yet.

519
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,600
If it's okay with you, I'll give you a different room.

520
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,080
Do something. Or she'll go full heroine-mode. 
- Sure mam. Jack!!

521
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,320
Rose!!

522
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,360
My dream girl! 
- (Jack!)

523
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,840
Get lost!

524
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,980
Mam, please wait here for 2 mins. 
The boy will assist you.

525
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,680
Jack!

526
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,740
Uff... He is such a crack!

527
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,020
Rose, you take rest.

528
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,400
I will be back.

529
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,240
No. No.

530
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,060
Sorry for the inconvenience, mam. Please don't mind. 
- What do you want?

531
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,020
How long have you been gone for? 
- I hate time and timings.

532
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,280
First drop them at 116. I'll deal with you later. 
- Who all?

533
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,360
Hi. I am Jack. Hero is Titanic.

534
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,420
I take this luggage.

535
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,080
Miss?

536
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,600
Miss... 
- Who are you calling Miss?

537
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,440
She became someone else's 'Mrs' long ago.

538
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,120
Oh god! What the James camera man of Titanic?

539
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,640
Long gap. No settlement. Again a villain.

540
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,300
Oh this breaking ship!

541
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,980
Cool! Cool, Jack.

542
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,780
Wow!

543
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,300
Wow, what designs, huh!

544
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,500
Rose!!

545
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,720
Hey, who is Rose? Can't you call her Madam?

546
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,020
It's okay. Let him.

547
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,640
What's wrong with it now? 
- Did you get it, yo?

548
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:19,540
Rose, if you agree, I'll go get papers, pad, and eraser too.

549
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,180
Hey!

550
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,340
For what?

551
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,620
To lay her down and draw!

552
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,700
What? 
- I meant drawing.

553
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,840
Oh mother!

554
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,100
You get out at this instant. Get out!

555
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,440
You stupid dry fruit.

556
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,100
How dare he calling me dry fruit. I'll give him one.  
- Shush. Wait.

557
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,080
You wait.

558
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,500
Not now. We'll do it some other time. Okay?

559
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,420
Bye!

560
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,800
shameless. Get lost, you.

561
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,640
We can relax for 2, 3 hours now.

562
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,540
Hello, What relaxing?

563
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,080
I drove for 15 hours and got you here. Not to 'Relax'.

564
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,160
Get ready immediately. We'll head out.

Hey, Meghana is calling.

591
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,380
Ask her what is it about?

592
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,380
Hey, it's almost time for Sangeet. Come soon.

593
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,400
Hi!

594
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,460
Hi...

595
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,780
They are my 4 best friends. I told you, didn't I?

596
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,180
There, they are here.

597
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,320
Just sit for 5 mins. I'll come and join you.

598
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,360
Okay!

599
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,360
Look at her pose! 
She found a fool and marrying him already/

600
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,440
Why is this place so dry?

601
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,080
Looks like there no drop of beer around here.

602
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,600
We expected a lot.

603
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,400
Is there DJ at least?

604
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,840
Yes. There it is.

605
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,980
How fun should a Sangeet be in Goa?

606
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,140
Definitely not like this.

607
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,640
Which buffoon arranged all this?

608
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,540
That's me.

609
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,700
I am the would-be father-in-law for Meghana.

610
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,200
Goa is my hometown.

611
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,080
That's why I planned my son's wedding here.

612
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,120
We came because its in Goa.

613
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,760
If its in some pilgrim place, 
we won't even consider attending.

614
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,020
What do you think Meghana is?

615
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,740
Goddess of our family.

616
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,780
Goddess of wealth for us.

617
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,960
Goddess of boon for us.

618
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,120
Goddess of luck for our son.

619
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Goddess of courage to us all.

620
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,460
You... 
- Hey, where are you going?

621
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
If we let him continue, he'll start a pooja.

622
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,080
I will... 
- Hey, Komali. Stop.

623
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,680
Hey, what is this? There is no liquor, no fun or music.

624
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,840
Look at him.

625
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,880
Is this suppose to entertain us?

626
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
And that man goes on... 
- Shush!

627
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,700
I meant he's banging our brains.

628
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,660
In Hyderabad, there is entertainment in local bars too.

629
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,680
Why did we come Goa for this Tabla music?

630
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,760
Hey, she'll go full-heroine mode if 
we don't change location.

631
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,460
Let's move out from here?

632
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,120
What is Goa?

633
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,400
Beaches in day time and Pubs in night time.

634
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,920
Who is that?

635
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,960
You fool. 
- Hell with you.

636
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,180
Who threw us out?

637
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,680
I want to go back.

638
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,100
I puked on the bartender.

639
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,040
So, he threw us out.

640
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,460
You should've seen his face.

641
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,980
He looked like an unflushed commode.

642
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,940
One more peg?

643
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,600
One minute.

644
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,240
Go! Enjoy as much as you want. 
- Where are you going?

645
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,060
No time. No limits.

646
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,500
You were such a nerd until last few days.

647
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,680
But today, you were on fire.

648
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,720
You mixed something in my last peg.

649
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,600
So, everything has unlocked inside me.

650
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,840
I want more and more and more.

651
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,860
They will never let us into that pub.

652
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,220
Let's go home and hit the beds.

653
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,940
I don't want that husband at home.

654
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,420
Then?

655
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,180
Something more than that.

656
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,920
What is more than that?

657
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,060
What?

658
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,220
A warrior who can break the clocks.

659
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,220
An impossible man who doesn't need Alarms.

660
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,860
A hero from Satadhra family.

661
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,580
I want him. 
- For what?

662
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,300
To conduct a pooja in Goa.

663
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,420
To do chanting in Bangkok.

664
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
What do you mean for what? For 'That'.

665
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,660
What are you saying?

666
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,820
I am asking 'I want someone' in Telugu.

667
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,460
Hey butterflies!

668
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,900
Who are you?

669
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,620
My name is Sampu.

670
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,100
My profession is Pimp.

671
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,880
A pimp? 
- Yes!

672
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,520
The warrior you just described is called a stripper here.

673
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,220
I supply them.

674
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,480
Is it?

675
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,100
Then, I want Bahubali.

676
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,320
Not just Bahubali. I have his father, 
Amarendra Bahubali too.

677
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,400
No. No.

678
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,360
If Dhanya finds about this...

679
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,300
She'll fuck us, bro!

680
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,420
Hey!

681
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Shall we book a stripper? I heard it's pretty cheap here.

682
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:25,940
Yes!

683
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,180
Who is he?

684
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,500
he is looking strange.

685
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,260
He's a broker. 
- Madam!

686
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,260
Madam, not broker. Call me Pimp.

687
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,920
Ya ya. Whatever!

688
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,320
Where are the boys?

689
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,540
Hey baby! What's up? How are you doing?

690
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,740
Do you have any new tunes? 
- It's all old tunes.

691
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
But they'll feel new. Want some?

692
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,540
No man! Let's go baby. Let's party! 
- Bye!

693
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,420
We are flying yo!

694
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,400
Let's go check out other street.

695
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,820
Hey dude! Do you have something good?

696
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,120
I have good of Korean tunes. Do you want?

697
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,940
Oh, no Korean tunes, bro!

698
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,960
First grease this vehicle a bit.

699
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,520
It's making too much noise.

700
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,260
Hey baby, let's check it out.

701
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,260
Something is off here.

702
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,200
Let's move baby. Come here.

703
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,900
I'll show you a new scene.

704
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,760
Hello, Vani.

705
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,900
I have a team as good as Bahubai. I want a good tune.

706
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,820
The strings should collapse.

707
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,640
Why not? How many?

708
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,600
Just one.

709
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,660
One tune for four songs?

710
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,660
Forget about strings. the guitar will collapse.

711
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,720
They are new. They just want one.

712
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,080
It's their first time. Next time, I'll order 4 tunes.

713
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,460
Time again?

714
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,600
I'll kill you if you talk about time again.

715
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,300
Woah! The girl looks hungry.

716
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,080
Me! 
- Show me, please.

717
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,000
He looks like Salman. He is okay for me.

718
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,420
You won't get power and Abs at one place, darling.

719
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,260
Swipe.

720
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,540
Okay.

721
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,440
Oh my god!

722
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,140
He is handsome like Shahrukh Khan.

723
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,880
He is okay for me.

724
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,240
Chi. I hate him.

725
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,720
Why?

726
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,660
He is wearing a watch.

727
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,560
Change! 
- My fate's bad.

728
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Hey, he looks like Akshay.

729
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,340
He is okay for me.

730
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
Hey Hey! I don't like him.

731
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,020
No. He looks like a Shemale.

732
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,800
Hey, he is okay for me.

733
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Him?

734
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,360
Hey look!

735
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,680
He's got biceps for you. Handsome. And no watch.

736
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,600
Don't cover it up. Just say you liked him.

737
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,820
Okay for me.

738
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,800
Book him. 
- Okay!

739
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,780
You go back to your room. He'll come.

740
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,500
Hey, Rose!

741
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,100
Are you waiting for me?

742
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,240
Come on. Tell me.

743
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,500
looks like, you cleaned up pretty good.

744
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,660
Here it is. Let's go in.

745
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,940
I'll get it done.

746
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,940
What are you gonna get done? 
- Drawing, Rose.

747
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,480
Get lost, you. I'm in middle of something important.

748
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,220
Rose! Rose!!

749
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,520
Let go of me. 
- I told you. Don't touch me.

750
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,200
Leave me please. 
- Let me go first.

751
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,960
Hey!!

752
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,720
It's not the hero. It's boy, bell boy.

753
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,900
Bell boy?

754
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,480
Urghh!! 
- Okay, you go.

755
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,620
Shit. Unnecessarily got excited.

756
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,140
Now, I will go and check.

757
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,380
Please come in. 
- Okay!

758
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,800
Hey dry fruit, go and play outside for a while.

759
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,300
Me and Rose should get started with the drawing.

760
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,200
What nonsense?

761
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,480
We are in middle of something important. You get out.

762
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,540
I know all about your 'Something important'.

763
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,740
Let me finish mine first.

764
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,840
You, crazy jack.

765
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,140
You get out first. Move! 
- Hey dry fruit. Don't push me. No.

766
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,060
My Rose! She is mine. 
- Idiot.

767
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
He is so senseless.

768
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,560
Hey, wait wait.

769
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,640
My back broke. Get up.

770
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,180
Get up.

771
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,920
I'll go check.

772
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,620
Hello girls!

773
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,000
Come in my dinner. I'll eat you up.

774
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,860
I'll go first.  
- Not you. I'll go first.

775
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,420
I will go first.

776
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,420
I call dibs.

777
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,660
Can I come in or you'll leave me hanging here?

778
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,620
Come in. Please come.

779
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,480
I'll go first. Please. 
- No, No. I'll go first, Please!

780
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,100
Hey!!

781
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,280
What happened, girls?

782
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,640
Nothing! You go inside. We'll come.

783
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,300
Yeah!

784
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,020
Okay!!

785
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,040
(Quarrel continues)

786
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,900
Stop. Stop. Quiet!

787
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,140
The night will be done by the time we decide this.

788
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,120
Then, what do we do?

789
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,280
Think matured, not like kids.

790
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:19,940
Start!

791
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,300
Just miss. 
- Okay, okay. come on.

792
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,560
Why did you do this to me?

793
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,340
Please god. I should at least get the second chance.

794
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,160
Okay. 
- Hey!!

795
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,980
Who are you asking all this? Come.

796
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,340
God's great. He'll give me a chance. Come on.

797
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,980
♪ Hit the bullet. ♪

798
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
Come now.

799
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,940
♪ Hit it. ♪

800
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,560
There is no god.

801
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,180
Hey, come here.

802
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,800
Let's listen to what's happening inside.

803
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,780
Get lost. Later!

804
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,540
Hey, come here. Come!

805
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,680
Let's peep in.

806
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,640
What is this?

807
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,220
Is it the new style?

808
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,620
Is it... Violent?

809
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,280
Let us join too.

810
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,780
Poor girl! 
Doing anything she feels like without knowledge.

811
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,300
Tell me. Where is it?

812
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,500
What? She doesn't even know where is it?

813
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,100
That's why you need practice.

814
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,820
I really don't know where is it, mam

815
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:18,960
What?

816
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,200
He doesn't know it either

817
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,140
By any chance...

818
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,740
...is he gay?

819
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,860
Looks like that Broker cheated us and sent us a gay.

820
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,340
She is life.

821
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,060
I can't tolerate if something happened to her.

822
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,200
Tell me where is she? 
- Poor thing!

823
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,060
She is fighting alone for it.

824
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,040
Let's go and help her.

825
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,200
Hey, at least tell her where is it?

826
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,020
Are you gonna tell me? Or i'll pull the trigger.

827
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,360
Why did she have to point a gun for 'that'?

828
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,360
Why is she getting emotional?

829
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,260
Hey!!

830
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,020
Tell her.

831
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,960
Where did you keep it? She might kill you.

832
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,520
I swear, I have no idea.

833
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,140
Hey! We were so hopeful for 'that'.

834
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,360
What are you talking about?

835
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,220
What are you talking about?

836
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,340
I am talking about my sister.

837
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,780
About your sister?

838
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,500
I thought its about his brother.

839
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,240
What?

840
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,180
What about sister?

841
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,240
What happened to her?

842
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,980
I don't know her whereabouts from the last 2 days.

843
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,260
Her phone is unreachable too.

844
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,240
You know!

845
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,580
She keeps going here and there for 
tours without telling me.

846
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:49,820
That's why...

847
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,680
I synced every data in her phone with mine.

848
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,040
When I saw her pictures, I understood something.

849
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,680
She came to Goa.

850
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,260
His photos were in there too.

851
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,380
So, he must know where is my sister.

852
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,480
I really don't know anything, madam.

853
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,900
I've inquiring about him since yesterday.

854
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,920
I got to know he is a male prostitute in my inquiry.

855
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,920
What are you playing games with me?

856
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,480
What is all this drama?

857
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,320
don't move.

858
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,620
Drop the gun.

859
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,620
Huh?

860
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,000
No. 
- Shut up.

861
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
I'll kill you.

862
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,180
How did you hit him like that?

863
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,540
I thought he's gonna kill us otherwise.

864
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,680
Is he alive?

865
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,640
He is dead.

866
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,560
Hey, how did you kill him like that?

867
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,420
How to find out about my sister now?

868
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,260
He was my only way to her.

869
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,000
He id dead here. First think about what do to!

870
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,260
It's my sister out there. She is important for me.

871
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,860
What are you doing at this time?

872
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,000
First answer the call.

873
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,820
Hello, who is this?

874
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,940
It's me, Nikhita.

875
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,040
So what? 
- It's me, your sister.

876
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,320
Sister?

877
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,720
What happened? Is everything okay?

878
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,680
Why is your phone unreachable since 2 days?

879
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,040
I went on a trip to Goa.

880
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,520
Someone stole my phone there.

881
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,300
Stole your phone?

882
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,460
♪ Planned something. ♪

883
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,580

887
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,900
So...

888
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,420
Your sister is alright, isn't she?

889
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,480
So...

890
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,400
She reached home safely.

891
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,460
You felt like a CBI officer,

892
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,340
did a big investigation,

893
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,820
you brought him and pointed a gun at him.

894
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,060
He took that gun and pointed it at us.

895
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,980
She picked up a rod and

896
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,980
broke the hell out of his skull.

897
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,300
He died just for one smack.

898
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,800
So, we all are booked for your over-smartness.

899
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,140
What's with your 'hmm'... You...

900
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,280
Think about what to do with the body first.

901
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,760
Again with your 'Hmmm'...

902
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,140
Stop!

903
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,620
Let's dump the body somewhere and,

904
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,900
let's go back to Hyderabad. Shall we?

905
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,560
What is it dear?

906
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,540
You'll dump the body and go back to Hyderabad?

907
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,060
You thought it's some chicken or 
mutton that you can dump somewhere?

908
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,400
It's a dead body!

909
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,660
Dump the body?!

910
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,220
Hey, shall we cut the body into pieces and scatter them?

911
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,760
Cut into pieces?

912
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,400
Darling!

913
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,900
How violent you turned with just one murder?

914
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,100
(Idea!)

915
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,980
Let's put him in the luggage bag and dump him outside.

916
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,900
With suitcase.

917
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,820
In the suitcase.

918
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,900
No no no. That's my suitcase. I won't give.

919
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,300
You killed him, after all.

920
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:23,860
He is...

921
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,140
Will he fit into it?

922
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,820
If you piss me off,

923
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,480
I'll dump you along with him in that suitcase.

924
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,400
He is damn tall.

925
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,040
Fit those legs and hands properly.

926
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,340
It doesn't look good if they hang out.

927
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:51,540
We should first plan which road we should 
take and where to dump this body.

928
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,540
Me and Komali will just step outside for a while.

929
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,800
Is it okay?

930
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,780
Both of you will stay right?

931
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,040
Do you think I'm scared?

932
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,680
In deed I'm scared. Please take me.

933
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,620
Listen! Everybody just be relaxed.

934
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,020
Don't get tensed.

935
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,120
But please don't over react.

936
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,440
Hey! Even though I called you  
many times to come for the reception...

937
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,660
You still didn't show up? 
-First listen to me buddy!

938
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,120
Hey its Police!

939
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:48,940
Danny!

940
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,020
You asked us not to over react.

941
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,500
Why are you, over reacting?

942
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:55,720
Oh god!

943
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,480
Did the Police know about it already?

944
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,460
Don't over react, okay?

945
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,660
He might suspect us.

946
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,240
As its marriage season, the hotel is full busy.

947
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:22,800
Excuse me!

948
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,480
You seem pretty tensed.

949
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:44,940
What happened?

950
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,160
Hey! They are also Telugu people.

951
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,040
Is it?

952
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,380
You are Telugu people, okay!

953
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,580
Why are you like that? What happened?

954
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,120
Nothing sir!

955
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,040
Where are you from?

956
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,640
Hyderabad! Pune!

957
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,860
Pune! Hyderabad!

958
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,380
Pune or Hyderabad?

959
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,060
Actually! We all are from Hyderabad sir.

960
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,220
She got married and moved to Pune sir.

961
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,220
So she from Pune and we from Hyderabad...

962
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,400
Came to our friend's marriage,  
who came from Europe sir.

963
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,720
Friend's marriage?

964
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,340
Where's the marriage happening in Goa?

965
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,300
Its...

966
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,480
Stop it dude!

967
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,300
They just came for marriage.  
You are unnecessarily suspecting them.

968
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,540
You please carry on mam!

969
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,760
Thank you sir! Bye!

970
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,380
Something's wrong.

971
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,300
They doesn't seem to have come for a marriage.

972
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,060
Its not correct to look  
everything in a suspicious manner.

973
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,000
Let's go! 
-Wait!

974
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,980
What's their room number?

975
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,060
For what? 
-I need to check it.

976
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,780
Why all these unnecessarily now? Lets go!

977
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,040
I'm not talking to you as a friend.

978
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:10,740
On duty!

979
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,360
I need to check!

980
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,040
What happened? Why are you starring like that?

981
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,800
I feel like someone has come to our room.

982
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,960
Stop it dumbo!

983
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,840
With the same doubtful nature, in your sister's matter...

984
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,600
You dragged till the  
stripper guy was dead. Isn't it enough?

985
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,880
Please don't do the same thing.

986
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,060
We are afraid that we may die.

987
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,400
Listen to me. I really feel it.

988
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:54,940
Shut up!

989
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,500
Shut up!

990
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,560
We'll throw that brief case away  
and going to Hyderabad, That's it.

991
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,900
How are we supposed to use  
a brief case and how are we using it.

992
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,000
Its all our fate.

993
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,600
Okay, let's go.

994
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:26,920
Hey girls!

995
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,780
Hey Rose! Where are you going?

996
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,680
We are going to Hyderabad.

997
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,240
What? Your friend's marriage  
is tomorrow and you are leaving now?

998
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,440
Her granny is in a serious health condition.

999
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,600
Yes! She is very sick.

1000
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,620
Rest in Peace!

1001
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,800
When you'll be coming back?

1002
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,580
We'll never be coming back.

1003
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,780
What? You'll not be coming back?

1004
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,220
What to do now? The ship might again sink.

1005
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,440
Rose! You wait for a while.

1006
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,580
I'll finish it in two minutes, that's my power.

1007
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:18,720
Finish?

1008
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,020
What will you finish man?

1009
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,080
Picture!

1010
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,580
A picture, now?

1011
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,280
Then let's do the car scene.

1012
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,720
What's the car scene?

1013
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,940
James Cameroon of Titanic!

1014
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,740
Won't you tell the heroine what to do?

1015
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,160
I only should say everything?

1016
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,980
Okay, don't feel sad.

1017
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,160
Its nothing Rose.

1018
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,000
You'll understand everything, when you sleep in the car.

1019
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
Rose don't hit me like this. I love you.

1020
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,040
What! You love me?

1021
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,840
You are after all a bell boy.

1022
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,560
And I'm married.

1023
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,940
Did you ever saw your face in the mirror?

1024
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,120
Who the hell cares!

1025
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,620
No Rose! Please wait.

1026
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,260
Some how I'll make you mine.

1027
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,420
Be careful!

1028
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,500
Did they told you to sleep with him first and marry later?

1029
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:22,380
The Police have found a  
suspicious suite case under the Calvin bridge.

1030
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,640
A dead body was found in that.

1031
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,880
The Goa Police have started to  
investigate about the whereabouts of that body.

1032
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,740
Hey! It looks like your suite case.

1033
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:41,680
Yes!

1034
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,240
I killed a man by hitting on his head with a rod,  
put him in a suite case and threw it away..

1035
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,460
Don't say such jokes early in the morning.

1036
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,000
Go freshen up. I'll make you breakfast.

1037
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,500
This suite case was found in a suspicious manner.

1038
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,620
We'll catch everyone who is behind this.

1039
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,760
We'll go to any extent to investigate this case.

1040
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,980
Hello Komali!

1041
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,640
Hey! Why are you disturbing me  
while I was seriously watching the porn?

1042
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,580
What are you talking?

1043
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,880
Please understand and hang up the call.

1044
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,020
Where are you Dhanya? Everybody is in the news.

1045
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,960
Hey! I'm busy with a marriage  
proposal, will talk to you later, bye.

1046
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,180
Hello Tridha!

1047
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,780
Are you at the channel office? 
-Yes! What happened?

1048
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,340
Are you watching the news?

1049
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,360
I'm in an important meeting with my boss.

1050
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,500
You come to Komali's house. We'll meet their and talk.

1051
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,900
Okay, bye!

1052
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,680
Do you guys have any shame?

1053
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,620
Do you have any idea of what's happening?

1054
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,640
The Police have the body now  
and are searching for the clues.

1055
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,020
So what? If you want me to cry, I'll do it.

1056
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,540
Hey stop it!

1057
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,680
Will everything's gonna change if we fight like this?

1058
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,620
How can you watch the phone without any feelings?

1059
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,220
That is also a feeling right?

1060
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,620
Look, the journalist girl has come.

1061
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,260
You came finally. 
-Hi!

1062
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,960
I might die with tension.

1063
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,680
Look at them both, very cool without any tension.

1064
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,860
You look very cute when you are tensed.

1065
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,660
I see the old Siddi again.

1066
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,280
Are you mad?

1067
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,520
What if our fingerprints are on the body?

1068
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,700
What if the dog squad catch us?

1069
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,120
Hey you crazy girl. The body they've found is not his.

1070
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,460
Is it?

1071
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:09,560
Many people die in Goa and  
this body is one among such.

1072
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,180
But this body was also found under the bridge.

1073
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,020
That's why we are a bit tensed, that's it.

1074
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,940
You mean, is he not the one we killed?

1075
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,960
Hey! Don't keep on saying that we killed him.

1076
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,520
I'm very much tensed here.

1077
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,460
You don't worry, I'll handle it.

1078
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,220
Can I watch my porn now?

1079
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,420
Hey!

1080
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,560
With tension, she didn't even flush the toilet.

1081
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:38,980
You stinky face!

1082
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,140
Do you want me to do it now?

1083
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,480
By the way!

1084
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,320
What did the guy of the proposal talk with you?

1085
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,120
What did he talk?

1086
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,060
He didn't talk anything.

1087
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,460
These men will always play the safe game.

1088
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:57,720
Why the hell do you need marriage bro?

1089
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,120
Just forget it.

1090
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,800
Actually, I...

1091
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,920
Couldn't sleep properly at nights.

1092
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,840
Will anyone marry for not getting a proper sleep?

1093
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,800
Then what do you want me to do?

1094
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,560
Should I watch the devotional stuff all night?

1095
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,860
With experience I'm telling you...

1096
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,180
After an year of marriage, those are  
the ones to be watched at night.

1097
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,340
Trust me. Solo life is so much better.

1098
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,140
Is it for real? 
-Yes it is.

1099
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,980
Then I don't want this marriage.  
I'll cancel it immediately.

1100
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,740
What's that reaction babe? Did he rejected you?

1101
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,280
I was drinking my beer and sleeping happily here.

1102
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,440
You all took me to Goa.

1103
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,280
When I said not Goa, she said its the  
right place for the frustrated.

1104
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,460
And she hired a stripper.

1105
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,240
And she killed him by hitting of his head with a rod.

1106
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:16,520
Some stranger has created a whatsapp group for us.

1107
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,820
And is black mailing us by writing all that we did in it.

1108
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,920
He is asking for Two Lakhs.

1109
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,640
I can't bear this tension.

1110
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,440
Shall I send him the money?

1111
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,800
We'll not give him.

1112
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:38,560
If we give him money once, then it means 
 that agree that we did the murder.

1113
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,500
He'll black mail us for life long.

1114
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,660
Then what should we do now?

1115
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,660
If we can trace the number from which  
the messages are coming, we can know who it is.

1116
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,400
No need.

1117
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:50,760
Why?

1118
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,780
Its my sister's number.

1119
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:59,340
Is it your sister's number?

1120
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,500
The person who stole my sister's phone and...

1121
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,900
The one who is black mailing us is same.

1122
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,440
In order to keep him safe, he very intelligently 
calling us from the stolen phone.

1123
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,840
He switched off the phone and  
sending the messages in whatsapp.

1124
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,260
Its very hard to trace him.

1125
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,400
He's the one who observed us very closely.

1126
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,660
And doing this.

1127
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,740
Who might be that guy?

1128
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,580
Someone did observed us very closely.

1129
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,480
Who might be it?

1130
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:11,020
We didn't even meet or talk to someone.

1131
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,260
Can it be the broker?

1132
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,660
No chance.

1133
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,640
What about the bell boy?

1134
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,240
What he?

1135
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,840
He isn't that capable.

1136
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,000
Why not?

1137
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:26,940
He used to come to our room frequently.

1138
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,300
He used to peep through the window.

1139
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,660
He confronted us when we are  
trying to take the body in the suite case.

1140
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,760
Why will I love you?

1141
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,400
My sister too stayed in the same hotel.

1142
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,660
So he might have stolen her phone also.

1143
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:00,980
What happened?

1144
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,960
Rather than his blackmail...

1145
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,500
You investigating like a CBI officer, is more scary.

1146
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:08,900
Hey! Shut up.

1147
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,060
What she said is absolutely right.

1148
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,220
It might be him definitely.

1149
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:15,520
What do we do now?

1150
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:18,820
We should go to Goa again.

1151
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,580
Again?

1152
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,420
When we face the problem, we might get a solution.

1153
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,760
But if we ran away from it, it'll be much worse.

1154
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:29,700
We need to go.

1155
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,400
Is it Double X hotel Goa?

1156
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,820
There is the manager.

1157
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,680
Deposit Five Lakhs in this account.

1158
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,800
Sir excuse me!

1159
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:49,420
I'll call you back.

1160
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:53,880
There used to be bell boy name Jack here, where is he?

1161
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,180
As he is behaving very inappropriately with the clients...

1162
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,200
I've sent him out on the day he misbehaved with you.

1163
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,760
You sent him out?

1164
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,360
Do you know where he is now?

1165
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,440
I don't know mam.

1166
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,800
By the way, what do you need him for?

1167
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:13,780
Just asking casually.

1168
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,580
Bye sir!

1169
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,200
So, he lost his job because of us.

1170
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,760
That's why he is taking revenge.

1171
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,440
Its all because of you.

1172
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,160
First you went after that hooker and he is dead.

1173
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,020
Now, you had an argument with the bell boy...

1174
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,740
And he is blackmailing us.

1175
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,600
If I didn't hit him, he would've killed you.

1176
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,540
He's dead, but its for you guys only.

1177
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,100
Yeah! Its all for us?

1178
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,200
You morons, stop it.

1179
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,660
Looks like you guys gonna tell it everyone.

1180
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,560
Just shut up!

1181
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,540
You meant him? Just look at him.

1182
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,360
He looks like a lost African Elephant calf.

1183
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,860
He doesn't know English.

1184
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,920
Okay! Instead of fighting on what happened.

1185
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,760
Let's go and find that bell boy Jack.

1186
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,080
Please you guys stay calm.

1187
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,040
Jack? You know Jack?

1188
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,300
Who the hell is this?

1189
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,020
Who are you?

1190
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,460
I'm Fabrizio, Jack's best friend in Titanic.

1191
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,680
What are you discussing about Jack?

1192
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,180
She is Jack's girl friend.

1193
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,680
I know! I know!

1194
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,300
Jack showed me her pictures.

1195
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,040
You are very pretty.

1196
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,760
Do you know Jack's address?

1197
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,740
Yes, I do.

1198
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:51,880
Can you please tell us?

1199
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,040
There is a 4-way junction in Mabusa.

1200
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,360
And there is a slum near it.

1201
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,440
Its second building after first right in the slum.

-Yes!

1229
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,560
What's the curry? 
-Dried fish curry!

1230
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,940
Oh! Mine is fresh fish curry.

1231
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,180
Do you like fish curry?

1232
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,620
I do like it a lot.

1233
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,220
In our house there will be non-veg five days a week.

1234
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,260
Is it? We too like non-veg a lot in our house.

1235
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,360
Dried fish curry is delicious.

1236
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,100
It would have been nice, if Rose was here.

1237
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,160
Hey Rose!

1238
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,180
I know you'll definitely come.

1239
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,680
Come to me.

1240
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,340
Yeah! I'm coming to kill you, you idiot.

1241
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,360
You seemed to be tensed Rose.  
Will you eat some dried fish curry?

1242
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,260
Come eat. Its really tasty.

1243
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:19,960
What are all these?

1244
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,180
Its love. Titanic love.

1245
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,700
Love my foot. Where did you get all these photos?

1246
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,600
Where there is a will, there is a way Rose.

1247
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,040
I know that. But still how  
did you get these many photos?

1248
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,640
Hey Rose stop! I copied them from Facebook.

1249
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,600
Oh! Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter...

1250
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,840
You seem to be using them quite well.

1251
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,280
ShareChat too Rose.

1252
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,540
But when I came to know  
that you only care about money...

1253
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,360
I started earning money also Rose.

1254
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,500
I know.

1255
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,740
That's why you created a  
Whatsapp group and blackmailing us.

1256
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,960
Hey Rose listen to me.

1257
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,900
I didn't do anything. I don't even  
have an email, how will I black mail?

1258
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:03,180
Rose please listen to me. Don't hit me.

1259
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,460
Guys! Guys!

1260
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,820
I still got message from him now.

1261
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,720
What message and who is he?

1262
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,240
Shut up!

1263
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,020
That means, the person who is blackmailing us...

1264
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,440
Is not him?

1265
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,700
Who is he?

1266
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,860
When I'm here, why are you talking bout someone else?

1267
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,800
Then who is it?

1268
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,660
Exactly my question.

1269
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,920
Rose, if you have any problem tell me I'll solve it.

1270
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,520
Why the hell should I tell you?

1271
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,660
No Rose not again. Please stop it.

1272
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,880
Hey guys stop it!

1273
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,220
Don't waste the time. Come lets go.

1274
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,540
Rose! Its confirm that you care only about money.

1275
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,940
I'll earn a lot of money.

1276
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,840
And with that I'll earn you.

1277
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,160
Stop! Stop!

1278
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:17,980
Get in!

1279
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,700
I said get in.

1280
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:27,540
Shut up!

1281
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:29,600
Get in first.

1282
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:38,620
Get down.

1283
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,280
I said get down!

1284
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,320
What sir! We thought you'll take us to Police station.

1285
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,120
But you brought us to our hotel.

1286
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,240
Did you guys committed any murder?

1287
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,100
No sir!

1288
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,280
Lets accept the crime.

1289
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,940
No! No! Please! Please!

1290
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:23,680
We didn't do it intentionally sir.

1291
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,600
It all happened by mistake sir.

1292
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,160
Nice timing.

1293
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,880
No one can beat our Telugu people in humor.

1294
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,460
I was just joking but you started to counter that as well.

1295
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,400
Oh! Its a joke?

1296
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:52,780
Its a joke!

1297
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,940
The area you went was a very dangerous one.

1298
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,260
The drug mafia, rapists will be in that area.

1299
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:03,460
That's why I got took you from there, okay?

1300
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,020
By the way, why did you go to that place?

1301
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,040
Its nothing sir. Someone saw us doing the murder.

1302
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,780
And he is blackmailing us.

1303
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,700
Searching him, we went there.

1304
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,280
That's it? 
-That's it!

1305
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:23,940
Again?

1306
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:29,860
Let's go!

1307
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,680
Where are they?

1308
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
They are causing me a lot of trouble.

1309
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,920
I should burn them and eat.

1310
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,680
They are troubling me the whole day.

1311
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,580
Oh god that Police!

1312
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,080
We thought he's a Villain,  
but he seems to be a comedian.

1313
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,020
Lets not care all that now.

1314
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,460
If the person who is blackmailing us isn't Jack...

1315
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,220
Who else it could be?

1316
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,140
Whoever it might be.

1317
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:36,540
Lets find out, settle with him and go back to Hyderabad.

1318
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,000
If we stay here long, the problems gonna increase.

1319
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,360
What if he doesn't listen to us?

1320
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,120
We'll kill him.

1321
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,840
What are you talking?

1322
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,460
Are you out of your mind?

1323
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,260
To cover a mistake, we should do an other.

1324
01:27:59,080 --> 01:27:59,660
No other option.

1325
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:01,640
No!

1326
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,820
If we get caught, our lives will be finished.

1327
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,740
With frustration or fear, its good to be alive.

1328
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,320
There are no proofs to say that we came to Goa.

1329
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,160
And luckily, we didn't take any rooms since morning.

1330
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,800
Lets google on how to  
do a murder without getting caught.

1331
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,020
In Facebook, lets tag that  
we are in Vijayawada at the same time.

1332
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:27,320
Let's exit from the Whatsapp group he created.

1333
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,020
Then...

1334
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,100
We can live a happy life forgetting all this.

1335
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,820
Guys he texted us again.

1336
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,620
He says that if we didn't give him 15 Lakhs by morning...

1337
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,500
He'll leak the matter to the Police.

1338
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,720
Show me.

1339
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,940
He'll hand over us to the Police?

1340
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,380
Hey you scumbag! Do whatever the hell you want.

1341
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,160
If not Police, give it to the media as well.

1342
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:00,620
Its better for us than to suffer like this.

1343
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,020
Then not us, the Police will come looking for you too.

1344
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,020
Then you'll also be in trouble along with us.

1345
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,340
Why isn't he replying?

1346
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,700
Do you think that he got scared? 
-Definitely he will.

1347
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,320
If we did it in Hyderabad, we need have to come here.

1348
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,500
But guys, I feel that something is fishy here.

1349
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:55,660
Dhanya!

1350
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,200
What happened?

1351
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,820
My sister!

1352
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,280
He sent my sister's personal pictures.

1353
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:05,640
Its over!

1354
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,460
Something's gonna happen.

1355
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,740
Along with our lives...

1356
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,080
My sister's life has also got damaged.

1357
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,340
Dhanya! Listen to us.

1358
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,460
Lets stop it here.

1359
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,520
I can't take it anymore. Let's die.

1360
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,340
Let's die please.

1361
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,480
You know her right.

1362
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,340
You know how I care for my sister.

1363
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,400
But now, because of me...

1364
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,360
Dhanya, nothing will happen. Please control yourself.

1365
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,020
You stupid girls.

1366
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,600
You did everything and relaxing here?

1367
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,700
I should break your heads with these stones.

1368
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,620
You caused me a lot of trouble.

1369
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:09,160
Hello mam! Where are you going?  
You can't escape now.

1370
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:15,160
Are you really girls or some demons?

1371
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:20,900
Sir that day I just hit him unintentionally and he died.

1372
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,280
Did you hit him to kill him?

1373
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,860
No I just hit him to knock out and he died.

1374
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,440
Why did you want to hit him?

1375
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:29,280
Why would we want to hit him to kill him? 
He died after we hit him.

1376
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,200
Means you might have hit him to kill him right?

1377
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,860
Whatever is our intension to hit me,  
what can we do anything about it now

1378
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,960
What if that guy is dead?

1379
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,800
Sir if we want to kill him...

1380
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,520
Wait a minute!

1381
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,340
What did you say? 
-What if that guy dies?

1382
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,500
That means, he didn't die?

1383
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,520
So you hit him to kill him?

1384
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:55,220
Hey stop it!

1385
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,600
Just tell us what happened.

1386
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,580
That hotel manager is a good guy.

1387
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,300
After you hit him and ran away...

1388
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,540
He called me and gave me the information.

1389
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,640
He got fourteen stitches on his head.

1390
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:09,160
Till now it costed 120,000 and  
don't know how much will it cost more.

1391
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,640
He is still in the hospital and by luck I saw you guys.

1392
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,280
What you are running away from me. What is this?

1393
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,460
We'll give you that money.

1394
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,060
One minute!

1395
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,060
Take it! Keep it with you.

1396
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,440
So, he was not dead.

1397
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,180
What happened to this world?

1398
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:34,580
Its okay if a girl was given to four boys.

1399
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,200
But if a guy was given to four girls then...

1400
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:38,940
Oh My god!

1401
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,840
Thank god!

1402
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,240
If that hooker is alive, then who is troubling us like this?

1403
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,080
You idiots! That hotel manager is the culprit.

1404
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,240
If that body isn't of the hooker's...

1405
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,840
Then who's body is in that suitcase?

1406
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:02,740
For us to know any further details,  
we should get that hotel manager.

1407
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,420
And hit him, then we'll get all the information.

1408
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,720
Will you hit him too?

1409
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,680
Mam I can't understand what are you talking about.

1410
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,300
If he doesn't know it, then that Police should know.

1411
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,260
Correct!

1412
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,380
Police?

1413
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,220
Which Police?

1414
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,020
Your friend! 
-My friend?

1415
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,100
Oh god! What an actor!

1416
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,800
Why do we need him now?

1417
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,220
If you don't tell us what happened, we'll ask him.

1418
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,040
Please! Don't involve him in this.

1419
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,680
Don't involve him?

1420
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,620
Why are you so scared?

1421
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,260
Me? No I'm not!

1422
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,340
Me scared?

1423
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:13,320
Oh! Then you are scared. Tell us.

1424
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,020
Whose body is there in that suite case?

1425
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,460
What body mam?

1426
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,380
So you don't know? Come girls lets go.

1427
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,480
It seems like he is not scared of the Police.

1428
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,120
Mam! Why did you come?

1429
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:39,640
Tell me!

1430
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,880
Nothing bro! We'll just visit  
the near by Police station and be right back.

1431
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,340
No mam, please!

1432
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,560
I'll tell you everything, come back.

1433
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,580
The body in that suite case...

1434
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:57,980
Is my wife's!

1435
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:03,100
Its your wife's body?

1436
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,800
Me and my college mate had an affair.

1437
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,700
We used to meet in this hotel regularly.

1438
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,720
My wife suspected this.

1439
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,500
One day, when we are together...

1440
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:18,300
She came suddenly.

1441
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,820
When we three are fighting...

1442
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,220
Accidentally my wife's head hit the wall and...

1443
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,100
My time is so bad that at the same time...

1444
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,640
My friend has come.

1445
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,580
That Police officer.

1446
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,940
I thought of sending him saying something.

1447
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:50,820
At the same time you bumped in the way.

1448
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,880
He said that we should check your room.

1449
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,120
Why dude? 
-I should check!

1450
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,140
We went to your room.

1451
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,700
Its a dummy gun!

1452
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,420
After checking your room and coming back...

1453
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,320
I saw that your suite case is moving.

1454
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,980
I got doubt. So I sent my friend and...

1455
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:36,280
Again went to your room and opened the suite case.

1456
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,980
There is a seriously wounded stripper in that.

1457
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,220
He regularly comes to this hotel.

1458
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,280
So I called his people and handed him to them.

1459
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,640
I thought you ran away.

1460
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:53,020
I thought of placing my wife's body  
in that suite case and divert the case.

1461
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,920
But you've come back again and...

1462
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,720
Took the suite case with my wife's body.

1463
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:01,520
Oh dear god!

1464
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:04,580
You look like a junior artist roaming in the background.

1465
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,480
But you have so much in you.

1466
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,420
Hey! Where is my sister's phone?

1467
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,400
Your sister's phone?

1468
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,420
You are black mailing us from that phone, right?

1469
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:15,080
Why would I blackmail you mam?

1470
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,300
Someone else is blackmailing me for killing my wife.

1471
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:19,200
Blackmailing you?

1472
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:20,900
Yes! Here take a look.

1473
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,280
He's also getting messages from my sister's number.

1474
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:37,480
What? It is your sister's phone?

1475
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:43,020
That means, same guy is blackmailing us and him.

1476
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,740
All of us means...

1477
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,760
Is he blackmailing your girl friend too?

1478
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:49,700
I don't know that.

1479
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,620
He asked me not to tell  
anyone that I'm getting blackmailed.

1480
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,020
Hey! Call her now.

1481
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,880
Please no! I won't call her.

1482
01:37:59,120 --> 01:37:59,980
Siddi!

1483
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,920
When you get out of the hotel and take right.

1484
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:05,140
Is it fourth left?

1485
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,820
Yeah the one at the dead end.

1486
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:10,500
What mam?

1487
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,180
Your friend's police station.

1488
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,060
I didn't say I won't call her mam,  
I just asking a question should I call her?

1489
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,160
Hello Srujana! Did you eat?

1490
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,640
Come to Room 108.

1491
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,160
She is coming mam.

1492
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:29,060
Srujana means...

1493
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:31,880
Yes! The same one you are thinking.

1494
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:34,980
Its both of us sister.

1495
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:48,160
Hey stop! Why are running after seeing us?

1496
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,460
You... You... 
-Hey, Stop!

1497
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:54,580
Stop it!

1498
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,660
What sort of hotel is this. You left rods everywhere.

1499
01:38:57,940 --> 01:39:00,340
Its plumber's mistake mam. First you throw that away.

1500
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,980
Siddi give it to me.

1501
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,480
Tell me why are you running away?

1502
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,720
Noth... Noth... Noth... Nothing!

1503
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,440
She stammers too?

1504
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,380
Its not stammering mam. Its TikTok!

1505
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,080
After doing so many  
TikTok videos, she became like this.

1506
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,480
Is it? What did you do in TikTok? 
-Hey stop it!

1507
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:21,820
Do you know us?

1508
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,255
Will you tell or shall I inform 
 Police about the murder you both did?

1509
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:31,420
No.. No.. No.. No..

1510
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:32,100
Don't tell.

1511
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,080
Then tell us.

1512
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:42,300
I was the one who blackmailed you.

1513
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,640
What?

1514
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:51,060
Then, my sister's phone!

1515
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:53,620
How did you get that?

1516
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,480
I stole it from the stripper.

1517
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,000
You like it?

1518
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,280
First tell why are you blackmailing us.

1519
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:08,060
Wha.. Wha.. Wha.. Wha..

1520
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,140
Say it properly.

1521
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,080
What do I do?

1522
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,520
Someone is blackmailing me that if...

1523
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,620
I don't give me money,  
he'll tell my husband about my affair.

1524
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,860
So, not knowing what to do...

1525
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,220
I was blackmailing you for money.

1526
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,720
He said that if I tell anyone  
about this he'll leak the matter.

1527
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:28,680
For money, I had to blackmail him too.

1528
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,680
Srujana! You are the one blackmailing me?

1529
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,120
How can you do it when I love you so sincerely?

1530
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:36,520
Forget all that, give me my sister's phone. 
-Which phone?

1531
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,960
My sister's phone. The one which you are blackmailing.

1532
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,620
No.. No.. I don't have it.

1533
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:42,440
You don't?

1534
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,720
To get out of that blackmailing torture...

1535
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,640
I made a deal and gave it to them.

1536
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:55,160
I asked themselves to blackmail you.

1537
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,960
Whom did you gave the phone? Do you know them?

1538
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,680
No! Cinema... Cinema... Cinema...

1539
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:13,700
Like a cinema, they asked me  
to dump the phone in a dustbin at Baga beach.

1540
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:18,340
I still waited there for two hours  
to find out who it is but no one showed up.

1541
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,420
When I went and checked, the phone isn't there.

1542
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,720
From which number are you getting those messages?

1543
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:25,900
Here!

1544
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,220
Why is she calling me?

1545
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,360
See, its my sister's issue.

1546
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:44,200
Very sensitive matter.

1547
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,940
Without any drama, trace the number  
I'm going to give you and send me the location.

1548
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,320
Even after breaking up with her,  
she is still that arrogant girl.

1549
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,500
I'll do it. I don't have any option.

1550
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,440
What sort of place is this?

1551
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,560
Where exactly are we?

1552
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:20,220
Phone!

1553
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:11,060
The one who is blackmailing me  
all these days is my husband?

1554
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,620
Oh my god! I think he knows our affair.

1555
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,740
Come! Come!

1556
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:37,680
Why are you all here?

1557
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,260
We thought you were a gentleman.  
But didn't expect you to behave like this.

1558
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:44,820
Did they find it or what?

1559
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,140
What are you talking about? 
-About your blackmail!

1560
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:51,760
You guys are joking right?

1561
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,680
Who's joking here you moron!

1562
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:59,860
Whenever we say the truth,  
you'll always laugh like a idiot saying joke.

1563
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,615
Yours have a stupid sense of humor

1564
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,835
I don't understand what you guys are talking about.

1565
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,320
We are telling the truth.

1566
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,620
Its okay that you knew it.  
But please don't tell my friend about it.

1567
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,400
Not only your friend, your wife too knows it.

1568
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,120
She knew it? 
-yes!

1569
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:20,420
Why the hell are you blackmailing your wife?

1570
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:24,080
Why would I blackmail, when  
someone else is blackmailing me already.

1571
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:27,180
Who is that?

1572
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:29,400
Yeah! Its this guy.

1573
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:42,680
Him?

1574
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:46,060
Means this is his phone?

1575
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,560
Then where is our phone?

1576
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,780
What's your phone? Its my phone he stole.

1577
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:51,740
Our phone is also with him.

1578
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,540
Not yours, not mine, he has no phone with him.

1579
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,680
Where the hell he kept it?

1580
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:01,600
By the way, if your phone  
is with him, what's the problem?

1581
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:05,900
Oh! I got it.

1582
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:09,160
Are there any photos of yours having romance in it?

1583
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,300
Yew! No.

1584
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,200
You said you too.

1585
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:19,620
Means are there photos of  
you having romance in that phone?

1586
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,440
Why are you asking like that, you already knew it right.

1587
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,440
No we didn't till now. 
-You didn't?

1588
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:25,720
But now we know it.

1589
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,580
Then what's the one you said you knew it before?

1590
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,800
We are just kidding.

1591
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:32,440
What, its a joke?

1592
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,760
Yeah a joke!

1593
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:39,760
Did he know that he is blackmailing his wife too?

1594
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,915
What? Did he blackmailing my girl friend too?

1595
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,760
Not your girl friend boss, your wife.

1596
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,600
My wife? Why is he blackmailing my wife?

1597
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:52,020
Oh god! Looks like they gonna tell him everything.

1598
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,840
Like you she is also...

1599
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,600
As you have great sense of humor, they are joking.

1600
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:04,260
Oh its a joke!

1601
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,080
Why are you here?

1602
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,900
They are my friends... friends... friends...

1603
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,620
You... Why would be we friends?

1604
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:17,400
What? Why are you playing piano in the air?

1605
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:22,540
You murdered someone, got us into it,  
blackmailed us and now you say that we are friends?

1606
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:24,440
Murder? What murder?

1607
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,640
If that murder matter gets out, then I'll be finished.

1608
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,940
Dude its not murder, its money order.

1609
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:37,820
They didn't pay the hotel bill  
so they sent it by money order.

1610
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,100
You know their sense of humor right?

1611
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:43,880
Why are you here?

1612
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,680
I came here to tell you that  
they have a very good sense of humor.

1613
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:48,480
No sir!

1614
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,800
They are diverting you from their illegal affair.

1615
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,060
Why do we have to talk about affairs now?

1616
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:58,000
Oh god! Its not about your illegal affair.

1617
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:01,580
You have an illegal affair... affair... affair... affair...

1618
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,860
I don't have that many affairs.

1619
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,400
You come here once. Whats this nonsense?

1620
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:13,880
Its all happening for my bad.

1621
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,620
First please listen to me.

1622
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:17,760
What doesn't you want them to say? 
-Why did you come?

1623
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,040
I'll tell you what not to tell.  
You wait here for two minutes.

1624
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,060
Crazy people. i asked the girls to come, but they came.

1625
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,940
Please don't tell them this matter, because...

1626
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,720
We will tell you sir, because you should know it.

1627
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:34,580
Your wife is having an illegal affair with your best friend.

1628
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,740
I know it!

1629
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,940
I know it!

1630
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:40,820
They kind of worse feeling I would have when my  
wife have an affair with my best friend...

1631
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,360
He will have the same worse feeling now right?

1632
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,280
It happened then...

1633
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,540
What! What!

1634
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:52,920
If my friend know that me and  
his wife are having an illegal affair...

1635
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:55,020
He will be pretty devastated right?

1636
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,560
Oh dear god! Everyone here is a criminal.

1637
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,840
Why are you so sexually desperate?

1638
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:10,060
Oh! That's why you took that case so seriously?

1639
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,500
Case! What case?

1640
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,400
Suite case, bridge, dead body.

1641
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:16,640
There is no dead body.

1642
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,535
We do a lot of things to cover our pending cases.

1643
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,240
All these diversions are part of it.

1644
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,220
Why do we need all that in this situation?

1645
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:28,500
Actually sir, your friend's  
wife was dead, kept in a suite case...

1646
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,200
And was thrown under a bridge. 
-What are you saying?

1647
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,180
She is not dead. She is totally fine.

1648
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,380
You just had a misunderstanding.

1649
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,100
We had a misunderstanding?

1650
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:42,580
Actually! What's your problem?

1651
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,560
You won't listen to us properly  
from the beginning you #idiot.

1652
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:51,500
Your friend's wife is really dead... dead... dead!

1653
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:02,740
Do you think they told him?

1654
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,200
Looks like they did.

1655
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,840
Dude first listen to me.

1656
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:21,800
Actually what happened is...

1657
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:27,460
I didn't kill her. I can explain you everything.

1658
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:29,840
I swear I didn't kill her.

1659
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,660
You killed her!

1660
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,140
You only killed her.

1661
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,660
Not telling me that your wife was killed...

1662
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:39,300
You...

1663
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,040
You killed our friendship.

1664
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,000
You did kill our friendship.

1665
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,200
Looks like he still didn't know the matter.

1666
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:56,400
When his wife is dead, why are you reacting so much?

1667
01:50:59,020 --> 01:50:59,620
Its...

1668
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,580
Its like that.

1669
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,240
Its something different.

1670
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:13,240
Now all I was left are the photos in that phone.

1671
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,940
Hey! Where's that phone?

1672
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,640
For our affair to be kept as a secret...

1673
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:23,460
We should smash that fatso.

1674
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:28,200
If the suite case matter was a diversion drama, then...

1675
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,520
Where is that Manager's wife?

1676
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,160
You are right. Where is she?

1677
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:36,000
Why do we care all that.  
We want my sister's phone that's it.

1678
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,340
If we hit him hard, he'll tell everything.

1679
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:47,340
Here he comes.

1680
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,300
Here comes my friend.

1681
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,380
You dumb-ass idiots!

1682
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,280
If you lay a hand on my friend...

1683
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:06,240
Your photos will be in Google and  
videos will be flowing in YouTube.

1684
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:09,160
Then life long sitting at home...

1685
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,980
You will live by making TikTok videos.

1686
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,680
Keep the rods down.

1687
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:21,340
So you are the one who is blackmailing us all?

1688
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,040
Yes! Its me.

1689
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:24,640
Did you get my phone?

1690
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:26,560
First give me my phone.

1691
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,820
There are a lot of memories in it.

1692
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:31,400
Memories? I bought you more than that.

1693
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:39,420
There is no one there.

1694
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:43,100
Hey! Didn't I tell you to come when I snap my fingers?

1695
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,920
Where did you get these TikTok artists?

1696
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,640
Okay! I'll snap it again, come.

1697
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,020
My darling is safe.

1698
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,200
Darling!

1699
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:08,780
Why is he excited so much seeing her?

1700
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,060
Are you alright? Nothing happened to you right?

1701
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,060
Yeah! I'm alive and fine.

1702
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:17,840
They all said you died. 
I almost couldn't catch breathe, you know!

1703
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,520
Hey, your wife is alive.

1704
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,620
She is fine. Look at her.

1705
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,680
Why are you so relieved?

1706
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,060
What's the relation between you both?

1707
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,360
Huh? The same relation between you and my husband.

1708
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:31,900
What are you saying?

1709
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,960
My wife and him... 
- Yes!

1710
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,660
Right answer!

1711
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,620
Hanky-panky!

1712
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:43,160
Do you get it now? She is that Manager's wife.

1713
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:47,340
To unveil their extra-marital affair,

1714
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,520
...she asked me to blackmail them.

1715
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,220
Then why did you blackmail me?

1716
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:57,480
My lover said she picks money over heart.

1717
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:58,400
What?

1718
01:53:59,020 --> 01:53:59,880
That's why.

1719
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,860
You frog-face.

1720
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:06,040
I asked you to blackmail her. 
Why did you blackmail my man?

1721
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,240
Hey!

1722
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:10,940
It was in the briefcase. How did that body come here?

1723
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,420
Oh manager! Looks like you are in a hurry.

1724
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:17,340
I'll tell you. Close your eyes and open your ears.

1725
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:21,440
One evening I was waiting near Rose's room 
to paint her wearing the locket,

1726
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:24,480
someone's going into the room and coming back.

1727
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:28,060
I was suspicious so I went in to the room. Nothing!

1728
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:29,900
When I was coming out,

1729
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:32,540
I saw a suitcase moving.

1730
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:35,200
I thought its a cat and opened it.

1731
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,820
Your girls was inside.

1732
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,560
I was shocked.

1733
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:40,740
I didn't understand what's going on.

1734
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:44,780
I already tried a lot to make Rose stay back.

1735
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,700
But they hurt me badly and left anyway.

1736
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:53,040
She told me everything when she woke up.

1737
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,900
Then I realized. You know what?

1738
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,640
That you both are hanky-panky.

1739
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,940
I understood one more thing when 
I found this cop's phone.

1740
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:04,920
You know what again?

1741
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:08,720
That you both are same hanky-panky.

1742
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:09,480
so...

1743
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:11,900
Did you blackmail them all for me?

1744
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,740
Not for you, Rose.

1745
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,540
For the love I have on you.

1746
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,000
But I changed my opinion now. 
- Why?

1747
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:24,820
You did everything.

1748
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,800
Didn't you love each other before marriage?

1749
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,880
What are you doing now? Hanky-Panky!

1750
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,400
But my friend,

1751
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,540
he stayed by my side in all my highs and lows

1752
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,300
...but never went after anyone else.

1753
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,280
He was even ready to die for me and 
came here in my place.

1754
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,480
That's when I realized the value of friendship.

1755
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,140
Hey!

1756
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,720
We don't care about your nonsense.

1757
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:51,320
Just give us our phones back.

1758
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,380
What do you want now? Your phones?

1759
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,560
Here's your phone.

1760
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,920
(My sister's phone.)

1761
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:00,440
So grateful for that!

1762
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:03,200
Hey tik-tok! here's your phone with your photos.

1763
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:04,660
Danny, is that our phone?

1764
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,740
Mr. Cop!

1765
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,660
Here's your phone filled with memories.

1766
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:08,740
