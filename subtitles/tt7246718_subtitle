1
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,583
When India gained independence,

2
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:14,246
I was posted in Gurgaon
to control the civil unrest.

3
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:18,958
That's when we were informed that
Kashmir was under attack by militants.

4
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:23,413
The Sikh regiment was flown down
to Srinagar overnight.

5
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:28,286
Through various operations,
we started taking back control

6
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:32,705
of the areas occupied by them.

7
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,791
Even I was involved
in one such dangerous operation.

8
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:48,995
Let's go.

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,630
Come on.

10
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,211
Come on! Spread everywhere!

11
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,251
Take your positions!

12
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,666
Go over there!

13
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,916
Move ahead.

14
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,205
Keep moving ahead!

15
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,165
Soldiers...

16
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,501
Somebody save my daughter!

17
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,203
Please help!

18
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,961
Move ahead.

19
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,833
Cover him!

20
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,626
Run!

21
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,038
Come on, run!

22
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,205
Run!

23
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,586
They are coming near!

24
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,245
Run for your life!

25
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,668
Hold this!

26
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,996
Well done!

27
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,671
You're quite brave, Brother-in-law.

28
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,750
You play with death.

29
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,165
When it's about the security
of the country,

30
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,211
a soldier has to befriend death.

31
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:54,284
Do you get it?

32
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,745
You are right.

33
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,165
A country can't be safe
without an army.

34
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,333
Go to sleep now.

35
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,211
He is here for another month.

36
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,841
There's ample time to hear such stories.

37
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,876
Drink milk and go to sleep.

38
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,458
You all have to go harvesting tomorrow.

39
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,165
You're here to help harvest the fields.
Don't get us embarrassed.

40
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,033
She's right.

41
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,453
Let's sleep.

42
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,668
We must at least harvest
three fields tomorrow.

43
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,841
You should sleep too.

44
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,128
I'm not coming.
I can't sleep without dad.

45
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,251
Even I can't sleep without my child.

46
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,453
I'll sleep with her.

47
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,995
-What do you think?
-Yes!

48
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,246
Come on, boys.

49
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,039
Have enough milk.

50
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:32,084
I don't want anyone complaining
of being tired in the morning.

51
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,626
No, Brother.
We'll give it our best tomorrow.

52
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,288
We won't let you win.

53
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:43,498
We'll see who wins in the morning.

54
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,840
What do you think?

55
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,413
Guys, last night you were saying
you'll give in your best!

56
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,125
Are you already drained out?

57
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,210
It's just afternoon.

58
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,453
We make sure to finish
harvesting by evening.

59
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,745
Sister-in-law is here.

60
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,167
Let's eat first and then work.

61
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,090
We'll then show him how it's done.

62
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,040
Come on! Let's eat first.

63
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,628
Come on! Let's eat.

64
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,131
Come here, Uncle.

65
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,628
Come on, let's have food.

66
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,710
Wait a minute! I'll serve you all.

67
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,590
Hey! Hey!

68
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,921
At least enjoy your meal in peace.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,630
This is what we all work so hard for.

70
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,873
I couldn't handle my hunger.

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,210
We've been really slogging it out
since morning.

72
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,283
Let me also know what you've achieved.

73
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,035
Eat like human beings.

74
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,085
Or else, Gurdayal,
you won't give them food.

75
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,288
Come on, let's have it.

76
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,375
Where's your discipline?

77
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,588
What's does "discipline" mean, Joginder?

78
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,000
It means nothing to you.

79
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,086
Go, eat.

80
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,171
Idiot!

81
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,670
-Serve me the food.
-Come on, have it.

82
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,790
Have it, dear.

83
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,420
Here you go.

84
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,206
What's the matter, Brother?
Why are you eating so slowly?

85
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,706
You should take time to chew your food.

86
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,498
It increases blood count.

87
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,250
You all took so long to eat.

88
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,873
Come on, let's get back to work.

89
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,248
-Come along.
-Coming, Uncle.

90
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,590
Come on now.

91
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Have it.

92
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,916
Please eat, Sister-in-law.

93
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,288
Oh, no!

94
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,415
Chew properly!
It increases your blood count.

95
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,338
Of course! She'll chew well.

96
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,663
Let's go.

97
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,840
Come on, have it.

98
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,998
Brother, an announcement was
made on the radio

99
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,283
that all the soldiers' leaves
have been canceled.

100
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,245
They've been called back on duty!

101
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,415
This is All India Radio, Delhi.

102
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,036
Today's headlines.

103
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,418
The Government of India has decided

104
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,960
to deploy the army

105
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,663
on the North-Eastern border

106
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,590
in response to the ever increasing
disturbance by Chinese forces.

107
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:43,205
The Prime Minister of India,
Mr. Jawahar Lal Nehru

108
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,711
has appealed to all the soldiers on leave,

109
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,791
to cancel them and

110
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,415
report back to their headquarters.

111
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,085
And also inform your officer in charge.

112
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,285
Victory to India!

113
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,125
With that, we come to the end
of this news bulletin.

114
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,123
Brother, what could it be?

115
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,628
Dad, will you...

116
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,708
They need to go since they've been
called by the government.

117
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,873
Here you go. Give him the food.

118
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,705
Serve it in a plate.

119
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,705
I am coming.

120
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,460
Here, my son, have some.

121
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,665
Remember this when you're at war.

122
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,166
You can repay a mother
for her nurturing,

123
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,453
but you can't ever repay the motherland.

124
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,131
Son, promise me

125
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,840
you'll protect the motherland
till your last breath.

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,670
Remember the sacrifices of our Gurus.

127
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
Don't give up.

128
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,920
Don't worry, Mother.

129
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,878
Joginder does not falter.

130
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,873
Live long, dear.

131
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,040
Can't you go later?

132
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,586
What are you saying, Gurdayal?

133
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,833
Is this the first time I'm going
for a war?

134
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,251
I've gone so many times.

135
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,373
It was different then.

136
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,205
It was just the two of us then.

137
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,630
Now we have responsibilities.

138
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,921
Think about our children.

139
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,711
I am going for the sake of
many others like them.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,920
Someone has to protect our borders.

141
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,535
Be grateful to the Lord,

142
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,956
for having chosen his disciple
for such a noble job.

143
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,873
May the Lord keep you safe.

144
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,286
I'm getting all kinds of bad thoughts.

145
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,541
God will take care of everything.

146
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,415
See me off with a smile.

147
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,335
Bless you, Son.

148
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,416
Do well, my dear.

149
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,630
Dad.

150
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,666
Yes, my princess.

151
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,380
What's this?

152
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:32,171
When you are away,
I'll sleep with grandma.

153
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,960
But, how will you sleep without me?

154
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,835
So, please take my favorite doll
with you.

155
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,626
Whenever you sleep, keep her with you.

156
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,920
You'll get a sound sleep.

157
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:19,035
Soldiers, the neighbors,
who we've considered friends,

158
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:24,835
and had amicable relations with...

159
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,743
have been infiltrating our borders
since the past few months

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,750
attacking the nearby villages

161
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,458
and killing innocent people.

162
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,291
Despite Prime Minister,
Jawahar Lal Nehru's efforts,

163
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:46,376
our enemy aren't backing off.

164
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,090
It doesn't seem that the issue

165
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,535
can be resolved peacefully any more.

166
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,461
So soldiers, be prepared.

167
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:04,166
It's time to teach our enemy
a befitting lesson!

168
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,747
Soldiers, our country has always been

169
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,036
a peace loving nation.

170
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,748
But, it doesn't mean that the enemy
can take an undue advantage.

171
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,038
We'll never let it happen!

172
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,126
We are determined to win

173
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,165
or die trying to save our country!

174
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,036
How will you sleep without me?

175
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,338
Please take my favorite doll with you.

176
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:15,289
Soldiers, it's time to teach
our enemy a lesson!

177
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,375
The Sikh regiment soldiers

178
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,416
can happily sacrifice their lives
for our country,

179
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,251
but can never let the enemy succeed
in their foul play.

180
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,748
I promise, as long as
Subedar Joginder Singh

181
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,705
and his troop are alive

182
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
the enemy cannot set foot

183
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,165
on our motherland till the last bullet!

184
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,210
Guru Gobind Singh has said,

185
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:45,785
"If your enemy compels you and
leaves you with no other option,

186
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,166
then it is right to pick the sword."

187
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,168
"When everything has been tried,
yet justice is not in sight.

188
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,250
It is then the right time to pick up
the sword and fight!"

189
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,583
Victory, in the name of the Lord!

190
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,838
The Lord, the ultimate truth.

191
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:09,875
Maan Singh, the demarcation line between
the two mountains is called Mc Mahon Line.

192
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:17,376
The troops of the Assam Rifles are keeping
a watch on the enemy from there.

193
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,338
Remember, Maan Singh

194
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,286
the Assam Rifles troop can only
keep a watch on the enemy.

195
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,420
If the enemy makes a move,

196
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,090
Joginder Singh and his post will be
the first in the line of fire.

197
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,873
You know that Joginder Singh
is the most experienced

198
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,628
and brave soldier from our regiment.

199
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:44,456
With him there, no one can breach his post
and move forward.

200
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,421
We always thought that
after Tibet was free,

201
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:57,243
we wouldn't have to give up
this area to India.

202
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,873
But, we're good friends with India.

203
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,286
India has severed that friendship

204
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,745
by sheltering our enemy, Dalai Lama.

205
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:15,631
You know that India is chanting
slogans of our brotherhood.

206
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,668
Let India remain

207
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,123
under this illusion.

208
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,880
We have to fulfill our goal.

209
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,913
Come here and collect your letters.

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,710
Have I got a letter?
In Santokh Singh's name?

211
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,791
-My mother's letter would've come.
-Easy, guys.

212
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,335
Take your letters.

213
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,746
Come and collect it.

214
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,083
What about my letter? Give it to me.

215
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,243
Is this your final decision?

216
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,243
Then, hear me out.

217
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,872
I consider you dead for me.

218
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,624
Get out of my sight!

219
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,671
What's the matter, buddy?

220
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,415
I've noticed that whenever
the letters come, you become sad.

221
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
What's the matter?

222
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,583
Nothing as such.

223
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,333
Listen up.

224
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,623
Amidst these barren mountains,

225
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,333
we only have each other
to share our sorrows with.

226
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,706
Nothing great.

227
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,246
My exam results came
and I passed in the first division.

228
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,243
I was excited to tell my father.

229
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,833
Father! Father!

230
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,495
I passed!

231
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,493
Great news! Good job!

232
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,535
-Brother, did you pass?
-Yes, Sister.

233
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,625
-Mom, bless me.
-May God bless you, my dear.

234
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:55,993
Son.

235
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,540
I'm very happy for you.

236
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,538
Go to Firozpur tomorrow
and fill in a form.

237
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,035
But, Father...

238
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,339
I want to go to England to study further.

239
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,041
You already know

240
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,880
that every man in this family
after his education,

241
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,248
serves the country by joining in the army.

242
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,170
But, Father, I don't want
to join the army!

243
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,783
If this is your final decision,

244
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,788
then hear me out.

245
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,841
I consider you dead for me.

246
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,416
Get out of my sight!

247
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,001
I was about to go abroad.

248
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,751
But I thought, how could I remain happy
upsetting my father?

249
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,832
Hence, I enrolled in the army.

250
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,992
After my training, I got posted here.

251
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,705
You fulfilled your father's dream.

252
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,378
Now, what's the problem?

253
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,288
The problem is that it was the first time
I argued with my father.

254
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,413
I was so ashamed
that I couldn't face him.

255
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,461
Bahadur Singh, you never wanted
your father to be unhappy.

256
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,706
But, he's still unhappy.

257
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,000
Write to him that his boy
has enrolled in the army.

258
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:13,122
As soon as he reads the letter,
he will be filled with pride.

259
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,875
Hey, Bahadur!

260
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,130
Hey, Saudagar!

261
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,040
Catch Ajaib Singh!

262
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,495
Catch him! Catch him!

263
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,416
Leave me!

264
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,710
Catch him.

265
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,921
Please let me go!

266
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,670
-Take this!
-Let me read...

267
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,589
Give me my letter back.

268
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,916
Listen up! Fresh off the press!

269
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,123
If you read my letter
any further, I'll shoot you!

270
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,918
You can shoot me with a cannon,
but I'll still read your letter.

271
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,960
-Go on. Read it.
-Listen.

272
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,953
My love, we're married now

273
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,668
but I still haven't seen your face.

274
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,840
Even the barber is luckier than me.

275
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,786
He's at least seen your face.

276
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,918
Give me my letter...

277
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,839
Let's see sister-in-law's photograph.

278
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,036
Wait, there's more.

279
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,040
My younger sister was saying that

280
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,248
you have green cat-like eyes.

281
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,920
Whenever a cat comes
and messes the utensils,

282
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:14,421
she teases me by calling it
brother-in-law.

283
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,125
What's so funny?

284
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,038
The cat!

285
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,585
Please! I beg you!

286
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,536
-Don't read any further.
-Read it.

287
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:21,743
Soldiers!

288
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,748
My respect, sir!

289
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:25,878
What's happening here?

290
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:30,671
Sir, Baba, Balbir and Bahadur,
these three fools

291
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,246
always read my love letters

292
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,836
and make fun of me in front
of everyone!

293
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,246
Never make fun of anyone's love.

294
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,248
What do you know of love?

295
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,033
We don't. Please tell us.

296
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,999
Son...

297
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,878
the moneylender has taken possession
of our land as well.

298
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,124
They don't even let me enter.

299
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,000
Come back soon, Son.

300
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,123
Sir, soldiers are deployed all around.

301
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,920
Okay. But still, be very alert.

302
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,041
Yes, sir.

303
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,421
Who's letter is it?

304
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,340
Tears in Nayak Santokh Singh's eyes?

305
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,376
Baba Singh!

306
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,171
Life is always full of joys and sorrows.

307
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,283
It's a letter from my mother.

308
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,785
A mother's letter brings joy.

309
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,167
But you look sad.

310
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,210
Sir, I had to pawn my land
for my father's treatment.

311
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,663
And I could not release it.

312
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,745
Don't lose heart over a land.

313
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,285
It's not about the land.

314
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,284
It's about my father's grave
on that land.

315
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,625
I couldn't return the money,

316
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,206
hence they took over the land.

317
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,038
They don't even let my mother
light a lamp on his grave.

318
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,245
Subedar Joginder Singh
is like your elder brother.

319
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,000
If you need money,
take my salary for a month or two.

320
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,460
Thank you, sir.

321
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,250
But, I'll save my salary
and repay my debt.

322
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:51,251
Sir, the tap at my home
is damaged too.

323
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,083
-If I could get half a month's salary...
-Baba Singh!

324
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,461
It's alright.
We'll pull buckets from the well.

325
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:00,125
Keep faith, soldier.
And write to your mother.

326
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,993
The Lord will take care of everything.

327
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,338
Oh, Lord!

328
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,591
Swaran, what's the matter?
Why do you look so worried?

329
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,246
-A lion.
-A lion?

330
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,374
I swear I heard a lion roar.

331
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:01,995
I may survive the Chinese
but I think this lion will eat me alive.

332
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,876
There's no lion in this area.

333
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,130
I think those three idiots
are making you one.

334
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,335
-What?
-A buffoon.

335
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,336
They trouble me too.

336
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,246
Forget that.

337
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,583
But, tell me, why are you so scared?

338
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:18,538
To tell you the truth,

339
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,205
I joined the army because
all my friends were doing so.

340
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,288
I didn't know I'd be surrounded by death.

341
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:28,166
Listen to me!
Try to overcome your fear.

342
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,380
The more you get scared,
the more your fear will increase.

343
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,088
Be a brave soldier.

344
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,168
What happened?

345
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,336
I came to give your radio.
You forgot it there.

346
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,784
Listen to the news.
I've heard there's a lion in the area.

347
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,455
I don't see Baba Singh anywhere.

348
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,497
He's gone to the base camp.

349
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,243
-Soldiers!
-Yes, sir!

350
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,453
-Cleaning up well?
-Yes, sir.

351
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,790
Keep at it.

352
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:11,785
Yes, sir.

353
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:15,131
Tear down the bunker
and trenches

354
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,168
or the Chinese will kill you.

355
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,916
Tashi, what's this old man saying?

356
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:23,211
The old man is asking us
to break down the bunker

357
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,631
or we will all be killed.

358
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,041
There's no need to worry
as long as we are here.

359
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,285
Please don't construct a bunker here, sir.

360
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,496
The Chinese soldiers consider this
as their area.

361
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,875
They're lying.

362
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,920
This area belongs to India.

363
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,631
But, when we tell this to the
Chinese soldiers, they get furious.

364
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,290
Son, you don't know
how terrifying they are.

365
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,745
They're very cruel.

366
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:58,585
Once a child from my village made
a small wall of stones to play with.

367
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,540
They couldn't tolerate even that.

368
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,164
They thought it to be a ploy.

369
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,875
The next day they came
to our village and...

370
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,460
Don't worry.

371
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,788
The government has sent us here
to protect you.

372
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,211
Okay.

373
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,341
Hurry! Move!

374
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,168
This land belongs to us.

375
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:43,288
If you don't want to die
at Commander Pong's hands, go back.

376
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,498
Commander Pong.

377
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:09,418
Even history is witness, that wherever
the Sikh regiment is posted,

378
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,341
even death has to change its course.

379
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:16,875
Our gurus have taught us, neither take
what's rightfully someone else's

380
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,341
nor let anyone seize what's ours.

381
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,588
"One who neither frightens anyone,

382
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,670
nor is afraid of anyone."

383
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,250
Victory, in the name of the Lord!

384
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:44,413
The Lord, the ultimate truth!

385
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,876
Indians and Chinese, are brothers.

386
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:19,746
Were there any casualties?

387
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,168
Sir, do you have any orders for me
if this happens again?

388
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,630
You have to stay alert
and keep an eye on the enemy's activity.

389
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,250
In case of any casualty
during your patrol,

390
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:36,165
you know what you need to do.

391
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,590
Sir, I've learnt from you.

392
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,628
Never let the enemy leave alive
from our area.

393
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:45,290
Sir, the enemy has fired
at Joginder Singh's post.

394
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:51,088
Delta Tiger,
you must gauge them now.

395
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:53,745
Greetings, sir!

396
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,041
That's strange. He didn't hear me.

397
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,340
Greetings, sir!

398
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,628
Sir, have you considered my request?

399
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,088
Shut up.

400
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,881
Stop repeating the same thing.

401
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,245
How did the Chinese cross
the Mc Mahon Line?

402
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,921
This is a grave situation.

403
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,920
Sir, that's why I request you
to grant me permission

404
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,040
to go patrolling in the enemy's area.

405
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,205
That too, during the day.

406
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,203
So that we get correct information
about their position and power.

407
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,130
No.

408
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:35,748
I know you have more
war experience than I do but

409
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,125
not just me,
even the Commanding Officer

410
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,248
will not give you the
permission to go there.

411
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,333
But Joginder is right, sir.

412
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:46,878
The Chinese army crossing
our border in broad daylight,

413
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,665
proves their dangerous intentions.

414
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,203
No, Joginder Singh.

415
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,996
I cannot give you the permission
to go there and risk your life.

416
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,996
Sir, don't worry about my life.

417
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,415
This information is important
for the country,

418
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,591
not Joginder Singh.

419
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,336
But, no.

420
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,628
But, you must give it a try, sir.

421
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,130
After all, the country's security
depends on it.

422
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,378
No. It's impossible.

423
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,250
I cannot allow such risky patrolling.

424
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,038
Joginder Singh is an emotional soldier.

425
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,538
And I respect his sentiments.

426
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:29,623
But, no soldier returns alive
after patrolling in the day.

427
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,788
Sir, Joginder Singh knows
what he's saying.

428
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,703
He's ready to take
this risk for the country.

429
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:41,878
Such orders can be passed only during
a war or extreme circumstances.

430
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:45,748
The enemy is misusing our friendship
to attack us in broad daylight

431
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:49,668
while we're chanting slogans
of brotherhood.

432
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What could be worse, sir?

433
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:56,953
The country we trusted,
has stabbed us in our back.

434
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,130
Sir, this patrolling can help us
collect important information

435
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,878
about the enemy's plan
and their location.

436
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,088
During such a patrol, God forbid,
if there's any casualty,

437
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:10,587
it can impact the morale of our company.

438
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,586
Sir, you can count on Joginder Singh.

439
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,091
He'll return successful
from this patrol mission.

440
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,416
How can you be so sure?

441
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,670
During the Burma War, he's carried out
even more dangerous operations with me.

442
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,541
Come here quickly!

443
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,918
Get me the medical kit!

444
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,750
Get it quickly! Hurry up!

445
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,708
Joginder, go get him some water.

446
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,626
Go.

447
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,458
Here, have some water.

448
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:25,881
Have it.

449
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,500
Sir, do we take that as a yes?

450
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,751
Santokh Singh, how many are left?

451
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,378
Only 12 remaining.

452
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,750
-Report to the headquarters immediately.
-Yes, sir.

453
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,663
Greetings, sir!

454
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:03,625
Sir, did you hear that the government
doesn't have any bullets.

455
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,538
We're cleaning our guns unnecessarily.

456
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,745
Think about it.

457
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,412
If you don't have any bullets

458
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,420
how will you fight the Chinese?

459
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,835
Not "you" but "we".

460
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,130
Yes, sir!

461
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,665
You can look into it.

462
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,460
How did you find out?

463
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,878
Heard it on the news.

464
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,875
-Santokh Singh, confiscate this.
-Yes, sir.

465
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,956
-Sir, but it's not a tiny matter.
-Don't you dare!

466
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:32,335
If you ever repeat such
a cowardly act at my post,

467
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,996
you may even face a court martial.

468
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,243
I just heard it on the radio--

469
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,783
-Santokh Singh!
-Yes, sir.

470
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,878
Swaran Singh will run
with his backpack for an hour.

471
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,628
-Okay, sir.
-How am I at fault? I was just...

472
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,878
Make that two hours.

473
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,993
Come, shall we go or you want
to increase it by another hour?

474
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,841
Give me the mirror.
I want to tie my turban.

475
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:05,996
I'm tying my turban, too.

476
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,993
I am not looking at the
Chinese border through it.

477
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,001
I'll be late.
I need to be on duty now.

478
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,790
Your lovingly, Ajaib.

479
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,668
Hey!

480
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,338
Let go of me.

481
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,746
Baba, I'll tell sir.

482
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,130
You can tell sir while I'll tell everyone.

483
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,245
Return my letter.
Have some shame.

484
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,953
My sweet darling.

485
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:49,245
Sweetheart, I've only seen
your trembling hands.

486
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,958
I don't know when
that day will arrive

487
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:56,341
when you will get me a glass of milk
with your delicate hands.

488
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,458
I'll shoot you.

489
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:05,458
Now, I even see you in the bullets,
guns and bombs.

490
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,841
I will not spare you!

491
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,380
I even see you in
my fair complexioned friend, Saudagar.

492
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:17,123
I swear to God,
I never wrote that!

493
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,591
Hey, Ajaib...

494
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,458
Come on, run!

495
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,670
Let me go!

496
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:29,541
Hey...

497
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,748
-Yes, sir!
-Victory to India, sir!

498
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,623
-Stand up!
-Okay, sir!

499
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,630
Despite coming from the same town
you all are fighting like kids.

500
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:43,088
Is that how of
Subedar Joginder Singh's platoon behaves?

501
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:44,418
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

502
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:49,163
Sir, how can one read
someone's love letter in public?

503
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,670
It's so embarrassing.
As if you're... As if you're...

504
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,630
Naked?

505
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:54,588
Exactly!

506
00:42:54,666 --> 00:43:00,246
Ajaib Singh, a brave soldier is one who
can bare his heart in front of everyone.

507
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:04,873
Sir, there are some matters which
you can't share with everyone.

508
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:05,788
Such as?

509
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:06,835
Dirty talks, sir.

510
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,631
Tell me.

511
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:09,708
The matters of the heart.

512
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:10,791
Matters of the...

513
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:13,631
Baba Singh.

514
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,415
The matters of the heart?
At the border?

515
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:21,751
Fool, it's easiest to express
your feelings.

516
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:22,878
How is that so?

517
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,091
Why fear to speak your heart?

518
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:27,251
He gets scared

519
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,000
How will you fight at the border?

520
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:38,706
Why fear to speak your heart?

521
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,036
How will you fight at the border?

522
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,205
Tell me, my friend

523
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,123
What are you secretly reading?

524
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,953
What are you secretly reading?

525
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,783
What are you secretly reading?

526
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:51,955
Letters

527
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:53,913
Oh, these letters

528
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,533
The letters come

529
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,708
They make us wait so much

530
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,538
It gives immense joy

531
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,380
They comfort us too

532
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,626
The letters come

533
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,340
They make us wait so much

534
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,540
It gives immense joy

535
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,703
They comfort us too

536
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,751
The letters come

537
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,458
They make us wait so much

538
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,841
I dream of a wedding

539
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,083
The bangles of my newly wed wife

540
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,665
I dream of the path

541
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,745
Where she awaits

542
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:40,876
The paths of my town

543
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,916
The paths of my town

544
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:47,791
The mother who cascades
Encouraging words, before goodbyes

545
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,878
And showers her blessings

546
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:51,878
And showers her blessings

547
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,501
Father's caution

548
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,589
Encourages us

549
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:57,631
Letters...

550
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,708
Oh, these letters

551
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,035
Oh, these letters

552
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,209
The letters come

553
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,375
They make us wait so much

554
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,125
It gives us immense joy

555
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,246
They comfort us too

556
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,333
The letters come

557
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,378
They make us wait so much

558
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,246
It gives us immense joy

559
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,289
They comfort us too

560
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,416
The letters come

561
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,585
They make us wait so much

562
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,091
We're children of that God

563
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,208
We're steadfast

564
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,670
In the bitter cold

565
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,993
Or under the scorching sun

566
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,083
Or under the scorching sun

567
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:53,875
Or under the scorching sun

568
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,250
Strong arms

569
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,208
Stronger intentions

570
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,710
Ready to sacrifice for our honor

571
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,788
There lies our passion

572
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,128
Ready to sacrifice for our honor

573
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,540
There lies our passion

574
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,955
The letters come

575
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:12,041
They make us wait so much

576
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,881
It gives us immense joy

577
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,841
They comfort us too

578
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,746
The letters come

579
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,458
They make us wait so much

580
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,958
Listen up

581
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,165
Listen up

582
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,751
What's being said?

583
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,333
We love our country!

584
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,996
Listen up

585
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,668
Listen up

586
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,420
What's being said?

587
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,041
We love our country!

588
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:37,665
Listen up

589
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,341
Come on in.

590
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,123
Baba Singh, what's the matter?
Tell me.

591
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,123
-Tell him.
-Tell him.

592
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:07,288
Sir, everyone's saying
that you've heard all our stories.

593
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,086
But, you haven't said anything.

594
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,746
You've to tell us today.

595
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,960
How did you get married
to sister-in-law?

596
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,381
Yes, sir! You have to.

597
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,248
After all, how did you get married
to sister-in-law?

598
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,453
Tell us, sir.

599
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,541
Sir, everyone's saying that you fell
in love before you got married...

600
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:23,663
Who says so?

601
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,130
Well, I said it.

602
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,916
Sir, please tell us.

603
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,705
Okay.

604
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,881
It was 17 years ago.

605
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:37,458
We won against Burma in second world war.

606
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,420
I was ecstatic.

607
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,995
As soon as I was granted leave,

608
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:46,091
I took the Delhi-Lahore Express
to go to my village.

609
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:57,083
I wanted to share my joy
of our victory with father.

610
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,880
But the train journey seemed never ending.

611
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,001
Sister, come fast.

612
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:18,591
Is there anyone here
who can help this old lady?

613
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,628
My luggage is quite heavy.

614
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,623
I got it, ma'am.

615
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,460
Thank you, son.

616
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:42,086
Bless you, child.

617
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,788
May the Lord bless you
with good health.

618
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,083
Live long!

619
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:17,783
The beauty of your eyes

620
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:22,663
Has mesmerized me

621
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:31,960
You have gained

622
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:38,668
A special place in my heart

623
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:45,416
Your simplicity

624
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:51,036
Has created a havoc

625
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:58,376
Has torn up

626
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:06,458
My heart

627
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,090
Your gaze

628
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:19,038
Is incomparable

629
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:26,875
It hits straight

630
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:33,785
To my heart

631
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:37,783
Your love has

632
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:42,748
Such a power

633
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:48,421
That a courageous man

634
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:54,131
Is daunted

635
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,788
In front of you

636
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:16,663
What do our eyes

637
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,459
Tell each other?

638
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:23,588
What do our eyes

639
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:26,206
Tell each other

640
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:30,373
I have lost my sleep

641
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:33,747
Because of your love

642
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:40,291
What do our eyes

643
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,841
Tell each other

644
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,590
What do our eyes

645
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,956
Tell each other

646
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,711
What do our eyes,

647
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,208
Tell each other

648
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:14,996
What do our eyes,

649
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,785
Tell each other

650
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:20,495
What's the matter, Brother?
Why are you staring at the train?

651
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,743
Have you left something behind?

652
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,171
I think it's a bottle of imported alcohol.

653
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,163
No, Bachattar.

654
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,840
Let's go home.
I haven't left anything behind.

655
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:52,458
What do our eyes

656
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,413
Tell each other

657
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,283
I have lost my sleep

658
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,496
Because of your love

659
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:09,583
What do our eyes

660
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,748
Tell each other

661
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,840
Bachattar, what's with Joginder?

662
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:20,751
Where are you lost, soldier?
You've reached home.

663
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,790
Don't shoot. That's your father
standing in front of you.

664
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,381
Son.

665
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:33,708
Son.

666
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,918
-Mother!
-Come.

667
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,662
-Father.
-May God bless you.

668
00:54:41,416 --> 00:54:42,336
Mother.

669
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,498
I'll sacrifice my life for my dear.

670
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,376
Sister, why are you crying?

671
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:50,418
Joginder Singh has made
our village so proud.

672
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,540
Come on in.

673
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,456
Come, now.

674
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,625
Virender Singh, this last one
is for you.

675
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,250
-Mother, see how lovely this is.
-It's so beautiful.

676
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:00,995
What's the matter with you, Prito?

677
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:05,418
You didn't get anything for the
three of us?

678
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:08,749
We're not going to wear old rags
for the festival.

679
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:13,953
We are really upset with you.
Don't talk to us!

680
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,590
Don't worry. Next time I'll bring you
two sets of clothes each.

681
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,668
-Is that fine?
-That's a good idea.

682
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:23,881
Everyone's got something,
but nothing for us!

683
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,838
-Give them...
-I got...

684
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,953
Hey, whose clothes are
these in my bag?

685
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,880
Girls, look.

686
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,162
Are they yours?

687
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,536
Give it, Brother.

688
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,588
Okay. Wait!

689
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,033
This is for Prito.

690
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:44,746
This one's for Phino.

691
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,666
And this, for Bhajno.

692
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,500
Why did you trouble us?

693
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:49,833
Such a pretty dress.

694
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,786
Isn't it?
Come, give me a hug.

695
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,833
-Go and play.
-Let's go.

696
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,961
You always find happiness in others' joy.

697
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,786
Mom, you and dad have always taught me

698
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:14,916
a true Sikh is one
who makes others happy.

699
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,920
I wish you eternal success, my son.

700
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,833
What do our eyes

701
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,786
Tell each other

702
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:52,746
What do our eyes

703
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,583
Tell each other

704
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,495
I have lost my sleep

705
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,953
Because of your love

706
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:12,412
Come on, everyone get on.
Put this bundle away, will you?

707
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,540
Mother, please apply Kohl in my eyes.

708
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:18,498
Wait a minute.
Give it to me.

709
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,243
Take it.

710
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,959
-It's done.
-Okay.

711
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,750
Mom, why don't dad and you
come along with us to the fair?

712
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,956
What will we do there?

713
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:33,501
All of you can and enjoy
yourselves to the fullest.

714
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,583
Okay, Dad.

715
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,166
I'll leave then, Mom.

716
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,920
Wait! Let me put a black dot on you, too.

717
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,380
The whole village is singing praises
of your bravery.

718
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,210
Let no evil eye be cast upon Joginder.

719
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,460
Mother, put a black dot on me, too.

720
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:50,921
I'm no less handsome.

721
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,335
Here you go.

722
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,995
-What do you think?
-See you, Mom!

723
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,873
Bless you.

724
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,670
See you, Dad!

725
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:32,163
Brother, can I go for that big ride?

726
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:36,041
Yes. Go with her.

727
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:47,998
That feeling of love,
Has finally blossomed.

728
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:52,708
Like those colorful dreams

729
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:59,748
I see only a red shirt

730
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:04,417
You are in pink colored clothes

731
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:11,083
My foolish heart has fallen in love

732
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:18,126
Your beauty

733
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,248
Has left me sleepless

734
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,960
Your beauty

735
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:27,501
Has left me sleepless

736
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,036
Your beauty

737
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:34,745
Has left me sleepless

738
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:40,955
That feeling of love,
Has finally blossomed

739
01:00:56,708 --> 01:01:00,288
I've forgotten the world,

740
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:03,374
Left only singing your praise

741
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:11,208
Your beauty has slain me,
Leaving no remains

742
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:16,841
Your stunning youth,

743
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:20,536
Has permeated my core

744
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:25,288
Your beauty

745
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,995
Has left me sleepless

746
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,415
Your beauty

747
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,920
Has left me sleepless

748
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:42,336
That feeling of love,
Has finally blossomed

749
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:53,243
After all, every path

750
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,833
Leads to you

751
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:01,743
Your love is my

752
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:05,243
Night sentinel

753
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:10,341
Your love is like a pearl

754
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:13,665
in the string of my life

755
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,290
Your beauty

756
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:29,455
Has left me sleepless

757
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,375
Your beauty

758
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,998
Has left me sleepless

759
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:42,243
That feeling of love,
Has finally blossomed

760
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,381
What happened?
Where were you?

761
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,210
Let's go.

762
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,536
It's the harvest month.

763
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,338
We won't be able to organize a wedding.

764
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:19,376
It's a busy season and
we won't be able to call everyone.

765
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:23,033
No! Joginder has come for leave.

766
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:25,288
We have to get him married
before he goes back.

767
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,625
She is right.

768
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,373
It is better to get them married now.

769
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,418
Can I get my cannon for you
the next time?

770
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,453
Joginder's here.

771
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,333
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

772
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,626
Don't just greet him.
Take his blessings.

773
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,091
He's your father-in-law.

774
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:42,458
We've fixed your alliance
with his daughter, Gurdayal.

775
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:53,335
Uncle's words splintered my heart.

776
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,203
Come on! Go!

777
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,340
Hands up!

778
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,588
Stop! Stop!

779
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:48,663
Bahadur Singh.

780
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:58,453
If you dare to cross the border again

781
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:03,538
Subedar Joginder Singh won't let you
leave the Indian soil alive.

782
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,668
I'm forgiving you considering
this your last mistake.

783
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:12,290
But, remember, we have Punjabi blood
running in our veins.

784
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:17,535
When it's a matter of our nation,
we don't wait for orders.

785
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,710
We'll blow your heads off!

786
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,211
Get going.

787
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:31,166
Move it!

788
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,375
The enemy is constantly
crossing the border

789
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:48,378
and attacking Joginder Singh's
post number 11.

790
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:52,165
They might even be taking position
near the Mc Mahon Line,

791
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,250
and strengthening their forces.

792
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,841
Haripal Kaushik.

793
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:04,041
We have to immediately gauge
the enemy's position and powers

794
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,920
Sir, as we had requested earlier,

795
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:10,786
this job can only be done
by patrolling enemy territory.

796
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:12,916
Sir, I request you...

797
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:18,461
I'll speak to the headquarters
about patrolling.

798
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,631
But we've to be careful about one thing.

799
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,373
Until we receive orders,

800
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,288
there must be no enemy casualty.

801
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:31,243
Sir, do we wait for the enemies
to shoot us?

802
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,204
I understand your situation very well.

803
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,090
But until we get orders
from the government to open fire,

804
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,083
you'll have to bear with it.

805
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,840
Everything alright, Santokh Singh?

806
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,461
Until I don't get the orders
to blow the heads of the enemy,

807
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,625
nothing's going to be alright, sir.

808
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,208
I respect your spirit,
Santokh Singh.

809
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,703
But, my hands are tied.

810
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,535
As soon as I receive orders
to open fire at the enemy,

811
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:22,125
I swear by the Lord,

812
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:28,128
Joginder Singh's unit will
decimate the enemy.

813
01:08:36,541 --> 01:08:40,880
Truth, in the name of Lord.
Lord, our true king.

814
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:44,036
Keep your blessings with us, Lord.

815
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,283
You wretched Chinese!

816
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,881
Come out!

817
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:23,500
It's because of you...
It's because of you, I don't get leave.

818
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,283
He keeps saying the same thing!

819
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,961
"Fight these Chinese first.

820
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,631
Then, you can meet your bride."

821
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,208
Enough, now!

822
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:36,748
If the Chinese hear your rant, their
first bullet will be shot on my head.

823
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,083
Nothing will happen to you.

824
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,250
-You hear me?
-I think he'll get us killed.

825
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:43,453
-Get out!
-Lord, keep us safe.

826
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,500
You don't even know what it's like
to bring your wife home!

827
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:49,998
Are you so shameless?

828
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,496
You rascals, come out.

829
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:54,538
Sir, Ajaib Singh.

830
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,743
Shall I call him?

831
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,163
Bahadur Singh.

832
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,380
-Sir?
-Bring him.

833
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:01,418
Yes, sir.

834
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:05,086
What do you know
of our wedding customs?

835
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:07,786
You burst all the fireworks
even before Diwali.

836
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,995
Please fight with us!

837
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:12,083
I, Ajaib Singh is waiting for you!
Come out!

838
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:13,786
Get him down.

839
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:15,745
-Ajaib Singh...
-Yes.

840
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,283
This has become
an everyday thing now.

841
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,420
Sir has been hearing all this
for an hour now.

842
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,630
He has called for you.

843
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,250
You are going to do
some more rounds of punishment.

844
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,125
I'm in trouble now because of you!

845
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,748
Come on.

846
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:28,746
What did he say?
Am I going to get punished?

847
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,460
Sir, please punish him.

848
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,500
Ajaib Singh, how many times do
I have to explain to you?

849
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,375
I can't grant you leave under these
circumstances.

850
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:42,588
Look me in the eye
and speak, Ajaib Singh.

851
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:45,878
Sir, everyone makes fun of me.

852
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,538
No one knows how I feel.

853
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,248
I'm waiting for the Chinese here,

854
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,663
and my new bride
is waiting for me at home.

855
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,203
I'm stuck, sir.

856
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,413
But, forget that, sir.

857
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,035
No one can understand my feelings.

858
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,285
Shall we plaster your heart
with cement?

859
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,285
Baba Singh!

860
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,036
Ajaib Singh, don't worry.

861
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:03,996
I understand your pain very well.

862
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,083
Don't you know, the same thing
happened to sir.

863
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,163
He was in love with someone,

864
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,170
but his father forced him
to marry someone else.

865
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,880
Baba Singh, don't talk nonsense.

866
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:12,958
Take your positions.

867
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,961
For us, your story's still a mystery.

868
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,286
Why don't you tell us
what happened finally?

869
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,285
Bahadur Singh!

870
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:22,786
Please tell your story, sir.

871
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:26,203
It's possible that listening to your story
might make me feel better.

872
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,745
It's nothing about a girl, Uncle.

873
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,001
Buddy...

874
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:47,785
What happened?

875
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,125
-Sit.
-What happened?

876
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,128
Don't pull out my arm.

877
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,210
My life's at stake and you're worried
about your arm.

878
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:56,421
Promise me that
you won't tell anyone.

879
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,380
I won't tell anyone.

880
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,373
We're in a big dilemma.

881
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,170
You are a very sly man.

882
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:10,920
Oh my God, Sister!

883
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,588
You've brought disgrace to father.

884
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,290
Don't scare me.

885
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,630
What should I do?

886
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:17,958
There's nothing we can do.

887
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,960
You'll get married tomorrow.

888
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,958
And in a year, you'll have a son.

889
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:24,041
A son? How can that happen?

890
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
I won't marry. That's it!

891
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:30,125
Your father will thrash you
with his shoes.

892
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:32,998
Just keep mum! There isn't much
that you've to forget about him.

893
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,538
You don't even know his name.

894
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,496
-Nipa!
-Coming, Aunt.

895
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,375
-Come fast.
-You'll land me in trouble, too.

896
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,998
It would be worth trying
if you knew anything about her.

897
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,283
You don't even know
where she's from.

898
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:44,285
Why are you getting so worked up?

899
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:45,745
Wasting my time!

900
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,790
Bachattar, aren't you my friend?

901
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:49,791
Don't just invite your friend.

902
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,993
I've bought new clothes
for your wedding reception, too.

903
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,130
Don't forget me.

904
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,623
I'll take you for the wedding, too.

905
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,628
I'll even take you for war.

906
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,090
What do we do?

907
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,590
Nothing. I didn't hear a thing.

908
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,131
Quick. Quick.

909
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:30,783
Greetings, everyone.

910
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,838
Greetings.

911
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:35,876
Come on, young man.
Take his blessings.

912
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:38,783
Come on. Go and meet them.

913
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:41,088
Bless you.

914
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:43,536
Be happy.

915
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:48,631
Here, some sweets.

916
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:53,285
-Hope everything is alright.
-Thank you.

917
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,591
All the guests are eating.

918
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:02,033
And my to be brother-in-law
is sitting hungry.

919
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:05,786
I've made these flatbread myself.

920
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,340
I'm not hungry.

921
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:13,038
Oh, your love for our sister
has already killed your hunger.

922
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:17,171
Save some love
for the sisters-in-law, too.

923
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,250
I would love to eat
what you've cooked,

924
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:22,626
but I feel you're up to some mischief.

925
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,210
Who's even talking to you?

926
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:28,412
Who's feeding you?

927
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:32,500
No matter who eats
it's the same thing.

928
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:36,873
There is no comparison between you
and our brother-in-law.

929
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:38,955
You look like you are always hungry.

930
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,421
Feeding the hungry is a noble task.

931
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,040
Is it?

932
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,501
Fine. Here you go, then.

933
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:48,085
Let's have it.
She has given it with love.

934
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,745
Eat it.

935
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,452
Isn't it delicious?

936
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:09,958
Your sisters-in-law are no less.

937
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:11,791
Watch out for them
over the next three days!

938
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,203
Since the day I've fixed her wedding,

939
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:18,246
Gurdayal seems to be very sad.

940
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:21,286
Well, you've found a lovely match for her.

941
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:23,591
He serves the British army.

942
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,040
Gets a good salary, too.

943
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,841
Mom.

944
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,168
Why don't you tell her all this?

945
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,415
Her sadness will vanish.

946
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,379
No way. Who tells a girl
these things?

947
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,130
She doesn't need to know about
the boy and his work details.

948
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,041
Look at this, how pretty it is.

949
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,421
Here, eat something.

950
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,336
Come on girls, go to sleep.

951
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,626
Enough dancing.
You have to wake up early tomorrow.

952
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:52,785
You have to be up early.

953
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,375
See?

954
01:16:03,499 --> 01:16:07,289
Brother, it's not something
that you've lost just once.

955
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:09,038
You've lost it twice.

956
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,670
Once in the train and then at the fair.

957
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,285
That girl's not for you.

958
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,913
This is the girl in your destiny.

959
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:19,590
However she is,
I'm sure she'll be just fine.

960
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,085
Can't you keep this to yourself?

961
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,341
What could I do?

962
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:25,665
I thought you'd run away.

963
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,706
Brother, please don't even think
of running away.

964
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,630
Father's dignity is at stake.

965
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,628
Look at those girls near the well.

966
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,665
Is it appropriate for me
to checkout the girls?

967
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:49,205
If someone sees us,
all the guests will get beaten up.

968
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,993
How will dad explain as to how
everyone got beaten up?

969
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,291
Have an answer to that?

970
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:58,876
Look at that girl in the turquoise scarf.

971
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,338
She's so pretty.

972
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:02,838
Like the moon.

973
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:07,088
Her teeth shine like pearls.

974
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,416
Her eyes are like a doe's.

975
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,671
Her cheeks, red as tomatoes.

976
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:16,630
Isn't it?

977
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:19,168
Don't stare at Joginder's sister-in-law.

978
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,205
I think the truth is something else.

979
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,703
Brother, it's not what you think.
I was just...

980
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:26,041
I was just trying to prove to Joginder

981
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,915
that if the younger sister
is so beautiful,

982
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:29,286
imagine how gorgeous
the older one will be.

983
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,035
You're younger than me.
So, behave well.

984
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,210
Don't try to teach me.

985
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:40,088
She always brightens up
a wedding home.

986
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:45,495
What happened to you, dear?

987
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,631
Go, give this to your aunt.

988
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:59,663
Instead of helping me out,
you've spread the news across the village.

989
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:01,841
I haven't told anything to anyone.

990
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Besides, he's your brother.

991
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,743
-He is younger than me.
-When did I say he's elder?

992
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:08,123
These matters are discussed with
the elders, not the young ones.

993
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,670
But, how will you know that?
Bloody fool.

994
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,250
I feel like punishing you
and have you court marshaled.

995
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,665
I'm sorry. I was only trying
to save your family honor.

996
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,670
Rubbish! Such indiscipline.

997
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,283
You need to follow some rules.

998
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:22,001
Listen, Bachattar.

999
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,710
It's wrong to peep into someone's house.

1000
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,251
Joginder, look.
What a heavenly sight!

1001
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:30,336
-Don't be crazy.
-Come here.

1002
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:34,286
Oh, no. Save us!
Trouble is here.

1003
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:42,165
Are you slyly seeing my sister?

1004
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,086
I don't know about your village,

1005
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:49,243
but here, peeping is considered
an offense.

1006
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,250
What are you saying?
I was just...

1007
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,703
Bachattar is calling me.
Yes, Bachattar, I'm coming...

1008
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,957
Brother-in-law, remember one thing.

1009
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,455
People out here come to know everything.

1010
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,624
Don't just keep staring at it.
Brother-in-law, find the gold.

1011
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,583
Or will you first sing us a song?

1012
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:46,836
Look at these girls troubling the groom.

1013
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,378
Let him be.

1014
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:52,380
Let the girls spend time
with their brother-in-law.

1015
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,583
They won't get such a chance again.

1016
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,588
Is the day starting or getting over?

1017
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,953
Get ready to see your daughter off.

1018
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,413
Come on. Get up.

1019
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:02,666
We won't spare brother-in-law.

1020
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,745
Not until he finds the gold
from this vessel.

1021
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,958
Brother-in-law, can I talk to you?

1022
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,340
Tell me.

1023
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,583
Not in front of these idiots.

1024
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,783
Can we talk over there?

1025
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,878
Go ahead.

1026
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:35,243
Now that you are married to my sister,
we've formed a relationship for life.

1027
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:41,210
In spite of my family forbidding me,
I can't hide the truth from you.

1028
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:43,533
What is it?

1029
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,630
Promise me first that you will say
nothing to my sister.

1030
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,283
I won't.

1031
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,958
My sister doesn't look like me at all.

1032
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:59,413
Actually, she doesn't look
like anyone in the family.

1033
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:03,203
Her complexion is quite dark.

1034
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,875
She also has buckteeth.

1035
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:12,460
But, honestly, she's very talented...

1036
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,290
Enough.

1037
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,623
Everything has happened by God's will.

1038
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:34,203
Bachattar, this is a beautiful village.

1039
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,458
I feel like coming here
again and again.

1040
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:40,211
Shall I ask your father to get you
married off next week to Bachan Kaur?

1041
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,960
The whole family is afflicted with love!

1042
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:50,123
The younger one wants to follow
the soldier's footsteps.

1043
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:55,915
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations to you, too!

1044
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,588
Come, let's go.

1045
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,381
Brother, let's go.

1046
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,456
My goodness! So beautiful!

1047
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,961
Here, have some sweets.

1048
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,420
Mother, come fast.
Brother is here with his wife.

1049
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:03,588
Sister-in-law, say something.

1050
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:06,377
Our sister-in-law is pretty
but very quiet.

1051
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:08,913
She hasn't said a word since she's come.

1052
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:12,038
I hope sister-in-law's not mute.

1053
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:15,248
Come on, girls, go to sleep.

1054
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,785
Let your sister-in-law rest, too.

1055
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,704
She must be very tired.

1056
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,456
-Brother, listen up.
-What is it?

1057
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,333
Is Joginder with you?

1058
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:31,706
No. What happened?

1059
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:33,083
I can't find him.

1060
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,165
-I think he has flown away.
-What will we do now?

1061
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,873
What do we tell everyone?

1062
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,670
Your father will get humiliated.

1063
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,088
How will I marry Bachan now?

1064
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:43,376
You better forget about getting married.

1065
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:46,998
They'll have to think
about this girl, too.

1066
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,583
I'm sure they will get her married to you.

1067
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,833
Bachattar, I can't live without
Bachan anymore.

1068
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,340
Don't worry, my friend.

1069
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:57,961
If the younger one is fair,
the older one must be peaches and cream.

1070
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,246
If the younger one is doe-eyed,
the older one must be the same.

1071
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,250
If the younger one is fire,
the older one must be a firecracker!

1072
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,163
Please spare me.

1073
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,710
I'll get you my brother's gun.
Just shoot me.

1074
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,283
Joginder.

1075
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:11,538
-It's not required now.
-It is!

1076
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,210
You haven't gone to your room yet?
I'll take you inside.

1077
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,251
Aunt, I...

1078
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,336
Aunt...

1079
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,876
You got saved.

1080
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:19,666
I'll take him.

1081
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,245
Don't waste time talking.

1082
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:27,750
It's time to close the gates.
Go to your room. Don't hesitate.

1083
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:31,953
Latch it from inside.

1084
01:24:56,416 --> 01:25:00,536
My sister doesn't look like me at all.

1085
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:04,165
Actually, she doesn't look
like anyone in the family.

1086
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,878
Her complexion is quite dark.

1087
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:10,420
She also has buckteeth.

1088
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,251
Greetings!

1089
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:26,208
Before leaving, my mother told me

1090
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:29,956
that if I wanted a happy life,

1091
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:34,788
I shouldn't keep any secrets
from my husband.

1092
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:40,090
Now that we are married,

1093
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:43,248
you mean the world to me.

1094
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:49,333
That's why, I wanted to share something
personal with you.

1095
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:54,208
If I don't, it'll be a sin.

1096
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:59,955
A few days ago, I was going by train
to my grandparents' house.

1097
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:07,918
I saw a very handsome man there.

1098
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:14,089
And I felt as though
the Lord had made him for me.

1099
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:15,921
That's the last thing I needed.

1100
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,711
Since then, I've been dreaming

1101
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,540
of a life with him.

1102
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:26,665
Then one day at the fair,

1103
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:31,533
he appeared before me out of nowhere

1104
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,337
in a maroon outfit.

1105
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:36,918
Then he vanished.

1106
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,913
We've never spoken to each other.

1107
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:46,375
If I'm lying,
I'll turn to ashes right away.

1108
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:55,625
Are you saying that you would've been

1109
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,995
happier if you'd married that guy?

1110
01:27:02,874 --> 01:27:08,204
Yes, I'd definitely be happier
if I married him.

1111
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:15,211
But now, it's a sin
to even think about it.

1112
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:21,247
And, what if you meet him again?

1113
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,421
God forbid!

1114
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:27,785
I won't even look at another man now.

1115
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,380
Don't do that.

1116
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:36,495
You never know, your dream man

1117
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and I might turn out
to be the same person.

1118
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,088
Oh God!

1119
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,378
Sir, you're very lucky.

1120
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:05,958
Sir, God has answered your prayers.

1121
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,000
Greetings, sir!

1122
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:14,091
We'll not spare them.

1123
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:20,378
Joginder Singh, your request
has been approved.

1124
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,834
You've got permission for patrolling.

1125
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,500
This operation will have a team of seven.

1126
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:32,743
-Joginder Singh.
-Sir.

1127
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,743
-You'll lead the team.
-Yes, sir.

1128
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:38,745
Remember, this is a
very dangerous operation.

1129
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,338
You won't find a place
to hide during the day.

1130
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,916
Carelessness can cost a life.

1131
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:51,953
It's because we don't know where
exactly the enemy are hiding.

1132
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:53,953
Don't worry, sir.

1133
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:58,091
Joginder Singh very well knows to
dodge the enemy and get the information.

1134
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,291
Please explain the plan.

1135
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:02,291
Sir, we're here.

1136
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,875
This is the Bumla border.

1137
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:06,841
According to the area expert,
this is the best route.

1138
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:09,876
Because it's least risky.

1139
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,245
Sir, there's another route.

1140
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:16,873
It's long enough but the enemy
won't be able to spot you.

1141
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:20,083
This is the route.

1142
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:26,953
Maan Singh, we shouldn't
ignore his input.

1143
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,203
Yes, sir.

1144
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:30,211
-Joginder Singh.
-Sir!

1145
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,663
Sir, they are right
next to the Mc Mahon Line.

1146
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,785
They are three times more than us.

1147
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:21,378
The Sikh regiment doesn't bother about
the number of people while fighting.

1148
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:37,458
Stay alert!

1149
01:32:46,666 --> 01:32:51,036
Sir, the officer at the
opposite post seems very sharp.

1150
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:54,205
We've been informed
that they've just patrolled our area.

1151
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:55,711
How many soldiers are they in total?

1152
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:58,245
Around 25 soldiers.

1153
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:00,996
Pong, we're in thousands.

1154
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:05,243
We can't change our plan
because of one sharp officer.

1155
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:09,333
We have to capture
this post to takeover Tawang.

1156
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:10,416
Okay, sir.

1157
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:13,125
Sir, according to Joginder Singh's report,

1158
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,791
the enemy is preparing
to attack from the Mc Mahon Line.

1159
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,920
I don't trust the enemy's intentions, sir.

1160
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:19,242
In case of an attack,

1161
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:22,953
Joginder Singh's post number 11
will require ammunition.

1162
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:26,251
I request you to immediately
make all the arrangements.

1163
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:27,625
All right.

1164
01:33:28,708 --> 01:33:32,088
I'll submit my report to the headquarters

1165
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,033
and arrange for the ammunition.

1166
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:39,878
Order all your troops to stay alert.

1167
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:40,838
Yes, sir!

1168
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:43,418
-Soldiers.
-Yes, sir!

1169
01:33:43,666 --> 01:33:46,786
Today, none of the trenches
in our area should be empty.

1170
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:49,706
While keeping an eye on the enemy,

1171
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:53,336
every soldier should always
keep a weapon along!

1172
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,246
Everyone should be alert!

1173
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,283
-Any doubts?
-No, sir.

1174
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,130
Bahadur Singh! Bahadur Singh!

1175
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,625
Here's a letter for you.

1176
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:20,665
Isn't it from your father.

1177
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:24,211
Dad's asking me to come
and meet him quickly.

1178
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,840
That's a great news.

1179
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:30,250
The enemy can make a move
any moment. We'll need the ammunition.

1180
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:32,376
Please send it as soon as possible, sir.

1181
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,955
Yes, sir.

1182
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:44,166
Sir, you've never responded
to any of my requests yet.

1183
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:46,288
Every solider has a story to tell.

1184
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,540
But my father has no story.

1185
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:53,630
The whole village taunts my father
by calling him a sentry in the army.

1186
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,840
When I go home to my village,

1187
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:59,786
everyone taunts me
by calling me a "little watchman".

1188
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:04,588
Sir, only you can help me
by sending me on the front lines of war.

1189
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:06,591
-Do you have anything else to say?
-No, sir!

1190
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:09,203
So, you can get back on your duty.

1191
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:10,291
Okay, sir!

1192
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:26,916
Even after giving money which you sent me
to the moneylender

1193
01:35:29,416 --> 01:35:32,496
he is saying that he won't let me
light a lamp at your father's grave

1194
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:37,036
until you sign the documents.

1195
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,960
Come as soon as possible.

1196
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:45,746
We'll go together and light the lamp
at your father's grave.

1197
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,630
Her name is always on your lips.

1198
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:10,958
Thinking of our sister-in-law,

1199
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:14,913
He keeps looking for her
In his heart.

1200
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
He keeps looking for her
In his heart.

1201
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:21,783
If a man doesn't get to have
his nuptial night

1202
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,495
then every day seems like an eternity.

1203
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:24,783
Sit down.

1204
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:26,835
Why are you always simmering
in frustration?

1205
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:28,706
You are always joking.

1206
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:32,378
-We've got a solution for your misery.
-Yes.

1207
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:35,668
How did sir's brother
describe his sister-in-law?

1208
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:39,496
How did he say her face was?

1209
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:40,953
Like a moon.

1210
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:43,287
And, what about her eyes?

1211
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:44,836
Like a doe.

1212
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:46,416
Her cheeks?

1213
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,170
Like tomatoes.

1214
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,420
What did her teeth look like?

1215
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,000
Like pearls!

1216
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,340
Oh, boy!

1217
01:36:53,833 --> 01:36:56,083
Sister-in-law seems to be very pretty.

1218
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:58,586
Oh, wow! She looks beautiful.

1219
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,380
Look properly, Ajaib Singh.

1220
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,338
For now, you'll have to make do
with this photo.

1221
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:05,786
The way things are going on,
I don't think you'll get a leave.

1222
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:07,745
-All well, boys?
-Yes, sir!

1223
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:09,746
-Ajaib Singh!
-Yes, sir?

1224
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,086
Pack your bags.

1225
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,833
Your leave has been sanctioned.

1226
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:28,704
Sir, is my leave actually sanctioned?

1227
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:37,791
With sweets prepared for me

1228
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,749
My pretty wife will be

1229
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,290
Waiting for me.

1230
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,128
Ajaib.

1231
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,090
Please convey my message to my father.

1232
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:52,208
Tell him that his son
looks very handsome in the uniform.

1233
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:53,668
Definitely, Brother.

1234
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:58,743
If you get the time,
please visit my village as well.

1235
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:01,336
Brother, I'll be back real quick.

1236
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,163
I'm only going to see her face.

1237
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,460
Let it be.

1238
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,243
You won't come back so soon.

1239
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:09,245
-We know how it works.
-No way.

1240
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,413
Ajaib, my village is very close
to your village, too.

1241
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:12,880
If you get some time,

1242
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:15,378
please tell my mother that
her son will come home soon.

1243
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:16,835
I'll surely tell her.

1244
01:38:21,333 --> 01:38:23,783
Baba Singh, don't you want
to send any message?

1245
01:38:23,875 --> 01:38:25,495
Your village is close to mine, too.

1246
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:29,783
I'm happy that your leave is sanctioned.

1247
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,340
If you're going to my village

1248
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,536
then, please tell my mother

1249
01:38:37,541 --> 01:38:41,341
that I'll get my younger sister married
when I'm back.

1250
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:43,841
She's not just your sister, but ours too.

1251
01:38:43,916 --> 01:38:45,496
We'll all get her married.

1252
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:48,131
-Won't we?
-Surely, we will.

1253
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:19,453
You haven't slept as yet?

1254
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:20,881
No, sir.

1255
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:22,631
Not feeling sleepy tonight.

1256
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:33,500
The Chinese army has destroyed
the Assam Rifles

1257
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:35,285
and is marching towards your post.

1258
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:48,129
Ajaib Singh, take care of yourself.

1259
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,418
-May the Lord be with you.
-Sir, may the Lord be with you.

1260
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,415
Sir!

1261
01:40:53,541 --> 01:40:55,631
Sir!

1262
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,210
Sir!

1263
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:07,666
Baba!

1264
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:11,381
Baba!

1265
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:12,708
Baba Singh...

1266
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,750
Baba Singh...

1267
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:19,537
Fast! Be quick!

1268
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:20,878
Baba!

1269
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:36,082
Wait.

1270
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:39,291
The enemy's not in our range.

1271
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:43,251
There's a big difference
between their guns and ours.

1272
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:49,786
Don't fire until their heads
are clearly visible.

1273
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:51,165
Okay, sir.

1274
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,250
Ajaib Singh, the bullets are over.
Bring them quickly.

1275
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:19,243
Yes, sir.

1276
01:44:34,208 --> 01:44:36,918
Ajaib Singh, deliver bullets
to section one and section three.

1277
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,250
-Quick.
-Okay, sir.

1278
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:58,961
Take it.

1279
01:45:12,416 --> 01:45:14,206
All our soldiers are getting killed.

1280
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,040
-Don't send them forward.
-Shut up!

1281
01:45:16,416 --> 01:45:20,086
If our soldiers are dying, the enemy's
bullets are also getting over.

1282
01:45:24,207 --> 01:45:25,127
No, sir.

1283
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,840
-Okay, sir.
-Go!

1284
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,590
Come on!

1285
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:38,746
Dammit!

1286
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:42,702
Ajaib!

1287
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:44,455
Get down!

1288
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,878
Come on, Bahadur.
Move!

1289
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:02,285
We did you save me?

1290
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,460
It's because your wife is waiting for you.

1291
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:06,341
Your father's waiting for you too.

1292
01:46:11,375 --> 01:46:14,625
Sir, the machine gun from section one
have stopped firing.

1293
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,040
The enemy's still advancing towards us.

1294
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,455
They're coming here to die.

1295
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,953
Take charge. I'll check.

1296
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:16,921
What's our casualty, Joginder Singh?

1297
01:48:17,124 --> 01:48:18,494
There's been heavy casualty, sir.

1298
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:19,873
What about the enemy?

1299
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:22,038
The enemy's casualty is much more.

1300
01:48:22,499 --> 01:48:24,999
Sir, somehow make arrangements
for the weapons.

1301
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:27,746
As long as there are weapons
at Joginder Singh's post

1302
01:48:27,916 --> 01:48:29,996
I will keep the enemy at bay.

1303
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:32,415
I'll arrange the weapons,
Joginder Singh.

1304
01:48:36,166 --> 01:48:37,836
Hold on to the post.

1305
01:48:38,291 --> 01:48:39,791
Don't let the enemy come forward.

1306
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,920
Yes, sir!

1307
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:59,243
Sir, now that we're at war

1308
01:48:59,375 --> 01:49:02,125
I should also be given a chance
to attack the enemy.

1309
01:49:19,958 --> 01:49:23,668
Come on, let's go.

1310
01:49:25,958 --> 01:49:27,958
-Have some water.
-Come on, go quickly.

1311
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:29,671
Sir...

1312
01:49:32,833 --> 01:49:33,743
Mahinder...

1313
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:39,625
Come on, be quick.

1314
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:42,088
Come on, keep it here.

1315
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:44,456
That's not a problem.

1316
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:46,841
Bahadur Singh, you're injured.

1317
01:49:47,166 --> 01:49:49,126
You should go down
to the base immediately.

1318
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:52,208
Sir, the Lord says that

1319
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:56,501
"He alone is a hero,
who fights the spiritual battle.

1320
01:49:56,666 --> 01:49:59,996
He may be cut apart in pieces, but,
never does he desert the battlefield."

1321
01:50:00,416 --> 01:50:01,876
Sir!

1322
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:09,995
Just stay here.

1323
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,790
Please stay...

1324
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,290
Soldier, not everybody
gets the opportunity

1325
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:26,665
to sacrifice their life for their country.

1326
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:29,168
God has given you
the opportunity to do so.

1327
01:50:29,541 --> 01:50:30,671
Take this.

1328
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:34,703
Deliver this ammunition
to Joginder Singh's post right away.

1329
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:39,290
And fulfill your desire to blow the enemy.

1330
01:50:39,375 --> 01:50:44,625
Sir, with this order, you've fulfilled
my family and my dream.

1331
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:47,248
Soldier, don't waste time.

1332
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:48,332
Yes, sir!

1333
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,670
Sir! Maan Singh has sent
the weapons for you.

1334
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:17,499
Bhaag Singh,
what are you waiting for?

1335
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,243
The enemy is in front of you. Fire!

1336
01:51:20,165 --> 01:51:22,205
Sir, can I shoot too?

1337
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:24,208
Bhaag Singh, fire!

1338
01:51:24,291 --> 01:51:26,791
This is your only chance
to put an end to all the taunts.

1339
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:30,166
Keep the gun on the trench,
aim and fire!

1340
01:51:30,291 --> 01:51:32,961
Remember, one bullet, one enemy!

1341
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,091
Yes, sir!

1342
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:12,211
Bhaag Singh!

1343
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:17,091
Santokh, my family...

1344
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:19,495
will now be proud...

1345
01:52:20,625 --> 01:52:22,085
Bhaag Singh!

1346
01:53:03,541 --> 01:53:06,591
Hey! Come on, get up.

1347
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:14,671
Come on.

1348
01:53:23,666 --> 01:53:24,836
Thank you, buddy.

1349
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:26,791
Swaran Singh

1350
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:29,083
stop being scared.

1351
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,000
You're an Indian soldier.

1352
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:36,333
Cowards die many deaths,
but the brave one only die once.

1353
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:39,663
Be brave.

1354
01:53:45,125 --> 01:53:46,915
Very good, Ajaib Singh.

1355
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:48,996
Well done! You saved Swaran Singh's life.

1356
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:51,998
By the Lord's grace, you are also safe.

1357
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:58,420
Sir! The Lord's will has prevailed.

1358
01:54:00,125 --> 01:54:01,285
What do you mean?

1359
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:16,380
Sir, we'll now meet in the next life.

1360
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:18,128
Ajaib Singh.

1361
01:54:33,833 --> 01:54:37,203
Swaran Singh! Swaran Singh!

1362
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:42,033
Yes, sir!

1363
01:55:49,875 --> 01:55:51,665
Sir, you're hurt.

1364
01:55:51,791 --> 01:55:53,041
Bahadur Singh,
don't worry about me.

1365
01:55:53,125 --> 01:55:54,035
Kill the enemy.

1366
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,995
Sir, if I kill two, four come out.

1367
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:59,376
If I kill ten, 20 come out.

1368
01:55:59,541 --> 01:56:01,211
They're like ants. They don't get over.

1369
01:56:01,708 --> 01:56:05,288
Blow them up with a bomb.
Bring the bombs, Bahadur Singh.

1370
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,840
Bahadur Singh!

1371
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:24,250
Bahadur Singh.

1372
01:57:24,708 --> 01:57:25,708
Bahadur Singh.

1373
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,590
Bahadur.

1374
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:30,460
Bahadur.

1375
01:57:31,166 --> 01:57:33,166
Bahadur. Bahadur.

1376
01:57:33,625 --> 01:57:34,955
Bahadur.

1377
01:57:35,125 --> 01:57:37,625
My father...

1378
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:14,836
All troops are ordered to retreat from
their posts and return to headquarters.

1379
01:58:41,958 --> 01:58:44,208
Sir, only five soldiers are left.

1380
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:46,123
The enemy may return.

1381
01:58:46,416 --> 01:58:47,836
Please send the weapons
as soon as possible.

1382
01:58:47,958 --> 01:58:48,788
Joginder Singh,

1383
01:58:49,458 --> 01:58:54,458
the enemy has deceitfully attacked
all our posts at the same time.

1384
01:58:54,625 --> 01:58:56,085
We don't need ammunition anymore.

1385
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:58,836
The headquarters have ordered

1386
01:58:59,541 --> 01:59:01,841
all posts to save their lives and retreat.

1387
01:59:03,166 --> 01:59:06,496
Joginder Singh, I know I've taught you,

1388
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:10,703
when it is about the country's security,

1389
01:59:11,875 --> 01:59:15,335
a soldier never retreats
under any circumstance.

1390
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:19,455
But now, I order you to return

1391
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:23,625
with the surviving soldiers.

1392
01:59:24,208 --> 01:59:26,458
This soil is my mother, sir.

1393
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:29,915
And it now has my brothers' blood.

1394
01:59:30,833 --> 01:59:36,532
I cannot retreat from here
and deceive my friends and my motherland.

1395
01:59:37,291 --> 01:59:39,751
No matter what happens, sir

1396
01:59:40,958 --> 01:59:43,498
Joginder Singh won't retreat
from this post.

1397
01:59:43,583 --> 01:59:45,873
Joginder, don't be stubborn.
Just come back.

1398
01:59:46,041 --> 01:59:47,421
Think about your family.

1399
01:59:47,833 --> 01:59:51,413
Sir, the Lord has entrusted me

1400
01:59:51,916 --> 01:59:55,036
to take care of my countrymen.

1401
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:57,535
If anything happens to me,

1402
01:59:57,833 --> 02:00:01,373
I'm sure my countrymen

1403
02:00:02,333 --> 02:00:07,243
will take good care of my family.

1404
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,163
Joginder, try to understand.

1405
02:00:09,333 --> 02:00:10,373
Come back.

1406
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:13,841
I don't want to lose you at any cost.

1407
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:18,493
Our country needs brave people like you.

1408
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:21,204
I know you love me

1409
02:00:22,458 --> 02:00:25,128
and until now, I've followed
every order of yours.

1410
02:00:25,666 --> 02:00:26,956
But, I'm sorry.

1411
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:28,996
I can't follow this one.

1412
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:33,415
If possible, send more ammunition.

1413
02:00:33,916 --> 02:00:35,536
God will take care.

1414
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,380
Oh Lord...

1415
02:01:10,666 --> 02:01:14,206
please take care of Joginder Singh
and his soldiers.

1416
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:20,995
To destroy the Sikh regiment,

1417
02:01:22,333 --> 02:01:27,033
we have to attack from three directions.

1418
02:01:46,458 --> 02:01:49,788
Son, a mother's debt can be repaid,
for her nurturing.

1419
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:52,585
But the debt to the motherland
can't ever be repaid.

1420
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:57,628
Protect the motherland,
till your last breath.

1421
02:01:57,875 --> 02:01:59,285
Don't falter.

1422
02:02:03,791 --> 02:02:08,171
We are happily going to

1423
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:11,085
Sacrifice our life to you, O mother

1424
02:02:12,208 --> 02:02:15,538
O my country, my every birth

1425
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:18,995
Is to serve you

1426
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:23,953
My motherland is more important to me

1427
02:02:24,041 --> 02:02:26,091
Than my life

1428
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:31,205
I give my blood

1429
02:02:31,333 --> 02:02:34,413
For my motherland

1430
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:39,210
I will shine as a star

1431
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:42,791
from your sky

1432
02:02:43,458 --> 02:02:46,998
O my country, my every birth

1433
02:02:47,125 --> 02:02:50,455
Is to serve you

1434
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:06,670
I did not turn my back and run

1435
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:10,499
tell my mother about it

1436
02:03:10,583 --> 02:03:14,413
I have fulfilled my duty here,

1437
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:18,205
But could not repay your debt

1438
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:22,628
I did not turn my back and run,

1439
02:03:22,708 --> 02:03:25,958
Tell my mother that.

1440
02:03:26,291 --> 02:03:30,131
I have fulfilled my duty here,

1441
02:03:30,208 --> 02:03:34,038
But could not repay your debt

1442
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:39,535
I could not repay your debt,
For nurturing me

1443
02:03:41,833 --> 02:03:46,373
O mother, always be there

1444
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:48,840
To comfort me

1445
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:53,841
I've consigned my blood

1446
02:03:53,958 --> 02:03:56,878
On the soil of my motherland

1447
02:03:57,625 --> 02:04:01,625
I will shine as a star

1448
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:05,208
From your sky

1449
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,340
O my country, my every birth
Is to serve you

1450
02:04:11,416 --> 02:04:15,996
My every birth!

1451
02:05:01,458 --> 02:05:04,878
Sir, we are out of bullets.
We have no ammunition left.

1452
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:08,418
Sir, they are coming closer
and are large in number.

1453
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,880
Sir, it's over.

1454
02:05:25,916 --> 02:05:29,336
I want the Indian Commander alive.

1455
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:32,586
Let me see how long

1456
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:38,381
he can survive before Pong.

1457
02:05:46,083 --> 02:05:47,913
Death's in front of you.

1458
02:05:50,082 --> 02:05:52,162
You should return.

1459
02:05:52,708 --> 02:05:55,168
The headquarters has ordered us
to do so, as well.

1460
02:05:56,166 --> 02:05:57,416
What about you, sir?

1461
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:02,251
I have made my decision, Santokh Singh.

1462
02:06:03,291 --> 02:06:05,341
How will we fight
without ammunition, sir?

1463
02:06:06,458 --> 02:06:09,788
You don't need ammunition to win a war.

1464
02:06:10,083 --> 02:06:11,703
But courage.

1465
02:07:10,666 --> 02:07:15,206
Victory, in the name of the Lord!

1466
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,210
The Lord, the ultimate truth!

1467
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,960
Can someone tell me when my dad
will be back?

1468
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:11,958
He is his father.

1469
02:12:12,125 --> 02:12:13,165
Greetings.

1470
02:12:13,458 --> 02:12:15,878
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1471
02:12:17,875 --> 02:12:20,205
Subedar Joginder Singh...

1472
02:12:21,208 --> 02:12:22,668
achieved martyrdom in enemy captivity

1473
02:12:24,583 --> 02:12:26,873
on the fourth of December.

1474
02:12:34,708 --> 02:12:37,418
Mother, what happened?
Uncle, what happened?

1475
02:12:37,708 --> 02:12:40,208
He bravely fought for and protected

1476
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,290
the country till his last breath.

1477
02:12:47,083 --> 02:12:49,783
The Indian Army and the whole country

1478
02:12:51,166 --> 02:12:52,836
will always be very proud of him,

1479
02:12:55,083 --> 02:12:58,663
for his courage and patriotism.

1480
02:13:01,541 --> 02:13:05,091
Be strong. Be strong.

1481
02:13:11,291 --> 02:13:14,961
-My dear...
-Uncle!

1482
02:13:50,875 --> 02:13:52,585
Surjeet!

1483
02:13:52,833 --> 02:13:53,993
What's happened?

1484
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:59,920
Surjeet!

1485
02:14:02,291 --> 02:14:04,251
Surjeet! Surjeet!

1486
02:14:04,624 --> 02:14:06,704
-What's happened?
-Oh, Lord!

1487
02:14:06,791 --> 02:14:08,291
Surjeet!

1488
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:10,380
What's happened to my daughter?

1489
02:14:10,833 --> 02:14:11,913
Surjeet!

1490
02:14:12,583 --> 02:14:14,243
Surjeet!

1491
02:14:14,333 --> 02:14:16,873
Open your eyes!

1492
02:14:17,125 --> 02:14:19,165
What's happened to my child?

1493
02:14:19,583 --> 02:14:20,953
Surjeet!

1494
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:24,130
What happened to my child?
