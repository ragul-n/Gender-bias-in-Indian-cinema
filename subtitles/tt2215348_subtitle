26
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:29,847
'She's hot!'

27
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:38,260
How are you, beautiful?

28
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:39,956
Want some sugarcane?

29
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,967
Who knows my sugarcane might get lucky.

30
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,776
My mom used to say..

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,580
Kullu, you are destined to kill someone.

32
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,077
Kill.

33
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,487
You fight well.

34
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,689
Well..

35
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,425
l make sure that l do when there is a..

36
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,297
..beautiful girl standing before me.

37
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,301
Whether or not the other person gets hurt..

38
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:20,098
..but the fight should look good.

39
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:24,037
Tell me, why did you beat them?

40
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,680
Beat them?

41
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,467
l thrashed them.

42
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,179
They said my dialogue?
- Which one?

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,649
This one..

44
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,549
Want some sugarcane?

45
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:37,552
Who knows my sugarcane might get lucky.

46
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,562
Hello, brother.

47
00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:46,255
Did you get Pooja?

48
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,357
Pooja isn't going to make pizzas for others.

49
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,994
We will, sir.

50
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,472
Scoundrel, you don't let me go to Punjab even in my dreams.

51
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:57,468
You know what l nice conversation l was having with Pooja.

52
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,374
Sweet nothings.

53
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:00,811
Sweet sugarcanes.

54
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,074
What will you give Pooja, sweet sugarcanes?

55
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,376
Get out of these Bermudas.
Quickly get ready.

56
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,783
We've to go to the pizza shop.

57
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,984
You'll never let me sleep in peace.

58
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,091
Hello.

59
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,291
l didn't introduce myself.

60
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,030
Myself Kullu.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,199
l live in Canada.

62
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:25,836
And my parents feel proud that l'm a successful man.

63
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,634
No, a failure, man.

64
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:29,372
Same thing.

65
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,034
And l..

66
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:34,445
Forget English and speak in Punjabi.

67
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:39,341
l've a big pizza shop

68
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:41,745
l don't have a pizza shop.

69
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:45,149
l work in that pizza shop.

70
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,156
Pizza delivery.

71
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,727
You must be scared.

72
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,428
lt's okay. You can feel scared.

73
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,840
l won't tell anyone that Goli got scared.

74
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,449
Your wife and your children must be scared of you.

75
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,978
l fear only the Almighty.

76
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:53,048
l got to know that you burnt Shamsher's cocaine.

77
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,560
You are saying Got to know as if l've done it secretly.

78
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,054
l burnt it in front of everyone.

79
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:02,457
And if Shamsher doesn't stop selling this poison..

80
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:04,258
..then this is what l will do.

81
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,272
Tell me something, you aren't a saint either.

82
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,670
You too are a gangster.

83
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,404
Why, you being a Punjabi are making another Punjab suffer a loss?

84
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,072
Shamsher considers you as his brother.

85
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,206
A mother holds higher position than a brother.

86
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,381
Punjab is the mother who gave birth to me.

87
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,019
And Canada is the one who nurtured me.

88
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:27,122
And l cannot tolerate if anyone tries to poison my mother.

89
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,720
lf you consider this land as your mother..

90
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,560
..than l'll bury you six feet under it.

91
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,574
You confused me!

92
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,566
Keep your weapons ready, my friend.

93
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,668
My enemies want me dead.

94
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,278
Want me dead.

95
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,143
Keep your weapons ready, my friend.

96
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,121
My enemies want me dead.

97
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,023
Where even fuel doesn't ignite the fire.

98
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,924
We cause a blast without a matchstick.

99
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,760
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

100
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,832
We love to shoot them in the heart.

101
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,732
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

102
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:48,136
We love to shoot them in the heart.

He loves to see beautiful things.

104
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:02,446
He daily awakes up in the afternoons.

105
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,052
He loves to see beautiful things.

106
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,962
He daily awakes up in the afternoons.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,969
When he thinks of having something crisp.

108
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,665
He goes straight for sweet pretzels.

109
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:22,741
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

110
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,504
We love to shoot them in the heart.

111
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:28,603
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

112
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:31,512
We love to shoot them in the heart.

113
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:40,221
We keep the best of arms.

114
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,224
Our bullets take care of everything.

115
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,937
l love being around beautiful things.

116
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,938
l'm always surrounded by girls.

117
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,839
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

118
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,639
We love to shoot them in the heart.

119
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,738
Anyone who messes with us is done for.

120
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,546
We love to shoot them in the heart.

121
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,347
Yes, l've reached. Yes.

122
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:23,792
Hello?

123
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:25,461
Hello?

124
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,164
Anyone home?

125
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,866
Hello? Hello?

126
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:31,605
Hello?

127
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,668
Hello?
Here's your pizza, ma'am.

128
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,080
You're on fire!

129
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,578
Hello? Hello?
 Ms. Cucumber?

130
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:42,955
Strange!

131
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:45,646
l'd heard that youth is blind.

132
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,191
Today, for the first time l can see that it's deaf as well.

133
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,993
There's a purse here.

134
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,096
Can l take the money for the pizza from it?

135
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:53,487
l'll take it.

136
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,167
Who is she?

137
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:57,724
l'll keep it with me.

138
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:02,103
And here's your change.

139
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,564
Thief! What the hell!

140
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,672
Thief! Get up!

141
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:41,087
Thief!
How did you get in?

142
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:42,829
- Why are you calling me a thief?

143
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:44,127
My name is Kullu.

144
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,304
l'm here to deliver these pizzas.

145
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,303
How did you come in?

146
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,844
Couldn't you ring the doorbell?

147
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,285
l did. 10 times.

148
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:51,981
Do you want me to hit them with the bell?

149
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,117
They don't open the door!

150
00:11:53,143 --> 00:11:54,209
- Give me my purse back.

151
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,059
l didn't steal from you.

152
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,922
l just took some money for the pizza.

153
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,372
Here's 10 dollars for you.

154
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:04,125
A discount for you.

155
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,203
Why? Have the prices of pizza slashed?

156
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,408
For the first time, l've seen such a beautiful girl, in a towel.

157
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,303
l enjoyed it. -
 You..

158
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,316
You! Security!
Someone catch him!

159
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,848
Oh my God!

160
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,614
You only have three kinds of pizza?

161
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,844
That's it?

162
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:26,547
Yes.

163
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,560
She looks like she won't be able to have a single piece.

164
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,656
What? - Nothing.

165
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,355
l want a vegetarian pizza. - Okay.

166
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,792
Wait. Wait.

167
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,359
Now what?

168
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:42,408
Please don't put onions, tomatoes, potatoes..

169
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,069
..capsicum and cottage cheese in it.

170
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,873
What do you want me to put on a in
a vegetarian pizza if not vegetables?

171
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,571
You want me to put my kidney in it?
- Kidney?

172
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,579
Your pizza.

173
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:56,484
How many pieces do l make of it?

174
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,088
l don't want to slice you.
The pizza.

175
00:12:58,491 --> 00:12:59,480
Eight?

176
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,889
Eight pieces?!

177
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:02,534
Have l lost my mind?

178
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,714
l'm on a diet.

179
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:04,990
l won't be able to eat eight pieces.

180
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,097
Give me four pieces.

181
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:08,238
Don't go for four either.

182
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,315
Let me divide it into two.

183
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,233
Two? - l say don't even go for two.

184
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,401
As you are so health conscious, take it as a whole.

185
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,727
You can fold and eat it.

186
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,227
- Yes. Single will be fine.

187
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:18,198
Your pizza.

188
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,800
Thank you. - Thank you.

189
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,847
Hello. - Hi.

190
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:03,021
Happy!

191
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,214
Hello!

192
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:09,086
Listen.. Today where l went to deliver pizzas..

193
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:10,287
..l saw a girl in a towel.

194
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,144
She was so hot!

195
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,616
l was bowled over, brother.

196
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:13,600
What should l tell you!

197
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,918
Why aren't you saying anything?

198
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:15,867
What's wrong with you?

199
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:16,654
- Do you know who came here today?

200
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:17,999
Who? - Kammo.

201
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:22,303
Who Kammo?
- Kammo. My childhood love.

202
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:24,731
One-sided or mutual?

203
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,335
For everyone else it's mutual but you can consider it to be one-sided.

204
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,246
l found her to be so beautiful that..

205
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,339
..sometimes l used to go to school even on a holiday.

206
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,940
Did you take her number?
- What number?

207
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,885
She didn't even look at me.
She just left.

208
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,453
Why didn't you speak to her in school?

209
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,371
How could l?

210
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,981
Once a boy said something about her..

211
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,161
..and l thrashed him and because of that l got rusticated.

212
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:45,356
And Kammo..
- Kammo doesn't even know..

213
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,159
..that you couldn't sit for your exams because of her.

214
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,763
Yes. How do you know that?

215
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,769
This is the story of all the boys of Punjab.

216
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,461
The number of hearts that get broken in the world..

217
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:56,368
..is equal to number of hearts that get broken in Punjab, my dear.

218
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,775
Perhaps that's why sad songs are such a hit in Punjab.

219
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,975
What will happen of my beautiful Punjab?

220
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,981
Brother Shamsher, Goli once again burnt our consignment.
- Lift it.

221
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:12,480
Goli is being a pain in the ass.

222
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,780
Call him. - Yes.

223
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,390
Here you go, brother.

224
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,735
Goli, everyone has to die one day.

225
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,029
Why are you in such a hurry to die?

226
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,131
Everyone has to die one day, Shamsher.

227
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,339
Why are you so scared of dying?

228
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,742
Scared? l am scared.

229
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,843
l'm surrounded by my men.

230
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,646
Asshole, you don't have anyone.

231
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,550
You roam around like an orphan there.

232
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,555
You are talking to me! Shamsher Singh!

233
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,058
Dogs bother about who is in front of them and behind them.

234
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,652
Not lions.

235
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,059
Even a dog acts like a lion when he's in his territory.

236
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:56,164
But in spite of being in your territory you are a dog, Sheru!

237
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:57,257
Don't abuse me.

238
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,394
Hey, Simran.
- l've an old habit.

239
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,476
Hey! Hello!

240
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:15,283
Will you hang up now or should l shoot you?

241
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:17,287
Excuse me?

242
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,126
Thank you.

243
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:31,965
l wonder why such cheap people come to such a place.

244
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,231
What's wrong with her?

245
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,831
l don't know.
She heard you and left.

246
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:37,993
ls she a regular? - No.

247
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,663
l'm seeing her for the first time.

248
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,736
She looks like she belongs to a nice family.

249
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,660
Go away!

250
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,844
Why aren't they calling the cops?

251
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,148
Because he is an undercover cop.
- Huh?

252
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,384
An undercover police officer.

253
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,473
- How do you know that?

254
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,983
l've heard many say that he's over and above the cops.

255
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:58,545
Oh really?

256
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:14,861
Thank you.

257
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:17,373
Go and dance with the ofays.

258
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,667
l don't want everyone to get thrashed by you.

259
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,914
You should trust your own more than outsiders.

260
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,011
And a girl like you shouldn't be at a place like this.

261
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,210
Why?

262
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:34,120
Just because this place is filled with goons l should sit at home?

263
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,726
Such scoundrels shouldn't be at such a place.

264
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,363
You agreed so quickly.

265
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,527
l thought we'll have an argument.

266
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,931
l don't argue over something that is right.

267
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,969
'l've been smiling since so long.'

268
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:49,538
'lf he had been some other boy he would've asked..'

269
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,336
'..for my hand in marriage by now..'

270
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,140
'..and he can't even ask for my number.'

271
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,438
By the way, five kinds of taxes are deducted from my salary.

272
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,981
Do you want a tax refund?

273
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:03,044
No. lt is your responsibility to save me.

274
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,653
What if l need help again?

275
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,551
Call 911.

276
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,793
911. You just gave me a lecture on..

277
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,391
..how to trust my own more than outsiders.

278
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:18,866
But when you had to give a phone number, you gave me 911.

279
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:29,608
Non-stop pizza.

280
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:31,976
Okay, two veggie pizzas.

281
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,074
- Two veggie pizzas.

282
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,228
Two chicken pizzas.

283
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:36,474
- Two chicken pizzas.

284
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,317
Pepperoni. Pepperoni.

285
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:39,414
Yes. Two pepperoni pizzas.

286
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,782
Do you have any other kind of pizza?

287
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:42,722
- Yes, we do.

288
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:44,422
Chili cottage cheese pizza.
- Yes, yes, yes.

289
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,965
Two cottage cheese pizzas.

290
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:46,852
- Sure, ma'am.

291
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,229
Okay, do you guarantee that the pizza will be delivered in 45 minutes?

292
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,434
Ma'am, it's free if you don't get it in 45 minutes.

293
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes. - Okay. Very good.

294
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,337
45 minutes.

295
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,739
Yes? - What's the bill amount?

296
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,539
120 dollars, ma'am.

297
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:01,940
120 dollars.

298
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:08,045
Okay, the tall, handsome, Punjabi boy..

299
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,782
Madam, l'm a tall, handsome, Punjabi boy.

300
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,451
But l think you are talking about Kullu.

301
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,461
Yes, yes, yes.
Kullu. Kullu.

302
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,654
Send him.

303
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,061
Sure, madam.
Sure. Okay, madam. Take care.

304
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,757
Yes! - Yes!

305
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:25,564
My love!
 - Kullu, there's an order for you.

306
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,400
The crow..

307
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:30,268
There's an order for me?

308
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:32,174
You don't want to go hence you are sending me.

309
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:33,613
Fine. l'll deliver it.

310
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:35,703
Some girl specially ordered you.

311
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:36,770
l mean the pizza.

312
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,882
Special? - Yes.

313
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:40,006
Me? - Yes.

314
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,107
Address?

315
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,087
Hey, it's that girl in a towel.

316
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,290
l think she likes your brother.

317
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:53,592
l think what we've heard about delivery boys is true.
- Yes.

318
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,393
This means we will get a nice tip.

319
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:56,728
You'll get a nice tip!

320
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:58,527
That's such a cheap thing to say.

321
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:03,003
Think of what else l'll get other than the tip.

322
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,503
Or get a scooter, Kullu.

323
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,508
Oh no.

324
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,211
lt betrayed me at the time of need.

325
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:17,611
Hey..

326
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,048
..since when did tyres startedgetting punctured like this in Canada?

327
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,875
But you'll have to go there.

328
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:23,678
Get ready.

329
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:42,364
Stop the lift. - Yes.

330
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,208
Oh no!

331
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,499
Ten, nine, eight..

332
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,708
Six, five, four..

333
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:22,106
Three, two, one.

334
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,241
Free pizza!

335
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:28,683
Why free pizza?

336
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:29,947
l should get more than the price for the pizza..

337
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,181
..just because l came here running.

338
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:34,851
Mr. Kullu, l think you forgot the rules of your company.

339
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,086
lf pizza is not delivered in 45 minutes then you get it for free.

340
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:40,462
And you are one minute late.

341
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,463
Look at you girls counting each minute.

342
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,966
When you are talking on the phone..

343
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,559
..you don't even realize how many hours you've spent on it.

344
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,671
At least take into consideration that l came here running.

345
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,273
Why should we care how you came here?

346
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:52,104
lt's not as if we punctured the tyre of your bike.

347
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,879
How do you know that my bike's tyre was punctured?

348
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:01,081
No, no.
We are not so cheap..

349
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:03,814
..that we'll puncture your bike's tyre for some free pizzas.

350
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:05,884
l know. l know you girls.

351
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:09,693
You grab shopkeeper's neck for a few pennies.

352
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,089
l won't forfeit my money.

353
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,595
l'll take the money from you.

354
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:13,720
Do whatever you want to.

355
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:14,914
ls that a threat or an offer?

356
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,722
- What do you mean?

357
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,382
l mean l want my money.

358
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,057
l'll take it from you.

359
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,104
Challenge.

360
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:26,872
Best of luck.

361
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:29,238
Pizzas!

362
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:32,350
How will our pizza shop run if you don't take the money!

363
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,497
Why won't l take the money?

364
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:34,688
She didn't pay.
l was late.

365
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:35,403
What can l do?*

366
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,546
She refused to pay?

367
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,147
Tell me what could have l done?

368
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,553
She didn't pay.

369
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:41,692
Should l have slapped her?

370
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,492
Tell me something.
- Yes?

371
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:47,054
She didn't pay or you didn't ask for it?

372
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,857
Why won't l ask for it?
- Why?

373
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:51,792
Didn't you give her 10 dollars back when she was in a towel?

374
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,007
This time it's 120 dollars.

375
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,591
- What nonsense are you blabbering?

376
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:57,467
l'm already very irritated and you are making me angrier.

377
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,314
Kullu, cool. Cool, brother.

378
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,795
You are getting angry.

379
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,777
l'll make her pay 120 dollars.

380
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:06,614
No girl can fool Kullu.

381
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,178
l've brought her photograph.

382
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:14,882
Look, l'll make a Facebook account and talk dirty with boys.

383
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:16,890
Then l'll see who will want to marry her.

384
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:20,028
Even a witch who looks this beautiful can easily get married.

385
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,690
Get lost.
- You are great.

386
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,967
Hey, l know her.
 l've seen her.

387
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,059
Her? - Yes.

388
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:27,719
Where? - 10 blocks away.

389
00:25:27,745 --> 00:25:29,398
She works at a garment store.

390
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,374
l got an idea.

391
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:36,073
Let's place a canon bomb in her store.

392
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:39,581
Boom! We'll get rid of her for once and for all.

393
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,580
Are you getting me?

394
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:43,654
Who gave you a visa for Canada?

395
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:45,786
l crossed the Mexican border.

396
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,287
She works at the store?
- Yes.

397
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:54,460
lf something gets stolen from the store in her presence..
- Yes?

398
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,967
Who will be blamed for it?
- On her.

399
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,761
Who will have to pay for it? - She.

400
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:03,069
ldea! - Theft!

401
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,105
Now hurry up.

402
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:10,172
Take whatever you get.

403
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:12,777
What are you doing?

404
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,078
Didn't you say we have to take the clothes?

405
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,583
Shut up. l'll get the clothes.

406
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:18,252
You'll just stand guard.

407
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:19,739
So that no one comes or leaves.

408
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,147
Hi.

409
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,193
We have met, right?

410
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,556
We haven't met but we've seen each other a number of times.

411
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,893
l've seen you more than you've seen me.

412
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,901
We were in the same class in Punjab.

413
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,898
You are absolutely, right, Kammo.

414
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,472
You remember my name!

415
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:12,475
Hey, l even remember who named you.
 - What?

416
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:15,073
You look just the same, Kammo.

417
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,456
Do you observe marital fast?

418
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,001
- Only married women observe it.

419
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,945
l just wanted to clear whether you married.

420
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:30,224
l think he's stealing something.
- What?

421
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,019
What do we have to do with that?

422
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,156
God is very powerful.
He will punish him.

423
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,060
He's a Punjabi.

424
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:40,227
People like him give Punjabis like us a bad name.

425
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:42,372
Let's scream.
- lt's not needed.

426
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,868
One, two.. - lt's not needed.

427
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:45,632
Three.

428
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,769
Thief! Thief! Thief!

429
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,143
Why don't you scream?

430
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:50,422
Thief! Thief!

431
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:50,929
Thief!

432
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:52,796
- Thief! Thief! Thief!

433
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:53,943
Thief! Thief! Thief!

434
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,633
Let's go. Listen to me.

435
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:57,203
- Thief! Thief! Thief!

436
00:27:58,857 --> 00:27:59,653
Surprise!

437
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,680
You!

438
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:03,859
Okay, so now you've stooped so low..

439
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,864
..that you are stealing to seek revenge.

440
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:09,900
Who is stealing? l was just..

441
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:11,558
Open yourjacket.

442
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,303
l.. ln front of everyone..

443
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:17,668
Shut up.
Will you open your jacket or should l call the security?

444
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:20,768
l have a contagious disease.
lt will spread.

445
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:24,454
l've bought them.

446
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,839
l've bought them all.

447
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,347
This one too? For yourself?

448
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,011
Happy stays with me.

449
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:32,572
He sometimes likes to wear them.

450
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:33,622
lt's his habit.

451
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:34,792
Okay. Why should l bother?

452
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:36,048
Everyone has his own choice.

453
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,678
Nice color. Pink.

454
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:40,483
- Pink is Happy's favorite color.

455
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:41,929
Yes, it's my favorite as well.

456
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:43,276
You've shopped a lot.

457
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:44,959
So let's bill these. Okay?

458
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,267
The counter is not there.
lt's over there.

459
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:48,930
Come on, pay the bill.

460
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,145
Will you be paying in cash or card?

461
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:58,183
Which card? Visiting card?

462
00:28:58,209 --> 00:28:59,906
Wedding card? Which card?

463
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,143
Credit card.

464
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:05,348
Your bill, 320 dollars only.

465
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:08,048
320 dollars? - Yes.

466
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,357
They didn't so expensive when l picked them up.

467
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,554
Here you go.

468
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,795
What else can one do when one is in trouble?

469
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,393
Here's a discount of 10 dollars.

470
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,902
You see, this is the first time l'm seeing a boy buying girl's clothes.

471
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:21,961
Oh really?

472
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,239
Do pay our luxury basement a visit someday.

473
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:26,542
l'll wear them for you.
- Shut up.

474
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,938
Buy yourself a knick with these 10 dollars.

475
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:33,140
You see, rum erases all the pain.
- Oh really?

476
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:35,210
Bloody idiot.

477
00:29:58,543 --> 00:30:01,239
Don't think, just call him.

478
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,471
l, too, want to call him, Jyot.

479
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:07,579
But l don't know, perhaps he'll get angry if l call him.

480
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:09,251
Why will he get angry?

481
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,684
He is a cop.
He can be on duty.

482
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:16,489
What if my phone call disturbs him?

lt gives me a gangster feeling.

525
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:41,482
But now l feel you'll have to disturb him.

526
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:46,416
How can you be a girl and not disturb him at work?

527
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:50,793
Actually, everything's possible for Preet.

528
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:01,001
Hello, Goli.
- Yes, Preet?

529
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:05,636
The night club where we met, there's a flower shop outside it.

530
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:06,835
Enchanted.

531
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,435
That flower shop belongs to me.

532
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:12,147
Three boys are standing outside that flower shop since morning.

533
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,547
They keep on staring at me.

534
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:18,450
l know that l'm pretty and all but come on, give me a break, guys.

535
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:21,821
Anyway, l showed them my sandal from Jalhandar..

536
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:23,685
..but they aren't leaving.

537
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:29,465
Goli, a gun. Goli, he has a gun.

538
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:36,997
l confused him!

539
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:49,775
Preet!

540
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,680
Hey, you really came.

541
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:56,387
Yeah. Where are those boys?
 - Who?

542
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,428
Oh, the ones l told you about.
- Yes.

543
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,123
They ran away.

544
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:05,300
l told them to sit and have some tea and stare at me..

545
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:10,706
..till the lnspector Goli comes, but they ran away.

546
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,243
You seem to be very popular with the goons.

547
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,539
l left my work and came here, Preet.

548
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:21,048
l, too, can leave everything for you.

549
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,751
l wanted to meet you.

550
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,090
lf l would've called you out for coffee, would you have come?

551
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,068
Will you come out with me for a cup of coffee?

552
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:51,174
No matter how big a traitor your friend is, you should never hit him.

553
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,577
Kullu. My brother.

554
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,211
Bloody traitor!

555
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,879
You left your friend alone at the store.

556
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,370
What was wrong with you?

557
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:01,006
- l was helpless, brother.

558
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:04,084
Helpless!
Were your children kidnapped?

559
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:05,102
l'm telling you.

560
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:06,695
l'd to scream because of Kammo.

561
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:08,995
Who Kammo?
You always keep talking about Kammo.

562
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,328
Kammo, brother. Your sister-in-law.

563
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:12,196
My childhood love.
Try to understand.

564
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,704
Kammo was with you? - Yes.

565
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:16,896
Give it to me.

566
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,344
How much is it for? - 60.

567
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,744
Get the glasses. Go.

568
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,947
Why are you getting angry?
Sit down.

569
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,184
Here. - Stand up.

570
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:33,746
Sit down.

571
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,692
Sorry, Kullu.
You got humiliated because of me.

572
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:43,062
That's a taken when someone goes with you.

573
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:47,499
But get this straight, don't call me Kullu..

574
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,896
..if l don't seek revenge for this humiliation.

575
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:52,299
lf l don't take money from Simran..

576
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:58,810
..then l won't even look at liquor.

577
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,976
Don't you think you've taken a very big stand?

578
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:12,087
Go make scrambled eggs for me.

579
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,302
Will she find out that we are hiding behind the truck?

580
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:20,746
She won't find out.

581
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:22,527
You just keep your mouth shut.

582
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:23,611
She won't find out.

583
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:25,040
We'll steal her purse and..

584
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,271
Fine. Then tell me something..

585
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:28,618
l don't know what's wrong.

586
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:30,268
My eye is twitching since morning.

587
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:31,666
l hope nothing goes wrong.

588
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:32,705
- Come here. Open.

589
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,852
Not your mouth, your eye.

590
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:43,085
Enough. Don't turn me blind with your blows.

591
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:45,861
Are you feeling better?
- Yes, l am.

592
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:53,704
She doesn't know that two devils are hiding here to steal her purse.

593
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,372
What are you two doing here?

594
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,100
Damn, the truck just vanished!

595
00:34:58,676 --> 00:34:59,870
You wanted to hide behind a truck, right?

596
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:02,809
What are you and your cheap friend doing here?

597
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,871
We were here to..

598
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,878
The thing is..

599
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,015
You bastard, my purse.

600
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,118
You brought a thief along to get your money?

601
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,095
l don't know him.

602
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:12,839
- Hey! - We..

603
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,721
Then someone go and get my purse!

604
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:16,788
Thief! - Come!
- Let's go!

605
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,725
Let's go.
- You go from the other side!

606
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:21,051
Why did he leave me alone?

607
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,691
l'll go the other way around.

608
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:23,926
Oh God!

609
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,773
Sorry! Sorry!

610
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:33,243
Are you blind or do you have cataract?

611
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,242
What did you say?

612
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:35,184
What else will l say?

613
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,769
l'm a doctor.

614
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:37,041
l told you what is wrong with you.

615
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:37,950
Come to the clinic.

616
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,048
l'll treat you for free.

617
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,277
You scoundrel.

618
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,145
l have a pizza shop.

619
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:44,271
Come to my shop.

620
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:46,007
l'll stuff you into the oven.

621
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,250
l would've done that right away but l'm in a hurry.

622
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:49,348
l've to catch a thief.

623
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,857
You scoundrel..

624
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,998
Your purse.
- Oh, thank you so much.

625
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,700
By the way, what were you doing here?

626
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,467
The same what that thief did.

627
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:05,872
l had come to take 120 dollars from your purse.

628
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,474
Then the thief must've ruined your plans.

629
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,604
True. But it's okay.
 Leave it.

630
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:11,773
Check your purse.

631
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,385
Your 120 dollars.

632
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:30,158
My beloved

633
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,626
Forgot something? - Yes.

634
00:36:34,071 --> 00:36:37,336
My beloved

635
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:41,445
What did you forget?

636
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,478
l want to see you again.

637
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,668
l don't want your money.

638
00:36:48,886 --> 00:36:49,723
You are a fool.

639
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,812
- l'll come to you to get my money.

640
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,689
And you can make me go away.

641
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:57,693
We'll continue in this manner.

642
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:01,862
l don't know why, l don't want this to end.

643
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:04,700
Will you come out with me for a cup of coffee?

644
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,495
l'm in a hurry.
 - lt's okay.

645
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:08,092
Some other day, perhaps.

646
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:10,271
l'm in a hurry to have coffee.

647
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:12,273
See you tomorrow.

Thank you.
For coffee.

00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,046
Here you go, sir.

650
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:26,523
What is this? - Black coffee.

651
00:37:27,024 --> 00:37:28,116
Black coffee?!

652
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:30,255
Brother, l add milk even to my vegetables.

653
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:31,920
And you've brought black coffee for me?
- Sorry.

654
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:34,120
Don't beguile nave people. Please.

655
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:35,324
Try to understand.

656
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,112
l too have some honor.

657
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,684
Please don't mind it.

658
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:40,529
Coffee, please.

659
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:43,429
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

660
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:46,742
Goli, why did you choose this as your profession?

661
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:48,942
l don't know anything else.

662
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,548
You're talking just like my grandfather.

663
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,074
He too was a cop, Canada Police.

664
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:55,742
Oh really?
 - He was very famous.

665
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:57,750
You must've heard about him for sure.

666
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,556
Jarnail Singh.

667
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,160
Okay. Perhaps you might have not heard about him.

668
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,355
Why don't you tell me something about yourself?

669
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,394
l'm a landlord's son.

670
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,083
My father asked me to get into farmer.

671
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,862
But l was busy chasing girls.
- Then?

672
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,060
Then what? To teach me a lesson..

673
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,471
..he opened a snack stall right outside my college.

674
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:19,372
Oh really?
What uncle did was not right.

675
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:21,264
No problem. l was no less.

676
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,938
After all l'm his son.

677
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,912
l said, here you go. l used to go there with a new girl every day.

678
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,813
And used to feed them free snacks from his stall.

679
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,513
Girls were happy because they were getting free snacks.

680
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,658
And l wanted him to stop this business of his.

681
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,360
Because of this one day father choused me.

682
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,026
l've heard about cheating but, chousing?

683
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:42,914
He choused me.

684
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,558
l mean l used meet all girls at different times.

685
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:49,237
And one day he called all the girls at the same time.

686
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:52,837
That's it.
That was the day by future in lndia was over.

687
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:56,635
And hence l came to Canada to set myself up.

688
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:59,443
Just to get set or settle as well?

689
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:02,746
Now l want..

690
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:06,951
Did you want to say something important?

691
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:13,693
l like you.

692
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:17,666
My beloved. My beloved.

693
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:22,162
Take care.
- My beloved.

694
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:25,709
My beloved. My beloved.

695
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,643
My beloved. My beloved.

696
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:29,805
What are you thinking now?

697
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:34,449
l think now l'll settle down.

698
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:40,514
My beloved. My beloved.

699
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:48,224
l spend each moment thinking about you.

700
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:01,439
l spend each moment thinking about you.

701
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:08,484
Now, l realized how long these nights last.

702

00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:23,093
Listen, my love, l don't like anything without you.

704
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:30,373
Now, this world feels empty without you.

705
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:37,480
My beloved. My beloved.

706
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:44,315
My beloved. My beloved.

707
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:51,891
Your love has taught me patience.

708
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:58,901
Your love has taught me to value life.

709
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:13,016
Your love has taught me patience.

710
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:19,920
Your love has taught me to value life.

711
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:26,359
All my desires have been sacrificed for your memories.

712
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:33,264
All my desires have been sacrificed for your memories.

713
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:40,273
Now, l realized how long these nights last.

714
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:47,575

00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:16,312
Now, this world feels empty without you.

719
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:23,285
Listen, my love, l don't like anything without you.

720
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:31,294
You know, Kammo has become a doctor.
- Good.

721
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:33,262
But you don't need to be so happy about it.

722
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,494
We cannot get married because l'm a doctor.
- Why?

723
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,660
Brother Baljeet will get me married to a doctor.

724
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:42,297
Kammo, tell your brother that Happy is a doctor.

725
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:43,362
Right?
- Yes.

726
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:44,566
What kind of a doctor is he?

727
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:46,802
Say that he is a vet.

728
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:49,600
We'll fix a dog's leg to demonstrate.

729
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,908
Right?
- Yes.

730
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:52,107
lt's not that easy.

731
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:56,381
Then marry a doctor and have an affair with Happy.

732
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:57,579
Right? - No.

733
00:42:57,721 --> 00:42:59,253
This is worse than lying.

734
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,546
- That's why l'm asking you to lie.

735
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:04,288
Trust me, we won't mess this up.

736
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:05,723
Right? - Right?

737
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:08,488
Yes. Right.

738
00:43:11,602 --> 00:43:13,399
Nothing, my jaw hurts.

739
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:18,232
Listen, there's a doctor coming to see Kammo.

740
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,028
No, nothing is wrong with her.

741
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:21,029
He wants to marry her.

742
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:23,942
Yes. Come over, whenever you have the time.

743
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,146
Stop. Do you want to go inside and stop?

744
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,725
Keep it here.

745
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:33,178
What a house he has!

746
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:34,246
Who?

747
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,756
Your brother-in-law.
- Say so.

748
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:39,051
Kullu..
- Yes?

749
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,960
When will we buy such a car?

750
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:44,257
Once we pay the installments for this scooter.

751
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:46,301
Please don't say such things inside.

752
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,462
Come with me.

753
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:49,563
Just a minute.

754
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:52,455
Let me check the lock.

755
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:54,000
- As if thief are going to steal it.

756
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:55,668
Come with me.
Behave.

757
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:57,474
Doctor, wear your glasses to be welcomed.

758
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:58,981
But you are the one who is going to do all the talking.

759
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:01,626
Where were you?

760
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:02,883
What took you so long? - Hey!

761
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,114

00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:06,781
Fine?
- Yes.

764
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:09,716
Have a seat.

765
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,789
What's the hurry?

766
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,194
Sit properly.

767
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:24,841
Where the doctor, your brother?

768
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:27,673

Doesn't he greet anyone?

772
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:35,676
- He does, brother. Shake hands.

773
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:37,953
Hello.
- Hand me the cushion, Doctor.

774
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:41,852
Dr. Happy..

Doctor..

776
00:44:46,263 --> 00:44:48,959
What makes you think he is a doctor?

777
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:52,036
His side profile.

778
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:54,123
- You are a doctor.

779
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,366
Can't you make out the difference between..

780
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:57,772
..a doctor and a pizza delivery guy?

781
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:59,503
You are a pizza delivery guy?

782
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,677
l sometimes deliver pizza on part time bases..

783
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:03,110
..whenever l get time to spare from the clinic.

784
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,977
Brother, he is a very nice person.

785
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:08,976
What kind of a doctor he is that he sells pizzas as well.

786
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:13,923
My clinic doesn't run that well hence l sell pizzas as well.

787
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:15,720
Brother, he's a very nice person.

788
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:19,128
Oh really?
He's a very nice person? - Yes.

789
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:22,290
By the way, what's his specialty?

790
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,028
Me? Doctor? Heart specialist..

791
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,534
Heart specialist..
- Yes, a heart specialist..

792
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:28,537
He's a heart specialist. - Yes.

793
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,429
He's a heart specialist.

794
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,339
Tell me, what medicine does one administer..

795
00:45:33,444 --> 00:45:35,844
..when a person is having a heart attack?

796
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,937
When a person has a heart attack..

797
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:43,952
lf his heart is small then we will give him a Crocin.
- Crocin.

798
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:48,684
lf his heart is big then we will give him..
- Anacin.

799
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:50,249
Anacin. - Anacin.

800
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:51,283
Give that person an Anacin.

801
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:53,489
Anacin. Crocin.

802
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:56,290
- Brother, he's a very nice person.

803
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,767
l'll never find such a nice person again.

804
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,895
He's a worthless pizza delivery boy!

805
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:08,369
We work hard for our living.

806
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:11,174
You are calling my brother a worthless pizza delivery boy!

807
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:12,475
What have you done!

808
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,483
Brother was hit by volleyball.

809
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,146
He wasn't hit by volleyball.

810
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,011
He was slapped earlier as well.

811
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:19,382
And that person was me.

812
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,684
You didn't tell me?

813
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:24,517
Kammo! - Get lost from here!

814
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:27,528
Anyway, we don't any relationship with such a family.

815
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,731
Let's go, Happy. - Get lost!

816
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:40,941
Ballu.. - Yes?

817
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:43,340
My gun is getting rusty.

818
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,778
Grandpa, guns are bound to get rusty if not used.

819
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:47,939
What did you say?

820
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:49,783
l mean it's not being used.

821
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,568
Hence it is getting rusty.

822
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:54,155
The situation outside is bad.

823
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:59,657
Drugs and gang wars is ruining this country.

824
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:04,564
Things were different when l was a cop.

825
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,065
Now there is no hope left.

826
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:10,364
There is still hope, grandpa.

827
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:14,669
l met a cop who is just like you.

828
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:15,801
Really?

829
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,116
You can never find anyone who is like grandpa.

830
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:23,676
Truly, grandpa.

831
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:25,446
He too hates drugs.

832
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:28,420
He risks his life and protects the citizens of this city.

833
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:30,820
The whole city orjust you?

834
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:32,117
Ballu!

835
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,723
Preet, l know that you are smart.

836
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:42,227
l'm sure that the person you like must be nice.

837
00:47:43,173 --> 00:47:46,336
But l'm more experienced than you are.

838
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,846
l'll say yes only after l meet him.

839
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:54,046
l want him to stay with me for a week.

840
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:57,452
You can test a person only when he stays with you.

841
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:00,823
What happened?

842
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:02,182
He didn't take your call again?

843
00:48:05,395 --> 00:48:06,876
lt's okay.
He's a cop.

844
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:08,787
He must be busy somewhere.

845
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:11,300
He could've spared some time for me at least today.

846
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:12,500
lt's his birthday.

847
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:15,163
The bouquet l've prepared for him will wither.

848
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:18,072
You'll wither before these flowers do.

849
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:20,377
Do one thing.

850
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,668
Why don't you go to his office and surprise him?

851
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:25,138
l don't think it's right for me to go to his office?

852
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:26,341
l won't do such a thing.

853
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:30,309
lf you don't think it is the right thing to do then l'll go there.

854
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:32,216
l'll try hitting on him.

855
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,279
Shut up and sell flowers here.

856
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:35,342
Stop acting smart.

857
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:36,923
She thinks she is Heer's cousin.

858
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:40,230
l'm going to meet my Ranjha.

859
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:43,424
Do make sure that you look like a beautiful Punjabi Heer.

860
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:03,074
Hi.

861
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:04,595
May l help you?

862
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:05,771
- Can l meet Goli?

863
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:08,682
Goli? Who are you?

864
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:11,450
l'm Preet. Goli's friend.

865
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:12,985
Today is his birthday.

866
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:14,082
Didn't he tell you?

867
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:16,962
l've been calling him since yesterday.

868
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,595
He's not answering it.

869
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,769
He's a busy police officer, isn't he?

870
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,496
Police officer?
- Yes.

871
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,702
And you want to give him a surprise?

872
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:29,403
l too have a surprise for him.

873
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,408
Surprise?
- Yes.

874
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,242
Are you talking about this Goli?

875
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:39,311
Yes.

876
00:49:40,023 --> 00:49:40,718
He's not a cop.

877
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,039
He's an infamous gangster.

878
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:49,223
Canadian police know about all his deeds.

879
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,360
Goli is very smart.

880
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,330
He destroys all the evidence after he commits a crime.

881
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,072
We'll arrest him pretty soon.

882
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:52,289
l pray that God gives him a long life and a lot of success.

883
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,988
You know my son threw me out of the house?

884
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,591
He built a small house for me and gave me refuge.

885
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:02,900
My son had become a drug addict.

886
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,804
He helped him get out of this mess.

887
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,909
Where is Goli?

888
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,611
Dear, he is serving food at the community kitchen.

889
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:16,604
Good that you came to know about the truth, Preet.

890
00:52:17,814 --> 00:52:19,645
l wanted to tell you the truth.

891
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:22,942
But why did you hide the truth from me, Goli?

892
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:25,347
l didn't want to lose you by telling the truth.

893
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:29,089
This is the first time someone felt so close to me.

894
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,855
The form which l have seen of you..

895
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:36,762
..seeing that makes it difficult for me to believe..

896
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,162
..that you're a gangster.

897
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:44,966
How can such a kind-hearted person choose such a path?

898
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,867
l didn't come here to become a gangster either.

899
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:50,969
'l was a taxi driver.'

900
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:54,675
'l was observing the people of this country very closely.'

901
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:57,284
'Youth were getting addicted to drugs.'

902
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:01,523
'Drugs took my brother away from me.'

903
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,692
'Then one day l found a Punjabi boy..'

904
00:53:04,795 --> 00:53:07,491
'..doing drugs. He was of my brother's age.'

905
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:09,790
Punjabis don't learn to do such things.

906
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,800
Punjabis teach others to work hard.

907
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:14,797
l'm sorry.

908
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:18,039
Promise me that you'll never do such a thing again.

909
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:19,736
l won't do it again.

910
00:53:21,244 --> 00:53:23,235
'l couldn't stop myself.'

911
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:27,046
'Anyone who was selling drugs became my enemy.'

912
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:32,187
l had to choose this path to get rid of drugs in our country.

913
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:37,859
Follow him. l'll be right here.

914
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:46,965
lf you still think that l'm wrong then you can leave me.

915
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:49,566
lf l wanted to leave you..

916
00:53:51,308 --> 00:53:53,674
..then l would've never come here after knowing everything.

917
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:58,975
But Goli, my grandpa will never let us be together.

918
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,981
Do you love me? - Yes.

919
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:05,181
Then have faith in God.

920
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:25,241
l started hating all schools.
- Why?

921
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:28,634
Look, if there were no schools..

922
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:32,142
Baldy..
- Then.. Listen to me. - Yes?

923
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,082
lf there were no schools then there would've been no education.

924
00:54:36,453 --> 00:54:38,751
lf there was no education, there would've been no doctors.

925
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:40,852
lf there were no doctors..

926
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:42,549
Then your sister-in-law Kammo..

927
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,659
..would've been with your brother today.

928
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:45,976
Don't worry.

929
00:54:46,002 --> 00:54:48,285
Your brother is with you.

930
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:50,096
What did you say?
What did you say?

931
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,861
Come here. Come on.

932
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:53,261
What did you say?

933
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:55,392
Brother?
You are my brother?

934
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:59,272
lf one has a brother like you then he doesn't need an enemy.

935
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:00,610
Move. l'll tell you.

936
00:55:00,636 --> 00:55:02,302
l'll jump off the bridge.

937
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:04,279
l'll jump.
- Get down.

938
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:06,580
Why are you stopping me?

939
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:09,309
Move aside.
- You'll jump off this bridge?

940
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:10,212
l will.

941
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:13,541
- You have such a bad face.

942
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,615
lf you jump off the bridge you'll look uglier.

943
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:18,592
Your Kammo will look at your ugly dead body..

944
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:21,994
..and get married to a handsome, young man.

945
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:23,122
Really?

946
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:26,199
Then.. Kullu, l'll consume poison.

947
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:28,555
Your brother will consume poison.

948
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:31,129
With the amount of liquor you've consumed in you life..

949
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,142
..there is so much poison in your body that..

950
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:36,940
..if you bite a snake, it will die.

951
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,248
He'll consume poison.

952
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:40,686
l'll shoot myself.

953
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,974
l'll shoot myself.

954
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:44,047
This man will shoot himself.

955
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:47,045
Which bullet will you use?
Paracetamol?

956
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:49,648
Get lost!
- We don't have money to buy a sprinkler..

957
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,251
..and he wants to shoot himself.

958
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,256
l'll shoot myself.

959
00:55:53,697 --> 00:55:56,461
What do l do, Kullu?

960
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:59,366
l cannot even die in peace.

961
00:56:00,704 --> 00:56:02,368
Tell me what should l do?

962
00:56:02,394 --> 00:56:03,391
What do l do?

963
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,528
Don't worry!

964
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:08,402
You are crying! You..

965
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,075
l'm joking with you!

966
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:15,881
l'll find a solution.

967
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:17,883
What do you mean?

968
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:20,815
Your.. Who is he..

969
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:23,921
l'll kidnap your brother-in-law!

970
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:27,927
We'll kidnap him but how will we convince your sister-in-law?

971
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:29,430
We'll kidnap her as well.

972
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:31,166
She's your sister-in-law.

973
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:32,551
Show some respect.

974
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:35,433
We'll kidnap her.

975
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,233
We'll convince sister-in-law.

976
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:43,640
How? - We'll sing a song.

977
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:52,452
Three..

978
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:54,178
Two..

979
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:56,080
One.

980
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:05,295
The common tap in our school..

981
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:10,062
We used to clean our slates there.

982
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:15,669
l'm talking about the year 1991 or 1992..

983
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,709
That's the time since when l've been thinking about you.

984
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:26,019
Whenever l used to come to your village for milk..

985
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:31,816
l couldn't ever give it but l used to get a letter with me.

986
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,928
Whenever l used to come to your village for milk..

987
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,264
l couldn't ever give it but l used to get a letter with me.

988
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:45,441
Whenever you used to pass by me coyly..

989
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:48,636
..l used to end up hitting my cycle into something.

990
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,245
l'm talking about the year 1991 or 1992..

991
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:54,145
That's the time since when l've been thinking about you.

992
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:57,151
l'm talking about the year 1991 or 1992..

993
00:57:57,253 --> 00:58:00,279
That's the time since when l've been thinking about you.

994
00:58:17,907 --> 00:58:19,071
l couldn't study.

995
00:58:19,097 --> 00:58:21,493
My education went down the drain.

996
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:27,246
l used to get into fights because of you in college.

997
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:31,954
l couldn't study.

998
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,249
My education went down the drain.

999
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:42,724
When you used to dance, boys used to go crazy!

1000
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:45,264
l'm talking about the year 1991 or 1992..

1001
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:48,335
That's the time since when l've been thinking about you.

1002
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:51,339
l'm talking about the year 1991 or 1992..

1003
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,638
That's the time since when l've been thinking about you.

1004
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,663
Goli's calling me?

1005
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:20,496
Hello?

1006
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,094
Yes, Goli. How are you?

1007
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,800
What made you think of me, my friend?

1008
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:28,002
Shamsher, l enjoy burning your drugs..

1009
00:59:28,244 --> 00:59:30,804
..as much as l used to enjoy bursting firecrackers when young.

1010
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:34,908
Scoundrel, my men will kill you.

1011
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:39,114
Your men pay me to beat them.

1012
00:59:39,255 --> 00:59:43,521
Look Goli, listen, there's a lot of money in my business.

1013
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:44,615
A lot.

1014
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,626
Join hands with me.

1015
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,061
l'll make you a king.

1016
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:51,930
Hey, l'm already an emperor.

1017
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:55,727
You want do downgrade me by making me a king?

1058
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:14,353
What do l do if you are not feeling well?

1059
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,288
l myself am going to get medicines for me.

1060
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:22,323
lt's still hot.

1061
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:24,586
Listen, today we won't spare him.

1062
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,962
He's a doctor and not a James Bond.

1063
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,670
We'll kidnap him in no time.

1064
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:31,069
Kullu..
- Yes?

1065
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:33,374
What?
- l need to pee.

1066
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,477
What are we here for and what do you want to do!

1067
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:36,143
What can l go?

1068
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:36,999
l'm getting the pressure.

1069
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,917
Great! l feel like..

1070
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:39,699
- Are you coming with me or should l go?

1071
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:40,976
Let's go.
Hurry up. He might return.

1072
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:44,076
l say you just pee on the tyres like the dogs.

1073
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:12,609
The car is still here.

1074
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:14,407
l wonder what important work the doctor is doing..

1075
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:15,506
..that he is still not back.

1076
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,145
Who knows, when we went to pee,
he might have had a bowel movement.

1077
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:20,018
Let's put scratches on his car.

1078
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:22,623
Think of something else.

1079
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,056
Wait. - Hurry up. Wait a minute.

1080
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:24,678
Wait a minute.

1081
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:25,225
Wait a minute.

1082
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:25,733
Here you go.

1083
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:26,583
A village thing.

1084
01:01:26,609 --> 01:01:27,113
Here you go.

1085
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:27,709
A screwdriver.

1086
01:01:27,735 --> 01:01:28,855
- You keep a screwdriver with you?

1087
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:31,366
Then what!
My father was a thief in Rawalpindi.

1088
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:32,263
This is an expensive car.

1089
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,084
This is not Rawalpindi.

1090
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:33,993
lt won't open this easily.

1091
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:35,128
- lt will. lt will.
Why won't it?

1092
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:37,469
Here you go. Look at this. - Hey.

1093
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:38,093
Get in quickly.

1094
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:39,523
- l say let's start stealing cars.

1095
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:40,974
Close it. Come on, get in.

1096
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:42,476
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1097
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:45,672
l'll tear the seats of the doctor's car.

1098
01:01:58,995 --> 01:01:59,812
lt's a nice car.

1099
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:01,011
lt's raining as well.

1100
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,689
l say, let's park and enjoy a drink.

1101
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,793
Let's not get out of the character, Dacoit Jeevan Singh.

1102
01:02:09,105 --> 01:02:13,599
Dacoit Bhagtawar Singh, we'll kill this doctor..

1103
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:17,602
..by slapping him a number of times.

1104
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:21,944
Because we've already killed many with bullets.

1105
01:02:22,518 --> 01:02:25,749
Very good, Dacoit Jeevan Singh.

1106
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:27,049
Change. That's old.

1107
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:31,058
Oh, sorry.
Very good, Dacoit, Robot.

1108
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:36,561
Yo Yo Honey Singh!

1109
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:42,865
We will cut him into small-small pieces.

1110
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:48,910
We'll go home and place him..

1111
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:51,911
On a block of ice.

1112
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,505
He'll have no clothes on.

1113
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,112
So that he doesn't feel cold.

1114
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:59,584
Hey! We'll cause trouble!

1115
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,512
Catastrophe!

1116
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:05,492
'Last night Goli set a car on fire in front of everyone.'

1117
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:08,793
'lt's said that this car had drugs in it.'

1118
01:03:08,898 --> 01:03:11,992
'Police is helpless as they cannot arrest him without any evidence.'

1119
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:15,298
'Goli destroys all evidences after he commits a crime.'

1120
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:19,102
'Drug mafias hate Goli and public loves Goli.'
- Brother!

1121
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:23,044
l've two sisters of marriageable age in village, brother.

1122
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:26,879
A blind mother and three unmarried paternal-uncle's wives.

1123
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:28,439
Careful or he will start doubting you.

1124
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:32,351
Sorry, brother. Two unmarried paternal-uncle's wives.

1125
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:33,854
My family will get ruined if anything happens to me.

1126
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,551
They will be as good as dead, brother.

1127
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:37,450
Untie my hands.
- What?

1128
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,294
Brother, we'd gone to kidnap my girlfriend's brother.

1129
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:41,712
l had told him.

1130
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:42,886
He is so ugly.

1131
01:03:42,965 --> 01:03:45,661
But yet, he has kidnapped such a handsome, young man.

1132
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:46,395
Please forgive us, brother.

1133
01:03:46,421 --> 01:03:46,885
Please forgive us.

1134
01:03:46,969 --> 01:03:48,561
Untie my hands, you scoundrels.

1135
01:03:48,971 --> 01:03:50,962
Otherwise, l'll beat you black and blue.

1136
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,143
Don't say that, brother.

1137
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:53,727
Look, we are just like your kids.

1138
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:54,748
Not like his kids.

1139
01:03:54,774 --> 01:03:55,596
We are his kids.

1140
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:57,075
Dad! - Dad!

1141
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,178
We've made a mistake.

1142
01:03:58,204 --> 01:03:59,105
Please forgive us.

1143
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,376
We cannot untie your hands.

1144
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:02,508
We'll do anything else you ask us to do.

1145
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:03,779
Kullu, quickly untie him.

1146
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:07,515
lf he manages to free himself then he'll open us up as well.

1147
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:08,917
Brother, l'll start untying you.

1148
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:10,275
Brother, l'll untie the ropes.

1149
01:04:10,301 --> 01:04:11,541
- This rope belongs to him.

1150
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:22,021
Gun! He has a gun!

1151
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:24,159
- lt's not a gun! lt's a pistol.

1152
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:29,338
Brother.. brother, the newsreader was saying..

1153
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:31,940
..that you help the poor people.

1154
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:35,149
You won't find anyone poorer than us. Have a look.

1155
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:36,946
Please spare us. Let us go.

1156
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:40,450
Brother, we are unfortunate lovers.

1157
01:04:40,556 --> 01:04:43,650
Brother doesn't know about the troubles that lovers face.

1158
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:46,091
Why will he listen to our problems?

1159
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:48,355
Speak up.
Say whatever you want to.

1160
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,264
Brother, it will be our good fortune if..

1161
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:02,571
..we are able to help you in any way.

1162
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:05,485
Come on, Happy, brother has forgiven you.

1163
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:06,500
You can leave.

1164
01:05:06,682 --> 01:05:08,274
Brother has forgiven you as well.

1165
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:09,884
Thank you, brother.

1166
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:11,876
Stop.

1167
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:19,183
Yes, Preet.

1168
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:20,922
l've been trying your number since so long.

1169
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:22,430
Why aren't you answering the phone?

1170
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,825
Grandpa wants to meet you this week.

1171
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:26,002
What do we do now?

1172
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:27,689
l can't think of anything.

1173
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:29,129
Think of something.

1174
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:31,829
lt's okay.
Tell him that he boy is coming to meet him.

1175
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,732
Okay. Bye.

1176
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:42,443
You wanted to do something for me, right?

1177
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:44,850
Yes.
 - Not you.

1178
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:46,443
Yes.

1179
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:50,553
Me? Yes.
Yes, brother.

1180
01:05:52,094 --> 01:05:55,461
l, too, am in love just like you guys.

1181
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,305
Brother, we got scared for no reason.

1182
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:00,285
You are just like us.

1183
01:06:01,904 --> 01:06:03,565
l've an old habit.

1184
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,670
l don't talk much.

1185
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:08,271
l don't listen at all.

1186
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:12,470
So better don't confuse me!

1187
01:06:15,384 --> 01:06:18,319
The girl's grandfather wants to meet me.

1188
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:20,585
He's a retired police officer.

1189
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,282
And he thinks that l, too, am a cop.

1190
01:06:22,325 --> 01:06:25,624
l want you to go to her grandfather's house..

1191
01:06:26,128 --> 01:06:28,426
..and only return after he gives his consent.

1192
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,022
But brother, l don't understand that even if l get..

1193
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:36,130
..her grandfather's consent, how will you marry sister-in-law?

1194
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:38,639
We'll take care of that later.

1195
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:42,533
Yes? Speak up.

1196
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:45,280
Brother, we kidnapped you to get our work done..

1197
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:46,872
..and you are getting your work done and leaving.

1198
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:49,950
What about me and Kammo?

1199
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:52,947
Where will l find your Kammo's brother?

1200
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:58,057
Yes, what's wrong?

1201
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:00,693
Who are you, brother?

1202
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:03,955
Look at this. Your father.
- Bipasha?

1203
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:07,897
Sorry, brother.

1204
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:09,770
Look at this!

1205
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:13,365
Sorry, brother.
We don't get newspapers.

1206
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:15,092
Your sister will marry him.

1207
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:16,493
- Thank you, brother.

1208
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:18,376
l'll marry her wherever you want me to.

1209
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:20,783
ls the job done?

1210
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:21,597
Can we leave now?

1211
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:22,580
Yes. - Yes.

1212
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:24,313
But brother, your future is uncertain..

1213
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:26,918
l mean you keep shuttling in and out.

1214
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:28,114
Who knows how long it will take?

1215
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,419
How about if you got us engaged today..
- Yes, brother.

1216
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,120
Come on, apply ceremonial dot on the boy's face.

This wad of money..

Why is it still in the pocket?

1267
01:09:42,858 --> 01:09:44,450
This wad of money..

1268
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,427
Why is it still in the pocket?

1269
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:50,330
You should use it one by one, on a nice girl.

1270
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:53,925
You should use it one by one, on a nice girl.

1271

Energy is high.

1277
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,274
Your brothers are dancing wearing a tie!

1278
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:11,649
Where the hell are you?!

1279
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:14,554
Goli, what if grandpa finds out the truth?

1280
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:16,249
This is what l'm trying to say, brother.

1281
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:17,959
l'll get trapped by going there.

1282
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,357
Her grandfather will catch be for sure.

1283
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:20,192
You should go meet him.

1284
01:10:20,218 --> 01:10:21,011
After all you are Goli.

1285
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:23,360
l would've gone if l'd to go as Goli.

1286
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,657
You'll have to go as Preet's boyfriend.

1287
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:27,077
Brother, that's fine.

1288
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:29,119
But l'm scared of going to a cop's house.

1289
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:30,232
Don't feel scared.

1290
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:31,790
Be Dharmendra.
Be brave.

1291
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:34,289
l can be Dharmendra.

1292
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:36,267
But what will l say after going there?

1293
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,725
What do l have to do?

1294
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:39,475
- That's not my problem.

1295
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:42,075
You know l've an old habit.

1296
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:43,470
l don't talk much.

1297
01:10:43,496 --> 01:10:45,600
And l don't listen at all.

1298
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:47,287
Do you want to say anything else?

1299
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:52,092
Careful, don't say anything that'll confuse me.

1300
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:55,994
Say something.

1301
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,292
l'm ready to go, brother.

1302
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:02,904
l'll risk my life and go to her grandfather's house.

1303
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:04,332
l'm very ready to go.

1304
01:11:04,507 --> 01:11:06,446
Done deal, brother.
- Done deal?

1305
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:08,229
l'm not selling you a plot.

1306
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,934
Done deal, right!

1307
01:11:10,412 --> 01:11:14,712
God willing one day l'll sell all the ancestral property.

1308
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,512
l'll bring everyone to streets!

1309
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:22,115
You are going to ltaly for 10 days?

1310
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:24,450
You know that it's important.

1311
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,359
Kullu, l was going to introduce you to my father after two days.

1312
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:29,897
ls it more important than that?

1313
01:11:29,965 --> 01:11:32,559
You had told me to work hard and succeed, right?
- Yes.

1314
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,363
But you can work hard in Canada as well.

1315
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,268
l can but you know that pizza comes from ltaly.

1316
01:11:37,573 --> 01:11:39,564
lt's a training program arranged by the company.

1317
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:42,901
You are looking sad as if l'm being exiled.

1318
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:44,969
You are going so far away for the first time.

1319
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,552
l'm a little worried.

1320
01:11:46,578 --> 01:11:48,732
Should l go with you?
 - No way.

1321
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:49,627
Happy is with me.

1322
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:51,141
- That's what l worry about.

1323
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,878
Who will look after you?

1324
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,180
No one has ever cared for me like this.

1325
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,524
lf l wasn't worried about making some money..

1326
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:01,189
..then l would never go there.

1327
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,047
Okay, fine.

1328
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:08,827
But come back soon.
- Don't worry.

1329
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:26,743
Grandpa...

1330
01:12:26,855 --> 01:12:27,910
you don't need to be so sad.

1331
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:29,178
Let the boy come here at least.

1332
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:30,953
Who knows you might end up liking him.

1333
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:33,551
This is what l fear.

1334
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:39,462
l won't have a reason to refuse if he is a nice boy.

1335
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:42,469
She must've not liked someone like Dharmendra.

1336
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:44,096
We know her.

1337
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,573
You are right.

1338
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,368
l say, you think of it as if you are ajudge of some reality show.

1339
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,912
Find so many faults in that boy that forget ours..

1340
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:57,976
..that boy should stop thinking about marrying anyone.

1341
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:01,919
What do we tell him that doctor has told us..

1342
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:03,788
..there is something wrong with him?

1343
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:06,524
Grandpa, why are you changing the topic?

1344
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,721
Find faults in him.

1345
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:10,196
Look, if he comes and says hello.

1346
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,590
Then you can say that he is very modern.

1347
01:13:12,701 --> 01:13:14,100
We want a cultural boy.

1348
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:17,137
lf he touches your feet that he is very backward.

1349
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:18,321
We need a modern boy.

1350
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:19,265
lt's very simple.

1351
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,301
Well done, Ballu.

1352
01:13:24,246 --> 01:13:27,647
You are very intelligent.

1353
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,675
But l don't get this.

1354
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:34,450
ln spite of being so intelligent, why didn't you get married?

1355
01:13:35,758 --> 01:13:36,884
Stupid.

1356
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:41,752
How could l get married?

1357
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:44,091
This is what the girl's family did to me.

1358
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,034
l'm scared, brother.

1359
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,120
- Don't feel scared.

1360
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:51,971
l'm right here.

1361
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:53,596
l've never said this to anyone.

1362
01:13:53,622 --> 01:13:54,897
l'm very scared of cops.

1363
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:57,902
l've heard that they hit where they have to..

1364
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,378
..but the hit hard where they aren't supposed hit.

1365
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:03,712
Time changes everything.

1366
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,186
Right now you are the one l'm most scared of.

1367
01:14:06,288 --> 01:14:06,922
Don't worry.

1368
01:14:06,948 --> 01:14:09,111
Call me if you find yourself in trouble.

1369
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:11,883
Do you want to say anything else?
- Yes.

1370
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:14,497
What?
- Please answer my call, brother.

1371
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:15,816
That's it. - Okay.

1372
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:17,521
Bye.

1373
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,589
See you.

1374
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:23,836
Okay, brother.

01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:26,563
Thank you.

1377
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,935
l've sent him but l wonder what he'll do there.

1378
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:38,842
God, please save me.

1379
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:40,981
This is the last time l'm getting into trouble.

1380
01:14:42,091 --> 01:14:43,490
See you, gangster brother.

1381
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:49,758
He's made me wear a stinky coat.

1382
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,758
He says it's Gucci's.

1383
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:55,669
Do they make such coats?

1384
01:14:57,072 --> 01:15:01,907
Grandpa, now it's either you or me.

1385
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,782
l think l'm done for.

1386
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,934
l'm scared.

1387
01:15:35,944 --> 01:15:37,639
Don't screw up.

1388
01:15:38,947 --> 01:15:40,039
Best of luck.

1389
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:28,118

01:16:40,242 --> 01:16:41,470
Why are you looking at him?

1396
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,076
Do you need to seek his permission to give me your blessings?

1397
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,234
No.

1398
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:45,836
He is our servant.

1399
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:47,838
He's your servant?

1400
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,941
Sir, l think you don't give him a salary.
- Why?

1401
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:51,884
He's still to take my bag from me.

1402
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:54,455
Stupid, go take his bag.

1403
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,447
Take my bag.

1404
01:16:57,759 --> 01:16:59,351
You are yet to give me your blessings.

1405
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:00,655
Please give me your blessings.

1406
01:17:00,863 --> 01:17:01,852
That's it.

1407
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:03,053
Please give it.

1408
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:04,988
Okay?

1409
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:08,364
l've been blessed.

1410
01:17:08,503 --> 01:17:09,868
l'm a huge fan of yours.

1411
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:11,869
Thank you, sir.
 Okay, bye.

1412
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,065
Let's go, dumbo.

1413
01:17:14,276 --> 01:17:16,176
Grandpa, how is he?

1414
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:18,777
He has just come here.

1415
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:22,377
We'll know tomorrow.

1416
01:17:22,818 --> 01:17:24,445
How long do you plan to stay here?

1417
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,110
Why?
Do you wish to rent the room?

1418
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:30,817
l was asking because it's of no use wasting time over this girl.

1419
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:32,855
Grandpa won't let you marry Preet.

1420
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,120
Oh really?
 How do you know that?

1421
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:37,628
l know everything. Grandpa discusses everything with me.

1422
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:39,758
l can understand the stand of a person..

1423
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:41,826
..which things are discussed with a stupid servant like you.

1424
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,632
Continue walking.

1425
01:17:42,738 --> 01:17:44,865
Don't worry.
l'll give you five star service.

1426
01:17:45,073 --> 01:17:47,132
Look how fragrant the room is.

1427
01:17:54,182 --> 01:17:55,649
Aren't there any proper rooms in the house?

1428
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:56,790
The rest of them are proper.

1429
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:58,448
This has been allotted specially for you.

1430
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:00,455
Scoundrel, you want me to stay in this junkyard?

1431
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:02,454
Junk is always placed in the junkyard.

1432
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:04,754
This means you too were born here.

1433
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:10,861
Hey, is there a rod stuck in his neck?

1434
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:13,059
Grandpa never bends before anyone.

1435
01:18:13,268 --> 01:18:14,462
That's why it's like this.

1436
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,070
Kiddo, l've made many small ones bend..

1437
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:18,662
..he is just someone big.

1438
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,799
Brother, l think you quoted it wrongly.

1439
01:18:20,876 --> 01:18:23,401
l am right.
 - l don't understand.

1440
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:25,413
Do you think we are smart or yourself a fool?

1441
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:26,708
Something like that.

1442
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,515
Listen..
 l don't think you'll eat anything now.

1443
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,654
l'll see you tomorrow morning at six for breakfast.

1444
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:35,517
At six?
- Yes.

1445
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:37,195
l don't get up that early.

1446
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:38,725
- Grandpa loves discipline.

1447
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,751
Come at six, otherwise stay hungry.

1448
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:43,024
You can pack your bags and leave whenever you want to.

1449
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:44,657
Okay? - Are you trying to scare me?

1450
01:18:44,933 --> 01:18:48,835
No. Okay.
See you at six. Good night.

1451
01:18:49,037 --> 01:18:50,334
Best of luck.

1452
01:18:54,743 --> 01:18:55,732
Hello?

1453
01:18:56,144 --> 01:18:58,237
Hello? Brother, there is a problem.

1454
01:18:58,647 --> 01:19:01,241
Forget the grandfather his servant is also very arrogant.

1455
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,874
l think they are suspicious.

1456
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:04,117
Why do you worry?

1457
01:19:04,143 --> 01:19:05,271
Just do your job.

1458
01:19:06,254 --> 01:19:07,846
Tell me how is Preet.

1459
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:08,830
Preet must be fine.

1460
01:19:08,856 --> 01:19:11,109
She doesn't have to fear her grandfather's gun.

1461
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:12,954
l am the poor guy who is feeling scared.

1462
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:15,356
Keep me informed.
- Okay.

1463
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:17,991
Brother, there's something else.

1464
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:19,358
Tell me.

1465
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:22,266
They want me to get up at six for breakfast.

1466
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,905
l cannot wake up before nine.
- So?

1467
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,605
Then tell them to get up at nine, please.

1468
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:28,903
They should wait for me.

1469
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:30,909
Do you know why you are saying this over the phone?

1470
01:19:31,113 --> 01:19:32,102
Why?

1471
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:34,805
Because if you'd said this to my face..

1472
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:37,708
..then l would have put you to sleep, forever.

1473
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:40,443
Brother, l'll wake up at five.

1474
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:42,044
l was just about to sleep.

1475
01:19:42,224 --> 01:19:43,452
l'm feeling very sleepy.

1476
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,618
lt's better to wake up early than never wake up at all.

1477
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:46,716
Okay, brother?

1478
01:19:46,928 --> 01:19:48,418
Hello? Brother?

1479
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:54,625
Why do l need to tell him that l'm hungry?

1480
01:19:54,736 --> 01:19:56,260
And that he should get me some scrambled eggs.

1481
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:58,105
lt's not as if he'd agree.

1482
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,095
He would've only abused me.

1483
01:20:17,959 --> 01:20:18,948
Pineapple.

1484
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,100
Ballu, go and check out.

1485
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:30,186
lt's so sunny at six in the morning?

1486
01:20:30,705 --> 01:20:32,673
Or l'm still on a high from last night.

1487
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:35,552
lt looks sunny outside.

1488
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:37,193
Good that it's not night.

1489
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,110
We're in Canada, right?

1490
01:20:40,282 --> 01:20:41,374
Should l go outside and check?

1491
01:20:41,483 --> 01:20:43,280
lf there's snow then we're in Canada.

1492
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:44,817
Otherwise we're slowly in our village.

1493
01:20:44,986 --> 01:20:47,477
Let it be.
Let it be. We are in Canada.

1494
01:20:47,923 --> 01:20:49,390
l don't understand..

1495
01:20:49,491 --> 01:20:53,291
..how you can be so undisciplined yet be so successful in Canada.

1496
01:20:53,495 --> 01:20:55,122
You are three hours late.

1497
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:59,198
My pant's color has got impressed on the chair.

1498
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:00,796
Then you should've brought proper pants.

1499
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:01,891
The one whose color won't run like this.

1500
01:21:02,003 --> 01:21:04,699
Oh really?
Couldn't you've brought proper chairs?

1501
01:21:04,806 --> 01:21:08,003
Young man? Get up.

1502
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,806
l.. Sorry..

1503
01:21:11,113 --> 01:21:12,910
Sorry. lt's your chair.

1504
01:21:16,451 --> 01:21:17,816
Your chair.

1505
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:19,946
l sat on it by mistake.

1506
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:22,687
Sit down.

1507
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,560
How come it's nine o'clock?

1508
01:21:29,898 --> 01:21:31,877
How do l know why it's nine o'clock?

1509
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:32,892
lt just happened.

1510
01:21:33,568 --> 01:21:34,557
You tell me, dumbo.

1511
01:21:34,669 --> 01:21:37,263
You get up at the same time as your master?

1512
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:39,303
lf you'll have to deliver pizzas like me..

1513
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:41,068
..then you'll know what a real job is.

1514
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:42,165
Right?

1515
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:43,869
Pizza delivery?

1516
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:45,969
Well..

1517
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:48,474
Sir, you've been a cop.

1518
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:50,483
You know how hard this job is.

1519
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,576
What all we have to do in it!

1520
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:57,784
Once l was chasing a gangster alone.

1521
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:00,084
Bullets were being shot.

1522
01:22:03,698 --> 01:22:06,292
One bullet hit a pizza boy.

1523
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:09,195
The pizza boy, who is covered in blood tell me..

1524
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:11,602
l'll lose my job if the pizza is not delivered on time.

1525
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:14,899
l, being a true, brave soldier of my country..

1526
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,843
..delivered the pizza within 30 minutes, sure.

1527
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:19,410
l saved his job.

1528
01:22:19,915 --> 01:22:25,251
Don't you think you should've said his life before saving his job?

1529
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:28,345
l didn't think so back then, sir.

1530
01:22:29,391 --> 01:22:30,653
But today l think l should have.

1531
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,157
Well done, young man.

1532
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:35,452
You left the police station to catch a gangster..

1533
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,465
..and you returned delivering a pizza.

1534
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,061
Good morning, everyone.

1535
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:42,267
What are you guys doing?

1536
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,066
Nothing.
He's telling us about his acts of bravery.

1537
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,665
Don't ask about his acts of bravery.

1538
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:48,828
l didn't ask.

1539
01:22:48,854 --> 01:22:50,903
He's telling us on his own.

1540
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,275
Stories don't mean anything, dear.

1541
01:22:53,715 --> 01:22:55,182
Ballu can tell you many.

1542
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:57,419
l believe only when l see.

1543
01:22:57,445 --> 01:22:58,603
- What do you mean?

1544
01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:03,319
Arrange for a garden shooting range tomorrow.

1545
01:23:05,493 --> 01:23:09,793
Let me see how good his aim is.

1546
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:16,193
Mr. Ballu, talk some sense into him.

1547
01:23:16,504 --> 01:23:20,941
The amount wasted on bullets can be used to feed a few poor.

1548
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:22,838
l'll ask grandpa to make it tough.

1549
01:23:23,144 --> 01:23:25,442
l'll hit you with this cup and saucer.

1550
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:27,980
What kind of a family do you have!

1551
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:34,083
Brother Goli, now only you can save me.

1552
01:23:37,259 --> 01:23:38,954
Please answer the phone.
This is great.

1553
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,857
You'd asked me to call if l had a problem.

1554
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:46,761
This is great.

1555
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:51,494
What happened?

1556
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:53,368
l've got soap in my eyes.

1557
01:23:54,709 --> 01:23:56,370
You sure you don't have something contagious?

1558
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,773
l'm telling you, there's soap in my eyes.

1559
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,575
l wonder how!

1560
01:24:00,782 --> 01:24:01,653
l was washing my face.

1561
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,707
Can't you see the water?

1562
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:04,885
Kids often get soap in their eyes.

1563
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,317
Come on, it's time to shoot.

1564
01:24:06,688 --> 01:24:08,485
l can't see anything, brother.

1565
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,887
Behave and come outside.

1566
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:11,788
Grandpa won't take a minute to break the neck.

1567
01:24:11,893 --> 01:24:13,485
What nonsense are you talking about? My neck?

1568
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:15,792
The rooster you have on your shirt.

1569
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:18,990
Oh okay.
- Come on, let's go out quickly.

1570
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:20,892
Where do l need to go?

1571
01:24:21,303 --> 01:24:22,497
Come with me.

1572
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,027
Where have you brought me?

1573
01:24:25,473 --> 01:24:27,338
Looks like grandpa.
- Huh?

1574
01:24:27,742 --> 01:24:29,733
Why is he behaving like Rani Mukherji in the movie Black?

1575
01:24:29,844 --> 01:24:31,937
He's got soap in his eyes.

1576
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:33,036
How did this happen?

1577
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:36,743
This happened when l was in the washroom to wash my hands..

1578
01:24:37,085 --> 01:24:37,975
There he runs!

1579
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:39,271
Come on, come back.

1580
01:24:42,257 --> 01:24:44,657
Run, son. Gangsters are here.

1581
01:24:52,867 --> 01:24:54,061
Where are they?

1582
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:58,471
Actually, the soap is out of my eyes.

1583
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:06,769
Very good.

1584
01:25:10,585 --> 01:25:12,280
Very good, grandpa.
Very good.

1585
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:13,979
l thought you must be not so good but you are great.

1586
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:15,316
You broke those bottles.

1587
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:18,523
l'm sure you'll grow up to be an incredible marksman.

1588
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:19,685
What did you say?

1589
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:22,019
l mean you'll be an even better marksman.

1590
01:25:22,297 --> 01:25:23,100
Come on, let's go home.

1591
01:25:23,126 --> 01:25:24,347
All the bottles have been broken.

1592
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:27,660
Son, l've broken these.
 - Yes.

1593
01:25:28,036 --> 01:25:29,230
You have to shoot those.

1594
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:36,643
These aren't birds which l can scare away by shouting.

1595
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:40,642
Anyway, l don't even look at liquor bottles on Tuesdays.

1596
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:43,545
Don't worry.
They are empty.

1597
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:44,303
Oh really?

1598
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:46,873
l never look at empty bottles anyway.

1599
01:25:47,555 --> 01:25:50,285
Will you shoot those bottles or should l shoot your rooster?

1600
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,253
Don't say anything to my rooster.

1601
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:53,475
lt's my pet rooster.

1602
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:54,175
Give it to me.

1603
01:25:54,201 --> 01:25:55,383
l'll shoot those bottles.

1604
01:25:57,565 --> 01:25:58,554
Hello?

1605
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:01,357
What are you doing?

1606
01:26:02,303 --> 01:26:04,168
l think you haven't seen Mahabharata.

1607
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:07,969
Why?
- ln that they used to recite a mantra before shooting an arrow.

1608
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:10,073
That way you hit bang on target.

1609
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:20,486
Son, the mantra of Mahabharata won't work around me.

1610
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:25,250
That's why you look so much like Duryodhana.

1611
01:26:25,326 --> 01:26:27,521
What did you say?
- Nothing.

1612
01:26:27,962 --> 01:26:28,951
l'll aim.

1613
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:24,207
Oh no!

1614
01:27:28,923 --> 01:27:31,721
Sometimes l make things work without mantras as well.

1615
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:33,216
Here you go?

1616
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:41,328
How is this possible!

1617
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:47,067
Grandpa, l've the lethal weapon of Mahabharata.

1618
01:27:54,682 --> 01:27:57,344
All the bullets are still in it.

1619
01:27:57,852 --> 01:28:01,686
Kiddo, sometimes, l shoot bottles..

1620
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,960
..without bullets.

1621
01:28:25,613 --> 01:28:27,740
Okay. l still have to buy the makeup.

1622
01:28:28,116 --> 01:28:29,413
l don't have more hands to lift your bags.

1623
01:28:29,517 --> 01:28:30,006
Do one thing.

1624
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:30,772
Drive a nail into my shoulder.

1625
01:28:30,798 --> 01:28:31,518
You can hang them there then.

1626
01:28:31,553 --> 01:28:32,713
Fine, let it be.

1627
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:34,918
My phone. My phone.
My phone.

1628
01:28:35,056 --> 01:28:36,477
Get it out, quickly.

1629
01:28:36,503 --> 01:28:38,278
Please. Please.
- Okay.

1630
01:28:38,826 --> 01:28:40,238
Hello?
Yes, Sheila.

1631
01:28:40,264 --> 01:28:42,343
Okay, are you coming over?

1632
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,431
Hello? - Happy?
- Happy?

1633
01:28:45,533 --> 01:28:47,467
Sheila. - Happy?
- Sheila.

1634
01:28:47,835 --> 01:28:49,530
What are you doing?
Happy..

1635
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:53,237
Oh no. Happy!

1636
01:28:55,443 --> 01:28:56,117
Try to understand.

1637
01:28:56,143 --> 01:28:57,265
- What are you doing, Happy?

1638
01:28:57,445 --> 01:28:59,242
Happy! Why are you hiding?

1639
01:28:59,347 --> 01:28:59,895
Who is she?

1640
01:28:59,921 --> 01:29:01,863
- And when did you return from ltaly?

1641
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,074
When did you go to ltaly?

1642
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:04,242
Why don't you ask one by one?

1643
01:29:04,786 --> 01:29:06,233
By the way, she is Simran.

1644
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:07,371
Kul's future wife.

1645
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:08,752
Where's Kullu?

1646
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:10,084
ln ltaly. - ltaly?

1647
01:29:10,258 --> 01:29:13,159
No. ltaly.
- But you went with him, right?

1648
01:29:13,361 --> 01:29:15,056
No, l just left him at the airport and returned.

1649
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:17,458
Okay. - What happened?
- Oh my God.

1650
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:20,259
l didn't get proper pressure in the morning.oh my God.

1651
01:29:20,668 --> 01:29:21,862
Try to understand.

1652
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:22,533
l'll have to go.

1653
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:23,860
- But Happy, at least listen to me.

1654
01:29:24,005 --> 01:29:25,597
At least listen to me.

1655
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:30,302
l don't know why he was behaving like this.

1656
01:29:31,613 --> 01:29:36,516
But if he didn't go with Kullu then why did Kullu lie to me?

1657
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:41,021
Give me a smile and sit next to me, Heer.

1658
01:29:41,723 --> 01:29:42,917
My Heer is calling me.

1659
01:29:44,225 --> 01:29:45,920
Hello? Simran?

1660
01:29:46,327 --> 01:29:48,124
Kullu? - Hello?

1661
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:49,521
Where are you, Kullu?

1662
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:50,620
l'm in ltaly.

1663
01:29:50,646 --> 01:29:53,147
- The same ltaly where Happy is?

1664
01:29:53,635 --> 01:29:54,260
What do you mean?

1665
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:58,135
l mean l met Happy in Vancouver.

1666
01:30:00,642 --> 01:30:02,337
You lied to me, Kullu?

1667
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:05,241
Simran, l'll lie? Never!

1668
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:07,644
Actually, you know Happy.

1669
01:30:07,749 --> 01:30:10,479
He ate so many as soon as he got on the flight..

1670
01:30:10,551 --> 01:30:12,883
..that he created a mess as soon as he reached the airport.

1671
01:30:13,054 --> 01:30:16,546
The company officers threw him out.

1672
01:30:17,058 --> 01:30:18,252
You are telling the truth, right?

1673
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:19,690
Have l ever lied, Simran?

1674
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:23,057
l've already told you that l never lie.

1675
01:30:23,264 --> 01:30:25,562
Yes, l think you are right.

1676
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:29,362
Happy had an upset stomach even when l met him here.

1677
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:30,960
Oh really? - Yes.

1678
01:30:31,072 --> 01:30:34,186
l mean.. Saw? l had told you.

1679
01:30:34,212 --> 01:30:37,002
He had an upset stomach.

1680
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:41,077
Hello, Preet.
- What are you doing, my Ranjha?

1681
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:42,774
l'm watching a Jat's stick.

1682
01:30:44,585 --> 01:30:45,779
A Jat's stick?

1683
01:30:47,522 --> 01:30:49,581
You are very good with a pistol.

1684
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:50,883
Then why are you looking at sticks?

1685
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:52,687
l'm watching a movie called a Jat's stick.

1686
01:30:54,195 --> 01:30:56,095
After falling in love people watch movies like..

1687
01:30:56,197 --> 01:30:59,291
.. 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' and 'DDLJ'.

1688
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,090
And you are looking at sticks!

1689
01:31:01,335 --> 01:31:04,793
Okay fine, please say something romantic.

1690
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:06,798
Do you think l'm romantic?

1691
01:31:08,242 --> 01:31:09,071
What do you mean?

1692
01:31:09,097 --> 01:31:09,632
Like what?

1693
01:31:11,713 --> 01:31:15,012
Like you rascal, you scoundrel!

1694
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,307
Now l should tell you what romantic is!

1695
01:31:17,452 --> 01:31:19,647
l wonder why l fell for such an unromantic person.

1716
01:31:27,562 --> 01:31:29,757
Do you love me, Kullu? 
- Yes.

1717
01:31:30,398 --> 01:31:31,583
Then why are you so scared?

1718
01:31:31,609 --> 01:31:33,187
Just say it out aloud, l love you.

1719
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:34,857
Yes.

1720
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:37,760
l love you.

1721
01:31:38,473 --> 01:31:39,497
He's whispering now.

1722
01:31:39,774 --> 01:31:41,503
Say it out aloud, l love you.

1723
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:43,066
l'm saying it out aloud, l love you.

1724
01:31:43,177 --> 01:31:44,474
Oh God.

1725
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:46,375
Strange. Being in the same house..

1726
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:47,880
..they are saying 'l love you' over mobile phones.

1727
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:49,982
Mobile phone networks are bound to get rich.

1728
01:31:54,522 --> 01:31:55,989
You didn't say it to me even once.

1729
01:31:56,691 --> 01:31:58,886
Say it. lt's just three words.

1730
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:01,119
l love you.
- Go to sleep.

1731
01:32:01,229 --> 01:32:02,696
Goli. - Sweet dreams.

1732
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:06,196
l'll get sweet dreams if you say 'l love you' to me.

1733
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,095
Please. Just once.

1734
01:32:09,303 --> 01:32:11,931
Strange.
He has twice said l love you in front of me.

1735
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,707
And she is saying that he hasn't said it even once.

1736
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:14,797
Good night.

1737
01:32:19,614 --> 01:32:21,005
Bloody scoundrel.

1738
01:32:21,031 --> 01:32:23,075
l'll slap him for sure.

1739
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:24,268
l won't say good night.

1740
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:25,167
l won't hang up.

1741
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,278
By the way, l love you.

1742
01:32:27,655 --> 01:32:28,747
l love you too.

1743
01:32:29,957 --> 01:32:35,259
Sometimes play..

1744
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:37,304
He has hung up.

1745
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,383
Who is she kissing?

1746
01:32:39,567 --> 01:32:40,795
Something is fishy.

1747
01:32:44,272 --> 01:32:45,864
l'll go and inform grandpa.

1748
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:50,701
l'll just call you back.

1749
01:32:50,778 --> 01:32:52,370
Sometimes..

1750
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:55,780
ln trouble.

1751
01:32:55,883 --> 01:32:57,180
Who? Me?
- Not you.

1752
01:32:57,318 --> 01:32:58,376
Come here.

1753
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,681
We are done for. Let's go.

1754
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:06,186
We're in trouble.

1755
01:33:06,394 --> 01:33:07,224
What are you saying?

1756
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:09,126
You think l'm mistaken?
- Yes.

1757
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:10,594
Grandpa, it's okay if you don't trust me.

1758
01:33:10,698 --> 01:33:11,892
At least trust your granddaughter.

1759
01:33:11,999 --> 01:33:14,797
She is spreading her eggs in different baskets.

1760
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:17,694
You scoundrel, how do l believe in what you are saying?

1761
01:33:17,805 --> 01:33:19,796
That she is having two affairs?

1762
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:22,337
No, l think she is not telling us the truth.

1763
01:33:23,377 --> 01:33:25,277
l've seen both of them saying 'l love you'..

1764
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:28,747
.. at the same time, at different places.

1765
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:31,140
Yes.

1766
01:33:31,352 --> 01:33:36,085
Then don't even look like they are in love.

1767
01:33:36,357 --> 01:33:37,756
That's what l'm telling you.

1768
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:39,854
Grandpa, now we will have to take a stand.

1769
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:42,088
We won't get a better reason to..

1770
01:33:42,163 --> 01:33:44,461
..not to give your consent for this relationship.
-Fine.

1771
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,293
Keep an eye on both of them.

1772
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:51,568
Things will get easier for us if they get caught red-handed.

1773
01:33:51,772 --> 01:33:53,672
Come with me.

1774
01:33:55,076 --> 01:33:56,065
Let's go.

1775
01:34:13,628 --> 01:34:16,772
We have given our hearts to each other.

1776
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:19,216
Why do you get scared, girl?

1777
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,287
l'm a brave village by.

1778
01:34:21,313 --> 01:34:22,954
l'm not that bad.

1779
01:34:24,372 --> 01:34:26,520
We have given our hearts to each other.

1780
01:34:26,546 --> 01:34:28,197
Why do you get scared, girl?

1781
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:30,049
l'm a brave village by.

1782
01:34:30,075 --> 01:34:31,541
l'm not that bad.

1783
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:35,276
Move a little for me, girl.

1784
01:34:35,349 --> 01:34:38,648
Move a little for me, girl.

1785
01:34:38,853 --> 01:34:43,847
She says, my father might find out about us.

1786
01:34:44,058 --> 01:34:47,550
Come, let me love you, girl.

1787
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:51,958
She says, my father might find out about us.

1788
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:59,069
Grandpa, if you are feeling hungry, l'll serve dinner.

1789
01:35:01,309 --> 01:35:03,470
Why are you so worried?

1790
01:35:04,078 --> 01:35:06,376
We've tried our best with that boy.

1791
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:08,778
Now with a heavy Heart consider that..

1792
01:35:08,883 --> 01:35:10,680
..you've given away your granddaughter for ever.

1793
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:16,382
No. He's not the kind Of boy l wanted for her.

1794
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:21,788
Think of something so that l can refuse this match..

1795
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:24,025
..and it doesn't make me look bad in front of Preet.

1796
01:35:24,231 --> 01:35:27,723
Then blame it to me, say that Ballu doesn't like the boy.

1797
01:35:27,835 --> 01:35:30,633
Now can you marry her to him when l don't like him?

1798
01:35:31,539 --> 01:35:34,642
Stupid, you are our servant.

1799
01:35:34,668 --> 01:35:36,661
l'm your master.

1800
01:35:37,845 --> 01:35:39,642
Then should l serve dinner? - Go.

1801
01:35:44,952 --> 01:35:48,080
'Canadian police is trying to find evidence against..'

1802
01:35:48,255 --> 01:35:50,052
'..Punjabi gangster Goli.'

1803
01:35:50,157 --> 01:35:53,558
'Some people are forcing the police to catch Goli.'

1804
01:35:53,761 --> 01:35:55,558
'Police chief says that..'

1805
01:35:55,763 --> 01:35:59,756
'..they don't have any evidence against him.'

1806
01:36:00,067 --> 01:36:01,500
'Police chief has also that..'

1807
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:03,466
'..that on the basis on suspicion Goli can..'

1808
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:07,473
What? Goli, the gangster?
That goon?

1809
01:36:08,376 --> 01:36:11,868
Hooligan.
l should catch him? - Yes.

1810
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,211
Only the cop who has the courage..

1811
01:36:16,784 --> 01:36:19,685
..to catch a gangster like Goli can marry my granddaughter.

1812
01:36:19,787 --> 01:36:21,812
Grandpa, what kind of a condition is this?

1813
01:36:22,089 --> 01:36:24,922
Getting you to agree for our marriage is tougher..

1814
01:36:25,059 --> 01:36:27,050
..than getting a visa for Canada.

1815
01:36:27,828 --> 01:36:29,029
Preet, l told you.

1816
01:36:29,055 --> 01:36:31,789
lt's hard to find cops like me nowadays.

1817
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:33,823
ln the year 1977..

1818
01:36:33,849 --> 01:36:36,087
- Your grandpa is that old!

1819
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:37,656
He'll be gone soon.
-Old?

1820
01:36:37,682 --> 01:36:38,787
Do you think he's a tractor?

1821
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,074
S.H. Jarnail Singh single-handedly..

1822
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:44,377
..wiped out the underground mafia's spread in Canada.

1823
01:36:45,746 --> 01:36:48,738
The entire police departments still respects that fact.

1824
01:36:48,983 --> 01:36:50,143
But grandpa..

1825
01:36:54,455 --> 01:36:58,152
Water..
- What he says is the final word.

1826
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:00,051
He never changes his decision.

1827
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:02,720
Stupid, l asked you to get me some water.

1828
01:37:02,746 --> 01:37:04,013
- Oh, sorry, grandpa.

1829
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,799
You embarrassed him.

1830
01:37:08,669 --> 01:37:10,967
You think you are very smart.

1831
01:37:12,306 --> 01:37:13,462
lt's okay, dumbo.

1832
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,732
Let's see who gets embarrassed.

1833
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:21,876
So now you will arrest me?

1834
01:37:21,982 --> 01:37:23,813
Brother, be grateful for if you know his habits..

1835
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:25,818
..he would've given me the order of shoot at sight.

1836
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,817
Kullu, please.
- lt's okay. Don't worry.

1837
01:37:30,357 --> 01:37:34,350
lt's possible that grandpa wants to meet his real son-in-law.

1838
01:37:34,528 --> 01:37:36,723
You just arrest me and take me to him.

1839
01:37:37,064 --> 01:37:38,656
And leave me alone with grandpa.

1840
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:39,984
Really, brother?

1841
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:40,985
You'll get rid of him?

1842
01:37:41,969 --> 01:37:44,665
No. l'll run as soon as l get an opportunity.

1843
01:37:44,939 --> 01:37:48,238
And you can blame grandpa that Goli ran away.

1844
01:37:48,342 --> 01:37:50,435
l'll blame him for everything.

1845
01:37:50,478 --> 01:37:52,036
For what all that has happened with me..

1846
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:54,047
..l'll say that he took a bribe and let Goli go.

1847
01:37:54,248 --> 01:37:55,943
Corrupt guy.

1848
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,884
Goli, l'm telling you, l'll really shoot him.

1849
01:38:00,054 --> 01:38:03,683
We'll have tomorrow's breakfast with grandpa.

1850
01:38:08,262 --> 01:38:09,354
What are you doing?

1851
01:38:11,465 --> 01:38:12,557
Grandpa..

1852
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:14,459
Grandpa..

1853
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:19,166
He's huge.

1854
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:22,170
He must be 80-90 years old.

1855
01:38:22,576 --> 01:38:24,043
l'm not talking about his age.

1856
01:38:24,645 --> 01:38:28,103
Size.
- Oh, you mean to say his size.

1857
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:30,516
Big body grandpa.

1858
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:40,116
You really caught him?

1859
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:45,722
Grandpa, please don't make me laugh.

1860
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:50,467
Yes. Open your eyes otherwise..

1861
01:38:50,671 --> 01:38:53,071
..l'll open up Goli, the gangster.

1862
01:38:53,374 --> 01:38:54,841
You are great, son.

1863
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:56,870
How did you catch him?

1864
01:38:58,179 --> 01:39:00,443
What do you think Dharmendra is?

1865
01:39:00,581 --> 01:39:02,947
He was distributing dollars to the poor.

1866
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,946
l disguised myself as poor, covered myself..

1867
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:07,848
..and sit in the queue of poor people.

1868
01:39:07,955 --> 01:39:10,150
As soon as he took out a dollar to give me..

1869
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:13,260
..l took out my pistol and placed it on his forehead.

1870
01:39:13,394 --> 01:39:16,852
l said, you got caught, Goli, the gangster.

1871
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:18,553
This is no act of bravery.

1872
01:39:18,579 --> 01:39:20,090
You caught him deceitfully.

1873
01:39:20,267 --> 01:39:22,064
This is great.
lt's like what Guggi says.

1874
01:39:22,203 --> 01:39:24,694
My dog is a dog and your dog is Tommy.

1875
01:39:24,805 --> 01:39:26,545
Don't l hold any value?

1876
01:39:26,571 --> 01:39:27,856
- Who is Guggi?

1877
01:39:28,008 --> 01:39:31,205
Forget Guggi, l feel as if you got your granddaughter married..

1878
01:39:31,345 --> 01:39:33,438
..when she was just a child.

1879
01:39:34,648 --> 01:39:36,946
You are looking for excuses to not get her married.

1880
01:39:37,218 --> 01:39:40,119
Tell me do you want your granddaughter to get married?

1881
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:43,654
Calm down.
You've done yourjob.

1882
01:39:43,857 --> 01:39:45,620
Now you leave him to me.

1883
01:39:45,726 --> 01:39:47,125
Yes, l should leave him with you.

1884
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:49,526
So that you kill him with your tales of bravery.

1885
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:52,428
This happened in the year 1977..

1886
01:39:52,533 --> 01:39:53,982
l did this. l did that.

1887
01:39:54,008 --> 01:39:55,959
l killed this. l killed that.

1888
01:39:56,036 --> 01:39:56,643
l did this.

1889
01:39:56,669 --> 01:39:58,655
l got hurt here.
 l got hurt there.

1890
01:39:58,772 --> 01:40:02,367
Hey!
- This is how you tell your stories, right, grandpa?

1891
01:40:03,944 --> 01:40:06,071
l know that you are a brave man.

1892
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:07,429
But be careful.

1893
01:40:07,455 --> 01:40:09,868
l'll get the backup police.

1894
01:40:09,984 --> 01:40:12,179
Because l don't want you to make him run away..

1895
01:40:12,253 --> 01:40:14,050
..through this balcony before l come back.

1896
01:40:14,088 --> 01:40:15,420
Okay. Leave.

1897
01:40:15,446 --> 01:40:19,107
- Oh yes. l'll be watching you.

1898
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:20,785
And you too.

1899
01:40:22,263 --> 01:40:23,252
Thank you.

1900
01:40:28,269 --> 01:40:31,067
Goli, son, please don't misunderstand me.

1901
01:40:31,305 --> 01:40:34,001
l wanted to meet you and thank you.

1902
01:40:35,276 --> 01:40:37,073
That's why l asked him to catch you.

1903
01:40:37,911 --> 01:40:41,278
What do you think that l too think that..

1904
01:40:41,415 --> 01:40:44,612
..you're a gangster like the rest of the world does?

1905
01:40:44,985 --> 01:40:45,974
No, son.

1906
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,918
The amount of cocaine you've destroyed in the past one year..

1907
01:40:49,023 --> 01:40:50,615
..the whole police force together..

1908
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:55,490
..must have not destroyed that much in 10 years.

1909
01:40:55,596 --> 01:41:01,535
ln 30 years l've spent as a cop, the feeling l had for my country..

1910
01:41:01,735 --> 01:41:04,727
l see the same feeling in you.

1911
01:41:06,307 --> 01:41:08,605
l don't know who Goli is, where he has come from..

1912
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:11,287
And why he is doing this.

1913
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:14,569
But l wish to salute you, son.

1914
01:41:22,356 --> 01:41:27,692
l wanted a brave boy like you for my granddaughter Preet.

1915
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:30,594
But she has chosen someone else.

1916
01:41:31,098 --> 01:41:33,589
Perhaps this is what God wants.

1917
01:41:34,268 --> 01:41:36,202
But if l had another granddaughter..

1918
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:38,504
..then l would've got her married to you.

1919
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:43,471
Son, run away from here before that fools get the cops.

1920
01:41:43,877 --> 01:41:44,901
Run away, son.

1921
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:49,809
Run through this window.

1922
01:41:50,084 --> 01:41:54,180
Keep doing the work that you're doing.

1923
01:41:54,321 --> 01:41:55,879
Just go for it, my boy.

1924
01:42:18,312 --> 01:42:19,939
Where's Goli (bullet)?
- ln the gun.

1925
01:42:20,347 --> 01:42:22,315
Am l your sister-in-law that you're joking with me?

1926
01:42:22,349 --> 01:42:23,873
Hey! - l'm asking you where is Goli!

1927
01:42:23,984 --> 01:42:25,366
He ran away. - He ran away!

1928
01:42:25,392 --> 01:42:26,646
You didn't do anything?

1929
01:42:26,687 --> 01:42:29,884
l had my breakfast. - Grandpa!

1930
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:32,982
Shut up!
What can l do if he ran away?

1931
01:42:33,394 --> 01:42:36,989
l tried to catch him, but he just slipped off my hands.

1932
01:42:37,164 --> 01:42:40,156
Preet, l risked my life and caught Goli, the gangster.

1933
01:42:40,267 --> 01:42:41,564
Grandpa made him run away.

1934
01:42:41,668 --> 01:42:43,311
Grandpa.. - Louder!

1935
01:42:43,337 --> 01:42:44,287
- Grandpa!

1936
01:42:44,872 --> 01:42:46,897
But you fulfilled your promise.

1937
01:42:47,307 --> 01:42:50,071
Preet, you and rooster can get ready..

1938
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:52,608
..and come to Hotel Sheraton in the evening.

1939
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:54,476
Who is this rooster? - You.
- Me?

1940
01:42:54,615 --> 01:42:56,310
You move around like a rooster.

1941
01:42:56,617 --> 01:42:58,585
Come there dressed as a gentleman.

1942
01:43:05,092 --> 01:43:05,608
You are a rooster.

1943
01:43:05,634 --> 01:43:06,550
Your grandfather is a rooster.

1944
01:43:06,627 --> 01:43:07,616
Your great grandfather was a rooster.

1945
01:43:07,728 --> 01:43:09,189
Your family is full of roosters.

1946
01:43:09,215 --> 01:43:10,813
Every one says cock-a-doodle-doo.

1947
01:43:23,143 --> 01:43:24,974
Mom. - Hi, my child.

1948
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:27,100
You've become so thin.

1949
01:43:27,126 --> 01:43:28,445
Do you eat anything at all?

1950
01:43:28,482 --> 01:43:29,357
Stop it, mom.

1951
01:43:29,383 --> 01:43:31,645
You always say that.
l work out.

1952
01:43:31,685 --> 01:43:33,448
lt's in fashion these days.

1953
01:43:33,887 --> 01:43:34,698
Come here.

1954
01:43:34,724 --> 01:43:37,075
Come here, my child.
- Dad!

1955
01:43:38,492 --> 01:43:39,392
Tell me, how's everything?

1956
01:43:39,418 --> 01:43:40,178
- Everything's fine.

1957
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:40,972
You tell me.

1958
01:43:40,998 --> 01:43:42,776
- How's your clothing store?

1959
01:43:42,896 --> 01:43:44,659
lt's doing great.
- Very good.

1960
01:43:44,765 --> 01:43:46,790
All your friends are doing well in Vancouver?
- Yes.

1961
01:43:47,468 --> 01:43:49,402
Any new friends?

1962
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:52,671
Dad, why don't you come to the point?

1963
01:43:52,773 --> 01:43:54,532
l know everything, dear.

1964
01:43:54,558 --> 01:43:56,097
- Did you tell him?

1965
01:43:56,276 --> 01:43:57,868
l should never tell you anything.

1966
01:43:58,011 --> 01:43:59,808
No, no, no.
l didn't tell him anything.

1967
01:43:59,913 --> 01:44:02,177
l just told him that his name is Kullu.

1968
01:44:02,282 --> 01:44:03,681
Yes. - Yes, Kullu.

1969
01:44:04,384 --> 01:44:05,314
What kind of a boy is Kullu?

1970
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:06,434
l hope he's from a good family.

1971
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:09,417
Dad, he's a very nice boy.

1972
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:11,615
Does he work or is he an idler?

1973
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:15,291
Dad, he doesn't make earn as much as you do, but he is hard working.

1974
01:44:15,596 --> 01:44:17,120
He'll succeed pretty soon.

1975
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:20,926
You know he went to ltaly for training, just for me.

1976
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:22,668
Good. Very good.

1977
01:44:23,337 --> 01:44:26,738
Dear, just make sure that he is getting married to you..

1978
01:44:26,773 --> 01:44:28,502
..because he loves you and not because..

1979
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:29,392
- And not because?

1980
01:44:29,843 --> 01:44:31,435
For the sake of Canada's Permanent Residency.

1981
01:44:31,478 --> 01:44:32,740
This is what boys nowadays do.

1982
01:44:32,846 --> 01:44:33,990
Like what you did with me.

1983
01:44:34,016 --> 01:44:35,838
- Shut up.
What do you think of yourself?

1984
01:44:35,883 --> 01:44:38,351
Dad, if you wish to say such things, can l leave?

1985
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:40,046
Sit down.
Sit down, dear.

1986
01:44:40,454 --> 01:44:43,389
Actually, l'm worried about you.

1987
01:44:45,158 --> 01:44:47,854
l've got a very good marriage proposal for you from Punjab.

1988
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:49,758
l really like the boy.

1989
01:44:49,863 --> 01:44:52,058
Why don't you marry him if you really like him that much.

1990
01:44:52,165 --> 01:44:54,998
l will, but you at least have a look at his photograph.

1991
01:44:55,102 --> 01:44:56,569
l don't want to see anyone's useless photo.

1992
01:44:56,703 --> 01:44:58,261
Forget it, show me the photograph.

1993
01:44:58,405 --> 01:45:00,008
You have a look at him.

1994
01:45:00,034 --> 01:45:02,332
- Oh my God.
He is so handsome.

1995
01:45:02,409 --> 01:45:03,467
You're bound to find him handsome.

1996
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,975
After all, his moustache is like mine.

1997
01:45:39,646 --> 01:45:41,273
Grandpa. - Hey beautiful.

1998
01:45:46,153 --> 01:45:47,552
Well done.

1999
01:45:49,156 --> 01:45:50,145
Come with me.

2000
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:56,392
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.

2001
01:45:56,763 --> 01:46:01,666
l've called you all here to celebrate..

2002
01:46:02,769 --> 01:46:04,896
..because my darling granddaughter Preet..

2003
01:46:08,475 --> 01:46:11,569
..has found her life partner.
Cheers.

2004
01:46:19,486 --> 01:46:20,475
Come.

2005
01:46:59,059 --> 01:47:11,062
My love, nothing precious of mine was broken.

2006
01:47:11,471 --> 01:47:21,676
My heart is what was broken, my love.

2007
01:47:24,317 --> 01:47:32,122
My heart is what was broken, my love.

2008
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:37,226
My tears just won't stop now.

2009
01:47:37,364 --> 01:47:40,856
Oh God, l'm as good as dead now.

2010
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:44,435
My tears just won't stop now.

2011
01:47:44,838 --> 01:47:48,365
Oh God, l'm as good as dead now.

2012
01:47:48,442 --> 01:47:52,242
Just tell me..

2013
01:47:52,946 --> 01:48:00,148
Who is responsible for this separation?

2014
01:48:00,253 --> 01:48:05,247
What did l do to deserve this?

2015
01:48:07,994 --> 01:48:16,060
Who is responsible for this separation?
- Dear..

2016
01:48:16,169 --> 01:48:18,467
What did l do to deserve this?

2017
01:48:19,473 --> 01:48:22,465
Dad, you can get me married to anyone you want.

2018
01:48:39,025 --> 01:48:42,620
Love feels like a punishment to me.

2019
01:48:42,829 --> 01:48:46,321
lt feels like an unfulfilled prayer.

2020
01:48:46,633 --> 01:48:50,330
Why do l deserve this anger?

2021
01:48:50,437 --> 01:48:55,374
My love is my God.

2022
01:48:57,778 --> 01:49:01,441
Love feels like a punishment to me.

2023
01:49:01,748 --> 01:49:05,149
lt feels like an unfulfilled prayer.

2024
01:49:05,452 --> 01:49:09,047
Why do l deserve this anger?

2025
01:49:09,356 --> 01:49:13,190
My love is my God.

2026
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:18,256
All l had asked for was my love.

2027
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:22,162
But l was covered in hues of separation.

2028
01:49:22,269 --> 01:49:25,534
All l had asked for was my love.

2029
01:49:25,906 --> 01:49:29,342
But l was covered in hues of separation.

2030
01:49:29,709 --> 01:49:32,906
What wrong did l do?

2031
01:49:35,315 --> 01:49:36,907
Hello, Simran..
- Yes, tell me.

2032
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,411
Kullu came over.

2033
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:43,722
l told him that you are in Punjab and are getting married.

2034
01:49:44,224 --> 01:49:45,919
And that he shouldn't trouble you anymore.

2035
01:49:46,026 --> 01:49:47,323
He didn't say anything else?

2036
01:49:47,427 --> 01:49:50,021
No. Okay then, l'm hanging up.

2037
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,763
Okay. Take care, babe.

2038
01:49:52,532 --> 01:49:54,227
Love you. Bye.

2039
01:49:55,368 --> 01:50:02,240
Who is responsible for this separation?

2040
01:50:02,576 --> 01:50:09,140
What did l do to deserve this?

2041
01:50:10,383 --> 01:50:17,585
Who is responsible for this separation?

2042
01:50:17,657 --> 01:50:24,460
What did l do to deserve this?

2043
01:50:36,209 --> 01:50:38,302
l never apologized to anyone.

2044
01:50:38,879 --> 01:50:40,471
But l'll apologize to you.

2045
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:43,515
You are facing a big problem in life because of me.

2046
01:50:44,184 --> 01:50:46,084
Forgive me, my friend.

2047
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,111
Brother, we'll have to stop her wedding.

2048
01:50:51,992 --> 01:50:56,088
No. She doesn't even want to talk to me.

2049
01:50:58,298 --> 01:51:00,027
Anyway, l don't deserve her.

2050
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:02,349
l don't deserve Kammo either.

2051
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:03,722
But we are together, right?

2052
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,431
l'm going.
- Where are you going?

2053
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:13,001
l don't know.

2054
01:51:13,446 --> 01:51:15,539
You are leaving after doing me a favor?

2055
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:21,917
l did it for my elder brother.

2056
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:26,158
l would've never done it as a favor.

2057
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:27,510
What do you think?

2058
01:51:27,536 --> 01:51:29,578
l can see my younger brother cry?

2059
01:51:30,563 --> 01:51:32,656
Anyway, you look good only when you smile, Kullu.

2060
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:39,961
Preet, find out from grandpa as..

2061
01:51:40,073 --> 01:51:42,064
..to where in Punjab is Simran getting married.

2062
01:51:46,513 --> 01:51:48,071
We are going to Punjab.

2063
01:51:55,488 --> 01:51:56,477
Happy..

2064
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,185
Order scrambled eggs for me, please.

2065
01:52:01,294 --> 01:52:02,488
Let's go to Punjab.

2066
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:05,296
Cheers!-Nice.
Nice. Nice.

2067
01:52:10,537 --> 01:52:16,498
Call her..

2068
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:18,334
These thorns are pricking me.

2069
01:52:18,511 --> 01:52:20,706
Brother, is this where Simran is getting married?

2070
01:52:21,414 --> 01:52:22,972
This is where she is getting married.

2071
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:25,447
But why are there many gunmen here?

2072
01:52:26,152 --> 01:52:29,849
l know, brother, my Simran must've worn a lot ofjeweller.

2073
01:52:30,457 --> 01:52:32,948
Don't worry. Today we'll kidnap her with all her gems and jewels.

2074
01:52:34,461 --> 01:52:36,554
l mean we'll take sister-in-law with us with all herjewellery.

2075
01:52:36,663 --> 01:52:38,062
Better.
- But how will we go inside?

2076
01:52:41,301 --> 01:52:42,598
Leave that to me.

2077
01:52:42,869 --> 01:52:44,564
Brother, from where did you take that out?

2078
01:52:44,671 --> 01:52:48,767
Hide it. lf Punjab police sees it then we'll be done for.

2079
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:50,866
The way you guys get scared you cannot..

2080
01:52:51,077 --> 01:52:53,409
..even halt a roadways bus by holding your hand up.

2081
01:52:53,513 --> 01:52:55,624
Brother, why do you worry.

2082
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:57,030
Leave it to me.

2083
01:52:57,083 --> 01:52:58,191
My name is Kullu for a reason.

2084
01:52:58,217 --> 01:52:59,483
We'll find a solution right away.

2085
01:52:59,519 --> 01:53:00,069
Come on, Happy.

2086
01:53:00,095 --> 01:53:01,011
So what's the solution?

2087
01:53:01,121 --> 01:53:03,385
Me? - l told you.

2088
01:53:03,490 --> 01:53:05,219
Yes. l found a solution.

2089
01:53:05,692 --> 01:53:07,319
They are playing nice songs inside.

2090
01:53:07,494 --> 01:53:09,587
We'll dance and go inside.

2091
01:53:09,829 --> 01:53:12,423
On English beats!

2092
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:15,497
True.
lt's Kullu's girlfriend's wedding.

2093
01:53:15,735 --> 01:53:17,001
lt won't look good if we dance.

2094
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:18,251
- Right. We don't look good.

2095
01:53:18,405 --> 01:53:19,702
Find another solution.

2096
01:53:20,106 --> 01:53:21,630
Please guide me to this address.

2097
01:53:23,343 --> 01:53:24,742
lt's this building's address!

2098
01:53:25,445 --> 01:53:26,565
Who ordered for it?

2099
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:28,064
- Some Simran, brother.

2100
01:53:28,148 --> 01:53:30,742
Say Mrs. Kullu.
Mrs. Kullu.

2101
01:53:30,984 --> 01:53:32,473
Oh my.
That sounded great.

2102
01:53:32,499 --> 01:53:34,274
Brother, please say it again.

2103
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:35,921
Once was fine as well.

01:53:35,947 --> 01:53:36,878
lt got the job done.

2105
01:53:38,691 --> 01:53:40,283
Mrs. Simran has ordered it?
- Yes.

2106
01:53:40,693 --> 01:53:43,161
Brother, l'll escort him inside.
- Go.

But don't leave anything behind.
- l won't.

2108
01:53:46,166 --> 01:53:48,157
But if by chance, they don't leave me..

2109
01:53:48,701 --> 01:53:50,293
..then please to come to save me.

2110
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:52,460
Fine. So what's your score?

2111
01:53:52,772 --> 01:53:55,673
l seek your blessings, dad.

2112
01:53:55,775 --> 01:53:58,266
Hi.-Hello, son.

2113
01:53:58,478 --> 01:54:00,878
May God bless you, my child.

2114
01:54:01,714 --> 01:54:04,212
Look over there.

2115
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:05,402
- Beautiful.

01:54:05,885 --> 01:54:08,012
He's so handsome. Have a look.

2117
01:54:08,888 --> 01:54:11,482
l said the decoration of this house is beautiful.

2118
01:54:11,524 --> 01:54:13,685
Yes. -l'm so happy today.

2119
01:54:13,793 --> 01:54:14,987
Harpal..
 - Yes, brother?

2120
01:54:15,095 --> 01:54:17,086
l've made all the arrangements for the wedding.

2121
01:54:17,497 --> 01:54:18,694
Do l need to do anything else?

2122
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,355
- No. Everything is going on just fine.

2123
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,361
He's Mr. Jarnail.

2124
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:22,684
My dear friend from Canada.

2125
01:54:22,836 --> 01:54:24,736
He's very nice.
- l seek your blessings, sir.

2126
01:54:24,938 --> 01:54:26,872
Bless you, son. Bless you.

2127
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:30,567
Harpal, he seems well cultured.
 - Yes.

2128
01:54:30,743 --> 01:54:32,123
He's very handsome, isn't he?

2129
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:33,862
- Mom, can l go now? Are you done?

2130
01:54:34,047 --> 01:54:35,639
l wanted to talk to you.
- Yes?

2131
01:54:35,748 --> 01:54:37,045
Come with me.
- Yes, sure.

2132
01:55:18,424 --> 01:55:19,618
What are you doing over here?

2133
01:55:19,726 --> 01:55:20,624
l was here to deliver this pizza.

2134
01:55:20,727 --> 01:55:21,718
l.. - Don't scream.

2135
01:55:21,744 --> 01:55:23,127
l'll tell you everything.

2136
01:55:23,163 --> 01:55:24,425
l don't want to hear anything.

2137
01:55:24,531 --> 01:55:26,123
Strange. You neither do you ever hear anything..

2138
01:55:26,232 --> 01:55:27,426
..nor do you wear anything.

2139
01:55:27,534 --> 01:55:29,331
You should at least be considerate about this being lndia.

2140
01:55:29,369 --> 01:55:30,666
Wear this.

2141
01:55:31,538 --> 01:55:34,166
A mosquito might bite you.
- Back off!

2142
01:55:34,474 --> 01:55:35,964
You've done what you had to do with me.

2143
01:55:36,075 --> 01:55:36,973
Now get lost!

2144
01:55:37,076 --> 01:55:38,771
Look.. - Dad!
- Dad, please don't come here.

2145
01:55:38,878 --> 01:55:40,408
At least listen to me for a moment.

2146
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:41,701
Whatever you saw was a lie.

2147
01:55:41,848 --> 01:55:43,748
l'm not getting married to anyone.

2148
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:46,350
Mom! - Mom! Mom is here.

2149
01:55:46,753 --> 01:55:48,058
What happened, Simran?

2150
01:55:48,084 --> 01:55:49,269
- Dharmendra, you?

2151
01:55:49,355 --> 01:55:50,487
Grandpa, you too are here?

2152
01:55:50,513 --> 01:55:51,905
Now it's not going to go well.

2153
01:55:52,091 --> 01:55:54,082
He's not Dharmendra, he's Kullu.

2154
01:55:54,194 --> 01:55:57,755
Kullu? The same boy you wanted us to meet?
- Yes.

2155
01:55:58,097 --> 01:56:01,191
No. He is Preet's fiance. - Fiance!

2156
01:56:04,871 --> 01:56:06,668
My child. - Control.

2157
01:56:06,773 --> 01:56:09,173
You girls start crying at the drop of a hat.

2158
01:56:13,379 --> 01:56:15,176
Okay. l got it.

2159
01:56:15,281 --> 01:56:17,246
You are very dedicated.

2160
01:56:17,272 --> 01:56:19,980
You've come here on a mission.

2161
01:56:20,019 --> 01:56:22,180
l mean undercover cop.

2162
01:56:22,222 --> 01:56:23,174
He isn't a cop.

2163
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,977
He's a pizza delivery boy.

2164
01:56:25,058 --> 01:56:26,650
He's a pizza delivery boy!

2165
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,820
Yes, dear.
He's a pizza delivery boy.

2166
01:56:32,966 --> 01:56:35,730
Everyone here is going crazy and you are winking at me!

2167
01:56:35,768 --> 01:56:37,938
Okay, so l am Preet's fiance?

2168
01:56:37,964 --> 01:56:39,160
-Yes, l agree.

2169
01:56:39,339 --> 01:56:40,966
l'm not Dharmendra.
l'm Kullu.

2170
01:56:41,074 --> 01:56:42,166
l don't agree to that.

2171
01:56:43,076 --> 01:56:45,340
l caught a gangster and brought him to your house.

2172
01:56:45,378 --> 01:56:47,938
l agree. - Preet loves him.

2173
01:56:47,981 --> 01:56:49,744
l don't agree to that.

2174
01:56:49,849 --> 01:56:51,146
Nobody is listening to me.

2175
01:56:51,251 --> 01:56:53,048
Everybody is just saying what they like.

2176
01:56:54,954 --> 01:56:56,683
This happened when..

2177
01:57:05,565 --> 01:57:06,862
Hey, are you guys trying to eavesdrop?

2178
01:57:06,966 --> 01:57:07,898
Come down and listen.

2179
01:57:07,967 --> 01:57:09,958
l'll place chairs for you guys to sit on.

2180
01:57:13,806 --> 01:57:15,205
Mom, give me the hand-fan.

2181
01:57:19,412 --> 01:57:20,585
Do you know the story?

2182
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:21,837
Then you guys say it.

2183
01:57:22,382 --> 01:57:23,406
Go and do your work.

2184
01:57:24,017 --> 01:57:25,006
And then..

2185
01:57:34,527 --> 01:57:38,361
And after that we came to lndia.

2186
01:57:40,767 --> 01:57:42,632
Dear, you are very luck.

2187
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:46,231
You've got Kullu who truly loves you.

2188
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:49,830
Kullu..

2189
01:57:52,078 --> 01:57:53,340
Bless you, son.

2190
01:57:54,947 --> 01:57:57,347
Grandpa, where's her father?

2191
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:59,848
He's tallying some accounts outside.

2192
01:58:00,453 --> 01:58:02,148
That means l'll have to say this story again?

2193
01:58:02,188 --> 01:58:04,656
No, son.
l'll tell him the story.

2194
01:58:04,891 --> 01:58:06,859
Anyway what does one need to do while telling a story?

2195
01:58:06,959 --> 01:58:08,157
Look here. Look there.

2196
01:58:08,183 --> 01:58:08,781
Look here.

2197
01:58:08,861 --> 01:58:11,159
Then interval, emotion and end.

2198
01:58:11,397 --> 01:58:12,659
l'll be right back.

2199
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:17,998
Grandpa!

2200
01:58:18,104 --> 01:58:22,700
Preet, you still don't know your grandpa well enough.

2201
01:58:23,343 --> 01:58:24,139
What do you mean?

2202
01:58:24,243 --> 01:58:27,303
You don't love Kullu, you love Goli.

2203
01:58:29,749 --> 01:58:34,209
Dear, l'll marry you to the one you love.

2204
01:58:36,522 --> 01:58:39,923
Happy, Kullu seems to have left for Manali.

2205
01:58:40,526 --> 01:58:42,323
Brother, l suggest we should go inside and check.

2206
01:58:42,428 --> 01:58:43,520
He's kept us hanging here.

2207
01:58:43,563 --> 01:58:44,928
Who knows he must be hanging inside!

2208
01:58:49,235 --> 01:58:50,224
Preet?

2209
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:53,388
Preet.
- Oh, my Goli!

2210
01:58:53,414 --> 01:58:54,661
How are you?

2211
01:58:54,874 --> 01:58:57,468
Listen, grandpajust called me.

2212
01:58:57,944 --> 01:58:59,741
You seemed to have set everything straight.

2213
01:58:59,879 --> 01:59:01,131
What have you done?

2214
01:59:01,157 --> 01:59:03,067
He wants me to get married.

2215
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:06,142
To you.
- Oh really?

2216
01:59:07,587 --> 01:59:09,819
Then make preparations, my girl.

2217
01:59:09,845 --> 01:59:11,309
l'm coming for you.

2218
01:59:12,892 --> 01:59:13,984
See you later, baby.

2219
01:59:17,196 --> 01:59:18,760
What happened, brother?

2220
01:59:18,786 --> 01:59:20,486
- Everything's settled.

2221
01:59:21,367 --> 01:59:24,495
All the problems have been solved.
- Great.

2222
01:59:26,839 --> 01:59:28,329
25 plus 25 equals to 50.

2223
01:59:28,441 --> 01:59:30,102
50 times 50 equals to 2500!

2224
01:59:30,143 --> 01:59:32,304
Harpal, stop your calculation.

2225
01:59:32,345 --> 01:59:33,903
There's a twist in your story.

2226
01:59:34,046 --> 01:59:36,708
Brother, though l know everything but what's the story.

2227
01:59:37,817 --> 01:59:41,048
Simran cannot get married to Shamsher.

2228
01:59:41,454 --> 01:59:42,513
What kind of a story is this?

2229
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:43,743
l don't know anything about it.

2230
01:59:43,823 --> 01:59:45,689
l'll tell this story to you later.

2231
01:59:45,715 --> 01:59:47,579
First let me correct the script.

2232
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,424
Okay.
- This happened when..

2233
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:53,764
lt happened when..

2234
01:59:54,667 --> 01:59:56,726
But brother, what's the story!

2235
01:59:56,836 --> 02:00:00,533
Shamsher..
- Grandpa. l seek your blessings.

2236
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,068
l seek your blessings. - Son..

2237
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:04,632
Yes?
- You are an educated and a smart boy.

2238
02:00:05,778 --> 02:00:09,475
Actually, Simran loves someone else.

2239
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:13,651
She cannot get married to you.

Grandpa, this is no longer about love.

2261
02:00:22,161 --> 02:00:24,095
Now it is the question of my honor.

2262
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:27,961
Young man, don't make a mistake.

2263
02:00:28,701 --> 02:00:31,363
Now it is also the question of my honor.

2284
02:00:35,975 --> 02:00:39,968
Brother Shamsher, our men have seen Goli in our city.

2285
02:00:40,379 --> 02:00:41,971
Goli is in our city?
- Yes.

2286
02:00:42,515 --> 02:00:43,441
Do one thing.

2287
02:00:43,467 --> 02:00:46,101
Make our men surround this mansion.

2288
02:00:46,686 --> 02:00:49,678
Simran will get married only to me.

2289
02:00:49,822 --> 02:00:51,041
That too today itself.

2290
02:00:51,067 --> 02:00:52,839
Otherwise, l'll kill everyone.

2291
02:00:54,727 --> 02:00:57,787
Oh my. You're wearing full clothes today. Wonderful.
- Kullu..

2292
02:00:58,598 --> 02:00:59,587
l'm so sorry.

2293
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:03,931
l didn't even give you a chance to prove yourself right.

2294
02:01:04,003 --> 02:01:04,542
lt's okay.

2295
02:01:04,568 --> 02:01:06,724
lt's a big thing that you accept your mistake.

2296
02:01:06,839 --> 02:01:07,828
lt's not a small thing.

2297
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:09,999
Girls never accept their mistake.
Right, aunt?

2298
02:01:27,593 --> 02:01:29,356
There's nothing to worry about.

2299
02:01:30,062 --> 02:01:31,962
Just give me your blessings.

2300
02:02:05,197 --> 02:02:06,789
My mother used to say..

2301
02:02:06,999 --> 02:02:08,990
What was it that your mother used to say?

2302
02:02:09,235 --> 02:02:13,797
Kullu, you are destined to kill someone.

2303
02:02:33,059 --> 02:02:34,083
Wait, you..

2304
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:42,258
Wait, you..

2305
02:02:47,607 --> 02:02:48,596
Catch him!

2306
02:03:09,228 --> 02:03:10,217
Kullu!

2307
02:03:16,535 --> 02:03:18,594
Now try hitting them, you scoundrel.

2308
02:03:25,077 --> 02:03:26,066
Kullu!

2309
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,069
Leave me!

2310
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:32,339
Kullu!

2311
02:03:36,489 --> 02:03:38,150
Kullu!
- Why don't you hit them now?

2312
02:03:50,069 --> 02:03:51,058
Kullu!

2313
02:04:00,112 --> 02:04:01,101
Kullu..

2314
02:04:17,496 --> 02:04:19,191
With one it's a fight.

2315
02:04:20,599 --> 02:04:22,089
With two, it's fun.

2316
02:04:38,751 --> 02:04:40,184
Three's company.

2317
02:04:40,686 --> 02:04:44,452
With four, it's an army.

2318
02:04:44,957 --> 02:04:48,358
And an army means a mess.

2319
02:05:31,771 --> 02:05:33,068
Very good. Very good, brother.

2320
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:34,536
But what's the story?

2321
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,632
This happened when..

2322
02:05:38,344 --> 02:05:39,538
You ostrich!

2323
02:05:40,946 --> 02:05:43,039
When did this happen?!

2324
02:06:35,935 --> 02:06:39,336
Goli, your presence reminds me of a poem.

2325
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,537
The one l looked for everywhere..

2326
02:06:43,242 --> 02:06:45,267
The one l looked for everywhere..

2327
02:06:45,544 --> 02:06:47,171
l found her in my backyard.

2328
02:06:50,082 --> 02:06:53,051
Hey, Hindi dialogues in a Punjabi movie!

2329
02:06:53,352 --> 02:06:55,684
Mr. Shamsher, you deserve it.

2330
02:06:56,055 --> 02:06:58,751
Ask me what?
- What?

2331
02:06:59,191 --> 02:07:00,556
To get thrashed.

2332
02:07:00,593 --> 02:07:04,962
Brother, give him a few slaps and bring him to the courtyard.

2333
02:07:05,164 --> 02:07:07,997
We'll make him twirl.

2334
02:07:11,103 --> 02:07:12,365
Come on, son.

2335
02:07:15,374 --> 02:07:16,206
Come on, you scoundrel.

2336
02:07:16,232 --> 02:07:16,991
Teach him a lesson.

2337
02:07:19,378 --> 02:07:21,812
Come on. Come on. - No.. - Hit him.

2338
02:07:27,052 --> 02:07:29,350
Beat him. Hit him.

2339
02:07:31,624 --> 02:07:33,023
l'm done for.

2340
02:07:33,826 --> 02:07:34,815
Come on.

2341
02:07:35,527 --> 02:07:39,224
lnspector, arrest him.
- Handcuff him.

2342
02:07:39,932 --> 02:07:41,263
Thank you, Mr. Jarnail Singh.

2343
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:45,467
He used to always commit a crime and
destroy all evidences against him.

2344
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:48,735
But today, thanks to you, we caught him red-handed.

2345
02:07:49,275 --> 02:07:50,242
Come on! Let's go.

2346
02:07:50,342 --> 02:07:53,641
Scoundrels, l'll go in and come out in ajiffy.

2347
02:07:53,879 --> 02:07:56,746
lf you try to shut down my drugs business then..

2348
02:07:56,782 --> 02:07:57,231
Come with us!

2349
02:07:57,257 --> 02:07:58,672
- Brother, just a minute. Just a minute.

2350
02:07:58,751 --> 02:07:59,945
Just a minute.

2351
02:08:00,052 --> 02:08:01,952
Mr. Shamsher Singh, please come here.
- Let go.

2352
02:08:02,154 --> 02:08:03,883
My brother wanted to talk to you.

2353
02:08:03,956 --> 02:08:05,355
Yes, brother. Talk to him.
- You scoundrel..

2354
02:08:05,491 --> 02:08:07,857
..you've lost everything and yet you are arrogant.

2355
02:08:08,861 --> 02:08:09,733
Come on, you scoundrel.

2356
02:08:09,759 --> 02:08:10,453
Come on. Come on.

2357
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,187
Take him away.

2358
02:08:11,213 --> 02:08:12,353
- Put him in the jeep.

2359
02:08:12,379 --> 02:08:13,310
Come on.
Come on.

2360
02:08:13,465 --> 02:08:15,194
Grandpa.. - God bless you, my son.

2361
02:08:15,301 --> 02:08:16,768
Come on.
- l seek your blessings, grandpa.

2362
02:08:19,905 --> 02:08:21,202
Come give me a hug, my boy!

2363
02:08:24,343 --> 02:08:28,006
Harpal, though you know everything..

2364
02:08:28,314 --> 02:08:30,248
..but you don't know anything about this story.

2365
02:08:30,316 --> 02:08:32,841
But Jarnail, now l've understood everything.

2366
02:08:33,519 --> 02:08:34,242
Go meet her.

2367
02:08:34,268 --> 02:08:35,171
She's waiting.

2368
02:08:38,924 --> 02:08:41,654
Best of luck.
- Thank you.

2369
02:08:43,228 --> 02:08:45,025

Best of luck.

2371
02:08:49,257 --> 02:08:50,960
Best of luck. Best of luck.

2372
02:08:55,074 --> 02:08:56,939
Kullu, you fight well.

2373
02:08:57,276 --> 02:09:01,940
l make sure that l do when there is a beautiful girl standing before me.

2374
02:09:02,047 --> 02:09:03,878
Whether or not the other person gets hurt..

2375
02:09:03,949 --> 02:09:06,042
..but the fight should look good.

2376
02:09:06,285 --> 02:09:08,879
Kullu, listen, we'll leave for our honeymoon day after tomorrow.

2377
02:09:09,154 --> 02:09:12,055
Quickly call a travel agent to book the tickets.

2378
02:09:12,391 --> 02:09:15,792
Oh yes, don't take me to your basement after go back to Canada.

2379
02:09:15,961 --> 02:09:18,361
Quickly contact a property dealer.

2380
02:09:18,464 --> 02:09:21,900
One more thing. lndia's water doesn't suit me at all.

2381
02:09:22,067 --> 02:09:24,627
Find out if Evian mineral water is available here. Okay?

2382
02:09:24,803 --> 02:09:27,499
Don't worry if you don't find it here. Okay?

2383
02:09:27,639 --> 02:09:28,969
Get it couriered from Canada.

2384
02:09:28,995 --> 02:09:30,462
lt will be here in three days.

2385
02:09:32,211 --> 02:09:34,304
Until then l'll survive on your blood.

2386
