said that they had not answered any calls since two days.

there I was shocked to see Likitha‘s dead.

He got two crores in cricket betting

368
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
If Asked

369
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
Expected to give, not given

370
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,560
If knocked, expected to give, but not given

371
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,160
That’s why I killed him

372
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,520
Money is money, if not today, it can be earned tomorrow

373
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,640
But, he !

374
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,400
Will not come

375
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,240
Hey ! (Angry)

376
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,040
Very easy to kill

377
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:01,840
That's

378
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,560
It takes a lot of courage to kill the friends

379
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,120
With Dare I killed both of them

380
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,720
Dare to do the same and kill you too

381
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,440
You got the police call and you are missed

382
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,840
I sent it to the bookie again, You Missed

383
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,040
I also sent it to MLA

384
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,560
Missed there too

385
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,520
You sent me to the bookie and MLA?

386
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,160
Sujit getting a message from a bookie number on his phone?

387
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,800
Receiving a call from an unknown number my mobile?

388
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,880
What does that mean you send it?

389
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,920
Before killing Sujit, I registered my fingerprint on his mobile

390
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,040
That you should not doubt

391
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,240
Open my contacts in his Contacts

392
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,080
In the place where my name is, I saved the bookie name

393
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,400
Technology is very simple

394
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,080
Used by one way or another

395
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
I use it in my style

396
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,720
[Panting]

397
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,600
[Panting]

398
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
One hundred one.. !
