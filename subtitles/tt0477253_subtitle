1
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:46,765
Through his paintings, an artist
conveys his feelings to the patrons.

2
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,549
The professor will die of shock if
you ever turn up on time someday.

3
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:41,484
Stop it, okay? I don't have a
battalion of servants like you.

4
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,280
I live all alone and I've got
to do everything on my own.

5
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:47,355
Just chill. It isn't
easy for me either.

6
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,822
It obviously is.

7
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,294
You live comfortably in a house
your father has given you.

8
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,828
Like you live in your Mom's house.

9
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,632
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

10
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,772
Did you talk to your dad?
- How could I?

11
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,513
I did phone him, but, as usual...

12
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:16,645
...it was the answering machine. He
was talking business with someone.

13
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,493
You know, Karan...? Sometimes,
I really miss...

14
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:30,330
I wish Mom were alive. It's
different in your case.

15
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,803
You have a family. If dad's busy,
you can always have a word with Mom.

16
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,405
But my family...

17
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,342
Sneha, what family talk
are we going on with?

18
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,347
By the way, what are
you doing tomorrow?

19
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,679
What's special about tomorrow?
- It's a weekend.

20
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,552
I'm doing nothing much.
I'll be at home.

21
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:58,623
I could turn your very exciting plan
into something boring, if you wish?

22
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:02,965
There's a party at
my Uncle's tomorrow.

23
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,367
All my relatives will be there.

24
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,830
If you come with me, I could
introduce you to everyone.

25
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,843
And all your ghosts of the
family will be exorcised.

26
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,442
How about it?
- Sure.

27
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:30,924
Karan, no one can guess that you
come from such a rich family.

28
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,862
Oh yes, that's how I look.

29
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,397
But once you meet the
caricatures here...

30
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:38,596
...you'll be convinced
I'm not one of them.

31
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,469
Come, let me introduce
you to some of them.

32
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,410
As I promised, the folks I
introduce you to at the party...

33
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,414
...will be exclusive. Very exclusive

34
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,952
Hello, lovely lady. It's
so good to see you.

35
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:58,489
I'm Amar Rathod.
- Uncle Amar, this is Sneha.

36
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,818
If could stop glaring... I happen
to be your nephew. Karan.

37
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,855
Excuse me. Karan. It's
good to see you.

38
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,423
I'm delighted to have you here...

39
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,435
...and even more delighted
to see that...

40
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,768
...you've brought such
a lovely lady along.

41
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,501
Thank you very much.
- Go and have a good time.

42
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,907
Have some champagne. It's
very good. Karan, enjoy yourself.

43
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:21,713
Come. - Well, Karan... Vicky's here.

44
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:27,445
Vicky...?
- Vicky? Who's Vicky?

45
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,520
Let's go.
- How're you.

46
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,918
Hi Karan. How are you?

47
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,457
Wow. You're looking so handsome.

48
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:44,470
Guess what? I just met Vicky. He
looked so handsome and dashing...

49
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,734
I'm telling you, if I
had two daughters...

50
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,641
I'd have gotten them married to
the two of you at the same altar.

51
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,608
Isn't that a great idea?
- May I go and see Vicky?

52
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:58,674
Please. Carry on, enjoy yourself
like I'm enjoying.

53
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,476
Bye. See you later.

54
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:06,491
Karan, is your aunt always so loud?

55
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,550
She's louder sometimes.

56
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,826
As I told you, we have a number
of caricatures in the family.

57
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,094
Now you'll get to see more...
- But who's this Vicky?

58
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,992
A childhood friend. Lives in Delhi.
I don't know what he's doing here.

59
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,500
Fantastic, man. Yeah.

60
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,500
What are you giggling away for?
- Brother Karan. How're you?

61
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,103
I'm okay. Vicky just told us a joke.

62
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:32,050
I think you should hear this
one. Is she with you? - Of course.

63
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,516
I'm sorry.

64
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:41,025
Hi handsome. Recognise me?
- Why not?

65
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,721
Uncle Kapadia's daughter Chandni.
- Exactly.

66
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:49,193
Sneha, this is Chandni. And
this is... - Girlfriend...?

67
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,866
Friends.
- Friends, I see.

68
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,534
I happened to meet another
of your friends just now.

69
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,543
Let me guess. Vicky?

70
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,813
What a charming man he is.

71
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,543
That's it, Karan. I want
to meet Vicky. Now.

72
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:14,021
Life is for fun.

73
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:17,620
Romance is here, now, this moment.

74
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,587
Life is for fun.

75
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:48,184
Romance is here, now, this moment.

76
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:51,697
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

77
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,927
...if not for me, there's nothing.

78
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:58,726
Life is for fun.

79
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:02,206
Romance is here, now, this moment.

80
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:06,076
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

81
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,603
...if not for me, there's nothing.

82
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,810
Life is for fun.

83
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,286
Romance is here, now, this moment.

84
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,905
I admit, I wear my heart
on my sleeve...

85
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,965
...but I still like the way I am.

86
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:44,040
In the path of romance,
I flaunt my heart.

87
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,646
This lovely Spring, I wait
for my sweetheart...

88
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,713
...come to me, O pretty one, why
do you stand far away from me?

89
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:55,123
Life is for fun.

90
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:58,651
Romance is here, now, this moment.

91
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,660
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

92
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,795
...if not for me, there's nothing.

93
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:09,330
Life is for fun.

94
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,867
Romance is here, now, this moment.

95
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:33,357
Roving eyes, a smile on my lips...

96
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:40,365
My love is lovelier
than love itself.

97
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,767
It's time for romance,
for young hearts...

98
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:48,244
I'm in a daze ever
since I've seen you.

99
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:51,714
Life is for fun.

100
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,112
Romance is here, now, this moment.

101
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,983
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

102
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,391
...if not for me, there's nothing.

103
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,925
Life is for fun.

104
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:09,263
Romance is here, now, this moment.

105
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,074
Desires awaken in my heart...

106
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:30,748
A spell is being
cast at this party.

107
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:37,089
How am I to stop myself...?
My heart faces a dilemma.

108
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,363
A fire in my belly, a desire,
a storm in my heart...

109
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,766
Live it up this moment for
it won't last forever.

110
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:48,100
Life is for fun.

111
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:51,769
Romance is here, now, this moment.

112
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,778
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

113
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:58,942
...if not for me, there's nothing.

114
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,317
Life is for fun.

115
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,983
Romance is here, now, this moment.

116
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:09,789
The party's rocking
because I'm here...

117
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,931
...if not for me, there's nothing.

118
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,125
Romance.

119
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:36,815
Whom are you out to kill?
- You

120
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:42,821
How mean. I get nice coffee for
you and you want to kill me...?

121
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:49,430
If the coffee isn't good.
- It's good.

122
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,103
Less milk, less sugar
and lots of coffee.

123
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:58,007
Absolutely power-packed. - How did
you know I like strong coffee?

124
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:00,844
We have similar tastes.

125
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,911
Actually, it's Ramu-kaka
who has made this coffee.

126
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,848
He's the one you share
your tastes with.

127
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:11,014
Your face is also like his.
- Stop being mean.

128
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:17,321
No kidding. Want me to call him
here? Ramu-kaka... Ramu-kaka...

129
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:21,030
Shall we leave?
- Ramu-kaka.

130
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,192
What happened?

131
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,463
Shall we leave?
- Sure.

132
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,876
Where do you think you're going?
- Mumbai.

133
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:37,206
Mumbai? - I've got an
admission in your college.

134
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:39,217
Thought I'd go with you.

135
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,880
That's great.
- I've got to rush home, Vicky.

136
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,280
Before my folks wake up.

137
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,219
If they wake up I'll have to
put up with their lectures...

138
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,225
...for half an hour.
- I'll be back in ten minutes.

139
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,420
You're not getting out of that
bathroom before half an hour.

140
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,963
It's only for ten minutes.
- Right. Ten minutes.

141
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,226
Ten minutes.

142
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,073
Bye, bye, see you.

143
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:07,310
Uncle, bye. - Vicky is leaving.
- So early in the morning?

144
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,108
Aunty, look for a girl
for me. - Yes, sure.

145
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:12,173
There you are. Doesn't it look like
I've been visiting his place?

146
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:16,381
Let's go. Bye

147
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,981
What's up, Vicky? You came
out pretty quick today?

148
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:29,266
When Karan saw the cop,
he took to his heels.

149
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,460
Instead of running away...

150
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,937
...he ran in the direction
of the cop. In slow motion.

151
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:36,936
You ought to have seen their faces.

152
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:38,935
There was a bottle
in Karan's hand...

153
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,944
...and the cop wielded the baton.

154
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:44,008
And this friend of mine didn't
even come to save me.

155
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,209
He behaved as if I were a stranger.
- Obviously.

156
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:49,151
Mummy told me to always stay away
from people who did bad things.

157
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,347
Really? As if you weren't drinking?
- But you were one who got caught

158
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:56,155
Sneha, that cop took two thousand
bucks from this guy.

159
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:00,426
Karan, I didn't know
you were a drinker.

160
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:05,069
But I'm not a drinker. That
was the only time I drank.

161
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,967
You got caught the first time.

162
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,171
Nobody's seen good times with you.
So how could I be an exception?

163
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:12,043
He was the one who made the mistakes
and I got hauled up for them.

164
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,387
Hello Vicky...? Gullu here.

165
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,991
Vicky, the bathroom...?

166
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,393
One second, one second.
Over there... yes, Gullu?

167
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,161
How did you find the house?
- It's superb, Gullu. Thanks.

168
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,066
You don't have to thank me.
- If it wasn't for you...

169
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:44,008
Forget it, Vicky. - Have you
given the numbers to James?

170
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,267
Yes, I've spoken to James. No sweat.

171
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:47,607
He'll arrange the
exhibition for you.

172
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,609
But Vicky, that packet
got left in your bag.

173
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,347
Don't tell me. In my bag...?

174
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,547
Yes. Just check, will you?
See if its there.

175
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,351
One second. Hold on.

176
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,527
Yes, it's here. - You got it?
Keep it with you carefully.

177
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:11,035
When I come to Mumbai, I'll
collect it from you.

178
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,034
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

179
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,700
Whose call was it?
- A friend of mine.

180
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,234
He's the one who got me this house
and is also arranging my exhibition.

181
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:26,249
Exhibition...? Let me take a photo
of the future M.F. Hussain.

182
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:28,047
Sure.
- Don't flatter him so much.

183
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,054
He'll start going around
bare-feet from tomorrow.

184
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,190
Let my exhibition turn
out to be a hit...

185
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:35,125
...what's bare-feet...?
I'll bare everything.

186
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,058
Let's take a photo for that.
- Sure.

187
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:49,267
Cheese.

188
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,101
Attention, please.

189
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,697
The Principal has something
to say to you.

190
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,101
Students, as you might
already know...

191
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,576
...we have the fund-raising fair
for our college next week.

192
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,373
You will all be given stalls
to display your talents.

193
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,648
Collect the forms from the office
counter. So all the best.

194
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,386
Thank you, Mrs. Gupta.
- Thank you.

195
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,190
Good morning, class. Nice
to see you on time, Sneha.

196
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:47,661
As you know, in the creative
interpretation session...

197
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,531
...we will get to know about
your skills to...

198
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,530
You...? Are you a newcomer
in the class?

199
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,137
Yes, ma'am. Vikram Mathur.

200
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,675
So let's begin with you.
What's your subject?

201
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,341
Painting, ma'am.

202
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,476
Aha. Will you tell the class
about your paintings...?

203
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:09,418
Why did you choose it?
- Sure, ma'am.

204
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,152
I believe that whether
it's the Mona Lisa...

205
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:18,560
...or the banner of a film,
both have...

206
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:27,163
What's happening, Vikram?
- She's tickling me, ma'am.

207
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,569
I'm doing nothing, ma'am.
- Sneha, behave yourself

208
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,502
Stop it, will you? Sorry, ma'am

209
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:39,175
As I said, Mona Lisa
is a great painting.

210
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,512
Mona Lisa has a couple of huge...
- Vikram.

211
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:51,390
She's tickling me, ma'am.
- I've done nothing.

212
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,725
Sneha, leave the class.
- But, ma'am...

213
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,357
Don't argue. Just leave.

214
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:03,468
Out.

215
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,601
Yes, Vikram?

216
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:15,213
Third time. As I was saying, Mona
Lisa had a couple of big...

217
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,552
Are you out of your mind,
Vikram? What is it now?

218
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:25,226
He's tickling me, ma'am.

219
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,763
I mean, she's tickling me.

220
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:36,230
Looks like the whole class
wants to tickle you today.

221
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:40,308
So it'll be better if
you leave. Get out.

222
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,772
Get out, Vikram

223
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,248
Sneha. Sneha. Sneha.

224
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,651
Vicky, it's okay.
- Okay...?

225
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,253
Why okay? Say thank you.
- Are you in your senses?

226
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,259
Absolutely. My brains are
in top working condition.

227
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,265
Ma'am threw me out of the
class because of you...

228
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,858
...and you want me to thank you?
- What else?

229
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,665
I rescued you from a boring lecture.

230
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,272
Now please don't tell me that...

231
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,274
...ma'am's boring lecture
is better than my company.

232
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,443
Yes, it's better.
- One moment, one moment.

233
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:17,879
I know, you're angry right now. But
I also know you love my company.

234
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,680
What? Stop living in
a dream world.

235
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,555
Okay, forgive me, please.
- Now you're talking.

236
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,285
Give me a chance to make amends.

237
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,289
I want to buy you a cup of coffee.
- Not again.

238
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:35,493
Okay. First a movie, then coffee.
- Vicky, you aren't as smart...

239
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,832
...as you think you are. That's a
nice excuse to take a girl out.

240
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:41,499
But it's beaten to death.
Better luck next time.

241
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:57,478
Let's go. It's time for the show.

242
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:00,653
This ploy always works.

243
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:06,323
You're absolutely crazy. - Exactly
why I'm going around with you.

244
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:14,802
My dad Major Satish Mathur was
a stickler for punctuality.

245
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:17,865
What'll you have? Ramu-kaka's
favourite? - Coffee.

246
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:36,358
As I telling you, Major Satish
Mathur was a very nice man.

247
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:41,358
He has a very big house in Delhi.
It fetches a handsome rent.

248
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:45,362
It's all fun.
- Sir...

249
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,961
...will you please put
out the cigarette?

250
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,768
I have an allergy to smoke.

251
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,441
Sit at another table. By the way,
this is not a cigarette.

252
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,879
It's a cigar. When it's over, there
will be no smoke. So simple.

253
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,719
What is she getting so upset for?
- Sorry.

254
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:04,713
The children of nowadays.

255
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,882
They are always trying
to prove something.

256
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,391
Want some cream with the coffee?

257
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:26,409
Please put out the cigar, sir.
It's making her cough.

258
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,537
Didn't you understand when
I told you once, kiddo?

259
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:42,819
No smoke.

260
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,056
Hello Karan. - Hey Sneha.

261
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,994
I'm in a movie,
I'll call you back, Karan.

262
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:21,459
I'm sorry.

263
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,471
Get that car out of the way.

264
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:43,480
Amazing traffic in this
city. It's so hot.

265
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:53,090
But I had a great time today, Sneha.
I've never had a day like this.

266
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,964
And...

267
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:02,503
And India's won the
match by 3 wickets.

268
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:05,504
Mine's a running commentary,
isn't it?

269
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,508
What?
- Yes.

270
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,176
I've been talking away and you're
immersed in thoughts. What's up?

271
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:20,120
You know, I need to take a leak.
I want to go to the bathroom.

272
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:24,193
Since when...?
- Half an hour.

273
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:30,526
Vicky, stop laughing.

274
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:37,535
Madam, you can't find a toilet
around for at least half an hour.

275
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:42,878
Listen, I can't wait for that long.
Vicky, do something please.

276
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,812
What now...?
- Nothing. Sometimes...

277
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,018
Hiccups?
- No... yes.

278
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:59,086
Water?
- Water. Are you mad?

279
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,562
I need to go to the bathroom and
you're offering me water?

280
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,629
Vicky, please do something.

281
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,574
You're the one who's
got to do it, Sneha.

282
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:15,572
Okay, I'll look the other
way. Do it right here.

283
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,575
Vicky. You're sick.

284
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:20,911
Although you are the photographer...

285
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:24,749
I'm dying to photograph you
in this condition of yours.

286
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,187
Vicky. Do something.
- Sneha, do something.

287
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:35,758
All right, I'm not very experienced
but I'll try and help you.

288
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,069
All right. Get out of the car.

289
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:50,878
Get out of the car, Vicky?
I can't even move.

290
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,216
If I as much as budge...
- C'mon.

291
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,641
Open it.

292
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,643
Shut up and go to the bathroom.

293
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:29,653
Thanks.

294
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,659
Vicky, my house is here.

295
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:48,997
What are you thinking about?

296
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:52,676
If we hadn't found that
make-up van today...

297
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,271
I could've blackmailed
you all my life.

298
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,150
Vicky, you're mean.

299
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,027
Thanks.

300
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,704
Good night.

301
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:31,045
Vicky, you don't lose any
opportunity, do you?

302
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:35,777
Why must you look surprised?
I've heard enough tales about you.

303
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,049
It must be Karan.

304
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:44,318
No. I saw it for myself at the party.
You just wouldn't let Chandni go.

305
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,061
One moment, one moment.

306
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,733
Which means someone was watching me?

307
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,754
You're like the girls.
- What?

308
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:22,089
Can you ever keep a secret? You
tattled to Sneha about me.

309
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,927
Whatever I told her must've
been the truth.

310
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,101
As if she's your girlfriend. Why
must you tell her everything?

311
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:33,776
No girlfriend, but she's a friend.
- Friend, eh?

312
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,771
You're not trying to woo
her as a friend, are you?

313
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,109
Don't even get those ideas.
She's a very nice girl.

314
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:44,980
When did I say she's a bad girl?

315
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,861
Sure nothing's cooking between you?
- No.

316
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:54,788
Think again.
- I told you, there isn't.

317
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:01,268
All right. - Doesn't mean
you can start something.

318
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:06,968
I don't start anything. Whatever has
to happen, will happen on its own.

319
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:11,011
Nothing's happening.
I know her very well.

320
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,309
Really?

321
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:17,821
I see.

322
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,095
She's a very good girl. You'd
better stay away from her.

323
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,224
Suppose I don't?

324
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:44,176
Hey Sneha.

325
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,383
Hi. You had me scared.

326
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:48,851
I need to tell you something.

327
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,854
Tell me.
- Promise me that...

328
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,516
...you won't lie.

329
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:59,454
I mean, don't think how I'll
take it or what I'll think.

330
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:03,859
I mean... just tell me honestly.

331
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,402
Will you ask me?

332
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:09,400
Sure. I've written something,
I'll read it out.

333
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,878
I shall give up my life
for a smile of yours.

334
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:18,475
All I possess mean nothing
before your smile.

335
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,879
The tears in your eyes,
all your sorrows...

336
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,547
...will them to me. My love...

337
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:26,890
...come to me, come closer.

338
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,883
Honestly, I shall be with you...

339
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:34,057
...in hard times. I shall
endure everything.

340
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:37,901
The roads, the distances,
hear them say that...

341
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:43,167
I shall be with you. Always.

342
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,238
How is it?

343
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:51,914
Nonsense, isn't it?

344
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:56,417
I knew it. Just wanted
to confirm with you.

345
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,422
Not nonsense. Absolute rubbish.

346
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,118
I knew it.

347
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,091
You are really stupid. It's lovely.

348
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:13,935
Okay, I have to go.
I'm late, as usual. Bye.

349
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,003
Your charm...

350
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,598
Fatal.

351
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,673
Your intoxication...

352
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:33,511
Sensuous.

353
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:39,350
What do I say, my love?

354
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:46,027
I'm dazed.

355
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,032
I'm dazed.

356
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:57,040
Your charm...

357
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,374
Fatal.

358
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,705
Your intoxication...

359
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:10,216
Sensuous.

360
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:16,122
What do I say, my love?

361
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:22,594
I'm dazed.

362
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,134
I'm dazed.

363
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:40,073
I'm always immersed
in your thoughts.

364
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:44,212
I'm always mulling
over your dilemma.

365
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:48,487
Without you, I'm not at peace.

366
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,087
My love, I'd even give
up my life for you.

367
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:59,102
My love, I have realised...

368
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,106
...you are obsessed about me.

369
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,108
Not my fault.

370
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,704
Not my mistake.

371
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,113
Your intoxication...

372
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,121
Is sensuous.

373
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:25,185
What do I say, my love?

374
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:31,799
I'm dazed.

375
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,805
I'm dazed.

376
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:40,209
Your charm...

377
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:44,874
Fatal.

378
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:49,147
Your intoxication...

379
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,156
Sensuous.

380
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:58,155
What do I say, my love?

381
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:04,167
I'm dazed.

382
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,829
I'm dazed.

383
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,531
The doctor is here, ma'am.

384
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,810
Is Karan in?
- Yes, sir. Come.

385
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,350
Camera.

386
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,389
I'll help you shoot an award
winning picture today.

387
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:11,760
Hurry up. Come on.

388
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:00,776
What is this?

389
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:06,281
He was born crazy. You too, Sneha? -
She wanted some unusual pictures...

390
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:09,451
...for college. I thought nothing
can be unusual than this.

391
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,886
It's brilliant, son.

392
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:16,298
For your fund raising fair, is it?
- Yeah, Karan.

393
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,564
Now get ready, Karan. Get up.
- Ten minutes.

394
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,697
Enough now. C'mon.
- I'm not a poet to write like you.

395
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:25,435
Get up now. I need all sorts of
pictures for my collection.

396
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,479
Okay.
- We're waiting for you in the car.

397
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,974
The nipple...?
- Take it.

398
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:34,442
Come downstairs.

399
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:37,377
Thanks, guys. Today I got great
pictures because of you.

400
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,383
I don't know about you, but
my favourite snap is Karan's.

401
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,786
Great pose. Yes, Karan?

402
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,562
Jackie, check out the sandwich
in the car, dude.

403
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:03,404
Try us, babes. He is
Rohan, I'm Vishal.

404
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:06,409
Come with us, you'll
enjoy the sandwich.

405
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,886
Stop, Karan. I must talk to them.
- Forget it, Vicky.

406
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,684
Sneha is with us, and they are
drunk. - Stop the car, Karan.

407
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:23,090
Just forget it.
- Stop, I say.

408
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:36,904
Vicky. Vicky, stop it.

409
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,732
Karan.

410
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:22,610
Shall we...?

411
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:26,022
If not for me, they'd
have thrashed you.

412
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,492
Just kidding. Shall we...?
- C'mon.

413
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,486
Wait, I'll drive.

414
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:38,899
Hope she didn't collapse?

415
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,661
Wake up, Sneha.
- Shut up, Vicky.

416
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,507
I hate when someone misbehaves
like that.

417
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,508
Look who's talking.
- Look who's talking.

418
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,518
Chill, guys.

419
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:03,685
Where are you going?

420
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:05,054
Home?

421
00:43:05,129 --> 00:43:06,857
Whose? - Yours.

422
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:11,060
Let's drop Sneha first.
- Sneha's car is at your place.

423
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,534
Who'll drive that?

424
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:16,062
If you can drive my car, you
can drive hers as well.

425
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:22,008
First I drop Sneha, then you, then
I drop her car at her place.

426
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,145
I'm Vicky, not Driver. - As a
friend, I'm not asking for much.

427
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:27,946
I'm dropping you home.

428
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:34,056
Come on, Karan. He is right.
Why should you drive back alone?

429
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:35,616
Follow?

430
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:10,752
Thanks.
- What for?

431
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:15,598
I love to drive.
- Not for that...

432
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,658
...but for what you did
for me tonight.

433
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:24,265
Personally, I hate fights but...

434
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:27,004
I felt happy.

435
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,607
Honestly, I just hate violence.
But...

436
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:37,780
...tonight when you got into a fight
for me, somehow I liked it.

437
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,618
I don't know... you understand
what I mean?

438
00:44:43,694 --> 00:44:44,820
I do.

439
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,624
You don't understand.
- I understand.

440
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:56,968
I love you, Sneha.

441
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:16,988
I love you, Sneha.

442
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:19,720
Hello...

443
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,831
I don't know. - I don't know?

444
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,333
Help.

445
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,679
I love you.

446
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,746
I don't know. What kind
of an answer is that, eh?

447
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:52,685
Who do I ask? I'll ask the watchman.

448
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:53,957
He must know. Shall I ask him?

449
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:32,325
Vicky, I'll talk to
you tomorrow. Bye.

450
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:34,894
Sneha, it's me. Karan.

451
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,331
Karan?

452
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:45,873
Karan.

453
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,209
You forgot your phone in the car.

454
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,082
I thought...

455
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:54,756
...you might need it.

456
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:07,770
Are you okay?

457
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:13,969
What happened?

458
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,108
Did someone say something?

459
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:24,250
I love you.

460
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:32,123
Vicky said that.

461
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,864
What did you say?
- I don't know.

462
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,138
You don't know?

463
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:52,275
I need time to think. It's
an important decision.

464
00:47:54,552 --> 00:48:00,320
Yeah. You need time to think. It's a
very important decision, Sneha.

465
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:06,226
Good night. - Good night.

466
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,059
Hi.
- Hi.

467
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,400
What's this?
- These are for exhibitions.

468
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,536
Where's Vicky?
- Setting up a stall at the fair.

469
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,476
Please give this to Pooja.
- Okay.

470
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,887
Come on in... please.

471
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,892
You must see how hard our
students have worked.

472
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:15,562
It's been our tradition. Excellence
with discipline. - Yeah.

473
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:21,404
This is the final announcement
for all the students...

474
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:25,901
This blue will look really
nice. - Yeah.

475
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:40,081
I Love You.

476
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:43,320
Love.

477
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:56,598
So Miss l-Don't-Know,
did you decide?

478
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:07,074
Sneha.

479
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,345
Sneha.

480
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,956
Hi. - Hi.

481
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:16,015
Giant wheel has started.
Let's ride.

482
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:22,356
Sneha.

483
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:26,632
Hi. - Hi.

484
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:23,025
What's he doing?
- Vicky, no.

485
00:51:23,093 --> 00:51:24,526
Vicky, what are you doing?

486
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:33,228
Get down.

487
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:35,703
What are you doing? Are you mad?

488
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:38,097
What are you up to, boss?

489
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:42,372
Shut up. I need to talk, it's
urgent. - Go home and talk.

490
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:45,040
Shut up.
- What are you doing?

491
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:48,050
I asked you something important,
you didn't reply. Do you love me?

492
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,178
What...? Are you mad?

493
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:54,588
Say you love me.

494
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,388
Go to hell.
- Tell me.

495
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:01,061
Or, I'll let myself go.
You'll regret if I die.

496
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:04,725
Go to hell. Take this
thing down. - Pull.

497
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:07,066
If you move it, I'll let myself go.
- No, no.

498
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:08,263
Stop.

499
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:11,130
Pull him down.
- Stop.

500
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,071
Our students are talented, and
to make them successful...

501
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:16,078
...we teach them to think high.
Thinking high and aiming high...

502
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:18,740
...helps them climb higher.

503
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,678
You can see our records. Our
students are always at the top.

504
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:24,745
Vicky. Stop it.
- Shall I let go?

505
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,483
I don't care.
- Shall I let go?

506
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,081
I don't care.

507
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:36,155
Vicky, I'm scared. - I ought
to be scared, I'm slipping.

508
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:39,101
Just grow up, Vicky.

509
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:43,105
I don't want to grow up. Adults
lie, children don't.

510
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,607
And I don't want to
lie to you. Sneha...

511
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:50,577
I know we won't be happy, we'll
be constantly brawling.

512
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:53,274
You will even hate the
sight of me later.

513
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,277
I know that if you approve,
you will rue this day later.

514
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:03,592
But if you turn me down today, you
will never find a lover like me.

515
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:05,453
Never.

516
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,257
Say you love me.

517
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:12,124
I want you to see what our students
are doing right now.

518
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:14,134
Pull it down, guys.

519
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,731
Sneha, I love you.
Sneha, I love you.

520
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:21,668
Tell me, you love me.
Tell me, you love me.

521
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,609
Hey, you. Come down.

522
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,311
What are you up to?
- Me, sir?

523
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,651
Yes, you. Come down.

524
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:38,558
Such pests.

525
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:47,499
What were you up to? What do
you think you were doing?

526
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:50,630
Professing my love.
- Shut up.

527
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,699
This indiscipline will
not be tolerated.

528
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,174
But I love her, sir.

529
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,684
Well young man, you can carry
on the love sitting at home.

530
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:06,714
You are suspended for
a month. And...

531
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,189
...during this period...

532
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:10,522
...you are not allowed to enter
the college premises.

533
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,188
Please sir. Come.

534
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,223
I'll die.

535
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,727
I'll die.

536
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:11,514
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

537
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:16,252
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

538
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:21,263
In love, let alone my heart,
even my life...

539
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:23,731
I shall dedicate to you.

540
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,267
I'll die.

541
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:29,738
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

542
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:34,675
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

543
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:39,272
In love, let alone my heart,
even my life...

544
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,284
I shall dedicate to you.

545
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:43,614
I'll die.

546
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:47,783
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

547
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:27,329
I've fallen for you...

548
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:29,388
...in only a few meetings.

549
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:34,335
You invade my dreams.

550
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:38,738
Don't turn away from your lover.

551
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:43,337
I shall not give up trying.

552
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:47,816
Your love, your charm...

553
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,409
...torment me.

554
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:52,079
I'll die.

555
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:56,854
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

556
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,371
I'm gonna die.

557
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,380
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

558
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:22,384
Good God.

559
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:24,386
You've set my heart racing.

560
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:28,982
Why don't you understand
my gestures?

561
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:31,391
Before your persistence...

562
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,452
I yield.

563
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:38,058
I've realised your restlessness,
my love.

564
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:42,401
Listen to me, my love...

565
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:45,407
I accept your plea.

566
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:46,942
I'm gonna die.

567
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:51,413
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

568
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:56,418
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

569
00:57:56,486 --> 00:58:00,752
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

570
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:05,420
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

571
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:09,897
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

572
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:14,596
I'll die, I'll ruin myself.

573
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:38,460
Idiot. You are still sleeping?
I phoned you half-hour back.

574
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:42,456
Get up, Vicky.
- Am I dreaming about you?

575
00:58:42,532 --> 00:58:43,590
Yes.

576
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:48,934
Then why are you wearing clothes?
- Very funny.

577
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:50,970
Are you getting up?
Or do I drench you?

578
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,941
There are better ways to wake
one up. - Get up.

579
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:59,641
Stop it... stop it.

580
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:07,648
Ouch.

581
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:11,491
You pinched me.
- Vicky, I'm not over here for this.

582
00:59:12,028 --> 00:59:15,020
I only came to ask you
where's Karan.

583
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,828
Don't you think you should
ask Karan that?

584
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:23,502
Stop joking. He's not
even taking my calls.

585
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:26,633
Why?

586
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:33,913
No idea. Did you talk to him?
I wonder where he is.

587
00:59:37,587 --> 00:59:38,849
I know what the problem is.

588
00:59:41,591 --> 00:59:42,785
I know where he is.

589
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:46,653
C'mon.

590
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,451
Stay here, I'll go and meet him.
- Why?

591
01:00:11,188 --> 01:00:12,985
I need to talk to him alone.

592
01:00:17,194 --> 01:00:19,628
Where's Karan?
- On the terrace.

593
01:00:28,538 --> 01:00:30,130
What's this new hobby?

594
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:34,072
Speaks damn well of you.

595
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,076
It's fun, isn't it? We used to
fly kites as kids, remember?

596
01:00:48,091 --> 01:00:50,025
Karan, I'm not doing anything
rash with Sneha.

597
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,997
I'm not messing around.
- Do you see this kite, Vicky?

598
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,499
Know why it is flying? Because
it's in right hands.

599
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:03,033
In wrong hands, it'd bite the dust.

600
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,508
You mean Sneha is the kite and
mine are the wrong hands?

601
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:11,503
Then whose are the right hands?

602
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:15,516
Whose are the right hands?
- Anyone's, but not yours.

603
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:20,189
Karan, you're not being
fair to Sneha. - And you?

604
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:24,926
What do you mean?
- Priyanka, Michelle...

605
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:29,591
Don't dig up the past.
- Past defines a person's character.

606
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:44,077
Sneha, let's go upstairs.

607
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:47,207
Just come on.
- I'm coming.

608
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:50,047
Tell me... what's the matter?
- I'll tell you.

609
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,219
Karan, tell her what's the problem.

610
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:02,689
Speak.

611
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:06,727
What's the matter, Karan?

612
01:02:07,637 --> 01:02:10,162
No problem at all, Sneha.
- Problem, there is.

613
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:13,166
How silly. - Really? And
what've you been doing?

614
01:02:15,045 --> 01:02:17,570
Will someone tell me what's
happening? - He won't tell you.

615
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:19,913
I'll tell you, Sneha...
- Nothing of that sort.

616
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:21,109
Then what the hell is it?

617
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,654
He is your best friend.
And know what he thinks?

618
01:02:29,192 --> 01:02:32,923
You know about my past, don't you?
About my ex-girlfriends and all?

619
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:34,122
See?

620
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:37,189
I've told her everything.
I've hidden nothing.

621
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,593
I really love her.

622
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:47,075
Karan. - I was just
concerned. - I know.

623
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:51,144
Just give me a chance, Karan.
It's important for me too.

624
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:54,006
Why must you punish
her because of me?

625
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,618
You trust me, Karan?

626
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,622
I trust Vicky.

627
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:10,789
This is the first time I'm
so happy in all these years.

628
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,167
It won't be the same without you.

629
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:22,769
Sorry.

630
01:03:24,314 --> 01:03:27,647
Take care of her, Vicky.
Else, you've had it.

631
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,826
Officer, the patient has lost much
blood, but he is out of danger.

632
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:51,002
I can't say when he'll come around.

633
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:54,073
Thank you, doctor.
- It's all right.

634
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,842
We've found Vikram Mathur's
criminal record, ma'am.

635
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:14,853
So where had you guys gone
that day? - Velocity.

636
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:16,694
No, I had gone there, but you
were not there. - We were there.

637
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:18,700
We were there.

638
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:22,704
You didn't go there? -
I was there. - She was there.

639
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,239
I didn't meet her. -
Shweta, who Shweta?

640
01:04:24,307 --> 01:04:25,706
No, she wasn't there.
- Yeah, she was.

641
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,866
Let me remind you guys that
we have to submit...

642
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:29,707
...the assignment within two days.

643
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,713
Don't you ever talk something nice?

644
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:35,717
He is right. Karan, is
your assignment ready?

645
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:36,877
I'm ready.

646
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:41,723
Hi. - May I help you ma'am?
- Table for four, please.

647
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:47,729
Karan, your friend, Chandni...
the party girl.

648
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,734
I'll go and meet her.

649
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:04,744
How are you? - How're you
doing? How was the party? - Good.

650
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,754
You're looking very nice.
- Thank you. - As always.

651
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,764
Where's Karan?
- He's there.

652
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:25,767
Come, meet him. - Sure. Girls,
I'll catch you later.

653
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:26,927
Okay sure. See you later. - Bye.

654
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,101
Hi Karan.
- Hi. How are you?

655
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:33,108
You know Sneha?
- Hi Sneha.

656
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,110
Hi.
- Isn't she looking hot?

657
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:41,109
Thanks a lot, sweetheart. -

658
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:43,118
What will you have?
Champagne, I guess.

659
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:49,781
Where to?
- I've got some work to do. - Sneha.

660
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:57,797
You guys stay here... I got to go.
- Where to? Chandni will be bored

661
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:59,801
Not for a moment. Just chill.

662
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:04,134
Tell me.

663
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:09,134
What's wrong, Sneha? Will
you say something?

664
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:10,802
What are you doing?

665
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:14,973
You didn't speak till here, and
now... - Go and chat with Chandni.

666
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:16,814
Grab her hand.

667
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:20,822
What are you saying?
- Just what I saw.

668
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:27,329
It's not funny, at least for me.
- It was only for Karan's sake...

669
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:30,833
She's the daughter of his dad's
friend, not your father's friend.

670
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,161
Yet you went to meet her, not Karan.

671
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,830
I was just trying to be nice.
- Don't try to defend yourself.

672
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,839
Defend? Why? I haven't
done anything.

673
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:41,843
Well, so you should've
done something.

674
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,344
I don't understand what you mean.
- Vicky, I love you.

675
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:47,178
You are the first guy in my life.

676
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,013
With someone else...
I don't like it.

677
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:52,851
With someone else, what? Can't
I even talk to someone else?

678
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:54,856
It was much more than talking.

679
01:06:55,191 --> 01:06:58,854
Sneha, you are being too possessive.
- I am, but I don't know about you.

680
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:02,864
What if I am with someone else...?
- What is wrong with you?

681
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:06,868
It's such a silly thing...
- Silly thing? Vicky, I love you.

682
01:07:08,938 --> 01:07:10,872
Even I love you.

683
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,374
You think only you know how to love?
- That's what it appears to be.

684
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:16,207
Stop harping about love.
What can you do for me?

685
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:19,874
I can do anything for
you, just tell me.

686
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:24,215
You love me? What can you do for me?

687
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,879
Anything.

688
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:27,886
Anything?

689
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:30,389
All right.

690
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,896
Take off your top.
- What.

691
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:39,899
Yes. Anything for me, right?
Take off your top.

692
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:44,905
Are you serious?

693
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:47,899
Yeah.

694
01:07:48,978 --> 01:07:50,912
Will it prove my love for you?

695
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:01,923
Okay, fine.

696
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:07,428
Just joking.

697
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:10,932
Forgive me if I've wronged you.

698
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:15,937
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

699
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:25,276
Karan was probably right.
I'm not trustworthy.

700
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:27,939
I'm not trustworthy.

701
01:08:32,455 --> 01:08:35,947
When you find me trustworthy...
do it.

702
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:38,954
I promise, that day will come.

703
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:49,030
You made me fall in love.

704
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,031
You made me fall in love.

705
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:56,037
You made me fall in love with you.

706
01:09:56,205 --> 01:09:59,038
Without you, my arms crave.

707
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:01,372
Without you, my eyes thirst.

708
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:05,039
Without you, my sighs go unheeded.

709
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,209
Without you, my arms crave.

710
01:10:09,285 --> 01:10:12,049
Without you, my eyes thirst.

711
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:15,056
Without you, my sighs go unheeded.

712
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:21,062
You made me fall in love.

713
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,064
You made me fall in love.

714
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:26,397
You made me fall in love with you.

715
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:31,066
You made me fall in love.

716
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,404
You made me fall in love.

717
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:37,071
You made me fall in love with you.

718
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,411
Without you, time torments me.

719
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:43,077
Without you,
restlessness burns me.

720
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:46,417
Without you, peace evades me.

721
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:25,124
This anxiety, this distance
seem never-ending.

722
01:11:25,461 --> 01:11:30,125
Agony is what I get
for falling in love.

723
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,137
This anxiety, this distance
seem never-ending.

724
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:40,141
Agony is what I get
for falling in love.

725
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:46,145
My pining shatters me.

726
01:11:47,216 --> 01:11:51,152
This distance compels me.

727
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,484
Without you, my life is worthless.

728
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:56,150
Without you, my heart
stops beating.

729
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:59,490
Without you, I'm shelter less.

730
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:05,164
You made me fall in love.

731
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,498
You made me fall in love.

732
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:11,165
You made me fall in love with you.

733
01:12:44,273 --> 01:12:48,209
In my eyes, I behold you forever.

734
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:54,215
In this moment of ecstasy,
my passions run deep.

735
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:59,220
In my eyes, I behold you forever.

736
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:04,223
In this moment of ecstasy,
my passions run deep.

737
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:10,231
I'm crossing my limits
involuntarily.

738
01:13:10,299 --> 01:13:14,235
In your arms, I'm giving in.

739
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:17,238
Without you,
my nights are endless.

740
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:19,240
Without you, my thirst
is unquenchable.

741
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:23,242
Without you, the distance
seems boundless.

742
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:28,408
You made me fall in love.

743
01:13:28,484 --> 01:13:31,248
You made me fall in love.

744
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:34,255
You made me fall in love with you.

745
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,283
I love you, Vicky.

746
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:05,286
I just want you to know...

747
01:14:06,455 --> 01:14:08,286
...that, I have given everything...

748
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:12,287
I trust you, Vicky.

749
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:15,286
I trust you.

750
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:28,306
So how's Chandni?

751
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,312
Sorry...

752
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:36,317
How was Chandni?

753
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:40,321
Are you crazy? She's a decent girl.

754
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:44,325
Really? - We're going
out for dinner tomorrow.

755
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:47,326
Accelerating, eh. Not bad.

756
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,494
Guess what, guys? I got
a phone call. - From whom?

757
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:57,869
Dad. He'll be in
Mumbai for two hours.

758
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,340
And he's meeting me for dinner.

759
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:02,343
That's good news.
- Yeah.

760
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:10,346
I was thinking... will you join me?

761
01:15:15,424 --> 01:15:16,516
Sure.

762
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,371
Is Karan in?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:41,379
What brings you here?

764
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:43,882
I'm stuck.

765
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,547
What happened?
- The exhibition guy called up.

766
01:15:47,623 --> 01:15:50,717
He wants to see my paintings. I
thought I'd show it in your house.

767
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:54,388
My house is in a mess. - He wants
paintings, not your house.

768
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:57,396
But you were supposed to go out
for dinner with Sneha's dad.

769
01:15:57,466 --> 01:16:01,402
Yes, that's another headache.
She's sitting in the car.

770
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,404
She'll mind if I don't go with her.

771
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:07,408
If I go, I'll land in a soup.

772
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,411
Isn't there a way to reason
with her, Karan?

773
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:13,742
How do I do it? I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

774
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:18,747
How do I reason with her?
- I understand.

775
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:23,421
Sneha. - Why didn't you
tell me, Vicky?

776
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:26,424
You should've told me before.

777
01:16:26,929 --> 01:16:30,421
Now come on, go ahead. Best of luck.

778
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,433
I'll meet dad alone.

779
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:36,427
You are a sweetheart. Thanks
for understanding.

780
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:40,439
Will you go alone in the night?
Karan will go with you.

781
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:46,447
What are you saying? He has a date.
- Yes, but it can be called off.

782
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:49,450
Karan, come on...
- Not a big deal.

783
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:51,782
I'll get the car.
- Thanks.

784
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:57,617
Okay.

785
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:05,466
Look, I know how important this
is for you. Please forgive me.

786
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:08,469
Go with Karan this time.

787
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:13,474
When it's time to discuss marriage,
I'll go with you.

788
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:15,974
All right?

789
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:18,477
Okay?

790
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:28,489
I'm so excited to meet dad.

791
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,493
It's been so long.

792
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:59,520
You just tried his number.
I don't think he is coming.

793
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,864
Take me to Vicky.

794
01:19:48,661 --> 01:19:49,923
Listen to me... Sneha.

795
01:19:49,996 --> 01:19:51,088
Listen to me...

796
01:19:51,164 --> 01:19:54,099
One minute, listen to me...
- Just leave me.

797
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,599
Just leave me alone.

798
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:03,606
Didn't she tell you? She doesn't
want to talk to you.

799
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:04,768
Lay off. I want to talk...

800
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:09,614
Not to wrong her, I told you.
- Lay off, I say.

801
01:20:13,686 --> 01:20:15,620
I can hit too.
- Hit me.

802
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:44,978
How dare you?

803
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:46,143
How dare you?

804
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,156
For a moment I might even
forget what you did to me.

805
01:20:51,224 --> 01:20:54,660
But with Karan... How
dare you hit him?

806
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:00,665
Karan is the most important
part of my life.

807
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:06,671
And I trust him more
than I trust myself.

808
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:11,674
My mother's no more, my
Papa is not with me.

809
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:16,271
But Karan is with me, I know.

810
01:21:16,349 --> 01:21:17,839
And he shall be, always.

811
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,681
<i>What's going on?</i>

812
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:30,695
What's going on?
- Sir, Vicky is harassing me.

813
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:36,030
Didn't I suspend you? What
are you doing here?

814
01:21:36,102 --> 01:21:39,697
Mind your own business, Sir.
It's between us. Get lost.

815
01:21:39,772 --> 01:21:42,707
You have no manners.
- I haven't. So?

816
01:21:43,776 --> 01:21:45,710
You are rusticated, Vikram.

817
01:21:45,778 --> 01:21:48,713
Get out of here.
- Not without talking to her.

818
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:50,715
Sneha, listen to me...

819
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,042
Sawant. Hari. Throw him out.

820
01:21:56,389 --> 01:21:57,720
Let go.

821
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:01,382
Sneha, you belong to me. Only me.

822
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,742
Sneha, if you say... I mean,
you are all alone.

823
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:31,756
It's okay, Karan. Besides,
I'm used to living alone.

824
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,762
Still if you need
something, call me.

825
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:39,761
Take care.
- Take care.

826
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,911
What is it?

827
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:17,249
Speak up. What the hell is wrong
with you? Speak up.

828
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:20,922
Leave me alone.

829
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:28,993
Vicky, leave me alone.
Please leave me alone.

830
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,995
Please leave me alone.

831
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:46,071
I shall never leave you.

832
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,093
Hello? Karan...

833
01:28:12,598 --> 01:28:14,259
Come over quickly, Karan.

834
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,096
Come over quickly, Karan.

835
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,432
Karan, please come here.

836
01:28:19,505 --> 01:28:21,097
Karan, please come here.

837
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,455
The fingerprint report is here.
All the fingerprints match.

838
01:28:40,527 --> 01:28:43,121
All the evidence points out to him.

839
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:50,125
Is her father here?
- Yes.

840
01:28:51,204 --> 01:28:53,138
Thank you.

841
01:28:53,206 --> 01:28:56,141
When will I get her
postmortem report?

842
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:58,473
In a couple of hours.
- Thank you, doctor.

843
01:28:58,545 --> 01:28:59,637
Welcome.

844
01:29:05,218 --> 01:29:09,154
<i>I shall never leave you.</i>

845
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:20,162
Don't worry.

846
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:26,165
I'm here. Go to bed.

847
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,171
I'll talk to Vicky.

848
01:29:31,944 --> 01:29:33,878
I'll handle it.

849
01:29:42,221 --> 01:29:46,885
Why is the police here?
- I don't know.

850
01:29:46,959 --> 01:29:49,052
Looks like something's
Terribly wrong.

851
01:29:53,966 --> 01:29:55,228
C'mon.

852
01:29:55,301 --> 01:29:57,895
Move it.

853
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:01,904
Get out of here.
- What's wrong?

854
01:30:01,974 --> 01:30:03,908
Drugs.

855
01:30:03,976 --> 01:30:05,238
Get in.

856
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:08,241
Can I...?
- Move it.

857
01:30:10,082 --> 01:30:11,572
Drive.

858
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:17,250
What are you staring
at? Junkie.

859
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:44,946
The cops have found some
drugs at his place.

860
01:30:46,452 --> 01:30:47,942
Surprising.

861
01:30:50,456 --> 01:30:52,287
Vicky can do anything but not drugs.

862
01:31:19,318 --> 01:31:22,151
I shall give up my life...

863
01:31:22,221 --> 01:31:26,988
...for a smile from you.

864
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:30,322
All that I possess
means nothing...

865
01:31:30,396 --> 01:31:33,991
...before a smile of yours.

866
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:38,326
The tears in your eyes,
all your sorrows...

867
01:31:38,404 --> 01:31:41,999
...let me have them, my love.

868
01:31:42,074 --> 01:31:44,008
Come to me.

869
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,014
Come closer.

870
01:31:59,091 --> 01:32:02,026
Honestly...

871
01:32:02,094 --> 01:32:06,030
I shall be with you...

872
01:32:07,099 --> 01:32:10,034
Even during hard times.

873
01:32:10,202 --> 01:32:14,036
I shall endure everything.

874
01:32:14,206 --> 01:32:18,199
The roads, the distance hear
them all say that...

875
01:32:18,277 --> 01:32:22,373
I shall walk with you.

876
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:26,043
I shall walk with you.

877
01:32:26,218 --> 01:32:30,211
Come, let me love you,
let me die for you.

878
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:34,055
For you, I shall
forsake this world.

879
01:32:36,128 --> 01:32:38,062
Come to me.

880
01:32:40,132 --> 01:32:42,066
Come closer.

881
01:32:43,402 --> 01:32:46,394
I shall give up my life...

882
01:32:46,472 --> 01:32:50,067
...for a smile from you.

883
01:32:51,143 --> 01:32:54,408
All that I possess
means nothing...

884
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,075
...before a smile of yours.

885
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:02,414
The tears in your eyes,
all your sorrows...

886
01:33:02,488 --> 01:33:06,083
...let me have them, my love.

887
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:08,092
Come to me.

888
01:33:10,162 --> 01:33:12,096
Come closer.

889
01:33:12,164 --> 01:33:14,098
Come to me.

890
01:33:16,168 --> 01:33:18,102
Come closer.

891
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:20,263
Come closer.

892
01:33:21,707 --> 01:33:23,106
How are you, Sneha?

893
01:33:25,177 --> 01:33:28,112
Congratulations, dear. I'm very
happy for both of you.

894
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,116
See Mr Oberoi? He's always
been before our eyes.

895
01:33:32,184 --> 01:33:37,121
But after seeing his friends, I
feel Karan has really grown up.

896
01:34:22,835 --> 01:34:24,166
Are you okay?

897
01:34:27,239 --> 01:34:28,672
Tormented?

898
01:34:33,345 --> 01:34:35,336
I have a remedy.

899
01:36:05,938 --> 01:36:07,269
Come.

900
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,272
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

901
01:36:16,348 --> 01:36:18,543
May I help you?
- Yes. A table for two, please.

902
01:36:19,285 --> 01:36:21,276
Certainly, sir. Please take
a seat while I check.

903
01:36:33,632 --> 01:36:36,897
Such maturity, so suddenly...
I failed to realize.

904
01:36:39,638 --> 01:36:43,506
If only I had stayed with you.
I was never with you.

905
01:36:44,376 --> 01:36:46,776
It's okay, dad.
- No...

906
01:36:47,846 --> 01:36:50,314
I have made very few
mistakes in life.

907
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:54,642
But this mistake is
the most terrible one.

908
01:36:56,722 --> 01:37:02,854
I'm not trying to defend myself.
I'm indeed a very selfish man.

909
01:37:04,663 --> 01:37:09,396
After your mother passed away, to
get rid of my own loneliness...

910
01:37:09,468 --> 01:37:11,333
I got so busy that...

911
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:15,606
...I even forgot that you were alone.

912
01:37:21,947 --> 01:37:23,847
Dad, you did fine.

913
01:37:27,953 --> 01:37:31,548
Had I stayed with you,
I'd have got more love.

914
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:33,817
Dad, I love you.

915
01:37:36,762 --> 01:37:40,528
Karan told me about what
happened with Vicky.

916
01:37:43,702 --> 01:37:46,637
I don't know if I have the right
to tell you or not, but...

917
01:37:48,707 --> 01:37:50,834
I think you should get married.

918
01:37:52,378 --> 01:37:53,572
What?

919
01:37:54,646 --> 01:37:58,707
Marriage is not a joke that you
decide suddenly and do it pronto.

920
01:37:59,918 --> 01:38:04,719
After all that has happened with me,
I don't trust anyone. No man at all.

921
01:38:05,557 --> 01:38:09,391
Karan?
- Karan? He's just my friend.

922
01:38:09,461 --> 01:38:12,396
That's even better. You
both know each other.

923
01:38:12,564 --> 01:38:16,000
Dad, you are too... - Excuse me,
sir. Your table is ready.

924
01:38:16,068 --> 01:38:17,933
Okay. Come.

925
01:38:28,747 --> 01:38:31,580
Anyway, think about it.
I'll be right back.

926
01:38:50,636 --> 01:38:51,762
Hi.

927
01:38:52,838 --> 01:38:53,930
Hi.

928
01:38:57,609 --> 01:38:58,769
Did you talk to dad?

929
01:39:00,712 --> 01:39:04,443
Yes. He loves you dearly.

930
01:39:05,717 --> 01:39:07,446
He really loves you a lot.

931
01:39:08,787 --> 01:39:13,451
In fact, I've also decided
to join his business.

932
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:16,789
I thought...

933
01:39:19,731 --> 01:39:20,857
...it's just a thought...

934
01:39:22,734 --> 01:39:26,067
lf... I was just thinking...

935
01:39:32,077 --> 01:39:33,476
Will you marry me?

936
01:39:38,817 --> 01:39:41,809
In losing myself...

937
01:39:41,887 --> 01:39:44,822
I have found you.

938
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:48,825
Excuse me.
- Tonight, this secret...

939
01:39:49,661 --> 01:39:53,495
...comes to my lips.

940
01:39:53,565 --> 01:39:57,558
My love, your simplicity...

941
01:39:57,636 --> 01:40:05,042
...has made me fall in love.

942
01:40:05,677 --> 01:40:09,511
This is my only truth, you
mean the very life to me.

943
01:40:09,681 --> 01:40:13,048
You are the fountainhead
of my desires.

944
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:15,109
Come to me.

945
01:40:15,187 --> 01:40:20,591
Come closer.

946
01:40:22,995 --> 01:40:28,729
Come to me.

947
01:41:00,732 --> 01:41:02,757
Come closer.

948
01:41:02,901 --> 01:41:04,732
No, sir. We haven't
informed her family.

949
01:41:04,903 --> 01:41:09,567
Yes, sir.

950
01:41:09,908 --> 01:41:12,706
Yes, sir. On the basis of
statement and fingerprints.

951
01:41:12,844 --> 01:41:14,038
Send it now.

952
01:41:15,747 --> 01:41:18,580
Yes, sir. One more thing.

953
01:41:18,917 --> 01:41:20,908
I spoke to the doctor.

954
01:41:20,986 --> 01:41:23,921
He said we can arrest
him as soon as he comes to.

955
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:27,581
Yes, sir. Right sir.

956
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:29,986
Thank you, sir.

957
01:41:43,008 --> 01:41:44,100
Hi sweetheart.

958
01:42:35,994 --> 01:42:37,188
I don't believe it, Sneha.

959
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,258
I still think this is all a dream.

960
01:42:47,139 --> 01:42:49,004
It's not a dream, Karan.

961
01:42:51,209 --> 01:42:52,676
Thank you.

962
01:42:53,211 --> 01:42:54,838
You must thank me, Karan.

963
01:42:57,015 --> 01:43:00,678
Had I not gone to jail, you
wouldn't have had Sneha.

964
01:43:04,022 --> 01:43:05,182
Chill, chill.

965
01:43:06,024 --> 01:43:07,855
I just came to congratulate
the two of you.

966
01:43:10,228 --> 01:43:11,695
Chill.

967
01:43:12,364 --> 01:43:14,696
Sneha, you are a very lucky girl.

968
01:43:17,102 --> 01:43:19,969
You have found such a gentleman.

969
01:43:21,106 --> 01:43:22,767
He loves you very dearly.

970
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:26,707
So dearly, that he's willing...

971
01:43:26,778 --> 01:43:28,712
...to put behind everything
that had happened...

972
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,906
...between you and me.

973
01:43:37,989 --> 01:43:40,890
Stop him, Sneha. I can
raise my hand too.

974
01:43:41,893 --> 01:43:43,053
And you won't like it.

975
01:43:44,262 --> 01:43:46,730
After all he is the most important
part of your life.

976
01:43:50,068 --> 01:43:51,797
Get out, Vicky. Just leave us alone.

977
01:43:51,903 --> 01:43:55,134
I'm not here to harass you,
Sneha. I'm leaving.

978
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:59,734
But before that, Karan,
I got a gift for you.

979
01:44:00,078 --> 01:44:01,739
Somebody wants to wish you.

980
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:06,945
Chandni.

981
01:44:17,162 --> 01:44:20,757
She wasn't willing to come.
I had a lot of pleading to do.

982
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:25,763
So? How's your engagement gift?

983
01:44:28,306 --> 01:44:29,967
Tell me, Karan. Why are you silent?

984
01:44:30,776 --> 01:44:32,767
What's on your mind?
New ideas? New plots?

985
01:44:34,045 --> 01:44:35,774
He's a great schemer, Sneha.

986
01:44:37,115 --> 01:44:38,980
C'mon, don't lie to your fiancée.

987
01:44:40,452 --> 01:44:44,445
She has implicit faith in you.
Tell her. Why are you silent?

988
01:44:46,124 --> 01:44:49,059
He won't tell you, Sneha.
I guess he is shy.

989
01:44:51,196 --> 01:44:53,994
I'll explain.
- Yes, I did it.

990
01:45:00,205 --> 01:45:03,003
I did it. And I didn't
do anything wrong.

991
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:06,802
Because I love her.

992
01:45:07,312 --> 01:45:08,802
I don't know since when...

993
01:45:09,414 --> 01:45:10,813
...but I love her dearly.

994
01:45:14,352 --> 01:45:19,881
And you, swine, you thought you'd
woo her with your cool attitude, eh?

995
01:45:21,226 --> 01:45:22,818
I tried to reason, but...

996
01:45:24,296 --> 01:45:26,821
And Sneha, you... at least
you should've understood.

997
01:45:28,099 --> 01:45:32,297
I admit I was wrong, I could
never express it to you.

998
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:34,365
But why didn't you understand?

999
01:45:35,373 --> 01:45:39,104
The two of you never bothered
about me. You were so selfish.

1000
01:45:39,377 --> 01:45:43,507
So why'd I bother about you
guys? That night, when...

1001
01:45:49,321 --> 01:45:54,020
I saw the two of you. And I decided
to kick you out of my life.

1002
01:45:56,194 --> 01:45:57,855
Love doesn't happen
overnight, Vicky.

1003
01:45:58,363 --> 01:46:00,854
I waited for three years.
I wouldn't let it go waste.

1004
01:46:03,268 --> 01:46:06,362
That day I called up
the exhibitionist.

1005
01:46:07,372 --> 01:46:11,206
Then I called up Chandni
and set you up, Vicky...

1006
01:46:11,276 --> 01:46:14,074
...so that Sneha would
catch you red handed

1007
01:46:17,148 --> 01:46:19,878
Then I found your phone,
and I harassed Sneha.

1008
01:46:43,375 --> 01:46:45,434
I knew you had Gullu's drugs.

1009
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:54,176
That's why I phoned the police...

1010
01:46:54,252 --> 01:46:55,913
...sent you to jail.

1011
01:46:58,256 --> 01:46:59,917
And I drew Sneha closer to me.

1012
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:03,418
I told her everything that I could
never ever tell her before.

1013
01:47:05,263 --> 01:47:06,924
Never before.

1014
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:08,324
How could you, Karan?

1015
01:47:10,435 --> 01:47:11,925
How could you?

1016
01:47:16,541 --> 01:47:17,940
You are my friend.

1017
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:20,939
My best friend.

1018
01:47:23,281 --> 01:47:24,441
You too?

1019
01:47:26,117 --> 01:47:27,277
Why?

1020
01:47:28,219 --> 01:47:29,277
Why, Karan?

1021
01:47:29,487 --> 01:47:34,117
How could you be so selfish?
You've made a joke out of my life.

1022
01:47:36,227 --> 01:47:37,353
What was my mistake?

1023
01:47:39,364 --> 01:47:43,232
See? The moment you are back,
the problems have begun.

1024
01:47:46,137 --> 01:47:47,968
Why did you do this, Karan?

1025
01:47:50,241 --> 01:47:51,299
I hate you.

1026
01:47:53,378 --> 01:47:54,970
I hate you.

1027
01:47:55,513 --> 01:47:57,981
All right. I'm bad, aren't I?

1028
01:48:09,327 --> 01:48:10,487
All right. If I am so bad...

1029
01:48:11,262 --> 01:48:12,991
I'd rather go away from your life.

1030
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:23,393
Excuse me.

1031
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:28,070
May I...?

1032
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:33,076
Sure.

1033
01:49:42,253 --> 01:49:44,278
I could never be endearing to you.

1034
01:49:46,424 --> 01:49:48,358
I could never draw you closer.

1035
01:49:48,426 --> 01:49:51,759
Yet my heart kept
singing to you...

1036
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:55,163
...come to me.

1037
01:49:55,433 --> 01:49:59,301
Come closer to me.

1038
01:50:09,447 --> 01:50:10,505
I'm sorry, Sneha.

1039
01:50:14,452 --> 01:50:19,116
In your eyes, I always saw
love for Vicky. Not for me.

1040
01:50:23,328 --> 01:50:26,627
Actually, I tried to snatch love.

1041
01:50:27,799 --> 01:50:29,323
I never tried to win it.

1042
01:50:33,605 --> 01:50:35,596
I know you will be very
happy with Vicky.

1043
01:50:36,674 --> 01:50:39,802
And because of me, Chandni...

1044
01:50:41,613 --> 01:50:43,547
I deserved to be punished for it.

1045
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,678
I'm sorry.

1046
01:51:34,365 --> 01:51:36,196
I made a terrible mistake.

1047
01:51:39,537 --> 01:51:41,471
I didn't give you
a chance to explain.

1048
01:51:45,543 --> 01:51:47,204
But you still...

1049
01:51:55,553 --> 01:51:57,214
Vicky, I love you.

1050
01:52:00,391 --> 01:52:01,551
I really love you.

1051
01:52:09,634 --> 01:52:11,226
Do you love me?

1052
01:52:15,573 --> 01:52:16,631
Yeah.

1053
01:52:17,642 --> 01:52:19,234
What can you do for me?

1054
01:52:20,645 --> 01:52:21,737
Anything.

1055
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:28,243
Take off your top.
