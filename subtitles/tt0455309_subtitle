MLA sir! Hello! Please come.

00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,614
Today is sir's birthday.
- Oh, I see.

3
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,784
That's why he came so far
to keep his oath to God.

4
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,920
Sir! on your birthday
God favoured you..

5
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,588

6
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,113
MLA sir! MLA sir!
- Yes!

7
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,614
You forgot to take the prasad.

8
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,242
Go and bring it.
- come sir.

9
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,836
What happened to him? Just see.

10
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,398
Get in ! Get in !

11
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,783
Leave me!

12
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,286
White Sumo. Red sticker. 

13
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,882
If you make noise' the bullet
will pierce through you.

14
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,135
No extra fittings. over! over!

15
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,150
If they come to know
of my kidnapping..

16
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,695
..in a little while whole
lndia will be in chaos.

17
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,906
Is India your backyard or
something' to be in chaos?

18
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,618
If our leader comes to know this'
you will be in trouble.

19
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,453
Your leader himself told our
brother to kidnap you..

20
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,080
..that's why we brought you here..

21
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,624
..There are important bills to
be passed in the assembly..

22
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,668
..and since you are not
co-operating with them..

23
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,504
..he asked us to keep
you here for two days..

24
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,673
..Sir' please don't
misunderstand me..

25
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,217
.. I just do what I am told to
do and take what I am given..

26
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,720
..If you want me to kidnap your
leader' just tell me' I'll do it..

27
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,346
..We made two sketches for you..

28
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,099
..for your leader we'll make
four sketches' that's all..

29
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,478
..Another important thing' there
are sharks in the water..

30
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,232
..If you try to escape from here'
you'll become their food.

31
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,447
What is this? For some
real estate party..

32
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,991
..why did they make us sit here?

33
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,493
It's not some real estate party.
It's Nath and co..

34
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,996
..selling illegal places'
supplying gangsters..

35
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,750
..to political leaders' from
settlements to murders..'

36
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,252
..everything in Viag
is handled by them..

37
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,047
..Vishwanath' Badrinath'
Loknath' Jaganath..

38
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,842
..there are four of them. They
have men to assault anyone..

39
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,053
..for 5'000 rupees and to put
a spot on someone for 50'000..

40
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,471
What's an assault?

41
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,056
To break one's hands and legs.

42
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,308
What's a spot?
- To murder someone.

43
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,740
Badri! What's the matter?

44
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,992
It's about a field in Marripalem'
brother.

45
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,245
In Marripalem? Isn't
the value less there?

46
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,790
It is beside the GNT road
with a 1000 foot frontage..

47
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,292
..and is of 140 acres..

48
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,795
..The selling party
is from Anakapalli..

49
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,297
..and the one buying is
our Varadarajula group..

50
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,051
..The 8 farmers say that they
will leave the field..

51
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,969
..only if they get 25'000
rupees each..

52
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,723
Who is occupying who's place?

53
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,810
The law says that one who ploughs
the field is the owner of it.

54
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,312
* For a girl's marriage there
are many things to be done..

55
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,066
..to arrange flowers' hold
engagement' build a tent..

56
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,820
..tie thoranas' fix a time' arrange
for the first night and so on..

57
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,322
..Similarly for a land we need
an advance' a certificate..

58
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,825
..an agreement' other troubles'
obstacles' survey' power etc..

59
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,327
..From the time of registration
to putting a fence around it..

60
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,162
..there are many other
works involved in it.

61
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,539
But that's the government's
rule sir.

62
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,583
How many children do you have?
- Five kids.

63
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,461
Did you give birth to them like
a hen that lays eggs each day?..

64
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,547
..You are a thief who
votes illegally..

65
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,342
..by applying oil on your finger
so that the ink doesn't stick..

66
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,094
..are you telling me about the law..

67
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,307
Brother' the party is ready
to give 5'000 for an acre.

68
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,101
Ask them to give 10'000..

69
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,855
..And you' I'll give you
2'000 for an acre..

70
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,608
..sign the documents' keep
your mouths shut and go..

71
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,695
Listen Badrinath !
- Yes Brother.

72
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,613
If we do the registration
in Marripalem..

73
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,116
..the villagers might give
us trouble' so do it here..

74
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,618
..and while fencing the land'
take Loknath also with you..

75
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,995
oK brother.

76
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,788
I will take care of it brother.
- Bhaskar! - Yes brother!

Take all them' give them food'
and throw them into *

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,251
O.K. Brother.

79
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,768
Hi!

80
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,146
Bastard! May his hands
break into pieces!

81
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,945
Are you going to the college?
- Yes!

82
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,741
Which college is it today?
- Any college that is open.

83
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,868
Be careful! Don't go to the
same college everyday..

84
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,745
..someone may get you in trouble..

85
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,207
Good morning brother!
- Come Aaru.

86
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,376
When I sang a song in the temple..

87
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,044
..everyone thought I was a saint..

88
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,797
..after the kidnapping they
must have realied who I am..

89
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,674
..Take this brother. The whole
of Kailaspuram was shocked..

90
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,509
..I left him in Veerraju's
boat itself..

91
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,427
..I asked our people to stay where
they can get the signal..

92
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,222
..If you make a call' the
MLA will stop worrying..

93
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,807
I'll do that.

94
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,684
O.K. then' I'll go.

95
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,689
Take this. - Why all this?
- Keep it for your expenses

96
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,694
What is this? He keeps calling you
brother and sits beside you.

97
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,447
He calls me brother. But l don't
view him as my brother..

98
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,993
..he's just a worker.
But a clever worker.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

100
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,853
Ey Maha!

101
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,857
Why did you beat her? What happened?

102
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,486
She is roaming with
a new man everyday..

103
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,156
..because of girls like her' our
college is spoken of badly..

104
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,742
..I saw her in a car with
an old man of 50..

105
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,786
..as if he was her grandfather..

106
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,622
..Do you come here to study
or to roam around with men?

107
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,042
Yeah' I am a withered flower
and you are a fresh rose..

108
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,962
..Don't I know what you are
selling near the pia hut..

109
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,214
..in the name of Sim cards?

110
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,801
You !
- Leave my dress!

111
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,761
You don't mind it when
men pull your dress..

112
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,347
..You keep on going like this
with a new man everyday..

113
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,350
..When you get sick' they will
put a hoarding saying..

114
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,104
..''The Tigress got AlDS''' and they
will paste your photo beside..

115
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,816
..Be a college girl'
not a call girl..

116
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,360
..If I see you another
time with a man..

117
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,906
..I'll beat you with my
sandal. Be careful.

118
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,602
Hi!
- Who are you? - Sumo.

119
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,646
You came on a cycle and are
calling your Sumo. Mad man.

120
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,607
I told you that my name is Sumo.

121
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,942
Oh ! My name is Ben.

122
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,154
costly vehicle. I like you.

123
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,656
But my maintenance is more.

124
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,159
It's very smooth to drive.

125
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,535
It doesn't give you mileage.

126
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,412
But you are a teenage girl.

127
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,707
oK then.
- She said oK.

128
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:07,379
But to drive the vehicle
will cost 10'000 rupees.

129
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,466
This cannot be our own vehicle. *

130
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,010
This is an all lndia permit vehicle.

131
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,807
Brother! That Brahmin girl with
a half-saree is watching you.

132
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,704
You should not sing like
that looking at me.

133
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,455
But I love you.

134
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,958
Love? How can l believe you?

135
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,712
You don't trust me? Then
I'll sing another song.

136
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,352
Ey! Who are you?
- I am Sumo.

137
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,229
If you are a Sumo' why do you
come and hit my Safari?..

138
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,024
..Go and hit a lorry.
- A lorry?

139
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,444
Leave him! There's a woman with
whom our love can work..

140
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,988
..Look there! Mandapeta Malasri.

141
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,742
Malasri!
- My love!

142
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,479
Hello brother!
- Hello!

143
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,607
Hello! Hello!

144
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,777
Aaru ! I am Badri speaking.
- Yes brother! Tell me.

145
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,946
Today there is a party meeting
in Kanchanapalem..

146
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,074
..we need 400 people..

147
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,742
O.K. Brother! But what should they do?

148
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,827
Nothing! Just to shout slogans.

149
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,663
We have to pay 250 per
person' is it O.K?

150
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,084
Not only that' we need ladies also
to shout at the opposition party.

151
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,502
You just give me a list of
the ones to be shouted at..

152
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,920
..I'll take care of the rest.

153
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,797
Brother! I made idli for
you. Eat and then go.

154
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,340
I am not hungry now.

155
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,884
Don't starve yourself. I'll
send it to you' eat it.

156
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,178
Shastri sir! Did you have
your breakfast? - Yes Aaru.

157
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,514
Sumo! Where were you? I didn't
see you for two days.

158
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,058
The vehicle went for an oil service.

159
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,063
Why did the opposition
members come here?

160
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,565
There's a meeting in the
evening at Kanchanapalem..

161
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,360
..they wanted 50 members to throw
stones and start a fight..

162
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,987
..I asked them to pay 400 per
head and took 5'000 advance..

163
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,031
..one load of stones is also ready.

164
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,908
Will you send diamonds instead?

165
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,368
But sir! Brother called
me just now..

166
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,036
..our people should go there
and shout slogans for them.

167
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:48,248
Is that so?
- We can start off here only and go.

168
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,624
our people are the ones
who will kick..

169
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,292
..and also the ones
who will get kicked.

170
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,800
Roja' Roja. Sound Saroja.

171
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,678
Who is it?
- I am Sumo.

172
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:05,432
You stop there Sunnaposu.
Don't come in. - Why?

173
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,559
If you step into my
house just once..

174
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,354
..you'll tell the whole world
that you touched me 100 times..

175
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,897
What's wrong in that?

176
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,482
But why did you come?

177
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,735
Aaru asked me to bring you.

178
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,447
Who named you Sunnaposu anyway?

179
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,076
I'll tell you. I was 7 months
old in my mother's womb..

180
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,620
..My mother loved fish curry..

181
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:32,625
..When she was eating Mosu
fish she swalloed a thorn..

182
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:37,922
..My father got Sunnapu water to
make her vomit the thorn out..

183
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,591
Did the thorn come out?

184
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:43,303
Thorn did not come out' but
I came out as a 7 month baby.

185
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,221
So you were a premature baby.

186
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,932
So what? I am a clever man..

187
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,560
..my mother named me Mosu
because I was born..

188
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,604
..when she was eating that fish..

189
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,272
..and because I was born because
of Sunnapu water..

190
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,691
..my father named me Sunnapu neelu..

191
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,860
..So there was a clash
between them..

192
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,404
..but later they came to a
compromise and named me..

193
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,867
..Sunnapumosu. But I cut that
short and named myself Sumo..

194
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:11,373
..in the English style. Where
is she? She ran off.

195
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,957
Why did you call me Aaru?

196
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,126
Yes sister. There is a meeting
in the evening..

197
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,254
..you should take the mike and
terrify the opposition party.

198
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,424
You just give me the list. I'll
shout till the mike breaks..

199
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,927
..can I use slang language?

200
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,887
Yeah' like in the movies
you can use some words.

201
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,639
I'll take care of it.

202
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,183
uncle! You don't go to pick up the
thrown footwear like you do..

203
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,018
..otherwise you'll get beaten up.

204
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,395
O.K. Aaru.

205
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,146
Nobody should throw lime stones..

206
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,148
..just use brick stones
and vegetables..

207
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,900
..only Narayana and Gopi will
throw stones on to the stage ..

208
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,444
..if a stone hits sister'
she will shout at..

209
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,987
..you instead of the opposition

210
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:55,208
Good Evening everybody! You
can use a cloth as a towel..

211
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,962
..as a covering' as inner wear'
or whatever you like..

212
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,464
..that is life.

213
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,091
She is good at it.

214
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:07,679
Ey Rajaratnam! When you
don't even know this..

215
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:13,101
..you can't be a leader' you can
sit and grind the batter..

216
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:26,448
..Ey' who's that rascal that
threw the rocket at me?..

217
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,243
..If you have guts' talk
to me face to face..

218
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:35,248
..If you have a mustache on your
face' I have it on my knee..

219
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:42,756
..If you dare this Sound Saroja'
I'll blow off the speakers..

220
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:49,012
..MLA Gangaraju' do you know
where this sex lover..

221
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:55,977
..goes in the midnight? Then
there is Mr. Peddapadora..

222
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,314
..I know that you are
a drunkard' you cheat..

223
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,985
If we keep on listening' Saroja
will never stop. common let's do it.

224
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,826
What do you want?
- Do you have a sim card?

225
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:56,037
I'll show you a new scheme.
It's cheap and best.

226
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,789
How much for a call?

227
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,708
99 paise.

228
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:02,836
For two calls?
- 198.

229
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:08,383
To keep a hand? To keep both hands?

230
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,301
Shut up!

231
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,221
Cousin! come let's go.
- I'll see you later.

232
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:20,311
Why do you need this part time job?
Just enjoy your college.

233
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,856
You will say anything. My father
left me with my uncle..

234
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:26,067
..as a payed guest and
went off to Pune.

235
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,070
What's a payed guest?
ls it not paying guest?

236
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,990
Paying guest is the one who
pays them every month..

237
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,326
..But if we pay for the whole
year' it's a payed guest.

238
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,871
can call it a prepaid card.

239
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,255
Did the old man like the girls?

240
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,842
He liked them very much. He
was in the boat for a week.

241
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,846
Old man is still very energetic.
I shooted everything.

242
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,849
Keep them safely. If he
fights with me saying..

243
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,644
..that I came from Tamilnadu
and settled here..

244
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,107
..I'll publish that in the news.
What are the girls saying?

245
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:09,444
one agreed to it. But the other
is still stubbornly refusing.

246
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:14,866
Now listen. Send the
first girl home. *

247
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:20,372
..Kill the girl who refused to it.

248
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:35,387
..You refused' didn't you? If I
leave you' you'll tell everyone..

249
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,986
Hello Aaru!

250
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,700
Why should you go to Aadi brother?

251
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:01,705
It's an important matter Aaru.
Bheemili babu' Gajuvaka Shankar..

252
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,207
..Poorna market Sheshu'
all of us should go.

253
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,509
Behind Aadi there are Alphonso'
Varada' Gatam..

254
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,137
..Mohammad and 20 others brother.

255
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,212
Ey Aadi! The route you
are taking is wrong.

256
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,215
You are the ones who changed
your route and came.

257
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:58,011
You do * business' smuggling'
assault' murder..

258
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:02,057
..or whatever you like. We will
not interfere in any of them..

259
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:06,227
..But why are you killing girls?
If the public comes to know..

260
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:09,230
..it will become a big issue. If
a report from the lntelligence..

261
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,899
..reaches the higher authorities..

262
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,235
.. we all will be shot like
dogs in an encounter.

263
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:19,657
Are you trying to frighten me?
Don't interfere in my business..

264
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:24,621
..It's not only you but I
too have political support.

265
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:29,626
Here the problem is not of who is
great' it's of life and death.

266
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,004
Listen ! When you killed Jalarapeta
Jayram in my area..

267
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,840
..did I say anything?

268
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:39,260
Aadi! That's different
and this is different.

269
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,929
I'm telling you from my experience..

270
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,348
..girls have no place
in our business.

271
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,892
You shut your mouth !

272
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,435
Why are you threatening him?..

273
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,312
..Do you know how much
experience he has?

274
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:53,066
Ey Vishwanath ! You
need that' I don't.

275
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:56,986
Ey who are you? How dare you
talk disrespectfully to him..

276
00:28:57,153 --> 00:29:00,949
..Who do you think he is? lf you
say another word I'll kill you.

277
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:03,034
Get lost from here you !
You scoundrel.

278
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,578
How dare he talks to you
like that brother..

279
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,455
..You are a pig who
came from Arakona..

280
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,499
..and does business
here with girls..

281
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,793
..And how dare you talk like this?
I'll kill you. Rascal!..

282
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,504
..Ey' I can handle 100
people with one hand..

283
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:18,299
..Do you think you can frighten
me? Are you daring me?..

284
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,803
..If I beat you one' you will
go and fall in Anakapalli. *

285
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,598
If you have guts' come
and fight with me.

286
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,562
Leave me! Leave me!..

287
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,608
..Who is that dog?

288
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,111
He is Aaru. He is the right
hand of Vishwanath.

289
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,325
If you mix DS in the thread
it will be nice.

290
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,744
What is DS?

291
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,914
It's a decent name for Dog Shit.

292
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,126
Is it ready? - Aaru ! Your item is
ready. I'll bring it to you hot' hot.

293
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,628
Yes bring it.

294
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:58,131
..Ey' how are you applying the
mixture to the thread?..

295
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,591
..it's all coming in lumps.

296
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,843
Brother' the seat
is ready' sit down.

297
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,683
Aaru! See! Aadi's men are coming.

298
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,271
Let them come.

299
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,532
Aaru! Aadi asked me to bring you.
- Why?

300
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,868
You are very sharp. So he asked
you to join our group..

301
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,412
..if you don't like the
business of girls..

302
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,124
Aaru! one packet of powder in
Maharashtra is 1 lakh rupees..

303
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,920
..if you can reach that powder
to Bangladesh it is 1 crore..

304
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,674
Aadi told us to tell you that
Vishwanath is just using you..

305
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,843
..and not paying you
what you deserve..

306
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,679
Is Aadi trying to separate
Aaru from brother?..

307
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,765
..Did you all come just
to talk to me?.. - Yes!

308
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,809
Then why did you bring
those weapons?

309
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,394
I didn't bring anything.

310
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,940
Is this not a weapon?

311
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,817
That is for safety.

312
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:02,237
Safety? If this is in hand' is
it safety? Are you safe now?..

313
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:11,079
..I don't want to come. Now
beat me! Beat me! Beat me!

314
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:54,576
Everybody uses flour' glass bits'
lime stone' rock salt so on..

315
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,371
..to make the thread sharp.
But l mix sinide also in it..

316
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:02,125
..if you move a little' even
before your blood comes out..

317
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,922
..you will die. If Aadi is your
leader' brother is my life. Go!

318
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,055
Where are you taking the water?

319
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,098
My aunty's daughter has
come from the village..

320
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,642
..I am taking water
for her to take bath.

321
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:24,606
Ey Sound Saroja' when did
you turn into Water Vanaja?

322
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:29,652
I'll not leave you today.
You keep talking rubbish.

323
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,197
What is it?

324
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,909
The girl who came to Seetalu's
house is taking bath.

325
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,411
Is that so? come let's go.

326
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,914
I'll break your legs.

327
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,797
We should enjoy this beautiful
scene than to fight there.

328
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:54,636
Yes! Even her back is so beautiful.

329
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:58,390
What happened to your speech?

330
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:02,185
I've become speechless. Wow!
Did you see the fountain?..

331
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:08,441
..come let's see from the
hole. See her waist.

332
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:13,822
Brother! Why is there
hair on her legs?

333
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:18,410
If she has hair on her legs' it
means she has a strong body..

334
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:22,497
..My God! Why does she
have a mustache?

335
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:26,376
Brother! He is the fighting master.

336
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,671
Fighting Mater? My Goodness!

337
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,215
What was it?

338
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,093
Just simply.
- What do you mean by simply?

339
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,678
Simply means simply only.

340
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,430
Ey' tell the truth.

341
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:39,848
She is asking you' tell her.

342
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,183
Brother's hen was missing'
so we came to search.

343
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,437
oh' does a hen come
into the bathroom?

344
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,857
Will a hen know what's a bathroom
and what's a kitchen?

345
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,942
Did you see the hen?

346
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,486
We didn't see the hen'
but saw a gorilla..

347
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,989
..you go to your homes' cook
food and feed your husbands.

348
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,743
When you can see a man bathing..

349
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:04,748
..you must have seen when
we all were bathing also..

350
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:27,228
Why is this not working? Water
is coming form that tap..

351
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:34,319
..Just now water came from this.
What happened now?

352
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,243
A man there almost broke
the tap. Mad man !

353
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,500
What's so funny?

354
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,880
He's coming' he's coming.
Hello' yeah !

355
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,256
Ey' who knows that water comes..

356
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,675
..if you put your hand
under the tap?..

357
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,551
..I know that if I put my hand
in' I'll get my knife..

358
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,470
..Did you come here to eat
or to use your phones?..

359
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:01,846
Brother stop! Stop! Leave them.

360
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:05,183
I'm asking them whether they
came to use their phones..

361
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,520
..I am a rowdy' gangster'
who lives on the platform..

362
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,064
..I myself am going home
since it is 10:30..

363
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:13,566
..But you ordered chicken now and
are sitting here leisurely..

364
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:17,320
..by the time it comes' you eat'
and start for home it'll be 2:00..

365
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:22,325
..if you go home at midnight'
how will the country progress..

366
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,702
Look here!

367
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,454
Ssssh ! Where does your father work?

368
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,707
In Pune.

369
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,376
Tell me correctly or I'll give you.

370
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,545
He works there only.

371
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,046
Your father?

372
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:36,798
In the R.T.o office.

373
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,967
To pay for your cell
it will be 2'000..

374
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,887
..then to eat in hotels like this
once a week another 3'000..

375
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,848
..and then your father's expenses..

376
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:47,350
..your mother's expenses' how
much all of this comes to?..

377
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,853
..it means that your father
is taking bribes..

378
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,355
..you are spoiling the
country like this..

379
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,858
..and you blame the rowdys for
the badness in the country..

380
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,360
..Is that fair? Tell
me another thing..

381
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,114
..along with jeans why do
you wear a short top..

382
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,908
..with your stomach showing? If you
lift your hand the hip shows..

383
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,077
..if you sit down the bum shows..

384
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,621
..can't you wear long tops?
If something happens..

385
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:11,124
..you sit and cry saying
Aadi's men have come..

386
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:14,878
..they took us away' and sold
us in Dubai and so on..

387
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,631
..If I see you another
time in a night hotel..

388
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:22,385
..I'll chew Manikchand and
spit it on your face..

389
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,888
..Ey' I am not drunk. I am
seriously asking them..

390
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:28,641
..I am a big actor myself' and
they are acting before me..

391
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:33,980
He insulted us so much.

392
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:39,027
He spoke too much' but
spoke correctly.

393
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,571
Shastri! Did brother
send in the money?

394
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:43,615
Thank you very much Aaru.

395
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,826
Keep giving me work like this.
I'll come even for an assault.

396
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,455
Did you listen. The old man is
ready to come for an assault.

397
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,415
I have two grown up girls..

398
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,169
..only if I have money I can
marry them off to someone..

399
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,174
Aaru' I'll send 3'000 to my wife.

400
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,093
O.K.
- Thank you.

401
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,303
Shastri! Didn't your wife
leave you and go?

402
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,640
She couldn't bear with my
drinking and chattering..

403
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,435
..so she went off. I am one of
those good-for-nothing men..

404
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,440
..at a school going age l started
drinking and smoking..

405
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,943
..always used to get shoutings
from my parents..

406
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:24,948
..now even my wife left me and
is taking money every month.

407
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,826
Hello!
- Yes brother!

408
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,494
There's a small problem at the
home of an acquaintance..

409
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,162
..of our auditor.

410
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,580
I'll take care of it.

411
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,635
Why is this girl here?
- Whom do you want?

412
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,680
Tell them that Aaru has come.
- I asked your name not a number.

413
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:51,891
It's shortcut is Aaru.
Go and tell.

414
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,103
Tell me.

415
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:58,690
My daughter is studying
in the medical college..

416
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:03,737
..In the name of dating' foolishly
she went with a boy..

417
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:08,742
..on his bike. on the way the
bike met with an accident..

418
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:12,495
..the bike hit an old lady
and she died on the spot..

419
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,249
..at the police station the boy
gave my daughter's name too..

420
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,752
..if others come to know of this..

421
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,254
..my family's reputation
will be ruined..

422
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,469
come on' get down.

423
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:33,767
How dare you? Will you cheat
a girl who trusted you?..

424
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,269
..Are you a man?

425
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:37,812
That girl came with me.

426
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,981
There is a way for
doing everything..

427
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:43,193
..if a girl gets involved
in a case..

428
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,695
..it's good sense on your part
not to take her name in that..

429
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,489
I also have men with me.

430
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:50,033
Who's that? Will you speak
to Maddelapalem Shankar?..

431
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,535
..call him up. Will you
speak or shall I speak?..

432
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,038
..I'll cut you into two and throw
you on the raiway track..

433
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:57,540
..Are you both his parents?..

434
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:00,043
..Why did you leave your
son to the roads?..

435
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,671
..I'll break your bones to pieces..

436
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,257
..I'm keeping quite because
a girl is involved..

437
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:09,511
..otherwise I would have
shown you all who I am..

438
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,262
Babu ! Tell uncle to
tear the old FIR..

439
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,807
..make this fellow change
the name and sign it..

440
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:17,852
O.K. Aaru !
- Now you all go from here. Wait!..

441
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,397
..Will you forget this matter
and come to fight again..

442
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,191
..or shall I give you some marks
so that you wont forget it?

443
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,026
That is not necessary.

444
00:41:25,193 --> 00:41:27,570
We'll see to it that
it never happens.

445
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,114
O.K. Go!..

446
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:35,078
Sir! I want to speak to your
daughter for a second..

447
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,580
..don't worry she's like my sister..

448
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:41,334
..If you try to become
extra social..

449
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:45,088
..you'll end up ruining your
parents name like this..

450
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,590
..see how pained they are'
and see their tears..

451
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,093
..in this world the only ones
who will never cheat us..

452
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:53,847
..are our parents' trust them'
don't trust anyone else..

453
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,349
..this is your brother's advice.

454
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,815
Shastri! * Aaru was mind-blowing..

455
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:09,571
..he said that they are pained'
they are crying and so on..

456
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,574
..Boss! If you sit at
the village panchayat..

457
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:15,118
..you'll look like Venkatesh
in Chinababu..

458
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:17,620
..and like Mohanraj in Pedarayudu..

459
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,165
Ey' tell me what dating is..

460
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,584
I know about setting'
fitting' cutting..

461
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,586
..who know's what a dating is.

462
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:28,840
Ey Sitapati! come here.
What is this dating?

463
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:33,887
If a girl and a boy sit on a bike
tightly holding each other..

464
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,389
..go to the beach' play
in the water together..

465
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:38,892
..then change clothes
in the same room..

466
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,394
..and come back without doing
anything' that's dating.

467
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,439
This sounds worse than raping.

468
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:48,193
Did you date anyone?
- No sir!

469
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,445
What will you do in your
life without all of this?

470
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:53,865
Should I tell you?
- Yeah' tell me.

471
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,409

house in that place..

475
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:09,631
..I'll send my son to
Don Bosco School..

476
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,634

478
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:17,681
..where he will earn

479
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,475
..when he becomes 29..

480
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,644

a pension of 8'000 rupees..

483
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,193

..Singapore' Malaysia..

486
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:36,741
What is this? He's eating
our brains with numbers.

487

Not only that' I'll buy a place
in my home town Ambajipeta..

488
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:43,123
..and state in my will to bury
me there and die at 72.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

490
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:09,366
Be careful!
- What are you doing?

491
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,165
Father needs 200 rupees' so
l am giving my bangles.

492
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,750
Won't I give you' if you ask me?

493
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,753
How many times should
l ask you Aaru?

494
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,421
That's enough..

495
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:27,217
..Ey' tell Shastri to give
him some money. - oK.

496
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,558
Keep quite. You have no other
work. If you want you go.

497
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:38,061
Excuse me! I want to meet Aaru.

498
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,855
Who? The number six? Just joking.
It's that house.

499
00:49:41,022 --> 00:49:45,902
How can you take money like
this whenever you want?

500
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:48,488
Ey' how come you are here?

501
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:51,783
I've come for you. There's
a small problem.

502
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:54,285
What's the problem?

503
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:55,704
Sir! Sir!

504
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,290
Listen. If we do like this' we
can't sell more than 3 cards a day..

505
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:03,753
..just tell them we have a VIP
number' they'll take it..

506
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,880
But we have to pay 10'000
for such numbers.

507
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:08,049
We won't tell them that..

508
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:10,593
..later we can call them and say
that the number is already allotted..

509
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,096
..if we plead them' they will
take another number..

510
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:14,472
Is it O.K?

511
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,310
ls it 00001? 1 is my family number.
I'll surely take it.

512
00:50:19,477 --> 00:50:21,146
Now what's the problem?

513
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:23,106
He put a case in the
consumer court..

514
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,608
..that he wants the same number.

515
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:28,653
They got to know this in the
office' and suspended her.

516
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:32,490
Now the case is on me.
only you can help me.

517
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:35,744
Aaru ! Are you handling
ladies cases also now?

518
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,245
You keep quite.

519
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:39,497
The boss is lucky for girls now.

520
00:50:39,664 --> 00:50:41,166
You wait.

521
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:45,628
Ey' do you know we are rowdys?

522
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,589
We cut with the blade
and beat with the belt.

523
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,133
We drink the acid
and spit it on you.

524
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:53,511
Take the case back. otherwise..

525
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:57,599
Boss! That girl is coming
running like a horse.

526
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,601
I don't know why she is coming..

527
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,019
..What is it?

528
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,104
He lodged a complaint against
me in the police..

529
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:05,648
..saying that l threatenend
him with rowdys..

530
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,526
..the police is searching
for me. Please save me.

531
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:11,363
Ey' what did you all do?
- We just threatened him Aaru.

532
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:14,783
Kill him and throw him away. Then
he'll come to his senses.

533
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,043
Will you send rowdys onto me?

534
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,129
Hello sir!.. ..How are you sir?

535
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:31,383
Boss! He is that fellow.
- What's your problem?

536
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:35,970
It's a number problem. l will not
leave 1' even if my life goes. - Why?

537
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:39,391
Because it's sentimental. My name

..not only that I have just 1
wife and just 1 time a day..

542
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:54,572
What do you do?

543
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:58,159
I kiss her. Should I tell you more?

544
00:51:58,326 --> 00:51:59,577
Enough ! Enough !..

..on all the taxis in the city.
This fellow should not sleep.

555
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:35,739
What's that?
- You deserve it.

556
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:39,826
I'm getting bored. Dial that 00001.
- O.K.

557
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:41,453
Hello! Who is this?

560

Wrong number?

My stomach is burning..

562
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:51,046
..can you please come
and put off the fire?

563
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:52,547
No it's not.

00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,507
Then it must be the
ambulance service..

565
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:57,719
..I got an attack in the dream
yesterday' come and take me.

566

00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,501
..Hello! How come you are here?

Why do we come to a hotel? To
eat. How come you're here?

573
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:35,757
l have a VlP number 00006..

574
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:40,804
..Since your name
is Aaru meaning 6..

575
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:42,764
..I thought you can take that..

576
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:48,269
Ey keep quiet! You never returned
the money I gave you.

577
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,230
I thought you gave
it to me as a gift.

578
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:53,274
lf you don't return it to
me' see what I'll do..

579
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:54,943
..Ey' if she doesn't

00:53:58,446 --> 00:54:02,075
..I'll give you a treat today.
Tell me what you'll eat.

583
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,869
Except for table' chair and the
server' we eat everything.

584
00:54:05,036 --> 00:54:08,289
Ey' why is Maha taking so long
to speak to your brother?

585
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,708
Brother?

586
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:12,794
That day he called himself
your brother naa. - Oh!

587
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:18,299
I always see you eating in hotels.
Don't you have a home?

588
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:22,095
I'm studying M.A Phsycology.

589
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,597
..I stay as a paying guest
in my uncle's house..

590
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:26,057
We are orphans without parents..

591
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:27,809

592
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,561
He is scared boss!

Why are you scared? I am with
you. Who'll touch you?

594
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:35,817
Aaru ! Govindu' Govindu.

00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:37,819
Where?
- At the right side table.

596
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:39,904
Which colour shirt?
- Rose colour shirt.

597
00:54:40,238 --> 00:54:42,490
Is his name Govindu.
- No. - You called him so.

598
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,576
We call the person we are
kidnapping with that name.

599
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:47,412
Kidnapping? Will you fight also?
I'll tell my friends and come.

600
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:48,997
You keep silent..

601
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,541
..Did he sit down? You start
the vehicle and be ready..

602
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,501
..You take the ones on the right..

603
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,337
..I'll take the Govindu who's
in the centre. Is that O.K?

604
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,088
one minute. I have a camera
in my cell phone..

605
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,090
..can I shoot all this?

606
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:00,842
See' this girl wants to
prepare the evidence..

607
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,386
..keep quite..
- ..common let's go..

608
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,615
Superb!

609
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,367
Two thousand' three hundred..

610
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:27,535
Brother! ln our centre one
police man is stopping..

611
00:55:27,702 --> 00:55:29,621
..the vehicles and taking bribes..

612
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:31,623
Let him take. Why worry?

613
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,375
Why are you talking senselessly?..

614
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,043
..if we shoot that
with this camera..

615
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,128
..and give it to the commissioner..

616
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:38,546
..we will become famous.

617
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:39,964
Then let's go.

618
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:42,133
Sumo! Don't go. Don't play
games with the police..

619
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,678
..it's like going in top
gear and hitting a wall.

620
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,304
Why are you talking like a child?..

621
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:48,390
..if everyone takes bribes like
this' what will happen to India?..

622
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:51,226
..should we just see
them and sit quite?

623
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,853
It's of no use.

624
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:56,231
How can I leave him when
l have the evidence?

625
00:55:56,398 --> 00:56:00,902
come brother!
- Don't go!

626
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:04,656
Please let me go sir!

627
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,576
Give something and go!

628
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:12,163
Did you shoot it? Very good!..

629
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,959
..How are you Meesalarathnam?

630
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,461
Are you calling me by my name?
- Yes!

631
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:19,838
I am the traffic inspector.

632
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:22,507
So what? is that not your name?
- You !!!

633
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,676
After taking a bribe you
should not shout..

634
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:28,471
..don't act like a hero' after
we found out your weakness..

635
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:30,974
..we shooted you while taking
bribes from people..

636
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,476
..tomorrow for the festival
we will release it..

637
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,853
Did you shoot me?

638
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,440
Yes. Why do you take 2 rupees
from a lorry fellow..

639
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:40,984
..and take 50 rupees from
the one with a bike?

640
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,527
It's not like that..

641
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,947
..the lorry fellow should stop at
every signal and give money..

642
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:48,491
..but the bike fellows we
get rarely' that's why..

643
00:56:48,616 --> 00:56:50,994
Oh' is there so much logic to it?

644
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,620
Ey' you shut your mouth.

645
00:56:52,787 --> 00:56:54,706
Why are you scolding
him unnecessarily?..

646
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:57,250
..if a man is coming on the bike'
you ask for the license..

647
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,753
..if he shows you' you
ask for the Rc book..

648
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:02,255
..if he shows that too' you
ask for the insurance..

649
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,758
..then you ask him why he
came in the one way..

650
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:07,260
..if he says it's not the one way..

651
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:11,014
..you say that he's driving
too fast. lsn't that so?

652
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,932
Are you the one who brought
the camera on rent?

653
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,726
Yes sir!
- You forgot the cassette.

654
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:18,021
Brother! Nothing has been recorded.

655
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:20,982
Ey' now I'll see you.

656
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:24,319
There was a technical problem.
Sorry for all that..

657
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:25,987
..please don't do anything..

658
00:57:26,154 --> 00:57:29,240
You spoke such rubbish to me
and now you are begging me..

659
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:31,201
..beat him nicely.

660
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,793
If it was somebody else'
we wouldn't have come..

661
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,169
..but Nath and co. is different'
that's why we came..

662
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:43,505
They might be famous in Eluru..

663
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:48,551
..but during elections' business
men like bear their expenses..

664
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,305
Achyut Rao! Do you know
the story of the crow?

665
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,475
Yes! Is it the one where
it steals the bread?

666
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,771
No. It's the one where the
crow cheats the fox..

667
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:03,566
..the crow which stole the
bread sat on a tree..

668
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:07,320
..and it made fun of the fox..

669
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:09,823
..will the infuriated
fox keep quite..

670
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:14,828
..in order to take revenge it
killed the fox with a knife..

671
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:28,049
..go and tell them that Vishwanath
killed Achyut Rao..

672
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:29,801
..go and tell everyone..

673
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,887
I did not come here. I did not
see anything. I'm going.

674
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:43,565
Ey' call Aaru..No' let it be.
He'll talk of justice..

675
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:47,485
..call Bhaskar' and ask
him to clear it up.

676
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,828
Madam! We need seven
cards for our office.

677
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,372

Why is your friend going
with men of Aadi's group?

684
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,856

..before they take
her into the boat..

693
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:49,923
..otherwise the girl's
life will be ruined.

Who is it?
- Aadi! I am Aaru here.

700
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,479
Who are you Aaru?

701
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:06,147

Your men kidnapped a
girl that I know..

01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,584
Ey Aadi! What are you saying?

709

..Tell him not to come
here. Stop him..

711
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,429
..otherwise I'll kill him.

712
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:39,097
Brother! When that fellow from
Tamil Nadu is kidnapping girls..

713
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:41,182
..should I just tie my
hands and sit down..

are you going there?

715

Brother! I know that girl very
well. I'll surely go there.

716
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:54,362
Leave him brother! Let him die.

..and our reputation
will be spoiled.

721
01:01:04,205 --> 01:01:08,043
No brother! He has become
very proud. He should die.

722
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:11,212
Badri! Viag shivers when
they hear of Nath and co..

723
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:14,966
..If one of our men get assaulted..

724
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:18,720
..people will stop fearing us.

725
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:22,474
Aadi! I'll come in a little while
after Aaru comes there..

726
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,227

736
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:10,021
Ey Aaru ! Aaru !

737
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:13,775
Brother! Who is he to kidnap the
girl? Ask him to leave her.

738
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:19,114
Ey Aadi! First leave that girl.
We'll talk about the rest later.

739
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:21,616

..You always interfere in my work..

742

First you send that girl.
She is a friend of Aaru..

743
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,132
This girl must have slept
with him when he needed..

744
01:02:37,298 --> 01:02:38,800
..and must have went
around with him..

745
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,301
..now if you call her a close
friend' should we leave her?

746
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:42,554
Ey' if you speak rubbish about that
girl' I'll break your bones.

747
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:45,390
Aaru wait!

748
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,559
Tell him brother.

You've come from Arakona
to Viag to live here..

750
01:02:50,228 --> 01:02:51,730
..and you are daring us..

751
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:53,148
..even after telling you

752
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:54,566
..why are behaving stubbornly?

753
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:58,820
There is no happiness without
peace' so don't get angry..

754
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:06,369
..say that she is your sister'
or say that she is your wife..

755
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:11,750
..Then I'll leave her. otherwise
l won't leave her come what may..

756
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,294
..common start the boat now..

757
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:18,173
Aaru ! Stop!

758
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,619
She is like my wife..

759
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:24,239
It's already late. Don't
go here and there..

760
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:27,659
..This is your house' isn't it?

Go. Hey give me the chain back..

762
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:41,423
It's a gold chain. Give it.

763
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,940
Go now.

764
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:13,955
Why did you get so angry Aaru?

765
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:16,875
How can we keep quite when someone
we know is in need..

766

me food one day' that's why..

Ey Subramanyam! How are you?..

770
01:11:17,318 --> 01:11:19,320
..oh he is not Subramanyam!

771
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:24,325
You idiot! How dare you? Do you
have to hit and talk to me..

772
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:27,245
..now I'll hit you..

773
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,919
..you donkey..

774
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:44,679
He beat you mercilessly'
and you kept quite.

775
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:48,099
He was not beating me.
This is a treatment.

776
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,517
What treatment?

777
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:53,104
've been eating potatoes
from three days..

778
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:55,106
..so my back started aching..

..he hit my back' and treated me..

781
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:01,863
That means' you ask and get
beaten up by everyone..

782
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,366
Then what? can anyone touch
me without my permission?

783
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:05,950
Are you speaking the truth?

784
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:08,119
Don't talk senselessly.
Will I say lies..

785
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:10,622
..if you get neck pain' go to
Guntur and fight with someone..

786
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:14,376
..he will beat on your neck'

..and fight with someone' he
will make you lie down and ..

789
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:26,346
..stamp you mercilessly. The
gas in your stomach will go..

790
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,473
..and your face will become fresh..

791
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,393
..if you have leg pain'
go to Kurnool..

792
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,396
..they will take sticks
and beat you on legs..

793
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:36,231
..your leg pain will vanish..

794
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:39,651
..suppose you go to Putthoor'
and fight with someone..

795
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:43,530
..when they start beating you'
your body will get a massage..

796
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:48,493
..but don't go to Ananthapur'

797
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,913
..but in this matter' Telugu

..even if they beat you to death..

799
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:56,918

..I had to tell them so many things.

802
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:06,928
Shastri! Do you think
he spoke the truth?

803
01:13:08,346 --> 01:13:10,682

01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,516
..Listen ! Any four of you come
to the police station..

825
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:38,603
..come' come' let's go' quick..

826
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:42,357
They cheated us and took him away..

827
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,777
We should cut him into two. We
asked him save our brother..

828
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:48,279
..but he beat him and
brought him home..

829
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:52,367
Let him come' we'll ask him..

830
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,536
..Jaga! You go in.

831
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:58,623
He gets paid from us' and he
beats up our own brother..

832
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:00,375
..we should not leave him..

833
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,711
Brother! I am sorry brother..

834
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,130
..Don't misunderstand me
for hitting our brother..

835
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:07,048
..I didn't know another way..

836
01:15:07,215 --> 01:15:09,050
..If it was some student'
we could have managed it..

837
01:15:09,217 --> 01:15:10,802
..but since it was a teacher'
it became a big problem..

838
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:13,304
..if the police came
and arrested him..

839
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:15,807
..he couldn't have come
out before 15 days..

840
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:19,561
..I told brother to say sorry'
but he refused to do so..

841
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:25,817
..that is why' to save him'
l had to beat him. Brother!

842
01:15:26,317 --> 01:15:28,319
What you did is correct' Aaru !

843
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,321
Brother Badri! Speak to our lawyer..

844
01:15:30,488 --> 01:15:32,407
..and arrange for a bail
beforehand itself..

845
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,243
only when I leave him'
you can bail him out.

846
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,329
Hello' Brother-in-law!
When did you come?..

847
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:39,748
..Did sister come along with you?..

848
01:15:39,914 --> 01:15:41,583
..Where is she? ls she
in the Kitchen?..

849
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,002
..Sister! Sister!

850
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:47,088
What is this? You have let that
servant come into the house..

851
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:49,591
..and now he is going
into the kitchen too.

852
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,345
only when we let the servant in'
he'll clean the house.

853
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,847
In my 15 years of service..

854
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,350
..nobody dared to call
me Brother-in-law..

855
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,852
..even behind my back..

856
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:03,355
..and now that fellow is calling
me so' on my face..

857
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,857
..Is he a cousin of mine'
or did he marry my sister?

858
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:09,611
He is calling my sister as sister..

859
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,530
You always keep talking
about fights.

860
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:14,616
You were sent to Vijayawada' so
that you wouldn't know all this..

861
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:16,034
..Isn't that so?

862
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,536
I heard that you beat
the younger brother.

863
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:20,205
It's nothing like that.

864
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:23,375
If they had got married' at the right
age' they wouldn't be like this..

865
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,877
..older brother is above 45 now'
but still not married..

866
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:28,380
..he is craving for money'
position' power..

867
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:30,882
..and thinks that being a gangster
is the only thing there is.

868
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,884
Don't say anything wrong
about brother..

869
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,636
..Do you know how many
people he is feeding?..

870
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:38,390
lnstead of eating food like this'
it is better to starve and die.

871
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,892
Then why did you give me food?..

872
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,395
..when I came here as
a 13 year old orphan..

873
01:16:43,561 --> 01:16:45,230
..brother asked me
to clean his car..

874
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:48,400
..you realied that l was
hungry and gave me food.

875
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:53,405
Yes' on that day you came here
as a good boy' but now.

876
01:16:53,571 --> 01:16:57,158
Yeah scold me more. You
have the right to do so.

877
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:02,497
Brother! Shastri did not even pay
the balance in the tea stall.

878
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,417
Good Morning Aaru !
- Why did you come here?

879
01:17:07,335 --> 01:17:12,173
l always think of you. Maybe l'm
in love with you. - What?..

880
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,676
..Ey Pandu ! You go and ask
Vasantha if ldli is ready..

881
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,178
..and then bring it here.
- oK' brother!

882
01:17:18,596 --> 01:17:22,183
l'm telling you the truth.
l love you.

883
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:25,937
This love and all is very
attractive to look at..

884
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:28,440
..but there's nothing in it..

885
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:30,942
..even if someone is
vommitting beside..

886
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:33,445
..we can eat our food
very comfortably..

887
01:17:33,611 --> 01:17:35,947
..in just a small room
over 15 of us sleep..

888
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:38,450
..we are 20 of us' but we
use the same toilet..

889
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:40,952
..will you bear all that..

890
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,788
..you are just impressed by my
fights and all' don't call it love..

891
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,373
..go from here.

892
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:49,711
l don't know why you put that
chain on me that day..

893
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,213
..but l think of it as
a sign of marriage..

894
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,798
..after that l came
to realie that..

895
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:56,634
..l am not a Pune girl'
but a Pulivandela girl..

896
01:17:56,801 --> 01:17:58,470
..even if l have grown up eating
in expensive crockery..

897
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:02,223
..l can eat in an alluminium
plate and sleep on a mat..

898
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,726
..with the man l am in love.

899
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:08,480
Ey' what is this sentiment
of marriage and all..

900
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:11,399
..only if it's a turmeric thread
it's a sign of marriage..

901
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:14,736
..where do they marry
with a gold chain?..

902
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:18,490
..similary they kept you with them..

903
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:20,992
..l brought you back with
a gold chain. That's all..

904
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:24,162
..not only that' we
all are bad men here.

905
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,997
How can you call yourself
a bad man?..

906
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,415
..Did you rape someone?

907
01:18:27,582 --> 01:18:31,670
Ey!
- Did you murder anyone? - No!

908
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,922
Then how can you be a bad man?..

909
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:36,007
..you are a very courageous'
good fool..

910
01:18:36,174 --> 01:18:38,927
l'll smash your face if
you call me a fool..

911
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:43,515
Yes' you call yourself a rowdy
because you are brave..

912
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:46,768
..others are using
your foolishness..

913
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,771
..you just give me the good
man who is in between..

914
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:53,525
..otherwise give me a valid
reason' then l'll go.

915
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:56,027
l don't trust girls who wear jeans.

916
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:59,280
Then why did you save this
girl who was in jeans?..

917
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:01,616
..lf you doubt my virginity'
tell me..

918
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:03,535
..l'll go and get tested
from a doctor..

919
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:06,287
..and bring the certificate and
show it to you.. - Shut up!

920
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:09,791
lf l wish l can start wearing
sarees any time..

921
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:13,545
..l can go into the kitchen and
cook brinjal curry for you..

922
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:16,047
..but can you change?

923
01:19:16,214 --> 01:19:17,882
Ey' be careful!

924
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:19,801
oK' you don't have to change..

925
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:23,555
..l like you as the rowdy
who saved my life..

926
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:28,977
..without knowing whether you'll
get it back' you gave me 10'000..

927
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:32,313
..when they were 20
men on each side..

928
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,233
..only you stood up
for me and saved me..

929
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,736
..and finally you put
the chain on me..

930
01:19:37,902 --> 01:19:39,821
..held my hand and took
me along with you..

931
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,740
..that was not an ordinary touch..

932
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:44,826
..there were affection'
friendship' honesty..

933
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:47,912
..courage' and everything in it..

934
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,165
..as we were coming
back in the car..

935
01:19:50,331 --> 01:19:53,585
..l thought that l'll spend the
rest of my life with you..

936
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:56,504
..only when you dropped me home
and asked for the chain..

937
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,590
..l realied that it was not true..

938
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:01,676
..that moment l decided that
l will make you mine..

939
01:20:01,843 --> 01:20:03,595
What are you talking? Didn't l
tell you it's not possible?..

940
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:06,097
..Go from here. Don't
come back to this area.

941
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:19,027
Good Morning Sir!

942
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:22,364
Hello Sir!

943
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:26,368
What happened?

944
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:29,871
There's a problem between
the cM and me..

945
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:31,790
..the matter is still
under discussion..

946
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:33,208
Without you?

947
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,627
The problem is regarding me.
- Regarding you?

948
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:37,379
They are going to dismiss me today.

949
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:38,797
What are you saying?

950
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:41,132
Evening at 4:00' the news
that l lost my position..

951
01:20:41,299 --> 01:20:43,635
..will come in the news..

952
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,554
..Before 8:00 l want
that position back..

953
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:49,891
..You should help me for that..

954
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:51,893
l did not understand.

955
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,728
lmmediately after the flash
news comes in the TV..

956
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:55,647
..there should be fights
here and there..

957
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,816
..throwing stones' shutting
down the shops..

958
01:20:57,982 --> 01:20:59,901
..burning the buses should happen..

959
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:02,737
..most important' 5 people should
burn themselves to death..

960
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:06,157
..the families of those 5' will
be paid as much as they want after..

961
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:11,496
..seeing all this' the terrified
cM should give me my seat back.

962
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:16,167
Loknath !
- Yes brother!

963
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:17,752
Send a word to Aaru.

964
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:21,631
After the news' shops in all
areas should be shut down..

965
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:24,092
..ln chinnavalteru and
Poorna Market areas..

966
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,510
..rickshaws should be burnt down..

967
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:27,512
..ln Simhachalam and
Kothapeta areas..

968
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,264
..two buses should be burnt..

969
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,349
..From * to Jagadamba centre..

970
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:34,019
..everybody on the road
should be stoned..

971
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:36,187
oK' l'll arrange men for that.

972
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:38,690
Most important thing is..

973
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:41,192
..5 people should burn
themselves to death..

974
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,695
..in front of the party office..

975
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:46,197
..we'll pay them as
much as they want..

976
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:48,950
Burning themselves? But why?

977
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:05,300
Are you thinking that they should
really burn themselves?

978
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:07,927
Yes! - l just meant to say that
they should act as if..

979
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:09,304
..they are burning themselves.

980
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,222
Then it's O.K.

981
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:14,976
When they pour gasoline
on themselves and act..

982
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,479
..as if they are going
to burn themselves..

983
01:22:17,645 --> 01:22:19,981
..the police will come
and arrest them..

984
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:23,735
oK. - That's all. All this
will be just a fake.

985
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:26,237
oK then' l'll take care of it..

986
01:22:26,404 --> 01:22:28,740
..l thought that you really wanted
them to burn themselves..

987
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:31,242
..but the expenses will be
a little more brother..

988
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:33,745
..because there's a risk of police
arrest and 15 days prison.

989
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:37,832
That's oK Aaru. We'll pay
each one 15'000 rupees.

990
01:22:37,999 --> 01:22:40,001
oK then' l'll go.

991
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:45,006
Why did you tell him that
it's just a fake?

992
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,509
We did a mistake. We shouldn't
have asked Aaru..

993
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:50,011
..to arrange men to
burn themselves..

994
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:52,514
..but we can't ask anybody
else to arrange..

995
01:22:52,681 --> 01:22:55,767
..Ey Bhaskar! can you
arrange for men..

996
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:57,519
lt's difficult to arrange
by evening brother.

997
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:58,937
Yeah !..

998
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:01,856
..Did you hear that? That's why
l changed my plan.. - How?

999
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,526
Ey Bhaskar!
- Yes brother!

1000
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,904
Mix petrol in the gasoline cans
that they will take with them..

1001
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:10,031
..when they pour that
on themselves and act..

1002
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:12,867
..you burn them without
anybody noticing you..

1003
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:15,620
..Aaru will think that
it was an accident..

1004
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:18,790
..the families of the dead
ones will cry for a while..

1005
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:21,626
..but when we pay them'
they'll keep quite..

1006
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:25,714
..because they all are
beggers and orphans..

1007
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,217
But why should we take such a big
risk and help that minister?

1008
01:23:29,467 --> 01:23:33,805
Badri! ln that minister's hands
there are departments such as..

1009
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,725
..real estate' registrations
and so on..

1010
01:23:36,891 --> 01:23:41,980
..lf the cM kicks him out' he
will surely take Bhanumurthy..

1011
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:45,066
..who is our enemy' he
will not let us earn..

1012
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,569
..and will not let what
we have earned to stay..

1013
01:23:47,736 --> 01:23:50,739
..after that we have to change
the board of Nath and co..

1014
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:53,825
..and sell cheap things
to earn a living..

1015
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:59,497
..everything should happen
as l planned it.

1016
01:23:59,664 --> 01:24:01,666
l have work for you all'
will tell you later..

1017
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,586
oK Aaru !
- Aaru' everything is oK..

1018
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:07,589
..but you didn't tell me who
will burn themselves..

1019
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,091
Yeah' l'll tell you. Write
down our old man's name..

1020
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:11,676
..he can use the money
for Latha's marriage..

1021
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:14,304
Thanks Aaru ! With 15'000 l
can marry off one girl..

1022
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:17,098
..We'll do it. come let's go.

1023
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:20,268
Yes sir!

1024
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:22,604
O.K write his name.

1025
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,440
..Raju you said you have to pay the
college fees of your brother.

1026
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:28,276
Write his name.
- oK! - Thanks Aaru !

1027
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:30,111
What are you murmuring?

1028
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:33,865
15'000 is a big sum. lf l send
it to mother' she'll be happy..

1029
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:36,701
..she wrote me that she
is facing difficulties.

1030
01:24:36,868 --> 01:24:38,870
oK' oK!.. ..Shastri'

1031
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,288
Thanks Aaru !

1032
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:43,875
Aaru' l'll be the 5th person..

01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,045
cha! lf you want take
it from the account..

1034
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,214
..why do you want to do all this?..

1035
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,716
..all this not suit your age'
and the food you eat.

1036
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:53,885
lf l take from the account'
l should return it..

1037
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,470
..this is a very good opportunity..

1038
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,639
..if l send this big
amount to my wife..

1039
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:00,141
..maybe she will change her
mind and come back to me.

1040
01:25:00,308 --> 01:25:05,146
oK then ! until you don't do it'
you wouldn't know how hard it is.

1041
01:25:06,898 --> 01:25:10,902
Ey' what is this? What
do you think of me?..

1042
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,654
..Sister' see how she is behaving..

1043
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:14,072
..ls she a girl? chase
her away from here.

1044
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,408
Ey' what is it? Just because
we've left you..

1045
01:25:16,574 --> 01:25:18,910
..when you were friendly with him..

1046
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:21,746
..you think you can
come and kiss him?..

1047
01:25:21,913 --> 01:25:25,417
..Don't you have shame?
Get lost from here.

1048
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:27,002
Shameless girl.

1049
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:30,922
Get lost! or l'll slap you on
your face with my sandal.

1050
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:32,674
Leave her' sister!

1051
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,510
Don't show your face anymore.

1052
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:58,033
Revenue Minister' Mr.
Venkataramaya..

1053
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:00,201
..has been removed from his post..

1054
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:03,288
..the cM has announced this

01:26:15,383 --> 01:26:17,719
..Shastri! l'll call you up later.

1060
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,554
Ey Murthy! Why are you still here?

1061
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:22,140
l have to take my wife to the
hospital for a check-up?

1062
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:24,392
l'll send him after we come
back from the hospital.

1063
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:25,810
oK! come back soon.

1064
01:26:25,977 --> 01:26:27,228
Aaru !
- What is it?

1065
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:29,731
l want to tell you
an important thing.

1066
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,483
Tell me quickly.

1067
01:26:31,649 --> 01:26:35,987
lt was not the girls mistake.
lt was our mistake.

1068
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:37,739
What are you saying?

1069
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:40,241
Yesterday..

1070
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:41,910
Tell me what happened?

1071
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:50,251
Wait a minute! Do you really
love Aaru? - Yes!

1072
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:51,670
He was saying that girls like you..

1073
01:26:51,836 --> 01:26:53,338
..come dressed up beautifully
and pass time for a few days..

1074
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:54,756
..and then disappear from here..

1075
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:57,759
He told us that he
will believe you..

1076
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:01,930
..if you hug him tightly and kiss
him in front of everyone.

1077
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:09,020
Why did you do that? You rascals!

1078
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:12,774
Shameless creatures! You made us
to insult her without reason..

1079
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:15,610
..senselss idiots.

1080
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:18,196
We thought of doing good to Aaru.

1081
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:19,781
Shut up!

1082
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:22,784
Men like us get married only if
we forcefully bring someone..

1083
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:25,286
..or take in a girl
left by someone..

1084
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:29,040
..but when you got
such a good girl..

1085
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:31,042
..you must marry her Aaru.

1086
01:27:31,209 --> 01:27:33,461
Even a wife wouldn't like it
if her husband is a rowdy..

1087
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,296
..but this girl liked
you as a rowdy..

1088
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:38,133
..because she did not
want to loose you..

1089
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:40,301
..Sister' if Aaru did not
have anything in mind..

1090
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,804
..why did he fight with
Aadi's men for her?..

1091
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,222
..you ask him..

1092
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:46,975
Till you have the gold chain with
you' you won't value it..

1093
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:50,729
..only when you loose it'
you'll realie it's value.

1094
01:27:56,234 --> 01:28:02,824
l also like her. But if something
happens to me tomorrow..

1095
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:05,326
..she'll be on the road.

1096
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:08,246
Aaru' we treated her very badly..

1097
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:11,583
..if she swallows something
and kills herself..

1098
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,085
..you too will be on the road..

1099
01:28:14,252 --> 01:28:16,588
..Go Aaru ! Go and speak
to that girl..

1100
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:19,841
..l'm feeling very bad
that l beat her.

1101
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:21,926
But now l have to go
to the party office.

1102
01:28:22,093 --> 01:28:26,598
We'll take care of all that.
You go! Go Aaru !

1103
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:45,617
Maha! Maha!

1104
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:48,203
Ey' who are you? What do you want?
- Where is Maha?

1105
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:52,040
Who are you?
- l am her husband. Maha!

1106
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:54,125
Ey' Wait!

1107
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:56,044
l'll call you late. Keep the phone..

1108
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:58,296
..Maha! Maha!..

1109
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:05,804
..Maha! Please forgive me.

1110
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:29,911
lt's wrong to beat you
and insult you..

1111
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,663
..but it's not my mistake..

1112
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:34,582
..you kissed me' and what
you did was wrong..

1113
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:37,085
..l'm not one of those who
jump with happiness..

1114
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,504
..when some girl comes
and hugs them..

1115
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:42,924
..l got angry' and couldn't
control it' so l beat you..

1116
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:46,678
..if those fools suggested you
this' what happened to your sense?..

1117
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,944
lf l didn't like you' l wouldn't
come searching for you..

1118
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,197
..you confused me by saying
marriage and all..

1119
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:10,452
..Now what do you want? l should
marry you' is that so?

1120
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:15,790
..l'll marry only you. Take your
clothes and come with me..

1121
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:20,462
..come Maha! l'll keep you
as a queen. come' let's go.

1122
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:23,048
No' l won't come.

1123
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:26,801
Why? Are you angry with me?

1124
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:30,805
No. You are feeling guilty
that you beat me..

1125
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:34,225
..it's only guiltiness that's
making you speak..

1126
01:30:34,392 --> 01:30:38,313
..but l don't want that.
l want you to love me..

1127
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,815
..you should know that you love me.

1128
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:42,984
l came here because l love you.

1129
01:30:43,151 --> 01:30:49,240
l am a modern girl. But l can't
change my mind immediately..

1130
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:52,327
..like other girls..

1131
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:55,497
..think about me for two months..

1132
01:30:55,663 --> 01:31:00,835
..then if you feel you really
love me' you come to me..

1133
01:31:01,002 --> 01:31:06,758
..till then' l won't see you. Even
if l see you' l won't talk to you..

1134
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:13,014
..you also shouldn't see
me or talk to me..

1135
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:17,102
..l don't desire anything
else' than your love..

1136
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:24,275
You want to test me l think.
l don't understand all this..

1137
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:30,532
..First l said l don't love you'
but still you called me to you..

1138
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:35,870
..now l am saying that l love you'
but you are sending me away..

1139
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:38,039
..not just two months'
even after two years..

1140
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:50,051
..l won't change my mind. l love
you more than my life' Maha!..

1141
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:54,472
..l will go now.

1142
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:09,320
chief Minister' Down' Down !

1143
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:34,346
lf you don't return the
post to our minister..

1144
01:32:34,512 --> 01:32:37,015
..we will kill ourselves.

1145
01:32:37,182 --> 01:32:41,853
chief Minister' Down' Down !

1146
01:32:57,035 --> 01:33:03,124
We can give our lives for our
minister. Nobody can stop us.

1147
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:30,652
Ey' why are you lighting
the match? Don't do that!

1148
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:55,677
Somebody save them!
Somebody save them!

1149
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:29,461
Aaru !

1150
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:42,640
What happened?

1151
01:34:42,807 --> 01:34:46,978
All of them got burnt to ashes'
Aaru ! only Shiva survived..

1152
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,481
..they took him to the hospital..

1153
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:57,072
The pain will be more. Give
anesthesia to all of them.

1154
01:34:57,238 --> 01:34:58,656
Yes Doctor!

1155
01:35:04,662 --> 01:35:11,086
Aaru' we were careful. But l don't
know how they caught fire.

1156
01:35:11,252 --> 01:35:13,838
Why did you leave me and go..

1157
01:35:14,005 --> 01:35:21,179
..Aaru ! Aaru ! My brother is dead..

1158
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:25,767
..he died because he wanted
to pay my college fees..

1159
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:30,772
..Who else do l have now?
Who will take care of me?

1160
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,777
Why did you leave me and go?

1161
01:35:42,534 --> 01:35:50,792
Aaru ! Who else do l have now?

1162
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:57,048
Don't cry somuch. Something may
happen to the child in your womb.

1163
01:35:57,799 --> 01:36:00,802
This wouldn't have happened
if you were there.

1164
01:36:42,594 --> 01:36:47,098
l heard you were not there.
Where did you go?..

1165
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:52,520
..oK' forget that. Now see
to the other arrangements..

1166
01:36:52,687 --> 01:36:55,273
..we will pay whatever
we have promised them..

1167
01:36:55,440 --> 01:37:00,111
l don't understand who
could have done this.

1168
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:23,385
My husband! Why did
you leave me and go?

1169
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,661
l told you to give 2
lakh rupees each..

1170
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:52,163
..so that they burn
themselves and die..

1171
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:54,666
..but you gave them only 15'000..

1172
01:37:54,833 --> 01:37:57,168
..and burnt them without
their knowledge..

1173
01:37:57,335 --> 01:38:00,922
..if this matter comes out'
l'll loose my seat forever..

1174
01:38:01,297 --> 01:38:03,425
You said you want your seat
back before night..

1175
01:38:03,591 --> 01:38:06,594
..You got it. Now tell me..

1176
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:08,763
..Who will come forward
to kill themselves?..

1177
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:11,016
..Leave 2 lakhs' even if
you give them 4 lakhs..

1178
01:38:11,182 --> 01:38:12,851
..nobody is ready to die..

1179
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:19,107
..nobody is ready to sacrifice his
life for his family. Sorry..

1180
01:38:19,774 --> 01:38:21,276
..Bhaskar!
- Yes brother!

1181
01:38:21,443 --> 01:38:24,279
You hide yourself for 10 days.
- Why brother?

1182
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:26,614
lf someone had seen you
lighting the match..

1183
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:28,450
But nobody saw me brother.

1184
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:30,201
ln case someone saw you.

1185
01:38:41,671 --> 01:38:45,133
Forget this love and all!
What is your level?..

1186
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,635
..l am your father. What
about my status?..

1187
01:38:47,802 --> 01:38:50,972
..You are talking senselessly
that you love a rowdy..

1188
01:38:51,097 --> 01:38:52,974
..he is a rouge of worst order.

1189
01:38:53,141 --> 01:38:55,477
Father! Don't underestimate others..

1190
01:38:55,643 --> 01:38:58,480
..as you think' l don't love him..

1191
01:38:58,605 --> 01:39:00,982
..he is like my husband.

1192
01:39:01,483 --> 01:39:04,736
lt is oK if he your lover'
oK if he is your husband..

1193
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:07,238
..but what do you mean he
is like your husband?.

1194
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:09,240
..did you have sex with him?

1195
01:39:09,407 --> 01:39:11,409
chi! What a cheap thought..

1196
01:39:11,576 --> 01:39:15,163
..ls that the way a father
talks to her daughter?..

1197
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:18,500
..lf it was not for that rowdy'
l would have been dead by now..

1198
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:21,002
..you would have found
my body in the sea..

1199
01:39:21,127 --> 01:39:23,922
..or else l would have
lost my virginity..

1200
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:26,341
..Aaru saved my life'
and my virginity.

1201
01:39:27,842 --> 01:39:29,761
..You should be correct
in everything..

1202
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:31,429
..You should take the
right decisions..

1203
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:33,014
..That's why l am making
you study Phsycology.

1204
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:37,268
You are making me study' but
the one studying is me..

1205
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:39,187
..l know better Phsycology..

1206
01:39:39,354 --> 01:39:44,776
oK' l thought that you fell
into the trap of a bad guy..

1207
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:47,278
..that's why l came here..

1208
01:39:47,404 --> 01:39:51,032
..But looks like you chose
to fall in that trap..

1209
01:39:51,157 --> 01:39:53,535
..So' you yourself have to
realie it and come back..

1210
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:57,288
..Brother! Please bear up
with her for two months..

1211
01:39:57,414 --> 01:40:00,291
Since we took money from you'
we have no other choice.

1212
01:40:04,045 --> 01:40:07,298
What to do? My time is bad.

1213
01:40:07,799 --> 01:40:11,386
What happened Purushottam? What
is this blood on your head?

1214
01:40:11,511 --> 01:40:13,972
l fell down from the plane.

1215
01:40:15,265 --> 01:40:17,308
From the plane?

1216
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:20,562
lnstead of opening the toilet door'
l opened the main door..

1217
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:24,232
..l fell down. l was lucky to fall
on the Kailasgiri mountain..

1218
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:28,069
..lf l fell into the sea' what
would have happened to me?

1219
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:32,907
He says that he fell down from
a plane. How can it be?

1220
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:38,079
..Ey' listen ! Why is there
blood on your neck?

1221
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:43,918
l slept on the tracks. Atleast
5 trains went on my neck.

1222
01:40:44,044 --> 01:40:45,420
Trains?

1223
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:47,339
Yes. Even if a man
is sleeping there..

1224
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:49,090
..they take the train from on
him without consideration..

1225
01:40:49,257 --> 01:40:51,509
..l don't know who gave
them those jobs?

1226
01:40:51,676 --> 01:40:56,264
This fellow says 5 trains
went on his neck.

1227
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:02,354
Brother! That man is coming towards
us. Don't know what he will say.

1228
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,107
Let him come. We'll see.
l am also surprised..

1229
01:41:06,232 --> 01:41:08,109
..Hey' listen !
- Yes' brother!

1230
01:41:08,276 --> 01:41:10,195
No it's nothing.
- You were asking something.

1231
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,696
No' nothing.

1232
01:41:11,821 --> 01:41:14,866
Did you want to ask why my
shirt is so dirty? - Yeah !

1233
01:41:14,991 --> 01:41:18,620
l was very tired and so
lied down on the road..

1234
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:21,456
..one bulldoer came
straight on to me..

1235
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:27,545
..l am grateful that only my shirt
got dirty. See you later.

1236
01:41:47,649 --> 01:41:50,110
Why did you put sauce on your face?

1237
01:41:50,819 --> 01:41:52,112
What did you say?

1238
01:41:52,237 --> 01:41:55,031
l asked you why you put
sauce on your face?

1239
01:41:55,156 --> 01:41:59,536
You call this sauce in your village?
Don't l know it. lt's red in colour.

1240
01:41:59,661 --> 01:42:01,705
ls it sauce if it's red?

1241
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:05,792
oh my God! lt's blood.

1242
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:08,795
lt's blood on you and
sauce on me' is it?

1243
01:42:24,686 --> 01:42:27,564
Sir' how come you are here?

1244
01:42:27,689 --> 01:42:31,317
lt's my daughter's wedding. l came
to give you the invitation.

1245
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:32,902
lsn't she still studying?

1246
01:42:33,028 --> 01:42:35,822
We found a good boy for her'
so we are marrying her off.

1247
01:42:35,947 --> 01:42:38,825
l solved your problem because
you paid me 5'000..

1248
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:42,579
..just for that' you are inviting
me for the marriage..

1249
01:42:42,704 --> 01:42:46,332
For the money l gave you' you got
that boy signed on the papers..

1250
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:48,835
..but after that when you
spoke to my daughter..

1251
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,338
..you said that your parents
will never deceive you..

1252
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:55,091
..l never expected that
you will say that.

1253
01:42:55,216 --> 01:42:57,594
lf l come there' your reputation
will get spoiled.

1254
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:00,513
Reputation should be in hearts'
not in people..

1255
01:43:00,638 --> 01:43:03,266
..you should definitely come.
l'll see you later.

1256
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,855
Shall we go to the wedding Aaru?

1257
01:43:09,647 --> 01:43:17,614
We should go. Maha will be there.
l want to see her.

1258
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:27,957
come Aaru !

1259
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,126
Hello Sir!

1260
01:43:35,256 --> 01:43:37,634
common let's go in.

1261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1262
01:48:39,644 --> 01:48:41,688
l don't want this.
- Why?

1263
01:48:41,813 --> 01:48:44,607
This is the money that came
from my brother's death..

1264
01:48:44,733 --> 01:48:46,192
..l don't want it.

1265
01:48:46,317 --> 01:48:49,863
You brother died because he wanted
you to study well. Take it.

1266
01:48:50,739 --> 01:48:52,532
Aaru !

1267
01:48:53,408 --> 01:48:55,869
Aaru will be coming.
You say what it is.

1268
01:48:55,994 --> 01:48:57,454
Say what it is.

1269
01:48:57,579 --> 01:48:59,205
Aaru !

1270
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:03,626
Say!
- Bhaskar! Bhaskar!

1271
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:07,964
oh Shiva! Why did you die?

1272
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:12,969
Arrange for the postmartum.

1273
01:49:23,104 --> 01:49:27,067
Aaru ! Before dying' Shiva took
your name and Bhaskar's name.

1274
01:49:27,192 --> 01:49:29,569
We also tried to save him..

1275
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:32,989
..lt would have been oK
if it was only gasoline..

1276
01:49:33,114 --> 01:49:37,994
..since there was petrol also
the wounds inside did not dry..

1277
01:49:40,872 --> 01:49:43,333
Doctor! What were you
saying about petrol?

1278
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:44,751
Yes' that's true.

1279
01:49:44,876 --> 01:49:48,004
That means those who died did not
put gasoline on themselves..

1280
01:49:48,129 --> 01:49:50,006
They died because it was a mixture
of petrol and gasoline..

1281
01:49:50,131 --> 01:49:52,175
..didn't you see the
postmartum report?

1282
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:57,430
What is this? Didn't we
give them only gasoline?

1283
01:49:57,555 --> 01:50:00,517
Yes we did.
- Are Shiva and Bhaskar friends?

1284
01:50:00,642 --> 01:50:03,019
No! - Then why was he
taking Bhaskar's name?

1285
01:50:03,144 --> 01:50:05,021
l can't understand.

1286
01:50:05,146 --> 01:50:06,773
l should meet brother immediately.

1287
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:15,031
Aaru is doubting Bhaskar.
lf Aaru finds Bhaskar..

1288
01:50:15,156 --> 01:50:17,534
..he will come to know the truth.

1289
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:20,036
Then we will kill Bhaskar too.
- That's right.

1290
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:25,041
lf we kill Bhaskar now' Aaru
will investigate that also.

1291
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,793
Then what should we do?

1292
01:50:26,918 --> 01:50:31,297
We will kill Aaru
instead of Bhaskar.

1293
01:50:33,174 --> 01:50:35,552
Aaru ! l am Brother speaking.

1294
01:50:35,677 --> 01:50:36,970
Where are you brother?

1295
01:50:37,095 --> 01:50:39,973
l am going home from the
site' you come home..

1296
01:50:40,098 --> 01:50:43,059
..l've to discuss something
important with you.

1297
01:50:43,518 --> 01:50:45,562
Brother' l will kill him.

1298
01:50:46,021 --> 01:50:48,481
None of us will get
involved in this..

1299
01:50:48,606 --> 01:50:50,567
..lf we miss our aim' he
will become our enemy..

1300
01:50:50,692 --> 01:50:54,320
..lf others come to know that
we tried to kill him..

1301
01:50:54,446 --> 01:50:56,823
..it will become a very big issue..

1302
01:50:56,948 --> 01:50:58,408
..call up Aadi!

1303
01:50:58,533 --> 01:51:00,577
Why should we call Aadi?

1304
01:51:00,702 --> 01:51:04,914
Badri! After using the
strength of the horse..

1305
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,500
..we need to send it to
the slaughter house.

1306
01:51:14,466 --> 01:51:17,093
Who is it?
- l am Vishwanath speaking.

1307
01:51:17,218 --> 01:51:20,013
What is it?
- lt's an important matter.

1308
01:51:20,138 --> 01:51:25,935
l am in Arakona not Viag' tell
me what it is in the phone.

1309
01:51:26,061 --> 01:51:28,521
l have a deal for you..

1310
01:51:28,646 --> 01:51:34,361
..l will tell Aaru that you are the
one who killed those 5 people..

1311
01:51:34,486 --> 01:51:38,114
..he will be enraged and
will come to kill you..

1312
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,617
..you finish him there without fail.

1313
01:51:40,742 --> 01:51:45,622
oK. - After that l promise that l'll
never interfere in your business.

1314
01:51:45,747 --> 01:51:49,376
Brother! Brother!..

1315
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:53,129
..Brother! The Doctor in the
hospital says that there was petrol..

1316
01:51:53,254 --> 01:51:56,883
Aaru ! We are deceived.
Bhaskar cheated us.

1317
01:51:57,008 --> 01:51:58,301
What are you saying?

1318
01:51:58,426 --> 01:52:00,637
That Aadi paid Bhaskar
huge sum of money..

1319
01:52:00,762 --> 01:52:03,223
..to spoil our reputation' he got
those 5 people burnt to death.

1320
01:52:03,348 --> 01:52:04,724
Was it Aadi?

1321
01:52:04,849 --> 01:52:08,478
Yes Aaru ! He did this
to ruin our business.

1322
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:11,231
How do you know?

1323
01:52:11,356 --> 01:52:15,652
When Aadi called me up' l could
hear Bhaskar's voice also.

1324
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:19,406
l'll kill Bhakar' Aadi'
and everyone else.

1325
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:23,159
That's not possible now Aaru.
Aadi is in his hometown.

1326
01:52:23,284 --> 01:52:25,662
l'll go and find him
wherever he is..

1327
01:52:25,787 --> 01:52:28,164
..after drinking' it takes a
little while to get a kick..

1328
01:52:28,289 --> 01:52:30,000
..that little time is enough for
me to kill even 10 people..

1329
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:31,418
..l'll definitely kill that fellow.

1330
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:33,169
Wait Aaru ! l too will
come with you..

1331
01:52:33,294 --> 01:52:35,672
..in a way l am responsible for
the death of those 5 people..

1332
01:52:35,797 --> 01:52:37,507
..common' come let us all go.

1333
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:41,011
Don't you trust me? Why should
you come when l am there?..

1334
01:52:41,136 --> 01:52:44,764
..l'll kill that fellow who tried
to spoil your reputation..

1335
01:52:44,889 --> 01:52:48,184
..l'll go to Arakona and show
that what Nath and co. is..

1336
01:52:48,309 --> 01:52:49,602
..come let's go.

1337
01:52:49,728 --> 01:52:57,610
Aaru' wait!
- Aadi' he is coming.

1338
01:53:10,248 --> 01:53:12,542
Ey' stop the vehicle!

1339
01:53:17,339 --> 01:53:19,466
What happened Aaru?

1340
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:23,219
l am feeling very uneasy at heart..

1341
01:53:23,345 --> 01:53:25,722
..the look in younger brother's
eyes was very different..

1342
01:53:25,847 --> 01:53:28,224
..he must have called up Aadi..

1343
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:30,727
..to take revenge on me for what
happened in the college that day..

1344
01:53:30,852 --> 01:53:33,229
..Arakona is Aadi's hometown..

1345
01:53:33,355 --> 01:53:35,732
..if he comes to know that we are
coming and prepares himself..

1346
01:53:35,857 --> 01:53:37,317
..all of us will be killed.

1347
01:53:37,442 --> 01:53:39,486
Aaru ! Brother usually gives us a
gun when we go for an assault..

1348
01:53:39,611 --> 01:53:41,988
..but today when we are
going to murder someone..

1349
01:53:42,113 --> 01:53:43,573
..he never gave us any weapon.
Why is that?

1350
01:53:43,698 --> 01:53:46,076
He must have forgot
in all that tension.

1351
01:53:46,201 --> 01:53:50,747
No Aaru ! Nobody told us that
Bhaskar was missing from 10 days.

1352
01:53:50,872 --> 01:53:54,918
Leave that. I somehow doubt
younger brother..

1353
01:53:58,797 --> 01:54:00,757
..ask Sumo to come..

1354
01:54:00,882 --> 01:54:03,259
..and tell him to check the
situation in Aadi's town. - oK Aaru !

1355
01:54:03,385 --> 01:54:05,845
Put off all the cell phones.
Nobody should contact us..

1356
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:07,597
..Put in a new card.

1357
01:54:11,226 --> 01:54:14,521
Ey' who are you?
- l am Narsimha Naidu.

1358
01:54:14,646 --> 01:54:17,524
This is not Narsimha Nadu'
but is Tamil Nadu.

1359
01:54:17,732 --> 01:54:19,943
l am saying Naidu' and you are
saying Nadu' what is it?..

1360
01:54:20,068 --> 01:54:22,028
..ls your tongue not
working properly..

1361
01:54:22,153 --> 01:54:24,864
..because of eating
too much of Sambhar?

1362
01:54:24,989 --> 01:54:28,284
Sir! What do you want?
- Who is Venum?

1363
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,787
Enna Venum means what do you want?

1364
01:54:30,912 --> 01:54:32,455
l am from a real estate company..

1365
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:35,291
..l am looking out for good plots.

1366
01:54:35,417 --> 01:54:37,043
come with me. l'll show you.

1367
01:54:37,502 --> 01:54:40,380
My God! Do sheperds also have
cell phones in your village?

1368
01:54:40,505 --> 01:54:42,215
He is one of Aadi's men.

1369
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:44,551
oh is that so?

1370
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:47,470
ln this village' Aadi sir gave
cell phones to everyone..

1371
01:54:47,595 --> 01:54:49,556
..from a sheperd to a farmer..

1372
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:54,561
..if anybody enters the village'
the message reaches him.

1373
01:54:54,686 --> 01:54:57,063
oh' there's so much story to it..

1374
01:54:57,188 --> 01:54:59,566
..in our village a movie with
the title Aadi was a superhit..

1375
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:03,319
..if you view MGR as God' for
us Telugu people NTR is God..

1376
01:55:03,445 --> 01:55:06,156
..what is Pedarayudu
for us is * for you.

1377
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:08,658
What is Gilli in our village
is okkadu in your village..

1378
01:55:08,783 --> 01:55:11,244
..here it is Vasul Raja and
there it is Shankar Dada..

1379
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:13,329
..the one with a green pant is MGR..

1380
01:55:13,455 --> 01:55:15,331
..but the one with a green
shirt is chandra Babu.

1381
01:55:15,457 --> 01:55:17,083
lf its Palle Panchamani
for your all..

1382
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:18,668
..it is Tirupathi Laddu for us..

1383
01:55:18,793 --> 01:55:20,337
..you put Nama for yourselves..

1384
01:55:20,462 --> 01:55:22,088
..but we put it for everyone'
you idiot..

1385
01:55:22,213 --> 01:55:23,840
..and if it's necessary
we even shave our head.

1386
01:55:26,384 --> 01:55:30,847
..you left the chennai for us
and took all the good places..

1387
01:55:30,972 --> 01:55:38,355
..you have Tirumala' Tirupathi'
Tiruchanuru' Srinivasa Mangapuram..

1388
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,857
For what are you crying so much?..

1389
01:55:40,982 --> 01:55:43,360
..we have only Tirupathi with us..

1390
01:55:43,485 --> 01:55:45,862
..all other temples are
in your Tamil Nadu only..

1391
01:55:45,987 --> 01:55:48,698
..just in chennai' Telugu people
are earning crores in business..

1392
01:55:48,823 --> 01:55:50,867
..why are you still crying?
Shut your mouth..

1393
01:55:50,992 --> 01:55:53,787
..and come to show me the land.

1394
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:57,457
l got all the information..

1395
01:55:57,582 --> 01:55:59,626
..Aadi gave cell phones
to everyone..

1396
01:55:59,751 --> 01:56:02,128
..including all the sheperds
and farmers..

1397
01:56:02,253 --> 01:56:04,631
..if anyone enters from any of
the 3 sides of the village..

1398
01:56:04,756 --> 01:56:08,385
..even before he travels 2
kilometers' Aadi gets to know it..

1399
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,887
..around his house there
are rowdys guarding it..

1400
01:56:11,012 --> 01:56:13,723
..behind his house is a big river..

1401
01:56:13,848 --> 01:56:16,226
..besides the river is
a road' and that's..

1402
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:18,728
..the only way to get to the house..

1403
01:56:18,853 --> 01:56:21,648
..another important thing' tomorrow
is the cattle market..

1404
01:56:21,773 --> 01:56:24,150
..so nobody will be
there in the village.

1405
01:56:24,275 --> 01:56:25,902
That's the right time for us..

1406
01:56:26,027 --> 01:56:28,988
..Gopi! You and Shashi go
and shave your heads. - oK!

1407
01:56:47,298 --> 01:56:49,175
Why are you reading the
Telugu paper boss?

1408
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,927
You don't know..

1409
01:56:57,308 --> 01:56:59,686
..Ey' catch them!

1410
01:58:06,127 --> 01:58:11,591
No! Aaru don't kill me! Listen to
me! l'll give you whatever you want.

1411
01:58:11,716 --> 01:58:13,510
You burnt 5 people to
death and now you say..

1412
01:58:13,635 --> 01:58:16,012
..that you'll give me
whatever you want..

1413
01:58:16,137 --> 01:58:17,597
..tell me where Bhaskar is.

1414
01:58:17,722 --> 01:58:20,433
He's not here. He's in
Vishwanath's custody..

1415
01:58:20,558 --> 01:58:24,270
..Vishwanath is the one who got
those 5 people burnt to death.

1416
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,273
How dare you speak
lies about brother!

1417
01:58:27,732 --> 01:58:32,278
Even if one dies' he should save
the other' that's what l'm saying..

1418
01:58:32,404 --> 01:58:38,535
..if you kill me' you also
will loose your life.

1419
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:40,203
What are you saying?

1420
01:58:40,328 --> 01:58:42,288
call up Vishwanath and give me.

1421
01:58:43,665 --> 01:58:48,545
call him up' l'll tell you.
call him up quickly..

1422
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:52,298
..then you'll know the truth..

1423
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:03,560
..Vishwanath' l am Aadi speaking.
l killed Aaru.

1424
01:59:05,603 --> 01:59:10,150
Very good Aadi! Now you can
do whatever you want..

1425
01:59:10,275 --> 01:59:12,652
..not just in Viag harbour' but
also in Gajuvaka' Kothapeta..

1426
01:59:12,777 --> 01:59:16,072
..Simhachalam and
wherever you want..

1427
01:59:16,865 --> 01:59:20,243
..you kidnap whichever
girl you like..

1428
01:59:20,368 --> 01:59:26,082
..l'll not interfere. Not even
Aaru's body should come this side..

1429
01:59:26,207 --> 01:59:30,587
..cut him into pieces and
throw it to the birds.

1430
01:59:37,802 --> 01:59:42,682
Now do you know' he is the one
who killed those 5 people..

1431
01:59:42,807 --> 01:59:46,102
..he told me that he
will send you here..

1432
01:59:46,227 --> 01:59:48,605
..and asked me to kill you here.

1433
01:59:50,315 --> 01:59:52,776
lf l leave you like this' you'll call
him up immediately after l leave..

1434
01:59:52,901 --> 01:59:54,861
..and tell him what happened..

1435
01:59:54,986 --> 01:59:57,947
..if l kill you' no other girl in
our place will have any problem..

1436
01:59:58,073 --> 02:00:02,369
..this is the first time l'm doing
something good in my life.

1437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1438
02:03:31,453 --> 02:03:33,329
Aaru ! ls it you?

1439
02:03:33,455 --> 02:03:35,832
You are shocked that
l am still alive?

1440
02:03:35,957 --> 02:03:38,835
No' nothing like that.

1441
02:03:39,711 --> 02:03:46,343
Then what is it? Speak up! open
your mouth you rascal..

1442
02:03:46,468 --> 02:03:51,348
..Did you loose your speech?
Why don't you speak up?..

1443
02:03:51,473 --> 02:03:55,101
..lf you ask me to beat
my head to the wall..

1444
02:03:55,226 --> 02:03:57,604
..l do that first' and then
ask you why you asked me to..

1445
02:03:57,729 --> 02:04:01,358
..How could you think
of killing me?..

1446
02:04:01,483 --> 02:04:05,111
..Because l trusted you' l did
whatever you told me to do..

1447
02:04:05,236 --> 02:04:10,116
..everytime l called you brother'
it came from the heart..

1448
02:04:10,241 --> 02:04:13,870
..but nobody of you thought
of me as a brother..

1449
02:04:13,995 --> 02:04:17,624
..as far as you are concerned'
Aaru is just a dog..

1450
02:04:17,749 --> 02:04:20,126
..a dokey who does the house work..

1451
02:04:20,251 --> 02:04:25,131
..and a servant who eats
your leftovers' isn't he?

1452
02:04:27,759 --> 02:04:30,136
..net and fish' mongoose
and snake..

1453
02:04:30,261 --> 02:04:33,890
..police and rowdy' all are
enemy's to each other..

1454
02:04:34,015 --> 02:04:37,644
..but a rowdy is the enemy
of another rowdy..

1455
02:04:37,769 --> 02:04:39,312
..l don't want this work anymore..

1456
02:04:39,437 --> 02:04:41,731
..you showed me what it is
to deceive a trusted one..

1457
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,900
..l'll not leave you.

1458
02:04:44,025 --> 02:04:46,403
Ey! Mind your tongue.

1459
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:52,075
Ey! You could have burnt
anyone for your gain..

1460
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,161
..but why did you burn
those innocent people..

1461
02:04:55,286 --> 02:04:56,830
..for whom l only wished good..

1462
02:04:56,955 --> 02:04:58,915
..just because they are
poor and you are rich..

1463
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,917
..Even l am poor..

1464
02:05:01,042 --> 02:05:03,920
..but l'll show you what a poor
man can do to you rich people..

1465
02:05:04,045 --> 02:05:07,674
..you should regret for
becoming Aaru's enemies..

1466
02:05:07,799 --> 02:05:11,428
..and you should regret for
burning those 5 people..

1467
02:05:11,553 --> 02:05:15,181
..with the same mouth that
you called me brother..

1468
02:05:15,306 --> 02:05:18,018
..you should cry aloud
and beat your breasts..

1469
02:05:18,143 --> 02:05:23,940
..l will destroy Nath and co.

1470
02:05:25,567 --> 02:05:30,196
Forgive me Aaru ! Please forgive me..

1471
02:05:30,321 --> 02:05:35,201
..if anyone messes with Nath and
co.' l change his destiny..

1472
02:05:35,326 --> 02:05:40,540
..and now you challenged me' l'll

..5 years ago l was driving

1493
02:07:05,834 --> 02:07:09,045

1497
02:07:14,342 --> 02:07:17,137
..my head dashed to the steering
and blood gushed out..

1498
02:07:17,262 --> 02:07:19,055

..when l opened my eyes in the
hospital' l did not feel the pain..

1502
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:30,316

1503
02:07:30,442 --> 02:07:32,819
..l did not get angry'
but felt like crying..

1504
02:07:32,944 --> 02:07:35,321
..Your hand starts moving
when you see girls..

1505
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:37,824
..and you are never
ready to apologie..

1506

..and you expect me to
come and save you..

1507
02:07:39,951 --> 02:07:41,911
No Aaru ! Don't do it.

1508
02:07:42,037 --> 02:07:46,750
God punished me because l
supported your wrongdoing.

1509
02:07:46,875 --> 02:07:48,501
No! Don't hurt me Aaru !

1510

With whom are you speaking?

1512
02:07:58,636 --> 02:08:02,849
Ey' Vishwanath ! Are you tired of
searching for your brother?..

1519
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:32,212
..Why didn't you listen to me?

1520
02:08:33,672 --> 02:08:36,132
Jaga! Don't worry' we

1521
02:08:36,257 --> 02:08:39,469
can you hear him crying?
Are you not angry?

1522
02:08:39,594 --> 02:08:44,474
Brother! See how he is crying. l'll
not leave him. l'll kill him.

1523
02:08:44,599 --> 02:08:50,397
Nobody should cry. Don't cry.

..We'll take care of him. We

..Keep quite! Don't cry. Don't cry!

1526
02:08:59,614 --> 02:09:01,658
Brother! Aaru called up.

pain of those whom you burnt?

Everyday you should see him and cry.

You are a dog who ate my food.
l'll catch you..

1532
02:09:16,798 --> 02:09:21,177
..Will you attack me from behind?
l'll not leave you !

1533
02:09:21,302 --> 02:09:24,514
Don't challenge me by
sitting in the house..

1534
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:27,934
..l am already in the battlefield.
Now it's the turn of Loknath..

1535
02:09:28,059 --> 02:09:33,523
..lf l get him' l'll kill him. Make
everything ready for his funeral.

1536
02:09:38,737 --> 02:09:44,534
Brother! What is that fellow saying?

1537
02:09:44,659 --> 02:09:52,542
Badri! Don't leave him.

Ey' tell me where is Aaru.

..And Aaru is the only one who

02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:44,320
Please don't cry.

1564
02:11:48,867 --> 02:11:52,579
Maha! Aaru is in the car. He wants
to speak to you. Go to him.

1565

Why are you talking like this?

1576

lt's not me who's talking'
it's my husband.

1612
02:15:15,907 --> 02:15:19,536
With how many girls did

02:15:19,661 --> 02:15:22,038
..l'll cut you into pieces.

1614
02:15:30,005 --> 02:15:33,633
Why does this conductor have
a knife instead of a whistle?

1615
02:15:33,758 --> 02:15:38,638
..Thank God that he doesn't
know how to use that knife.

1616
02:15:41,266 --> 02:15:43,309
Aaru ! All the farmers

..who sold their fields
are coming to Anakapally.

The registration is sure to happen.
Badrinath will come.

02:15:49,107 --> 02:15:52,068
Before he signs the documents'
we should kill him.

1620
02:15:52,527 --> 02:15:56,239
Why did you send him to Anakapally
without asking me?

..So that he get's killed

..What do we do if Aaru
comes to know this?

1624
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,329
He will not know. There's
no chance of him knowing..

1625
02:16:03,455 --> 02:16:04,914
..our men also went
along with brother..

1626
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,500
A lion which has tasted will

..it will attack' that's it.

1628

He said that next on the list
is me. Badri is not in danger.

1629

..All of you are good-for-nothing
fools. Get lost!

..checkposts are strong..

1704
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:31,815
..he did not come that
way to Anakapally..

1705
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:34,317
..There's no chance of him to come..

1706
02:25:34,442 --> 02:25:36,403
..through the shortcut
to Gopalapatnam

1707
02:25:36,528 --> 02:25:38,405
..and then take the Kasimkota road..

1708
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:41,658
..to reach the 200 ft road and then
come this side to the GT road..

1709
02:25:41,783 --> 02:25:44,494
..the other side is Menkyada'
there is a checkpost too..

1710
02:25:44,619 --> 02:25:46,830
..except for all of this' there
is an area behind the airport..

1711
02:25:46,955 --> 02:25:48,915
..called the Kanakalamma Gudi..

1712
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,418
..The other day my brother-in-law
told me..

1713
02:25:51,543 --> 02:25:53,920
..that when Aaru spoke to him'
he heard the sound of planes..

1714
02:25:54,045 --> 02:25:56,423
..and they can't be planes
which are high in the sky..

1715
02:25:56,548 --> 02:25:58,925
..either they should
be take-off flights..

1716
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:00,677
..or they should be
the landing flights..

1717
02:26:00,802 --> 02:26:04,681
..nobody knows that there is a
place like this in the city itself..

1718
02:26:04,806 --> 02:26:06,433
..behind the airport.
But l know of it.

1719
02:26:18,153 --> 02:26:20,196
Sir! He is running away.

1720
02:26:20,321 --> 02:26:22,866
can't you shoot him. Are
you not getting paid?..

1721
02:26:22,991 --> 02:26:26,453
..Do you think this is a toy?
Should l commit all the sins?

1722
02:26:34,753 --> 02:26:36,796
What is it Aaru?

1723
02:26:39,007 --> 02:26:40,383
Where is Gopi?

1724
02:26:40,508 --> 02:26:43,970
The police arrested him Aaru.
Nothing will happen to him.

1725
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,724
call that doctor girl.

1726
02:26:47,849 --> 02:26:49,225
Tell me what it is.

1727
02:26:49,351 --> 02:26:54,647
Ask the doctor not to tell Maha
about what happened to me..

1728
02:26:54,773 --> 02:27:00,236
..that poor girl Maha
will worry about me..

1729
02:27:00,362 --> 02:27:06,993
..Already l hurt her
a lot. My poor Maha!

1730
02:27:13,208 --> 02:27:14,584
Sir!

1731
02:27:14,709 --> 02:27:16,002
What happened to your hand?

1732
02:27:16,127 --> 02:27:18,088
lt's a Puthooru bandage sir.

1733
02:27:18,213 --> 02:27:20,256
ls it of Puthooru or chittooru?..

1734
02:27:20,382 --> 02:27:22,759
..Aren't you ashamed? ln the
broad day light one girl..

1735
02:27:22,884 --> 02:27:25,261
..cheated you' took the
medicines and ran away..

1736
02:27:25,387 --> 02:27:26,680
..and you still have
smile on your face..

1737
02:27:26,805 --> 02:27:28,098
..Why do you need
a pant and a shirt?

1738
02:27:28,223 --> 02:27:30,266
..Put a cloth on your head
and sit in a corner..

1739
02:27:30,392 --> 02:27:33,186
..Are you sure that those medicines
are used for wounds?

1740
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:35,271
You can even operate on someone
with those medicines.

1741
02:27:35,397 --> 02:27:37,357
Did you see that girl before?

1742
02:27:37,482 --> 02:27:39,025
No sir!

1743
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:44,864
Loknath ! Which girl can help
this fellow secretly?..

1744
02:27:44,989 --> 02:27:47,117
..Do you know if he has any affair?

1745
02:27:47,325 --> 02:27:51,121
When Arakona Aadi kidnapped
one girl' we went there..

1746
02:27:51,246 --> 02:27:52,789
..Ey' do you know who that girl is?

1747
02:27:52,914 --> 02:27:54,207
No' we don't know.

1748
02:27:54,332 --> 02:27:59,045
All of you answered No' in one
chorus. Shameless creatures!

1749
02:28:14,853 --> 02:28:19,065
Don't think that if you avoid me'
my life will be better..

1750
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:24,237
..l know everything. You
are stopping yourself..

1751
02:28:24,362 --> 02:28:27,407
..You hate cheating. l know
you can't cheat me..

1752
02:28:27,532 --> 02:28:31,161
..since l came here trusting you..

1753
02:28:33,496 --> 02:28:35,331
..Not just one' even if
you murder 100 people..

1754
02:28:35,457 --> 02:28:39,085
..l won't be afraid..

1755
02:28:40,462 --> 02:28:45,425
..Since your life changed' you
think you should not spoil my life..

1756
02:28:45,550 --> 02:28:50,347
..but if you are not there'
my life is not life indeed..

1757
02:28:50,805 --> 02:28:54,100
..because everyone you trusted'
became betrayers..

1758
02:28:54,225 --> 02:28:57,020
..without your knowledge' a
fear settled in your heart..

1759
02:28:57,145 --> 02:29:01,024
..now you don't trust anyone..

1760
02:29:01,149 --> 02:29:04,736
..you need someone' and
l am there with you..

1761
02:29:04,861 --> 02:29:07,864
..l'll be there for
you at all times..

1762
02:29:07,989 --> 02:29:11,618
..Don't hesitate to put your
head on my shoulders..

1763
02:29:11,743 --> 02:29:16,790
..lf you feel like crying'
cry your heart out..

1764
02:29:16,915 --> 02:29:20,377
..all the emotions pent up in
your heart will come out..

1765
02:29:20,502 --> 02:29:24,297
..then you will get new
confidence in yourself..

1766
02:29:26,675 --> 02:29:29,135
..nobody will be able to harm you..

1767
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:31,971
..when you saved me that day'
l started trusting you..

1768
02:29:32,097 --> 02:29:34,557
..l am speaking to you
with that same trust..

1769
02:29:34,683 --> 02:29:37,060
..Please don't avoid me..

1770
02:29:37,185 --> 02:29:42,899
..Later' you'll cry your whole
life that you did a mistake..

1771
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1772
02:34:45,118 --> 02:34:46,953
You said we have to steal
a car for Aaru..

1773
02:34:47,078 --> 02:34:48,371
..then' why did you bring us here?

1774
02:34:48,496 --> 02:34:51,958
Anyone going in a car will
stop here to urinate..

1775
02:34:52,083 --> 02:34:56,546
..can't you make that out from that
tree' this place' this stink?

1776
02:34:56,671 --> 02:34:58,381
How do you know all this?

1777
02:34:58,506 --> 02:35:00,300
That's my talent.

1778
02:35:00,842 --> 02:35:02,135
There's a vehicle coming from there.

1779
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:03,887
Did he come near?
- Yes brother!

1780
02:35:04,012 --> 02:35:06,473
Did he stop the vehicle as
we thought? - Yes he did.

1781
02:35:06,598 --> 02:35:09,476
Did he open the car door?
- Yes brother.

1782
02:35:09,601 --> 02:35:10,894
Did he open his pant's door?

1783
02:35:11,019 --> 02:35:13,480
He is opening it. He opened it.

1784
02:35:13,605 --> 02:35:15,982
Did he start his job?
- Yes' he did.

1785
02:35:16,107 --> 02:35:18,234
come' let's go.

1786
02:35:20,987 --> 02:35:23,239
ls it right to steal somebody's car?

1787
02:35:23,365 --> 02:35:25,241
This is not called stealing'
you idiot.

1788
02:35:25,367 --> 02:35:28,244
Why do you scold me?
- Whom will we give the car?

1789
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:29,662
To Aaru !

1790
02:35:29,788 --> 02:35:31,998
Aaru will complete his work
and give it back to us..

1791
02:35:32,123 --> 02:35:34,501
..then we will leave this
vehicle somewhere..

1792
02:35:34,626 --> 02:35:37,837
..ln the meantime the owner will
lodge a complaint with police..

1793
02:35:37,962 --> 02:35:41,091
..Police will find the car
and take it to him..

1794
02:35:41,216 --> 02:35:45,345
..they will pull out all the parts
and give him just the body.

1795
02:35:45,470 --> 02:35:47,263
Then' it will be a
loss to the owner.

1796
02:35:47,389 --> 02:35:51,017
No loss for him. The insurance
company will pay him back.

1797
02:35:51,142 --> 02:35:52,686
Then' it's the loss of
the insurance company.

1798
02:35:52,811 --> 02:35:55,772
They insure 1'000 cars and pay back
to just one car. ls it a loss?..

1799
02:35:55,897 --> 02:36:00,151
..You body has grown up' but not
your brains. You are an idiot.

1800
02:36:00,276 --> 02:36:02,737
How did you become so intelligent?

1801
02:36:02,862 --> 02:36:04,531
l also don't know.

1802
02:36:09,577 --> 02:36:10,870
Who is it?

1803
02:36:10,995 --> 02:36:15,792
l am your brother speaking.
l am Aaru here..

1804
02:36:15,917 --> 02:36:19,546
..Has your brother become
like a torn trash paper?..

1805
02:36:19,671 --> 02:36:22,048
..Does he look like a banana
with lots of knife stabs?..

1806
02:36:22,173 --> 02:36:28,304
..Did you understand now what
is pain and betrayal?..

1807
02:36:28,430 --> 02:36:33,309
..Your whole body must be in pain
as if you got a current shock.

1808
02:36:33,435 --> 02:36:35,228
l won't leave you.

1809
02:36:35,353 --> 02:36:37,063
Now that brother of yours
should remain like..

1810
02:36:37,188 --> 02:36:40,817
..a broken bucket' or a broken
cot which is useless.

1811
02:36:40,942 --> 02:36:42,235
Ey' mind your tongue!

1812
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:44,571
l could have killed
him on the spot..

1813
02:36:44,696 --> 02:36:48,324
..but if he died' you would cry
for a few days and forget him..

1814
02:36:48,450 --> 02:36:52,078
..l want you to cry everyday
and get tired of crying..

1815
02:36:52,203 --> 02:36:55,832
..seeing him suffer' you should
beat your breasts and cry..

1816
02:36:55,957 --> 02:36:59,836
..now he is like a rotten mango'
you can drink his juice.

1817
02:36:59,961 --> 02:37:04,758
You are a faithless dog! l'll
cut your body into pieces..

1818
02:37:04,883 --> 02:37:08,928
..and throw it to dogs
that guard my house.

1819
02:37:09,721 --> 02:37:12,098
Not my body' feed your dogs
the body that l stabbed..

1820
02:37:12,223 --> 02:37:14,768
..they will enjoy eating it.

1821
02:37:28,823 --> 02:37:30,283
What happened brother?

1822
02:37:33,828 --> 02:37:35,372
All of you go out.

1823
02:37:35,497 --> 02:37:37,123
What is it brother?

1824
02:37:37,248 --> 02:37:40,126
l can't bear to see
him suffer like this.

1825
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:42,712
No brother! Don't do it!..

1826
02:37:42,837 --> 02:37:47,133
..What are you doing?
Please listen to me..

1827
02:37:47,258 --> 02:37:52,138
..Brother' don't do it.

1828
02:38:47,861 --> 02:38:49,696
Tell me where he is!

1829
02:38:49,821 --> 02:38:51,448
l don't know.
- Tell me!

1830
02:38:51,573 --> 02:38:53,450
l don't know.

1831
02:38:57,871 --> 02:39:02,625
Tell our brother-in-law to bring
all those who live in those slums.

1832
02:39:39,996 --> 02:39:42,916
lf you can give us the details
of the dealer or the salesman..

1833
02:39:43,041 --> 02:39:45,502

1834
02:39:49,172 --> 02:39:51,549
Tell me where is Aaru ! Tell me!

1835
02:39:51,675 --> 02:39:53,927
l don't know anything sir.

1836
02:39:57,389 --> 02:40:01,017
lf we knew where Aaru is' we
would have told you bravely..

1837
02:40:01,142 --> 02:40:04,771
..You will not be able
to do anything to him..

1838
02:40:04,896 --> 02:40:08,525
..lf he finds you' he'll kill you
and remove your intestines..

1839
02:40:08,650 --> 02:40:12,278
..Why are you showing
your strength on us?..

1840
02:40:12,404 --> 02:40:14,781
..Remove your uniform and come..

1841
02:40:14,906 --> 02:40:17,283
..even a small boy here will break
your teeth and give you..

1842
02:40:17,409 --> 02:40:18,702
How dare you?

1843
02:40:18,827 --> 02:40:22,455
How dare you insult
me before everyone?..

1844
02:40:22,580 --> 02:40:26,042
..l'll put you in jail and then
show you that l am a man..

1845
02:40:26,167 --> 02:40:27,544
..Arrest her!..

1846
02:40:33,758 --> 02:40:35,051
The seven cards that you mentioned..

1847
02:40:35,176 --> 02:40:36,469
..were sold by Mahalakshmi' sir.

1848
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,555
l have 38 different cases
in the name of..

1849
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:41,057
..brown sugar' cocaine' smuggling'
murder' rape' stealing..

1850
02:40:41,182 --> 02:40:43,560
..l am searching for people
to put in jail..

1851
02:40:43,685 --> 02:40:47,731
..l'll put all those cases
on you and put you inside..

1852
02:40:49,357 --> 02:40:52,736
..Does any girl come here for
him?.. - l don't know sir.

1853
02:40:52,861 --> 02:40:54,988
Mother' is he talking of that girl?

1854
02:41:04,372 --> 02:41:06,332
Please don't harm my child sir.

1855
02:41:06,458 --> 02:41:08,168
What were you saying?

1856
02:41:08,293 --> 02:41:11,338
My daughter doesn't know anything.

1857
02:41:11,463 --> 02:41:14,007
Tell me' what did you say? Tell me!

1858
02:41:14,132 --> 02:41:15,508
Give me way!
- Tell me!

1859
02:41:15,633 --> 02:41:18,595
Sir! The one who sold sim cards
to him and helped him..

1860
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:21,348
..is a girl. Her name
is Mahalakshmi.

1861
02:41:21,473 --> 02:41:22,849
What's her address?

1862
02:41:36,488 --> 02:41:38,615
Hello! Please come in.

1863
02:41:50,543 --> 02:41:59,886
Are you trying to escape from us?

1864
02:42:00,095 --> 02:42:01,388
Tell me!

Beat them!

1866
02:42:03,765 --> 02:42:06,643
Don't you know where Aaru is?..

1867
02:42:09,187 --> 02:42:12,399
..What all you are
doing at this age..

1868
02:42:12,524 --> 02:42:16,152
..lt seems that you go to meet
him. Do you go daily?..

1869
02:42:18,029 --> 02:42:23,159
..lf l put worms on your stomach'
it will be nice.

1870
02:42:23,284 --> 02:42:27,747
Are you an animal? Are
you a women at all?..

1871
02:42:27,872 --> 02:42:29,916
..Why are you torturing
that girl like that?..

1872
02:42:30,041 --> 02:42:32,419
..She is also a women like you.

1873
02:42:32,544 --> 02:42:37,424
Your head is filled with pride.
l know how to get rid of it.

1874
02:42:39,342 --> 02:42:41,928
Sir! We found out who
stole that Qualis.

1875
02:42:42,053 --> 02:42:43,680
Who is that?
- lt's Sumo sir.

1876
02:42:43,805 --> 02:42:45,682
A Qualis was stolen.

1877
02:42:45,807 --> 02:42:47,434
Yes sir. Sumo stole it.

1878
02:42:47,559 --> 02:42:49,352
can a vehicle steal another vehicle.

1879
02:42:49,477 --> 02:42:51,187
lt's not a vehicle sir' it's a man..

1880
02:42:51,312 --> 02:42:52,605
..Ey' bring in Sumo.

1881
02:42:54,149 --> 02:42:56,192
Why did you push me? Are you
trying to impress him?..

1882
02:42:56,317 --> 02:42:58,028
..He himself is a big show off.

1883
02:42:58,153 --> 02:43:01,197
Ey' Do you know Aaru?

1884
02:43:01,322 --> 02:43:04,951
l don't know Aaru' Yedu. But
l know eight and nine.

1885
02:43:05,076 --> 02:43:06,703
Are you trying to fool
us with numbers?

1886
02:43:06,828 --> 02:43:08,705
l was going out for
an important job..

1887
02:43:08,830 --> 02:43:11,207
..they brought me here' and you
are asking me silly questions..

1888
02:43:11,332 --> 02:43:12,709
..Do you think l have no other work?

1889
02:43:12,834 --> 02:43:15,378
Do you know that you are
in a police station?

1890
02:43:15,503 --> 02:43:17,464
Wait' wait! You want me to
show you Aaru' is that all?

1891
02:43:17,589 --> 02:43:18,882
Yes!

1892
02:43:19,007 --> 02:43:21,217
come sir! Here is the
Yeru you asked for..

1893
02:43:21,343 --> 02:43:24,220
..Give me your caps
and jump into it.

1894
02:43:24,346 --> 02:43:25,638
What did you say?

1895
02:43:25,764 --> 02:43:28,141
We asked for Aaru' not for a Yeru.

1896
02:43:28,266 --> 02:43:31,227
You asked me to show you'
l showed you what l know..

1897
02:43:31,353 --> 02:43:32,645
..that's all' now l'll go.

1898
02:43:32,937 --> 02:43:36,232
Are you trying to fool us
by showing this river?

1899
02:43:36,358 --> 02:43:38,735
oh l see. So you asked
for Aaru' is it?

1900
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:41,237
Now show us!..
- ..come sir' he'll take us.

1901
02:43:41,363 --> 02:43:42,989
come' l'll show you..

1902
02:43:43,114 --> 02:43:45,158
..There it is! See how
beautiful it is.

1903
02:43:46,701 --> 02:43:48,828
Don't you know who that gangster is?

1904
02:43:48,953 --> 02:43:52,499
oh' so you are asking about that
Aaru. You could have told me so.

1905
02:43:52,624 --> 02:43:54,334
What would you do if we did?

1906
02:43:54,459 --> 02:43:56,419
l would have told you
that l don't know.

1907
02:44:11,309 --> 02:44:12,602
Aaru !

1908
02:44:12,727 --> 02:44:14,354
What is it?

1909
02:44:14,479 --> 02:44:16,272
Vishwanath killed our
Gopi and Shashi..

1910
02:44:16,398 --> 02:44:18,775
..He threw their bodies
in the river..

1911
02:44:18,900 --> 02:44:22,529
..The Ac lodged false cases
on the people of our area..

1912
02:44:22,654 --> 02:44:25,907
..and put them all into prison.
He arrested Maha also.

1913
02:44:27,659 --> 02:44:31,287
We should not leave him Aaru.
l will go. l'll kill that Ac.

1914
02:44:31,413 --> 02:44:33,790
We could have killed him if
he was just Ac Raja Rao..

1915
02:44:33,915 --> 02:44:36,292
..but he is our sister's
husband' Raja Rao..

1916
02:44:36,418 --> 02:44:37,961
..sentiment is coming in between..

1917
02:44:38,086 --> 02:44:40,046
..otherwise l would have killed him.

1918
02:44:40,505 --> 02:44:44,426
Ey' brother-in-law! lf you
are a just officer..

1919
02:44:44,551 --> 02:44:47,554
..arrest Vishwanath who
killed my people..

1920
02:44:47,679 --> 02:44:51,307
..or arrest Bhaskar who
burnt them to death..

1921
02:44:51,433 --> 02:44:53,810
..Vishwanath killed 2 of my men
who were in your custody..

1922
02:44:53,935 --> 02:44:56,312
..instead of investigating
that matter..

1923
02:44:56,438 --> 02:44:58,815
..you are misusing
your post' if you..

1924
02:44:58,940 --> 02:45:00,483
..don't stop it' l'll
do your postmartum.

1925
02:45:00,608 --> 02:45:05,488
..l am leaving you because
you are sister's husband..

1926
02:45:05,613 --> 02:45:07,574
..otherwise you would have
been killed by now..

1927
02:45:07,699 --> 02:45:10,744
..now you see' both of
them will die for sure.

1928
02:45:24,507 --> 02:45:26,343
l know that you are angry with me..

1929
02:45:26,468 --> 02:45:30,096
..l did not come to tell you
that l did the right thing..

1930
02:45:30,221 --> 02:45:32,599
..l just came to unburden my heart.

1931
02:45:35,769 --> 02:45:37,937
Vimala! Did anyone call you up?

1932
02:45:38,396 --> 02:45:40,106
No!

1933
02:45:40,231 --> 02:45:43,026
Why are you sounding like that?
Did anyone come home?

1934
02:45:44,569 --> 02:45:49,032
No' nobody came here.

1935
02:45:51,659 --> 02:45:57,624
The way my wife spoke to me shows
that she is hiding something.

1936
02:46:00,251 --> 02:46:03,129
They burnt 5 innocent
people to death..

1937
02:46:03,254 --> 02:46:06,383
..tell your husband to arrest
me for my wrongdoing..

1938
02:46:06,508 --> 02:46:09,552
..after my mother' you were the
one who showed love to me..

1939
02:46:09,678 --> 02:46:11,721
..and after that' that
girl loved me..

1940
02:46:11,846 --> 02:46:14,140
..he arrested that girl
unnecessarily..

1941
02:46:14,349 --> 02:46:18,895
..if anything happens to that
girl' l won't keep quite..

1942
02:46:19,020 --> 02:46:23,149
l pray to God everyday that
all should be happy..

1943
02:46:23,274 --> 02:46:27,654
..but now l know that you
all will never change.

1944
02:46:28,113 --> 02:46:32,659
But you should be happy' for
me you are important..

1945
02:46:32,784 --> 02:46:35,161
..for you' your husband
is important..

1946
02:46:35,286 --> 02:46:37,664
..so take him and go to
Bejawada immediately..

1947
02:46:37,789 --> 02:46:45,171
..or else! l won't harm
your husband in anyway..

1948
02:46:45,296 --> 02:46:47,674
..but if my men do something
to him' l can't help it..

1949
02:46:49,050 --> 02:46:51,678
By the time you go' he won't
be in the station.

1950
02:46:51,803 --> 02:46:53,930
He's not in the station now also..

1951
02:46:54,055 --> 02:46:55,348
..by the way you spoke
to him in the phone..

1952
02:46:55,473 --> 02:46:56,850
..he must have understood
that l am here.

1953
02:47:07,736 --> 02:47:09,612
Where is he?
- Go and search upstairs!

1954
02:47:09,738 --> 02:47:11,781
You go upstairs!..

1955
02:47:14,409 --> 02:47:16,786
..And you go to the
back of the house!..

1956
02:47:16,911 --> 02:47:18,955
..Search well! We should
not leave him!..

1957
02:47:24,085 --> 02:47:26,463
..l'll see how he
escapes from here..

1958
02:47:26,588 --> 02:47:28,965
..How could you think of
betraying your husband..

1959
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:30,800
..and your brothers?

1960
02:47:30,925 --> 02:47:37,307
..l know you very well'
and you lied to me.

1961

..lf you still hide
the truth from me..

..l will make that man
kiss you on your lips..

1965
02:48:26,773 --> 02:48:29,526
Aaru ! Take her with you.
Go away quickly.

1966
02:48:48,461 --> 02:48:50,296
What is all this?

1967
02:48:50,422 --> 02:48:52,799
lf you bring a girl to the station
without writing an FlR..

1968
02:48:52,924 --> 02:48:55,802
..and think of raping her'
this is what happens.

1969
02:50:16,758 --> 02:50:19,135
Get in ! Get in quickly!

1970
02:50:20,512 --> 02:50:21,971
Aaru !

1971
02:52:51,204 --> 02:52:59,295
Aaru ! Don't kill us! Please
don't do anything to us.

1972
02:53:03,091 --> 02:53:04,384
Give me the matchbox!

1973
02:53:04,509 --> 02:53:07,137
Aaru ! l am like your brother.

1974
02:53:09,764 --> 02:53:13,560
l won't kill you now' since
you called me your brother..

1975
02:53:18,189 --> 02:53:21,067
..Ey' Bhaskar! You are the one
who burnt those 5 people..

1976
02:53:21,192 --> 02:53:23,653

1977
02:53:26,239 --> 02:53:28,491
..You burn that fellow and
run away from here..

1978
02:53:28,616 --> 02:53:31,161

1980

Don't kill me..

1985
02:54:06,279 --> 02:54:08,281
..Now l won't leave you..

1986
02:54:08,406 --> 02:54:14,788
Don't come near! Don't come to me!

1987
02:55:06,464 --> 02:55:08,925
You don't take another
step in this regard..

1988
02:55:09,050 --> 02:55:10,927
..lntelligence report
is being made..

1989
02:55:11,052 --> 02:55:13,346
..lt will reach the cM any moment..

1990

..After that' the reaction
will be very severe..

1991
02:55:15,807 --> 02:55:18,601
..You could not even
catch that Aaru..

1992
02:55:18,727 --> 02:55:21,938
..Everybody in the country thinks
that l run Nath and co..

..two bodies in the gutter'
another two on the beach..

1995
02:55:29,571 --> 02:55:32,365
..and 30 people arrested
without any reason..

1996
02:55:32,490 --> 02:55:34,451
..you even got the police
station burnt..

1997
02:55:34,576 --> 02:55:35,952
..lf you think of yourself
as a hero..

1998
02:55:36,077 --> 02:55:37,537
..take off that uniform
and then settle matters.

1999
02:55:37,662 --> 02:55:41,374
Give me 24 hours. l will surely
kill him within that time.

2000
02:55:41,499 --> 02:55:43,209
So you think that you are
a big gangster' is it?..

2001
02:55:43,335 --> 02:55:45,712
..That fellow who is doing
everything so cleverly..

2002
02:55:45,837 --> 02:55:47,380
..without leaving any evidences..

2003
02:55:47,505 --> 02:55:48,882
..he is a real gangster.

2004
02:55:49,007 --> 02:55:53,219
Did you finish talking? Now
there is no end to this war..

2005
02:55:53,345 --> 02:55:56,222
..l don't care about anyone now..

2006
02:55:56,348 --> 02:56:02,479
..l won't leave that fellow
who is taking so many lives..

2007
02:56:09,110 --> 02:56:13,239
Yes' tell me Maha! Why
don't you speak?

2008
02:56:13,365 --> 02:56:15,742
l want to see you immediately.

2009
02:56:15,867 --> 02:56:17,494
Do you know where you are now..

2010
02:56:17,619 --> 02:56:21,164
..you have passed calcutta and
are going towards Bangladesh.

2011
02:56:21,289 --> 02:56:24,751
But l want to see you now.

2012
02:56:24,876 --> 02:56:27,003
Are you afraid that something
will happen to me..

2013
02:56:27,128 --> 02:56:30,757
..and you will never
be able to see me?..

2014
02:56:30,882 --> 02:56:33,677
..Don't be afraid. l will
be only yours one day.

2015
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:48,274
Sir! We just received some
information. - What is it?

2016
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,777
Aaru called up somebody
a few minutes ago..

2017
02:56:50,902 --> 02:56:53,279
..that cell was in
orissa yesterday..

2018
02:56:53,405 --> 02:56:55,365
..a little while ago it
showed up in calcutta..

2019
02:56:55,490 --> 02:56:57,617
..and now is reaching
the Bangladesh signal..

2020
02:56:57,742 --> 02:56:59,536
..And the cell from which
Aaru is speaking..

2021
02:56:59,661 --> 02:57:02,038
..is fluctuating between
Simhachalam and * signals.

2022
02:57:07,919 --> 02:57:10,797
Yes' what you said is correct..

2023
02:57:10,922 --> 02:57:13,299
..ln this area the signals
are fluctuating between..

2024
02:57:13,425 --> 02:57:14,968
..Simhachalam and * signals..

2025
02:57:15,093 --> 02:57:17,053
..He should be in
these surroundings.

2026
02:57:18,430 --> 02:57:23,560
Ask Kothapeta Bhai and Gajuvaka
Madhu to search for him..

2027
02:57:23,685 --> 02:57:25,979
..l am also entering
the battlefield now.

2028
02:58:02,891 --> 02:58:04,601
Where will you go?

2029
02:58:04,726 --> 02:58:07,354
Brother! We got to know that Aaru
is in Simhachalam forest.

2030
02:58:07,479 --> 02:58:09,022
common' let's go!

2031
02:58:14,027 --> 02:58:16,488
Aaru ! Police caught hold of David!..

2032
02:58:16,613 --> 02:58:19,824
..Ac got to know that you are
here' he is coming here.

2033
02:58:19,949 --> 02:58:22,118
l know. l asked David
to get himself caught..

2034
02:58:22,243 --> 02:58:23,536
..You all go from here now.

2035
02:58:23,661 --> 02:58:25,872
How can we leave you?
- Just do what l say.

2036
02:58:36,007 --> 02:58:37,384
Shall we call extra force sir?

2037
02:58:37,509 --> 02:58:39,636
This is just 5 kilometers
of forest..

2038
02:58:39,761 --> 02:58:42,138
..lf there is too much of force' it
will alert him' and he will escape..

2039
02:58:42,263 --> 02:58:43,556
..and another thing is that we
are not trying to catch him..

2040
02:58:43,682 --> 02:58:44,974
..we are going to kill him..

2041
02:58:45,100 --> 02:58:46,393
..keep your cell phones
on a silent mode..

2042
02:58:47,268 --> 02:58:49,062
..2 of you go this side..

2043
02:58:49,187 --> 02:58:50,897
..and you 2 go this side.

2044
02:59:29,102 --> 02:59:31,187
Purushottam! Kalidas! come on line.

2045
02:59:31,312 --> 02:59:34,190
Ey brother-in-law! Kalidas is dead.

2046
02:59:34,816 --> 02:59:36,609
Where are you?

2047
03:00:55,438 --> 03:00:57,899
Ey brother-in-law' l

2048
03:00:58,024 --> 03:01:00,276
Where are you?

2049
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:07,344
Your head will blast into
pieces if you move..

2050
03:02:07,469 --> 03:02:09,095
..Put your hands up.

2051
03:03:17,872 --> 03:03:21,167
Brother-in-law! l've tied up
Aaru in Simhachalam forest..

2052
03:03:21,292 --> 03:03:23,670
..come here quickly!

2053
03:03:25,046 --> 03:03:26,423
I am coming there..

2054
03:03:26,548 --> 03:03:27,924
..Drive faster!

2055
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:23,813
Brother-in-law!..

2056
03:04:26,900 --> 03:04:29,986
..Raja Rao! Brother-in-law!..

2057
03:04:30,111 --> 03:04:31,571
..come this way!

2058
03:04:33,865 --> 03:04:35,158
..Brother-in-law!

2059
03:04:40,121 --> 03:04:41,581
..catch him!

2060
03:04:51,383 --> 03:04:52,676
Ey' Vishwanath !..

2061
03:05:16,950 --> 03:05:18,785
..You don't know the
number of your sins..

2062
03:05:18,910 --> 03:05:21,287
..nor do you know the number
of bullets you've used..

2063
03:05:21,413 --> 03:05:24,124
..because l have used
them more than you.

2064
03:05:46,354 --> 03:07:39,551
SHALIMAR

2065
03:08:01,573 --> 03:08:05,201
Are you planning to die so easily'
in an instant?..

2066
03:08:05,326 --> 03:08:08,955
..anyone can easily die by
eating rat poison too..

2067
03:08:09,080 --> 03:08:10,623
..the difficult thing is to live..

2068
03:08:10,749 --> 03:08:13,543
..to live and to suffer punishment
is even more difficult..

2069
03:08:16,588 --> 03:08:18,965
..when innocent people can
be burned to death..

2070
03:08:19,090 --> 03:08:22,052
..why should you the doer of
all crimes not die in pain?..

2071
03:08:24,095 --> 03:08:29,559
..your story and my story should
be a lesson to all gangsters.

2072
03:08:30,518 --> 03:08:31,895
Ey!

2073
03:08:39,027 --> 03:08:40,320
Sssh !..

2074
03:08:46,743 --> 03:08:50,246
..You proudly walked with your
chest up' like a hero..

2075
03:08:50,372 --> 03:08:52,749
..l'll turn you into
a torn trash paper..

2076
03:08:52,874 --> 03:08:55,251
..you will be so ashamed that you
will never come out of the house..

2077
03:08:55,377 --> 03:08:56,920
..even if you come out..

2078
03:08:57,045 --> 03:08:59,005
..all those who respected you once'
will spit on your face..

2079
03:08:59,130 --> 03:09:01,508
..you will not be able
to bear that shame..

2080
03:09:01,633 --> 03:09:03,176
..and wish everyday
that you were dead..

2081
03:09:03,301 --> 03:09:05,261
..who will come to your aid'
you old man of 45 years?..

2082
03:09:05,387 --> 03:09:07,764
..you are a pig who
eats shit for money..

2083
03:09:07,889 --> 03:09:10,266
..even if you think of selling your
property to live in your old age..

2084
03:09:10,392 --> 03:09:12,769
..you will not be able to sign'
or to put your finger prints..

2085
03:09:12,894 --> 03:09:15,522
..you will starve to death
with no hands to eat..

2086
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:16,940
..and nobody to feed you..

2087
03:09:17,065 --> 03:09:19,025
..from now on' you should
beg somebody..

2088
03:09:19,150 --> 03:09:20,944
..to feed you' and
to wash your back..

2089
03:09:21,653 --> 03:09:24,030
..why do you look so confused..

2090
03:09:24,155 --> 03:09:25,865
..are you thinking of
what I'll do to you?..

2091
03:09:25,990 --> 03:09:27,784
..if l kill you' you will be
in pain only till you die..

2092
03:09:27,909 --> 03:09:32,956
..if l make you handicapped' you'll
be in pain as long as you live.

2093
03:09:41,089 --> 03:09:43,216
Aaru ! Don't do it.

2094
03:10:07,240 --> 03:10:09,075
I think now you understood..

2095
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:10,744
..that if a poor man wants to..

2096
03:10:10,869 --> 03:10:12,829
..he can turn a rich
man into a poor man.

2097
03:10:44,778 --> 03:10:46,613
We are going to chennai..

2098
03:10:46,738 --> 03:10:49,115
..You all also go to
some other place..

2099
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:51,618
..lf we stay here' we'll
go back to our old ways..

2100
03:10:51,743 --> 03:10:54,120
..and become gangsters again..

2101
03:10:54,245 --> 03:10:56,623
..it is wrong to expect that
everybody should fear us..

2102
03:10:56,748 --> 03:11:00,543
..l've come to know that only
honesty can bring peace..

2103
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:03,380
..l will go now.

2104
03:11:04,172 --> 03:11:05,465
Aaru !

2105
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:07,884
I will see you later.

2106
03:11:10,512 --> 03:11:12,889
..Sister' I am going.

2107
03:11:30,865 --> 03:11:32,158
You told them we are
going to chennai..

2108
03:11:32,283 --> 03:11:33,576
..but you told me we are
going to Hyderabad..

2109
03:11:33,702 --> 03:11:34,994
..finally where are we going?

2110
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:37,414
We are not going to chennai.
We'll go to Pune..

2111
03:11:38,039 --> 03:11:41,668
..Nobody should know where I am..

2112
03:11:43,044 --> 03:11:46,673
..I told you I'll be only
yours. That's why.
