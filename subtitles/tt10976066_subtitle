1
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,840
Her love for Him
Made Her the Almighty...

2
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,440
"My soul..."

3
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,120
SUFI AND SUJATHA

4
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,800
"In the name of Allah,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful"

5
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,400
Praise be to God!

6
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Oh God!

7
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,400
God is the greatest.

8
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Peace be upon you.

9
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,040
And peace be upon you, too.

10
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Who are you?

11
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
I'm Sufi.

12
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Sufi?

13
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
It's faulty.
Won't work.

14
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Goodness gracious!

15
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,960
I've been here for 2-3 years...

16
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,200
But except for the name "Jinn Mosque",
I don't know much about this place.

17
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,999
Ever since the Badr mosque opened,

18
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,240
people stopped coming here
except for burial prayers.

19
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Since it's Master Aboob's death anniversary,
A few Sufis might come in these two days.

20
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,040
They are reciting prayers
from the attic.

21
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,520
God knows what will happen to them
when this is demolished.

22
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,600
They are planning to renovate
this building too with concrete.

23
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,880
The other side has
already been demolished.

24
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,720
They will bring this down
after the other side is done.

25
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,640
Then all of this will
become a henna grove.

26
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,560
It's the deceased
who need space.

27
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm just blabbering...

28
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,920
Where are you coming from?

29
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,160
Have you come for the anniversary?

30
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I see...

31
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,560
Have you come by crossing the river?

32
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
This way, there is a
new road and gate now.

33
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,360
I didn't know. It's been 10 years
since I came here last.

34
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,440
Whose tomb is that under that tree?

35
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
My master's.

36
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
Aboob's...

37
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,040
So... You are?

38
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm his disciple.

39
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,800
Oh, you are Aboob's disciple...

40
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,200
That explains...

41
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,840
God! It's time for the prayer call.

42
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,800
Shall I make the call for prayer today?

43
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
Of course,
God willing.

44
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,960
If I can be the prayer leader
in front of a few because of you, why not?

45
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
Being Aboob's disciple,
you must be knowing a trick or two.

46
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,360
My prayer call won't...

47
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,560
If you manage to get ten people,
we're in luck.

48
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Are ten people enough?

49
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Plenty!

50
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,200
For yesterday's morning prayer,
the helper boy and I were the only ones.

51
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,160
Once today's morning prayer is done,
I'm planning to go to my hometown.

52
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,680
You need someone around to talk to!

53
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,040
"Allah is the greatest"

54
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,000
"Allah is the greatest"

55
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,640
"I bear witness that
there is no deity but Allah"

56
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,720
Hey, whose is the prayer call?

57
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,920
Perhaps a singer who is visiting.

58
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,640
"I bear witness that
there is no deity but Allah"

59
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
Isn't it from the Jinn mosque?

60
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Ya...

61
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,840
"I bear witness that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah"

62
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,080
What's it, people?
Where are you off to?

63
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:48,160
"Prayer is better than sleep"

64
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,560
It's deep. Watch your step.

65
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Should have come through the bridge.

66
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,800
"Allah is the greatest"

67
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:14,560
"There is no deity but Allah"

68
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,440
"God is the greatest."

69
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,440
"In the name of God
the most gracious, the most merciful."

70
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
"God is the greatest."

71
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,280
"God hears whoever praises Him."

72
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,560
"God is the greatest."

73
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,160
"God is the greatest."

74
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,040
"God is the greatest."

75
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,840
"God is the greatest."

76
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,360
"May Peace and Mercy of Allah be upon You."

77
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Oh God!

78
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,480
God! What happened?

79
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Lift him.

80
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,560
Get some water.

81
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
Somebody bring water...

82
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
What's it, master?

83
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
"Verily we belong to God,
and verily to Him do we return."

84
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:47,720
"Oh God, I have surrendered myself to you."

85
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,680
"God, oh my Almighty."

86
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
It seems a girl around here
has a rosary similar to this.

87
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,080
What craziness are you saying?
A Rosary?

88
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,000
Secretary and President
should arrive at a decision.

89
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
It's a silent cardiac arrest.
Isn't it?

90
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Do people need a reason to die?

91
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Where will we bury him?
Yes, think of that.

92
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,760
I'll go for a quick visit to my hometown.

93
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,060
No, you can leave only after this.

94
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,480
What should we announce?

95
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,200
We'll announce with what we know.

96
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,239
That...

97
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Inform that Shafeeq.

98
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,320
Dear Shafeeq, why do you
have to dismantle all of this?

99
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't you have announcements today?

100
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,400
So what? Isn't this different?

101
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
Hurry... Hurry...

102
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,040
One minute. We should inform
everyone of the death.

103
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,560
Come closer.
Sujatha's husband too.

104
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,920
Dr. VR Rajeev?

105
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
He has promised to get me a job visa.
But he's not picking up the call.

106
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,720
Dad, phone.
"Shafeeq"

107
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,199
Did you bath?

108
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,800
- Ya.
- Looking cute.

109
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Shafeeq, this visa matter
won't happen in a jiffy.

110
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,480
- You give me some time.
- Not that, man! I've sent you a voice...

111
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Hello!

112
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Hello!

113
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,320
Brother, I'd called you.

114
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,640
That Sufi...
You know - Sujatha's...

115
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,120
He died during the morning prayer today.

116
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,760
Did you hear?
Just inform her.

117
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Brother, I'd called you.

118
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,280
That Sufi...
You know - Sujatha's...

119
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,560
He died during the morning prayer today.

120
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Did you hear?
Just inform her.

121
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
There's a message.

122
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,280
Brother, I'd called you.

123
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,800
That Sufi...
You know - Sujatha's...

124
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,160
He died during the morning prayer today.

125
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Did you hear?
Just inform her.

126
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,560
"My soul..."

127
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,120
"My gleam of hope..."

128
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
"Verily we belong to God,
and verily to Him do we return."

129
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,120
Announcing with immense grief,
the demise of "Sufi"...

130
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,560
...the disciple of Mulla Aboobackar alias
Master Aboob of Mulla Bazaar Jinn mosque

131
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,560
The burial will happen today at 6 o'clock
at the Jinn mosque burial ground.

132
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Reduce the volume.

133
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Reduce the volume.

134
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Are you out of your mind?

135
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,840
If our daughter asks about this,
what should I tell her?

136
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,360
That your lover died?

137
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Do one thing.

138
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,559
Get ready.

139
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Let's go home.

140
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Let's go and see him.

141
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,740
It will cure this illness of yours.

142
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,120
We can leave our daughter with Syed.

143
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Don't sit there like a corpse.
Get ready!

144
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Move that pickaxe.

145
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Take that basket.

146
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
The thing is...

147
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,320
Now if there is anyone who doesn't know me,
they will not be offended.

148
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Did anyone here ask
your religion, Kumaran?

149
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
Lots of people are
going to be here, isn't it?

150
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
There is a lot...

151
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
The soil is very fertile.

152
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,280
It's bearing fruits for the first time.

153
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,560
Hey Moosa,
what are you doing?!

154
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Why are you spitting on Master's tomb?

155
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,400
He didn't have the fortune of
eating fruit from this tree.

156
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,960
This was the first grave that I dug.

157
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,080
Here rests the man
who removed my fear.

158
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
You see this?

159
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,281
What?

160
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,280
I was afraid of even going out.
Now I bury the dead just like that.

161
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
Didn't he get his burial place
dug before his death?

162
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,640
Yes. I came to know that
only after I had dug it.

163
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,200
Was he really so fond of you?

164
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
In fact more than me,
he liked the Sufi.

165
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Sufi?

166
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,839
Do you know that story?

167
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Which story?

168
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Mulla Bazaar...

169
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Come fast...

170
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Hurry...

171
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,240
Hurry up.
The bus is leaving.

172
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Hey!

173
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
Do you know EK Aboob's house?

174
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Clarinet...

175
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,640
How do you know Master?

176
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,520
If you are headed to the
Jinn mosque, go that way.

177
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
This is quite deep.

178
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Even the locals lose their grip.
That's why I warned.

179
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,000
Wait, Master's house is in
Mulla Bazaar. You passed it.

180
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,840
If I give a call to prayer in
that mosque, can Aboob hear?

181
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Of course! So you haven't
come to meet the Master?

182
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm his driver.

183
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,120
We all call him "Master".

184
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,400
- What's your name?
- Chanu.

185
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
So, he's not an Indian...

186
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,760
Kumar... Kumar!

187
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,159
Ya...

188
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,960
The boss has asked you to come.

189
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,960
Couldn't you have said
I've work at the mosque?

190
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,760
Go say it yourself.

191
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Nonsense!

192
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
There's a car over there too.
May be to drive that.

193
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,320
Always calls when I'm up to something else.

194
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,640
Let me give an example for that.

195
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Is it another joke?

196
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Not a joke!

197
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,040
No. This incident was in...

198
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,160
Was it last year?
Yes, last year.

199
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,120
We had visited the Taj Mahal.

200
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
Doesn't the river Yamuna
flow under it?

201
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
This fellow...

202
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I didn't hear.

203
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,640
When Sujatha said it first,
I didn't believe it.

204
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,360
Only after closing this ear and putting
the other on the ground I sensed it.

205
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,480
Yamuna flowing...

206
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,400
Quite unbelievable.

207
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
Ears are extra sharp.
Eyes too...

208
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,920
She had cried at birth.
What happened after that...

209
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,000
...I have no clue.

210
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,600
Usually the deaf are
the ones who become mute.

211
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,240
What's the use of talking a lot.
Isn't it, Nair?

212
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,120
- I'm Menon.
- Oh!

213
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,840
Our role here is to know your opinion
and convey it to Rajeev if it's positive.

214
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,280
They were teacher and disciple.

215
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
No better way to know each other.

216
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
She is here.

217
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,719
By the way...

218
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,240
Where in the Gulf is he?

219
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Fujairah.

220
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,400
Everyone is going to be Dubai people.

221
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
What's it?

222
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,280
The entire south is going westward.

223
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,480
She teaches dance at Makkali
three days a week.

224
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,080
It's evident in the way she walks.

225
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Come on.

226
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Greet them.

227
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,720
They're Rajeev's relatives.

228
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,560
They've come to meet you.

229
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,000
- Haven't you told her?
- What's your opinion?

230
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,560
She doesn't have a decision
above my word.

231
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,119
Where did you take this from?

232
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,440
This was from...

233
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,559
What?

234
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,400
Keep it back where you took it from.

235
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
OK.

236
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,240
Didn't you clear the bushes near the pond?

237
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,840
Mom says she saw a snake there.

238
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
It'll be just a rat snake.
Pour some kerosene around.

239
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,400
Fine.
You do it, Kumaran.

240
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I get nausea by the smell of kerosene.
Else I would have done it, Ma'am.

241
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,720
He's a driver now.

242
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,960
You can't make him do
unpaid labour like in the old days.

243
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Bear that in mind.

244
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,040
He and his family reside in our land.
Isn't it more than a salary?

245
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,120
She has read some books and
blabbers something. No idea what...

246
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Eh?

247
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,920
This book is the problem here now.
Return this and pick some stories.

248
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
Mom.. That isn't what she said...

249
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
That is exactly what I said.

250
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,120
Hey, don't go out
seeing Kumaran.

251
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Come here.

252
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,840
Don't talk nonsense and ruin
our good name. He respects me.

253
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,560
Dear, did you have something?

254
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
Will you be back before dark?

255
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,880
Which verse is it?

256
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,160
Chapter An-Nisa

257
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,160
When I ask verse, you say chapter?
Kohl-eyed!

258
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,460
When I ask verse,
you say chapter? Kohl-eyed!

259
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Wash your feet first...

260
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
- Peace be upon you
- And peace be upon you, too.

261
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,280
Praise be to God!

262
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,840
"God is the greatest."

263
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
It's him!

264
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
My Sufi..

265
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,080
Take me near that prayer call.

266
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Hurry...

267
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,920
Kumaran...

268
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,919
Yes?

269
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,680
- Where is Kumaran?
- He has gone to Sujatha's house.

270
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,760
Won't get anyone
when it's needed.

271
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Where did you get this from?

272
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
This is his call to prayer.

273
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Haven't I told you?
Sufi, the master of all arts...

274
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,560
Can you please bring him?

275
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,480
Leela, lock that door.

276
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
OK

277
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,640
Sujatha,
Water is low in the river.

278
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Take care.

279
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,280
"Hasten to the prayer"

280
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,280
"Hasten to the salvation"

281
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,200
"Allah is the greatest"

282
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:51,640
"There is no deity but Allah."

283
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Praise be to God.

284
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,680
- Peace be upon you, Master.
- And peace be upon you, too.

285
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,680
Hey, Khwaja!

286
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I'm here...

287
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
God willing.

288
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
My Sufi...

289
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Master...

290
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
You may leave.

291
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,920
- Where were you this long, son?
- At your old shrine.

292
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
Praise be to God!

293
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,720
Anyone to get down here?

294
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Come on, fast...

295
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Where are you off to?

296
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
I'm not going home.
Need to go to the court.

297
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,480
Tell mom that I'll be a bit late.

298
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
Praise be to God.

299
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,720
"Oh God, I have surrendered
myself to you."

300
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,119
Oh God!

301
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
God has willed it!

302
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Show me that toe.

303
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,960
Say "Praise be to God"

304
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,640
Praise be to God.

305
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Pain is gone.

306
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,040
One should say this when it pains -
"Praise be to God". Thank God!

307
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
His 'Rooh' is here.

308
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,280
'Rooh' means soul.

309
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,200
She's the only dancer
in this congregation - Sujatha.

310
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,800
Teaches children too.
What's it?

311
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,240
Oh ya, Kathak.

312
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,880
What about playing
our song in this?

313
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
He has brought it.
From Ajmer.

314
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
That finger is enchanted by Jinn.

315
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,860
Now you need to go only
for breaking the fast.

316
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,160
What about the afternoon prayer call?

317
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,560
God has willed it!

318
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,160
Not just Muslims, the admirers
in Mulla Bazaar are increasing.

319
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,080
Nothing can match your song.

320
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Is it?

321
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,920
Praise be to God

322
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,960
"I seek Allah's protection
from Satan who is accursed"

323
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,920
"In the name of Allah,
Most Gracious, Most Merciful"

324
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,360
"Yaa Seen"

325
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,480
"I swear by the Quran full of wisdom"

326
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,920
"Most surely you are one of the messengers."

327
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,320
"On a right way"

328
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,440
- "Tanzeelul 'Azeezir Raheem"
- Tanzeelal...

329
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,240
"A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful."

330
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,960
"That you may warn a people whose forefathers
were not warned, so they are unaware."

331
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,920
"My Soul...

332
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,200
"My soul..."

333
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,960
"God is the greatest"

334
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,040
"God is the greatest"

335
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:41,680
"I bear witness
that there is no deity but Allah."

336
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:52,080
"I bear witness that everything
begins and ends in you."

337
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:06,280
"I bear witness that Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah"

338
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,918
"It's through my beloved
who is your messenger

339
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:18,920
that I have known you and lived till now."

340
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,400
"Hasten to the prayer."

341
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,800
"Come, let us become one"

342
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,440
"Hasten to the salvation."

343
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,880
"Come, let us triumph"

344
00:45:52,640 --> 00:46:03,360
"It's another dawn! Awake!
Prayer is more reviving than sleep."

345
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:15,640
"Wake up and come.
Sit by my side."

346
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,880
"God is the greatest."

347
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,880
"You are everything."

348
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,920
"Like there is no you without me
Like you have no one except me"

349
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:47,960
"Come, let us become one"

350
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,840
Sufis are...

351
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,640
...Saints who sing and dance.

352
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
The real name will be something else.

353
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,080
They call this time...

354
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,560
..."the grand bath"

355
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
With hair full of oil..

356
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,120
Instead of this turmeric,
henna is applied...

357
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,720
...on the hands and feet.

358
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,360
How marvelous they look!

359
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,680
At this rate, you will go bald
before you go grey.

360
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,960
You should use henna oil.

361
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,680
No no.

362
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,560
Those are planted over the tombs.

363
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,000
Moreover, women are not supposed to
enter there, except as dead.

364
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,920
But I've been there.

365
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,080
She won't have any big wishes. Just that
it's someone who would appreciate dance.

366
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,081
Mom...

367
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:02,800
They are Rajeev's uncle and aunt.

368
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,160
They were visiting a nearby temple
and dropped in to meet Sujatha.

369
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,640
If we came unannounced, thought
we could see her without makeup.

370
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,560
After Onam, you can see
to your heart's content.

371
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,000
Fat chance!

372
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,543
He's trying to get a marriage
certificate before marriage.

373
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:19,080
So that he can take her abroad sooner.

374
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,920
So you are not at the same place?

375
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,600
We live in Sharjah
and work in Dubai.

376
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
I see..

377
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
Excuse me.

378
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,640
It's that Baputty's son.

379
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,400
All the documents are here.

380
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,080
Your dad wanted to put it all
in something and send.

381
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,920
Please scan, copy into this and send.

382
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,280
Don't open it.
Take it to someone who knows it.

383
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
OK.

384
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,960
One moment.

385
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,520
- So I'll be off.
- Bye.

386
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,280
He talks about some scanning.
It's such a tiny thing.

387
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Where's Suja?

388
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,960
Eh?
- Sujatha, your daughter...

389
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
She's upstairs.

390
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Ya, give it.

391
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Her world is upstairs.
Shall I call her?

392
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,360
No need.
Let her see that world.

393
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,240
He has sent some stuff.

394
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,760
For you too, Grandma.

395
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,480
Come on.

396
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,800
It's this way.

397
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Dear...

398
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,840
I'm Rajeev's aunt.

399
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,400
He instructed me specifically
to give this to you.

400
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Your old professor.

401
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,640
Here are some of his photos.

402
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,080
We were visiting the nearby temple.

403
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
So thought of meeting you.

404
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,480
We'll go back next week.

405
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,440
Henna from these tomb plants
is said to be blood red.

406
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,440
How old are you, Sujatha?

407
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,480
I've never seen such a beautiful '22'
in any other language in the world.

408
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,880
If you can hear,
why can't you talk?

409
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,560
One day you will talk, Sujatha.

410
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,920
When the black plum tree
Aboob talks about bears fruit.

411
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
God willing.

412
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,440
Here... Move aside the book.

413
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,280
Want this?

414
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,080
Hello Sujatha,
Remember me?

415
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,640
During my research, I'd come for a seminar
at Prathibha College in Mulla Bazaar.

416
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,480
This proposal is through your classmate
Shafeeq, whom I had met there.

417
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,240
Looking back, I feel that the seminar
was meant just for me to meet you.

418
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,880
I wanted to ask directly then.

419
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
Do write.

420
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,160
Else I'll interpret your silence as consent.

421
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,040
This is my company's diary.

422
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,480
I have only 30 days of leave a year.

423
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,920
The attempt is to
find a match in that time.

424
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,800
Waiting for your reply.

425
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Rajeev.

426
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,200
What has he written?

427
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,240
What have you done?

428
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,280
Why did you destroy a gift?

429
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,320
He'll be keeping tabs of everything.
Doesn't he have a doctorate in Maths?

430
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,640
Yes. Dr. VR Rajeevan.

431
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,720
Not a physician.

432
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
I know that.

433
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,320
He must be a good guy, Ammu.

434
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,840
After all, doesn't he know you?

435
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,800
"White dove at the doorstep"

436
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,440
"Heard it knocking with words"

437
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,840
"Oh my soul"

438
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,280
"White dove at the doorstep"

439
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,040
"Heard it knocking with words"

440
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,480
"Into me, a mere drop, entered..."

441
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,160
"A sea that's you,
My dear"

442
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,640
"A sea that's you..."

443
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,480
"Oh Lord!
Have mercy on us."

444
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,800
"Show us the right path.
Love us."

445
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,840
"Oh Lord!
Have mercy on us."

446
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,640
"Show us the right path.
Love us."

447
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,440
SUFI, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

448
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,560
"Heard it knocking with words"

449
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,280
"Whirling around like a breeze"

450
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,080
"Kissing between my eyes"

451
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,920
"Filling my breath with fire"

452
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,560
"You, my soul!? My soul..."

453
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,400
"The Henna grove winks
with black plum fruits"

454
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:17,360
"Mulla Bazaar opens
a bottle of exotic perfume"

455
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,880
"Parrots who chant prayers"

456
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,840
"What do those darlings? Say?"

457
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,720
"I have the answer"

458
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,440
"There are many"

459
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,280
"Slices of love,
My dear"

460
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,720
"Slices of love..."

461
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,920
"White dove at the doorstep"

462
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,040
"Heard it knocking with words"

463
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,240
"Diving into the whirlpool"

464
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,160
"Touching my anklets"

465
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,160
"Glowing like a silvery fish"

466
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,040
"You, my soul!? My soul..."

467
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:28,840
"Golden light falls on
the? Jinn mosque yard"

468
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:37,200
"The radiance of love turns
even pain into honey drops"

469
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,080
"Poured myself into a page"

470
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,040
"Worded myself as a letter"

471
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,760
"And gave you"

472
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,560
"Open it up"

473
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,720
"A chapter that's me,
My dear"

474
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,360
"A chapter that's me..."

475
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,960
"White dove at the doorstep"

476
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,360
"Heard it knocking with words"

477
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,280
"Oh Lord!
Have mercy on us."

478
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,880
"Show us the right path.
Love us."

479
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,680
"Oh Lord!
Have mercy on us."

480
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,920
"Show us the right path.
Love us."

481
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,880
May God be your protector!

482
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,720
We've tried everything.

483
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
He will be alright.
I will pray for him.

484
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
Thank you.

485
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,200
God is the greatest!

486
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,400
"My supreme master,
the exalted"

487
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,000
"My soul"

488
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Don't leave.

489
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know what a joy
it is to see you.

490
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,320
Master, I...

491
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,800
I don't want this here.

492
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,380
I've lost the strength
to play anything in this.

493
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,880
- Master...
- Go away!

494
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,400
If you want a companion and family,
there are proper ways for it.

495
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:55,080
"Allah is the greatest"

496
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,800
"There is no deity but Allah"

497
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,120
Peace be upon you

498
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,240
Did you see the moon of Eid?

499
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,400
What happened, brother?

500
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,360
- Happy Eid.
- Happy Eid.

501
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,640
Peace be upon you.

502
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,640
"My soul..."

503
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:04,720
"Oh, creator of this universe.
Oh, my protector."

504
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,000
"Remember life is so easily lost"

505
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:57,200
"Life is as fleeting as
a drop of water on hot metal"

506
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,440
They say when you cut
the mango tree, cut it completely.

507
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:10,120
You mean there should be
one mango tree per person?

508
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,760
All these are beliefs.

509
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,800
If just a branch is cut and the tree left,
deaths are said to recur.

510
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,520
We can tie two more sheets.
One here too...

511
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
"My soul..."

512
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,320
It's from the guy who sings
prayer calls at the mosque...

513
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,000
What are you searching?

514
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,880
Can she hear, Thankamani?

515
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,720
Yes, better than us.

516
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,440
I don't know anyone here.

517
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,440
My daughter, Sujatha
is getting married.

518
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,520
- Wrote?
- Ya.

519
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:48,240
The groom is Rajeev,
son of Thekkeppadikkal Gopalan Nair.

520
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,760
Have you decided?

521
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
Yes.

522
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,320
Next Friday.

523
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,080
Please avoid Friday.

524
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,640
I'll decide that.

525
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,200
Then you write.

526
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,920
You don't need high literature
to write this.

527
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,080
She is my only child, Aboob.

528
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,840
A speechless being.

529
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,000
Don't start a "jihad" using her.

530
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,880
Speak in a language I understand.

531
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,720
It's written in it, in a language
that only you people understand.

532
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Read it.

533
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
What's it?

534
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,800
People will accuse you and your community
of trying to convert her to your religion.

535
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,160
Which people?

536
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,480
Religion is a person's view.

537
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,760
Those kids won't change
their views for others.

538
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,080
This 'jihad' is something
I don't understand...

539
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,200
I know.

540
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,440
It's a war to increase
the population of your community.

541
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,880
War is being waged inside their minds.

542
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,000
If you can't understand it,
how can you call yourself a father?

543
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,320
You better get some sleep.

544
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,680
It's called "Love Jihad" these days!

545
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,160
What's wrong with you?
It's love. Pure love...

546
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,560
All are same, Kumaran.

547
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,200
Sujatha had become enchanted
by this Sufi's song.

548
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,760
Kumaran, it's not a song,
it's the prayer call.

549
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,000
Ya, that only.

550
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,959
Now we need to tie a sheet over this.
- For what?

551
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,480
It'll rain.
There was loud thunder yesterday.

552
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,120
Rain, in this summer!

553
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,720
You do as you are told.

554
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,720
Water shouldn't seep in
before the soil is hardened.

555
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,360
- Your master must have taught you this also.
- Of course he has.

556
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,920
Tie it if you want to.

557
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,360
Water seeping in or not, once covered
the tomb is the world of angels.

558
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,960
You know that?

559
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,660
It's time for the burial.
Hurry up!

560
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,480
Hey you,
Take that sheet.

561
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,680
Ya

562
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,380
If they've come to know
about it, they'll come.

563
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,800
Who?

564
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Fasten your seat belt.

565
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,320
Ma'am, put on your seat belt.

566
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Wait.

567
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,720
- Any help?
- No.

568
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,040
Hello Shafeeq.

569
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,560
We've arrived.
We are on the way.

570
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,560
We will come there straight away.

571
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,320
How far is the Jinn Mosque from here?

572
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,560
- Will be there real quick.
- Will be there real quick.

573
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,200
We'll reach before
6 o'clock for sure.

574
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
OK.

575
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
Where exactly did you say...

576
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,400
One moment...

577
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,480
Yes, Syed. We've reached.
We are on the way.

578
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,920
Is my child okay? Message me
when you're free. I'll call you.

579
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,320
Sorry, what was it?

580
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,720
Where exactly are you in Dubai?

581
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,920
Bur Dubai.

582
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,160
What? Another Dubai within Dubai?

583
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,000
My sister is in Dubai.

584
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,760
Not the Dubai you mentioned,
but some other place like that.

585
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,720
She had eloped with someone.
Now living happily with him and kids.

586
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,200
Focus on your driving.

587
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,640
Sir, what do you do?

588
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,480
At an insurance firm.

589
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,880
Oh.

590
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,360
Tell me, if this car catches fire now,
will I get insurance?

591
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,360
Switch on the AC.

592
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,320
You can't switch it on like that.

593
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,760
It needs a couple of knocks like this
to work.

594
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,080
Now it will work fine for about 20 minutes.

595
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,720
Hello.

596
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,280
What?

597
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,640
Have you hospitalised Sunitha?

598
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,840
When?

599
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,800
You must talk on the phone
when you drive, right?

600
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,199
Sir, my wife is pregnant all of a sudden...
- Wife what?!

601
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,240
No, my wife is hospitalised for delivery...

602
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,360
It's a call from the hospital...

603
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,720
Who are these people?

604
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,620
- I've picked them from the airport.
- Come out.

605
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,120
Did he leave?
Didn't return?

606
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,960
What's up with this guy?

607
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Sir, It's...

608
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:08,999
Where is your uniform?

609
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Because my wife is pregnant...

610
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,320
Move him to the side.

611
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,720
Out of my way.

612
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,960
Who are the others in the car?

613
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,200
I've picked them from the airport.

614
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,360
Sir.

615
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,960
We have come from Dubai.

616
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,840
At 6, we have to attend a cremation.
If we don't hurry, we will miss it.

617
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:34,039
What's your name?

618
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,040
I am Rajeev.

619
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
Where is the cremation?

620
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,440
At the Jinn mosque.

621
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,240
Pay a fine of 500 and you can leave.

622
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
Sign here.

623
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,560
Thank you.

624
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,160
Hey, you.
Don't you want this?

625
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,080
Sorry.

626
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,120
- Leave.
- Sir, we're off.

627
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,960
In the eastern banks of Kabini guarded
by Banasura mountain and Brahmagiri...

628
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:17,560
Blessed by the footsteps of
Ghulam Ali Sufi and Mullah Habeeb...

629
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,080
The Jinn mosque where the supreme saint
EK Aboob's soul was laid to rest...

630
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,760
Whose 9th anniversary
will be celebrated tonight...

631
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,560
From 9 o'clock onwards at Aboob Nagar
with Sufi music and dance forms...

632
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,920
We heartily welcome you all
to immerse yourself...

633
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,480
In the musical night by the
famous Qawwali singer Sadiqali Azeez.

634
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,920
What is this, brother? Please reverse.
I have to go a long way.

635
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,200
OK OK. We will go back.

636
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,080
Dear all, on the subject of
"The path to afterlife"...

637
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,400
Addressing you in the voice
that is sweeping our land...

638
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:56,200
The illustrious orator
Master Shibukatullah Saqafi.

639
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,640
We welcome you all to the programme
irrespective of religion or caste...

640
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,880
"There is no creator except God."

641
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,880
It's muddy. Don't lean.
Move away from there.

642
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,920
JINN MOSQUE

643
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,480
Keep it here.

644
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,440
I'm good, sir.

645
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,560
I haven't forgotten.

646
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,080
I'll be there at 11.

647
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,840
Don't worry about the meeting.
I'll be there.

648
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
God bless you.

649
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,200
Shafeeq, we've reached.
Where are you?

650
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,040
You stay there.
I'll come out.

651
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,000
Do you have any idea
how long we've been waiting for you?

652
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,560
Sorry, there was heavy traffic on the way.
Shall we go in and see?

653
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,120
Not possible anymore.
The body is already in the grave.

654
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,760
Do you think it's fair, Shafeeq?
We've flown all the way just for this.

655
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:16,659
We just need to see for one minute.

656
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,360
Forget it, you cannot even
see it for one second.

657
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,840
Moreover, women are not
allowed into the graveyard.

658
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,640
Are you telling me this now?
Couldn't you say this in the morning?

659
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,640
I wouldn't have brought Sujatha
if I had known this.

660
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,285
I didn't know that Sujatha was coming.

661
01:17:27,286 --> 01:17:28,960
You could have attended,
had you been here early.

662
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,560
I have been telling you to rush.

663
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,560
I am not aware of your customs.
You must find a way out. Please.

664
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,560
What can I do?
I am helpless.

665
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,000
Shafeeq, why are you here?
They were looking for you.

666
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,240
I will be there soon.
Call you later.

667
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:44,399
Who is he?

668
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,440
He is Sufi's close friend.
He has come from Dubai for this.

669
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,740
Oh, you also come then.
You can toss some soil into the grave.

670
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,440
Shafeeq!

671
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,360
Come if you want to.
Sujatha can't.

672
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,360
Come with me.
They might agree if they see you.

673
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,080
Come out.

674
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,440
Why did we come this far then?

675
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,840
Get out.

676
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,800
All those who want to
toss soil can do so now.

677
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:21,440
"Oh God, kindly grant him
the time that he is asking for."

678
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,720
"Oh God, kindly give him
the answers he is seeking for."

679
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,680
My dear, what a surprise.

680
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,360
You didn't even call us.

681
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,080
Why this sudden visit?
Didn't you bring the little one?

682
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,040
MASTER EK ABOOB'S 9TH ANNIVERSARY

683
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:40,880
"Totally forgotten..."

684
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,940
If he comes, you'll know
from the prayer call.

685
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,640
What are you searching for?

686
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,280
Where are all the books
that you had taken?

687
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,720
How fast people change!

688
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,000
God...

689
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,200
No need. The fever will go down
with a medicinal coffee.

690
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,120
You have dark circles,
as if your kohl is spread.

691
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,480
What's wrong?

692
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,880
You must sleep.
Sleep really well.

693
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,400
When you're in deep slumber,
only the almighty will be with you.

694
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,920
God is what you breathe.

695
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,040
Do you snore, Sujatha?

696
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,200
They say Satan resides in the
nose tip of those who snore.

697
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:37,560
Be it Satan, demon or angel, it can enter
your mind only after you wake up.

698
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,760
So, you must get some deep sleep.

699
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:46,200
It's only when they are awake,
people remember their own names.

700
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,640
There is no untouchability when you sleep.

701
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:56,400
Do you think about caste, religion,
anger, sorrow or hate in your sleep?

702
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,360
Not at all.

703
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,800
Only the Almighty...

704
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,640
All these are mere illusions.

705
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,960
Illusions of the sleepless folk.

706
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,320
Sufi's musical prayer call
was also an illusion.

707
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:19,360
The world is enormous.
You can hear him from wherever you are.

708
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:25,080
That's enough.
That's enough, Sujatha...

709
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:35,480
"Even longing has conceded its defeat..."

710
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:50,120
"The void you've left, is quite huge..."

711
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,200
Why are you going that way, dear?

712
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,480
If you are going to the Jinn mosque,
I can drop you. Keep the cycle aside.

713
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:07,200
"You have taken away
my soul from me, my beloved."

714
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:15,560
"What will I do?"

715
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:30,000
"Sorrow of separation is what
this heart is suffering now."

716
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:37,040
"My love for you flows
in every tear drop."

717
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:46,080
"I have become a river of sorrow."

718
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,880
"You have taken away
my soul from me, my beloved."

719
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,440
Praise be to God.

720
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:04,880
"What will I do..."

721
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,880
"...my beloved?"

722
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,040
God willing...

723
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,240
Every bead in this rosary
carries a story...

724
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,360
The stories that my mother had told me.

725
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,800
If Master approves,
this is my bride-wealth.

726
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,040
Otherwise you must return it to me..

727
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,000
Because I want to carry
these prayers to my grave.

728
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,840
My dear, what happened?
Where are you going?

729
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,360
If you leave us, who do we have?

730
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,640
Dear...

731
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:26,400
Let her leave if she wants to.
How long can you hold her back?

732
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,240
You are not that strong.

733
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,960
Leave me.

734
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,360
If you had a sibling...

735
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,120
Your father was against it...

736
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,560
Not because he thought
they will be mute...

737
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:44,200
If the next one was able to speak,
he thought you may feel left out.

738
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,560
Call her back...

739
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,320
Move aside.

740
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,040
Move.

741
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,800
- Let her go.
- Let me die.

742
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,480
Please don't do this.

743
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,920
Supper is served.
Rajeev is waiting.

744
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,240
You should have brought the kid along.

745
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,400
- I was telling you, Rajeev.
- Yes?

746
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,280
I was saying that you should have
brought the little one too.

747
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:25,040
This trip was planned in a hurry.
I had some papers to sign.

748
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,080
And we'll leave early morning.

749
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,000
Will she be fine at your friend's apartment?
Isn't she too small?

750
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:36,560
Syed too has a kid of her age.
She will be fine with her.

751
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,960
Look, will this cap be okay for her?

752
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,640
- This is slightly big for her.
- Just use a pin

753
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,880
It will be perfect then.

754
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,240
She participates in fancy dress
and dance competitions.

755
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:49,920
Really?

756
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,880
Did you hear that?
She also dances.

757
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,160
That means she has got
some of Suja's talent.

758
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,080
Does Suja dance?

759
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,360
What?

760
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:05,080
Suja dances.
She used to teach dance.

761
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I didn't know that.

762
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,680
In the last ten years,
I haven't seen any of it.

763
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,200
- Darling, what's up?
- Hello, dad.

764
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,080
Dad, when will you be back?

765
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,640
We will come soon. By the time you
wake up tomorrow we will be home, okay?

766
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,160
Here's your grandpa.

767
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:33,639
Grandpa...

768
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,960
Yes, darling.

769
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:40,760
So, now you dance? When you visit us next,
you should perform for grandpa and grandma.

770
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:41,880
Thumbi darling...

771
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,680
I'm sending you a cap. It's a bit loose.
Ask your mom to put a pin on this.

772
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:47,760
Okay.

773
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,560
Grandpa and grandma will soon
come there to meet you.

774
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,720
Ya, we'll come.

775
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,800
Who's that there?
Your friend?

776
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,960
Ya, we were playing on the phone...

777
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,760
The call is disconnected.

778
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,320
Oh, it's gone!

779
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,280
Don't you have to eat?

780
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,320
At least change your clothes.
What will they think?

781
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:16,200
Don't tell them
the real purpose of our visit.

782
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,680
Come on, attend it.
It must be the child...

783
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,600
Sorry man. Got disconnected.
What's up there?

784
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,720
Did you see the body?
How is Sujatha now?

785
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,720
Call me when you are free.
Bye!

786
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,960
The call had disconnected, and...

787
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,840
That was a personal message.

788
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,840
So they have come here
after knowing everything...

789
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,000
Your affair with him
is well known here.

790
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,640
While informing about the death,
they said "Sujatha's old flame."

791
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,520
For them, it's old.
But here it's still...

792
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,560
You must understand
how I feel when I hear all that.

793
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,960
Why did you marry me?

794
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,880
You should've married him
and lived happily.

795
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,060
From where did you get this rosary?

796
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,640
From where is it?

797
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,160
Is it his gift?

798
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,200
Looks good. Very good.

799
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,560
You remove the wedding chain
I put and wear this instead.

800
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,920
It will be better.

801
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,320
Where is the passport?

802
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,360
I am asking you,
where is the passport?

803
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,200
Did you keep it upstairs?

804
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,920
Are you deaf, dammit?
Where is the passport?

805
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,560
We came to keep these in your luggage.

806
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,000
What was the noise, son?

807
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,160
Isn't it natural for couples
to have some minor quarrels?

808
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,920
When the concern for the husband
is missing, they tend to be louder.

809
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,560
Eh. Why...

810
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,560
Dad, I've never told you any of this.

811
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,720
I have never been happy in my married life.

812
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,160
I brought her to see his corpse,
hoping I can now have some happiness.

813
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:37,479
Dear, what are you saying...

814
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,920
Hoping to get it out of her mind...

815
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:46,280
What's it, dammit? Did I stop you?
Did I stop you from seeing him?

816
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,240
It's your fate that you couldn't see.
I would've got some peace if you could.

817
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,360
Dear...

818
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,160
Dad, I've had relationships too.
This is not love, but some madness.

819
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:58,400
Don't use such words.
I'll talk to her.

820
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
What will you tell her?
There is no point.

821
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,760
I'll have to live with this.
It's my fate.

822
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,720
Rajeev, dear...

823
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,440
Mom, did you see my wallet and passport?

824
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,800
Wallet?

825
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,360
No, I haven't.

826
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,040
Passport...

827
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,640
Did you check all your bags?

828
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,840
I checked all my bags.
I just can't remember where I kept it.

829
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,240
Did you forget it in the taxi?

830
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:29,079
I am not sure.

831
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:31,200
Shall we call him and check?

832
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,200
Hello, is it Anu Travels?
I had booked a trip this morning.

833
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,760
To Mulla Bazaar.
A grey Innova.

834
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,440
- Mr. Ashokan. His wife is pregnant.
- It'll be in that car.

835
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,600
I have lost my wallet
and passport in that car.

836
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:49,920
His...

837
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,440
Ya...

838
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,280
OK.

839
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,800
Can you quickly check and tell me?

840
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,560
Rajeev.

841
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,640
OK. Thank you.

842
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,000
Don't be tense, son.

843
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,800
It will be there in the car.
Where else can it be?

844
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,080
I didn't notice it when they came.
Do you remember?

845
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,360
No, I didn't notice.

846
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,840
Dear...

847
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:20,120
Don't worry. You leave as planned.
We will send it safely with someone.

848
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:25,800
Don't talk nonsense.
They can't travel without it.

849
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,360
Only the passport is missing, right?
He has the visa with him.

850
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,560
Stop your nonsense!

851
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,040
Hello.

852
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:04,280
Sir, I am driver Ashokan.
I dropped you this morning.

853
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,280
Yes, Ashokan.
Did you find it?

854
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,960
I searched the car thoroughly.
I couldn't find it.

855
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,640
Did you search the boot?
It's a brown colour wallet.

856
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,140
I was searching all this while, sir.

857
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,280
- Did you search well?
- Yes, I did.

858
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:21,240
- Sir, one more thing.
- Tell me.

859
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,080
- My wife delivered. It's a boy.
- Oh, congrats.

860
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,560
What happened, son?

861
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,480
Got it?

862
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,800
It's not in the car.

863
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,400
Think calmly where you had kept it.

864
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,200
Dear, are you sure the wallet
and passports are not with you?

865
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,360
Just give a signal
if you don't have them.

866
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,960
Ashokan, what's up?
Did you find it?

867
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,280
Sir, I remembered later...

868
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:08,640
...the purse was in your pocket
when you went to the mosque.

869
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,880
- Was it?
- Yes, I'm sure I saw it.

870
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:14,960
OK. Thank you.

871
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:04,080
"Two people will walk up.
Who are they?"

872
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:08,400
"They are Munkar and Nakir."

873
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,040
"So, as Munkar and Nakir approaches..."

874
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:15,280
What are you saying?
Open the grave?

875
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,440
What else should I say, Dad?

876
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,120
My flight is at 7.
I have a client meeting at 11.

877
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,000
The locker key is in that wallet.

878
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,880
I need to find it somehow.
Else it will all be over.

879
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,200
Son, are you very sure
you lost it in the grave?

880
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,680
There's no chance of losing it elsewhere.

881
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,560
How can we pick it up from there
in the middle of the night?

882
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,160
I don't know.
We must find it somehow.

883
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,720
Shall we call Kumaran?

884
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Who is that?

885
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,160
Kumaran is the one who digs graves.

886
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,480
I don't know if he will do this.

887
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,480
Dad, offer him whatever he wants.

888
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,080
What can we give him?

889
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,800
What if we return his land documents?

890
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,560
Dad, call him.
We have no other way.

891
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,160
Please call.

892
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:31,400
OK OK. I will be there real quick.

893
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,640
- Kumaran!
- What happened, boss?

894
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,560
Rajeev has lost his passport and wallet.

895
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,760
- You need to help us find it.
- What?

896
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,560
My passport and wallet
fell into that grave.

897
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:17,840
That's impossible, boss.
You're asking me to play with fire.

898
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,720
Times have changed.
Better understand that.

899
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,760
Kumaran!

900
01:42:20,879 --> 01:42:21,879
Give this to him, son.

901
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,320
Dropped the passport in the grave it seems.
Let it rot there.

902
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,560
Kumaran, stop.

903
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:27,500
- What's it?
- These are the papers of your land.

904
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,560
Keep it.

905
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,880
I'll do you whatever you say.
Just take me there.

906
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,400
I can't do anything
without it, Kumaran.

907
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,880
I will show you the spot.
Don't ask me to do anything else.

908
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:28,000
"Praise be to God!"

909
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,120
"The All-Compassionate..."

910
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,280
"The Ever-Merciful..."

911
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,040
"The Absolute Ruler..."

912
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,280
"Praise be to God!"

913
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,480
"The Pure One..."

914
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:01,960
"Praise be to God!"

915
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:23,000
"Praise be to God!"

916
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:31,160
"Praise be to God!"

917
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:47,760
"Praise be to God!"

918
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,480
Come, I am your redemption and salvation.

919
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:58,280
"Praise be to God!"

920
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,600
"Oh. You become my rosary..."

921
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:12,880
"The light of Allah!"

922
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:19,560
"The light of Allah!"

923
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:36,560
"As grief reaches
up to the doorstep..."

924
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:47,160
"I've become a rosary
with its cord untied"

925
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:57,000
"In the fire of darkness
when desires possess words"

926
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:08,640
"How will I, oh divine light,
express my gratitude..."

927
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,760
"Allah gives grief"

928
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,480
"Allah takes away grief"

929
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,880
"Allah is this earth"

930
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,560
"Allah is my paradise"

931
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,080
"Allah gives fire"

932
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,960
"Allah becomes snow"

933
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,320
"Allah is my joy"

934
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,720
"Allah is my sky"

935
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:51,120
"I stand like a henna twig..."

936
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:56,280
"Near the headstone engraved with the truth."

937
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:57,800
Dear...

938
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,300
Let go of those who have departed.

939
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,880
Don't think about those things anymore..

940
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,640
I have never heard Rajeev
talk like this before...

941
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,680
You too have a daughter

942
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:16,600
"The light of Allah!"

943
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:23,280
"The light of Allah!"

944
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,160
"Allah gives grief"

945
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,720
"Allah takes away grief"

946
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,320
"Allah is this earth"

947
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,840
"Allah is my paradise"

948
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,120
"Allah gives fire"

949
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,000
"Allah becomes snow"

950
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,440
"Allah is my joy"

951
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,000
"Allah is my sky"

952
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:57,640
"How will I, oh divine light,"

953
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:05,360
"Express my gratitude..."

954
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,480
- Which way is it?
- There it is.

955
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:40,480
I'll call you.
Boss is not keeping well. Bye.

956
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,160
Boss...

957
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,560
A man is sleeping inside the mosque.

958
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:49,640
What if he hears the noise and wakes up?
My hands and legs are shaking.

959
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,440
If anyone comes we will tell the truth,
even if we have to fall at his feet.

960
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,160
It's there.

961
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,880
Boss, you're sure it's inside this?

962
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,200
Sure, Kumaran.
Why else would we...

963
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,640
If someone comes here and sees this,
they will bury the three of us right here.

964
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,760
We don't have any other way, Kumaran.

965
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,200
Move aside, boss.

966
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,040
Scratching like this won't help.

967
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,120
Where is your passport and keys?

968
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:14,640
Boss, I removed all this soil.
I told you it won't be here.

969
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,200
Kumaran, I'm sure it had fallen here.

970
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,760
How can it fall inside this?

971
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,080
- It may have fallen through that gap.
- It can't. That is the body!

972
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,560
- Kumaran, quietly...
- What?

973
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,840
Move aside, Kumaran.
Let me check.

974
01:52:29,559 --> 01:52:30,559
Son!

975
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,080
What are you doing?
Don't lift it.

976
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:33,280
Rajeev, no...

977
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,560
- Boss, don't lift it.
- Son, listen to him...

978
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,960
Don't lift it!

979
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:39,560
Boss!

980
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,800
Dear, why did you come here at this hour?

981
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,360
Hey, stop it.

982
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,960
Move.

983
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:09,000
Boss...

984
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:14,360
Kumaran...

985
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,480
Son...

986
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,800
Kumaran, no!
Rajeev, please listen...

987
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,640
Hey, please don't...

988
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,040
Leave me.

989
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:38,920
Kumaran...

990
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,320
Get off me.

991
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,400
Leave me!

992
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,160
From where did you find it now?

993
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,200
Why did you hide it?

994
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,800
What are you saying?
Open the grave?

995
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,360
My flight is at 7.
I have a client meeting at 11.

996
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,120
The locker key is in that wallet.

997
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:44,280
I need to find it somehow.
Else it will all be over.

998
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:48,400
Son, are you very sure
you lost it in the grave?

999
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,040
If Master approves
this is my bride-wealth.

1000
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,640
Otherwise you must return it to me..

1001
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,880
Because I want to carry
these prayers to my grave.

1002
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:09,040
So, is this why all of you got together
and made me open this grave at midnight?

1003
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:52,880
Do you want to see?

1004
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:09,600
"Oh God, kindly grant him
the time that he is asking for."

1005
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:15,040
"Oh God, kindly give him
the answers he is seeking for."

1006
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,320
Who are you looking for?

1007
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,680
I had left a similar rosary
with someone here.

1008
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:24,080
Long back...

1009
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:45,720
"You have taken my soul away from me."

1010
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:58,320
"What will I do..."

1011
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:06,000
"My beloved..."

1012
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:43,960
The seat belt...
