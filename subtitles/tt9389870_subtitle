1
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:50,417
Did you see the news?

2
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:51,917
Yes, I did.

3
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,250
Sujoy called me yesterday.

4
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,014
A big group of poachers
might have arrived.

5
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,417
Who is Sujoy?

6
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,893
Sujoy Bose, he's the
forest officer of Borpahadi.

7
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:01,917
The breakfast is ready.

8
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:02,708
Come, let's go.

9
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,750
Wait a minute Subho.

10
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,458
But I've enough.

11
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,667
I know that anyway.

12
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,083
Take it.

13
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,458
She's my mother too.

14
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,875
I wish I could go to Vellore.

15
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,292
Let's go.

16
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,282
Please, take your seat brother.

17
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,083
Where is Jojo?

18
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,958
Jojo!

19
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,167
Good morning, uncle!

20
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,917
A very good morning to you.

21
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,083
Come, have your seat.

22
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,125
What will you have?

23
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,667
Bread-butter or cornflakes?

24
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,417
Bread-butter.

25
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,912
Wait, I'll bring it for you.

26
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,583
Are you upset?

27
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,042
No!

28
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,375
Don't be upset!

29
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,785
Your parents are going to
take grandma for a surgery...

30
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,727
till then we two,
will be having fun.

31
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,708
Play with your cousins.

32
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,292
Absolutely!

33
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,417
And, I'll take you to a tour
of the jungle of Barpahari.

34
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,458
You people take care,

35
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,208
and do let me know
mother's condition.

36
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:56,917
Okay?

37
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:57,500
Yes, sure.

38
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,101
You don't worry brother,
you better keep an eye on Jojo.

39
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:00,667
Pass me the butter.

40
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,292
He'll be all fine.

41
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,417
Right Jojo?

42
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:05,625
What's the matter with you?

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Take some more.

44
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,417
- Uncle!
- Yes?

45
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,698
Are there tigers in the jungle?

46
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,208
Of course!

47
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,917
There are giant Tigers.

48
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,375
There are rhinoceros.

49
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,250
Then, there are birds and deers as well.

50
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,750
Let's a have a jungle safari.
The uncle and nephew duo.

51
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,458
To the Barpahari National Park.

52
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,125
Listen...

53
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,750
Do obey your aunt.

54
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,833
And, don't you dare
to drink ice water.

55
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,917
Also you'll see how much
studious your cousins are!

56
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,735
Grandma will get well soon, right?

57
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,458
Surely, she will.

58
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,625
Will the cousin brothers
play with me?

59
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,250
Why not!

60
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,911
Why won't they play with you!

61
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:56,500
Listen...

62
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,500
does tea grow in uncle's garden?

63
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,625
Yes.

64
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:00,625
Listen...

65
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,893
here are your books.
Do read them in your leisure.

66
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,157
Don't play around all the time.

67
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,875
And don't go outside
without informing anyone.

68
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,167
Do uncle have tea stall too?

69
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,333
Oh God!

70
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,541
You ask too many questions!

71
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,042
Come here.

72
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,572
Come here.
Let me comb your hair.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,375
Be a good boy there.

74
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:21,208
Okay?

75
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:21,667
Yes.

76
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,625
What else you want
to take with you?

77
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,583
Here it is.

78
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,292
Look at this.

79
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:28,792
Do you want to take...

80
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,783
You again messed up your hair?

81
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,333
I'll not comb it anymore!

82
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,042
Keep this too.

83
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,625
You'll carry this also?

84
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,625
Yes, they are my friend.
Tobu and Natobor.

85
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,833
Silly boy!

86
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,250
Let's go.

87
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,250
Listen...

88
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,042
Do drink enough water.

89
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,735
And do listen,
what your aunt says.

90
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:47,958
Let's go.

91
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,434
Have you checked everything?

92
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,458
- Yes.
- Okay, come.

93
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,819
They will be cutting your stomach!

94
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,667
So, don't even move a bit.

95
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,458
When I go for a haircut...

96
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,042
I never move a bit.

97
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,750
Do you know where am I going?

98
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,458
To the jungles of Barpahari.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,375
"Treading in less taken paths..."

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
"...in the spine chilling afternoons..."

101
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,333
"... I wonder in the nature..."

102
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,583
"...life is now like a jungle book."

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,375
"Treading in less taken paths..."

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
"...in the spine chilling afternoons..."

105
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,333
"... I wonder in the nature..."

106
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,583
"...life is now like a jungle book."

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,875
"Mowgli and Bagheera is here..."

108
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,750
"...the jungle is their home."

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,708
"Even if, Sher Khan appears,
adventure is calling me."

110
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:39,458
"The fun lies in danger..."

111
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:48,292
"Life is now rejuvinated,
with the songs of vacation."

112
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:53,375
'Mowgli', 'Sher Khan',
'Bagheera', 'Tarzan'...

113
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,625
Well, they are not in this forest.

114
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,000
They are in your story books.

115
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,417
"Life is now rejuvinated,
with the songs of vacation."

116
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,125
"The dust in the wind,
travelling to faraway."

117
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,375
Are your house in the jungle?

118
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,875
It's beside the jungle.

119
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,615
The tea that I send your father,
of the Rossel company...

120
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,792
our house lies inside the
tea-estate of that company.

121
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,393
Just beside the national park, actually.

122
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,583
Okay, I see.

123
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,542
Uncle...

124
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,193
can you show me the tea garden?

125
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:28,917
Sure I can.

126
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,094
You can see it right now.
It's near actually.

127
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:40,000
"Maybe wild elephants,
will come to stop us."

128
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:48,000
"The wolves may scare us,
with their shiny jaws."

129
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:55,583
"Jojo is going there,
to do his heroic deeds."

130
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,542
Elephant!

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,167
"Life is now rejuvinated,
with the songs of vacation."

132
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:10,333
"The dust in the wind,
travelling to faraway."

133
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,042
This is a pet elephant.

134
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,833
Pet elephant!

135
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,292
What's a pet elephant?

136
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,583
Actually, forest dept. breads
these elephant as their pet.

137
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,457
They help the forest
dept. in various works.

138
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,625
Okay.

139
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,667
You know what uncle,

140
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,666
My friend from Kolkata,
Tobu has a small elephant.

141
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,667
Really?

142
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,625
They've come with me too.

143
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,625
What!

144
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:34,292
Yes.

145
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,792
I have kept them in my bag.

146
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,083
It's your painting then!

147
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,167
Yes.

148
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:47,542
"Colourful butterflies, with
crickets but it's the tiger all fear."

149
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:55,625
"Colourful butterflies, with
crickets but it's the tiger all fear."

150
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,625
Do the cousin brothers
ride elephants?

151
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:00,667
No, not at all.

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,018
They hardly get time
for these things.

153
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,458
Their final exam is ahead.

154
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,157
Both of them will rank in that.

155
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583
Oh! I see.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you hungry?

157
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,042
No.

158
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,375
I've heard leopards,
sometime enter the tea-gradens!

159
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,375
Well, sometimes they do.

160
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:27,375
"The dust in the wind,
travelling to faraway."

161
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:34,708
"Life is now rejuvinated,
with the songs of vacation."

162
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,375
Take out the luggages!

163
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,292
Such a beautiful place.

164
00:12:59,375 --> 00:12:59,875
Did you like it?

165
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,125
Of course.

166
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,333
This is our bungalow,
your adress for next few days.

167
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,583
Hey! Look who has come!

168
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
Jojo!

169
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:22,917
So you study in 6th standard?

170
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,167
Yes.

171
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,167
Then answer this...

172
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,009
What is the name of
Harshabardhan's sister?

173
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:31,500
You couldn't answer this.

174
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:32,958
It's Rajyashree.

175
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,125
Now say...

176
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,847
What is the solution
of (a+b) whole square?

177
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
+b...

178
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:44,542
whole square!

179
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,242
You failed to answer this too!

180
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,583
Okay, then say...

181
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,542
There is 18lt. milk in a bowl...

182
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,667
from there taking 2 It. milk,
2 It water has been added.

183
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,711
Then from that position taking 2 It,
again 2 It of water has been added.

184
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,750
So now what is the ratio of
milk and water in that position?

185
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,333
Say it once more please.

186
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,664
What is the ratio of
milk and water in that position?

187
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,708
Is this a math
from 6th standard?

188
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,792
Yes, ratio calculation.
Didn't you study?

189
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:23,667
What calculation?

190
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,833
Ratio calculation.

191
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,250
How much did you score in maths?

192
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,042
In maths?

193
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,208
19.

194
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,292
Only 19!

195
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,333
We never score below 100.

196
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,667
100!

197
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,559
I'll give you
20 math problems everydays.

198
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
It'll be your homework.

199
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,417
Is there a big tiger
in this jungle?

200
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,000
Big tiger!

201
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,500
Do what you're being told!

202
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:47,892
Again started your
lectures with him too?

203
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:48,958
You better come with me.

204
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,458
They will chew your head off.

205
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,707
You came to your
uncle's house to have fun.

206
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,958
Why study!

207
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,375
What are you doing?

208
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,958
I was airing myself a bit.

209
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,167
Okay, then eat now.

210
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,500
What's in lunch today?

211
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,958
A mix-vegetable and...

212
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,125
fish curry.

213
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,707
Your mother said,
this is your favourite.

214
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,708
Yes.

215
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,144
So, when will you
sit with your studies?

216
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,208
At house, I do study.

217
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,957
Do I have to study
in vacation as well?

218
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,375
Of course, you have to.

219
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,583
You must study whole day,
even always.

220
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,893
Otherwise, how will you grow big?

221
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,250
Your brothers starts studying
at very early morning.

222
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,292
Don't you study then?

223
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,542
Early morning!

224
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,667
- Who teaches you at home?
- My mother.

225
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,791
Give it to me.
I'll eat by myself.

226
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,792
No!

227
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,768
Your mother instructed me
to feed you properly.

228
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:48,952
You won't be able to do that.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,042
Do you go for tutions?

230
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,375
Tution?

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,750
Your brothers go for 8 tutions.

232
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:54,750
What? 8!

233
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:55,958
Then, when do they play?

234
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,000
Class 10, is not a time
to play around!

235
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,292
Good Lord!

236
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,559
Then, I don't want to study class 10!

237
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,792
Don't say like that!

238
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,708
Can you recite poems?

239
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,875
Of course I can.

240
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,642
- 'Twinkle, twinkle little star..."
- No!

241
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,907
That's a poem for nursery kids.

242
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,208
Your brothers can recite
the poems of Shakespeare.

243
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,185
I'll listen to your
poem in the evening.

244
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:13,917
Do remind yourself one.

245
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,958
Poem!

246
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,542
Here's uncle!

247
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,917
Where are you going uncle?

248
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,530
I'm going for
a meeting my child.

249
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,750
Listen, I'll leave now.

250
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,667
Right now?

251
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,125
Yes, they're saying Chengis
has killed that poacher.

252
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,537
His pug mark has been found.

253
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:27,958
What is pug mark?

254
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,208
Pug mark is nothing but,
animal's footprints.

255
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,042
Footprints!

256
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,375
You mean, like this?

257
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:33,917
Like this right?

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Correct!

259
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,000
How intelligent!

260
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:36,875
So, listen...

261
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,416
Forest dept. and tea-estate
has decided to...

262
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,749
do an anti-poaching
awareness campaign together.

263
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,059
- This meeting is on that issue.
- Has siting done on Chengis?

264
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,083
We can't tell that yet!

265
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,458
Jojo, listen...

266
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:50,333
there is written near the
jungle 'Restricted Area'...

267
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,833
don't ever cross that, okay?

268
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,375
What is 'Restricted Area'?

269
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,417
'Restricted Area' is the area
where you can not tresspass.

270
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,583
Will you remembe that?

271
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,083
Yes.

272
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,333
Okay.

273
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,375
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

274
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,167
You eat on your own then,
I'm coming in a minute.

275
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,583
- Where did you go?
- I was...

276
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,851
- How did you leave without informing anyone?
- You were instructed not to come here!

277
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,708
Did you do the math
problems I gave you?

278
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,583
Spell 'Discipline'!

279
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,083
Oh! Discipline!

280
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,917
- Umm, it's d, s, c...
- Is this the spelling!

281
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,326
Wait, I'll teach you a lesson!

282
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,124
- Jojo, where are you going?
- Come back. It's not safe!

283
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,125
Don't go there!

284
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,920
- I'll tell mother!
- That's the restricted area!

285
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,542
Oh God! You're behaving
like you don't know us.

286
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,083
- Tobu!
- Yes and here's Natobar.

287
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,708
How did you two come here?

288
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,417
You brought us in your backpack.
How could you forget that!

289
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,417
Come, adore Natobar a bit.

290
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,125
Come, hop in.

291
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,375
Come here.

292
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,542
So, how is the place?

293
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,333
Very beautiful, indeed!

294
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,417
There is only one problem.

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,958
- What problem?
- My cousin brothers!

296
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,958
They never play!

297
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,458
They just study all time,
and score huge marks.

298
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,083
100 out of 100.
And they always asks my questions.

299
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,208
What is the name of
Harshabardhan's sister!

300
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,042
What is (a+b) whole square!

301
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,707
In that case,
my country is better.

302
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,708
Why so?

303
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,667
Because we don't have
school or colleges there.

304
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,809
There is no need of going to schools,
with heavy backpacks.

305
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,625
- Also, we don't have any office there.
- Wow! That's really great.

306
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay, let's drop you home now.

307
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,917
I'll see you again, my friend.

308
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:35,292
Where did you go?
Everyone was worriedly looking for you.

309
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,750
I was just roaming nearby, Shishir uncle.

310
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,625
Jojo I told you to stop.
Then, why did you enter the jungle?

311
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,958
- No, I mean...
- What do you mean?

312
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,917
Weren't you afraid
to go inside the jungle?

313
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,500
No, I was just running!

314
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,917
Suddenly, I saw
the jungle came near to me.

315
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,375
After that, I saw I am in
the middle of the jungle!

316
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,750
So, you were running in the road,
and the jungle came near to you!

317
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,976
After that, you found yourself
in the middle of the jungle!

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,041
And, now the jungle
reached you home!

319
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,292
What a liar you are!

320
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,708
No, it was not the jungle
that reached me home.

321
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,833
Tobu and Natobar,
they dropped me home.

322
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,833
Tobu and Natobar!
Who are they?

323
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:23,750
Tobu and Natobar are my friends.
Come, I'll introduce you to them.

324
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,708
Tobu!
Natobar!

325
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,250
They're not here.

326
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,583
So, now you are lieing to us?

327
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,250
And, then you'll
start smoking also!

328
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,708
No, I don't smoke!

329
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:42,292
Come, let me teach you a lesson!

330
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,917
No one lives here by
the name of Tobu and Natobar!

331
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,333
- Do want more of 'Luchis'?
- Yes, please.

332
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,125
- Father, tell him about the eminent danger!
- Hmm!

333
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,042
You'll not go to the jungle again!
There can be lots of danger.

334
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,207
And he was making names
like Tobu and Natobar!

335
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,041
No, they are real.
They're my friend.

336
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,250
Friend my foot!

337
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,291
When you'll get poor marks
no friend will be with you.

338
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,083
God knows, what you will do in life!

339
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,772
There are so many books.
Do read them.

340
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,958
Play insode the compound.
No need to go near the jungle!

341
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,167
Mother, I better give
him some homework.

342
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,054
- That'll be better.
- No, no, not homework.

343
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,625
- I'll not go to jungle anymore.
- Promise?

344
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,083
Yes.

345
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,042
Why is wild life important?

346
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,333
The world is not only ours!

347
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,851
If the animals and birds go extinct,
the trees will be too...

348
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,675
and without trees,
there will be no Oxygen.

349
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,708
And without Oxygen,
we'll be extinct too.

350
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,917
Do you know who that is?
Chengis!

351
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:05,958
Chengis!

352
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,351
He is the famous
tiger of Barpahari.

353
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,542
He has a huge face like a demon.

354
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:14,042
He looks very fierce!
Go there again, he'll eat you up.

355
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,125
The poachers are
waiting to kill him.

356
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:53,000
Humans are the most greedy
and dishonest creature.

357
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,125
We're cutting tress
to build houses.

358
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,625
Decorating our house with
dead animals and birds!

359
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,167
Come.

360
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,292
Uncle, will I not go
to the suffari?

361
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,500
You'll. We have a trainer
of Forest dept. Biju.

362
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,167
- I'll tell him. He'll take you.
- Yes, now eat your food Jojo.

363

how much time will Nellor take to reach?

366
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:50,333
Vellor to Nellor!

367
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:55,167
If Humayun is Babar's son,
then What is the name of Shibaji's father?

00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,375

Tata!

423
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,458
Tata, uncle.

424
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:07,667
"Leaving all behind,
I not know where I'm going."

425
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:17,333
"These never ending paths,
who knows where they lead."

426
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:37,625
"Leaving all behind,
I not know where I'm going."

427
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:45,000
"These never ending paths,
who knows where they lead."

428
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:56,042
"The nature is inviting me,
waving her hand."

429
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:03,958
"I so wish to explore."

430
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:12,042
"With the sun setting,
daylight bids adieu."

431
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:20,125
"Time waits for none."

432
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:26,750
"But there's a lot
left to explore still."

433
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,625
"Far away, far away"

434
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:39,833
"Leaving all behind,
I not know where I'm going."

435
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:47,292
"These never ending paths,
who knows where they lead."

436
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,292
- Shishir uncle, open the gate!
- Yes, my child.

437
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,667
- Move, move.
- Was the safari all fine?

438
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,750
Yes, Shishir Ji.
It was too good.

439
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Come on, sit Nani.

440
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,625
Jojo, Shibu and Nani.

441
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,750
We're friends from now on.

442
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,458
Thank you Nani.

443
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,333
- Will see you tomorrow then?
- Yes.

444
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,333
- I'm going then.
- See you tomorrow.

445
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,332
Jojo, your mother
is on the phone.

446
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,125
- Come quick.
- Let's move!

447
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,208
- Move behind.
- Mother!

448
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:18,917
Go.

449
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's go, Nani.

450
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:20,875
Good, good.

451
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,524
Listen, do call in the landline.
The network is not good here.

452
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:24,750
Give the phone to Swagata.

453
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:25,912
- Jojo, is here.
- Yeah, sure.

454
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,625
- Hello!
- Hello, mother!

455
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,167
Yes, say.

456
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,625
- How's Grandma now?
- She's alright.

457
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,625
You are fine right?

458
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:35,208
Yes, I made two new
friends today.

459
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,332
Shibu and his elephant Nani.

460
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,500
Really! That's great.

461
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,457
I went to the Safari,
riding on Nani's back.

462
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,042
I bathed him too.

463
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,132
Then what will happen
to your Tobu and Natobar?

464
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,375
Tobu and Natobar?

465
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,250
- Their name is now shibu and Nani.
- Listen...

466
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:49,582
Don't be naughty, be a good kid.

467
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,166
And always listen
to your aunt. Okay?

468
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:51,417
Okay.

469
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,124
Give the phone to your uncle,
your father will talk.

470
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:53,542
Yeah.

471
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,893
- Uncle take the call.
- Why? You should have talked more!

472
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:56,250
Yeah, say?

473
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,975
- Jojo is not troubling you much right?
- No, no, he's a good kid.

474
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,958
- Listen, keep informing me time to time.
- Yes, surely I will.

475
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:04,018
- I'll disconnect the call then.
- Yes, yes, alright.

476
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,458
Come, you have to eat now.

477
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,864
- It's too late.
- Hey, listen...

478
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,059
Sujoy and Leena is coming.
Did they tell you when?

479
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,167
Around 7-7:30.

480
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,292
- So you've did the cooking?
- Yes, all are ready. Don't worry.

481
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,708
- You go eat something.
- Yes.

482
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,083
Greetings, sir!

483
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:26,625
Greetings.

484
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,226
Put the luggagues in my room.

485
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,250
Sure, sir.

486
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,667
Chengis!

487
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,333
- You were not here then!
- No, I went to Kolkata.

488
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,791
Why did you let her serve?

489
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,500
She's our guest.

490
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,750
No, brother it's fine.
I enjoy serving.

491
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,170
I told her not to.
But, she did not listen to me!

492
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,374
You sit here now.

493
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:53,417
No, you all have first.
I'll eat with sister later.

494
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:54,667
If you ask me...

495
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,976
let's all eat together.
Sister, you please sit also.

496
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,917
Yes, sure I'll.

497
00:34:57,918 --> 00:34:59,041
- Sister, you sit too.
- Sit down.

498
00:34:59,042 --> 00:34:59,708
- Please.
- You sit first.

499
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:00,833
Thank you.

500
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,750
So, brother how's your mother?

501
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,083
Mother is better now.

502
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,583
Her oparation is done.
She's now at observation.

503
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,792
And, that is my nephew.

504
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,207
- Jojo.
- I see.

505
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,167
- Hi, Jojo.
- Hi.

506
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,167
Hello.

507
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:14,833
Are you a forest officer?

508
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,333
Hmm!

509
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,625
Did you go to the jungle safari?

510
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,750
Yes I did, riding on elephant's back.

511
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,083
- So, how was it?
- It was too good.

512
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,583
And Leena, whenever you feel alone,
Do come here.

513
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,333
First, you'll like it here
after coming from Kolkata.

514
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:31,624
Yes, our quarter is
also very beautiful.

515
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:32,905
And the place is really amazing.

516
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,667
Well, now it's time to
welcome the third family member also.

517
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,583
Your time will pass then.

518
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,874
- You know what brother...
- Yes?

519
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,101
What I understood is that...

520
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,375
Chengis is their target.

521
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,833
I'm going to
Dibrugar for some days.

522
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,684
I already informed all in the village.
So, I informed you as well.

523
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,832
We should be alert.

524
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,083
According to my perception...

525
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,917
The group of the poachers are really big.
I'm failing to catch them everytime.

526
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,083
I need your support!

527
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,292
Of course, sure.

528
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,125
How long will you
all have the soup?

529
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,417
Take the other items too.

530
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,664
Jojo, let me give you some.

531
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,292
What will the poachers
get from killing Chengis?

532
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,457
These people after
killing the tiger...

533
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,833
keeps its head as a
hunting trophy in their house.

534
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,707
- Is that so?
- The skin of the tiger...

535
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,833
is used to decorate the house.

536
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,333
With the nails, teeth and bones...

537
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,333
they make some kind of medicine.

538
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:05,250
And, the meat is used
to make soup for them.

539
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,292
Why?

540
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:08,082
They actually believe...

541
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,832
that if they consume the meat...

542
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,000
then they'll become stronger.

543
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,291
It's all superstition, sheer lies.

544
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,833
Who buys all these?

545
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,666
Well, people from outside
with lots of money.

546
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:19,667
- Now, let's go.
- Nani!

547
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,333
You here?

548
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,583
- Where are you two going?
- To the jungle, to feed Nani.

549
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,708
I'll go too.
Sit down, Nani.

550
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,082
Hey! Where are you going?

551
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,125
Don't go.
Madam will be angry.

552
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,792
Shishir ji you go back.
I'll come back soon.

553
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,250
- I'll tell everything to madam.
- Let's go now.

554
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,917
Looks like, I'll loose my job
because of these two.

555
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,291
Do come back soon.

556
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,000
Or else, I'll loose my job.

557
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,625
You don't worry Shishir uncle.
I'm here with him.

558
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,624
What are you doing?

559
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:20,833
- This is one of our tribal songs.
- Oh! I see.

560
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,667
You sing then,
I'll enjoy the view for sometime.

561
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,583
Stop Nani, stop.

562
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:35,707
Look here!
See there's a baby deer.

563
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:36,708
See it.

564
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,167
Did you see it?
Look there.

565
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,125
You're right.
It's a little deer.

566
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,333
He ran away.

567
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,625
He's with his mother.

568
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,566
- Let's move forward.
- There are so many other things to see.

569
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,624
Will you show me a tiger?

570
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,833
- A tiger!
- Yes.

571
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,563
Well you might
see it after some time.

572
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,042
But from long distance.

573
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:12,542
- Chengis!
- Chengis?

574
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,250
That I can't tell.

575
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,750
Look, there are so many deers.

576
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,750
How many deers
are there in Barpahari?

577
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,500
- Well, a lot.
- Still, any guesses?

578
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,874
- It's uncountable.
- Oh! I see.

579
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,249
Let's go ahead, you'll get to
see many other things.

580
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,667
- Okay then, let's go Nani.
- Yes, let's go.

581
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,083
- Hey, look there.
- What is it?

582
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:49,458
Rhino with its baby.

583
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:50,833
Do you know its name?

584
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:51,417
What is it?

585
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:53,875
- It's Lewis. Forest dept. gave it.
- Really?

586
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,875
- Yes, he is 8 month old.
- Do you know what he eats?

587
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,875
- He drinks his mother's milk.
- Oh! I see.

588
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,833
Let's go, Nani.

589
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,666
So, many Rhinos live here right?

590
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,458
- Yes, they do.
- They all live together then.

591
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,249
They live together.

592
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,417
Can't you see,
how they're roaming together?

593
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,875
Stop at once, Nani.

594
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,958
- Jojo, be quiet and don't dare to move.
- It's Chengis!

595
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:34,416
No it's not him. Chengis is more huge.
Don't worry, he'll not come near Nani.

596
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,833
But still, be quiet.

597
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:38,208
Don't talk.
Come on Nani, let's move.

598
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,750
Move Nani.

599
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,958
There are so many butterflies here.

600
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:06,582
- Do you know, what we call butterflies here?
- What?

601
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,500
- Efilo.
- Efilo?

602
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,082
- What is on that side?
- That side?

603
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,833
- The other part of the forest.
- Let's go there, what say?

604
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,250
Okay, let's go then.

605
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,542
Vultures! Why are so
many vultures in the sky?

606
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:34,083
- Where?
- There! Surely something died then.

607
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:37,125
Nani, go to that side fast.

608
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:38,875
Come on.

609
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,125
Stop here.

610
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,250
- Chengis!
- They cut off his skin.

611
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,791
Look, here are footprints.

612
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:59,417
One of them,
doesn't have his left ankle!

613
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:01,958
They killed him!

614
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,958
It's the poachers then.

615
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,542
Come on. Let's go.
We've have to inform the rengor.

616
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,958
Give me your ears.

617
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:22,417
Let's go Nani.

618
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,125
Let's go Nani.
Move fast, hurry up.

619
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,500
Sit down, Nani.

620
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,125
Sujoy uncle!

621
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:45,958
- Sujoy uncle!
- You here!

622
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:49,042
What's the matter?

623
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,707
- He's at the office.
- The poachers are in the jungle!

624
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,708
What!

625
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:54,583
Poacher! How did you know?

626
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,250
- They've killed Chengis. Call Sujoy uncle now.
- Sure I'll...

627
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:00,083
There he is.

628
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,083
Look, what they're saying.

629
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,249
What happened? You here?

630
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,250
No, I mean...

631
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,083
Tell him.

632
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,624
The poachers have killed Chengis.

633
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,625
Vultures are roaming
around in the jungle.

634
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,851
One of them,
doesn't have his left ankle.

635
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,707
- What! Poachers?
- Yes, there are footprints too.

636
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,958
- Where?
- Inside the core area.

637
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,976
Why did you enter the core area?
What if, something happened to you!

638
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,893
- Should I tell Biju?
- Swapan! He belongs from the village.

639
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,237
He can go anywhere of the jungle.

640
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:23,624
- Shibu do you know that place?
- Yes, uncle.

641
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,333
- Can you take us there?
- Yes.

642
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,333
Let's go then.

643
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,083
- Pradip come fast.
- Okay, sir.

644
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,624
- Unlce, that way!
- Drive faster.

645
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,542
Come on, fast.

646
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:32,958
- Shibu which way?
- That way, that side.

647
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:33,542
Which way?

648
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,042
- This way right?
- Yes.

649
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,333
Yes, on the right.
Above there.

650
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:38,667
Let's go. Hurry up.

651
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:43,124
- Here, stop here.
- Stop the car.

652
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:43,750
Stop.

653
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:45,541
Be careful everyone.

654
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,958
Uncle, did you see that?

655
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:51,958
Oh no!

656
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:00,833
- Swapan!
- Yes sir, okay sir.

657
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,999
Pradip, look on that side.

658
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
- Yes sir.
- Go look.

659
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,000
You check that side.
I'll check this, in case we find something.

660
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:32,083
Hey! How did you know
about the left ankle?

661
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,125
From that footprint.
Come here, I'll show you.

662
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,250
Come.

663
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,832
Sir, I think they
entered from core area 3.

664
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,333
I mean, that's what I think.

665
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:47,917
Hmm!

666
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:48,708
Pradip!

667
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:49,917
- Yes sir?
- Measuring tape!

668
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:50,708
Yes sir.

669
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:51,917
Measure it.

670
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,625
- Swapan!
- Yes sir.

671
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:55,612
- Hold this.
- Yes, give it to me.

672
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,124
9.5 ft.

673
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,083
- But sir Chengis is...
- 13.5 ft.

674
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,833
Sujoy uncle, look what is this!

675
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:15,708
Oh my goodness!

676
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,292
This is a bullet.

677
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:21,500
Sir, the local people
use it right?

678
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,375
Then, did they come
to kill Chengis?

679
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,292
What is that?

680
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,183
Give me a minute sir.
I'll look after it.

681
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,958
Shibu, there must be something.
Come here, fast.

682
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,917
Pradip, come here.

683
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,874
Hey! Get lost from here.

684
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,042
What is your problem?

685
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,917
How can you enter
anywhere without permission!

686
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,707
It's very dirty inside sir.

687
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,708
You don't enter please.
Let me handle it.

688
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,333
Hey! Stop I say.

689
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,134
Uncle, it looks like
they're from our village.

690
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:11,167
- How can you tell that?
- Look, the way we eat...

691
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,916
This kind of rice, onions, chillis...

692
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,124
salt and fishes from the river!

693
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,125
- Then sir, we must search all the villages.
- No, sir.

694
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,417
I mean, this can
offened the villagers!

695
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,542
For that, they might
not help us later.

696
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:27,156
But anyhow,
I have to catch them.

697
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,249
As long as I'm alive,

698
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,167
I won't let any harm
come to the animals.

699
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,083
Let's go.

700
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,042
Swapan, this way.

701
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,292
What are you getting?

702
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:49,750
- This things...
- Not that, many other things too.

703
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,958
One of them,
doesn't have his left ankle.

704
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,417
This is the clue.
Let's go.

705
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,041
Bloody fools!
You all are up to no good.

706
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:02,458
Uncle, did you see that?

707
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,167
14 ft. tiger!
You wish to earn a lot of moeny!

708
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,707
You people are from the village.
As if, you are genuis in hunting tigers.

709
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,749
Do think I'm a fool!

710
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,083
What will I do
with that 9ft. skin!

711
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:22,708
If you again waste my time like this,
I'll pay you not a single penny.

712
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:23,833
Hey!

713
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,833
The skin of Chengis...

714
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
nails...

715
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,125
teeth, I want everything.

716
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,750
Or else, I'll peel your skin off.

717
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,000
Please, come in brother.

718
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:58,000
Look, who has come.

719
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:00,916
- You here.
- Please do eat.

720
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:01,997
- Please sit.
- You sit too.

721
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Yes, I'm sitting.

722
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:05,374
- Serve him too.
- Yes, sure.

723
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,208
No, actually I came for him.

724
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,417
But you must have sweet,
to celebrate his deed.

725
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:14,000
- Sweet, but...
- Don't deny, this is from Bagbazar.

726
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,833
- From your place?
- Yes.

727
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:17,750
- Thank you.
- Please have.

728
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:18,958
But, what is this!

729
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,499
I told him not to
enter the jungle...

730
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,625
- still he went there.
- It's fine, don't scold him anymore.

731
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,249
Shibu was with him.

732
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,500
And without them, I have
never knew about this.

733
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,917
They're really brave.
They're the future of our country.

734
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,559
- My stomach is filled.
- Have some fruits then.

735
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,832
But trust me brother Shurojit...

736
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,750
Hmm!

737
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:40,249
This never happened
in the history of Barpahari.

738
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,250
They've built hidden
shades in the core area!

739
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Can you imagine?

740
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,083
I think some villagers
are also involved in this.

741
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:49,958
My God!
This is horrible!

742
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:51,666
You deperate kid,

743
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,583
your parents will be
very angry to know this.

744
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,874
- Don't worry uncle. I'm with him.
- I know that very well.

745
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:58,196
And, that is what
I fear the most.

746
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:02,375
No, they're really brave.
Well done! Now eat.

747
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,457
- No I'll come, but do visit Derang.
- Sure we will.

748
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,624
- Please have some fruits.
- We're coming in a minute.

749
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,458
- Hey!
- But you didn't finish!

750
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,707
- No, we're done.
- Don't go to far.

751
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:14,792
- Will you remember that?
- We're just outside.

752
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,417
Looks like you'll reach
Kolkata with this pace.

753
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,292
- Those poeple will kill Chengis!
- What will you do then?

754
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,667
- I'll save him.
- Save! But how?

755
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:32,912
From now on. we're the
officers of these wild animals.

756
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:33,958
Officer!

757
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,458
Yes, just like Sujoy uncle.

758
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,042
But, we're small officers.

759
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,832
We'll reveal those culprits.

760
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,667
- But they have guns!
- So what?

761
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:45,333
Tiger, deer, these trees, birds...

762
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:47,958
they should not be harmed.
So, we'll save them.

763
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,125
So, we're the officers
of these animals.

764
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,333
Now, you also want
to be an officer?

765
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:57,999
Okay, you're too.

766
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,041
From now, you, me and
Shibu will be officers.

767
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:02,499
We'll save Chengis.

768
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,333
Nani is an officer now.

769
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:05,458
Look, how happy he is.
See!

770
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,417
None of you, tells me anything!

771
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,250
How will I face Swagata,
if something bad happened!

772
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,875
Shibu is different.
But Jojo is very young!

773
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,792
A mahout's son is
different from our children!

774
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,250
And you're supporting him,
in the name of Wildlife conservation.

775
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:24,292
But won't he learn about
the nature and animals?

776
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:27,542
He'll but in school,
from his parents.

777
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,042
Why us! And if something
happenes to him here, then!

778
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,083
He'll learn nothing.
He can't even spell 'Discipline'.

779
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:37,750
You don't talk.
You'll urinate if you see a snake!

780
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:40,458
Jojo! Do you know they
score 100 in every subject!

781
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,042
Schol exams are not enough
to build characters.

782
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:47,333
He's right. They're even
scared of butterflies.

783
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:50,125
Considering that,
he's enough brave.

784
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,832
Brave my foot!
Let him spend more time with Shibu...

785
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,208
he'll start smoking as well.

786
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,708
Jojo, you should have
brought your home works.

787
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:04,875
If you ever go to the jungle,
I'll lock you in the room.

788
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,875
What are you staring at!
Go to bed.

789
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,417
Go to bed at once!

790
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,708
Oh God!

791
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,393
What's the matter Mr. Mukherjee?
Suddenly, you here!

792
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:32,833
I came due to some urgency.
How is sister?

793
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:35,624
- Yeah, all are fine. Please say.
- Oh!

794
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:38,042
Let me introduce you.
He's Mr. Suman Hajari.

795
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,499
He is staying in
our guest house.

796
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,749
- He's on tourism buisness.
- Oh! I see.

797
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,111
He's wishing to
work in Arunachal..

798
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:45,250
That's great!
Please come have a seat.

799
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,042
- What about some tea?
- Do you want tea?

800
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:53,708
No, thank you.

801
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:54,292
So, tell me.

802
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,417
- I came for some help.
- Sure, tell me.

803
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,268
The after tomorrow,
two of his guests will be arriving here.

804
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:01,625
Our guest house is full.

805
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,249
Can you arrange
something in yours?

806
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,666
Oh! But our guest house
is under maintanence.

807
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:09,542
- That is not ready yet very sorry.
- Oh! I see.

808
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,458
May be somewhere else...
Who is he?

809
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,083
That's my nephew.
He's from Kolkata.

810
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:22,917
Sweet boy.

811
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,541
What are doing here?

812
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,957
To visit the jungle.

813
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,375
- Really? Good!
- Yes.

814
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,583
Visit the jungle.
But, don't go much inside it.

815
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:50,292
There is tiger in it.

816
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,874
If you go in the jungle...

817
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:58,500
tiger will eat you up in pieces.

818
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,833
Be very careful!

819
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:17,417
- Mr. Mukherjee!
- You're leaving then?

820
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,792
- Okay.
- We'll see you then.

821
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,542
- Are you done?
- Yes, almost.

822
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,541
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I saw he has no left ankle.

823
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:53,917
He limps while walking.

824
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,500
Let me show you one more thing.

825
00:56:58,417 --> 00:56:59,791
- See this.
- I've this too.

826
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,167
- You have it too?
- See this.

827
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,916
Same hand writing!

828
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,207
What do we do now?

829
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:09,833
That man came to see you.

830
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:15,958
Let him. We're officers now.
We have to reveal him. It's our duty.

831
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:18,916
Should we tell Sujoy uncle?

832
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:21,000
He left for the
city early morning.

833
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,958
- What about Swapan uncle?
- Swapan uncle!

834
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:27,583
Okay, let's go then.

835
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:30,667
- Can you whisle?
- Yes, I can.

836
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,542
But at home,
I get scold for this.

837
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:36,083
Then do this.
Try it.

838
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,669
This will be our signal,
if we get in any trouble.

839
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:52,166
- Swapan uncle!
- Swapan uncle!

840
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,167
Who is it?

841
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,041
- What's the matter?
- We've found that limping man.

842
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:58,167
What! You have found
the limping man.

843
00:57:58,792 --> 00:57:59,916
You two again started all this.

844
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:01,624
If anything happens,
the blame will come on us.

845
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,333
Shibu should I tell your father?

846
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:05,749
Nothing will harm us uncle.
You better catch that man.

847
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,417
He's staying in the
Danulite tea guest house.

848
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,208
Hey! wait there.

849
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:18,083
How did you know all this?

850
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,583
- They have threatened us.
- I have it too.

851
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,292
Beware! Too much curiosity
is not good.

852
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:33,375
Okay, I'll talk to sir about this.

853
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,916
You two don't get
involve in these.

854
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:36,833
They are not nice people.

855
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:38,167
Go now.

856
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,083
Let's go.

857
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:41,792
And listen...

858
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,611
No need to tell
anybody about this.

859
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,208
I'll tell Sujoy sir about this.

860
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:47,917
Go now.

861
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,249
They will surely arrest
that limping man now.

862
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,125
Yes, but I have my doubts.

863
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:07,417
If that limping man has given
us the threatning letter...

864
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:11,125
then how did he know that
we discovered that killing sight?

865
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:17,750
Exactly! Apart from Swapan, Sujoy,
Pradip and Baul uncle no one knows this.

866
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,042
Swapan uncle told
us not to tell anyone!

867
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,292
- Let's go Nani.
- Even not to Sujoy uncle!

868
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,208
That means, Swapan uncle!

869
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:32,250
Nani you go home.
We'll come later.

870
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,707
- Where did he go?
- Let's follow him.

871
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,708
Okay, let's go.

872
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,917
Come this way.

873
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,125
Move fast!

874
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,416
- Sir, try to understand.
- I don't want to hear any rubbish.

875
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,217
- No rubbish at all.
- But those kids know it.

876
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:29,833
- If they tell the ranger you'll be in danger!
- What did I come here for?

877
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,875
Business right!
What business I do?

878
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,022
The business of selling animal skins.

879
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:37,124
Do you want me to run
away because of those kids?

880
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,000
- If they tell the ranger?
- Then kill them.

881
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,041
- What!
- Kill those two kids.

882
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,642
- What! You want me to kill those little kids?
- Yes, you have to.

883
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,917
Without Chengis's skin,
I'll go nowhere from here.

884
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,002
- Getting caught will be a big trouble!
- For you.

885
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:50,458
You'll be in trouble.

886
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,833
Not me!

887
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:54,542
Have this water,
cool down your head.

888
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:58,042
Go home. Come at night,
I'll tell you everything.

889
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:13,124
I can't be outside at night!

890
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,667
What will you do then?

891
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,042
Think something!

892
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:24,042
Do one thing, you go home.
I'll come to your window at night.

893
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,207
You go home now.

894
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,874
- You won't be able to do it alone.
- I can.

895
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,156
- Be careful then.
- Yes, I will.

896
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:40,667
Mother!

897
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,374
Is this a time to
come back home?

898
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,707
You went in the afternoon,
and now you're coming!

899
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,874
Jojo! I'll scold you a lot now.

900
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:53,250
- Why don't you listen?
- No, I didn't go out at night!

901
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,041
But, you'll roam around all day?

902
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,375
You again went to the jungle?

903
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,624
So, you're lieing now?

904
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:02,375
Shishir Ji said, you and Shibu
were running in the roads!

905
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Did you see that?

906
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,417
And you'll not
tell him anything!

907
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,875
Father, tells him nothing!

908
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,416
What are you up to!

909
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:17,417
Your brother listen everything we say.
What do you do in the jungle?

910
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:19,707
Why do care about
this poaching thing?

911
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,374
Will this way you'll get 90%?

912
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,374
But we must save the wildlife!

913
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,374
- That is true also!
- Look how he is talking!

914
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,499
There's a gov. for this.
It's there work.

915
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,832
You're supposed
to study all day!

916
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:32,708
Come I'll lock you inside.
None of you dare to come here.

917
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:34,167
Come with me at once!

918
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,893
You have taken the
responsibility to save the animals!

919
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:41,541
Tiger will eat you up in pieces.

920
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:43,500
I'll teach you a lesson today!

921
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,541
- Well done!
- What?

922
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,917
You are just like me.

923
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,832
I also loved adventure
when I was a kid.

924
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,750
Once to climb Everest,
I ran away from home.

925
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,708
And your grandpa
beated me for that.

926
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:24,167
- But here the risk is more.
- If the kill Chengis then...

927
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,375
- If they kill Chengis?
- You're doing nothing wrong.

928
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:36,167
For this aunt will scold you.
So will I to prove that we're elders.

929
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:42,250
Remember one thing Jojo,
if you only study to score 100...

930
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:47,832
then you'll only get the number,
and will not learn anything.

931
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:52,458
The actual lesson lies in the nature!

932
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:58,207
Just be careful,
in what you're doing.

933
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,792
My best wishes to you,
Mr. Jojo Gupta.

934
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,125
- If I ever see you going to the jungle...
- Uncle!

935
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,833
What's the matter?

936
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:19,917
Thank you.

937
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,292
Show me, what you've brought?

938
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,292
Great!

939
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:54,417
After cleaning it,
it's looking much better.

940
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:59,833
Now I'll peel Chengis's
skin off and after that...

941
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:05,624
I'll peel your skin off!
Two poachers went to kill that tiger...

942
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:08,333
but they killed the wrong tiger.
What are you doing?

943
01:06:09,042 --> 01:06:10,457
It's not that easy
to kill Chengis.

944
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,207
People say he walks in the air!

945
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,666
He can smell from far away.

946
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:14,542
Shut up!

947
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:16,124
You coward! He can smell from far...

948
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,707
Hey! I have promised the party...

949
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,125
to deliver them Chengis's
nails, teeth and skin.

950
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:30,667
If I fail to keep the promise,
you both will be the food for Chengis.

951
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:39,042
You know what, Mr. bose,
loosing temper...

952
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,625
on such petty matters
doesn't suit you at all.

953
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,375
I'm accustomed with Chengis,
from a very long time.

954
01:06:46,583 --> 01:06:48,292
You don't need
to worry about anything.

955
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:52,083
Without money I'll not
work with you anymore.

956
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,457
When bullet is just
0.5 inch near the skull...

957
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,899
instead of God people call
out Munia Hajari's name! Get it?

958
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,167
Munia Ji, I told you I need the
money for my mother's illness.

959
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:17,374
I've no money after paying
the bill of the hospital.

960
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,708
- What the hell all this!
- Please, try to understand.

961
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:24,292
- Please help me...
- Money is not that easy to get!

962
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:29,500
Then give me this skin,
I'll carry the treatment by selling it.

963
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,250
Now, look after your slave,
you lame man...

964
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:42,542
or else, before he fires me,
I'll bash your brains out!

965
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,875
I'll inform the forest dept.

966
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:46,957
I'll manage everything with money.

967
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:49,042
Then, your body
will be disappeared.

968
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,500
Do you think you'll live,
if you backstab us?

969
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:54,250
Didn't get it?

970
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,458
Actually, I've 100 more
people like you under me.

971
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:02,125
Chill out and find Chengis.
Then we all will get the profit.

972
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:07,000
If we tell the forest dept.
About your deed, then?

973
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:12,667
You'll get the money
so, stop all this!

974
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,666
The good boy has
taken down the gun.

975
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:15,458
You also take your gun down!

976
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,458
Take it down!

977
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,874
What a sweet boy!

978
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:23,833
Where the poachers
are going to take shelter?

979
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,417
Inside the Jungle camp,
above the hill.

980
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,957
- No one will have doubts, right?
- You can relax.

981
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:29,958
No one goes there.

982
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,332
Tomorrow, I'll go to the city,

983
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,957
and by selling this skin
will return back the next day.

984
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,667
Within that I want Chengis's
skin, teeth and nails.

985
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,483
What about those
two notorious kids?

986
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,250
Sujoy sir is not here,
so, I'll handle the matter.

987
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,500
Swapan, don't try to
be a over smart!

988
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,333
I'll beat the hell out of you!

989
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,333
Keep an eye on them.
Get lost now!

990
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,583
Wait, I'm opening it.

991
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,541
All the poachers are at the jungle
camp on the top of the hill.

992
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:14,976
And they're planning to
kill Chengis tomorrow.

993
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,874
That bad guy Mr. Bose
is after Chengis's skin.

994
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,207
He also has the
recently killed tiger's skin.

995
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:23,541
He'll be going to the
city tomorrow to sell it.

996
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,041
We've to catch
every single one of them!

997
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:28,541
And, we must stop Mr. Bose from
going to the city tomorrow.

998
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,542
But how?

999
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,874
How... well, Sujoy uncle!

1000
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:36,125
We've to inform him any how
within tomorrow morning.

1001
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,000
You go home now.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1002
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,375
- Okay, then see you tomorrow.
- Go carefully.

1003
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,542
Where are you going?

1004
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:02,042
- Good morning, Shishir Ji.
- Good morning.

1005
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:03,792
Come water the flowers.

1006
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:08,167
- I need to pee.
- Fine, then go inside.

1007
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:08,875
Can I do it outside?

1008
01:11:08,876 --> 01:11:10,792
- Outside?
- Yes.

1009
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,917
Okay, then don't go to far.

1010
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,000
Come fast.

1011
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:28,625
Get up, hurry.

1012
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,541
Sujoy uncle!

1013
01:11:49,542 --> 01:11:50,542
Who is it?

1014
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,750
What's the matter?

1015
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,000
You all here?

1016
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,332
Where is Sujoy uncle?

1017
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:57,208
He went to Dibrugar,
due to some official work.

1018
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,208
- Uncle is not here then...
- What to do?

1019
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:02,184
Is there anything
to tell him about?

1020
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:03,083
No, aunt actually...

1021
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:05,999
Nothing, just don't tell
anyone about our arrival!

1022
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,125
- Even not to Swapan uncle.
- Absolutely not.

1023
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:09,542
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

1024
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:14,625
- Hey, listen do I need to tell Sujoy anything?
- Tell him to come back as soon as he can.

1025
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,750
We really needed him here.

1026
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,250
Wait a second.

1027
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:22,995
What if, we give him a call?

1028
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:24,667
The network is
not very good here.

1029
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,958
And to get the number,
we've to ask aunt again.

1030
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,041
If we can't stop Bose...

1031
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:30,624
we won't be able to
stop the poachers too.

1032
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:31,875
Thus, they'll kill Chengis!

1033
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,250
Then, the police?

1034
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,708
If we tell the police,
then the forest dept. will know too.

1035
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,917
Hence, Swapan uncle
will get to know too.

1036
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,199
He will save the culprits then!

1037
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:40,708
Then, what will you do?

1038
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:42,583
We've to set a trap.

1039
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:43,750
A trap!

1040
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,250
A trap to catch Bose.

1041
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:48,707
Is there any kind of fruit in jungle,
that can unconscious people?

1042
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,124
Or, makes them fell
asleep for a long time!

1043
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:52,542
Yes there is one.
Even I slept long after having it once.

1044
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:54,833
- How good is your aim?
- Really good.

1045
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,333
- But why?
- You'll be tested then. Let's go.

1046
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Come.

1047
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,958
Sir, how was your sight-seeing?

1048
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,601
What the hell!
Is that you call a sight-seeing?

1049
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:27,041
Just to see a crane and a deer...

1050
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:28,457
I had to wake up at 3:30 a.m.

1051
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,179
If that is a safari,
it was a waste of time.

1052
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:32,000
All rubbish!
Prepare the breakfast.

1053
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:32,708
Let's go sir.

1054
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,708
Come in.

1055
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,250
- Let's go.
- Come quickly!

1056
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,739
I hope, you're not scared right?

1057
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,125
You're ready right?

1058
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,042
Give it to me.

1059
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,333
Hold it then.

1060
01:14:20,542 --> 01:14:21,542
Oh God!

1061
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,375
Mix it quick.

1062
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,292
- Here take it.
- Give it.

1063
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,125
Move quick.

1064
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:40,042
"Who knew you'll be here?"

1065
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:48,792
- Who is it?
- Sir, your breakfast.

1066
01:14:50,042 --> 01:14:51,042
Keep it there.

1067
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,726
Tell them to prepare the bill,
I'll leave after finishing the breakfast.

1068
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,375
Okay, sir.

1069
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,292
"I beg to you Mr. Tiger..."

1070
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,708
"...don't shower your anger."

1071
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,458
"Who knew you'll be here?"

1072
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:16,624
Tell Mr. Bose the car is waiting.

1073
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,000
Okay, he's getting ready.

1074
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:33,458
Oh God!
Is anybody here?

1075
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:36,374
That wild fruit
worked well then.

1076
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:38,958
I knew it will. I got unconscious
once after having it.

1077
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,083
Sir?

1078
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,999
What's wrong sir?

1079
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,792
Go call a doctor.
Bring the ambulance.

1080
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,458
Is anyone here?
Where did the driver go?

1081
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,292
We've to go to the hospital!

1082
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,397
Let's see Sujoy uncle
returned or not?

1083
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,833
I can't reach his call!

1084
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:09,458
Not to the others?

1085
01:16:10,042 --> 01:16:11,202
What kind of a phone is this?

1086
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:12,697
It's not the fault of the phone.

1087
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:14,875
You know the condition
of the network here.

1088
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,999
When I finally got the line
of Dibrugar's office...

1089
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,292
your uncle left for Dispur.

1090
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,292
And there the net
is not working at all.

1091
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,208
Can you please
tell me what's the matter?

1092
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:30,000
- Actually we're the officer of animals...
- That I can get by seeing you two.

1093
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:33,792
Tell me, what's the matter?

1094
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:36,375
No, we can't tell.
Sujoy uncle told us not to tell.

1095
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,833
If Sujoy uncle calls then tell him...

1096
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:41,448
to come to the jungle camp
with the forest guards soon.

1097
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:43,752
Don't forget. Or else, there
will be huge trouble.

1098
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,208
Let's go.

1099
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:48,458
It's me who is in trouble now.

1100
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,207
- Swapan, it's me sister.
- Yes, sister say.

1101
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:34,166
- It's urgent, come here quickly.
- Okay sister.

1102
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,167
Hmm.

1103
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:37,167
Let's go Nani.

1104
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:42,292
Let's go Nani.

1105
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:44,917
How far?

1106
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:46,250
There, inside the jungle.

1107
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,500
Oh!

1108
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,667
Listen, I think we
better keep Nani here...

1109
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,167
Why?

1110
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:52,083
Or else, it'll be tough
to hide Nani there!

1111
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,052
We'll call him,
only when we step in trouble.

1112
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,083
Okay?

1113
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Sit down Nani.

1114
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,250
Hold my hand.

1115
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:11,833
Come on, fast.

1116
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:16,625
Come.

1117
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,500
Come quickly.

1118
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:25,917
What will you do now?

1119
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,208
Huh!

1120
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,458
Let's go that side.

1121
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,333
Let's go.

1122
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:48,292
Let's go.

1123
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,083
Come on.

1124
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Come inside.

1125
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:04,125
Sister!

1126
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:05,625
I'm here.

1127
01:19:13,292 --> 01:19:13,875
Swapan!

1128
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:14,958
Yes, tell me.

1129
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,243
Swapan, we're in huge danger!

1130
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,375
The kids got to know something.

1131
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:19,625
Know what?

1132
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:22,125
They are not telling me that!

1133
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:26,250
But by guessing I think,
it's about the poachers.

1134
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,375
I fear, that they might step
in some unknown danger!

1135
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:32,458
- What are you saying?
- Exactly!

1136
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:35,234
They are coming here now and then,
and asking about your sir.

1137
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,750
They were here some seconds ago.

1138
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:38,582
They told me, once your sir comes...

1139
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:41,667
I must send him to the
jungle camp with forest guards.

1140
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,042
Jungle camp!

1141
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,208
I don't know what to do!

1142
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:49,012
Look sister, how many times I tell them,
but they never listen to me.

1143
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:50,792
These kids!

1144
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,958
I feel really nervous!

1145
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:56,583
Relax! You told me,
I'll look over them now.

1146
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,667
Hmm!

1147
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:14,500
You go that side,
I'll check this way.

1148
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:11,042
Hello!

1149
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:12,292
What's the matter?

1150
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,500
Dibrugar office informed
me that you called.

1151
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,167
Something is very wrong here.

1152
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,625
I'm really scared.
You please come soon.

1153
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,333
Why? What's the matter?

1154
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:23,333
Shibu and Jojo might know something
about these poachers.

1155
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,208
They've built their bases
on the Jungle camp.

1156
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:27,333
What?

1157
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,500
What are you saying?

1158
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:30,958
I don't know.
I'm really scared.

1159
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:37,708
I've informed Swapan about all this,
so that he can protect them

1160
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:38,500
Hello!

1161
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:41,208
- Hello!
- Hello!

1162
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:43,357
- Can you hear me?
- Can you hear me?

1163
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Come here.

1164
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,375
Listen, we've to go
out from that hole.

1165
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:10,042
Hey! Catch them.

1166
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:11,417
Move quick.

1167
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:16,667
- Come quick.
- Don't let him go!

1168
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,250
Let him go.

1169
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:18,875
Pull him inside!

1170
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:21,333
Leave me and go.
You go tell Sujoy uncle.

1171
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:27,292
Shibu!

1172
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,458
Run away Jojo.

1173
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:35,750
Friendship!

1174
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:40,625
The forest kid is now
friend of the kid from the city.

1175
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,875
You two will save Chengis? Wow!

1176
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:47,542
Listen to this.

1177
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,292
Two kings can never
rule one Jungle!

1178
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:55,042
Either there will be Chengis,
or it will be me!

1179
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,333
There's no need of goat.

1180
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:06,167
Use this kid to trap Chengis!

1181
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,667
You are planning
to save Chengis!

1182
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:14,583
Take out the car!

1183
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,067
We've to catch that kid!
Let's move!

1184
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:42,708
He's there!

1185
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:44,042
Catch him!

1186
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,208
Don't let him run away!

1187
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,250
Catch him!

1188
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:58,000
Stop Nani!

1189
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,333
Stop Nani!

1190
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,083
If they see you,
you'll be in danger.

1191
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,917
Nani I must hide you.
Sit down!

1192
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:04,542
Great Nani!

1193
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:14,708
You keep hiding here quietly.

1194
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,792
Those people have guns.

1195
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:18,125
You might get hurt!

1196
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,000
I'll bring back Shibu anyhow.

1197
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:30,625
You don't worry.

1198
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:49,083
Stop!

1199
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:50,167
Catch him!

1200
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,042
Catch him all of you!

1201
01:29:53,208 --> 01:29:55,000
- From here.
- Let's fire!

1202
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:56,750
Stop!

1203
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:58,333
Catch him fast!

1204
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,583
Stop!

1205
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:08,042
Go from here!

1206
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,917
I'm telling you, stop!

1207
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:19,042
Look there he is.

1208
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:30,667
Run from that side.

1209
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:33,667
He's running away.
Catch him!

1210
01:30:37,667 --> 01:30:39,187
- Which way?
- Catch him from that way.

1211
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,083
Surround him!

1212
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:58,917
"The little boy went to sleep..."

1213
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:01,216
"just then the poachers
entered the jungle."

1214
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,875
"The little boy,
is striving to fly too high..."

1215
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,792
"being unaware that
he might die."

1216
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:10,917
Your friend Shibu is dying,
you'll die too now.

1217
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,958
The kid from the city!

1218
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,417
So much dumb!

1219
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,667
The game is over!

1220
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,250
He got saved.

1221
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:26,458
Where is Shibu?

1222
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:28,542
Don't kill my friend Shibu!

1223
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:30,417
What a friendship!

1224
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,582
Don't kill your friend!

1225
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:35,958
I told you not to go
deeper in the jungle.

1226
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,042
Because this jungle
has tiger inside it.

1227
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:45,000
If the tiger sees you, it
will eat you up in pieces.

1228
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:52,583
Now, the tiger is in front of you.

1229
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,417
You will not kill Chengis!

1230
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:01,750
I met him once.

1231
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:06,167
The scar that
I have in my face...

1232
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:07,792
he gave it to me.

1233
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,291
I don't have one ear of mine.

1234
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:10,292
He took it.

1235
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,500
I have scars in my back full.

1236
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:18,083
Chengis!

1237
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:27,417
Hold it.

1238
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:29,625
See this.

1239
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,875
He took it.

1240
01:32:32,292 --> 01:32:33,292
Mine...

1241
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:38,667
It's because you tried to kill him.

1242
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:42,000
Since past 3 years...

1243
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:43,917
do it properly.

1244
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,333
Since past 3 years
I'm looking for him.

1245
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:49,333
This time I will peel his skin off!

1246
01:32:50,417 --> 01:32:51,750
Who are you to save him?

1247
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:58,167
All of you tie him up,
and throw him to the river.

1248
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:00,917
Wants to save Chengis!

1249
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:02,500
Come on, get up.

1250
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,125
Mr. Shibu!

1251
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:31,833
Are you liking
the world upside down?

1252
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,542
Really nice!

1253
01:34:33,917 --> 01:34:39,167
I'm rulling this jungle on my
own from a long time.

1254
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:43,083
No one dared to stop me but...

1255
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,667
you and your city friend Jojo...

1256
01:34:46,917 --> 01:34:48,542
found out everything about me!

1257
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:55,417
And you though you'll save
Chengis by informing the police, but...

1258
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,167
now who will save you?

1259
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:02,833
Let me give you a good news
that your friend Jojo...

1260
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:04,288
he's at our custody now.

1261
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,457
Now on may be his body
is swiming in the river...

1262
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:07,458
now it's your turn.

1263
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:09,833
What a scapegoat!

1264
01:35:10,292 --> 01:35:12,083
You'll be Chengis's food...

1265
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:15,125
and to get you
Chengis will be my dinner!

1266
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:16,583
Isn't the plan too good?

1267
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:20,750
You might kill me,
but you don't know Jojo.

1268
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:22,250
No one can harm him.

1269
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:30,625
God told me...

1270
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:36,542
Munia don't kill
the kids, that's a sin!

1271
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:41,583
Or else, my bullets will
have pierced you!

1272
01:35:41,792 --> 01:35:43,000
You're showing me Jojo.

1273
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:44,875
That no one can harm him!

1274
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,708
Nice one.

1275
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:52,957
If I bring his head in front
of you, will you believe me?

1276
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:56,000
You'll see we can
harm Jojo or not!

1277
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,791
I want Chengis anyhow.
Move him upside down.

1278
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,333
He thinks I'll fear Jojo.

1279
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:11,792
Where did the kid go?

1280
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:17,917
- A tiger was here.
- Yes, it seems like that.

1281
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:20,042
Look at that side.

1282
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,500
Murder!

1283
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:32,375
Chengis!

1284
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:34,125
Bhima!

1285
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,125
Einus!

1286
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:43,625
Stop Nani!

1287
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,083
Again it's Chengis!

1288
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,625
He killed my boys.

1289
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,333
Not again!

1290
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,542
Not all of them!

1291
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:07,625
But where did that kid go?

1292
01:38:18,667 --> 01:38:19,750
Find him, let's go.

1293
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:23,416
He might have gone
to the ranger's house.

1294
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:24,417
Let's go there.

1295
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,583
Sujoy uncle!

1296
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:44,625
Jojo!

1297
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,542
Sujoy uncle!

1298
01:38:47,583 --> 01:38:48,583
Jojo!

1299
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:50,167
What's the matter Jojo?

1300
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:52,667
- They caught Shibu!
- Who? Where?

1301
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:53,958
- The poachers.
- What?

1302
01:38:54,417 --> 01:38:56,042
They are at the jungle camp.

1303
01:38:56,583 --> 01:38:57,625
You all please save him.

1304
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,292
What are you saying?

1305
01:38:58,750 --> 01:38:59,750
Jojo!

1306
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,250
Jojo!

1307
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:08,417
Jojo!

1308
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:16,958
Jojo open your eyes.

1309
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:21,666
What happened to you Jojo?

1310
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,417
Tell me what's the matter?

1311
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,500
Shibu!

1312
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:32,083
- Where is Shibu?
- Where is he?

1313
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:33,958
The poachers have
captured Shibu.

1314
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,542
And Swapan uncle is
on their side.

1315
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:40,292
Swapan uncle, told
everything to them.

1316
01:39:40,542 --> 01:39:41,833
What are you saying?

1317
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,333
I told everything to Swapan.

1318
01:39:44,417 --> 01:39:45,417
What will happen now!

1319
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:48,625
They'll kill Chengis.

1320
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,625
They'll kill Shibu too.

1321
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:52,333
Nothing will happen!

1322
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,375
Sujoy uncle, will come soon.

1323
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,500
Your Sujoy uncle is here.

1324
01:39:58,542 --> 01:39:59,542
You sit here quietly!

1325
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:10,167
- Munia Ji if they see me then...
- Shut up!

1326
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,292
Greetings sister.

1327
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:19,625
Myself, Munia Hajari.
So, the thing is...

1328
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:23,208
the little kid whom you
have hidden in here...

1329
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:26,958
we've come to take him,
to scold him little bit.

1330
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:29,792
Sister is getting scared.
Go, see upstairs.

1331
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:31,208
Go fast!

1332
01:40:33,417 --> 01:40:37,042
They've surrounded the house.
What will happen now?

1333
01:40:37,917 --> 01:40:39,542
Sister, open the door!

1334
01:40:39,708 --> 01:40:41,041
Take Jojo out,
or it'll be a lot of trouble.

1335
01:40:41,042 --> 01:40:42,562
- Get him out!
- Open the door, sister.

1336
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:47,749
Come on quick.

1337
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,500
Don't take trouble!
Open the door.

1338
01:40:50,292 --> 01:40:51,792
Why is it taking so much time?

1339
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:54,399
- Munia Ji, she's not opening the door.
- Break the door then!

1340
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:55,542
Shoot them!

1341
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,332
If the kid lives,
police will arrest all of us.

1342
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:04,583
Kill them Swapan now!

1343
01:41:06,375 --> 01:41:08,750
Do it quickly.
I want that kid anyhow.

1344
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:09,625
Come on!

1345
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:10,875
Car!

1346
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,458
- Hide!
- Surrender yourself!

1347
01:41:16,458 --> 01:41:17,833
Pradip, take your position!

1348
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,831
Don't you dare to run away!

1349
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,992
Everyone, drop your guns down!

1350
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:36,875
Run!

1351
01:41:37,042 --> 01:41:38,042
Run everyone!

1352
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:44,333
- Run Swapan!
- Sir, that is Swapan.

1353
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,250
Swapan!

1354
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:54,625
Pradip!

1355
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:55,292
Sir!

1356
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:56,458
Call out the forces.

1357
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,375
Yes sir!

1358
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:58,417
Leena!

1359
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,083
Control room!
It's an emergency.

1360
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:01,208
Leena!

1361
01:42:01,417 --> 01:42:02,417
Sujoy uncle!

1362
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:05,625
Leena, you're fine right?

1363
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:09,792
- Jojo!
- Jojo are you alright?

1364
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,039
Tell me, what's the matter?

1365
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:12,583
- I was running...
- Okay. Then?

1366
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:15,875
The ranger has to arrive now!
What the hell!

1367
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:16,875
Let's go this way.

1368
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:19,393
- And that kid got saved too.
- What will happen to me now?

1369
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:20,500
Sujoy sir has seen us.

1370
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:24,042
You're laughing?

1371
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:26,083
Should I cry or what!

1372
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:28,166
The ranger has seen you.

1373
01:42:28,167 --> 01:42:29,374
It's your job.

1374
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,333
You'll bear the consequences.
Why would I care!

1375
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:32,583
Are you crazy or what!

1376
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:33,583
I didn't get the money.

1377
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:34,625
Now, my job will go too.

1378
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:35,458
What will I do now!

1379
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:37,875
How can you get wages
from two places at the same time!

1380
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,583
I'll tell everything,
if I get caught.

1381
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:46,000
Swapan, why are you
worrying so much?

1382
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,875
You'll tell things,
if you ever get caught!

1383
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:50,333
What!

1384
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,125
Naughty boy!

1385
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:12,958
Hey, stop!

1386
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:14,708
Back, go back!

1387
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:22,417
- Swapan!
- Swapan!

1388
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:25,697
I've committed a huge crime sir.

1389
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:27,167
- What?
- For my mother's...

1390
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:29,583
- operation, I needed money.
- What?

1391
01:43:30,292 --> 01:43:30,750
Shibu!

1392
01:43:30,917 --> 01:43:32,000
- Shibu!
- Where is Shibu?

1393
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:41,625
In the jungle. They're using
him to trap Changis.

1394
01:43:43,167 --> 01:43:45,500
Go save Biju's son.

1395
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:47,042
Swapan! Swapan!

1396
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:50,041
Babluda, take him
to the hospital!

1397
01:43:50,042 --> 01:43:52,292
Jojo you go sit inside the car.
Everyone, follow me.

1398
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:55,417
Follow us.
Come fast.

1399
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:55,458
Down! Down!

1400
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:57,458
Sit!

1401
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:40,708
Fire, after my count to 3.

1402
01:45:43,667 --> 01:45:46,167
1-2-action!

1403
01:45:52,375 --> 01:45:53,375
Shibu!

1404
01:45:55,708 --> 01:45:57,083
- Shibu!
- Untie me fast!

1405
01:45:57,458 --> 01:45:58,458
Jojo!

1406
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,167
Get up Shibu!

1407
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:04,333
- Are you alright?
- Yes, uncle.

1408
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:09,667
- Pradip, cover them!
- Take it back, fast.

1409
01:46:10,708 --> 01:46:12,457
Shibu, move back!

1410
01:46:12,458 --> 01:46:13,458
Get up, fast!

1411
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,458
You go on, I'll cover here.

1412
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:20,542
Hurry up!

1413
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,167
Towards the tree!

1414
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:08,917
Let's go.

1415
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,000
Come here, quickly.

1416
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,833
God said, not to kill children.

1417
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,292
But...

1418
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,083
Chengis!

1419
01:50:04,667 --> 01:50:07,500
Wild and huge one...

1420
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:16,542
The bullets!

1421
01:50:29,083 --> 01:50:30,208
No!

1422
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:36,375
Take the gun down!

1423
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:19,083
- Get up!
- So, you caught me ranger!

1424
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:21,625
I was after you
from a long time.

1425
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:24,250
This gun cheated me otherwise...

1426
01:51:26,167 --> 01:51:27,542
Mr. Munia Hajari!

1427
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:29,833
What did you think?

1428
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:34,208
That will kill tigers and
destruct the jungle like a hero?

1429
01:51:35,292 --> 01:51:37,833
I've arrested your another
companion from hospital.

1430
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,833
Move aside!

1431
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:39,708
Here's this guy.

1432
01:51:39,708 --> 01:51:40,375
What!

1433
01:51:40,376 --> 01:51:42,167
What an audacity!
Smuggling in my area?

1434
01:51:42,417 --> 01:51:43,541
Doctor, I'll arrest him.

1435
01:51:43,542 --> 01:51:44,749
You all stay here.

1436
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:46,167
I'll teach you a lesson!

1437
01:51:50,292 --> 01:51:51,292
What now!

1438
01:51:53,667 --> 01:51:56,000
But before going,
understand one thing clearly...

1439
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:58,083
those who love this jungle...

1440
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:01,667
are also loved by the
jungle and its animals too.

1441
01:52:02,042 --> 01:52:04,875
And not only loves them,
protects them too.

1442
01:52:08,583 --> 01:52:09,583
Take him to the car!

1443
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:11,125
Go!

1444
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:13,167
Move! Move!

1445
01:52:13,168 --> 01:52:15,083
I'll not let you go Jojo.

1446
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:18,708
Bravo!

1447
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:20,792
Bravo, my two little heroes!

1448
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:24,542
Today, you not only saved Chengis,
but the jungle too.

1449
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:26,958
I'm proud of you.

1450
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,292
You're the future
of the country.

1451
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
You're the next
generations of officers!

1452
01:52:41,333 --> 01:52:43,125
Go, learn to appreciate
the good in people.

1453
01:52:44,667 --> 01:52:46,042
Don't be a green-eyed person!

1454
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Give it to me.

1455
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,250
Go!

1456
01:53:05,292 --> 01:53:07,958
Here are your toys.
And the books are over it.

1457
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,208
Jojo! You are great.

1458
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:21,250
You are really brave.
A hero indeed!

1459
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:28,083
He not only saved a tiger,
he has taught us...

1460
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:30,542
how to love nature
and it's animals.

1461
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:32,958
I'm proud of you.

1462
01:53:41,792 --> 01:53:43,542
- Nani!
- Go.

1463
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:01,083
So, you're leaving then!

1464
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:04,291
Will you come
to Barapahari again?

1465
01:54:04,292 --> 01:54:05,792
I will come.

1466
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:07,458
Will you come
to Kolkata with me?

1467
01:54:08,042 --> 01:54:10,832
How can I go to Kolkata,
leaving the jungle and Nani?

1468
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:12,417
I don't know all that.

1469
01:54:12,708 --> 01:54:13,708
You have to come.

1470
01:54:16,208 --> 01:54:19,542
Okay, you tell manager uncle,
I'll surely go.

1471
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:21,417
- Really?
- Yes.

1472
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:27,208
Come, or else
we'll miss the flight.

1473
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,500
Go.

1474
01:54:41,667 --> 01:54:42,875
I'll miss you a lot.

1475
01:55:01,792 --> 01:55:04,583
Don't get angry.
You'll not forget me right?

1476
01:55:05,708 --> 01:55:07,250
I'll come to you again.

1477
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:17,833
- Take care of Nani.
- I'll.

1478
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:21,583
From now, this belongs to you.

1479
01:55:38,208 --> 01:55:39,208
I'll go now.

1480
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:42,611
Never say go,
say we'll meet again.

1481
01:55:43,667 --> 01:55:44,667
We'll meet again.

1482
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:54,375
- Stop the car uncle!
- What's the matter?

1483
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:22,250
Are you getting it?

1484
01:57:23,792 --> 01:57:26,042
Chengis is upset,
because you're leaving.

1485
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Let's go.

1486
01:57:30,375 --> 01:57:31,375
Yes.
