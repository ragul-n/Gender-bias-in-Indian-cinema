2
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,378
My name is Anand.

3
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:26,553
I never wanted to experience
or see this day in my life..

4
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,796
..but it came today.

5
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,269
The reason for it is my love story.

6
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:34,445
Every love story has some problem.

7
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:38,405
But the problem in
my love story is.. Me.

8
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,349
Because I have OCD.

9
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,336
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

10
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:47,512
If you do an in-depth study,
there are many types in it..

11
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:49,850
..but the one I had was
over cleanliness and neatness.

12
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,404
Doing things repetitively
and scrubbing things repetitively..

13
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:54,553
..overly reacting to
trivial and petty things.

14
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,431
We usually call such
people fastidious.

15
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,891
But it is not fastidiousness,
it is actually an illness.

16
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,566
And if we add my love
story to this illness..

17
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:04,336
Why wait anymore? See for yourself.

18
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:08,025
Hey! That's his bike, not yours.

19
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:09,931
Let him wash it, sir.
He is doing a good job.

20
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,917
My bike usually gets
a wash in the rain.

21
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,256
This is the first time
it being properly washed.

22
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,067
If there's mud on your bike, wash it.
Why wash others' things?

23
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,269
My eyes see just the mud.

24
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,134
I don't care if it is on
my bike or somebody else's bike.

25
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,810
If my mind is disturbed,
I've to scrub things with detergent.

26
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,189
Just see what your
scrubbing did to my car.

27
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,175
I don't remember what
color it was when I bought it.

28
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,391
Do you remember the color?

29
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,526
Hey! Oh God!

30
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,134
Superb.

31
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:37,269
Now, you both can dry it off.

32
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:38,581
Dry it off?

33
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,837
Sir! My bag is muddy too.

34
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,986
This will wash it off, yeah.

35
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:57,730
That is bread.

36
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,514
I know. But I feel satisfied
if I dust it off before I eat it.

37
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,013
Be careful with the milk.
You might burn your tongue.

38
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:09,689
Sit straight.

39
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,662
Happy Valentine's Day!
- Same to you.

40
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:13,804
Take the flower.

41
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,815
No. If you want me to take it..

42
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,938
..first sanitize your
hands and wear gloves.

43
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,257
Anand, if you follow your
OCD rules to touch a girl..

44
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:24,236
..you will never
find love in your life.

45
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,393
That's okay.

46
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,204
I'm sure there is
a clean girl somewhere..

47
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,929
..who will impress me
and make me fall in love.

48
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:37,339
When I see that goddess,
my heart will react to her and..

49
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,015
..it will make my mind accept her.

50
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:40,950
Huh?

51
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,760
Anand! Anand! Anand!

52
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,268
Anand! It is a great sin to reject..

53
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,992
..food or flowers
that are offered to you.

54
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,296
I've been in love with
you for the past six months.

55
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,264
You are not at all interested in me.

56
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,534
I've studied your character.

57
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,042
It is very difficult to
find the girl of your dreams.

58
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:07,901
Even if you do find her,
your behavior will chase her away.

59
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:10,756
So.. Don't reject my love.

60
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,804
Please, accept me.

61
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,258
Hey, don't touch. Distance.

62
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,761
Okay.
- What were you saying?

63
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,917
Yes, if I find the girl of my dreams..

64
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,993
..I know how to woo her.

65
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:24,917
Okay? You can go.

66
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:26,798
Anand, please.
- Go.

67
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,886
Watch where you are going.

68
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:43,586
Watch this.

69
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:46,429
Control.

70
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,353
Look how it stretches.

71
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,672
Why did you place a shoe in the plate?

72
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,564
Why did you spit gum on the path?

73
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,326
Clean my shoe.

74
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:22,958
How can you be so sure that it was me?

75
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:25,585
How can you be so sure?
- You spit it out. I saw it.

76
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,154
Don't you have any other work to do?

77
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,527
This is my work.

78
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,468
Prove that this gum belongs to me.
Then, I will clean it.

79
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,198
He can't do it. He is trapped.

80
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,695
Okay. I will send the shoe to the lab.

81
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,117
If the saliva on the gum
is a match with your saliva..

82
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,399
..I will file a case in
the court and send you to prison.

83
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,226
Court?
What is saliva?

84
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,547
Spit.

85
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:47,666
Great man! Will you ruin
my life for a silly mistake?

86
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:49,136
Wait a minute. I will remove it.

87
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,551
Tissue! Tissue!
Tissue! Use a tissue, you idiot!

88
00:09:58,962 --> 00:09:59,827
Sorry.

89
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,372
Who wants your sorry?

90
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,113
Look there!

91
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,751
Small children are cleaning
the roads for a 'Clean India.'

92
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:14,097
But idiots like you are
still littering the roads.

93
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,286
Neatness should be in your heart..

94
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,005
..not in the clothes you wear.

95
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,329
We should have the
sense to keep ourselves..

96
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,648
..and our surroundings clean.
Understood?

97
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:30,215
Hello!

98
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:33,177
Your advice about
cleaning is impressive.

99
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,561
What's your name?

100
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:37,188
Meghana.

101
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:41,382
I instantly connected
with her because..

102
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:44,755
..she was as beautiful as her words.

103
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,739
Even though I was washing the tablet..

104
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,041
..my thoughts were on her.

105
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,560
That's a tablet.
It will melt in the water.

106
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,672
Aunt! Another emotion
has been added to his OCD.

107
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,672
You need to keep an eye on him.

108
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,191
I saw her again after two days.

109
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,656
She was eating an
ice-cream very neatly..

110
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,260
..and wiping her mouth
every now and then.

111
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,828
I fell for her once
again when I saw that.

112
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:28,893
Go.
- Sir!

113
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,234
Yes, sir.

114
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,807
He is Mr.
Anand. Your new project manager.

115
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,587
She is Meghana, from head office.

116
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,095
Hello!

117
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,160
Hey! What are you doing here?

118
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,868
You are..

119
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,955
Maybe you didn't recognize
me in these glasses.

120
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,533
Some guy spit gum on the path..

121
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,512
..it got stuck to your shoe,
I lectured him about saliva..

122
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:07,728
Right. You stood there
and asked me for my name..

123
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:08,895
..when I was leaving.

124
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:10,053
Exactly.

125
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,496
You turned around,
said your name is Meghana..

126
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:15,036
But you didn't stop there,
you came here..

127
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:18,096
..forcing me to hear your
silly story and pull my hair out..

128
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,085
Correct, sir.
- Shut up!

129
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,064
Sorry, sir.

130
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:23,302
I mean, I was excited to see her.

131
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:25,918
Do you need to show all
that excitement before me?

132
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,270
Can't you take this out?

133
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,956
I will do that. Please, come.

134
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:32,156
Wait. She came here
from the head office..

135
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,081
..to work on a project with you..

136
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,210
..not to discuss about
the gum stuck to your shoes..

137
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,578
..or the dung stuck to your hands.

138
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:42,307
Be serious in your office hours.
Take her. Please.

139
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,172
Please.
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:45,075
It's okay.
- I was with her that day.

141
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:46,801
You don't remember me?
- Yes, I remember.

142
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:48,639
We met in a strange way, didn't we?
- Yes.

143
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,032
Please, come.

144
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,962
I was scared to meet
my new project manager.

145
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,281
But I became really confident
after I saw that it was you.

146
00:12:58,475 --> 00:12:59,956
I still can't believe this.

147
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:02,886
That small chewing gum
has brought us together.

148
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,810
I didn't understand what you mean,
but I feel as if I do.

149
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,026
I think it's better if you remain so,
with half knowledge.

150
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,102
Sir?
- Just joking.

151
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,195
Let me see how long
these smiles will continue.

152
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,859
Until you burn with jealousy.

153
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,518
Who is she?
- Anita.

154
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,177
You bagged the project
that she wanted to do..

155
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:24,794
..so she is jealous.
- Oh dear! Why didn't you give it to her?

156
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,677
Everything is God's will.
He decides and we follow.

157
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:31,894
Anyway, thank you, sir.

158
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,417
Hmm?

159
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,213
Sir! Thank you!

160
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,590
She is a beautiful girl. Who is she?

161
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,871
She is Meghana.
She joined our office recently.

162
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:38,687
I see. Since she is new,
she doesn't your character yet.

163
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:39,871
What if she does?

164
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,881
If she does, you wouldn't
be seeing her photos like this.

165
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:44,362
You think my character is so bad?

166
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:48,113
No. Yours is a very good character.

167
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:50,308
But a girl won't be able
to bear so much goodness..

168
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,649
Hey!

169
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,211
It will be too much to bear.

170
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,805
Not at all.
She loves cleaning just like me.

171
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,270
Really?
- Do you know how we met?

172
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:00,813
We became friends during the process..

173
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:03,342
..of cleaning a chewing
gum that was stuck to her shoe.

174
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,704
A chewing gum stuck to her shoe?
Disgusting!

175
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,877
Is that how your love story started?

176
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:13,050
Stop being mean.
I like her. Now she has to like me.

177
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,731
Really? Do you know something?
That is a big hurdle.

178
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,634
Why? Why?

179
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,704
I will tell you. This is
the time where I walk and talk.

180
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,493
Layla Sujatha in 10th class.

181
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:26,272
A young girl who used
to sit beside you in class.

182
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,456
In the winter season,
when she had sinus..

183
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,510
..she blew her nose like this..
- Hey!

184
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,618
I didn't blow my nose.
I just pretended to.

185
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,956
You avoided her and ran off.
Do you remember that?

186
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,431
No, I don't remember.
- You won't.

187
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,810
Our neighbor Padma
in the Intermediate.

188
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,049
You gave her a greeting
card and said 'I love you' to her.

189
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,191
But the card slipped from
her hand and fell in the gutter.

190
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:46,391
Since you gave it to
her with so much love..

191
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:47,547
..she removed it out with her hand.

192
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:49,180
You were disgusted
with her and ran away.

193
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,925
You ran away from girls even
in the beginning stages of OCD.

194
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:55,892
And now you are in
the Ph.D stage of your OCD.

195
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,784
How will they love you? How?

196
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,914
Okay. Suppose,
just suppose that unfortunately..

197
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,260
..a girl falls for
your beautiful face..

198
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:07,049
..she will hate you when
she finds out about your OCD.

199
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,994
It's a fact. Donald Duck.

200
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,345
Hey!

201
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,216
I have a toothpick.

202
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,675
Okay.

203
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,968
I don't care what you think,
she and I are compatible.

204
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,006
She will definitely like me.

205
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,541
I will bring her home in one month..

206
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,671
..to take mom's blessings.
Wait and watch.

207
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,362
Yes. Stick to that decision, son.
All the best!

208
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:24,325
Thanks, mom.

209
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:25,827
Move aside.

210
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,319
I was very confident before Kishore..

211
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,481
..but what if she doesn't like me?

212
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,789
Don't know.
I opened the tap in the washroom..

213
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:42,778
..while thinking about her..

214
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,363
What if somebody
comes to the washroom?

215
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:57,363
Oh my God!

216
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,568
Yeah, you are right.

217
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:02,822
Meghana!
- Yes?

218
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,455
There is no water in the washroom.

219
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:05,860
If you want to use,
there's another one downstairs.

220
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,320
So sweet. Thank you.

221
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:14,119
But, how did he use it?
- Who?

222
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:20,119
How did he use it when
there is no water? That means..

223
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:20,855
Sir!
- Yes?

224
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:22,595
New applications. Please take a look.
- Forget them.

225
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,931
Why are your cheeks so red?

226
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,672
What are you using?
Won't you tell me? Pretty.

227
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:29,278
Do your work.

228
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,645
Hi, baby! How are you?

229
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:32,693
He is coming this way.

230
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,947
Hey, Anand! How are you, man?

231
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,040
Anand, any problem? Do you have fever?

232
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,104
Keep your hands away.
I will kill you if you touch me.

233
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,494
But why?
My hands are gold, dude. Come on!

234
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:42,823
Hey!

235
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:45,213
You tore the 'No Water'
signs and went inside.

236
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,315
There is no water,
tissues or soap inside.

237
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:51,202
Hands! Where did you wash your hands,
you idiot?

238
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:54,101
Why? Why wash my hands?

239
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,906
One hand,
two hands, just rub them together.

240
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,067
Bro! Boys should be rough and tough.

241
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,883
Hug me. You'll feel better.

242
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,126
No!

243
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:15,387
Oh God!

244
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:19,084
How dare you hit me!
Only one of us will remain here!

245
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,236
Get lost, you unclean fellow! Idiot!

246
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,593
Sorry, don't worry. Take it lightly.

247
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,604
What is this, sir?
Washing hands in the restroom.

248
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,257
Scrubbing with soap while bathing.

249
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,301
Urinating after checking
if there is water or not.

250
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,532
I have no such habits, sir.
I won't cultivate them.

251
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,137
What is this, sir?
Where did this tissue come from?

252
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:38,683
Did we have these when
we were children, sir?

253
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,905
Didn't we use our clothes as tissues?
- Yes.

254
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,126
It is a clean white paper, sir.

255
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,920
Just because our hands are wet..

256
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,996
..we use it to wipe them and throw it.
That's not our culture.

257
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,229
Sir, let me tell you this.
If I want to relieve myself..

258
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,663
..I do it before everyone.
I don't feel shy.

259
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,863
How can he raise his hand?

260
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:56,857
How can he punch me in the stomach?

261
00:20:56,937 --> 00:21:00,793
Stop it! Why are you
crying like a small kid?

262
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,724
Yes, sir.
- Look, Anand! He is your colleague.

263
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,529
You shouldn't punch
him in the stomach.

264
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:06,848
Say sorry to..

265
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:21,198
Where is he?
- Why will he be here? Look!

266
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,684
He went straight, took a left,
took a U turn and is near the exit.

267
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:24,927
You can sneeze now, sir.

268
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:27,543
You are the owner
of such a big company.

269
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:29,424
But he doesn't even
let you sneeze in peace.

270
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,370
He does not respect
you or your sneezes.

271
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,099
What is the use of this nose, sir?

272
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,143
Stop talking rubbish
and go do your work.

273
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:45,921
Meghana!

274
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:04,408
Why wouldn't she leave?
You gave her such a scare.

275
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:08,646
Not just her,
anybody would run away from you.

276
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:10,928
Excuse me.

277
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,252
The cab left. Can you drop me?

278
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,079
Thanks.

279
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:26,516
Let's go.

280
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,008
Thank you.

281
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:34,311
Seatbelt.. You already put it on.

282
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:40,526
Why did you control it?

283
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,970
I can stop the car aside and get down.
You can sneeze.

284
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,099
That's okay.

285
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:47,586
What? Do I look funny to you?

286
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,007
I just remembered what
you did in the office.

287
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:52,818
Why did you get so angry?

288
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,780
I had a reason to.
If anyone behaves irritatingly..

289
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,256
..or uncleanly before me,
my mind doesn't accept it.

290
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,655
I can't control my
reaction at that time.

291
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:04,060
I maintain good hygiene
and expect the same from others.

292
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,303
Is that wrong?

293
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,838
No, it's not wrong.

294
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:10,309
Thanks for understanding me.

295
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,887
What's there to understand?
You are a good man.

296
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:16,644
You like to be clean and neat.

297
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:20,006
And girls like clean men like you.

298
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:21,952
Really?

299
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:24,752
Didn't you ever love anyone?

300
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:29,627
I did. But I didn't tell her yet.

301
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:31,033
Then tell her.

302
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:36,470
But I have to find
out if she likes me or not.

303
00:23:36,643 --> 00:23:37,886
Why wouldn't she?

304
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:40,125
The moment you say
'I love you' to her..

305
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:42,200
..she will be on cloud nine.

306
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:45,087
I just found out.

307
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,012
Stop! Stop!

308
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:52,623
Do you want to sneeze?

309
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,504
We reached my apartment.

310
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,634
Oh.
- You are so funny.

311
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:58,007
Okay, then.

312
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:08,720
Bye.

313
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,612
Go.

314
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:16,050
Bye.

315
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:17,488
Bye.

316
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,425
Why are you so happy?

317
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:41,566
Did you wash a dirty
bus on your way home?

318
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,194
Or, did you scrub a stinking
toilet in a movie theater?

319
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:45,383
Tell me.

320
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,145
Meghana likes me.
- Oh God!

321
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:50,778
What's that expression?

322
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:53,047
You should be happy when
you hear something good.

323
00:24:53,934 --> 00:24:56,744
Ignore him. What did she say?

324
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:59,003
That's how I established
my character in the office today.

325
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,501
I thought she won't come
to me after what happened.

326
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,247
But she came to me,
got into my car, sat beside me..

327
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:06,992
..and spoke positively
about me saying that..

328
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,122
..any girl would jump
with joy if I propose to her.

329
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:11,554
Maybe her mental
condition is not good.

330
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:14,160
Ignore him.

331
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,917
Find a good time and
express your feelings to her.

332
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:17,987
What's the hurry, mom?

333
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,631
She is worried that
the girl will run away..

334
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,555
..if she gets to know you well.

335
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:25,426
Don't worry, mom.
Nobody can destroy our love.

336
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,518
Wonderful!

337
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,761
He won, sir! Come!

338
00:25:56,952 --> 00:25:58,401
Well done!
- Ramaraju sir!

339
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:00,605
It is difficult to
defeat your nephew Seenu..

340
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:04,043
..or take away your position
as the Village Head.

341
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:06,281
This time it will become
very clear to Bhupathi..

342
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:08,411
..that it is useless
to try again and again.

343
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:14,541
Be careful, son.
I'm worried about your safety.

344
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,585
I don't care about my safety, uncle.

345
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:19,503
You should be on the top.

346
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:24,616
He is a dynamite.

347
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:25,856
Throw it high!
- Separate them and tie them up.

348
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:29,326
Mom! I will become fat
if I eat sweets. I told you no.

349
00:26:29,662 --> 00:26:32,397
That's why we sent you
thick yoghurt and milk pudding.

350
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,160
Aunt! I will be tempted
to eat them if I see them.

351
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,002
I managed to lose 5 kilos
with great difficulty. Look at me.

352
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:40,278
Hi!

353
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:41,575
Hi, dad!

354
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:43,834
Happy birthday, darling!

355
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,196
Thank you, dad.

356
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,310
You've lost weight and look beautiful.
Your age is..

357
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,796
Didn't I tell you that I
will tell you when the time comes?

358
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,743
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?

359
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,867
You keep saying that
like a broken record.

360
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,964
But you will never agree
to get married. Never.

361
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,689
Alright, I'm getting late.
I'm leaving, bye. Okay?

362
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:01,878
Bye, mom. Bye, aunt.

363
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,828
Bye! Bye, sis!
- Bye!

364
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,580
Let's go.
- I'm getting hurt. Move aside.

365
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,137
She runs away when
we talk about her wedding.

366
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:09,931
I wonder when she
will get married and..

367
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:11,304
..bring me a son in law.

368
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:14,601
Happy birthday, Meghana.

369
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:15,855
Thank you.

370
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:16,969
How do you know?

371
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,850
When guys see the
CV's of beautiful girls..

372
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:21,077
..they notice their date
of birth and places of moles.

373
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:24,321
I haven't developed the habit
of looking at places of moles..

374
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:27,024
Hi, Meghana! Happy birthday!
- Stop! Step back.

375
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,107
Happy birthday! Happy?
- Very.

376
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:31,446
Hey, Meghana!
If you guess the gift inside..

377
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,240
..I'll gift you my one month's salary.

378
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,997
Are you doing this genuinely
or to create trouble?

379
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,505
Since she is placing
special emphasis on it..

380
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,343
..I'm sure it is an interesting item.

381
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,018
Any gold?

382
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,985
Not gold. But everything
in it is like gold to me.

383
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,034
Can I open it?

384
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:47,866
Yeah, please.

385
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:48,893
Hey!

386
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:50,591
Don't touch!

387
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,591
Pour two drops. I will wipe my hands
and then open the gift. Where's the bottle?

388
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:54,181
Don't!
- Relax.

389
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,386
Cool.
- Open it, Meghana.

390
00:27:58,466 --> 00:27:59,424
Superb.

391
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:07,771
Sanitizer, body butter,
body scrub, anti-bacterial soap..

392
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:09,047
..and loofah.

393
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,706
Every human being born in this world..

394
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,203
..needs these things
along with food and clothing.

395
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,863
So, I gift them for birthdays
and encourage cleanliness.

396
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,073
Oh.

397
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,203
How is my concept?

398
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,284
Superb.

399
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,500
Thank you.
- Hello! If you encourage him like this..

400
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,516
..we should name this
company OCD Solutions.

401
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:27,148
What is OCD?

402
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:28,846
I'll explain. It's a qualification.

403
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,278
A rare honor given to great persons.

404
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,348
I see.

405
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:34,143
So it is like an Oscar award.

406
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:35,267
Almost.

407
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,527
She is comparing OCD to Oscar.

408
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,365
Since she is fair,
I thought she is from Mumbai..

409
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:41,614
..but she is from a village.
She will fall for him easily.

410
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:43,581
Meghana!
- Hmm?

411
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:47,268
When you saw the gift,
I saw a spark in your eyes.

412
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:51,355
That means your heart
was touched with it.

413
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,496
So we should draw closer
to each other without any delay.

414
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:03,371
Mom! I'm hungry. Urgent.

415
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:04,938
Oh dear, he is here.

416
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:07,166
You should have clarity
along with cleanliness.

417
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,452
Are you hungry or
going out on urgent work?

418
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,571
My stomach is hungry but
my heart has an urgent work.

419
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:12,571
I'm planning to propose
to Meghana today.

420
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,690
Wow! All the best
to poor Meghana, bro!

421
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:15,976
Mom, hurry up!

422
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:18,582
Oh God! I'm coming. Don't trouble me.

423
00:33:19,934 --> 00:33:21,113
It is 8.42.

424
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:23,686
I wanted to make something
special for you but got late.

425
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:33,297
Mom! What are you doing?

426
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:34,530
Laxmi hasn't come yet.

427
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,216
I think she didn't
wash your plate and spoon.

428
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,859
I couldn't find them.
Anyway, I got a chance to feed you.

429
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,205
It's been a long time
since I fed you with my hands.

430
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:43,199
Mom!

431
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,961
Eat. My hands are clean.

432
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,972
Mom! We can't really see
if our hands are clean or not.

433
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,452
You came from the kitchen.

434
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,366
I'm sure your hands
have sweat and germs.

435
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:52,344
I will get an infection
if I eat this food.

436
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:53,792
Bring me bread and butter.

437
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:56,646
Hey! You are becoming
so obsessed with cleanliness.

438
00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:58,214
Since you don't eat anything
unless mom cooks it..

439
00:33:58,294 --> 00:34:00,355
..she got up early and cooked
for you though she is not well.

440
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,290
She is not well? What happened?

441
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,474
Nothing. You eat food.

442
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,625
She has viral fever
from the past two days.

443
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:07,857
Her fever is coming on and off.

444
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:09,792
She is managing with tablets because..

445
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:11,381
..she is scared that you
won't come to her if you find out.

446
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,738
Kishore, will you stop?

447
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,598
I'm fine now.
No fever. See for yourself.

448
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:21,349
Eat, my boy. You said you are hungry.

449
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,474
I cooked it for you because
you like it. Come on.

450
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:28,733
I don't want it, mom.

451
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:51,922
Hello!
- Hi, Meghana!

452
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,019
Hi!

453
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,392
I need to talk to you.

454
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:55,408
Sure.

455
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:57,246
It will be better
if we can talk in person.

456
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:59,137
Actually, I'm at the hospital.

457
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:04,391
Huh? At the hospital? Why?

458
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:07,320
Nothing.
My father has some health issues.

459
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,763
I came to the Citizen Hospital
to get his reports checked.

460
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:11,126
Citizen Hospital?

461
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,553
Yeah.
- Wait there.

462
00:35:12,888 --> 00:35:15,201
The doctor is here.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

463
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:16,705
Meghana! Hello!

464
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,985
What did you spray in my mouth?

465
00:36:04,284 --> 00:36:05,754
What's wrong with you?

466
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:07,937
What is that?

467
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:09,473
What happened? What?

468
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:13,375
Answer me.

469
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,186
Anand! What's the matter?

470
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,451
Wait!

471
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,656
Anand! What's the matter?

472
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,300
What's wrong? Why did you drag me out?

473
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,062
How can you sit so serenely
amidst all those patients..

474
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:32,521
..and play Candy Crush?

475
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,240
It just takes 10 seconds
for us to contract their diseases.

476
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:39,743
Diseases?

477
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,089
You being a health conscious girl,
why did you come..

478
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,954
..to the hospital without
taking any precautions?

479
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,765
What will I do if you fall sick?

480
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:54,262
Why are you so panicked? Why?

481
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,511
Why? Because I love you.

482
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:01,398
I have to protect you.
It is my responsibility, you know.

483
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,214
Love? Since when?

484
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,577
I didn't tell you, right?
I will tell you now.

485
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:14,338
I lost my heart to you
the first time I saw you.

486
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,171
When you joined office,
I felt as if you came for me.

487
00:37:17,604 --> 00:37:21,323
When you said you liked me,
I decided that you are mine.

488
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:29,378
I like you very much.
I can't bear the thought..

489
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,064
..that you are in danger.

490
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,346
I have only two persons in this world.

491
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,448
One is my mom,
and the other one is you.

492
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:45,302
I don't know a cleaner way to propose.

493
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,989
I'm expecting a
positive reply from you.

494
00:38:44,794 --> 00:38:45,864
Oh God!

495
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:51,833
Hi!
- Oh dear! It's you? I was so scared.

496
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:54,535
What's that, sir? It looks so strange.

497
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,448
We get allergies if we
inhale polluted air, right?

498
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,632
This air purifier stops that.

499
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,675
Wow! Can I use it?

500
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,502
I can't use it after you use it.

501
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:06,470
Okay, you both carry on. I'm going.

502
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:11,844
There is a lot to learn from you.

503
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,092
There is a lot to learn from you too.

504
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:16,048
Not responding when
a guy proposes to you.

505
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:17,551
Not answering phone calls.

506
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:19,465
Not replying to messages
even after reading them.

507
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,654
Innocently asking 'How are you?'..

508
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,211
..when you bump into
me as if nothing is wrong.

509
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,092
I will learn too.

510
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:27,789
Are you really serious?

511
00:39:27,994 --> 00:39:29,324
Serious?

512
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:32,902
When I do a work, I do it perfectly.

513
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:37,583
Not even 99.99 percent.
100 percent perfect.

514
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,497
Whether it is to love a girl,
or do something else.

515
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:41,929
I'm an OCD man, a quality man.

516
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:45,346
Once I touch a girl,
I'll give my life for her.

517
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:47,671
Do you want me to touch you?

518
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:48,590
Do you want some water?

519
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:51,985
No, no. Thanks. I want an answer.

520
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:56,147
Okay, then. Do your cycling.

521
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,076
Hey! Why are you leaving
without giving an answer?

522
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:00,968
Okay or no?

523
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:02,955
My father will decide that.

524
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,566
Where did he come
from all of a sudden?

525
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:06,997
He was right there from the beginning.

526
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,867
I will love the man he likes,
and marry the man he likes.

527
00:40:10,947 --> 00:40:12,316
But where can I meet him?

528
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,283
This afternoon at lunch.

529
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:16,046
Does he live here?

530
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:17,246
He is coming today.

531
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:18,749
What if he doesn't like me?

532
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:23,030
Hi, Anand!
How are you? Did you come for a walk?

533
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:26,597
Where is your machine? Put it on.

534
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,148
You inhaled a lot
of polluted air already.

535
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,931
I got it. Go ahead.

536
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:34,283
Bye.

537
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,028
My dad.

538
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,250
What? Why are they
dressed as villagers?

539
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,261
Patteseema is a village.

540
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:02,531
But you don't speak like that.

541
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:06,639
If I speak like that,
your city people will harass me. Yes.

542
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:08,953
I love you very much. Don't kill it.

543
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:12,088
Dad!

544
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,574
Sir! Son in law looks very handsome.

545
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:20,314
Hello, uncle!
- Hello!

546
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:23,016
Don't be so formal with older ones.
Shake his hand.

547
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:28,011
Our under tenant Bhadram.

548
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:30,465
Please, sit.

549
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:34,638
Come on, sir. Be careful.

550
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:43,978
Now tell me, uncle. How are you?

551
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:46,421
My daughter called me
in the middle of the night..

552
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,605
..and asked me to come
down to see the bridegroom.

553
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:50,810
I've been waiting for
so long to hear those words.

554
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:54,216
So I immediately hired
a car and came here.

555
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:08,064
She told me that
your father passed away.

556
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:14,572
What does your mother do?

557
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:17,339
Are you her only son,
or do you have any siblings?

558
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:18,345
Actually..

559
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:20,853
What is this? Why are
you slapping this on your hand?

560
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:22,463
That's a sanitizer.

561
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:23,814
A perfume?

562
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,430
If you use it after giving
a handshake, it smells nice.

563
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,663
Oh.
- But it's over.

564
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:29,349
Maybe I used it too much today.

565
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:31,922
One second, uncle.

566
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:34,105
One second, Meghana.
I will be right back.

567
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,975
Should I come with you?
- No. Sit right there.

568
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:37,739
We should take a couple
of these while going home.

569
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:46,116
Excuse me.

570
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,165
Close the tap.

571
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:51,879
Hi, uncle! Now I'm free.
Now you can ask me, uncle.

572
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:54,224
I will answer your questions.

573
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:54,959
Actually..
- Food, sir.

574
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,884
Food is here.
- Keep it on the table carefully.

575
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,760
Looking at your face,
I knew you would spill something.

576
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:05,830
Clean it quickly.

577
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,517
Sorry, sir. I will clean it right now.

578
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,063
Shall we talk?

579
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:14,339
Yeah, sure. Why not? Let's talk.

580
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,890
What does your mother do?

581
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,814
Where do you live?
Do you have any siblings?

582
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:33,420
Son!
- Yes, uncle.

583
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:34,576
Are you listening to me?

584
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:36,997
Of course.
Where does your mother live?

585
00:43:37,077 --> 00:43:38,614
What does my house do?
That's what you asked me, right?

586
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:41,315
No, not that.
My sir asked you about your mother..

587
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:44,321
You worthless idiot!
Hurry up! I can't bear to see this.

588
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:45,521
I'm coming, sir.

589
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,490
Sorry, uncle.
My mind doesn't work properly..

590
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:58,064
..if I see something
that is not neat and clean.

591
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:00,540
I start getting irritated about it.

592
00:44:02,216 --> 00:44:03,492
Now tell me, uncle.

593
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:06,292
I'm hungry.
Shall we talk after eating food?

594
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:10,345
Oh. Uncle is hungry. Let's eat uncle.

595
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:39,720
"Who was it that
carried you as a child?"

596
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,412
"Which mother gave birth
to this powerful bull?"

597
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,343
"No one has seen someone
like him before."

598
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:51,688
Continue, uncle.
Neatly. Eat neatly, uncle.

599
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:56,288
"Once there was a sky,
there was a cloud in the sky.."

600
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:57,849
"..there was a tune
behind the cloud.."

601
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,363
"..and that tune
dissolved the heavens.."

602
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:02,120
"..you should become the parrot.."

603
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:04,563
"..you should tell your dad."

604
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:08,557
Why are you singing these songs?

605
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:11,421
Ask him to clean his face.
I can't see it anymore.

606
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:15,075
I will die.
Please, ask him to clean his face.

607
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:18,177
Ask him to clean his face.
I can't see it, please.

608
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,339
Use a tissue. Use a tissue.

609
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:21,604
You idiot!

610
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,112
Use this tissue, please.

611
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:25,193
Done.

612
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:27,323
Now eat, sir.

613
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:28,869
Control.

614
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:38,047
You still have a rice grain, uncle.
Take this.

615
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:44,243
No, no, no. Throw it here.

616
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,015
Now eat.

617
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:53,344
Thanks for your cooperation, uncle.
Some chicken?

618
00:45:55,311 --> 00:45:59,171
No? Okay.
It is 'Dum Biryani.' Did you like it?

619
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:09,441
Dear! He is good.
A perfect match for you.

620
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:10,457
Thank you, uncle.

621
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:11,895
But you can't marry him.

622
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,647
Why not, dad?

623
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,782
Dear, it is very difficult
to deal with his over cleanliness.

624
00:46:16,998 --> 00:46:18,274
Do we need this?

625
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,339
Dad, I told you.
He is a little high-class.

626
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,160
Once he gets used to us,
he will become one of us.

627
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,354
Once he loves us,
he will give his life for you.

628
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,230
She didn't tell me this,
uncle. Really?

629
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,506
Hmm.

630
00:46:31,586 --> 00:46:35,214
Dear! He didn't even
let me eat my food in peace.

631
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:37,376
How will you spend your life with him?

632
00:46:37,636 --> 00:46:42,381
Dad, I said I like him. Please.

633
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:46,090
She is so adorable.
Give her to me, uncle. Please, uncle.

634
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,095
Then marry her.

635
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:48,511
Thank you, uncle. Thank you..

636
00:46:48,591 --> 00:46:50,435
Why do you ask me? Why call me here?

637
00:46:50,515 --> 00:46:51,721
Dad!
- Uncle! - Bhadram, let's go.

638
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,030
Dad!
- Sir!

639
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:57,711
Give that to me.

640
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:02,783
Dad!

641
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:05,691
Sir! Sir! Sir! I'm hungry, sir!
- Get lost!

642
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:07,845
Sir! Sir! Sir! I'm hungry, sir!

643
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:10,850
Dad!
- Hey! My bag!

644
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,202
Oh dear!

645
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,088
I will bring it back.

646
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:31,174
Hey, stop!

647
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:48,752
Hey go!

648
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,661
Madam! Will you stop for a minute?

649
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,763
Don't you get it? I asked you to stop!

650
00:48:02,904 --> 00:48:04,601
Boss!
- Yes. Give it to me.

651
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,860
Hey!

652
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,848
He stole it in ignorance.

653
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,789
You don't commit a crime knowingly.
Give it to me.

654
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,280
What is that look?
You are the one who stole it!

655
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,588
Give it to me!

656
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:21,913
Don't keep the bag inside! No!

657
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,334
If you have the guts, take it from me.

658
00:48:30,713 --> 00:48:34,540
I don't have the courage
to touch this dirty body. No.

659
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:36,561
Give the bag to me. Come on, give it.

660
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:39,048
You are talking too much!

661
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,767
If you want the bag,
put your hand inside..

662
00:48:40,847 --> 00:48:42,139
..boss's vest and take it.

663
00:48:42,475 --> 00:48:44,583
You are expecting too much from me.

664
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:51,524
Why are you sitting
in oil and eating food like?

665
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,437
Does it look like a star hotel to you?

666
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,119
Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Take it. Take it.

667
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,394
Stay away. Stay away.

668
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,449
When was the last time you had a bath?
You stink.

669
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:04,044
You will die.
And I will die if I breathe that air.

670
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:04,747
Really?

671
00:49:04,827 --> 00:49:06,055
If it wasn't my bag,
I would've just left it here..

672
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:07,590
..no matter how much
money was inside it.

673
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,644
Give it to me. Give it to me.

674
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:14,279
Give me a tissue.

675
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:24,906
Why would you have tissues?
I'm a fool to think so.

676
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,409
Give me the bag.

677
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:27,922
Catch!

678
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:31,338
Kill him!

679
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:10,632
Why are you dancing?

680
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,616
Dancing doesn't suit you.

681
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:21,917
You ate food. Now you'll
fight without washing your hand?

682
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,907
Did you come from a jungle,
you buffalo?

683
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:25,053
Sorry, sir.

684
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,313
Hey! Oh God!

685
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:35,616
Hello!

686
00:51:46,988 --> 00:51:49,161
Get a TT injection,
it won't turn septic.

687
00:51:51,658 --> 00:51:53,529
Uncle, I don't drink or smoke..

688
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,194
..so you have no reason
to be afraid to give me your girl.

689
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:57,485
I just have this good
habit of cleanliness.

690
00:52:02,479 --> 00:52:06,046
Uncle, I take very
good care of my things.

691
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:08,857
So, imagine how I will
treat the girl I love.

692
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:26,359
Dear, do you think
he is right for you?

693
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:27,667
Hundred percent, dad.

694
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,596
I promise. He is a very good man.

695
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:34,282
You can't find another
man like him for me.

696
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:37,526
Really? Don't you think
you are exaggerating?

697
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:38,671
Really, dad.

698
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:44,855
Okay, you know him
better than me. I agree.

699
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,239
But if you both have any differences..

700
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,320
We won't. I'm telling you.

701
00:52:52,153 --> 00:52:55,504
No, dear. You are my only daughter.

702
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:57,483
If I don't find a good son in law..

703
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,753
..nobody will respect
me in the village. So..

704
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:04,564
Dad, he will bring you honor,
not disgrace. I guarantee it.

705
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,662
Enough. Don't praise him so much.

706
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,759
Where is he now?

707
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,062
He is waiting outside.

708
00:53:15,505 --> 00:53:16,661
Thank you.

709
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:24,185
What is that look,
as if you achieved something great?

710
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:27,439
My dad liked you.

711
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,525
Really?
- Yes. He asked you to come inside.

712
00:53:31,605 --> 00:53:33,558
Darling..
- Wait a minute.

713
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:35,350
Looks like you are very happy.

714
00:53:35,576 --> 00:53:37,382
How can I not hug you
after giving me such good news?

715
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:38,647
Come, hug me.

716
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:41,393
Wow, you are too forward.

717
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,641
Here? On the road?

718
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:45,425
Oh, you don't want it here?
Let's go aside.

719
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,614
Anand!

720
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,522
Your behavior is
always on the extremes.

721
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:51,414
You don't touch someone
if you don't like them.

722
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,349
But you get stuck
to them if you like them.

723
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:55,317
I feel uncomfortable. Leave me.

724
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:59,176
But I feel very good.
I feel all tingly inside.

725
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:02,148
Stop there.
My dad agreed to our wedding only.

726
00:54:02,228 --> 00:54:03,565
You just have to agree to one kiss.

727
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:04,624
A kiss?
- Yes.

728
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:05,749
Oh God!

729
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:07,090
Why are you worried when I'm not?

730
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,614
Give me just one kiss,
for safekeeping.

731
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:11,143
No way. What if somebody
comes in suddenly?

732
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:13,932
Is it okay if nobody comes?

733
00:54:14,012 --> 00:54:14,948
What if they come?

734
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:17,954
So let's finish it
before they come. Kiss me.

735
00:54:18,224 --> 00:54:21,164
I want to kiss you, but..

736
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:28,819
No buts, let's do it.
This will be my first kiss.

737
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:32,257
I see. Do you think
this is my hundredth kiss?

738
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,919
Come on, please. One kiss.

739
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:38,406
Okay, okay.
I feel shy. I will close my eyes.

740
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:39,606
Okay.

741
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:44,914
Did you brush?
- Huh?

742
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:50,898
I mean, it is hygienic
if you brush twice a day.

743
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:52,628
That's why I asked.

744
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:54,736
I didn't brush.
So, you won't kiss me now?

745
00:54:57,537 --> 00:55:01,515
Hey.. Hey.. Meghana..

746
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,764
Hey, my dad is waiting for us.
Come on, let's go.

747
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:11,667
Come on.

748
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,564
What is your problem? Stop it.

749
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,785
Thanks, uncle. I didn't expect
that you will agree so quickly.

750
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,483
I always fulfill
my daughter's desires.

751
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:27,283
I didn't want to say no to you.

752
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:31,725
Moreover, you cleared
all my doubts with your fight.

753
00:58:31,932 --> 00:58:34,137
Do you like fights so much, uncle?

754
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,142
Be serious when discussing
something serious.

755
00:58:37,478 --> 00:58:39,153
Oh. Sorry, uncle.

756
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:43,067
Marrying my daughter means
sharing my responsibilities.

757
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,916
You have to carry my
honor on your shoulders.

758
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:47,153
Not just in kilos and quintals, uncle.
I will carry tons of it.

759
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:49,813
Can I say something?

760
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:52,147
From today I won't feel
that I don't have a father..

761
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:53,531
..because I have you.

762
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,418
See me as your son, not a son in law.

763
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:57,845
I will become one of you.

764
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:01,726
That's it, son.
You won me over with your words.

765
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:05,185
Uncle, you said I didn't
allow you to eat a meal in peace.

766
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,915
Come on, I'll keep
you good company this time.

767
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:08,883
Meghana, serve dinner.

768
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,645
Let's go.

769
00:59:11,705 --> 00:59:12,775
Stop that right now.

770
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:15,802
Yes. Son in law is very funny.

771
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:24,613
What is today's special?

772
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:28,959
Do you have a generator?

773
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:51,510
Uncle!

774
00:59:51,802 --> 00:59:52,926
Meghana!

775
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:54,754
Uncle!

776
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:59,803
Sir!

777
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:01,664
Dad!
- Meghana!

778
01:00:01,744 --> 01:00:04,021
Dad! Dad!

779
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,253
Sir!

780
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:08,583
Dad! Dad!

781
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:20,095
Hello! Hello, doctor!

782
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:48,063
Anand!

783
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:49,857
Yes, Meghana?

784
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:51,825
Let's take him to the hospital.

785
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:04,669
Dear..

786
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:06,496
Dad, nothing will happen to you.

787
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:18,076
Anand, drive faster.

788
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:58,432
Nothing will happen to you, dad.

789
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:19,685
Anand, what happened to you?

790
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:31,199
I can't.

791
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:43,523
I can't bear it.

792
01:02:46,756 --> 01:02:50,323
My hands.. My hands.. I can't drive.

793
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:51,707
I can't..

794
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,275
Oh God!

795
01:03:00,983 --> 01:03:04,734
Meghana, when I see blood..

796
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:09,707
I feel sick sitting in that seat,
Meghana.

797
01:03:10,615 --> 01:03:14,410
I can't do it.
Understand me, Meghana. Please..

798
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:16,518
I stay away from my
mother when she has fever.

799
01:03:16,598 --> 01:03:19,416
And your father is.. I will call..
I will call a cab for you.

800
01:03:19,772 --> 01:03:28,108
My phone..
My phone.. I will call a cab.

801
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,864
But I can't drive it, Meghana.

802
01:03:31,729 --> 01:03:33,642
I will die if I drive that car.

803
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:35,221
Meghana, you know me, don't you?

804
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:36,324
Meghana, say something.

805
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,659
Say something, Meghana.
I love you, Meghana.

806
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,379
I'm not doing it on purpose..
- Madam! He is not moving.

807
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:46,422
He will be okay. He will be alright.

808
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:49,147
I will stop a car. I will bring a car.

809
01:03:50,919 --> 01:03:52,649
Stop! Stop!

810
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:58,119
Auto! Auto! Auto!

811
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:03,937
Sir! My uncle vomited blood.

812
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:06,358
We need to take him to the hospital.
Please, sir.

813
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:11,569
Sir, please!
Sir, please, sir! Sir, please! Please!

814
01:04:45,709 --> 01:04:47,688
How is he now? Is he out of danger?

815
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:49,299
Did they say they will
send him home after doing tests?

816
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,029
I will say that if that's
what you want to hear.

817
01:04:52,012 --> 01:04:53,710
I will tell the truth if
you want to know what happened.

818
01:04:54,585 --> 01:04:55,677
If you had shown this
concern last night..

819
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,319
..he wouldn't be in
this critical condition.

820
01:04:57,568 --> 01:04:59,104
She took him to the hospital
in the nick of time..

821
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:00,456
..and saved his life
by getting the surgery done.

822
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:03,990
Otherwise, they would have
taken his body to the village.

823
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:12,531
What's the use of
regretting your actions now?

824
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,066
You should've thought about
it before leaving a girl..

825
01:05:14,146 --> 01:05:15,407
..in the middle of
the road at midnight.

826
01:05:16,488 --> 01:05:19,385
Thank God for saving his life.

827
01:05:19,569 --> 01:05:20,921
What if something
were to happen to him?

828
01:05:21,256 --> 01:05:23,396
She would have become
a fatherless child.

829
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:24,888
Because of you.

830
01:05:28,618 --> 01:05:31,040
You know how painful it
is to live without a father.

831
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,499
You love her,
how could you leave her father to die?

832
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:36,542
Is that the value
of his life in your eyes?

833
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,974
Anand, one second.

834
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,304
Madam, did you check it?
Is the money transferred?

835
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:09,882
Yes.
- Keep the bill ready. Thank you.

836
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,434
What? Why did you enter
the hospital without..

837
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:14,153
..taking precautions?

838
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:16,045
There are patients here. Come on!

839
01:06:24,174 --> 01:06:25,223
Sorry, Meghana.

840
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,704
What for? You did nothing wrong.

841
01:06:29,266 --> 01:06:33,115
I did a mistake by loving
you before knowing you well.

842
01:06:33,548 --> 01:06:34,877
You know that I'm sensitive, Meghana.

843
01:06:35,094 --> 01:06:37,148
I didn't know. I really didn't know.

844
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,472
I really didn't know that
you view people as things and..

845
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:42,801
..that you stay away from
your mom when she is sick.

846
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:46,197
A girl wishes to be with a man..

847
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:48,121
..who will lovingly
take her into his arms.

848
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:50,780
Not with a coward
like you who runs away..

849
01:06:51,018 --> 01:06:53,612
..from people because he
is scared of their illnesses.

850
01:06:53,692 --> 01:06:56,834
Since you have OCD,
you shouldn't expect love..

851
01:06:56,914 --> 01:06:59,613
..from people like us.
You shouldn't love us.

852
01:07:01,591 --> 01:07:06,596
It is better to fail in love
than to marry you and fail in life.

853
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:10,477
Go away. Never disturb me again.

854
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:14,282
Do you remember?

855
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,515
You confessed your
feelings for me right here.

856
01:07:18,823 --> 01:07:21,277
Now I'm breaking-up
with you in the same place.

857
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:25,624
We found love here,
so leave it right here.

858
01:08:11,775 --> 01:08:14,510
Brother! Bhupathi deceived us.

859
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:17,104
He bribed Seenu to be on his side now.

860
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:23,861
Seenu! Why did you
play for your village?

861
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:25,515
Why did you help your uncle to win?

862
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:28,726
Because you thought he
will give his daughter to you.

863
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:30,639
But what did your uncle do?

864
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,136
He went to the city
without informing anyone.

865
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:35,418
When that girl said that
she loves someone in the office..

866
01:08:35,498 --> 01:08:38,910
..instead of scolding her
and forcing her to marry you..

867
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:40,618
..instead of putting
an end to her love story..

868
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:42,607
..he fixed her marriage
with that city man.

869
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:44,888
That is such a horrible thing to do.
Such betrayal.

870
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:47,201
Oh God! We, your enemies..

871
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:49,158
..even we can't process
this injustice towards you.

872
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:52,585
You are his nephew,
the one who was supposed to..

873
01:08:52,665 --> 01:08:54,314
..marry his daughter,
I can't imagine what you are feeling.

874
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,806
Play for our village this time..

875
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,741
..and help me to
become the Village Head.

876
01:09:01,936 --> 01:09:04,314
I will get you married to
a girl more beautiful than her..

877
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:07,168
..and gift you a big car.

878
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:16,898
Dad?

879
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,466
What's wrong?
- Dad?

880
01:09:18,546 --> 01:09:19,525
Doctor!
- Doctor!

881
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,677
Move aside.

882
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:22,779
Doctor, please see.

883
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:23,990
What are you doing?

884
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,953
Uncle, relax.
You will be fine. Just relax.

885
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:28,909
Aunt, calm down. Don't scare him.

886
01:09:28,989 --> 01:09:30,314
Uncle, breathe in.

887
01:09:31,136 --> 01:09:35,623
He will be alright. Aunt, don't worry.

888
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,926
What are you doing?
Do you think he is a normal man?

889
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:44,131
Why are you discussing
our village disputes with him?

890
01:09:44,943 --> 01:09:47,570
Uncle, don't excite yourself,
or you will be in danger.

891
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,851
Forget all your tensions
and be happy for a few days.

892
01:09:50,056 --> 01:09:51,818
If you think someone makes you happy..

893
01:09:51,898 --> 01:09:53,537
..spend more time with them.

894
01:09:54,564 --> 01:09:56,337
Meghana, take care of him.

895
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:58,185
Come on, let's go out.
- Dad!

896
01:09:58,414 --> 01:10:01,506
Dear, call up son in
law and ask him to come here.

897
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,317
Why call Anand now? Just relax.

898
01:10:05,517 --> 01:10:08,154
My own nephew betrayed me.

899
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:10,944
But, though Anand
is not related to us..

900
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:14,165
..he is so concerned about us.

901
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:17,743
He brought me here in
the nick of time and saved me..

902
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:19,160
..like my own son.

903
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,992
Call him, dear.

904
01:10:22,072 --> 01:10:23,527
Why, dad?

905
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:29,170
I won't be in peace until
I talk to him for a few minutes.

906
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,853
Dad..
- Call him, dear.

907
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,565
What are you waiting for, dear?
Call him up.

908
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:37,186
Or, you go and bring him.

909
01:10:50,235 --> 01:10:51,932
Why do you look so forlorn, Anand?

910
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:55,155
I expected that something
like this would happen..

911
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:56,668
..that's why I warned
you right in the beginning.

912
01:10:56,906 --> 01:10:58,138
Look what happened now.

913
01:10:58,441 --> 01:11:00,300
You fell in love,
but you failed miserably.

914
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,225
Anyway, forget that now.

915
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:05,674
And there are lot
more fish in the pond.

916
01:11:06,507 --> 01:11:08,096
Just say yes to me.

917
01:11:09,113 --> 01:11:12,518
I'll happily sit in your
lap and make her jealous.

918
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:16,962
I'll smooch you and
make her burn with envy.

919
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,935
Excuse me.

920
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:24,356
I need to talk to you.

921
01:11:24,756 --> 01:11:25,870
Go ahead.

922
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:27,362
In private.

923
01:11:28,475 --> 01:11:29,697
Let's go.

924
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,021
Hey, sit down.

925
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:38,735
I didn't.. Sorry..
I'm not here to sit and chat with you.

926
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,902
Okay. Keep standing then.

927
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:45,957
I never imagined that
I've to meet you again.

928
01:11:46,037 --> 01:11:48,605
Life is all about
unexpected things. Right?

929
01:11:48,685 --> 01:11:50,173
Don't talk rubbish. I'm upset.

930
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:52,519
I don't have the patience
to fight with you.

931
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:55,124
Same here.
It's been a week since I ate food.

932
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:57,308
I lost 2 kilos. You can check
my fitness watch if you want.

933
01:11:57,388 --> 01:11:58,551
It will show you how much I walked,
how much I slept..

934
01:11:58,631 --> 01:11:59,589
Stop it!

935
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:01,891
I didn't come here to
gather your health information.

936
01:12:01,971 --> 01:12:04,767
You forgot be formal with me again.
Is that okay?

937
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:07,967
Whatever! Let me talk!

938
01:12:09,145 --> 01:12:10,139
Talk.

939
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:12,420
I didn't tell my dad about you.

940
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,162
That you got down from
the car all of a sudden..

941
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:17,113
..that you vomited on
the way to the hospital..

942
01:12:17,193 --> 01:12:19,080
..that you are not the
person that you appear to be..

943
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,761
..that you have a dangerous
OCD man inside you..

944
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,242
..I didn't tell dad
any of these things.

945
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,799
Thanks.
- Thanks? For what?

946
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,063
You wouldn't have done
that if you didn't love me.

947
01:12:30,247 --> 01:12:33,804
I love dad, not you.
I'm afraid that his condition..

948
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,112
..will worsen if I tell him about you.

949
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:39,371
Yes.

950
01:12:39,641 --> 01:12:41,079
I didn't want him to
feel sad that his daughter..

951
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:45,490
..chose a wrong man to love,
so I didn't tell him.

952
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:47,382
Hello!

953
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:49,307
Anand!
- Yes?

954
01:12:49,387 --> 01:12:51,501
What's wrong with you?
Who are you looking at..

955
01:12:51,581 --> 01:12:53,026
..when I'm talking
something serious with you?

956
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:57,048
His behavior is a bit disturbing.
Just a second.

957
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:01,741
Okay, alright.

958
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:02,801
What are you doing? What is this?

959
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:04,974
Do you realize what you are doing?

960
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:08,639
Tuck it in. Tuck it in.
- Tuck it?

961
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,725
Tuck it in.
It is so disgusting to look at.

962
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,379
Tuck it in. Tuck it in.

963
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:14,076
Remain like this.

964
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,806
I will go aside and scratch myself.

965
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:18,800
Sorry. Don't look at me like that.

966
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:20,508
You know that if something
is not clean and neat..

967
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:24,756
Stop your OCD lecture.
I just want to say one thing.

968
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,707
Come and talk to my dad
and get out of our lives forever.

969
01:13:27,989 --> 01:13:30,757
Don't make me meet you
and endure this torture again.

970
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:32,854
One more thing.

971
01:13:33,049 --> 01:13:35,244
Your mind got disturbed
looking at that man's actions.

972
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:38,790
My mind gets disturbed
when I look at you. Understood?

973
01:13:39,568 --> 01:13:40,562
Understood.

974
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,119
What did you understand?

975
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:44,984
I think you have OCD too.

976
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:46,562
Oh God!

977
01:13:47,384 --> 01:13:50,238
Uncle is waiting for us.
Let's go. Hurry up.

978
01:13:52,769 --> 01:13:53,839
Dad, Anand is here.

979
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,477
Hi, uncle!
- Oh, you are here.

980
01:13:57,014 --> 01:14:01,068
Is it enough if you bring
me safely and admit here?

981
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:03,532
Or, is it enough if
you get the surgery done?

982
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:09,306
What was that sound?

983
01:14:10,268 --> 01:14:11,338
Sound?

984
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:16,873
Maybe it was the fan,
or the computer..

985
01:14:17,424 --> 01:14:18,905
..or that AC. Am I right?

986
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:24,440
Okay. Why didn't you come
to see me after I woke up?

987
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:25,911
How can you ignore me like this?

988
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,851
I didn't ignore you, uncle.
I came after the surgery..

989
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,024
..but the hospital staff
gave me a scolding and sent me away.

990
01:14:31,104 --> 01:14:32,365
How can they interfere in it?

991
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:35,932
They can't weaken or break
the bond between us, right?

992
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:38,051
They don't have that sense, uncle.

993
01:14:39,089 --> 01:14:40,667
Why didn't you inform them, dear..

994
01:14:40,747 --> 01:14:42,980
..that he is your
fiancé and my son in law?

995
01:14:43,196 --> 01:14:44,926
Dad, no use fretting about it now.

996
01:14:45,006 --> 01:14:46,645
Say what you want to
say to him and send him home.

997
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,714
Son, I need to talk to you.

998
01:14:49,909 --> 01:14:51,585
Come on, uncle.
We can sit in the lawn and talk.

999
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:52,785
He is a patient.

1000
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:54,796
I know. I know that.
- Then?

1001
01:14:55,149 --> 01:14:56,965
The air here is polluted.

1002
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:59,451
Uncle, don't you feel
a bit suffocated here?

1003
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:00,587
A bit?

1004
01:15:01,257 --> 01:15:02,976
You feel it. You feel it.

1005
01:15:03,056 --> 01:15:05,516
Yes, I feel a bit breathless. Let's go.
- Please.

1006
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:07,508
I will feel better
if I unburden my heart..

1007
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,000
..while breathing in fresh air.

1008
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,643
Go ahead, uncle.
I'll join you in a minute.

1009
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,627
Hello! This is a hospital.

1010
01:15:13,994 --> 01:15:17,032
You can't apply oil anywhere you want.
Stupid fellow.

1011
01:15:18,145 --> 01:15:20,826
You tell me.
I've raised him as my own son.

1012
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:23,140
How can he leave because
I didn't give him my daughter?

1013
01:15:24,805 --> 01:15:27,745
Can't I get her married
to the man she loves?

1014
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:29,940
You can do that, uncle.
Who will stop you?

1015
01:15:30,232 --> 01:15:33,767
Uncle.. Instead of worrying
about the one who left you..

1016
01:15:33,847 --> 01:15:35,691
..embrace the one who
loves you and take him home.

1017
01:15:35,771 --> 01:15:36,740
He will bring comfort to you like me.

1018
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:40,664
Hello! Don't act smart.
Just talk about dad.

1019
01:15:40,923 --> 01:15:44,804
Yes. I just linked the
topic to us too. Calm down.

1020
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:49,432
Uncle, don't think about
your nephew and be depressed.

1021
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:51,378
First think about winning
that wrestling competition.

1022
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,816
You will definitely win it.

1023
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,416
Uncle, you know something?

1024
01:15:54,621 --> 01:15:55,854
A great man once said
that when you really desire..

1025
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:56,902
..something from the heart..

1026
01:15:57,129 --> 01:16:00,438
..the whole universe
will help you to achieve it.

1027
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:04,394
If you follow it, everything
will fall in place. Right, Meghana?

1028
01:16:05,432 --> 01:16:08,492
If we really desire
something from the heart..

1029
01:16:08,572 --> 01:16:10,491
..it will happen. Am I right?

1030
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:12,264
Yes.

1031
01:16:12,344 --> 01:16:13,843
Why do you look doubtful, dear?

1032
01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:17,799
Anand is right.
He reminded me of the determination..

1033
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:19,345
..I had as a 25 year old man.

1034
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:21,107
That's it. Be positive, uncle.

1035
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:23,485
If you are happy,
your health will improve.

1036
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:26,534
Anand! If you are with me..

1037
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,994
..I feel as if I have the
strength of 1,000 elephants.

1038
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:33,356
Will you come to my village with me?

1039
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:34,901
Yes.
- Dad, he has his office work.

1040
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,285
What office work?
Forget the office work.

1041
01:16:36,365 --> 01:16:37,496
Is it more important than uncle?

1042
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:38,869
His health is important.

1043
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,150
I will take one month leave.

1044
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,259
Or I will resign and work
in the fields in our village.

1045
01:16:43,339 --> 01:16:45,756
Who can deny my love for you?
- What?

1046
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:49,974
I mean.. My love for uncle,
my love for our family.

1047
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:51,120
I meant that.

1048
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,806
Ask them to discharge me soon.

1049
01:16:52,886 --> 01:16:54,687
Let's go. Let's get away from..

1050
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:59,271
Hello, Subbarao!
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I? Didn't I?

1051
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,671
Didn't I tell you to
run away if someone sneezes?

1052
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:03,779
Important call. One second.

1053
01:17:04,449 --> 01:17:05,952
You found me a great man, dear.

1054
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:07,984
Bring him upstairs
after he finishes his call.

1055
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:10,211
Okay, dad.
- Let's introduce him to mom.

1056
01:17:10,704 --> 01:17:11,666
Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,418
I will tell her. Okay. Okay, bye.

1058
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:17,731
My cousin Kishore.

1059
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:20,293
Don't fool me.
Even though you have OCD..

1060
01:17:20,693 --> 01:17:22,326
..I had the impression
that you would never tell lies.

1061
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:25,072
Thanks. For opening up.

1062
01:17:25,353 --> 01:17:26,456
Opening up?

1063
01:17:26,693 --> 01:17:28,110
You said you have
an impression about me.

1064
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:31,374
That was in the past.
But now I have only hatred for you.

1065
01:17:31,698 --> 01:17:34,369
I don't know.
It looks like love to me.

1066
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:37,331
Whatever. Why did you
give false hope to my dad..

1067
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:39,018
..when you know your own character?

1068
01:17:39,098 --> 01:17:40,931
Why did you promise him
that you will come to our village?

1069
01:17:41,147 --> 01:17:42,401
I really want to come.

1070
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:44,951
Really? Do you think
that is a software office?

1071
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,567
It is a village.
A man suffering with OCD like you..

1072
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,524
..can't survive there even one day.
Not even one day.

1073
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:54,940
For you. Sorry, for your dad,
I'm ready to walk into hell.

1074
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,437
Hey, stop it! There's
no need to become so emotional.

1075
01:17:57,517 --> 01:17:59,567
Why do you want to come?
What is he to you?

1076
01:17:59,647 --> 01:18:00,799
There is nothing between us now.

1077
01:18:00,879 --> 01:18:02,799
There is nothing between us.
But still I will come.

1078
01:18:03,037 --> 01:18:06,529
An elderly man said that
he will feel better if I'm with him.

1079
01:18:06,756 --> 01:18:08,972
I will come for his happiness,
not for you.

1080
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:11,448
Stick to that.
Once you come there, don't start..

1081
01:18:11,528 --> 01:18:13,567
..talking rubbish that
you came for me or for our love.

1082
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,588
There's nothing to talk about.
- What?

1083
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:20,953
Love.

1084
01:18:21,299 --> 01:18:22,726
I have no love for you.

1085
01:18:26,218 --> 01:18:27,569
But I still smell something.

1086
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:15,795
Mom! Grandfather is back!
Grandfather is back!

1087
01:22:25,568 --> 01:22:27,557
Brother! It was such a close call.

1088
01:22:27,637 --> 01:22:28,379
I'm fine, dear.

1089
01:22:28,459 --> 01:22:29,255
Wait! Let me ward off
the evil eyes from you.

1090
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:32,033
No, not from me. Ward off
the evil eyes from our son in law.

1091
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:32,995
Son in law?

1092
01:22:33,075 --> 01:22:34,260
Oh God!

1093
01:22:36,227 --> 01:22:37,741
Dust..
- Do you want a cloth?

1094
01:22:37,821 --> 01:22:38,617
Yes, do you have one?

1095
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:39,644
Idiot! First do what you came to do.

1096
01:22:39,724 --> 01:22:40,876
Okay.
- Dear!

1097
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,416
Stand beside him.
I will ward off the evil eyes.

1098
01:22:43,496 --> 01:22:46,476
I don't want it. Do it for him.
I cast my evil eyes on him.

1099
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:47,719
What?
- Hello, sis!

1100
01:22:47,799 --> 01:22:48,638
He is handsome, isn't he?
- Yes, she did.

1101
01:22:48,718 --> 01:22:49,632
You can ward off the evil eyes from us.
- Yeah.

1102
01:22:49,816 --> 01:22:52,130
To ward off the evil eyes
of neighbors, acquaintances..

1103
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,372
..family members,
villagers and everybody else.

1104
01:22:55,452 --> 01:22:57,134
Why did you spit in your hand?

1105
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,340
You will get infections.
Go wash your hands.

1106
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:02,669
Nothing will happen, son.
I do this at least four times a day.

1107
01:23:03,665 --> 01:23:04,595
He is funny.

1108
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:07,276
Control. You still have
to see and do a lot of things.

1109
01:23:07,356 --> 01:23:09,287
Look, another fresh concept
is on the way. Let's go.

1110
01:23:09,367 --> 01:23:10,520
I called up, sis.
- Children.

1111
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,327
Yes, please go.

1112
01:23:11,407 --> 01:23:12,387
Go.
- Anand!

1113
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:13,954
The children want a photo with you.

1114
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,067
With me? - Anand! I want to
post it on Facebook. Just one photo.

1115
01:23:17,147 --> 01:23:19,359
Wait a minute.
- Please, Anand. Please, Anand.

1116
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:23,272
What is the concept of these fingers?

1117
01:23:23,352 --> 01:23:24,559
Style, Anand. Style.

1118
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,845
Oh.

1119
01:23:28,429 --> 01:23:30,364
Please pull your tongues in, aunties.

1120
01:23:30,444 --> 01:23:31,888
We'll do it after clicking the photo.

1121
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:37,359
Now the servants.

1122
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,159
How long will you do that?

1123
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:41,792
Click.

1124
01:23:42,127 --> 01:23:43,856
One minute.
- Why did you lift your leg?

1125
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,748
'Kung Fu Panda' selfie.
It's a latest trend.

1126
01:23:45,828 --> 01:23:46,796
What rubbish!

1127
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:47,975
Please cooperate.
- Me too.

1128
01:23:48,689 --> 01:23:49,953
Coconut Oil Panda.

1129
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:53,336
You've changed a lot
after coming to this village.

1130
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:54,580
I've changed?

1131
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:55,812
Yes.

1132
01:23:56,818 --> 01:24:00,677
I didn't change.
I feel sick. I've to take bath.

1133
01:24:00,757 --> 01:24:02,504
Where is the bathroom?

1134
01:24:05,218 --> 01:24:06,332
Thanks.

1135
01:24:06,412 --> 01:24:07,693
Where is the bathroom?
- I don't know.

1136
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:09,326
Sticky fellow! Where is the bathroom?

1137
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:10,612
That's only for women.

1138
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:11,618
And for men?

1139
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:13,315
Right there.
- Oh. Right there?

1140
01:24:18,593 --> 01:24:19,749
What is happening there?

1141
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:23,047
The soap is enduring
torture on their bodies.

1142
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,554
Go ahead, sir.
If you take a bath with them..

1143
01:24:27,727 --> 01:24:30,116
..they will scrub
your back and thighs.

1144
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:33,197
What is that? Please tell me.

1145
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,268
What nonsense!
- Bathroom!

1146
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:38,056
Why should they touch our thighs?

1147
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:40,360
These are not village thighs
that you massage with oil.

1148
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,603
They are classy thighs
that were pampered with..

1149
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:42,554
..imported creams
and air conditioners.

1150
01:24:42,634 --> 01:24:43,625
Where is the bathroom?

1151
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:44,522
Where is the bathroom?

1152
01:24:44,602 --> 01:24:46,425
Hello, brothers!
Come with me. I'll show you..

1153
01:24:46,505 --> 01:24:47,561
..the best bathing place.

1154
01:24:48,674 --> 01:24:49,809
A western bathroom?

1155
01:24:49,889 --> 01:24:53,496
Western.. Western.. Western..

1156
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:02,373
It looks like a lake.
It might have mud.

1157
01:25:02,632 --> 01:25:04,827
This is not a swimming
pool to have cement tiles, bro.

1158
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:08,448
It is a lake.
Luckily it is empty. So hurry up.

1159
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,740
Don't expect anything
else in this village.

1160
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:12,751
We will not expect anything else.

1161
01:25:12,831 --> 01:25:15,389
Cousin! I'm going.
- Where?

1162
01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:17,386
I didn't unload myself since morning.

1163
01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:19,732
The lake looks very tempting.

1164
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:23,883
I can unload and clean at one go.
Then I'll be done.

1165
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:26,164
I will kill you if you
are seen in these surroundings.

1166
01:25:26,348 --> 01:25:28,899
Walk at least one kilometer,
take a bath with Dettol..

1167
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:30,823
..apply sanitizer and come back. Go.

1168
01:25:30,903 --> 01:25:32,639
I won't get those things here.

1169
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,217
You are way dirtier than
me because of those selfies.

1170
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:35,330
Cousin!
- Yes, bro?

1171
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,406
Let's find a tree and give it some manure.
- Let's go.

1172
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:41,481
"Playing in water and singing songs.."

1173
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:45,168
"It is so wonderful."

1174
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:48,423
"Playing in water..
It is so wonderful."

1175
01:25:50,034 --> 01:25:54,315
"Playing in water and singing songs.."

1176
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:07,613
Hey.. Kid.. Go away.

1177
01:26:10,856 --> 01:26:13,363
Kid, go home.

1178
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:17,861
You should wash at home, not here.

1179
01:26:19,309 --> 01:26:21,871
Hey! Don't you understand? Go home.

1180
01:26:23,969 --> 01:26:27,104
I beg of you.
Please. No, no, don't do it.

1181
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:29,288
I will buy lots of chocolates for you.

1182
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:34,229
No, no, I said no. Please..

1183
01:26:34,445 --> 01:26:38,770
Kid, listen to me.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1184
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:22,639
What's up, bro?
I think you loved the lake.

1185
01:27:22,953 --> 01:27:24,261
You stayed there until night.

1186
01:27:24,769 --> 01:27:26,640
I'll hit you with the
dumbbell and break your jaw.

1187
01:27:26,921 --> 01:27:28,510
I'm sparing you because
you are Meghana's cousin..

1188
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:29,343
..or else you would be dead.

1189
01:27:29,423 --> 01:27:30,413
You are a cousin, so be like one.

1190
01:27:30,493 --> 01:27:31,451
Go inside and play
with your dumbbells.

1191
01:27:31,531 --> 01:27:32,737
Okay.

1192
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,975
What happened? Why did you scold him?

1193
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:38,543
What happened?
The whole village took bath with me.

1194
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:40,139
Washing clothes, washing behinds..

1195
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,020
..blowing noses, scrubbing animals..

1196
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,981
..they did everything there.

1197
01:27:44,522 --> 01:27:47,214
It just took five minutes
for them to ruin the water.

1198
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:49,668
You mean this too?

1199
01:27:51,246 --> 01:27:52,478
Five people.

1200
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:56,792
Disgusting.
Even I can't bear to hear it.

1201
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,889
That's why we should
never hate anything so much.

1202
01:27:58,969 --> 01:28:01,452
If we hate something,
God will immerse us in it.

1203
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,765
But you don't smell dirty at all.

1204
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,084
Really?
- Yes.

1205
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,690
There was a water pump on the way.

1206
01:28:07,961 --> 01:28:09,269
I washed myself for three hours.

1207
01:28:09,474 --> 01:28:10,566
Maybe that's why I don't smell bad.

1208
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:12,058
That's good.

1209
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:15,064
Where were you since morning?

1210
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:16,426
Aren't you hungry?

1211
01:28:16,707 --> 01:28:18,448
Hungry? I'm starving.

1212
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:19,842
Come inside.

1213
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,934
Let's go.
- Don't touch me. I'm already irritated.

1214
01:28:23,014 --> 01:28:24,091
Okay.

1215
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,263
Why is everyone sitting together?

1216
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:30,848
When we make fresh
mango pickle in the house..

1217
01:28:30,928 --> 01:28:32,729
..my grandmother mixes
food in one plate..

1218
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:33,777
..and feeds everyone.

1219
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,713
Another new concept?

1220
01:28:40,794 --> 01:28:42,459
They are not giving
me any time to recover too.

1221
01:28:42,632 --> 01:28:43,788
Mix it well.

1222
01:28:43,868 --> 01:28:46,772
You love the girl.
You came here. Now endure it.

1223
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:50,848
What are you whispering?
Will you eat or no?

1224
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:52,427
Will you eat?

1225
01:28:52,697 --> 01:28:53,529
Yeah.

1226
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:54,772
Then I will eat too.
- Huh?

1227
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:57,421
Yes. Just look at them, Kishore.

1228
01:28:58,556 --> 01:28:59,464
We do this every year.

1229
01:28:59,544 --> 01:29:02,318
I love such dinners with new concepts.

1230
01:29:02,398 --> 01:29:05,075
Think about it.
One plate for 20 people.

1231
01:29:05,323 --> 01:29:07,658
So one hand will be feeding 20 mouths.

1232
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:11,463
So her five fingers
will touch everyone's lips.

1233
01:29:11,543 --> 01:29:13,647
Don't give me so many details,
Kishore.

1234
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:15,680
They are 20 people there.

1235
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:16,794
If we add ourselves,
we will be 24 of us.

1236
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:19,053
22.
- Whatever. Let's go.

1237
01:29:19,133 --> 01:29:20,850
Let's go.
You are frustrated. Sit down.

1238
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,525
That's okay. Go on.

1239
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,458
Don't look at him.

1240
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:31,403
Sticky fellow!

1241
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:32,552
Sticky fellow!
- Yes, sir?

1242
01:29:32,632 --> 01:29:33,795
Sir called you.

1243
01:29:34,525 --> 01:29:36,511
You apply oil on your head.
Then collect it from down.

1244
01:29:37,011 --> 01:29:39,025
Should I concentrate
on food or on your head?

1245
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,512
He is disturbing this
interesting dinner, Meghana.

1246
01:29:43,715 --> 01:29:44,917
Oh.
- Yes.

1247
01:29:44,997 --> 01:29:47,336
Maybe he is mixing
the oil in the food too.

1248
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,606
Is that a joke? I will kill you.
- Sorry.

1249
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:51,106
Grandmother!
- Yes, son?

1250
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:53,119
Start the war. Come on.

1251
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:00,457
Go on, take it.

1252
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:01,430
No other way?

1253
01:30:01,727 --> 01:30:03,187
Let's take it. No other way.

1254
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:08,877
I told you not to
give such huge morsels.

1255
01:30:11,945 --> 01:30:13,431
Why did he throw it back?

1256
01:30:13,511 --> 01:30:15,134
She might mix it with
the rest of the food.

1257
01:30:15,214 --> 01:30:17,053
Put it aside if it
is too much for you.

1258
01:30:17,133 --> 01:30:19,337
How many times did I tell
you not to put it back in the plate?

1259
01:30:20,053 --> 01:30:21,229
I feel like crying.

1260
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:24,607
No, it won't look
good if you cry here.

1261
01:30:25,539 --> 01:30:27,634
What happened? Won't you eat?

1262
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:29,850
Even if you want to eat..

1263
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,729
..the OCD man inside
you won't let you eat.

1264
01:30:31,918 --> 01:30:33,904
That's why I asked you to stay away..

1265
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:35,958
..from common people like us,
and our affections.

1266
01:30:36,038 --> 01:30:38,107
You can leave right now if you want.

1267
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,702
I won't mind.

1268
01:30:39,782 --> 01:30:40,999
Grandmother, mix it well.

1269
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:44,269
Mix it. Not a small morsel.
Give me a big morsel.

1270
01:30:44,349 --> 01:30:46,121
Mix it.

1271
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,013
Wait a minute.

1272
01:30:48,093 --> 01:30:49,458
Kishore!
- Yes?

1273
01:30:49,742 --> 01:30:51,661
Shall we take a small
morsel or a big morsel?

1274
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:53,729
It doesn't matter since
it has been tasted by everyone.

1275
01:30:55,269 --> 01:30:56,701
Uncle!

1276
01:30:56,781 --> 01:30:58,147
Uncle, how are you?

1277
01:30:59,513 --> 01:31:00,999
Don't you like these concept dinners?

1278
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:03,337
Why call him now? He is a patient..

1279
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,756
..and he might have
many more illnesses.

1280
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:05,769
That's right.

1281
01:31:05,849 --> 01:31:08,445
No, son. I drink buttermilk at night.

1282
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:10,391
Buttermilk! Let's drink that.
- That's better.

1283
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,715
Son! You can do that from tomorrow.

1284
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:14,242
But eat one morsel tonight.

1285
01:31:14,322 --> 01:31:16,863
We all want to see you eat one morsel.

1286
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:19,796
Eat, son.
- Eat it, son. Eat it, son. Eat it.

1287
01:31:19,985 --> 01:31:21,107
Eat it, bro.

1288
01:31:21,187 --> 01:31:23,282
You wanted to escape from one morsel.

1289
01:31:23,362 --> 01:31:25,255
Now you will have to
eat all these shared morsels.

1290
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:27,458
You think these are
shared morsels, Kishore?

1291
01:31:27,538 --> 01:31:28,796
Aren't they?

1292
01:31:28,876 --> 01:31:33,890
This is love. Affection. Care.

1293
01:31:34,432 --> 01:31:40,850
I can't bear it.
Such a caring family. So much love.

1294
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,026
Live for hundred years.

1295
01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:46,715
Stop your drama.

1296
01:31:46,795 --> 01:31:48,148
Did I pull it off?
- You are on your own now.

1297
01:31:48,702 --> 01:31:50,337
No, wait.

1298
01:31:51,919 --> 01:31:54,878
Dear, I think he is hesitating
to eat from our hands.

1299
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:57,284
You feed him.
Maybe he will eat from your hand.

1300
01:32:02,054 --> 01:32:05,000
What? Will you really eat?
Should I feed you?

1301
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,635
Even if you feed me poison
with your loving hands..

1302
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:08,256
..I'm ready to eat it and die.

1303
01:33:09,978 --> 01:33:13,248
I must agree.
You give very good massage.

1304
01:33:13,465 --> 01:33:15,586
Bhadram, where is he? Did you see him?

1305
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:16,721
Who do you mean by him?

1306
01:33:16,801 --> 01:33:18,248
She means Anand.

1307
01:33:18,328 --> 01:33:20,600
Don't call him by name.
Call him brother in law.

1308
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,167
Oh. Brother in law
is relaxing in the fields.

1309
01:33:24,247 --> 01:33:25,694
Okay, let's go.
- I don't want to come.

1310
01:33:25,774 --> 01:33:26,322
Please come.

1311
01:33:26,402 --> 01:33:27,922
Madam, I want to come too.
- Why can't you go alone?

1312
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:29,024
Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

1313
01:33:29,273 --> 01:33:33,608
You ate one morsel. I'm sure
it is a part of your blood now.

1314
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:36,797
If you try any longer,
you will vomit your intestines.

1315
01:33:37,057 --> 01:33:39,565
Come here. Come on, come here.

1316
01:33:39,645 --> 01:33:40,473
Come on.

1317
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:43,976
I feel sick when I think
of the morsel that he put inside.

1318
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:46,430
I see. That is called nausea.

1319
01:33:46,765 --> 01:33:50,624
Do one thing.
Just smell this once. Lightly.

1320
01:33:50,704 --> 01:33:51,727
How will that help?

1321
01:33:51,807 --> 01:33:55,457
You have OCD. Men like
you don't have to drink alcohol.

1322
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:57,468
You will get a high
if you just smell alcohol.

1323
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:58,830
Smell it. Take it.
- Really?

1324
01:33:59,327 --> 01:34:00,559
Give it to me.

1325
01:34:04,711 --> 01:34:06,462
I feel a light buzz already.

1326
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:08,754
Now lick this pickle.

1327
01:34:08,928 --> 01:34:10,128
Just because I'm on a high..

1328
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,425
..it doesn't mean
I can't think straight.

1329
01:34:11,505 --> 01:34:13,252
The OCD man inside me is alert.

1330
01:34:13,533 --> 01:34:15,468
You are a gentleman
and he is your watchman.

1331
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:19,155
You ate the shared morsel
that Meghana fed you.

1332
01:34:21,165 --> 01:34:24,981
Imagine that I'm Meghana,
and lick this finger..

1333
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:27,197
..you will surely feel good.

1334
01:34:28,213 --> 01:34:29,359
You are Meghana?
- Yes.

1335
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:30,949
Are you sure?

1336
01:34:31,029 --> 01:34:34,041
Don't you think my skin
tone is like Meghana's?

1337
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:36,863
Look! Look at the
brightness of my skin.

1338
01:34:36,943 --> 01:34:38,506
Okay, give me one more.

1339
01:34:38,712 --> 01:34:39,771
Atta boy.

1340
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,673
Give it to me.

1341
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:50,971
Meghana! Why are you so arrogant?

1342
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:52,614
Because I'm fair, Anand.

1343
01:34:53,339 --> 01:34:55,956
When I saw your cleanliness
the first time I met you..

1344
01:34:56,036 --> 01:34:59,220
..I loved with the hopes
that you'll be a bigger OCD than me.

1345
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:02,788
But you are creating trouble for me.

1346
01:35:04,183 --> 01:35:08,194
When I punched a man in
the office for not washing hands..

1347
01:35:08,421 --> 01:35:10,140
..you said he was
wrong and I was right.

1348
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:12,183
But when I got down from
the car after your father..

1349
01:35:12,263 --> 01:35:17,383
..vomited blood in it, you left me.
You rejected me.

1350
01:35:19,167 --> 01:35:21,556
You liked my OCD character
before you fell in love..

1351
01:35:21,636 --> 01:35:23,924
..so why don't you like
it now after you fell in love?

1352
01:35:24,216 --> 01:35:25,773
I want to know the answer.

1353
01:35:25,989 --> 01:35:27,351
Answer me.

1354
01:35:29,535 --> 01:35:31,438
Who are you?

1355
01:35:32,681 --> 01:35:33,881
Are you Meghana's agent?

1356
01:35:34,118 --> 01:35:35,318
Why are you hiding there?

1357
01:35:35,567 --> 01:35:37,394
Will you eavesdrop on
me and carry the news to her?

1358
01:35:37,474 --> 01:35:39,015
Hey!
- You idiot!

1359
01:35:39,095 --> 01:35:40,432
I'm almost done. Almost done.

1360
01:35:40,512 --> 01:35:41,989
Almost done? What did we ask you?

1361
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,026
What are you talking about? Get up!

1362
01:35:43,106 --> 01:35:44,172
Sir, I'm almost done.

1363
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:47,211
Sir's friend, I'm almost done.

1364
01:35:47,448 --> 01:35:48,973
Disgusting.

1365
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:53,189
Why am I forced to see all
the filth in this world, Kishore?

1366
01:35:54,151 --> 01:35:58,291
She rejected me because
of my over cleanliness.

1367
01:35:58,371 --> 01:35:59,459
Don't you think she is a fool?
- You are right.

1368
01:35:59,539 --> 01:36:01,113
Don't you think she is a fool?

1369
01:36:01,193 --> 01:36:02,281
Hey, Meghana!

1370
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:04,875
No. Not Hey Meghana!
Say Foolish Meghana!

1371
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,918
That corner bit. That one.

1372
01:36:12,193 --> 01:36:13,512
That is to the east.
- I love it.

1373
01:36:13,592 --> 01:36:16,139
It is east facing.
- Exactly. Isn't it nice?

1374
01:36:16,219 --> 01:36:18,107
We can sell the Manikonda
flat and buy this land easily.

1375
01:36:18,344 --> 01:36:19,804
Let's buy it. As you wish.

1376
01:36:19,884 --> 01:36:21,825
You don't realize it
but you have a sharp mind.

1377
01:36:21,905 --> 01:36:22,950
Maybe.

1378
01:36:23,598 --> 01:36:25,825
What's up, Meghana?
Did you all eat shared morsels?

1379
01:36:26,075 --> 01:36:27,523
Just shut up, okay?

1380
01:36:28,042 --> 01:36:30,237
I thought that perhaps
you've really changed..

1381
01:36:30,442 --> 01:36:33,274
..and that I'm misinterpreting you,
so I came to apologize.

1382
01:36:34,096 --> 01:36:35,729
But now your secret is out.

1383
01:36:36,939 --> 01:36:40,452
You will never change,
and you are worsening.

1384
01:36:40,532 --> 01:36:43,393
I never imagined that you'll
drink alcohol which I hate.

1385
01:36:43,577 --> 01:36:46,809
No way! I don't drink alcohol,
Meghana. I just smelled it.

1386
01:36:46,889 --> 01:36:49,058
Is it? Is that why
you called her foolish?

1387
01:36:49,328 --> 01:36:52,269
I already told you that
you are a cousin, so be like one..

1388
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:53,642
..but you never listen to me.

1389
01:36:53,988 --> 01:36:55,458
Be like a cousin. As we said.

1390
01:36:55,912 --> 01:36:57,653
Trust me, Meghana. I swear.

1391
01:36:57,826 --> 01:36:59,880
Remove your hand.
- I didn't drink. I just smelled it..

1392
01:37:00,139 --> 01:37:02,193
..and lovingly called
you foolish Meghana.

1393
01:37:02,398 --> 01:37:03,631
Enough of your acting.

1394
01:37:04,312 --> 01:37:06,939
Don't be one person before
me and another one behind me.

1395
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:09,512
It is better for us
to be away from each other.

1396
01:37:10,183 --> 01:37:13,513
Don't expect that I'll
accept your love. Goodbye.

1397
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:14,778
Let's go.

1398
01:37:20,443 --> 01:37:23,145
What is done is done.
You need this now. Continue.

1399
01:37:26,292 --> 01:37:27,632
That's raw liquor.

1400
01:37:28,054 --> 01:37:29,222
Get lost.

1401
01:37:31,383 --> 01:37:32,378
Good morning, grandmother.

1402
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:34,129
Will you have some coffee?
- No.

1403
01:37:35,037 --> 01:37:37,015
Did you sleep well, son?

1404
01:37:37,095 --> 01:37:40,583
Sticky fellow! You are a
good masseuse. You deserve a tip.

1405
01:37:40,663 --> 01:37:42,226
I don't want tips.
Just give me your thighs.

1406
01:37:42,306 --> 01:37:44,831
I've never done it before.
This will be the first time.

1407
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:45,793
Massage them well with oil.

1408
01:37:45,873 --> 01:37:48,843
What is this? Will you become..

1409
01:37:48,923 --> 01:37:51,730
I'm changing. Looking at
him being so oily all the time..

1410
01:37:51,989 --> 01:37:54,270
..I wanted to experience
that feeling once.

1411
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:56,562
Believe me. It is amazing.

1412
01:37:56,642 --> 01:37:57,405
Sticky fellow!
- Yes?

1413
01:37:57,485 --> 01:37:59,038
Apply oil to him too.
Remove your t-shirt.

1414
01:37:59,212 --> 01:38:02,629
I'm already frustrated.
Don't test my patience.

1415
01:38:04,585 --> 01:38:06,736
What is happening?
Why is my head throbbing like this?

1416
01:38:07,212 --> 01:38:10,044
Don't you remember
what happened last night?

1417
01:38:10,779 --> 01:38:12,433
Last night.. You came to me.

1418
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:14,444
You said some sweet words to me.

1419
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:19,179
After that..
Was it a duet or a montage?

1420
01:38:19,385 --> 01:38:23,169
Yes, it was a duet. That's
why I woke up with this feeling..

1421
01:38:23,249 --> 01:38:27,104
Hello! That's not true.
See this video. It's funny.

1422
01:38:27,184 --> 01:38:29,774
You are a cousin, so be one.
I'll punch you to death.

1423
01:38:29,854 --> 01:38:31,223
Do you know what will
happen if he sees that video?

1424
01:38:31,303 --> 01:38:33,212
Let him see it. What will happen?

1425
01:38:33,904 --> 01:38:36,045
He should remember
his foolish behavior.

1426
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,623
You don't know how he is, Meghana.

1427
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:40,359
I can hate myself,
but he is not capable of that quality.

1428
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:41,829
He is a big softie.

1429
01:38:42,035 --> 01:38:44,402
Is that so?
He didn't have a problem doing it..

1430
01:38:44,482 --> 01:38:45,720
..but he will have
a problem seeing it?

1431
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:47,180
That's too much.

1432
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,142
No, Meghana. Listen to me..

1433
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:51,158
Stop fighting. Why will
it be a problem if I see my video?

1434
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:52,779
No, don't do it. Listen to me.
- Give it to me.

1435
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:54,786
No, don't see it. Don't see it.
- Enjoy yourself.

1436
01:38:54,866 --> 01:38:56,462
No, don't see it. Don't see it.
- What is this fuss all about?

1437
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:35,318
Hello! Hello! Stop it!

1438
01:40:35,398 --> 01:40:36,426
What's wrong?

1439
01:40:36,506 --> 01:40:38,075
Master, a small break please.

1440
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:39,440
Go ahead.

1441
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:27,723
Now tell me.

1442
01:42:27,803 --> 01:42:29,277
Was that a romantic song?

1443
01:42:29,357 --> 01:42:32,148
Hey! Hey, no!
- Oh dear! What happened to him?

1444
01:42:32,228 --> 01:42:33,219
What happened? Son!

1445
01:42:33,299 --> 01:42:34,365
Move, let him get some air.
- Padma!

1446
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:35,302
Bring some water.

1447
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:37,875
Are you happy?
I told you not to show him that video.

1448
01:42:37,955 --> 01:42:39,151
I think he is going to die.

1449
01:42:39,231 --> 01:42:40,351
What should I do?

1450
01:42:40,524 --> 01:42:42,708
Madam, don't worry.
I will wake him up.

1451
01:42:42,788 --> 01:42:43,800
I've seen it in many movies.

1452
01:42:43,973 --> 01:42:44,686
What will you do?

1453
01:42:44,913 --> 01:42:46,232
What are you going to do?

1454
01:42:46,978 --> 01:42:49,043
He will wake up if
I blow into his mouth.

1455
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:53,378
No, wait.
He didn't drown in water. He fainted.

1456
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,183
If he finds out that
you blew air into his mouth..

1457
01:42:55,263 --> 01:42:56,567
..we can bury his body in the evening.

1458
01:42:56,647 --> 01:42:57,453
Go bring some water.

1459
01:42:59,788 --> 01:43:03,042
Kishore, dad is coming home.
Do something to wake him.

1460
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:04,966
He will get worried if
he sees him in this condition.

1461
01:43:05,366 --> 01:43:06,718
Continue your massage.

1462
01:43:07,377 --> 01:43:10,080
Do you know this? There's a tractor..

1463
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,102
..that looks like
a pig rolled in the mud.

1464
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:16,070
The tires are coated
with so many layers of mud.

1465
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,897
There's also cow dung
stuck between the gaps.

1466
01:43:20,232 --> 01:43:23,043
That tractor is coming to our house.

1467
01:43:23,216 --> 01:43:26,438
And your Puma shoes from
America are right there.

1468
01:43:26,518 --> 01:43:29,096
I'm worried that the tractor
tires that are coated with..

1469
01:43:29,176 --> 01:43:32,599
..cow dung are going
to ruin your shoes.

1470
01:43:32,902 --> 01:43:34,221
Who will wash it?

1471
01:43:34,394 --> 01:43:37,010
I will wash it.
I will wash it. Where's the tractor?

1472
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:38,177
Tractor! I did it!

1473
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,069
Oh, it's you.

1474
01:43:41,085 --> 01:43:44,220
Great man!
I join my hands before your character.

1475
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:47,097
It is very difficult to come
to terms with all these angles.

1476
01:43:47,313 --> 01:43:48,275
Oh God!

1477
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:49,183
Anand!

1478
01:43:52,296 --> 01:43:53,723
Yes, uncle?

1479
01:43:54,155 --> 01:43:55,420
A suggestion..

1480
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:56,653
You want to give suggestion
or take suggestion?

1481
01:43:58,296 --> 01:44:00,502
Oh. Sorry.

1482
01:44:00,978 --> 01:44:02,242
Give your suggestion, uncle.
That's okay.

1483
01:44:02,783 --> 01:44:04,556
My nephew Seenu will not refuse me..

1484
01:44:04,636 --> 01:44:06,091
..if I personally request him.

1485
01:44:07,614 --> 01:44:11,787
They all are suggesting that
I ask him to fight for our village.

1486
01:44:11,867 --> 01:44:15,560
But if he doesn't agree to
it after I ask him, it will be..

1487
01:44:16,284 --> 01:44:18,814
No, uncle.
I will ask him on your behalf.

1488
01:44:19,268 --> 01:44:20,554
You?

1489
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,473
You will get upset if he
says something bad in his anger.

1490
01:44:23,895 --> 01:44:26,392
And I can't take that
risk with your health.

1491
01:44:28,133 --> 01:44:29,192
Oh God!

1492
01:44:29,272 --> 01:44:31,473
I will handle it. I will.

1493
01:44:35,214 --> 01:44:37,398
You gave me such a good son in law.

1494
01:44:37,478 --> 01:44:38,522
Hmm.

1495
01:44:38,602 --> 01:44:39,895
Let's go.

1496
01:44:42,879 --> 01:44:44,133
I'm so unfortunate.

1497
01:44:54,446 --> 01:44:55,462
You look cute.

1498
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:57,776
I wanted to look official
since we are meeting our relatives.

1499
01:44:57,971 --> 01:44:58,717
Same here.

1500
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:00,014
Thank you.

1501
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:13,582
You already jumped into the water..

1502
01:45:13,662 --> 01:45:15,149
..now you have to swim.

1503
01:45:15,463 --> 01:45:16,533
That's him.

1504
01:45:20,543 --> 01:45:21,376
Who are you?

1505
01:45:21,456 --> 01:45:22,932
I'm a bus.

1506
01:45:23,012 --> 01:45:24,424
Then turn around.
This is a construction site.

1507
01:45:24,504 --> 01:45:25,711
Go away.

1508
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:27,192
Bus, my foot.

1509
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,943
Watch your step.

1510
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:30,111
Please come.

1511
01:45:30,191 --> 01:45:33,819
Seenu! Seenu!
He is Anand, Meghana's future husband.

1512
01:45:35,061 --> 01:45:37,483
Hi, sir.
Nice to meet you. How are you?

1513
01:45:37,786 --> 01:45:39,537
What do you want?

1514
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:41,807
Uncle wants to meet you.

1515
01:45:42,499 --> 01:45:43,721
Who are you to call me?

1516
01:45:43,801 --> 01:45:44,758
What happened to the old man?

1517
01:45:45,115 --> 01:45:46,823
Is he ashamed to come to talk to me?

1518
01:45:47,753 --> 01:45:49,331
You are calling him an old man.

1519
01:45:49,796 --> 01:45:52,456
But he still refers to you
as his nephew, his sister's son.

1520
01:45:52,921 --> 01:45:54,499
He is very sad that
you are not with him.

1521
01:45:54,579 --> 01:45:55,926
He has you now.

1522
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:59,127
Right, but Anand can't be Seenu.

1523
01:45:59,764 --> 01:46:02,413
You are his blood relative,
and I'm not.

1524
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:05,699
An elderly man who
raised you from childhood..

1525
01:46:05,872 --> 01:46:07,991
..is not well and
is thinking about you.

1526
01:46:08,456 --> 01:46:11,645
You should show him love at this time,
not anger.

1527
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:16,262
If you speak lovingly to him,
he will live an extra 5 years.

1528
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:20,186
I hope that you'll respect
him for his age and meet him.

1529
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,192
One more thing.

1530
01:46:23,462 --> 01:46:24,780
Actually he wanted
to come and talk to you.

1531
01:46:25,386 --> 01:46:27,505
But I told him that if
you are a reasonable man..

1532
01:46:28,089 --> 01:46:29,353
..I can persuade you
to come and talk to him.

1533
01:46:29,433 --> 01:46:30,932
I said that a man who
grew up in that house..

1534
01:46:31,012 --> 01:46:32,283
..will have some humanity at least.

1535
01:46:32,363 --> 01:46:33,483
Now I leave the decision to you.

1536
01:46:39,797 --> 01:46:42,262
Seenu! The wrestling
match is approaching.

1537
01:46:42,662 --> 01:46:45,685
Your uncle sent his
son in law to talk to you..

1538
01:46:45,863 --> 01:46:47,366
..because the villagers asked him to.

1539
01:46:47,539 --> 01:46:49,247
He didn't it out of love for you.

1540
01:46:49,485 --> 01:46:52,187
If it wasn't for that son in law..

1541
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:57,247
..he would've happily married
his cousin and stayed there.

1542
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:00,339
And we would've been
here singing hymns.

1543
01:47:00,577 --> 01:47:01,637
So, what is your point?

1544
01:47:01,717 --> 01:47:06,189
The problem will be solved
if we kill Ramaraju's son in law.

1545
01:47:06,269 --> 01:47:07,497
Murder?

1546
01:47:07,577 --> 01:47:10,524
Yes, murder. Let's give it a try.

1547
01:47:10,604 --> 01:47:12,578
Well and good if we succeed
or we'll just forget it.

1548
01:47:12,658 --> 01:47:14,967
But if we don't do anything..

1549
01:47:15,205 --> 01:47:17,659
..he will lecture this
fellow at every given chance..

1550
01:47:17,739 --> 01:47:19,659
..and become a great man
in his father in law's eyes.

1551
01:47:19,739 --> 01:47:21,519
Do we need all that now? Do we?

1552
01:47:21,692 --> 01:47:25,865
Ramaraju will know his value
only if we kill his son in law.

1553
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:27,325
Where are you going?

1554
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:28,720
I will come back after killing him.

1555
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,169
Shut up and sit down.

1556
01:47:30,353 --> 01:47:31,077
Listen!
- Yes, sir?

1557
01:47:31,157 --> 01:47:33,055
Shankar! Our name shouldn't come up.

1558
01:47:33,135 --> 01:47:35,862
Okay, sir.
- Nobody should connect us to this murder.

1559
01:47:36,143 --> 01:47:37,797
Did you understand what sir said?

1560
01:47:37,877 --> 01:47:40,986
Sir's name shouldn't be in
A1 and his name shouldn't be in A2.

1561
01:47:41,066 --> 01:47:42,522
Hey!

1562
01:47:43,571 --> 01:47:45,679
I will write my name
as the A1 accused.

1563
01:47:48,305 --> 01:47:49,754
Dear, vermilion dot.

1564
01:47:51,029 --> 01:47:52,154
Vermilion dot.

1565
01:47:52,327 --> 01:47:53,418
Done.

1566
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:55,894
If you behave like this,
our God will get angry..

1567
01:47:55,974 --> 01:47:58,403
..and roll you in the mud. Be careful.

1568
01:47:58,576 --> 01:48:01,138
No way. He loves me.

1569
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,489
Holy water.

1570
01:48:02,569 --> 01:48:04,230
Done. You carry on.

1571
01:48:04,716 --> 01:48:06,749
Everybody loves you except me.

1572
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:09,052
I know you well.

1573
01:48:09,603 --> 01:48:11,408
Is that so?
- Yes.

1574
01:48:11,488 --> 01:48:13,997
We are showing you
honor because you came..

1575
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:15,835
..to our village.
We love our enemies too.

1576
01:48:15,915 --> 01:48:17,013
Sir, God's offerings.

1577
01:48:17,272 --> 01:48:18,235
Done.

1578
01:48:18,315 --> 01:48:19,391
No matter what the concept is..

1579
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:21,002
..the common points are the same,
you know.

1580
01:48:23,034 --> 01:48:23,975
Let's go.

1581
01:48:25,056 --> 01:48:28,353
Wait, I will kill him.

1582
01:48:29,543 --> 01:48:31,143
Buy tickets for the matinee show.

1583
01:48:46,526 --> 01:48:49,747
Stop. Step back. Step back.

1584
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,947
What is that color?
They mix chemicals in it.

1585
01:48:53,282 --> 01:48:54,796
You will lose your eyesight
if it goes into your eyes.

1586
01:48:54,876 --> 01:48:57,357
You will have to
beg for alms right here.

1587
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:01,130
Let's go.

1588
01:49:01,422 --> 01:49:02,633
He looks funny, right?

1589
01:49:02,713 --> 01:49:04,287
Funny, my foot. Let's go.

1590
01:49:11,951 --> 01:49:12,719
Idiot!

1591
01:49:12,799 --> 01:49:15,454
I went to murder him
but he spoke of my well-being.

1592
01:49:17,466 --> 01:49:20,222
Don't go close. He'll lecture you too.
Kill him from here.

1593
01:49:29,303 --> 01:49:30,687
What are you doing?

1594
01:49:30,767 --> 01:49:32,816
Hey! Don't do that.

1595
01:49:42,427 --> 01:49:44,427
You idiot! Where did you aim it? Run!

1596
01:49:50,384 --> 01:49:52,244
108!

1597
01:49:56,363 --> 01:49:58,352
You will be alright.
Don't worry. Okay?

1598
01:49:58,432 --> 01:49:59,876
Where is the oxygen?
- I brought it, sir. I brought it.

1599
01:49:59,956 --> 01:50:02,138
Come on, attach it to her.
Hurry up. Is it fresh?

1600
01:50:02,218 --> 01:50:03,035
Yes, sir.

1601
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,521
Are you okay?

1602
01:50:10,342 --> 01:50:11,402
No harm will come to
you as long as I'm here.

1603
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:13,175
Don't be scared. Okay?

1604
01:50:13,255 --> 01:50:15,445
She is not scared. You are scared.

1605
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:18,699
Don't be sarcastic. I'll break
your jaw with this kerchief. Go.

1606
01:50:19,088 --> 01:50:20,418
Doctor! Doctor!

1607
01:50:20,498 --> 01:50:21,564
Where is the doctor?
- There he is.

1608
01:50:21,644 --> 01:50:22,458
Call him.

1609
01:50:22,695 --> 01:50:23,776
Doctor!

1610
01:50:24,252 --> 01:50:25,517
Doctor!
- What is this chaos?

1611
01:50:26,015 --> 01:50:27,734
Remove that from your ear.
Throw it. Throw it.

1612
01:50:27,814 --> 01:50:29,291
This? It's okay, I will use it later.

1613
01:50:29,561 --> 01:50:30,804
What's the problem?

1614
01:50:30,884 --> 01:50:32,199
She lost 6 ml blood, doctor.

1615
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:33,032
6 ml?

1616
01:50:33,237 --> 01:50:34,415
More than 35 drops blood.

1617
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,777
A rusted knife cut her
arm and fell at her feet.

1618
01:50:38,005 --> 01:50:39,540
You already bandaged her arm.

1619
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:41,323
I gave her the basic first aid I know.

1620
01:50:41,403 --> 01:50:43,009
Take her to the surgery room,
stitch the cut..

1621
01:50:43,089 --> 01:50:45,409
..and keep her in
the hospital for a week.

1622
01:50:46,966 --> 01:50:47,917
Be careful.

1623
01:50:47,997 --> 01:50:49,074
For this small scratch?

1624
01:50:49,154 --> 01:50:50,879
You want me to stitch
it up in the surgery room?

1625
01:50:50,959 --> 01:50:52,047
That's not a small scratch.
It was a rusted knife.

1626
01:50:52,127 --> 01:50:52,782
It can cause infection..

1627
01:50:52,862 --> 01:50:53,691
Wait a minute.

1628
01:50:55,658 --> 01:50:56,372
Who fixed the oxygen mask?

1629
01:50:56,452 --> 01:50:58,048
Me, sir. Did I do it correctly, sir?

1630
01:50:58,783 --> 01:51:00,685
You are fired. You can go home.
- Doctor!

1631
01:51:00,858 --> 01:51:02,566
Just because we gave
you these cylinders..

1632
01:51:02,646 --> 01:51:04,102
..will you fix them
on anyone who comes in?

1633
01:51:04,182 --> 01:51:05,139
He fixed it because I asked him to.

1634
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:06,253
Who is the doctor here, you or me?

1635
01:51:06,804 --> 01:51:08,069
So shut up.
Get down, dear.

1636
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:10,079
Doctor! If she keeps her leg down..

1637
01:51:10,159 --> 01:51:10,955
Don't move.

1638
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,269
If she keeps her leg down,
the infection will spread..

1639
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:14,522
..that wound will become bigger..

1640
01:51:14,602 --> 01:51:16,749
Shut up. If you say another word..

1641
01:51:16,829 --> 01:51:19,700
..I'll resign,
go to my village and do farming.

1642
01:51:19,917 --> 01:51:22,295
Farming will suit you,
but I won't give you that chance.

1643
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:24,500
Thanks for understanding.
Bring her in.

1644
01:51:24,814 --> 01:51:25,776
Doctor, what will we use..

1645
01:51:25,856 --> 01:51:28,490
Catch him! Don't let him come inside!

1646
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:30,446
Bring the patient inside.

1647
01:51:35,722 --> 01:51:39,127
Sir, be gentle.
It's an injection, please be gentle.

1648
01:51:40,608 --> 01:51:42,327
Does that great man love you, dear?

1649
01:51:42,407 --> 01:51:43,711
Hmm.

1650
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:46,856
I got it.
We should love our dear ones..

1651
01:51:46,936 --> 01:51:49,073
..but we shouldn't
be crazy about them.

1652
01:51:49,256 --> 01:51:53,192
He is crazy about you.
You are so lucky, dear.

1653
01:55:45,594 --> 01:55:48,263
Brother!
That knife was not an accident.

1654
01:55:49,056 --> 01:55:51,421
Everyone thinks that it
was an attack on son in law.

1655
01:55:51,501 --> 01:55:54,022
Seenu has become haughty
with Bhupathi's support.

1656
01:55:54,276 --> 01:55:56,539
Just say the word.
I will put him at your feet.

1657
01:55:58,938 --> 01:56:01,877
He left us and is now
raising weapons on us.

1658
01:56:02,452 --> 01:56:04,141
He is our enemy.

1659
01:56:05,307 --> 01:56:09,124
We will attack him
where it hurts the most.

1660
01:56:10,307 --> 01:56:14,023
This is not a time to fight.
It is a time to compete.

1661
01:56:15,206 --> 01:56:20,138
Let's prove our power
to him in the wrestling match.

1662
01:56:22,892 --> 01:56:25,831
He is so arrogant about
his strength in wrestling.

1663
01:56:26,253 --> 01:56:28,331
We'll defeat him in his own game.

1664
01:56:29,074 --> 01:56:34,615
I know how to bring victory
to this village and myself.

1665
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,599
The wrestling match that
has been eagerly awaited..

1666
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:43,382
..by the surrounding districts
is going to start now.

1667
01:56:43,462 --> 01:56:45,325
Like every year, this year also..

1668
01:56:45,405 --> 01:56:49,869
..Ramapuram will
compete with Durgapuram.

1669
01:56:51,693 --> 01:56:54,615
On this side is Mr.
Ramaraju, an invincible leader..

1670
01:56:54,695 --> 01:56:59,210
..who has been ruling as
the Village Head for 7 years.

1671
01:57:02,756 --> 01:57:04,852
And on the other side is Mr.
Bhupathi..

1672
01:57:04,932 --> 01:57:07,385
..who is determined to
be the next Village Head..

1673
01:57:07,465 --> 01:57:10,240
..a post which is dangling
in front of him like a sour grape.

1674
01:57:10,476 --> 01:57:13,195
They will be competing
with their own teams.

1675
01:57:13,482 --> 01:57:16,962
But Mr. Ramaraju's nephew,
wrestling champion Seenu..

1676
01:57:17,266 --> 01:57:22,452
..fighting for Durgapuram
for the first time is the highlight.

1677
01:57:22,532 --> 01:57:26,372
Highlight!
- This is not a highlight. It is betrayal.

1678
01:57:26,452 --> 01:57:28,232
Betrayal! Betrayal!

1679
01:57:28,312 --> 01:57:29,778
Hey!

1680
01:57:30,339 --> 01:57:31,625
What do you call your act?

1681
01:57:31,705 --> 01:57:33,733
I've been looking at her
as my wife from childhood..

1682
01:57:33,906 --> 01:57:35,971
..but you gave her hand to this man.

1683
01:57:36,051 --> 01:57:39,074
I thought you will give her
to me at least for this village.

1684
01:57:39,154 --> 01:57:40,825
But you brought this fellow home..

1685
01:57:40,905 --> 01:57:42,630
..and sent him to me
with a message of compromise.

1686
01:57:42,710 --> 01:57:43,765
Just being an elderly
one is not enough.

1687
01:57:43,845 --> 01:57:46,576
You've carried her
when she was a baby.

1688
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:48,154
How can you marry her?

1689
01:57:48,234 --> 01:57:50,424
Who says I can't marry
her because I've carried her?

1690
01:57:50,504 --> 01:57:53,927
Shut up! I viewed you as my own son.

1691
01:57:54,110 --> 01:57:56,542
That's why I hoped you
will make me your son in law.

1692
01:57:56,791 --> 01:57:58,866
You ungrateful dog!
- Calm down.

1693
01:57:58,946 --> 01:58:00,812
You can talk to humans,
not to fools like him.

1694
01:58:01,223 --> 01:58:02,325
Let's go. Come on.

1695
01:58:02,405 --> 01:58:03,374
You!

1696
01:58:03,454 --> 01:58:05,493
Quiet. Why do you scream like that?

1697
01:58:05,752 --> 01:58:07,234
If you scream like that,
it will damage your vocal chords..

1698
01:58:07,314 --> 01:58:08,661
..and you will lose your voice,
you know.

1699
01:58:08,985 --> 01:58:11,731
Hey! - Oh God! He will not change.
- Shut up. You are hurting my ears.

1700
01:58:12,638 --> 01:58:17,946
Seenu! Show this anger in the ground.

1701
01:58:18,151 --> 01:58:22,941
Your uncle and his daughter
should regret their actions.

1702
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:25,492
Sit down.

1703
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:31,968
Mr. Bhupathi!
Long live! Mr. Bhupathi! Long live!

1704
01:58:32,184 --> 01:58:34,412
He is the next Village Head.

1705
01:58:34,661 --> 01:58:37,234
He will sit in that
seat after half an hour.

1706
01:59:03,784 --> 01:59:05,838
Oh God! Do you see that?

1707
01:59:06,206 --> 01:59:08,227
Men on his side are like strong bulls.

1708
01:59:25,524 --> 01:59:27,707
Stop it! Our man is losing!

1709
01:59:41,329 --> 01:59:42,550
Well done!

1710
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:47,199
Sir, don't worry.
We have Seenu with us.

1711
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:49,523
He is charging like a lion.

1712
02:00:08,376 --> 02:00:09,900
Seenu!

1713
02:00:31,727 --> 02:00:35,900
Long live Durgapuram!
Long live Durgapuram!

1714
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:39,133
Hey! Is anybody left?

1715
02:00:41,014 --> 02:00:42,506
I'm here!

1716
02:00:42,586 --> 02:00:45,760
Hey, put it down.
You are a cousin, be like one.

1717
02:00:45,933 --> 02:00:48,225
You came here with puffed out chests..

1718
02:00:48,305 --> 02:00:50,905
..but you bit the
dust in five minutes.

1719
02:00:52,484 --> 02:00:56,614
You didn't value me
when I fought on your side.

1720
02:00:56,694 --> 02:00:58,754
Nobody has the guts
to fight with you, Seenu.

1721
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,246
They all are useless men.

1722
02:01:00,326 --> 02:01:01,824
Useless men!

1723
02:01:03,067 --> 02:01:04,202
Give it to me.
- Yes, sir.

1724
02:01:04,282 --> 02:01:05,229
Silence! Silence!

1725
02:01:05,309 --> 02:01:08,515
Ramaraju, looks like
there is nobody left to fight.

1726
02:01:08,829 --> 02:01:11,964
So end the match and decide
who the Village Head is.

1727
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:15,163
Who is he to decide it, sir?

1728
02:01:15,358 --> 02:01:17,974
That chair has been
waiting for you for so long.

1729
02:01:18,054 --> 02:01:19,736
Well said. Well said.

1730
02:01:20,277 --> 02:01:22,980
Meghana, shall we leave?
The match is over.

1731
02:01:24,244 --> 02:01:25,401
Let's go.

1732
02:01:31,758 --> 02:01:34,677
Look, uncle!
I will give you one last chance.

1733
02:01:35,056 --> 02:01:39,251
Give her to me,
I will fight for our village..

1734
02:01:39,331 --> 02:01:41,672
..and give that chair back to you.

1735
02:01:45,467 --> 02:01:48,494
Every woman needs
a real man in her life.

1736
02:01:50,354 --> 02:01:52,721
Not a whimpering idiot.

1737
02:01:54,646 --> 02:01:55,532
Think about it.

1738
02:01:55,612 --> 02:02:00,829
Hey! I tolerated
it when you insulted me.

1739
02:02:01,597 --> 02:02:04,289
I endured it even when
you insulted my daughter.

1740
02:02:05,154 --> 02:02:07,510
But now you dared
to insult my son in law..

1741
02:02:07,802 --> 02:02:08,775
..I won't spare you.

1742
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:12,451
You speak of manliness
and being a real man..

1743
02:02:12,732 --> 02:02:16,267
..if you have courage,
if you are a man that I fed..

1744
02:02:16,948 --> 02:02:18,819
..defeat my son in law.

1745
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:25,337
Right now,
before the people of my village..

1746
02:02:25,531 --> 02:02:28,191
..I'll give my daughter
to you in marriage..

1747
02:02:28,271 --> 02:02:29,942
..wash your feet,
and sprinkle that water on my head.

1748
02:02:30,022 --> 02:02:30,839
Son in law!
- Yes?

1749
02:02:30,919 --> 02:02:36,601
Get up! Crush that dog
who insulted your future wife!

1750
02:02:40,773 --> 02:02:44,827
Show those idiots that
my confidence in you is not vain!

1751
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:50,698
Ramaraju! You spoke rashly.
Now you can't take it back.

1752
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:54,071
Bhupathi! I will take my own life..

1753
02:02:54,254 --> 02:02:56,784
..but I won't take my words back.

1754
02:02:57,822 --> 02:02:59,941
Anand, get up. Come on.

1755
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:03,206
Come on, get up! Come on! Let's go!

1756
02:03:03,454 --> 02:03:05,843
Beat the drums! Come on!

1757
02:03:19,833 --> 02:03:22,190
Will he get provoked
if that fellow provokes him?

1758
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:25,574
Did he ask me if I can fight?
No, he took the decision.

1759
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:31,163
How can he link this
match with my wedding?

1760
02:03:31,243 --> 02:03:32,666
Which age are we living in?

1761
02:03:33,131 --> 02:03:35,909
Try to win the match.
You have courage.

1762
02:03:37,185 --> 02:03:38,893
That place is filled with dust.

1763
02:03:39,585 --> 02:03:41,715
I get allergies even when
I see dust from a distance.

1764
02:03:41,953 --> 02:03:43,574
And her father pushed me into dust.

1765
02:03:43,758 --> 02:03:46,352
Try hard.
I'm confident that you'll win.

1766
02:03:46,579 --> 02:03:48,568
It is not a bicycle race
that I can win by pedaling hard..

1767
02:03:48,648 --> 02:03:50,536
..it is a wrestling match.
Did you see him?

1768
02:03:50,616 --> 02:03:53,109
He is not competing.
He is thrashing them for revenge.

1769
02:03:53,433 --> 02:03:56,061
I'm going to die.
Call 108. Make the call.

1770
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:03,803
Hello! Are all the
ambulances free today?

1771
02:04:03,883 --> 02:04:04,895
Why are you calling so often?

1772
02:04:04,975 --> 02:04:07,825
He is going to fight now.
Give him at least five minutes.

1773
02:04:07,905 --> 02:04:09,004
He will come.

1774
02:04:31,783 --> 02:04:32,994
Dear!
- Yes, dad?

1775
02:04:33,426 --> 02:04:36,550
I'm going to make Anand
take part in wrestling tomorrow.

1776
02:04:38,042 --> 02:04:41,393
Dad, there is something
I've to tell you.

1777
02:04:41,685 --> 02:04:44,377
I know it, dear.
Bhadram told me everything.

1778
02:04:45,253 --> 02:04:49,480
He got down from the car
on the way to the hospital.

1779
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:53,588
I didn't see anything wrong in it.
That's his nature.

1780
02:04:54,950 --> 02:04:59,047
But we can't lose a good
man like him for that reason.

1781
02:05:00,452 --> 02:05:02,766
Do you think he would have
endured living in this village..

1782
02:05:03,014 --> 02:05:05,760
..for so long if he
didn't love you deeply?

1783
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:08,506
He loves me,
but he won't take part in the fight.

1784
02:05:10,193 --> 02:05:14,917
Let's see.
He fought for my bag that day.

1785
02:05:15,869 --> 02:05:17,609
Won't he fight for you?

1786
02:05:19,361 --> 02:05:22,225
I will prove it to you
that his over cleanliness..

1787
02:05:23,101 --> 02:05:26,150
..is nothing when compared
to his love for you.

1788
02:05:31,986 --> 02:05:32,905
Oh God!

1789
02:05:32,985 --> 02:05:34,559
Hello! Hello!

1790
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,624
Stop! Stop!
- Come on, let's settle this.

1791
02:05:40,704 --> 02:05:41,841
I said stop! Just be quiet.

1792
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:44,749
How did you build this body, brother?
Stand still.

1793
02:05:44,829 --> 02:05:45,841
Come closer.

1794
02:05:45,921 --> 02:05:48,024
Wait a minute. Walk like this.

1795
02:05:48,446 --> 02:05:49,355
Walk in a dignified way like me.

1796
02:05:49,435 --> 02:05:51,063
Why are you walking around me?
Come on!

1797
02:05:51,143 --> 02:05:52,998
Like this.
- Where are you going? Come on! Come on!

1798
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:55,376
Wait, brother. Don't scream.
You will lose your voice.

1799
02:06:02,933 --> 02:06:03,982
Oh God!

1800
02:06:04,976 --> 02:06:06,133
No, stop! No!

1801
02:06:12,468 --> 02:06:14,933
Yes! I won!

1802
02:06:15,171 --> 02:06:18,306
Ramaraju!
You brought in a good warrior.

1803
02:06:18,771 --> 02:06:20,404
This is the first time I've
seen a man play children's games..

1804
02:06:20,484 --> 02:06:22,166
..in a wrestling match.

1805
02:06:26,555 --> 02:06:30,728
Let me go. Let me go.
Let me go. Step back. Step back.

1806
02:06:31,193 --> 02:06:33,279
Hey, stop it!
Stop it! All of you shout his name..

1807
02:06:33,798 --> 02:06:35,269
..and he comes charging
like a raging bull.

1808
02:06:35,349 --> 02:06:37,658
I'm not from this field.

1809
02:06:38,912 --> 02:06:41,669
Come to programming.
I will teach you coding.

1810
02:06:42,242 --> 02:06:46,146
Wait here. I will cancel this match.
Let me talk to uncle.

1811
02:06:46,226 --> 02:06:47,540
Okay? Wait here.

1812
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:48,656
Hey!
- Wait there.

1813
02:06:49,034 --> 02:06:50,570
He is coming after me again.
Disgusting.

1814
02:06:52,764 --> 02:06:55,078
This is wrong, uncle.
This is very wrong.

1815
02:06:55,846 --> 02:06:58,116
It is a sin to push
a spectator into the arena.

1816
02:06:58,451 --> 02:07:01,824
I can't bear to touch him
or to put my feet in that sand.

1817
02:07:03,716 --> 02:07:04,905
Look, I have my shoes on.

1818
02:07:04,985 --> 02:07:06,505
Does anyone come
to wrestle with shoes?

1819
02:07:06,678 --> 02:07:07,792
No, right? Explain that to him.

1820
02:07:08,656 --> 02:07:10,959
What is done is done.
Even cricket matches..

1821
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:12,364
..get cancelled when there is rain.

1822
02:07:12,444 --> 02:07:13,813
This is just a match
between two small villages.

1823
02:07:13,893 --> 02:07:15,067
What is so great about it?

1824
02:07:16,656 --> 02:07:18,775
Uncle, we will plan
it better next time..

1825
02:07:18,855 --> 02:07:20,558
..and bring in professionals.

1826
02:07:22,364 --> 02:07:25,715
I'll convince them not to
take your angry words seriously.

1827
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,185
I'll get the match cancelled.

1828
02:07:27,412 --> 02:07:29,099
All of you sit in our vehicles
and get ready to leave.

1829
02:07:29,304 --> 02:07:31,293
They will surely understand.
We are not professionals.

1830
02:07:33,001 --> 02:07:34,169
Dad! Dad!

1831
02:07:34,504 --> 02:07:35,704
What happened?

1832
02:07:35,784 --> 02:07:37,661
Water. Water.

1833
02:07:37,741 --> 02:07:38,850
Bring some water quickly.

1834
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:42,774
Drink some water.

1835
02:07:44,169 --> 02:07:46,806
Give him some space. Let him breathe.

1836
02:07:46,886 --> 02:07:49,358
Just shut up. Go away. Go.

1837
02:07:51,714 --> 02:07:55,401
Come here. Don't you have any sense?

1838
02:07:56,601 --> 02:07:58,579
Will you die if you
touch a man or dust?

1839
02:07:58,659 --> 02:08:00,601
Why did you come to this village?

1840
02:08:00,681 --> 02:08:02,157
Why are you showing
love that doesn't exist?

1841
02:08:02,557 --> 02:08:03,844
My love doesn't exist?

1842
02:08:03,924 --> 02:08:06,028
Would you come back
if you really loved me?

1843
02:08:06,108 --> 02:08:08,114
They told you that they
will give me away if you lose..

1844
02:08:08,194 --> 02:08:09,801
..but you simply don't care.

1845
02:08:09,881 --> 02:08:11,227
That means you don't love me at all.

1846
02:08:12,989 --> 02:08:15,173
You can't love anybody but you.

1847
02:08:16,675 --> 02:08:20,146
You always think about
your health and your feelings.

1848
02:08:20,352 --> 02:08:23,973
My village, my family's honor,
my dad's life, my wedding..

1849
02:08:24,053 --> 02:08:25,368
..there are so many
problems in front of you..

1850
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:26,871
..but you simply don't care.

1851
02:08:27,865 --> 02:08:29,065
Can't you see any of these?

1852
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,022
Can you only see the sand and dust?

1853
02:08:32,190 --> 02:08:35,811
I'm a girl but I'm so
angry I want to kill him.

1854
02:08:35,891 --> 02:08:38,168
But you are coolly talking
of requesting them..

1855
02:08:38,248 --> 02:08:41,379
..convincing them and
to get the match cancelled.

1856
02:08:45,843 --> 02:08:48,892
Look! If anything
unfortunate happens here..

1857
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,708
..you will see me dead.

1858
02:09:40,243 --> 02:09:41,345
Anand..

1859
02:11:12,532 --> 02:11:14,305
No, dear!

1860
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,095
Let me go.
Will you kill him?

1861
02:11:28,446 --> 02:11:34,165
Cousin, I beg of you.
Please let him go. I want him.

1862
02:11:34,706 --> 02:11:38,782
You want him?
You want him? You want him?

1863
02:11:44,805 --> 02:11:46,253
That's dirt. Keep it away.

1864
02:11:46,652 --> 02:11:49,485
This is not dirt.
It is my love. Touch it.

1865
02:11:50,577 --> 02:11:53,377
It is dirt.
I won't touch it. You know I won't.

1866
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:56,048
Hello! She brought me mud..

1867
02:11:56,128 --> 02:12:00,112
Hey, OCD! This is not mud, my husband!

1868
02:12:00,192 --> 02:12:03,431
My husband!

1869
02:12:03,511 --> 02:12:06,879
My husband!

1870
02:12:07,128 --> 02:12:10,631
My husband!

1871
02:14:57,883 --> 02:15:00,662
Ramapuram has won this time as well.

1872
02:15:00,889 --> 02:15:03,570
Mr. Ramaraju is the Village Head.

1873
02:15:27,895 --> 02:15:29,062
How do you feel, son?

1874
02:15:33,472 --> 02:15:34,250
Did he open his eyes?

1875
02:15:34,456 --> 02:15:35,018
Yes, doctor.

1876
02:15:35,098 --> 02:15:36,142
How are you, Mr. Anand?

1877
02:15:36,986 --> 02:15:39,115
Your whole body got infected
after a 15 minute fight.

1878
02:15:39,195 --> 02:15:40,651
How can you be so sensitive?

1879
02:15:40,856 --> 02:15:42,694
You should always keep
your body close to nature.

1880
02:15:42,774 --> 02:15:44,813
That will help to increase
the resistance in your body..

1881
02:15:44,893 --> 02:15:46,695
..so that it can fight
back in such circumstances.

1882
02:15:48,521 --> 02:15:49,634
Who is she?

1883
02:15:49,714 --> 02:15:52,543
Nature, sir. You asked him
to be close to her. So she came.

1884
02:15:52,623 --> 02:15:54,694
So, let the unnatural people
like us move out. Let's go.

1885
02:15:54,774 --> 02:15:56,921
Come on, let's go.
Let nature cure him.

1886
02:16:00,921 --> 02:16:02,045
Why did you come?

1887
02:16:02,531 --> 02:16:04,110
Did you come to see
if I'm alive or dead?

1888
02:16:04,369 --> 02:16:05,461
Why do you say that?

1889
02:16:05,721 --> 02:16:09,786
What else should I say?
Do you really.. Love me?

1890
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,175
If you did,
why did you send me into dust..

1891
02:16:12,255 --> 02:16:14,154
..knowing that I have OCD?

1892
02:16:14,889 --> 02:16:16,737
If a loved one has a problem,
you should find a solution..

1893
02:16:16,817 --> 02:16:18,575
..not push him into that very problem.

1894
02:16:19,969 --> 02:16:21,786
I'm fortunate that I opened my eyes.

1895
02:16:22,456 --> 02:16:25,061
What if I hadn't? What if I died?

1896
02:16:28,510 --> 02:16:29,721
Don't shed so many tears.

1897
02:16:30,002 --> 02:16:32,207
Your tears are not going to tempt me.

1898
02:16:32,834 --> 02:16:34,867
Prove your love for me
like I proved my love for you.

1899
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:38,315
Use sanitizers,
body lotions or whatever you want.

1900
02:16:40,012 --> 02:16:42,152
Prove that you have
bigger OCD than me..

1901
02:16:42,801 --> 02:16:43,925
..and win my love.

1902
02:16:46,163 --> 02:16:48,034
What? What is that look?

1903
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:48,834
What will you do?

1904
02:16:50,607 --> 02:16:51,882
Will kissing prove that you love me?

1905
02:16:52,693 --> 02:16:54,671
How else will a girl display her love?

1906
02:16:56,001 --> 02:16:57,633
Meghana, listen to me.

1907
02:16:57,713 --> 02:16:59,319
The longer you kiss him,
the more love you have for him.

1908
02:16:59,399 --> 02:17:00,422
Carry on.

1909
02:17:01,277 --> 02:17:02,087
Hey..

1910
02:17:02,909 --> 02:17:03,893
Did you brush?

1911
02:17:03,973 --> 02:17:06,120
What? Why ask me when
I've already kissed you?

1912
02:17:06,985 --> 02:17:09,785
I will be comfortable if I know.
I'll be more cooperative.

1913
02:17:10,034 --> 02:17:11,072
Come.

1914
02:17:11,937 --> 02:17:15,278
Doctor! His OCD is decreasing.

1915
02:17:24,867 --> 02:17:25,980
Grandfather!

1916
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:27,094
Stop running.

1917
02:17:28,704 --> 02:17:29,742
Eat.

1918
02:17:30,359 --> 02:17:34,240
Why happened to your hand?
Didn't you wash it?

1919
02:17:37,169 --> 02:17:38,737
I washed it. Now eat.

1920
02:17:38,985 --> 02:17:40,228
How many times?

1921
02:17:44,218 --> 02:17:45,245
Will you eat or no?

1922
02:17:45,450 --> 02:17:48,975
Go wash your hands,
neatly cut your nails..

1923
02:17:49,148 --> 02:17:54,283
..wear gloves and then feed me.
Then I will eat.

1924
02:17:54,363 --> 02:17:57,721
Junior OCD! Your dad is
the brand ambassador for OCD.

1925
02:17:57,801 --> 02:17:59,344
Even he didn't wear
gloves to eat food.

1926
02:17:59,424 --> 02:18:00,965
Do you think you are greater than him?

1927
02:18:01,625 --> 02:18:04,630
Hey, come with me.
- Where are you taking him, Anand?

1928
02:18:05,645 --> 02:18:08,542
I missed out on mom's
love because of my cleanliness.

1929
02:18:11,147 --> 02:18:12,726
But he shouldn't
miss out on your love.

1930
02:18:14,402 --> 02:18:15,775
He shouldn't become like me.

1931
02:18:16,207 --> 02:18:18,661
I don't know if I have been
a good husband to you or no..

1932
02:18:18,986 --> 02:18:20,878
..but I really want
you to have a good son.

1933
02:18:22,348 --> 02:18:24,359
I want him to give
my mom all the happiness..

1934
02:18:25,289 --> 02:18:26,899
..that she has lost because of me.

1935
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,596
Let's go.

1936
02:19:29,397 --> 02:19:31,591
Goodness is in the
eyes of the beholder.

1937
02:19:31,916 --> 02:19:34,186
The food we eat grows
from the ground too.

1938
02:19:34,402 --> 02:19:36,564
If we can cleans our minds..

1939
02:19:36,932 --> 02:19:38,640
..every person will be a great person.
