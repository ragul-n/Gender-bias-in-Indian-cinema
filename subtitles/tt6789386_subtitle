00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,320
POSTO

3
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
Catch me!

4
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,560
Gouri Aunty, how’s your knee now?

5
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,800
Knee… it’s ok now…

6
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,520
My suggestion is to gift a grandchild
to every arthritic patitent,

7
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
They’ll be cured instantly.

8
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,920
Parents of Arka Lahiri!

9
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,400
Arka…come here… let’s go…

10
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
See you…

11
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Hello… welcome…

12
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
Please sit

13
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Your grandson has stood third in class…

14
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
A+ in all subjects…

15
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Only a little weak in spellings… right?

16
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,240
He needs to work on his spellings a little…
Ok…

17
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,680
Actually… as grandparents…
what you are doing is amazing!...

18
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,760
But I think his parents should
have been here today…

19
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,200
Actually, they are extremely busy in Kolkata…

20
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,640
His mother works in the loan department…

21
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Though I usually write down everything for her…

22
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,400
She’ll get all the information…

23
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
Thank you…

24
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
This has to be signed…

25
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,840
Ok… I usually sign this…
on behalf of them.

26
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,920
Posto!

27
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Posto don't run!

28
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
'Bithi maa'!

29
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Bithi catch him.

30
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,120
Posto stays in his own world,
plays on his own

31
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,600
He laughs, he walks.

32
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,000
While walking along,
sometimes he thinks hard

33
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
What if we could bring down the clouds
from sky and get drenched?

34
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Posto!

35
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Posto likes to draw,
he likes to dance.

36
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,760
He likes to shiver
during winter.

37
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,840
His life sometimes gets stuck
in routines and schedules

38
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,280
In the midnight, spirits come out
and call him “Posto”

39
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Running around in the grass, as evening falls,
fireflies dance and carry him away.

40
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,040
Posto takes a dip in the pond and
dries himself under the sun which seems so far.

41
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,280
Inside the hollow of a tree,
inside his mind,

42
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,080
Posto secretly stores a lot of unknown.

43
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Runs like a train,
flies like an aeroplane

44
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,120
Does his maths and then
throws stones in the pond

45
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,520
He lets the stones skim
across the surface of the water

46
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,160
If he gets caught and
someone starts chasing him,

47
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,480
he comes back home panting.
Posto!

48
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,560
He smells the flowers and
lies down in the open fields

49
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,240
He adds his dreams one by one.

50
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Only if dad could buy him
a rocket...

51
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,480
He could fly to the moon
in search of hidden treasure.

52
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Posto!

53
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:48,240
Running around in the grass, as evening falls,
fireflies dance and carry him away.

54
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:55,480
Posto takes a dip in the pond and
dries himself under the sun which seems so far.

55
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:03,640
Inside the hollow of a tree, inside his mind,
Posto secretly stores a lot of unknown.

56
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
Posto!

57
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
Who's there?

58
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,480
Is it Uncle’s birthday today?...

59
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,720
Yes darling… give him a kiss…

60
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
What are these?...

61
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,320
These are Uncle’s diaries…
music notations…

62
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,160
All these were written by him…

63
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
Come on… we have to
whatsapp Mummum now…

64
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,320
Now come on… let’s start…

65
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,720
English?...

66
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
A+…

67
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
Bengali?...

68
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,160
A+…

69
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,360
Maths?...

70
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,280
A+…

71
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Social Science?...

72
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,320
A+…

73
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Spellings?...

74
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
B+…

75
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,160
Ok now…Music and Dance?...

76
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,440
A++…

77
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
Mummum when you return

78
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,520
bring me loads of gifts…

79
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Come home soon…

80
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
All my savings went into
chit fund from the bank…

81
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
When I kept it at home…
500 and 1000 notes were banned…

82
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,680
How will I pay back my loan?

83
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,040
I can pay back only if
I get my vehicle stolen…

84
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,400
If the vehicle is sufficiently loaded
I'll get maximum insurance.

85
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,040
I’m not getting that opportunity.

86
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,800
How do I pay the theives?...

87
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,280
500 and 1000 currency notes are useless.

88
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,840
And thieves don’t accept payment in cheque…

89
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,160
If you don’t clear the loan
payment within a week…

90
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,920
then my agent will go and
claim your vehicle wherever it is…

91
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,120
That’s final…

92
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
Madam…why are you getting angry?...

93
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,520
Good morning…
Hey… slow down…

94
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,560
Your client was here… loan defaulter…

95
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,800
Why are you late?.... HR is very upset…

96
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
Daughter was puking…
what do I say?...

97
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,800
She just started puking after breakfast…

98
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
Gave her medicine and had to wait…

99
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,280
After she felt better, dropped
her at her crèche and  came here…

100
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,960
What happened to your babysitter?

101
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,480
Who?... Sleeping beauty?...

102
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
My God! She's always sleeping…

103
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,200
My daughter is crying but she is sleeping!

104
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
My neighbour woke her up twice...

105
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,520
I am not lucky and relaxed
as you... having an in-laws run crèche…

106
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,160
I’m not lucky… you are lucky…

107
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
At least you see your child
at the end of the day…

108
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,880
You can have her smell…

109
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
For me, it’s only Whatsapp touch !

110
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,720
See your own child in Whatsapp…

111
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,120
Learn to take advantage of a situation…

112
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,280
What we failed to do…

113
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,640
Sir, Prakash Roy’s wife is ailing from cancer…

114
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,400
All these paintings will at least cost 50 lakhs…
We got it for 15…

115
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,440
Don’t behave like sentimental
'bongs' Arnab…

116
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,640
This is exactly why 'bongs' can’t do business…

117
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,120
They can’t…

118
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,640
Try and understand the situation…

119
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,680
Artist is in distress…
so squeeze him…

120
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,480
This… this… all of this…

121
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,960
He would have given it
all for 5 lakhs…

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
Yes…

123
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,320
5 Lakhs for paintings worth 50?...

124
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,480
Sir, don’t forget I’m an artist…
and belong to an artist's family…

125
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
I can’t cheat…

126
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,800
So you think I’m cheating?...

127
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Sir, we haven’t got our salaries
for the past 6 months…

128
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,280
Labours have not been paid their dues…
you have declared your company lock out…

129
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,360
Now you’re buying the paintings of artists
in distress… at their weakest time…

130
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,520
Isn't this cheating?...

131
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,720
Get out!...

132
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,960
I said get out!...

133
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,680
You are sacked henceforth…

134
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,680
My pleasure sir…
In fact I’ve brought my resignation letter.

135
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Where should I put… I’ll put it here?...

136
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,640
God bless you…

137
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,240
This is the 6th time...

138
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
you’ve quit your job…

139
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,600
Should I just accept everything?...

140
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,000
He won’t pay the labour but
buy a Jaguar for his daughter…

141
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,960
Throw lavish parties… should I accept that?..

142
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
Don’t put chillies…

143
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Do you think I like dealing with  truck
drivers and nasty owners in the loan department?...

144
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,800
So many times I  requested H.R.
to shift me... management didn't agree...

145
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,360
You know where all
I have to travel by myself...

146
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,200
Metiaburuj... Panagarh...
Raiganj... Durgapur...

147
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,280
Have I quit?...

148
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
How much is it?...
Twenty rupees…

149
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,480
Why are you so impatient?...

150
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,760
What will you do now?...

151
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,600
I’ll be a house husband…

152
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,200
But I won’t work anymore,
No 9 to 5 job for me…No chance…

153
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,560
I’ll bring Posto home from Shantiniketan…

154
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,080
I’ll do what we have always wanted…
He’ll stay with us…

155
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
You’ll change your decision in a few days…
take up a job...

156
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,080
What'll then happen to Posto?
Come here!

157
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,640
Decision won’t change…
Give me that binocular...

158
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,000
and that magic slate…

159
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Open your mouth now…

160
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,880
I beg of you Ma…
don’t give such big bites…

161
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
my throat hurts…

162
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,520
Have you seen what drama he has learnt!...

163
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,360
Naughty!

164
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,520
They are here!!!...

165
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,760
That’s it!...

166
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,040
They are here!... they are here!!...

167
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,760
We are here! Come here now!

168
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,480
Pizza! Pizza! I’ll have pizza now!

169
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,600
Pizza… Pizza!

170
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,920
No… you won’t have pizza now…
You are having dinner with chicken stew…

171
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,120
If you have pizza now your tummy will hurt…

172
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,600
Come on… eat this…

173
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,040
We’ll keep the pizza in the fridge…
You can have it for lunch at school…

174
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,200
Let him have pizza , Ma…

175
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,520
No…not  with his stomach full…

176
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,400
You could have waited a little…
He has chicken stew everyday…

177
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,760
He could have had pizza today…

178
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,080
How am I supposed to know
that your train will be so late?

179
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
There’s a time for everything…

180
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,400
Wait… slow down!
What are you doing?...

181
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,000
And anyway, he shouldn’t
have outside food this late…

182
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,720
Ma let him get into the habit
of eating outside food a little…

183
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,560
He is becoming too pampered…

184
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,960
Posto… sit quietly and eat…

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,560
Come on, take this..

186
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,360
Don’t do that… eat this now…

187
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,040
Babai, Mummum are here and his
naughtiness knows no bound!

188
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,720
Now he’ll play around with these toys…

189
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,120
Sit down and eat first…
Finish your food!...

190
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
He’ll not listen.. Posto!

191
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,200
Posto… listen to me now…

192
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,360
Posto… come here
and finish your food!

193
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,320
So...

194
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,640
How is your chest pain?...

195
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,960
Pass me the water please…

196
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,360
The trees are laden with 'bael'
this time, right?

197
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,880
And ummm… ummm…'amla'?

198
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,120
Instead of dancing to your wife's strings
say what you have to... be a man...

199
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,480
We... we wish to take Posto
back with us to Kolkata...

200
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,040
Actually...

201
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,320
I quit my job today....

202
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,280
So I was thinking if Posto
could stay with us…

203
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,080
Baba if he doesn’t,  he’ll never
get to know his parents…

204
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,040
Isn’t it Baba?...

205
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,000
Baba...Baba please...
I was talking to you...

206
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,720
Please Baba… just listen to me…

207
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
First procure a job...

208
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Earn the qualifications to be a father...

209
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,920
then claim the responsibilities of a 'father'…

210
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,920
And if you can’t give
time to your child…

211
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,000
You can do the least
by not bribing him with gifts…

212
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
Babai, please say you'll play…

213
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,200
They have  Granduncles Alu and Khoka
including Guruji in their team…

214
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,320
It’ll be you and me in our team…
That’s it… we will win…

215
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,520
Babai please play…
Yeah fine I’ll play…

216
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,680
Put more pressure here…

217
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,040
Promise?
Yes… promise… promise…

218
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,280
Posto… come on…

219
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Let’s go to sleep now… it’s very late already…
No… a little while longer…

220
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
Don’t be like that darling…
Check what time you should be sleeping…

221
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
In the timetable…

222
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,880
Umm… 11 pm…

223
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,680
Then?... it’s already 12 now…

224
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,360
Don’t stay up anymore…
Come on… you should sleep…

225
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,800
No… please…Mummum
will be leaving tomorrow morning…

226
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,960
Don’t be stubborn darling…
You’ve school tomorrow morning…

227
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
You’ll get late…

228
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Come on… let’s go…

229
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,640
Oof!... Why are you so heartless?

230
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,840
You want to separate
me from my mummum…

231
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,680
See what happens to you…

232
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Hey… What is all this?...

233
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,200
From where have you learnt all this?...

234
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,680
Naughty boy!… from where, huh?...

235
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,440
He is imitating a villain child
character from a daily soap…

236
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,320
Wait and watch what he does…

237
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,560
Ok ok… now wear your slippers…

238
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
Let’s go…

239
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,040
Good night!...

240
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
Good night!...

241
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Was it necessary for Ma to take him away?

242
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,880
He could have slept with us...

243
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,240
Would we have a problem?...

244
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Doesn’t Ma remember that
I am his biological mother?

245
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,280
I need my son's touch..

246
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,320
In fact, I think she does this deliberately...

247
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,800
Hello...

248
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm going to Durgapur tomorrow...
Ask the client to come over there...

249
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,640
No... I won't speak over the phone...

250
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,840
Yeah... also send in the car early...

251
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
What?...

252
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,160
What happened?...

253
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,960
Baba thinks I'm worthless...

254
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,040
Apparently I don't have what
it takes to be a father...

255
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,720
Ok...

256
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
Bonny is here from UK...

257
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,320
It's his mother's death anniversary...
I'll go there...

258
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,880
Then...

259
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll go to Posto's school...

260
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,720
I'll meet his Principal...

261
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,680
Then I'll take him to Kolkata...
Till then...

262
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I'll stay in Shantiniketan itself...

263
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,240
Rafiul Islam from Siuri...
43 years old...

264
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,840
Has died...

265
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Ghulam Mohammed Hossein... from Dubrajpur...

266
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,840
Died from a day's fever...

267
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,960
Shantiniketan...

268
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,280
...has deadly dengue...

269
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,560
Don't stay here for long...

270
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
Leave...

271
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
Move aside...

272
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
Put on the mosquito net...

273
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,640
Get up now honey...

274
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,920
A little more please...
No more... come on we'll get late for school...

275
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,040
Come on... come on..

276
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,880
So many problems since morning!

277
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,200
So much work!

278
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,880
Don't be naughty now... come on...

279
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,360
and these schools start so early...

280
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,040
I'll get your tea sister...

281
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
Sir, your tea...

282
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,760
Don't do that... almost done...

283
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Teeth have to be brushed properly...

284
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,920
Come on...

285
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,840
Here, wear the clothes...

286
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,560
We'll get late otherwise...

287
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,280
Goodmorning Mummum...

288
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,680
God knows if Sir had his tea or not...

289
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,000
Running around like this since morning...

290
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,240
Give the whole pizza... the whole thing...

291
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,080
No... I won't give the whole thing...

292
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,920
Tummy will ache... have a slice...
No give the whole thing...

293
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,680
Why are you cutting the apple?

294
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,400
It becomes mouldy if you cut it...

295
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,160
Ma gives me the whole apple...

296
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,560
It's ok... eat the pizza today...
have the apple tomorrow...

297
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
Come on... you'll get late now...

298
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,320
Get the creative writing copy from Joydeep...

299
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,240
And don't leave the Art and
Crafts notebook in school...

300
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,760
Bring it back... I'm reminding you..
Don't leave the Art and Crafts notebook back....

301
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,840
I will leave it in school...
What?...

302
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,000
I'll also not get the creative writing
notebook from Joydeep...

303
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,840
Okay... Then wait and watch
what happens to you...

304
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,120
Tata Posto!...
Bye bye Babai...

305
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,440
I'll make you sit in the garden at night...

306
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,120
Then they'll come down from
the trees and grab you...

307
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,680
Then you'll see... come on...
here you go...

308
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,280
Why have you made my bag so heavy?...

309
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,960
If something happens to me then
you will be solely responsible...

310
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
Look at his drama!

311
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
Naughty!

312
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,520
Bye bye Ma... bye bye mummum...

313
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,080
Bye sweetheart...

314
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,960
Bye darling!...
Go safe...

315
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
Didn't you get biscuits for your sister?...

316
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll get them...
Get those homemade cookies too...

317
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,120
How long will you be there in Durgapur?...

318
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,520
Two days...

319
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,960
Your son has quit his job...
have you heard?...

320
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,920
There was nothing other than two trees?...

321
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,880
This whole area was then looked
after by the Bearded Man...

322
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,640
He was very strong and this tall!...

323
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
Did he have moustache?..

324
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
Yes... moustache rolled up like this...

325
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,440
With a bamboo stick in his hand...

326
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,080
Was the Bearded Man a dacoit?...

327
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,520
Ummm... Yes...

328
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,760
Ma please keep this...
What is this?...

329
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,520
This is for Posto...
Ma please don't say no...

330
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,240
Trust me, I earn enough...
For both of us...
Ma... please...

331
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,960
Let Anu start earning again...

332
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Anyway your father gets his pension...

333
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,400
Giving out tuitions...
What else do we need?...

334
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Whatever you have given us for Posto...

335
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,240
Everything has been saved...

336
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
We haven't spent a penny...

337
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,320
Whatever you've given us for seven years...

338
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,720
Seven years!...

339
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,520
You know it... that we
are still alive...

340
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,480
Only for Posto...

341
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,400
I couldn't even be part
of his childhood...

342
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Taking him to school...
preparing his tiffin for school...

343
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,360
Bathing him... feeding him...

344
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,840
Sleeping together...

345
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,360
I got nothing...

346
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,520
Even I could have done it Ma...

347
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,600
Trust me, I could have managed...

348
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,880
How are my friends managing it?...

349
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,920
Arunita, Sathi, Debarati...
They are working mothers as well...

350
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,160
They are still managing...

351
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,080
Arunita is a single parent...
divorcee...

352
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,400
She is bringing up a 5 year old
daughter all by herself...

353
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,560
Does everyone have the luxury of
living with grandparents?...

354
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,800
I miss Posto so much...

355
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,880
You couldn't have managed...

356
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,440
You couldn't have darling...

357
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
Anu had just joined his job then...

358
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,560
Used to get his salary every alternate month...

359
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,880
You had this small one room flat in Kolkata...

360
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,320
You had also just joined...

361
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,360
How could you have managed?...

362
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,440
You don't have anybody from
your side of the family...

363
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,960
Look at me...
Look at me now...

364
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,760
Is Posto unhappy here?

365
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Are we not raising him properly?

366
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,840
I haven't said that Ma...

367
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,000
Ma all that I'm saying is that
Arnab has time now...

368
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,160
I'll also get some time out...

369
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Ma please let us take Posto with us...

370
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,280
Whatever you've told me is fine...

371
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,520
I dare you to go say this to his grandfather...

372
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,480
He'll chop you in to pieces...

373
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,320
Don't I've enough trouble already?...

374
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,280
On this soft and sunny winter morning...

375
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,560
Today's famous cricket match's
commentary is being made by...

376
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
Me... Khoka...

377
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,880
From this ground in Purba Pally...

378
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,760
Today's famous match..

379
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Grandpas Vs Kids...

380
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,640
In the Grandpa's team we have...

381
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,920
Haren, Achintya, Bubla
and that famous pair...

382
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,480
Dinu and Alu...

383
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:21,240
In the kids team we have Akash,
Joydeep,Kaju, Chota, tiny Bunty...

384
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,800
...and our little Posto!...

385
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,520
Go safe...

386
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah...
Call on reaching...

387
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,320
Yeah... I'll call surely...

388
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,320
Anu has taken his bowling position.

389
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,480
He is rubbing the ball on his pants...

390
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,880
Dinu takes his stance...

391
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,920
Dinu who plays like Vinu Mankad...

392
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,160
Wait wait... one second... one second...

393
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,040
My Mummum is leaving...
let me just go meet her once...

394
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,880
What is this?...Wicketkeeper, Posto
is running towards the boundary line...

395
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,960
He is running across the field...
a white car is standing there...

396
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
Bye bye Mummum...

397
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,120
Wicketkeeper Posto is
being cuddled by his mother...

398
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,280
Listen now... don't be naughty...
be a good boy... ok? Promise?...

399
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,600
Give me a kissy...

400
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,320
Go on...

401
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,000
What an emotional moment!

402
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,640
How wonderful!

403
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,040
Posto is now back in his
position as wicket keeper...

404
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Anu has taken up the bowling mark...

405
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,800
Dinu is ready with his stance...

406
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,680
Anu has started his run-up.

407
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,280
He bowls a short length ball...

408
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,560
And Dinu has hit it...

409
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,000
It's a four!

410
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,160
Ball has crossed the boundary.

411
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,760
Where has your infamous
son taken your grandchild?

412
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,920
They've gone to Bonny's house.

413
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,320
Irresponsible...

414
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,600
Spineless...

415
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,360
Dependent on his wife...

416
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,240
that's who your son is!
He is your son too.

417
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,800
Hey, listen!

418
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,480
Why do you drive using half clutch?

419
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,800
That's why it gets damaged so often!

420
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
There are so many fireflies...

421
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,520
Do you know what they are called in English?

422
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,080
Firefly!

423
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,640
Do you know why do they light up like this?

424
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,800
They use their light to send
signal to their friends...

425
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,920
And say 'Let's go on a trip'...
'Let's lay eggs'...

426
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,840
And how do they light up?

427
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,760
They have a chemical in their tummy...
that is how they light up...

428
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,120
Who told you all this?

429
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,480
Guruji...

430
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,000
Ok... so do you know what
are fireflies called in Japanese?

431
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
What?...

432
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,320
Hotaru...

433
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,840
Why?...

434
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,080
Because the Japanese believe that when our
loved ones leave us oneday...they become fireflies...

435
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,320
Like Uncle?...
Hmm...

436
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,080
Guruji... Ma... Me and Mummum...

437
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,560
All of us will become fireflies one day...

438
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,720
Me too?...

439
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,120
Fireflies…

440
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,560
Countless in numbers…

441
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,920
Let’s catch a handful of them…

442
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,480
And tame them!

443
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,080
Lighting up the night sky…
Fireflies…

444
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,280
...have dimmed the stars!

445
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,440
Pick up the light from the trees...

446
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,280
And pour them on us in all seriousness!

447
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,880
The uncanny evening is filled with fun...

448
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,720
The light bugs fly around like
pieces of phosphorus!

449
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you listening to the whispering tales?

450
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,360
Only fireflies that give light...

451
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,960
The fantasies they weave along…

452
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,200
Spread your hands to the sky...

453
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,120
And lets lose our way
on our bicycles…

454
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,640
We have arranged for some
food for everybody...

455
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,440
If you would kindly step in please..

456
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,800
Papa...
What now?

457
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,240
Bhuvanda is not giving us fish...

458
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,640
I have asked Bhuvanda not to...

459
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,600
Bonny are you leaving this week?

460
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,480
No... we are going to be here for a while...

461
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,480
Aunty didn't get much time
with Tubai and Tublu right?

462
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,560
I had asked Ma to come
over to UK several times...

463
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,400
...asked her to sell off this house
and live with me...

464
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,960
We'll all live together... spend
the rest of your life with us...

465
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,680
She didn't listen...
look what happened..

466
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,560
No no... I can't possibly go...

467
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,280
I'm having that breathing trouble again...

468
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Your mother's blood pressure
has also become very unstable...

469
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,800
In this state...
I won't be able to travel abroad.

470
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,800
What?...

471
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,080
You're coming?...
My goodness! When?

472
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,720
During the fair?...

473
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,360
You can come...

474
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,480
But... the bathroom is
completely out of use...

475
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,560
We are having to go to the fields
for the morning rituals...

476
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Yeah... I'll let you know if I feel any better...

477
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll call you later...

478
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,760
You lied to your son?...

479
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,280
You won't get it...

480
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,640
If I tell him that
I'm fine he'll drag me to USA...

481
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
What?... Yes...

482
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,840
And if you say that
the bathroom is broken down...

483
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,880
No NRI will ever try to
come home...

484
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,760
Your son is inviting you...
Why don't you go to America?

485
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,240
You know why is he calling us to America?...

486
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
To raise his kids...

487
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,480
Where will you get such free babysitters
like your old parents?

488
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,120
Do you know the creche
charges there?

489
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,600
How much the babysitters charge?...

490
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,200
They'll squeeze away your last penny...

491
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,960
You'll go to America...
in the beginning it's all fine...

492
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,200
You'll be treated really well...

493
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,120
You'll see the Niagra falls...
go to Hollywood...

494
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,240
Visit the Statue of Liberty...

495
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,920
And in a couple of days,
they'll make you the baby sitter!

496
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,440
You'll turn into a statue...
No liberty...

497
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,760
You and your wife
are left raising the child...

498
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
Changing nappies... wiping poop...

499
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,720
And your daughter-in-law
is roaming around in Miami...

500
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,160
...with full liberty...

501
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,280
You...for example, come daily to
school to fetch your grand daughter...

502
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,920
Why tell me?...
Why?...

503
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,160
Because if you miss a single day...

504
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,680
They'll shunt you off to
an old age home directly...

505
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,520
And if you stay at home...
They'll make you eat only boiled vegetables...

506
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,800
I've raised you, educated you...
even gave you property share...

507
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,400
and sent you  abroad... I'm done...

508
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,720
Responsibilities again!...
no way!

509
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,280
These days my heart starts
racing at my son's calls...

510
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,440
If my son really loved me
why would I feel like this?...

511
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,720
Has Posto returned?...

512
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,400
Not yet?...

513
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
Look at him...

514
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,840
Dedicated  babysitter...

515
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,840
Do you remember our catering business?

516
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,360
Huh... what are you saying!

517
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,120
At that age...
our very first business venture...

518
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
And we made profit man!

519
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760
We made profit...

520
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,560
and you ditcher!...
you flew off to Cambridge!

521
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,880
Cambridge brother... can't ignore...

522
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,480
That is when I got involved
with Susmita as well...

523
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,840
Susmita got pregnant before
you got married right?...

524
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,000
I mean... as you had told me...

525
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,720
On one hand she is pregnant...

526
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,800
Don't know where we'll live...

527
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,840
struggling artist...

528
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,600
that is exactly where everything went wrong!...

529
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,240
Finally we settled in Kolkata leaving
Posto  with my parents...

530
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,880
Now I feel that the decision to keep
Posto here, was a correct one...

531
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,560
Otherwise we couldn't have
done this struggle...

532
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,600
I don't think so...

533
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,000
I think the decision was wrong...

534
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,000
See... every child should see his or
her parents' struggle...sacrifice...

535
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,840
However hard it might be...

536
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,200
That creates respect
and love for their parents...

537
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,840
The child doesn't even know
how you earn the money...

538
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,760
the father returning home at night...

539
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,680
his shirt all sweaty from the day's work...

540
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,200
Ma, making his favourite dish,
after getting back...

541
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,400
making a special one...

542
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,560
In the morning father busy
with his conference calls...

543
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,320
Mother is running...

544
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
mother, father and the child...

545
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,960
all of them are struggling for their own existence...

546
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,720
fighting for their own space...

547
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,480
That's life! that's reality!

548
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,760
Why did we go to our grandparents?

549
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,240
to be spoilt by them...

550
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,800
But parents should bring up a child!

551
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,960
I mean... that is my take...

552
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,080
Understood?

553
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,720
What you understood...

554
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,640
I failed to understand
these past seven years...

555
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,360
I'll just go and check on Posto.

556
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
Get up! What are you doing?

557
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,840
What the hell!

558
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,120
Why is it bleeding?...
What happened?... How?...

559
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,680
It's okay it's okay...
What happened?

560
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,480
It's nothing...
We were playing WWF...

561
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,160
Always upto mischief !
Leave the room at once!

562
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,480
Oh my god! It's bleeding...

563
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
Nothing... nothing... he'll be fine...
Why did you go leave me alone?...

564
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,040
I was just in the next room...
Wait one second...

565
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,440
You weren't here and they were beating me...

566
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,960
Nobody beat you...
You just got hurt while playing...

567
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,920
Do I get some antiseptic?...cotton?...
Nothing... check if you could get some ice please...

568
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,840
Nothing has happened champ!

569
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,440
One gets hurt while playing!
I have gotten hurt so many times!

570
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,360
Don't worry don't cry.
Here... let me see...

571
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,040
Nothing... nothing...
There's no blood anymore...

572
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,560
Listen don't tell anything to Guruji and Ma...
You just got hurt a little...

573
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,280
And that can happen to anyone right?...

574
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,920
So Posto... remember
what we discussed... ok?

575
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,680
Ma... Ma... Ma...

576
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,760
Open the door...

577
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,040
What happened?...
What is wrong sweetheart?...

578
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,000
I was beaten up by all the kids there.

579
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,680
They hit me on my nose...
It was bleeding from here...

580
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,400
Why?... How did it happen?

581
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,760
Everybody was beating me...

582
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,520
Why are you lying Posto?...
What are you saying?...

583
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,200
Why would such a small kid lie?

584
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,800
Nothing happened Ma...
He got hurt while playing...

585
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,320
That's fine... you get hurt while playing...

586
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,800
Let me see... what happened...

587
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,440
Come here... come here...

588
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,880
Wait... I'll check your nose with a torch...

589
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,760
Does it hurt here?
Ah!...

590
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,280
Here?...

591
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,560
Oh!... it is all red inside...

592
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,640
Wait I'll give you a dose of Arnica...
You'll be alright...

593
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,840
You know what Ma?...

594
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,040
He isn't going out...
he isn't mixing with people...

595
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,240
Not making friends...
He is gradually becoming old...

596
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,480
He is behaving like a...

597
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,520
Like whom?...

598
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,280
Ma he has to mix with other people...

599
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,120
Haven't I played in my childhood?...
Haven't I got hurt?...

600
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,800
Didn't I get hurt here and there?...

601
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,840
He is so fragile,
I can't believe he is my son.

602
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,280
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?...

603
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,680
You couldn't take care of
your son for one evening...

604
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,800
Irresponsible!

605
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,440
When he got hurt where were you?...

606
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,600
You dare blame him!
I am ashamed that you are my son...

607
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,520
You'll take him to Kolkata...

608
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,720
You'll kill him if you take him to Kolkata...

609
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,600
Bloody irresponsible!

610
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,440
Why did you say such things?

611
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,680
You spoke so rudely...
he left the house...

612
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,120
Good that he has left...

613
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Very good...

614
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,880
Hey... is something wrong with you?...

615
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,840
Are you ok?...

616
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,640
A little tired... that's it...

617
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,240
Guruji...

618
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,320
End to all troubles.

619
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,560
Ok... come on now...

620
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,640
See you,
Okay!

621
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,320
When I was younger...

622
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,760
My voice didn't have much strength.

623
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,680
That is why they didn't
make me the class monitor...

624
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,800
Now I am all grown up...
and I have power in my voice...

625
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,680
That is why they have made
me the class monitor now...

626
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,840
What did you do as a monitor then?...

627
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:09,240
As a monitor I told Joydeep and Arjun...

628
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,000
make sure that you do your home work...

629
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,360
Take care to finish your tiffin.

630
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,200
And when Ma'am is teaching in class
... don't talk...

631
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,600
I also told them...

632
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,280
Guruji!

633
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,640
What happened Guruji?
Get up... Guruji get up...

634
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,360
I'm feeling unwell...
Guruji get up!...

635
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,800
Help! Help!

636
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,280
Anybody here?

637
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
Guruji!
Guruji get up please... get up!

638
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,680
Guruji please...

639
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,800
A bridge lies spread across Ajoy river...

640
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,080
Roads on its banks...

641
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,360
A few fishermen sit with their nets...

642
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,400
Spread like spider webs...

643
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:17,680
A few nurses from the city
come here to enjoy the sun...

644
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,120
They like this river...

645
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,400
May be not just that...

646
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,880
May be it is a masculine name...

647
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,960
Wow! Wow Momo!...

648
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,040
It started in Kolkata...

649
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,160
The biggest food chain right now...

650
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,480
they are now spread
across India in 6 cities...

651
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,040
with 52 outlets...

652
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,200
They have got an investment of
10 Crores from India Angel Network...

653
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,440
Do you know how much they started off with?...

654
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,120
Thirty thousand only...

655
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,640
Can you believe it?
So?...

656
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,680
26 years old Sreemoyee Chakraborty in London...

657
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,400
Has started her own pop-up business...

658
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,440
Restaurant... Calcutta Street...

659
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,680
Why are you telling me all this?...

660
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,240
Are you going to do something?...

661
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,280
We shall do something...

662
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,760
Start-up business...

663
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,120
Food chain in UK...

664
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,800
Investment is mine...

665
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,560
Brain and labour... yours...

666
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,560
Of course conditions apply...

667
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,680
You have to give a minimum
five years of guarantee...

668
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,800
You can't leave in the middle...

669
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
We'll have an agreement...

670
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,520
Get Susmita and Posto to London...

671
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,320
Posto will grow up with Tubai and Tublu...

672
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,440
Susmita can join us...
or she can do her own thing...

673
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,480
Big decision... take your time...

674
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,120
It will take time
to set up the restaurant...

675
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,000
Interiors will be yours...

676
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,080
It'll be a hit!

677
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,320
Mark my words...

678
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,680
But there's one thing...

679
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,840
Start up business in a middle-class family...

680
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,240
means career suicide...

681
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,160
You take care of your daddy issues, brother...

682
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,720
Hello?... yeah...

683
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,440
What?...

684
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,520
I'll be there right away...

685
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,000
I have spoken to them in Kolkata...

686
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,200
So they'll first do a TMT... treadmill test...

687
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,440
If its positive then
they'll go for Bypass or angioplasty...

688
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,280
But now... you shouldn't
delay any further...

689
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,680
Immediately you have to go...

690
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,240
These are your father's medical
insurance paper...

691
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,400
And some money...don't say no.

692
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,240
Come sit with me...

693
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,960
Spend this money on your father...
test and doctor's fees...

694
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,880
Nowadays you tell us
nothing about yourself...

695
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,640
Today...

696
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,800
Something really good happened...

697
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,000
Bonny has offered me
a business partnership...

698
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,560
A restaurant venture in London...

699
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,640
He wants me to take my family along...
He will invest...

700
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Do you have to discuss this now?...

701
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,000
Bonny wants to make
an advance payment right away...

702
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Can you imagine Ma?...

703
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,120
Posto will grow up in U.K...

704
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,200
What?

705
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,560
Posto... Posto will study in London...

706
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,400
Have you lost it?...

707
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,720
Have you told this to your father?

708
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,640
I think that is why he had a heart attack...

709
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,360
Ma I haven't told anybody...
only you...nobody knows!

710
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,160
The two of you can go to London... Dubai...
Open restaurant, food joints, salons...

711
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,000
Posto won't go...

712
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,440
Ma you know that ultimately
Posto will live with us...

713
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,520
If we go to London...
you think we'll leave Posto here?

714
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,720
No....You want your father
to leave us forever?...

715
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,760
Ma...Don't you dare bring
this up again! Shut up!

716
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,400
But listen to me once...Quiet!

717
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,000
See your father has a very
complicated blockage...

718
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,400
For which we aren't going for
any angioplasty or bypass...

719
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,440
Instead we'll keep
him in a medical program..

720
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,800
At least for 6 months...

721
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,880
In case he has a chest pain again...
Or any further complications...

722
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Good afternoon... in that case
we shall go for an angioplasty...

723
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,520
Actually he is above 72 right?...

724
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,400
At this age... we shall not
go for a bypass...

725
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,960
Do you realize...what will happen if the
operation happens now?...

726
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,120
No UK... no business...

727
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Nothing...

728
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,400
Vodka...

729
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,680
I don't think he'll need
the bypass right now...

730
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,240
But still man... every time
things are settling in life...

731
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,280
Then only...

732
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,600
Don't think about all this now...
Why not?

733
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,760
These days...does anyone
receive an offer like this?

734
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,720
Tell me... will they?...

735
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:50,320
Ma and Baba need your support right now...
Exactly!... that is what I'm trying to ...

736
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,200
Once I go to UK I'll be able
to support them the most...

737
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,880
They have to realize that
they have grown old now...

738
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,400
Once Posto's burden is gone,
Ma and Baba will be the most relaxed...

739
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,720
And they don't understand...

740
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:25,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

741
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,880
Posto's case isn't that easy...

742
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,160
I can get that as a mother and you can't?...

743
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,000
It's very very delicate...

744
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,200
Posto has been living with them
for a very long time now...

745
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,240
This has to be handled very slowly...

746
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,000
With time...
little by little...

747
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,640
Posto has to get accustomed to our life...

748
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,200
You and your father both are raving mad...

749
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,480
We also have to understand
Ma and Baba's situation honey...

750
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,360
Nowadays...

751
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,960
Deliberately...the man sleeping in
the living room insults me...

752
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,560
Do you see that or you don't?...
Tell me yes or no...

753
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,640
He insults me...

754
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,800
I know...

755
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,000
Don't react...

756
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,320
No... don't react...
as if you didn't even hear...

757
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,000
Somebody has to keep
his calm... right honey?...

758
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,760
Raving mad...

759
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,160
What is this?..

760
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,760
Where are you going so early ?...

761
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,760
Home...

762
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,200
Meaning?...

763
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,760
You're going home like
this... all alone?... meaning?...

764
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,320
I'll not stay here a minute longer...

765
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,040
Slow down...

766
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,920
Why are you overtaking?...
There's no need for all that...

767
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,200
Baba I'm driving at 60 Km per hour...

768
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,400
This is a high way... we can speed upto 100...
let me drive please...

769
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,480
Driving on the highway
is a different proposition...

770
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,680
It's not everyone's cup pf tea...

771
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,800
Put on the indicators...
I have... long time back...

772
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,040
Do you use half clutch?...

773
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,280
Baba will you please let me drive?...
We'll get into an accident now...

774
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,720
Someone who has no control
over his life or character...

775
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,360
How can he control a car?...

776
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,600
Meaning?...

777
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,360
Meaning those who are alcoholics...

778
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,120
They are not good drivers...

779
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,240
How is my driving related to this?...

780
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
I really don't understand...

781
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,440
What an experience I had in Kolkata!

782
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,360
I woke up last night out of thirst...
was looking for water...

783
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,880
Saw a bottle on the table...
thought it must be water...

784
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,800
The moment I drank it...
oh my God!...

785
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,720
My insides were on fire...

786
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,240
There's alcohol in the kitchen...

787
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,920
Alcohol in the refrigerator...

788
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,040
Bottles beside the window...

789
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:37,480
Bottles even in the garden in
Shantiniketan...

790
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,160
Oh my God! How terrible!

791
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,240
You have to be sent to the rehab...

792
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:53,800
It's a blessing
that Posto doesn't live with you...

793
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,040
How will he live?

794
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,680
Alcoholic, jobless father...

795
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,800
How can a child live there?

796
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,480
I am an alcoholic... happy?...

797
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,880
I'll lead my life the way I want...

798
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,120
You don't like anything about me...

799
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,120
My life... my nature...
me getting gifts for Posto...

800
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,360
Nothing...

801
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,240
You just don't like me...
That's all...

802
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,400
And yes... I am not jobless...

803
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,680
I am starting a business...
Going over to UK...

804
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,480
The deal has been closed...

805
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,400
And I'll take Posto along...

806
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,240
From now on Posto will live with his parents...

807
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,760
I am worthless right?

808
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,360
I don't have what it takes to be a father...

809
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,760
Today I'm challenging you Baba...

810
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,600
I'll take Posto to Kolkata...
I'll take him to UK...

811
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,960
Lets see how you stop me...

812
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,720
Hey... What are you doing?..

813
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,440
Baba... close the door...

814
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
Baba what are you doing?... Baba...

815
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,640
Baba close the door...

816
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,400
Baba...

817
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,040
Baba please I'm begging of you...

818
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,880
Oof !

819
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,560
Baba please get into the car...

820
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,800
You are not well...
Baba please...

821
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,760
Baba... Ma will scold me...

822
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,400
Baba... Ma will kill me...

823
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,240
You're unwell...

824
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,880
Baba, I'm begging of you...

825
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,720
Please get into the car...

826
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,120
You're unwell...

827
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,200
Baba, this is looking really awkward... please...

828
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,480
I'm begging your forgiveness...

829
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,400
Hey... where's your father?

830
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,240
Baba got off ahead...
Meaning?.

831
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,680
You let him get off in this state?...

832
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,720
Baba doesn't listen to me...
He got off...

833
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,560
I was scared of this...

834
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,640
The moment I heard
you're returning together...

835
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,320
I knew something will go wrong...

836
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,400
Posto finish your food...
I'll write to Posto's principal tomorrow...

837
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,640
I'll take Posto away to Kolkata...
I won't stay a second longer in this house..

838
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,880
Have patience... it's still a
week left to his holidays...

839
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,040
Then we'll see... Posto...
No... we have to go before that Ma... Posto!

840
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,360
See... see how he has become...
Doesn't listen to me at all...

841
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,880
Posto... come here...

842
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,200
He does this only when you are around...

843
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,760
Eat... stand and eat...
finish your food...

844
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,080
It's already so late...
he still hasn't returned...

845
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,960
You shouldn't have left your father alone...
Ma, Baba doesn't listen to me...

846
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,760
What you do is beyond me!

847
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,400
Where are you?

848
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,880
What is this?...

849
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,520
Didn't I ask you to...

850
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,440
sit quietly and eat...

851
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,880
One tight slap!

852
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,720
Lower your hand...

853
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,840
Lower your hand right now!

854
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,480
You have no right to discipline him...

855
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,920
Nobody has the right to
hit him in this house...

856
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,000
He is my son!

857
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,280
You were challenging me, right?

858
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,600
Even I'm telling you...

859
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,120
I'll see how you even
take Posto to Kolkata...

860
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,440
Leave aside London...

861
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,600
I'll see you in the court ...

862
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,240
Your honour!...

863
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,680
Today is a fascinating day!...

864
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,560
One can call it historic as well...

865
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,920
Dale Carnegie has said...

866
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,520
When dealing with people...
you remember...

867
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,720
you're not dealing with creatures of logic...

868
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,160
but the creatures of emotion...

869
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,360
today is the day to experience that...

870
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,320
We know that...

871
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,400
In the court of law
there is no space for emotion...

872
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:56,240
Emotion, principles and this fight
with law is an old one...

873
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,120
1890...

874
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:06,480
Guardian and Wards Act...
in its clause 19 says...

875
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,880
In the presence of
the father... anybody else

876
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
...can demand the right to guardianship...

877
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,560
This is that case...

878
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,840
My client, Mr Dinen Lahiri...

879
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,920
Has claimed the right to guardianship
of his grandson, Arka Lahiri...

880
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,400
What is important here is that...

881
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,720
the Honorable Supreme Court has time
and again stressed that...

882
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,640
in case of guardianship and child custody...

883
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,240
First and the paramount consideration
is the welfare of the child...

884
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,080
And not the power or rights
of the parents under any statute...

885
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,360
His parents are alive...

886
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,640
... in a happy married relationship...

887
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,240
Then one might ask... why this case?...

888
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,280
Because ever since his birth... Arka...

889
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,720
Has been brought up by
his grandfather Dinen Lahiri...

890
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,120
Arka's father had officially written
a letter to his son's school...

891
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,920
that in their absence...
they stay a little far away...

892
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,400
Mr Dinen Lahiri and Gouri Lahiri...

893
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,440
will be the guardians of Arka..

894
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,560
My honour...

895
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,760
We have seen this
sort of cases between parents...

896
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,080
But today's case is between
the grandfather and father...

897
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,240
My client Mr Dinen Lahiri is
a socially responsible citizen...

898
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,000
He has been a professor for 33 years...

899
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,080
This should be noted that he has
not claimed parental rights...

900
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,240
He has claimed the guardianship...

901
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,400
Naturally...

902
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,320
A few questions may arise here...

903
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,680
What is proper guardianship?...

904
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,200
Parents have come and visited
for seven years... gone back...

905
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,680
Today they are here to take Arka abroad...

906
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,720
Is he the true guardian?

907
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,720
Or the man who is bringing up Arka...
educating him... nurturing him...

908
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,160
Arka is growing up
under his guidance and love...

909
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,120
He is walking towards a secured future...

910
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,720
Dinen Lahiri is claiming guardianship to
keep that innocent child with him...

911
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,040
Who is the rightful guardian then?

912
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,720
The biological parents?

913
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,520
Or the caregiver parents?...

914
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,040
Who is the guardian then?..

915
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,200
Devaki or Yashoda?...

916
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,040
Who is the guardian?...

917
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,960
That's all your honour!...

918
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,080
Milord!

919
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,160
This isn't even a case...

920
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:10,200
If this case goes on... then parents..

921
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,440
will never want to keep their
children with their grandparents...

922
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,960
They'll be scared... yes scared...

923
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,080
In today's world... which is the
world of working parents...

924
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,000
These grandparents should
stand by their children...

925
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,760
Help them... but instead they
are becoming barriers...

926
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,880
In the path of their future...

927
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,680
This case is trying to take away a child
from the rightful love of his parents...

928
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,800
This case is against progression...

929
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,800
The most regressive appeal
I've ever heard your honour!

930
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:53,040
Now we all know that there are people in Kolkata...
who buy their own house in Shantiniketan... right?

931
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,960
Now they appoint a caretaker to look after the place...

932
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,400
But the owners visit every weekend...

933
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,440
they pay the electric bills... tax... now...

934
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:11,760
After 7 years... if these owners
decide that they shall sell off the house...

935
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,400
and shift somewhere else...
then what will happen?...

936
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,520
Then the caretaker will oppose that...

937
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,160
he'll say that to sell off the house
his permission has to be taken...

938
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,640
Why?... because he now claims
to be the owner of the house..

939
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,040
because he has looked after
the house for these 7 years...

940
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,760
This case should be stopped immediately...

941
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,280
Because this is a combative father's
insensitivity towards his own son...

942
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,040
Objection your honour...

943
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,200
Nivedita ma'am...

944
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,960
a caretaker gets a salary
to look after the house...

945
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,120
But in blood relation... where
you are nurturing your next generation...

946
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,080
Monetary transactions have not taken place...

947
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,680
Objection your honour... monetary
transactions have happened...

948
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:07,680
My client, has regularly given money
to Mr Dinen Lahiri's wife, Gouri Lahiri...

949
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,880
For looking after Arka...

950
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,320
Monetary transactions happen among
blood relatives...

951
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,800
For your kind information,
I'd like to inform you...

952
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,080
that money has been all saved
in the bank in Arka's name...

953
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,480
My client hasn't even touched it...

954
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,920
This is similar to that historic comment...

955
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,040
that the money kept on
the table as bribe...

956
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,880
remains untouched...
claims the bribe taker!

957
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,600
This case rests today...

958
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,200
For me, this case is extremely important...

959
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,080
And very sensitive in the social context...

960
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,200
5th is the next date for
the second hearing of this case...

961
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,120
The court is adjourned for the day...

962
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,680
Seize this car...

963
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,680
Don't listen to anything!

964
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,840
Hello...
Nothing much happened today...

965
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,120
They just presented the case today...

966
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,960
Nothing happened?

967
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,520
5th is the next date...

968
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,440
Hey, I have to hang up
call you later...

969
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,160
So Mr. Arnab...

970
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,960
Brick falls off the neighbour's wall...
sue the neighbours...

971
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,560
Crow drops garbage in your compound...
the neighbours get sued for that...

972
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,840
Maid forgets to pay the bill...
CESC gets sued for that...

973
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,520
Your father has that north Calcuttan
trait to sue everybody...

974
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,880
You'll have tea right?...
Not me...

975
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,320
You?..

976
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,600
Nemai... give me two teas please...

977
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,640
So?...

978
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,560
Next day will be cross-examination...

979
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,720
He'll be able to bear it right?...

980
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,120
Will Father be insulted?...

981
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,440
If a father can sue a son...

982
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,240
he has to face the consequences...

983
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,400
Without my knowledge...

984
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,800
You took money from your son...

985
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,640
For that I was...

986
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,760
...insulted in the court today...

987
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,400
How many times I warned
you against taking it...

988
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:34,160
Your honour, today I shall call upon
the main witness of this case... Mr Dinen Lahiri...

989
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,120
Usually...

990
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,960
...a person retires at 60...

991
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,880
Why did you retire at 63?...

992
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,000
Possibly they liked my work...

993
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,120
And the department couldn't find
a proper replacement immediately...

994
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,080
Your son and wife are alive?

995
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,640
Yes... I have two sons...

996
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,120
One is alive...
the other has passed away...

997
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,960
Were these sons raised by you?...

998
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,360
Yes here... in Shantiniketan...

999
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,480
How do you spend
your days after retirement?...

1000
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,440
If you could share your daily routine with us...

1001
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,360
Daily routine means...

1002
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,400
waking up in the morning...

1003
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,920
After freshening up...

1004
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,960
I wake my grandson up...

1005
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,000
Then I take him to school...

1006
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,760
The school is nearby...
I walk him to school...

1007
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,680
From there, I may go to
the market... or bank...

1008
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,400
I finish all that...

1009
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,480
Then I bring my grandson back from school...

1010
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,560
I usually study in the afternoon...
Read the newspaper...

1011
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:09,280
Once my grandson's afternoon
siesta gets done...

1012
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,000
I take him to the playground...

1013
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,120
After getting back from there...
we usually practice music...

1014
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,840
Then we sit to study for a while...

1015
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,280
Oh dear!...

1016
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,520
It's all about your grandson...

1017
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,760
So you spend almost ten to eleven
hours after your grandson...

1018
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,760
Tell me, after retirement...

1019
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,560
have you ever been on
a trip with your wife ?

1020
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,360
Not really...

1021
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,200
Once along with my wife,

1022
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:45,160
my grandson...
and a group of my friends...

1023
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,320
Had gone to Varanasi once...

1024
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,880
So how did you become responsible
for your grandson?...

1025
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,800
He is my...

1026
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,200
second child, Arnab's son...

1027
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,360
When he was born...
seven years ago... here in Shantiniketan...

1028
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:15,000
At that point, his father and my
daughter-in-law... were not exactly settled...

1029
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,080
That is when we unanimously
decided... that Posto...

1030
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:26,880
By Posto, I mean, my grandson...
will live with us...

1031
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,640
That is why he lives with us...

1032
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,200
And my son and daughter-in-law
had agreed to this at that time.

1033
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,560
Didn't you feel annoyed? Irritated?

1034
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,240
It was supposed to be your retired life...

1035
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,800
I'll not deny that I did
get irritated in the beginning...

1036
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,160
I even used to get annoyed at times...

1037
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,520
Waking up at midnight...
looking after the baby...

1038
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,600
Staying up at night time and again...

1039
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,120
Probably then I...

1040
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:03,440
But later...
gradually I started liking it...

1041
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,520
Slowly I started enjoying it...

1042
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,960
Before retiring I'd always be a little anxious...

1043
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,800
About how will my retirement days be like...

1044
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,960
Will it be a cursed existence?

1045
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,040
But when my grandson came along...

1046
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,080
I felt like...

1047
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,520
God has heard my prayers.

1048
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,560
So he has sent him along...

1049
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,120
I found a new meaning to my life...

1050
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,680
And your grandson's parents?...

1051
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,000
They stay in Kolkata...

1052
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,040
come during weekends...
they even take my grandson along at times...

1053
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,560
I don't blame them...

1054
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,960
They are genuinely very busy...

1055
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,280
So then you are not Arka's biological father...

1056
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,040
then why are you claiming his guardianship?...

1057
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,840
See...

1058
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:02,560
Arka is regularly getting
class ranks in his school...

1059
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,760
He is a very bright and brilliant student...
He is a very good singer...

1060
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:16,880
Taking him away from this environment of
Shantiniketan forcefully would be like...

1061
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,280
Uprooting a tree from its roots...

1062
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,720
It would be like that I feel...

1063
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:30,200
My son is also going to start a new business...

1064
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:39,320
Till the time I am sure of
my grandson's future...

1065
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,720
Till then I... rather us...
me and my wife...

1066
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,640
We are not going to let our grandson go...

1067
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,560
Milord... this was Dinen Lahiri's
statement regarding the case...

1068
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,760
This is a regular incident...

1069
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:02,880
In India, mostly all grandparents
are playing this role...

1070
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,800
Why only in India?...

1071
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:11,280
In USA...there are 7.5 million children who
much like Dinen Lahiri's grandson...

1072
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,400
Are being brought up by grandparents...

1073
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,400
Please check the No.33
page of my petition...

1074
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,560
Milord the numbers are even greater in China...

1075
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:28,800
Most schools in India, nowadays,
celebrate Grandparents' Day...

1076
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,360
Because 80% children…

1077
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,960
Either get co-parenting or
full-parenting from their grandparents…

1078
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:41,160
Therefore my client, Dinen Lahiri’s
case is not an absurd story…

1079
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,120
This is the reality…

1080
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,640
Thus, I would request the honourable court…

1081
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,400
That keeping my client’s experience as a teacher…

1082
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,240
His experience of bringing up his two children…

1083
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,880
And also his role in
Arka’s life since his birth till date…

1084
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,080
To consider all of this…
judge accordingly…

1085
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:04,040
And give Arka’s custody to my client…

1086
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,000
Thank you…

1087
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,840
Opposition may proceed…

1088
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,680
Oh God!...

1089
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,840
Finally…

1090
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,880
I thought I won’t get a chance today…

1091
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,000
You’ve got it now…

1092
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,520
No, I mean...
history of grandparents…

1093
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,720
branching out in various countries…
It's fine!

1094
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,360
Mr Lahiri… you shall have to
bear with us for a little longer…

1095
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,760
How old are you?...

1096
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,280
73…

1097
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,920
When did your mother pass away?...

1098
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,600
60... 62...

1099
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,840
Father?...

1100
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,560
72...

1101
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,520
Do you remember anybody
else's expiry ages?

1102
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,720
Uncle also... seventy...

1103
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,080
Wow...

1104
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,200
You've got an extension in life as well?...

1105
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,240
Early death history in family...

1106
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,360
And you're still going strong at 73?...

1107
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,000
Good… very good…

1108
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,200
Have a look at this medical prescription please...

1109
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,400
Whose is this?
Mine…

1110
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,120
What does it say?...
If you can please read…

1111
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:29,720
Names of medicines... and a few tests
have been suggested for later…

1112
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,520
Test… What tests?...

1113
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,600
Heart related…

1114
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,200
And if the test results are positive?... then?...

1115
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,920
If test results are positive…

1116
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,680
Angioplasty or Bypass might happen
... that’s it…

1117
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,920
Oh God!...

1118
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,280
So if you have a by-pass surgery…

1119
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,760
Then you'll be able to return
home the next day right?...

1120
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,120
No…

1121
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,080
No?...

1122
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,920
How long will you need to stay?...

1123
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,760
Maybe 10 days… or more…

1124
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,280
Oh dear!

1125
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,600
But your son and daughter-in-law will be
abroad at that time...

1126
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,920
Then who will take care of your
dear grandson during this time?...

1127
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,240
My wife…

1128
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,400
Your wife?...

1129
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,720
But as far as I know…

1130
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,760
Your wife is a patient of osteoarthritis...

1131
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,560
Alright…

1132
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,000
Take a look at this ECG report…

1133
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,240
Whose is it?...

1134
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,520
Mine…

1135
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,320
When and why did this had to be done?...

1136
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,520
Kindly elaborate…

1137
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,040
4th November…

1138
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,120
I was coming back…

1139
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,320
Had a sudden black out…

1140
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,800
and fell down…

1141
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,520
My God!...

1142
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,040
How did you return home?...

1143
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,480
In a rickshaw…

1144
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,800
Who summoned the rickshaw?...

1145
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,960
Passerbys?...

1146
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,280
My grandson was there with me that day…

1147
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,000
He called the rickshaw…

1148
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,320
Could you please give us some details?...

1149
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,040
I started feeling unwell…

1150
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,840
And…

1151
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,360
fell down on the side of the road…

1152
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,840
Pick up my Guruji…

1153
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,280
Guruji! Guruji!..

1154
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,680
I wonder what would have happened if my
grandson wasn't there that day...

1155
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:30,200
That means a seven year old grandson...
is saving his 70 years old grandpa....

1156
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,920
Brilliant!...

1157
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,400
meaning the man who
wants to become a guardian...

1158
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,520
What has happened to him?...
He has fallen...

1159
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,800
And whose guardianship he
wants has become the guardian...

1160
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,000
Brilliant milord...

1161
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:50,920
Milord, Mr Dinen Lahiri is the most selfish and
combative old man I've ever come across...

1162
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,360
Old people need sticks...

1163
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,720
his grandson is the same to him...

1164
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,160
He is using his grandson for his own sake...

1165
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,760
We get these toys that run on key in the fair...

1166
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,160
To him, his grandson is just like that toy!

1167
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,720
Your honour,

1168
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,040
Arka Lahiri has a bright
future in front of him....

1169
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,920
He'll study abroad... in London...

1170
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,960
And he is preventing that?...

1171
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,600
His family history…

1172
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,960
His health condition…

1173
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:21,360
wife's health condition... You've heard it all…

1174
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:27,880
I really don’t understand that
how can he claim guardianship of Arka...

1175
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,160
Just imagine Milord…

1176
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,680
Just imagine the trauma the child
had to go through on that day...

1177
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:40,280
It is our duty to take care that a day
like that is not repeated in that child's life...

1178
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,920
Mr. Lahiri how many children do you have?...

1179
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,640
Two...

1180
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,160
Both are alive?...

1181
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,200
No... my first child passed away...

1182
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:52,440
How?... how did he pass away?...

1183
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,680
Objection your honour...

1184
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,080
Death of a child is
a very traumatic experience....

1185
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,400
Reminding a father of that....

1186
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,600
Milord that death has relevance in this case...

1187
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,840
Has no relevance...

1188
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,480
It has milord...

1189
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,560
You need to give me time...

1190
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,960
Objection overruled…

1191
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,440
I'm grateful, Your Honour…

1192
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,040
Tell me… go on…
How did your son die Mr Lahiri?...

1193
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,000
Ok... leave it... I’ll tell you…

1194
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,840
Look at this…Is this
death certificate familiar?...

1195
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,280
Whose is this?...

1196
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,840
My son's…

1197
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,840
Excuse me, I have something to say…

1198
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,680
Please don’t ask my father all this
… please…

1199
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,960
Mr Arnab…

1200
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,760
I'm not playing a friendly benefit match
with Mr Chatterjee here...

1201
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,120
If it's painful for you...
please step outside...

1202
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,400
This is my court…
and here I decide the rules ...

1203
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,880
Look at this?

1204
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,440
Do you recognize this?...

1205
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,480
My son’s…

1206
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,880
How did he die?...

1207
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,280
What is written here?...

1208
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,720
What is the reason of death?...

1209
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,080
Death due to cardiac arrest…

1210
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,760
What is the age that's mentioned?...

1211
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,800
30 years...

1212
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,320
Cardiac arrest at the age of 30!

1213
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,880
Heart attack at the age of 30!

1214
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,760
Why?

1215
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,920
Stress...

1216
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,200
overdose of drugs...

1217
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,680
He was on drugs?...
Was he an addict?...

1218
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,800
What sort of addiction?...

1219
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,680
I don’t know…
You don’t know?...

1220
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:33,880
I’ll tell you… I’ll tell you all…

1221
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,320
Do you recogsise this?

1222
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,680
On this last page...
what is  written here?...

1223
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,400
Go ahead, read…

1224
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,000
This is your son’s journal isn’t it?...

1225
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,560
Do you recognize it?...

1226
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,840
Yes…

1227
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,160
Hmm…

1228
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
Milord…

1229
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,120
On every page of this journal…

1230
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,160
You can find the frustrations of
a 30 year old young man…

1231
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,520
His pain has been noted here…

1232
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,520
At times he has written…

1233
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,640
All diseases will drain…

1234
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,160
In the name of my father…

1235
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,000
And at times…he writes...

1236
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,440
All the mistakes made…

1237
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,560
Will wash away the mark left by death…

1238
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,080
Here look at this last page… look sharp…

1239
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,800
What does it say?...

1240
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,320
I’ll tell you…It says…

1241
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,760
To my father…

1242
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:32,120
Let all songs stop
in the book of songs…

1243
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,320
Then?...

1244
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,440
Give me eternal silence…

1245
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,560
Wash away…

1246
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,160
Wash away…

1247
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:44,040
Silence…

1248
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,560
Give me more silence…

1249
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,360
Then?...

1250
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,320
Let all songs stop in the book of songs…

1251
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,480
Iman-Kalyan...

1252
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,640
I couldn’t…

1253
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,240
What couldn't he?

1254
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,800
What silence?...
Wash away what?...

1255
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,920
Why couldn't he?

1256
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,520
Why does he say this to
his father time and again?...

1257
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:06,880
Objection your honour!,,,

1258
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:11,800
My client is being emotionally blackmailed...

1259
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,520
This isn't blackmail…

1260
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,880
This is the truth... the real picture...

1261
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,040
Please give me sometime... milord please...

1262
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,800
Objection overruled…

1263
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,800
Thank you, your honour…

1264
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:27,520
Tell me, why does he keep
repeating this to his father?...

1265
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,280
Father! I couldn’t…
Tell me...

1266
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:42,520
Apu was my first child...

1267
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,640
My best student..

1268
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,760
Not only the environment of
Shantiniketan…

1269
01:31:53,400 --> 01:32:01,560
He had made Tagore's songs his life...

1270
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,200
He really wanted to...

1271
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,880
become a teacher here...

1272
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,240
and spend his days like that…

1273
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,080
But he didn’t get the chance…

1274
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,840
Though he had all the qualifications...

1275
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,960
This incident caused me a lot of pain…

1276
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,800
I was very heartbroken...

1277
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,840
he, too, broke down..

1278
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:41,960
Unable to get a chance
used to eat away at him...

1279
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,840
At him?...

1280
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,400
Or did it eat away at you?...

1281
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:51,320
Be honest… didn’t you blame
him for not getting through?...

1282
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:56,360
The way you blame all your children…

1283
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:00,560
Didn’t you blame Mr Arnab?...
Didn’t you call him jobless?... Alcoholic?...

1284
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,480
He is not worth being a father…

1285
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:07,920
Haven’t you mocked him in front of
his son for quitting his job?...

1286
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,360
Mr Lahiri…

1287
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,760
You couldn’t
keep your first child…

1288
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:16,040
It wasn’t stress… or depression…

1289
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,120
You, virtually, pushed him
towards suicide …

1290
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:25,800
This is practically a suicide note…
And you are to blame for it… You…

1291
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,000
You couldn’t even keep your first child…

1292
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
How do you even imagine
keeping your grandson?

1293
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,480
And… that’s all your honour.

1294
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,360
Fierce gales speed forth
Clouds darken all directions

1295
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,400
Oarsman! Time to steer the boat.

1296
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,520
You hold tight the rudder
I will unfurl the sails...

1297
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:26,680
Row, row, row your boat
Heave and Ho!

1298
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,040
In it’s chains time and again
Echo the clash of cymbals...

1299
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:43,320
Doubt-laden cries they are not.

1300
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,880
The boat can endure
the anchors no more.

1301
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:00,000
Restlessly it rocks therefore...

1302
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:06,240
Row, row, row your boat
Heave and Ho!

1303
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,360
I’ll have to take Posto to Kolkata, Ma…

1304
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,800
For his passport…

1305
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,160
Anu...

1306
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,680
Will you be able to take care of him?...

1307
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,960
I’ll be at home…

1308
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,640
I have nothing to do
apart from going to the court…

1309
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,680
Blessings...

1310
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,640
My respect... Guruji.

1311
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,800
I’ll have to tell your father…

1312
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,040
What’s there to tell, Ma?...

1313
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,880
Ma, please understand this clearly…

1314
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,520
Baba is going to lose this case…

1315
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:01,520
So, lessen your attachment towards Posto…

1316
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,160
Gradually, let him go.

1317
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,880
Otherwise, while giving him up completely...

1318
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,440
It'll hurt more...

1319
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,760
No… no…

1320
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,200
Don’t look downwards…

1321
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,240
Look up… look up… yes…

1322
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,480
Yes… open your voice…

1323
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,760
Sing in clear tones.

1324
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,840
Come here…

1325
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,160
Anu wants to take him to Kolkata…
Why are you obstructing?...

1326
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,320
Let them go...

1327
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,920
Have you gone mad?...

1328
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,920
A legal fight is going on…
You don’t get its seriousness?...

1329
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,560
You’ll send the person
concerned to Kolkata?...

1330
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,360
They’ll brainwash him over there…

1331
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,880
Put the London bug in his head…

1332
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:19,600
All this is happening on
the advice of that evil lawyer woman…

1333
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,400
Don’t I know that?...

1334
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:27,240
Why are you dragging your
court case into the house?...

1335
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,440
Shit!

1336
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,680
What did you say now?...

1337
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,320
What did you just say son?...

1338
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,000
Shit… I said shit…

1339
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,040
Where did you hear this from?...

1340
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,000
Who taught you all this?...

1341
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,640
Dad...

1342
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,560
I’ve heard it from Dad…

1343
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,520
Do you have anything to say even after this?...

1344
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,480
If he really needs to go…

1345
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,320
We shall take him along…

1346
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,080
Left hand…

1347
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,120
now right…

1348
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:45,360
Will you buy that big train for me?...

1349
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,480
Yes, you brat!
I’ll buy you all the toys…

1350
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,600
And only then I’ll be your best Mummum…

1351
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,000
Hello… hello…

1352
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,640
Bonny has transferred Rs 2 Lakhs…

1353
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,800
Wow…that’s superb!

1354
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,080
Passports are done…

1355
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:06,120
All done…

1356
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,680
I’m just worried that if
the case still goes on…

1357
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,240
Posto!...

1358
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,720
Come here and eat…

1359
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,920
Be careful and eat…
And finish that drawing…

1360
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,400
You come and check
my painting once it's done.

1361
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,160
Okay.

1362
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,280
Dad, I have something to say to you…

1363
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,680
In fact, this concerns all of you…

1364
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,880
What is this legal case Dad?...

1365
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,160
It’s your and Arnab’s
ego fight…that’s it!

1366
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,600
But...

1367
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,640
none of you are considering
my feelings…

1368
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:06,520
Dad, at Arnab's single request
I'm quitting my steady job.

1369
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,040
Haven’t thought about
my career even for once…

1370
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:12,160
I’ve only thought that Arnab is, finally,
getting some space for himself…

1371
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,440
I’ll stay beside him.. support him…

1372
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,600
So that he gets some confidence.

1373
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,360
I’ll take care of my family…

1374
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,600
Whatever job I take up
in UK, will be new for me…

1375
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,600
That’s a new life for me…

1376
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,200
Why do I need that?...

1377
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:33,120
All of you are aware that my office
has repeatedly wanted to promote me…

1378
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,920
But I didn’t take it…

1379
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,760
Because accepting that
would mean shifting to Mumbai…

1380
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,800
Going away from my family… from Posto…
That is why I’ve stayed back…

1381
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:45,160
Let me speak Arnab…

1382
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:48,000
Both of you’ve said a lot till now…

1383
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,800
Let me speak today?...

1384
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,400
I never had any problem
with Posto staying with you…

1385
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,760
He is getting the same love that
he’d get from  my parents if they were alive…

1386
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,480
Ma even if nobody else knows…

1387
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,240
But you do…

1388
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,120
Leaving Posto behind with you...

1389
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,880
I took injections to stop my breast milk…

1390
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,720
I’ve gone through that pain as well…

1391
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,240
If as a mother…

1392
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,040
as a woman…
I’ve been able to make this sacrifice…

1393
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,640
Then you should be able to do it too…

1394
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,240
Why aren’t you being able to do it?...

1395
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,560
Dad, I just have one question…

1396
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,400
Why can’t Posto live with his mother?...

1397
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,680
What wrong have I done?...

1398
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:12,000
Do you think I’ll not keep him happy?...

1399
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:18,280
Baba you’re forgetting one thing…
Apart from Arnab, there’s me…

1400
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,920
As a mother I have an equal right…

1401
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,720
Till date nobody ever
questioned by ability in my office…

1402
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:37,560
But you are continuously doing it…

1403
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,720
I know Dad… what Posto means to you…

1404
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,960
Apu…

1405
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,120
My elder brother...

1406
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,240
Your unfinished sculpture…

1407
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,160
You’ve once lost to destiny…
but not again…

1408
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,040
That is why the music practice…

1409
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,200
Those cricket matches…

1410
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:10,360
Going to the playground…

1411
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,280
The same songs…

1412
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,600
Your same wait outside the school…

1413
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,480
You are looking for 'Apu' in Posto, Dad…

1414
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,160
Please don’t stop Posto…

1415
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:34,400
Because you didn’t let Apu leave this place..

1416
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:37,480
That was his frustration…
And you know that…

1417
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,960
He didn’t get a chance to teach there…
because of internal politics…

1418
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,800
Because you were a teacher there…

1419
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,560
your son did not get a chance…
and who got punished for that?...

1420
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,080
My brother… Apu…

1421
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:57,720
Dad, even you got a place
at SR in Kolkata…

1422
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,880
Why didn’t you go?...

1423
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,440
Like Barin uncle, if you had accepted,
things would have been different…

1424
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,760
You know it very well dad...

1425
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:09,520
that Barin uncle,
today, has a music school in USA.

1426
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,680
Why didn’t you go Dad?..
Why?...

1427
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:18,680
Whatever Shantiniketan had given me…

1428
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,800
I wanted to return that favour…

1429
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,280
It’s a different world now, Dad…

1430
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,560
Now after Apu passed away…

1431
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,480
...all your anger was channelled towards me…

1432
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,680
It was as if...

1433
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,640
...why didn’t I go instead of my brother…

1434
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,600
I still don’t get it, Dad…
Why do you dislike me so much?...

1435
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,680
I know...

1436
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:02,520
...that I’m not the best…

1437
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,080
I’m very very average…

1438
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,640
Very average…

1439
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:17,920
Inspite of being an artist,
why don’t you paint?...

1440
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,880
I wished to create
a platform for new talent…

1441
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,960
That is why you decided to take up a job?...

1442
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,040
Yes…
What?...

1443
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,480
What job was this?...

1444
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,840
Consultant Art curator…

1445
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,600
I used to advise them
on buying paintings...

1446
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,400
Why did you quit?...

1447
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,240
They were cheating…

1448
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:41,400
The platform they had created was all a lie…

1449
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,600
The platform they had created was all a lie…

1450
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,640
I have grown up to my father’s principles…

1451
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,760
So couldn’t compromise…

1452
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,840
Mr. Arnab… so you’re
shifting abroad?...

1453
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,680
Yes… with my son and wife…

1454
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:00,560
What will be your daily routine there?...

1455
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,160
Could you give us an idea?...

1456
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,480
As far as I know...

1457
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:09,080
I’ll wake up around 6.40…
and get ready…

1458
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,640
That’ll take around 50 minutes…

1459
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,920
Hmmm…

1460
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,960
Then we’ll get our son ready…

1461
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,360
Drop him to the crèche…

1462
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,720
Another 40 mins…

1463
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:25,920
7 hours of work… maximum 8…

1464
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,160
They have really good
daycare centres over there…

1465
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,360
Child clubs and crèche…

1466
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,440
I’ll check according to the budget…

1467
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:40,840
Me and my wife will give time alternately…

1468
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:46,000
Milord… today we are confronted with
a very important question…

1469
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,200
Time…

1470
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,480
… the quantity or quality of time…
Which is important?...

1471
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,640
In this age of working parents…

1472
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,640
Both the parents have to work…
It has become absolutely necessary…

1473
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,200
How helpless are these parents…

1474
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:03,440
They are running in a rat race…

1475
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,840
They have house loans,
car loans to pay off…

1476
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:10,400
The expenses of the child…
future investment…

1477
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,560
Savings for dependent parents like Mr Lahiri…

1478
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,040
They are continuously running…

1479
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:22,600
And they may not necessarily have
someone…with 8 or 10 hours to spare.

1480
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,840
Then what will they do?...

1481
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:32,640
Milord… in Britain… an average
working parent has 81 mintues…

1482
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,680
To spare for his child…

1483
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,080
81 minutes…

1484
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,040
In some countries it’s 91…

1485
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,560
Sometimes it’s 138… may be 180…

1486
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,680
This is what we call 'quality time'…

1487
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:57,000
These 81 minutes can create a beautiful
world between parents and children…

1488
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:01,200
Psychologists say that these
81 minutes is enough to make up…

1489
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:05,960
...the 10 or 11 hours given by
the likes of Mr Lahiri…

1490
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:17,320
Actually our fight is primarily Mr. Arnab’s
81 minutes versus Mr. Lahiri’s 10 or 11 hours…

1491
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,640
Of course, Mr. Lahiri has a lot of time…

1492
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:24,520
He has retired now…
He can definitely sue people…

1493
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:29,640
But Milord, think about my client please…

1494
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:33,040
He is dreaming of going abroad…
Work there…

1495
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,400
A new life… he has so much to plan…

1496
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:42,080
Instead of all that… he is now
here engaged in a pointless feud…

1497
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:44,600
I have said this earlier as well…

1498
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:48,120
This case is nothing but wastage of time…

1499
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:54,680
The most regressive appeal I’ve ever heard of…
Your honour, I beg of you…

1500
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,720
Please dismiss this case immediately…

1501
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,880
And let my client go…

1502
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,800
And that’s all your honour…

1503
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:10,000
Now the prosecution may proceed…

1504
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,840
How many times have you quit your job?...

1505
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,480
6 times…
6 times!

1506
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:30,920
What job have you taken up now?...

1507
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:37,080
It’s not a job… business
… start-up business…

1508
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,560
What business?...

1509
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:40,600
Restaurant…

1510
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,720
Restaurant?... Oh…

1511
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,440
So you’ve done a course on this?...

1512
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,560
Oh… she’ll answer?

1513
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,720
No…

1514
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:58,200
That means… all these
years of art… gone…

1515
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,360
Now it’s food and all..

1516
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,760
Start up…

1517
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:10,120
This means the car will
now start  afresh Milord…

1518
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,560
This car can run smoothly…

1519
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,800
Or can flip over…

1520
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,800
Do you drink?...

1521
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,560
Yes…

1522
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,120
Does your father know?...

1523
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,800
Yes, he knows…
But I don’t drink in front of him…

1524
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,400
Oh…

1525
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:46,080
Drinking is very personal to me…

1526
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:48,000
You seem to be a very brave man…

1527
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:52,440
You don’t want to hide
your alcoholic trait…

1528
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,760
I don’t hide and do anything…

1529
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,120
Good…

1530
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:02,640
So you agree that you are an alcoholic?...

1531
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:11,840
I drink… but I am not
an alcoholic…I just drink…

1532
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:13,440
But aren’t an alcoholic…

1533
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,720
Your honour I go to the temple
but I'm not a devotee...…

1534
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:23,520
Have you ever hit your
son after drinking?...

1535
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,520
Yes?...

1536
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,960
No… Not after drinking…
Then?...

1537
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,360
Before drinking?...

1538
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,200
Was about to…
in the heat of the moment…

1539
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,040
Oh Ok…

1540
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,760
My son was being naughty…
I was scolding him…

1541
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,480
Thank God!

1542
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:48,600
Father came and stopped
you!...Otherwise…

1543
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:54,280
But in this country you were spared
even after hitting your child…

1544
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,320
Abroad you’ll be jailed for this…

1545
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,120
Anyway…

1546
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:05,080
Himadri also known as Bonny…
who is he?...

1547
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,520
Friend of mine…

1548
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,880
2nd November…
there was some event at his place?...

1549
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,520
You don’t remember, is it?...

1550
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,560
You don’t remember…

1551
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:25,360
It was his mother’s death anniversary…

1552
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,320
Am I right?...

1553
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,680
Yes…

1554
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,400
What is a death anniversary Arnab?...
What happens there?...

1555
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,840
One year completion of death of a person…

1556
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:45,640
What happens during death
anniversaries in Shantiniketan?...

1557
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:48,360
They talk about memories…

1558
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,480
sing Rabindra sangeet…

1559
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,520
… read the holy scriptures…

1560
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,040
And food?...

1561
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,040
Vegetarian food was served.

1562
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,240
And non-veg for you?...

1563
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,600
We had fish fry… Hilsa fry…
Bonny’s mother’s favourite…

1564
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,840
And her favourite whiskey?...

1565
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,360
Which brand did she have?...

1566
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:26,000
There was a space outside the house…

1567
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:29,880
We were sitting there…
after everybody had left…

1568
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,480
Such grief because of his mother’s death…
That everyone was drinking…

1569
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,600
Where was your son at that time?...

1570
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,440
There was a separate kid’s room…
all the children were there…

1571
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,480
Oh right…

1572
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:49,080
So while the elders were being naughty,
the children were kept away…

1573
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:53,240
So after how long did you see your son?...

1574
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,920
I went and checked on him in a while…

1575
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:00,920
What did you see?...

1576
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,960
A few children...

1577
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:08,600
were on top of him…
and were beating him…

1578
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,440
Oh ho…

1579
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,880
Then?...

1580
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,640
I brought him back home…

1581
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:22,720
You just said you don’t hide anything…

1582
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,960
Did you delete anything in between?...

1583
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,000
What a shame!...

1584
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,400
So tell us about the part you deleted…

1585
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,520
Tell us…

1586
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,000
His nose was bleeding… I washed it…

1587
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,480
Oh ho…

1588
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,600
And what did you tell your son?...

1589
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:49,760
What did you tell your son?...

1590
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:54,400
Not to tell my parents…
Because my father had just…

1591
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,680
Oh dear!

1592
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,840
You taught your son to lie…

1593
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,440
Taught him to hide?...

1594
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:08,080
Your honour… this is that father
who goes to hit his son while drunk…

1595
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:10,280
Teaches his son to lie…

1596
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,640
Can’t even keep a job!..

1597
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:16,000
They go to such parties where parents
have to be separated from the children…

1598
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:19,040
Because they are progressive…

1599
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,560
They believe in quality time…

1600
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:24,000
They are progressive…

1601
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:25,240
What sort of a society is this?..

1602
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:29,000
Where people drink at
their mother’s death anniversary?...

1603
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,800
Such progression!...

1604
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:35,160
Very recently…

1605
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,520
I recollect an incident like this
that happened in Kolkata…

1606
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:46,440
A 'progressive' man's daughter's birthday
party was being celebrated at his residence...

1607
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:48,920
...whose grandmother has passed away
three days back…

1608
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,120
All his daughter’s friends were invited…

1609
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:56,920
They were drinking at the party…
within the compound…

1610
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:02,520
a drunken friend of
the daughter accidently dies…

1611
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:05,840
That boy was only seventeen years old!...

1612
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:25,000
https://t.me/RickyChannel

1613
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,680
Your honour,  Arka is
only seven years old!...

1614
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:12,000
And this is where that bloody future begins…

1615
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:15,200
They go to parties in
which parents get separated…

1616
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,440
Children get separated…

1617
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,360
Because they are progressive…

1618
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,960
Nobody knows where the other person is…

1619
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,000
Because they are progressive!...

1620
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:30,160
Why can’t they stay together in parties?...

1621
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,560
Why can't they share everything with each other?...

1622
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,920
Because they are progressive?...

1623
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,720
They are selfish!

1624
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,120
Irresponsible!

1625
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:45,360
Your honour, those who can send
a 7 years old child to die in a kid’s room…

1626
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:51,080
They can be anything
but progressive parents!

1627
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,520
Madam Nivedita…

1628
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,400
… in 81 minutes you can become
the biological parents of a child…

1629
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,720
But in 81 minutes you
cannot possibly raise a child…

1630
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,040
That’s all your honour!

1631
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
The ball is moving towards you.

1632
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:21,440
Goal!

1633
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,960
The way you don’t get
good babysitters these days…

1634
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,560
Thank you…

1635
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:33,040
Same way if you hand over your child
to someone else…Then it’s gone!

1636
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,680
You only have to face the consequences…

1637
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:38,320
Diya… Posto…

1638
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:41,040
Come here…

1639
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:44,000
Ice cream…

1640
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,840
Here you go…
Don’t drop it… be very careful…

1641
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:49,000
Be a good boy… good girl…

1642
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,200
I started bringing Diya
to my place gradually…

1643
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,520
In the beginning, my mother
wouldn’t allow it…Can you believe it?...

1644
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:59,000
Then my daughter started being adamant…

1645
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,120
She won’t stay without me…

1646
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,480
Then everything was so good…

1647
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,880
I had also promised myself that…
I will get my daughter back…

1648
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,320
And I did it…

1649
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:11,000
Now she goes over to
her grandparents on weekends…

1650
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,440
At times she doesn’t want that as well…
Prefers staying with me…

1651
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,680
And it’s so good!...

1652
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,600
Hello… yes?...

1653
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,000
Are you back?...

1654
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:26,120
Posto is with me…
Why?...What happened?...

1655
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,840
Dad wants to prove
in court that how bad I am…

1656
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,440
How bad I am as a father…

1657
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,840
When I drank at Bonny’s place…

1658
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:38,200
When I’ve tried hitting Posto…
He is hitting at the same point continuously…

1659
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,320
Yes… Ma…

1660
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,680
Ma, he slept late last night and
his eyes have a little soreness…

1661
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,480
My friend Sukriti is an eye specialist…

1662
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,560
She has checked him and has
said that there’s nothing to worry about…

1663
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:00,760
Ma, how can we stop his
tooth from falling?...

1664
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,840
It would have fallen even in Shantiniketan…

1665
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,600
Posto is fine with…
What do you want Ma?...

1666
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:08,480
What do you and Dad want of us?...

1667
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:13,040
I just want to stay alone
with my son and wife…but you won't let us!

1668
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,720
Dad has anyway
insulted me enough in court…

1669
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,320
What else do you want?...

1670
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,080
His teeth has fallen off… good!
I’ll break the rest of them but I’ll take care…

1671
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,640
Posto!

1672
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:24,760
What are you doing?...
One tight slap!...

1673
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,920
Arnab... no no!

1674
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:33,440
No no no... it's okay!
Posto… Posto…

1675
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,880
Ma is fondling you...

1676
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:40,640
Dad can scold at times, isn't it?

1677
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,720
Dad is saying sorry…

1678
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,040
See, see… dad is crying…

1679
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:53,280
Don't cry like that...
nothing has happened…

1680
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,800
Why me?...

1681
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:58,440
Posto come here…give dad a kiss...

1682
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:06,640
It was wrong of me ...very wrong!

1683
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:21,240
Do you blame me for Apu’s death?...

1684
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,160
Rumour has it…
That after his son’s death…

1685
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:31,000
Rabindranath conducted a planchet…

1686
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:37,440
Even I want to do a planchet…

1687
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:40,760
I’ll ask Apu…

1688
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:44,200
If he blames me or not…

1689
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:53,680
I can’t see you like this…

1690
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:56,480
Give back their son…

1691
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:01,920
Don’t get attached anymore…
We’ve done whatever we had to…

1692
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:04,720
Apu’s journal…

1693
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:07,800
Apu’s death certificate…

1694
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,880
How did Anu get it?...

1695
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,240
You gave them to him?...

1696
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,800
Welcome! Welcome!...

1697
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:34,400
Happy anniversary...
Congratulations...thank you...

1698
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:39,760
What did we do on our anniversary?

1699
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,280
I, really, can't remember!

1700
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:42,640
Oh, really!

1701
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:47,760
Kids… come on…
get into that room…

1702
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,280
A lot of games have been arranged…
Go in there…

1703
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:54,480
We'll play spot jumping!

1704
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,600
Arghya…
Yeah tell me…

1705
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,400
Susmita and I have to leave…

1706
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,320
We have to go see the lawyer once…

1707
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,400
What are you saying !

1708
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,240
Posto… come here…

1709
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,160
Why? What are they saying?

1710
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:34,680
Come one, man..
don’t be a spoilt sport…

1711
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:38,000
I've an appointment...
that's why...

1712
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,400
Okay then… bye… take care…

1713
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,760
Thanks a ton!
Bye.

1714
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:59,720
What shall we do now?...

1715
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,320
What should we do?...

1716
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,120
We shall now play…

1717
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,720
We’ll paint…

1718
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:17,440
We shall make fireflies!!...

1719
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:21,160
We shall now sing and dance!

1720
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,120
Total fun!!...

1721
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:41,240
Tonight with this light and colours
Let’s play a game of fun.

1722
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:45,760
We’ll chase butterflies
and life won’t be boring at all.

1723
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:02,480
Come let’s do this,
make festivities in the bedroom

1724
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:06,960
Tell me what are your plans,
Let there be music and fun full on.

1725
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,520
We’ll not turn on the lights anymore
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1726
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:15,760
Be friends with the darkness here
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1727
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:29,120
Wish we’d spice up life
And ride on the fireflies.

1728
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:33,400
We’ll become jokers
And spread madness around!

1729
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:37,560
Come on let’s do this
We’ll change all the orders.

1730
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:42,000
Damn we are right!
Do whatever with our lives!

1731
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:46,600
Even if there’s a black out tonight
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1732
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,920
Our family has one headline
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1733
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,240
We’ll dance all night now!
Shanti Home!

1734
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:32,360
Mess up the steps, still no regrets!
Shanti Home!

1735
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:35,720
This party goes on all year!
Shanti Home!

1736
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:38,960
And the three musketeers are back!
Shanti Home!

1737
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,200
Come let’s do this
Make festivities in the bedroom.

1738
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:51,600
Tell me what are your plans
Let there be music and fun full on.

1739
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:56,200
Even if there’s a black out tonight
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1740
02:06:56,240 --> 02:07:00,560
Our family has one headline
Let’s party ‘Home Shanti Home’.

1741
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,360
What happened?...

1742
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,360
Nivedita called…

1743
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:45,560
The judge wants Posto to
attend the next court session…

1744
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:47,360
What?...

1745
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:33,760
In this legal case regarding Arka Lahiri…

1746
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:38,760
We’ve listened to both the parties…

1747
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:44,560
I’d like to hear what Arka has to say…

1748
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:51,560
But before that I’d like to
speak to Arka personally…

1749
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,760
Mr. Aloke please send Arka to my chamber…

1750
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:17,280
I don't want to go.
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

1751
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:23,600
Go, my dear,
… nothing will happen…

1752
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:26,760
You are a brave boy…
Nothing will happen…

1753
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:39,280
Sir, can I come in?...

1754
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,760
Come here Arka…

1755
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:51,360
Good Boy!
See… all these are for you…

1756
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:56,760
Come here with me…

1757
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:09,160
Your parents wish to
keep you with themselves…

1758
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:10,760
And your grandfather…

1759
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:17,520
What is this going on?...

1760
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,520
He has taken the child
to a separate room…

1761
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:23,440
He’ll get nervous…
Alu… stop this immediately…

1762
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:25,760
Yes… yes… sit down…

1763
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:28,200
What do you want?...

1764
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,600
I can give you…
whatever you want…

1765
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,320
You can’t…

1766
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:36,000
Why can’t I?...

1767
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:40,440
I’ll give you whatever you want…

1768
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:41,880
Tell me what do you want…

1769
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:51,520
I want to live with Guruji,
Ma, Dad, Mummum altogether…

1770
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,600
Can you give that to me?...

1771
02:10:56,120 --> 02:11:01,320
This court believes in
the welfare of minors…

1772
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:06,120
So where will the child stay…

1773
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:12,520
In what conditions…
Whether it is favourable or not…

1774
02:11:12,520 --> 02:11:14,000
We shall consider that…

1775
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:22,160
After speaking to Arka,
I’ve learnt of his wish…

1776
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:30,520
Even then in this case…
I’d want him to say it aloud…

1777
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:36,680
Come here son…

1778
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,600
Come…

1779
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:01,400
Tell me… whom do
you want to stay with?...

1780
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:06,400
Your parents or your grandparents?..

1781
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:34,080
Your honour…

1782
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:42,400
I withdraw my case…

1783
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:49,000
I can’t keep my child in this pain anymore…

1784
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:52,640
You please hand him over to his parents…

1785
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:56,000
I don’t want anything…

1786
02:12:56,040 --> 02:13:00,240
Come here… come to me darling…

1787
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,600
Your Honour…

1788
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:29,240
I’m extremely sorry…

1789
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:33,920
I have taken so long
to come to a decision…

1790
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:36,080
But, actually the thing is…

1791
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:41,080
This affection is a very terrible thing…

1792
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:46,720
Especially when it is towards your children…

1793
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:49,560
I know...

1794
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:55,080
One should let go of
all possessiveness after a certain age…

1795
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:59,040
My wife keeps telling me that…

1796
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:04,280
But what can I do?...
It’s my heart after all…

1797
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,960
It's a matter of my heart!

1798
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:14,760
I had once heard of
this selfish mother…

1799
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:20,400
Who stole her son’s passport
to stop him from going abroad…

1800
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:25,400
May be this case of mine will
become that sort of an example…

1801
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:28,800
Do you know why I sued my son?

1802
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:31,360
Because I know it in my heart…

1803
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:34,880
That they are going now…

1804
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,720
They will never return...

1805
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:45,280
So that I can hold them back…

1806
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:50,200
That’s why I made a last attempt…

1807
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:08,320
I have got my answer…

1808
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:14,480
Even then… the law
shall follow its course…

1809
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:22,760
Mr. Arnab… Mrs. Susmita… you can now
take full responsibility of Arka…

1810
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:31,720
And give him a little time…

1811
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:34,680
Keep him in good care…

1812
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:38,160
He is a beautiful child..

1813
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:45,480
And please try and understand
what his soul wants…

1814
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:52,240
The case is dismissed today...

1815
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,360
as withdrawn…

1816
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:30,560
Why couldn't something
like this happen?

1817
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:36,080
Everyone has grown apart
from each other

1818
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:41,640
Stranded in the middle of nowhere

1819
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,760
Lost their way back home.

1820
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:47,520
Homeless...

1821
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:52,800
Why couldn't something
like this happen?

1822
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:57,680
The scared rabbit can't even
lift its head up.

1823
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:03,400
The loving fingers knit no longer,
Life has come to a stand still.

1824
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:37,440
Like a multi-storeyed dream...

1825
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:42,960
No one knows
which floor belongs to whom.

1826
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,840
All that I am left here with
Is an empty space...

1827
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:21,280
Why couldn't something
like this happen?

1828
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:27,200
Everyone has grown apart
from each other.

1829
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:32,400
Stranded in the middle of nowhere

1830
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:35,640
Lost their way back home.

1831
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:38,400
Homeless...

1832
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:43,920
Why couldn't something
like this happen?

1833
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:48,800
The scared rabbit can't even
lift its head up.

1834
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:57,560
The loving fingers knit no longer,
Life has come to a stand still.

1835
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:15,760
Yes Ma… I’ll call you from the airport…

1836
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:20,400
Why won’t Guruji and Ma come with us?...
Tell them to come with us…

1837
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:23,920
Give me that leg…

1838
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:26,840
I don’t like this at all…
I won’t go without them…

1839
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,160
Take this outside…

1840
02:19:34,840 --> 02:19:36,920
Wait a sec...

1841
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:39,160
Get in.

1842
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:59,280
They have started for the Airport…

1843
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,040
Get a trolley, will you?...

1844
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,120
Darling, stay in the car...
I’ll get the trolley.

1845
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:34,160
Sit quietly, ok?...

1846
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:48,040
Posto come...

1847
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,240
Where’s Posto?...

1848
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:54,600
He was right here…
Where was he?...

1849
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:57,240
Posto… Posto!...

1850
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,520
Ma… Ma

1851
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,480
My darling...

1852
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:14,800
Ma I’ve come back…

1853
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:18,800
My precious one...
What happened?...

1854
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:22,840
Did you miss the flight?...

1855
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:29,040
Left it…

1856
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:33,520
Posto is not ready to leave with us Dad…

1857
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,320
His mind is not ready yet...

1858
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:46,160
Can you really uproot a plant this easily?...

1859
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:52,320
Susmita and I will have to leave…

1860
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:55,880
We’ll fix everything over there…

1861
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:03,160
Guruji…

1862
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,240
I’m returning your Apu to you…

1863
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:14,640
The day he really wants to come to us…

1864
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:23,160
The day you can give him to us from your heart…
We shall wait for that day…

1865
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,640
Not Apu…

1866
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,280
My Anu…

1867
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,040
Anu’s son, Posto…

1868
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,520
And Susmita…

1869
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,200
This is my family…

1870
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,920
Don’t you worry at all…

1871
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:48,480
Your mother and I,
along with Posto…

1872
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:52,320
We’ll visit you soon…

1873
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:54,320
Guruji?...

1874
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:56,840
We shall all go together?...

1875
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,320
Absolutely…

1876
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:02,600
Yes darling.. we’ll all live together…

1877
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:04,120
Like every year…

1878
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:08,040
We are celebrating
Grandparents’ Day this year…

1879
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:10,480
Today’s main attraction is…

1880
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:17,280
A special part of Rabindranath Tagore’s
'Post Office'…

1881
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:26,360
To be performed by Arka Lahiri
and his grandfather…Shri Dinen Lahiri…

1882
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:31,960
How is this island, that
you talk about Fakir?...

1883
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,680
It is a very surprising place indeed…

1884
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:37,480
It is the country of birds…

1885
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:40,040
There are no humans there…

1886
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,960
They don’t talk… or walk…

1887
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,680
They only sing there and fly around…

1888
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:52,880
How wonderful! Is it beside the sea?...

1889
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:55,280
Definitely, beside the sea…

1890
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:58,080
All mountains are blue there?...

1891
02:24:58,120 --> 02:25:01,720
They live on the Blue Mountain..

1892
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:08,000
During dusk… the rays of the setting
sun falls on that mountain…

1893
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,240
And the flock of green birds
return to their nests…

1894
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:22,440
In the colour of that setting Sun… mountain,
birds… it is such a spectacle…

1895
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,440
Are there springs on that mountain?...

1896
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:25,600
Of course!

1897
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,720
How can there not be springs?..

1898
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:33,600
It looks as if molten diamonds are flowing…

1899
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:35,800
And how splendidly they dance!

1900
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:40,960
Playing music on the pebbles…

1901
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:46,720
The springs wind
their way through the land…

1902
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,160
And then jump into the sea…

1903
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:57,400
No doctor can stop them for a second…

1904
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:05,760
If the birds had not  taken me for a
simple mortal and set me aside…

1905
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:10,600
Then beside those springs…
along their thousands of nests…

1906
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:14,360
I will create a small nest for myself…

1907
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:20,760
And spend the rest of my days
watching the waves of the sea…

1908
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:41,000
