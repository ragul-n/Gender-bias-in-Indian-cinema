1
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:11,067
FF

2
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:03,754
She's here.

3
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:33,026
REVENGE

4
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,119
Oh Lord!

5
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:01,087
Guruji!

6
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,311
Follow her.

7
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:20,801
There she is!

8
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:28,756
Follow..

9
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:45,608
Don't move.

10
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,796
I'll shoot you.

11
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,707
Go on, step back.

12
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,273
Go back.

13
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,899
Go back.

14
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:56,738
Aryaa, stop it.

15
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:00,197
You're having another attack.

16
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,838
Haven't you given your
father enough trouble?

17
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,322
Hi Mommy!

18
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:11,249
Phussh

19
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,794
Hey, catch this crazy girl.

20
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:17,709
Hey, catch this crazy girl.

21
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,805
Yes, yes, I am crazy - take
me to hospital, give me an injection -

22
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,229
but I refuse to stay silent!

23
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:26,859
I refuse to stay silent!

24
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:28,519
Jai Guruji

25
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:17,799
SHERRY BARKING

26
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:14,915
No Ravi

27
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,766
No Ravi, No, Misha is coming

28
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,873
You've started again?

29
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,161
Huh?

30
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,035
Nobody is coming here Pooja, no one

31
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,357
I don't want to be a Father

32
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,941
Misha is coming!

33
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:36,283
Misha is not coming

34
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,065
I am coming Pooja,

35
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:04,150
I am coming to you

36
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,983
Ravi! What's happened, Ravi?

37
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:31,287
Ravi.. Ravi?

38
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:48,910
Pakiya, one can pay back a debt,
but not return a favour

39
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,837
This man has given me back my life

40
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,657
Can't I do this much for him?

41
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,733
Don't worry,
I'll take care of everything

42
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,160
Nothing's happened to me Pooja,
I am okay

43
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:10,421
See..

44
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,448
Now they will take me inside

45
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,998
and give me an injection, here

46
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:17,734
Is that what you want?

47
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,924
What is this circus?

48
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,083
I am leaving.

49
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,529
Just keep quiet and sit down

50
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,569
I am not Pakiya.

51
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,962
Take this and give it to the Doctor.

52
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,210
What is this Ravi?

53
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:04,708
Why are you doing this?

54
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,382
You are not meant to die such a death,
my friend.

55
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,969
You have to live. Somehow.

56
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:18,614
Who is there to live for?

57
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,177
She who brought meaning
to my life is gone,

58
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,748
now whom should I live for?

59
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:36,335
You still get moved to tears
when you see others in pain.

60
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:40,668
Plenty of people are dead
inside even when they're alive

61
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:45,026
But you are not totally dead yet, Ravi.

62
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:50,119
Ravi Kishore ji, please come in.

63
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,828
Go buddy

64
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,236
Or else I'll miss my flight.

65
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:59,668
With great difficulty I managed
to land this job in Ranikhet.

66
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,178
You should get yourself
admitted to our mental hospital.

67
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,703
Mr. Ravi, you are a danger to yourself.

68
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,578
Nobody listens to me.

69
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,519
I need to go somewhere else, Doctor.

70
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:35,996
Tell me,

71
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:42,817
if your house is on fire
and I try to douse the flames,

72
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:46,477
won't you help me?

73
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,436
No,

74
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,359
I will pour more petrol onto those flame

75
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:58,960
till the whole house
burns down to ashes.

76
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:07,188
I cannot live in that semi-burnt
house without my Pooja.

77
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,575
Thank you, Doctor

78
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:18,985
Nandini!

79
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:26,719
Careful

80
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,989
Nandini!!!

81
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,237
What happened, Yogesh?

82
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:45,533
Daddy,

83
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:50,120
I know you will be very worried
about me, but I will be back.

84
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,455
I will come back.

85
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:55,226
You have to be saved from
Gyaan Prakaash and Nandini Maa.

86
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:58,208
She's the disease you
need to be saved from Daddy,

87
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,355
I love you very much,
take care of yourself

88
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:03,299
and I will be back soon. I promise.

89
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:05,769
Oh Lord,

90
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,637
she ran away even from the hospital?

91
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:12,093
Didn't I tell you?

92
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:15,152
Didn't I tell you to stay
the night with her? Just one night?

93
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,931
Didn't I tell you?

94
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,321
Aryaa is right.

95
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:24,217
You are a disease.

96
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:27,240
A disease.

97
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,143
Don't say that Yogesh, don't say that.

98
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:34,491
Now stop your drama, stop it. Stop.

99
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,117
Stop.

100
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,019
I don't know where to look for her now.

101
00:16:40,296 --> 00:16:44,213
I don't know what to do,
where do I look for her,

102
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:46,993
where..

103
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:53,935
Shh..calm down, calm down..

104
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,222
..here, see this. Come

105
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:03,557
Let's go see Bhagwaan.

106
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,238
Jai Guruji

107
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,480
He alone can get us out of this darkness

108
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,081
Protect my child,
O Guruji, Jai Guruji

109
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,746
Jai Guruji

110
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:17,476
Jai Guruji

111
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,580
Yes?

112
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:41,072
Look, I have shut down my business

113
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,850
I don't understand why
nobody reads the board outside

114
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:50,022
Mindlessly banging on my
door in the middle of the night

115
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,082
Here, take this

116
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:57,590
What?

117
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,498
I made a Booking for Kailash from here.

118
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,438
You will find plenty
of other drivers in this city

119
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:05,406
Please excuse me.

120
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:09,504
I don't want to talk to you.

121
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:10,509
Call her

122
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,425
Whom?

123
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:13,813
The owner of this place...

124
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,548
..who had assured me
while taking my booking that..

125
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:20,741
..you would take me wherever I needed to
go, from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari.

126
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:23,058
Call her,
and ask her if she said this or not.

127
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:23,621
Look

128
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:25,921
Then what's the point of making
a booking 3 months in advance?

129
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:26,691
You tell me!

130
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:27,686
It's impossible

131
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,424
There's one thing you can do.

132
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,010
You will find a row
of cars parked outside.

133
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,105
Just pick any one of them and go,
you don't even have to return it.

134
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:42,121
Okay?

135
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,809
He's crazy.

136
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:13,544
Do you expect me to drive
all the way to Kailash by myself?

137
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,475
Call her, please, call her.

138
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,096
Didn't I just tell you I can't call her?

139
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,979
Now go on, leave.

140
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:22,920
Hey!

141
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:24,728
My bag..

142
00:20:54,238 --> 00:20:56,720
I was all prepared to come to you.

143
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,161
Why did you take a
booking from this crazy girl?

144
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,279
Now keep waiting for me!

145
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,353
What is it?

146
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,432
I don't want your money

147
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,379
And I don't have anyone else to turn to

148
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,604
You don't understand,
I have certain obligations.

149
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,559
What kind of obligations?

150
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,131
I can't tell you that,
but I really don't have time. Please.

151
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,462
Oh, you're running out of time?

152
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,445
You've run away from
the hospital, right?

153
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,913
Wait, I'm going to call the hospital

154
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:47,012
One prick of a needle,
and you will be right back there

155
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:48,751
Don't move.

156
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:08,514
If you don't disconnect
the call right now,

157
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,143
I will cut myself.

158
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:18,426
Go on, what's stopping you?

159
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:20,562
Hello? City Care Hospital?

160
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:22,406
Hello?

161
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,683
Are you crazy?

162
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,024
You cut yourself?

163
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,166
It's your fault

164
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:33,527
You said go ahead so I cut myself

165
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,236
But why are you standing
there like a statue?

166
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,254
Do you want to just stand
there and watch me die?

167
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:41,111
No, no!

168
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,407
Then do something!

169
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:51,152
Oh ho, this looks like a suicide case.

170
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,513
I will have to call the police.

171
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:58,660
Police..police!

172
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:03,132
Why are you calling the Police?

173
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,167
Stop the bleeding first

174
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,624
I need to notify the
police in a suicide case

175
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:12,827
PLEASE

176
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:16,259
Hello, this is Dr. Dastoor.

177
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:19,270
Why do you keep calling this a suicide?

178
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,485
Look, she got angry because
her father was getting drunk.

179
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:27,295
She tried snatching the bottle
away and cut herself. Simple.

180
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,434
Is she your daughter?

181
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:38,045
Yes, she's my daughter.

182
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,094
Name?

183
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:43,858
Ravi Kishore

184
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:46,764
Not yours, your daughter's

185
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,041
Misha.

186
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:58,890
Misha.

187
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,419
Misha, Ravi? Misha.

188
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:04,391
Yes, I got it Pooja,

189
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:14,138
Misha Kishore.

190
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:21,160
Nurse, prepare a dressing

191
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:54,434
Nothing happens in the
Universe without a purpose.

192
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:58,664
How did she escape from the
hospital despite being sedated?

193
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:02,677
Yogesh,

194
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:12,326
this upheaval means the Lord
himself is trying to tell us something.

195
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,810
Where were you at that time?

196
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,604
Be still Rajesh, be still.

197
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,153
Let me focus

198
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:39,389
Rajesh,

199
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:48,265
we are all connected
through our past lives.

200
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:50,734
Help your brother.

201
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,689
I beg you, please help him

202
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:03,516
Look how he's suffering,
help him find his daughter.

203
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:05,159
I will find her. I will find her.

204
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,778
Yogesh, get a hold on yourself.

205
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,996
It is impossible for
Aryaa to survive now.

206
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,025
She is racing towards her death.

207
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:29,844
One of her own will kill her.

208
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,753
Sit here,
let me get you some turmeric milk.

209
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:56,531
Thank you.

210
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:36,963
I am sorry,

211
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:41,011
I'm a bit messed up with my problems.

212
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:48,569
it's alright, it's not your fault.

213
00:28:52,747 --> 00:28:55,826
Let it be,
we can eat something on the way.

214
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,538
Can we leave?

215
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:04,656
See, if I don't reach Ranikhet on time,
my helicopter bookings will go to waste

216
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,444
I will be 21 in 7 days

217
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,278
And my mother wanted me to offer worship
in Kailash as soon as I turned 21.

218
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,476
You have a tattoo of
Lord Shiva on your arm, right?

219
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:23,640
She told me

220
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,777
If you are going to Kailash,
take my husband with you.

221
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:32,928
If he had his way, he would
have Shiva tattoos all over his body.

222
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:48,755
But if you don't want to
honour your wife's last booking,

223
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:50,891
I can't do much about it.

224
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:00,602
Keep this safely.

225
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,214
She had lovely handwriting

226
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:05,497
I'm off

227
00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:39,670
POOJA KISHORE

228
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:58,630
I am here

229
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,449
Can we leave?

230
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,157
Namashkar Pooja Travels and Tours.

231
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:17,547
Service with Security 24/7 is our motto.

232
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,329
Have a nice day.

233
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:20,998
Tell me something..

234
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,183
Hm

235
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:24,656
Aren't you scared of death?

236
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:30,225
No, let me finish this last duty.

237
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,448
Then, I'm off.

238
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:34,135
Straight up there to my lady

239
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:40,639
Our love story began on these streets,
but it will end only up there.

240
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:43,710
Wow!

241
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:48,483
Nowadays people start and
end their relationships on Whatsapp.

242
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:55,859
But Vishal also loves me like this

243
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,956
Who is Vishal?

244
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:01,819
We will pick him up on our way.

245
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:03,237
On our way?

246
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,707
Yes, up ahead

247
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:06,843
But from where?

248
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:10,156
Central Jail

249
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:14,566
What?

250
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:16,175
Who are you?

251
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,398
And who are you running away from?

252
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:22,100
You've made a booking for Kailash,
but you're going to the jail?

253
00:32:23,303 --> 00:32:27,696
Tell me your real story,
or I will take you back to the hospital.

254
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,444
Why should I tell you?

255
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,791
Because you have no option.

256
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:36,856
Wait, I'll tell you.

257
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,210
Have you heard of the
Desai Group of Industries?

258
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:01,618
I am the only daughter
of Shakuntala and Yogesh Desai

259
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:05,314
And the sole heir of
Desai Group of Industries.

260
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,332
Two years ago, my mother got lung cancer

261
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,958
And then she died a year ago

262
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:17,643
But my mother did not die of cancer.

263
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:26,472
My aunt, Nandini, and Gyaan
Prakaash together killed my mother.

264
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,842
And I am sure about that.

265
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:35,494
Just a week after my mother's death,
Nandini married my Dad.

266
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:40,805
And since then, Gyaan's fraud Ashram
has been running on my mother's money.

267
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:43,391
What about your father,
doesn't he know anything?

268
00:33:43,511 --> 00:33:45,216
He himself has become a disciple now

269
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:48,476
He knows nothing, he is too innocent.

270
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,093
Why haven't you told this to the police?

271
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:54,746
Because Nandini has had
me labelled mentally unstable.

272
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,822
They all think I am hallucinating.

273
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:58,612
Nobody believes what I say.

274
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:01,976
Do you know they wanted
to give me shock therapy?

275
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:04,528
This is my story.

276
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:10,685
And how did your criminal
boyfriend land up in your story?

277
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:19,118
Just like a Hindi film hero!

278
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,289
With a song on his lips

279
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:42,640
Thank you!

280
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,884
Amazing!

281
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:47,893
But it is not necessary for
a great artist to be a good human being.

282
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,612
I will come straight to the point.

283
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:53,937
For the last few months,

284
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:57,840
you have been continuously abusing me
on my 'India Fights Fake Gurus' account.

285
00:36:58,154 --> 00:37:00,284
Why? What is your problem?

286
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:04,457
You, and affluent people like you,

287
00:37:04,716 --> 00:37:06,930
who sit in your AC
rooms and think you can

288
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,248
rescue the country from
the chains of blind faith

289
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,788
Arrey, you people are more dangerous
than these fake Babas and Gurus

290
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,074
You're doing this for publicity
and to increase your followers.

291
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:20,023
You're the fake.

292
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:24,417
We all look at the world
from our own points of view

293
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:32,356
I have lost one of my
own because of these fake gurus

294
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:37,796
Here, meet my friend Naina Das

295
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:43,020
She went to learn meditation from a
Baba, and ended up being molested by him

296
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,969
This cause is my life.

297
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:49,688
Now apologise for badmouthing me earlier

298
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:50,760
..in public.

299
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:53,900
Otherwise, face the music.

300
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,414
The point I am trying to make is,

301
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:05,550
we can make fools of ourselves much more
easily than others can make fools out of us.

302
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:10,007
To these fake Gurus our
suffering is a gold mine.

303
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:17,954
Every morning when the sun rises, it shines
equally on both the rich and the poor.

304
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:22,713
But Gyaan Prakaash claims
that only he can hear God's voice.

305
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:28,419
What kind of God talks
only to him and not to us?

306
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:32,288
We want His contact too,
we want to talk to Him too.

307
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,664
Please speak to us too.

308
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:42,576
Yes?

309
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,436
I have come to apologise.

310
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,204
What I did was wrong.

311
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,710
I did not know your story,

312
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:08,872
please forgive me.

313
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,841
Like you I too have lost a lot.

314
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:20,126
My grandfather came under the spell of a Guru,
and signed off our ancestral property to him.

315
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:24,465
And that Guru sold it all,
and flew off to settle abroad.

316
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:28,410
We were ruined.

317
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,387
I have hated these
fake Babas ever since.

318
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:38,498
I want to join your Cause,

319
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,930
I want to make a difference.

320
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:45,682
I understand.

321
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:53,151
So come, join our army of one
lakh ninety six thousand followers.

322
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,104
Welcome to the gang.

323
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:05,169
India Fights Fake Gurus,
please contact us Sir.

324
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:07,714
Ma'am, India Fights Fake Gurus,
just contact us.

325
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:08,739
Thank you

326
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:10,846
Ma'am, India Fights Fake Gurus,
just contact us.

327
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:12,533
Just contact us.

328
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:14,865
Just contact us.

329
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:16,905
Please contact us

330
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:21,152
Aryaa your words are always on my mind.

331
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:24,048
My words or me?

332
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:29,897
Can I ask you something?

333
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:30,576
Hm?

334
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,078
Aryaa, don't you think
it's a waste of time

335
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,705
to keep distributing
handbills in this digital age?

336
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:40,281
Vishal, there's a whole
universe outside social media too.

337
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:41,531
You know that, right?

338
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,526
We have to escape from
this darkness together, all of us

339
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:50,655
My heart says that one day these
handbills will lead us to that one person

340
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:53,154
who knows of Gyaan Prakaash's
criminal activities

341
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:55,414
and who will be willing
to testify against him.

342
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:00,685
Here, what are you gaping like that for?

343
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:06,996
God is on our side,
here on the streets, now get out!

344
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:13,954
Back to work, guys.

345
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:19,285
Aryaa,

346
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,824
I worry about you.

347
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:27,485
Don't be scared, Vishal.

348
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:29,122
What do you mean, don't be scared?

349
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:31,657
Those who bark, don't bite.

350
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:32,999
It's okay.

351
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:55,500
Vishal?

352
00:43:57,336 --> 00:43:58,532
Vishal?

353
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:04,963
A man came and gave me this address

354
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,835
And asked us both to be there at ten,

355
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:09,378
He said there's a girl who wants
to testify against Gyaan Prakaash.

356
00:44:11,158 --> 00:44:12,333
Are you serious?

357
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,293
Oh my God, Vishal!

358
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,787
We.. we were supposed
to meet a girl at ten.

359
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,766
Lets go

360
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:29,134
Thank you.

361
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:33,918
Vishal, stop drinking.

362
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:34,983
Arrey chill naa.

363
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:41,781
What kind of a place is this?

364
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:46,992
Hello?

365
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,234
Hello?

366
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:02,384
You, get out,

367
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,188
get out!

368
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:06,237
What's going on?

369
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,495
Vishal..Vishal? Vishal?

370
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:17,181
Vishal?

371
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:20,094
Vishal?

372
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:31,383
Who are you?

373
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:36,107
Aah..

374
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:38,625
No

375
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,703
Vishal, he's dead..

376
00:45:55,976 --> 00:45:59,501
But this seems to be a case of
self-defence, then why is he in jail?

377
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:03,882
Because Nandini and Gyaan Prakaash are
very well connected with the Police bigwigs.

378
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:06,173
Vishal was drinking that night,

379
00:46:06,526 --> 00:46:08,792
They got him on those grounds.

380
00:46:09,657 --> 00:46:13,585
They threatened all our Activists
into silence, and then came after me.

381
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,959
But as soon as I turn 21,

382
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,963
I become the head of Desai Group of
industries according to my mother's will.

383
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:26,090
And thereafter she won't even be able to
swipe a credit card without my permission.

384
00:46:26,374 --> 00:46:29,992
Just let Vishal and me reach Kailash,

385
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,993
then see how,
with God's blessing, we go after them.

386
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,138
So young, yet so brave!

387
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:42,127
Don't you feel scared?

388
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:46,852
Yes I do, but my mother used to say,

389
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:50,671
real courage is when
you persist despite the fear.

390
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:56,495
Should we leave?

391
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:00,103
Please!

392
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:08,715
Vishal!

393
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,864
Ohh Kumbhkaran!

394
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:32,742
Kumbhkaran?

395
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:36,342
Hello Kumbhkaran?
I've heard so much about you.

396
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,087
Where's Gaurav by the way?

397
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:41,345
I couldn't get in
touch with him, Vishal,

398
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:44,299
and I had to throw away my
phone so that they can't track me.

399
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:46,464
But why didn't he come?

400
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:49,603
I don't know,
we can call him on the way.

401
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,287
We should leave,
there are too many cameras around. Come!

402
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:55,159
Okay.

403
00:48:05,464 --> 00:48:09,652
Driver Saab, please look after him,
this is my son, Kumbhkaran.

404
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:12,338
He sleeps all day... and all night too

405
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:16,123
He was injured,
we'll leave him in the forest.

406
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:25,908
Kumbhkaran, something is
not quite right with your Father.

407
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:39,233
What?

408
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:43,690
Let's take another cab, man!

409
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:45,838
No.

410
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:50,489
Aryaa, I cannot go from
one jail straight into another,

411
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:52,385
- What do you mean No?
- Yes, please,

412
00:48:53,232 --> 00:48:57,563
I am a little old fashioned,
please take another taxi.

413
00:48:57,683 --> 00:49:00,509
- Yes.
- No no, no,

414
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:03,086
we want to go with you. Please let's go.

415
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,059
Hello, Pooja Travels and Tours.

416
00:49:20,577 --> 00:49:24,679
Service with Security 24/7 is our motto,
have a nice day.

417
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:03,833
Vishal you know he is suicidal?

418
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:11,278
He feels that if he kills himself
he will be reunited with his dead wife.

419
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:15,920
He still loves her intensely.

420
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,391
Are you serious?

421
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,612
That's insane.

422
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:34,056
Aryaa, on one hand we are fighting
against blind faith

423
00:53:34,735 --> 00:53:37,161
and yet you're encouraging
this kind of thinking?

424
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,955
You are sympathising with this nonsense?

425
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:44,186
Can we just please get another cab?

426
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:45,570
Oh God

427
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:49,322
God knows when with a
twist of his steering wheel

428
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:52,619
he will decide to go meet
his wife and take us along.

429
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:56,865
Vishal, so what are you saying?
We leave him here?

430
00:53:57,856 --> 00:54:01,079
Yes, why? Is he family?

431
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:06,903
Okay Vishal, you don't know this, okay?

432
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:11,409
If he wanted he could have
handed me over to the Police

433
00:54:12,424 --> 00:54:13,591
He didn't do it,

434
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:18,568
he knows everything about
me and he understands me.

435
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:24,141
I don't know why the
heart does what it does but

436
00:54:24,997 --> 00:54:28,950
I trust him,
like I trust Daddy and I trust you.

437
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:30,712
I don't want to get another cab.

438
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:37,174
-Whatever

439
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:38,693
What?

440
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:42,210
Nothing

441
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:48,108
Okay, you sulk while I go change.

442
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:51,726
Munna?

443
00:54:58,191 --> 00:54:59,542
Jai Guruji!

444
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:30,342
He hasn't touched even a
grain of rice since she disappeared.

445
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:32,274
And look at her!

446
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:36,001
What is she doing in
the middle of the road?

447
00:55:37,455 --> 00:55:41,139
Even if you manage to find her,
don't bring her home.

448
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,538
She cannot be the blood
of such a noble man.

449
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:47,340
Nandini! What is wrong with you?

450
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:50,333
You're just saying
whatever you feel like.

451
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:55,670
I knew this video would
make you two uncomfortable.

452
00:55:57,632 --> 00:56:02,605
When our daughters disrespect
our culture like this,

453
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:09,066
and take to the streets in this manner,
it makes our blood boil.

454
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:12,257
But

455
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,322
what I am going to tell you now

456
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:24,339
will make it clear that our Lord
indeed is privy to divine instruction.

457
00:56:31,293 --> 00:56:35,574
My informer has just
told me that this boy, Vishal,

458
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:39,440
whom Aryaa considers to be a hero,
is no hero at all..

459
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:43,902
In fact, he's a close accomplice
of the gangster Dilip Hathkataa,

460
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:47,526
and is now escaping
with Aryaa in a taxi.

461
00:56:48,702 --> 00:56:51,288
We've got the details
of the taxi and its driver,

462
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:57,205
but I have no idea where
this boy is taking Aryaa.

463
00:56:59,505 --> 00:57:05,514
But this can't be Dilip's doing..

464
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:11,464
Then who is instigating this scoundrel?

465
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:15,667
I don't have an answer to that now,

466
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:20,891
but most certainly this is the guy who,
as our Lord warned us,

467
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:26,357
will be responsible for Aryaa's death.

468
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,551
Can I ask you something?

469
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,840
Yes, of course.

470
00:57:40,593 --> 00:57:42,695
What happened to her?

471
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:53,264
Years ago, we prematurely lost a
baby whom we had decided to call Misha.

472
00:57:56,905 --> 00:58:00,053
Last year we decided
to adopt a baby girl.

473
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:03,980
Three months back, she came

474
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:09,455
and told me that the Adoption Centre
had asked us to come collect our Misha.

475
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,780
I've never refused her anything.

476
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,473
God knows what happened to me that day

477
00:58:18,935 --> 00:58:23,138
I said, you go,
I will get the house ready for her.

478
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:29,407
Twenty minutes later, the phone rang.

479
00:58:32,278 --> 00:58:33,870
She had met with a fatal accident.

480
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:40,278
Why didn't I die instead of her?

481
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:54,902
Ravi, the truth is,
despite all our attempts,

482
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:59,693
sometimes it is impossible for us
to stop those we love from leaving us.

483
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:03,084
Even I couldn't save my mother.

484
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:10,452
Please stop feeling guilty,
it was an accident.

485
00:59:17,613 --> 00:59:20,847
Here's some good news for you!

486
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:27,586
In a very short time,
we will be parting ways.

487
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,976
Then you can go your way,
and we will go ours.

488
00:59:31,096 --> 00:59:32,654
- Vishal?
- This is final Aryaa.

489
00:59:33,294 --> 00:59:37,886
There are too many rules
to follow with him, I can't do it..

490
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:39,409
And let me be honest..

491
00:59:39,529 --> 00:59:41,614
After what you told me,
about him, I don't feel safe.

492
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:42,895
Okay? So sorry.

493
00:59:43,015 --> 00:59:43,829
I am sorry

494
00:59:44,044 --> 00:59:47,409
I've spoken with Gaurav,
he's getting us another taxi.

495
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,340
So we'll carry on, Sir?
My friend is waiting for us.

496
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:02,595
Can you give me your phone
so I can set the location on your GPS?

497
01:00:04,593 --> 01:00:06,807
I don't need a machine
to tell me the location.

498
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:10,024
Tell me the address,
I'll take you there.

499
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:30,502
There's Gaurav!

500
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:41,996
Here we are..

501
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,311
Bro, how have you been?

502
01:00:48,856 --> 01:00:50,517
Where were you man?

503
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:05,746
I am very sorry for Vishal's behavior.

504
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:06,939
No, it's okay.

505
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:14,308
I thought if I went with you,
I would reach Kailash.

506
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:19,290
But I suppose one can only
reach Him when He calls one.

507
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:25,949
But thank you,

508
01:01:27,982 --> 01:01:30,429
I feel lighter after talking to you.

509
01:01:34,686 --> 01:01:36,225
I want to say something to you.

510
01:01:36,415 --> 01:01:37,609
Sure, go ahead

511
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:44,683
This body - it belongs to Him.

512
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:50,538
You have no right to harm it, okay?

513
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:57,335
Ravi ji, this world needs
more human beings like you,

514
01:01:59,074 --> 01:02:00,838
not Godmen like Gyaan Prakaash.

515
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:02,066
Aryaa?

516
01:02:02,377 --> 01:02:02,888
What?

517
01:02:03,008 --> 01:02:04,522
- What are you doing?
- I am coming.

518
01:02:04,713 --> 01:02:05,595
Let's go!

519
01:02:24,836 --> 01:02:26,427
Please take care of yourself, okay?

520
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:30,979
Thank you.

521
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:36,984
Okay, bye.

522
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:46,351
You've gone mad.

523
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,891
- What?
- You've lost it.

524
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:48,842
Let's go guys.

525
01:02:48,962 --> 01:02:50,451
Why is your taxi parked over there?

526
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:51,524
Some problem.

527
01:02:51,644 --> 01:02:52,700
What problem?

528
01:02:53,582 --> 01:02:55,286
- Why were you so rude?
- I was rude, or he was rude?

529
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:56,774
Please, please, please.

530
01:02:56,894 --> 01:02:59,291
What a guy! How did you find him?

531
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:03,753
Did you see the sign in his car?

532
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:25,235
Vishal!

533
01:03:27,048 --> 01:03:28,079
Vishal?

534
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,915
- Let me go!
- What is this Gaurav?

535
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:32,749
Who are these people?

536
01:03:59,078 --> 01:04:00,220
Sorry yaar guys.

537
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:01,583
Gaurav!

538
01:04:21,076 --> 01:04:23,137
I will attend to you later.

539
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,825
First, let me finish her off.

540
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:30,306
My name is Dilip Hathkataa,

541
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,800
do you know the story of my hand?

542
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:39,059
Once Guruji gave me a task,

543
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:42,813
and I failed.

544
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:46,004
I hated myself so much for failing,

545
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:49,439
that I cut off my hand
and placed it at Guruji's feet.

546
01:04:54,403 --> 01:04:56,876
Now it's our turn to post
your photo on the internet.

547
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:02,256
One before offering you to the fire,
one after.

548
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,021
You can set me on fire

549
01:05:08,198 --> 01:05:13,664
but you can't douse the fire
which we've lit in people's hearts.

550
01:05:16,085 --> 01:05:20,781
Let Nandini and your
fraud Guru know this.

551
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:23,083
Let's offer you to the fire now

552
01:05:25,582 --> 01:05:29,223
Hey, now pour petrol on her.
Get my mobile.

553
01:05:36,852 --> 01:05:40,415
Go Kumbhkaran,
it's time you showed what you can do.

554
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:50,749
Kartaar, get rid of this beast.
Chase it away.

555
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:52,937
What are you waiting for? Get rid of it.

556
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,159
And who's he? Throw him out.

557
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:58,194
Hey you, get out!

558
01:05:58,314 --> 01:06:03,037
Hold it, where's this guy's other hand?

559
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:07,345
He uses this one hand for everything?

560
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:15,806
Should I shoot you?

561
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:18,530
Should I?

562
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,757
Why don't you? Shoot!

563
01:06:24,423 --> 01:06:25,573
Shoot!

564
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,140
Untie them.

565
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:45,342
Kumbhkaran, handle this.

566
01:07:21,715 --> 01:07:22,808
Ravi,

567
01:07:29,153 --> 01:07:30,647
why are you doing all this?

568
01:07:33,291 --> 01:07:35,006
After all, I am just a passenger.

569
01:07:43,614 --> 01:07:49,122
How will I face my beloved up there
if you get even a single scratch on you?

570
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:54,975
As long as I am here,
nobody can harm you.

571
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:58,766
Whether it's an outsider,

572
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:01,312
or an insider.

573
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:09,358
Service with Security 24/7,

574
01:08:12,374 --> 01:08:16,291
we'll spend the night close by, okay?

575
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:48,909
Vishal!

576
01:08:51,905 --> 01:08:53,967
What happened? Are you okay?

577
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,551
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
- Wait,

578
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,110
give me a hug.

579
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,131
Come here.

580
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,270
Aah..ughh..

581
01:09:39,527 --> 01:09:41,075
Vishal, you scared me!

582
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:44,430
Come, lie down.

583
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,475
What happened?

584
01:09:52,594 --> 01:09:53,416
Aryaa..

585
01:09:53,675 --> 01:09:55,751
What? Say something please, I ummm

586
01:09:57,143 --> 01:09:58,587
Aryaa, I am not Vishal.

587
01:10:06,009 --> 01:10:09,070
You are not Vishal? Then? Who are you?

588
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:13,022
Munna..

589
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:16,939
Munna Chavan.

590
01:10:17,786 --> 01:10:21,877
After winning a reality show,
I came to Mumbai to become a star

591
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:24,731
but ended up becoming a drug addict.

592
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:36,313
Hello? What happened, Sir?
Are you ok?

593
01:10:36,656 --> 01:10:37,582
I'm okay bro

594
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:38,373
Sir?

595
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:53,831
If Gyaan's followers hadn't
picked me up from the streets,

596
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:55,604
I would have died.

597
01:10:55,724 --> 01:10:57,238
Pick him up, pick him up

598
01:11:01,808 --> 01:11:05,068
Jai Guru ji, Jai Guru ji

599
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:11,900
I was reborn in Gyaan's Ashram.

600
01:11:21,224 --> 01:11:23,308
You've given me a new life.

601
01:11:25,124 --> 01:11:28,013
From this moment,
every drop of my blood is yours.

602
01:11:32,716 --> 01:11:34,221
Be patient,

603
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:42,498
you will get your chance
to be of service to me.

604
01:11:58,682 --> 01:11:59,666
Come here..

605
01:12:12,388 --> 01:12:16,583
And then, one night I got my chance.

606
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:31,139
So Gyaan Prakaash,
your days are numbered,

607
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:33,335
we are coming to burn down your Lanka.

608
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:35,368
Didn't that make your blood boil?

609
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:37,816
Of course.

610
01:12:38,707 --> 01:12:40,497
Then stand by us.

611
01:12:42,632 --> 01:12:47,986
We want to bathe our Lord's
pure feet with her blood.

612
01:12:50,468 --> 01:12:54,576
And for this, we need your help

613
01:12:56,236 --> 01:13:02,022
Just use your beautiful,
innocent face to trap her.

614
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:05,966
Then his men will take over.

615
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:24,161
That night, I was all set to kill you.

616
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:29,774
But I fell in love with
you the very first time I saw you.

617
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:35,543
Every morning when the sun rises, it shines
equally on both the rich and the poor.

618
01:13:35,855 --> 01:13:40,369
But Gyaan Prakaash claims
that only he can hear God's voice.

619
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:43,587
What kind of God talks
only to him and not us?

620
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:49,684
Your innocent questions turned the
image of the Lord into ashes inside me.

621
01:13:54,622 --> 01:13:57,805
That was the most beautiful
morning of my life.

622
01:13:59,994 --> 01:14:03,661
I was about to confess everything
to you when the bell rang..

623
01:14:05,753 --> 01:14:08,235
So how's the romance blooming?

624
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,333
Sir, I won't be able to do it.

625
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:17,420
Why?

626
01:14:18,484 --> 01:14:20,317
Have you fallen in love with her?

627
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:29,553
But you are misunderstanding us.

628
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:32,727
Do you think we will kill our daughters?

629
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:43,555
You just bring her to this address,
that's all

630
01:14:44,205 --> 01:14:48,174
One of my lady officers will talk to her,
explain the consequences of her actions,

631
01:14:48,294 --> 01:14:50,985
and then let her go.

632
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:56,502
Then you two can continue your romance!

633
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:03,327
That night, by saving you, I
became Gyaan Prakaash's lifelong enemy.

634
01:15:04,736 --> 01:15:07,383
Sooner or later, they will kill me.

635
01:15:09,935 --> 01:15:11,751
And I am ready to die,

636
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,940
but I had to tell you the truth Aryaa.

637
01:15:44,218 --> 01:15:49,148
It takes two to make a truth.

638
01:15:50,705 --> 01:15:53,750
One who can tell it,

639
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:57,936
and one who can bear it.

640
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,393
He has confessed his truth,

641
01:16:05,944 --> 01:16:07,284
now what will you do?

642
01:16:09,317 --> 01:16:14,437
We don't let go of those close to us even
after getting to know the worst about them.

643
01:16:16,703 --> 01:16:21,261
He had come to kill you,
but now his own life is in danger

644
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:27,393
I had heard that love can
turn even garbage into gold.

645
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,261
Today I have seen it with my own eyes.

646
01:16:34,873 --> 01:16:35,885
Do something.

647
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:39,198
Either hold him close and forgive him.

648
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:41,637
Or, take the gun, and shoot him.

649
01:16:43,202 --> 01:16:46,826
Because this bond between you can't
be erased by pressing a delete button.

650
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,162
Aryaa, say something.

651
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:17,305
Your silence is unbearable Aryaa,
please say something.

652
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:21,090
Just kill me.

653
01:17:22,266 --> 01:17:23,429
Kill you?

654
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:26,349
How brave, Vishal!

655
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:30,936
Vishal, it takes courage to live,
not die.

656
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,371
Didn't you hear what he just said?

657
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,945
You had come to kill me,

658
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,590
but what did God do?

659
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:45,202
He made you fall in love with me. Why?

660
01:17:46,157 --> 01:17:47,915
Because my cause is true,

661
01:17:50,509 --> 01:17:51,851
and so is my love.

662
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:56,473
And you want me to kill my true love?

663
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:02,437
Do you remember what you told me the
first time you came to apologize to me?

664
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,775
That I want to make a difference.

665
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:06,712
Then make a difference!

666
01:18:08,754 --> 01:18:11,653
You fool, don't you see it?

667
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:17,492
You are the witness who
can bring Gyaan Prakaash down.

668
01:18:18,662 --> 01:18:20,703
You can make us win Vishal!..

669
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:25,615
What?

670
01:18:26,722 --> 01:18:28,583
You still love me, Aryaa?

671
01:18:28,874 --> 01:18:33,426
Yes, I love you, and you know what?

672
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:35,267
I will love you till the very end,

673
01:18:35,897 --> 01:18:38,906
because now I alone
have a right over you.

674
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:41,922
Fool, come here.

675
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,727
I love you, Aryaa.

676
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:46,952
I love you too.

677
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:58,637
Ravi, you have grown
attached to this child.

678
01:18:59,461 --> 01:19:02,180
You are seeing your Misha in her.

679
01:19:05,862 --> 01:19:08,318
Ravi, this is too big a game for you,
my friend.

680
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:12,752
This is out of your league now.

681
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,776
I could not save Pooja,

682
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,440
how do I abandon this child?

683
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:20,384
You want to save her, right?

684
01:19:21,374 --> 01:19:25,318
Now listen to me, she is suspicious
about her step mother right?

685
01:19:26,003 --> 01:19:27,309
Not her father, right?

686
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:30,246
MISSING

687
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:37,163
You just lie to them,
and bring them here somehow.

688
01:19:37,847 --> 01:19:39,743
Then call the poor father,

689
01:19:40,836 --> 01:19:43,479
and ask him to pick up his child.

690
01:19:44,173 --> 01:19:44,821
Does that sound good?

691
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:46,191
Take down this number.

692
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:47,077
Hello?

693
01:19:47,936 --> 01:19:48,578
Coffee?

694
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:54,923
Ravi?

695
01:19:55,463 --> 01:19:57,117
Take the number.

696
01:20:10,126 --> 01:20:10,769
Hello?

697
01:20:10,984 --> 01:20:11,676
Namastey, Sir.

698
01:20:11,796 --> 01:20:13,067
Namastey, who's speaking?

699
01:20:13,187 --> 01:20:15,821
Sir, I need to tell you something
about your daughter Aryaa

700
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:18,007
Aryaa..yes, tell me?

701
01:20:18,194 --> 01:20:20,297
Please pay full attention,

702
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:22,710
and note down this address.

703
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:24,017
One second.

704
01:20:58,321 --> 01:20:59,912
What have you done to yourself?

705
01:21:02,282 --> 01:21:03,303
Why this pistol?

706
01:21:04,116 --> 01:21:06,684
We need this now Yogesh,

707
01:21:07,307 --> 01:21:09,668
we need this now.

708
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,268
What?

709
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,454
We make our plans down here,

710
01:21:16,508 --> 01:21:20,530
but He has his own Super Plan for us.

711
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:26,185
All the sins began with me.

712
01:21:28,624 --> 01:21:31,962
I used to be so jealous of Shakuntala.

713
01:21:34,401 --> 01:21:40,411
It started with stealing
her lipsticks and make up,

714
01:21:43,352 --> 01:21:47,391
until one day, I stole you from her.

715
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:51,759
To tell you the truth, Yogesh..

716
01:21:52,368 --> 01:22:01,972
Guruji had instigated me
to push you to kill Shakuntala.

717
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:12,974
But despite committing this sin,
I got no satisfaction..

718
01:22:17,513 --> 01:22:25,556
See how he has made our
child a roadblock on our path

719
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,430
God knows how she found
out that I killed her mother.

720
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,605
I am the only path through which

721
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:39,457
Yes, hello, Rajesh bhai?

722
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:41,247
Yes, I had called you.
I've got Aryaa's address

723
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:44,179
- Yogesh,
- I'm sending it to you.

724
01:22:44,473 --> 01:22:48,175
I overheard your conversation
with that taxi driver

725
01:22:48,582 --> 01:22:52,586
And yet you're giving
Rajesh Aryaa's address?

726
01:22:54,453 --> 01:22:56,148
Don't you want to bring her home?

727
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:57,438
No

728
01:22:57,818 --> 01:22:58,415
What?

729
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:01,261
I am not interested
in bringing Aryaa back home.

730
01:23:02,558 --> 01:23:04,175
Yogesh, come back to your senses

731
01:23:05,853 --> 01:23:13,861
God is giving us a chance to redeem
our sins through this taxi driver.

732
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:18,713
Tell me something.

733
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:24,845
When your sweet sister
was howling in pain,

734
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:28,797
was He able to give her any relief? Hmm?

735
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:31,729
Did you hear any voice from above?

736
01:23:33,295 --> 01:23:34,108
No, right?

737
01:23:35,267 --> 01:23:39,090
How will you hear a voice
when there is no one up there?

738
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:41,719
Huh?

739
01:23:45,723 --> 01:23:49,381
For me, God died when I was a child

740
01:23:52,226 --> 01:23:55,175
And along with that went
ideas of Good, Bad,

741
01:23:58,377 --> 01:23:59,588
all of it.

742
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:06,590
What remained was the hunger

743
01:24:10,154 --> 01:24:15,350
to become the world's most powerful man.

744
01:24:19,245 --> 01:24:24,649
The world only bows to power,
Nandini, right?

745
01:24:26,013 --> 01:24:28,766
When you introduced me to Gyaan,

746
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:31,436
I realised that

747
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:35,752
there's no greater business
on this earth than the God business .

748
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:41,827
Spin a web of words,

749
01:24:42,829 --> 01:24:49,526
make promises in this lifetime, and
assure their fulfillment in the next.

750
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,829
There's no business
like the God business.

751
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,316
Jai Guruji!

752
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:01,850
And yes,

753
01:25:03,413 --> 01:25:08,783
Gyaan provoked you to
kill Shakuntala only when

754
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,122
I asked him to do so

755
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:20,310
So I was only a means to an end for you?

756
01:25:22,341 --> 01:25:23,517
Of course,

757
01:25:24,901 --> 01:25:27,904
just like your sister and
every other human being on earth.

758
01:25:30,389 --> 01:25:35,903
Man cannot own up to the truth
that he loves himself and himself alone.

759
01:25:39,826 --> 01:25:41,355
Let's get back to the point.

760
01:25:42,586 --> 01:25:45,284
If Aryaa stays alive,

761
01:25:46,038 --> 01:25:48,985
she will ruin everything

762
01:25:51,318 --> 01:25:52,930
we've achieved so far.

763
01:25:55,077 --> 01:26:00,272
Now you need to decide
if you are on my side or not.

764
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,809
You are a demon, a demon!

765
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:15,554
I will not let you kill my child.

766
01:26:46,151 --> 01:26:47,564
Sunil..

767
01:26:49,188 --> 01:26:53,861
Sunil..Sunil shoot him, shoot him!

768
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,091
He will kill Aryaa, Sunil!

769
01:26:57,527 --> 01:26:58,824
Shoot him..

770
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:03,244
shoot him, he will kill Aryaa.

771
01:27:24,954 --> 01:27:26,606
No! no! Sunil?

772
01:27:30,785 --> 01:27:33,293
No! no!

773
01:27:49,258 --> 01:27:53,046
Aryaa..Aryaa!!

774
01:29:31,694 --> 01:29:33,173
Where have we come?

775
01:29:33,293 --> 01:29:37,826
Hmm? My friend John works here

776
01:29:38,838 --> 01:29:40,524
It's your birthday tomorrow, right?

777
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:44,416
We can rest here for the
night and start off tomorrow.

778
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:06,866
John!

779
01:30:24,835 --> 01:30:25,761
What happened?

780
01:30:27,612 --> 01:30:28,373
Sir?

781
01:30:31,586 --> 01:30:32,190
Pooja.

782
01:30:32,671 --> 01:30:34,409
She's stopping us from going inside.

783
01:30:36,156 --> 01:30:39,753
But Ravi ji,
I can't see anyone over there.

784
01:30:40,592 --> 01:30:42,063
I have seen her.

785
01:30:48,783 --> 01:30:53,496
Hold this gun and shoot
only when I tell you to.

786
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:55,892
- But Sir..
- But why should he shoot?

787
01:30:56,506 --> 01:30:57,907
And whom will he shoot?

788
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:01,981
You are tired,
let's rest here for a while.

789
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:05,440
Yes Sir, Aryaa is right, you are tired..

790
01:31:06,022 --> 01:31:10,346
Now you two stop playing doctor-doctor!

791
01:31:11,244 --> 01:31:14,065
I take orders only from my Pooja.

792
01:31:16,152 --> 01:31:20,812
Now come on, take the side entry. Go.

793
01:31:26,466 --> 01:31:27,676
John?

794
01:31:31,605 --> 01:31:32,479
What was that?

795
01:31:32,678 --> 01:31:33,595
Don't know yaa

796
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:35,022
He saw his wife.

797
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:37,590
John?

798
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,692
Did you hear that?

799
01:32:14,585 --> 01:32:19,912
Brother, stop it! Stop it now

800
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:22,654
Brother, stop it!

801
01:32:22,983 --> 01:32:26,339
Guruji says if we can achieve
our ends through gentle means,

802
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,089
we shouldn't resort to violence

803
01:32:29,444 --> 01:32:31,546
Otherwise, what's the difference
between us and the rest of the world ?

804
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:32,540
Who's that?

805
01:32:32,911 --> 01:32:33,759
Rajesh!

806
01:32:34,062 --> 01:32:35,368
Jai Guru ji.

807
01:32:37,081 --> 01:32:40,921
Listen, we have nothing against you two

808
01:32:42,002 --> 01:32:46,430
We are here to simply follow
the instructions of our Guru.

809
01:32:47,745 --> 01:32:53,116
Now tell us where Aryaa is.

810
01:32:54,594 --> 01:32:55,909
Spit it out.

811
01:32:57,353 --> 01:32:59,801
If you don't, I will shoot.

812
01:33:08,198 --> 01:33:09,962
Should I be killed?

813
01:33:10,671 --> 01:33:12,531
Or set free?

814
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:19,137
What is to be done with me?..

815
01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:22,613
Phew!

816
01:33:22,864 --> 01:33:24,931
What kind of a man is this?

817
01:33:25,943 --> 01:33:29,627
You pull a gun on him
and he starts singing!

818
01:33:33,104 --> 01:33:34,842
But what about his friend?

819
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:49,891
Don't worry about me Ravi,

820
01:33:51,578 --> 01:33:53,247
- don't say a word..
- Shut up.

821
01:33:54,751 --> 01:33:59,084
Listen, I will ask one last time

822
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:03,322
After that, I will kill him

823
01:34:04,282 --> 01:34:06,184
Tell us where the two of them are.

824
01:34:08,191 --> 01:34:09,506
Where is Aryaa?

825
01:34:10,648 --> 01:34:13,164
Spit it out, or I will kill him.

826
01:34:13,537 --> 01:34:16,823
Shoot..come on Shoot..

827
01:34:17,999 --> 01:34:19,738
Shoot, I say!

828
01:34:24,027 --> 01:34:25,497
Jai Guruji

829
01:34:25,921 --> 01:34:26,751
Aryaa!!!

830
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:28,585
Vishal...

831
01:34:45,434 --> 01:34:46,662
Vishal!

832
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:45,314
Sorry

833
01:35:54,634 --> 01:35:56,896
How did they come
to know that we are here?

834
01:35:58,425 --> 01:35:59,719
I was the one who phoned,

835
01:36:00,826 --> 01:36:02,051
for your safety,

836
01:36:05,178 --> 01:36:06,189
I am sorry.

837
01:36:09,371 --> 01:36:10,713
How was I to know

838
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:15,487
that in this Kalyug children
can't trust their own fathers?

839
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:17,486
What?

840
01:36:18,656 --> 01:36:21,576
Wha...What is he saying?

841
01:36:23,156 --> 01:36:32,134
I am the only path through
which humanity will benefit..

842
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:38,084
To protect me is to protect life,

843
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:43,774
I am love, an ocean of love.

844
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,267
Jai Guruji.

845
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:49,073
Nandini's last rites
are being performed.

846
01:36:52,489 --> 01:36:53,942
Is the Aryaa job done?

847
01:36:59,131 --> 01:37:00,057
Daddy?

848
01:38:21,148 --> 01:38:24,184
I love you Pooja.. I love you..

849
01:38:28,058 --> 01:38:31,639
Ravi, let's take the
kids and leave this place.

850
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:35,099
Ravi?

851
01:38:39,182 --> 01:38:43,298
Remember, you said I
will have to live, somehow?

852
01:38:44,189 --> 01:38:45,469
Remember?

853
01:38:45,728 --> 01:38:46,420
Yes

854
01:38:47,615 --> 01:38:52,631
And you also said that I
am not meant to die such a death?

855
01:38:53,328 --> 01:38:58,275
Yes, Pooja too wants the same thing

856
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:05,020
I kept wondering... In this big city,

857
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:09,170
why did this child come
knocking on my door, of all places

858
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,847
Do you know why?

859
01:39:14,559 --> 01:39:17,482
Because I had to live for this moment

860
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:23,528
Now Pooja will have to wait,

861
01:39:24,816 --> 01:39:27,246
because I have to live for this child.

862
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,690
Will you do something for me?

863
01:39:36,706 --> 01:39:37,934
What, Ravi?

864
01:39:43,633 --> 01:39:47,031
Ram Naam Satya Hai.

865
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:50,524
What?

866
01:39:54,009 --> 01:39:56,721
Ram Naam Satya Hai.

867
01:40:06,357 --> 01:40:12,411
Yogesh, even if Aryaa
knows the truth now,

868
01:40:13,849 --> 01:40:16,097
how does it matter?

869
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:23,848
Who will believe that mentally ill girl?

870
01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:32,757
But the screenplay
we had written together

871
01:40:33,352 --> 01:40:41,763
in which Nandini was supposed to
be the villain has been ruined by you.

872
01:40:44,519 --> 01:40:46,963
What's done is done, Gyaan.

873
01:40:56,684 --> 01:41:01,386
Now we have to set up a new villain

874
01:41:02,803 --> 01:41:09,927
on whom we can pin Aryaa's murder.

875
01:41:13,895 --> 01:41:18,554
I am worried about that taxi driver,

876
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:25,920
what if he blurts out the truth?

877
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:29,558
So?

878
01:41:31,438 --> 01:41:33,027
So what, Gyaan?

879
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:37,492
Anyone can tell the truth

880
01:41:40,509 --> 01:41:52,400
But only we can fool the whole world
with a lie cunningly disguised as truth.

881
01:41:53,979 --> 01:41:56,920
Breaking news.
Joint Commissioner Rajesh Puri,

882
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,395
who was investigating the Aryaa
Desai kidnap case, has gone missing.

883
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:08,410
According to Aryaa Desai's father,
Yogesh, she was kidnapped recently

884
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:14,292
The police has filed a case against Ravi
Kishore and Munna Chavan in this matter.

885
01:42:14,412 --> 01:42:18,043
And here's what Aryaa's father
Yogesh Desai has to say about the case.

886
01:42:18,304 --> 01:42:20,239
That boy is a criminal

887
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,088
He and his taxi driver
called me a while ago,

888
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:27,255
demanding 20 crores
as ransom for my daughter.

889
01:42:30,099 --> 01:42:36,379
Now it's up to you whether you want to
trust a father, or a couple of criminals.

890
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:40,607
But the truth will triumph in the end.

891
01:42:41,528 --> 01:42:42,901
Jai Guruji.

892
01:42:46,037 --> 01:42:49,702
Umm.. Do you want coffee? Hmm?

893
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:51,702
Phone.

894
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:55,464
I need your phone.

895
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:33,375
I am the only path through
which humanity will be served.

896
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:36,618
Hello?

897
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:40,951
Thank you, Daddy, thank you so much.

898
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:45,633
What a father you are!

899
01:43:46,509 --> 01:43:47,760
Please don't disconnect the phone.

900
01:43:49,533 --> 01:43:50,709
Don't be a coward.

901
01:43:55,872 --> 01:43:57,575
I marvel at you!

902
01:44:00,084 --> 01:44:02,618
You've changed the whole
meaning of fatherhood.

903
01:44:05,367 --> 01:44:06,837
What a strange world it is,

904
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:12,849
where fathers have
to kill their daughters.

905
01:44:14,968 --> 01:44:16,222
And for what?

906
01:44:17,606 --> 01:44:18,747
For Money?

907
01:44:19,093 --> 01:44:20,296
For power?

908
01:44:22,302 --> 01:44:24,464
You could have asked for it all, Daddy.

909
01:44:25,303 --> 01:44:26,765
I would have given it to you.

910
01:44:30,743 --> 01:44:33,943
I always thought that at
least your family is your own.

911
01:44:35,664 --> 01:44:38,423
Which is why I left home
to seek revenge on Nandini Maa.

912
01:44:39,945 --> 01:44:42,972
How could I know that
my own blood is tainted,

913
01:44:43,352 --> 01:44:48,221
that my own father wants me killed?

914
01:44:50,487 --> 01:44:53,393
And what will you do with all the money?

915
01:44:54,353 --> 01:44:58,374
Do you too plan to remain
immortal like your Guru?

916
01:45:03,278 --> 01:45:05,319
The world will have to know the truth,

917
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:09,401
because what you are trying
to tell the world is nothing but lies.

918
01:45:10,879 --> 01:45:14,140
You have killed both my mothers.

919
01:45:14,814 --> 01:45:18,403
Don't think that I will do nothing
about this because you are my father.

920
01:45:18,741 --> 01:45:22,762
Don't think I am broken and crushed.
I haven't given up.

921
01:45:23,038 --> 01:45:26,186
I will destroy you completely.

922
01:46:25,339 --> 01:46:31,704
Happy Birthday to you,
Happy Birthday to you,

923
01:46:32,298 --> 01:46:39,014
Happy Birthday Dear Misha,
Happy Birthday to you.

924
01:46:42,175 --> 01:46:43,483
Is everything alright?

925
01:46:44,207 --> 01:46:45,915
Have I walked into the wrong house?

926
01:46:46,174 --> 01:46:52,153
You idiot, I wanted to give
the kids a surprise, but you spoiled it.

927
01:46:53,396 --> 01:46:55,109
Did you get the name
written correctly on the cake?

928
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:59,372
Yes, of course.
I followed everything you said to the T.

929
01:47:00,634 --> 01:47:03,601
Come on kids, it's party time! Come on!

930
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,273
My new life begins today.

931
01:47:15,155 --> 01:47:18,588
And in this life, all I need is Vishal

932
01:47:20,681 --> 01:47:22,168
and you by my side.

933
01:47:24,071 --> 01:47:25,558
If you had not been there..

934
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:28,681
Thank you!

935
01:51:17,449 --> 01:51:19,060
Ravi, you remember

936
01:51:19,687 --> 01:51:24,865
you used to say that you are
master of the journey before it starts..

937
01:51:26,962 --> 01:51:32,000
..but once it starts, it's
the journey that becomes the master.

938
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:38,690
Look how this journey made you a father!

939
01:51:40,907 --> 01:51:42,744
Now swear on God

940
01:51:44,193 --> 01:51:52,291
and make this world as clean
as a fairytale for these kids.

941
01:52:18,476 --> 01:52:19,709
Who's this bugger?

942
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:28,638
Hey, get out!

943
01:52:30,378 --> 01:52:31,805
Nobody died here.

944
01:52:32,205 --> 01:52:33,384
Now they will!

945
01:52:47,213 --> 01:52:49,040
Hmm? Ok,

946
01:52:50,294 --> 01:52:53,916
Guruji's chartered is ready, Sir.

947
01:52:54,738 --> 01:52:55,441
Hmm

948
01:53:00,284 --> 01:53:02,155
Why are you staring at me?

949
01:53:03,494 --> 01:53:06,705
Nothing new happens in this world.

950
01:53:08,002 --> 01:53:12,402
Even Arjun had to disguise
himself as Brihannala.

951
01:53:25,991 --> 01:53:27,461
We have security.

952
01:53:31,267 --> 01:53:34,283
Om, take him to the airport
through the back roads, okay?

953
01:53:34,532 --> 01:53:36,219
I will be there soon.

954
01:53:50,586 --> 01:53:51,591
Guruji!

955
01:53:55,664 --> 01:53:56,936
Hey, who are you?

956
01:53:57,783 --> 01:53:58,968
Who sent you here?

957
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:01,295
What are you doing here?

958
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:06,190
I am His messenger,
I have been sent by Him.

959
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:10,022
You all have made a mess of things here.

960
01:54:11,509 --> 01:54:13,611
Now you will have to answer to Him.

961
01:54:14,164 --> 01:54:15,816
Are you crazy?

962
01:54:16,369 --> 01:54:19,042
Get lost, or get ready to die.

963
01:54:20,573 --> 01:54:21,810
Heaven!

964
01:54:23,081 --> 01:54:25,494
Heaven is opening its doors for me.

965
01:54:30,389 --> 01:54:35,526
But before I go there,
I will finish you all.

966
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:39,452
Ram Naam Satya Hai.

967
01:54:50,193 --> 01:54:52,978
Ram Naam Satya Hai.

968
01:54:53,773 --> 01:54:54,725
Prashant?

969
01:54:55,339 --> 01:54:56,281
Satish?

970
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,637
Anyone there? Can you hear me?

971
01:55:00,286 --> 01:55:03,486
Ram Naam Satya Hai

972
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,867
Ram Naam Satya Hai

973
01:55:16,959 --> 01:55:19,874
Ram Naam Satya Hai

974
01:55:21,241 --> 01:55:24,207
Ram Naam Satya Hai

975
01:55:25,246 --> 01:55:26,716
Ram Naam..

976
01:55:39,967 --> 01:55:42,821
Ram Naam Satya Hai

977
01:55:59,849 --> 01:56:02,695
Did hearing the name of Lord Ram

978
01:56:03,499 --> 01:56:06,716
send you running to hide
in darkness Bhagwaan ji?

979
01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:14,223
Where are you?

980
01:56:34,225 --> 01:56:35,488
Die!

981
01:56:36,526 --> 01:56:37,676
Die!

982
01:56:46,577 --> 01:56:47,900
Die!

983
01:57:08,661 --> 01:57:15,607
I..I..don't kill me..don't..

984
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:46,470
Ram Naam Satya Hai.

985
01:58:19,195 --> 01:58:22,305
Ram Naam Satya Hai

986
01:59:08,825 --> 01:59:12,494
Ravi.. Ravi,
wake up, we have to save Misha,

987
01:59:13,362 --> 01:59:14,080
Ravi?

988
01:59:42,962 --> 01:59:44,366
Why do you want to kill me?

989
01:59:45,613 --> 01:59:46,205
Why?

990
01:59:46,986 --> 01:59:50,411
That crazy girl Aryaa
has sent you, right?

991
01:59:51,215 --> 01:59:52,849
To kill her own father?

992
01:59:54,742 --> 01:59:56,470
How much money did she give you?

993
01:59:56,959 --> 01:59:58,245
How much? Huh?

994
01:59:58,568 --> 02:00:01,874
I will give you much more,
how much do you want?

995
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:05,631
How much? Tell me

996
02:00:05,751 --> 02:00:09,174
How much do you want?
How much more? How much?

997
02:00:15,692 --> 02:00:19,488
Pooja Travels and Tours.

998
02:00:21,445 --> 02:00:23,749
Service with Security.

999
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:33,212
My Misha will not die again.

1000
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:38,995
No, no, please,
I have made a grave mistake.

1001
02:00:40,803 --> 02:00:43,099
I have made a grave mistake.

1002
02:00:48,246 --> 02:00:54,535
I fell under the influence of my Guru,
and committed a grave sin.

1003
02:00:56,367 --> 02:01:00,659
What I did to Aryaa --forgive me,

1004
02:01:01,993 --> 02:01:03,153
I made a mistake

1005
02:01:06,995 --> 02:01:13,450
Just let me pay homage one last time,

1006
02:01:15,524 --> 02:01:20,093
Then I will do whatever
you ask me to, whatever.

1007
02:01:21,395 --> 02:01:25,751
Just once,
please, let me offer homage just once?

1008
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:40,989
No no.. you can't
die until you hear me out!

1009
02:01:41,597 --> 02:01:44,667
Just tell me,
why did you do all this? Huh?

1010
02:01:45,779 --> 02:01:47,539
For love, and God?

1011
02:01:49,456 --> 02:01:56,731
I wonder who spread the
rumor that love and God exist!

1012
02:01:58,412 --> 02:02:01,994
From darkness we come,
and to darkness we shall return

1013
02:02:03,193 --> 02:02:05,568
There's no sin, or goodness.

1014
02:02:06,768 --> 02:02:09,458
There's no heaven, or hell

1015
02:02:10,769 --> 02:02:13,736
There's no one up there.

1016
02:02:14,715 --> 02:02:19,955
And if there is a God, it is I.

1017
02:02:31,695 --> 02:02:35,191
Har Har Mahadev!

1018
02:03:09,227 --> 02:03:10,063
Ravi,

1019
02:03:13,843 --> 02:03:14,672
lets go!

1020
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,898
The stranger

1021
02:04:56,841 --> 02:05:01,161
who gave his life to save mine

1022
02:05:03,292 --> 02:05:04,979
was no murderer,

1023
02:05:06,489 --> 02:05:07,929
he was my savior.

1024
02:05:10,859 --> 02:05:15,446
That stranger saved
me from my own father,

1025
02:05:16,137 --> 02:05:20,270
that father who first killed
my mother to grab her wealth,

1026
02:05:21,128 --> 02:05:25,232
and then, with the help of Gyaan Prakaash
and his so-called army, tried to kill me too.

1027
02:05:26,495 --> 02:05:28,024
He is a witness to that.

1028
02:05:35,689 --> 02:05:38,727
A country doesn't change overnight.

1029
02:05:40,375 --> 02:05:45,070
Bringing electricity to every corner of
the country will not wipe out darkness.

1030
02:05:46,431 --> 02:05:51,600
We will have to join hands
to fight against blind faith, as one.

1031
02:05:53,415 --> 02:05:57,528
I request the Government
to take action against those

1032
02:05:58,248 --> 02:06:03,367
who have exploited innocent
people in the name of God,

1033
02:06:05,024 --> 02:06:07,796
and driven them to wrong practices.

1034
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:10,292
Those who have turned
God into a business.

1035
02:06:10,913 --> 02:06:11,909
One more thing,

1036
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:17,916
I want to let the

1037
02:06:20,046 --> 02:06:25,265
body of Yogesh Desai
rot in the government morgue.

1038
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:29,685
Because I will perform the last rites

1039
02:06:33,847 --> 02:06:35,554
for Ravi Kishore only.

1040
02:06:47,865 --> 02:06:52,600
This journey has made
one thing clear to me.

1041
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,855
Fatherhood is an emotion.

1042
02:07:06,802 --> 02:07:10,639
Ravi Kishore is the father I never had.

1043
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:30,166
Thank you, thank you.

1044
02:07:39,192 --> 02:07:44,761
Om Namah Shivaye

1045
02:07:46,056 --> 02:07:51,494
Om Namah Shivaye

1046
02:07:52,907 --> 02:07:59,189
Om Namah Shivaye

1047
02:08:22,552 --> 02:08:23,361
Misha?
