1
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,961
Mama, when you go back,
where will you live?

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,367
When you go back to Cape Verde,
where will you live?

3
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,006
I'll build myself a home.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,125
- Close to your mama's?
- Right on top of hers.

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,323
Her house only has one storey?

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,249
You would raise a storey?

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,886
- Is that it?
- I guess so.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,890
- Is there space for a garden?
- A garden?

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,331
Not even for a decent house,
never mind a garden!

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,322
- But is there no yard?
- The house was built on the yard.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,526
And papa's old house?

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,530
Forget papa's house.
It's a wreck.

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,563
It's up on the hill in Mourão.

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,921
There's no-one there.
It's no use.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,088
- Is it abandoned?
- Abandoned.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,202
A hangout for rats and lizards.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,005
- Then I could have it.
- What for?

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,009
To be there on your own?

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,521
I'd live there. Do it up.

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,442
And papa's folks?

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,723
Your uncle Santo's the only one left.
He's in Milho Branco.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,289
- In grandma's house?
- You should see the garden he has.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,323
- Manioc, potatoes, the lot...
- What about our house?

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,923
- I told you, it's abandoned.
- Is it really yours?

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,010
- No-one else has lived there.
- How come?

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,690
Everyone is gone.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,406
- Then let's go there.
- Who, me?

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,764
Out in the sticks with no water,
no light, no nothing?

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,721
Here I have water, light,
and all I need!

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,801
- Maybe I could live there.
- No way!

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,163
All alone with an oil lamp?

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,881
No lamp could lighten that darkness.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,809
That's why everyone left.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,605
It's no life.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,520
- But our house is still there?
- Course it is! It's big.

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,802
Three bedrooms.
A large living room.

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,685
Looking onto a nice avenue.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,010
A marble floor. All fixed up.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,364
My old place! I miss you!
I spent loads of money on it.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,802
- And can we not sell it?
- Who would buy it?

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,209
They've all fled
and won't be going back!

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,804
Maybe some poor bastard
who's sent back there...

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,809
Whoever's sent back
will find nothing but misery.

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,321
- What's it called again?
- Mourão.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,442
It's in Montinho.

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,050
Montinho or Montijo?

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,122
Montinho,
Achada Ungueira, Raçatchó,

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,891
Montinho de Cima, Montinho de Baixo,

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,091
Milho Branco.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Papa's house was here,
grandma's was here, right?

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,451
Together?

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,843
All this talk is making me want
to go back. Rest these bones...

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,362
Mama, is it far from Santana?

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,767
A friend of mine is in Santana.

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,805
Santana is over by Assomada.
He's in Cape Verde?

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,570
He was sent back.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,682
He was in prison.
Now they've sent him back.

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,328
Must be hard for him...

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,885
Listen to her,
answering all Cape Verde...

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,487
It makes me all warm thinking about it.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,369
What about that guy who sends people
to meet their maker?

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,891
He only kills grown-ups.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,482
He slips them a letter
without them noticing.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,011
He slips it into their pocket?

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,728
He hides it on their motorbike,
in their car. No-one notices.

66
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,404
Then he appears and asks
for what they were given for him.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,242
He says, "Search your pockets."

68
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,091
The person finds the paper
and he says, "Come with me."

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,771
And they go with him.

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,927
Then he bores a hole in their head,

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,850
sucks their blood
and goes on his way.

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,088
Holy shit.

73
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,083
He doesn't eat them.
Just sucks their blood and goes.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,282
He takes the people <i>to...</i>

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,801
To the bush, to the wilds...

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,289
- So, he's a bit of a devil?
- He's terror in person!

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,244
- We must follow him?
- Yes!

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,442
When he says, "Come with me!",

79
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,360
he has taken hold of their spirit.
They're at his mercy.

80
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,841
All they can do is go with him.

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,202
To their sad fate.
Then he's off again.

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,365
They say he approaches children,
"Take this letter to such-and-such."

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,930
He doesn't go near children.

84
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,771
But a kid might take the letter
to those who are going to die.

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,241
Like when a person goes shopping...

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,284
- And he's in the cafe?
- Yes, in the grocery store.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,962
The person is in the shop.
He weighs the sugar or the rice

88
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,563
and wraps the sugar or the rice
in the paper.

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,127
It's his wicked ways.

90
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,004
Or you're walking along
and meet the man.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,248
"Give me what they gave you for me."

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,284
"I haven't got anything."
"You have it right there."

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,164
And if you don't give it to him?

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,442
He shows you it
and then kills you.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,882
- I would pretend...
- It's no use.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,571
You're already a goner!

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,251
I would fool him...

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,771
You're already a goner.

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,762
Once, a woman asked a boy

100
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,885
to do some errands for her.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,289
The poor boy went into town,
did the shopping for her.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,530
He came out of the shop.
And there he was.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,529
The man said to him,

104
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,682
"Take out of your bundle
what was given to you for me."

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,203
The boy took out the paper
and gave it to him.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,803
The woman was never seen again.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,241
And the boy went after the man.

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,161
He was found three days later,

109
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,807
down by the sea,
behind some rocks.

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,922
His head was split open. Dead.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,046
But he came back to say
he was given the thing that kills.

112
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,850
"That night I went up the hill,
I fell and died.

113
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,645
"But it was he who killed me."

114
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,201
My condolences, José Alberto.

115
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,249
Is he drunk or what?

116
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,640
Life nowadays is a funny thing!

117
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,645
<i>I went working abroad</i>

118
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,684
<i>The boss gave me the sack</i>

119
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,167
<i>My wife went and left me</i>

120
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,442
<i>With but the shirt on my back</i>

121
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,281
He'll never catch a rabbit like that!

122
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,440
Your father was a good bricklayer.
He was a good friend.

123
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,211
My father never gave me a thing.

124
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,129
Not even a pair of underpants.

125
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,601
At the weekend
he would take all my brothers out

126
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,961
and leave me behind.

127
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,364
When he died
I was doing time, open system.

128
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,251
They called me to say he had died.

129
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,726
They gave me leave,
so I could go to the cemetery.

130
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,323
I saw those men who bury people,
the gravediggers,

131
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,842
I took a shovel and buried my father.

132
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,170
You had a fall far from here.

133
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,009
It was Friday.

134
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,924
I was all confused.

135
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,123
I wandered through all that wasteland.

136
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't know where I'd landed.

137
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,806
I didn't know anybody,
nobody knew me.

138
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,321
I wandered around for hours.

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,409
Night fell.

140
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,288
I found a restaurant
and went in to eat.

141
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,449
I ordered soup, food, wine.

142
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,369
They brought it.

143
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,450
I 3128,

144
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,963
then stayed there for a while,

145
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,564
chatting to the people.

146
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,130
Then I got up and left.

147
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,891
The man came after me,

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,325
"You eat, drink,
and then leave without a word?"

149
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,841
He called the police.
The police grabbed me.

150
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,640
They took me away
to the station...

151
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,765
I don't know what they did with me.

152
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,283
They left me lying
by the train station,

153
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,890
on the wasteland there.

154
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,322
Nobody knew me
and I knew nobody.

155
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,842
- So, they killed you?
- I don't know about that!

156
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,769
Look, Ventura, a rabbit!

157
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,929
That's a female.

158
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,841
Néné used to cook good rabbit for me,
with potatoes.

159
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,611
- Real rabbit?
- You bet!

160
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,484
With bay leaf and white wine.

161
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,891
Néné is dead too.

162
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,009
He died young.

163
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,451
Forty-something, wasn't he?

164
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,642
A bit older, I think.

165
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,161
They didn't bury you
with your gold tooth.

166
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,931
They must have used it
to pay for the funeral.

167
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,682
Your face was all smashed up.

168
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,167
When I first came here
there were no houses.

169
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,521
Those buildings over there?

170
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,841
At the time
you couldn't come here at night.

171
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,490
- They would beat you?
- Beat you, kill you!

172
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,090
Whites or blacks?

173
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,010
The white guys were doing it.

174
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,922
