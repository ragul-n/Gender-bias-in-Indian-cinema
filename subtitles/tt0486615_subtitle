'But I don't regret any ofit.'

6
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,221
'Show me one person in theworId..'

7
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,725
'..who hasn't done something
good, something bad..'

8
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,230
'..or something verybad,
to achieve his biggest dream.'

9
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,067
'Even ifthere is someone..'

10
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,399
'..it doesn't makea
differenceto me.'

11
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,741
'Because, my dream wiII be
fuIfiIIed in next 30 seconds.'

12
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,412
30 seconds to go, Arjun.

13
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,764
'It aII started in Punjab
during my schooI days.'

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,945
ChiIdren, one by one telI mewhat

I want to beapiIot.

00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,278
I wantto be MaikaIaI Jaikishen.

18
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,518
Keep quiet.

19
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,094
Thatmeans you wantto be
apop star, Arjun.

20
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,793
Have you toIdthis your father?

21
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,566
'Have you Iost your mind?'

22
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,965
'Remember, no one from this famiIy
has ever been associatedwith music.'

23
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,732
'IfI ever hear you even humming again..'
'..I'II skin you alive.

24
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,136
Get back to work.'

25
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:36,146
I didn't ask your friendthere.

26
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,909
Teacher, I don't wantto grow up onIy.

27
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,348
Therearemany probIems
in growing up.

28
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,517
'Music is my hobby..
everything forme.'

29
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,349
'And, I wanted to carve
aniche for myseIf.'

30
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,358
Mannu, I wantto reach to the top.

31
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,727
Anyhow.At any cost.

32
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,062
If you want to becomea
successfuI pop star go ahead.

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,568
What's theprobIem?

34
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,264
Father. He'II makemesIave
to death in his restaurant.

35
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,343
Why does your father
hate music so much?

36
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,376
Becauseofmy grandfather.

37
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,481
Father beIieves my grandfather
is theone responsibIe..

38
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,210
..forthesorry stateof our famiIytoday.

39
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,186
He keeps praying everyday..
..that I forsakemyhobby ofmusic.

40
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,054
And, I pray everyday as welI that,
''How can you Iisten to him?''.

41
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,491
'God bestowed me with
theknack for music.'

42
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,491
'He even gavemethetaIent to Iearn music.'

43
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,733
'Then, how couId Hetake
meaway from music?'

44
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,403
'How couId Hekeep me from
achieving my fame in music?'

45
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,873
So Lord, cIear every obstruction
in my path to success.

46
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:16,845
Stupid, you wish in such a detaiIed pattern
alongwith the reasons.

47
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,915
Doesn't the Lord get bored of you?

48
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,081
Just watch, Mannu, God wiII sureIy
do something for me.

49
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,892
What is the matter?

50
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,623
'UnknowingIy, I hadwished
for my father's death.'

51
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,130
'God had cIeared aII the
obstructions in my path.'

52
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,973
'In return,
I made apromise to Him.'

53
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,476
'TIII I fuIfiII my dream..'

54
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,141
'..I won't Iet anything distract me.'

55
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,019
UncIe...

56
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,164

Your father hated music, and so do I.

Every memberof our famiIy does.

61
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,722
Andwe also havea reason for it.

62
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,562
If you ever pIay itagain,
I'II smash it to pieces.

63
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,695
Get that.

64

Listen to me.

You'II Iearn music by practicing.

72
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,394
'Days, months and years.'

73
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,799
I never kept track ofthem,
IikenormaI peopIe.'

74
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,074
'The onIything I kept track of..'
'..was how much I haveIearned,

75
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,973
and how much I stiII haveto.'

'..I thought, God has written
my story differentIy.'

80
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,121
'That's whyI decidedto
take a different path.'

81
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,707

When you aren't focused about your goaI

155
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,709
If you deviate from the path,
you Iose your destination.

156
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:34,984
My destination,

157
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,655

I mean, at times Sita
and at times Gita.

308
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,343
It's not myhobby, but my helpIessness.

309
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,612
I was born in a very

Because, I never had anyinterest
in anything else.

00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:25,294
This is thesamepIace, because
ofwhich father hated music.

508

00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,732
It was his first chance to

515
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:11,966
But seeing the hugecrowd,
he just couIdn't sing.

516
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:18,647
When hewas given this big chance
his music faiIed him.

Mr. Mannu, who are your

929
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,220

931
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:53,692

But.. I don'twant our differences
to haveany effect on the band.

1487
02:00:45,238 --> 02:00:47,001
On Arjun's dreams.

1488
02:00:48,874 --> 02:00:55,677
That's why, we'II work together
onIy as professionaIs.

1489
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:51,300
I Ieft everthing for her.

1490
02:01:52,204 --> 02:01:54,399

You won't beabIe to perform welI.

But this show is veryimportant
for aII ofus.

1496
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,092
EspeciaIIy, forArjun.

1497
02:02:23,636 --> 02:02:24,330
Here.

1498
02:02:27,139 --> 02:02:28,106
Whatis it?

1499
02:02:28,974 --> 02:02:32,102
Go here, and takeit.

1500
02:02:35,314 --> 02:02:37,782
It's cIoseby. But don't
taketoo much. Okay.

1501
02:02:39,919 --> 02:02:44,947
And remember, comeback befor
Arjun's soIo, okay?. - Sure.

1502
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:46,951
Comesoon.

1503
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:01,031
Where is hegoing?

1504
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,140
And,what was that chit
that you gave him?

1505
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:07,138
It was theaddress of a drug-deaIer.
- What?

1506
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,474
It's cIose-by.

1507
02:03:09,682 --> 02:03:13,812
You? You know, hewon'tbeabIe
to stop himselfthis time.

1508
02:03:14,019 --> 02:03:15,486
He'II beruined.

1509
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:17,652
That's what I want.
- Why?.

1510
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:21,190
Because, hesnatched away everything
that belongedto Arjun.

1511
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:23,658
Our band, oursongs, Iyrics
whosewere they?

1512
02:03:23,863 --> 02:03:27,822
Arjun's. But, who got the name,
Ioveand fortune Mannu!

1513
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:31,495
So Paris, Rome you did alI that?

1514
02:03:31,704 --> 02:03:33,672
Yes, Paris, Rome,
Press Conference, everything.

1515
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:35,431
And now, WembIey as welI.
I did it.

1516
02:03:35,641 --> 02:03:39,941
Because, tiII he's on stage
Arjun won't get whathedeserves.

1517
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:43,509
And thankfuIIy, he'II never be
abIe to cIimb on stage again.

1518
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:46,681
You scoundreI.. How couId you Zoheb,

I aIways heededwhat you said to me
but I knew that you wereright.

1521
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:56,861
But today, you'rewrong.
- What's wrong in it?

1522
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:59,122
Arjun shouId get the
pIacehedeserves.

1523
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:00,525
By ruining someoneeIse.

1524
02:04:00,733 --> 02:04:02,860
Justbecause he's more
taIented than Arjun.

1525
02:04:05,204 --> 02:04:06,068
TaIent?

1526
02:04:06,872 --> 02:04:08,533
AII hehas is style.

1527
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:10,871
What does he know aboutmusic?

1528
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:15,707
You're mybrother.

1529
02:04:17,116 --> 02:04:18,549
You're mybrother.

1530
02:04:20,753 --> 02:04:22,050
How couId you do this?

1531
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:25,553
How couId you do this?

1532
02:04:51,617 --> 02:04:53,084
30 seconds to go, Arjun

1533
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:21,942
Listen, God! Now the
skies beIong to me.

1534

Now theskies belongto me.

1535

Of victory, of victory, ofvictory.

1544

My dreams have now

1552
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:09,047
It's a celebration of victory.
''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''

1553
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:17,218
It's a celebration of victory.
''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''

1554
02:07:43,856 --> 02:07:50,261
My feet aresore from the
thorns Iying on thepath.

1555
02:07:50,562 --> 02:07:57,263
At pIaces, the ground
was bIazing hot.

1556
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:04,033
I averted, and endured much pain.

1557
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:10,182
But I had no dearth of courage.

1558
02:08:10,382 --> 02:08:13,715
I stood my ground.

1559
02:08:13,919 --> 02:08:17,878
Faced the worst storms.

1560
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:24,552
I foughtagainst darkness,
and snatched Iight from it.

1561
02:08:24,763 --> 02:08:30,861
Itwas my part of dawn,
and your part ofIife.

1562
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:37,634
It's a celebration of victory.
''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''

1563
02:08:37,843 --> 02:08:45,648
It's a celebration of victory.
''Ofvictory, of victory, ofvictory.''

1564
02:09:28,827 --> 02:09:38,031
We want Mannu.

1565
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:51,876
Whereis Mannu? CaII him.

1566
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:53,880
He won't come.

1567
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,127
Mannu won't come. He's finished.

1568
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:16,567
Hey, Iights, Iights, I sayIights.

1569
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:21,645
I put in myIife, my hard
work to win your accIaims.

1570
02:10:21,847 --> 02:10:23,940
And you want Mannu.

1571
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:25,241
Stop it.

1572
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:27,374
Mannu won't come.

1573
02:10:27,586 --> 02:10:30,020
He won't comeat any stage.

1574
02:10:30,222 --> 02:10:31,416
He's ruined.

1575
02:10:31,623 --> 02:10:33,853
Stop it.. He's finished

1576
02:11:23,909 --> 02:11:27,310
Yes, go ahead cIap.

1577
02:11:28,213 --> 02:11:29,805
Takehis name.

1578
02:11:31,216 --> 02:11:34,151
Mannu, seewhat's happening with me.

1579
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:39,318
You caII yourseIf a friend and Iook
at what you'vedone with me.

1580
02:11:40,626 --> 02:11:43,493
Whenever I sing, peopIe stiII
wait for you to sing.

1581
02:11:44,029 --> 02:11:46,156
Whenever I say anything,
they want to hear your voice.

1582
02:11:50,035 --> 02:11:56,565
Hit me, hit me, hit me..go on,
hitme, hit mesomemore.

1583
02:12:01,146 --> 02:12:04,582
It's mymistake, I brought him here.

1584
02:12:05,717 --> 02:12:09,016
But he snatched my fame
and myIove from me.

1585
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:12,682
Yes, Mannu. I Iove Priya.

1586
02:12:14,026 --> 02:12:16,654
Much before you did, and
much more than you do.

1587
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:21,199
But, mytiffisn'twith you.

1588
02:12:22,067 --> 02:12:24,035
It's with God.

1589
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:27,371
Andthat's why, I had to vent
out alI my anger on you.

1590
02:12:30,309 --> 02:12:33,039
Because, Hechose you and not me.

1591
02:12:34,746 --> 02:12:38,045
Hedidn't careabout my efforts,
my hard work.

1592
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:39,717
I asked for it,

1593
02:12:40,185 --> 02:12:41,413
but He gavethetaIentto you.

1594
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:45,556
I Ioved her, but HebIessed
you with that Iove.

1595
02:12:47,926 --> 02:12:50,394
This, fame, honour, music was

1596
02:12:50,996 --> 02:12:53,726
my dream, and not yours.

1597
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:55,897
Then, how can you get it?

1598
02:12:56,969 --> 02:12:59,403
How can themusic you
mocked aII your Iife..

1599
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:02,735
..give you fame?

1600
02:13:04,176 --> 02:13:06,736
How can themusic I worshipped
aII myIife..

1601
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:09,607
..make me unsuccessfuI?

1602
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:13,250
I madethis group.

1603
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:16,884
This is not Manjeet KhosIa's
London Dreams.

1604
02:13:17,189 --> 02:13:20,249
This is my London Dreams
damn it!

1605
02:13:22,227 --> 02:13:23,421
Go to heII.

1606
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:31,555
Can I comeinside?

1607
02:15:42,767 --> 02:15:46,066
I'veheard you don't meet
anyonethesedays.

1608
02:15:47,739 --> 02:15:49,400
Don't even take caIIs.

1609
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:52,236
Don't go out.

1610
02:15:54,946 --> 02:15:56,743
How IongwiII you keep
running from the worId?

1611
02:15:59,784 --> 02:16:01,411
TheworId is over for me.

1612
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:04,412
What's the useofrunning from it?

1613
02:16:10,495 --> 02:16:12,258
TheworId is stiII there, Son.

1614
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:14,755
You don't see it.

1615
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:20,268
Weoften havethis misunderstanding
thatwe'II be famous

1616
02:16:20,872 --> 02:16:23,067
atwhat we're good at.

1617
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:27,443
Yourgrandfatherwas
a very good musician.

1618
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:34,615
Buthe..couIdn't endurea singIe
faiIure and gave his Iife.

1619
02:16:35,787 --> 02:16:38,449
You're abetter
musician than hewas.

1620
02:16:39,958 --> 02:16:42,791
But Mannu is moretalented than you.

1621
02:16:44,496 --> 02:16:46,487
You couIdn'tacceptthis.

1622
02:16:46,698 --> 02:16:50,794
That day, after yourfirst concert
this is whatI wanted to teII you.

1623
02:16:51,703 --> 02:16:55,571
What's the use? It's too Iatenow.

1624
02:16:55,774 --> 02:16:59,107
If you do believein this
don't tryto giveexcuses.

1625
02:16:59,311 --> 02:17:00,972
Go, and get Mannu back.

1626
02:17:07,419 --> 02:17:09,250
How can I go back there?

1627
02:17:12,824 --> 02:17:14,655
Everyone might beaware..

1628
02:17:16,394 --> 02:17:20,854
..ofwhatI did with
my friend in London.

1629
02:17:21,099 --> 02:17:24,000
If you accept your mistake,
what are you afraid of?.

1630
02:17:25,303 --> 02:17:29,137
If you have the courage,
accept Mannu's taIent..

1631
02:17:29,341 --> 02:17:31,400
..and admit your mistake.

1632
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:34,511
Then, you need not fear
