1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,480
There is nothing now for us
other than meditation

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:34,158
Panduranga is in my heart and
my soul, waking and sleeping

3
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:41,821
He pervades my senses

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,077
He pervades my being

5
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:20,470
He is no more outside of me

6
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:28,500
Panduranga is my consciousness

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:51,000
Tuka says I know
His loved image

8
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:20,200
Standing still and moving
on the same brick

9
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,620
It is me who composed this

10
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
We composed this song

11
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,000
Tuka simply puts his name to it

12
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,141
And says the composition is his

13
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,977
He becomes a saint for it

14
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,000
The rogue!

15
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Tuka does the same with all
his devotional songs

16
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,665
Salomalo composes them

17
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,700
Tuka put his name to them

18
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,700
So could I

19
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,057
'God stands straight and firm'
says Bambya

20
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:21,858
The man's an out-and-out cheat
but pretends to be a saint

21
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,307
Beads around his neck,
'tanpura' under his arm...

22
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,063
That doesn't make a saint!

23
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,530
Such men... Tuka says

24
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,617
- Salomalo says -

25
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,004
See what happens...

26
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,976
Even I fell into the trap!

27
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,830
But the original goes like this

28
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,617
Salo says such men should
be beaten with shoes

29
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,864
A handful of water

30
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,590
Washes my buffalo clean

31
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,600
Kashi!

32
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,000
Get up and finish your work

33
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm fed up

34
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:29,520
Working for that buffalo

35
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,850
She doesn't give
a drop of milk

36
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:32,990
Bitch!

37
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,880
My father gave her to me and
so you have at least this much

38
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,876
Just because she's gone dry
these last few years

39
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,420
My beautiful one!

40
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,798
She may not give milk but she
gives us dung, doesn't she?

41
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,800
You can drink milk, Ma

42
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,243
You can't eat dung, can you?

43
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,182
Get lost!

44
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:21,130
Mangalai, Goddess of
my mother's home

45
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:40,207
Give plenty of milk to my
beautiful one, my buffalo

46
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,466
I've had my bellyful

47
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,267
I'm fed up. How much can I do?

48
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,751
Do I look after the boy
or the buffalo?

49
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,288
This madcap husband of mine

50
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,088
'Panduranga is my mind...'

51
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:17,088
Pandurang can go to hell!
Come in this minute

52
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,688
Here, the child is ill for a month

53
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:27,183
Is he anywhere in your mind?

54
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,783
Take this child

55
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,155
Careful. The child is ill

56
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,921
What else am I shouting about?

57
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,521
Will you get some medicine?

58
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,121
What better doctor
than Panduranga?

59
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,721
What better medicine than
His Name?

60
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:51,521
Say Panduranga and you'll
feel better

61
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:05,521
I'll pull your tongue out if
you take that name

62
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,530
One madman in the
house is enough

63
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:14,076
Look, how he howls like
an animal

64
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,946
Poor one. What else can he do?

65
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:21,751
You neither leave him with me
nor do you look after him

66
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:25,376
That dried-up buffalo takes
all your time

67
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,297
Don't drag her into this

68
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,650
Because she comes from your
mother's home?

69
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,275
You're damned right.
Anything to say?

70
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,300
If a grinding stone from my
mother's house split my head...

71
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,672
I would not bleed, understand?

72
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,558
My buffalo will give you
milk one day

73
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,315
What has your Black face
done for us?

74
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,670
Ruined my home

75
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Not a scrap to eat

76
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Children ill

77
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,237
He's even dried up buffalo

78
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,639
Don't curse Panduranga

79
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,079
I'll do worse. I'll dump
this child before Him

80
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,600
I'll beat Him awake
and ask Him

81
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,940
Blackface, You've ruined my home

82
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,555
You see this?

83
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,560
His father sings Your
praises day and night

84
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Will You cure him?
Or else

85
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,955
Are you a woman or a monster?

86
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,598
I'm human being. But who
are you to ask me?

87
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,160
Your Blackface...

88
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,558
Ma, look. I'm well

89
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,520
So you are. Oh my pet

90
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:57,325
This is my Mangalai's doing

91
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,400
Mangalai, protect my child

92
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Tuka, do you think God is
a roadside stone?

93
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,515
That shrew of yours
desecrated Him today

94
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,598
Aren't you ashamed?

95
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,115
Oh God. What a sinner I am

96
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,475
Desecration is a great sin

97
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,875
I'll accept any punishment
you give me

98
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,420
There's only one!

99
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,310
You'll not step into this
temple again

100
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,460
I can't enter the temple?

101
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,061
Panduranga is my life

102
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,770
And to desecrate Him
is your prayer

103
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Get out

104
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Please have mercy on me

105
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,650
Give me any other punishment

106
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,320
But don't keep me
away from Him

107
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,000
People would really think
that you're great devotee

108
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,760
If you ever come here again
I will break your leg

109
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,199
Salo says such men should
be beaten with shoes

110
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,390
Panduranga

111
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:55,710
No punishment will ever
absolve me of this sin

112
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:07,690
Your love is all forgiving

113
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,380
How did You forsake me?

114
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,750
But I can't forsake You

115
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,910
Let me fill my eyes
with Your image

116
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,240
I'll not see You again

117
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,235
The thought of You is my life

118
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:06,835
Tuka is worthless

119
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Even urchins and
harlots abuse me

120
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:25,675
I crave to be alone

121
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Only then will all ties snap

122
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:45,110
Pandurang. My mother!

123
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:16,938
Sundara, I am happy today

124
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,938
Ask for anything
and it's yours

125
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,150
What happened?

126
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,435
Something that has never
happened before

127
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,750
I have accomplished
the impossible

128
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,240
Killed a dangerous animal

129
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,950
What gibberish is this?
What animal?

130
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,159
That Tuka!

131
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:48,948
I have driven him out.
Really showed him up

132
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,520
Now, I will be the preacher
and saint around here

133
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,917
They'll all touch my feet

134
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,118
So, sing your nicest song

135
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,717
Shell I sing about God?

136
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,450
About God?

137
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,110
Saints like songs about God

138
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,110
I am no saint when here

139
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,340
I want a juicy love song

140
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:33,957
Youth in its prime
is going to waste

141
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:47,442
Who else but you can
enliven this body?

142
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,983
Why waste your love

143
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,701
Father!

144
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,946
Why are you here?

145
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:57,717
I guessed where you'd be

146
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,910
But why come at all?

147
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,510
Mother!

148
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,937
Is she here too?

149
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:12,277
No, she wants you

150
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,202
Stay here

151
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,221
I'll come tomorrow

152
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:52,796
Ass! Can't babble yet and
wants to chew betel-leaves

153
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,879
- Has he come?
- No

154
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,021
I've scouted whole village.
I can't find father anywhere

155
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,797
- Looked in Blackface's Temple?
- Yes, I did

156
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:15,830
- In the square?
- Yes

157
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:24,417
Must be on the hill then

158
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,336
Kashi, clean it up

159
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,800
Listen, children

160
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,840
You have your meal.
Don't wait for him

161
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,637
After you finish I'll take
food to him

162
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,764
My poor little ones

163
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,317
Won't you eat, Ma?

164
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:38,663
You must. You've not eaten
a morsel since yesterday

165
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,398
You must be very hungry

166
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,785
My own darlings.
Mangalai, keep them safe

167
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,657
My dears, I would not be able
to eat until he has eaten

168
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,608
See how much Ma loves him

169
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,466
He does not love me any less

170
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:06,280
He's never happy when
I am not around

171
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:16,597
Is that why you fight
with him every day?

172
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,656
Rascal!
Eyes on your plates now

173
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,480
I will go, then

174
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:42,597
Look after the house.
Don't quarrel

175
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:10,559
The flowers and trees are
my dear companions

176
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:18,818
The birds sing melodiously

177
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:41,157
In solitude I seek bliss

178
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:47,157
It is pure joy, unqualified

179
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,530
The sky is the shelter,
the earth the bed

180
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,770
We go where our feet carry us

181
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,600
My body is but a blanket
and pitcher

182
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,500
The breeze marks
the time for me

183
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,427
Telling of God's deeds
is food without limit

184
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,496
In it all tastes about

185
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:29,864
Says Tuka, my dialogue
is with myself

186
00:25:30,365 --> 00:25:40,077
And all argument too

187
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,999
What's the matter?
A thorn?

188
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,357
Wait

189
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,980
That's no way to remove it

190
00:26:48,037 --> 00:26:51,617
Quick! That fool of mine...

191
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Tuka?

192
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,977
He's starving since morning

193
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:07,200
He must be faint with hunger

194
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,960
Easy now

195
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:14,837
Brute!

196
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:24,917
What a big thorn!

197
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,564
Your name, grandpa?

198
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,537
Pandurang

199
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,875
What? That Name again?

200
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:46,850
Why not say so before.
I'd have kept the thorn then

201
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:28,062
What are you doing with
your eyes closed?

202
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:33,198
Your dear ones are hoarse
calling out to you

203
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,877
You sit here calling
out to someone else

204
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:40,402
What of your stomach?

205
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,877
Have you gone deaf?

206
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,400
Open your eyes

207
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,190
Have you gone deaf?

208
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,810
Mangalai, he must be starved!

209
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,541
Here, take this

210
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:05,001
Avala, how did you get here?

211
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:08,097
On foot. Climbed up the hill

212
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,683
But how did you know that
I was here?

213
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,200
A man wouldn't know.
It has to be a woman like me

214
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,097
Come on, eat now

215
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,500
This is true devotion

216
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:25,558
Your devotion brought
you to me

217
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,158
I hope mine will lead
me to Panduranga

218
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,100
Him! I'll burn Him alive

219
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,400
Enough. You look so pale

220
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,800
Come, eat now

221
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,020
Avala, have the kids eaten?

222
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:42,140
They were waiting for you

223
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:44,100
Then I told them to eat

224
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,043
What little gems they are

225
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,657
Avala, you too eat with me

226
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:55,750
No, you eat. I've eaten

227
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,700
That's impossible. Come on

228
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,039
No. Let it be

229
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,417
Go on. I'm not
a baby to be fed

230
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,470
There are people watching

231
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,997
How sweet this bread tastes

232
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:28,639
Did I make it?

233
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:37,397
How lucky! Panduranga's
blessed me with such a wife

234
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,043
Him! It was my father who
blessed you with me

235
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,264
Don't mention that
Blackface before me

236
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,957
Avala, do you really
not love my Vitthala (Panduranga)?

237
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,957
You might think your
God is great

238
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,790
But mine is still greater

239
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:00,961
Greater than Vitthala?

240
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,270
- Mangalai?
- No

241
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,400
Then what's your God's name?

242
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:13,544
His name? Be quiet and eat

243
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,590
What a silly question!

244
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,400
My God is eating with me

245
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,390
Does your God ever
come and eat with you?

246
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,410
He only knows how to ruin
people's homes

247
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,590
He's made of stone

248
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,557
What does He know of
flesh-and-blood people

249
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,778
It's really bad for the kids

250
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,999
They must have at least
rags to wear

251
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:59,490
And stale bread to put
in their stomachs

252
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,350
But you can't get milk
out of a stone

253
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:12,738
Better to look after the kids
than to run after Him!

254
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:25,380
Poor starved kids
Oh Panduranga

255
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,579
What can He tell you?

256
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,857
He's not going to give
you flour for bread

257
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:37,677
There isn't a grain in the
house past two days

258
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:41,779
A mongrel is better
off than my kids

259
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,542
At least it can feed
himself on the streets

260
00:32:45,943 --> 00:32:51,198
My kids starve

261
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:57,201
And you go after Pandurang

262
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,470
Is that how you go to heaven?

263
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,870
And if you do, what use is it?

264
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,710
You are so right

265
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:15,800
Avala, you have made me
see the light

266
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:26,000
Turning my back on my
kids will get me nowhere

267
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,304
Now you're talking like a man

268
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,798
My Mangalai, don't let
him change his mind

269
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:43,085
Avala, your practical philosophy
rises above all other

270
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:47,790
One must seek God
in this world

271
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:55,437
It is not the world that
one needs to deny

272
00:33:55,838 --> 00:34:01,799
But the desires ranging within
that have to be conquered

273
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,199
The family is man's
first loyalty

274
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,370
I don't understand all
these big words

275
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,770
Children too are God

276
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:17,090
Nobody gains anything
out of torturing them

277
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,778
Come, Avala

278
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,990
Dear Goddess Mangalai, you
have heard my prayer

279
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:42,037
Make money by honest dealings

280
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:49,043
Yet remain detached

281
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:59,900
This is the way to progress

282
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:08,120
Both in this world and other

283
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:19,059
Says Tuka, this is the truth
of the four stages of man

284
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:27,510
This is the essence
of all detachment

285
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,657
Kashi, when will Ma return?

286
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,244
In a little while

287
00:35:42,742 --> 00:35:45,918
You want some?

288
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,557
Let's rag him

289
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,260
Want some sugarcane?

290
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,580
Why are you beating him?
Rascals!

291
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,217
Don't cry. I'll give you
some. Are you hurt?

292
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,160
Go, choke on it

293
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,100
Mahadeo, don't cry. We'll Dad
to get us lots of sugarcane

294
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,157
What a hope!

295
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,720
You won't get even dry grass
that the buffaloes eat

296
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,568
Clear out, will you? Devils!

297
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,180
Father, we want sugarcane

298
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,670
All the village kids rag us

299
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,384
Yes, my children.
I'll get you some

300
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:41,070
Right now!

301
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,220
I will. I will, my child

302
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:10,457
It's coming, it's coming

303
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:14,117
Take this down

304
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:24,097
All sweetness lies
in the Name of Rama

305
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:33,858
Anger anger against
Hari is pain...

306
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,099
A lifetime of pain

307
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:55,058
Milk, rice and butter

308
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,420
What are you gaping at?
Note it down

309
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,319
Without inspiration
what does one do?

310
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,590
Take it down

311
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,739
Read on

312
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,036
Read on?

313
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,400
I mean, read what's before
your mind's eye

314
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,780
Milk, rice, butter and sweets

315
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:39,415
Don't satisfy the soul's
hunger

316
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:45,928
A lifetime of eating

317
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,945
Sour and sweet...

318
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:20,120
Sweet and sour, leads
to repentance

319
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,340
Says Tuka, the nectar of
Rama's Name

320
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,869
Kills desire for other tastes

321
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,900
What have you written?

322
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,250
Haven't you written 'Tuka says'?

323
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,860
No, only what I should...

324
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,270
What?

325
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,240
Salo says...

326
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,160
Inspiration lies in shreds

327
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,915
It's coming, it's coming

328
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,230
What?

329
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,810
Inspiration!

330
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,261
Take this down

331
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,537
Hymns to Ram...

332
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,860
Says Dholo

333
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,118
That's it

334
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:30,757
A chip off the old block

335
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,760
That's it

336
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,785
Father, there's Tuka

337
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:53,729
Back again

338
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,110
Where are you off to,
you hoax?

339
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:05,181
Looking for work

340
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:12,158
Sir, I'll be grateful if
you could give me some

341
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,576
Did you hear that, Dnyanoba?
Tukaram is looking for work!

342
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:27,717
He's the kind to cart salt to
the coast. Who'll give him work?

343
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,677
There's one work you're fit for

344
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:40,063
Don't you want to know what?

345
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,436
Begging

346
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,458
That keeps the family well

347
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:49,736
Sell what remains. Get rich

348
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,730
And...

349
00:41:55,098 --> 00:42:00,758
Feel free to use God's
Name for begging

350
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,117
Wait, let me be the
first to do charity

351
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:08,717
Begging? No

352
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:15,518
Never take the begging bowl

353
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,040
It is a shameful life

354
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:25,057
Such a man is forsaken...

355
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:29,359
...forsaken forever by God

356
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,065
Tuka, I'll give you some work

357
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,067
It won't interfere with
your devotion

358
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:36,957
I'd be truly grateful

359
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:39,022
I'm going to Alandi

360
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,498
Look after my farm

361
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:44,021
And I'll take care of you

362
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:48,238
Dnyanoba, you're being
generous at my expense

363
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,617
Once he starts singing

364
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:57,059
He won't notice if cattle
trample the field

365
00:42:57,307 --> 00:43:02,602
But remember, I'll not let
go of my share

366
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,389
Don't worry. You'll get your
share. Come, Tuka

367
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:19,525
This is my field

368
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,077
Look after it well

369
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:24,559
Fine. You may go now

370
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,961
Pandurang will bless you

371
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:29,980
I'll be back soon

372
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:58,127
May Your image always stay
before my eyes

373
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:05,539
Oh! the husband of Rakhumai

374
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:26,551
Sweet is Thy face,
Sweet is Thy name

375
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,862
Fills me with love at all times

376
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:53,505
My Pandurang grant me
this boon...

377
00:44:53,926 --> 00:45:05,142
That You'll remain in my heart

378
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:16,879
Says Tuka, I ask for
nothing else

379
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:30,479
All joy lies at Your feet

380
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:21,178
People have gone
crazy over him

381
00:47:21,778 --> 00:47:27,617
When he starts singing
they gather around him

382
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,897
What fools! Even at the fields!

383
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,139
Either have him leave the village
or confine him to the hills

384
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:38,683
People follow him everywhere

385
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:50,800
Tuka, you've looked after
my field well

386
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,965
Come down

387
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:21,237
Take this for today's work

388
00:48:21,637 --> 00:48:26,217
Don't give me grain

389
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:29,476
Give me some sugarcane
for children

390
00:48:29,778 --> 00:48:32,197
Certainly. Take the
grain as well

391
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,599
But do come tomorrow

392
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:47,537
Always think of right and wrong

393
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:55,999
And chant God's Name

394
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,219
Give me some, please

395
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,319
Take it, child

396
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:14,021
Take it, child

397
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:24,264
Thinking of God sees
you through...

398
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:32,546
...the worst troubles of life

399
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:36,558
Give me some as well

400
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:49,544
Remember and chant God's Name

401
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:57,002
Do so day and night

402
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:06,117
Says Tuka, many have
found salvation

403
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:14,877
Through singing God's Name

404
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:28,040
Kashi, sugarcane!

405
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:41,917
Goddess Mangalai,
how kind you are

406
00:50:45,137 --> 00:50:49,419
What a mess you're making

407
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,063
Only the sugarcane is
causing the mess here?

408
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:59,477
I get the hint

409
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:03,978
Just see how I clean up
the house tomorrow

410
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:14,024
Dnyanoba must learn not to
hobnob with the wrong typers

411
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:19,540
He gave Tuka work to spite me

412
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:27,982
Find such cattle as will
raze the field in one go

413
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:32,897
Don't worry about that, master.

414
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,361
Dnyanoba has been a thorn
in our side too

415
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:39,358
We'll teach him a lesson

416
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:42,338
Let's see what Tuka can do

417
00:51:42,817 --> 00:51:47,658
By the grace of Mangalai,
he is working at last

418
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:50,857
No more obligations now

419
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:55,997
Hurry up, children

420
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:04,357
The house must look like
a mirror before he returns

421
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,919
He won't know it's his house.

422
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,596
It began with a seed

423
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:51,237
The seed sprouted.
And the plant grew

424
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:12,121
In the womb of the seed
are a million trees

425
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:20,898
And flowers and fruits

426
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,900
You pervade the world
in Your many forms

427
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:57,204
But your essential form is Brahma
(But You are the Supreme Absolute Truth)

428
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:14,864
Open your eyes,
look around

429
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:17,150
What are you sitting here for?

430
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,250
Why are you so angry,
Dnyanoba?

431
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:24,490
With half the field eaten up?

432
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:35,710
There has not been such
a crop in years

433
00:55:36,111 --> 00:55:39,697
Hadn't I warned you, Dnyanoba?

434
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:43,999
Now look what's happened

435
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:48,908
But I'm not letting
go of my share

436
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,428
You think I'll spare him?

437
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:53,977
I'm not a simpleton

438
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:56,837
What can you take from him?

439
00:55:57,238 --> 00:56:01,737
All his possessions together
won't buy a meal

440
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,682
But he has a house

441
00:56:04,082 --> 00:56:07,479
I'll get the village chief to
draw up a mortgage deed

442
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:16,625
Like a sky without clouds

443
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:34,077
Clean as the river Ganga

444
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:49,220
I have made my house,
my house!

445
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,957
Tuka, whether the house stays
with you or not...

446
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:02,942
...depends upon your destiny

447
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:06,996
If the field is as
good as every year

448
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:10,639
...then the house
stays with you

449
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:14,577
Otherwise you must sell
it to compensate

450
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,600
That's what the deed says

451
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,886
Isn't that so?

452
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:21,506
You accept this?

453
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,880
I accept. It is my fault.

454
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,838
Then sign here

455
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:35,419
Come, Salomalo, come

456
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,038
You've come at the
right moment

457
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:39,860
We want a witness

458
00:57:56,203 --> 00:58:01,108
Tuka, you decided to work

459
00:58:01,408 --> 00:58:03,937
You lost your home
and hearth

460
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:09,417
The only home for you now
is under some tree

461
00:58:15,897 --> 00:58:18,820
Father is here

462
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,867
Mahadeo, Kashi, you're
not to say a word

463
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:28,419
Seeing the house he will say,
'What a fine woman you are'

464
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:30,819
'How clean the house looks'

465
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,838
Hush, hide here

466
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:44,761
Has he brought any grain?

467
00:58:56,143 --> 00:58:59,022
Didn't Dnyanoba give
any grain?

468
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:03,062
Maybe he'll give it
all together

469
00:59:03,642 --> 00:59:09,039
But have you seen our house?
Isn't it shining?

470
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,077
Our house?

471
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:18,677
It looks like someone else's?

472
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,417
It belongs to Panduranga now

473
00:59:27,718 --> 00:59:32,078
He who gave it is
taking it away

474
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,357
I don't understand

475
00:59:36,479 --> 00:59:41,350
When I was minding the field
some cattle ruined the crop

476
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:45,378
I've signed away the house
in compensation

477
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,858
I must pay for my mistake

478
00:59:50,459 --> 00:59:54,036
The only shelter the children
had a right to

479
00:59:54,436 --> 00:59:57,961
What do we do now?

480
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,980
His will prevails

481
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,977
He will take care of them

482
01:00:04,378 --> 01:00:06,520
Everything is His will

483
01:01:05,697 --> 01:01:08,203
What's this?

484
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:18,272
Look what a huge heap it is!

485
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:21,137
Get the measures

486
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:59,759
The heap remains the same
whatever you take from it!

487
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:07,319
How many measures?

488
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:11,781
Ten times the usual crop
and still some left

489
01:02:12,243 --> 01:02:16,142
Have you measured
correctly?

490
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:20,142
See for yourself

491
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:24,822
You're very lucky

492
01:02:25,817 --> 01:02:31,519
Mother Earth has blessed you
with a tenfold yield

493
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:37,979
Why are you silent now?

494
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:42,220
I've been unjust

495
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:47,497
Cattle destroyed the crop
but I abused Tuka

496
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:50,138
I made him mortgage
his house

497
01:02:50,438 --> 01:02:55,076
I've sinned against God

498
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:03,917
I'll keep only my
usual share

499
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:07,837
The rest belongs to Tuka.
I'll send it to him

500
01:03:08,237 --> 01:03:10,597
Look, the field's mine

501
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,498
You're only the tenant

502
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:18,096
Who are you to give away
grain to that loafer?

503
01:03:18,368 --> 01:03:21,084
You'll get the share
that is yours

504
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,410
I can do what I like
with the rest

505
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,721
Let's load the grain and go.

506
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,397
You're talking very big

507
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,056
Let me see you take even
a grain to Tuka's house

508
01:03:34,997 --> 01:03:39,083
You don't own the world,
do you?

509
01:03:39,618 --> 01:03:42,496
You have a right only
on your share

510
01:03:42,996 --> 01:03:47,996
Had you spared Tuka we would
have granted you more

511
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,310
Seems as if those who let loose
the cattle did Tuka a favor

512
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,050
Implying that we let the
cattle loose?

513
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,750
I'll show you

514
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,900
Dnyanoba? Have you come
to throw us out?

515
01:04:26,236 --> 01:04:31,000
Tuka's piety has brought
me a bumper crop

516
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,019
Here it is

517
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,030
All this is ours!

518
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,430
Yes

519
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,890
Really?

520
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,550
Dear, dear Mangalai

521
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:50,577
Kashi, Mahadeo, come.
Unload the grain

522
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,604
See, so many carts

523
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,638
Patil, see how much grain
they have brought for Tukaram

524
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,350
What? For Tukaram?

525
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,180
Kashi, give me a
grain-basket

526
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,216
I'll grind it into flour

527
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:25,380
There is no flour
in the house

528
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:38,550
Father, see how many carts
they have brought

529
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,350
What's this, Dnyanoba?

530
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,509
I've sinned against you.
Forgive me

531
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,550
All the grain that I've got
through your piety is yours

532
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,820
That cannot be

533
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,260
What grows in your
field is yours

534
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,300
Please take it back

535
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,400
I can't do that

536
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:18,500
Then give it away to
hungry beggars

537
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:22,500
Please don't keep it here.
It is not mine

538
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,900
It is yours. I've no right
to give it away

539
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:38,430
The cock crows

540
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:45,779
The world wakes up

541
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:58,802
My destiny...

542
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,419
...has suddenly
grown bright

543
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:16,709
Give food freely
to the hungry

544
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:21,185
But when giving alms
consider its worth...

545
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,359
...when the need arises

546
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,727
This is true religion

547
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:36,660
Else give to those beings

548
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:41,423
Who are worthy
recipients

549
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,317
God's name...

550
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:52,088
...is sacred food

551
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:55,296
Take freely of it...

552
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:58,638
and you will be immortal

553
01:08:17,196 --> 01:08:25,097
Speak Vitthala
See Vitthala

554
01:08:25,497 --> 01:08:33,238
Act Vitthala
with all your heart

555
01:08:55,296 --> 01:08:59,190
Scoundrels! Clear out!

556
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,222
Grown fat like pigs
on unearned food

557
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,418
Think this is your
father's granary?

558
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:12,836
You come back and I'll
break your legs

559
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,830
No other house for begging?

560
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:38,957
Now neither he nor you
can have it

561
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,590
Cry your eyes out for them

562
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:44,500
Give away all the
grain and flour!

563
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:48,616
What will the kids eat?
Your bones or mine?

564
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:53,066
She rages like the furies,
won't let go

565
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,450
Like the furies, am I?

566
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,191
Naturally, since I'm there
to stuff your gorge

567
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:00,541
Don't be so proud

568
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:03,818
Don't be so greedy

569
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:11,196
Avala, Pandurang gives to
each according to his merit

570
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,049
Pandurang does this,
He does that!

571
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,422
And I'm greedy, am I?

572
01:10:16,722 --> 01:10:20,885
Mother Mangalai, for what sins
did you bind me to this fool?

573
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:24,081
If you're so well off I don't
want any part of it

574
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,959
You, your merit, your Blackface
and your kids. Do what you like

575
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,537
I'm not staying here
a moment longer

576
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,003
She'll never leave you

577
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:40,156
She's annoyed with me.
She'll be back soon

578
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,470
Patil stopped me otherwise
I'd have taught Tuka a lesson

579
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:13,979
Have you gone mad?

580
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,056
What else? We had a good crop
because the rains were good

581
01:11:19,456 --> 01:11:22,416
And Tuka gets the credit

582
01:11:22,641 --> 01:11:25,983
He pretends to be detached
and he's hailed as a saint

583
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:33,018
He gives alms to few and
he becomes a philanthropist

584
01:11:33,446 --> 01:11:39,297
These rumours spread
like a forest-fire

585
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:43,276
People are such fools

586
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:47,000
Not one of them can
see through him

587
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,750
It's really too much

588
01:11:49,257 --> 01:11:52,097
You men are all like that

589
01:11:52,397 --> 01:11:55,038
And you women?

590
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,696
You're the bait for
such pretenders

591
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:02,866
Is that so? Shall I show
you how smart we are?

592
01:12:03,329 --> 01:12:06,650
Shell I show him up?

593
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:12,697
Even the sage Vishvamitra went
wagging his tail to a woman

594
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:15,879
Tuka, after all, is a nobody

595
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,124
Don't make empty boasts

596
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,248
It's no boast.
It's a challenge

597
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:29,950
You want to see how your
Tuka falls for me?

598
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,470
Sit here beside me

599
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:52,586
You are beautiful

600
01:12:55,297 --> 01:12:59,256
Your face like the Moon

601
01:12:59,456 --> 01:13:05,342
Your skin like cream

602
01:13:06,356 --> 01:13:13,220
To see this face

603
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,296
Is to lose my sense

604
01:13:35,266 --> 01:13:42,280
A dog? Why Vishvamitra will
be a rag under your feet

605
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:47,521
Mind, Tuka is a cunning man

606
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,216
It's the cunning ones who
fall into our traps

607
01:14:01,497 --> 01:14:13,638
All my desires have vanished
without a trace

608
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:26,187
Brahma runs through my veins

609
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:34,277
I cannot control my own tongue

610
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:49,720
I cannot stop chanting
His Name

611
01:14:55,236 --> 01:15:03,000
Tuka says...
As river becomes ocean

612
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:27,538
My spirit has merged
with His Name

613
01:16:03,116 --> 01:16:11,396
I think day and night
of the Lord Krishna

614
01:16:12,096 --> 01:16:20,277
My heart can't bear
this separation

615
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:46,510
Radha has yielded utterly
to His charms

616
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:55,236
Why do You torture her so,
O Lord

617
01:16:55,637 --> 01:17:03,787
Let Her hear the sweet
sound of Your flute

618
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:15,480
Make Her worthy of
Your love

619
01:18:10,904 --> 01:18:14,436
How beautiful! Who would
not be entranced

620
01:18:14,936 --> 01:18:20,230
Such a sweet voice issuing
from this lovely throat

621
01:18:20,231 --> 01:18:26,277
You seem to like my singing.
Do you like me?

622
01:18:26,777 --> 01:18:30,822
You are beautiful

623
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,450
Yours is such a pure beauty.
It would charm anybody

624
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,459
Do you really like
me so much?

625
01:18:43,808 --> 01:18:49,037
How fascinating these
castanets are

626
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,100
Why move away?

627
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,859
Don't you like me?

628
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:59,358
How can that be?

629
01:18:59,737 --> 01:19:02,737
Panduranga Himself
would sway...

630
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:08,404
...to the sound of your voice
that reaches to heaven (Vaikuntha)

631
01:19:08,836 --> 01:19:11,517
I am charmed

632
01:19:12,018 --> 01:19:16,478
You are like the goddess
Rakhumai Herself

633
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:19,656
I bow to you in obeisance

634
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:21,790
Lord, what can I do
with this fool

635
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:25,399
People will stone you if
you fall at her feet

636
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,838
How dare you come here,
you whore?

637
01:19:29,176 --> 01:19:31,947
Is she really a whore?

638
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,420
Then it is very good

639
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,680
Yes, very good indeed!

640
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,347
Are you drunk or something?

641
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:42,298
Do you want to be thrown
out ceremoniously

642
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,682
Don't you dare step in
here again. Get out

643
01:19:45,883 --> 01:19:48,321
You mustn't ill-treat
people like that

644
01:19:56,576 --> 01:19:58,700
You've made a mistake, lady

645
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,677
We devotees of Vishnu never
get involved in such things

646
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:09,098
But I'm deeply sorry to
see you fall so low

647
01:20:09,617 --> 01:20:14,137
Your youth and beauty will
last only a short time

648
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,000
Don't burn it up for
a moment's pleasure

649
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:29,149
If you spent your life singing
in praise of God...

650
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:33,256
...you would gain much

651
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,539
We help ourselves,
we ruin ourselves

652
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:40,596
Only we can save ourselves

653
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,500
May Pandurang give you
good sense. Farewell, lady

654
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,958
Forgive me, sir

655
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:50,677
I come to you because
I was challenged

656
01:20:50,977 --> 01:20:53,223
But your words have
changed my heart

657
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,790
I'll never leave your feet now

658
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,656
Then I'll have to sweep
you out with a broom

659
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:02,618
You have abandoned decency.
We haven't

660
01:21:02,936 --> 01:21:06,517
Do what you like. Beat me.
But I won't go away

661
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,696
Marvelous!

662
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:10,957
Yes, it is marvelous

663
01:21:11,558 --> 01:21:13,956
You are fortunate to have
a husband like this

664
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:15,600
Then why don't you marry him?

665
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,416
And find out what it's
like to be fortunate!

666
01:21:19,937 --> 01:21:23,222
What are you waiting for?
She's come your way. Marry her

667
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,477
You're like a mother to me

668
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,836
You can treat me
like a servant

669
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,900
I'll do any work for you

670
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,957
But I won't go away
from these feet

671
01:21:33,257 --> 01:21:37,159
You'd better, this minute

672
01:21:53,297 --> 01:21:58,477
You uplift the fallen ones

673
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:04,111
Let me also enjoy Your grace

674
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:18,037
I must get the highest religious
authority to teach Tuka a lesson

675
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:24,897
Tuka says he is a saint

676
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:32,079
Who bears the world's assaults

677
01:22:42,747 --> 01:22:50,316
Tuka says, full of grace
is your countenance

678
01:22:55,076 --> 01:22:59,960
When the Lord is in your
heart and soul

679
01:23:00,578 --> 01:23:07,437
Tuka says, each man
has his work

680
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:14,440
None other can do it

681
01:23:19,116 --> 01:23:23,076
He who says in Brahma

682
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:28,437
Knows not the
essence of devotion

683
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,336
Says Tuka, not for a moment

684
01:23:33,837 --> 01:23:40,037
Do I wish to see such a man

685
01:24:17,456 --> 01:24:21,758
I welcome the learned scholar,
Rameshvar Shastri

686
01:24:22,259 --> 01:24:24,671
On behalf of Dehu village

687
01:24:37,099 --> 01:24:42,302
Tuka seems to have the
village in his grip

688
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:47,896
As I came, I heard everybody
singing his songs

689
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:51,222
I had informed you of this

690
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:58,901
What's the use? I blame you for
letting things get out of hand

691
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:01,316
Blame me?

692
01:25:02,117 --> 01:25:04,922
You and all Brahmins of Dehu

693
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:07,278
Allowing him to carry
on with his tricks

694
01:25:07,778 --> 01:25:12,916
An example of the gullibility
of the common man

695
01:25:14,817 --> 01:25:21,350
I have one request to make
to this illustrious scholar

696
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:28,616
Punishment be given with
due consideration

697
01:25:29,117 --> 01:25:34,848
Gold never mixed with lead

698
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:39,797
Says Salo, o lord of religion.
Whose fault is it, show us

699
01:25:40,398 --> 01:25:44,226
That is very good, Salomalo,
you have an eloquent tongue

700
01:25:44,526 --> 01:25:49,000
His tongue? Yes, it's flowery

701
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:54,861
I didn't know you were such
an excellent poet

702
01:25:55,261 --> 01:26:00,217
It fills me with gratitude to
hear your praise

703
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:04,177
Since you have brought up the
subject, let me tell you

704
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:08,756
Tuka picks up my compositions,
juggles the words around

705
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,418
And sings them down the
village streets as his own

706
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:20,217
No wonder there is such feeling
for words in his songs

707
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:23,630
I was listening as I came

708
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:26,776
I was really struck by
the chaste language

709
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,430
The impeccable construction
and the grace of his songs

710
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:38,830
But in his compositions he turns
the Vedas upside down

711
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:43,157
This is a blunt insult to
our scriptures

712
01:26:43,487 --> 01:26:49,159
Yet the stupid people praise him

713
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:53,117
It is the Dehu Brahmins
who have spoilt him

714
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:57,796
They call him a saint and
prostrate themselves before him

715
01:26:58,196 --> 01:27:01,716
Do they do that?

716
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:05,704
And the lowcaste allows it?

717
01:27:08,136 --> 01:27:12,485
Wonderful! So the rot
has really set in

718
01:27:13,757 --> 01:27:18,859
I have thought of
the best solution

719
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:26,682
Drive him out of Dehu

720
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:31,656
He's done nothing to
deserve that

721
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,727
Dehu is proud to have him

722
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:39,057
Don't meddle in
religious matters

723
01:27:39,277 --> 01:27:45,077
Tell Tukaram that Rameshvar
Shastri has come to judge him

724
01:27:45,277 --> 01:27:48,677
Ask him to come
here immediately

725
01:27:49,617 --> 01:27:51,617
Don't come near

726
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,943
I will not have blasphemous
people like you near me

727
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,078
Blasphemous? I?

728
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,877
Yes, and you've made the
people blaspheme

729
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:09,266
Have I?

730
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:17,600
If that is true I will take
any punishment

731
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,339
Lord, I think you're mistaken

732
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:26,601
Mistaken? In order to promote
the philosophy of devotion

733
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,957
You have belittled Vedic ritual

734
01:28:30,357 --> 01:28:33,003
Aren't you ashamed of
talking this way

735
01:28:33,204 --> 01:28:38,537
You have made a cult out of the
chanting of God's Name. Sinner!

736
01:28:43,021 --> 01:28:47,956
But there are two
ways to reach God

737
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,541
One is rocky, the other smooth

738
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:57,717
Yoga will take you to God

739
01:28:58,217 --> 01:29:02,705
Ritual will reveal Him to you

740
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:08,360
But this is not an easy
path for everyone

741
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:14,390
The common man reaches God
through devotion (bhakti marga)

742
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:28,785
Anyone may tread this path, man,
woman, the worthy or unworthy

743
01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:36,817
To take God's Name (nama sankirtana)
is an easy way

744
01:29:37,718 --> 01:29:44,257
It burns up the sins
of all your births

745
01:29:44,485 --> 01:29:51,915
There is no need to seek
the Lord in the forests

746
01:29:52,515 --> 01:30:02,359
He comes willingly to you

747
01:30:05,277 --> 01:30:08,835
That is all that the
Bhagavat cult teaches

748
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:11,510
But when your Bhagavat
cult begins...

749
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:15,201
...to trample all over the
Vedas, then what?

750
01:30:15,701 --> 01:30:18,200
That doesn't happen,
my lord

751
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:24,422
That Bhagavat cult is only an
extension of the Vedic religion

752
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:31,181
All religion teach us that
God is omnipresent

753
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:36,390
The God Omkar that you describe
as formless and without desire

754
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,717
Is the same as Panduranga to whom
we attribute form and desire

755
01:30:42,595 --> 01:30:44,239
The teachings of the
Vedas are many

756
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,710
But the essence of
them all is one

757
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,070
That you must surrender
yourself to God

758
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:52,816
But be faithful to one's self.
And chant His Name.

759
01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:54,797
The teaching of
all philosophies

760
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:57,000
Yields but one meaning

761
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,110
The scriptures are many

762
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,796
But the essence is one

763
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,436
That is the goal, says Tuka

764
01:31:02,992 --> 01:31:07,285
It is such thoughts that go
against Vedic teachings

765
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,142
Your argument is totally false

766
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,193
I wish to hear no more

767
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:20,398
As a low-caste you've sinned
in misinterpreting the Vedas

768
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:26,725
So I forbid you to
compose any more songs

769
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:30,784
And to preach to people

770
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:36,720
It was Panduranga who spoke
through me in this manner

771
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,660
But you're the authority

772
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,621
You too are like God to me

773
01:31:45,576 --> 01:31:48,708
I will not compose songs
from now on

774
01:31:49,476 --> 01:31:52,296
And the ones composed already?

775
01:31:52,697 --> 01:31:56,337
Destroy them. Drown them
in the river Indrayani

776
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:04,257
I accept your order

777
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:08,025
Don't just accept.
Act on it, now!

778
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:13,720
The sinful hands that wrote
those songs must drown them

779
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,217
That's your punishment

780
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:20,636
Wait. I'll fetch your
songs for you

781
01:32:23,957 --> 01:32:28,240
You brats. Get your father's
song books out

782
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:32,236
Get your father to
fetch them, longface

783
01:32:32,736 --> 01:32:34,917
Who do you think
you're talking to?

784
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,220
I'll slap your face now

785
01:32:38,716 --> 01:32:41,126
Why are you shouting,
Mahadeo?

786
01:32:41,528 --> 01:32:46,699
He abused my father.
So I abused him

787
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,599
Well done, Mahadeo,
that's my son

788
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,578
Why have you come here?

789
01:32:51,878 --> 01:32:54,560
Think we are timid
lambs like this?

790
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,630
What are you doing here?

791
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,629
Rameshvar Shastri has ordered
Tuka to drown his song books

792
01:33:02,129 --> 01:33:04,120
I've come to take them

793
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,597
You think you dare do that?

794
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,851
Rameshvar Shastri orders it

795
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,277
Give whoever he is
a basket of dung to eat!

796
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:17,537
Why is he spouting hot air?
Get out of here now

797
01:33:17,956 --> 01:33:20,598
Don't talk to him like that,
Avala

798
01:33:20,798 --> 01:33:22,596
So I'm at fault again

799
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:25,561
He's asked for your songs to
drown them in the river

800
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:28,798
Do you want me to
give them to him?

801
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:31,202
Rameshvar Shastri's orders

802
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,246
We must obey

803
01:33:34,646 --> 01:33:38,947
I'll back, Salomalo

804
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:54,576
Now what's come over you?
Have you gone mad?

805
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:57,537
You neglected and
starved your kids

806
01:33:57,937 --> 01:33:59,957
Stayed up night after night
composing these

807
01:34:00,457 --> 01:34:01,978
And now you want
to drown them

808
01:34:02,478 --> 01:34:04,104
Why did you take the trouble?

809
01:34:04,604 --> 01:34:07,038
What do I do with this fool?

810
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,799
Title deeds drowned, family ruined.
Now songs drowned to ruin himself

811
01:35:23,824 --> 01:35:31,836
Panduranga, is it of any use
shouting Your Name?

812
01:35:35,758 --> 01:35:41,036
You have plunged Your
devotees in despair

813
01:35:41,037 --> 01:35:48,826
I ruined my home for You

814
01:35:49,527 --> 01:35:54,157
Chanted Your Name
day and night

815
01:35:54,557 --> 01:35:59,521
Put my family through
endless suffering

816
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:04,309
And this is what You give me!

817
01:36:06,466 --> 01:36:09,739
So be it

818
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,336
You are omnipotent

819
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:21,359
You don't like the way
I sing Your praises

820
01:36:21,959 --> 01:36:26,937
I'm no good for
anything else

821
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:33,903
Then how can I express
my devotion?

822
01:36:34,603 --> 01:36:37,917
You must decide

823
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:48,297
I place at Your feet the words
of my ardent devotion

824
01:37:22,617 --> 01:37:29,177
Panduranga, I will also prepare to go

825
01:37:31,616 --> 01:37:36,876
Let me escape from my body
here in Your presence

826
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:46,890
SECOND DAY

827
01:37:52,957 --> 01:37:55,701
The kids are starving
since yesterday

828
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:58,778
We won't eat unless you eat

829
01:37:59,176 --> 01:38:05,819
Have this, Mahadeo and Kashi

830
01:38:06,197 --> 01:38:11,997
Father, please have this

831
01:38:23,557 --> 01:38:28,127
We won't eat unless he eats

832
01:38:29,823 --> 01:38:34,063
We won't move from
here unless you eat

833
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:37,759
3RD DAY

834
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,119
4TH DAY

835
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,559
5TH DAY

836
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:03,359
12TH DAY

837
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,758
13TH DAY

838
01:39:20,502 --> 01:39:25,630
Look! Look at that

839
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,158
Tukaram has to be called back

840
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:17,457
My body is on fire. I want
to jump in the river

841
01:40:46,461 --> 01:40:50,836
What's come over you, Shastri?
You're an erudite Brahmin

842
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:55,041
How can you prostrate yourself
before this lowly man?

843
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:06,455
You need to be worthy to
understand the worth of Tukaram

844
01:41:07,056 --> 01:41:09,956
You will never understand it

845
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:13,999
Do you mean I am unworthy?

846
01:41:14,389 --> 01:41:17,037
Wait till I show
you my worth

847
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,257
Forgive me, lord!

848
01:41:24,657 --> 01:41:27,357
I have learnt a
hard lesson

849
01:41:28,036 --> 01:41:31,397
After shame and suffering

850
01:41:31,621 --> 01:41:39,497
To us Tuka is greatness incarnate.
A form of God Himself

851
01:43:16,827 --> 01:43:20,600
What should I do now?

852
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:31,561
They are all fools.
Even Rameshvar Shastri

853
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:38,276
What are you writing?

854
01:43:38,776 --> 01:43:41,936
Gems of poetic expression

855
01:43:42,437 --> 01:43:45,761
Salo says, idiots, asses...

856
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:49,757
It's decided I must go.
I will meet King Shivaji

857
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:53,727
Religion must be saved

858
01:43:54,037 --> 01:43:57,702
I'll teach Tuka and
that Rameshvar!

859
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,087
Don't gape.
Get my things ready

860
01:44:08,441 --> 01:44:13,318
Yes. What have I been
shouting about?

861
01:44:35,558 --> 01:44:39,102
Anybody home, little ones?

862
01:44:39,402 --> 01:44:43,736
Yes. Me and Mahadeo

863
01:44:44,536 --> 01:44:46,908
I mean your father, Tukaram?

864
01:44:47,308 --> 01:44:49,786
He's gone out

865
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,799
And your mother?

866
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:54,180
She is very much alive

867
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,357
What do you want?

868
01:44:57,757 --> 01:45:01,157
We have traveled a long
way to meet Tukaram

869
01:45:01,657 --> 01:45:05,537
Have you lost your senses?
You look like a rich man

870
01:45:06,338 --> 01:45:09,496
Listen. Forget that fool

871
01:45:09,796 --> 01:45:13,121
Or you'll be ruined like me

872
01:45:13,378 --> 01:45:15,257
Go now, before he gets back

873
01:45:16,057 --> 01:45:18,837
We carry gifts from Shivaji

874
01:45:19,137 --> 01:45:20,125
Gifts?

875
01:45:20,325 --> 01:45:22,438
Come on

876
01:45:27,222 --> 01:45:30,060
All this is for you

877
01:45:33,297 --> 01:45:37,929
You mean all this is ours?

878
01:45:41,179 --> 01:45:45,379
Kashi, Mahadeo? Come quickly

879
01:45:45,638 --> 01:45:49,957
Are you blind? They've been
standing so long

880
01:45:50,257 --> 01:45:52,301
Give them a rag to sit on

881
01:45:52,901 --> 01:45:56,157
Mahadeo, Kashi, get some
jaggery and water

882
01:45:57,038 --> 01:45:58,710
Jaggery? We have none

883
01:46:00,356 --> 01:46:02,238
Oh yes, it's just finished

884
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:05,038
Kashi, run and fetch father

885
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:10,506
- Mahadeo, go and call him.
- Why don't you go?

886
01:46:54,893 --> 01:46:58,599
How pretty my children look

887
01:46:58,899 --> 01:47:02,287
Anybody might envy me

888
01:47:02,687 --> 01:47:04,439
You look lovely too, Ma

889
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,856
Your face looks like the
Goddess Satwai's

890
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:10,797
Really?

891
01:47:14,022 --> 01:47:16,757
Hush! Keep quiet

892
01:47:25,137 --> 01:47:27,757
Where are you from?

893
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,743
We bear gifts from Shivaji

894
01:47:32,086 --> 01:47:32,999
Gifts?

895
01:47:54,457 --> 01:47:57,966
Father, there's a robe for you

896
01:49:06,756 --> 01:49:09,182
How lovely you look now

897
01:49:09,482 --> 01:49:11,941
As lovely as a pamper!

898
01:49:14,657 --> 01:49:18,426
But that is poison, Avala

899
01:49:18,726 --> 01:49:22,621
We don't mind poison.
We can happily digest it

900
01:49:23,498 --> 01:49:27,217
You might.
But I wouldn't let you

901
01:49:27,741 --> 01:49:30,996
I wouldn't like my dear ones
to perish with this poison

902
01:49:31,296 --> 01:49:34,124
That's what you should do!

903
01:49:34,376 --> 01:49:36,396
You spurn this fortune?

904
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,076
What's in your mind?

905
01:49:39,677 --> 01:49:43,689
Don't laugh. My blood is boiling

906
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:47,856
For what sin did I deserve
this husband?

907
01:49:55,856 --> 01:49:59,000
Please take this
back to Shivaji

908
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,100
Tell him I bless him

909
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,526
But I'm not worthy of
such honour

910
01:50:05,927 --> 01:50:08,696
I've only one desire.
Devotion

911
01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:12,016
But King Shivaji is anxious
to see you

912
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,118
The palanquin is waiting
to take you

913
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:22,561
I wander in the sun. I'm dirty

914
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:27,904
I'm untouch. Why bring me
before that Prince?

915
01:50:28,356 --> 01:50:32,759
What will you gain or he?

916
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:38,457
A great king like Shivaji
invites you...

917
01:50:39,002 --> 01:50:41,687
How can you not go?

918
01:50:41,987 --> 01:50:48,790
To me the greatest king and the
smallest ant are equal

919
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:54,637
He's great, generous.
But I've nothing to ask of him

920
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:57,500
He has nothing to give me

921
01:50:58,636 --> 01:51:03,907
Why waste even a fraction of
this life going there?

922
01:51:04,202 --> 01:51:07,980
If he is anxious to give me
something then let him do this

923
01:51:08,481 --> 01:51:14,676
I would be happy if he would
chant the Name of Vitthala

924
01:51:14,977 --> 01:51:19,756
This immeasurable wealth
is like dirt to me

925
01:51:20,036 --> 01:51:24,477
Wear Basil (Tulasi) beads.
Fast once every fortnight (Ekadashi)

926
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:29,879
Call yourself the servant of God.
Says Tuka, this is my desire

927
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:41,239
Lord, I am your disciple and a
servant of God from today

928
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:44,580
You have shown me
what asceticism is (vairagya)

929
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:50,543
Revealed to me the
way to fulfillment

930
01:51:50,838 --> 01:51:56,064
You may return.
I'm not coming

931
01:51:56,365 --> 01:51:58,821
What will happen to
the kingdom?

932
01:51:59,121 --> 01:52:01,402
What do I tell the
Queen Mother?

933
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:04,757
You look after the kingdom

934
01:52:05,058 --> 01:52:10,168
Tell my mother that her son
has found the way to himself

935
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:15,379
Shivaji is now fighting
the enemy within

936
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,700
Not the one hiding
behind fortifications

937
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,515
You can't do that

938
01:52:21,915 --> 01:52:25,021
Not a word more. Go

939
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:32,996
Lord, please guide me
as your disciple

940
01:52:34,396 --> 01:52:38,417
Shivaji, you've traveled far.
Rest till the evening

941
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:40,350
I would like to talk to you

942
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:44,896
So, our king has also fallen?

943
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,380
You are responsible for this

944
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:51,578
Thief shouting 'thief'!

945
01:52:51,779 --> 01:52:54,097
Your king is a simpleton.
And you are weak

946
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:58,102
You have lost your king and
not done your duty

947
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:02,599
I had such ideas about our king

948
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,839
Fools like you foster fakes

949
01:53:07,397 --> 01:53:13,198
Now to protect Hinduism is to
appeal to the Muslim rulers

950
01:53:15,137 --> 01:53:21,156
Duty (Dharma) is knowledge
Duty is the way (sadhana)

951
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:29,396
Duty is the ultimate good

952
01:53:44,117 --> 01:53:48,396
Duty is prestige

953
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:02,356
Duty is the way to salvation

954
01:54:04,478 --> 01:54:09,977
Once this is known

955
01:54:14,616 --> 01:54:18,425
You find God in stone

956
01:54:31,216 --> 01:54:36,231
Every man must do his duty

957
01:54:37,776 --> 01:54:45,000
Therein lies salvation for him
(moksha, Paramatma, God)

958
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:49,677
You are a warrior caste, (kshatriya)
Shivaji

959
01:54:49,978 --> 01:54:58,388
Your duty is to protect your
kingdom and religion

960
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,790
If you fulfill this duty

961
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:07,136
You gain fame in this life and
salvation in the other

962
01:55:08,156 --> 01:55:13,341
But the warrior code spread
a net of temptation

963
01:55:14,641 --> 01:55:20,247
A man ensnared can only
escape by seeking God

964
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,420
That's not true, my king

965
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,602
It is not necessary to condemn

966
01:55:27,002 --> 01:55:31,036
It is not necessary to forsake

967
01:55:31,576 --> 01:55:35,289
And do so in search of God

968
01:55:35,699 --> 01:55:43,579
The way to God is simple
whether king or commoner

969
01:55:51,868 --> 01:55:59,668
Take God's Name
every moment

970
01:55:59,968 --> 01:56:07,456
Become detached
from the world

971
01:56:08,176 --> 01:56:16,312
With such accumulation
of merit

972
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:24,416
You may embrace
the Lord's feet

973
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:32,836
There is no other way but
to chant His Name

974
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:39,778
Whatever else you may do

975
01:56:40,376 --> 01:56:47,356
Says Tuka, calling out to you

976
01:56:52,142 --> 01:57:00,780
Never give up
chanting His Name

977
01:57:13,974 --> 01:57:20,141
How true. I understand

978
01:57:25,386 --> 01:57:29,916
I was about to make a grave
mistake through ignorance

979
01:57:30,516 --> 01:57:34,476
But your counsel has set me
on the right path

980
01:57:46,916 --> 01:57:49,784
My king, taking the chance
to catch you unaware...

981
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:53,276
...the chieftain of Chakan is
coming with his army

982
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,960
Panduranga, the enemy is
going to attack...

983
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:01,580
While Your devotee is
engaged in prayer

984
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:07,062
I cannot bear this holocaust

985
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:09,536
The sufferings of people pain me

986
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,999
It's as if You don't exist

987
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:13,297
I see what I shouldn't

988
01:58:13,697 --> 01:58:16,436
The enemy attacks
a servant of God

989
01:58:17,082 --> 01:58:19,462
I have never seen
such a sight

990
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,397
Tuka says, You put my
devotion to shame

991
01:58:24,697 --> 01:58:28,658
My life has become
totally worthless

992
01:58:31,003 --> 01:58:34,296
We are surrounded.
Please think

993
01:58:34,663 --> 01:58:39,300
You become the Lion-man (Narasimha) for
Your devotee Prahlada

994
01:58:40,136 --> 01:58:43,076
You made his word come true

995
01:58:43,377 --> 01:58:45,446
Your Names! Rama, Krishna,
Govinda, Narayana, Hari...

996
01:58:46,289 --> 01:58:48,516
Were chanted by him
in the King's court

997
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:52,957
All these Names like
Vitthala, Madhava, Mukunda, Keshava

998
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:54,080
Scared the King of the Ungodly

999
01:58:54,336 --> 01:58:57,236
Where are You hiding in
our hour of need?

1000
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,857
If You forsake Your devotees
who will protect them?

1001
01:59:01,716 --> 01:59:05,536
Even if God turns His back on
us we will not leave Him

1002
01:59:05,736 --> 01:59:08,636
Let this head break,
body crack open

1003
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:11,290
But the chanting of His
Name will not end

1004
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,750
Let this perishable
body split in two

1005
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:18,196
But the song of devotion
must go on

1006
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,870
Vitthal...

1007
02:00:54,807 --> 02:00:58,060
Shivaji, Panduranga has
been true to us

1008
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:00,721
He has saved our honour

1009
02:01:03,556 --> 02:01:10,719
How much should I praise You.
Savior of the gentle and the weak

1010
02:01:31,236 --> 02:01:34,556
You saved us.
You were true to us

1011
02:01:36,902 --> 02:01:40,836
A glimpse of Krishna

1012
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:42,900
Is like a nectar

1013
02:01:45,856 --> 02:01:48,518
In Your dusken hue is
absorbed the cosmos

1014
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:37,835
February 16, 1652. Saint Tukaram
leaves for his heavenly home

1015
02:02:43,787 --> 02:02:47,636
Devotion is Vitthala.
Knowledge is Vitthala

1016
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:55,271
I'm now in state when I am
neither yours nor mine

1017
02:02:55,671 --> 02:03:01,501
I am Vitthala.
I go to my heavenly home (Vaikuntha)

1018
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:06,596
You've said so a hundred times

1019
02:03:06,957 --> 02:03:09,896
Why talk such nonsense?

1020
02:03:10,576 --> 02:03:14,136
Avali, I'm telling the truth

1021
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,065
You must come with me

1022
02:03:18,166 --> 02:03:20,920
Forget home, children, cattle

1023
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,820
Fine things you're teaching me

1024
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:26,280
If I started dancing with you,
our home would be lost

1025
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,470
I'm not coming

1026
02:03:28,259 --> 02:03:31,516
Avala, you have stood by me
all through this worldly life

1027
02:03:31,816 --> 02:03:34,269
Don't leave me now

1028
02:03:34,683 --> 02:03:38,942
You have supported
my every step

1029
02:03:40,122 --> 02:03:43,897
You protected me from toil...

1030
02:03:44,297 --> 02:03:46,998
...and the problems of
home and family

1031
02:03:47,326 --> 02:03:51,024
Leaving me free for devotion

1032
02:03:51,924 --> 02:03:58,636
If you hadn't been with me,
I wouldn't have seen this day

1033
02:03:59,337 --> 02:04:03,723
You did your duty as a wife

1034
02:04:04,218 --> 02:04:10,576
Now it is time for us to enjoy
the fruits of my devotion

1035
02:04:10,976 --> 02:04:15,076
It is my duty to take you
with me

1036
02:04:16,697 --> 02:04:22,076
Avala, come.
Let us share eternal joy

1037
02:04:22,476 --> 02:04:28,943
Once you experience it
you will despise all earthly joys

1038
02:04:31,718 --> 02:04:36,902
I don't think I'll be happy there

1039
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:41,996
Without my home and children!

1040
02:04:42,396 --> 02:04:46,519
Listen to me.
Forget about heaven

1041
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:51,725
I know! You've got the
urge to wander

1042
02:04:52,125 --> 02:04:55,261
So you've thought
up this excuse

1043
02:04:55,579 --> 02:04:57,908
Go along then but
come back soon

1044
02:04:58,536 --> 02:05:01,756
I have also asked my
God for a boon

1045
02:05:02,156 --> 02:05:04,877
Remember, the kids won't
eat till you return

1046
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:11,596
Panduranga, keep her happy

1047
02:05:58,976 --> 02:06:06,422
Be happy in the world.
But let your mind transcend it

1048
02:06:07,103 --> 02:06:09,597
In my experience there
is only one way...

1049
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:15,576
...to attain God is
to chant His Name

1050
02:06:15,976 --> 02:06:23,456
It strengthens faith and
purifies the soul

1051
02:06:25,356 --> 02:06:28,196
The mind is a wanderer

1052
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:32,936
Only God's Name can
give it direction

1053
02:06:33,536 --> 02:06:40,336
Sincere love leads to
concentrated devotion

1054
02:06:40,696 --> 02:06:43,119
A continual chanting of
God's Name...

1055
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:47,260
...fills our souls with
concentrated devotion

1056
02:06:48,218 --> 02:06:52,064
Through this, one attains God

1057
02:06:52,579 --> 02:06:58,279
God's Name on the lips,
salvation in hand

1058
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:01,266
That's the experience of many

1059
02:07:01,766 --> 02:07:04,396
Meditation brings one
untold gain

1060
02:07:04,697 --> 02:07:08,636
The chanting of God's Name (nama sankirtana)

1061
02:07:08,987 --> 02:07:16,666
Lord Hari is here, holding
conchshell and the sacred wheel

1062
02:07:17,066 --> 02:07:25,136
Swooping down on the eagle (Garuda)
full of gentle assurance

1063
02:07:25,856 --> 02:07:33,183
His crown and earstuds
make the Sun look pale

1064
02:07:33,583 --> 02:07:41,824
His dusky complexion
is beautiful

1065
02:07:43,157 --> 02:07:49,765
He has four arms and wears
the Vaijayanti garland

1066
02:07:50,065 --> 02:07:57,224
His golden silk fills the
Universe with its luster

1067
02:07:58,924 --> 02:08:07,776
Tuka is contented. His heavenly
place has come to him

1068
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,056
You're not making bread while
Tuka's off to heaven? Hurry up

1069
02:08:40,763 --> 02:08:43,800
I go to where I belong

1070
02:08:45,906 --> 02:08:50,757
I bid you farewell

1071
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:02,656
Now we will not meet

1072
02:09:03,780 --> 02:09:07,118
In this birth again

1073
02:09:07,538 --> 02:09:11,100
Feel compassion for me

1074
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:13,750
I bow to you

1075
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,675
When you return to
where you belong

1076
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:21,285
Chant Vitthala's Name

1077
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,681
Chant Vitthala

1078
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,147
Chant the Names of Rama,
Krishna

1079
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:33,760
Tuka goes to Vaikuntha

1080
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,509
Panduranga Hari...

1081
02:09:58,683 --> 02:10:04,543
Janma Tukaram...
