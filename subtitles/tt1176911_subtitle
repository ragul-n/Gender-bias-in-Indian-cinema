00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,204
In our country heroes

00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,702
Heroes fight against
eviI for the good.

00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,249

Oh, I have to go back.

I want to go back.

32
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:12,226
You want to but it takes
time, understand?

33
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,239
99 crore are working here.

34
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,241
That too peopIewith 10 hands.

35
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,174
Everybody just pick up
the phone and caII up.

36
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,842
This is Paradise. Top of
agendais enjoyment.

37
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,180
Sir....
- I said no.

38
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:36,455
Look at this fiIe for exampIe.
Mrs.Savithri KuIkarni.

39
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,664
Shewas a devoted wife
in her previous birth.

40
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:47,400
Observed`Karvachout'.
But she was in ahurry.

41
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,740
And Iook at the resuIt.

42
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:58,215
Oncein a year enjoyment
then eats her mate.

43
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,346
Thatis why Mr.murugun I say
procedure has to be foIIowed.

44
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,489
Look at the appIication.
Situation is emergency.

45
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,823
Sir I have onIy done my duty.

46
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,826
I'm a cowboy and protecting
cows is my duty.

47
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,897
AII the confusion is because of
that non-veg Rice PIate Reddy,

48
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,495
and his rowdy gang.

49
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,434
A few days ago...

50
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,848
Is there someone who
wiII take my order?

51
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,855
Is everyone here
deaf or dead?

52

63

Veg or non-veg, I ive or dead,

66
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,198
This rowdy gang is turning alI
vegetarian hoteIs to non-veg.

67
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,997
They kiIIed thecows and
made menu of non-veg dishes.

68
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,335
Behind alI this thereis
a man.

Something is missing.
