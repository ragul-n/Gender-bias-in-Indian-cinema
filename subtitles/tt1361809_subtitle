00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:43,661
That's what I too can't understand.

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,704
You've come first time to your
kingdom after fixing marriage.

169
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:07,317
Seek Jejamma's bIessings.
- As you say Chandramma.

170
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:38,074
Jejamma....Jejamma...
our Jejamma...

171
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,086
First girI chiId in the famiIy
shouId aIways have my name.

172
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,421
BeIieve that I've taken birth again.

173
00:19:54,899 --> 00:20:05,901
Madam, you've kept the promise
of coming back to this kingdom.

174
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:11,678
Jejamma is not anywhere eIse,
she's aIways with us.

175
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,580
Yes, she's aIways with us.

176
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,125
Come, SusheeIa is in the fort..

177
00:20:30,802 --> 00:20:32,463
SusheeIa is in the fort...

178
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,461
....unabIe to breathe...

179
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:40,069
We must get her out of it.
- Tie him in the back yard.

180
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:41,606
She's scared,
we must get her out.

181
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:45,408
Leave me...SusheeIa is in the fort,
she's inside a grave.

182
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:48,949
I must get her out.
- How did Ramana become Iike this?

183
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:52,049
Car met with an accident near our fort
whiIe bringing your marriage invitation.

184
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,620
He's caIIing SusheeIa,
what happened to his wife?

185
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,418
Don't know what had happened to her?

186
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:57,616
Haven't you given him
any medicaI treatment?

187
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:02,391
There's a fakir here to treat such
disturbed and possessed patients.

188
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,758
I'm sending Ramana to him today.

189
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,501
Greetings Anwar bhai!
- Greetings.

190
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:12,404
Greetings fakir bhai!
- Greetings.

191
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:22,584
Come on chiIdren...take sweets...
you too take dear...

192
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:25,415
Fakir bhai, you're a MusIim,

193
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,185
why are you distributing sweets
near tempIe instead of a Durgah?

194
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:33,928
Gods may be different but the hunger
they created is same to everyone.

195
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,998
One can give food to anyone anywhere
where you find a hungry man.

196
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:42,104
Ramanamma, you too have,
eat happiIy, good business of coconuts.

197
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,931
Fakir sahib, my chiId had
a bad dream Iast night,

198
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,599
and since then hasn't passed urine.

199
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:51,612
Won't he if you Ieave him aIone
to sIeep with your husband?

200
00:21:51,782 --> 00:21:53,682
Yes sir.
- Wait and see.

201
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,482
Pass urine chiId...pass urine...

202
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:03,819
My chiId passed urine.

203
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:06,223
Ghost Ieft with urine, go away!

204
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:09,222
AIIah wiII protect you,
Lord Hanuman wiII protect you.

205
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:16,970
Leave me....Ieave me I say...
Ieave me...

206
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:22,508
I'II rip out your skin, you demon!
Shut up! Who are you?

207
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:25,841
I'm her Iover,
she refused to marry me,

208
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,915
that's why I committed suicide
by taking pesticide.

209
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,514
Is there Iove story for ghosts aIso?

210
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:36,485
Love, AIIah! Come...come inside...
go...go inside...go...

211
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:43,732
No...I can't bear it any more...no...

212
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:02,679
That's the Iine of protection of AIIah,
eviI can't cross that Iine.

213
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,881
This is hoIy tempIe for aII but
prison to ghosts Iike you.

214
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,218
Shut up! Go...go into it...go...

215
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:10,753
Go into that jar!

216
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:14,762
He Iooks Iike a mad man.
- No, he's a great man!

217
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:17,960
Go!

218
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:24,036
Enemy of the mankind!

219
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:33,049
Karim, bury this jar in the
buriaI ground tonight.- Yes sir.

220
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:35,708
Sundaramma, take your daughter.
- Okay sir.

221
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,786
AppIy kohI and make her drink
hoIy water mixed with sacred ash.

222
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:39,718
What's this, Ieave me?
- Stop...stop...- Sir sent him.

223
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:44,224
Don't Iaugh, SusheeIa is in the fort,
they brought me her instead of going there.

224
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:46,052
I'II aIso come with you.
- You come with me.

225
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,924
Let's go after warding of eviI
and offering prayers.

226
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:52,262
No need of aII that, I must go
and break open the grave.

227
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:57,001
You coward!
- Stop it!

228
00:23:58,576 --> 00:23:59,600
What are you doing?

229
00:24:00,244 --> 00:24:01,233
Our junior madam.

230
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,672
Is it treatment to beat bIack and bIue?

231
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:07,748
Man must get rid of possessed
ghosts to Iive peacefuIIy.

232
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:10,751
The stick must be tight to
make the ghost Ieave him,

233
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:12,286
do you think I beat others for fun?

234
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,749
Do you stiII beIieve in ghosts?

235
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,294
Do you beIieve in God?
- I beIieve, so what?

236
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,163
Then, you must beIieve there are ghosts.

237
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:22,025
Then, show me a ghost.

238
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:27,166
Is it paining?
- Yes sir.

239
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:31,967
He said it's paining, show me his pain.

240
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,837
Show me the air!
Show me your Iife!

241
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:41,849
What is not seen isn't unreaI
and what is seen isn't aIways reaI.

242
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:43,719
Does your hoIy Koran says it?

243
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,279
Even hoIy Geeta too says it.

244
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,127
If your hoIy thread is reaI,
then amuIet I give is aIso reaI,

245
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:02,999
if the coconut you break is true,
then the Iemon I tie is aIso reaI,

246
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:05,801
If this is reaI before God,
then this is reaI for ghosts.

247
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:06,670
Stop it!

248
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:09,308
Why are you beating a mentaIIy
unstabIe man bIack and bIue?

249
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:12,081
He's in very danger.
- OnIy if he's here.

250
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:26,891
Madam, he's not in danger but you!

251
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:30,024
There's a danger Iurking around you.

252
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:31,360
Trying to make me beIieve you?

253
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,670
But I'm teIIing you the truth.
- You can't cheat me.

254
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,364
Go away...go away immediateIy
from this pIace.

255
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:41,166
If he's so insisting,
I think he has a reason.

256
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:42,367
You keep quiet.
- No madam.

257
00:25:42,713 --> 00:25:44,840
You keep quiet Chandramma.
Let's take him.

258
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:04,460
Thinking about you,
waiting for you,

259
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,528
a souI here is yearning for you.

260
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:15,205
Come quickIy and reIieve me
from this sorrow of separation.

261
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:18,605
How? I'm not in Hyderabad, right?
- I'm aIso in GadwaI.

262
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:21,078
GadwaI?
Do you know what's the time now?

263
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:25,147
Midnight 12, unabIe to reach
your house in this darkness,

264
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,417
there's an oId fort on the outskirts,
I'm waiting there for you.

265
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,058
You stay there, I'II come in 10 minutes.

266
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,764
Where are you going madam?

267
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:45,296
I'm going out and
wiII be back in 10 minutes.

268
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:25,440
Why did you come here, madam?

269
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:28,473
PIease go away, madam.

270
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:32,353
RahuI is inside.
- There are no humans inside.

271
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,124
Don't go, madam.
- That's my RahuI's whistIe.- Madam!

272
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,700
Where are you RahuI?

273
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,170
Where is he?

274
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,737
May I sing...

275
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,677
...the song of sorrow...

276
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:43,615
Come dear!

277
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,353
Come upstairs!

278
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,862
He's in upstairs,
he's waiting for you onIy.

279
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,361
Come dear...come...

280
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:57,429
Come...

281
00:28:58,373 --> 00:28:59,431
Come...

282
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,242
Arundhati, here!

283
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:07,313
I've been waiting for Iong time
for you in this room.

284
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:31,234
When I hear your voice, memories of
aII that you've done is coming back.

285
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:35,671
I'm unabIe to toIerate
seeing you so near.

286
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,469
Come...come nearer to me.

287
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,807
Every passing moment
is making me go mad.

288
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,744
Come...come...
if you don't then you'II die!

289
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:48,821
You can't harm me!

290
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:57,022
Arundhati, I'II kiII you.

291
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,833
You can never come out of that grave.

292
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:07,441
I'II come out.
- I'II not Iet you come out.

293
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:12,273
I'II chase you...chase you...
I'II offer your Iife as sacrifice.

294
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,946
I'II come to show you heII.

295
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:20,311
Hey BommaIi! I'II not Ieave you!

296
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:25,519
Madam...

297
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,654
Leave my hand.
- What are you doing, madam?

298
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,798
Didn't I teII you to Ieave this town?

299
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,524
Why did you come to this pIace?

300
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,961
That demon caIIed you here to kiII you.

301
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:37,666
What that nonsense you're saying?

302
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,863
RahuI is inside.
- No, there's no one inside.

303
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:41,872
He's there inside.
- No!

304
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,306
No!

305
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:44,867
Nobody's in there!

306
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:46,673
No...no...nobody.

307
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:48,007
I came here after getting a phone caII.

308
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:51,874
CaII him on phone and
know where he is.

309
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:57,016
How Iong shouId I've to wait for you?

310
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,023
This man here is creating nuisance here.

311
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:01,418
Where are you now?
- I'm in Vijayawada now.

312
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:04,497
Vijayawada?

313
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,370
The phone caII you got is reaI,

314
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:14,337
you answering that caII is reaI,

315
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:16,374
but it's not reaI that RahuI is here.

316
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,570
What you see with your eyes is
not aIways reaI, madam,

317
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:23,342
there's an eviI empire of ghosts
and demons in the air around us.

318
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:26,453
You can see it in
the Iight of aImighty AIIah!

319
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:33,723
Understood it?

320
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:36,928
Have you understood everything?

321
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:43,594
Hey BommaIi! I'II not Ieave you!
I'II come for you.

322
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:51,603
Go away from this town.

323
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,069
Go away!

324
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:15,895
PIease go away, madam.

325
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,072
There are no humans inside.

326
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:22,635
Who is he?

327
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:27,638
My eIder brother Veerendra Varma.
He died 30 years ago.

328
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:36,856
PeopIe say he's seen
sometimes near that fort.

329
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:41,425
It's their imagination.
How can they see him?

330
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:47,098
Where are you now?
- I'm in Vijayawada now.

331
00:33:02,884 --> 00:33:06,877
Go away!
- Hey BommaIi! I'II not Ieave you!

332
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,098
What's it madam?

333
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,292
I want aII the detaiIs about our fort.

334
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,437
PIease, teII me Chandramma.

335
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,304
Why are you asking about it?
No, madam.

336
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:37,438
PIease don't think about it.

337
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,774
What's the story behind that fort?

338
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,651
It's not a story, it's a bad dream.

339
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,447
A bad dream you never
want to think about again.

340
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,250
PIease teII me about it.

341
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,595
You're asking the story about yourseIf.
Your own story!

342
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:05,141
That's not a fort,
it's GadwaI kingdom.

343
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,336
Epitome of vaIour and pride.

344
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,146
With smiIes of chiIdren,
affection and Iove,

345
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:23,824
our kingdom was fiIIed
with happiness and festivities.

346
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:33,569
Your great great grandfather
Raja Chinnavenkata Rangarauyudu was king

347
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,639
He had two daughters,
Queen died when they were chiIdren.

348
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,701
EIder daughter was Bhargavi,

349
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,372
she was beautifuI and very innocent,

350
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,642
she never went against father's word.

351
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,183
Younger daughter was Arundhati,

352
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,847
a ferocious tigress of the empire,

353
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,663
Nobody couId chaIIenge her
in sword fighting or in archery.

354
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,527
She was born with Ieadership quaIities.

355
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,400
The vaIour and confidence in her eyes,

356
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,332
and the courage,

357
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:18,204
she appeared Iike GadwaI's
presiding deity Goddess Jejamma.

358
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,348
That's why everyone
caIIed her as Jejamma.

359
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,753
Like in every story
there wiII be a viIIain,

360
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,986
this story too has a viIIain.

361
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,231
Hey BommaIi!
- Leave me...

362
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,769
He was a sex maniac!

363
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,912
Never Ieft any woman he Iiked.

364
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,647
He used to chase Iike them
Iike a pack of hungry jackaIs.

365
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,776
He was King's nephew Pasupathi.

366
00:35:58,889 --> 00:35:59,787
Pasupathi?

367
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,254
Leave me...Ieave me...

368
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,658
He used to kiII anyone opposing him.

369
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,233
He was a man in appearance
but a beast in character.

370
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:20,804
King's biggest mistake was to
get Bhargavi married to him.

371
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:24,412
His scheming mother JaIajamma
was behind aII this.

372
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,241
King's sister.

373
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:31,945
She cheated King by saying that
their horoscopes matched perfectIy,

374
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,689
and got her son married to
his eIder daughter Bhargavi.

375
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,424
What's this, hubby?

376
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:58,313
Is it good on your part to bring
these cheap women to home?

377
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,378
If they are cheap women,
then you too are cheap.

378
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:10,459
Come...come BommaIi...
- Leave me.

379
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:20,797
This is quite common in royaI famiIies,
why are you making it an issue?

380
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,296
Go away!

381
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:30,345
That innocent girI's Iife got ruined
by the duo of mother and son.

382
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,740
One fine day, they went further down.

383
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:40,988
Arundhati was Iearning a speciaI dance
from a Varanasi danseuse,

384
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:46,758
She was bIind.

385
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,565
Look Arundhati, today I'm going
to teach you a new dance.

386
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,703
RoyaI women,
especiaIIy future queens Iike you,

387
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,000
must Iearn this dance.

388
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,369
Like in archery,
aiming target Iistening to sound,

389
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,707
this is known as Dance of sound.

390
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,509
You make the sound,

391
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,353
watch how I respond with
echoes my dance moves.

392
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,579
Okay madam.

393
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,877
Even if it's a heart beat,
I'II hit the buIIs eye.

394
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,883
Junior madam, King is caIIing you.

395
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,952
Okay, you go, I'II come.

396
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:50,557
He came Iike a hungry beast
fuIIy drunk with desires.

397
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,971
Fresh smeII!

398
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:08,577
I shudder even today when I think
of what he did that day.

399
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:14,651
I'II come to take you,
I'II do what I came here for.

400
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,657
Come Arundhati!

401
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,604
I'm going to teach you the
dance of Pranava Bhairava.

402
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,008
If you do this dance before an
enemy in an heIpIess situation,

403
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,481
you can save yourseIf.

404
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,792
Who is it? Arundhati?

405
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,027
Why don't you answer me?
Who is it?

406
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:14,840
Who is it?

407
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,980
You came here to teach dance of vaIour.

408
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:23,044
I came to you to Iearn
the dance of Iove.

409
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,187
Leave me!

410
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,529
Come here!

411
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,068
Arundhati, madam Kanchana is not weII,

412
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,741
she Ieft just now
promising to come tomorrow.

413
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,261
You're very Iucky, BommaIi.

414
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,797
You're dying whiIe enjoying sex.

415
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,672
You fuIfiIIed my sex desire
even as you die.

416
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,594
You're banished from this kingdom.

417
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,638
You came here after bringing
bad name to your In-Iaws.

418
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,708
Nobody can toIerate if you son
ruins the honour of this royaI famiIy.

419
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,610
Be carefuI!

420
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,642
You mustn't forgive a man
who did this grievous crime.

421
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,185
Father, banish them from
here immediateIy.

422
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,991
I'm not toIerating him
because he's my son-in-Iaw,

423
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,661
your sister's Iife is in his hands.

424
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,131
If she's not married to him,

425
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,997
my one order is enough
for my subjects to Iynch him.

426
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,731
Come, do we Iook Iike mad?

427
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,670
Why are your peopIe angry
on me and my mother?

428
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,871
Do they think we are useIess?
I'II kiII you.

429
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,215
No son! Listen to me.
- Leave my hand.

430
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,645
Leave it, don't rush.

431
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:17,658
She must be aIive tiII you become
the heir to this kingdom.

432
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:23,022
OnIy then you can
next king as son-in-Iaw.

433
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,693
That's why I got her married to you.

434
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:34,240
If she dies, we'II not have
any pIace in this royaI famiIy.

435
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,179
They wiII hunt us down to death,
remember that.

436
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,842
your sister's Iife is in his hands.

437
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,922
If she dies, we'II not have
any pIace in this royaI famiIy.

438
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,253
If she's not married to him,

439
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:58,263
my one order is enough
for my subjects to Iynch him.

440
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:01,926
If she dies, we'II not have
any pIace in this royaI famiIy.

441
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:02,867
my one order is enough
for my subjects to Iynch him.

442
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,372
...we'II not have any pIace
in this royaI famiIy.

443
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:08,004
Madam Bhargavi!

444
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:11,710
My dear Bhargavi!

445
00:44:57,292 --> 00:45:00,227
There's no beauty or fun
in the home with a dead body.

446
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:18,442
How Iong wiII you keep the body
of one who committed suicide?

447
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:21,845
Throw it away!

448
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:31,591
This is your end!

449
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:07,127
Leave my son...don't beat my son.

450
00:46:07,295 --> 00:46:12,289
Leave him...don't kiII him...
Ieave him...

451
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:13,832
Throw her away!

452
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:26,307
Leave him....Ieave him...
don't beat him!

453
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:30,474
His gory death must scare any man
even to think of other woman.

454
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:34,717
Not onIy him but
even after his death,

455
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:38,381
even dogs must hate
to see his body.

456
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:43,595
Tie this womaniZer to
his own wiId horse.

457
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:06,752
This is your end!

458
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,951
You must meet a dusty end!

459
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:13,755
Drag him away!

460
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:32,708
That day Arundhati not onIy chased out
a crueI man

461
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:36,317
but his IawIessness,
His arrogance! His vioIence!

462
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,882
Ever since then peopIe considered
Arundhati as Goddess Jejamma.

463
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:46,416
Called her as Jejamma!

464
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,091
She grew up and
was darling of everyone.

465
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:51,093
she became a saviour Goddess.

466
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:59,296
You're the light of hope
in the tunnel of the darkness...

467
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:09,314
You're Goddess Kali with the sword...

468
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:19,117
Your ferocious look is enough
to make enemy's sword to shiver...

469
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:26,892
When you paint.
it's a mirror image of your heart...

470
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:34,605
You're Goddess Annapurna
who feeds everyone...

471
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:42,274
You're mother earth in
looking after her children...

472
00:48:42,482 --> 00:48:45,940
When you say it's a holy hymn...

473
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:50,022
When you do something.
it's an irrevocable law...

474
00:48:50,924 --> 00:48:54,416
You're patient like mother earth...

475
00:48:54,628 --> 00:49:00,931
You're an epitome of justice...

476
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:04,034
This is my kingdom. be careful!

477
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:19,108
Jejamma...our mother...O Jejamma...

478
00:49:40,037 --> 00:49:45,304
Jejamma's words were edicts
to her subjects.

479
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:50,037
PeopIe Iived happiIy under her ruIe.

480
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:56,482
But Pasupathi didn't die
as peopIe thought.

481
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:03,315
His vengeance on Arundhati
kept him aIive.

482
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:07,924
Some peopIe passing that way
saved his Iife.

483
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,599
They were Agoras!

484
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:17,001
They Iived with dead souIs,
ghosts and demons.

485
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:19,505
They were sorcerers and
offered prayers with dead bodies.

486
00:50:19,843 --> 00:50:24,871
They took Iives using eviI souIs.

487
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:29,349
This is your end!

488
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:40,958
He studied art of Tantric from Agoras
to take revenge on Arundhati.

489
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:46,897
He took Iives using tantricism
by crueI methods of witchcraft.

490
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:49,232
He offered prayers with dead bodies.

491
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,632
He drank human bIood.

492
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:55,204
Doing many such inhuman
and disgusting things,

493
00:50:55,545 --> 00:50:59,242
atIast he achieved many eviI powers.

494
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:00,916
He's not a human any more.

495
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:06,579
He's a tantric with many
eviI souIs dweIIing in his body.

496
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:14,453
He entered GadwaI again to
take revenge on Arundhati.

497
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:32,673
Bad Iuck, Arundhati got married
on that day's morning,

498
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,608
Entire GadwaI was ceIebrating the event.

499
00:51:38,488 --> 00:51:40,012
KiII him!

500
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,962
even dogs must hate
to see his body.

501
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:11,516
Who are you? AIms are given outside
not inside. Go and stand outside.

502
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:12,711
Who am I?

503
00:52:19,996 --> 00:52:23,523
CIose aII the eight directions!

504
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:31,064
Who am I?

505
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,677
Who am I?

506
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:41,016
Pasupathi!

507
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:45,146
Leader of Agoras!

508
00:52:57,434 --> 00:53:01,427
No madam, that eviI man is
endowed with great power.

509
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:06,334
Nobody can go against him,
no weapon can kiII him.

510
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:11,572
It's very dangerous
to chaIIenge him now.

511
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:16,049
His tongue commands death!
His hands take Iives.

512
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:31,457
It's very dangerous to face him now.

513
00:53:52,155 --> 00:53:55,420
Never take a back step with
cowardice on facing danger.

514
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:01,623
Even if it's death, face it!

515
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:06,765
Arundhati, I'II not Ieave you,
I'II not Ieave anyone in your famiIy.

516
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:09,397
I'II decimate everyone.

517
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:18,308
With whom you got me beaten up,
come out into open I say!

518
00:54:23,854 --> 00:54:26,084
Arundhati...

519
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,181
Why did you come out, dear?

520
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:53,145
Arundhati?!

521
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:58,152
What a stunning beauty!

522
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:03,826
The bud has bIossomed!

523
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:14,464
I came here to shred you into pieces.

524
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:17,373
But I'II not kiII you.

525
00:55:18,475 --> 00:55:22,377
I've been Iiving for seven years
without touching a woman,

526
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:27,243
I didn't expect meeting
such a ravishing beauty.

527
00:55:29,386 --> 00:55:33,720
A woman considers chastity
more than her Iife, right?

528
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:37,658
So I'II maIign your honour first,
then I'II take your Iife,

529
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:39,727
bury you in the middIe of your home,

530
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,660
and offer your souI to my eviI God.

531
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:14,888
O debauch!

532
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,826
Waves of echoes...

533
00:56:21,903 --> 00:56:23,894
Beat of deadly percussion...

534
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:28,374
My inner soul...

535
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:37,507
Waves of revenge are lashing
and dancing with vengeance...

536
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:56,929
I don't want song. Bommali!

537
00:57:01,943 --> 00:57:07,540
May I sing the song of sorrow....

538
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:14,214
May I perform dance of death...

539
00:57:15,089 --> 00:57:19,355
When darkness is enveloping
from all sides...

540
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:24,089
In the raging fires of
slavery and harems...

541
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:26,425
Inauspicious time has set in...

542
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:28,898
Ill fortune followed it...

543
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:31,094
Death is chasing...

544
00:57:31,305 --> 00:57:33,432
Life span is diminishing...

545
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:41,639
This agony will end with my death only...

546
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,108
The agony isn't yours. it's mine.

547
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:53,055
You made my life miserable
by tying me to my horse.

548
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:58,563
Right now as you watch
I'll make her life go the dogs.

549
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,457
The real game begins at upstairs only.

550
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:02,934
Anyway you've fixed time
for the honeymoon.

551
00:58:03,137 --> 00:58:05,469
happiness will be mine.
opportunity is mine.

552
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:07,140
losing honour is yours.

553
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:13,471
Lord Brahma himself can't
change the fate he writes...

554
00:58:18,252 --> 00:58:22,951
If you deviate from the righteous path.
God will punish you...

555
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:32,157
You can never challenge and win
against your fate. you better know it...

556
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:36,928
Demon Ravana died for
desiring Goddess Seetha...

557
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:41,507
Evil desires never get fulfilled...

558
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:46,305
Playing with honour of women
is danger to you...

559
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:49,176
As a woman I'm singing...

560
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:54,052
....your end of life...

561
00:58:55,957 --> 00:59:00,951
Evil will perish...Eight hands of
Goddess Durga will cut you to size...

562
00:59:05,399 --> 00:59:07,333
As a woman's rage turns
into a raging wild fire...

563
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:09,469
Raging fires of the womanhood
is seeking a sacrifice...

564
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:16,667
Your ghastly death....

565
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:21,104
GhastIy death to me? No way!

566
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:26,249
Death fears me!
It'II run away!

567
00:59:26,518 --> 00:59:29,851
I'II offer your Iife to it.

568
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:37,453
O BommaIi! Make your ankIets cIang in
rhyme with the music of my sheIIs.

569
01:00:00,218 --> 01:00:05,155
That day when I enjoyed sex
with your dance teacher,

570
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:08,018
getting angry you kicked me.

571
01:00:08,226 --> 01:00:14,825
Today I must enjoy you with
every ceII in my body.

572
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:16,898
BommaIi! Come on dance!

573
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:19,969
These cIothes wiII become daggers!

574
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:21,231
Cut the tongue of a tantric
who recites eviI hymns.

575
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:25,201
Tie his hands!

576
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:28,198
StrangIe his neck!

577
01:01:28,873 --> 01:01:30,898
OnIy then you can confine him.

578
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:17,418
No...no madam...don't rush!
Don't kiII him.

579
01:02:19,157 --> 01:02:21,955
If you kiII him, he'II become
a powerfuI eviI souI.

580
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:22,956
You mean...?

581
01:02:23,594 --> 01:02:26,688
He's now with an unfuIfiIIed
desire of taking revenge on you.

582
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:28,496
According to our scriptures,

583
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,594
anyone who dies with unfuIfiIIed
desires wiII ot Ieave this worId.

584
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:35,599
It'II take revenge.

585
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:41,173
If an eviI Agoras Iike him dies,
he'II become a mighty eviI power.

586
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:50,182
But if I spare him,
he'II Iet anyone to Iive.

587
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:53,954
You're right madam,
but there's no soIution to his probIem.

588
01:02:54,125 --> 01:03:01,463
If so then I'II not kiII him,
I'II bury him aIive right now here.

589
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:08,534
I'II imprison him so that even
his souI wiII not come out of it.

590
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:14,305
I'II use every GodIy power
on earth to make his grave.

591
01:03:15,346 --> 01:03:20,545
I'II ensure that his souI never
comes out of that grave

592
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:29,692
But if anyone breaks open his grave,
his eviI souI wiII bring onIy destruction.

593
01:03:30,094 --> 01:03:33,029
It wiII destroy you and your kingdom.

594
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:35,222
It mustn't happen at any cost.

595
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:38,561
Nobody wiII enter this fort
after burying him in his grave.

596
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,169
Dig his grave!

597
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:45,508
That eviI man shivered in fear
hearing madam's decision.

598
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:49,575
Bringing stones from
different hoIy pIaces,

599
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:53,046
Jejamma started buiIding
an impregnabIe grave.

600
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:03,456
The eviI beast was crying
ferociousIy in his grave.

601
01:04:06,697 --> 01:04:10,531
The fort shuddered for his Ioud cries.

602
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:14,705
You must die going through
heII with nerves getting cut.

603
01:04:15,073 --> 01:04:19,737
She got ready powerfuI amuIets.

604
01:04:20,144 --> 01:04:26,083
She got them naiIed to the waIIs
and made it air tight.

605
01:04:27,485 --> 01:04:32,218
She invited every Vedic schoIar
in the kingdom.

606
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,755
She arranged Chandi and
Rudra sacrifices.

607
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:40,560
That eviI souI's cries got buried
in the hoIy chants of hymns.

608
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:43,723
Lord Shiva's tridents which
protect the worId,

609
01:04:44,068 --> 01:04:49,768
Jejamma got them fixed around his
grave so that he'II never come out.

610
01:04:55,413 --> 01:05:03,787
At that moment she appeared Iike
Goddess KaIi who came to save us.

611
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:19,759
After that we never entered the fort.

612
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:23,767
That fort too got diaIpidated
aIong with that grave.

613
01:05:24,142 --> 01:05:27,669
That brought an end to his atrocities.

614
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:29,101
No!

615
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:30,609
I'II not Ieave you.

616
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,544
No, it didn't end.

617
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:35,785
ReaIIy, Jejamma did a great thing.

618
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:43,686
Yes, but burying him aIive that
day disturbed her Iife.

619
01:05:44,162 --> 01:05:47,154
48 days after he was buried aIive...

620
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,694
After that...?
- After that...?...

621
01:05:50,902 --> 01:05:57,637
After that...there's so much
to say about her...

622
01:05:57,842 --> 01:06:00,572
we are getting Iate,
you go to sIeep now.

623
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:04,646
Go, don't think about it.
SIeep peacefuIIy.

624
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,718
What happened after 48 days, Chandramma?

625
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:14,323
That is...that is...

626
01:06:14,525 --> 01:06:16,516
Jejamma and I onIy know it.

627
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:20,857
TeII me, I must know it.
I need to know it.

628
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:27,398
48 days Iater, one night...

629
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:31,730
Heard a cry from that fort,

630
01:06:32,176 --> 01:06:34,838
it was his outcry!

631
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:42,886
come...

632
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:53,361
I'm your brother-in-Iaw Pasupathi.

633
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:55,697
I'm hungry.

634
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,430
Thirsty, I'm dying with thirst.

635
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:05,230
ReIease me, break open this grave.

636
01:07:05,443 --> 01:07:07,377
I'm dying...

637
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:19,715
Come...do you know this?
Do you know I died 3 days ago?

638
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:23,724
You're taIking to my souI!

639
01:07:31,235 --> 01:07:33,897
I died a painfuI agoniZing
death because of you.

640
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,913
My body has decayed,
it's stinking with worms.

641
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:49,485
I'II not Ieave you...
not Ieave you...

642
01:07:49,687 --> 01:07:53,623
I'II not Iet anyone in
your famiIy to Iive.

643
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:56,418
But a woman!

644
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:08,766
I'II make you cry aIoud pIunging
you into deep pain of sorrow.

645
01:08:08,939 --> 01:08:12,932
I'II have you Iike a dog.
I'II cut you Iike a goat.

646
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:16,610
I'II not Ieave you, BommaIi!

647
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:25,918
Come!
- He's right there! StiII...

648
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:29,921
ReIease me.
- I'm coming.

649
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:37,924
He mustn't come out at any cost.

650
01:08:38,133 --> 01:08:41,933
I'II come this night,
this moment for you.

651
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:47,072
Break me free!

652
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:52,279
Come...come...
- Hit with power!

653
01:08:53,148 --> 01:08:55,275
He must remain in the grave forever.

654
01:08:56,485 --> 01:08:57,952
Break yourseIf free.

655
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:00,954
He mustn't come out at any cost.

656
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:03,750
I'II come, I'II definiteIy come.

657
01:09:04,826 --> 01:09:07,158
PuII it...puII it with aII your strength.

658
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:09,896
PuII it...

659
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,968
PuII it...puII it...puII it...

660
01:09:27,182 --> 01:09:31,915
SusheeIa, I'm coming!
- Come!

661
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,418
SusheeIa, I'm coming!
- Come!

662
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,137
SusheeIa, I'm coming!
- Come and free me.

663
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,769
Don't come, go away!

664
01:10:01,216 --> 01:10:02,945
Don't come, go away!

665
01:10:03,051 --> 01:10:03,949
Go away!

666
01:10:09,024 --> 01:10:10,013
AIIah the great!

667
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:16,497
I've come...I'II break open the grave.

668
01:10:16,898 --> 01:10:18,160
I'II free you out.

669
01:10:20,836 --> 01:10:24,499
Goddess Jejamma, everyone say
I'm your reincarnation.

670
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:28,307
But I'm not as brave as you.

671
01:10:28,977 --> 01:10:31,502
You're a great woman to
bury such an eviI man.

672
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:36,047
But why is he stiII in that grave?

673
01:10:38,386 --> 01:10:41,219
Come...
- I've come.

674
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:44,053
Come to me...

675
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:53,396
By chance if he comes out,
can I face him braveIy Iike you?

676
01:10:54,402 --> 01:10:56,927
No, I'm not Jejamma!

677
01:10:57,405 --> 01:10:58,838
He can't come out.

678
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:00,601
Here!

679
01:11:01,076 --> 01:11:02,270
Here!

680
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:05,207
Hit...break it open!

681
01:11:05,514 --> 01:11:06,538
Hit!

682
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:09,407
Hit1 !...

683
01:11:09,618 --> 01:11:12,086
He can't come out of the grave.

684
01:11:18,193 --> 01:11:19,091
He can't come out.

685
01:11:20,295 --> 01:11:21,023
Break it open!

686
01:11:22,898 --> 01:11:27,301
Hit...hit...hit hard...

687
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:34,634
Freedom...

688
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:46,912
Son...freedom to my son...
My son is getting freed.

689
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:50,558
Freedom...freedom...

690
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:55,125
My son is getting freed.

691
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:52,511
WiII you stay back there onIy?

692
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:53,949
When are you coming back?

693
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:56,181
Are you hearing me or not?

694
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:02,191
I came to know many
new things about my famiIy.- What is it?

695
01:13:02,397 --> 01:13:05,730
It seems many years ago
there Iived a sadist in my famiIy,

696
01:13:06,401 --> 01:13:09,199
Everyone fear him.

697
01:13:10,305 --> 01:13:12,967
But he fears Jejamma.

698
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:19,078
It seems Jejamma punished him
severeIy for his atrocities.

699
01:13:19,414 --> 01:13:22,008
I hate even to think about him.

700
01:13:23,985 --> 01:13:29,981
He is...
- Pasupathi, master of Agoras.

701
01:13:32,427 --> 01:13:35,555
RahuI, I'II caII you Iater.
- But Aru...

702
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:37,425
You made a grave mistake.

703
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:46,438
It was your grave mistake
of burying me aIive.

704
01:13:47,575 --> 01:13:53,241
Not 10 or 20 years, I was decaying
in that grave for 80 years.

705
01:13:54,015 --> 01:13:56,006
I was raging with revenge.

706
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:07,527
After years I've come out!
I've come out.

707
01:14:23,144 --> 01:14:25,271
Same fragrance!

708
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:30,617
From this moment
no more smiIe in your Iife.

709
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:33,754
You'II worry to Iive,
and wish to die but can't.

710
01:14:34,155 --> 01:14:37,147
You'II not know what's happening
....death!

711
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:50,093
What's it madam?

712
01:14:50,438 --> 01:14:51,427
Did you enter my room a IittIe whiIe ago?

713
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:55,575
No madam, I brought your miIk,
may I add sugar?

714
01:14:55,744 --> 01:14:57,575
No need. You can go now.
- Okay madam.

715
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:11,316
No, this is not true.
He's...not here!

716
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,756
My neck...it's my dream...
...dream...

717
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:19,529
He's not here!

718
01:15:21,536 --> 01:15:22,264
He is...

719
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:46,887
What happened?

720
01:15:47,362 --> 01:15:49,830
Nothing, when are we going to Hyderabad?

721
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:54,133
Tomorrow evning.
- No, we are Ieaving by morning.

722
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,166
What happened?

723
01:15:56,805 --> 01:15:59,831
Don't ask me anything.
We must Ieave before tomorrow's dawn.

724
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,575
He's here onIy,
what shouId I do now?

725
01:16:07,816 --> 01:16:11,650
Madam, he's not in danger but you!
There's a danger Iurking around you.

726
01:16:12,187 --> 01:16:14,246
I must meet Anwar at any cost now.

727
01:16:43,852 --> 01:16:45,342
He's not here.
- No there?

728
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,885
He went to BanganapaIIi yesterday.

729
01:16:47,288 --> 01:16:48,755
When wiII he come back.
- Don't know madam.

730
01:16:48,957 --> 01:16:51,687
I must meet him immediateIy.
Come.

731
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:57,355
No madam, it'II take 4 hours by car,
short cut wiII take 30 minutes onIy.

732
01:16:57,532 --> 01:17:00,365
I'II go immediateIy.
- Go, don't deIay.

733
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:02,365
I'II come fast, immediateIy.

734
01:17:10,645 --> 01:17:15,639
You mustn't get heIp from anyone.
I'II not Iet it happen, don't try.

735
01:17:18,219 --> 01:17:20,653
This earth and air is heII to you.

736
01:17:21,256 --> 01:17:24,316
Go...go away from GadwaI!

737
01:18:39,734 --> 01:18:41,395
Oh God! It's madam!

738
01:18:44,072 --> 01:18:45,300
Train is approaching.

739
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,740
Madam, start the car!

740
01:18:54,415 --> 01:18:57,009
Oh! I don't find anything near!

741
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:39,017
BommaIi! I didn't bring you here
to Iet you go back.

742
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:44,588
Don't ever try to Ieave GadwaI again.

743
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:11,813
I'II not Ieave you...
you're confused, right?

744
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:14,683
Don't you feeI the noose is tightening?

745
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:21,686
Don't get scared,
I'II not Iet you die so easiIy.

746
01:20:21,897 --> 01:20:23,831
I'II not Iet you die, BommaIi!

747
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:26,433
Madam, get ready quickIy.

748
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,830
Where?
- Asking me where, Manga?

749
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:33,236
We must go to madam's marriage, right?
- Marriage?

750
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,910
Go, marriage is canceIIed.

751
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:45,016
We are ready to Ieave.
You too come down quickIy.

752
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:48,723
You mustn't go, onIy they must go.

753
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:53,390
You must send them.
You mustn't teII them anything.

754
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:56,924
You wait outside, I'II bring her.
- Come.

755
01:20:57,065 --> 01:21:01,263
They wiII aIso meet the same end,
ask them to Ieave.

756
01:21:02,938 --> 01:21:03,802
Go!

757
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:12,870
We are ready to Ieave...
why are you Iooking sick?

758
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:16,076
No.
- ShaII we Ieave then?

759
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:17,081
You go now.

760
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:19,880
What about you?

761
01:21:20,823 --> 01:21:24,953
I'II stay back here for two days
and come Iater.

762
01:21:25,727 --> 01:21:26,955
I'II come IeisureIy.

763
01:21:27,162 --> 01:21:29,960
Your marriage day is fast approaching,

764
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:33,760
I want to take rest for two days.
- How can you stay here aIone? Come.

765
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:36,733
Can't I stay here for 2 days?
- Why not?- Then...?

766
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:40,238
I don't Iike to Ieave her aIone here.

767
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:44,971
I don't need to expIain anyone,
I'm staying back here.

768
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:47,311
You may aII go.
- No..?

769
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,183
If anyone objects now,
it's Iike kiIIing me.- Oh no!

770
01:21:53,088 --> 01:21:55,249
No need to swear for siIIy things.

771
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:58,984
ReIatives wiII not Iet her
stay peacefuIIy there.

772
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:03,255
She'II come IeisureIy.
- I forgot about it.

773
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,927
You stay here and take rest.

774

You'II come, right?
Let's go Chandramma.

775
01:22:12,774 --> 01:22:16,141
What's the matter, dear?
You Iook different from yesterday.

776
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:22,015
Don't think too much about
that diIapidated fort.

777
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:24,018
Don't think too much, dear.

01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:31,158
She'II stay here and come Iater,

No father...
- What no?

781
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:37,897
Asking too many questions,
can't she stay here aIone for few days?

782
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:40,499
Come...
- Come...

783
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:57,918
Grandpa!

01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:03,324

01:24:04,553 --> 01:24:05,986
I'II not kiII!

793
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:12,922
If I want to kiII you, wouId've done it
the moment I came out of the grave.

794
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:20,134
I want to enjoy wiIdIy your beauty
and your pride, BommaIi.

795
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:33,339
Hey Satan!

796
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:41,081
Hey I'II not Ieave...

797
01:24:42,024 --> 01:24:43,082
Don't worry dear.

798
01:24:54,269 --> 01:25:01,368
Leave me...
- I'II not Ieave....not Ieave...

799
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:13,643
Why?

800
01:25:16,058 --> 01:25:17,719
Why is he angry on me?

801
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:23,993
Why this torture?
- Revenge dear, revenge.

802
01:25:33,075 --> 01:25:36,203
He was buried aIive, right?

803
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:37,977
That's why!

804
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,137
I didn't do it, Jejamma did it.

805
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:45,019
Aren't you Jejamma?
- Me?

806
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,149
Aren't you our Arundhati madam?

807
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:53,019
Don't taIk rubbish, Chandramm.
Don't confuse me, I'm not Jejamma.

808
01:25:53,228 --> 01:25:55,321
No...no...

809
01:25:55,997 --> 01:25:59,228
If you're not Jejamma,
why is he seeking revenge on you?

810
01:26:00,335 --> 01:26:02,030
Why...?

811
01:26:02,237 --> 01:26:05,172
Because you are Jejamma!
- No, it's faIse!

812
01:26:06,174 --> 01:26:08,233
If Jejamma had thought
about destroying him,

813
01:26:08,443 --> 01:26:10,172
then she must've known the way,

814
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:13,246
you're reincarnation of Jejamma,
pIease teII us how?

815
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,348
I'm not Jejamma,
why don't you Iisten to me?

816
01:26:16,051 --> 01:26:17,575
What's these fake taIes around me?

817
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,181
Is it not true the
destruction around you?- True.

818
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:25,382
Is it faIse that he chaIIenged
to ruin your Iife?- True.

819
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:29,690
Is it faIse that he came
out of grave to torment you?

820
01:26:30,365 --> 01:26:32,128
True...it's true.

821
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:34,401
Then it's true that you're Jejamma!

822
01:26:34,603 --> 01:26:37,265
I beIieve you're reincarnated Jejamma,
I swear on AIIah.

823
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:38,700
That is not true.
- Yes it is.

824
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,600
No...no...
- This is true...true...

825
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,742
Watch out!

826
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:50,708
You've kept your promise Jejamma...

827
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:55,751
You've come back...

828
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:59,091
Look Chandramma!
Isn't she Jejamma?

829
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:00,761
Yes.
- Jejamma!

830
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:03,563
This sword styIe is Jejamma's,
who eIse's?

831
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:05,733
Yes, the same royaI demeanor.

832
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:10,401
I feeI Iike seeing madam,
I feeI Iike seeing Jejamma.

833
01:27:11,506 --> 01:27:15,237
Think...go back to past and think.

834
01:27:16,645 --> 01:27:17,634
Think...

835
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:22,079
Forget the present.

836
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:25,651
Go into the darkness of nature
that defines Iife and death.

837
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:28,184
Provoke Jejamma in you.

838
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,321
Go into the past and think.
Go...think...

839
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,455
I feeI Iike seeing myseIf.

840
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:37,754
Find a Iead...think...

841
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:39,862
I feeI Iike he's saying something.

842
01:27:40,869 --> 01:27:46,671
Think...think...think...think...

843
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:21,767
This is a seIf portrait by Jejamma.

844
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:38,790
If you read this,
it means he has come out.

845
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:44,088
I don't know if you know this
or not but I know.

846
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:46,329
That I'm reading this.

847
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:52,432
This is a diary I wrote to
remember what had happened.

848
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:57,206
Once when he dies and
becomes an eviI souI,

849
01:28:58,013 --> 01:29:02,473
as he promised to torture me,
he did exactIy Iike that.

850
01:29:02,884 --> 01:29:04,010
I'II not Ieave you.

851
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:07,950
A strange disease spread
from the grave.

852
01:29:08,123 --> 01:29:14,289
Your subjects wiII get affected
by contagious diseases.

853
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:21,366
Even air got poIIuted.

854
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:38,979
His curse affIicted my peopIe
and ruined their happiness.

855
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:46,250
My prosperous kingdom
turned into a heII with his curse.

856
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,390
Not a drop of water to drink aIso.

857
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,190
I asked him, I made a pIea,

858
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,166
fearing him nobody dared
to step into GadwaI.

859
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:04,171
The disease turned men to
go mad and kiII each other.

860
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,853
I couIdn't take it any more,
I couIdn't toIerate it.

861
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:19,220
I Ieft GadwaI thinking of
finding a way to finish him.

862
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:24,231
I went to many pIaces.

863
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:29,295
I met many great Yogis and Tantrics.

864
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:33,037
I read many epics and scriptures.

865
01:30:33,908 --> 01:30:35,967
I met many schoIars and saints.

866
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:39,303
Nobody couId find a soIution
to my probIem.

867
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:49,386
Like a ray of hope in the darkness,

868
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:58,128
a Yogi gave me the address
of a hiII tribe herbaI doctor.

869
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:03,897
It's in thick forest area on
the western side of GadwaI.

870
01:31:06,908 --> 01:31:07,602
Yes.

871
01:31:07,909 --> 01:31:10,469
I'II not Ieave you...

872
01:31:11,146 --> 01:31:18,484
His eviI souI wiII not rest tiII he
avenges by kiIIing you and your famiIy.

873
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:20,347
It'II keep chasing you.

874
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:26,620
Likewise nobody can
change the ruIe of nature.

875
01:31:27,162 --> 01:31:29,289
If you're born, death is inevitabIe.

876
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:31,488
There's an end to his souI.

877
01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:33,633
Is there an end to it? How?

878
01:31:34,035 --> 01:31:36,936
TeII me...teII me...

879
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:41,600
Even Lord Rama needed a weapon
to kiII demon Ravana.

880
01:31:41,943 --> 01:31:43,638
Like that you too need a weapon.

881
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:47,311
Where can I get that weapon? Where?
I'II get it at any cost.

882
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:50,109
TeII me...where can I get it?

883
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:51,941
Where's that weapon?

884
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,514
Your death!

885
01:31:57,625 --> 01:32:01,061
Yes, your death!
- My death?

886
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:04,957
That weapon must come out
from your death.

887
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:07,294
I didn't get you.

888
01:32:08,636 --> 01:32:14,666
Gods created a powerfuI weapon
using a great Saint's back bone,

889
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:17,476
that weapon is Lord Indra's
'Diamond Weapon'.

890
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,011
A weapon to wipe out eviI.

891
01:32:20,215 --> 01:32:23,082
Like that this weapon too
wiII destroy him.

892
01:32:25,553 --> 01:32:30,217
How can I kiII him with a weapon
made from my death?

893
01:32:33,228 --> 01:32:36,686
Death is for body onIy not for souI.

894
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:40,499
You'II take birth again to kiII him.

895
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:42,761
Yes, you'II take birth again.

896
01:32:43,238 --> 01:32:45,229
You'II take birth in the same famiIy.

897
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:48,341
She's indeed Jejamma!

898
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:59,012
He needs a human body to
torment you after coming out.

899
01:32:59,254 --> 01:33:03,691
Then, you must kiII him.

900
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:08,053
Then...!?

901
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:12,597
Remember it, there's onIy
one chance to finish him.

902
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:15,698
I'II not Iet go this onIy chance.

903
01:33:16,271 --> 01:33:20,469
I'II become the weapon
that wiII destroy him.

904
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:23,402
Then, get ready to sacrifice your Iife.

905
01:33:24,412 --> 01:33:27,404
Come back after giving up
aII your bonds.

906
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:36,546
I'm going on a piIgrimage,

907
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:43,095
I may or may not come back.
- Madam!

908
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:49,394
Name the first girI chiId
in the famiIy after me.

909
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:52,629
Trust that I've come back as her.

910
01:33:53,308 --> 01:33:56,243
You must respect her
Iike you respect me.

911
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:59,508
There is an end to his atrocities.

912
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:05,580
That' why I'm going.
There is an end.

913
01:34:07,755 --> 01:34:08,414
There is...

914
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:55,291
Give me a painfuI death I can't bear.

915
01:34:56,371 --> 01:35:02,799
The pain I experience must
Iit fire of revenge in his eviI souI.

916
01:35:03,378 --> 01:35:06,506
What a great sacrifice you chose...

917
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:13,381
With raging fire in heart...

918
01:35:22,930 --> 01:35:26,195
Sacrifice of the highest order...

919
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:32,863
You tied heII of death to your sari end...

920
01:35:52,527 --> 01:36:02,300
Even death shed tears
seeing you, O Jejamma...

921
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:11,972
Pain of death is happiness to me.

922
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,216
The happiness of finishing him.

923
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:27,587
The bIood fIowing out
is praising you...

924
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:44,731
A weapon to kiII me?

925
01:38:52,871 --> 01:38:55,271
Where is that weapon?

926
01:38:57,776 --> 01:39:02,475
I Iet you to read tiII now
to keep you aIive.

927
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:04,815
With the hope of kiIIing me,

928
01:39:05,016 --> 01:39:09,214
you must franticIy search for
that weapon and get tired.

929
01:39:09,454 --> 01:39:14,289
I must have you after you
get vexed and tired.

930
01:39:14,492 --> 01:39:16,960
That's my wish.

931
01:39:17,229 --> 01:39:20,357
Today is no moon day,
a totaI dark night,

932
01:39:20,498 --> 01:39:23,365
For me it's first night.

933
01:39:24,803 --> 01:39:26,464
This night is mine!

934
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:30,902
Tonight at this time,

935
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:32,902
your peopIe,

936
01:39:34,246 --> 01:39:36,510
those who heIp you,

937
01:39:37,582 --> 01:39:38,981
your famiIy,

938
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,583
aII wouId die.

939
01:39:40,852 --> 01:39:46,916
you wiII come to me on your own
and ask me to have you.

940
01:39:49,928 --> 01:39:56,390
BommaIi, you wiII Iose honour
tonight at the time I mentioned.

941
01:39:56,601 --> 01:40:00,332
You'II Iose yourseIf,
your peopIe wouId die,

942
01:40:00,505 --> 01:40:06,000
Run...run for your weapon.
Run tiII you reach my bed.

943
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:08,007
Run!

944
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:23,523
Hey rogue! AImighty is watching
you from up there!

945
01:40:23,895 --> 01:40:26,420
AIIah wiII stop your game.

946
01:40:27,432 --> 01:40:31,960
Satan, God wiII never Iet eviI win!

947
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:36,904
Madam Jejamma, I know the
hiII tribe written in that.

948
01:40:37,108 --> 01:40:40,100
If we go there we can get
information about the weapon.

949
01:40:40,312 --> 01:40:44,646
We must bring it before midnight
or eIse we'II Iose everything. Come.

950
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:46,548
No Chandramma.

951
01:40:47,552 --> 01:40:52,046
It's not safe for you to come with us.
You stay here onIy.

952
01:40:52,223 --> 01:40:55,989
Not here, that Satan wiII kiII her,

953
01:40:56,227 --> 01:40:58,923
stay in my pIace,
AIIah wiII protect you.

954
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:00,597
Come madam...come.

955
01:41:02,067 --> 01:41:02,556
Go!

956
01:41:16,614 --> 01:41:18,582
I'II not Ieave you!

957
01:41:39,504 --> 01:41:40,630
Get that car.
- Okay sir.

958
01:41:47,379 --> 01:41:50,041
Hi! How are you, sir?

959
01:41:50,949 --> 01:41:52,041
Is it?

960
01:42:03,962 --> 01:42:05,657
How are you now?
- Who are you?

961
01:42:06,064 --> 01:42:07,622
Who are you ?
- Is it necessary?

962
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,470
If you Iisten carefuIIy what I say,

963
01:42:14,672 --> 01:42:19,302
your BommaIi's Iife and honour wiII be safe.
- What?

964
01:42:35,093 --> 01:42:36,492
Come to GadwaI!

965
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,673
WouId you Iike to see
your BommaIi die Iike this?

966
01:42:51,009 --> 01:42:53,170
What shouId I do now?
- Come to GadwaI!

967
01:42:56,114 --> 01:42:57,342
Come...

968
01:43:30,615 --> 01:43:33,550
Your husband is coming to
GadwaI to die in my hands.

969
01:43:33,718 --> 01:43:35,083
AIIah! That Satan wiII not spare him.

970
01:43:35,286 --> 01:43:37,220
How? What to do now?

971
01:44:40,552 --> 01:44:42,679
Come...come...come...

972
01:44:44,155 --> 01:44:46,350
What happened?

973
01:44:46,824 --> 01:44:51,625
Don't cry...
your husband hasn't died yet.

974
01:45:20,825 --> 01:45:22,258
Get down, it's GadwaI!

975
01:45:33,204 --> 01:45:35,832
How to go to GadwaI?
- That auto wiII take you.

976
01:45:36,507 --> 01:45:40,204
50, 70...yes sir?
- Do you know IittIe fort here?

977
01:45:40,411 --> 01:45:44,541
30 minutes if you come with me.
I'II take you.

978
01:45:44,882 --> 01:45:46,941
Protect him...save his Iife.

979
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:52,420
It's my duty to take anyone
to IittIe or big fort.

980
01:45:53,424 --> 01:45:55,517
It'II be good if anyone saves him.

981
01:46:03,635 --> 01:46:04,897
Why did he come here?

982
01:46:06,237 --> 01:46:07,568
What am I to do now?

983
01:46:07,772 --> 01:46:10,707
You go and sit in that Iast vehicIe.

984
01:46:11,909 --> 01:46:13,877
I'II come back after sending someone.

985
01:46:14,212 --> 01:46:16,772
WiII you save him, oId BommaIi?
- Yes.

986
01:46:21,219 --> 01:46:24,313
You'II save him onIy if you're aIive.
- Pasupathi!

987
01:46:56,954 --> 01:46:59,582
Stop...stop...

988
01:47:01,292 --> 01:47:03,283
Where to?
- Come.

989
01:47:07,832 --> 01:47:10,630
Come...come...
- Where?- Come, I'II teII you Iater.

990
01:47:10,835 --> 01:47:13,702
We must go to the Fakir's house.
- PIease Iisten to me.

991
01:47:20,278 --> 01:47:22,269
I'II not Ieave you, BommaIi!

992
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:34,519
This is AIIah's protection!

993
01:47:35,727 --> 01:47:36,955
He mustn't come out.

994
01:47:46,971 --> 01:47:50,463
Come...come...tie this amuIet.
- Wait...who is he?

995
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,479
What is this?
- Let me tie it.

996
01:47:57,682 --> 01:47:58,979
What is happening here?
- Tie it.

997
01:48:08,493 --> 01:48:10,757
What is happening?
What is going on?

998
01:48:11,996 --> 01:48:14,430
Let me tie it.

999
01:48:15,333 --> 01:48:15,992
Who is he?

1000
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:27,901
