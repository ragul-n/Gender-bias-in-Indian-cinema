1
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,713
It's raining, lakshmi.
Keep the certificates safe.

2
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,283
It's midnight now.
We can't get autos also.

3
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,786
Let's spend the night somewhere
and go in the morning.

4
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,226
You didn't have lunch.
I'll get you something to eat.

5
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,960
What would you get at this hour?

6
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,298
I may get bread & biscuit
from any tea shop.

7
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,805
I'll get it. Lock the door.

8
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:33,476
I drea.m.

9
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:41,316
Come on.
- Police... hide or run away.

10
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,431
There is someone in this room too.

11
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,837
Open the door.

12
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,175
I'm not such a kind of girl.
- I hear such stories everyday.

13
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:07,851
Please leave me.
- Get in to the bus.

14
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,688
Lakshmi...

15
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,037
i & my daughter came here to attend
an interview & stayed in a lodge.

16
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,209
I was told that you had
taken away my daughter.

17
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,707
Where is my daughter?

18
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,308
The girl in yellow dress?
- Yes.

19
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,209
I knew it.

20
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,816
Ameerpet abbulu got bail for everyone
and took them with him.

21
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,546
She might be in the 3rd house
in the next street. Go.

22
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,497
I got her just now.
She is new to this.

23
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,226
My boss will teach her everything.

24
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,897
Take this & get her ready.
I'll take her in the morning.

25
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,746
Lakshmi...

26
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,576
where are you my dear?
- Father...

27
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:20,589
i'm here. Don't cry, my dear.
- Who are you?

28
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,086
We are from ananthapur.

29
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,762
She has to attend an interview
tomorrow morning.

30
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,091
So? A man has booked her
for rs. 10000.

31
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,598
We are not such kind of people.
- But we are.

32
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,602
I beg you. Please leave her.
- Take her inside.

33
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,603
Please. I beg you.
- Come here.

34
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,944
Take her away.

35
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,011
Please leave us. I beg you.

36
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,952
Leave them.

37
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,955
Have you come to meet stalin?
- Yes.

38
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,062
He is my son's friend.

39
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,290
We must go to his house tomorrow morning
and then to the interview.

40
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,797
Why didn't you tell me this before?

41
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,133
A little delay could've taken my life.

42
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:15,338
Sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive me sister.

43
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,341
Auto...

44
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
don't tell anything to stalin.

45
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,485
Forgive me. Forgive me sister.

46
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,322
Leave them & collect money from me.
Blow...

47
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:36,430
if you drink, i will kill you.
Go fast.

48
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,603
Thank you sir.

49
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,906
I paid money & booked that girl
and now you say she is gone.

50
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,043
Where is she?

51
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,844
Why haven't you eaten anything?
C'mon eat.

52
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,177
What's time of your interview?

53
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,052
2 pm.

54
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,198
It's her.

55
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,627
Eat. I will wait. Eat well.

56
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,204
Who are you guys?
Why did you come here?

57
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,865
We booked herfor our boss.

58
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,702
Booked her?

59
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,037
We paid advance money too.

60
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,708
Here is rs. 5000.

61
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:22,981
Who should i give it to?

62
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,045
Do you know to whose house
you've come now?

63
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,212
No point in talking to you. Come.

64
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,389
Please leave her.
- Come.

65
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,726
Get lost you old man.
- Stop.

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,727
Narayana, leave her.
You sit in the car.

67
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,739
Stalin lives here.

68
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,737
Even lightning & thunders think
twice before coming here.

69
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,246
If you have guts, and
if you are a real man, take this girl,

70
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,911
try crossing this road. Go.

71
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,414
Go & sit in their car.

72
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,586
I'm stalin's mothertelling you.

73
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,523
Go & sit.

74
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,004
Stalin is bravery...

75
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,511
stalin is war of justice...

76
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:55,017
stalin is courage...

77
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,127
did you get hurt?
- No.

78
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:16,036
Ask this question to those idiots
and not my son.

79
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,709
Thank you very much.
- It's okay.

80
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,003
You don't have to worry. Be brave.
- Okay son.

81
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:25,807
Come, let's go inside.
- Wait. Let me ward of all evil eyes.

82
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:38,587
I drea.m.

83
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:16,864
Fear has fled...

84
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,964
sing & dance...
victory is ours...

85
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,809
have courage...

86
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,645
pack your punch all the power...

87
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:37,649
knock out the evil in one punch...
- come as a soldier...

88
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,485
we, your army salute you.

89
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,321
A soldier is born from men like you.

90
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,327
And i'll be his servant.

91
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,180
Our heart and soul is forthe country...

92
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:14,325
we unite forthe nation
and salute you...

93
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:27,896
i drea.m.

94
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,875
Lord ram's arrow is yourthought...

95
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,881
demon ravana is the evil in you...

96
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,714
lord hanuman is your patience...

97
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,721
your real enemy is your anger...

98
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,788
destroy evil...

99
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,623
have patience & kill your anger...

100
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:58,236
step forward & demolish injustice...

101
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,065
we believe in you & walk in yourfootsteps...

102
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,071
let faith be your weapon...

103
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:17,739
help yourfriends...
and you will be blessed...

104
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:23,813
donate eyes, and live twice...

105
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,986
like our parents who give
us everything...

106
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,820
donate blood, you'll become
like motherto the donor...

107
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,657
walk tall with head held high...

108
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,333
break the back of evil...

109
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,332
where do you get this strength from?

110
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,335
From millions of my friends
sitting before the silver screen...

111
00:15:55,354 --> 00:16:05,320
i drea.m.

112
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,788
I can't see any name called
stalin in this almanac.

113
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,049
What?

114
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:40,187
I can see. But the place & planets
can't see him.

115
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,297
To hell with you and your astrology.

116
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,060
You can't be blamed.
My son's fault.

117
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,896
He agreed to marry
when he was in the army.

118
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,470
He's refusing to marry after coming here.

119
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,800
He has gone to send her off.

120
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:50,804
When he comes home,

121
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,978
tell him that if he doesn't marry,

122
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,908
convince him that his
mother's life is in danger.

123
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,642
I can convince him in no time.
But it would cost you more.

124
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,149
I will give you.

125
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:11,619
I drea.m.

126
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,497
What's all this stuff?
- It's vasantha.

127
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,002
She's good match to you.

128
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,171
Look! - What?

129
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,502
Don't get angry.

130
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,509
If you don't marry soon,
your mother's life is in danger.

131
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,011
And your mothertold me this...

132
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,844
no. Astrology is saying it.
Your horoscope confirms it.

133
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,347
How's my performance?

134
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,518
This astrologer is no ordinary man.

135
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
Whatever he says will surely happen.

136
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,191
You be here. I will get yourfees.

137
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,694
Along with the money,
don't forget otherthings. - I'll not.

138
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,866
She keeps up her word.

139
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,295
No one in my area has the guts
to bring marriage proposals for me.

140
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,473
How could you do that?

141
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm not from this area.

142
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:57,873
Getting smart with me?

143
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,476
No. -why?

144
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,541
I can't breathe.

145
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,213
What will happen?
- I may die.

146
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,209
If you don't stop this now,
it will happen for sure.

147
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,213
No one in this world can ever stop me.

148
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
No one can stop me...
may be you can.

149
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,056
I don't think you will give me
that opportunity.

150
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,160
You will stop yourself.

151
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,227
Where are you going?

152
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,063
Tell me what you're thinking about.
I'm really tensed.

153
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,308
Why did you mask herface?

154
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,242
My mother did it.

155
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,509
Why did she mask herface?
Remove it.

156
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,246
If you have the guts, remove it.

157
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,589
Do i need guts to remove it, ah?

158
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,590
Mother, he is removing the mask.

159
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,098
Priest!

160
00:18:54,066 --> 00:19:00,767
I don't want to see herface.
- He has pasted it.

161
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,273
How dare you mask my face
instead of hers'?

162
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,775
I will kill you.
I will hack you to death.

163
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,541
Enough mother. Don't get tensed.

164
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,018
Actually i've a weakness.

165
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,881
If i don't clear my doubts immediately,

166
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,114
my head will break into pieces.

167
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:19,949
Die then.

168
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,785
My head will break into pieces.
Tell me who she is.

169
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:29,056
I won't tell you that
she is my daughter.

170
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,637
She is not my daughter.

171
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,634
Arrest him first.

172
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,305
Stop it mother.

173
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,633
What are you thinking?
Arrest him.

174
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,072
They fell in love & married.

175
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,971
It's betteryou bless them.

176
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,148
Why should i bless them?
Shut up.

177
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,650
You stupid girl!

178
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,987
If you marry him,
you can only do bhangra dance.

179
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,749
Stop blabbering.
- Cool down jhansi.

180
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,426
Will you send her out,
or should i handle the situation?

181
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,994
What will you do? Beat me?

182
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,827
I fed you with so much love
that you've grown so fat.

183
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,495
What will you do?
- Listen to me.

184
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,005
Beat me.
- Lets go home.

185
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,008
She is very arrogant.

186
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,177
Where did he go?

187
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
What are you doing there?

188
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,343
Be careful.

189
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,348
I warned them. Let's go.

190
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,521
How dare she...! Falling in love!

191
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,520
You have hurt me so much that
you will never live happily.

192
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,852
Mother, please come.
- I must kill them both.

193
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,029
Mother please...

194
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,025
oh my god! Such a big story!

195
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,359
If you could name your son as stalin,
a foreigner's name,

196
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,799
can't you accept your son-in-law
from a neighbouring state?

197
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,033
It was my husband who named
him as stalin.

198
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
Communist leader.

199
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,378
Is yours a communist family?

200
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,877
I didn't know that yourfamily
is so powerful.

201
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,107
Now that you know,
do not enter our house again.

202
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,988
You got me into this matter and
made your mother scold me.

203
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,724
I'm a brahmin.
I've mole on my tongue.

204
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,392
Whatever i say will happen.

205
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,890
You'll get a daughter-in-law
who will grind you.

206
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:50,398
I drea.m.

207
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,951
Hi mummy!

208
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,295
Why is your hair wet?

209
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,794
I stood first in the swimming competition.

210
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,968
No one can defeat you.

211
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,468
Forgot me? Mummy, look at my cup.

212
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,801
Idiot! In which shop did you buy this?

213
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,141
The shop next to the shop
where you bought this.

214
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:26,970
Cool down.

215
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,303
I stood first in the dance competition.

216
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,143
None of my achievements are
recognized in this house.

217
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,051
I will go to jhansi sister's house.

218
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,321
Hi little rat!

219
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,824
How many times to tell you that
my name is harbajan singh?

220
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,825
Call me harbajan singh.

221
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,158
But i will call you little rat.

222
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,164
What is that cup for?

223
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,999
I stood first in the swimming competition.

224
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,831
Really? Congratulations.

225
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,675
I wanted to ask you something
for a very long time.

226
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,177
Who is the lady in that photo?

227
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,175
Mind your work.

228
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,342
Jhansi, where are my car keys?

229
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,520
I kept it on the draw.
- Okay listen...

230
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,859
who is this boy?

231
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,923
Him? Just touch him.

232
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,031
Most powerful.

233
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,864
Touch him & you will get electrocuted.

234
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,543
Greetings madam.
- Greetings.

235
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:40,710
Come madam.

236
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,381
Greetings madam.
- Greetings madam.

237
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,383
You can check.
- Okay madam

238
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,499
what is he doing in a women's college?

239
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,665
Look who is sitting next to him.

240
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,416
She used to top the class.

241
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,649
But lost both her hands
in an accident.

242
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:20,416
Since then, he is writing
her exams as she tells.

243
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,850
Look there madam.

244
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,188
Not only her, he writes for
that blind girl too.

245
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,434
What if both have exams on the same day?

246
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,603
It never happened like that till now.

247
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,451
Sirisha, give me that paper.

248
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,461
Give it to him after he completes
writing the exam.

249
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,561
What should i tell him?

250
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,631
Tell him that his sister gave it.

251
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,900
Chitra, pick up the phone.

252
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,807
Mummy, this is harbajan speaking.

253
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,815
This phone is temporarily not working.

254
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,654
Shit! She's a headache to me always.

255
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,480
What?

256
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,923
There is a devil named chitra
living in our next house.

257
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
But she always stays in our house.

258
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,054
She is arrogant.

259
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,262
Always teases me calling me little rat.

260
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,664
Why little rat?
- It's a big flash back.

261
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,998
Flash back at this young age...?

262
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,675
One day, i was in the
shower & she came.

263
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,501
Then?

264
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,940
Opened the door all of a sudden.
- Then?

265
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,180
And saw it.

266
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,511
Ever since then, she calls me little rat.

267
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,751
I don't know why she is
calling me like that.

268
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,352
I'm not that matured.

269
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,946
I've understood.

270
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,690
Little rat is nothing but...

271
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,694
leave your problem to me.
I will handle it.

272
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,526
What's her name?

273
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,702
Chitra. Teach her a lesson.
- Keep watching.

274
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,372
I'm jhansi's brother speaking.
Will you please call my sister?

275
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,206
Who is that?

276
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:24,971
Your brother.

277
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,283
Tell that i will call him back in 10 minutes.

278
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,221
She will call you back in 10 minutes.

279
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,116
Who are you?

280
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,893
I'm chitra, your sister's friend.

281
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,387
Hello chitra aunt.

282
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,397
When did you come from dubai?

283
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,057
How are your children?

284
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,571
Just because i'm your sister's friend,
it doesn't mean i'm of her age.

285
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,400
Trying to know how i will look like?

286
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,669
I know, aunt.

287
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,745
You are black, short, fat...
- shit!

288
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,582
Elderly people call me
goddess mahalakshmi.

289
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,017
Young men call me superfigure.

290
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,584
What do road romeos call you?
A nice chic?

291
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,701
Okay. Let's not fight anymore.

292
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,436
Since you're my sister's friend,
you're my friend too.

293
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,933
Shall we play a game?
- Game?

294
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,937
Game of color astrology.

295
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,433
What does that mean?

296
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,607
I will tell you the color of your dress.

297
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,611
If i am right, friendship will
bloom between us.

298
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:40,113
Can't tell you where it might go in future?

299
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,522
We must become friends first.

300
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,361
Tell me the color of my dress.

301
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,408
No. I'm wearing red color dress.

302
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,813
Look again.

303
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,485
Your dress is yellow.

304
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,984
Bangles & ear rings are also yellow.

305
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,489
To make it more clear,

306
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:23,999
from top to bottom, even your
inner wear is yellow. Am i right?

307
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,331
No. Nothing matched.

308
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,668
She will never interfere in
your matter again.

309
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:41,844
What do you want?

310
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,418
Daddy!
- What do you want i say?

311
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,179
I want to go to toilet.

312
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,855
If i take you there,
girls will think that i'm married.

313
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,527
It might mar my image.

314
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,021
Come, i'll take you dear.

315
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,878
If you don't mind,
will you take herto the toilet?

316
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,455
Aunt, same pinch.

317
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,215
What for?

318
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,894
We both are wearing the
same coloured panty.

319
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,698
Thank you.

320
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,899
Aunt... same pinch.

321
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,576
What forthat?

322
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:49,083
She said it because we both are girls.
- No.

323
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,915
We both are wearing the
same coloured panty.

324
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,425
Thank you.

325
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,574
Sumathi, who are you waiting for?

326
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,174
Do you also have exam today?
- Yes sir.

327
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,975
Same time.
- Yes.

328
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,680
She has chemistry practical.
How can i write your exam?

329
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,576
I know that.

330
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,410
That's why i've asked
my uncle to come here.

331
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,745
Swati's practical exam is more important.

332
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,421
You must be with her.

333
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,591
Okay & good luck.

334
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,360
Sumathi, phone foryou.

335
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,095
What are you saying?

336
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,839
I met with an accident while coming.

337
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,770
I can't come forthe exam.

338
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,103
This is my public exam, uncle.

339
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,941
Talk to principal & arrange someone
to write the exam foryou.

340
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,107
Okay.

341
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,122
Where are you going?
- I want to meet him.

342
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,795
Exam is going on.
You can't go inside.

343
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,294
It's about my life.
- No way.

344
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,965
Please sir.
- No way.

345
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,967
Only 5 more minutes
left forthe exams to start.

346
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:14,968
I'm helpless.

347
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,141
College staff is not allowed
to write the exam.

348
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:17,965
Do one thing.

349
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,736
Seek external help.
I will permit you.

350
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm doing my inter 2nd year
in this college.

351
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,890
Today is my public exam.
Spend 3 hours & write my exam.

352
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:36,992
Do you think i don't have any work?

353
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,492
I'm already late to office. Go.

354
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:39,891
Atleast you help me sir.

355
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,828
Why are you irritating?
Are we here to write your exams?

356
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,002
Go and find someone else.

357
00:31:55,046 --> 00:32:05,012
I drea.m.

358
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,075
Sorry sumathi. I can't help you.

359
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,965
By looking at the analysis,
you'll get full marks.

360
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,133
Excuse me for a minute.

361
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,719
She is a clever student.

362
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,322
She used to score 900/0.

363
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,992
She jumped infront of my eyes.

364
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,390
She begged so many people.
But no one came forward to help her.

365
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,121
That's why she committed suicide.

366
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,401
Any love failure?

367
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,063
It must be love failure.
She is a college student, isn't she?

368
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:48,843
Does it look like a love affair?
Rascal!

369
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,743
She begged so many people
to write the exam.

370
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,248
But no one came forward.

371
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,477
But now passing sarcastic comments!

372
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,015
How could you say that?

373
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,922
Go to office at 9 am and
come home at 6 pm

374
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:02,922
and get glued to the tv.

375
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,254
You're only concerned
about yourfamily.

376
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,761
You neverthink about others.

377
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,929
You won't find time to help others.

378
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,592
But you will find time
to watch such things.

379
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,938
Shame on your part!

380
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,874
Though she lost her both
hands in an accident,

381
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,271
she never committed suicide.

382
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,544
Do you know why?

383
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,271
She believed that people
around will help her.

384
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,947
But today, we broke her
trust & killed her.

385
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,880
We all killed her.

386
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,124
What happened?

387
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,477
100 meters race for physically
challenged children is about to start.

388
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,144
Give them a big hand and
encourage these children.

389
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,060
You will get drenched in the rain.

390
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,062
You be here. I will be back soon.

391
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,813
Make it fast. My baby is in the car.
- Okay madam.

392
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,318
Take the auto... move.

393
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,662
Tow this carto the police station.

394
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,333
Where is my car?

395
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,842
Where is my baby?

396
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,343
Where is my car?

397
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,176
Traffic police towed your car away.

398
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,521
My baby was in the car which
you towed from the big bazaar.

399
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:29,192
Baby in the car?

400
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,361
Your car is overthere.
- Lets go. - come.

401
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,692
My baby... my car.
That's my car.

402
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,200
My baby. Open it fast.

403
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:40,870
Take this.

404
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:55,044
My baby is missing.
Where is my baby?

405
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,048
Get lost.
- What happened?

406
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,281
I feel very shy.
- Why do you feel shy?

407
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,227
I saw aishwarya rai in
my dream last night...

408
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,391
dream...?

409
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,057
She garlanded me.
- Think again

410
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,461
were you standing or lying down
with a lamp behind your head.

411
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,897
You always tease me.
He is teasing me, brother.

412
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,067
Still thinking about those school children?

413
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:24,637
Those children wanted to help each other.
That's a great thing.

414
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,908
They have no choice.
They must help each other.

415
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,084
They are physically challenged children.

416
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,313
They are not handicapped.

417
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,982
People with good health & who don't help
others are the real handicapped.

418
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,590
The girl begged many
to write her exam.

419
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,758
No one came forward.
- Forget it.

420
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,265
People don't think of helping others.

421
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,603
People do think of helping others
but problem they neverfollow it.

422
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:55,273
We must make people each other.
- Yes, you're right.

423
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,710
Have you helped anyone before?

424
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,607
Actually...

425
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,616
fine. How many people
can you help in future?

426
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:08,282
50 to 150 people.
- No need.

427
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,887
Just help 3 people.
We can change the world.

428
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:18,123
Oh really! How is that possible?

429
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,634
It is possible.

430
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:25,871
That's me.

431
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,812
I will help 3 people.

432
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:40,316
And i'll ask each one of them to
help 3 more as thanks to me.

433
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:47,828
As this chain grows,
everyone will try to help 3 people.

434
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,338
When we help a stranger,

435
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,475
he will also be inspired
to help another stranger.

436
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,838
It isn't god who helps us.

437
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,109
People must help each other.

438
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,010
God never invented current or bulb.

439
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,012
It was the man who invented
everything in this world.

440
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,684
I believe in nothing is impossible.

441
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,355
Whose baby is that?

442
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,360
We both went to big bazaaryesterday.

443
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:59,593
I drea.m.

444
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,411
I gave the car number in the
rto office to know the address.

445
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,742
I may get a phone call at anytime.

446
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,410
From rto office.

447
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,585
Yes.

448
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,416
Address...?

449
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,929
Where is the address?
- Kukatpalli.

450
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:32,098
Let us start our helping
concept with this baby.

451
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,452
Don't cry baby.

452
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:02,120
Mother, we have got back our baby.

453
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,877
This baby was born after
7 years of marriage.

454
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,981
If anything had happened to her,
we would've all died.

455
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,085
Your help can't be repaid
with just a thanks.

456
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,487
But still i must thank you forthe help.

457
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,425
Mere thanks alone will not do.

458
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,655
What do you want, tell me?

459
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,660
There are many people around us
who need help from others.

460
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,564
Help 3 people.

461
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:45,104
And tell each one of them
to help 3 more.

462
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,672
That's all.

463
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,345
A very noble thought.
He will surely help.

464
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,181
I will do it.
- Nice meeting you.

465
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,350
Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:00,455
They are so happy that i think
your dream will certainly come true.

467
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,530
Look at this girl.

468
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,257
She is maheshwari.

469
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:14,359
She stood 2nd in weightlifting
by lifting 200 kgs.

470
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,869
We don't want her even
if she had won 1st prize.

471
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:20,870
I can't find a perfect bride
foryour son.

472
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,373
We must call the lord brahma,
the creatorto send a perfect girl.

473
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,472
Find a suitable girl for my son.

474
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,475
For his style...

475
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:37,891
find a girl like her.
Your photos are useless.

476
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,793
Wait. I will bring you a coffee.

477
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,382
I don't know if you can
find a perfect bride or not.

478
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:07,583
But i'm tired of serving you coffees.
- I can drink coffee at anytime.

479
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,851
Look at her.
She looks very beautiful.

480
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,663
Your son is her perfect match.

481
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,592
She has even put an ad
seeking groom. Take a look.

482
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,764
I want a bride like her.

483
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,875
Imagine your son with that girl...

484
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,281
stop it. Back to 1955.

485
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,620
Imagine about them in the latest trend.

486
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:59,999
I drea.m.

487
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,142
He must be a slave to me...

488
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,156
your desires are outrageous...

489
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,087
all your imaginations will go kaput...

490
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,494
look at my shaking a leg...

491
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,826
look at my style...

492
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,562
give me a vent to release
my hot passions...

493
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,799
if you need it, i'll do it...

494
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:36,911
if youryouth wants to fight me,
i'm ready to take on you...

495
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,348
you wanna my love,
come to me...

496
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:45,351
no need to ask me,
start off instantly...

497
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,724
i want you, take me into
the bliss of darkness...

498
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,056
i'm waiting foryour move...

499
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:18,211
i drea.m.

500
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:35,060
You're making inviting gestures
and raking up passions in me...

501
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:43,509
if you make the move,
it's tiresome to me...

502
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,414
you're ravishing...
you're delicious...

503
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:52,083
i'll fulfill all your desires...

504
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,748
don't rush into it,
it'll dampen the spirit...

505
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,757
let's enjoy life in high spirits...

506
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:05,094
i'll tame your wild dreams...

507
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:09,261
if i lose myself in your beauty,
i'll fight out to freedom...

508
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:56,409
i drea.m.

509
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:15,100
You don't have the courage to
cross the borders of decency...

510
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,846
i'm ready to jump fence
if you make the first move...

511
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,877
don't tempt me and
ignite my passions...

512
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:33,022
if i fall to temptation,
you're finished...

513
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:41,197
don't throw tantrums,
i've seen many like you...

514
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:45,401
if you give your lips,
i'll put my stamp of love on it...

515
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,538
if you still want,
i'll caress you with my love...

516
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:17,063
hey you... why are you dancing?

517
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,632
She is the perfect match to my son.

518
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,826
I will get your commission.
- Okay madam.

519
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,835
Thank god! I found a girl
after a long time.

520
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,243
What is it? Back again?
- Just came to meet her.

521
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,246
Hey gopi, take a look at
your sister-in-law's photo.

522
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,750
Where is it? Show it to him.
Take your hand.

523
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,251
She is the perfect bride to my son.

524
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,423
She's very beautiful.

525
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,092
Sister-in-law! Let me also see her.

526
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,427
Is she my sister-in-law?

527
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,834
Just a minute.

528
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,200
Look at this now.
She is with someone else.

529
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,600
It means she is already married.

530
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:05,270
How dare you chose
a married woman to my son?

531
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,449
I will...

532
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,618
where did he go?

533
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,446
Along with him,
he took away your money too.

534
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,625
Stop crying, sirisha.
Stop crying like a child.

535
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,127
What happened?

536
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,963
Wait for me. I will come.

537
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,140
Why is she crying?

538
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,468
That's her personal matter.
You go.

539
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,578
I said go.

540
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,043
Stop crying.

541
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,146
Did he tell his name?
- No.

542
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:46,146
Like everyday, he calls on
phone and speaks filthy.

543
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,154
He wrote my phone number
in the public toilet,

544
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,153
with a caption "call this number
for call girls".

545
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,988
We love each other.

546
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,322
We convinced our parents & have
arranged the marriage too.

547
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,000
If my parents come to know about this,

548
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,498
our marriage may get cancelled.

549
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,330
Why did you come here?

550
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,164
I told you to stay downstairs.

551
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:07,173
Looks like i must settle this matter.
Tell me.

552
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,510
He tells correctly even the moles on my body.

553
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:15,008
Not only that, he insists on
spending a night with him.

554
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,116
It is him.

555
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,179
Speak.

556
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,682
Don't get scared. Speak.

557
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,700
It's him again.
Speaking badly.

558
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,041
Keep talking.
Do not cut the phone at any cost.

559
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,543
Who are you?
What do you want?

560
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,210
Yes brother.

561
00:54:54,457 --> 00:55:04,423
I drea.m.

562
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:06,899
What have you decided?

563
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,131
Who are you?

564
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,010
It's your brother...

565
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,342
your problem is solved now.

566
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,263
He is ourfamily doctor.
- A doctor?

567
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,272
Doctor! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

568
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,945
When your patient is unconscious,

569
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,546
you must check her heart beat
and the pulse rate.

570
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,616
Not the moles on her body.

571
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,849
If i don't get your doctor's license
cancelled in 24 hours,

572
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,048
i will slit yourthroat.

573
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,121
You don't have to worry anymore.
Be happy.

574
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,869
I was tensed of losing my love.

575
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,464
But you helped me at the right time.

576
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,799
I don't know how to thank you.
- That's okay.

577
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,645
What did you say now?
- I said thanks.

578
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,074
I don't need yourthanks.

579
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:33,478
Help 3 people & ask each one
of them to help 3 more.

580
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,825
That's enough.
- Sure sir.

581
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,836
Stalin, your sister will come in 10 minutes.

582
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,008
Come & sit in our house.

583
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,338
It's okay. Please come in.

584
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,673
Please sit. I will get you a coffee.
- Okay.

585
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:09,448
I drea.m.

586
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,022
Switch to v channel.

587
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,695
I said switch to v channel.

588
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:28,702
Move.

589
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,282
Switch to mtv.

590
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,282
Increase the volume.

591
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,393
Where are you going?

592
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,576
Why are you covering it?
What's your problem.

593
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:01,801
Why are you so jealous?

594
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,748
Sister...

595
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,345
enjoying music?
- Yeah.

596
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,418
Open your eyes & see.
You will enjoy it more.

597
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,523
What more will i enjoy?

598
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:28,601
She is mad.

599
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,103
Why are you laughing?

600
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:34,374
Give it to me.

601
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:43,277
You... in the theatre...

602
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:48,389
yes. Theatre... the little girl... same pinch.

603
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,552
So, it is your house, ah?

604
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:52,791
Do you know what really had happened?

605
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,388
Why are you asking my brotherto shut up?

606
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,134
Have you met before?

607
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,461
We met in the theatre... a little girl...
- what happened?

608
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,507
A little girl wanted to go to the toilet...
- is it very important?

609
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,644
Go inside.

610
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:14,310
So, it was you the color astrologist!

611
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:15,648
Bye chitra.

612
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:16,978
Leaving so soon.

613
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,313
It's time my son returns
from school. Bye.

614
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,421
Jhansi, what is your brother doing?

615
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:25,820
He was in the army.

616
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,322
Is he not in the army now?
- No

617
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,829
may be he got scared & left!

618
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,504
How could you say that?
- I was just joking.

619
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,179
What would they think about you?

620
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,009
I was just joking.
- Apologize to them.

621
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:06,527
I'm sorry, sister.

622
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,703
I didn't mean it. I was just joking.

623
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,040
I'm really sorry.

624
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,704
This was the first time
i am seeing you so angry.

625
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,614
What was he in the army?

626
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,115
Do you know who he is?

627
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,478
Indian army major.

628
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,613
Major stalin.

629
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,089
Sir, stalin reporting.
- What happened?

630
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,595
They suddenly attacked us.

631
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:17,671
I take charge.

632
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,808
Major stalin moving, sir.

633
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,774
Stop this damn it.
- Listen to me.

634
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,445
We've to stop this.
- No sir.

635
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,239
We cannot go.
- Do not stop this, sir.

636
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,076
They are in an advantage position.

637
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,013
We can't lose any more of our soldiers.

638
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,017
I won't make their sacrifices go futile.

639
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,713
Their sacrifices shouldn't go waste.

640
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,914
I'm very sorry, sir.
- Stalin...

641
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,004
what do you mean by this?

642
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:08,173
Yes, i gave this order purposefully

643
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,879
what was my fault?

644
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,439
Why have you put me in charge
of administrative department?

645
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,273
What will i do there?

646
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:19,014
For insubordination,

647
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,815
i've taken this decision.

648
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:21,489
That's all.

649
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,157
Sorry sir.

650
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,593
If stalin hadn't taken such
a decision that day,

651
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,385
the situation would've
been different.

652
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,826
You're jealous of stalin
and his popularity.

653
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,692
Mind your language, captain.
- Sorry sir.

654
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:37,061
I am ready to sacrifice
my life forthis nation.

655
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,071
If i don't have that opportunity,
it's betterto quit.

656
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:42,811
Sorry sir.

657
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,993
As you said, my brother didn't
quit army in fear.

658
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:07,966
He resigned.

659
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:13,764
He finds happiness in others'.

660
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:19,277
Even now, he wants everyone
to help one another.

661
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,881
He started the "help 3" movement,

662
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,214
and wants to change this society.

663
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:31,360
He saved two lovers who were
about to commit suicide,

664
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:32,857
and performed their marriage.

665
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,523
When they thanked him,

666
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,090
he refused to accept it.

667
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:43,100
Instead, he asked them to help 3 people
and in turn ask them to help 3 more.

668
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,001
Chitra, now have you understood
what my brother is.

669
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:08,453
I drea.m.

670
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:32,481
O maiden! Are you the reincarnation
of celestial gopika?

671
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,663
O mr. Andhra! Are you the
prince charming to many princesses?

672
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:50,429
I can't refuse your invitation...

673
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:56,170

Understand the relationship
of partnership...

682
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,349
all your dreams will
come true easily...

683
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,048
if you ask for it on your own...

684
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,316
though you deserve it,
you'll be considered cheap...

685
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,760
after meeting in my dream...

686
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:26,596
my youth is rebelling against me
after seeing your manliness...

687
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,934
after seeing you...

688
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,134
i fell in love with you...

689
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,438
i embraced you...

690
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:51,950
i drea.m.

691
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:33,329
Read the signals emitting
from my body desiring you...

692
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:42,139
you'll go crazy after having
the taste of my love...

693
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:46,845
my silk doll!
May i marry you?

694
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,581
May i make my eyes your home?

695
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,853
I desired you...

696
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,281
i came to you...

697
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,518
ljumped the fence...

698
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,345
stop. I will kill you.

699
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,253
Move away.
- What happened?

700
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,980
You move away.
- What happened? Tell me.

701
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,617
He said he didn't have money
to buy bus ticket.

702
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:32,993
I gave him rs. 10.

703
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,253
He went away without saying thanks.

704
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,521
Will you hit him if
he doesn't say thanks, ah?

705
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,530
Hit him.
- I really don't want to hit him.

706
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,434
If he had thanked me,

707
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,171
i would've asked him
to help 3 persons.

708
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,066
But he didn't thank me.

709
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:48,539
If he didn't thank you, it means your
help wasn't thankable.

710
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,445
The other day, that girl's family
thanked him so much.

711
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,909
He never expected it from them.

712
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:54,912
Whateveryou may say,

713
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,913
he is no different from them.

714
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,677
He took money & said nothing.

715
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,049
They took help & thanked you
and would've done nothing.

716
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,317
They wouldn't have helped anyone.

717
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:05,788
What do you want to say?

718
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,859
People are ungrateful.

719
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,726
Do not talk bad about people.

720
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,401
The good work we started
would've taken deep roots.

721
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,867
We too want it to spread
all overthe country.

722
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,873
But i don't trust these people.

723
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:20,767
But i trust them.

724
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,540
Let's meet them right now. Come.

725
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,548
Take your car.

726
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,353
They would come if we
knock the door hard. -who is it?

727
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,714
Greetings.
- Stalin!

728
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:36,852
Are you fine.
- Yes, thank you.

729
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:37,515
Please come inside.

730
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:42,489
What would you like to have?

731
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,426
Nothing.

732
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:44,860
Your son...?

733
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,192
Do you want to talk to my son?

734
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,966
The other day, i told your son
to help 3 people.

735
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,170
I came here to know
who he had helped.

736
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,236
All these days he was busy
getting his passport & visa.

737
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,771
He went to canada just 10 days back.

738
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,172
I'm a software engineer.

739
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,713
I've 6 senior officers supervising me.

740
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,311
200 people work under me.

741
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,586
24 hours work tension.

742
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,145
I can't do social work leaving the job.

743
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,456
I don't have so much leisure time either.

744
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:10,918
Have you helped anyone...?
- Stop asking such stupid questions.

745
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,387
I neither have a good job
nor people work under me.

746
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,761
I'm more worried about
cancellation of honeymoon.

747
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:18,897
And you are talking
about helping others?

748
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:19,859
You are right.

749
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,729
He doesn't even have time to eat.

750
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,137
How could he find time to help others?

751
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,603
If you want any personal help,
i will surely do it.

752
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:27,636
I will give you rs. 5000.

753
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,071
You help someone with that money.

754
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,169
Bye sir.

755
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:43,882
I drea.m.

756
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,197
Don't worry.

757
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,824
It was a good idea.

758
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,434
Tried to implement it.
But failed.

759
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:55,364
That's their ill fate.

760
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,035
What if they don't help?

761
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,607
I will help.
We will do it foryou.

762
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,113
Sir, give me a rupee please.
- Go...

763
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:19,693
i'm very hungry.
Give me a rupee.

764
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,791
Please sir.
- Stop bugging me.

765
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,100
Get up.

766
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,207
You are bleeding.

767
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:40,611
Is it painful?

768
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,518
Get down.
- Who are you?

769
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,127
Get down, you rascal.

770
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,090
How dare you?
- What did i do?

771
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,802
Drinking & driving is wrong.

772
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,801
But begging isn't.

773
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,695
Help if you can.

774
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,501
But you have no right to hurt her.
- Stop it.

775
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,679
Help someone

776
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,175
why do you live a useless life?

777
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:16,050
Rascal.

778
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:17,743
I will kill you.

779
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:18,977
Leave me.

780
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,219
They don't help others.

781
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,958
Such people must be hacked to death.

782
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:36,699
It's him.

783
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,095
Stop brother.

784
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:10,236
Please listen to me.

785
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,269
Leave it.

786
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,065
Do you want me to keep quiet?

787
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:13,899
What else can we do?

788
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,802
You helped 3 people and
expected them to help 3 more.

789
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,304
But all your efforts went in vain.

790
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,347
And now you hit a guy

791
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,241
look at the consequences.

792
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,255
Poison spreads fasterthan medicine.

793
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:30,883
Leave it here.

794
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,086
Yes.

795
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,398
We want your good work to grow.

796
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,631
Let's forget everything.

797
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,495
Let's think that we met
with an accident.

798
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,567
Priya darling, where are you?

799
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,105
It's getting late forthe show.

800
01:15:51,547 --> 01:16:01,513
I drea.m.

801
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,421
Hari, the guy who hit me on that
day is now in hyderabad centre.

802
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,057
Come here in 5 minutes.

803
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,163
I will wait here.
But come in 5 minutes.

804
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,932
Finished?
- He is getting late for his tuition class.

805
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,269
But we haven't got the bill.
- I will drop him.

806
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,978
Please.
- Okay.

807
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,209
Bye.
- Let's go.

808
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:44,031
Where is he?

809
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,097
Can't you come an hour later?
He is gone.

810
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,960
If you had come immediately,
you could've got him.

811
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:50,866
You said he was here with his family.

812
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,305
There they are.

813
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,203
It's very hard to find him in this city.

814
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,504
Instead of we finding him,

815
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,280
i'll make him to find us.
