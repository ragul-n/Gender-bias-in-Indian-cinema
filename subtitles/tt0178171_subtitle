1
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,540
Jhonny?

2
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,980
Shakaal Sir's goods
worth 2 crores....

3
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,780
....from Hongkong....

4
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,380
...is stuck at the dock!

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,380
The stock is stuck?

6
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,280
How is that possible?

7
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,700
The custom officer....

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,380
...who had met him....

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,940
....has been transferred!

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,420
Now we'll have to....

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,340
.....rob the go down at
the dock!

12
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,820
Okay!

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,220
You havent seen anything!

14
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,060
If anyone testifies against us.....

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,820
...he'll be burnt alive!

16
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,180
The way a kite....

17
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,620
...finds its prey....

18
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,940
....in the similar way....

19
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,700
....I find my prey, like robbers,
bandits and thieves!

20
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,460
My name is Prashant!

21
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,620
Who were those
goons?

22
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,220
Describe them!

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,060
So that the police can
trace them!

24
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,860
Why are you all silent?

25
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,580
You tell me!

26
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,860
You say!

27
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,700
Inspector!

28
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,140
How will they say
when they are scared?

29
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,660
You come with me,
I'll tell you.

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,740
Come!

31
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,060
This was your first mistake....

32
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,780
....so I shot your shadows!

33
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,700
Henceforth if the
same mistake is repeated...

34
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,780
...I'll shoot you right down
your chests!

35
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,100
Who is he?

36
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,860
Who has dared to oppose me?

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,060
He has invited death!

38
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,620
He is a coolie!

39
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,740
His name is Prashant!

40
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,500
Prashant!

41
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,860
Hey Ramu..

42
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,220
Ramu...
Brother!

43
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,340
Look at him...

44
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,820
...I am shouting like a
horn....

45
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,380
....and my brother is
busy studying!

46
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,020
Ramu!

47
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,620
Look what have I got for you!

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,660
Fountain nia!

49
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,820
Brother its not fountain-nia,
its called fountain-pen!

50
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,820
No....
Exactly!

51
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,620
Now you'll teach me
english!

52
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,780
Hey Parvati!

53
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,900
Hey Parvati!

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,180
Ramu speaks fluent
English!

55
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
He has become very
intelligent!

56
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,900
I understood!

57
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,980
First tell me where were you
since so long?

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,860
Me?
-Yes!

59
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,380
I...!

60
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,140
I was at the police station!

61
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,380
Why?

62
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,820
The goons who had escaped.....

63
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,260
....they all were caught!

64
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,180
Where can they escape?

65
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,420
If I testify against them
tomorrow in the court...

66
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
...they'll all learn a
lesson!

67
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,020
No you will not testify

68
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,100
I shouldnâ€™t testify...

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,380
...I am the only eye witness!

70
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,940
If I dont everybody will
bailed out!

71
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
I said you wont
testify!

72
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,420
They are goons....

73
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,620
....they are all dangerous!

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,620
Look...

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,980
....there are many snakes
in our village....

76
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,540
...no one leaves staying
in the village with their threat!

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,300
No!

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,460
I am man....

79
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,100
...who can defend the truth
against crime

80
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,820
And till I am alive
I will safeguard it.

81
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,580
Listen!

82
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,820
I bind you with
a promise!

83
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,780
You wont testify
in the court tomorrow!

84
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
And even if you do so...!
Look Parvati...

85
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Ramu is my life and
you are my world...

86
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,460
...I can do anything for
an oath!

87
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,140
Ask for a drop of blood...

88
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,620
... Willingly, I'll give it!

89
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,900
But dont bide me
with promises...

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,620
...but dont make me
feel worthless!

91
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,740
So you are the one....

92
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,740
...who wants to testify
against my men in the court!

93
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,980
Its not a big deal
to raise voice, Sir....

94
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
...if I want...

95
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,060
....I can even raise
their corpse!

96
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,860
But I dont know you!

97
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,420
I am Shakaal.

98
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,940
The one who raises his voice
against us.....

99
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,100
....we forced to make
him silent!

100
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,580
You boast a lot!

101
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,420
I am the one who can
cut the wings...

102
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,820
...of a flying bird and can
silent it!

103
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,980
My name is Prashant!

104
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,100
A child understands fire to be a toy, till
it doesnt burn himself!

105
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,300
Look there!

106
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
Just one gesture...

107
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
....and both are dead!

108
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,700
Scoundrel..!
Shut up.

109
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,580
You'll say...

110
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,940
....what I want in the
court.

111
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,580
Your Honor...

112
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,660
...I came to the city....

113
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,780
....from my village
to be a great man!

114
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,980
But look at my destiny ...

115
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,940
.....I became a coolie!

116
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,780
But I cannot forget
my dream to be a rich man!

117
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,860
So when I got a chance....

118
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,420
...I robbed and was caught!

119
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,700
And out of fear....

120
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,260
....I blamed these God-like people!

121
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,220
But, Your Honor.....

122
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,860
...I accept....

123
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,260
...I am at fault.

124
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,460
And these people are
innocent!

125
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,380
Because Prashant.....

126
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,300
....has confessed his crime....

127
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,940
....Under the Act 276,
he will be imprisoned for 2 years!

128
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,740
My brother is a thief!

129
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
My brother is a thief!

130
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,340
My brother is a thief!

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
My brother is a thief!

132
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,020
My brother is a thief!

133
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,060
Sister in law....

134
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
...why is my brother a thief?

135
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,420
What do you think?

136
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,980
You brother is a thief?

137
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,620
Then why is he
imprisoned?

138
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,460
Why does everyone call
him a thief?

139
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,300
Don't you remember Ramu....

140
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,260
....When they had threatened us....

141
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,820
....at gunpoint, your brother.....

142
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,700
...had accused himself to
save us

143
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,060
Look Ramu....

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,180
Your brother is God like!

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,660
Prashant!

146
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,580
You get food in the jail!

147
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,220
But do you think Ramu and Parvati
would be getting food?

148
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,340
Sister Parvati....

149
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
...you are selling off your
nuptial necklace?

150
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,300
Yes Lala!

151
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,980
I know a married woman's
Nuptial necklace....

152
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,580
....burns with her pyre!

153
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,380
But I am the cursed one....

154
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,180
....who is selling her nuptial necklace
while she is alive!

155
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,380
So that I can make
my husband's dream come true!

156
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,700
Lala..!

157
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,180
He only has one dream...

158
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,900
...her brother Ram...

159
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,180
...educates himself and
becomes a great man!

160
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,140
And today...

161
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,580
....today is his last day
to pay fees in his school!

162
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,580
Okay, Okay!

163
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,420
Take 200 rupees!

164
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,860
Okay Lala!

165
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,060
Here are your fees, pay it!

166
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,420
200 rupees?

167
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,540
Where did you get it from?

168
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,740
Your husband is grinding stones
in the jail...

169
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,660
...and she is getting crushed here
like wheat!

170
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Even she has started stealing!

171
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,180
I request you....

172
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,620
...to return my money back
to me....

173
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,660
....else Ramu will be
removed from school!

174
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,860
Give me.

175
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,500
We wont give you
your money back....

176
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,300
....even if he is killed!

177
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,620
But yes...

178
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,820
If you please me...

179
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,060
...then I can return you your money!

180
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
Leave my hand!

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,900
Come on!

182
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,620
Did you get hurt?

183
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,460
How are you Parvati!

184
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,100
I am fine!

185
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,620
Ram is fine?

186
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,900
Even he is good!

187
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,740
His exam preparations are
going well?

188
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,220
Yes!

189
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,060
Did you pay his fees?

190
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,580
Yes I have paid!

191
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,420
Where did you get money from?

192
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,780
I had some savings...

193
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,460
...and I have even got a job!

194
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,540
Yes Parvati...

195
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,420
I only have one dream....

196
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,420
.....Ram becomes a great man
one day!

197
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,380
Take care of him Parvati!

198
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,940
You mean everything
to him!

199
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,700
Where is your nuptial necklace?

200
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,460
Nuptial necklace

201
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,380
I...!

202
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,420
You sold it?

203
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,540
Had to pay his fees!

204
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Parvati....

205
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,740
....I should have understood
seeing you....

206
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,140
..how difficult it must be
to pass days without me!

207
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,380
Why are you crying Parvati?

208
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,340
Dont cry!

209
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,500
Whatever you've done,....

210
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,020
....was for Munna!

211
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,260
Even after doing all this...

212
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,660
...I was unable to pay his fees!

213
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,860
I couldnt even feed him properly
from last two days!

214
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,100
After selling my nuptial necklace...

215
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,300
....the money that I got....

216
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,420
...those goons seized from me!

217
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,460
The ones who sent you to the jail.

218
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,340
Dont cry Parvati!

219
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,220
The goons who seized your
nuptial necklace from you....

220
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,340
....the ones who have seized my brother's
fees and bread....

221
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,620
...I'll kill those scoundrels!

222
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,700
You?

223
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,220
You were in the jail!

224
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,780
How are you here?

225
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,300
Dont ask me how am I here?

226
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,220
Ask me why am I here?

227
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,660
The husband whose wife's nuptial
necklace is on stake....

228
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,700
....whose younger brother's fees
is seized...

229
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,220
...and when he speaks, he should
be beaten up like a dog!

230
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,180
And when that poor man's
blood boils....

231
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,660
....forget about the jail.....

232
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,500
....nothing can stop him!

233
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,380
You wasted my brother's year!

234
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,180
I will ruin your lives!

235
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,860
I have warned you earlier...

236
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,060
...your second mistake....

237
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,260
....will result to death!

238
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,780
So pick up the gun...

239
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,020
....and shoot yourselves!

240
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,260
Pick up!

241
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,940
Place it on your head...

242
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,620
...and shoot!

243
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,740
I was sure....

244
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,660
...you'll cheat me out of fear.

245
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,740
So your gun had fake bullets in it.

246
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,620
But I have real...

247
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,220
....bullets in my pistol!

248
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,060
I want Prashant dead!

249
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,780
On the spur of the moment....!

250
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,220
Okay!

251
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,980
Whose it?

252
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,500
Parvati, its me!

253
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,140
Open the door!

254
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,300
Quick!

255
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,180
You?

256
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,380
At this time?

257
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,820
You escaped from the jail?

258
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,340
No, No

259
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,420
I am freed from the jail.

260
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,500
But we'll have to leave this
city right now!

261
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,140
Why?
Quick!

262
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,220
Why what happen?

263
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,860
I think you are hiding
something from me!

264
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,380
I'll tell you everything later!

265
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,180
Come on quickly!

266
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,060
So much money?

267
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,060
Where did you get so
much money from?

268
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,660
I have stolen it!

269
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,380
Stolen?

270
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,100
Yes!

271
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,580
I stole it.

272
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,300
Its not a sin to steal it from
a robber!

273
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,540
I went to their place
and stole it.

274
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,260
This was not right...

275
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,740
....you please leave all this....

276
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,380
...all this only leads to ruination!

277
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,260
We are already ruined!

278
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,500
We are already ruined.....

279
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,980
....by walking on paths of truth

280
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,180
Now I'll ruin
the entire world!

281
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,660
You think...

282
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,780
....you'll be able to escape from the jail
and save yourself?

283
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,340
Inspector...

284
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,220
....law is only for us?

285
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,060
Catch them...

286
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,300
...who has committed this
crime!

287
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,540
Leave him!

288
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,500
Come on!
He is innocent!

289
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,220
Leave brother!

290
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,380
He is the one...

291
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,900
.....who is determined to
kill Shakaal!

292
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,980
And now....

293
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,860
....he is imprisoned for
2 years!

294
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,780
At Halipur!

295
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,940
Such a useful man is in the jail?

296
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,700
I want him!

297
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,100
Come Prashant!

298
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,500
He is our boss!

299
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,260
Who has bailed you out!

300
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,620
Greetings Sir.

301
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,340
I can forget your favour
done to me!

302
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
How can I serve you?

303
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,500
Sit in the car.

304
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
I was informed...

305
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,620
....tomorrow at sharp 3....

306
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,260
....on the harbor....

307
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,500
....a man named Kishor....

308
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,500
....is going to deliver gold worth
5 crores!

309
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
And that gold....

310
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,860
.....tomorrow evening
at sharp 5.....

311
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,420
.....Shakaal himself will deliver
it to me!

312
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,220
Shakaal, Prashant here!

313
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,540
I can recognize my enemy's voice!

314
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,220
If you recognize well and good.

315
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,780
Tomorrow at sharp 5....

316
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,620
.....you'll deliver gold worth 5 crores to me
at Ran Valley!

317
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,820
Understood?

318
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,540
I wont present you with gold.....

319
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,500
....but will present you death!

320
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,820
Lets see what is....

321
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,500
....written in either of
our fates....

322
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,820
Tomorrow you'll get
to know!

323
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,100
At sharp 5...!

324
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,260
D'Souza is everything fine?

325
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,340
Give him!

326
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,140
Its 4:45.

327
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,220
And Prashant had threatened you...

328
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,020
....you yourself will deliver
the gold at Ran Valley!

329
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,100
Feels like he is admitted in a
mental hospital

330
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,860
And has not even got cured!

331
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,420
Shakaal.

332
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,620
You'll be surprised on hearing me!

333
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,780
When I laugh hundred other Shakaal's
like you tremble!

334
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,180
Dont stop it.

335
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,300
If you stop the tape...

336
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,540
....you'll hear another blast!

337
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,900
That is going to happen
in 15 minutes!

338
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,860
I have fitted a time bomb
in your car!

339
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,220
Before opening the door
look around you.

340
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,580
Driver, drive faster!

341
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,260
More faster!

342
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,460
More faster!

343
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,340
You'll step from your
pyre when....

344
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
...you'll give me the gold!

345
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,740
I had told you I cut wings
of a flying bird....

346
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,220
....and make it silent.

347
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,700
My name is Prashant!

348
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,260
Today the ball is in your
court Prashant.

349
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,500
But remember...

350
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,860
...but someday the game will change...

351
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,660
...I'll checkmate you!

352
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,980
We villagers dont play chess.

353
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,340
We play 'kabaddi'!

354
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,780
And only those win who
are strong enough!

355
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,220
Whatever you see...

356
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
....is all yours!

357
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,140
All this is mine?

358
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
Its yours!

359
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,180
No!

360
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,340
Its yours!

361
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,540
All this is mine?

362
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,300
Yes!

363
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,740
Now my Parvati....

364
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,420
....will not sleep with
half stomach filled!

365
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,980
Munna's school fees...

366
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,260
....now she wont have
to sell her nuptial necklace!

367
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Munna wont be blamed for
anything.

368
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,820
When Munna will grow
up....

369
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,500
...I'll make him a great man.

370
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,660
I'll make him a great man.

371
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
You stole my mouth organ?

372
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,980
Give it to me!

373
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,380
I was just playing it.

374
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,780
Ask your father to get
one for you, if you are so fond of it!

375
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,140
Neither does he have a mother, nor
a father!

376
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,260
He is an orphan!

377
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Leave him!

378
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,500
Leave him!

379
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,660
Orphan! Orphan!

380
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,820
Orphan! Orphan!

381
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,860
He is not an orphan!

382
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,380
He is my brother!

383
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,700
Dare if anyone tells him anything!

384
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,860
"Ram to Laxman"

385
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,260
"Laxman to Ram"

386
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,420
"We take each other's name"

387
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,860
"One says another listens"

388
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,580
"One says another listens"

389
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,020
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

390
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,700
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

391
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,260
"Ram to Laxman"

392
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
"Laxman to Ram"

393
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020

"One says another listens"

397
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,540
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

398
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,020
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

399
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,620
"If my god asks what gives
me happiness...."

400
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,580
"....in return I ask for your friendship"

401
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,420
"If my god asks what gives
me happiness...."

402
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,220
"....in return I ask for your friendship"

403
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,380
"We know what another's heart
says"

404
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,140
"We know what another's heart
says"

405
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,380
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

406
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,500
"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

407
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,060
"One says another listens"

408
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,860

"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

411
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,580
"We'll give our lives and
take lives..."

412
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,980
"....for our friends"

413
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,980
"Only death can seperate us"

414
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
"We'll give our lives and
take lives..."

415
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,140

"Nanak says both are knowledgeable"

429
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,820
Sir P.K...

430
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,580
...our diamonds worth
2 crores...

431
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,020
....have left from Sea Queen!

432
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,860
I have made arrangements to sell
it in 3 crores!

433
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,620
3 crores is less?

434
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,380
Its very less!

435
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,620
I have made a deal
with Tony in 5 crores!

436
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,420
All the information is in
this envelop!

437
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,620
Here is your payment!

438
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,260
Where are you going?

439
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,180
Why are you suddenly asking
me this question today?

440
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,820
I dont know....

441
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
...I am scared!

442
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,620
No one can do anything
to me in your presence!

443
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,260
Why are you scared?

444
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,620
The thing is....

445
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,380
......the peace we got in our
little house...

446
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,260
....I dont get peace in this
palace!

447
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
We were poor....

448
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,020
....but I was sure.....

449
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,620
....you'll definitely come home
by evening!

450
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,780
But now....

451
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,620
....now when you leave from
home....

452
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,740
Be like what you were!

453
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,860
Look Parvati.....

454
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,260
....when tears drop out
of your eyes....

455
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,500
....they can never go back!

456
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,980
In the same way...

457
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,500
....take me to be the
tear from your eye!

458
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,900
Brother!
Sister in law!

459
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,460
Sister in law!
Brother!

460
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,300
Where are they?
Where are you all?

461
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,260
What is the matter?

462
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,900
You two seem to be
very happy!

463
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,460
Brother and my
sister in law....

464
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,060
...today we are going to give
you good news!

465
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,140
Good news?

466
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,300
What?

467
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,140
Ram passed the business Management exam
with a first class!

468
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,860
Really?

469
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,660
Am I loafer?

470
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,740
My dream is fulfilled today!

471
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,820
And the second thing is....

472
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,900
...Laxman has become
a Sub Inspector!

473
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,580
He'll be on duty from tomorrow!

474
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,220
You have become an officer!

475
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,420
Brother...

476
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,060
...its because of you....

477
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,260
....I have touched skies!

478
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,060
You gave a new life.....

479
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,660
.....to an orphan like me!

480
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,260
Bless me...

481
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,460
...I can arrest all criminals...

482
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,980
...and put them behind bars!

483
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,900
Got the diamonds?

484
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,380
Yes I got!

485
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,260
Prashant Kumar!

486
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Alias P.K!

487
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,460
The chief of Cobra Gang!

488
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,940
Your diamonds worth 5 crores....

489
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,380
....and Tony's goods worth
5 crores....

490
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,140
...is under my feet....

491
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,260
.....in the same way your life....

492
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
.....is under my feet!

493
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,500
P.K is a daredevil...

494
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,340
....and death dances to his tunes!

495
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,700
But at the moment your death....

496
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,500
.....is waiting for one
gesture!

497
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,580
Tell me....

498
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,220
....how many holes do you
want on your body?

499
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,540
The breaking winds dont make
holes on mountains!

500
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,420
Look!

501
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,140
Saw?

502
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,900
Your life is under my feet....

503
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,900
.....but I wont kill you!

504
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,820
After your death you'll get
a chair immediately!

505
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,180
So I'll keep you alive!

506
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,900
So that you always suffer!

507
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,780
He knows everything....

508
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,780
....even walls have ears to hear!

509
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,220
But walls dont have legs!

510
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,660
In a closed room.....

511
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,140
....the discussion we had
of delivering goods to Tony....

512
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,140
....how did Shakaal come to
know about it?

513
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,740
Who is the traitor?

514
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,220
Who has invited problems
for himself!

515
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,540
I know him.

516
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,380
His picture is printed on the
first page of this book!

517
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,900
That will be hanging
on one of the walls of his house!

518
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,460
Before you see him dying...

519
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,300
...I will want....

520
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,580
.....you see his picture!

521
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,100
Open the book.

522
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,980
What happen, Tarun?

523
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,860
Seeing your face brought fears to you?

524
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,020
Please forgive me!

525
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,100
I dint know who was the traitor
till now!

526
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,100
Please have mercy on me!

527
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,820
But now I know, Tarun!

528
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,500
You cheated me.

529
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,620
Please forgive me!
Please have mercy on me!

530
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,060
The way poison is made from
thousands of snakes....

531
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,620
.....is called Prashant!

532
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,620
Cobra Gang Chief!

533
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,580
Cobra!

534
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,340
The important thing about this
function is.....

535
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,420
.....that a card is placed on your tables.

536
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,420
The one who has
King of Spades.....

537
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,380
.....will get a chance to dance...

538
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,260
....with the most beautiful
girl of our club, Miss Rita!

539
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,540
Pick up your card...

540
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,780
....and let us know who
is the lucky one!

541
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,500
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

542
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,140
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

543
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,340
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

544
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,780
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

545
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,980
"If you dont take my heart
away, I'll give it to someone else"

546
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,700
"Till when will I be alone?"

547
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,900
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

548
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,780
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

549
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,580
"Why to come stealthily and silently when
I am sure of coming"

550
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,060
"You have to exchange a heart
for heart"

551
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,220
"Why to come stealthily and silently when
I am sure of coming"

552
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,700
"You have to exchange a heart
for heart"

553
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,860
"What else do I want
except for your approval?"

554
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,780
"Demand what you want
in exchange of my heart"

555
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,740
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

556
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,420
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

557
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,260
"A dream lived in my heart"

558
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,020
"...and my dream boy looked
like you"

559
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,100
"A dream lived in my heart"

560
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,700
"...and my dream girl looked
like you"

561
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,500
"Fair face..."

562
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,940
"...blue eyes"

563
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,740
"They all make a...."

564
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,700
".....great combination"

565
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,260
"Fair face..."

566
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,700
"...blue eyes"

567
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,580
"They all make a...."

568
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,340
".....great combination"

569
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,340
"Demand what you want
in exchange of my heart"

570
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,820
"Demand what you want
in exchange of my heart"

571
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,860
"Heart, heart, heart"

572
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,140
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

573
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,700
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

574
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,380
"It just takes a moment
to fall in love"

575
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,820
"Else it takes ages
to get close"

576
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,980
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

577
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,540
"Else it takes ages
to get close"

578
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,780
"You are the first..."

579
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,820
"...to please my heart"

580
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,500
"And you are the one..."

581
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,620
"...I had to fall
in love with"

582
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,100
"You are the first..."

583
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,700
"...to please my heart"

584
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,340
"And you are the one..."

585
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,180
"...I had to fall
in love with"

586
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,980
"Demand what you want
in exchange of my heart"

587
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,420
"Demand what you want
in exchange of my heart"

588
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,780
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

589
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,260
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

590
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,340
"Why to come stealthily and silently when
I am sure of coming"

591
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,220
"You have to exchange a heart
for heart"

592
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,180
"Stealthily and Secretly,
you come into my heart"

593
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,620
"My heart is for you,
Take it from me"

594
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,380
You are still here?

595
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:30,820
Yes!

596
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,100
I thought of taking
your autograph before going.

597
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,820
Do you know what this is?

598
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,420
A piece of paper!

599
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,300
No!

600
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,980
This paper has become
a part of my life.

601
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,380
This paper has become
a part of my life.

602
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,860
Ram here!

603
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,500
Whose this?

604
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,420
You forgot my name?

605
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:34,900
What is the matter?

606
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,020
From a piece of paper....

607
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,980
....till writing in the skies,
I confessed my love....

608
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,660
....and the one I confessed....

609
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,580
.....I dint have any impact?

610
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,380
Look...

611
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,980
....I am sleepy!

612
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,780
Why?

613
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,740
I am singing Lullabies for you?

614
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,460
After stealing my sleep....

615
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,820
....you want to sleep peacefully!

616
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,820
Anyway you can sleep....

617
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,820
....and crazy people in love
like us keep up all night!

618
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,140
I think she has slept.

619
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,820
Hello!
Whose it?

620
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,300
Its you...!
What happen?

621
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,460
Why are you upset?

622
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,180
All your efforts gone
in vain?

623
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,660
Forget about me...

624
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,780
....even my life is screwed!

625
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,220
But....

626
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:36,940
.....no use!

627
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,420
Friend!

628
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,260
Help me..!

629
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,580
Like how do I coax her?

630
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,460
Not with a spark of love
but sparks of love!

631
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,340
Sparks of love?
Yes!

632
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,860
Yes my friend!

633
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,740
With sparks of love!
Come!

634
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,100
Gentlemen....

635
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,860
....today I'll jump from here!

636
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,220
I'll give up on my life!

637
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,780
I'll die!

638
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,660
You know why?

639
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,380
Why?

640
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,820
That girl, Rita....

641
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,180
...I love her a lot!

642
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:43,140
And if she doesnt accept
my proposal in front of everyone....

643
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,340
....then I'll suicide in front
of the world.

644
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,700
Like this!

645
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,700
He has lost it

646
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,660
Gentlemen, he aint mad!

647
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,620
He is the one of those
who is sacrificing life for his love!

648
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,620
What are you looking at him?

649
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,460
Please stop him.

650
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,980
I stop him?
Why?

651
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,900
Its a lover's funeral, let
it be glorious!

652
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,700
Jokingly, if I'd lost
my balance...!

653
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:17,700
I am saved!

654
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,420
Tell him I love him!

655
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,700
You love him?

656
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,620
Yes!

657
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:30,580
Rita...

658
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,620
....he does this everyday!

659
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,820
Sometimes in this hotel,
sometimes in another hotel!

660
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,860
Every single day, one hotel
is always ready for this scene!

661
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,700
What do you mean?

662
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,660
Meaning...!

663
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,580
Thumps up in a wine bottle....

664
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,780
..mixed with water....

665
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,500
...and this scene is fixed!

666
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,140
Now I understood!

667
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,860
Laxman, My brother!

668
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,220
You are explaining Rita, right?

669
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,260
Yes I have explained her
everything!

670
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,660
But there's a problem!

671
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,220
Problem?

672
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,900
She is saying, not in this birth
but definitely try in next birth!

673
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:05,980
Yes My friend!

674
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,220
Now you can jump.

675
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,340
Your name will be immortal in the book of love till
eternity

676
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,180
Idiot!

677
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,100
Every tall guy thinks
he is Amitab Bacchan!

678
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,860
Laxman you are not Laxman,
but you are my enemy!

679
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,460
You are a true enemy!

680
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,820
I'll see you later on!

681
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,740
Rita....

682
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,620
...I am asking for the last time....

683
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,060
Are you accepting my love?

684
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,900
No!

685
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,660
Okay I am leaving.

686
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,780
In a world where....

687
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,940
....my soul will search for her love!

688
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,220
In her drawing room, in her
bedroom....

689
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,460
...in her bathroom....

690
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,980
...and in her...!
Laxman...

691
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,420
....I'll see you in the bathroom!

692
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,620
Friends!

693
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,660
I'll count 10 till I
commit suicide!

694
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,020
Then dont stop me!

695
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,620
1..

696
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,060
He is playing the mouth piece
and trying to coax me!

697
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,860
2.....

698
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,300
3.....

699
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,420
4.....

700
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,900
5....

701
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,380
6.....

702
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,460
Six and a half!

703
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,540
Stop him

704
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,500
Tell him you love him.
7....

705
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,980
I am Paroo!
Quater past 7...

706
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,380
From Devdas!

707
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,100
Stop him!

708
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,500
Confess!
8....

709
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,420
What the hell?

710
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,540
Quater past 8...!
Ram!

711
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,620
Yes!

712
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,500
I love you.

713
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,540
Really?

714
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,180
Live long.

715
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,260
Suicide cancel.

716
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,660
So Laxman?

717
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,180
Jealous?

718
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,220
Rita darling!

719
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,340
I am coming.

720
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,100
I am coming from
the stairs!

721
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,660
Rita.

722
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,820
You saw...

723
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,500
...my liver...

724
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,660
...not my liver.....

725
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,340
....so I got drunk!

726
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:23,980
And every piece of my broken heart
had one name written on it

727
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,580
Rita!

728
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,340
Rita!
Really?

729
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,620
Yes.

730
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,820
Gorgeous!

731
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,020
You have created her....

732
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,700
....with lots of time in hand!

733
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,300
I am Sapna

734
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,100
I have never seen a beautiful
dream before!

735
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,660
Inspector....

736
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,420
....Last night....

737
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,940
....7 Bangles were stolen
from my house!

738
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,300
You have stolen....

739
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,700
...my heart.

740
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,300
I have come to
file a report.

741
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,140
But where shall
I go to file a case?

742
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,300
What are you thinking?

743
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,540
I was thinking about the thief.

744
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,060
What beautiful colour.

745
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:10,860
Colour?

746
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:11,700
Whose?

747
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,780
Thiefâ€™s!

748
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,580
Thief?

749
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,580
I havent seen him.

750
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,900
What beautiful eyes!

751
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,740
Eyes?

752
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,300
How do I describe his eyes
when I havent seen him!

753
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,140
I thought you would
understand me!

754
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,420
But I think...

755
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,260
....you are purposely
not understanding....

756
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,460
...what I want to explain you!

757
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,340
Understood?

758
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,660
No!

759
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,140
Your address?

760
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:35,740
Gulmohaur....

761
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,980
16 Lake road, Tauliganj!

762
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,620
Your address should be
like....

763
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,900
Queen of Springs....

764
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,380
Love Road, Love city!

765
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:47,540
Okay ,Can I leave?

766
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,220
Take some action....

767
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,460
...just dont leave it!

768
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,500
Greetings!

769
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,420
I'll definitely catch the thief.

770
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,500
Completely lost....

771
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,340
....my friend seems to be!

772
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,900
Expecting waste of time!

773
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,060
Are you seeing a dream?

774
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,380
Sapna?

775
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,900
You know her?

776
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,740
What to say about her!

777
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,820
She had come to file a case...

778
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,860
...but she stole my heart!

779
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,820
Take a pause!

780
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,340
Why did she come here?

781
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,780
Her 7 bangles of gold are stolen!

782
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,860
But instead she stole my heart.

783
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,660
Why are you
getting upset?

784
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,420
Take bangles and go to her place!

785
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,100
You'll get to meet her!

786
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,340
And things will even work!

787
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,340
These bangles are with the thief!

788
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,660
How do I find him
in this big city?

789
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,260
.....and take bangles from him?

790
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,340
It will take a very long time!

791
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,620
Do one thing...

792
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,020
Do one thing....

793
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,980
Buy new ones and gift her!

794
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,220
Very good.

795
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,300
It'll take 10,000 rupees
to buy 7 bangles for her!

796
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,660
Where will I get so
much from?

797
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,220
Brainless creatureâ€¦.

798
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,180
â€¦..Who is asking you
to buy new bangles?

799
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,420
Give silver bangles with gold
coating on it.

800
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,420
What?

801
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,340
What did you say?

802
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,700
Give silver bangles with gold
coating on it.

803
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,740
Now go to her place!

804
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,020
Can I come in?

805
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,940
You?

806
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,420
You have come here
for an enquiry?

807
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,740
No.

808
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,540
I have come to give
you something.

809
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,540
You found my bangles?

810
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:28,980
It was yours...

811
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,700
....but I was worried!

812
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,820
And on one sign....

813
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,140
....the entire police department
swung into action!

814
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,500
And the main police station...

815
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,540
The main police station....

816
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,340
....was soon filled with thieves,
goons and criminals!

817
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,300
And when I appeared
in front of them.....

818
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,780
...everyone was numb.

819
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,860
Everyone spat out
truth!

820
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,540
But the real thief....

821
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,980
....he was not ready
to utter a word!

822
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,340
So I went near him....

823
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,660
...I caught his hand....

824
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,540
.....I looked into his eyes.

825
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,460
Your eyes are so beautiful.

826
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,020
When you look, feels
like...

827
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,340
...you look through me!

828
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,660
Sorry?

829
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,940
So out of my fear...

830
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,780
....he immediately handed over the
bangles to me!

831
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,980
If you wear these bangles....

832
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,460
....you wont loose them!

833
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,780
Your colour is like.....

834
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,500
....a mixture of vermillion
in milk!

835
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,660
Sapna!

836
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,140
My grandmother is calling me!

837
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,380
Why did she have to
call you now?

838
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,420
You come at a later time.

839
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,900
Do come.

840
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,660
Now even if you dont call
I'll definitely come.

841
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,780
Seems very happy!

842
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,620
Greetings!
-Greetings!

843
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,220
I did not recognize you

844
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,380
I am...!

845
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,340
I am Laxman's friend!

846
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:07,700
Ram!

847
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,980
I mean I am talking about
Inspector Laxman.

848
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,500
Is Laxman around?

849
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:12,820
He had come hereâ€¦.

850
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,220
...he just left from here!

851
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,980
You had lost your bangles right?

852
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:20,660
Yes!

853
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,620
But your friend caught the
thief....

854
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,900
...and returned my bangles
back to me!

855
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,060
He is very smart.

856
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,940
He is really smart!

857
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,140
Infact he is very smart!

858
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,580
The entire police department should
be proud to have him.

859
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,380
He has an amazing personality!

860
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,900
After all he is my friend!

861
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,700
He is influenced by me!

862
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,100
My friend is really smart....

863
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,140
...but....

864
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,980
But...?

865
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,140
But what?

866
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,140
You are so innocent
and naive!

867
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,820
He shouldnt have done this
with you!

868
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,260
What?

869
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,580
Nothing like that...

870
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,180
....his heart is clean....

871
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,700
....his heart is clean....

872
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,140
....but when there is a stain
on a clean thing.....

873
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,780
....feels so bad!

874
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,700
Stain, what are you talking?

875
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,220
There is a spot on
the moon too.....

876
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,340
...and what stain....

877
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,940
...its his hobby....

878
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,020
...he can easily
impress girls!

879
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,940
And once a girl is impressed....

880
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,500
....and he is contended....

881
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,340
....he removes her out
from her life....

882
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,500
....like you remove
a fly from milk!

883
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,220
He is a cheat?

884
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:19,900
No!

885
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,300
He is not a cheat.

886
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,420
A coward is a cheat!

887
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,580
And my friend is brave!

888
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,060
Now look...

889
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,620
.....he gifted you silver
bangles

890
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,020
....with gold coating on it.

891
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,540
Very good!
He is amazing

892
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,540
He is a fraud and cheat?

893
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,460
No,No,No!

894
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,500
Its not good to blame
a decent man like him!

895
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,620
Its is not fair.

896
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,180
Look!

897
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,060
He is clean by heart!

898
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,900
He wants to impress you...

899
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,580
...and he has already
impressed you partly....

900
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,460
...but he'll put in more efforts....

901
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,100
...and in this....

902
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,620
....when you'll be impressed....

903
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,820
...that's when you'll
come to know...

904
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,340
....that it was not
a good idea!

905
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,380
Later...

906
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,340
...you'll get a phone call....

907
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,740
...and you'll come to know...

908
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,060
....that Inspector Laxman...

909
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,020
....he is suffering and
is admitted in a hospital....

910
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,460
....like fish without water...

911
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,580
.....light without dance!

912
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,220
I am dead!

913
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,620
I am dead.

914
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,180
I am dead.

915
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:25,940
How are you?

916
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,500
Good you are here.

917
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:28,980
Else?
Else?

918
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
Else I wouldnt be alive!

919
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,220
What happen to you?

920
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,620
Dont ask!

921
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:39,780
Last night, that thief along with
his 10 friends attacked me!

922
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,780
But I dint care...!

923
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,340
I too did not leave them...

924
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,340
...and while shooting...

925
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,220

I am a magician
and not a doctor!

965
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,060

01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,100
Who is the chief of
Cobra Gang?

1110
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,860
I dont know any
such gangs.

1111
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,860
If you dont know

1112
01:16:58,540 --> 01:16:59,220
Tell me who is the
Chief?

1113
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,180
I dont know
anyone.

1114
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,220
I just know
one thing.....

1115
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,820
....tonight at 12, a smuggler named
John.....

1116
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,300
.....is going to meet the Chief
at den!

1117
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:26,860
Mr. John

1118
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,420
....you are under arrest!

1119
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:36,940
Its 12...

1120
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,020
John has still not come.

1121
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,380
John is here!

1122
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,220
Diamonds are in the hat
and handcuffs in my hand!

1123
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,140
If anyone tries to move...

1124
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,860
....I'll shoot him.

1125
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,340
You are trapped!

1126
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,540
Your duty is to arrest
your brother.....

1127
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,780
.....who is a criminal!

1128
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,140
And on other hand.....

1129
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,100
...your brother's favors on you.

1130
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,980
Your debts...

1131
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,340
....is stopping you
to arrest him!

1132
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:49,540
Hello!

1133
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,980
Inspector Laxman....

1134
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:52,900
...this evening at 7.....

1135
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:56,460
....a deal of gold is going to happen
worth 50 lakhs at the old fort!

1136
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,620
Whose this?

1137
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,220
Whose this?

1138
01:19:55,540 --> 01:20:00,740
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1139
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:06,460
"I am crazy for you
my love"

1140
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:12,340
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1141
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:18,060
"I am crazy for you
my love"

1142
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,140
"Youthful night..."

1143
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:24,460
"...where are you lost?"

1144
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,380
"Youthful night..."

1145
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,140
"...where are you lost?"

1146
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,500
"Rakum Rakum aina"

1147
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,460
"Takum Takum jaina"

1148
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,300
"Rakum Rakum aina"

1149
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,180
"Takum Takum jaina"

1150
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:48,100
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1151
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:53,900
"I am crazy for you
my love"

1152
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:12,700
"The aroma of my youth
is like night jasmine"

1153
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:18,660
"Your dream girl is in
front of you"

1154
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,820
"The aroma of my youth
is like night jasmine"

1155
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:33,580
"Your dream girl is in
front of you"

1156
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,460
"You and me"

1157
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,700
"....and the weather outside"

1158
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,340
"Let them meet"

1159
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,860
"Please get convinced"

1160
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,700
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1161
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:03,980
"I am crazy for you
my love"

1162
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:53,300
"My life is nothing without
you"

1163
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:58,940
"Even the water from the
clouds cannot extinguish my fire"

1164
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:08,140
"My life is nothing without
you"

1165
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:13,860
"Even the water from the
clouds cannot extinguish my fire"

1166
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:17,340
"The burning fire"

1167
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,420
"When it will catch you"

1168
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,660
"It will extinguish then"

1169
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:32,140
"Only you belong to me
and not the world"

1170
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:38,060
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1171
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,900
"Youthful night..."

1172
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,420
"...where are you lost?"

1173
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,540
"Youthful night..."

1174
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,100
"...where are you lost?"

1175
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,180
"Rakum Rakum aina"

1176
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,860
"Takum Takum jaina"

1177
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,660
"Rakum Rakum aina"

1178
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,380
"Takum Takum jaina"

1179
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:08,660
"Crazy, Crazy, Crazy"

1180
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:14,180
"I am crazy for you
my love"

1181
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,020
"Come"

1182
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:30,660
"Come"

1183
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,620
"Dont go"

1184
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,420
Why did you leave
from there, all of a sudden.

1185
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:05,860
You are distancing yourself
from me!

1186
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,420
Sapna....

1187
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:10,740
.....I am trapped so
badly....

1188
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,620
...where light.....

1189
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:15,900
.....is also not helping me!

1190
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,060
Reason?

1191
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,180
Cobra Gang.

1192
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:21,700
I am assigned to
catch them!

1193
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,980
No news about them?

1194
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,300
I know everything....

1195
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:29,140
....their meeting places....

1196
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,180
...who is their Chief!

1197
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:34,940
Why dont you arrest them?

1198
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,260
Sapna!
-Yes!

1199
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,700
If a beloved....

1200
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,020
....sees his beloved cheating
on him....

1201
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,500
....the one who
was God for him....

1202
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,860
...how would he feel?

1203
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,180
He'll be really hurt.

1204
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:52,300
What should he do at that time?

1205
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,220
He should forget he
ever loved her!

1206
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,820
And should be punished!

1207
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:58,820
And instead of the
beloved.....

1208
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,220
....would be his own
mother?

1209
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,420
Even you dont have
an answer right?

1210
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,500
A corpse lying at a Crematorium....

1211
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,300
...cannot burn its pyre!

1212
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,700
Sir, Laxman is dangerous for
us....

1213
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,580
.... he can even hang us!

1214
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:34,260
Laxman is my brother!

1215
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,860
He can never be dangerous
for us!

1216
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,980
But since he is a police
officer....

1217
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:40,900
...he can be
dangerous!

1218
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:42,860
But dont forget one thing.....

1219
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,380
....he my brother first.....

1220
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,340
...and then a police officer!

1221
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,700
The law doesnt consider
any relations!

1222
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,460
He is not even your
real brother!

1223
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:53,740
Dont talk nonsense!

1224
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:55,500
What do you want to say?

1225
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:56,620
Just that....

1226
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,180
....you have made the rules
of cobra Gang....

1227
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,660
...and you will
only break it?

1228
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:04,420
What rules?

1229
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:09,780
If any police officer gets any news
about our gang....

1230
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,700
....he should he killed!

1231
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,980
We should kill Laxman!

1232
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:18,740
I make rules!

1233
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,500
Only I have the rights to
break it.

1234
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,780
Remember one thing...

1235
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:29,260
....if you get such ideas...

1236
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,060
....I will be your worst enemy

1237
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,940
I know you hate me!

1238
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:56,020
I wish...

1239
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,660
...I could hate you.

1240
01:27:58,620 --> 01:27:59,380
If not hate....

1241
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:02,380
...but you'll no
longer like me the way you did!

1242
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:03,500
Yes.

1243
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,900
And so I melted...

1244
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:08,500
...inspite of wearing my uniform!

1245
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,940
And I dont want...

1246
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,380
...your uniform to turn into
a shroud for you!

1247
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,380
Some people of my gang
want to kill you!

1248
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:19,340
I dont know who and when
can they do it!

1249
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,020
I suggest...

1250
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,620
.....get transferred somewhere
else!

1251
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,980
And start a new life!

1252
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,060
I have started hating my
life and my existence!

1253
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,820
Let them kill me!

1254
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,940
He has no rights to live...

1255
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:35,940
....who cannot complete his duties...

1256
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,740
....nor can pay his debts!

1257
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:39,300
It was my duty...

1258
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,220
...to serve you!

1259
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,820
And by playing your duties....

1260
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:46,060
...you are stuck in a
quagmire of sin

1261
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,220
Sin-Virtue...

1262
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,180
Good-bad....

1263
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:50,180
...the one holding the scales....

1264
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,580
....has always been unhappy!

1265
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,300
If you also want to judge me...

1266
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,860
...then tie a black
scarf like the goddess of Law

1267
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,940
So that you wont be able
to see a single thing!

1268
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:02,780
Then will you be able
to live a better life!

1269
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,740
Take some money!

1270
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:07,740
Will help you.

1271
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:09,300
You are buying me?

1272
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:10,780
Bribe?

1273
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,540
Sad.

1274
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,660
Prashant Kumar has never
bribed anybody!

1275
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:20,500
He wants to give
a new life to his brother!

1276
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,300
If you want to give me a new life....

1277
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,340
.....you get yourself
arrested!

1278
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,380
Now you are talking like an Inspector!

1279
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,140
So listen...

1280
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:37,340
Prashant Kumar can never
bend in front of law!

1281
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,460
I am a looser!

1282
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,380
And I am not scared of death!

1283
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:45,940
Laxman...

1284
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,820
......dont be stubborn....

1285
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:49,580
...and keep this money!

1286
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,140
Money, Money, Money!

1287
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,980
The money that you have
earned sinfully...

1288
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,620
...will be gunpowder someday!

1289
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,740
And later you'll only
hear blasts!

1290
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:02,380
Take your money.

1291
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,300
I dont want your
money!

1292
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,060
Take it.

1293
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,980
Instead of you if someone
else would have done this...

1294
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,500
....this would have been the
last mistake of his life!

1295
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:25,460
Parvati....

1296
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,060
....you are back?

1297
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,060
What happen?

1298
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:32,060
Laxman has refused to
leave this city!

1299
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,300
He refused?
Why?

1300
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,780
Because he is an officer!

1301
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,260
He has started talking about playing duties,
trust and conscience!

1302
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:46,140
He is paying back my favours
by not arresting me!

1303
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:48,620
Why dint you make him understand?

1304
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,940
I thoroughly
made him understand!

1305
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:51,940
But he dint want to understand!

1306
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:53,820
I even told him.....

1307
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,060
...take this money....

1308
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:56,620
...get transferred!

1309
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,300
He told me....

1310
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,940
...you are trying to bribe me!
Me?

1311
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:04,860
I'll bribe my brother?

1312
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,620
Have I ever differentiated between Ram
and him?

1313
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,740
This is the fruit
of our deeds!

1314
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,300
But Parvati...

1315
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:13,700
...what is all this for?

1316
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,820
Say
For whom?

1317
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,220
Had he seen my poverty...

1318
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,700
....he wouldnt have dared
to talk to me in this way!

1319
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,300
Anyway...

1320
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,900
..he does what he wants!

1321
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,660
I will do my duty!

1322
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,380
I will protect him
from all the dangers!

1323
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:35,900
And I'll call the advocate
tomorrow

1324
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,900
I will transfer my entire...

1325
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,660
....property to Ram!

1326
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,380
Laxman.

1327
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:44,660
Laxman.

1328
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,700
Laxman, where are you?

1329
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:51,100
Laxman.

1330
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,740
Where are you lost?

1331
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,340
Idiot!

1332
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:56,460
What is the matter?

1333
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:57,940
You seem to be very
happy today.

1334
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,420
Not me.

1335
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,260
Call me with respect.

1336
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:04,620
I am not Ram
anymore...

1337
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:07,700
...I am Ram Kumar Sahab!

1338
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,580
Brother has made me a chairman
of each of his companies!

1339
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,060
I am so lucky...

1340
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,020
...I have a brother like him!

1341
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,500
Who was just a coolie...

1342
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,060
...through his hardwork...

1343
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,140
....honesty and truth....

1344
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,620
...has owned a huge empire!

1345
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,140
I havent seen God...

1346
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,780
...but I think he would be my brother!

1347
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,980
Inadvertently, if someone
assumes a person to be his God,....

1348
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,500
....his status doesnt change by that!

1349
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,020
What do you mean?

1350
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,580
What did you mean?

1351
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:46,660
Your brother has not earned through
his hardwork, honesty and truth....

1352
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,820
.....but has murdered many
and has reached here!

1353
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,580
The companies you've become
a chairman of....

1354
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,060
...was founded by taking hundred
innocent lives!

1355
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,060
And that...

1356
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,380
....hardworking coolie....

1357
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:01,700
....is still a coolie....

1358
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:03,940
...but the difference is....

1359
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:07,260
....now he doesnt carry luggage
he carries the burden of sin!

1360
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:09,540
He is not God....

1361
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,180
...he is a smuggler, thief and a murderer!

1362
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,900
You abused the one....

1363
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,140
...who helped you?

1364
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,540
Why dint you turn speechless before
saying this?

1365
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:29,340
Because...

1366
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:33,020
....I dont tremble on speaking
the truth!

1367
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,580
But becomes stronger!

1368
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,460
Ram...

1369
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:40,860
....the help you are talking
about....

1370
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:44,860
....that help has....

1371
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,260
...stopped me from my doing my duties!

1372
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,100
Else...

1373
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,140
....my duty....

1374
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,500
....was to hang him!

1375
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,540
If this is true...

1376
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,260
...my Godlike brother
is a thief....

1377
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:00,580
...is a smuggler....

1378
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,620
...and he is a criminal....

1379
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,900
..I will chop his hands off!

1380
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:12,860
So he cant be a coolie
of these sinful activities!

1381
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,820
And this is a lie Laxman....

1382
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:19,420
.....Ram will be Ravaan for
you!

1383
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:20,900
Remember!

1384
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,700
Ram

1385
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:25,340
What happen?

1386
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,260
What's the matter?

1387
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,500
No, Nothing.

1388
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:29,860
I think you are hiding something from me!

1389
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,660
Tell me what is the matter?

1390
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,100
No!

1391
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,500
I was thinking about my future!

1392
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:36,820
What?

1393
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,940
You are a rich man now....

1394
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,500
....I hope you dont distance
yourself from me!

1395
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:42,860
You wont forget me!

1396
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:45,780
Is it possible?

1397
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,700
You will always stay with me!

1398
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,540
Here in my heart.

1399
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,860
How do I tell you Ram...

1400
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:55,940
.....the truth about Brother!

1401
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,340
You want to resign....

1402
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,660
....this is a pyre.....

1403
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:07,900
....where lies a brave officer's
deadbody!

1404
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:10,180
A police officerâ€¦.

1405
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:11,740
...who had promised himself
to...

1406
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,860
....do his duties when
he becomes an Inspector!

1407
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,300
To do my duty...

1408
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,500
....I can sacrifice every drop of my
blood!

1409
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,220
But....

1410
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:23,540
But I am helpless!

1411
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:24,500
Helpless?

1412
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:25,620
What is it?

1413
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,500
Helplessness shouldn't come the
way of your work

1414
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,380
For the sake of your duty.....

1415
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,540
....a father sacrifices his son!

1416
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:34,220
For the sake of duty....

1417
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,300
.....a wife sacrifices her
husband!

1418
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:37,980
For the sake of duty....

1419
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,740
...a brother can even kill his
brother!

1420
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,900
And such people....

1421
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,100
...become immortal in history!

1422
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,140
Come with me!

1423
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,500
This boy who is locked...

1424
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,900
...his name is Deepak.

1425
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:59,420
He is famous in the world
of smuggling, theft and robbery!

1426
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,540
Today....

1427
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,100
....he is imprisoned here
for years!

1428
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,260
Do you know who is he?

1429
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,100
He is my son.

1430
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,420
You?

1431
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,380
My enemy is here?

1432
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:26,380
In search of death?

1433
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,380
Shakaal, the one who is
in danger....

1434
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,460
....he himself finds
life!

1435
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,940
You are foolish.

1436
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,980
Who has come to a
person who can kill you.

1437
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,820
They are foolish...

1438
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,380
...who doesnt make an enemy's enemy
a friend!

1439
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,380
Meaning?

1440
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:45,820
P.K's brother...

1441
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,220
...Inspector Laxman....

1442
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,860
....wants to hang us!

1443
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:51,540
And P.K....

1444
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,740
Who can sacrifice you
for his brother!

1445
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:56,700
Yes!

1446
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:58,860
Even he is my enemy!

1447
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:05,900
I'lll take a revenge of his slap
by killing him!

1448
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:06,980
Then what are you waiting for?

1449
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:11,460
Shakaal will protect you!

1450
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:12,780
Kill them

1451
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:16,620
You'll not only be saved from
getting hanged...

1452
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,260
....but you'll also be the
Chief of the Cobra Gang!

1453
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,060
Chief?
-Yes!

1454
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,460
Chief of the Cobra Gang!

1455
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,740
This was always a dream!

1456
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,980
But such dreams only come
true after killing many.

1457
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:33,220
Keep the cake here
and flowers there!

1458
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,220
Make it quick.

1459
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,300
All preparations done?

1460
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,820
Everythingâ€™s fine?

1461
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,020
Yes!

1462
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,660
I am thinking on this
auspicious occasion...

1463
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,140
...lets get them engaged!

1464
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:46,300
Very good!

1465
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,340
Nice idea!

1466
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,140
On this occasion...

1467
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,780
....nothing will be a better
gift than this!

1468
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,420
I have got some news...

1469

....Inspector Laxman is coming
to arrest our gang!

1470
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:03,220
And even that...

1471
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:05,620
....some man from our gang.....

1472
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,420
..... is going to kill him
at Diamond Harbour

1473
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,780
I wont let that happen!

1474
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:12,580
I wont let that happen!

1475
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,060
Parvati, you manage!

1476
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:19,980
I am just coming!

1477
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,620
Now reach Diamond Harbour
with my men!

1478
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:36,100
Now Durjan will kill them!

1479
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,540
And I'll kill Durjan

1480
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:39,780
And later....

1481
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,220
...The reigning champ.....

1482
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,660
...I'll be.

1483
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:45,340
I!

1484
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:22,580
Laxman
Brother!

1485
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,180
Laxman!

1486
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,100
Why did you come give up
on your life?

1487
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:27,580
Say!

1488
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:28,460
Why?

1489
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:32,300
Brother, you had told me one day...

1490
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:33,860
...leave the city!

1491
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:38,500
I am leaving this world!

1492
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:41,260
I had not asked you to
leave me for ever!

1493
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,220
You still have to live your life!

1494
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,940
It was good, if I would
have died!

1495
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:48,580
But your death...

1496
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:51,260
Your death is my
loss!

1497
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,180
I can never tolerate this
loss!

1498
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,260
I can never tolerate this
loss!

1499
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:58,460
The day...

1500
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,420
The day you'll leave
doing all this...

1501
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:04,660
...that day I'll
again be alive!

1502
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,260
You gave me one life!

1503
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:11,940
Promise meâ€¦.

1504
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,460
Promise me you'll give
me one more life!

1505
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:15,940
Promise me!

1506
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,580
Promise me!

1507
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:33,060
Take it there!

1508
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:33,780
Sister in law!

1509
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:34,740
What is the time?

1510
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:36,100
Its 7 already!

1511
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,100
Still brother has not
come!

1512
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:38,980
And today even the
inspector is missing!

1513
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,620
So many guests...!

1514
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:57,500
Laxman!

1515
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,500
How did this happen?

1516
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,060
Enemies killed him!

1517
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:29,060
"Will give up on life
will give my life"

1518
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:33,100
"For my friends"

1519
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,660
"Will give up on life
will give my life"

1520
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:49,580
"For my friends"

1521
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:54,260
"Death can separate us"

1522
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:58,260
"Thatâ€™s the only thing"

1523
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,260
"One says it...."

1524
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:07,500
"...and the other agrees"

1525
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,340
My friend...

1526
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:11,740
....where did you leave
me and go?

1527
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:13,140
I have come back...

1528
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:15,620
....promise me....

1529
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,740
....now you wont leave me and
go!

1530
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:38,980
You?

1531
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:40,580
You and here?

1532
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,220
Yes!

1533
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:43,780
I come here everyday!

1534
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:46,700
Where, my life was ruined!!!

1535
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,500
Everything is ruined!

1536
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,540
My life has no meaning left!

1537
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:57,860
I wont spare them!

1538
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:00,860
Those who made you a widow
before getting married!

1539
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:02,380
Do you know them?

1540
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,900
If I would be knowing them...

1541
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:08,300
....I would have killed them!

1542
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,260
Once Laxman had told me
he knows the reality of the Cobra Gang!

1543
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,500
May be...

1544
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:16,100
...the Cobra Gang would have!

1545
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,380
Cobra Gang!

1546
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,580
I know the price
of this picture!

1547
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:43,700
This
-Yes!

1548
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:44,860
How much?

1549
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:45,860
10 crores!

1550
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:47,420
10 crores?

1551
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:48,740
For this picture?

1552
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:52,780
A sword is priced seeing the
sharpness of its edge!

1553
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:55,620
Prashant's brother Ram....

1554
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,740
....is finding his brother Laxman's
murderer!

1555
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,500
When he'll see this
picture...

1556
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:03,540
....he'll pounce on it!

1557
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:09,100
That's the time we'll
ask for a ransom amount!

1558
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,060
10 crores!

1559
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:20,140
Brother!

1560
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,020
He has killed
my friend!

1561
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:24,580
And now...

1562
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:26,260
...I will kill him!

1563
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,620
No Ram No!

1564
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:29,140
You wont do anything of
that sort!

1565
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:32,060
I have swore on Laxman's
dead body!

1566
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,980
I wont spare his murderer!

1567
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:35,180
Ram have you lost it?

1568
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:36,580
Yes I have lost it.

1569
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,780
I have gone crazy thinking
about Laxman!

1570
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,580
And now my madness.....

1571
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,660
....will cool when I see
his death!

1572
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:44,460
No Ram No

1573
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:46,620
I will not let you commit a murder

1574
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,060
Brother!

1575
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,940
I have never refused you
for anything!

1576
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:52,780
But today for the first time...

1577
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,300
....your brother burning in
fury of vengeance.....

1578
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,900
....refuses to listen to you!

1579
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,340
Where are you off
to at this time?

1580
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,580
To kill Laxman's
murderer!

1581
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,820
To kill Laxman's murderer!
-Yes!

1582
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:25,660
One of our man from the Gang
has joined hands with Shakaal...

1583
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:28,100
...has killed Laxman, and
Ram knows about it.

1584
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,380
Since then he is finding
him like a maverick!

1585
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,940
Before Ram kills him...

1586
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,180
...I will kill him.

1587
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,500
I wont let Ram kill him!
No

1588
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:39,460
You have become so tough.

1589
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:42,340
You have killed so many and
still going on...

1590
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:45,740
...I wont let do this
sinful activity anymore!

1591
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,660
I touch your feet!

1592
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,260
Please leave all this!
Parvati...

1593
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:50,500
...dont say this....

1594
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,380
....do not restrict me!

1595
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,860
If I take time to save Ram...

1596
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,340
....Ram will be a criminal!

1597
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:00,060
My life long penance will
be broken!

1598
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:01,660
I want to save Ram!

1599
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,300
Move!

1600
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:11,580
Ram, I know who has
murdered Laxman!

1601
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:12,700
Who is he?

1602
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:13,780
Where is he?

1603
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:14,740
At Hotel Paradise

1604
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,500
Hotel Paradise

1605
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:45,540
"Game is to bet on"

1606
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:46,860
"And I'll bet on it"

1607
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,220
"You are alive once again
in me"

1608
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:54,900
"I'll die"

1609
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:01,220
"I'll kill him"

1610
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,940
"Your enemy, my friend,
my friend"

1611
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:09,900
"I swear by you"

1612
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,020
"I swear by you"

1613
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:17,780
"Game is to bet on"

1614
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,300
"And I'll bet on it"

1615
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:25,460
"You are alive once again
in me"

1616
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,580
"I'll die"

1617
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:33,380
"I'll kill him"

1618
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,620
"Your enemy, my friend,
my friend"

1619
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,420
"My friend"

1620
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,620

"Game is to bet on"

1623
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,660
"And I'll bet on it"

1624
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:34,060
"We still had to...."

1625
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,820
"....see the world"

1626
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:42,060
"You left me alone"

1627
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:45,540
"Making me long for you"

1628
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:50,820
"Till I dont take a..."

1629
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,620

"And I'll bet on it"

1638
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:08,460
"Your thought lives in me..."

1639
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:11,900
"....when my heart beats
everytime"

1640
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:15,980
"Everytime I breathe..."

1641
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:19,740
".....it complaints to me"

1642
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:24,340

1648
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:50,340

01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:51,980
"I swear by you"

1650
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:57,380
"Game is to bet on"

1651
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:58,900
"And I'll bet on it"

1652
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:05,340
"You are alive once again
in me"

1653
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:07,420
"I'll die"

1654
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:13,180
"I'll kill him"

1655
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:18,300
"Your enemy, my friend,
my friend"

1656
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,820
"I swear by you"

1657
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,620
"I swear by you"

1658
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,300
Prashant Kumar...

1659
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:29,260
I know you are
being pricked!

1660
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,180
But think...

1661
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:34,780
...when Ram will be
hanged...

1662
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:37,140
...how will you feel then?

1663
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:38,540
P.K....

1664
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,620
....the price of his life...

1665
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:42,740
....10 crores!

1666
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:45,020
You come alone to
BhootGhat...

1667
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:45,980
...and give me!

1668
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:47,500
And remember one thing!

1669
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:51,340
If you act over smart....

1670
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,020
...or get your men
along with you...

1671
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:59,460
....then your brother's life
is at stake!

1672
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:00,780
Understood?

1673
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:59,380
I was sure you'll come
along with your men!

1674
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:01,620
So I have told my men....

1675
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:03,500
.....to shoot at you...

1676
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:06,180
...so they all come
out!

1677
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:09,580
Now for your brother's safety....

1678
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:13,580
....sit alone in the
boat that's waiting opposite you!

1679
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,980
Like a snake dances on the
instrument play.....

1680
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:55,940
.....in the same way you are
dancing on my tunes!

1681
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:59,100
Red Valley is 25 Kms...

1682
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:00,900
...only 15 minutes left!

1683
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,900
In 15 minutes the cassette will
be in the police station!

1684
02:02:05,620 --> 02:02:08,620
There is a white ambassador
standing in front of you!

1685
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:43,420
Excellent!

1686
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:46,220
What a co-incidence...

1687
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:49,740
.....15 years back
from today....

1688
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:52,500
....on this day, at this place....

1689
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:54,820
...you had robbed me P.K

1690
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:58,500
And today you have come
to pay be back with interest!

1691
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:01,700
I have come to repeat that....

1692
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:03,860
....happened to you 15 years back!

1693
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:07,100
Some people have a habit
of screaming before they die!

1694
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:09,860
But I wont feel bad about it.

1695
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:12,700
Hand over the money to me!

1696
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:26,700
This is your shroud!

1697
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,580
But I'll bury you
in this!

1698
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:56,820
So Shakaal?

1699
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:01,580
Your bullets dint work
out on my bullet-proof jacket!

1700
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:04,100
You shot me...

1701
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:04,940
...I fell down!

1702
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:07,100
You thought I am dead.

1703
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:10,180
But Shakaal...

1704
02:04:10,740 --> 02:04:12,700
....the man who is sitting in the
helicopter...

1705
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:16,820
....has taken a video of you!

1706
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,340
Now its like...

1707
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,420
....by producing this cassette in the
court...

1708
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:22,700
....the court will have to
accept it.

1709
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,260
That I am dead!

1710
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,860
And you have killed me!

1711
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:27,940
But P.K you have forgotten...

1712
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,820
...you are still alive!

1713
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:32,340
Only you know it Shakaal.

1714
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:35,020
The court will accept
that the cassette tells them

1715
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:37,740
I can hide anywhere I want

1716
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,140
I'll come out the day....

1717
02:04:40,700 --> 02:04:43,980
...when you'll be hanged
to death!

1718
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:46,580
Now are you giving me the cassette?

1719
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:48,740
Or do you want me to
show some more stunts!

1720
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:52,860
Thank you

1721
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:04,540
What are you doing?
Have you lost it?

1722
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,140
Move!

1723
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:06,860
You have no idea
what has he done?

1724
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:07,940
He is a murderer!

1725
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,620
What?
He has not only killed Laxman's murderer....

1726
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:12,380
....but has also broken
my lifelong penance!

1727
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:13,620
I wont spare him.

1728
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,860
Even if you kill me...

1729
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:22,220
...I'll kill everyone who has
killed Laxman.

1730
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:25,300
I will erase him from
the face of earth!

1731
02:05:26,380 --> 02:05:27,180
I have decided.....

1732
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:31,820
.....I will anoint myself
with the blood of Chief of Cobra Gang!

1733
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:36,020
Where are you going?

1734
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:42,060
Yes Speaking!

1735
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:46,700
Leena is the one who
can make you meet the Gang!

1736
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:50,780
She is going to be bailed
out at 4!

1737
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:53,140
There a Cobra tattooed...

1738
02:05:53,900 --> 02:05:55,180
....on her left hand!

1739
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:11,180
Please save me!
Your brother will kill me!

1740
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:12,100
What happen?

1741
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:13,620
Tell me?

1742
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,700
Scoundrel I wont leave you.

1743
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:17,140
What are you doing?
Have you lost it?

1744
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:18,780
He is from Cobra gang!

1745
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:20,540
I wont spare him!

1746
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:21,660
Listen to me!

1747
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,500
No I wont listen to you.

1748
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,260
I wont leave him!

1749
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:26,340
I will kill him!

1750
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:27,780
Have you lost it!

1751
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:50,420
Brother!

1752
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:53,540
You are Cobra....

1753
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:55,340
....Gang's chief!

1754
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,620
This means...

1755
02:07:58,220 --> 02:07:59,420
...you have killed Laxman?

1756
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:00,220
No Ram

1757
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:01,820
He has not killed Laxman

1758
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,220
He has killed him.

1759
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:04,780
He has killed him!

1760
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:07,580
Laxman was killed because of him

1761
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,340
Whoever's murdered him...

1762
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:11,740
....but he is responsible
for his death!

1763
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:15,980
I am responsible
for his death!

1764
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:18,620
Pick up the gun...

1765
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:21,020
....and shoot me!

1766
02:08:23,060 --> 02:08:24,580
And anoint yourself
with my blood....

1767
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:26,100
.....fulfil your promise!

1768
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:28,620
The swear that you have
taken on his pyre!

1769
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:31,380
Your pledge will be fulfilled

1770
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:34,140
I will also make amends for
my former misdoing

1771
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:36,860
Shoot me!

1772
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:38,540
Shoot!

1773
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:40,100
No!

1774
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:11,140
This is the price I offer you
to kill Leena!

1775
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:16,100
Who is no more
alive to give my name!

1776
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:20,780
And this is the price I offer you
to tell Ram about P.K!

1777
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:23,940
For which Ram hates......

1778
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,100
......P.K for his misdoing!

1779
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,060
And this is....

1780
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:31,380
....to kill Ram!

1781
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:34,700
Shakaal....

1782
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:37,020
...what enmity you hold
with Ram!

1783
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:39,220
The reason behind
enimity with Ram is....

1784
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:40,940
....your friendship with me!

1785
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,060
What do you mean?

1786
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:44,420
Ram has killed your
brother!

1787
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,580
Ram, has killed my brother?

1788
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:48,500
P.K.'s brother Ram!

1789
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:54,140
I will write each member's name on
every bullet of my gun!

1790
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:56,700
In this revengeful activity....

1791
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:58,260
....Shakaal is with you!

1792
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:04,980
Brotherâ€¦.

1793
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:07,740
You are the chief...

1794
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:09,420
....of the Cobra gang?

1795
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:11,780
Means...

1796
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,100
....You have killed Laxman?

1797
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:17,820
No sister in law he has murdered Laxman!

1798
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:19,260
He has killed Laxman!

1799
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:21,660
Laxman was killed
because of him!

1800
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:22,900
Whoever's killed him....

1801
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:24,700
....but he is responsible
for his death!

1802
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,220
Whoever's killed him....

1803
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,820
....but he is responsible
for his death!

1804
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:30,260
Whoever's killed him....

1805
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:32,980
....but he is responsible
for his death!

1806
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:38,100
What happen?

1807
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:39,300
Why are you doing
this?

1808
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,860
What happened
Parvati....?

1809
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:44,460
What happened?

1810
02:10:45,180 --> 02:10:46,020
Everything will be fine!

1811
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:47,940
I'll bring Ram back!

1812
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:49,220
No!
-Yes!

1813
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:52,380
Ram will never come back
Parvati!

1814
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:55,660
I know him very well.

1815
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:59,300
By shooting on my
picture he has proved....

1816
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,620
...he hates me
so much!

1817
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:03,340
He'll definitely come back!

1818
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:05,660
I have nourished him!

1819
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:07,380
He can never avert me!

1820
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:11,620
But for that you'll have
to promise me one thing....

1821
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:13,420
Say....

1822
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:16,100
....will you stop doing such
sinful activities?

1823
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:19,700
Parvati...

1824
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,420
...I promise you....

1825
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:24,340
...I can leave everything for
my brother!

1826
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:27,380
Just get him back
to me!

1827
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:28,540
Just get him back
to me!

1828
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:30,620
I'll get him back.

1829
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:37,940
Ram...

1830
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:39,500
....go back home!

1831
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:43,660
Which house are you
talking about?

1832
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:47,500
Whose expectations and hopes
are tied with you!

1833
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:50,980
No Rita...

1834
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,860
That is not my house!

1835
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:57,100
It stinks from sinful
activities happened in the house!

1836
02:11:57,540 --> 02:11:58,940
Ram, dont say that.

1837
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:03,020
The bond of blood
can that ever break?

1838
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:04,220
Sister in law....

1839
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,060
Relationship is not
only with blood

1840
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:10,180
I have no blood relations
with you....

1841
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:12,140
.....but that doesnt mean....

1842
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:13,980
....that you are not like
my mother!

1843
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:16,700
And the blood relation you
are talking about...

1844
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:19,260
...If he is my elder brother...

1845
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:21,980
....the he is also the murderer
of my younger brother!

1846
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:23,660
Dont say that Ram!

1847
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,860
After you have come
here....

1848
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,540
....your brother has completely
shattered!

1849
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:31,900
If I wouldnt have reached
on time...

1850
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:33,340
...I dont know
what would he do!

1851
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:35,580
Come back home.

1852
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:37,500
You have no idea.....

1853
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:39,460
....how much he
loves you!

1854
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:44,340
Even I love him a lot...

1855
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:47,700
.....but who is responsible
for my brother's death....

1856
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:49,780
How do I call him
my brother?

1857
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:51,700
How do I embrace him?

1858
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:54,180
Who is responsible for
Laxman's death!

1859
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:55,860
How?

1860
02:12:57,380 --> 02:12:58,500
You are right!

1861
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:01,060
But....

1862
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,820
But your brother wasnt like
this!

1863
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:07,580
Times dint let him
stay the way he was!

1864
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,140
To save us....

1865
02:13:10,820 --> 02:13:11,980
...he was forced to
take such steps!

1866
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:14,340
To see you happy.....

1867
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,060
....he cant do anything!

1868
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:18,060
He even forgets...

1869
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,940
...what's right what's wrong!

1870
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,620
A person's life...

1871
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:25,660
....is not greater than his
needs!

1872
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:28,380
I dont understand to adopt
a wrong way......

1873
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:31,180
......for our own people!

1874
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:33,380
Look....

1875
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:34,860
...I dont know all that.

1876
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:37,820
I beg u...

1877
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:39,020
...come home!

1878
02:13:39,620 --> 02:13:40,340
Sister in law

1879
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:43,140
Ask for drops of blood
from me....

1880
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:45,460
...I will wash your feet with it
but...

1881
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:47,420
...dont ask me to return
back!

1882
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:48,620
Why?

1883
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:50,100
Why not?

1884
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:55,260
While seeing dreams.....

1885
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:58,060
...if you wake up
suddenly...

1886
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:00,460
...can you see the same dream
again?

1887
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:02,820
No right!

1888
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,500
Even I have woken up!

1889
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:06,660
No Ram!

1890
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:09,300
Sister in law!

1891
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:12,660
Sister in law!

1892
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:46,900
Sister in law!

1893
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:47,900
Sister in law!

1894
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:50,060
Sister in law!

1895
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:53,140
I have no time left...

1896
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:56,580
...I had promised your
brother....

1897
02:14:57,140 --> 02:15:00,220
...I will take you back
home....

1898
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:01,940
...so before my death....

1899
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:04,700
...I want to
fulfill my promise!

1900
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:05,540
No!

1901
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:06,500
Dont say this!

1902
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:07,820
Dont say this!

1903
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:09,620
You will fulfill your
promise!

1904
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:10,940
And nothing will
happen to you.

1905
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:13,500
Come on lets go home.

1906
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:18,340
He has still not
come?

1907
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,180
He'll come!

1908
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:21,020
He'll just come!

1909
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,300
I'll call the doctor!
No Ram

1910
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:27,620
I am unable to breathe....

1911
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:29,020
I wish....

1912
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:32,980
I die in his arms!

1913
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:36,060
May be, he has come!

1914
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:41,860
Brother!

1915
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:43,500
Ram

1916
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:46,060
You have come.

1917
02:15:46,740 --> 02:15:47,380
I knew...

1918
02:15:47,860 --> 02:15:49,820
...you'll definitely come
back to me!

1919
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:53,940
Promise me you
wont ever leave me!

1920
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:54,660
Promise me!

1921
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:56,700
What happen?

1922
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:58,140
Blood?

1923
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:59,060
What happen?

1924
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,580
What happen?

1925
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:01,260
Brother!

1926
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:03,420
My sister in law...

1927
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:04,220
What happen to Parvati?

1928
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:06,180
Brother your enemies....

1929
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:08,820
.....shot her!

1930
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:11,780
They shot Parvati!

1931
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:13,980
They shot Parvati!

1932
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:16,940
Brother!

1933
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,420
What happened
Parvati!

1934
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,180
What is all this?

1935
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:24,060
I have got...

1936
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:24,980
....your brother back!

1937
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:27,100
Your brother...

1938
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:31,180
...he'll never leave you
and go!

1939
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,460
But...

1940
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:34,300
...I am leaving you
-No

1941
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:35,500
No!

1942
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:36,900
No Parvati...

1943
02:16:37,140 --> 02:16:38,060
...I have come
now everything will be fine!

1944
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:39,820
This is written...

1945
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:42,060
....in my fate!

1946
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:00,940
You left me!

1947
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:04,180
But your death...

1948
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:06,980
....will force me to
take a revenge!

1949
02:17:08,300 --> 02:17:10,140
And with this burning...

1950
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:13,540
...I will burn all my
enemies alive!

1951
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:16,660
Who has killed you!

1952
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:17,980
Brother!

1953
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:20,740
I am with you....

1954
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:22,700
.....in this vindictive
war!

1955
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:23,980
Brother!

1956
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:28,500
I have dragged all
those scoundrels to your feet!

1957
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:30,740
Who have killed my
sister in law!

1958
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:32,940
Here are they!

1959
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:34,740
Here!

1960
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:36,500
Come out!

1961
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:38,820
Come out!

1962
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:40,780
Scoundrels!

1963
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:44,220
Come out.

1964
02:20:47,940 --> 02:20:48,580
Take this Brother!

1965
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:51,140
And punish them for
what they have done!

1966
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:10,660
What are you thinking?

1967
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:13,260
Shoot them

1968
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:20,500
Kill them!

1969
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:25,580
Kill them brother!

1970
02:21:27,580 --> 02:21:28,420
Kill them brother!

1971
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:33,020
I said kill them Brother!

1972
02:22:11,980 --> 02:22:13,660
An end has come to
everything!

1973
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:16,700
Everything!

1974
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:21,340
Friends
Enmity!

1975
02:22:22,620 --> 02:22:24,060
My own people
and even others!

1976
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:27,180
I am tired Ram!

1977
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,740
I am very tired!

1978
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:31,980
Come!

1979
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:33,900
I'll surrender....

1980
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:37,460
....and will atone for my sins!

1981
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:41,460
So that Parvati's soul rest in peace!

1982
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:42,580
Come on.

1983
02:22:44,860 --> 02:22:45,580
I am with you
brother!

1984
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,180
I am with you.

1985
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:11,660
Boss you are alive!

1986
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:13,220
What is my name?

1987
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,020
Shakaal!

1988
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,500
The meaning of my name!

1989
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:18,460
Shakaal!

1990
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:19,100
Yes!

1991
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:21,140
Means King of Death!

1992
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:21,580
Yes!

1993
02:23:22,420 --> 02:23:24,900
And the Kings never die!

1994
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:27,820
But they'll definitely die!

1995
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:28,860
Definitely!

1996
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:30,860
Come on.

1997
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:11,580
You are surprised seeing
me alive?

1998
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:18,420
The way you were saved from
your bullet proof jacket...

1999
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:19,620
...in the same manner....

2000
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:22,620
....your bullets saved me from my
bullet proof jacket!

2001
02:26:23,420 --> 02:26:24,580
Prashant Kumar alias P.K

2002
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:27,020
Now, the game is in my
hands...

2003
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,900
....if you have courage
get down!

2004
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:32,340
What are you boasting by
hovering around us?

2005
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:35,900
I had forgotten....

2006
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:38,740
....you are here
along with his sycophant

2007
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:43,460
I'll first shoot the sycophant first!

2008
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,100
No!

2009
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:54,500
No Prashant No!

2010
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:56,780
Suffer your punishment!

2011
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:14,820
No Prashant!

2012
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:17,740
