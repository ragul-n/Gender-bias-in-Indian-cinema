00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:19,867
Where is Ramchand.

You gave the whole bowl to Bappu,

26
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,338
Yes! He works all day long,

27
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,802
drink as much I gave you.

28
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,721
Who are you?
I'm asking who are you?

29
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,994
Ramchand?
Why did you came here?

30
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,061
Why did you came here?

31
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:29,033
My village is there,

32
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,905
Where? In India?

33
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,211
Are you alone or somebody else with
you?

34
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,011
Search him,

35
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,391
He brought weapon along he will make
Kashmir free,

36
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,769
Ramchand!

37
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:41,933
Hands up,

38
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,224
I am a poor man, I cam inside after
my child,

39
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,838
Let me go,

40
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,240
You came after child.

41
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,395
He must go to Mithi,

42
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,893
So he would stay there,
Is he gone with Ramchand,

43
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,430
I hope he would be with him,

44
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:00,079
Udhay Shankar

45
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,588
call him,

46
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,788
Shankar didn't come,

47
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:29,108
He came here, he must be sitted
on crate,

48
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:32,740
He says he saw Ramchand going to
border,

49
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:55,999
Let me go,
he is there.

50
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:59,266
If it would earlier then I should ask,

51
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:02,707
War is ready in both country,
we can't take to Indian,

52
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,773
Sir, tell police to write down FIR.

53
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:08,742

00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,652

56
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,061
You looks like Pakistani agent from
your face,

57
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,177
Before a guy came here like you, he
didn't agree that he is an agent,

58
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,642
when he lived three years here then
he agreed everything.

59
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:41,778
Then he died on hang, I think you
will commit like him,

If you want to pee then why you didn't

116
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:39,821
It's not Pakistan where nobody sees

117
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:44,024
It's not also a Dehil Railway Line
where all citizen came to pee,

Won't you have tea?

128
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:33,673

But your name must enter here,

136
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:44,152

143
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:52,643
What?

144
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:56,208
Is this your child's letter?

145
00:27:57,486 --> 00:28:01,081
I found them in bushes,
No!

146
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,488
Vadera is calling you,

147
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:11,492
Rain happened after 4 years and it
didn't come every year,

148
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,993
He will get more workers,

149
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:17,267
Next week cutting will be start,
Allright!

150
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,838
Come after cutting, Now how would

151
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,109
Tell her that give me Shankar's
buffalo, I'll sell it and pay interest,

152
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,111
I won't give you buffalo,

153
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,796
Stay here and silence,

154
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:46,996
What did you say?
You abuse me,

155
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,238
Listen! I brought Ramchand,
Make him sit outside,

156
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:58,209
I don't have any experince to nurture
childrens,

157
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:00,645
then why did you call me here,

158
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,375
Because we have to teach him little
bit,

159
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:07,013
If I have to do these kind of things
then I would be maid in Mumbai,

160
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:11,893
I would earn more tan police,
Then why are you servicing in police?

161
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:16,153
I can do many thing is police,
Then do it.

162
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,930
I am doing, but I am still here from
10 years.

163
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,669
Why did you keep child in this jail,

164
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,174
Because border crossing case didn't
go anywhere, his father is also here.

165
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:33,804
If his father is here then why me?
You came here to pay your duty,

166
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:34,950
Go!

167
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:37,941

00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:41,382
Hey!

177
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,743
Why you didn't tell that you are
offscoure,

178
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,049
nobody here is offscoure, everyone is
same,

179
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:06,174
Chandar! My goats won't go,

You wanna go then go, I won't come.

184
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:26,754
Explain her, If she won't agree then
I'll will tie her and take her along.

185
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:03,647
It's been three days, I think she
also crossed the border,

186
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:09,124
Let's go, Suresh.

187
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,810
Bappu! When we will go to village?

188
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,675

00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:20,885
Didn't give me the stuff of one
cigarrete, these ahmedabad thieves,

190
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,215
Stop rubbish and make a ciggarette,

191
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:25,284
You have have a habit to make every
matter political.

192
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:46,172
Would you write a letter to Mom,
I don't know how to write,

193
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:49,309
I'll write, you narrate.

194
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:56,052
I don't drink tea anymore.

195
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,660
I have my own bottle, you take it,

196
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,294
Have it, have it, don't look at your
father.

197
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:43,495
What are you doing?

198

I making your son man,

199
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:51,976
Your son won't be a noble man to stay
here, he will become like this.

200
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:55,516
Ramchand prisoner # 111.

201
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:33,687
What are you looking at?

202
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:38,025
Your father beats much, he is a
powerful man,

203
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,724
Until your father will come, you will
be set, have it.

204
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:48,227
Don't understand.

205
00:38:49,004 --> 00:38:50,972
I was joking.

206
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:47,489
Ramchand! Get up, they are counting
on.

207
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,693
Wake up quick.

208
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,970
What's wrong?
Are you allright?

209
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:00,441
Ramchand! Come outside.

00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,504

218
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:51,049
Madam, I didn't find Mr. India, so I
brought Chalbaaz,

219
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,893
It will work,
and listen you won't touch my dishes.

220
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:05,103
What are you looking at?
Look here.

Keep it in my room.

228
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:15,426
Go away from here.

229
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:45,721
Sell it for me,

230
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,593
No need of this, keep it,
Why?

231
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,363
Keep it,
No!

232
00:45:03,044 --> 00:45:04,272
I went to Tando Alla Yar,

233
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,247
They are coming to take you along,

234
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,480
Bring me Ramchand's whistle,

235
00:46:55,223 --> 00:46:58,192
Your Vijay, he is still the same,

236
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:03,191
When I asked him about marriage,
then he laugh and refuse me.

237
00:47:03,464 --> 00:47:06,194
And says marriage is not in my luck.

238
00:47:06,968 --> 00:47:09,937
If you will act in film then entire
India will clap for you.

239
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:30,446
My sister's son is in Mumbai,
Whom you are showing this drama,

240
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:34,194
Get lost rather I'll play your band
like I played my husband,

241
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:39,495
go and clean hussain's room fan, it's
getting black like your face,

242
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:44,272
All men are same,

243
00:47:44,272 --> 00:47:48,174
Where they saw a woman, they start
showing their lust,

244
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:53,235
I told you don't touch my dishes,

245
00:47:53,781 --> 00:47:57,239
pick up the bucket and get lost from
here.

246
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:19,934
Your magazine is telling that your
government was involved in Ahmedabad

247
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,109
's riot,
This magazine tells rubbish, It's

248
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:25,974
also belongs to Muslims,
It's out of your reach,

249
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:29,774
You people job is only burn muslim's
shop and rob them,

250
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:32,409
Muslims are very safe in Pakistan,
What?

251
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:36,011
Until police man didn't stay outside
you people can't pray,

252
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,353
That's why he came here and not going
back from home,

253
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,462
I came here for Proselytism not to
stay

254
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:44,431
first make pakistani muslims then do
Proselytism here,

255
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,324
I wrote a love letter to you,

256
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,930
Sir is here,
He is gone out,

257
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,677
She is that Koli woman,

258
00:49:30,478 --> 00:49:33,606
I feel very sorry for her, why don't
you explain her,

259
00:49:33,982 --> 00:49:37,281
Pakistan Rangers are trying hard to
find her husband and son,

260
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:42,652
many times they include their names in
list and send but nobody answers.

261
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,760
I believe that they are not anymore,

262
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:49,875
Eat something,

263
00:51:56,924 --> 00:51:58,755
You didn't shown from 3 days,

264
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:04,298
Get out.

265
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:08,698
Eat some then I will go,
I don't want to.

266
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:14,169
Go from here.

267
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,478
Come here to the wall.

268
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:04,245
Now go,
now you come.

269
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,517
Come and sign it.

270
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:18,724
What's this?

271
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,632
Your and Ramchand's name is entered,
file is going up,

272
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,402
I think your release is suppose to
come,

273
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,788
Where is madam?

274
00:54:41,956 --> 00:54:44,447
Don't know.
- Again she leave with Deepak, isn't she?

275
00:54:44,725 --> 00:54:47,819
Is she meet with Deepak
daily? Get a side.

276
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:49,190
I have to go inside.

277
00:54:49,263 --> 00:54:50,753
Yours...

278
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:04,844
Is he gone?
- Yes.

279
00:55:05,546 --> 00:55:08,310
If he goes out to comprehend Phoolan
Devi then she can be caught in 2 days.

280
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,906
Don't know why he's on my tail.

281
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:12,917
You drop this duster and
go to my room for study.

282
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,148
Lets go.

283
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,701
I'm 9 years old.
- Where do you live?

284
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:38,200
I live in Bhimra.
- Good.

285
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,620
This thread start pinching your arm.

286
00:56:01,268 --> 00:56:03,099
Take it off and tie this.

287
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:07,106
I'll carefully place the old one.

288
00:56:07,308 --> 00:56:09,276
When you'll leave then
take it back from me.

289
00:56:11,946 --> 00:56:13,243
Go and ask father to tie it.

290
00:56:17,218 --> 00:56:19,587
What do you think you are?

291
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:23,114
What do you think you are? If
you touch me then you'll be dirty.

292
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:24,985
You are out of your mind.

293
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,556
Bastard.

294
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:34,030
It's more than a year that I forget my
family and come here during preaching.

295
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:37,060
Don't how they will manage with me.

296
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:38,329
Baba.

297
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:41,400
You sit down.
- No it's alright.

298
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:04,418
Stop... stop.

299
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:05,784
Stop.

300
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:36,472
Tell her to manage the
children along with her.

301
00:59:36,984 --> 00:59:38,952
What will she do alone
in such a big mansion.

302
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:44,452
I want to talk to you on this matter.

303
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:48,083
- Man isn't with him.
- I know.

304
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:51,357
That's why I give her nice house
to live. What else she need?

305
00:59:51,999 --> 00:59:54,467
Right off her interest.

306
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:58,005
So many other women also work
at my place those don't have men.

307
00:59:58,005 --> 01:00:00,565
Like the way they are paying the
interest, she'll also pay like them.

308
01:00:01,008 --> 01:00:03,670
If she give her bull in account of her
interest then she it'll be easy for her.

309
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,176
Teach her some manners.

310
01:00:06,347 --> 01:00:08,611
Is she want to work for 5 years or 3?

311
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:10,942
Give your bull he'll not
right off the interest.

312
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:13,411
You'll get grain at least for 3 years.

313
01:01:32,332 --> 01:01:34,061
Lets go all will go inside now.

314
01:01:34,435 --> 01:01:36,926
Nobody will come out.

315
01:01:38,572 --> 01:01:41,803
Lets go, all the time
you are ready to fight.

316
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,440
I put the professor in cell no. 6, sir.

317
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:50,316
You don't have any need to
bang anybody from your side.

318
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:51,782
If it's your son, then?

319
01:01:52,853 --> 01:01:55,583
Why you put us here if
you aren't able to care us?

320
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,524
Do you know what
behavior is on with us?

321
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:00,620
Treat us as animals.

322
01:02:01,261 --> 01:02:05,595
Go and see in Pakistan's jails that
how they are treating our prisoners.

323
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,290
They are living the life
miserable then dogs.

324
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:12,065
- You are enjoying over here.
- Just come once join with us.

325
01:02:12,272 --> 01:02:15,298
You are talking too much...
and who the hell are you?

326
01:02:15,843 --> 01:02:18,004
Your country people
don't know where are you?

327
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:21,172
Nobody cares if you and
your son die over here.

328
01:02:21,348 --> 01:02:22,576
Understand?

329
01:02:22,716 --> 01:02:23,808
Take him away!

330
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:25,579
Lets go, it's time to go now.

331
01:02:30,491 --> 01:02:32,049
You are the reason of all problems.

332
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:33,887
All happened just because of you.

333
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:31,010
- Come out.
- Why are you smiling?

334
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:33,083
See straight.

335
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:35,818
I need to go to washroom.

336
01:03:37,491 --> 01:03:38,856
Open the door.

337
01:03:40,494 --> 01:03:43,258
Let me loose some it's
already been 4 days.

338
01:03:43,997 --> 01:03:45,089
Lallu.

339
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:07,576
Ramchand, superintendent is calling you.

340
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:18,458
Bapu. (Babu=Father).

341
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:24,300
Bapu.

342
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:30,441
Bapu. Superintendent-saab
said that we are leaving...

343
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:32,678

01:24:39,785 --> 01:24:43,243
Are you crying?

518
01:24:45,024 --> 01:24:48,983
Come here.

519
01:24:54,533 --> 01:24:56,501
You will not stay over here
for the rest of your life.

520
01:24:57,303 --> 01:24:59,771
Your leave is about to come.

521
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:02,808

522
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,776

524
01:25:08,848 --> 01:25:10,816
Now you'll forget me.

525
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:17,311
You disturb me that much I'll
not forget you till seven births.

526
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:10,908
Ramchand.

527
01:26:11,677 --> 01:26:13,440
Do you want to ride a bicycle?

528
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:16,209
Lets go and ride the bicycle.

529
01:26:16,715 --> 01:26:18,945
Look don't put it down.

530
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:21,715
Understand, now go.

531
01:26:29,094 --> 01:26:32,825
- If you don't know how to ride then leave it.
- Leave... leave... leave.

532
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,982
Sit.

533
01:26:49,982 --> 01:26:51,950
Sit.

534
01:26:54,253 --> 01:26:56,983
Now paddle.

535
01:27:00,259 --> 01:27:02,227
Go.

536
01:27:04,763 --> 01:27:07,231
O' Bangali look!

537
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:11,998
Ramchand go straight out of gate.

538
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:13,539
Bapu.

539
01:27:13,539 --> 01:27:15,006
I'm leaving.

540
01:27:29,455 --> 01:27:32,424
Listen everybody, release
of 6 prisoner has arrived.

541
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:36,149
Tomorrow names will
be announced at fall in.

542
01:27:39,698 --> 01:27:43,896
Talk something we are sitting
like we are in a sanctuary.

543
01:27:45,971 --> 01:27:48,701
Mooti give me some cigarette.

544
01:27:51,477 --> 01:27:53,707
Your fatherjust looks
like a mystery movie hero.

545
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,209
He has style.

546
01:27:56,982 --> 01:27:59,450
He isn't worried that ever
he'll be released or not.

547
01:28:02,254 --> 01:28:03,622
Have you listened it?

548
01:28:03,622 --> 01:28:06,591
I felt that your ears are
out of order like your brain.

549
01:28:07,126 --> 01:28:09,094
Ever your fake release order has arrived?

550
01:28:12,364 --> 01:28:17,097
Then how could you understand that once you
are released and again you are in prison.

551
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:22,329
This time fake news won't come.

552
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:30,348
Ramchand I have an headache.
Massage my head a bit.

553
01:28:32,651 --> 01:28:33,652
What are you looking Bangali?

554
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:35,381
I was watching my palm prints... brother.

555
01:28:36,021 --> 01:28:39,479
If you had watched border line instead of palm
prints so today nothing will happen like this.

556
01:28:40,025 --> 01:28:42,255
- Border.
- Don't abuse border.

557
01:28:42,528 --> 01:28:46,760
If there isn't border then you mustn't be Bangali,
he mustn't be an Indian and I mustn't be Pakistani.

558
01:28:47,032 --> 01:28:49,262
Border isn't that much bad.

559
01:28:51,036 --> 01:28:53,266
Headquarter send 6 Pakistani prisoners.

560
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:55,668
They are going to be released tomorrow.

561
01:28:57,209 --> 01:29:00,667
Tomorrow they move from here to Delhi and
day after tomorrow they'll move to Waugh.

562
01:29:01,714 --> 01:29:03,682
Their names are...

563
01:29:03,982 --> 01:29:06,218
...Lateif Baloch.

564
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:08,487
Yaqoob Shah.

565
01:29:08,487 --> 01:29:10,489
Muhammad Akram.

566
01:29:10,489 --> 01:29:12,491
Rehman Ahmed.

567
01:29:12,491 --> 01:29:14,459
Veesheash Lal.

568
01:29:14,993 --> 01:29:17,461
And Ramchand.

569
01:29:20,099 --> 01:29:23,335
Sir aren't you forget
to read my father's name?

570
01:29:23,335 --> 01:29:25,565
Shanker's name isn't
present in it, Ramchand.

571
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:28,374
Sir you'll check again they called
us at Delhi and said sorry we

572
01:29:28,374 --> 01:29:31,343
are mistaken your name isn't in
it. May be again same thing happen.

573
01:29:33,145 --> 01:29:35,113
I already asked.

574
01:29:39,385 --> 01:29:41,387
I'll not leave without my father.

575
01:29:41,387 --> 01:29:43,655
I'll not leave without father.

576
01:29:43,655 --> 01:29:45,122
I'll not go.

577
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:48,893
Will you cry in front
of your mother like this?

578
01:29:52,264 --> 01:29:55,722
Go straight to Bimra,
mother will be there.

579
01:29:56,268 --> 01:29:58,498
And stay there till the time...

580
01:30:03,275 --> 01:30:07,045
Tell your Mom that
Ramchand is grown up now.

581
01:30:07,045 --> 01:30:09,047
Now marry him.

582
01:30:09,047 --> 01:30:11,015
With Susmita Sen.

583
01:30:13,552 --> 01:30:18,557
My money is with Superintendent
I'll ask him to give it to you.

584
01:30:18,557 --> 01:30:20,787
Bring eye-led to your mother.

585
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,089
She like it very much.

586
01:30:23,595 --> 01:30:25,688
Eye-led worth of complete 160 rupee?

587
01:30:26,098 --> 01:30:28,328
Still you remember that 160 rupee.

588
01:30:30,269 --> 01:30:33,727
You buy it by yourself, I'm not leaving.

589
01:30:35,841 --> 01:30:39,140
- You can't stay over here Ramchand.
- You are send me there at whose place?

590
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:42,046
There your mother lives.

591
01:30:42,581 --> 01:30:44,811
How do you know?
- What do you mean?

592
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:47,051
How do you know that she's alive?

593
01:30:47,352 --> 01:30:49,320
Isn't she die without me and Bapu?

594
01:30:49,488 --> 01:30:51,490
Did you send some news?

595
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:53,992
Did you send some letter?

596
01:30:53,992 --> 01:30:55,761
We don't have order to
send letters, Ramchand.

597
01:30:55,761 --> 01:30:58,263
What was my crime? Why you
take me here for 5 years?

598
01:30:58,263 --> 01:31:03,724
First you separate my mother from
me now you are separating my father.

599
01:31:06,805 --> 01:31:08,773
I'll try to get your father
release as soon as possible.

600
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:12,010
I'm unable to build trust.

601
01:31:17,216 --> 01:31:21,175
I promise.

602
01:31:27,926 --> 01:31:30,656
Latif Bhai, tell my wife that
rent out the outside room.

603
01:31:30,929 --> 01:31:34,700
Where is the room I'll take it.

604
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,669
And tell her also that not
to rent it out to a bachelor.

605
01:31:37,936 --> 01:31:41,929
And tell my mother that wed my
sister and don't wait for me.

606
01:31:43,575 --> 01:31:47,306
Latif Bhai as you gets you release
pay my regard to Mirpur Khas.

607
01:31:48,847 --> 01:31:51,077
Brother, deliver letter at my home.

608
01:31:53,785 --> 01:31:55,787
What will you do by going home?

609
01:31:55,787 --> 01:31:59,416
Again he starts catching
fish and come back here.

610
01:33:19,204 --> 01:33:22,608
Ramchand, have this.

611
01:33:22,608 --> 01:33:25,611
It's such a special
ball. I made it for you.

612
01:33:25,611 --> 01:33:28,341
Look it has sign of each and
every great person of this cell.

613
01:33:29,414 --> 01:33:30,881
Now you'll not forget us.

614
01:33:31,149 --> 01:33:33,379
Mooti bhai.

615
01:33:54,673 --> 01:33:59,177
It's time to leave. Van has arrived.

616
01:33:59,177 --> 01:34:00,644
Ramchand.

617
01:34:02,314 --> 01:34:03,781
Leave.

618
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,518
Leave me now.

619
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:09,747
He's calling.

620
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:12,057

Now go now.

630
01:37:34,659 --> 01:37:42,623
Ramchand.

631
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:48,940
"After few days Shanker

01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:53,900

633
01:37:54,446 --> 01:37:56,181
"Ramchand is now getting
education in school."

634
01:37:56,181 --> 01:37:59,639
"Still he don't drink tea."
