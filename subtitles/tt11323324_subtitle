00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:07,198
FEW MONTHS AGO

2
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:33,698
Hi madam! Super Eats.

3
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:34,764
Food delivery

4
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:36,681
Bill amount.

5
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,739
Just a minute.

6
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,506
Hello!

7
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,817
I'm making onion raitha.

8
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,781
For main course,
it's chicken biryani and mutton fry.

9
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,781
Madam!
It's mutton biryani and chicken fry.

10
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,292
No, no, no... It's mutton
biryani and chicken fry.

11
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,281
You come and taste it

12
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,246
you'll be surprised
that I made it.

13
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:00,682
It's so delicious.

14
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,576
Remember that Hyderabadi biryani

15
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,416
it'll taste exactly like that.

16
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,115
Fine. Come home soon.

17
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,406
Bye!

18
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:12,785
Husband.

19
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,573
In fact I'm a good cook.

20
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,656
I missed to catch my
favorite series last night.

21
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,323
I wanted to catch the
re-run, so didn't cook.

22
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,281
Madam, since we stepped in
no one cooks these days.

23
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,035
With scorching heat in our city

24
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:29,285
making variety of food
inside the kitchen

25
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,285
then feed and serve them all

26
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:34,948
finally when you get down to
eat, you'll be frustrated

27
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:36,906
you'll totally lose the will to
eat, am I right?

28
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,160
That's why madam

29
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,657
we bring you food from your favorite
restaurants within 10 minutes.

30
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,073
Thank you, madam. Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

31
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,368
What are you going to pursue?

32
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:54,998
Engineering, brother.
- After that?

33
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:56,866
Will find a job.
- What if you don't find one?

34
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,183
Until I find one,
will work part-time.

35
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,563
Aren't you doing
the same right now?

36
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,286
Then why do you have to
waste 4 years of your life?

37
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:05,573
Don't pursue engineering.

38
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,115
Pursuing that,
won't fetch you a job.

39
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,958
Please understand.

40
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,453
Fine, what did you pursue?

41
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:14,749
Listen,
I'm diabetic can't hold anymore.

42
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,856
I have to eat on time.

43
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:18,198
Come on, let's eat
- Poor thing, he's diabetic.

44
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,118
He has to take his meal on
time, let's eat.

45
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:21,573
You do the same...

46
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,323
Come on brother tell
me, what did you pursue?

47
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,448
What were you going to pursue?
- Engineering!

48
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:35,906
You have all the qualities
required to pursue it.

49
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:36,990
Go ahead!

50
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,240
Are you serious?
Thank you, brother.

51
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:42,535
This is coming from a 90's kid,
be careful.

52
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,774
What took you so long?

53
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:44,781
How late am I?

54
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:48,073
Just don't make small talk,
bloody started without me.

55
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,906
Are you new here?
- Yes brother.

56
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:51,865
Did we get lucky
with any takeout?

57
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,705
No buddy, it's no luck November.

58
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:54,670
Just tomato rice.

59
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,448
Give that, you've been guffing it.

60
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:02,499
Buddy, were you able to arrange
the money you were looking for?

61
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,948
I'm on it, still no luck with it.

62
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:06,906
Fine, did you ask your uncle?

63
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:11,115
I did ask him, but he said
will take longer than expected.

64
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,906
Please try harder.
- Sure buddy.

65
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,698
The next order is in.

66
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,281
Their hunger makes us go hungry.

67
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,969
No.33, Krishna Street, Madha Nagar.

68
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:26,615
Buddy, this is your order.

69
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:30,656
Stop over reacting.

70
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,240
Anyways, you'll go.

71
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,573
Come on, leave.

72
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,323
Give me that,
don't take it with you.

73
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:37,781
How come you're leaving

74
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,248
without knowing
what's been ordered.

75
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,573
Stop pissing me off.

76
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,823
As a 90's kid,
what I have a to say...

77
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,573
70's kid...

78
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,326
I'm diabetic brother.

79
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,656
Fine, you continue eating.

80
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,490
Welcome, Mr. Prabhu.

81
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,656
Sir, seems like you're angry.

82
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,614
Don't you have any sense?

83
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,406
Why did you place a huge order?

84
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,698
So, that your problem now?

85
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,073
I've been working hard
day and night for this money.

86
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:24,656
Fine, you keep working hard.

87
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,781
You don't turn up
on Sundays too.

88
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,073
May be you've
forgotten about me.

89
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,573
But I felt like seeing you
and wanted to spend time.

90
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,073
That's why I used this
order as an excuse.

91
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,531
You wanted to me see me right?
Take a good look.

92
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:43,823
You don't even realize why
I'm taking so much effort.

93
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:46,115
For God sake,
don't place another order.

94
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:47,865
That's my one day's pay.

95
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,031
Sorry!

96
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,531
Are you angry?
- Get lost!

97
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,240
I'm sorry, dear.
- I don't care, get lost.

98
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,448
Come on!

99
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,281
Love you!

100
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,406
I'm all sweaty,
are you fine with it?

101
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,240
It's not new to me.

102
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,076
Hi!
- What is it?

103
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:01,765
Did you eat?

104
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,615
I'll get it done in 10 days.
- Greetings, sir..

105
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,781
Fine not an issue,
will take care of it.

106
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:54,132
What's up Prabhu,
you made a payment of 2 Lacs

107
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:55,576
then you just disappeared.

108
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,156
Sir, I was working on that

109
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,115
I somehow managed to arrange the
money, here take it.

110
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,344
You won't believe the things
I went through to get this.

111
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:05,237
Come on, you'll earn it back
once you start working in Saudi.

112
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,993
Sir, that's in your hands.

113
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,323
I've made the payment in full.

114
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:09,837
Somehow squeeze me
into the current batch.

115
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,586
I can't give you
a guarantee on that

116
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:13,217
I can only confirm after
speaking to the company.

117
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,209
Sir, come on don't
go back on your word.

118
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:18,463
If you had paid up on time,
it would've worked out.

119
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,838
You're right,
but I didn't do it intentionally.

120
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:24,459
You're well aware, our education
loan is still not cleared.

121
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,629
I've arranged this money
pawning my wive's jewelry.

122
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,588
If you manage to get
me into this batch

123
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,209
I'll pay off the
debts and settle down.

124
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,296
Please consider it.

125
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,209
Fine, I'll speak to the company.

126
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,918
Thanks a lot, I'll leave.

127
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,251
Prabhu!
- Sir...

128
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,501
Did you get your passport?

129
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,459
I'm done with the interview,
will get in 10 days.

130
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,574
Okay, bye!
- Take care.

131
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,675
Tell me, Indhu.

132
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:51,931
Hey, where are you?

133
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:54,282
At the agent's office,
just made the payment.

134
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,208
What did he say?

135
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,644
I've requested him to send
me in the current batch. Let's see.

136
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,185
Fine, are you free in
the afternoon for lunch?

137
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,144
What's with sudden
plans for lunch?

138
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:04,019
I gotta discuss
something with you.

139
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,310
In fact,
I have a lot to discuss.

140
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,519
Okay, where shall we go for lunch?

141
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,805
Are you fine with the
restaurant next to my office?

142
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:10,730
Okay bye!

143
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:13,060
Prabhu
- Tell me

144
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,938
I love you!

145
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:18,805
Wow, that's great.

146
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,357
Can't you say it back?

147
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:24,578
I don't express love over the phone.
I'll meet you in person. Bye.

148
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,644
Fine bye!

149
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,769
Did you come to pick up
a delivery or meet me?

150
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:00,715
Sorry!

151
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:10,685
Why do you look so low?

152
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,428
Santhosh had called from USA.

153
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,685
He's coming down to India.
- Oh

154
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,638
We will have to vacate
the house in 3 months.

155
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,019
This was expected.

156
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,102
Don't get upset,
we'll take care of it.

157
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:21,980
Fine, why are we
meeting for lunch today?

158
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,477
Sir, your order please?

159
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:27,519
What do you like to have?

160
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:28,860
Today it's your choice.

161
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,727
Do you have Stone fried rice?
- Yes we do.

162
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:33,897
Get me one chicken and one
mutton stone fried rice.

163
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,073
Make them spicy.
- Okay, sir.

164
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,644
Don't make it spicy.

165
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,331
Fine, make the mutton
spicy not the chicken.

166
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,310
Okay, sir.

167
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,394
How come you're
saying no to spicy?

168
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,935
That's how it's gonna be.

169
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,389
Why?
- I love spicy food.

170
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:52,769
But not sure,
if the baby likes it spicy too.

171
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:56,352
Hey, what did you just say?

172
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:00,644
I was saying,
you're going to be a father.

173
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,686
Damn you!

174
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,644
Why didn't you mention
it in the morning?

175
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,019
I went to the clinic on my way
to work and got it confirmed.

176
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,019
Not the right place
to convey this news.

177
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,894
Why do you look upset?

178
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:05,352
Nothing much,
got reminded of mom.

179
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:08,889
She must've been happy just like
this, when I was born.

180
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,935
Do you want to meet her?

181
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,685
I'll take you to her this evening.

182
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:14,674
Hey, not required

183
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:19,102
she came to our wedding and
insulted us in front of everyone.

184
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:23,852
Since then she never bothered
to know how we're doing

185
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,519
why should we go and meet her?

186
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,272
Once we're settled in our life

187
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,852
let them come to us with
a notion we're doing good.

188
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,185
Sir, bill.

189
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,185
We'll handle it.

190
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,227
Fine, I'll pick you
up in the evening.

191
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,102
Can I count on you?

192
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:48,373
If not for the trust,
you wouldn't have been with me.

193
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,136
So, be there around 8:30 pm.

194
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:54,769
I'll be there sharp at 8:15 pm.

195
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,199
Okay.

196
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,269
Fine, I'll drop you at your office.

197
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,019
My office is next block,
and you wanna drop me?

198
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,352
Then I shall carry you.

199
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,519
You might do it,
I'll rather go myself.

200
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,935
Come on, be careful.

201
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,685
You're overdoing it.

202
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,269
Hey Indhu, haven't you left yet?

203
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,351
No, my husband will pick me
up, you leave.

204
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,333
I'll be late.

205
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:50,894
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

206
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:12,894
Indhu!
Hey, Indhu!

207
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,894
What are you doing upstairs?
you left the door open.

208
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:18,310
Just 'cause I didn't
pick up the call.

209
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,060
Are you angry?

210
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,519
I'll explain, why I didn't make it

211
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,644
Hey, I'm talking to you.

212
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,935
Hey, why are you crying?

213
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,935
What happened?

214
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:33,894
Don't cry, what happened, Indhu?

215
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,102
Don't cry, I'm speaking
to you... what happened?

216
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,310
Please brother.

217
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,730
Give me your bag.

218
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,249
Please brother.
- Give me the bag.

219
00:23:58,329 --> 00:23:59,499
Please...
- Give the bag.

220
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:01,477
Check what is inside.

221
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:03,852
Remove your jewels.

222
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,043
Please brother
- Remove damn it.

223
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:07,989
Please...
- Damn it, remove.

224
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:09,102
Come on do it

225
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:10,519
Remove it.

226
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:12,685
Remove damn it!

227
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:17,199
It's fake.

228
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:20,519
Remove those bangles,
come on remove it.

229
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,060
This one is fake too.

230
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:31,227
What is that?
Remove that too...

231
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,185
This one is fake as well.

232
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:41,227
Hey, remove your chain.

233
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:42,962
Remove it
- That's my wedding chain.

234
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:44,852
Please...
- Remove damn it.

235
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,685
Please...
- I'll slit your throat.

236
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,362
Come on, remove that quick.

237
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:49,935
Remove it!

238
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,756
Brother that's...
- Give.

239
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:00,160
I said give it to me.
- It's my wedding chain.

240
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,100
Let it go, we'll take care of it.

241
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,894
Did they harm you?

242
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,316
That's not it, Prabhu.

243
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,019
Then why are you crying?

244
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:43,935
Start the bike.

245
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:45,935
Come on get on the bike.

246
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,602
Come on!

247
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:50,519
Brother!

248
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,060
Can I just hug her once?

249
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:11,496
Please...!

250
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,743
Please...!

251
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:31,814
It was my mistake.

252
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:34,102
I should've waited
for you at the office.

253
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:38,310
Don't sweat it,
I should've come earlier.

254
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:39,602
It's my mistake too.

255
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,477
Now why are you
crying for no reason?

256
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:42,855
I told you, we'll take care it.

257
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,894
Sir, don't you have any
sense, jumping in like this?

258
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,352
what If we had fallen down?

259
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,810
I don't have any sense?

260
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,189
Go, park your bike on
the side and get back.

261
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,269
Trying be to be
smart, wait and watch.

262
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:55,299
Sir!

263
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:56,657
Sir, sorry.

264
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,147
What's this?
- Insurance.

265
00:27:58,227 --> 00:27:59,348
I forgot to renew it.

266
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,474
This is a very lame excuse
think of something new.

267
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:03,730
Sir, I'm telling the truth.

268
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,307
Where do you work?
- I'm an IT professional.

269
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:07,292
You guys make good money

270
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:08,439
can't you guys renew
your insurance?

271
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,495
Sir, everything is under EMI.
- EMI is it?

272
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:11,769
Smartness doesn't
seem to recede.

273
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:15,230
Fine, I'll give you a receipt
for penalty of 3000 rupees

274
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,186
you can pay the same at the
court and pick up your bike.

275
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,189
Sorry, sir.

276
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,352
Sir, three guys
snatched my wife's chain.

277
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:22,814
I was in haste to
check who they were.

278
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,676
I was little worked up. Sorry, sir.

279
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,147
How do you guys
come up with this?

280
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:29,310
Lame excuses like chain and
mobile snatching, emergency

281
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:31,644
go and get your
vehicle documents.

282
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,165
What did he say?

283
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:39,897
He wants to check
vehicle documents.

284
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:42,576
Sir, I'm sorry.
Will definitely renew it tomorrow.

285
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,148
Sorry, sir. Please, sir.
- Listen,

286
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,544
it's getting late,
tell me how we can sort this?

287
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:47,906
We'll sort it out right here.

288
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,564
We'll sort it out, right here.

289
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,872
Shall we do that?
- Sure, sir.

290
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:52,310
How much cash do you have?

291
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,435
Sir, I must have
around 50-60 bucks.

292
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,814
You better pay the penalty
and pick up the bike.

293
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:57,394
Sir, sir...

294
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:58,560
Sir!

295
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,269
I have around 100-120 rupees.

296
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:03,897
Be careful, don't be rude.

297
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,402
I'll take care of
it, you wait here.

298
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,019
Are you recording this
on your mobile phone?

299
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:08,925
Is the camera on?
- No, sir.

300
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,337
It's better I'm
cautious about it.

301
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,302
Can't trust you
people these days.

302
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:14,865
Sir...

303
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:17,560
What is this?
- 100 rupees.

304
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,602
100 rupees, sir.

305
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:22,560
I thought you had 120 rupees?

306
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:24,102
That...
- Take it out.

307
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:28,235
Sir.

308
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,269
I shouldn't see you
in this area anymore.

309
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,685
Now get lost...
- Thank you, sir.

310
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:36,227
Sir, here is the Insurance,
RC book and license.

311
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,019
Sorry sir, it was unintentional.
- Wait out there.

312
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,185
Sir?

313
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,269
Sir...
- Go and wait out there.

314
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:46,939
Sir, penalize them if
they don't have documents

315
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,894
stop the chatter.
- Sure sir, I'm on it.

316
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:54,977
Stop the car.

317
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,144
Sir!

318
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,501
How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

319
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:03,019
It's been very long.

320
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,698
Coming from a Pub?
- Yeah, friends birthday party.

321
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:07,185
You're having fun

322
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:10,144
but we're stuck with
them on the road.

323
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,227
Fine, you can leave.
- Goodnight, sir.

324
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:14,769
Sir!

325
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,227
Sorry, sir!

326
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:19,598
It was my mistake
you jumped in, that's why

327
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,685
the papers are in
order, please let me go.

328
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,191
Wasn't you,
who said I have no sense?

329
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,769
As I have no sense,
that's how we do it.

330
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,727
Sir, that's not the case

331
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:31,439
i've given all the
documents, it's getting late

332
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:33,640
got to get home.
- Don't we have to get home?

333
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,730
I didn't mean to say that.

334
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,266
Are we here just to
stop and talk to you?

335
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,269
Sir, why do you
speak indifferently?

336
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:40,730
I've given the documents,

337
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,939
why have you been stalling me?

338
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,286
Prabhu.
- Trying to threaten me?

339
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:45,230
I wasn't yelling.

340
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,852
You didn't wear a helmet,
and were over speeding.

341
00:30:48,076 --> 00:30:49,980
When questioned,
you're being rude

342
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,602
it doesn't sound right.

343
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,852
Sir, you're doing this on purpose.

344
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:54,814
The papers are in order, tell the
penalty for not wearing the helmet.

345
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,965
I'll pay up.
- Prabhu!

346
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,730
Sir, you're not being fair

347
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,102
please speak with respect.
- How do you want me to speak?

348
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,894
Why are you stalling me,
when the papers are in order?

349
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,227
Fine hang up, I'll handle it.

350
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,602
What is the issue?
- Sir, he's been stalling me.

351
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,728
He was over speeding at the turn
no helmet and RC book.

352
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:46,939
I did give him the RC
book, he's lying.

353
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,894
Sir, I did...
- Lower your hand, lower it.

354
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,852
I said lower it.
- I did give him the RC Book.

355
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:52,843
Give me that.

356
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:04,519
Show me,
where is the RC book in it?

357
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,772
I did give him the RC book,
he's lying.

358
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:09,102
So you're accusing that
a policeman is lying?

359
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:11,772
That lie is not going
to fetch him a fortune.

360
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:14,227
Sir, I think he must be drunk.

361
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,397
Is it? Are you drunk?

362
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,727
Sir, I did give him the RC book.

363
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:20,060
I asked... are you drunk?

364
00:32:22,218 --> 00:32:24,185
I'm asking you a question,
and you're smiling sarcastically.

365
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,977
Egamabaram!
- I'm coming, sir.

366
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,102
Please wait here.

367
00:32:31,644 --> 00:32:32,519
Sir!

368
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,976
Blow into it.
- I'm not drunk.

369
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:39,141
You're not drunk right,
then blow into it.

370
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,935
Sir, change the pipe,
I'll blow into it.

371
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,352
Sir, change the pipe,
I'll blow into it.

372
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,019
It's been changed, blow into it.

373
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:48,060
Sir, you change it right here.
I'll do it.

374
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:50,894
Blow into it.

375
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,144
Sir, you're getting disrespectful.

376
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:57,258
Oh, so do you expect me
to address you as sir?

377
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,102
Am I not addressing you as, sir?

378
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,644
Sir, blow into it sir.

379
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,394
Please blow into it, sir.

380
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,188
I'll do it once you've
changed the pipe.

381
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:14,769
So, you won't blow into it.

382
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,323
Sathyan, what do we do with him?

383
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:32,269
You were drunk and over-speeding

384
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,560
and will lie about
giving us the RC Book.

385
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:41,102
If we ask about the helmet,
you'll give a lame excuse.

386
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,852
If we question you about it

387
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,286
you will be rude to us.

388
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,102
You get drunk and
be a nuisance to us.

389
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,977
You do things at your will

390
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,902
but we have to give you
due respect and salute.

391
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,185
Bloody Drunkard!

392
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,352
Bloody Drunkard!?

393
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:04,515
You've been wrongly accusing me
did you see me getting drunk?

394
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:08,727
Will anyone ride drunk,
when traveling with their wife.

395
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:13,852
Is she your wife?

396
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,352
Her?

397
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,727
As she was standing in a corner,
thought she was a hooker.

398
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:27,269
Sathyan, didn't you have
the same impression?

399
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,810
Were you her pimp then?

400
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,725
Sir.

401
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:35,769
What is it?

402
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:40,764
My friend Prabhu was
brought in last night that's why...

403
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,741
Prabhu? Who is that?
- No idea.

404
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:44,685
No idea.

405
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:49,256
Sir, last night there was an
issue while checking the documents.

406
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,230
The guy who locked
horns with the inspector?

407
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,310
Sir, what happened?
Can I see him?

408
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,851
No, you can't see him now.

409
00:36:56,989 --> 00:36:58,105
You leave now and come
back in the morning.

410
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,895
Sir, sir... Please, sir.
I'll just meet him once.

411
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:01,772
I said leave.
Come back in the morning.

412
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,769
Sir, please sir. My friend...

413
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:06,019
Don't you understand at once?

414
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,019
Inspector is damn pissed.

415
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,644
If you stay any longer
will lock you up as well.

416
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,144
Come on, get lost from here.

417
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:14,189
Sir, please sir...

418
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,480
Fine, come I'll lock you
up as well.

419
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,730
No, no, no...
- You can join him.

420
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,894
I'll come tomorrow.
- Get lost!

421
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:21,477
Get lost!

422
00:37:22,644 --> 00:37:23,769
Moron!

423
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,977
Doesn't have a sense of time,
barging into the police station.

424
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,352
Hello!

425
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:36,480
Brother what happened?
Did you meet him?

426
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:39,189
I did meet him.
He's locked up inside.

427
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:40,602
What are they saying?

428
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,116
Hope it's not an issue?

429
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,439
There's no problem though

430
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,526
they'll just threaten
and let him go.

431
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:48,685
I wanted to come to police station.

432
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,897
It won't be right for you to
come down to the police station.

433
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,689
That's why I asked
you to stay home.

434
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,810
Fine, I'll call you back later.

435
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:19,810
Sir, sir...
Please don't, it's hurting.

436
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:21,921
It's hurting.

437
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:29,685
Come over here.

438
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:32,435
I said come over here.

439
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:41,189
Sir, sir...

440
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,644
Sir...

441
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:49,555
Come over here.

442
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,269
Sir, it's hurting.

443
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:53,519
Come, damn it.

444
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:56,310
Come over here.

445
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:04,894
Sir.

446
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:07,753
Sorry, sir.

447
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,355
Sir, it's hurting.

448
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,196
You won't blow is it?
Come on do it now.

449
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,397
How dare you speak up to me?

450
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,060
Sir...

451
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:20,310
How dare you questioned me?

452
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,106
Sir, don't get worked up.

453
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:44,883
As it is there are too many
allegations against you,

454
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,726
if you get de-promoted

455
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,814
there's a group waiting
to celebrate it.

456
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:50,644
Please don't do this right now.

457
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:53,060
He called me a pimp, not you.

458
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,435
Sorry, sir.

459
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:37,227
You don't have to go there.

460
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:44,227
I'm saying right...

461
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:47,056
Listen...
- Sir!

462
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,519
You don't go over there.

463
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,560
Greetings, sir.
- Sir.

464
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,519
Sir...
- Hello, sir.

465
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:54,189
Murugesan, seems like
you were on night duty.

466
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:55,522
Ramaswamy was not keeping well

467
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:57,727
that's why I covered
for him last night.

468
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,352
So you take charge of
everything, without informing me.

469
00:41:00,435 --> 00:41:02,647
Sir, last night you
were quite worked up.

470
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,602
Sir. Sorry, sir.

471
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:26,727
I heard about you.

472
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:28,851
Do you have original
documents of the vehicle?

473
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:29,810
I have them, sir.

474
00:41:29,894 --> 00:41:30,980
Go and get it.

475
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,935
Sir, did he mention anything else?

476
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:34,435
Nothing else.

477
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:51,810
Prabhu. What happened Prabhu?

478
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,060
What happened?

479
00:41:58,102 --> 00:42:00,935
What happened Prabhu?
Hope the issue is resolved?

480
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,477
Nothing to worry.

481
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:05,102
Then?

482
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,519
They've asked me to come
back to the police station.

483
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:09,769
Why do you have to go again?

484
00:42:11,857 --> 00:42:14,144
They've asked for the original
documents of the vehicle.

485
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:18,727
I'll take a shower and leave.

486
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:22,394
Prabhu.

487
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:25,602
Did they beat
you up once again?

488
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:42,977
What else

489
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,894
you gonna show them the original
documents and get your bike.

490
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,519
Keeping locked up the
entire night won't scare us.

491
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,262
Buddy, you have no idea
what happened last night.

492
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:55,183
They threatened
to lock me up too.

493
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,060
Unlike you, I won't stay
silent if they lock me up.

494
00:42:58,264 --> 00:42:59,685
I would've made a
big issue out of it.

495
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:04,810
Fine, it's 10:00 am now.

496
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:05,894
I'm leaving.

497
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:07,435
I've just requested
for a day's leave.

498
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,185
You're well aware of that manager.

499
00:43:09,364 --> 00:43:10,602
He'll yell like a mad person.

500
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,269
Call me once you're done with it.

501
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:20,060
Sir.

502
00:43:21,514 --> 00:43:22,357
Sir.

503
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:24,310
Sir...

504
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,272
They had asked for original
documents of the vehicle.

505
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:28,201
Give it to me.

506
00:43:33,894 --> 00:43:35,060
Go and take a seat.

507
00:43:36,602 --> 00:43:38,227
Please go and take a seat.

508
00:43:59,843 --> 00:44:00,727
Sir.

509
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,822
Sir...

510
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,993
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

511
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,478
Get the file and come upstairs.
- Okay, sir.

512
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:37,314
Sir.

513
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:38,769
Where are you going?
- Military hotel.

514
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:41,073
Get me a Quail fry and
Chicken Biryani.

515
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:41,998
Okay, sir.

516
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:48,435
Sir, my husband gets drunk
and hits me black and blue.

517
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,060
Sir!

518
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:15,894
Are you still crying about it?

519
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:19,727
Listen, where are you from?
- Ramana Nagar, sir.

520
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,810
Did you eat?
- No, sir.

521
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:23,769
Just asking.

522
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,767
Tell me, I just punched in for duty.

523
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:48,725
I was clueless.

524
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,269
He was so stubborn

525
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:53,685
and his wife was ranting
the same nonsense

526
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:55,560
then inspector arrived at the spot

527
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,314
it was a mess.
- Sir!

528
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:59,019
Sir.

529
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,394
I've been waiting since morning,
when can I meet the inspector?

530
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:04,939
He will come, do you think
this is a railway station

531
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:06,769
to give you a
pre-planned schedule.

532
00:46:06,852 --> 00:46:09,227
Go and take a seat. He'll come.

533
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,935
Go and sit over there.

534
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,227
I heard it was all hot
and heavy out there

535
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,396
you guys are having
the time of your life.

536
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:31,977
It'll be great if could
pay off with higher bills.

537
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,977
It's easier to carry around.

538
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,595
Okay.

539
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:39,127
Okay, bye.

540
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:43,394
What is it?
Seems like everyone is having fun?

541
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,002
Senthil himself got
conned for a bribe.

542
00:46:46,082 --> 00:46:47,144
That's not the case, sir.

543
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,310
I got a headache

544
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,160
will reach home and
get a head massage.

545
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,189
I'm going home.

546
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:53,769
Sir!
- What is it?

547
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:55,727
I have given the original
documents of the vehicle.

548
00:46:56,435 --> 00:46:58,144
I have given the original
documents of the vehicle.

549
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,810
So...?

550
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,395
Sorry, sir.

551
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:10,352
Sorry for what?

552
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:13,852
What I said last night was
wrong, it was unintentional.

553
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,560
Isn't it wrong to speak
ill about a inspector?

554
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:21,519
It's wrong, sir. Sorry, sir.

555
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Sathyan!

556
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,144
Did you see that?

557
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:30,352
Murugesan!
- Sir.

558
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:32,060
Did you see that?

559
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:36,102
Senthil, sir.
- Sir.

560
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:38,310
Did you hear that?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,310
So, what you said...

562
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:43,480
What I spoke was wrong, sir.

563
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,769
What about I said?

564
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:47,394
No sir, what you said wasn't wrong.

565
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:49,602
So, what you said...

566
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:51,227
What I spoke was wrong, sir.

567
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,394
You agree,
what you said was wrong?

568
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:55,602
That's right,
what I said was wrong.

569
00:47:56,352 --> 00:47:59,935
Then, what I said was right?

570
00:48:09,144 --> 00:48:10,560
What I said...

571
00:48:12,227 --> 00:48:13,560
was correct, right?

572
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,258
Sir, check the documents and
give me my bike. I'm leaving.

573
00:48:19,338 --> 00:48:20,519
Damn it!

574
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,730
Made a mistake by
not filing an FIR

575
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,227
and you want your bike back.

576
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:33,935
Lower your eyes.

577
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,727
I said look down.

578
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,102
Look down, damn it.

579
00:48:43,096 --> 00:48:44,310
Leave from here.

580
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:46,642
Come on keep moving.

581
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,977
Get out!

582
00:48:52,548 --> 00:48:55,769
I'll make sure you don't
get your bike back.

583
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,011
It's been long,
come on make dosas soon.

584
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,087
Two cooks for namesake.

585
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,327
Pack those chutneys
- Okay, boss.

586
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:16,558
Why are you keeping it here?

587
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:19,685
What's up? Hello, brother.
- Welcome.

588
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:25,185
Brother, did the bike issue
got resolved?

589
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:27,269
Shut up and eat.

590
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,129
Buddy, what do you want to eat?

591
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:32,352
I don't want anything.

592
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:34,810
Master!
- Tell me, brother.

593
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,526
Get me 4 Dosas, and two omlettes.

594
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,525
Buddy, I've ordered
for you as well.

595
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,060
I don't want anything.

596
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,522
Please eat.

597
00:49:41,602 --> 00:49:44,522
Brother, eat and be
healthy to face the police.

598
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:46,779
You're hail and healthy
right, no wonder.

599
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:47,970
Do you want a half-boil?

600
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,507
Brother, stop kidding.

601
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:51,741
It's 11 pm and you're
still running your business.

602
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,185
Shut it down.
- I will sir, in a bit.

603
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:54,560
Shut it down.
- I will, sir.

604
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,520
Everyone leave from here.
Come on everyone leave.

605
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,022
What are you staring at?
Come on leave.

606
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:01,352
Ask him, what he wants.

607
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:05,536
Sir!
- 10 Parottas with mutton curry.

608
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:06,436
Okay, sir.

609
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:10,185
Brother, 10 Parottas
with mutton curry.

610
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:12,227
Did you see that?

611
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:15,060
Just 10 Parottas
with mutton curry.

612
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,352
150 rupees, that's their worth.

613
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:22,394
There is a saying right...

614
00:50:24,094 --> 00:50:27,370
If it's money,
even the dead will be lured.

615
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,105
Whoever quoted this
first in the world

616
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:30,769
how do you think,
he would've found out?

617
00:50:31,602 --> 00:50:33,012
It must be people like him.

618
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,810
Talk softly, he might hear you.

619
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,435
Do you have 100
bucks in your pocket?

620
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,609
If so, we can scream into his ears.

621
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:41,602
Stop kidding around.

622
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,144
Shall I say something.

623
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:47,642
Two things which you shouldn't
let the police be aware of...

624
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:49,088
One... Dear on your face.

625
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:50,874
Two... Money in your pocket.

626
00:50:51,096 --> 00:50:54,144
If at all they get a whiff of either

627
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,480
that's it, they'll rip
your pants down.

628
00:50:56,628 --> 00:50:58,935
Especially during the
night and late hours

629
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,814
it's better get mugged
than encounter a police.

630
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,935
At least our pants
will be spared.

631
00:51:05,102 --> 00:51:06,769
Am I right?
- Yes.

632
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:07,767
Sir.

633
00:51:09,205 --> 00:51:11,144
Better shut it down in an hour.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:14,230
It's late leave from here.

635
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,019
You got your parcel,
first you leave.

636
00:51:17,352 --> 00:51:19,348
Did you see the
righteous police.

637
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:23,310
The Nation is cursed
with such samples.

638
00:51:28,102 --> 00:51:29,477
Where are you?

639
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,386
Why are you not taking my calls?

640
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,102
Tell me, I'm outside.

641
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:35,060
Fine, what did they say
at the police station?

642
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:37,102
They've asked me
to come tomorrow.

643
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:40,019
When will you come home?

644
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,352
I'll come tomorrow.

645
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:44,644
I know why you've been
behaving like this.

646
00:51:45,715 --> 00:51:48,683
You still haven't forgotten
the incident from last night.

647
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,458
It's 'cause they beat
you up in front of me

648
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:55,374
you're not speaking
to me properly.

649
00:51:57,977 --> 00:52:01,227
Hey, I'm your Indhu please...

650
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,852
Come home.

651
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,894
Indhu, please.

652
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:09,570
I'll come tomorrow,
you go to sleep.

653
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:11,269
Prabhu!

654
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,394
Sir, he's my friend,
please consider.

655
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:31,602
Sir, hello... Sir, sir.

656
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:36,026
Buddy, he's overdoing it.

657
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:37,519
He's bluntly refusing.

658
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:39,519
He said gotta resume
work from evening.

659
00:52:39,797 --> 00:52:41,394
If not he'll sack you.

660
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,435
Buddy, let me tell you something

661
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,977
that inspector is
extremely pissed with you

662
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:51,894
it's better if you don't go
to police station for a while.

663
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:54,687
Let's not blow this
out of proportion.

664
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:57,019
Forget about that
vehicle for a while.

665
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:59,477
My friend Babu, who is abroad

666
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:01,769
his bike is available,
no one is using it.

667
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:03,810
I'll speak to him and get it.
You can use it for a while.

668
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:09,573
Why did you stop the
bike, what happened?

669
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,505
You leave.

670
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:13,772
I just said use my
friend's bike for a while.

671
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:17,477
If I do that, do you think my bike
at the Station will come to me?

672
00:53:18,106 --> 00:53:20,164
I bought that bike
from hard earned money.

673
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,435
I didn't do anything wrong.

674
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:26,352
I know how to take my
bike out of the station.

675
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:28,060
I'll come back with my
bike, you leave.

676
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:30,144
Fine, don't get worked up.
- You better leave.

677
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:43,644
'I'll make sure you don't
get your bike back.'

678
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:14,269
How dare you
questioned my sense?

679
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,769
Just wait and watch,
I'll thrash you.

680
00:54:19,731 --> 00:54:21,212
At least control your urge to drink,

681
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,424
until your child
completes education.

682
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:24,185
You'll end up dead,
if you keep drinking.

683
00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:25,499
Narayana!
- Tell me, sir.

684
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:27,935
What's the balance?
- As if you're going to clear it.

685
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:28,883
Sir!

686
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:30,999
When will the inspector be here?

687
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:32,454
He will be here
soon, please wait.

688
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:34,381
Sir, I haven't been
to work for 3 days.

689
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,602
I have no job without a bike.

690
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:37,227
What do you expect me to do?

691
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:38,602
You don't seem to understand.

692
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:40,352
Sir, don't you people
have conscience?

693
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,519
Has public become a
joke to you people?

694
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:46,644
Son, don't generalize
the conscience.

695
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,907
There are many policemen
who have conscience.

696
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,810
Just 'cause a thief
looted a jewelry shop

697
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:58,189
an officer got shot
dead while nabbing him

698
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,810
don't you think
he has conscience?

699
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:04,439
Excavating sand illegally
without a permit

700
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:06,602
he stood his ground
alone and fought

701
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:09,939
a police officer was
killed in that process

702
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:11,394
don't you think
he has conscience?

703
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,912
Let that be, a police officer how he
sacrificed his life during the flood

704
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:18,560
don't you think
he has conscience?

705
00:55:19,276 --> 00:55:21,756
Tsunami, earthquakes,
fire accidents

706
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:25,363
in order to save the people
they forget about their own families

707
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:26,957
there are many police officers

708
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:29,500
who work day and night
with pure conscience.

709
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:34,617
Son, there are police officers
with good conscience

710
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:37,102
also there are people who with
no conscience among the public.

711
00:55:38,183 --> 00:55:40,477
If someone is lying
hurt on the road

712
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,685
tell me, how many will come
forward to help that person.

713
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:47,460
These days they
abandon their parents

714
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,458
but live with cats and dogs in
their Air conditioned apartments.

715
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,374
Conscience is just
like weather...

716
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:57,230
It keeps changing.

717
00:55:57,415 --> 00:55:59,810
It adapts to the circumstances.

718
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:03,394
We see many guys
like you everyday.

719
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,310
We're used to it now.

720
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,570
Son, justice and integrity

721
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,685
is not shiny like
it appears to be.

722
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:15,602
Law wags its tail as
a pet for the riches

723
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:18,477
but for the poor a rabid dog.

724
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:20,310
It will shred you to pieces.

725
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,480
Then, what about the inspector?

726
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,977
Is he the tail wagging
or the rabid dog?

727
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,602
Sir, this is Tambram
murder case file

728
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,689
the case where son
killed his father.

729
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,310
If you sign it,
I'll hand it over to the court.

730
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:11,852
Sir, we got calls from
Commissioner's office

731
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:14,501
they tried calling you on
mobile, it was switched off

732
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:15,769
that's why they
called over here.

733
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:18,519
What else, must be checking
if the list is ready.

734
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:23,316
What is it?

735
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,814
Sir, about that boy...

736
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:25,939
Which boy?

737
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:28,435
It's that bike matter.

738
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:32,852
Sir, I feel really sorry
looking at that boy.

739
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:34,769
It's been 3 days
since he went to work

740
00:57:35,144 --> 00:57:36,840
he's scared that will lose his job.

741
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:39,967
What is it Murugesan?

742
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:42,519
Did you rake in
something on the side?

743
00:57:43,537 --> 00:57:45,852
I have respect only for
you in this entire station.

744
00:57:46,097 --> 00:57:46,977
Don't spoil it.

745
00:57:47,282 --> 00:57:48,189
You can leave.

746
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,646
Sir, I'm telling you
for your own good.

747
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:53,839
kids these days end up taking
their lives due to pressure.

748
00:57:53,977 --> 00:57:55,669
What if this boy does the same?

749
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:57,519
Then the blame will be on you.

750
00:57:57,983 --> 00:57:59,644
I totally understand your anger.

751
00:58:00,094 --> 00:58:01,269
Nothing should go wrong.

752
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,185
That's why I'm suggesting this

753
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:11,599
Sir!

754
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:14,602
Ask him to leave.
- Sir?

755
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:16,269
Ask him to leave.

756
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:17,644
Okay, sir.

757
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:20,185
Murugesan!
- Sir.

758
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:23,269
Not 'cause I'm scared.
For your sake.

759
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,060
Okay, sir.

760
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,334
Sir!

761
00:58:43,414 --> 00:58:45,693
Son, I spoke to the
inspector about your matter

762
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,810
you can collect your bike
keys, documents and leave.

763
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:49,199
Sir?

764
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:51,394
Don't be standing
here, leave sooner.

765
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:54,547
Moideen, give his belongings
so that he can leave.

766
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:55,676
Okay, sir.
- Thanks.

767
00:58:55,756 --> 00:58:56,600
Go.

768
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,060
What's your name?
- Prabhu.

769
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:11,102
Sign here and put down
your phone number.

770
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,124
Pick yours.

771
00:59:21,413 --> 00:59:22,560
Check for your keys and take it.

772
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:29,846
Is this the one?
- Yes it is.

773
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:32,096
Don't pick the expensive bike
- No sir, it's mine.

774
00:59:32,705 --> 00:59:33,519
Sir, where is the bike?

775
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:35,269
Check out back.
- Thank you, sir.

776
01:00:29,489 --> 01:00:30,438
Tell me, Indhu.

777
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,435
I'm leaving from the Station.

778
01:00:33,988 --> 01:00:35,102
Yes, I got the bike.

779
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:37,586
I'll be there in an hour.

780
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:38,965
Yes.

[Indistinct chatter]

782
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:00,519
What are you looking for?

783
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,782
Petrol!
- Petrol?

784
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,402
Check if it's got an engine.

785
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,019
Buddy, he's really looking for it.

786
01:01:09,727 --> 01:01:12,291
It's there.
- You're lucky, keep moving.

787
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:15,558
I'm surprised though,
that the engine is intact.

788
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:16,708
Might've reformed.

Murugesan sir,
asked me to leave.

I'm aware of it, come over here.

793

Sir it was him,
who asked me to leave.

Come over here.

Can I just make one call?

Please sir, just one call.

814
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:55,740
You don't deserve a call
for the thing you've done.

815
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:58,115
It's better,
you shut up and sit down.

- Where are you headed?

817

SI sir, had asked us to come.

818

That doesn't mean,
you can walk right in.

819

Heard your daughter
is getting married.

That's right.

How come you didn't invite us?

825
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,210
Why would I invite you

the wedding instead of

be more worried about their jewels.

are barging into ours.

01:05:29,448 --> 01:05:31,865
I believe that Pisiri Giri
must be the guy behind it.

843
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:34,886
Gopal is the one who
draws out jobs for us.

844
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:38,365
He did warn us, stating that
Giri is coming into our area.

this, speak to SI.

Two months ago, near Lakshmi temple
10 sovereigns of gold was stolen.

850
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:55,070
We're still not able to track that.

a lot of pressure.

Okay, sir.

853
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:00,599
Should I start from the beginning,

854
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:01,785
or can I jump straight
to the matter?

01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:04,365

861
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,819
After I got out,
started with petty crimes

862
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:20,990

my father is no more.

870
01:06:35,976 --> 01:06:38,824
I smashed a guy's head
concerning my father's murder.

871
01:06:38,904 --> 01:06:40,367
Since then I was
put in Kellys home.

872

That's where we became friends.

873
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:44,200
Since then, we've been
partners in all the crimes.

874
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,535
Even during this
week on the ICF road

875
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:46,910

Also we were the guys who
flicked the laptop at Otteri.

We stole the mobile phone
at Kolathur Ganga theater.

879
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:55,445
We did all of it,
in order for investigation.

880
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:57,198
I agree to have
done all the crimes.

881
01:07:02,615 --> 01:07:03,612
Is everything over?

882
01:07:03,692 --> 01:07:05,035
It's done, but

883
01:07:05,115 --> 01:07:07,677
their crimes doesn't
tally the list we have.

884
01:07:07,894 --> 01:07:09,240
We're not lying.

885
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:10,531
Do you want me to believe it?

886
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:13,535
Are you guys running
something on the side?

887
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:15,365
Sir, sir... nothing of that sort.

888
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,948
Look, we didn't get anything
from you guys last month

889
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,948
neither we received
anything this month.

890
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:24,115
Your crimes and the complaints
doesn't tally though.

891
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:26,031
So what you guys can do

892
01:07:26,323 --> 01:07:29,240
by tomorrow,
compensate for the two months.

893
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:31,240
Sir...

894
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:33,490
Inspector is very
pissed with you guys.

895
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:34,740
Remember that.

896
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,243
Sir.

897
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:38,613
Give these guys the
new account number.

898
01:07:38,693 --> 01:07:41,031
Sir... the work
these days is quite dull.

899
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:43,495
By tomorrow the account
should be credited.

900
01:07:43,633 --> 01:07:46,115
If not, the video which
we just recorded

901
01:07:46,198 --> 01:07:48,243
I'll use that and sentence you
guys to prison for 10 years.

902
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:49,757
Sir... Please don't
do anything of that sort.

903
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:51,044
So better credit it tomorrow.

904
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:53,448
Leave, come on get lost.
- Okay, sir.

905
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:54,483
We're leaving, sir.

906
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:58,156
Did you get everything?
- Yes we got it.

907
01:07:58,573 --> 01:08:01,031
To tally their account, wonder
how many throats we gotta slit.

908
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:02,490
Start the bike.

909
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,781
'Oh no, that's her.
Why is she coming over here?'

910
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,823
'Thank goodness,
she didn't see us.'

911
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,115
Sir.

912
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:43,240
Sir.

913
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:46,615
Sir.
- Indhu, Indhu.

914
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,240
Prabhu!

915
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:52,687
What happened to you?

916
01:08:53,446 --> 01:08:55,073
Why did you come over here?

917
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:57,243
You better leave from here.

918
01:08:57,323 --> 01:08:58,615
What have they done to you?

919
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,701
Listen Indhu
please leave from here

920
01:09:01,781 --> 01:09:03,323
Why have they made
you sit like this?

921
01:09:03,406 --> 01:09:04,990
Listen to me,
please leave from here.

922
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:07,910
No!
- Madam, please leave from here.

923
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,868
What is this sir?
Why is he in this state?

924
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:10,781
Please leave.

925
01:09:10,906 --> 01:09:12,365
What was his mistake?

926
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,162
Listen, inspector will be here,
please leave.

927
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:16,843
You first leave and get home.

928
01:09:16,923 --> 01:09:18,531
Please listen to
me, leave from here.

929
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:21,115
Indhu, please listen to me.

930
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:22,993
I said leave,
please leave from here.

931
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:24,698
Indhu, please listen to me.

932
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,865
What is this girl doing here?

933
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,535
Get out.

934
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:34,576
Sir, why should I leave from here?

935
01:09:34,656 --> 01:09:37,031
What has he done, that you've
been treating him like this?

936
01:09:37,459 --> 01:09:38,615
Tell me, sir.

937
01:09:38,865 --> 01:09:40,063
I said leave.

938
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:42,115
Get out. You sit down.

939
01:09:42,195 --> 01:09:44,115
Dam it, I said sit down.
- Sir.

940
01:09:45,156 --> 01:09:46,281
Sit down, damn it.

941
01:09:46,531 --> 01:09:48,118
Don't you people have conscience?

942
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:50,656
If you don't leave now

943
01:09:50,823 --> 01:09:52,990
I'll strip him naked
and beat him up

944
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,198
do you wanna see?

945
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:59,656
Leave, leave damn it.

946
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,448
Get lost!

947
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:08,073
What's wrong with you guys?

948
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,365
Sit down.
Sit down, damn it.

949
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:12,656
Sit, damn it!

950
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,406
Sir... Please don't.
- Sit down.

951
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:19,990
Be fair to your job.

952
01:10:57,698 --> 01:10:58,948
Read me the list.

953
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:02,406
Sir...

954
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:04,198
Kumar, Shankar, Kamaraj,

955
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:06,240
Shekar, Vetrivel for the night duty.

956
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,578
Sathyan, are you done
with the shift?

957
01:11:14,658 --> 01:11:16,490
I don't mind staying back, sir.

958
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:19,865
Who's on for night rounds?
- It's you, sir.

959
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,573
You take care of it.
- Sir?

960
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,354
You take care of it tonight.

961
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:26,755
Sir!

962
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:32,176
Sathyan, Shekar and Kamaraj.
Ask them to stay.

963
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:34,448
The rest can leave.
- Okay, sir.

964
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:54,448
What are you looking at?

965
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:55,698
Eat!

966
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:01,383
Do you want it too?
- No sir, I don't.

967
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:05,823
Finish your meal soon.

968
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:55,531
I'm at the station,
I'll call you back.

969
01:13:55,823 --> 01:13:59,115
I'm at the police station,
I'll call you back.

970
01:13:59,323 --> 01:14:00,281
Hang up the phone.

971
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,615
Don't get down there.

972
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,073
Look out, that's Pochiniki.

973
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:07,990
Don't get there,
it's tainted with blood.

974
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:09,615
I did warn you, damn it.

975
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:13,448
Come on lay low, just like that.
I'm down too.

976
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:15,031
Run, run... Run faster.

977
01:14:15,115 --> 01:14:16,823
Go faster, pick up the pace.

978
01:14:17,573 --> 01:14:18,781
Fine let that go.

979
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:20,490
You pick the 9mm bullet.

980
01:14:21,115 --> 01:14:22,573
I'll take the 7mm.

981
01:14:23,682 --> 01:14:24,948
Go faster!

982
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:26,660
There's someone chasing you.

983
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,607
I got in, I'm inside a house.

984
01:14:29,429 --> 01:14:31,107
There's a girl and
boy, is it them?

985
01:14:31,187 --> 01:14:33,286
The guy in white shirt,
I'll shoot him down.

986
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:34,566
I'll take care of him,
you take the scope.

987
01:14:34,646 --> 01:14:37,198
I'll kill them both,
I'll kill them.

988
01:14:37,823 --> 01:14:39,115
Oh come on, damn it!

989
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:50,948
Just got killed,
'cause I was distracted

990
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:54,073
next time I should nab the
chicken dinner for sure.

991
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:58,240
This game has turned
me into a mad person.

992
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:02,406
The kids are on leave.

993
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:04,883
It's a game, they call it 'FUKG'

994
01:15:04,963 --> 01:15:06,031
PUBG!

995
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:07,781
Fine, 'G' of some kind.

996
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:10,031
Okay, what is the matter?

997
01:15:10,584 --> 01:15:12,167
Sir, aren't you aware?

998
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:14,406
Why does a lawyer comes
to meet a policeman?

999
01:15:14,805 --> 01:15:17,157
That's what I don't
know, tell me.

1000
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:18,783
Can you tell me under what case
her husband has been booked?

1001
01:15:18,863 --> 01:15:20,531
Can I have a look
at the FIR copy?

1002
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:24,531
So you haven't filed an FIR?

1003
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:28,698
Hope you're aware of the
consequences if FIR is not filed?

1004
01:15:30,078 --> 01:15:31,653
In this case,
we can file an FIR against you.

1005
01:15:31,733 --> 01:15:32,906
Do you know that?

1006
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:37,740
What do you think of yourself?

1007
01:15:38,232 --> 01:15:40,823
You can't just lock up anyone
for your personal grudge.

1008
01:15:41,124 --> 01:15:42,948
Do you think,
there's no one to question?

1009
01:15:48,865 --> 01:15:49,865
Look here...

1010
01:15:50,365 --> 01:15:51,615
this is my station

1011
01:15:51,782 --> 01:15:53,323
you shouldn't raise
your voice here

1012
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:55,448
only I'm allowed to
raise my voice here.

1013
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:59,448
As he's young I felt pity
and didn't file an FIR.

1014
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:02,781
Who's out there?

1015
01:16:03,304 --> 01:16:04,687
Bring me that FIR book.

1016
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:07,092
Sir, ask him not to file an FIR.

1017
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:09,073
Please sir, his life will be ruined.

1018
01:16:09,406 --> 01:16:11,250
You don't worry,
nothing of that sort will happen.

1019
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,715
Damn it! I asked you
to get me the FIR book.

1020
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:15,903
Please sir, don't file an FIR.

1021
01:16:15,983 --> 01:16:18,126
His life and our
future will be ruined.

1022
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,341
Please, don't file an FIR.

1023
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:23,480
Don't be scared,
I've seen many antics like this.

1024
01:16:24,156 --> 01:16:25,384
Sir!
- Sathyan!

1025
01:16:25,464 --> 01:16:27,281
Please, tell him...
- Sir!?

1026
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:28,880
Sir, please tell him.

1027
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,156
Please sir, don't file an FIR.

1028
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:32,531
Please.

1029
01:16:32,914 --> 01:16:34,073
Please wait outside.

1030
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,281
Wait outside.

1031
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,031
Please wait outside,
I'll call you.

1032
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:57,531
Sir, you're not even aware of
what he did and have been ranting.

1033
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:00,409
Do you know what he did?

1034
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:38,860
Tell me, what's the issue?

1035
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,011
My bike is missing.

1036
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:41,108
Doesn't mean you come straight to

1037
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:42,684
Commissioner's office
to file a complaint.

1038
01:17:43,906 --> 01:17:46,240
Which area?
- Madha Nagar.

1039
01:17:46,759 --> 01:17:48,365
Madha Nagar...

1040
01:17:48,445 --> 01:17:51,144
It's K-12 Station, you should've
gone there to complaint.

1041
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:54,283
No sir, in fact bike went
missing in Ramana Nagar.

1042
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,667
You're aware right

1043
01:17:55,747 --> 01:17:57,967
then it's K-11,
should've gone there to complaint.

1044
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:05,031
Sir, my bike went missing
from K-11 police station.

1045
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:09,594
And I'm here to file a complain
on that station's inspector

1046
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:11,448
Kannabiran!

1047
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:18,198
Great, filing a complaint against an
inspector at Commissioner's office.

1048
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:20,281
That too for a bike theft case.

1049
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:24,948
Youngster of this
generation are very agile.

1050
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,156
All you need is
someone to instigate

1051
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,605
never think twice

1052
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,957
head straight to complaint
against the police

1053
01:18:32,037 --> 01:18:34,404
Sir, no one has
instigated me to do this.

1054
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:36,281
I'm here for my own issue.

1055
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:37,674
For God sake, take my complaint.

1056
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:38,894
No need for a complaint.

1057
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:40,901
I'll speak to him,
you'll get your bike.

1058
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:44,982
Look, I'm not aware what happened
or what you did out there.

1059
01:18:45,181 --> 01:18:47,429
I'll speak to that inspector,
you'll get your bike. Leave!

1060
01:18:47,594 --> 01:18:50,292
Sir, are you going to
file my complaint

1061
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:53,240
or shall I wait and file the
same with the Commissioner.

1062
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:56,650
Sampath... did you see that?

1063
01:18:56,909 --> 01:18:58,499
What's your name?
- Prabhu!

1064
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:00,531
Sit down!

1065
01:19:05,688 --> 01:19:09,365
Look here... the inspector against
whom you're filing an complaint

1066
01:19:09,531 --> 01:19:10,698
he's my batch mate.

1067
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,451
He'll listen to me.

1068
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:15,186
Agreed he's short
tempered, I'll talk to him.

1069
01:19:15,826 --> 01:19:18,092
You'll get your bike for
sure, understood?

1070
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:20,573
Sir, a small request

1071
01:19:21,146 --> 01:19:22,225
they're giving me a run around

1072
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:23,893
I'm a food delivery guy

1073
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,768
I have no job without a bike.

1074
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,198
I totally understand
your problem.

1075
01:19:28,355 --> 01:19:29,504
You trust me right?
- I do.

1076
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:31,946
Good, you'll definitely
get your bike.

1077
01:19:32,098 --> 01:19:33,247
You head straight to
the police station

1078
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:35,060
I'll definitely talk him.
- Okay, sir.

1079
01:19:35,454 --> 01:19:36,520
Thanks a lot, sir.

1080
01:19:36,907 --> 01:19:38,176
Murugesan!
- Sir!

1081
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:41,448
Not 'cause I'm
scared, for your sake.

1082
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,406
Okay, sir.

1083
01:19:58,406 --> 01:19:59,531
Tell me, Sekar.

1084
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:01,608
I'll send you the list
in next 15 minutes.

1085
01:20:01,688 --> 01:20:04,990
That's fine, it's become very
tough to get a hold of you.

1086
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:07,385
Your mobile is
always switched off.

1087
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:09,123
When we reach out to Station,
you're not available.

1088
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,115
Did you go underground?

1089
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:13,323
Nothing like that, Sekar.

1090
01:20:14,121 --> 01:20:15,948
Okay, tell me who is
this guy Prabhu?

1091
01:20:16,028 --> 01:20:17,061
He filed a bike theft complaint

1092
01:20:17,141 --> 01:20:18,384
against you at
Commissioner's office.

1093
01:20:18,464 --> 01:20:20,240
What's going on over there?

1094
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:23,409
If this complaint had
reached Commissioner

1095
01:20:23,489 --> 01:20:26,851
then you can stay home with
phone switched off forever.

1096
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,405
How dare he filed an complaint

1097
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:32,156
against you at the
commissioner's office?

1098
01:20:33,126 --> 01:20:35,781
Public is not the same anymore.

1099
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:40,615
Check what he wants and handle
it at your station itself.

1100
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:56,406
Sir, what did they say?

1101
01:20:56,486 --> 01:20:57,906
Sir, what happened?

1102
01:20:58,198 --> 01:20:59,365
Nothing to worry.

1103
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:01,490
They'll let him go.

1104
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:05,660
You check all the documents
and collect the bike.

1105
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,030
Okay, sir. What about the FIR?

1106
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:09,781
They didn't file an
FIR, so not to worry.

1107
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,365
Prabhu!

1108
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:46,906
Listen.

1109
01:22:48,156 --> 01:22:49,573
Hope you won't return.

1110
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:51,865
Go!

1111
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:55,156
Get lost!

1112
01:22:56,655 --> 01:22:58,115
You take him home.

1113
01:23:01,516 --> 01:23:04,197
Brother, ride safe. Careful.

1114
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:19,281
Every husband and wife

1115
01:23:19,698 --> 01:23:23,008
a moment which
should've been cherished

1116
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:27,198
we missed out on that,
due to this issue.

1117
01:23:57,648 --> 01:23:58,781
Okay.

1118
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:03,115
What happened?

1119
01:24:05,293 --> 01:24:07,198
What happened?
- Sathish.

1120
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:10,740
They fired me.

1121
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:16,531
That's fine, we'll manage.

1122
01:24:21,327 --> 01:24:22,823
You just lost a job.

1123
01:24:23,913 --> 01:24:26,823
I'm there right,
we'll get through this.

1124
01:28:38,141 --> 01:28:39,265
I'm hungry!

1125
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:42,531
What do you want?
- What's available?

1126
01:28:43,806 --> 01:28:45,198
What are you thinking about?

1127
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,508
Is Dosa fine with you?
- Okay.

1128
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:49,823
Wait.

1129
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:54,281
Tell me, Priya.

1130
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:06,698
Hey, what are you looking for?

1131
01:29:07,031 --> 01:29:09,323
Indhu what happened?

1132
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:11,378
I'm speaking to you...

1133
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:16,800
'In Chennai a video of an youngster
getting beaten up by police'

1134
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,293
'has gone viral on Twitter,
Whatsapp and Facebook.'

1135
01:29:22,373 --> 01:29:26,031
'Viewers can have a look at that
recorded video on news now.'

1136
01:30:17,906 --> 01:30:19,535
'In regards to this video'

1137
01:30:19,615 --> 01:30:22,948
'Inspector Kannabiran of
Ramana Nagar police station'

1138
01:30:23,031 --> 01:30:25,365
'is on phone with us for
to comment on the same.'

1139
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:27,043
'Hello.
- Hello.'

1140
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:28,620
'Greetings, Mr. Kannabiran.'

1141
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,869
'Greetings, sir. Can you hear me?'

1142
01:30:30,949 --> 01:30:31,900
'Yes, I can hear you.'

1143
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:35,735
'The video of you beating a youngster
treacherously has gone viral.'

1144
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:39,000
'What's the reason, which
made you take such extreme measure?'

1145
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,156
'What exactly was his crime?'

1146
01:30:41,673 --> 01:30:43,201
'It's not just a question from us'

1147
01:30:43,281 --> 01:30:47,035
'but a question from the people of
Tamilnadu who have seen this video.'

1148
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,990
'Please state a
valid reason for it.'

1149
01:30:49,698 --> 01:30:54,198
'Usually police is there
to keep the rogues in control.'

1150
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:57,665
'If a drunkard does the
same with the police'

1151
01:30:57,745 --> 01:30:59,448
'how do you expect
us to stay calm?'

1152
01:30:59,813 --> 01:31:01,656
'I'm not public to stay calm.'

1153
01:31:01,951 --> 01:31:04,476
'I'm a police officer,
that too an honest one.'

1154
01:31:04,995 --> 01:31:08,348
'Mr. Kannabiran,
your reply is not convincing'

1155
01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:10,459
'can you just elaborate and
put it in simple terms?'

1156
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:11,919
Let me ask you one thing

1157
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:13,963
if a drunkard creates
a scene at your doorstep.

1158
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,323
What will you do?

1159
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:17,281
You'll end up beating him up

1160
01:31:17,615 --> 01:31:20,448
or you will call the police
and ask to do the same?

1161
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,323
That's what I did.

1162
01:31:22,656 --> 01:31:24,365
It's a very simple matter.

1163
01:31:24,716 --> 01:31:26,448
Not a matter to take seriously.

1164
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:29,431
Someone recorded a video
and passed it on to media.

1165
01:31:30,114 --> 01:31:32,181
I've seen a lot of
videos of this sort.

1166
01:31:32,691 --> 01:31:34,343
I'm doing an investigation on that.

1167
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:36,298
I will find out soon
- 'Okay, sir.'

1168
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:40,424
'Thank you for your time.'
- Thank you, thank you...

1169
01:31:41,601 --> 01:31:43,698
They'll torture us,
to increase their TRP.

1170
01:31:46,406 --> 01:31:47,323
Sir!

1171
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:51,073
The issue has become
bigger than we expected.

1172
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,268
when you asked me to record the
video, I didn't understand.

1173
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:56,146
I did it, 'cause you asked me to.

1174
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:57,948
But now I get it

1175
01:31:58,028 --> 01:31:59,845
you literally tarnished his image.

1176
01:31:59,925 --> 01:32:01,990
He can't show his
face to the society.

1177
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:05,656
But the media is blowing
this out of proportion.

1178
01:32:05,906 --> 01:32:08,750
But I believe,
you'll handle it with ease.

1179
01:32:11,283 --> 01:32:14,749
Public, once were scared of
even a watchman in a Khakee

1180
01:32:15,317 --> 01:32:17,448
but now they step up against
us, why do you think so?

1181
01:32:17,946 --> 01:32:19,531
It's all 'cause of
the Social Media.

1182
01:32:19,939 --> 01:32:21,906
So, I used the same media

1183
01:32:22,672 --> 01:32:24,406
and conveyed the consequences
of messing with the police.

1184
01:32:28,115 --> 01:32:29,823
They're so used to smart phones

1185
01:32:30,523 --> 01:32:32,235
even if the police is calm

1186
01:32:32,315 --> 01:32:35,720
they instigate us, and
record a video of us beating them

1187
01:32:35,936 --> 01:32:38,141
then post them on Whatsapp,
Facebook and Twitter.

1188
01:32:38,221 --> 01:32:39,387
If we question them

1189
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:42,573
they sloganeer on social media
about police atrocities.

1190
01:32:42,919 --> 01:32:44,448
Do they peck us for their servants?

1191
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:47,198
That's why I let them
continue shouting.

1192
01:32:47,448 --> 01:32:49,531
The fear of police is fading
away, Sathyan.

1193
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:53,073
They have to fear the police.

1194
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,573
Sir, but what about
Human Rights Commission?

1195
01:32:57,406 --> 01:33:00,281
A criminal can't think
like a police officer.

1196
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:03,365
But a police officer can
think like an Criminal.

1197
01:33:18,423 --> 01:33:21,260
'Brother, why did they beat you?
I saw on Facebook.'

1198
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,910
'They've beat him like animals.'

1199
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:24,285
'Isn't you in that video?'

1200
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:25,701
'What's your problem
with the police?'

1201
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:27,448
'No one will beat for no reason.'

1202
01:33:27,528 --> 01:33:29,240
'That guy is a poor thing.'

1203
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,900
'Why are you locking
horns with the police?'

1204
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:36,140
'Police officers
doesn't have conscience.'

1205
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:40,448
[Indistinct background voice over]

1206
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,948
'Buddy, seems like they
whacked you royally.'

1207
01:33:43,594 --> 01:33:45,198
'Don't be disrespectful.'

1208
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:48,437
[Indistinct background voice over]

1209
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:50,781
'Police officers
doesn't have conscience.'

1210
01:34:10,287 --> 01:34:11,323
Prabhu!

1211
01:34:12,426 --> 01:34:13,490
Prabhu!

1212
01:34:16,115 --> 01:34:19,024
Prabhu, you've been getting a
call from an unknown number.

1213
01:34:21,592 --> 01:34:23,406
Next time pick up
and check who is it.

1214
01:34:23,767 --> 01:34:24,615
Okay.

1215
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:39,990
Hello!

1216
01:34:46,156 --> 01:34:47,573
Did you get a call again?

1217
01:34:48,173 --> 01:34:49,240
Yes, it did.

1218
01:34:49,865 --> 01:34:50,823
Who was it?

1219
01:34:52,781 --> 01:34:54,990
It was from K-12 police station.

1220
01:34:56,656 --> 01:34:59,240
They asked you to
come to the station.

1221
01:35:01,656 --> 01:35:03,781
K-12 police station....?

1222
01:35:31,906 --> 01:35:33,890
What's your name?
- Prabhu, madam.

1223
01:35:35,615 --> 01:35:37,813
Father's name?
- Saravanan.

1224
01:35:38,323 --> 01:35:39,615
Your profession?

1225
01:35:41,531 --> 01:35:43,115
Unemployed, looking for a job.

1226
01:35:45,977 --> 01:35:47,112
Give me your address.

1227
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:50,906
No.33 Krishna Street, Madha Nagar.

1228
01:35:51,623 --> 01:35:54,740
No.33 Krishna Street, Madha Nagar.

1229
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:04,320
Did you apply for a passport?

1230
01:36:06,281 --> 01:36:07,365
Yes, madam.

1231
01:36:08,845 --> 01:36:10,865
I called your for a verification.

1232
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,781
Actually, I should've come
in person for verification.

1233
01:36:16,365 --> 01:36:17,573
You do one thing

1234
01:36:18,573 --> 01:36:21,073
inspector Kanabiram
of K-11 police station

1235
01:36:22,323 --> 01:36:24,156
get an 'NOC' from him.

1236
01:36:25,156 --> 01:36:26,365
Understood?

1237
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,055
What is it?

1238
01:36:31,135 --> 01:36:34,168
Madam, my house comes under the
control of this police station.

1239
01:36:34,313 --> 01:36:35,808
Why should I get
an NOC from him?

1240
01:36:36,071 --> 01:36:38,360
If you want a passport,
get an NOC from him

1241
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,394
if not, you can leave from here.

1242
01:36:41,365 --> 01:36:43,251
Madam, how can you be so unethical?

1243
01:36:44,427 --> 01:36:45,490
Get up, damn it.

1244
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:49,115
I will lock you up
and skin you alive.

1245
01:36:52,365 --> 01:36:54,570
If public steps up to
question you people

1246
01:36:54,722 --> 01:36:57,068
you threaten them with
lock-up and torture.

1247
01:36:57,148 --> 01:36:59,865
Rascal, don't test me

1248
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:01,913
how dare you raise your
voice in my station?

1249
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:03,892
Leave! Get out from here.

1250
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:17,406
Prabhu, let me tell you something.

1251
01:37:18,198 --> 01:37:21,406
this passport, going abroad...
all of it

1252
01:37:21,698 --> 01:37:23,472
let's not go behind any of it.

1253
01:37:24,077 --> 01:37:27,031
We'll live happily with
what we have at the moment.

1254
01:37:30,184 --> 01:37:32,823
You don't go to
the police station.

1255
01:37:33,496 --> 01:37:38,012
I have a feeling that, they're
trying to web us into something.

1256
01:37:39,656 --> 01:37:40,656
Prabhu.

1257
01:37:41,531 --> 01:37:43,281
I'm really scared.

1258
01:37:46,948 --> 01:37:47,948
Scared!?

1259
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:51,406
Why should we be scared?

1260
01:37:52,698 --> 01:37:54,948
What was my mistake?

1261
01:37:55,854 --> 01:37:56,906
Murder?

1262
01:37:57,573 --> 01:37:58,573
Theft?

1263
01:38:00,282 --> 01:38:04,214
In our country even a pedophile

1264
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:07,198
is roaming the streets
free with no guilt.

1265
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:13,414
A bloody rogue,
snatched my wife's wedding chain

1266
01:38:13,494 --> 01:38:15,444
also molested her in the process

1267
01:38:15,524 --> 01:38:19,031
but I should remain
calm, in spite all of it.

1268
01:38:22,103 --> 01:38:25,865
Even a handicap would
want to fight him.

1269
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:31,962
I went looking for those thieves,
but was locked up and tortured

1270
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,281
where were they
when you got mugged?

1271
01:38:36,406 --> 01:38:40,031
They park their vehicles two streets
away in the name of Patrolling

1272
01:38:40,188 --> 01:38:42,905
people returning from night shits
night show movie

1273
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:45,531
they hold them and torture
in the name of checking.

1274
01:38:48,365 --> 01:38:52,333
Riches, who return drunk from
Pubs in their Audi and Mercedes

1275
01:38:52,413 --> 01:38:54,156
they just switch on their
lights inside the car.

1276
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,371
Police will salute
and let them go.

1277
01:38:57,702 --> 01:39:00,431
But when common people like us
while riding on a bike

1278
01:39:00,604 --> 01:39:01,996
even if we're not drunk

1279
01:39:02,076 --> 01:39:06,906
they force us to agree,
lock us up and destroy our lives.

1280
01:39:09,698 --> 01:39:12,132
Souls just like us are
affected by the police

1281
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:14,281
there are many in
every street in the city.

1282
01:39:15,448 --> 01:39:17,198
We can't do anything about it.

1283
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:20,906
Because, we're ordinary public.

1284
01:39:22,781 --> 01:39:24,698
They're public servants.

1285
01:39:27,906 --> 01:39:29,698
I've heard many mention this

1286
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:33,406
once if you step into the
police station with an issue

1287
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:36,448
it'll swirl up like
a snake on to you.

1288
01:39:36,865 --> 01:39:38,906
I think, we're a victim of it now.

1289
01:39:40,948 --> 01:39:42,618
Look here, Prabhu

1290
01:39:42,698 --> 01:39:44,605
the snake which has
swirled on to our lives

1291
01:39:44,685 --> 01:39:47,073
won't take much time to eat us up.

1292
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,365
Please don't stress
on this issue.

1293
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:54,865
Please listen to me.
Look here

1294
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:59,281
why did we go against our families?

1295
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,615
To lead a happy life, right?

1296
01:40:03,406 --> 01:40:06,698
Agreed... peace and our happiness

1297
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:09,740
is slowly moving away from us.

1298
01:40:09,906 --> 01:40:13,123
I want to lead a
happy life with you.

1299
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,281
Look at me Prabhu.

1300
01:40:16,782 --> 01:40:18,365
Please look at me.

1301
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:19,948
Please...

1302
01:40:21,227 --> 01:40:23,191
What are you thinking about?

1303
01:40:26,382 --> 01:40:30,281
What else I'm gonna
think about you, me

1304
01:40:30,948 --> 01:40:32,781
then our unborn child.

1305
01:40:34,743 --> 01:40:37,115
Hey, why are you crying?

1306
01:40:37,884 --> 01:40:39,942
Look over here,
why are you crying?

1307
01:40:40,022 --> 01:40:42,198
Hey, why are you
crying? don't worry.

1308
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:44,781
Hey, why are you crying?

1309
01:40:44,861 --> 01:40:46,809
Hey, don't cry.

1310
01:40:47,017 --> 01:40:48,281
Nothing to worry.

1311
01:40:50,883 --> 01:40:52,781
Nothing's wrong dear.
What happened?

1312
01:40:53,573 --> 01:40:55,323
I had a miscarriage.

1313
01:40:55,657 --> 01:40:56,823
We lost our baby.

1314
01:40:59,972 --> 01:41:01,656
We lost our baby...?

1315
01:41:02,991 --> 01:41:04,365
When did this happen?

1316
01:41:07,117 --> 01:41:11,531
The other day,
when I was watching your video on TV

1317
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:15,115
that shock caused
the miscarriage.

1318
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:21,573
We lost our baby.

1319
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:25,698
We lost our baby.

1320
01:41:31,315 --> 01:41:34,134
I wanted to tell you earlier

1321
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,615
but I couldn't...

1322
01:42:53,031 --> 01:42:54,698
Murugesan!
- Sir.

1323
01:42:57,419 --> 01:42:58,281
What is it?

1324
01:42:58,465 --> 01:43:00,406
K-12 inspector asked me to meet you.

1325
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:04,240
K-12 inspector?

1326
01:43:09,813 --> 01:43:10,906
For what?

1327
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,948
In regards to NOC.

1328
01:43:14,073 --> 01:43:15,073
What, NOC?

1329
01:43:16,706 --> 01:43:18,031
For passport.

1330
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:19,573
Whose passport?

1331
01:43:23,201 --> 01:43:24,663
I had applied for a passport

1332
01:43:24,743 --> 01:43:26,490
so she asked me to
get an NOC from you.

1333
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:33,948
So you're that Prabhu?

1334
01:43:38,865 --> 01:43:40,948
Murugesan,
give him a sheet of paper.

1335
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,865
Write down exactly what I say.

1336
01:44:08,823 --> 01:44:09,823
Add "From" on the letter

1337
01:44:10,823 --> 01:44:13,323
put your name and address

1338
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,948
have you written it down?

1339
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:20,490
I asked, did you write it down?

1340
01:44:22,573 --> 01:44:23,656
Now add "To" on the letter

1341
01:44:43,342 --> 01:44:46,031
Indian Human Rights Commission:
New Delhi.

1342
01:44:49,323 --> 01:44:50,448
What are you looking at?

1343
01:44:51,036 --> 01:44:52,073
Keep writing.

1344
01:44:56,287 --> 01:44:57,573
Respected sir,

1345
01:45:00,978 --> 01:45:03,906
I, on 10-12-2019

1346
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:07,573
It was late night
and I was drunk

1347
01:45:08,906 --> 01:45:10,990
I was over speeding on the bike

1348
01:45:13,156 --> 01:45:15,198
Patrol police stationed out there

1349
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,781
asked me to stop the bike

1350
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,115
but I didn't respect that
and continued to ride faster

1351
01:45:25,823 --> 01:45:28,865
they chased me down
stopped me

1352
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:32,501
and asked to blow into
the alcohol breathalyzer.

1353
01:45:34,518 --> 01:45:37,073
Not only I refused
to blow into it

1354
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:41,240
but pushed that machine
down and broke it.

1355
01:45:42,787 --> 01:45:44,031
Later...

1356
01:45:45,865 --> 01:45:47,823
was clueless intoxicated
by the alcohol.

1357
01:45:49,698 --> 01:45:51,865
I continued my atrocities after
reaching the police station.

1358
01:45:53,865 --> 01:45:55,448
He was patient about it

1359
01:45:56,477 --> 01:46:00,281
also was tolerant with my antics

1360
01:46:02,073 --> 01:46:06,781
but I raised my hand on
K-11 inspector Kannabiran.

1361
01:46:09,698 --> 01:46:10,865
So...

1362
01:46:12,406 --> 01:46:14,490
Inspector with no choice left

1363
01:46:15,698 --> 01:46:20,141
gave me a subtle beating
write exactly like that.

1364
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:23,073
Then below add, "Yours Truly"

1365
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:26,073
sign the letter and then leave.

1366
01:47:25,031 --> 01:47:26,490
What are you staring at?

1367
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:35,490
Don't you want your passport?

1368
01:47:40,865 --> 01:47:42,406
Don't you want it?

1369
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:52,531
To get your passport,
you need NOC

1370
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:56,073
if you want an NOC

1371
01:47:57,004 --> 01:47:58,781
it has to go through me.

1372
01:47:59,514 --> 01:48:00,406
Get lost!

1373
01:49:13,198 --> 01:49:15,656
'I said, you're going
to be a father.'

1374
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:17,073
'Bloody drunkard!'

1375
01:49:18,781 --> 01:49:20,656
'Hey, I'm your Indhu'

1376
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,740
'What I mentioned...'

1377
01:49:23,615 --> 01:49:25,031
'was true, right?'

1378
01:49:27,115 --> 01:49:29,615
'Hope, you won't return.
Get lost!'

1379
01:49:29,695 --> 01:49:32,490
'Hey, don't go to
the police station.'

1380
01:49:35,193 --> 01:49:36,990
'We lost our baby.'

1381
01:53:19,579 --> 01:53:22,079
TODAY

1382
01:53:31,531 --> 01:53:32,372
Sir!

1383
01:53:32,531 --> 01:53:34,448
Where is he?
- Outback, sir.

1384
01:53:34,865 --> 01:53:35,948
Get the keys
- Okay, sir.

1385
01:53:36,528 --> 01:53:38,281
He beat up the inspector into coma

1386
01:53:38,365 --> 01:53:39,906
what the heck were
you guys doing?

1387
01:53:40,156 --> 01:53:42,115
Sorry, sir. We didn't expect it.

1388
01:53:42,323 --> 01:53:44,326
Did public happen to
record the incident?

1389
01:53:44,406 --> 01:53:46,073
No sir, no one was around.

1390
01:53:46,406 --> 01:53:47,656
We've cleared everything.

1391
01:53:47,865 --> 01:53:48,865
Sir, keys...

1392
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:50,448
Sir, let's go.

1393
01:53:51,698 --> 01:53:53,740
Kumar, have you spoken to Durai?

1394
01:53:53,865 --> 01:53:56,031
I just spoke to him,
he'll be there in 40 minutes.

1395
01:53:56,111 --> 01:53:58,198
Fine, he knows the spot right?
- Yes he does.

1396
01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:01,615
Check where is Giri?

1397
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:02,906
I just spoke to him

1398
01:54:03,031 --> 01:54:05,740
it's his son's birthday,
will come once the cake is cut.

1399
01:54:06,031 --> 01:54:07,990
Ask him to come directly to the spot.
- Okay, sir.

1400
01:54:08,656 --> 01:54:10,031
Open the shutter, quick.

1401
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:22,823
Untie him.

1402
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:33,365
Hold him up.

1403
01:54:37,823 --> 01:54:41,615
How dare you beat up an officer
inside the police station?

1404
01:54:43,906 --> 01:54:46,073
Sir, is our vehicle enough
or shall I ask for another?

1405
01:54:46,365 --> 01:54:48,031
Why do we need another vehicle?

1406
01:54:48,115 --> 01:54:49,781
We'll take our vehicle.
- Okay, sir.

1407
01:54:49,906 --> 01:54:51,490
Manikandan,
are you sure everything is cleared?

1408
01:54:51,573 --> 01:54:53,791
Everything is cleared, sir.
- Do we have any ID on him?

1409
01:54:53,871 --> 01:54:55,740
Yes, we have his Voter
ID and Driving License.

1410
01:54:55,865 --> 01:54:57,323
Shankar get those ID's from him.

1411
01:54:57,490 --> 01:54:58,406
Okay, sir.

1412
01:55:42,823 --> 01:55:44,198
They've taken him away.

1413
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:46,115
That's right.

1414
01:55:47,365 --> 01:55:48,948
It's been half an
hour since they left.

1415
01:55:49,128 --> 01:55:50,198
Sir.
- They'll be back.

1416
01:55:51,115 --> 01:55:52,406
I'll call you back.

1417
01:55:53,573 --> 01:55:56,031
Sir, did my husband
Prabhu come over here?

1418
01:55:58,365 --> 01:55:59,668
No one came over. Please leave.

1419
01:55:59,823 --> 01:56:01,240
Sir, please sir.

1420
01:56:01,781 --> 01:56:03,906
Since yesterday,
I've been looking for him.

1421
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:05,948
I have no clue where is he.

1422
01:56:06,823 --> 01:56:08,531
So, was checking if he came over?

1423
01:56:09,073 --> 01:56:10,615
I did say no one came over.

1424
01:56:10,695 --> 01:56:13,156
Leave. Murugesan, ask her to leave.

1425
01:56:20,145 --> 01:56:21,180
Sir!

1426
01:56:23,721 --> 01:56:24,656
Sir...

1427
01:56:24,883 --> 01:56:26,448
Sir, please sir.

1428
01:56:26,615 --> 01:56:28,780
Please, at least you tell me.

1429
01:56:34,448 --> 01:56:35,865
What do you want me to say?

1430
01:56:37,116 --> 01:56:38,323
What do you expect me to say?

1431
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,281
You don't get it.

1432
01:56:41,644 --> 01:56:45,406
People like you don't
know how to lead a life.

1433
01:56:47,644 --> 01:56:51,240
Earn well,
and be happy with your family.

1434
01:56:52,156 --> 01:56:55,615
Instead you walk into trouble

1435
01:56:56,031 --> 01:56:57,698
why do you get
webbed on purpose?

1436
01:56:59,526 --> 01:57:01,948
Look around to see
how things work.

1437
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:05,138
If you step in to this hell hole

1438
01:57:05,276 --> 01:57:09,906
will end up losing
happiness from their lives.

1439
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:13,531
Can't help,
it's become the way of life.

1440
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:15,531
The relationship between us.

1441
01:57:16,823 --> 01:57:18,406
We are public servants.

1442
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:19,906
Not denying it.

1443
01:57:20,073 --> 01:57:22,990
But to us,
public is our servant.

1444
01:57:24,587 --> 01:57:26,156
Nothing can be done.

1445
01:57:26,801 --> 01:57:30,865
During my career as a police
constable, I've seen a lot.

1446
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:35,531
Many cases, issues...
I've seen them all.

1447
01:57:35,991 --> 01:57:41,448
But one day, a guy was brought
in for creating a scene.

1448
01:57:42,573 --> 01:57:44,906
They beat him up, insulted him

1449
01:57:45,073 --> 01:57:50,874
then ripped him off his happiness
and peace from his life.

1450
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,656
Wonder what caught his mind

1451
01:57:55,573 --> 01:57:58,573
he did something
beyond his control.

1452
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:00,990
That's it!

1453
01:58:02,115 --> 01:58:03,115
He was doomed!

1454
01:58:07,823 --> 01:58:10,198
Your husband once
asked me something

1455
01:58:10,365 --> 01:58:12,531
'Don't you guys have
any conscience?'

1456
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:17,823
But I said, 'there are a few
who have conscience.'

1457
01:58:21,865 --> 01:58:23,281
That's what I told him.

1458
01:58:27,698 --> 01:58:29,888
But now in my career as a police,

1459
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:32,094
I'm standing here
with no conscience.

1460
01:58:37,781 --> 01:58:41,531
People in power,
always have an upper hand

1461
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:45,281
but the ones below the power,
has to bend over.

1462
01:58:46,781 --> 01:58:48,406
This is an unwritten fate.

1463
01:58:48,656 --> 01:58:50,948
But when you try
to change the fate

1464
01:58:51,156 --> 01:58:53,490
you will have to
pay the price for it.

1465
01:58:59,048 --> 01:59:03,781
Sir, so you don't know where he is?

1466
01:59:06,073 --> 01:59:07,073
I don't know.

1467
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:11,656
If you happen to find him,
let me know.

1468
02:00:00,848 --> 02:00:06,692
POLICE DEPARTMENT IS YOUR FRIEND

1469
02:00:17,687 --> 02:00:22,028
In the enquiry with regard
to the Habeas Corpus petition

1470
02:00:22,108 --> 02:00:25,751
which Indhu had filed
about her husband

1471
02:00:25,831 --> 02:00:28,923
who went missing after
going to the police station,

1472
02:00:29,003 --> 02:00:32,284
the court has found that
her husband Prabhu was killed

1473
02:00:32,364 --> 02:00:35,882
with an intension
by the police department.

1474
02:00:35,962 --> 02:00:39,145
The court has terminated
the employment of those

1475
02:00:39,225 --> 02:00:42,064
using the protection
of individual rights under

1476
02:00:42,144 --> 02:00:45,809
"Habaes Corpus department" and has
also given them jail imprisonment.

1477
02:00:45,889 --> 02:00:49,694
Only because of compassionate people
like Head Constable Murugesan,

1478
02:00:49,774 --> 02:00:53,557
who helped Indhu file a "Habeas
Corpus" petition at the court

1479
02:00:53,637 --> 02:00:58,375
and find the truth, are there
with the police department is 

1480
02:00:58,455 --> 02:01:02,272
why people still have a
little faith with the department.

1481
02:01:02,502 --> 02:01:05,850
The law is for everybody.

1482
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:08,003
It is the duty of anyone

1483
02:01:08,083 --> 02:01:11,786
who knows law to help ordinary
people benefit out of it.
