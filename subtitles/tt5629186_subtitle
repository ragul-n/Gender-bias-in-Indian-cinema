1
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,845
You added fish.

2
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,030
DR. SHERMAN: Well, I'm hoping

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,952
they have more luck than the plants.

4
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:14,072
I couldn't seem to keep them alive.

5
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,952
ELIZABETH: We tried a fish tank
when the kids were little,

6
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:20,742
but I just kept overfeeding him.

7
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:23,921
Everything sounds like a
metaphor in here, doesn't it?

8
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:28,322
Anyway...

9
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,862
It's good to see you.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,782
It's good to meet you, Henry.

11
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:32,883
You, too, Dr. Sherman.

12
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,513
Well, um...

13
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,662
Like I said on the voice mail,

14
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:47,782
I thought that maybe we could
use one of my tune-up sessions

15
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,912
to talk through some of the things

16
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:51,496
that Henry's been
going through at work.

17
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,572
Affecting things at home, that's on me.

18
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,822
We're not so much about blame here.

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,366
Thankfully, Henry has been really open

20
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,862
to giving it a try, so...

21
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,862
We do not need couples therapy.

22
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:07,282
I-I know you think
it's going to be hooey.

23
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,912
I did, too.

24
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:12,532
But talking with her
really helped me after Iran.

25
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,952
I know, and I'm grateful for it,

26
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,992
but this is an entirely
different situation.

27
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,202
Is it?

28
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,702
Because you are up half the
night walking the floors.

29
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,322
You-you say the same moment with Dmitri

30
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:23,912
plays over and over in your head.

31
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,715
- That sounds a lot like
- Okay, what happened

32
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:27,638
- what I went through.
- in Iran happened to you.

33
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:29,952
What happened with Dmitri,
what I let happen,

34
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,782
was my doing.

35
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:32,862
And mine.

36
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:35,492
Elizabeth, this is not something
you need to worry about.

37
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,742
Can I also say

38
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:42,362
that it pisses me off a little
that when I'm falling apart,

39
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:45,032
it's off to the shrink,
but when you're struggling,

40
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,202
you can tough it out.

41
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,085
- What is that?
- I'm not toughing anything out,

42
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,412
I'm just...

43
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,992
You said you think about it
every time you look at me.

44
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,093
How are we supposed to get past that?

45
00:01:58,073 --> 00:01:59,782
Someone I cared about,

46
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:04,452
someone I promised to keep safe,

47
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,032
ended up losing his life.

48
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,282
Which was due to a
decision I was a part of.

49
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:11,032
That's a terrible burden
of responsibility.

50
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,492
Goes with the job.

51
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:16,122
Do you find your jobs

52
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,202
intersect quite a bit?

53
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:21,492
There's been a shared, um...

54
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,412
goal between our departments, so

55
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,995
- more lately.
- It's very supportive

56
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,362
and collaborative.

57
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:29,742
Do you find that you're
talking about work at home?

58
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:32,032
Yeah. I mean, we do
sometimes, I think, so...

59
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,952
Nothing...

60
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:33,993
I mean, I think we both

61
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,032
out of the ordinary.

62
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,282
know where the boundaries are.

63
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:40,072
She's not opening up at
all under interrogation?

64
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,322
She's too traumatized.

65
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,912
I think working with a
translator is holding us back.

66
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,282
Well, you have to
establish trust first.

67
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,912
Where do we keep the extra cereal?

68
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:49,992
Now that you've got the intel on Disah,

69
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:51,452
where does Hijriyyah go?

70
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,992
Well, we'd like to keep her here,

71
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,856
but that would mean somehow
extending the terms

72
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:55,862
of her rendition.

73
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,912
Mm, if you need any help...

74
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,912
You don't have to say that.

75
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,742
I do have to say I hate your floss.

76
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,782
How can you deal with this stuff?

77
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,782
It's minty.

78
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,202
If Disah is in Islamabad...

79
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:10,122
I know, it doesn't
look good for Pakistan.

80
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,412
Harboring our number one enemy?

81
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:15,912
Right after we talked them
down from a war with India?

82
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,532
How did you guys do that anyway?

83
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,822
Oh, never mind.

84
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,862
I hit my security clearance.

85
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,532
I'd tell you if I could.

86
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:29,282
I think we might be letting
things take over a bit.

87
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:33,822
I think you have both
experienced more than your share

88
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,072
of professional trauma.

89
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:40,452
Not least the bombing Henry
was in just a few months ago.

90
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,282
But I'm not gonna talk about your jobs.

91
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,572
I'm gonna talk about your marriage.

92
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,532
The connection that
brought you together,

93
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,202
that built this empire of two,

94
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:56,862
the circle of intimacy
that you share, hmm?

95
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,992
I want you both, in the next week,

96
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:01,032
to find your way back to that circle,

97
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,162
to take refuge in each other.

98
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:08,992
And that means no work talk at home.

99
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:13,122
I want you to come back
with, mm... three moments

100
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:16,322
when you reconnected with
the people that you were

101
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,202
when you first met.

102
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:22,202
Really try to reconnect
with yourselves, hmm?

103
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,912
Through each other.

104
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,072
Yeah?

105
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:32,572
Okay, she might have gotten
a little hooey there at the end.

106
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,072
No, it was good.

107
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,013
Yeah?

108
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:36,952
Yeah, she's right.

109
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,793
We're been needing to
spend more time together,

110
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,793
and if this is what it
takes to make that happen,

111
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,072
I'm in.

112
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,412
Does this mean we're going
to the new shabu-shabu place

113
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:46,242
tomorrow night?

114
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,346
Is that that Japanese place

115
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:49,032
where you have to cook your own food?

116
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,492
Isn't that like eating at home?

117
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:52,316
Okay, now I'm just
reconnecting with your dad.

118
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:53,492
(chuckles)

119
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,822
I'll tell you what,

120
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:59,202
you went to my shrink,
you get to pick dinner.

121
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,532
Burgers and bowling.

122
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:05,242
Ooh, we are going back in time.

123
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,702
Listen, that, uh...

124
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:10,072
International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism

125
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:11,912
thing tonight, you don't have to go.

126
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,702
Don't be silly, I said I would.

127
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:15,452
I know, but...

128
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:19,122
Well, it's not exactly bringing
us back to our circle of two.

129
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,461
That's what burgers
and bowling are for.

130
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,285
(chuckles)

131
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:24,723
Come on, you know you want
to see me in a tuxedo.

132
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:27,952
(chuckles)

133
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,843
(engine starts)

134
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,242
PARKER: <i>Drone images show</i>

135
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,122
the I-8 district of Islamabad,

136
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,122
where Jibral Disah is
said to be sheltered,

137
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:40,162
to be a highly exposed
residential area.

138
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:43,282
Obviously, we can't do
another bin Laden raid.

139
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:45,426
The hope is that we'll be
working with the cooperation

140
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,162
of the Pakistani government this time.

141
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,426
Well, given that the Pakastanis

142
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,242
appear to be openly
harboring Jibral Disah...

143
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,282
In the middle of their
own capital, no less.

144
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:55,322
...I'm not sure we can
count on that cooperation.

145
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:58,162
Without it, we're looking at
an on-the-ground operation.

146
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:58,971
At best

147
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,822
risking chaos and noise, but at worst

148
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:03,046
significant collateral damage.

149
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:06,492
And Prime Minister
Khoosat getting blamed

150
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:07,822
for letting the Americans in.

151
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:09,662
I don't need to explain to any of you

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,383
how important it is to
protect our agreement

153
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:12,807
with the prime minister allowing us

154
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,322
to track Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

155
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,782
PARKER: Understood, but given
this unique opportunity

156
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,889
to target Disah...

157
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,912
Disah might be enemy number one,

158
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,362
but that agreement is the key
to global nuclear security.

159
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:25,415
Can't believe I'm saying this,

160
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,709
but Disah might not be
the top priority here.

161
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,303
Are we standing down
then, Mr. President?

162
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:33,412
The other option, if I may,

163
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:35,242
is to send in Murphy Station.

164
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:37,822
Cultivate assets on the ground,

165
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,662
with access to Disah.

166
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:42,072
Try to bring him down from the inside.

167
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:45,532
Of course, that's not
without risk either.

168
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,322
Well, I'll sleep a hell of a lot better

169
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,412
knowing that we have
Pakistan on our side on this.

170
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:50,952
There's a reception tonight

171
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:55,072
for the International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism.

172
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:59,072
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Abedi will be there.

173
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,072
Maybe I can

174
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,282
try and bait him.

175
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:03,452
Feed him disinformation,

176
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,122
see if it gets back to
anyone at Hizb Al-Shahid

177
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,026
and then we'll know for
sure if their government

178
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,242
is collaborating with them at all.

179
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,242
I suppose we can wait 24 hours,

180
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,202
see if it reveals any connections.

181
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:16,912
If we can't find someone
we trust in Pakistan

182
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,572
to help us take out Disah,

183
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,532
we'll have to send in Murphy Station.

184
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,673
Yes, sir.

185
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:26,952
You know, I don't suggest

186
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:28,622
Murphy Station lightly.

187
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,202
No, of course, Ellen.

188
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:33,303
But it may be the best move we've got.

189
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:38,282
Oh, hey, Jose, you got a minute?

190
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,072
Sure.

191
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,202
Is that from Otis Beanery?

192
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:42,282
It's on my dime.

193
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,822
That stuff in the kitchen is swill.

194
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,032
(chuckles)

195
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,202
I wanted to check in with
you about your informant

196
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:49,782
in Pakistan.

197
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,412
Okay.

198
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,202
He's someone with direct
ties to Hizb Al-Shahid?

199
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,952
Direct? I don't know.

200
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:57,633
I've got a fixer who's
been working with me

201
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:58,476
since Afghanistan.

202
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,781
He deals in whatever black
market stuff these groups need:

203
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:04,532
arms, supplies, foreign currency.

204
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,862
He's in Islamabad now.

205
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,572
If HS is there, he'll know.

206
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:09,992
He's a reliable source of intel?

207
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:11,282
If the price is right.

208
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,742
Okay.

209
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,362
Currency exchange,
I can work with that, thanks.

210
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,066
A reception for the
International Coalition

211
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:22,415
to Counter Violent Extremism,
featuring at least six countries

212
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,526
who openly sponsor violent extremism.

213
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,492
Welcome to 21st century diplomacy.

214
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,452
I just want to know the dress
code for flagrant hypocrisy.

215
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,662
Uh, black tie optional.

216
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,662
Morning, team.

217
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,245
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

218
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,646
NADINE: Our first order of business

219
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,915
is tonight's reception

220
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,072
for the International Coalition
to Counter Violent Extremism.

221
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:43,140
Two words, people: open bar.

222
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,874
ELIZABETH: Oh, love the enthusiasm.

223
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,822
Maybe you can bring it to the
second order of business.

224
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:49,622
Ah, well, now that
Congress has approved

225
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:52,072
a new aid package to Pakistan,

226
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,702
we'd like to fast-track
these proposals.

227
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:54,657
(sniffs)

228
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:57,452
So, please do get through
these as quickly as you can

229
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,742
and earmark those that
seem worth prioritizing.

230
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,944
JAY: Package was just approved

231
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,712
two days ago... why the rush?

232
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,202
Want to include it
in tonight's reception.

233
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:09,383
As a show of our commitment
to nonviolent initiatives.

234
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,349
A build-your-own-bear workshop?

235
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,711
MATT: It's hard to get radicalized

236
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:14,713
if you're making a bow
tie for Mr. Snookums.

237
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,675
Sorry, didn't we just find
out that Hizb Al-Shahid

238
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,540
might be hiding out in Pakistan?

239
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,465
We're still sending
them $2 billion in aid?

240
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,470
There are times, Jay,
when you need to trust

241
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,397
that you're part of a larger picture.

242
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,553
(gunshots)

243
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:34,173
Oh, not bad, Professor.

244
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,282
Nice!

245
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,282
It's been a while.

246
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:42,742
Any word on our status?

247
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:43,875
Are they sending us in?

248
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,361
Had a little chat with the
secretary of state this morning.

249
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,362
Really?

250
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,322
What was that about?

251
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,203
She wanted the rundown

252
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,034
on my informant in Islamabad.

253
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,362
Sounds like she's running
some kind of test on the ground.

254
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:56,452
As long as they don't trip any wires.

255
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:59,992
Only order I got was to stand
down until further instructed.

256
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,896
Meanwhile, Disah could be
packing up his caravan

257
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:03,322
as we speak.

258
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,723
Guess we're gonna have to trust
they know what they're doing.

259
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:08,532
Being at the mercy of larger
forces is not my happy place.

260
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,014
Hey, guys, I have a dinner to get to.

261
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,595
Are we good for weapons certification?

262
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:12,937
We're good.

263
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,622
You up for a drink?

264
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,412
You know what? Yeah.

265
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,709
Hey, has anybody seen my other earring?

266
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,202
- This one?
- Mom!

267
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,492
You look stunning.

268
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:25,322
I do?

269
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,362
Is that silk organza?

270
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:29,742
I hope so. Yeah.

271
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:30,992
I love it.

272
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,072
ELIZABETH: Listen,
I really need my other earring.

273
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,115
- I think I may have seen it somewhere.
- Go get it.

274
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:38,822
Ali! Grr!

275
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,952
Oh, gosh, that smells so much
better than the rubber chicken

276
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,412
I'm about to eat.

277
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,492
I can make you up a
plate before you go.

278
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,598
(cell phone buzzing)

279
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,803
Uh...

280
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,952
Hey, where are you?
I got to leave in ten.

281
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,176
HENRY: Babe, I'm really sorry,

282
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,992
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it.

283
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:56,992
Well, what's going on?

284
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:58,322
Everything okay?

285
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,884
Yeah, we're just really digging in here

286
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,491
in case we got sent into the field.

287
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,124
There's a lot to prepare.

288
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,245
No, no, I understand.

289
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,241
I was just...

290
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,742
Is that, um...

291
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:08,912
I mean, is that everything?

292
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,572
Of course.

293
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,952
Uh, if we wrap it up early,
I'll... I'll try to stop by.

294
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,362
Okay.

295
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:17,202
I really hope you can make it.

296
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,622
Me, too.

297
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:19,782
I'm really sorry.

298
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,412
Don't work too hard.

299
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,923
Okay, bye.

300
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:34,664
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com</b>.

301
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:45,743
Russia's here.

302
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,333
Why is Russia here?

303
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:49,333
'Cause they hate ISIS as much as we do.

304
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,743
Holy crap, have you tried this?

305
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:51,743
I would like to.

306
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,690
What Russia's doing to Ukraine

307
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,689
totally qualifies as
state-sponsored terrorism.

308
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,588
They should not be
eating our crab puffs.

309
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,543
If crab puffs bring world peace,

310
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,253
then I'm all for sharing.

311
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,423
This whole thing's a joke.

312
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,843
I don't know.

313
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,867
Those proposals for Pakistan
looked pretty awesome.

314
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:06,753
Uh, what was that?

315
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:09,923
Sounds suspiciously
like earnest optimism.

316
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,503
I just think Pakistan could benefit

317
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:14,043
from more than the usual
blank check from the U.S.

318
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:15,747
You know, get in there
at the ground level,

319
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,093
really make a difference.

320
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,009
(laughing)

321
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,923
It's cool, it's cool.

322
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:21,713
Wow, faith in the system.

323
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:22,904
How bracing.

324
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,343
Madam Secretary.

325
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,173
Foreign Minister Abedi
would like a word.

326
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,173
Of course.

327
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,557
You'll excuse me, Your Excellency.

328
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:31,753
Of course.

329
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:32,924
Madam Secretary.

330
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,093
Minister Abedi.

331
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:35,253
Thank you for coming.

332
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,673
It's an honor to have you here.

333
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,303
I know it was short notice.

334
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,608
Well, after receiving notice
of your generous aid package,

335
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,923
I was all too pleased to express
our gratitude in person.

336
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:47,093
Well, we have many promising
initiatives in the works.

337
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,923
While you're here,

338
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:51,713
there was a small matter I was
hoping to discuss with you.

339
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:53,093
Of course.

340
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:55,423
Great.

341
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,843
At that point, it was either get
the intel however we could

342
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,253
or let the kid go home and
blow the whole operation.

343
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:02,253
How old was he?

344
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:04,423
Maybe 12?

345
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:06,253
So he's got this goat with him,

346
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,253
and I figure this is an easy move.

347
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,503
We cut the goat's throat, tell
him he'll be next or whatever.

348
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:12,923
It's a goat, right?

349
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,923
He probably had one
for dinner last Sunday.

350
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,886
- The kid lost it.
- Like you wouldn't believe.

351
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,303
The goat's a symbol
of Abraham sacrificing

352
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,883
his son Isaac to God.

353
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,627
It's a big deal in
the Qur'an and the Bible.

354
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:23,883
Yeah, I didn't know that.

355
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:26,107
But you'd have thought I sliced
open his mother's throat

356
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,303
the way he was crying.

357
00:13:28,304 --> 00:13:30,303
Not a lot keeps me up at night,

358
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:31,883
but that one...

359
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:33,093
Yeah.

360
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:36,713
Think this should be my last one.

361
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,343
I want you to know I've got your back.

362
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:41,343
It's gonna be an easy op.

363
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,753
I'm not a total lamb, Jose, but thanks.

364
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,383
Yeah? Okay.

365
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,963
I know you've flown
overhead, 20,000 feet.

366
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:51,444
Being on the ground is
a whole other game.

367
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:55,253
I'll tell you my number-one rule,

368
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:58,253
how I made it home from
every mission I've been on.

369
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,253
No acts of passion. Ever.

370
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,253
You find yourself wanting
to save somebody,

371
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:05,343
take a big risk that
wasn't part of the plan,

372
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,253
don't do it.

373
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:11,274
We're way more useful alive
than a star on the wall.

374
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,343
I don't think we lost
Mimi because of passion.

375
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:20,543
Hey, man, I... I'm sorry
I rode you hard on Mimi.

376
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:23,963
Nobody knew that guy'd
be wired to blow.

377
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:27,314
The truth is, I might
have made the same call.

378
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,213
Maybe I'll have one more.

379
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,214
You want one?

380
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,213
Sure.

381
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:38,213
As you know, we've been
tracking Hizb Al-Shahid

382
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,253
as closely as we can since the attack.

383
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:44,213
This attack was an affront to us all.

384
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,593
Thank you.

385
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:50,213
So we've been focusing on
the source of HS's funding,

386
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:55,003
and unfortunately some
new intel has traced

387
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:57,854
several private accounts
back to Islamabad.

388
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,843
This is very disappointing to hear.

389
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,423
I'm hoping to get your help
to close these accounts

390
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,093
as quickly as possible.

391
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:09,343
Of course. The prime minister
has made it a top priority

392
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:12,343
to root out all ties
to radicalism in Pakistan.

393
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:16,343
I know that he will be very
concerned to hear this.

394
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:19,343
My staff will give you all
the information we have.

395
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:21,173
This is a huge help, Minister.

396
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:22,343
Thank you so much.

397
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:24,354
It's the reason we're
all here, isn't it?

398
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:35,383
(coins rattling on floor)

399
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,644
That was quite a strategy meeting.

400
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:45,423
There was beer... and-and strategy.

401
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,593
Uh, I'm getting a little whiskey, too.

402
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,423
Oh, I took an Uber.

403
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,593
How was the thing?

404
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:55,593
You know, just a thing.

405
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:57,694
Sorry I didn't make it.

406
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,604
Baby, I lied.

407
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:07,133
I didn't have to work.

408
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,213
I told you you didn't have to go.

409
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:12,803
I was about to leave,
then I just... I...

410
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:15,383
I-I... I thought if I ran
into some Russian minister

411
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,383
who was eating caviar
on the U.S.'s dime,

412
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:18,883
I would throw him against the wall

413
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,673
and demand to know what
they're doing with Talia Petrov.

414
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,543
Well, why didn't you just
tell me that when you called?

415
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:28,133
Uh, I... I didn't know that was it.

416
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:29,713
(sighs)

417
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,543
I didn't want to face it.

418
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,234
Then say that.

419
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,463
Any of that.

420
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:39,963
We're... we're in therapy
so we can work through it.

421
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:43,543
We're in therapy because I can't
accept what happened to Dmitri

422
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,524
and what's still
happening to his sister.

423
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:48,923
Which means that you
can't accept me either.

00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:19,275
You know, it's a diplomatic cover.

536
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:22,996
You should take a suit.

537
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:30,775
We're doing it again, aren't we?

538
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,975
Well, I just thought,
under the circumstances,

539
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,826
maybe we get a pass for talking shop.

540
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,815
You can tell me not to go, you know.

541
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,895
I'll let Jose and Jane handle it.

542
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:45,975
I say this with love.

543
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:48,725
That's such a load of crap,
and you know it.

544
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,225
Mmm. Mmm.

545
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:54,046
You're racked with guilt
over a horrible loss,

546
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,684
and you're Catholic to boot.

547
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,975
Now you get a chance to atone
by going into the lion's den

548
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,225
and slaying the dragon.

549
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:00,868
- It's a mixed metaphor.
- Mixed metaphor.

550
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,015
I know that, but you know what I mean.

551
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,855
We both know you're going.

552
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:08,774
Listen, this is not just some
kind of personal crusade.

553
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,780
I know that.

554
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,062
And you know I would never
purposely put myself in danger.

555
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:15,685
Conrad wants you guys working
from inside the embassy,

556
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,935
and that's what's gonna
let me sleep at night,

557
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,815
so... tell me you're
gonna respect that.

558
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,666
Of course.

559
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,597
We didn't get to our therapy homework.

560
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:28,855
(sighs)

561
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:31,975
Burgers and bowling the
second I get back, and

562
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,105
what's the cover story
with the kids again?

563
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,975
Jace, Stevie,
come say good-bye to your dad.

564
00:22:39,037 --> 00:22:40,548
STEVIE: When are you back?

565
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:41,775
Sunday at this point,

566
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,565
but it could go a little later.

567
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:45,826
Oh, right, because a weekend with

568
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:46,804
- a think tank
- Bye.

569
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:48,565
in San Diego could
totally run into overtime.

570
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,315
Oh, there's my little
conspiracy theorist.

571
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:52,725
Wherever you're going,
have a wonderful time.

572
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:54,685
A small break from the texting, please?

573
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:56,566
- Sorry. See you Sunday.
- Bye.

574
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:57,275
Mwah!

575
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,903
You do realize it's
psychologically damaging

576
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:01,281
to grow up in a false reality?

577
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:03,861
I'll remember that next time
you ask me for an Oculus Rift.

578
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,242
Oh, walked right into that one!

579
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,786
(both chuckle)

580
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:13,725
(clears throat)

581
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,355
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

582
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,105
I-I need M Sec's eye line
for my presentation.

583
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,895
And this is my spot.

584
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,065
I know.

585
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,815
Could you just shake it up a little?

586
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:26,685
I've got visual aids.

587
00:23:26,686 --> 00:23:27,731
And this is my spot.

588
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:28,775
Oh, goodie.

589
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:31,725
Weirdly obsessive versus
blind creature of habit.

590
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,855
My money's on weirdly obsessive.

591
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,959
I have to root for my team.

592
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,275
Good morning, everyone.

593
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,316
- Morning.
- Good morning.

594
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:38,540
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

595
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,775
Oh, gosh.

596
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,475
Well, thank you. These are lovely.

597
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:42,605
It's for my presentation.

598
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:43,895
You'll see in a minute.

599
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,855
NADINE: Oh, there's been a slight

600
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,015
change to the morning's agenda.

601
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:50,815
Yes, uh, first, I want
to thank all of you

602
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:53,355
for putting together those
proposals for Pakistan

603
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,475
on such short notice.

604
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,935
The foreign minister
was deeply impressed.

605
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,435
However,

606
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:02,815
some new developments
have put the congressional

607
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,725
aid package on hold for the time being.

608
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,275
Possibly permanently.

609
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:10,645
The situation on the
ground has changed...

610
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,475
Matt?

611
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:14,895
Is there a problem?

612
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,935
Uh, no, I-I'm sorry.

613
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,935
ELIZABETH: I-I know
this is frustrating.

614
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,275
And I apologize.

615
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:21,671
Obviously, as soon as...

616
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:23,065
BLAKE: Of course. Ma'am?

617
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,605
Call from the embassy in Islamabad.

618
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,815
Oh, um, excuse me. I got to take this.

619
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:29,975
Moving on to the arrival
of the Kurdish delegation...

620
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:32,576
♪ ♪

621
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:37,515
ELIZABETH: So you made it.
How's it going?

622
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:39,059
Well, the mosques are just incredible.

623
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,935
The whole city's getting ready

624
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,895
for a big military parade tomorrow.

625
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:46,565
Which will look beautiful from
the windows of the embassy.

626
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,185
(chuckles) Jane and I are shut up

627
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,475
in here like a harem.

628
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,015
Jose's out meeting his fixer.

629
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,275
He wants to sell HS some burner phones.

630
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,435
There's a tracking
device in one of them.

631
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,379
Once it goes live,
we'll know Disah's every move.

632
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,815
Yeah, if it goes live.

633
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:02,015
And then you're
handing over all that intel

634
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,605
to the ops team on the ground?

635
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:04,895
Okay. (chuckles)

636
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,895
Now we're just repeating
briefings to each other.

637
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,355
This isn't even creative work talk.

638
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,499
I just want to hear verbal
conformation about the part

639
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,685
where all the work

640
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:16,105
of actually taking Disah
out is done by...

641
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:17,895
The ops team.

642
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,315
Verbally confirmed.

643
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:20,855
You get any sleep?

644
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,315
A little.

645
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:23,416
You?

646
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,515
Not much.

647
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,228
- JOSE: Tell me you got the tracking up!
- Hang on, Jose's back.

648
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:27,855
Just established a connection.

649
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:29,066
HS bought the phones already?

650
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,275
Who's that?

651
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:32,355
Uh, I'm putting you on speaker.

652
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,275
This is the secretary of state, Jose.

653
00:25:34,276 --> 00:25:36,065
<i>What's going on?</i>

654
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,895
My fixer just heard
from his HS contact.

655
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,275
They want to buy some
military-grade EFPs.

656
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:41,855
Whoa.

657
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,475
That's a roadside bomb, right?

658
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,855
An incredibly badass one.

659
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:47,225
Basically, it's a pipe filled
with any kind of explosive

660
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:49,855
that can shoot a copper slug
hard enough to penetrate armor.

661
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:50,855
It's heavy-duty damage.

662
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,542
Do we know what their target is?

663
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,015
No, but some upper-level HS lieutenants

664
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:55,119
are meeting him in an hour.

665
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,395
We'll get eyes on the purchase.

666
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,259
Hopefully, they'll follow
these guys right back

667
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,148
- to their base of operation.
- Nice play.

668
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:01,041
Got lucky.

669
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:01,935
Oh, now he's modest.

670
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,515
Hang on a sec.

671
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:07,015
What does HS want with
explosives in Pakistan?

672
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,815
Exactly. This is not the kind of thing

673
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,815
you want to go bouncing
around on dirt roads with.

674
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,975
Why would they want to
target anything in Pakistan,

675
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:16,135
the one country that gives
them support and shelter?

676
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:18,145
All I know is, I have less
than an hour to set this up.

677
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,895
You guys want to think this to death,

678
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,608
- you let me know what you come up with.
- I'll keep you posted.

679
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:24,395
Thanks.

680
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:25,975
I'll fill in the White House.

681
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:28,076
Bye.

682
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,815
(knocking)

683
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:34,435
Do you have a minute?

684
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,105
Oh, I don't know.

685
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:39,475
I'm pretty busy canceling
projects for no good reason.

686
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:44,145
I am so sorry a-about reacting.

687
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:47,435
I'm not the one you need
to apologize to, but thank you.

688
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:49,826
I'll also apologize to the secretary.

689
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:56,315
You know, my job is to write
things for other people,

690
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:58,105
which... which I love, you know,

691
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:00,015
and I think I'm pretty good at.

692
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:01,275
I would agree.

693
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,975
But it's like being a songwriter

694
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,065
in Nashville.

695
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,315
There's always someone
else singing my song.

696
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:10,395
Sometimes... I just
want to sing my own.

697
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,065
And, um,

698
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:16,975
a gardening project in
Pakistan is your song?

699
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:20,185
(sighs)

700
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:23,105
My mom was born in Karachi.

701
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:24,935
I'm half Pakistani.

702
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:29,105
I'm sure you thought I was
Sephardic Jew or half Sicilian?

703
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,311
I...

704
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:31,515
My mom came here

705
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,395
when she was 16 to get
away from her family,

706
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:36,565
and she never went back.

707
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:39,105
When I ask her to tell me

708
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:42,975
what she remembers about
growing up in Karachi,

709
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,645
she always says two things:

710
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:48,975
a song this <i>sabzi wala</i> used to sing

711
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:52,185
while selling vegetables on the street,

712
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:56,645
and the smell of Arabian jasmine
in her family's garden.

713
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:59,355
She came here to get an education,

714
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:02,225
and met my dad, built this whole life

715
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:04,315
for herself, but to this day,

716
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,826
she still calls Pakistan home,
you know?

717
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:13,515
And I... (sighs)

718
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:17,326
You wanted to restore a
world your mother lost?

719
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,645
(sighs)

720
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,725
Obviously,

721
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:29,685
I tried to bring too much
of myself to the job,

722
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:32,286
and I'm sorry.

723
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:37,286
It won't happen again.

724
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:42,725
Go ahead, Murphy Station.
What's your progress?

725
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,895
Mr. President, we've been
actively tracking a purchase

726
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,645
of explosives by two
high-ranking members

727
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:48,015
of Hizb Al-Shahid.

728
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,119
When our operatives followed
them after the purchase,

729
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,515
we got something we weren't expecting.

730
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:55,065
Okay. These are the two
lieutenants of Disah

731
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,775
just after the purchase of the EFPs.

732
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,185
Now, this is a highly lethal

733
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:01,975
roadside bomb that can
penetrate an armored vehicle.

734
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,145
Frequently employed
against U.S. troops in Iraq.

735
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:06,475
Where the hell is this
fixer getting an EFP?

736
00:29:06,476 --> 00:29:08,685
Most likely Iranian military.

737
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:09,975
They make deals.

738
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,775
Resourceful.

739
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:13,225
Where are they going?

740
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,605
Tomorrow is a national holiday

741
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:16,185
commemorating the Lahore Resolution.

742
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:18,315
Prime Minister Khoosat will be riding

743
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:20,435
through the streets in a parade.

744
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:22,395
And these are the
members of HS planting

745
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,139
an EFP on the prime
minister's parade route.

746
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,395
DALTON: You're telling me

747
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,895
Hizb Al-Shahid is planning an attack

748
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:28,145
on the head of the country

749
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,515
offering them shelter and aid?

750
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:30,647
JOSE: That appears

751
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:31,514
to be the case.

752
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,076
ELIZABETH: Can you
send us a secure link

753
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,200
to this video, please?

754
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,341
FELLOWS: Of course.

755
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,159
Sir, we'll have to disarm
that EFP as soon as possible.

756
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,315
We'll get a team on it.

757
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,355
Await further instructions.
We'll be in touch.

758
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:43,015
WARE: What the hell is

759
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,315
Hizb Al-Shahid doing?

760
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,605
We can't wait to figure it out.

761
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,725
We've got to warn Khoosat
and get him to safety.

762
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,225
HILL: With respect, sir,

763
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:52,435
is showing our hand the best
course of action at this point?

764
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:54,775
Maybe we don't have
to show our entire hand,

765
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:57,565
but we cannot risk
an attack on Khoosat.

766
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:59,855
This terrorist group already
infiltrated the United States

767
00:29:59,856 --> 00:30:01,275
with a dirty bomb.

768
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:05,105
If Pakistan falls to them,
it's everyone's worst nightmare:

769
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:07,331
nuclear weapons in the
hands of jihadists

770
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:09,636
with no hesitation to use them.

771
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,258
You must forgive me for not
calling first to thank you

772
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,758
for your extremely generous
support, Mr. President.

773
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,838
This is not a call about our
aid package, Prime Minister.

774
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,298
This is a warning.

775
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,168
We know Pakistan is
harboring Jibral Disah

776
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,267
and members of Hizb Al-Shahid.

777
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:33,668
Um, excuse me?

778
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:36,798
We have indisputable
proof that Jibral Disah

779
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,798
and members of Hizb
Al-Shahid are receiving aid

780
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,128
from within your borders,

781
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:44,378
that, in fact, Disah

782
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,208
is harbored in Islamabad as we speak.

783
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:49,508
(sighs)

784
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:53,088
Let me understand.

785
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:57,508
Against the wishes of every
member of my cabinet,

786
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,468
against the fierce convictions

787
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,088
of virtually every citizen of Pakistan,

788
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:06,418
I have given the United States
unprecedented access to track

789
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,628
all of our nuclear weapons,
and now you come to me

790
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,508
outraged about what your
additional secret intelligence

791
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:14,668
inside our borders
supposedly shows you?

792
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,548
Pretending to be shocked that
our countries spy on each other

793
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,088
may not be your best line of
defense here, Prime Minister.

794
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,418
I have no strategy, Conrad.

795
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:24,708
You know the work I've done
with my administration

796
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,708
to cut our ties to radicalism.

797
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:29,338
Do not assume, based
on the faults in our past...

798
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,479
I make no assumptions.

799
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,838
These are known operatives of HS

800
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,508
on the streets of Islamabad
about two hours ago.

801
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,798
They're planting explosives
along your parade route.

802
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,838
I'll need proof of their identity.

803
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,838
ELIZABETH: We can provide that.

804
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,338
And you should know, Prime Minister,

805
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,258
I gave coded information

806
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:53,588
about Hizb Al-Shahid to
your foreign minister

807
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,128
at our state reception.

808
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:59,628
And after assuring us he would
pass that information on to you,

809
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:01,968
that information was instead

810
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:04,468
received by HS in Islamabad,

811
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:06,628
where they promptly acted on it.

812
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,918
Mr. President, you must believe...

813
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,968
DALTON: It doesn't matter
what you knew or didn't know.

814
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,548
Not now.

815
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,628
What matters is that you stay safe.

816
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,508
For whatever reason, these terrorists

817
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,588
your administration is in bed
with are turning on you.

818
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,708
And if you're not safe, neither
is our nuclear agreement.

819
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,168
(scoffs)

820
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:30,013
Your concern for my
well-being is... touching.

821
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,008
ELIZABETH: We have a team on the
ground ready to take out Disah.

822
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,668
We politely ask for your help.

823
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,798
Or, even better, do the job yourself.

824
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,668
That means root out all members
of HS and send them packing.

825
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,668
Then get your own house in order.

826
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,668
Madam Secretary,

827
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:48,128
you say it was my foreign minister

828
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:49,708
you shared this information with?

829
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,809
Yes.

830
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:56,708
I thank you for your candor.

831
00:32:56,709 --> 00:33:00,588
Mr. President, Madam Secretary.

832
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,859
(click, beep)

833
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:08,968
Whatever's going on, I don't
think Khoosat is in on it.

834
00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:12,258
Well, we'll see what
his next moves are,

835
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,439
and let's hope this is the end of it.

836
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,378
Sir.

837
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,418
JOSE: <i>Damn it!</i>

838
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:21,918
We just lost our eyes.

839
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,418
Our ops team got called off
to cover this damn parade.

840
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,838
(exhales) We really need
that phone to go live.

841
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,758
Guys.

842
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,088
What? What is it?

843
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,588
Something just posted

844
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,668
on the foreign ministry's
Twitter account.

845
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,769
(phone ringing)

846
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:43,378
I'm here, I'm here.
What is it? Are you okay?

847
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:44,968
Did Pakistan give the U.S. access

848
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,548
to track its nuclear weapons?

849
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:47,968
Where did you get that?

850
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:51,769
The foreign minister just posted
it on his Twitter account.

851
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,468
He did what?

852
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:56,838
He has pictures of
U.S. nuclear inspectors

853
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,838
at three different bases,
all in the last week.

854
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,841
- Is it true?
- I-I got to call the White House.

855
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:02,008
Elizabeth.

856
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,088
People are going crazy in the streets.

857
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,299
(glass shattering in distance)

858
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,609
Is it true?

859
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,128
Do you, uh...

860
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:11,378
do you remember when we
thought the prime minister

861
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:14,968
might be cooperating
with Hizb Al-Shahid?

862
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,208
All I can say is

863
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,798
we let him know,

864
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,588
and now his foreign
minister just played

865
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:23,088
his ace.

866
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:25,508
And it is a really big ace, Henry.

867
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,008
I-I got to go.

868
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:28,668
I-I'll call you back, okay?

869
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:30,979
I love you. Bye.

870
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,128
(elevator dings)

871
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,298
(speaking indistinctly)

872
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:38,968
BLAKE: I'm here. I'm here.

873
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,968
Great. Thanks, everyone.

874
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,917
DAISY: Matt's still

875
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,381
- on his way.
- BLAKE: Regular drip.

876
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,744
- The best I could do.
- Thank you.

877
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,838
What's the latest on the
embassy evacuation?

878
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,838
The first Chinook disembarked
from Shindand Air Base.

879
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,838
It's due to arrive within the hour.

880
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,342
An airlift? Is that really necessary?

881
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,468
The streets are already chaos.

882
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,048
JAY: Here's to social media. Unrest

883
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:58,130
at the speed of light.

884
00:34:58,131 --> 00:34:59,875
Do we really think the
government will fall?

885
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:02,168
I mean, they re-stabilized
after the conflict with India.

886
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,258
The only thing worse to
Pakistanis than giving in

887
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:05,962
to India is giving in
to the United States.

888
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:07,798
ELIZABETH: Tell Minister
Avdonin I'm ready

889
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,464
for the call.

890
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:09,128
Yes, ma'am.

891
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,798
ELIZABETH: And try and get Henry!

892
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:11,798
BLAKE: Yep!

893
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,298
Um...

894
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:16,128
Why is she calling the
Russian foreign minister?

895
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:18,128
Render safe mission.

896
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,378
The agreement between
the U.S. and Russia

897
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,128
to secure Pakistan's nuclear arsenal

898
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:23,588
if the government falters.

899
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,798
Even after everything we've
been through with Russia?

900
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:28,128
Probably the one thing
that trumps politics.

901
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:31,628
If Pakistan's nukes fall
into the hands of radicals,

902
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,628
that's not just a
problem for Pakistan...

903
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:38,149
that's a problem for humanity.

904
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,519
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

905
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:45,048
(whirring)

906
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:46,801
- ELIZABETH: Can you hear me?
- Yeah. Sorry.

907
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:49,345
- It's a little hectic here.
- There's a Chinook coming for you.

908
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,048
It's-it's due in less than an hour.

909
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,379
We'll be ready.

910
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,708
Listen, Henry,

911
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,132
I know that y-you're gonna want
to help everybody else first,

912
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,798
but... you need to think

913
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:00,968
of the kids. We need you back.

914
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:02,338
Let's go! This way!

915
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,008
Hey, you know Becky,

916
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,338
that crazy roommate you had
when you lived on Kimbark?

917
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,838
The Jane Austen girl?

918
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,008
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,088
I don't know if you remember,

920
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,838
but the second time I asked you out,

921
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,918
you put me off because you
said Becky invited you

922
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,008
to a <i>Pride and Prejudice </i>ball

923
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,588
and you didn't want to let her down.

924
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:20,838
You remember that?

925
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,838
Yeah, I remember it,
'cause I went to it.

926
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:25,168
(chuckles) You did not.

927
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:28,418
I did. Tom Hodges was
going out with this girl

928
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,482
in the theater department.
She got me a morning coat

929
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:32,208
and a top hat from <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

930
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,878
Henry.

931
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:36,569
I learned the quadrille.

932
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,968
How did I not know about
this until just now?

933
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,378
Uh, because you didn't show up.

934
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,298
Because I begged off to write a paper.

935
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:46,298
Well, I showed up. Looking like...

936
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,968
Oscar Wilde at a pet funeral.

937
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,878
Pictures or it didn't happen.

938
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:54,048
You're gonna have to
take my word for it.

939
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:56,838
I will always show up for you.

940
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,939
Always.

941
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:06,708
Do you think that this counts
as our homework for Dr. Sherman?

942
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,794
JOSE: Henry.

943
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:08,878
I got to go.

944
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:10,208
Just got word from the fixer.

945
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,878
I love you.

946
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:16,088
Disah's using the phone
with the tracker right now.

947
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:17,588
It went live?

948
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:18,918
Jane's hooking us back up.

949
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,918
Hopefully we can still get a signal.

950
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,938
Jose, we're evacuating the embassy.

951
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,088
I didn't travel halfway around the world

952
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,529
to get on a chopper the moment
we have this guy in our sights.

953
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:31,263
Have you looked outside?
This city is falling apart.

954
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,168
Which is the perfect cover
we need to get this done,

955
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,489
like POTUS wants.

956
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,588
We'll evacuate with the
ops team after it's done.

957
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,468
I said I'd get you back, and I will.

958
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,968
You also said never do
anything out of passion.

959
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:45,378
This isn't passion.

960
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,008
This is finishing the job
we came here to do. You go

961
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:49,519
if you want. I'm staying with Jane.

962
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:57,439
(indistinct chatter)

963
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:12,026
(gunfire, indistinct shouting on TV)

964
00:38:14,616 --> 00:38:15,610
WARE: Sir,

965
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:17,610
given the increasing civil unrest,

966
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,230
I recommend we move immediately

967
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,900
to secure all nuclear
weapons in Pakistan.

968
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,520
With NNSA's recent inspections,
JSOC will know exactly where

969
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:27,323
- to go.
- ELIZABETH: I've spoken with Russia.

970
00:38:27,324 --> 00:38:29,690
They're on board and ready
when we say the word.

971
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:32,280
You know why those people are rioting?

972
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,650
National pride.

973
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:37,400
The very idea that their prime
minister agreed to allow us

974
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:40,190
to simply track where their weapons are

975
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:43,190
is sending them into the
streets demanding his head.

976
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,730
And given the volatility...

977
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:46,914
Given the volatility, those
people will see our efforts

978
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:49,320
to secure their arsenal
as nothing less than...

979
00:38:49,321 --> 00:38:51,230
an invasion by a foreign enemy.

980
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:53,610
We do need to consider
the known collaboration

981
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,520
between members of the
Pakistani Parliament

982
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:56,318
and HS.

983
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,613
The greater risk is
allowing any of those groups

984
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:01,520
to gain access to a single warhead.

985
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:05,320
I'm aware of the risk, Ephraim.

986
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:07,824
And if I'd truly lost hope that
Khoosat could pull out of this,

987
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:09,860
I wouldn't hesitate
to send the troops in.

988
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:13,610
But once we do that,
Khoosat is finished,

989
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:14,940
along with our nuclear agreement.

990
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:17,780
Hell, the whole country could
become a bigger mess than Syria.

991
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:20,940
We've got to let this play
out a little longer. Let's...

992
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,980
offer Khoosat military escort
to one of our air bases.

993
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,980
Get him to safety,

994
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,780
let him regroup.

995
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,671
I'll reach out and make the offer.

996
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:35,251
Thanks for coming in, everyone.

997
00:39:38,151 --> 00:39:39,961
(door opens)

998
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,650
How's Murphy Station?

999
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,900
They're evacuating with
the rest of the embassy.

1000
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:51,150
Just waiting to hear when they
arrive at Shindand Air Base.

1001
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:53,150
So...

1002
00:39:53,151 --> 00:39:55,150
Good night, sir.

1003
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:57,251
Good night.

1004
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,980
(knocking)

1005
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,610
(gasps)

1006
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:03,861
- Oh.
- We're gathering.

1007
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:04,946
I didn't know if you wanted

1008
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:05,547
to come.

1009
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,981
No, yeah. Um, sorry.

1010
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,071
What's this?

1011
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:08,860
It was delivered

1012
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:10,860
while you were sleeping.

1013
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:13,110
That's, um,

1014
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,820
Arabian jasmine.

1015
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,440
At least, that's what I ordered.

1016
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:18,520
I really have

1017
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:20,520
no idea.

1018
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,690
Hey... Oh!

1019
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:24,520
That's... Okay.

1020
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,001
Very nice.

1021
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,121
(chuckles)

1022
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:32,291
Off to the meeting.

1023
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,320
(elevator dings)

1024
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:37,730
No, no. You go ahead.

1025
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:38,401
Ma'am.

1026
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,070
Blake.

1027
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,094
The prime minister is en
route to the air base now.

1028
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:42,980
However, the Chinook
carrying the employees

1029
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:45,280
from the Islamabad embassy
just arrived at Shindand,

1030
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:47,203
and Murphy Station is not on board.

1031
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,190
What?

1032
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:50,752
I've put out word to locate them
immediately, but given the chaos

1033
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,364
- of the evacuation...
- No, no, no, no. They have to find them.

1034
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:55,422
DAISY: Ma'am.

1035
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:59,860
Prime Minister Khoosat left
without our military escort.

1036
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,296
(indistinct shouting)

1037
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,831
(horn honking)

1038
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,881
(loud thumping)

1039
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:17,692
_

1040
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,454
_

1041
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,331
_

1042
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:23,166
_

1043
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:24,379
_

1044
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:26,501
(indistinct shouting)

1045
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,650
_

1046
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:34,211
(grunting)

1047
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,241
_

1048
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:40,939
_

1049
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:45,751
(shouting, grunting)

1050
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:53,230
DALTON: This is nothing less than
a hit on Prime Minister Khoosat

1051
00:41:53,231 --> 00:41:55,400
called by his own foreign minister.

1052
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:58,610
He knew exactly what he was
doing by sending that tweet.

1053
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:00,110
And now it's done.

1054
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:01,520
PARKER: JSOC is ready

1055
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,110
to initiate render safe, Mr. President.

1056
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:05,940
SecDef recommends we do it immediately.

1057
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,730
It'll unleash total chaos.

1058
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:11,570
But it's hard to see
our way out of it now.

1059
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,150
I believe it's the right call,
Mr. President.

1060
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:16,820
I would agree, sir.

1061
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,320
What about Murphy Station?

1062
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,730
I'm assured they'll
be brought to safety.

1063
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:24,320
Once they're located.

1064
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:26,820
I'd like to wait until all of
our citizens are out of danger.

1065
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:29,940
ELIZABETH: I appreciate
that, Mr. President,

1066
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:34,440
but securing over 100 nuclear
warheads in a fallen regime

1067
